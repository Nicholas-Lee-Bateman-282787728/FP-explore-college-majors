4350352,5,B004EPYZQ2,"One of the things that make certain summers at the movies something more than just an endless stream of special effects blockbusters that promise a lot of bang for your buck, but in the end seem to offer precious little in the way of substance, is that sometimes there is that special kind of ""blockbuster"" that has everything you could want, and something more.  And while that is becoming an increasingly rare species in the 21st century, every once in a while it happens.  SUPER 8, from writer/director J.J. Abrams, who directed the 2009 STAR TREK and 2006's MISSION IMPOSSIBLE III, is certainly one of those films for the summer of 2011.

Instead of going with a big-name cast, Abrams went with comparative unknowns, most of whom were young kids.  The film is set in a small Ohio town during the summer of 1979.  Several kids, including Joel Courtney and Elle Fanning, are in the process of making a zombie horror flick using Super 8-millimeter Kodak film when, one night, they witness a violent train wreck that involves a truck being driven by their biology teacher (Glynn Turman).  The accident is caught on camera, and they really think nothing of it...until the Air Force mysteriously moves in to seal the accident scene.  Turman warns the kids that if they tell anyone about this ""incident"", they and their parents may suffer some consequences too horrible to contemplate.  The local police, led by Kyle Chandler, get precious little cooperation from the Air Force guys, including Noah Emmerich, and there's a good reason why.  Back in 1963, Turman had been a member of the Air Force involved in an Area 51-type of alien encounter, and had tried to help the aliens which had landed on Earth with their spaceship; instead, the Air Force not only dismissed him but tried to destroy any and all traces of his work.  The end result is a film that has plenty of mayhem, both human and alien alike, but ends on a largely hopeful note (even though some may be dissatisfied with that kind of a resolution).

By setting the film back in 1979, Abrams bought us back to a world where Blackberrys, Blue Tooths, the Internet, and all other electronic communications devices either didn't exist yet or were merely in the planning stages, hence the presence of CB radios and the kids' use of Super-8 millimeter film for their proposed George Romero-type endeavor (and references, via posters on walls, to DAWN OF THE DEAD).  In many ways, SUPER 8 resembles THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT and PARANORMAL ACTIVITY in that Abrams doesn't make it easy for the audience to figure out everything in one bold plot stroke, though he does utilize several elements of his mentor's films CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND and E.T., in the way things go haywire and the power goes out with the aliens' presence (the aliens remain mostly shadow figures until the climax).  And as happens in E.T., the military and the law seem to be depicted in a much more sinister light than the aliens themselves (even with all the mayhem being caused), and the kids, including Fanning (who looks like a dead ringer for a grown-up Drew Barrymore), are far more sympathetic people than the adults.

The presence of such great 1979 hits as ""Heart Of Glass"" (by Blondie) and ""My Sharona"" (by the Knack) amidst Michael Giacchino's dramatic score give us a good feel of what it was like back in those days.  So even if the alien story part of the film is pretty much part-and-parcel of special effects blockbusters, it is what Abrams does with this plot that makes SUPER 8 more than just a blockbuster; it is a film worthy of comparisons to Spielberg himself, though not slavishly imitative of him.",1307664000,7,3655,4.7248427672955975
4350353,3,B004EPYZQ2,"Young friends in the late 70's witness a huge train wreck while filming a movie. What they soon realize is that something escaped from the train during the accident and the military will do anything to cover it up.
  Super 8 starts out exciting, becomes very slow in the middle and then is exciting again. So I never found the pacing to be too good, while the film also reminded me of way too many Spielberg movies, including E.T, War of Worlds, Close Encounters and Goonies ""which he produced"" among others. While the thing in it ""and I won't give away what it is"", isn't very original looking.
  I will say that the film at least works emotionally and that all of the young actors are very strong in their roles. The look of the film is also faithful to Spielberg which works since the film is basically a tribute to him. But they might as well have gave away more of the plot in the trailers since the movie really isn't too original.",1307664000,4,937,4.367816091954023
4350354,4,B004EPYZQ2,"J.J. Abrams is a writer/director/producer I can't quite get a read on. I never bothered with any of the TV series he was involved with (""Alias,"" ""Lost,"" ""Fringe"") and after practically loathing Mission: Impossible II, I skipped III altogether. On the other hand though, Star Trek was pretty fantastic, Joy Ride sits comfortably in my collection of guilty pleasures, and Cloverfield was pretty decent at times. So Abrams work basically ranges from okay to amazing to me. So you can understand why my excitement for Super 8 was easy to contain. Trailers didn't reveal much of anything. Other than some kids making a zombie movie that witness a devastating train crash with some sort of extraordinary creature as its cargo being unleashed and the trailers giving off a big E.T. vibe, there wasn't much else to take away from it. That's the point with an Abrams project though; that key element is kept secret to pique interest and the payoff is usually something spectacular. Super 8 certainly delivers something worth waiting for.

We spend most of the time with the kids of the film. If it's not the zombie film we're focused on, it's the friendship between Joe (Joel Courtney) and Charles (Riley Griffiths) or the relationship that develops between Joe and Alice (Elle Fanning). Something tragic happens to Joe and it's a story point that manages to make itself relevant throughout the course of the film. As you can imagine, the first half of the film is a little slow. Things crawl along while some depth is added to the characters. Character development is never something to be ashamed of.

The train wreck is where things pick up. The sound effects used in the film are so loud, so distinct, and so precise that it makes you feel like you're actually there at that train station witnessing this horrific event in person. The sound utilized in the film is a huge drawing point for seeing the film in theaters. Explosions are felt not heard as the creature's screams seem to vibrate your very bones.

Speaking of explosions, the special effects are also quite impressive. The teases leading up to the creature's big reveal draw a lot of interest. Cars being thrown in the air, heavy machinery being totally destroyed in an instant, something monstrous and inhuman being seen in reflective surfaces, and people screaming for their lives as something races across the screen and abducts them. But obviously the actual creature is the high point of the special effects. Look no further than the Kelvin gas station scene, the bus scene, or the entire finale for proof of this. As far as the creature is concerned, Cloverfield will probably be the first thing that comes to mind. But you actually get to SEE what was on that train and it's fairly astounding.

The film is kind of like if E.T. and The Goonies were combined into one film along with bits of Cloverfield and Battle: Los Angeles injected into it. You know, if Battle: Los Angeles wasn't a total letdown.

Super 8 is a rather brilliant sci-fi thriller. There's plenty of buildup and character development, which results in big action sequences having a bigger impact and actually makes you care about these characters when something goes wrong for them. The creature is teased for so long that when you do finally see it, it feels like a huge accomplishment. The cast of kids is really the heart of the film while Elle Fanning's exceptional acting puts her ahead of the pack. The film blindsides you in the gut with a strong assault of emotion that makes you reminisce the best and most memorable Steven Spielberg films. Not to mention the outstanding special effects and loud yet engaging use of sound. Super 8 is an emotionally powerful sci-fi film featuring a wonderful cast, solid storyline, immense sound effects, groundbreaking special effects, and some ridiculously awesome action sequences.",1307664000,6,3858,4.866057838660578
4350355,5,B004EPYZQ2,"I have been looking forward to seeing this movie for awhile now and have built high expectations in that time. Luckily, this movie meets those high expectations. This is one movie you should not miss. This movie will surely draw comparisons to ET and other movies but this movie can stand by itself. This movie is for a new generation so the thinking will be different. The acting in this movie is very good. The actors portray their characters perfectly and it looks as if all the actors are completely comfortable in their roles. I wish the acting from the children was a little better but it is passable. It is great to see how they view the world and comprehend all of the events. The directing from J.J. Abrams is great. He makes the movie flow nicely and doesn't rush any parts. Some scenes may be a little overplayed but it doesn't take away from the film. The story is not predictable with the exception of the ending. The story does include a few cliches. The story is, overall, well-written. The dialogue is also well-written. It does not feel like it was written by a 13 year old unlike some other movies. The action is great and well-directed. The action scenes are intense and the derailing train scene is great! The film has a nice pace to it so that it doesn't feel rushed or too slow. One problem I have with the movie is the ending. It is not very good and a little cheesy. Another thing is that I would love to know more about some characters. It would've helped the movie and I feel like we don't know enough about Alice's father. Overall, I recommend that you see this film and form your own opinion. Just make sure that you do not know too much before going in. Super 8 is a great summmer flick with a good story. The film has plenty of good moments that make this one you will not soon forget!",1307577600,10,1815,4.35693215339233

As a homage to Spielberg, with a splash of Reiner thrown in, SUPER 8 is pretty much spot on. And as a mash-up of monster movie and coming-of-age drama its also close to the mark. SUPER 8 is clearly a heartfelt and sincere tribute to Abramss heroes, but its just a tad too knowing for its own good. It pushes all the usual buttons, is shamelessly sentimental, and is somewhat smug about it. But all this is OK because thats how this kind of movie is meant to be. Abrams doesnt break any new ground or reinvent the wheel but he does succeed in entertaining.  SUPER 8 is an accomplished, if instantly forgettable, old-school blockbuster. It doesnt make a lot of sense at times, especially in the final act when the behaviour of the armed forces becomes mystifying. But who cares?  this is fun pure and simple and theres nothing wrong with that.",1493510400,,847,4.4935064935064934
4351387,5,B004EPYZQ2,"Every once in a great while, a certain film comes along that successfully fires on all cylinders and resonates with something inside you that hasn't been active since you were a child. ""Super 8"" manages to do just that, stir up imaginations I once thought were completely dormant, where the overly-critical, cynical adult in me keeps the whimsical child chained up in a dark and isolated dungeon called ""The Impossible."" I sincerely want to thank everybody who made this film a reality and, more to the point, for taking me back to that magical and far more innocent time in my life.

The story kicks off in 1979, in the fictional town of Lillian, Ohio, where thirteen year old Joe Lamb is trying to cope and move on from the recent death of his mother, who died in a freak factory accident.

Much to the ever-growing frustration of his father, the town's deputy sheriff, Joe endeavors to do this by immersing himself in an ambitious project, a literal labor of love lead by his best friend, Charles; a horror film, shot on a SUPER 8 camera. Charles has enlisted the aid of not only Joe, but the rest of his misfit band of friends and has shocked everyone by talking Alice Dainard, the prettiest girl in school, into playing the hero's wife. On the night of their first big shoot, these would be filmmakers all witness one of the single-most horrific train crashes I think I have ever seen put to film. After that, the town of Lillian is swarmed by military men, who won't reveal to anyone what's really going on.

That is probably far more than I should have revealed. But I trust it will have whetted your appetite to discover the rest for yourself.

For now, just take heart when I tell you that I was most entertained and moved by this film, mostly due to its solid direction, endearing performances and well crafted screenplay. It's an undeniably exciting juvenile adventure peppered with wide doses of ""Spielbergian"" nostalgia. By that, I refer more specifically to the characters, atmosphere, and tone. They all combine to perfectly emulate that classic ""Steven Spielberg style"" from the '70s and the '80s, when his films-(either as a director or producer)-literally changed the landscape of popular cinema.

Movies like this are the reason I so happen to enjoy movies. In an age when theatrical trailers give away anything and everything about films months ahead of their proper release, a rare gem such as ""Super 8"" unfolds and captures us in its spell....never letting go. It is an unforgettable movie experience. Truly a film to be treasured.",1492473600,,2553,4.753950338600451

4351389,5,B004EPYZQ2,"Even though J.J. Abrams was the director of this film, you could see Steven Spielbergs influence all through it. At various times I was reminded of E.T., Close encounters of The Third Kind, the Indiana Jones movies and even Poltergeist. and all in a good way.  The plot is discussed by other reviewers so Ill not go into it in detail here. I did find it to be somewhat confusing and overly complex at points but the teenage protagonists, as they so often do in movies of this sort manage to outdo the adults and even the military with their heroics.

This is no small budget indie film. As is typical with Spielbergs movies, everything about it is LARGE scale. There is a massive train wreck (perhaps somewhat overdone compared to a real wreck of its type) for example along with a town being completely overrun by the big, bad military, intent on cleaning up the problem and keeping the truth from the townspeople. Andwhat typical sci-fi, thriller, Saturday afternoon-type movie well stocked with precocious teenagers would be complete without the military being as much the bad guy as the monster?

In spite of any shortcomings, I thoroughly enjoyed watching this film and I expect I will be watching it many more times. Just seeing how the kids in it interact with each other and carry the film make it worth watching alone. It is a fun film for the entire family (i.e. PG-13) although I think that some children below about age 8 or 9 may find it a tad scary.",1490400000,,1463,4.576335877862595

The depiction of these kids was spot on. They seem to act  suspiciously like kids that I remember. Although Super 8 has a nice science fiction hook(escaped alien from Area 51), for my money the fascinating part was watching the kids make their zombie flick.
  You may find that it resonates with you more if you remember Super 8 film and cameras, and the experience of watching home movies when they were truly movies, but it is certainly not a requirement. Super 8 is a darker E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial, and a loving homage to Spielberg films of the 80's.",1471910400,4,712,4.461538461538462

I also love the scene in the diner when Joe and his friends kid around with each other.  The dialogue is really clever and the kids are convincing as friends who relate by poking fun at each other.

4352959,4,B004EPYZQ2,"This film is, taken at face value, a sci-fi film.  However, for me, it as a period piece focusing on early teen years around 1980.  In 1980 I was about the same age as the kids in this movie, I believe Abrams (writer/director) was about their age too.  Abramss story captures what life was like for kids at that time.  From the scenery of a struggling Rust Belt community, to the hobbies (model making, amateur filming (pre-video tape), and to relationships of early teens this film nails life as I remember it.  Little touches like the posters on the wall, film taking days to develop, and many other subtle nods to a simpler day in time really add authenticity to this film.  The budding relationship between the lead child actor and the lead child actress has a charming, innocent, and yet all too believable feel to it.  Also, the relationship between the two lead child actors as they come to terms with their crush on the same girl was well done and easy for viewers to relate to.  While this film is not non-stop action, more story driven, the sci-fi action is well done and keeps the tension up.  Overall this film has a good story, good acting, good set design, good score, and good special effects and so it makes for a good time.",1463356800,,1240,4.475555555555555

This movie feels like it wants to be a big blockbuster, but the underlying story is just a bit too familiar for it to really grab hold of the imagination. Still, it was an enjoyable bit of entertainment for my wife and I for a couple of hours - especially as it is set in 1979 when we were roughly the age of the teen protagonists in the film.

A bit gory in one or two places but it won't mess with your digestion over dinner.

 When you combine the magic and wonder of Steven Spielberg as producer with the directorial rhythms and genius of writer/director/producer J.J. Abrams you can reasonably hope to get a masterpiece of movie making.  Spielberg is responsible for such memorable films as ET, Saving Private Ryan, Jurassic Park and Jaws.  He can terrify us.  More than that, he has the graceful touch that portrays middle school children in a way that is both honest and charming.  J.J. Abrams directed the recent Star Trek which revived a dated franchise and delighted old fans and made new ones.  His writing credits include the very well received Armageddon.  We can reasonably expect, with these two cinematic giants, to get a masterpiece.  And we do.
 Not since Rescue Me have middle school kids been portrayed in such a positive, funny, realistic light.  It is almost like Abrams and Spielberg remember their younger days, just messing around with cameras, trying to make home made movies.  The young characters begin the movie engaged in exactly that.  The kids are making their own Zombie movie.
 Elle Fanning, younger sister to Dakota Fanning and a solid veteran of many films even at her tender age of 13, plays Alice Dainard.  Alice is the untouchably pretty classmate that Riley Griffiths, as the student film director Charles, cajoles into staring in his Zombie flick.  Alice stuns her collaborators by the depth and emotion of her acting.  The actress, Elle Fanning, does the same to the audience in the big theater.  Young Ryan Lee appears as the barely teenage pyromaniac Cary and provides some light moments.
 Larry Fong rates high for his efforts in cinematography.  The special effects crew build the most impressive train wreck I have ever seen on the big screen.  Abrams script is tight and reflects the way real kids speak to one another.  His direction of the kids, having them all talk at once and on varied subjects-while following each conversational thread-also brings a smile to the face of those of us who have recent experience of children of this age.  We have excellent writing, direction and cinematography-well above average for each.  But the film will be remembered for the four leading kids, from new comer Joel Courtney to old hand Elle Fanning.  These kids are superb.
 This extra good film runs only one hour and 52 minutes, which is enough to tell the tale but not enough to satisfy my interest in the characters.  Always leave them wanting more, the old Vaudeville players would say, and this one does just that.  It carries a PG-13 rating for scary stuff-justified as there really are some scary parts.  I rate it with a superior four and a half saw blades.  I think this one to be every bit as good as ET or Close Encounters of the Third Kind.",1441584000,,2773,4.815677966101695

4354710,5,B004EPYZQ2,"Super 8 is fun filled popcorn movie.  The 70's nostalgia is nice to see and many of us can relate to that time period growing up.  There has already been several reviews summarizing the whole movie, so no point in doing that.  The train wreck scene is spectacular.  It reminded me of ""The Fugitive"" as one of the best derailments I have seen in a movie. The children are all likeable and intelligent and easy to root for.  The film definitely convenes the 1970's suburban feel where kids and teenagers used their imaginations a lot more, instead being glued to cell phones, tablets and computers like this generation.  The premise of making a simple zombie movie is hilarious in some scenes.  My favorite part of the movie is when the young actress Elle Fanning wow's the boys during her first audition for their horror movie.  She nails her lines and the boys just look at each other like this chick is a natural.  Simple moments like that really help make the film.  If you like any of Spielberg's films you will probably really enjoy this movie.

I thought the alien stuff was interesting but was far more interested in the relationships between the teenagers themselves, how none of them seemed to have strong ties to there parents.  The kids seemed to have a lot of free time on there hands just trying to find something fun to do.  They probably won't do a sequel to this movie but I am interested what ends up happening to the kids in the future. Super 8 is kind of throwback film to every young filmmaker. I found the film highly entertaining, if you don't take the movie too seriously. Of all the big blockbusters that came out that year few lived up to the hype but this is one of the few movies that is worth the time and money to go see.  Super 8 reminded me of a cross between District 9 and the Goonies with its own adventure aspect.",1433462400,,1847,4.42603550295858

4355144,4,B004EPYZQ2,"A kids movie from Spielberg in the typical cliffhanger style that he has but not to a point where it has to be rated ""R"".  You can enjoy it with you kids instead of wondering at what point are you going to have to cover their eyes or stick your fingers in their ears.  But as an adult you can also enjoy the movie.",1427760000,,314,3.890625
4355145,5,B004EPYZQ2,"This is a very enjoyable movie that is kind of like Goonies and ET, again with kids taking on larger roles, in a plot that is larger than the town itself.  The setting is in the early 1980s. I really enjoyed this movie as well as the post-credits feature. There's lots of nostalgia of a time when there is more to a kid's life than video games, smartphones, or Internet. Brilliant movie.",1427673600,,387,4.375

4355147,2,B004EPYZQ2,"When Steven Spielberg was growing up, he borrowed his dad's 8mm movie camera, got a few buddies together and started trying to make action movies.  That's cute stuff when you're watching a biography about how he got into film-making.  But he took that concept onto the big screen...and it was a huge flop.  It's why no one can remember ever seeing ""Super 8"" in the theaters.  It damned near went straight to DVD.

This movie seems like a poor combination of ""Stand By Me"" and ""Cloverfield"".  With Spielberg and JJ Abrams involved, I figured I couldn't go THAT wrong in buying it.  Turns out, they are as capable of making turkeys as anyone.

Rent it if you just have to see it.  I don't think it's going to be going into too many home libraries.  I know my copy is already on the way to the landfill.",1427414400,,800,4.380952380952381

4355439,5,B004EPYZQ2,"Super 8 is a great film if you're longing to enjoy / relive memories of the corresponding time in your life as the main characters are presently at.  I know this genre is one of my favorites but I can't put my finger on why, Abrams & Speilberg as usual do a great job of capturing the 'feeling' that you'd expect and rounding out the cast of characters in a way where there's something they all add to the story that makes any person be able to relate themselves to it.",1425081600,,469,4.153846153846154

4355441,4,B004EPYZQ2,"This is a great movie. The way it's shot really gives it an early 80's Spielberg feel... almost ET-like. The musical score is fantastic and will linger with you after you're done watching.

The story seems to be pretty much par for the course for J.J. Abrams: Starts very strong, great character development, lots of mysteries to solve... and then about halfway through it seems like the story doesn't really have a clear ending and they just threw together the ending at the last minute. This seems to be the case with almost everything from Abrams... Alias... Lost... etc.

Even with the somewhat lacking ending the film is still very enjoyable. There's a lot of nostalgia tossed in and the kids that make of the cast really work great together.

So I would give this five stars based on the technical merits of the cinematography, the scoring, and the cast... but only two or three stars for the story... so in the end I give it four stars mainly because I enjoy the visuals over the actual story.

The Blu-ray edition looks fantastic and there are some scenes that will absolutely shake your whole house if you have a decent speaker setup. There is also a great making of featurette that I enjoyed.",1424649600,4,1202,4.629107981220657

4355554,5,B004EPYZQ2,"Quite a decent movie that as you're watching you can't help but feel nostalgic for other group of kids lead thrillers from the 80's such as Goonies, Stand By Me and others where a bunch of regular looking kids (not 25 year olds playing kids) have to save the day (and their town/world) with the adults not taking what they know seriously. So it's up to kids to save the day. Super 8 throws in the old dead parent, remaining parent overprotective and not really ultimately being the parent they should be, a dysfunctional home for the hot girl who joins the group who of course a couple of the boys want to be more than friends with now that they've gotten past the whole, she's a girl and all angle that many a film from the 80's did.

Super 8 also has a really cool scene that occurs when the kids are filming their zombie flick which of course brings in the military who see nothing wrong with taking control of the town in their own interests. I won't give away any more of the plot, but Super 8 was definitely has that nostalgic feel to it that you just don't come across too much these days.",1424131200,,1096,4.269230769230769

4356134,3,B004EPYZQ2,"During the summer of 1979, a group of boys led by Charles want to make a Super 8 short film for a competition. On the last day of school they recruit Alice to play the detective's wife in their film. They all sneak out at night to film a scene by the railway station. During the shoot, a train comes by. The train is derailed by a pickup truck and everything goes flying everywhere. After running around in a panic, the kids see their science teacher in the truck. He warns them about the dangerous cargo and starts waving a gun around, which is enough to scare them off. But not before gathering all their equipment, including the camera that's been running the whole time.

The kids try to resume a normal life but it turns out the train was a special Air Force train and the military has moved in to clean up the incident. But as people and dogs and mechanical equipment start disappearing, questions start mounting. What was really on the train? What's on the film they took? Will the kids finish their movie in time? What about the other big secret?

What other big secret? The movie opens with a shot of a local factor where their ""No Accidents in X Days"" sign is changed back to ""1."" Deputy Jackson Lamb's wife died there leaving him and son Joe alone. Joe is the sensitive one of the film makers--he does the make-up and makes miniatures too. He's excited when Charles recruits Alice and they have a growing interest in each other. Alice's dad doesn't want Joe around his daughter and Joe's dad has similar feelings about Alice though it is not really clear why. For me, the Joe/Alice plot line is the most interesting part of the movie.

The monster part of the movie is much less interesting. All the exposition about the monster is saved till the end but when it comes the information doesn't explain its actions earlier in the movie. Why is it stealing only certain specific items? Other than creating a spooky atmosphere, why does the monster's presence cause lights and other electrical and mechanical things to go crazy? The action sequences are exciting but they don't add together to make a coherent story. The military is depicted as a bunch of generic cartoonish baddies which makes them less compelling as villains.

The movie is clearly a homage to 1980s science fiction movies, especially the work of Steven Spielberg (who is a producer on the film). Viewers see bits taken from Close Encounters of the Third Kind and E. T. The monster's face reminded me of Predator and its lair was reminiscent of Aliens. Viewers don't really see the monster till the end of the film as in Jaws. Things like that are fun to spot but they are also reminders of much better films.

I wish the film maker's had made the Joe/Alice story the main focus of the film and just used the train wreck and monster running around as background rather than a competing narrative. What could have been a great film is just a mediocre genre piece.",1414108800,,2938,4.546313799621928

4356435,4,B004EPYZQ2,"I give this movie 4 stars really because I love the setup.  The first 40 minutes of this film are superb.  The next 40 are still good, but as a viewer you start getting the impression that the movie is taking a wrong turn and focusing on the wrong plots.  The ending is rather boring and uninspired.

I don't know how they are presented on the DVD/Blu Ray, but the end credits are phenomenal.

This would have been an exceptionally awesome movie without any of the alien monster stuff.  I am good with there being something weird happening that draws everyone together but the monster ends up being extremely cheesy.  I don't know if it is killing people or making friends half the time.  It is enraged but then it is friendly.  Sort of what you would get if you had a schizophrenic ET who had an Alien personality at times.  It really threw the entire story off.  I was so disappointed that the movie turned spent time focusing on the alien doing weird and sometimes monstrous things.

The part with the kids and making the movie (within the movie) was exceptional though and those parts were amazingly inspired.  I just wish the entire movie was that part.  I honestly think it could have won an Academy award.  Abrams is a master at directing personal interactions.  He knows how to move people to believe in characters.  When he gets weird though he goes off the rails.  I'd love to see him write and direct a film about people doing something extraordinary but not supernatural or with science fiction.  Spielberg went on to direct Oscar films like Schindler's List.  Super 8 shows moments of greatness that demonstrate that Abrams could be just as good if he could just find the right film.",1409875200,3,1696,4.571428571428571

But here, in this one instance, I flatly admit I was wrong. Aside from the occasionally inevitable bow to how times have changed, this warmly, perfectly captures the spirit of the best of the humanist sci fi of the 80's, practically developed by Spielberg though done well by a few others.
I just regret I didn't give this one a try on the big screen.

Theres a sense of something semi-autobiographical going on in a film by J.J. Abrams produced by Steven Spielberg that involves kids with a super 8 camera making a movie but this is hardly a movie for children. In the first place there are several movies taking place at once here. First theres the amateur movie the kids are making finally shown over the closing credits which the cretins who charge out immediately as the credits start rolling forcing theatres to raise the houselights would miss completely. Theres the back-story of Joes mother killed in an industrial accident when a steel girder crushes her. Theres Joe being raised by a distant self-contained single father who also happens to be deputy-sheriff of the small city played by Kyle Chandler. Theres a wacky family across the street with the pudgy kid whos the movie maker. Theres the film making in which Joe plays make-up artist and props. Theres the kid obsessed with blowing things up. Theres the neighbourhood mad scientist who teaches middle school and uses his truck to derail a train. Theres the train derailment that occurs while the kids are filming, a rather spectacular special effects-laden pile-up. Theres the air force clean-up operation and cover-up which ends in a scenery-chewing forced evacuation.  Oh, and did I mention the alien?

4356971,2,B004EPYZQ2,"I didn't like this film and I am glad that I rented it only instead of buying. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

In 1979 a group of young teenagers is working on an amateur horror film about a zombie infestation. One night they slip out of homes to film a scene which happens on an abandoned railway station. When doing it they witness a terrible train derailment, during which SOMETHING escapes from a kind of an armored wagon... and then the film really begins.

Even if this film was directed by J.J. Abrams (which made me suddenly very concerned about the next STAR WARS movie...), it was produced by Steven Spielberg and it is clear from the beginning that ""Super 8"" is just a mixture of recycled elements from ""E.T."", ""Close encounters of the third kind"" and ""Taken"". It wouldn't be a problem if this mix was well made - but it was NOT!

The story is silly and terribly predictable, filled with every possible clich in the book. US military and US government are presented as some kind of Nazis. The alien creature is a kind and gentle thing and it kills only bad people, namely those who wear uniforms... A drug using, vulgar slacker (Jeez, what a role model!) is the main ally of children against the bad US government, who not only abuses gentle alien creatures but also routinely murders US citizens. I also couldn't really feel any sympathy for little heroes from ""Super 8"" - unlike in ""E.T."", far from being nice kids, they are a mixture of boring and annoying brats with deep issues.

As many other recent films, this one tries to be a sci-fi film for both adult and young public - just to fail on both counts, as it is too violent and scary for a kid's movie and too childish for a grown-up movie...

There is a lot of random unexplained things that happened that you are expected to just take for granted. A better movie would be Close encounters of the third kind.,1391385600,,303,4.96078431372549
4357416,2,B004EPYZQ2,Interesting show. I am not really into the aliens and monsters type of show.  My kids really enjoyed it.  Fun for them.,1391385600,,119,4.363636363636363
4357417,5,B004EPYZQ2,If you are looking for a modern take on those old 80's and 90's male adventure movies... this is the film for you!,1391385600,,114,4.0
4357418,5,B004EPYZQ2,"Probably the only people who won't like this movie are grumpy old men and over-starched, sour-pussys. Very well-paced and directed. First rate production. But it is meant to be fun! This is not Gone With The Wind. It is not Citizen Kane.
Comes with Blue Ray disk and a enhanced DVD disk which also has digital copies of the movie you can copy onto your computer, tablet, smartphone or whatever.",1391299200,,394,4.642857142857143
4357419,4,B004EPYZQ2,"Interesting, however, I wished the scenes with the alien were not so dark.  How to see what he looked like.",1391299200,,107,4.35
4357420,1,B004EPYZQ2,Thought it was going to be a thriller. It was awful. Too much screaming and very loud. Didn't finish it.,1391299200,,104,4.25
4357421,3,B004EPYZQ2,"If you're an adult, you might enjoy the train scene (17:00 - 19:00), but otherwise you'll regret wasting 2 hours. It's like ""Batteries Not Included.""",1391126400,,149,5.0

4357423,4,B004EPYZQ2,Not just a kid's movie but a good story and cast.  Totally enjoyed it.  Would certainly recommend to my friends.,1391040000,,112,4.55
4357484,4,B004EPYZQ2,"I liked it because it's told pretty much from the viewpoint of middle school (adolescent) kids in the late 1970s, who are trying to make their own movie and stumble onto something beyond their comprehension.  It's a little formulaic, with the military being the bad guys doing some kind of cover-up, and not telling anyone what's going on.  If you like science fiction that keeps you guessing about what's really happening until fairly late in the movie, you will probably like this.  The special effects are pretty good, although toward the end of the film, it seems a little heavy on blowing things up without really adding to the plot.",1390953600,,638,4.781818181818182
4357485,5,B004EPYZQ2,"My son (13) has watched this a number of times and really wanted me to see it with him.  I really enjoyed it.  It is pretty empowering to kids and I love the line ""drugs are so bad for you.""",1390953600,,190,3.725
4357486,5,B004EPYZQ2,The kids in the lead roles of this movie are what drew me into this movie.  They are perfect together.  The sci fi aspect is sort of scary but I found myself feeling sorry for the alien too.  This is a good one to watch!,1390953600,,220,3.8444444444444446
4357487,1,B004EPYZQ2,Silly and not worth the price of admission. Spielberg should be ashamed of himself for putting this garbage out for consumption.,1390867200,,128,5.142857142857143

4357489,5,B004EPYZQ2,Fun and original. Had a couple good laughs with one of the Characters (zombie boy) good movie to watch again with company!,1390867200,,122,4.590909090909091
4357490,5,B004EPYZQ2,"I thought it was great. You never got a clear view of the Alien until the end. You could guess that something un-human was on the loose, but no one had a clue, until one kid figured it out.
I can watch this movie over and over again.",1390867200,,233,3.875
4357491,5,B004EPYZQ2,I loved this movie.  It showed how friends stick together through thick and then and how two bitter dads come together for a common purpose.  The ending was very sweet.,1390694400,,168,4.566666666666666

4357493,4,B004EPYZQ2,"Suspenseful,the alien turned out to be a somewhat hackneyed. Liked the acting by the entire cast,the kids really impressed me and steal the film as far as I'm concerned. A good sit on the couch family film.",1390435200,,206,4.594594594594595
4357784,5,B004EPYZQ2,Keeps you interested all the way through and has a very intriguing story.  It has energy and/or suspense from beginning to end.,1390435200,,127,4.7727272727272725
4357785,5,B004EPYZQ2,"Watched this with the family. Very fun, exciting and reminded me a little bit of the Goonies (on steroids).  Entertaining.",1390262400,,122,5.1
4357786,2,B004EPYZQ2,If you've seen the trailer you've seen all the special effects. I made it to the end but it was anti-climatic and just not believable. The aliens escape is very poorly done and unimaginative.,1390262400,,191,4.647058823529412

4357788,4,B004EPYZQ2,"I saw this movie back when it was in the theaters. This is the kind of movie that will entertain you and that you need to pay attention to details. No doubt it is a family movie, though some parts are not suited for younger kids. Good suspense, excellent visual effects. Maybe a little bit less feel good at the end would give it the 5 stars. Overall, if you like Abrahams and Spielberg movies you'll love this one. I do. I will see it again.",1390176000,,442,4.151162790697675

4357790,4,B004EPYZQ2,Great film. You can definitely feel Spielbergs presence in the film. An original story that has an 80's made vibe to it. Its Goonies meets ET!,1390176000,,142,4.5

4357792,5,B004EPYZQ2,Super 8 is super-engaging!  It kept the adults and kids enthralled the whole time.  The writing was brilliant- a perfect balance of suspense and hilarious one-liners!,1390089600,,166,5.346153846153846
4357793,3,B004EPYZQ2,"Spielberg lost his touch. The special effects are nice and all, but the characters have no ""character"" except for maybe 2 of the kids.

Id give it a higher/lower score if I actually finished the last hour of it.",1390003200,,211,4.410256410256411
4358002,2,B004EPYZQ2,The film had some interest to it but it was too childish and the scifi monster was just another iteration on E.T.,1390003200,,113,4.181818181818182

4358011,1,B004EPYZQ2,Quality of the Amazon prime video through the Kindle was terrible. Very blurry at times and real dark. Movie itself was very good. Amazon has work to do in terms of streaming video.,1389398400,,181,4.515151515151516
4358162,3,B004EPYZQ2,....how this movie would've done without the Spielberg/Abrams names on the poster.  Can't really figure out if I liked it or not.  I will say that the young lady who played the female lead was really good...I think we'll see more of her.,1389398400,,237,4.488372093023256

The script was encumbered by one teen's frequent obscenities which was a distraction to the reviewer.

For the reasons above, I gave a three star-recommendation which in my mind would exclude family viewing.",1389139200,,433,5.084507042253521

4358170,4,B004EPYZQ2,"Not sure why this didn't do better in theaters. It's a classic Spielberg-style story and movie, like the early films of the late 70's with a group of kids as the main characters. I guess everything nowadays needs more explosions and boobs to sell. Too scary for young children but otherwise fine for our family.

Abrams could have filled this movie with the kids continuing to make their movie on the sly, with the girl sneaking around her dad, the boys ""liberating"" props from their parents, and had the alien, and had the US govt acting like those in ""E.T. the Extraterrestrial,"" warding and protecting, but be frank: that movie would have been a lot harder to write, and Abrams does not like working that hard.",1388793600,,548,4.591836734693878

Characters seemed real, and the story hit all of the beats that made those movies so memorable.  It loses a little steam near the end, but the ride is so fun and enjoyable, and you genuinely care for the characters.  Definitely worth repeated viewings, and the blu-ray itself looks incredible.

It's nothing like a Super Man, Bat Man, Star Trek, Iron Man, Thor........that I fall out the door in a frenzy to go see .It has a real believable story line. It's not a ET phone home movie ether (that caused a gag reflex half way through). It is full of kid actors, but meant somewhat more for the adults.

No Spoiler here, so I say a great story line SciFi ( time period is ""kids get out of the house and go do something type movie""). For Adults that had grown up in the 70's and 80's, I get the feeling you can more relate. Maybe it just me,",1384905600,,570,3.9565217391304346

4359009,4,B004EPYZQ2,"Even though the movie lacked continuity and a reasonable story line, I was caught up in the action. The final scene did not wrap up the many questions that were not answered earlier. It is the kind of movie that I feel guilty saying that I like, but it held my interest throughout. I am usually disappointed when a movie leaves me with so many unanswered questions, but something about Super 8 made the time spent to watch it worthwhile.
I enjoyed Joel Courtney's performance. He had a mixture of naivete and sophistication that seemed to fit the movie well. One minute he seemed to know exactly what was happening and the next minute he seemed to be at a loss about what he should do next.",1383868800,,690,4.440944881889764

from pg 13  - 7yr olds ?  there is a monster so watch it before the younger ones see it.",1383696000,,314,3.9206349206349205
4359096,4,B004EPYZQ2,"Set in the late 1970's in an Ohio town, ""Super 8"" perfectly represents the small town atmosphere of the era; the clothing, cars, appliances and cultural references are all perfectly tuned to the time. A group of nerdy middle school kids is focused on creating a zombie movie for a competition when they witness a horrific accident at the train station, but they're not convinced that it was an accident. When the super 8 film is finally developed a few days later, they know that something bizarre has happened in their town. The inexplicable occurrences start to mount - people and metallic objects gone missing, power disturbances, dogs that have run away, cars that won't operate, etc. In a town meeting, the locals claim that the Soviets are to blame. I had to remember back to that era to be reminded of what a threat Russia was back then !

The human plot centers around two kids, both of whom have lost one parent and are struggling to relate to the remaining damaged parent. The monster plot centers around an extra terrestrial being that has apparently gotten stuck on earth and can't find a way back home (remember ET?). The visual and plot references to the monster are rather confusing and conflicted - is it a good monster or a bad monster? Even the glimpses of the monster are brief and incomplete.

Eventually the plot all comes together and the loose ends are tied up in a satisfactory way. The special effects are superb, as expected from a Spielberg film, and the acting, given that a bunch of 12-13 year olds are the main characters, is believable. It is an entertaining and interesting movie, though certainly not with the universal appeal of ET.",1383523200,,1666,4.6825938566552905

4359201,5,B004EPYZQ2,"""Super 8"" is a charming movie about people in their early to mid teens making super 8 movies way back in the 80's.  It's also a suspenseful movie about about a very big and violent extraterrestrial with legitimate grievances against the human race.  Somehow, the movie blends these two threads seamlessly together.  The young people who play the leads are excellent actors.  'Super 8' is probably the best teens & alien movie ever made.

This movie moved me on so many different levels. It's a classic. The only thing I could've done without was some of the ""cussing"" from kids; it was overdone at times, for sure. This is a movie that kids over, say, 12 can really enjoy. People who used to be kids over 12 should enjoy this, as well. I believe this also works as a ""period piece."" I really felt like it gave a flavor of late seventies, early eighties--a period I only have a hazy feel for, having been born in seventy six.

The script has that perfect sort of believable dialogue that you remember from your childhood and the production values are first rate. I didn't realize until the ending credits that J.J. Abrams directed this; I'd thought it was Speilberg (he was a Producer). Abrams certainly has the deft touch and eye to pull you into the story and keep you totally engaged though the ending.

4359208,3,B004EPYZQ2,"It has some ET-reminiscent moments, mixed with classic SciFi themes (town cops vs alien invader) with a smattering of recent SciFi issues (the US government is the other bad guy)  Some characters (especially the kids) look and sound like they strayed over from a Stephen King movie. And it gets a little campy here and there but nicely so.

Were it not for the tremendous hype this flick got prior to release and the intriguing ad campaign that raised expectations, I might have liked it more. It would make a fun surprise find if one were flipping channels on a Saturday and had never heard of this film. This and Clover fit hand in hand as Big News Big Deal Films of subsequent disappointment.",1382918400,,695,4.596774193548387

At times we were scarred, and at times we were laughing our heads off.  Like I said, it's not too serious--not a Texas Chainsaw massacre, and it's something you can watch with your family.  Very tastefully done, and you will be thoroughly entertained.  This is a great movie for a Sunday afternoon.",1382832000,,464,4.679012345679013

 There's a lot of movies it is not and if seeing young faces in a movie reminds you of something else... stop it and pay attention to the movie you are currently watching. Social sites aren't as social as you may think but you can get your opinions bent on one.

 But it has kids with troubles in it; so doesn't that make it The Goonies? But one of the kids is overweight?

 But there are train tracks in it; so doesn't that make it Stand By Me? But there's a death near the tracks?

 No.

 It's a good, fun, 50s style monster movie... with young people, instead of some 40ish guys, dating women far too young for them,  for the 50s... starring in it.

 I give it 4 stars but because of the internet and all that it collects, I clicked all 5 stars.

 The internet? I give that 3 1/2 stars. It needs work; should have stayed in beta longer.

 Rent it; watch it alone. Never mention on your favorite social site that you've seen it. It will be okay.",1382745600,,1018,4.138461538461539

The plot is pretty far fetched, but that's probably true of most fantasy fiction these days.  Adults will be happy with great picture and sound and well-done special effects.  The child actors are really quite good, and the puppy love between the two leads is endearing.  It's nearly two hours long but goes by much faster, never once bogging down.

4359411,4,B004EPYZQ2,We watched this as a reward for my 7th graders at their lunch time and they really liked it.  There is a little bit of cursing but the story is really well written and relatable.,1382054400,,178,4.085714285714285

4359416,5,B004EPYZQ2,"So far I've watched this one three times.  It is well told scifi  story in the spirit of ET.  It is refreshing that someone can still tell a fantastic story without vulgarity and violence.  Ok there is some minor violence but it is a wholesome movie with characters you like, villans you don't, and a lot of charm.",1381708800,,314,4.362068965517241
4359417,4,B004EPYZQ2,The action and acting by the young people in this film is very good I can't remember what the monster looked like a hour after I watched the film.,1381708800,,146,4.068965517241379
4359418,3,B004EPYZQ2,Interesting for 1st hour then kind of boring and more senseless for remainder of the film. Would rather have been cleaning my attic in hindsight.,1381622400,,145,4.84
4359419,5,B004EPYZQ2,"I don't usually gush about movies, but this is the first movie in recent memory that I felt valued my time as a viewer. It reminded me of films that were made before the age of technology (which was sort of the point of the film). The story, and the viewer's imagination, carried the whole film. I felt that  my time was being respected, that everything I was being shown had narrative justification, and that my intelligence was also being valued. I saw this film in the theatre and put it on my ""to buy"" list right away. I was not disappointed.",1381622400,,546,4.352941176470588
4359420,3,B004EPYZQ2,A bunch of precocious movie kid stereotypes making a movie in the 80's see a train wreck and a mysterious creature.  The rest is okay.  But where is Chunk when you need him?,1381622400,,173,4.212121212121212

4359492,5,B004EPYZQ2,Awesome to see on the big screen and a good home theatre system.  The train scene LFE shook my entire house.  Great movie.,1381449600,,122,4.260869565217392
4359493,3,B004EPYZQ2,It was ok.  It struggled to keep my attention at times.  So I really can't think of much more to say,1381449600,,100,3.7142857142857144
4359494,3,B004EPYZQ2,"An OK sci-fi thriller, with the requisite bug from space, nasty military guardians of earth, concerned scientist, budding young love, very loud special effects. Good but not really that memorable.",1381276800,,196,5.566666666666666
4359495,4,B004EPYZQ2,I like this movie even though it's a little hard to follow in the begining. Towards the middle of the movie it become interesting. You need to pay attention to all of the events that are going to understand what the movie is about. I recommend this movie to those who have an abstract mind. It makes you think about life from another demension and sometimes how cruel we can be with life from another planet.,1381104000,,408,4.381578947368421
4359496,4,B004EPYZQ2,Enjoyable sci-fi movie that the whole family would enjoy. The adults weren't jerks and the kids weren't brats so there is something to be said about that.  The story was more about kid friendships and the strong bond they had between themselves.  This was the second time watching this movie and I'd watch it again in the future.,1381104000,2,329,4.655172413793103
4359497,5,B004EPYZQ2,"This was full of nostalgic music, brought me back to the time when my love was for making models. This was a great movie: full of all the unlikely heroes, unlikely villains, and had a great ending for all that the writers intended you to ""get into their character.""",1381104000,,265,4.428571428571429
4359498,4,B004EPYZQ2,"In Super 8, JJ Abrams was successful in re-creating the feelings that were present in ET, as well as several movies from the era: Childlike wonder for the world, camaraderie among friends, and a drive for adventure. He also nailed the ""period piece"" effort, making this seem like a movie that was ripped right from the late 70s/early 80s, with nothing that I could detect that disrupted the illusion. Meticulous details were covered, and the effort was very impressive. As for the plot itself, I thought it was a fantastic homage to monster movies, sci-fi, and the aforementioned ET, which was obviously a huge inspiration for this movie (although this one is far more violent, just to warn you). I also really appreciated how the creature design had subtle homages to both ET and Cloverfield, Abrams' most famous monster. The CGI is top notch (as to be expected from a Bad Robot production) and not overused, and the monster is cleverly revealed only in brief glimpses throughout until the final showdown, much like the brilliantly doled out Cloverfield beastie. This was a great movie that took me back to the days of my childhood, successfully recapturing those feelings that I got when watching movies like Goonies when I was a kid... and it's a great ""alternative"" Halloween movie for these brisk October nights!",1380931200,,1317,4.910313901345291
4359499,4,B004EPYZQ2,"I thought this would be a ""coming of age"" video and although it isn't my usual fare, I thought it was pretty good and worth watching.",1380844800,2,133,4.153846153846154
4359500,4,B004EPYZQ2,"Over all good movie, I would recommend to anyone that enjoys science fiction movies. This one will not disappoint you",1380844800,2,117,4.9
4359601,4,B004EPYZQ2,"Everything comes together in this movie...good writing, good acting, excellent soundtrack, props that look real, and a great Hollywood budget that doesn't hold back.  A group of young teenagers love writing and producing films.  One night while filming with a traintrack in the background, a train coming through town has a horrific accident caused by a high school science teacher who runs into the train with his truck.  The government had a secret cargo on the train which puts everyone in danger, and the kids got it all on film!

This movie has many stories interwoven which keeps it interesting.  You really care about these kids and what happens to them.  There is a great looking ""monster"".  I can't say more without giving away a spoiler.

It's always fun to discover such a well-done movie.  Highly recommend!",1380758400,2,819,4.91970802919708

4359604,3,B004EPYZQ2,"An enjoyable movie for the most part. Definitely kept my interest throughout; I bought into the storyline. The special effects were excellent, and there were a bunch of questions that I kept looking for the answers to.

Three stars ? Several of those questions never got answered, or where answered inadequately, and I felt the ending was rushed and unsatisfying. That happens in almost every sci-fi movie, or so it seems, that I've come to expect it.

Still, worth watching, no question.",1379980800,,488,4.939024390243903

4359607,3,B004EPYZQ2,"Super 8 was predictable, and never really grabbed our attention.  Even my 12 year old, who I thought would really like it, said it was just okay and that he wouldn't watch it again.  A big drawback for me was most of the scenes were in dark settings - at night, in a cave, etc.  That is a real turn off for me.  If you have nothing better available, sure, give it a watch and form your own opinion.  However, I would not say it is a must see movie.  Just my $0.02.",1379635200,,464,3.935483870967742

It was cool overall though and I really like the train crash scene!!",1379462400,,267,4.153846153846154

4359610,5,B004EPYZQ2,"JJ Abrams caught the feeling of the late seventies here.
This time period was personal for me. We were breaking away from what was standard for our society, standing our ground without being out there.
You can see Spielberg's influence in the kids and their relationships.

Perhaps all the special effects and surround sound would have made for a more exciting viewing on a big screen but on my small iPad screen, the experience was just so-so -making the story line and character development much more important, which I thought was lacking.

That said, this movie is a satisfactory way to idle away an hour and suspend your world for an hour.",1378425600,,521,4.531914893617022
4359686,5,B004EPYZQ2,I put off watching this for YEARS because I thought it was a kiddie movie. It wasn't.  It was awesome.  I'm going to watch it again.  I liked the subtle moral back stories too.,1378252800,,176,4.117647058823529

4359781,2,B004EPYZQ2,"I just viewed this on amazon Prime before deciding if I wanted to purchase the Blu-Ray or not.  There is a solid reason why I hate JJ Abrams, and this proves no different.  Plausible and predictable story line, trying to be ""edgy"" in photography when all you really get is a headache and just poor direction.  You would think being he destroyed the STAR TREK franchise, he could at least do some homage to his own written movie...apparently not. Do not waist money purchasing this, if you REALLY want to see it, and yu are a Amazon Prime member view it for free and save yourself the embarrassment of ordering.",1377561600,2,610,4.527272727272727

Although the ending wasn't favorite part, the movie as a whole is wonderful.  Between Spielberg and Abrams, you know you've got a good movie.  The acting talent from the kids in the movie is spot-on.  I seriously think all of these kids have a future in store for them. The storyline itself is something that unfolds quite well and it isn't predictable at all.  It's certainly worth watching whether you pay for it or not, and more than once.

It's not overly sci-fi like I thought it might be, there is a really sweet young love story narrative between the two main characters, and the acting is unbelievable considering their ages. I also feel like I got some insight into Spielberg's childhood, in a way, too, which was really fun and interesting. Would recommend to anyone!",1374537600,,408,4.602739726027397

4360039,5,B004EPYZQ2,"How do you manage to pack a lot of explosions and train crashes into a film about a bunch of middle-schoolers making a zombie flick? Put a dangerous cargo on the train and let the mysteries unfold! Super 8 is a sweetly written film about Joe, a kid who has just lost his mom in an industrial accident. His police officer dad can't relate to him, so he spends lots of time as makeup man on his friends' amateur monster film. Sometimes it's harder to tell which film is more interesting - the fully-formed film about small town loss, young loss, military lies and a terrifying presence, or the choppy, badly-acted (but darling!) film about a bunch of teens trying to become filmmakers.

I'm not sure there's much being said about the intersection of the two stories, except in the way they allow the adults and kids to cross paths and resolve old animosities. Very sweet and very smart. You don't get a good look at the film's mysterious presence until well into the film - a salvation for anyone familiar with the genre. Young and old alike will appreciate the looks at very ""old"" technology - super 8 cameras, the first Walkman (a little head of its time, but playing a cassette tape!) and old-time film projectors with film on reels. Not to mention the Vietnam-era military uniforms and a 3-day (!) wait for film to be developed! But he period stuff is perfectly integrated into the plot.

I went into this movie expecting a good sci-fi/action story, but it is so much more than that.  It's a fairly serious, and well acted, drama.  The most interesting part of the experience is watching a group of very talented young actors pretending to be untalented high school performers.

4360198,4,B004EPYZQ2,"This is an exciting movie and lots of fun to watch.  Steven Spielberg does great movies with kids.  This has the some similarities to ET where the Feds are the aggressive bad guys and the kids save the day.  Spielberg always has his young actors swearing, and this is no exception.  One of the adults gets high on pot and uses the ""F"" word, which was only used once but totally unnecessary.  I really wish he wouldn't do that but I guess it is his signature.  I don't use that language, so I do find it offensive.  Overall, a fun movie, but watch out for the kids swearing off and on if you find that stuff not up to your standards.",1372982400,2,632,4.1735537190082646

Abrams and Spielberg's retentive commitment to detail nearly brought tears to my eyes; the RELEVANCE of every element, the nuance, wow... just WOW.  Its SciFi element dragged me into the theater to watch this film, everything else kept me riveted and hoping it would run hours longer than its 112 minutes.
This was a major sleeper flim:  I only went to see it because I was out of town and couldn't sleep... I walked out of the theater just blown away.  The last time that happened was in the 1980's: After bailing out of a movie we paid to see (Working Girl; it was terrible!) and ducking into another theater to see a then little known flick named Die Hard...

I highly recommend this flick..on a LARGE screen, with a great sound system...especially appropriate to those having grown up in the 70's... in Middle America...

So decided to try Netflix and Amazon streaming head to head to see how they compare.  Playback was through the streaming functionality of my Panasonic Blu-ray player.  Neither had the video quality of the Blu-ray but Amazon was closest in that regard, and the video quality was generally very good.  Netflix video was a bit of letdown, lots of video degradation (macro blocking) during high motion scenes which is usually a sign of poor encoding management.  The audio on Amazon however turned out to be the big let down, wasn't even multi-channel, just simple stereo.  The audio on Netflix wasn't bad and at least was 5.1 although with not the same dynamic range and quality that I heard on the Blu-ray.

Streaming is getting better, but still a tough sell for those that like quality.",1372204800,,1033,4.896551724137931

The screen is very dark throughout most of the movie, making it hard to see unless you are in a pitch-dark room while watching it.  The main characters in the movie, from my recollection, don't ever really do much to influence the outcome of the movie except in a fairly contrived way. They basically just serve as ""witnesses"" with their video camera while trying to avoid getting hurt/killed or avoid getting in trouble with the adults in the movie, and grow personally as part of the process.",1371686400,,591,4.673076923076923

4360731,5,B004EPYZQ2,"This movie came as described. Any lover of Steven Speilberg will love this movie!

The plot was a bit predictable, but the character development and subplots made it a movie that can be watched several times. The bonus features were high quality and not like the low quality ones too many movies are doing nowadays.

The actors were mostly inexperienced, but in a way, it contributed to the movie (they are making a movie within the movie, and I felt their lack of major experience made it seem more real).

Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and urge anyone who has not done so to watch it.",1369440000,,597,4.5607476635514015

The kids were cute, a bit angsty and the tale of young love and loss was good.  Some of the action scenes were a bit odd as some things would get hurt or die while others would come out unscathed.  Of course if you cant suspend belief for that to hold up then it might be the wrong movie for you.  Easy barometer for testing this movie, did you like the Crystal Skull story of Indian Jones?  If so you will love this one, if not, save a few bucks and catch something else.",1369008000,2,686,3.9420289855072466

4360880,5,B004EPYZQ2,"Wow! I'm a huge J.J. Abrams buff. I love almost everything he's made: Fringe, Star Trek, etc.. This is no exception! It's a bit corny, a bit tongue-in-cheek, but it sure is a fun ride! Has a bit of something for everyone. I'm surprised by the array of hate for the movie on these reviews, but to each his own. I admit the whole story is rather cliche, but I don't care. It's a good movie. It's exciting. It's fun. Why ruin that? It's tense and thrilling without being horrifying, it's funny and edge-of-your-seat action-packed. If you like alien movies you might be a bit disappointed--you barely see the alien, and the whole thing is rather more about family, childhood adventure, innocence and creativity, love, hate, and human interaction. I admit the ending was a bit less than it could be, but the ride up to it was well worth it! J.J. Abrams is notorious, it seems to me, for being fantastic at supplying enough creepy, mysterious events and curious things to keep a whole army of sci-fi/fantasy/thriller/horror/etc. buffs aroused for months on end, but he frequently has trouble, in my opinion, at supplying satisfying endings/answers to all of his mysteries. This movie is, as I already said, no exception. If you're like me, however, and find the ride to be why you came, you are in for a good one! Loved it. Plan on buying it eventually. Didn't know at all what to expect and it blew me away!",1368576000,,1402,4.612
4360881,3,B004EPYZQ2,"If you like to be emotionally manipulated with special effects, then you will love this film. It's E.T. on steroids.",1368576000,,116,4.85
4360882,5,B004EPYZQ2,"I'm biased. Those kids were me. I made Super 8 movies, built models, had crushes and loved fireworks. And I'm a huge fan of huge monsters. Super 8 is a blast and, for me, stands up to multiple viewings. Good Saturday kick-back stuff!",1368576000,,233,4.441860465116279
4360883,5,B004EPYZQ2,"What I like the most about this movie is the cast.  The story although unusual and does a great deal, but it is the cast that brings it to life and makes us care about them and their fate.  Any of us can imagine a year when we got together with friends for an event.  In this case they are trying to make a movie, but they could have easily been going on a night out, a picnic, a party or some other event.  All that is required is someone be using a video camera at the time to record the events.  In this case a train wreck is filmed.  Not the first time I'm sure a train wreck was filmed, and once again it could have been a truck or plane crash as well.  Then we have the typical government cover up, we have seen that many times.  In this case it takes awhile for the government to figure out a group of students filmed the event and caught sight of the creature that was being transported.  Good action thriller.  I recommend you at least rent it.  This is better than several others like this.  Good rewatchability.

The sets are *exceptional*... Oscar worthy research and attention to detail are poured into the interiors, making 1979 thunder in your eyes.

I enjoyed the story in this film. It has a sense of mystery and discovery, while mixing humor and adventure to create a great SciFi adventure. The action sequences are extremely well done, and the humor is genuinely funny and mostly clean. It looks like a J. J. Abrams film, but plays like Spielberg. The storytelling is simple and straightforward, so anyone can watch and enjoy it. The acting was great from the cast, and the music was phenomenal. The attempts at nostalgia may be too formulaic for some viewers; so, if you've been watching the classics similar to this, you should wait a bit before watching Super 8.

Overall, Super 8 is an entertaining SciFi film with a nostalgic story, amazing visual effects, and superb music. As of 3/30/13, this film is available on Amazon Prime Instant Video and Netflix Streaming; a purchase is recommended for fans of the genre, a rental otherwise.

Its a movie within a movie where one of the boys is creating a student film for a competition with his friends when they witness & accidentally film a very controversial train wreck.
While trying to film this adventure over a summer there is fireworks [literally the pyro kid is just obnoxious], first love, tragic  family lose [which personally I never felt was dealt with] alcoholism, neglect and of course military hazmat, swat personnel invading their town. Overall there is much that this movie takes on I just felt that the ending was a bit contrived and not more than a bit saccharin & unsatisfying thus it gets  a four instead of 5.",1367020800,,813,4.638888888888889

Abrams' omage to films like the Goonies.  Personally, I think he did a good job.  I liked this film just as much as the Goonies.  The characters were mostly likable and funny (mainly the kids).  The plot is interesting.  There is this feeling of mystery and adventure, like the Goonies had.

There were some minor problems.  Many of the adult chracters I did not care for.  The design of the alien was not that great.  Plus there was one thing that happened in the movie that made absolutely no sense.

4361099,4,B004EPYZQ2,"Where to begin this review without spoiling anything?  The movie opens in a small town in Ohio in 1979 with a boy sitting on a swing; he holds a necklace from his hand.  It is winter and there is a gathering at the house adjacent.  Shortly the audience learns that the funeral of this boy's mother.  Joe Lamb's, the boy played by Joel Courtney, mother died in an accident at the mill.
The opening scenes are slow and mildly painful as director JJ Abrams' films usually start at a faster pace, however, this choice allows the audience to connect with the characters like Joe or his father, Jackson Lamb played by Kyle Chandler.  It even allows for the audience to meet all of the characters but one.
The main section of the story takes place later when the boys begin to shoot their zombie film.  One scene requires them to drive out to a train depot where they enlist the help of the film's lead and underage actress to drive them.  Alice Dainard's, played by Elle Fanning, father is responsible for the accident that killed Joe's mother and naturally leads to confrontation between her father and Joe's.
It is at the train depot that a pickup truck drives onto the tracks and derails a locomotive that the action, special effects, and the already stored emotions for the characters come through to the audience.  Of course there is something inside one of the cars that escapes, the Air Force is dispatched to cover it up and strange things start happening throughout the town.  But all of the finer details will be left spoiler free.
Abrams does a brilliant job of getting that small town America feel throughout the film.  But his true achievement is attaching the audience to each unique character.  None of the characters step on each other's archetype and they all have their own reasons for being there.  When the situation really starts the hit the fan, the audience has a feels for the characters and the events surrounding them.
It should be noted that Elle Fanning's performance is one that is difficult to come by.  Her onscreen presence captivates and is immediately endeared.  She sells every bit of her act.  Even the film within the film is masterfully executed by Fanning.  If she is not nominated for this film, she most certainly will be in the future.
This movie should have been reviewed weeks ago.  Upon the initial viewing it was a 5 out of 5, now it is a solid 4.5 out of 5.  The reason behind the reduction is not a reflection on the greatness of Super 8.  As demonstrated from the glowing review above, it is a great movie.  It is just that all other movies this year (or honestly since Inception) have not stimulated the mind in the way that Super 8 does.  The movie is Abrams' best film and a testament to the early days of Spielberg (producer).",1366588800,2,2773,4.561616161616161

It might freak my nine-year old out.  I felt at the edge of my seat a few times, which was great, but the ending could have been a bit better.

Also I hate alien, moster,..etc movies that never show you the monster.

Kyle Chander's character was totally irrelevant to all that went on, as was the alien, who gave the word junkyard a whole new meaning. But I have never been a fan of Spielberg.

ET: a group of kids find the first extraterrestrial to visit earth, and, rather than trying to learn something about it, simply play with it.
Close Encounters of the Third Kind: more extraterrestrials come to earth, who, despite all of their advanced technology, can only communicate through five notes of music. And, it seems, they've been abducting humans for centuries. Anal probes anyone?
Jaws: what started out with one of the most horrific scenes in film history, quickly degenerates into a near comedy.
The Color Purple: the movie was okay, but the end result was the creation of a billionaire called Oprah, whose mere words have influenced the shape of the planet.

4361307,4,B004EPYZQ2,"Super 8 (J. J. Abrams, 2011)

I'm having some problems figuring out what to say about Super 8, which I watched yesterday and enjoyed a great deal. I think much of the reason for this is that I'm not exactly sure what type of movie it is. On the other hand, it knows exactly what type of movie it is, which leads me to an inversion of my usual problem reviewing certain films. It's part monster movie, following closely on Abrams' success with Cloverfield. It's part homage to 1979, an historical piece that aims to capture an era (and does so almost perfectly as far as the atmosphere goes, and I say this as someone who was just a year or so younger than the principals in the film in 1979). It's part coming-of-age rom-com, and this is probably the movie's strongest facet, as it takes a well-worn plotline, social outcast 1 ropes hot girl into working with his crew in order to seduce her, opening the way for social outcast 2 and hot girl into falling in love, destroying his plan--and gives it new feet. And somehow, despite any number of anachronisms that don't make sense in a movie that supposedly takes place in 1979, Abrams makes it all work.

Plot: in a small town in Ohio, a bunch of teenaged kids are trying to make a zombie movie. Director Charles Kaznyk (Riley Griffiths in his screen debut) has a major crush on school hottie Alice Dainard (Because of Winn-Dixie's Elle Fanning), and so reworks the script to give his lead actor, Martin (Alabama Moon's Gabriel Basso), a wife, and asks Alice to be in the film; she agrees. Of course, the entire cast and crew of the movie are equally hot for Alice, including make-up artist and model-builder Joe Lamb (The Between's Joel Courtney), the son of a local deputy. Unfortunately, Joe's father has an unpleasant history with Alice's father Louis (ER's Ron Eldard), which complicates things when the two find themselves getting entangled. While the crew are shooting a pivotal scene at the local train station, they witness--and unintentionally film--a truck, driven by local biology teacher Dr. Woodward (John Dies at the End's Glynn Turman), driving onto the tracks and into the path of an oncoming train, causing the worst derailment in Ohio history. When the authorities arrive to clean it up, they turn out to be military types, led by sadistic tinpot dictator Nelec (Warrior's Noah Emmerich), who immediately crosses paths, and hackles, with Deputy Lamb, who is elevated to acting Sheriff when his boss, Sheriff Pruitt (Edward Scissorhands' Brett Rice), disappears under mysterious circumstances.

Honestly, this is just the tip of the iceberg. Much has been made of the fact that this is not only a love letter to 1979, but is also a love letter to a number of eighties films (notably E.T. and The Goonies), as well as closely mirroring Abrams' own Cloverfield. This is true. And if that bothers you, so be it. I didn't have a problem with it at all; better an homage than yet another Hollywood remake, as far as I'm concerned. Especially when that homage is as well-shot and well-acted as this one is.

Much has also been made of the movie's many anachronisms--the two most obvious being mentions of Rubik's Cubes and Walkmen, neither of which was available in America until 1980. Yes, these things jar, and yes, I did shave off a bit of star for them, but the way I see it, this is Abrams' love letter to the time period, rather than something he exhaustively researched, and he wrote it how he remembered it. Should he have gone back and checked that all his cultural references actually made sense given the setting, or maybe changed the year to 1981? Yeah, he probably should have. Am I going to say ""this movie is crap and you shouldn't watch it"" because he didn't, as some of the more vociferous critics on the IMDB boards have? Of course not. That would be like saying ""you shouldn't see The Serpent and the Rainbow because Zakes Mokae is from South Africa, not Haiti."" Ridiculous.

You may have to be of a certain age to get the most out of this movie, but as far as I'm concerned, just go with it and you'll have a very good time. *** ",1364428800,,4110,4.623287671232877

4361417,4,B004EPYZQ2,"I would recommend this movie to almost anyone.  The easiest way to describe this movie is like a cynic's version of ""Close Encounters"" with a pinch of ""The Goonies"" thrown in for flavor.  For a movie that tries to combine emotional scenes with some great action set-pieces, Super 8 succeeds.  It's a big-budget blockbuster with a happy ending, but it's at least my opinion that this movie is one of the best of its kind.

The story is interesting, even if you change the channel when all of those 'true UFO stories' shows are on.  Sure, stories of aliens, government conspiracies, and small towns helplessly caught in larger problems are nothing new, but telling the story with a cast of younger actors puts a different perspective on this type of sci-fi.  The acting is great.  It seems like those responsible for casting took their time to find actors both young and old who really make every scene shine. It's not just padding between action sequences.  The action and special effects are great.  Real-world and digital effects mix well in this movie, and both complement the other instead of looking fake or helplessly cheesy.

This movie may be more mature than it appears on the surface.  If you're a parent, there is cursing, violence, and the alien in the film is pretty creepy for most of the film.  Despite appearing this way you eventually learn that much of the alien's behavior has to do with the manner in which he/she/it was treated- unlike some of the worst sci-fi at least there's a reason for things being the way that they are.  Those with children that are young and/or easily scared may want to look elsewhere.  Be warned, this is one of those movies that's going to try and tug at your heart-strings.  If you dislike films that aim for the 'Spielberg' ending this one is most certainly not for you (kind of hard to avoid since he was the producer after all).

Granted, this movie didn't re-invent the wheel as far as movie making or story writing is concerned, but it is highly entertaining.  The first time I saw it I had to resist the urge to watch it again immediately.  Very few movies do that to me.",1363392000,4,2126,4.594164456233422

One reviewer said that the alien wasn't done well and that he was supposed to be sympathetic but failed. I respectfully disagree. He was doing what he had to do to get home. The army made him into a scared killing machine. He liked the teacher but on the whole thought that humanity was as violent and callous. I find that situation very sympathetic. It wasn't until he (SPOILER:) picked up the kid that he realized that there are good humans out there driven by love. That's how I took it anyway. (End of spoiler)

4361603,4,B004EPYZQ2,"Castaways, alien invasion, and paranormal phenomenon are nothing new, but when they are re-imagined by J.J. Abrams, they sure seem that way. Like king midis, everything Abrams touches is pure gold and Super 8 is no exception. On the surface, the film seems like something you've seen a million times before, but it's Abrams twist, turns, and imagination that make it very different. What I loved about this film, was that it's a blockbuster film, with two major names behind it, and there wasn't any big stars attached to it. In fact, most of the cast never had a major role in anything, like the lead, Joel Courtney. I don't know how they found this kid. He had zero professional experience and he was really fantastic. This movie is a gem, and while it seems like it's been done, you've never seen it done J.J. Abrams way. Super 8 is an evolved version of many similar films behind it and is one that they will talking about for years.",1361491200,,937,4.550295857988166
4361643,3,B004EPYZQ2,"Going in I did not know that this film was a science fiction picture, so that was an interesting surprise.  I also did not know that there would be a lot of nostalgic and coming-of-age-teen themes.  Again, a not unwelcome surprise for someone that lists American Graffiti and Dazed and Confused as favorites.  There was plenty to like about Super 8.

Taking place in the late 1970s, the world we notice in the movie incorporates longish hairstyles, classic muscle cars, Coca Cola in bottles, and simpler times for youngsters.  Kids actually played back then.  They had adventures, got together to be creative, and had fun in real-time.  There was no Internet or text messaging to distance relationships.  The somewhat dorky and outcast group of friends in this film are into cinema and making their own ultra-low budget zombie flick.  The dialogue, plot, and ""production value"" of their project is simplistic and childish.  However, I could appreciate and recall the low level of sophistication that one has as a junior high student.  It was authentic and reminded me of my own efforts at being creative as an adolescent.  Every small-town kid with an artistic streak should be able to relate to this aspect of Super 8.

With teen nostalgia, naturally, comes a love story.  It is not overpowering stuff or a main focus of the plot, but more of a cute and sugar sweet distraction.  Again, Super 8 hits the right notes to make you remember a far-off time when having a crush was a big deal.  It could make your summer.

But what makes the season for the group of friends here is a mysterious train derailment and an even more suspicious clean-up effort by the United States Air Force.  The movie grabs you by the collar and takes an unusual turn after the crash.  I was not sure what was coming next.  Gory horror sequence?  Black hole opened to a parallel universe?  Government conspiracy?  A mishmash of all of those possibilities?  What comes out of the crash is revealed slowly and carefully, and with great storytelling skill.  Super 8 has style that is graceful, witty, never clumsy, and well-executed to keep you focused and interested.  There is even some light humor to break up the question marks.  Remember that this is a science fiction film, and you will suspend your disbelief and enjoy the fantastic story and classic feel of the way we move through it.  Otherwise, you might be disappointed at how improbable (impossible?) the reality of Super 8 turns out.

I enjoyed the suspense, surprises, and explosions here more than the theme of loss that permeates the protagonist's psyche and closes the circle at the end of the film.  I felt the resolution was a little forced and cheesy.  But, one forced element of an otherwise entertaining, well-conceived, and well-executed film is forgivable.  Give Super 8 a run, and you will not be disappointed.",1361491200,,2859,4.806981519507187

I watched it free streaming with Amazon Prime and I'm glad I didn't pay to see it.  It's basically a ""kids save the world"" summer type movie best saved for when you don't want to have to invest anything (intellectually or emotionally) when you sit down to watch, or perhaps just have it playing in the background when you're doing something else.  I read some other reviews that equated this movie to ET or Goonies and this movie comes nowhere near being as creative, touching, or lasting as those classics. I would never have thought to put them in the same sentence -- pretty much the only similarities are 1) a mistreated extraterrestrial which was captured by the government, or 2) a bunch of kids banding together for a (sort of) quest.

In summary - watching this movie is not a the worst way you could think of to pass a bit of time, but there's nothing really memorable about the movie.  I found it pretty much indistinguishable from any number of similar ""kids save the world"" disaster movies.",1360454400,,1157,4.647058823529412

I've heard complaints about the alien and the CGI quality, but I don't have any qualms there.  Aliens have been shown in so many ways over the years that it's hard for me to expect total originality in creature-creation these days.  Anyway, the heart of the story isn't about the alien, and that's what makes this movie stand out more than most.

4361919,4,B004EPYZQ2,"My wife screamed. I mean, she really screamed. I don't remember one time in over a dozen years when she's actually screamed during a movie. Generally speaking, she just likes to cut the circulation off in whichever of my limbs is closest to her during any suspenseful or scary parts. This time, she screamed. Loud. And ended up half in my lap. From a movie seat, so that was kind of impressive. She made me jump. I don't even remember what it was that caused the reaction, at this point, but she followed it up with 3 or 4 lesser screams throughout Super 8. And she squeezed my left arm off. Yes, it fell onto the floor, and I had to have it reattached. It was pretty gross, though. I mean, have you ever really looked at the... goo... on a movie theater floor? Let me just tell you right now, you don't want your arm laying around in it. Fortunately, because we went to a late showing several weeks post release, the theater wasn't very crowded, so there weren't many witnesses to take care of.

My first reaction to Super 8 was very positive. There's a good story there. An actual story about real people. So here's the warning: there will be spoilers. I want to actually talk about this movie and J. J. Abrams, and I don't want to try to do it while dodging around trying not to give anything away about the movie. Also, despite anything negative I may say about Super 8, let me just reiterate that I thoroughly enjoyed the experience of watching the film. It's easily one of the best stories in a movie I've seen this year. Not the best, but, probably, top 5.

I have very ambivalent feelings about Mr. Abrams. The more removed I am from the experience of sitting in the theater watching Super 8, the more my ambivalence towards Abrams extends over to the movie. See, Abrams has this problem: he likes to hide things behind his back to generate suspense. You remember doing that when you were a kid, right? Or, at least, having it done to you? When you're a kid, it's kind of fun. Trying to ""convince"" someone to show you what he's hiding. It's fun because you know he really does want to show you, so, once you've played the game long enough, he'll give you a peek. Teenagers change this to the ""I've got a secret"" game, but it's really the same thing.

There are two problems with this: 1. the thing is often anti-climactic 2. sometimes, we already know. Oh, actually, there's one other problem: it only works once. It's sort of a cheap trick in story telling because of that, when the suspense is being generated by just holding the secret behind your back. There's no reason to go back and experience it again, because you already know the secret. As opposed to a movie like The Sixth Sense (and I hate using this, because I don't have much respect for what Shyamalan has become. However, you can't deny that this one film was brilliant. Possibly the most brilliant of its genre) where the secret is really in front of you the whole time, you just don't know it because you haven't figured it out. You can watch it over and over again marveling at how you should have figured it out but just didn't.

That was the biggest issue I had with Super 8; I had flashbacks of Cloverfield, which is a movie I just didn't enjoy. I appreciate what Abrams was trying to do (it was a great idea), but the execution was... well, it was just weak. A movie without a plot with the author holding a monster behind his back that he flashes to us for a brief moment at the end and leaves us saying, ""That's it? That was all? Two hours of this just for that?"" He applies this same gimmick to Super 8, and, although he gives us a better view of the critter at the end of the movie, I still felt like I'd been kind of cheated. It was sort of like finding out that all he'd had behind his back the whole time was a frog. There was nothing startling about the alien. It was an alien. Big deal.

Abrams' genius lies in his ideas. He comes up with great concepts. Like Cloverfield. He doesn't have the best execution, though. He lets the idea run away with him instead of harnessing the idea. His Star Trek is a great example of this. He has this problem. He needs to re-boot the Star Trek franchise, but he doesn't want to just do the same thing over again. How could he shake things up? Destroy Vulcan. Go off on a whole new timeline. It was a great idea. But red matter? Seriously? That's the best he could come up with? And some guy sitting around in a space ship for decades just waiting? Yeah, it sounds malevolent and all, but, come on, decades? There's bound to be a point where the boredom sets in. Don't get me wrong, I loved his Star Trek. It's the best Star Trek out there, but, in the end, it's still just Star Trek with things like red matter that make my eyes roll.

He seems to have a follow through issue, too. Like a cat in a field of butterflies. Alias comes to mind. Another great idea. The first season was exceptional. Hooked me and my wife. We watched the whole series based on that first season. Well, the second season was pretty good, too. Somewhere in the third season, though, he got a new idea, Lost, and left Alias to pursue that instead. And Alias was full of the ""what am I hiding behind my back?"" plots. Every season. Oh, and everyone was an enemy spy that they would just suddenly reveal ""by the way, I have a secret."" I haven't watched Lost, but it has sounded like it was much the same. Great concept. It must have been considering how many people flocked to it, but he left it somewhere in there to go do Fringe, which I couldn't watch. I tried. But it was just too Abrams. Oh, and there was Star Trek in there, too, so, really, all you people out there upset about how Lost ended, you can't exactly blame Abrams, because he wasn't there. Other people were responsible for whatever bad stuff happened at the end of the series. Oh, wait. Abrams wasn't there. I guess you can blame him. But, you know, he probably didn't have any idea about how to end it, either, so it probably wouldn't have mattered if he had been there.

Super 8 evokes all of these Abrams issues for me. I can see them all in there. However, 8 has one saving grace: the story is just E.T. With a twist. It's the ""what if the government had found the alien first?"" version. But it's still a story about a boy that has lost a parent and is trying to cope with his loss. By meeting an alien. If only that was an option available to all boys that have lost a parent. Spielberg gave Abrams an assist on the story, so it's not surprising that that's what we're getting. Just with a lot of explosions and guns and eating humans (because that's really the freakiest moment in the movie, the alien casually munching on a human limb like it's eating a chicken leg). It's a strong story, and I could probably watch Super 8 again for the story, although the suspense surrounding the alien won't be there. My wife said she'd watch it again just to see the train crash again. It is spectacular.

Abrams does an excellent job with the setting. It evokes that sense of nostalgia in people my age and older. Those memories of what it was like to be a kid at that time. It's probably the strongest thing about the movie. It's perfect. Kids riding bikes. Models hanging from ceilings. Star Wars posters and comic books. All those things that are gone from mainstream life today. No cell phones. No computers. Cameras that actually use film that has to be developed. In that respect, I'm not sure how the movie plays to younger audiences. I haven't seen anything from that demographic about it, and we didn't take our kids to see it. I'm pretty sure all the explosions would make up for any lack of connection with the world of the movie, though.

There's even a message. Most movies, these days, don't have messages. Or themes. Nothing beyond the good vs evil. Which is fine, but it can go deeper than that. Abrams doesn't want anyone to miss his message, so he states it plainly for the audience. I'm impressed by this. Not in that he did it, but that people have still missed it. I know they have. I've read more reviews about this movie than any movie in a long time, and they all missed it. I would have thought that stating it the way Abrams did was a bit heavy handed, but, evidently, you have to put it right out there for people to even have a hope of them getting it, and, still, people will miss it. It's like communication with teenagers. Maybe that's where he messed up; he didn't state the message at least three times. Having spent many years of my life working with teenagers, I have experience with the ""at least three times"" thing. Most of them will get it after three times, although some still miss out and have to come back and ask ""what did you say?""

At any rate, it's a good message. So good, in fact, that I'm going to quote it. The whole movie, the whole story, leads up to this one line. From the very first frame, he begins setting up the story, with a true plot arc, to lead up to the one line of the movie that will sum everything up. However, I don't think it will spoil anything to know it ahead of time, because this particular aspect of the movie is about the journey. The journey of a father and a son trying to figure out how to connect with each other after the loss of the wife and mother. It's a touching journey and more grounded in reality than E. T., since the relationship in E.T. is the relationship with the alien. Who, then, leaves. Like Eliot's father left. This time, though, the boy is left with his father and the knowledge, ""Bad things happen. Bad things happen, but you can still live.""",1357344000,,9606,4.325749167591565

The ""mystery"" element is one of the best elements of Super 8. So often today, movies just don't have this important plot design element and everything is spoon fed to you like your some kind of baby who can't follow a story. This actually did and successfully captured my imagination. The plot was solid and the characters were well acted and well fleshed out and actually explored.

The Presentation: I quite liked the filming style, the picture and color rendition are gorgeous with very authentic special effects and the sound was amazing (a great movie to show off your theater with and impress your friends :). I normally prefer DTS HD Master, but this Dolby True HD track was done very well.

Last but not least, the best part of Super 8? It's actually ok to watch with your family (not really young kids mind you). I know that's shocking to say with the crap snuck into movies now-a-days but Super 8 is pretty clean.

The movie was set in 1979 when ""Alien"" was released and the child characters are shooting the zombie film for Super 8 film festival. The drama starts off with teens making a film but when they encounter the strange train derailment scene they are drawn into the military situation, sort of X-files or Taken plot that what the train cargos were carrying was actually an alien. The accident was dealt beautifully just like seeing Hayao Miyazaki animation film in live action. Since then so much sci-fi cliches go on and on. But despite of similarities to previous hit films I love this movie overall. It has heartfelt drama the feel of E.T in it. Elle Fanning,the sister of great child actress Dakota Fanning, made a striking presence as the heroin of the film Alice Dainard.

4362180,4,B004EPYZQ2,"I'm not reviewing the disc and packaging itself as much as I am reviewing the movie. The packaging is pretty standard - Blu-ray quality is good, Digital Copy is good, love that it comes with a DVD as well. I'm not crazy about the cover art they chose for the Blu-ray release - the actual poster was much better that this cover. Now about the movie:

'Super 8' is very likable and very stable for a ""monster"" movie. It's so stable and such a throwback to the classic Sci-Fi movie feel that it may strike a contemporary audience as being a bit boring. I am very impressed with the child actors - they all do an excellent job, arguably much better than the child actors did in the films of the 1970s and 1980s, of which Spielberg of course pulls a lot of influence for this film from.
The most jarring thing about the film for me is the obvious visual queues for each director - Spielberg's fingerprints are all over the characters and J.J. Abrams' fingerprints are all over most of the action cinematography. If you know these filmmaker's work, you will find very obvious evidence of both here.
All-in-all, I say 'Super 8' is a good movie. Not great, but very enjoyable. It's fun but not overly so. It's thoughtful but not a tearjerker. There is an element of mystery here, and sadly it's not more pronounced. I would have preferred more of the 'Cloverfield'-type mystery surrounding the ""creature"", but instead it's not built up enough. It feels like we're about to get an 'E.T.' moment and then we end up with a somewhat harried ending that leaves the movie feeling flat. However, that's not really a huge complaint since the rest of the film is so much fun. If you have a choice, drive out to the middle of nowhere and watch this in your car. It'll make it feel like a good old-time drive-in flick.",1353974400,2,1799,4.468085106382978

The characters are real, and you find yourself really caring what happens to them. The actors are increible, especially the children!!! I can't emphasize that  enough! I highly recommend this movie.

4362225,4,B004EPYZQ2,"Man, if only some people with more vision and ability directed and produced films like this to fruition. It had a lot of promise and is surely not a bad film at all, but it could have been a masterpiece with a more subtle approach. As is I still highly recommend it for kids and adults.

The romantic interest of the two teens and the schism between the two families was very interesting. The locations, oh wow, were just fantastic and just gave it that really cool retro childhood vibe. The whole thing was coming together nicely and I thought hey how did I miss this.... And then they start showing too much of the monster. And then the girl gets in trouble. And then it just kind of turns into a weird monster battle but I guess.... It could have been something a lot less modern and in your face and it could have rode that special train of subtlety in film to something far greater.

I don't think the monster needed to be so big and nor do I think it needed to destroy half the town. It could have been something smaller and more realistic. The cubes making up the ship and the thing just wanting to go home was a nice touch, but I think it all went a little too far by the end and turned into a typical monster movie. Anyway, it is a pretty good film and should entertain the kids and family for a bit. A little too much of that schmaltz again from Spielberg but all in all I enjoyed my time with it.",1353283200,,1407,4.1501831501831505

I don't know what the reason is, but whenever a story revolves around kids placed into adult situations, the movie is always so much better than watching adults in those same situations.

I didn't have high expectations for this movie, but it has it all: love, loss, friendship, military (and military corruption), parent/child relationships (most dysfunctional), it's a blast from the past (set in the late 1970s), and, yes folks, even an alien.

Have found that this is not a good way to select movies - too many losers such as this one (also '1941,' 'War Horse,' and War of the Worlds'). A '60 Minutes' interview with Spielberg suggested the reason - turns out Spielberg had problems in his relationship with his father, and was overly caring for his mother (had left his father for another man).

Regardless, the 'plot' here involved a group of friends making a super 8 movie who witness a train crash while filming at night. Inexplicable events begin to take place in town (dogs and people disappear), their biology teacher is somehow involved, and the Air Force imposes an informal martial law control.

4362289,5,B004EPYZQ2,"A Five Star movie.  Absolutely - however I will be the first to acknowledge that this has it's own unique niche audience, and won't be for everyone.  This is a love letter to the movies of the late 70's and 80's, the movie of Zemeckis, Dante and yes, most of all Spielberg.  For in this feature J.J. Abrams has created a love letter to Spielberg's era of moviemaking, a movie that both celebrates and emulates the styles and tools, the moviemaking grammar, and particularly the tone of movies from that era.
It's all that, but still wrapped in a story, one that has a set of familiar elements, but wrapped up in a new enough arrangement.  A bunch of kids in 1979 bond while making home movies with their Super 8 camera.  They are filming one night when they witness a terrible train crash.. but when the dust settles, there is something from the cargo of the train that has been released, and it is about to have a major impact on the town.  Scratch beneath that relatively simple skin though, and you'll find elements of the Goonies (bunch of kids coming of age through shared adventure), Close Encounters (paranoia, alien contact affecting ordinary small town folk), Gremlins (the black humour), and E.T. (adolescents coming of age in damaged families). And if this is an homage to Spielberg, then it's earlier Spielberg - the guns, deaths and occasional mild swear words aren't airbrushed out. It is very much a story first and foremost about real kids, living real lifes, and much less about the fantastic events happening around them.  Yes there is spectacle towards the end, but only as a pay off to the emotional journey of the characters.. if it's just the action or effects you want, you will likely be disappointed.  In fact, if there is any off note in the movie, it is the appearance of cgi - a very modern tool to tell an old fashioned story, and taking you out of the nostalgia trip somewhat. But it's not enough to derail the journey.
It's not just the director; the look, the feel of the movie, down through sets, period detail and even the musical score, also celebrate that early 80's feel.  And let's not forget those lead roles - kids who actually come across as real, likeable, believable - the scenes where they have to emote, particularly Elle Fanning, are amazingly genuine, and the relationship between the leads is handled in a delicate way which uses visuals and acting more than it does clunky exposition or awkward dialogue.
So yes, it is my own personal 5 stars.. Maybe it's too nostalgic to appeal to today's kids, maybe its too much about kids to appeal to today's adults.  But for me, I am just at that age that when I was young and impressionable it was Spielberg and Dante and the rest that stirred my own passion for movies, that made that first mark, that created those moments that would be my first love of cinema.. and it is precisely that feeling that has been captured and celebrated here.  This is what happens when movies about kids are made by mature filmmakers.  Watching it, I felt like that young wide eyed kid in the cinema again, and it was a glorious feeling.",1350691200,,3110,4.573741007194244

4362291,3,B004EPYZQ2,"I haven't been particularly wound up in the films of Spielberg.  ""Jaws"" was fantastic.  He often repeats himself a bit too closely and when another director follows his lead, the results could be disastrous.  This film wasn't as bad as some people have been led to think.  They're married to the style and overly involved in a type of movie that by now leads to repetition and cliche.  For those of us not buried in this genre, the film has its good points.
The kids played their parts quite well, for the main part.  The girl was outstanding.
The last shots near the end of the film made the kids look ten years older and that didn't work out at all.  The music was strictly by the numbers but it's exhilirating
to hear a full orchestra.  There were no real themes or development.  I personally stopped caring about the monster somewhere midway in the film.
The situation and the drama are aimed directly at the audience, as if, somehow, somebody had rated each scene according to saleability and then strung them together.
The tricks have been done before in other films but then again so have the Sherlock Holmes films or the Thin Man series, or Star Trek...The list is enormous.  There's nothing inherently bad in repeating success.  Hollywood has been doing it for over a hundred years.  When the repetition is ham-fisted, though, it does become quite annoying and this was ham-fisted all right.  However the film does fly by, there are no ""dead"" moments until the saccharine ending which aims at the heartstrings but reaches the bile of the viewer instead.  Anyone could have organized a more efficient ending. I did enjoy most of the film, though, and the production values helped it out in a big way.

Also, typically not a fan of watching things blow up but this had really believable effects, in my opinion, sparing me the stupid godawful computer animation so common today...

If you can't see that simple fact, then you have my sympathy for having blunt perceptions and an apologist mentality.

A good film is a good film - period. There isn't a golf handicap for movies; a special pass for marginal, ineffective or failure.

There are numerous fantastic productions that are specifically geared toward children that are simultaneously amazing films. Think about it for a second.

And consider budget conscious or sublime productions which sacrifice nothing when it comes to quality storytelling: '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Sandlot/dp/B004K00NN0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Sandlot</a>', '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hope-and-Glory/dp/B00005AUJS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hope and Glory</a>', '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Red-Balloon/dp/B0012Z361M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Red Balloon</a>', etc.

Again, funding isn't the issue. Quality in filmmaking is the key discussion every...single...time.

So this question/challenge isn't about my adult perceptions. It's whether or not a film is a winner, middling, or just bites. It's not a fault for pointing out that&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Emperor-Has-No-Clothes/dp/B008XBCJ34/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Emperor Has No Clothes</a>. Why attack the messenger?

This amazing and completely engaging film is a perfect example of quality with no discounts for being geared toward younger audiences. Just a flat out enjoyable, fully constructed, and deftly performed production that just happens to be a kid's flick. In the vein of 'E.T.', a movie whose magic of storytelling, childhood adventure and personal sacrifice will hopefully embed itself deep into the hearts of youths everywhere. A hopeful prediction: Thirty years from now and all those new middle-agers will fondly reminisce about Super 8 and how it affected their lives, changed it even. Very much like Star Wars did for many of my generation. Well, a hope anyway.

The story opens with a gang of misfit teens and the tragic circumstances that begins a summer that no one will ever forget.

It's 1979 and the small town of Lillian, Ohio is about to undergo an unimaginable trauma. Joseph Lamb is one of a quirky group of kids whose big dream is to win an amateur movie contest. But their innocent days end suddenly with the death of Joe's mother at the steel foundry. Now an only child, along with his devastated deputy sheriff father, they struggle to go on without the heart of their lives.

Still, as kids will do, they try to forget. Not with malice, but because we all know that children are children for a reason. For them, life goes on. And Joe finds comfort helping his friends with the film project. So it comes as a double shock when he learns that his buddy, the conspicuously boisterous director, has finally found a girl to play the co-starring role in their zombie flick. Shocking, not only because he found a girl, by itself a noteworthy miracle. But because of who she is, or rather, who her father is in relation to Joe himself. He's the man indirectly responsible for his mother's death.

But young Joe is insightful enough to understand that Alice wasn't at fault and smartly holds no ill feelings. That she's also the most beautiful girl in school also softens the surprise. So, newly installed as the lone female to the troupe of goofy buds, the gang rolls on, both literally and figuratively as the film becomes their summer adventure. Guerrilla moviemaking, using standing sets without permission, is pretty common for young directors and the gang is no different, taking advantage when and where they can - including an opportunity to film one night at the rail station. But it will be a night like no other.

Collectively, they nearly all get killed in the process of accidentally capturing the spectacular train crash near the town limits. Having been so close to the explosive wreck, they're amazed to be alive. They're even more stunned to realize that someone intentionally crashed the millions of pounds of rolling steel stock. Bizarrely - it's someone they know - their school science teacher. And he's still alive.

Soon the local authorities like Joe's dad are quickly supplanted by the military. And camouflaged US Air Force personnel carrying assault weapons and various strange gear appear on the scene.

Something is terribly wrong.

Things quickly spiral as more and more odd events begin to occur. All their dogs go missing. The power grid fluctuates with no explanation. Miles of transmission lines and microwave ovens disappear; even entire car engines are torn out of the bodies of vehicles. Worse yet, there are reports of people who have just vanished. As the town begins to realize these events can't be easily explained away - panic sets in.

Yikes.

An incredible film - period.

Movie Note:

- When anyone challenges me to explain great acting - this is now the film I reference. The train sequence, as young Ellie Fanning switches 'on' her character. That is *exactly* what it means to be an actor.

Personal Notes:

- This was a reward for my hard work. I literally spent a solid year completely avoiding any review, comment or notation regarding this film. Trust me, in this Information Existence, this was no easy task. Quickly clicking off pages or even shutting down browsers to avoid the unavoidable pop-ups and hot links; changing the channel or muting whenever a story or advert hit the screen. For me, a serious endeavor that ate up a good portion of daily mental energy. So that when it finally came time - this was as fresh and clean as the driven snow. Had absolutely no idea what the film was about, who it starred, or even what theme the film could be categorized in. Pure ignorant bliss. (a more appropriate term would've been 'flick virgin' - but that somehow seemed vulgar) <g>

The bottom line is that it was it's own movie and a pretty good one. While it didn't have the most original plot line it did have a few new wrinkles and it did make you care about the characters, that's important. No really big name actors but they all did a good job. I'm looking forward to seeing more of Elle Fanning, She was terrific! I won't go into all the details, you can read that in the other reviews.

4362466,1,B004EPYZQ2,"I have to begin by confessing that Spielberg movies, with the exception of Empire of the Sun, have always bored me. If ever a director typified the standard lazy Hollywood churn-out-the-schlock mentality it's Spielberg. This movie - which I was asked to watch by a friend who likes sci-fi - actually hits a low spot because pretty much every aspect is flat. The camera work is tiresome and unimaginative, the script could have been written by a write-a-cliche computer program, the acting is one-dimensional, there is no plot, and the special effects are frankly unintentionally funny but always boring and telegraphed hours in advance. Likewise the soundtrack is... well, let's just say, this movie definitely would be better with the volume set to zero.

In addition to being a tiresome hack job in which everyone dials in their contribution from long-distance, it's a sci-fi movie with no science and no fiction. There's basically not much of a plot (""hey, what if there's this weird stranded alien and like, the military capture it and torture it, and, like, you know, it escapes and starts killing people..."") and the fact the ""monster"" is  putatively an alien is irrelevant - it could just as easily be a giant poltergeist or a land-capable shark.

As always, Spielberg throws in tons of faux sentimentality (young teens rediscovering the importance of fathers... sigh....) and close-up shots than serve only to reveal that no one in this flaccid production can act.

But all is not lost. If you are one of the many people out there who have difficulty falling asleep at the end of a stressful day, this is definitely the movie for you. It is so dreadful, so tedious, such an absolute waste of time and money that you'll be sound asleep within twenty minutes of the opening sequence. And for that contribution to somnolence everywhere this movie deserves the one star rating I've given it.",1347667200,17,1895,4.894080996884735

Like so many movies today, instead of developing the characters and focusing on a good storyline the film relies heavily on special effects. In doing so the film loses its heart. We have plenty of Transformer type movies, it would have been nice to see this movie differentiate itself. Also, what happened to the professor in the end....?",1347667200,,472,4.564705882352941

Others have complained about the long, overly dark sequence and I would like to hurl that charge again with some English on it. About ten minutes of squinting at the screen and I no longer cared the slightest bit what was going on, having given up in exasperation. Toward the end of that sequence, the movie segues into its cliched Spielbergian ending. One minute you're watching Alien and the next it's E.T.

This movie is rated PG-13, which surprises me, mainly because of the language. Apparently the word sh*t is not a profanity anymore. Just be aware of this if watching this with your kids. Other than that word being used repeatedly, it is completely fine for family movie night.

This movie really reminded me of the Goonies movie from the 1980's, except instead of a pirate theme Super 8 is centered around, well, I don't want to give it away and ruin it. You'll have to go see it for yourself. 5 stars!",1346716800,3,722,4.340740740740741

4362516,5,B004EPYZQ2,"SUPER 8 was many things: a father/son estrangement drama, a puppy-love romance, an ode to the cultish B-movies of the 70s, an ensemble coming-of-age piece, the lot of which flavored with sci-fi seasoning. Above all, I think, this is an homage to the disappearing Creature-Feature genre. J. J. Abrams' alien is beautifully and meticulously rendered in seamless CG. We are permitted the occasional glimpse -- a hand, a leg -- more and more of the unique form offering up pieces of itself as the story progresses. The small tastes continue to tease us until finally, during the last 20 minutes, we are rewarded with an animal quite unlike anything we've seen, or even dared to imagine, before. This is not M. Night's SIGNS, in which the final reveal of the antagonizing extra-terrestrials appears to be little more than a man in green spandex. In SUPER 8, everything from the arrangement of the beastie's limbs to its peculiar form of locomotion are, quite frankly, alien. Kudos to whoever designed it.

Some people have complained about the pace of SUPER 8, but the ""dragging"" plot seems to me like a conscious decision on the part of the director. I believe Abrams intentionally employed that 70s style of movie-making, harkening back to a time before the advent of the MTV quick-cut, (a visual style created either for or by [a chicken/egg dilemma] ADHA sufferers with severely limited attention-spans). This movie is not for Generation Ritalin; I suspect that viewers over the age of 30 will have no problem sitting through the 1 hour 51 minutes.

All of the kid actors are impressive, but Elle Fanning is particularly superb. She has a a characteristic, silent-movie manner, so that more than tears pour from her eyes: the entirety of what Fanning is feeling emanates from them as well. Some other reviewers have criticized the harsh language of our young protagonists, but they are meant to be middle school students and are therefore at that age during which they're desperately trying to broadcast their budding maturity; peppering their speech with expletives is one traditional method -- I remember doing this myself at age 12, cursing like a sailor because I was sure that was how ""real"" adults spoke.

I'd say my only true criticism would concern my disbelief in the ability of a pick-up truck to completely derail a massive, speeding train while sustaining only passenger-side damage and leaving the driver alive. Other than that, SUPER 8 was super great. This movie is what would have happened if E.T. had been captured by government agents and subjected to a decade of torturous experimentation, so that by the time he broke out, the once lovable little extra-terrestrial would have become decidedly less cuddly -- munching on humans like celery sticks as he works away (I won't tell you what he's building, you'll have to watch and discover that for yourself). And even though this premise has been done many times before, it was nonetheless masterfully executed, resulting in a beautiful depiction of a familiar, yet fantastic tale.

4362517,2,B004EPYZQ2,"I went into this movie thinking it was going to be similar to an E.T/Stand by Me type of 80s nostalgia film from the comments I've seen from others.

This movie is just so lackluster with the cliche, underdeveloped characters and the underwhelming big secret that is revealed that left me saying.. is this it? I'm glad i only paid $7.99 for this on blu ray because I'll never watch it again. I think I'll throw it off a bridge and film that, I'll probably get more entertainment out of it.",1346630400,2,585,4.327272727272727
4362518,3,B004EPYZQ2,"I've been watching movies for 60 years, and there's little I haven't seen. For me, an ""old"" movie is a silent film (""Orphans of the Storm"").

Movie makers seem to think that, despite the wide availability of decades of films on home video, they can get away with recycling stuff most viewers have seen. This is the case with ""Super 8"", a rough mash-up of ""ET"", ""CE3K"", and ""Jurassic Park"". Had these films never been made, ""Super 8"" would come off as agreeably original. But when all the viewer can do is think of how much ""Super 8"" reminds him of //other// films, something is wrong.

""Super 8""'s worst problem is that it depends too heavily on coincidence and obvious foreshadowing. When one of the young film makers displays a proclivity for lighting small fireworks, you //know// it's going to come in handy later. And why is it that the train //just happens// to pass near the community where the man who tries to stop it resides?

Spoiler follows.

The obvious question of why the Air Force is moving the alien and his paraphernalia is never answered. A plausible explanation is that they're finally going to let him leave. If so, the events of the film are highly ironic. The ""bad guys"" aren't quite so bad, while the ""good guy"" is the person who incites the tragedy. Had ""Super 8"" included this revelation, I'd probably have given it four stars.

Michael Giacchino's score is a dud. It comes off as watered-down Williams -- which might have been his intent, a subtle slap at the film itself.

In short, ""by the numbers"" movie making. J J Abrams should be ashamed -- and ought to take a refresher course from Robert McKee.

PS: A note to the costume department... In a film with millions of dollars of special effects, the wig for the guy playing the hippie salesman is incomprehensibly awful. The ""part"" in the wig appears to be a part of the wig -- not hair growing out of his scalp. John Wayne had better hairpieces 50+ years ago, and Robert Duvall's ""do"" for ""Lonesome Dove"" is undetectable (other than looking overly neat), even on Blu-ray. That film had a budget that would've barely covered the catering for ""Super 8"".",1346544000,,2132,4.6094986807387865
4362519,4,B004EPYZQ2,"Well, Super 8 isn't a bad movie and it's not amazing either. It's a 3.5 but I'll round up instead of down. The story focuses on a group of Junior Highschool children making a independent film. During the film they get caught in the middle of a disaster and that's where the story begins. Super 8 Mixes The Goonies, with Godzilla (that horrible remake one) and E.T.. If you think that's a strange and unexpected mix well, this movie is just that. It's has it's serious moments (mostly drama) but it has it's lighthearted moments too. The Alien doesn't make its full on screen appearance until later in the film but like Godzilla it can be seen in the shadows running around and tearing up the town. There is action in the movie but in between that action is adolescent drama that results in long drawn out scenes. These scenes just make you wonder what the Alien is doing while the characters on screen are crying out their feelings.

Overall Super 8 is a decent family movie and worth checking out if your board but but just don't expect to blown away by it.",1346457600,3,1058,4.453608247422681
4362520,5,B004EPYZQ2,"This is by far the best film of 2011. It reminded me of movies like close encounters of the third kind, stand by me, and  the goonies. It had a 70's or 80's feel to it; you know back in the golden era of modern cinema that was shaped by the likes of GEORGE LUCAS, FRANCES FORD COPALA and the GOD of a man, the best film maker of all time who produced the film I am critiquing right now, STEVEN SPIELBERG. What more can I say except buy this DVD you won't be disappointed. The sound track by, Michael Giacchino is also great very much in the vain of JOHN WILLIAMS. Giacchino also scored such works as, JJ ABRAMS ""STAR TREK"" and the upcoming ""star trek sequel"", ""the incredible's"", the show ""lost"", ""ratatouille"", ""john carter"" and the video games ""MEDAL OF HONOR"" AND ""MEDAL OF HONOR 2"", One last thing the kids in this could really act I am surprised none of them were up for Oscars especially Elle Fanning, who if you didn't know is Dakota Fanning's little sister.",1346284800,,965,4.331491712707182

4362554,3,B004EPYZQ2,"Super 8(released June/11)gives us the one two punch of Steven Spielberg and Hollywood's flavour of the moment,J.J.Abrams. The hype would certainly lead one to believe this is an instant classic,a truly unforgettable cinematic experience,a movie you will see again and again,et al. Well,if you've been around movies along as I have,the hype becomes just that,alot of words/hot air to inflate something up,that may or may not have a pay day in the end. And the hype today is pretty much the same stuff they've been dishing out since the 20s. Does Super 8 have a long half life?Let's see.
The plot gives us a group of kids who love to make movies. Each character has their own raison d'etre,as Spielberg and company make each a stand out in their own right,translation:makes them like us ordinary folks. One is a wanna be movie director with a weight problem,one loves to play with matches and explosives,one likes to act but can't,one has a cop for a father and whose mother just passed away,and into this mix is thrown a young girl whose father doesn't get along with the aforesaid cop.
One evening finds the group out at a railroad station filming. A train approaches which will make a fine backdrop for their scene,but something startling will happen. One of them notices a pick up come onto the tracks ahead of the train and deliberately run into it. This causes the train to derail,but the train cars start flying through the air like footballs. By now they have abandoned their camera which has fallen sideways onto the platform but continues to film. In the aftermath they look around at the devastation not believing what just happened,let alone the fact they are all still alive. Suddenly the military approach-ith and the kids ski-doo.
The kids have all agreed not to discuss their experience,as the military has the crash scene sewn up. Slowly but surely strange things are a-happening. Dogs,people and equipment are disappearing in the town at an alarming rate,with no apparent explanation. One evening the girl of the group gets snatched up and taken away by a large creature. The boys stumble onto some notes a school professor had accrued over a long period of time,which has a direct bearing on what is happening now. The military interrupts their gathering and takes them all by bus back for interrogation. Along the way the creature attacks and tips the bus over. It kills the military men,but the kids escape.

In the meantime the military has set a deliberate fire which threatens to engulf the entire town. They evacuate its citizens so they can go on the hunt and recapture this alien. It seems they captured it and its' spaceship years before,but the alien has wanted to go home ever since,and now that it is free this is what it intends to do. The remainders of the group drive back to town in an attempt at rescuing the girl,who has been taken down to an underground cavern. Underground,they indeed find the girl and return to the surface. They are just in time to witness the water tower turn into a giant magnet,drawing objects big and small onto it. The creature goes inside the tower,which immediately converts into an alien craft and away he/she/it goes.
Does this film live up to its 'classic' hype?.....not by a million light years. I found this film to be quite a boring time,frankly. The only thing classic about this film are the Spielberg touches,such as the attention to detail in the characterizations I mentioned earlier,getting the experiences of youth/young love,etc.from their perspective,feeling the ultimate empathy for the alien,one man,er boy,standing bravely up to and connecting with said alien,and finally no Spielberg picture would be complete without a resolution of the parent/child conflict at the beginning of the film,at the end,coupled with a tender reunion to enhance it all. Ahhhh. Trouble is,by the time this film wraps up I couldn't have cared less who made up with who or that the creature made it safely away,or any of the touchy feely moments Spielberg tried to engender. And speaking of the wrap up,I was actually surprised the ending,WAS the ending. I was expecting more footage of...I don't know what....anything,I guess. The film also takes its sweet time meandering its way through its somewhat cumbersome plot,introducing us all to its characters and locations which must engender within us that""Oh yeah,I remember that time"",or the old chestnut""Hey Bob,I used to have a house and car just like that"".Yep,that's a Spielberg moment,if ever there was one. Except,this is NOT E.T.,and I mean that in the sense that it doesn't come anywhere close to the quality of that film. And you know while we're on the subject and have Mr Spielberg's attention(he always reads my reviews!),I have just about had it with the portrayal of kids of that age who would NEVER in a million years have talked to each other,let alone their parents,in the fashion they do,without dying a million deaths. He can get the clothes right,the music down pretty good but the precociousness that most of his young characters exhibit,has just got to go,OK Steven?
Technically speaking the film is clear and crisp and in its w/s format. There is commentary and two featurettes on the making of the film.
All in all a HUGE disappointment. I try not to let the hype into my reviews and/or influence me in any way. In fact I find the more I know,the more skeptical I am about what is to come. I get to a point and become a Missourian...""Show Me"".The hype couldn't save this stinker. The pace and the meandering script are way off the beam and all the tricks Spielberg can muster cannot even save the day here. It's another War of the Worlds(2005).Give it a pass. 2 1/2-3 stars.",1345680000,,5706,4.846311475409836
4362555,5,B004EPYZQ2,"I have watched probably 30 movies in the past month or so, and this is the first one that has made me want to review it. There is so much junk these days, so many bad stories, repetitious stories, so much bad acting (mostly bad directing), coming of age movies, or deadly B-rated shark attack movies (the new and ""improved"" syfy channel batters us with some of the worst movies, my husband and I watch them because it's actually entertaining making fun of them), paranormal movies that not only do not scare me, but make me cringe they are so terrible (why does the woman ALWAYS scream????), movies where the theme is about dying, but the character either meets the love of their lives or becomes some sort of hero, movies about today's new and improved families (usually pushing one or several of today's interpretation of family and how wonderful they are - I call them preachy movies), lame love stories that usually make me wish I had those 90 minutes of my life back at the end, or so-called comedies, filled with so many bathroom references, it just stops being funny. I've recently been complaining that there aren't enough of the wonderful big movies like Gladiator, Terminator, Independence Day, Silence of the Lambs, Braveheart, or any Alien movie or Underworld type movies these days. Batman, Spiderman or any of the comics superheroes seem to be the only ones being produced. (Exception being the Hunger Games movies which are exceptional!)

Today, as I was perusing my sad selection of Netflix movies, I noticed this one (Super 8) made by JJ Abrams and produced by Steven Spielburg. I read the blurb about six kids making a movie and catching something supernatural with their Super 8 camera. There are two genres - there is supernatural, and there is sci fi. Sometimes the two intertwine, but honestly, this one fits neatly into the sci fi genre. SPOILER ALERT: you might not actually know that until about 3/4 of the way through the movie, however. So, I almost passed it up, having had my fill of the many, many supernatural movies available these days (most of them pretty bad). But JJ Abrams? I took a chance because for the most part, he is one of today's brightest stars in sci fi genre TV shows and movies.

WOW! Maybe because my expectations were so low, I actually loved this movie. It's been a while since I have loved watching a movie like this one. The story centers around six middle school age kids, Joe, Cary, Preston, Charles, Martin and Alice, who want to enter a contest with their movie. They borrow Charles' parents' Super 8 movie camera, as the movie is shot in 1979, just before the DVD movie cameras burst onto the scene. The interaction between these six kids is simply amazing to watch. Instead of being snotty, or over-the-top nerdy, they are played as real kids who, before the age of Nintendo and computer games, still have to amuse themselves with either sports or in this case, the arts. Watching these six together, as they meet after dark at an old-looking train station on the edge of their all-American town, I was drawn in as they set up their scene between Martin and a reluctant Alice. Martin is all geeked out in a suit and old-fashioned looking hat, and Alice just stands there in jeans and a t-shirt waiting to begin. Looking back, somehow, I have to imagine a very young Abrams maybe taking a scene out of his own childhood. These kids are really ready - they have scripts, and they know the on-set jargon, they have a make-up kit, and a nice looking tripod for the camera, we even find out that Charles, as director, has a good set of ear phones. This first scene is practice - and as Martin begins his lines, we watch the absolutely wonderful Elle Fanning as Alice come to life playing a young woman trying to convince her husband (or boyfriend) to stay with her and not leave. It was almost literally the opening of the movie and I was already completely pulled into the story.

As they set up for the first ""take"" of the movie and begin filming, Charles sees a real train coming down the track and yells ""PRODUCTION VALUE,"" for the first of several times as he sees (and I'm thinking now, DEFINITELY a blast from Abram's past) a chance for some real cool background (the scene set to the train screaming by). They quickly get all set up and start filming the scene for real. The actual star of the movie (Super 8) is Joe, played very well by a relative newcomer named Joel Courtney (a young actor to watch). As the other five kids are involved in the filming, Joe looks backward for a moment down the track and watches as a truck rolls onto the track and aims straight for the train. He alerts the other five and they watch in horror as the inevitable collision draws near.

The ensuing crash was a bit over-the-top spectacular (seriously, I doubt a smallish old truck like that could create the mayhem that followed), but I'm already hooked and loving this moving so I suspend my critical eye right now and watch the spectacle with heart-stopping excitement. Every car on this longish train smashes up in the air, over the little train station, spilling tons of explosions and debris everywhere. We lose Alice as the boys scramble for safety, but in the end, (again suspending reality a bit) all six kids are OK. What they don't realize, but we are privy to see is that the camera rolled, on its side, throughout most of the collision and fireworks. As the kids regroup, slapping each other on the back at not only seeing the spectacle, but living through it, the nefarious military vehicles roll up, causing them to grab their stuff and run.

At this point, I'm in! The rest of the movie is a wonderful mix of great action and moments of sweet contemplation, these kids really deserve high praise for their performances (or probably JJ Abrams can get a great performance out of an orange, not sure, and yes, I am a huge fan of his). The story continues to be strong as the secrets are discovered by the children, and eventually the fathers of Joe and Alice (the always wonderful Kyle Chandler and Ron Eldard both of whom are among two of today's best but seriously under appreciated actors) who both end up helping them, thus removing the normal - parents are bad, kids know everything theme I see so much these days. I read a review where someone criticized too many longing looks and too much boring dialogue, but I say, if you play too many games or watch too many violent movies, you probably won't like the sweet moments between Joe and Alice, obviously both harboring crushes on each other, or Charles and Joe (as they are watching the movie it took two days to get developed, the scenes taken when the camera was on its side and continued to capture the train wreck), as they quibble over both of them liking Alice.

SPOILER ALERT: The end is a bit of a twist, although if you read my caption above, you might have an idea about what happens, but I loved it. I have to add here that the bad language used by the children was a bit unnecessary here and there, and I am a full-out supporter of the military and I'm afraid this movie plays into the X-Files (which I love) military is bad conspiracies and I admit to wishing it could have been an evil corporation as the protagonist instead of our heroes who a lot of people have no idea how much they give up and how hard they work to keep us safe and free (and I admit to being retired military), but I am not one to throw out the baby with the bath water. Despite these fairly minor annoyances of mine, I still gave it five stars. And trust me, had it been anything less than excellent in every way, I would downgrade it one star for the tired old evil military so many Hollywood producers cast as the bad guys these days. JJ, do me a favor, do our military a favor, too? Make one like this again - but make a pharmaceutical company the bad guy. They actually kind of deserve it. JMHO.

Despite that, I am just so happy to finally be able to recommend a good sci fi movie to my friends! It's been a long, dry period for those of us who love the genre. If you want a really good movie with some great scary parts, big explosions, sweetness of youth, and parents who love, a very winning mix, and no preaching at you or watching sad death scenes or constant dumb bathroom talk, watch this movie. Super 8 is the best movie I've seen in a long time.",1345420800,,8362,4.479344262295082

I normally don't like watching alien movies, but this one had good characters and the alien was the backstory actually. It was more about Joe's loss of his mother and Alice's dad being involved in that somewhat. Also, Joe and Alice like each other.
The special effects of the train crash were very good. I wanted to back away as in several scenes I felt as if the train was coming through the screen at me. The train derailment seemed to never end and I waited for someone to be killed in a horrible way as there were train cars and parts flying everywhere.
One of the parts I liked best was when the credits were rolling, on the left side the movie the kids had made was playing. Too cute.

The acting is believable from start to finish. The ""creature"" turns out to be ""someone"" who is far from home and has been frightened into madness.

At the heart of story is a boy who has lost his mother in a terrible work accident, a father who has lost his wife and, as a result, his son, and is trying to replace both with his job, and an alien imprisoned for many years by a combination of curious scientists, and nasty government types.

The three are thrown together by a train crash and the film is mostly about them moving toward each other.

At one point the boy yells at his father that ""he does not get it."" At the end of the film, the dad holds his son in his arms and says ""I got you."" A few moments earlier the alien, having grabbed the kid, and discovering that he has touched a kindred soul- lost, sad, in pain, angry- hears the words: ""You don't have to stay."" after the boy's statement that sometimes awful things happen and you just have to move on.

The boy gets it.

The alien gets it.

4362626,1,B004EPYZQ2,"Well, I took a chance on it and my instincts were right. This is Spielberg trying so hard to get the freshness of ET and the creativity of ""Amazing Stories"" . It's a mish-mosh combination that goes off the rails.

The film actually starts off producing mild interest for the first twenty five minutes. Some annoying half teen/half something else kids of 1979 suburbia are working on making a home style movie. That's about the only part that held my interest because I had done the same as a youngster, but after the big train wreck, this monstrosity goes on and on with noise and nonsense. The kids get caught up in some military generated creature bs (or restrained alien- who knows) that plays out like a far fetched kiddie film. Most movies generate improbability, but this film throws in the kitchen sink and more as it scrambles for high octane interest.

The creature is so wicked and destructive that no one in their right mind, let alone a kid, would want to come near the thing. The CGI seems old school and detracts as the monster who is wisely hidden with glimpses reveals itself. Of course one pre- teen boy can stop this fiend in it's tracks with vocal civility. Sub plots including a weirdly displayed kid crush and conflicting dads fall flat all around. Remove the sci -fi aspect and you have big screen Hallmark movie. A concoction of metal, lights and crud is whipped up to create an excuse of an ending. It couldn't come fast enough for this dud.",1343260800,5,1465,4.566539923954372

The movie is derivative (you will detect elements of ""Stand by Me,"" ""E.T.,"" ""Gremlins,"" etc.) but it does have a good, plausible storyline for a sci-fi film, with decent performances by the (mostly adolescent)cast.

It isn't as gritty as ""Cloverfield,"" nor is it quite as heartwarming as ""E.T.,"" but like those films, it is good sci-fi entertainment, and well worth taking a chance on if you haven't seen it yet.",1341964800,,779,4.630434782608695

The film's main characters are developed for the most part, and the coming of age theme fits in nicely with the story. The action and sci-fi elements are there, yes, but they don't take precedent over the characters and the spirit of the film.  As others have stated, Super 8 does have a Stand by Me/ Goonies kind of vibe to it, with a bit of teenage crush thrown in.

A group of kids in a rural Ohio town witness a horrific train wreck while they are out filming a scene for a film contest.  One of the boys, Joe, however, notices that a car had also been in on the disaster. The driver of the vehicle, who is badly hurt, has puzzling and ominous warning to the startled children. This message has more meaning as odd supernatural events begin to take place in the area. The military comes in, but there is the sense that all is not right in the small town. Joe's father, Police Chief, begins to look for answers to the odd happenings.

One of the things I liked leading up to this film's opening last year was that the trailers held back on revealing major spoilers, which was kind of refreshing in a day and age when we are given too much during previews. The producers take this a step further by showing the ""creature"" minimally, the ""less is more"" approach adding more suspense the plot.

If there is one weakness of Super 8, it is that the ending was a little weak. It got a bit over the top, and sort of felt a bit jumbled, like the film lost steam as it headed to the finish.

Still, Super 8 has that summer blockbuster feel to it that makes it a treat to watch. There are also some standout performances by Elle Fanning (Alice) and Joel Courtney (Joe).

Although it's listed as a science fiction thriller, Super 8 is an ideal family movie. The main characters are children and we are given enough information to identify with them. Even if we weren't like any of them ourselves, we almost certainly went to school with similar children.

The movie feels like a combination of Stand by Me and some of the best Steven Spielberg stories, such as E.T. and Close Encounters of the Third Kind. The story feels like it could have been written by Stephen King and contains a slice of small-town America, combined with a fantasy element.

The opening scene mentions an accident at a steel mill in which Elizabeth Lamb is killed. Her husband, Jackson (Kyle Chandler), is a deputy, and her son, Joe (Joel Courtney), is helping his friends make a movie. We spend a lot of time with these children and events are seen from their viewpoint. The group enlists Alice (Elle Fanning) to play a role in their movie and she impresses them with her superior acting ability. Joe starts to develop feelings for her and it's this relationship which drives the story.

One of the most memorable scenes comes early in the movie. While the kids are filming, a train approaches. Charles (Riley Griffiths), who is the director, wants to shoot a scene while the train is passing. A truck drives onto the tracks in front of the train and causes a massive accident. The scene is spectacular and will rock your home theater. After surviving the accident, the kids notice a carriage on its side and something is pounding on the walls from within.

That's the setup and I don't think there's any need to ruin things by giving away any more of the story. Courtney and Fanning give strong performances and their developing friendship is believable. Alice's father is a source of conflict and Joe's father has a role to play in the safety of the town. Part of the fun is watching events unfold and trying to solve the mystery. What is causing these things to happen? Why are people and animals disappearing?

Super 8 evokes a special feeling. It's partly nostalgia as we remember friendships in our childhood, and the movie feels as if it belongs in the 70s or early 80s. Technology wasn't as advanced as it is now and there is a closeness between the people in the town that is rare to see in today's world. The friendship between the children makes everything work and it feels authentic.

4362804,4,B004EPYZQ2,"The elements in this movie are pretty standard for this genre: wide-eyed enthusiastic kids, some of which have serious personal problems; a small cozy town where everyone knows each other; a branch of the military engaged in a secret program of questionable ethics; an ugly alien creature which crashed on our planet and just wants to return to home, but has been detained and tormented enough to make it dangerous, but it still has a heart; lots of impressive special effects; and a relatively happy ending.

If all these elements came together well enough, this could have been a great movie.  Unfortunately, some of these elements felt like caricatures, and their blending often felt contrived.  In other words, the movie felt too formulaic, rather than developing from a fully matured vision.

4362807,5,B004EPYZQ2,"J.J. Abrams, as a creator, has been something of an amalgam. He more or less started out making a splash with the TV show FELICITY which was, to me, a rather antiseptic drama. Then came his next big show ALIAS, which was his first foray into genre-bending TV; a high-octane spy thriller mixed with enough drama to make the characters interesting and enough twists to make the more jaded fans tune in weekly. However, he hit his stride with LOST, a show that was universally beloved as it was confusing, but the plot became somewhat secondary to the characters. That show was populated by so many unforgettable characters that, despite fans' misguided anger over the series finale, the show will be forever ingrained in the viewer's brain. And it was during LOST that Abrams started making his foray into feature films; his first being MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE 3. M:I-3 is a better film than I remember it being, while at the same time, fusing perhaps a little too much reality into a rather absurd concept which I think ultimately hurt the film but I certainly can't fault Abrams for trying a different approach to a somewhat stale concept. The next film he did was one of the best pure ""Summer"" films I've seen in recent years, and that was his reboot of the STAR TREK franchise. It created a genuine love and a strong sense of nostalgia of the original series with a lot of winks and nods, but helped to fashion an entirely new direction for such well-known characters with its one major LOST-like plot twist. It was evident that with series like LOST and FRINGE and films he helped make like the nod-to-Godzilla CLOVERFIELD and then STAR TREK that Abrams, while confident he could create new worlds, he grew up in the era of the Summer Blockbuster, and most of the major filmmakers who grew up during that era usually end up making a film that pays homage to that era. SUPER 8 is Abrams love-letter not only to the era, but also to the master of the Summer Blockbuster (and also my personal favorite filmmaker), Steven Spielberg.

Abrams crafts a wondrous, heart-felt, and very well-made tale about a group of youngsters who have banded together in a small Ohio suburb in the late 70's to make a zombie film to submit to a festival, and wind up smack in the middle of a government conspiracy surrounding the escape of an imprisoned alien life-form that puts their entire town at risk. At the center of this tale is the young VFX makeup artist, Joe (a very talented Joel Courtney), a pre-teen who lost his mother recently in an industrial accident. His town-sheriff father, played by the terrific Kyle Chandler, has withdrawn into himself and there is an almost complete disconnect with his son. The other kids making the film are similar to the group of kids we've seen in E.T. or THE GOONIES or any number of Spielberg-ian kid groups, but the young actors and the characters themselves are fleshed out enough to be more than just stock characters. Once the slightly-older Alice (wonderfully played by Elle Fanning) becomes involved in the project, it goes beyond just being a boy's club and the elements of romance and betrayal introduce themselves, particularly from Joe's father since Alice's father (the wonderfully wounded Ron Eldard) may have drunkenly caused the accident that killed Joe's mother. While just the drama of the group and the characters would be enough for one film, that's when Abrams gives us the train crash the kids catch on their Super 8 camera that is the key to the danger and mystery that enshrouds the whole town, and naturally, the danger comes not only from the alien creature, but also from the government, which is embodied by a terrific and menacing performance from Noah Emmerich.

As I stated earlier, the film has enough drama and momentum to make an entire film out or either subject (family drama or alien danger), but Abrams, like Spielberg before him, entices us, delights us and ultimately astonishes us with combining these elements into one big smile of a film. I use the phrase 'smile of a film' not because the film is a hilarious blast to watch, because there are a few moments of heart-wrenching emotion and seat-gluing terror. I use it because when we look back on some of the great Summer Films we've seen in our lives, such as STAR WARS, RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, E.T., CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND, BACK TO THE FUTURE and JAWS, inevitably we smile because these films represent the very best of this kind of filmmaking and something that has been very noticably absent from many films post-1985 (since the biggest film of 1986 was TOP GUN), and suddenly the Big Summer Blockbuster became a monster. The likes of Spielberg and Lucas and Zemeckis and Donner changed the rules of the game for better or worse, and all of them started with the best of intent, but along the way, character and story took a massive back seat to spectacle and effects and action and money. This is not to necessarily criticize all of the Summer Blockbusters we have gotten since, but on most of them, the luster is lost after the season is done. Whether that's due to the quality of the film or the over-saturation of the Summer Blockbusters (It's all about Opening Weekend grosses now, and it's becoming increasingly rare that a film is #1 for more than one weekend), that subject is up for debate. But there was a time when we could easily look back at the films of a particular summer and say, ""That was a great film and it will always be a great film"". SUPER 8 is a very passionate love-letter to those times, but it also finds itself with the distinction of being one of those films that wasn't just a great Summer film for 2011, but will be a great Summer film for all time.",1332892800,,5713,4.6386969397828235

4362877,4,B004EPYZQ2,"I remember when `Super 8' was about to drop.  Everyone that I knew was in a state of frenzy.  It just looked so wonderful.  The nostalgia of seeing a science fiction film in the same vein as those pioneered by Steven Spielberg was almost too good to be true.  Could `Super 8' really be this generation's `E.T.'?  The world was on edge and nearly every Oscar prognosticator was prematurely claiming it a lock in nearly every tech category, and some were even claiming that it was on its way to Best Picture and possibly even Best Director glory.

Then it opened to lukewarm critical response, fizzled out and walked away with ZERO Oscar nominations.

I was one of those who rushed to predict this everywhere, and I was wholly thrilled to see the film.  It just looked so lovely.  The biggest issue with a film like `Super 8' is that it is rather silly.  The bugs were not worked out wholly.  The script, while rich with contagious dialog (the sparring between the child actors is the finest part of the film) is too unsure of itself to aid the film any.  When we are focused on the alien, the film falls apart; and that is a sad fact considering that the whole draw here was, in all respects, the alien.

So here's the basic premise.  In Ohio, way back in 1979, there was a young boy named Joe.  Joe's mother has died and he's obviously distraught about it.  His father love him, but he's preoccupied with work (he's the Sheriff's Deputy) and he's a little too hard edged.  Joe's best friend Charles is obsessed with making movies and convinces the neighborhood kids to make a zombie film with him.  While making the film, a train crashes and a `thing' escapes and havoc is set loose on the small town as dogs and eventually people start disappearing.  The military is all over it, the citizens are in a panic and Joe and his friends start searching for the answers.

Visually, the film works to a certain extent.  The special effects can feel a little overdone in parts (the crash itself lasts far too long and screams ""look at me"") and the alien itself is an uninspired disappointment.  That said, the set pieces are beautifully done and the whole feel of the era portrayed is nicely kept in tone.  The atmosphere of the film's first half is flawless.  In fact, leading up to the actual alien business, I was thinking this film was truly brilliant.  Sadly, it takes a nosedive into clich&eacute; ridden sci-fi with little inspiration to keep it afloat.  The child performances are all great; Elle Fanning proving once again that she deserves an Oscar, but the adults are all simple creations that lack depth.  The token villain (the military Col. Nelec) is a walking stereotype, and Noah Emmerich is a terrible actor.  I hated the ending, for it felt lazy and rushed and so not worthy of the tremendous build up.  In fact, I really wish that the whole alien thing had been scrapped from this movie completely.  It just didn't work.

Why couldn't J.J. Abrams have attempted to make this generation's `Stand By Me' instead?

Alas, I'm giving this a B-.  It was surely entertaining, despite its failure to live up to my high expectations.  The acting was very nice and the tone of the film was beautifully rendered.  This is a very good movie; but it could have been great.",1331251200,,3271,4.552315608919383

Having been produced by Steven Spielberg, you definitely get the 80's ET & Goonies-esq vibe of the film, but with a darker tone to it. The characters of the film and their interactions in the community are actually the most interesting part of the film. It is only when the `mystery' of the film takes on a science fiction twist that it removes you from the reality of the film it has expertly built up, therefore causing your concentration to waver slightly.

4362918,4,B004EPYZQ2,"Super 8 was billed as a tribute to movies like E.T. and the days of the child filmmaker in the late 1970s. The first few minutes seem to hold true to this. The movie starts with a bunch of kids making amateur movies. The acting is superb and it really evokes the images I have of a young Spielberg and Lucas making movies.

However, it doesn't continue. About a quarter into the movie, it suddenly transforms into a 2000s movie. The kids start filming a scene and then accidentally catch a major train crash on film. Next, the movie turns into a sci-fi/alien mystery/thriller. While it's a mystery for all of the adults in the movie, to 21st century viewers the odd series of events obviously point to an alien. Thus, there really isn't any mystery to unravel. Also, the plot gyrates back and forth between Alien and E.T., which just doesn't make for a good mix. Some moments are really dark and scary, while at other points we're supposed to be laughing with the kids or staring in wonder.

Fortunately, the kids are a joy to watch in their respective roles. Each of their characters possesses realistic quirks and lights of inspiration, from the chubby director to the pyromaniac ""zombie"" actor. They more than anything else capture that wild and free spirit of the young boy with his super 8 camera. Elle Fanning is superb as the girl who gets recruited to act in the amateur movies. Her acting scene near the beginning showed a level of maturity and intensity that left me agog. I think the movie would have been a LOT better if J.J. Abrams had stuck to the 1980s formula of really focusing the movie on the kids, as in E.T. or Goonies.

Also, some of the overdone CG special effects, such as the train crash, seemed out of place and unrealistic. Did we really need a scene where the kids run from an exploding train? That's the type of Hollywood nonsense that wouldn't have passed muster 30 years ago.

Overall, this is an enjoyable movie, but I think it departed a bit too much from the homage it was intended to be.  J.J. Abrams made a strong sci-fi movie with superb child actors, but can't quite escape the baggage of the past decade in cinema.",1328486400,,2153,4.51025641025641

I did not think they let all of the kids personality's come to light mainly just the 3 main characters. I feel the story line was weak, real weak. The train wreck looked like models. The Professor, the Evil Air Force guy and the Alien did not have any character development. I could not hate the Evil Air Force guy or feel sorry for the Alien or the Professor. The makers of this movie missed something to make this a truly good movie that I would want to watch year after year. I still watch the Goonies from time to time and I am old. Don't stop watching the movie when the credits begin that is when they show the finished movie the kids were making.

4363030,1,B004EPYZQ2,"I had high hopes for this movie, but it was so filled with countless plot holes and so badly written, that the group of us watching were falling off our chairs by the end with laughter.  It played like a frantic fever dream, jumping from one non-nonsensical scene to another.  By the end, we were rooting for the army to destroy the evil alien who killed countless innocent people, destroyed a town, and left an entire community broken.  In the end, it flies away, powered by the locket that the main characters mother's gave him.  Who knew an intergalactic spaceship could be powered by schmaltz.

There were many scenes that were introduced that did nothing to advance the story or deepen the understanding of the characters.  The mother's death by a steam beam did not impact the story or really the main character.  You really felt nothing for the child, because that emotional pain was not connected with the story.  The conflict with the father and the drunk man responsible for his wife's death was also meaningless.  Why spend a scene on that?

Here are a couple of items for thought:

1. The Air Force does not actually have any airplanes or helicopters.  Instead, the air force has to run to the scene of the train crash.

2. Why did the alien have to dig all those tunnels when the entire town was built around a mine?

3. What did the alien need with all those people that it was kidnapping?  Was it going to eat them?

4. The townspeople had no knowledge of the alien.  If the alien had a physic connection with the people, why did it senselessly kill so many innocent people?  By the end, it was a blood bath!

5. Why does the Air Force have so many tanks, and why were they randomly blowing up the town?  This is another example of where a scene was filmed and then had to be explained away to justify the inclusion of such scene.

6. At the end, cars, tanks, bicycles (anything metallic) are all flying towards the ship.  Then, amazingly, here comes the dad driving in his Jeep which is totally unaffected.  Also unaffected was the child with all those METAL braces?  Why wasn't he pulled into the ship and killed?

7. Why was the conflict over the girl suddenly introduced?  In came from nowhere.

8. If keeping the alien's existence was so important, why did the Air Force allow the children to constantly film them?

These are only a few points.  Unfortunately, the writing was so lazy that it ruined what could have been a good film.  I would NOT recommend this as a buy.",1326672000,10,2491,4.4832962138084635
4363031,3,B004EPYZQ2,"If you just like special effects and little else you may enjoy this hodgepodge of a film. I remember Spielberg reminiscing on a TCM special about ""Epic Films"", how he was influenced as a kid by Cecil B. DeMille's train wreck sequence in the film, ""The Greatest Show On Earth"". It's redone  here and it's even more spectacular, but it would have benefited greatly if there had been some suspense leading up to it! After that scene, the film deteriorates into every mediocre Sci-Fi film of the Fifties, except with much bigger special effects. The ending is much like ""E.T."" and ""Close Encounters Of The Third Kind"", but without any of the charm of those films, or really making much sense! In fact the whole film borrows heavily on the ""E.T."" theme of the misunderstood, but in this case, brutally tortured alien, just wanting to go home. The ending, despite all of the visual effects, is actually a little cheesy, although we're supposed to feel awe inspired.
The whole movie is disjointed and it really pains me to write such a bad review for any film that Spielberg is associated with, but the film leaves the viewer with way too many unanswered questions, and it's really a huge letdown in almost every department! I actually found myself ""redirecting"" and ""rewriting"" this movie in my head as I was watching it, and that's NOT a good sign!",1326672000,,1343,4.690677966101695

At the reception in their home, Deputy Jackson Lamb (Chandler) ejects a man who showed up intoxicated and his son Joe (Joel Courtney) bears witness. In an effort to buy time so that he himself and his son can come to grips with the loss, Jackson tries to persuade Joe to go to baseball camp for the summer and, at the same time, disparages his friends whose interests include the production of monster films for one and explosive for another. As they are in the middle of one such film and Joe promised to help complete it, he declines the offer.

  One night, he sneaks out of the house to joins his friends in filming a scene at a train station and they are all nearly killed when a train is derailed after a head-on collision with a speeding pickup. It is the collision and subsequent events that are the source for most of the film. The train belonged to the Air Force and before long, so does the crash site and most of the town as it is placed under a de facto martial law. Joe and Charles, the director of the film that brought them to the train station in first place, examine their footage and see something escaping the train.

  Written and directed by J. J.

4363075,3,B004EPYZQ2,"A vastly overrated outing from both overrated director J.J. Abrams and has-been Steven Spielberg, this film has gotten about 95% of its success on those two names alone. Therefore, for the sake of a non-bias review for yourself, simply forget (as hard as it may be for the average American), FORGET that this movie has any connection whatsoever with J.J. and Ol' Steve. Take the film for its own right, and you'll see that this is perhaps the most overrated film of 2011. If you remember the teaser trailers leading up to its release, you'd say they were vastly vague, and revealed almost nothing except for creepy music and a lot of darkness. There is a reason for this, it was an attempt to create a buzz for this film because the filmmakers knew they had nothing to really work with. Any other type of trailer would've simply revealed every details about the movie in a matter of 2 minutes. Because, honestly, that's all the time you need to reveal every plot device this film actually offers.

The film stars a group of no-name teenage actors who are growing up in the late 1970's, they all are in the middle of creating a low-budget zombie film when a train station scene changes their lives (at least for a few days), when they witness and come head on with a giant train crash, holding an alien that the military is trying to keep under wraps. The teens escape with this knowledge and are then pursued by said military... the film basically delves into a continuous desperate attempt to try and create characters who we really never end up truly caring about, and a plot that drones on, stretching for suspense but never achieving any of it. Later on after a semi-climactic (not really) final scene, the aliens escape and we really never get to know what happens to all the kids as the movie just ends.

The biggest problem with this film is that J.J. and Spielberg try to take various elements that would equate to a heart-warming movie - middle schoolers, puppy love, a simpler time and generation (1979), quiet mid-western town, etc - and try to toss in a strange antagonist (aliens) to mix things up, but never actually using any of these attributes to do anything worthwhile. What Spielberg and J.J. seem to forget is that these elements alone will not create an enjoyable film, you need a good script to do that, not to also mention better actors. In other words, while it was cute to get no-name teenage actors to feel more realistic instead of hiring Lindsay Lohan and the cast of High School Musical, they don't put on performances that really break any ground. They play their parts well enough, but never hold any chemistry or magic, many times when even given the opportunity simply act as wooden slabs, displaying forced puppy love crushes and social tension. It just never works, it's hardly ever believable. Sure they're cute and the ""pretty girl"" definitely can pull of the ""mystery girl with a heart-melting smile"" well, these things are all ruined by forced monologues of things that are never touched upon in any way during the film except for the part when the kids are just TELLING us. An example being one drawn out monologue with said pretty girl going on about some memory of her childhood while watching a film in a dark room with the kid who's going ga-ga over her... her forced tears don't fool anyone, I don't care what Spielberg says in the featurettes, it's boring and useless, does nothing to enhance her character or do we see any of these elements of what she's actually TALKING ABOUT during her monologue as all these kids (except for the main protagonist boy) don't even seem to have any parents! To put it another way, don't have a character talk about things in her life she does or does not like, have her cry over it, stretch to make it dramatic (even though it isn't because her character isn't built up well enough prior for us to care), and then NOT have these things she's talking about be seen in any way whatsoever throughout the movie.
Another minus being the military/airforce/whatever who is trying to keep the Area 51 alien under wraps. Of course they fail, but even though the aliens themselves are supposed to be the the villains, so are the military. The issue here is that the aliens do not make themselves well known enough for us to be scared of them, dislike them, or desire to see them die for being the villains - they just aren't written in the film well enough at all except for just a few scenes of ""rarr! be scared! I'm the alien! The bad guy in the movie! rarrr!!"" Sorry, but that just isn't enough. Moreover, the military/airforce guys are too nice. They don't do anything that makes us dislike them or see any reason whatsoever why we should even be rooting for these obnoxious kids. Hence, we don't. So there really don't feel to be any ""bad guys"" in the film.
To just make one last point, the time era the film takes place in also is near unbelievable. Sure it's 1979, and things aren't THAT much different than they are now, given a suburb, but the point just isn't made well enough, and I can't tell whether it's because of bad props or just not enough atmosphere helping me to really believe this really is 1979. A film like ""Born on the Fourth of July"" with Tom Cruise from the late 80s made the 60's FEEL like the 60's, as does the recent hit ""The Help,"" as well as ""Forest Gump."" These films highlight their time era, thus making it more believable, and in a way making the characters more genuine and likable. What only adds to this problem is the way the kids in the movie speak. They don't SPEAK like kids who grew up in the 1970s, or act correctly in terms of body language; rather, they speak way too modern, all carry a sort of sarcastic and tongue-in-cheek attitude you'd expect from a kid growing up in the 2000's. Obviously Abrams is too young to even know how children acted in the 70s. Perhaps Spielberg could've written or directed a bit of this film, at least he has some experience during this time as it was when he created some of his most classic films.
Spielberg and Abrams like to boast about how this film is done to pay ""homage"" to old sci-fi thrillers of the past. Besides E.T., I honestly don't think anyone really cares. I mean, who has even seen these old 50's movies besides die-hard movie buffs themselves who are forking over about 1% of all this film's earnings? You want to pay homage? Fine. But at the very least make a GOOD movie with a GOOD script.
Anyway, aside from the lack of characterization, the plot goes nowhere as the military scenes involving the guys trying to cover the whole thing up are never interesting, and there are never any plot twists among any of the characters, but things just play out exactly as you'd expect them to throughout the movie. The ending just, well, ends. I actually remember fighting to not fall asleep during the the last half hour of the film.

One reviewer states that this feels more like a big-budget Disney film, which is very true. This movie seems to want to impress adults by incorporating ""childhood charm,"" but does none of it, especially not with that dumb alien storyline always getting in the way. This movie simply feels like a big-budget film that could've just been premiered on Disney XD. This one may have been intended for all ages, but adults simply won't feel any charm whatsoever, and neither will teenagers, although they may enjoy seeing peers their age argue, sometimes. Maybe, but I'm just chancing it.

Spielberg has not made a decent film in years. Minority Report, though containing a great story and special effects, lacked good direction. There weren't very many thrilling scenes throughout it. Although it still worked mostly because it contained a good story. J.J. Abrams has got to be the most overrated director alive today, and only seems to do well simply because American audiences fall so easily for big-budget films with very little substance. While Star Trek made a good film, it did contain a good number of flaws, namely, a lame and boring enemy.... which is the same we get in Super 8. J.J. also can get a good word in by legendary directors, thus people simply fork up the money and say they enjoyed the film because they can't see past a special effects show with substandard characterization and a predictable script.

While Super 8 wasn't terrible, it was definitely overrated, and just comes off as your average run-of-the-mill alien flick starring some kids who you won't ever remember again. The campaign for this film did lots to draw people in, considering all the mysterious teaser trailers that made this film almost feel like the most mysterious and epic alien-lands-on-earth film ever. It would be nice to actually, then, you know, make the aliens have some REAL interaction. I'd say rent, don't buy.

Technical Stuff:
On a technical level, the Blu-ray disc looks great, the movie is sharp and sound is top-notch. The train crash scene (being the only worthwhile thing in the film, and the most exploited as it seems to be the only thing that drew people in) boasts of great bombastic sound and sharp picture, and beautiful explosions. The special features take are all filmed in HD, and take you into behind-the-scenes footage of making the film. Unfortunately, we can only take so much, as much of this is simply overkill. I don't need to see every waking moment of what people did and talked about while they were making the movie. Especially if it was a movie I didn't much even care for. The only films that can get away with this type of footage are ones where you REALLY want to know what went on... such as, let's say, Lord of the Rings.",1326412800,2,9654,4.600116076610563

The kids in the film do a good job of acting however the generic ""fat kid"" gets annoying after a while. The story is pretty basic, alien escapes train wreck and tries to leave earth. Don't expect to see much of the alien creature, i would say 5 minutes of screen time tops, but the overall special effects are great and are done by Spielberg buddy ILM.

The ending was lame and was so contrived a placard could have spelled it out. The thing that I really hated was that up until the last few minutes the movie was actually quite well done.

The problem seems that no one could decide if the monster was good or bad and if should fear or hate it. It leaves us with so many unanswered questions and just wimps out.  All in all this is a very poor movie and is not worth your time.  I am glad I didn't waste my money when it was in the movies.",1326326400,2,705,3.936619718309859
4363079,5,B004EPYZQ2,"This is a wonderful movie for many reasons. Super 8 centers around a group of kids in the late 70's filming a movie. However, after a major accident, the focus turns from filming their movie to trying to figure out what is going on in town. Things disappearing, animals acting strangely, and an outside presence entering town all let you know something strange is happening in the small quiet town of Lillian. During their movie-making process and investigation into the mystery, the group of friends becomes closer and even deal with issues that teenagers still face in the present. The young cast in the movie are all very talented. Joel Courtney leads the way (in his debut acting role no less!) as Joe Lamb, a teenager struggling to connect with his father in their single parent household. He also has to deal with his first crush and conflict with friends as he learns to become a leader and someone who can take charge in a difficult situation. His facial expressions are phenomenal as he displays a wide variety of feelings perfectly and is more than capable of delivering emotionally charged dialogue. Such a great first acting role, expect Joel Courtney to be acting for many years to come. Next is Elle Fanning, who plays the only girl (Alice Dainard)among the group of friends and who has troubles at home of her own. Look for an amazing scene between her and Joel in the middle of the movie where both showcase their emotional depth and may very well move you to tears. Riley Griffiths plays the bossy director of their film (Charles), yet is also capable of showing a more vulnerable side in Super 8 as well. Ryan Lee, Zach Mills, and Gabe Basso play the remaining 3 friends in the group (Cary, Preston,Martin)and each gets a chance to show off their comedic skills and add a lot of humor to the movie, especially Ryan. While the resolution to the movie (and the end of the mystery)may seem to come about suddenly, the message behind it is very meaningful and full of symbolism.

1. Likable characters

3. Righteous FX

He makes me remember being a kid and having dreams, biking around and thinking about nothing except the moment, wishing for the pretty girl to say hi, the posters and models - it just touched my heart. So thanks, Spiel and Abrams. You guys made me remember.

4363135,4,B004EPYZQ2,"As everybody knows by now, SUPER 8 was kind of a homage to Spielberg film by Abrams,

At the beginning, I was liking it much more than I expected and was really enjoying the 70's era vintage vibe and the story of young kids ................. BUT ............... as the movie went along it became clear it was TOO CLOSE to being a thinly disguised remake of E.T.

This became less of a homage and more of a ""by the numbers"" plot re-work bordering on a flagrant remake with a slightly darker tone.

Up until the 50 minute mark, I felt SUPER 8 was going to be a 4.5- 5.0 star movie, but from about 55 minutes onwards it started to fall apart and fade and lost its charm and became basically gave up trying to even disguise the fact it was remaking E.T.

As with most critics of the film, the last 10 minutes (ENDING) was very weak and falls flat compared to the rest of the the film.

The kid actors (and other actors) did a great job.
The set and wardrobe people did a great job.

As mentioned above ...... for the first 2/3 of the movie, it was on track to be almost a 5 star rating ............. but then it became TOO FORMULAIC and predictable and seemed TOO CLOSE to E.T. and many other similar movies.

Also the last 1/3 of the movie is where the plot holes became very obvious and the logic of the plot falls apart with inconsistencies.

Entertaining to watch and much respect for those who worked on the film, but not one we will add to our DVD collection or ever watch again in the future.",1325894400,4,1495,4.221052631578948

4363137,5,B004EPYZQ2,"Set during the summer of 1979 in a small town in Ohio, SUPER 8 revolves around Joe Lam (Joel Lamb) and his friends as they attempt to finish a Super 8 zombie movie for an upcoming Super 8 Film Festival. While filming one night at the local train station, the boys and the star actress of their production are witness to and somewhat involved with a horrible train accident that unleashes a mysterious creature. Soon after, all the dogs in the town run away, people start disappearing, and all kinds of pieces of electronics and machinery are stolen. Oh, and the military has moved in and blocked off the area around the train crash. While watching footage that was shot on the night of the crash, Joe and his friends make a startling discovery. The boys attempt to finish their movie while at the same time solving the mystery of the alien creature.

SUPER 8 is a sci-fi movie that has very little to do with sci-fi. Instead, the movie is more of an action movie drama that's about relationships. The core of the movie is about the relationship between Joe and his friends. They are a close knit group of companions, but you know that after high school they will go their separate ways, perhaps some of them never to meet again. At the same time, you know that some of the friends will be friends throughout life.

Besides being a movie about the relationship between childhood friends, SUPER 8 is also a movie about family. The movie begins in an incredibly depressing manner with the death of Joe's mother, her funeral, and the immediate aftermath. After her death, Joe and his dad (Kyle Chandler) attempt to hold on while forging ahead; adjusting to the new normal after the death of a close loved one is extremely difficult. There's also the relationship between Joe's love interest, Alice (Elle Fanning) and her own father (Ron Eldard). In a completely different vein, there's also the budding relationship between Joe and Alice. Oh, and there's the whole thing about our own relationship as humanity with other creatures (in this case an extraterrestrial creature).

I really enjoyed SUPER 8. It's one of my favorite movies from 2011. The movie was directed by J.J. Abrams and produced by Steven Spielberg. I felt the film was a decent film on its own. It's a nice little story with some great moments of acting. However, what sticks out most about the movie is the overwhelming since of nostalgia that swathes every inch of the film like a college dorm reeking of potpourri incense. The movie isn't just a homage to the late 1970s and early 1980s, it's a full blown love song that blares out over Abrams's film boom box as he stands outside Steven Spielberg's office. There were a lot of movies made in the 1980s that were Spielbergian in tone or style. However, in the past twenty years, not even Steven Spielberg has made many Spielbergian movies. SUPER 8 resurrects the Spielbergian-style of filmmaking. The movie pays homage to a slew of other films (and in some cases outright steals from some): E.T., CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND, and THE GOONIES are easily the largest influences. However, there are several others including JURASSIC PARK, JURASSIC PARK: THE LOST WORLD, JAWS, GREMLINS, CATCH ME IF YOU CAN, and SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. Also, the zombie movie the boys are making, ""The Case"" has several references to George Romero and his zombie films.

Like most of Steven Spielberg's and J.J. Abram's previous works, not everyone will enjoy SUPER 8. It has a broad appeal, but the tone and style won't appeal to everyone (probably most particularly those over the age of sixty). Nevertheless, most viewers will find something to enjoy in SUPER 8 especially if they focus on the relationship between the characters and not the overall story.

The DVD of SUPER 8 doesn't include many extras. There's the usual commentary with director J.J. Abrams and some of his crew. Done correctly, this often can be one of the most rewarding extras of a DVD. However, in this case, the commentary is incredibly boring. Abrams and his buddies croon about Spielberg throughout, there are long pauses throughout where there is no commentary or discussion, and there really isn't any new information revealed that wasn't already available in the promotional materials for the movie and DVD. The other special features include a short featurette with Abrams and his crew entitled ""The Dream Behind SUPER 8"". That featurette was more exciting that the DVD commentary. There's another featurette entitled ""The Visitor Lives: Creating the Creature"" that features the main creature designer for the alien. This is an interesting look at the process of how the alien came to be created. Lastly, there are a series of trailers for upcoming and soon-to-be released movies.",1325808000,,4764,4.840490797546012
4363138,3,B004EPYZQ2,"I loved this movie up until about half way. Me being a movie collector I of course purchased it, but I was a bit disappointed with it still. It had SO MUCH potential! But still worth it to own, great sci fi flick.",1325808000,,213,3.9767441860465116
4363139,4,B004EPYZQ2,"A beautiful, nostalgic film capturing a more innocent style of filmmaking along with a more innocent view of adolescent adventure and romance than we generally see in movies now. And yet it also feels more truthful than the jaded, pessimistic, and self-indulgently bombastic threat-escalation that pervades most modern adventure films. This film trusts the threat it introduces to be sufficient without unnecessary multiplication.

The performances by the ""kids"" in the cast are spot-on believable as actual children just beginning to mature. Elle Fanning in particular is a revelation and definitely looks to be an actress to watch for.",1325808000,,637,5.5
4363140,4,B004EPYZQ2,Good movie but probably somewhat over hyped due to the Spielberg/Abrams collaboration. Worth the money to have in your collection,1325808000,2,129,5.5
4363141,2,B004EPYZQ2,"One question - tell me what the alien looks like.  Seriously - what does it look like?  Draw a picture.  I can tell you what ET looks like.  I can tell you what Predator looks like.  I can tell you what the Alien from Aliens looks like.  Sooo... what the heck does this thing look like?

You can't.  We never get a good enough look at it to figure it out.  For that reason alone this movie sucks.  Period.  End of story.  However, it sucks for many other reasons as well.

What the heck is this movie anyway - some sort of mutant offspring of ET, Close Encounters, Cloverfield, and the Goonies?  Oh - except in the Goonies we actually had a group of kids that were likeable.  Not so here.  We get the chunky kid who is directing a Super 8 film - but he is rude, annoying, and entirely unlikeable.  We also have a thin crazy kid who likes fireworks.  He just comes off as a nut who is off his meds.  We also have a couple other young boys, none of which contribute anything to the film other than taking up space.

That leaves us with the young male protagonist (I forgot his name) and the young female protagonist (I forgot her name) and their puppy love story - except that we don't get anything from that either.  At least in Goonies there was a kiss.

This film follows the adventures of this worthless band of kids while an alien is loose somewhere in their town.  The dumb thing is that the kids really have no impact or relevance to anything that is happening.  What do they accomplish?  Do they help the alien?  No.  Do they hinder the alien?  No.  Do they do anything at all that impacts what the alien is doing?  No.  They have no purpose whatsoever.

What is the alien up to?  Well, that is hard to say exactly.  The alien digs himself (?) a cavern under the town's water tower and uses a bunch of local machinery to turn the tower into some sort of giant electro-magnet or something.  Apparently, the point of this exercise was to attract thousands of tiny ""alien looking"" cubes (about the size of Rubik's cubes).  You see - the alien ship was made out of a fancy alien alloy that converts into these little cubes.  One minute the ship has form, the next minute it becomes thousands of little cubes.  The how and why isn't important... just go with it.

Ok - so I can live with that.  However, how the cubes are handled must be one of the dumbest moves in the history of alien containment programs.  When the government decides to move the alien cross country in a train, they put all the cubes into crates on the same train.  Why?

Then, at the end of the film when the alien is using the magnetic water tower to collect metal and such, where are the cubes?  Parked in a series of trucks across the street!  Wow... it's like the most convenient plot twist in the history of film.  What is the range of the magnetic water tower?  Guess that doesn't matter because the government parked the cubes right across the street!  Lucky break for the alien because then the cubes all fly up into the air and re-create the alien ship - which then takes off like something from The Last Starfighter.

To add to my list of gripes - what was the alien trying to accomplish anyway?  If the little cubes had not been parked right across the street from the water tower, what would have been the point?  Let's say that the government had actually done something intelligent and had these cubes in a secret base somewhere for research.  What then?  What was the tower going to accomplish then?  In fact, I'd argue that the only way the plot makes any sense at all is if the alien knew the cubes would be within the range of the tower in the first place.  Otherwise, what is the alien doing except wasting time?

So the end result of this fiasco is that we have a bunch of kids that we don't care about chasing around an alien that we don't care about.  This is mixed in with some parents that we don't care about and some military leaders that we don't care about.  Super 8 only gets up to 2 stars because I didn't turn it off.  1 star is reserved for movies that are total garbage and unwatchable.",1325808000,3,4092,4.280104712041885
4363142,1,B004EPYZQ2,"A cute, big eyed alien lands in a saucer, befriends children on bicycles, and makes a phone call. It is a very cute British children's film from 1955 called SUPERSONIC SAUCER. It was laughable watching Spielberg remake this film in 1977 as CLOSE ENCOUNTERS (several versions; he strives for perfection, after all) and in 1982 as E.T., not to mention 1987 as *BATTERIES NOT INCLUDED. He continues to remake this British film. It is now vomitous. Are we not lucky to have ""fresh"" visions and ""talented"" filmmakers among us? Look up at the sky with a stupid expression if you disagree.",1325721600,5,582,4.772277227722772
4363153,2,B004EPYZQ2,"Often, a movie requires the audience to exercise a degree of willing suspension of disbelief. ""Independence Day"" had some examples, but they were overcome by the sheer fun of the story and the fact that they weren't totally in your face about it.  But this . . .

First of all, the movie was shot so dark that there are multiple times that it's impossible to know what's going on.  Perhaps J.J. thinks it's cool to leave almost entire scenes to the imagination, but there is nothing new about telling a story with audio only. Just ask your grandparents about radio shows.

The acting is mostly believable, but the actions of the characters are not. When the acting becomes lost in unlikely actions, I cease to care.  For example:

The train has wrecked. Military personnel are almost immediately on the scene.  Obviously this train is very important to the government. The kids are warned by the doctor that they and their families will be killed by the government if they are discovered to know anything about what has happened.  The kids, terrified, flee the scene and all agree to never speak of it again.

So what do they do shortly afterward? They return to the train wreck to film it. From an open area on a nearby hill. In full sight.  The area is swarming with soldiers, vehicles, and helicopters, searching everything in the area. Except, of course, the group of young people on the hill right in front of them who are filming everything.  Somehow, this doesn't seem to interest anyone, nor are the kids seemingly worried at all anymore about their lives or the lives of their families.

Not much later, they film the soldiers emptying a house of it's contents. This time they are doing the filming within a few feet of where the soldiers are working.  And nobody says anything.  Eventually the C.O. asks an aide what they kids are doing, only to have the matter forgotten when the Sheriff takes one of the kids - and the camera - with him.

I am amazed that so many people could like this movie after such an insult to their intelligence.  Overlooking plot holes is sometimes needed, I understand that.  But this was so monumentally stupid, so glaringly obvious, that it ruined the movie. Nor was that the end of it.  This was just the first in a series of grinding, merciless non sequiturs that soon leave the mind numbed in detached boredom, waiting for the insult to end.  I give it two stars only for the fun 1970's references and the lack, for once, of endless CGI action scenes.",1325721600,6,2494,4.589164785553048

4363162,5,B004EPYZQ2,"I won't bother with spoilers or a long winded written version of the movie, the trailers are good enough to get an idea of what the movie is about.  Instead I will simply say that this movie is a classic and will be considered so for the remainder of film watching history.  I watched a preview of it recently on Time Warner Cable where the announcer said, ""Reminds us why we go to the movies,"" and I cant express how true that statement is.  Though there are mixed reviews on this movie it is important to remember that these are kids taking the place of the main characters in this film and that is no easy task.  Regardless the characters are well drawn and each of them hilarious in their own right.
Aside from the awesome characters and wonderful story there are more technical reasons that make this movie great.  J.J. Abrams' ability to use color and a wide angled shots are abilities that are unrivaled in today's film making community.  When watching this movie look at his amazing ability to use the color blue.  He also seems to have an affinity for the Mid-West and that classic American lifestyle from the sixties and seventies.  His ability to showcase and romanticize that lifestyle is also unrivaled.
Like ""Star Trek"" J.J. Abrams has showcased his ability to rejuvenate what made the original so good, and while this movie is no remake it almost feels like an homage to ""The Goonies.""  What made that classic film so fun and memorable are what drive this movie to its five star rating.  This is simply my opinion but I urge anyone looking to have a fun movie night to watch this movie.  It is both fulfilling and exciting.",1325289600,2,1638,4.537414965986395

But, after 32 years it has been released. It is a sci-fi story of a small town rocked by the mysterious after-effects of a model train's derailment amidst a zombie invasion. Simply a great movie to behold.

As for the format of Super 8, it certainly rivals VHS, and we aren't happy about it. Many have argued that VHS was not available in 1979, but that cannot be verified. MICHAELmATICIAN has released several Sound Units of/concerning VHS (and never Super 8) from 1979. MICHAELmATICIAN did not comment on Super 8 (the film) and neither has Spielberg. Perhaps in another 32 years someone will speak of this 1979 classic. (Hopefully not J.J. Abrams)

4363348,4,B004EPYZQ2,"Super 8 is a love story.  No, not a love story between the characters (sure, there's a little bit of that kissy stuff), but a love story between director J.J. Abrams and Stephen Spielberg.  It is obvious from Abrams's films that, like plenty of children who grew up in 70s and 80s, he was raised on the work of Spielberg and Lucas.  In fact, his Star Trek preboot arguably has more in common with the work of Lucas and Spielberg than with the original series.  Fashioning himself as something of a protg, Abrams has created a wonderful little homage to his mentor.

The film opens with the off screen death of Joe Lamb's mother who worked at the local steel mill.  Both Joe and his father, Jackson, a deputy in the local police department, must deal with the emotional trauma that naturally comes from losing a loved one.  At the same time, the death also strains the relationship between Joe and Jackson.  Jackson just doesn't seem to know how to raise his son without his wife around, and he wants to ship him off to a baseball camp for the summer in the hopes that it will give him some space and stifle Joe's interest in filmmaking.  Joe has been serving as the special effects and make-up artist on his friends' movie about, what else, zombies.

The kids' zombie movie is arguably the most important aspect of Super 8.  The gang's film represents the transformation of their playacting into an art form, a transition from childhood into adulthood that still manages to bridge these two conditions.  The film further embodies the split between the world of adults and children.  In many of Spielberg's early films, especially E.T., the difference between how children and adults see the world is represented in esoteric knowledge.  The fact that the wonderful and strange actually exists can only first be perceived by an innocent youth.  But it is also by making this film that the boys come into contact with the fairer sex.  The director, Charles, has managed to get a girl, Alice, to agree to play the part of the hero's wife.  Joe happens to have an unrequited crush on Alice, and later in the film he gets to play the daring hero to her damsel in distress when Alice is in danger.

Oh, and there's also a giant space alien in the film that's trying to get off this planet while wreaking havoc on the towns folk.  The alien arrives in town by way of a derailed freight train.  The only witnesses to the train disaster are Joe and his gang who have set up next to the tracks in hopes of incorporating the train into their film so that it will lend it some verisimilitude.  The train derailment and the gang's escape is one of the finer set pieces of the film, and it is somewhat reminiscent of the plane crash in what is arguably Abrams's finest directorial effort, the pilot to the TV show Lost.  In all, the alien seems like something of an afterthought.  While Abrams does a commendable job of laying down some carefully constructed chaos, the alien himself seems somewhat perfunctory.  Unlike in E.T. (a movie that I cannot help comparing Super 8 to, even if a little unfairly), where E.T. served as a companion to a child of a single parent household who struggled to connect to other children of his own age, Super 8's monster seems like generic threat #5, seemingly picked out of a hat at random.  The alien menace and the drama of loss and adulthood never come together fully.  And while it is often enjoyable watching people escape or be eaten by the monster, I couldn't help but want to get back to the gang making their movie.

But as homage the film does plenty right.  In the 80s Spielberg placed films he produced and directed in small town suburbia, often in the Pacific Northwest.  Likewise, Abrams's Super 8 takes place in a small town in Southwest Ohio.  We can tell the movie takes place in the late seventies because the local steel mill has yet to close down.  I also grew up in a small Ohio town, and while we didn't have a steel mill (maple syrup was a large part of the local economy), the setting did make me a little wistful for small town life.  One of the great messages that come out of Spielberg's early work as a director and producer, whether it is E.T. or Goonies, is that you need not leave your town to look for adventure.  The unusual, the exciting can be uncovered in your neighbors yard, the boarded up house down the street, or the local patch of woods.  The paradoxically infinite confines of suburbia were so full of excitement that leaving that world seemed unnecessary.

 And in this sense, Abrams does a fine job of mimicking Spielberg.  He may not have all of the details right, but he has done his homework, and the result is an entertaining summer blockbuster.  In a world full of sequels and prequels, we need more movies like Super 8.  Abrams may fall into the clich of the prodigy piano player carefully reconstructing a classic; he can play the notes but he misses the soul of the music.  But then again, the music was pretty great to begin with.",1324512000,2,5005,4.517777777777778

I had relatively high expectations of this movie.  With Abrams and Spielberg working collaboratively, I figured it would have to be good in some ways.  I was wrong.

I don't know if it could have been more hokey, cheesy, or cliche if they tried.  Poor sullen kid loses mom, and dad has to finally be a parent (ooh. gripping.).  The drunk neighbor is ridiculous.  Ooh.  Again.  ""Stay away from my daughter"".  Lame.  Then we have the sad alien who only wants to return home (ET, but more angry and on steroids?).

J.J. Abrams Loves flare. (Flare are the flashes of light across the screen that occur from reflection on the lens. It is gay especially when excessively present, which it is).
This movie is loaded out the hole with metaphors for coming of age psychological-social drama. In small town USA. The train carrying the monster alien crashes into the kids as love/lust blossoms. The girl and boy and their two daddies' conflict and the mother's death.. Girl tells boy not to give up his train for the domineering fat boy. The oppressed alien is released from it's subterranean dwelling, builds it's rocket ship on the town's tallest structure and launches off -after the boy tells the alien it can live and be free. The town is destroyed in the process and the ultimate symbol of society's repressive, overwhelming force (the military) is overcome. And if you aren't paying attention you still get the scene when the boy symbolically lets go of the chain his mother gave him and it becomes part of the alien's ship.

4363407,4,B004EPYZQ2,"Though this film rings of Spielberg in action - fantasy mixed with the magic of kids' imagination and camaraderie - SUPER 8 is a very entertaining film.  It is a movie within a movie - a nice twist on reality versus illusion - and the writer/director JJ Abrams has the keen idea of show the intended movie made by the kids at the end of the film during the credits. it works very well.

The story involves Joe Lamb (Joel Courtney) and a group of youngsters getting together to make a super 8 film of their own writing and acting and production and films: Riley Griffiths (as writer/director Charles), Ryan Lee as the zombie obsessed Cary, Gabriel Basso as Martin, Zach Mills as Preston, and Elle Fanning as Alice Dainerd. As the youngsters struggle with their film we learn of town troubles - such as Joe's dad, policeman Jackson Lamb (Kyle Chandler) and his concern with the town troublemaker Louis Dainerd (Ron Eldard) who is Alice's Dad - until everything changes as while on location at the train stop the youngster's film a bizarre train crash with a truck driven by a wise but somewhat scary science teacher.  It becomes evident that there is more to the incident than meets the eye and as the youngsters realize that there is present among them a creature form space the speed of events wallops to a wild climax.  In the end the Youngsters are the ones who relate to the possibilities of fantasy being real and the story ends with an uplifting sense of understanding.

Placed in the year 1979 in Ohio the film manages to capture the flavor of the times and the fears of the people (could all this be a Soviet attack?!) to a tee.

I happen to be exactly the same age as these characters - and the sets, props, music and ambience was perfectly set to the 1970s.  It was truly an amazing trip back to my childhood.

The story was very interesting - but had the usual Spielberg ending - that did not seem to match the rest of the plot.

4363409,3,B004EPYZQ2,"I have read alot about parallels to E.T. and such regarding this movie. I would say those are loose comparisons at best. While there is a scene that is specifically reminiscent of E.T., this movie is quite a bit different.
The alien, for one, actually eats people, and is far from the small, cute, and cuddly alien featured in E.T...also, it doesnt really develop relationships with people. It is seeking a way to ""go home"", as it were, and there is a military quarantine.
Anyway, the cast was pretty good, and the interaction between the featured children (of tween age i think) was decent. The premise that they were filming a zombie movie when they end up witnessing a train derail, which ends up freeing the alien, was pretty cool. The local animals fleeing the area (presumably due to the presence of an unnaturally large predator) seemed like something that would actually happen.

Where the movie falls flat to me is...the alien is a massive predator, eating people, and destroying a bunch of stuff, but is also cast as a sympathetic character. They try to rationalize this approach by saying that it learned to hate humans after it was initially captured (Roswell), held prisoner, tortured and tested upon by our military scientists. It is able to communicate telepathically through contact (would that be empathically?). Still, it doesnt seem to care about the humans it captures for food, even though they are just ordinary folks with no ties to the military or their scientists. Yet, when the star tween touches him, he suddenly decides not to eat anybody else, and rather focus on finishing his ship and leaving.

There is no fond farewell, no conversation outside of a single empathic moment between the tween and the alien. It just kind of ends. The alien leaves and everybody is left to pick up the pieces of a shattered town. Presumably, the gov't would later say a hallucinogenic gas was released into the air accidentally by way of a weather balloon causing the locals to see things as they destroyed their own town (at least, i figure that is how this would play out in real life). The movie though...it just kind of ends. The alien leaves and everybody is happy (outside of those people who were killed by the now seemingly misunderstood alien). To me, the movie was basically a big build up where everybody is scared which then shifts suddenly and tries to become a social consciousness type message about kindness and understanding. Didnt really work for me. No real peak...the movie just kind of flatlined.
Had i known before watching this that JJ Abrams was the responsible party, i would probably have skipped this one, since i know better than to trust any project he is involved with. Nonetheless, i don't regret watching this movie, but i was far from impressed.",1324166400,18,2790,4.798336798336798

Bad military.  In the end, the alien gets away.  This kind of movie has been done a few times before.  Nothing new here.  Just different actors and a different looking alien.

At the center of the story is a group of young kids trying to make an amateur film for a film contest. I completely identified with this group of youngsters struggling for accomplishment and battling the forces that be to get it done. The young cast was considerably talented playing each of their characters to believable perfection. Quite a few reviews here had questions and negative comments about the alien and its motives. I think perhaps  they were expecting a Riddley Scott `Alien' type of movie. Like all `fantastic story' films, if you look too close you will find imperfections, that`s just the nature of the beast.

ET was a magical moment in movie making from Spielberg.  Before that he made CLOSE ENCOUNTERS.  Both films are five star classics.  This is his production but made by a younger director whom he picked. It is not that this movie is bad, it is that it made me sad that there will probably be no more groundbreaking five star films from him in this genre. This film has the family life of both films.  It has got the alien but he is not much onscreen. It has the ship, straight out of CLOSE ENCOUNTERS. The visuals at the ending are almost verbatim from CLOSE ENCOUNTERS. Basically it is a movie about a group of youngsters making a super eight film in 1979 about zombies, who have a close encounter with an alien.  This happens when they  witness a colossal train wreck.  The train wreck is really impressive. I was actually quite taken with the original premise, of the kids making the zombie picture in super 8.  That could have been a much fresher, more original film had the alien aspect of the story not taken over from the train wreck forward.  I think it could have been a classic like Rob Reiner's STAND BY ME if they had stuck with the kids and their movie adventures.  I hadn't seen Elle Fanning recently.  She is the girl teenager and she is every bit as gorgeous as a teenager as she was as a kid.

I liked the first 2/3 of the movie better than the last 1/3.  A bit corny at the end, IMHO. Also, the CGI train crash was not very realistic -- too cartoonish!

Spielberg purposely introduced a lot of blue glare lines and occasional spots & smudges on the lens (not the Super-8, but the big film cameras). I'm sure it was done as an after-effect to give the audience a sense of what filming was like during the Super-8 days, but frankly it was annoying!

4363480,3,B004EPYZQ2,"I was thrilled by the trailer for this film with the truck racing head-on to derail the US Air Force freight train and the awesome collision that appears to release some creature within one of its cars.  Alas, that amazing footage is nowhere to be found in the film itself.  The film has such a Spielbergian feel to it, it becomes sport to find which camera shot was from E.T. and which one was from Close Encounters of the Third Kind.

JJ Abrams is likely the most talented filmmaker around (LOST, and reboots of Mission: Impossible as well as Star Trek).  The 1979 setting in Ohio provides a great authenticity; you feel you know everything about this town -- and the atmosphere is spot-on.  The acting is terrific as well.  The mysterious premise draws you in as well.

But the film tests your patience midway through.  The film relies substantially on what you don't see off-screen -- think BLAIR WITCH PROJECT kind of off-screen.  After awhile, the creature seems to be just a cousin of that unseen force that terrorized characters on the island in LOST.  It also makes a weird noise like the creature in James Cameron's ""Aliens."".  God, there's several scenes that look like they were digitally ""borrowed"" from that film.

And the ending, meant to be as emotionally evocative as a blend of ET and Close Encounters, was oddly unsatisfying.  Yeah, it's digitally spectacular -- how could it not be -- and how those mysterious cubes came into play was a stroke of genius.  Still, the wide-eyed awed expressions of the actors that so many on this comment stream complained about, is tiresome.  Oh, and by the way, the driver of the pick-up truck would be strawberry jelly after the head-on impact with the train.  I'll leave it at that.

JJ, it was a gorgeous film, but it was a bit too much of an homage to 1970s Spielberg.  The creature we're meant to care about was bizarre and menancing.  No wide-eyed E.T., that one.",1323561600,,1923,4.636094674556213

4363482,1,B004EPYZQ2,"I would seriously like to slap the snot out of whoever did the sound on this film. We rented this from Amazon. We have a home theatre system. The quiet conversations interspersed with frequent DEAFENING crashes, explosions, screams, etc. make it nearly unwatchable! I rode the remote the ENTIRE time, which is absolutely no fun, and my upstairs neighbors actually stomped on their livingroom floor at least 3 times because some of the scenes were so suddenly loud I couldn't possibly keep the volume at one steady level and still hear what the actors were saying.

Why do filmmakers do this? It's obnoxious. And this film is one of the worst offenders. I guess if we'd gone to see this in a theatre, we'd have come home with blood streaming from our ears. I'd really like to watch it again because the cast was uniformly great and the story attention-grabbing -- but I won't, because of this one issue.

4363533,4,B004EPYZQ2,"J.J. Abrams has been known to keep his projects super secret, whether it was a major plot point in his hit television show LOST or the unveiling of the monster in Cloverfield, which he produced. It was no different with his latest directorial effort, Super 8; the first trailer released thrillingly depicted a collision between a pickup truck and a freight train carrying something ominously powerful, but not much else. As it turned out, the film follows a group of kids making a home movie with a super 8 camera who happen to be present when the aforementioned collision takes place, and their camera inadvertently captures something they never expected to film. When strange things begin occurring in town, the children take it upon themselves to solve the mystery. Super 8 is an earnest throwback to the kid-friendly sci-fi adventures of the 1980s, and with Steven Spielberg producing, it's no wonder. With plenty of thrills, visual dazzle, and emotional depth, Super 8 a pretty good choice if you're looking for some good, old-fashioned, nostalgic fun.",1323475200,2,1057,5.045714285714285

4363535,5,B004EPYZQ2,"When I told my mom about Super 8, I mentioned it was probably one of my favorite movies of the past several years. Then, I had her watch it. Her reaction was particularly funny, because she was thinking period drama, and Super 8 may be a period piece (1979) and it may be a drama (if a Science Fiction one), but it was certainly not what she meant...

Super 8 was a huge dose of nostalgia for the great movies I grew up with. Child actors who engage on a journey of excitement and growth - much like Goonies or ET.

In 1979 in a small town, there's a horrifying train crash. The train appears to have had something large and scary aboard!  Our heroes are a young filmmaker and his friends who are working on a zombie movie.

Like all sci-fi films, a suspension of one's disbelief is necessary - the train crash scene, while exciting and done really well, was so unrealistic in cause and effect, that one has to view it through a child's eyes.

Super 8 has some action, several scares, impressive special effects, a little bit of pre-teen romance, and some fabulous one-liners.

Written and directed by J J Abrams and Produced by Stephen Spielberg, I was expecting greatness, and I was not disappointed.

The special effects were also good and Spielberg always makes a great movie.

It was creative and interesting to watch but I did not give it 5 starts because the alien wasn't really seen until the end and only for a short period of time.  In the old movies they did this and kept the screen dark because the special effects were so bad. I always hated that!

Although it didn't develop any really new sci-fi story ideas it did a good job of handling some tried and true sci-fi plot schemes and was in several ways similar to E.T. The acting and special effects were good and the kids did a very good job of carrying the movie.

The introduction of the alien and the ending resolution feels half baked, though. The end credits was done nicely. This film cost $50M to make and yielded close to $260M at the Box Office.

Still, they were quite believable and the mix of character personalities was good.  Ron Eldard, whose name, I had to look up, put in a very nice performance.

4363636,5,B004EPYZQ2,"Super 8 is a remarkably entertaining movie, especially for those of us who lived through the '70's, before working class became coterminous with working poor.  If you missed that decade, the ambience provided by the old steel mill town of Weirton, West Virginia may seem implausible and a bit hokey.

The plot line is pretty simple, and I admit that it does invite comparison with another of Spielberg's films, namely the blockbuster hit E.T.  The parallels are not so close, however, as to legitimate the suspicion that
Spielberg is just stealing from his past successes and recycling old ideas.  After all, the kids in Super 8 are older, the action scenes are astonishing, viewers are treated to a really cleverly done instance of a film within a film, and we've even got romance.

I have no idea where the kid actors came from, but they are very good.  Each in his or her own way is engaging and, for the most part, quite believable.  The kids are at their best when appearing in their own zombie-themed movie, so be sure to watch it along with the closing credits.  It's really interesting to see them portray kid actors making a kid movie -- stilted, stiff, and stammering -- after they've shown us that none of these afflictions of youth and inexperience hamper their performances in Super 8 proper.

Glyn Turman does a fine job as Dr. Woodward.  (He's probably best known as the mayor of Baltimore in the HBO series The Wire, and fans of In Treatment will also recognize him.)  The rest of the adult cast is adequate, but it's the kids who steal the show.

Why make a big name, big budget movie have little 10 years as the lead actors? I would have liked to see the dad have a bigger role(the guy in friday night lights).

I particularly liked learning about the making of and the day in the life of a new kid actor. Overall it's a very good movie that I""ll probably watch again in a few years as I won't remember much about it.

But, like others have said there are a lot of similarities to other movies, except for stand out moments like in ET or Stand By Me that I am going to remember. You can tell in the Extras that J.J. was shooting for that, but just doesn't quite get there. I started out confused in the beginning due mainly to the trailer showing a train crash that I thought someone died in the crash, but I wasn't sure who or why until much later. Other than the boy looking at his mother's necklace throughout I didn't see a lot of emotion about the loss. The girl showed much more emotion acting in their little super8 movie then he did and the scene at the end where the boy goes from being totally scared to being totally calm facing the monster down a leap in direction emotionally. Also what was with the dogs, were they just scared and running off. What was the monster doing with the people? The violence in which he took them and then the pristine health of the victims didn't seem to match, particularly if they had been drug through tunnels. I guess they wanted a scary movie that was politically correct or didn't scare little kids too much.

Maybe it's because I am much older and I don't see the memorable moments with the same eyes that I saw ET or Stand By Me. I hope JJ keeps making more though as he's on the right track and hope to see the kids in more movies as they were naturals.",1322956800,3,1758,4.229166666666667

The main character recently lost his mother in a tragic accident at the local factory.  He has a massive crush on Elle Fanning's character.  They are both the kids of single dads and will eventually discover that they share a deeper bond.  It's a very sweet romance, and the relationship among the friends is also very credible.  It takes your formulaic plot and turns it into something fresh, sweet, and at times funny.  Much better and more authentic than all the Transformer movies combined!

4363665,3,B004EPYZQ2,"I've been a fan of J.J. Abrams since Lost, Cloverfield, and the reboot of Star Trek.  Paired with Steven Spielberg, I was expecting something great, especially when critics were praising this film so highly.  Many people will say it's a cross between The Goonies, ET, and several other childhood films, which I will agree is *mostly* correct.  However, I found that it seems to lose it's tone about halfway through and the overall theme of childhood innocence gets lost.

I will say the acting is fantastic.  With children as lead actors, their roles are cast perfectly.  A little cliched, perhaps, but the band of friends fits well.  Kyle Chandler as the sheriff/father fits his role quite nicely as well.  The premise builds a nice story of a strained father-son relationship after the death of the mother, as well as takes us through the bonds of friendship and the childhood fun of making a home movie.  On a cinematic standpoint, the camerawork and score work well with the film.  Abrams has always gone over the top to drop the audience into a colorfully distinctive world full of emotion and life, and this film is no different.

What I didn't enjoy were certain elements to the alien/monster itself, which caused the story to stray from being about childhood innocence amidst a supernatural crisis to being about children stuck in a violent battle between humans and the alien.  Ignoring the cliched components of a secret military train getting derailed, I had expected this film to veer toward being about an ET-like creature, where ET was misunderstood by scientists but was a caring creature deep down that only a child could understand.  This alien, however, doesn't seem to value human life and showed no restraint in lashing out with unsympathetic violence (aside from a random scientist it decided to bond with early in the film).  Some may argue that this is a more realistic or simply different portrayal, which is better since Abrams most likely didn't want to remake ET.  However, I felt that it took away from the warmness that the film could have offered and made it more gritty as it got to the end.  Aside from that, I'm not a fan of movies where suspending disbelief is overly necessary, but this film absolutely requires it.  From the overly dramatic train wreck scene to the battle where kids are running around unchallenged by the plethora of soldiers, I found myself sighing with disappointment.  That and, despite being called ""Super 8"", the kids' film really doesn't play as big of a role as I would have thought.  In fact, in the last third, it is virtually nonexistent.

It was a nice attempt to create a unique film and I will not deny that the basic premise, acting, and camerawork are fantastic.  However, I just didn't feel the *magic* that many critics said this film had.",1322870400,,2810,4.788381742738589

4363704,5,B004EPYZQ2,"I grew up on the films of Steven Spielberg.  He made me fall in love with the movies and led me to how magical they can be.  Some films are about dark, gritty subject matter, some show us beautiful sunsets, some terrify us...Spielberg sought to take the magical way a child views the world and make it real, and in essence, reminded us as adults, that a little of that magic still lives inside of us.  We still long for that sense of awe and wonder.  Sci-fi (a genre I never have considered myself a fan of) at its best, should inspire an a sense of awe, wonder, and moreover, ...possibility.  ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" took us on a journey like that through the eyes of an ordinary man.  ""E.T."" took us on the same path but through the eyes of a child trying to cope with the pain of his parents' divorce.  It is this very innocent and beautiful glance inward that gives rise to the masterpiece called ""Super 8"".  A summer movie that reminded me how good summer movies used to be before they were taken over by comic book heroes and sequels.

""Super 8"", written and directed by JJ Abrams (MI: III, Star Trek, TV's Lost), is the best summer movie I have seen in at least 2 decades.  It is inspired by Spielberg's ouevre, ad it certainly makes sese that Spielberg produced this as well.  Set in the mid-1970s, Super 8 tells the story of a group of friends who set out to make a zombie movie with a Super 8mm camera.  The kids are around 1-14years old, and the pack is led by Joe Lamb (played beautifully by Joel Courtney).  Joe is a smart, senitive and creative kid who recently lost his mother is an accident.  Courtney is an actor to watch especially watching how deftly he imbues Joe with a fresh-faced sensitivity and wisdom beyond his years withou ever once becoming cloying.  Much the same can be said if the other young actors who fill out his group of friends, among them is Alice (played by Elle Fanning of ""The Door in the Floor""), who is a potential love interest for Joe.  One night while filming their zombie flick, a train derails, nearly killing the lot of them.  This sequence makes up the most exciting and spectacular action scenes and bit of special effects of last summer.  It make the train wreck in ""The Fugitive"" look like amateur hour.  It's a sequence that perfectly mixes action, terror, special effects, and performance.  The rest of the film deals with what's in the train and how it affects the town and the characters.  None of which I would dare spoil.

""Super 8"" flooded me with such nostalgia...not just of summer movies past, but of American boyhood, endess summers, and the promise of adventure.  Joe and his friends are at the age where they stand on the precipice of believing in magic and leaving it behind for adulthood. The movie is exciting, often very scary, and very moving.  The adult cast is nicely filled out by ""Friday Nigh Lights"" Kyle Chandler as Joe's dad and the town Sherriff, Noah Emmerich (The Walking Dead) as a mysterious military heavy, and Ron Eldard (Deep Impact) as Alice's troubled, alcoholic,and very sad dad.

Director JJ Abrams has made a superior thriller that gives us everything we want in our summer movies.  Action, excitement, lots of humor, brilliant special effects by Industrial Light & Magic, but most of all heart and soul.  Abrams has shown himself as an auteur and not just a brilliant action meastro. In a summer over-stuffed with superhero films with bloated $200 budgets, Abrams made his spectacular tale for a relatively thrifty $50 million.  This goes to show that hundreds of millions does not buy a story a heart.  Only an artist cando wht Abrams has done here.  Super * is Oscar-worthy and the best picture of the year.

""Super 8"" is presented on Blu-ray in a dazzling and flawless MPEG 4 AVC codec.  The PQ is immaculate.  I could not find a single flaw.  Colors are bright and robust, contrast is spot on and edgs are razor sharp.  All of tis is achieved without any digital tampering such as DNR or edge enhancement.  Fine detail is crystalline in presentation.  Textures are fully realized.  The image looks more like a window we could put our hand into rather than flat 2D.  Also worth mentioning, Abrams refused to film in 3D as he feels the market is over-saturated with this gimmick.  He's right and good for him.

The audio is a show-stopper with the first of its kind I have heard at a Dolby TrueHD 7.1.  TrueHD is my favorite audio as it sounds the most realistic.  Surrounds are the most enveloping and chillingly real I have ever hard.  The train derailment is a jaw-drpper.  I felt like I was in the middle of it.  My partner and watchd this sequence 3 times in a row.  It is a sequences which should be playing in all big box stores a it will sell HDTVs and Bluray players in record numbers.  This is why I love this technology.  This is the best audio track I have ever heard.  Completed with crisp, perfect dialogue reproduction...this is the track to top going forward.  This disc is the epitome of reference grade, demo material.

The special features are splendid with terrific cast and filmmaker commentaries, awesome featurettes, among others.  Te packasge includes the BD, a SD DVD and digital copy.  Currently as I write this, ""Super 8"" is selling for $19.99.  Buy it now.  Don't bother rentin it.  It also makes a great gift for anyone who loves film...and wants to remmber what summer used to feel like.

The movie is set in the late seventies...The era I grew up in...The Jaws age, the E.T. age.  Like those other classic films this captures that ""feel"" perfectly.  Its like E.T. and Stand By Me all wrapped up into a brand new movie.

I was expecting more from Steven Spielberg. The plot is too vague. How did the Air Force got the Alien? There is only one shot that you can see more clearly the face of the alien - but it was dark. The communication and inter action between the Alien and human are just not enough in this movie. The movie end quickly without explaining too much. Movie is about 1 hour and 45 minutes long.
There are better movies out there - just not this one. I'm disappointed.

The reviews here are mostly horrible too, which makes the title seem too forced.  Most of these reviews read like they were written by promoters for the movie itself.  Thanks, I'm sure you want me to think your product is great.  That's implicit in its mere existence.  But that does nothing to convince anyone.  It only adds to the lack of clarity and pointlessness by making it seem forced.

""Umm, guys?  This title is a bomb, so let's talk it up so we at least make back our investment.""

""Haha, yeah!  Why actually make something decent when we can just force it down peoples' throats by artificially interfering with their purchase decisions?""

Now to make thoughts like this seem stupid, half the reviews will be removed or rewritten, and a reply left to say, ""I don't see what you're talking about, derp.""  Maybe not, but I look at it this way: I could either look stupid by having that happen or look stupid by saying this and having it not happen.  But that doesn't mean I shouldn't speak up.  If you're going to hire shills to post fake reviews, then at least have them look into real ones.  NOBODY has only good things to say about ANYTHING.  It's human nature.  They need to identify the customers' reason to not buy, address that to make it appear to be of no concern, and then complain about some random, inconsequential thing.  Then follow up with a review that makes it sound great but complains about things people never complain about.  ""The story ROCKED but that one dude's shirt had a coffee stain on it.""

4363763,3,B004EPYZQ2,"Super 8 is much better when it delivers a coming of age story/drama, character developement and tearjerker than when it delivers the sci-fi/action & adventure elements to the film. The acting was very impressive in this film from all of the mostly unknown child actors with Elle Fanning in her best role to date next to Phoebe In Wonderland and it's amazing to me that this thirteen year old graces the screen effortlessly like she is a verteran actress, it's uncanny. The story of forgiveness and letting go overpowers most of the action scenes especially the ending which may bring some viewers to tears and the natural bond between the kids reminded me of classic films like Stand By Me and The Goonies with a dash of Signs, Monsters and E.T. and is mostly like those films than being a full blown thrilling and terrifying sci-fi/action flick and to be honest this is just a retro family film than what trailers lead you to believe. There were a couple of plot holes that bothered me like where did all the missing dogs go? How did the monster get there in the first place and are there more? Was is just a mad science experiment gone wrong? Ect. When it actually shows the monster it wasn't scary enough and went the King Kong route and made it have feelings which was a tad cheesy and what I'm trying to say is that it didn't go horror enough with not enough terror and suspense for a monster movie or whatever it was aiming for which I still don't know because it tried to juggle a bunch of genres at once which in the end kind of played against it and became less effective as it moves along. I liked how it was paying tribute to all of the classic movies of it's kind of that decade but mabey a little too much because alll it does is make you rememeber the good old days of the movies that you longed for that it tries so hard to become that it doesn't focus enough on becoming it's own movie which sooner or later will be forgotten.",1322611200,,1942,4.352617079889807

4363766,3,B004EPYZQ2,"This is really two movies. One is a rather charming film about a group of young film-makers trying to put together a super 8 movie in the late 1970s. Their interaction with each other and with the fathers of the principal boy and girl are well realised and believable, helped along by some excellent performances (I especially liked Joel Courtney's clever differentiation of his delivery when he is acting and when he is 'acting' in the super 8 movie). In the special features director J.J. Abrams refers to his own experiences as a young film-maker and it's clear to see that he is incorporating more than a little of himself in this part of the movie. Four stars for this section of the film.

The other movie is a sci-fi flick about a derailed train and what escapes from it. The two stories are linked together (though only just) by the escape having been caught by the super 8 camera, left running when the train derailment causes the young movie-makers to scatter. This part of Abrams' movie is a tribute to Steven Spielberg, who also participated as a producer. It's not nearly as successful, both because almost everything is derived from Spielberg's movies of the late 1970s and early 1980s and also because hardly anything is given any explanation. We're left sitting there pointing out techniques from Close Encounters or E.T., but not knowing why they're being used. At the end, we know what happened, but not why- and without the why, the whole story makes no sense. Two stars for this part of the movie.

So four stars plus two stars, divided by the two parts of the movie, equals three stars. But do watch the final credits to see how the super 8 movie turned out.",1322524800,2,1679,4.630872483221476

4363856,5,B004EPYZQ2,"There is no doubt that this movie was made in honor of Steven Spielberg.

J.J. Abrams and his co-horts say it in so many ways during their commentary and throughout the featurettes.

Set in a small Ohio town in 1979, a group of pre-teen friends set out to make their zombie movie on a super 8 camera. While filming near the train station, a truck plows onto the tracks and causes the entire train to derail. This train was carrying a life-form. A life-form that is captured on their film.

While the military come in to contain the situation, the kids discuss what they are going to do.

The movie is trademark Abrams - so many lens flares - with a strong mix of Spielbergian storytelling - focus in on a group of people thrown into extraordinary circumstances.

Kyle Chandler does a fantastic job as the town's deputy. The other actors keep the interest between peeks at the creature.

Speaking of the creature, you never really get a good look at the thing. Even at the end, when you typically get the full views of monsters, things are kept in the dark. And that is because the monster really isn't the point of this movie.

There are critics who didn't like this movie because they thought it would be something akin to Cloverfield instead of focusing on kids. But this is a fulfilling movie in the spirit of when making movies and watching them were fun.

I think the story is weak and as a sci-fi fan I would have liked more of the ""science"" explained and more alien involvement other than simply throwing junk straight up in the air for most of the movie.  There is very little humor although one boy has perfect timing remarking on methods of suicide. (You would have to hear him, it's not as bad as it sounds.)

I see things in the video that I totally missed in the movie theater. Sharp is not the word. But you'll see for yourself. Well worth it.",1322352000,2,653,3.9545454545454546

4363860,4,B004EPYZQ2,"First off, this movie entertained me far more than I expected it to - well worth the rental fee, particularly in HD as the effects were stunning. Very good acting, and the plot kept us guessing right up until the end. LOVED IT! I have to wonder who this movie is for though? The cast of mostly children gives it a Goonies/ET feel (which is why I wasn't very interested at first) but it seemed to be WAY too scary for actual children that age. These are not cute charming aliens, folks! Very entertaining & enjoyable for me but make sure kids are old enough to handle it before letting them see it.

We had a recurring problem with the streaming video. Every time we got close to the 43-min mark, the video stopped and went black & silent. Then it went back to the home screen for the film, where we could click ""Watch"" and it would go all the way back to the beginning. Our internet connection is not immune to dropping a signal, but the fact that it happened multiple times in the exact same spot in the movie makes me believe there was something wrong with the Amazon server. Finally we just forwarded the video all the way past that part (to around the 45 min mark) and it continued until the end without dropping. We missed only about 2 min of the film but having to start it over again three times was pretty irritating. Really takes you out of the story!",1322352000,2,1360,4.291828793774319
4363861,4,B004EPYZQ2,"J.J. Abrams and the immortal Spielberg have undoubtedly produced an instant classic.  Super 8 is the kind of film moviegoers have been waiting to see for years.  The lowered standards for films of the 21st century will likely help this one to stand out from the crowd. A great CG performance, effects, and score encourage the stellar acting.  The film showcases Elle Fanning and Kyle Chandler's talent, as well as a solid performance from Joel Courtney.  The tale of the monster and the army men who failed to understand his journey is poignant and powerful, even if somewhat formulaic.

Super 8 is a perfect film for the whole family, provided no one is too squeamish.  Some scenes may be fairly intense for young audiences.

4363895,5,B004EPYZQ2,"First off, I have to point out that a lot of other reviews are saying this is a Spielberg film.  It's not.  It's a J.J. Abrams film.  He wrote, directed, and helped produce the movie.  Steven Spielberg is credited as a producer, and that is all.  So judge the film as you will, but don't label it as a Spielberg picture, because although it pays homage to the man, it's not HIS.

All of this being said, I found Super 8 to be a fantastic film.  I enjoyed all of the references, both in style and shooting, to past Spielberg films.  There really hasn't been a film like this since some of Spielberg's greatest (E.T., Close Encounters, etc.).  If you have the ability to listen to dialogue, enjoy a story, and don't have the need for ""in your face"" CGI action every 3 seconds, then you might enjoy this.  It's a much more old-school style of filmmaking and storytelling.  The kids, especially Elle Fanning, are amazing.  The adult characters leave a bit to be desired.  All in all, though, it's an enjoyable movie from beginning to end.

If Amazon would allow half-star ratings, I would have given this 4 1/2.  I feel it's one of the best movies of this year, though, so leaned towards the 5.  Enjoy.",1322265600,2,1198,4.426605504587156

There is a disclaimer in the beginning of the film but there does seem to be a lot of gratuitous potty mouth in the presentation.

These young actors can actually act, and seem like real people caught up in a real situation.  The plot kind of meanders along with the trademark Spielberg plot of an extraterrestrial situation that the bad US Government agents are trying to ruthlessly cover up.  We've seen it before.  I kept waiting for the kids to ride their bikes into the sky.  And that spaceship, I think I saw it somewhere before in a Richard Dreyfus film.

As the movie follows a group of teenagers, while making a film they watch a train derail and strange things start to happen.  The alien does not show up until the last part of the movie.  The alien fights and eats people.  While it is not a horror movie, the movie does show people getting crushed and blood splattering (warning for parents with younger kids) and this is the reason I am not sure about it becoming a cult movie.

4363936,5,B004EPYZQ2,"This reviews is heavy with spoliers. This is a relationship movie. Often summer popcorn type movies have been criticized for lack of character development and this movie, with some exceptions, is creatively different. The relationships in the movie are  interwoven with a compelling science fiction plot involving the sabotage of a military train transporting an alien from Area 51. Once the alien is let loose on this small American town many strange events begin occurring that impact the struggles the human characters are already experiencing.

The central character in the film is 14 year old Joe Lamb who lives in a small town in Ohio. At the start of the film we discover that Joe has just lost his mother in an industrial accident at the factory she worked.  As a typical young teen Joe is heavily involved with his friends, chief among them is Charles Kaznyk who is passionate about the zombie movie they are all making on a super 8 camera for a local film competition. The lead actress in Charles's zombie movie is Alice ""Ellie"" Dainard on whom Joe has a crush. But this budding romance is the center of further pain and controversy for Joe. Alice's father, Louis Dainard, is an abusive alcoholic and it is revealed that the day Joe's mother died she was covering a shift that Louis was unable to work due to his drunkenness. This fact cause problems between Joe and his father, Jack, a deputy sheriff and the relationship between Joe and Alice also furthers the already strained relationship between Louis and his daughter Alice. The budding young romance also puts strain on Joe's friendship with Charles when it is revealed that he too has a crush on Alice.

The conflicts of these relationships play out as the town is under siege from an alien which has escape when the train it is being transported on is derailed by a high school teacher,  Dr. Woodward, who had been involved in secret government projects where the alien had been abused and cruelly treated as scientists were performing tests on it. Joe, Alice, Charles and their other friends witness the train wreck as they are filming their super 8 zombie movie. Soon strange things be happening. Power lines and townspeople begin disappearing along with dogs running away as the military arrive without saying a word to what really was on that train. The military unit searching for the alien is headed by Colonel Nelec who was also part of the team performing tests on the creature in the early 1960s. Joe's father is arrested by Colonel Nelec when he begins asking too many questions. Events take a turn for the worst when Alice is abducted by the alien after an argument with her father.

When examining their recently developed film footage of their zombie movie they glimpse the alien creature that has abducted the townspeople, including Alice, and been causing the strange events in town. Joe and his friends proceed to break into the school to find out all they can about this creature by investigating Dr. Woodward's office. Watching films, reading documents and listening to tapes they discover that this alien has been tortured and tested by its human interrogators and its only desire is to repair its ship and go home. At this point the military comes crashing into the school and incarcerating  the kids. While locked in a bus on the way back to where the military has set up camp the creature attacks the bus killing  Colonel Nelec. The children escape unharmed and eventually uncover the lair beneath the water tower where the alien has held the people he abducted and where he is repairing the ship. After setting the people free Joe has a confrontation with the alien telling him its alright ot leave and that he should go. The movie ends with the mysterious cube material repairing his sip and the alien leaves.

The cinematography is excellent and the film really captures what it was like to be 14 in 1979. I was about the same age at that and have fond memories of the period. Except for the villain, Colonel Nelec, all the other characters are multidimensional and complex. The relatively unknown actors playing the young kids are very convincing and it comes across very naturally. When they are having lunch together the next day after the train derailment they are trying to discuss the situation but they still can't help but being kids and acting goofy and childlike in their confrontations with one another. It is a delightful scene. I think the stand our performances are from the lead actors, Joel Courtney as Joseph ""Joe"" Lamb, Elle Fanning as Alice ""Allie"" Dainard, Kyle Chandler as Jack Lamb Ron Eldard as Louis Dainard, Riley Griffiths as Charles Kaznyk. Elle Fanning  particularly stands out not only in the film itself but as an actress within the zombie movie being filmed. She displays that there is deep acting talent in the Fanning family. The movie has a lot of heart and you really get to see inside of their emotions in the film. You also get to see them change, grow and mature because of the events they face.

My only negative complaint about the film is the lack of one relationship. That is the relationship between the alien creature and the children and in turn we the audience. JJ Abrams likes the mystery element to movies and wants to keep the alien a mystery and to a large extent that works. Although the creature is revealed, wonderfully created by Neville Page, it is so late in the film that we never really get a chance to develop any emotional connection to the creature. It is this shadowy figure lurking in the dark in which we only get small glimpses of from time to time. Although we do learn the alien's story in bits and pieces along the way more interactions between the creature and the children would have provided more of an emotional connection. If we had more of a connection to the creature the ending would have provided more of an emotional punch. Plus, to be honest, I am a nerd about these things and monster and alien movies are among my favorite types of science fiction stories so when you have such a great creature design and top notch special effects I would like to see more of the creature!

4363952,5,B004EPYZQ2,"Super 8 offered true enjoyment in forms I did not expect. Action, excitement, and otherworldly adventure are stock-in-trade for Spielberg and Abrams, and that expectation is what first drew me to the film. But those elements of the movie quickly became less and less interesting, even a bit burdensome, while other aspects emerged as genuinely engaging, delightful, and moving. Super 8 is a genuinely good and worthwhile film not for the elements one expects from Spielberg and Abrams but from those one does not. I'll be specific. The underlying premise of the film (which I will not reveal) which drives the basic plot and offers a whopping dose of the extraterrestrial unknown, but proves utterly predictable and if visually exciting, conceptually leaden, heavy handed, and, really, just inevitable. The same is true for the movie's themes, which come close to being gaggingly sentimental and simplistic as is often the case with a Spielberg project focusing on young people. But the plot, action, even the special effects really serve as a vehicle for the development of characters: their emotions/perceptions and relationships. In other words, it wasn't what literally happened in the film that grabbed me -- it was the way different characters (as individuals and in relation to each other) experienced those events that made the movie great. Abrams handles his young actors far, far better than Spielberg ever has done and allows them to rise above ""the idea of youth"" that is so deadly and false in Spielberg to become convincing, likeable, fascinating, and endearing people with believable identities. Brilliantly, Abrams has all the main characters experience the main events in individual ways; the main characters grow and change in real time, before our eyes, through the experiences they are having. And as the characters change, real relationships -- which are numerous -- grow and change, too. The performances are wonderfully varied, and all the main performers are terrific. Elle Fanning may be the standout here, leaving far behind the ""look at me; I'm a young actor"" effect that tends to mar her sister's work. All of the young actors skilfully create distinct characters but the viewer never ends up thinking ""this kid can act"" because we believe in their creations. And it is how these young characters experience the events in the movie, not those events, that really grabbed me. There is fear and uncertainty, pain and loss, but it is ultimately the sweetness of finding others that makes this less a thrilling film than a genuinely beautiful one.",1322179200,,2571,5.123809523809523

When a little alien action finally comes to play it seems a case of a to little to late to save the movie.
It also didn't help that the story revolves mostly aroung young teens. I wanted a frigging alien movie not Monster Squad (which I would say is better then this).

At least the Cloverfield hand held camera part of the formula was dropped for Super 8.

On the other hand, I'm a big fan of a well written and well acted story. While Super 8 was full of moments that were simply not believable, the story flow and the amusing but accurate capture of how a group of middle schoolers interact with each other saved Super 8 from 2 star land.

My kids loved Super 8. Although I'd hesitate to call it a great 'family' film simply based on some of the mature material and language. It's actually refreshing to see the MPAA take a more lax approach to language with a PG-13 instead of an R. I suppose having Steven Spielberg on board as producer may have had some pull.

Basically a bunch of kids in a remote town are witness to a military train crash. Unfortunately one of the passengers on the train really wants to go home but that's not where the train was taking him...er...I mean...It. But when the train crashes this 'dark' passenger has a chance to escape and the kids do a better job of tracking down the escaped passenger than the most qualified government agency ever could. Now there's a formula that never seems to get old in Hollywood, right?...Smart civilians and kids outwit the dumb old police and military. Oy.

So overall I was entertained by Super 8, but I walked away feeling like it was a kid's movie in PG-13 clothing.",1322179200,6,1768,4.863787375415282
4363959,4,B004EPYZQ2,"SUPER 8 is writer/director J.J. Abrams' paen to Spielberg and even a gentle nod to King's STAND BY ME.  In essence, the coming-of-age theme overshadows the sci-fi elements and provide the film's heart.
Set in 1979, the story follows the misadventures of a group of teens bonded by friendship and their attempt to make their own zombie movie for a contest.  Things heat up when a train crash results in the release of an extraterrestrial creature.
The young actors are superb, especially Elle Fanning and Josh Courtney.  Fanning has an uncanny maturity and lovely innocence that prophesizes a great future in films.  Just savor her marvelous ""transformation"" to a zombie--it's priceless.  And marvel at Courtney when he stands up in hurt defiance at his stern father.  You feel his anguish.  Kyle Chandler (Friday Night Lights) and Ron Eldard (Blind Justice) are outstanding in non-cliche roles as the fathers.
The special fx are good but I would have liked to see more of the creature to add terror impact.  Abrams' script and direction capture the period nicely.  However, the movie confuses us as to whether the alien is to be feared or sympathized with.  After all, Alice states ""It's just hungry and wants to go home.""---the same creature who has been wiping out the town's citizens and dogs.  And is the strange device that moves around in Joe's room alive?

4363960,3,B004EPYZQ2,"This film is an obvious homage to the early films of Steven Spielberg, with JJ Abrams particular take: think E.T. and Close Encounters of the Third Kind meets Cloverfield. Unfortunately, in working so hard in trying to recreate what was so engaging about those early films, Super 8 ends up being a film that is an accumulation of scenes reminiscent, if not outright borrowed, from those early Spielberg gems, minus the emotional connection that made those Spielberg films so memorable and thus enduring.
I have admiration for JJ Abrams, as it is clear from the type of projects he chooses that we probably grew up watching alot of the same tv shows and movies that nurtured a generation of children from the 1970's thru the 1980's, and who are now adults in their 40's. It is clear that Abrams admires Spielberg and clearly was impacted as a filmmaker by his work. But this film somehow fails to capture the sense of wonder that was so appealing in films like E.T. and Close Encounters. I know some reading this might think that someone my age (40 on the nose) has lost some of their sense of wonder by this point, but this is simply not the case. I still marvel at and feel a sense of wonder towards creative projects that truly strike an emotional cord. In this case, Super 8 just didn't do this for me.
The film has a rather lackluster story line with weak and predictable dialogue that is more cliche' than original; the alien has no personality or likeability (it looks like a rejected creature design from Cloverfield); the special effects dazzle without adding any substance or reality (a train wreck scene that should have annihilated the entire cast of young actors even before the story begins to unfold); and adult actors whose performances are as flat as...well, as flat as a one dimensional piece of cardboard.
The real highlight of the film are the performances of the young actors playing the adolescent characters, but their performances get lost in cliche' dialogue far too similar to Spielberg's early scripts, and scenes that are staged as if they were literally shot during a film class entitled: Spielberg Film Techniques 101.
In general, I like Spielberg and I like JJ Abrams. However, overall, I did not like Super 8. If you want to see films that actually hit the marks that this movie is trying to hit then watch E.T. or Close Encounters. They still hold up extremely well as far as I'm concerned.

4363976,4,B004EPYZQ2,"Cinematography was superb. Exactly the quality you expect from Spielberg and Abrams. It reminded me of Cloverfield, E.T., and The Goonies all rolled into one. The kids were excellent actors.

However, once you reach the end of the film you feel as though you missed something somewhere, as though this film was part 2 of a 2-part film. Something was greatly lacking in the story. In E.T. for example, the alien and the boy slowly build a relationship so that you feel for them in their emotional parting. But in the case of Super8, the alien and boy are total strangers but behave as though they had built some wonderful relationship between them. The boy seemed to have discovered something endearing about the alien that the audience is not privy to and is unrealistically brave and devoid of fear when put face to face with a nightmarish creature that hardened military men feared. As the alien sailed away in his spaceship, all I could think was, ""Farewell... who ever you were..."".",1322092800,8,986,4.766081871345029

4363979,4,B004EPYZQ2,"I absolutely loved this film, saw it in the theater three times because the kids were so good. I felt that the mood and the feel of 1980 was spot on. I very much identified with them... I thought to myself 'this is exactly what it was like being a kid in those days' and loved every second. The kids' banter was well written and sounded like actual kids, not watered down... The dad's frustration with the son felt so believable... And the effects were awesome.

But... (spoiler)

Couldn't there have been a better ending? It would have been a simple thing to do to have the kid simply find some crucial part of the spaceship hidden in the dead teacher's storage bin... Or something like that... Couldn't they have helped in SOME way? The dad was running around like a super hero on a mission, and i couldn't wait to see how it was going to wrap up, how the dad and the kids would come together and save the day... And they simply 'met up' in town, just in time to see the alien depart. There was no feeling of 'finally the alien can go, because he met the nice kid and his friends.' it was kind of a let down...

The characters were generally likable, the action sequences were well done (though admittedly, the train crash scene probably brought a tear to Michael Bay's eye), the story was simple yet effective, the production values were off the charts. Will this movie be heralded in the future as a classic like, perhaps, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, or E.T.? No. But it's still a great movie, and a lot of fun to watch. J.J. Abrams is quickly becoming one of my favorite modern Science Fiction directors.",1322092800,28,668,4.767241379310345
4363992,4,B004EPYZQ2,"The problem I always have with critically acclaimed movies is that my expectations are so high the movie can't ever live up to my expectations. On the other hand, sometimes I'll pick up a movie I have no knowledge of and have read nothing about and I'll love it. I also find that on a second viewing, I like the critically acclaimed movies more than I did on the first viewing. The letdown has passed, and I get more into the movie for what it is, not for what I expected it to be.

So here's the cover hype. Is Super 8 ""the years most thrilling movie""? No. Is it ""an instant classic""? No. But it is, in my opinion, a really good movie that just misses, and it's hard to put your finger on why. The acting is fine, and the kids are engaging. Special effects are right on, and the subplots work their way into the storyline without becoming cumbersome. And the kids are remarkable, even more so after watching the special features about them. The leads never acted before? It's mind boggling.

You can instantly make a comparison to E.T. (Kids & an Alien). But this picture has a totally different feel to it. The kids aren't as innocent, and the Alien isn't as sweet & helpless. They do try to pull a 360 on that fact at the end of the movie, but after raining death and destruction on the town for almost two hours, it's pretty hard to swallow. And there are some really special moments in this film. My favorite is watching Elle Fanning at the train station rehearsing her lines, and the faces on the other actors as they realize how good she is.

So you can see the problem here, nothing but good things to say about the movie, and yet, it just misses. Why? If anyone was holding me down, and needed an answer, I might just have to say that although I am a huge fan of J.J. Abrams (really), maybe the movie would have been better served if Spielberg had occupied the directors chair. Maybe the little thing this movie needed was a touch of Spielberg's magic.

4 stars for the movie, and the fact that I will watch this, I'm sure, more than a few more times down the road. It is engaging and fun, and so I do recommend this for a purchase. If you lower your expectations just a tad, you will enjoy it. Hope this helps.",1322006400,4,2220,4.26603325415677
4363993,4,B004EPYZQ2,"Remember when movie makers used to spend most of their budget on writing and telling a good story, instead of spending all the money on special effects and the remainder on the script?  Super 8 is such a movie.  The plot revolves around a group of kids, a few of whom are dealing with losses in their life.  I don't want to spoil the story so I will stick to what was shown in the trailers.  A late night train crashes.  Precious and unusual cargo was inside the train.  The movie revolves around the mystery of what was in the train and what is the cause for strange happenings in the town.  The kids in this movie are all great actors.  The story is great and full of suspense.  The setting of 1979 is actually very cool (which I did not expect it to be.)  The movie is pg-13 but I was surprised at the language.  It wasn't too brutal, but clearly the language police were lenient with the language in this movie.  Despite the language, the movie is a great one to watch with your family.  I had on the subtitles so maybe I was more aware of the language than I otherwise would have been.

4363995,5,B004EPYZQ2,"Wow. This was ET/Close Encounters of the 3rd Kind/Cloverfield/The Goonies all rolled into one with some Stand by Me thrown in as well - and it was a roller coaster ride of fun, excitement, drama, family, friendship, love, redemption and forgiveness.

The humor was excellent, especially between the kids. The humor was spot on, even during the more tense
scenes and how the kids pulled together, helped each other out, even when they had their differences. This reminded me so much of how I was with my friends when I was their age.

Abrams' script and pacing with this film has made this a movie to enjoy over and over again. For an Abrams film,
it's quite different from how Star Trek (another excellent film) was, but that should not deter you from watching
this movie. Even the drug use by one of the characters is put to good use in a humorous way on how the use
of drugs can be dangerous. It made me laugh but it was a message to kids: DON'T USE DRUGS!

This was how Spielburg used to make his movies and JJ Abrams hit the nail on the head with this one. As
others have said, don't wait to see this movie. It is a must see! I can't wait to watch this movie again. It's that much fun!

Oh, and sit through the end credits to watch the zombie movie with a tip of the hat to George Romero. Watch
especially as the kids ""act"" their way through the movie - it's just like kids would act. I remember when I was
their age doing a movie my friend was directing. It fits and it looks exactly like how kids would do it, even with
the cheesy visual and sound effects. Hilarious and so realistic!",1322006400,4,1590,4.254966887417218

Super 8 borrows from Aliens, the Goonies, ET, the directing style of Jaws or most older Spielberg movies, and the Blob.
It's not the worst movie but definitely not worth any of the hype and the preview was much better than most of the movie.

I rent movies from Netflix before I buy since 3D Blu-rays can be more expensive.
For some reason Hollywood seems to think that a better image, sound, or 3D make up for bad movies...they don't.

Also, don't buy the first edition of anything, there is always an ""Extended"", ""Super"", ""Ultimate"", ""Collectors"" version of whatever movie at some point.
I used to do it but I'm sick of the double, triple dipping...hear me Disney and your ""Ultimate"", ""Platinum"", ""Gold"", ""Silver"", ""Special Anniversary"" 3D, DVD ,Blu-ray versions of all of your movies.

4363997,4,B004EPYZQ2,"""Super 8"" is the best Spielberg movie that Spielberg never made (or at least the best since ""Stand By Me""). J.J. Abrams has proven to be something of a film and TV chameleon able to imitate the stuff he liked from his youth while also adding something new and unique about which makes it like good comfort food--it's familiar but not TOO familiar. There are some minor problems with the third act of the film but, on the whole, this throw back bit of entertainment recalls what Spielberg (and even Rob Reiner did so well with ""Stand By Me"" the OTHER best film that Spielberg never made)did well before he became a ""serious"" artist; Abrams creates compelling characters with nicely detailed teenagers and although the adults are a little less well developed, they are pretty well done.

Set in the late 1970's, ""Super 8"" follows a group of kids making a zombie movie that they are going to enter in a Super 8 film competition. The kids witness a train crash while filming at an old train station and SOMETHING comes out of one of the cars. This thing begins taking people from the down, stealing microwaves and other devices. When the military show up, it's pretty clear that something BIG has gone wrong.

The Blu-ray looks positively stunning and is very much a demo quality Blu-ray. Colors pop, detail is remarkably sharp and abundant (well, except for the Super 8 footage some of which was actually shot on 16mm so they could add visual effects--by the way the Super 8 movie is at the conclusion during the titles and is a chuckle particularly if you were from that generation that made their own little movies).

Audio is positively stunning with a lossless mix.

Special features are quite good-- we get deleted scenes (all in HD) as well as a series of featurettes covering the train wreck sequence from conception to execution showing us various stages of completion and featuring Abrams, the visual effects superiors, etc. We also get a digital copy (it's a digital download that you need the code sheet for which is inside) and a DVD copy of the film. There are also eight featurettes that focus on the creation of the film from the story to the final product. Finally we get an engaging commentary track by J.J. Abrams but do yourself a favor and listen to it AFTER you watch the movie because there are spoilers and, of course, a lot of info on the making of the film that might prove distracting.

If you enjoyed early Spielberg films from the 1980's like ""Close Encounters of The Third Kind"" (or even ""E.T."" although this is scary and there is some profanity to be aware), you'll enjoy ""Super 8"".",1322006400,5,2609,4.62634989200864
4363998,5,B004EPYZQ2,"I grew up in the golden Steven Spielberg era of Jaws, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, E.T., and Poltergeist.  If you have read a biography Mr. Spielberg you will find out the story is based on his childhood.  During his early teenage years he used a Super 8 camera(amateur 8mm celluloid film) along with his best friends to direct, edit, and produce his own short films -- almost all of which played only in the kids family rooms.  This is exactly what the film's protagonist does -- (except, of course for the derailment of a super secret military train).

Now it is the J.J. Abrams era (with Steven Spielberg producing).  This film is a four star film with an extra fifth star because of the Spielberg nostalgia.  This film also reminds me of Stand By Me (another masterpiece) because it truly captures the mind of a 13 year old perfectly.  Its like a fountain of youth.. only with scary monsters.

J.J. Abrams is the new Spielberg.  This film, along with 2009's Star Trek are at the top of my ""watch over again"" pile..

But it really had that 50's horror feeling, where you know the monster was there, but you never saw it, at least until the end.  It's too bad more movies are not made this way anymore.  Now it's all about the special effects, and getting the monster in your face. This movie harkens back to a time when directors understood that weak special effects were not the reason you didn't show the monster right from the beginning.

I'm not going to point in too many directions to spoil the film, but J.J. Abrahms pulls the Shyamalan card too and tries to lead us with bread crumbs into something surprising.  There are no surprises.  The movie would have been better served sticking to the core of friends out to make a movie instead of going to the recycle bin.  The friends making a movie part actually rings true from the heart, but it quickly goes down the chase movie route and the bulk is been there done that 30 years ago and then some.

First off, there is this new trend in movie-making to have this atrocious bigger-than-life sound to it and as a result the volume is either too loud or too low, this movie fails because of this flaw, the sound is just awful, noisy, busy, and tiresome.

Next, the lighting was also just plain awful, very dark to the point of distraction, you will wind up just wanting it to be over already.

Another annoying thing that Mr. Abrams tried, and failed at, was trying to create realistic dialog with the character talking over each other and lots busy stuff going on in every single tiresome scene and it just fails. I think that this is because the film had so little ground to cover in what seemed like a very long time...yawn...

What was good about this movie were the kids, I mean, the movie that they made in the film, it was pretty good...

If you grew up watching those great films, then you may enjoy the nostalgia as you watch a group of boys hang out, cuss, fight and then compete for the same girl. If you didn't, you'll like the movie for it's interesting characters and plot. True, there are countless monster movies out there. But, there's something about this one that makes you wonder what that thing in the train really is! What's it doing? Believe it or not, the creature has some motivation that does not involve eating earthlings or burying some ungodly nest. And what's its connection to the shy boy Joe Lamb? Joe has been compared to Elliot from E.T., but Joe isn't interested in making friends (although he would like to send the thing home). All he wants is his dad's attention, and the girl. The creature presents an interesting opportunity to get both.

Super 8 is a refreshing movie in a time when every character from every other movie has cell phones or the Internet to help solve mysteries. These kids are faced with jumping into dark caves all by themselves without any help or any clue as to what they're dealing with. Buy it! It's worth it!",1321920000,5,1291,4.613043478260869

Soon, the Air Force arrives and it's clear they have a dangerous secret they're trying to keep when they begin lying to the local town and strange phenomenon occurs.

The story mostly follows the young filmmakers, starring Joel Courtney, Riley Griffiths, and Elle Fanning. All of the children do an amazing job of bringing heart and a sense of wonder and humor to this thrilling story. I don't think the trailers did the film justice this summer. I didn't even bother going to the theater to watch, as the trailers didn't show any of the actual story. I regretted missing it later, after hearing friends' glowing reviews.

JJ Abrams and Spielberg teamed up to make an impressive science fiction thriller. The backdrop of the 70s is realistically low-tech, with a similar feel to the classic 1977 Spielberg film Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Though, Super 8 is much more fast-paced and full of action-packed, adventure.  The mystery and suspense builds to an exciting conclusion. During the credits, we are able to watch the kids' clever ""homemade"" zombie film, which made sitting through the credits not only bearable, but fun.

If you are into human stories with action as the back-drop, then this is the movie for you. This is basically ""Stand By Me"" meets ""Goonies"" meets ""Alien"". The story was great, the acting, direction, and even the plot were superb. It is only towards the end that the movie shifts into the standard formula of action without intelligent thought. I know alien films require a certain suspension of belief, but this kinda goes to extremes.

4364040,5,B004EPYZQ2,"Clearly co-producer Steven Spielberg and writer/director J. J. Abrams wanted to paint a picture-perfect homage to the former's great classics of the 70's and 80's.  This movie succeeds without qualification.  Set in the late 70's in a small Ohio blue collar town, a youngster tries to overcome the accidental death of his mother.  Joe (Joel Courtney) has a rocky relationship with his father and police deputy played by the always good Kyle Chandler.  Joe and his friends are making a student film using a period icon, the super 8 camera.  During the filming late at night they witness the crash of a train that has not only an unusual cause but mysterious after effects.  The crash itself is a highlight, even though railroad cars shooting into the sky like missiles seems highly unlikely.  Still it is well done.  During the events, Joe also begins a flirtation with comely Alice played with unusual tenderness by Elle Fanning.  Make no mistake this girl can act.  Their budding romance is beautiful to watch and one that most of us adults wish we would have had when we were teeny boppers.  The ""monster"" in the story is kept from view most of the time ala ""Jaws"" but he eventually surfaces and wrecks carnage all over town.  The ending is a bit tidy, but there is no mistaking this well crafted near masterpiece and was the surprise of the summer.

In a second viewing I saw the movie in IMAX. Is it worth the extra money?  No.  The film is obviously larger so we see more skin pores and blemishes, but it doesn't add much to the overall scale of the film.  While the film has an extraordinary train crash, and a violent alien creature, the movie is centered on the relationships between kids crashing puberty.  Joel Courtney as Joe and Elle Fanning as the slightly older Alice are terrific.  ""Super 8"" shows that a movie primarily about kids (making a home movie), doesn't have to be a ""kid movie"".  Let Jim Carrey and the Penguins cover that territory.

2-11-12:  Blu ray update - The transfer has excellent clarity.  It is crisp and detailed.  Very little grain.  The Dolby TrueHD is spectacular.  The freight train crash will test your equipment.  The audio is reference quality.  The extras are all in HD which is nice.

4364041,1,B004EPYZQ2,"I don't enjoy writing serious reviews, and I'm not enjoying this so I suppose that would make sense.  In summary, don't watch this movie, and definitely don't pay money to own it forever, so it's sat on your shelf next to decent films like the Goonies and Gigli.  People judge you by the things you own (not me of course, I'm from an environmentally friendly pygmy tribe who spend our time helping others); don't allow them to hate you or think you are a stupid head because you have this movie on display.

After a lifetime of character development and build up, you conclude that the kids are annoying and unlike-able, and the most annoying one (the fat bully) is so lame that they couldn't be bothered to write him out of the ending properly (cus he'd have ruined it even more).  What's worse is that they try to redeem him with a one-liner at the same time, and that's when you really (really) start to feel shafted.

I won't spoil the ending, you can watch it yourself if you want that to happen; but even the Alien franchise hasn't stooped so patronisingly low by asking me to u-turn, and sympathise with the monster I'm supposed to fear.

And now I can't stop thinking about how annoying the fat kid was. Damn these user reviews.",1319328000,11,1236,4.471111111111111
4364062,5,B004EPYZQ2,"First off, I just finished watching an advance blu-ray copy of this film and the movie and blu-ray transfer blew me away.  IMO, this film is one of the very best of 2011 and if you are a fan of ""old-fashioned"" type drama/suspense films that have to do with extra-terrestrial life and what happens to a small rural community in the late 1970's is truly a film that will stay with you long after the movie's end.  To give any more away would be a sin, so I won't.

The blu-ray video and audio is fantastic.  The aspect ratio is what appears to be 2.35:1 or thereabouts (Amazon has it wrong at 1.85:1).  The video throughout is pristine with vivid colors in the daylight scenes and ink blacks in the night scenes.  Details are vivid as you would expect from a top-notch blu-ray transfer.  The audio equals the quality of the video and I've had to monitor the volume because I live in an apartment and use a 9.1 speaker configuration.  Vocals came mainly from the center speaker along with the two front speakers that sometimes spilled over to the speakers located in the right and left middle ends of the room.  Music and sounds were extremely active in all the remaining speakers.  This film's sound truly rocked my movie room.

I have over a thousand blu-rays and this film is in the top two of all films made and released in 2011.  YES, it is that good!!!

I just pre-ordered this from Amazon.com at the price of $24.99 and that's more than I usually pay for a new movie on blu-ray.  I usually wait until the price comes down (which almost always happens) a few months down the road.  But this is one film I have to have on release day.",1319241600,97,1636,4.370860927152318
4364063,3,B004EPYZQ2,"""Do not speak of this or else you and your parents will die."" When a group of kids set out to film a scene for a movie they want to submit to a contest they witness a train crash. When the man that caused it gives them a warning and people start disappearing they begin to investigate further. This is a difficult movie to review. Much like ""Cloverfield"" the preview gives nothing away, and I don't want to ruin anything or give too much away. I will say though that you can really tell that this is a JJ Abrams movie, and Spielberg's ideas are all over this as well. I would have to say that this is a pretty good mix of ""Cloverfield"" and ""Stand By Me"" with a steadier camera and more tense. The biggest problem with this movie to me is that it was too slow in some parts. Trying to put too much in the movie it takes a lot of repetition and long drawn out exposition scenes which hurt the flow of the movie to me. If they simplified it just a little or had more faith in the viewer it would have been much better then it was. On the other hand this was much much better then I was expecting. Overall, a tense and entertaining thriller that is definitely worth a watch. It was just a few tweaks from being a classic. I give it a B+.

Would I watch again? - I don't think I will.

4364064,5,B004EPYZQ2,"Sometimes, you go to see a film and it doesn't leave much of an impression on you. Sometimes it's quite the opposite and you're left to thinking about the film and the story over and over again. ""Super 8"" - wunderkind director J.J. Abrams' third feature film (as a director) - is definitely slotted in the latter category! When I first viewed the movie trailer, I instantly thought of Steven Spielberg (who produced the film) meets Stephen King - in the vein of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stand-by-Me-25th-Anniversary-Edition-Blu-ray/dp/B00164GDA0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stand by Me (25th Anniversary Edition) [Blu-ray</a>] (published as ""The Body"" in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Different-Seasons-Signet/dp/0451167538/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Different Seasons (Signet)</a>),&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/It/dp/0451169514/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">It</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hearts-In-Atlantis/dp/0671024248/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hearts In Atlantis</a>&nbsp;(specifically ""Low Men in Yellow Coats""). After seeing the film, my hunch was correct. If you are a fan of Spielberg's early blockbusters like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/E-T-The-Extra-Terrestrial-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000A2IPP0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial (Widescreen Edition)</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Close-Encounters-of-the-Third-Kind-Two-Disc-30th-Anniversary-Ultimate-Edition-Blu-ray/dp/B000VECACG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Close Encounters of the Third Kind (Two-Disc 30th Anniversary Ultimate Edition) [Blu-ray</a>], or King's previously mentioned books, then this is the film to go see!

What amazed me so much about the story were the characters; they are so likeable and relatable that it makes it easy for the viewer to take these people to heart. The kid actors are all effective and talented, however their characters still don't quite reach&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Goonies-Blu-ray/dp/B005KQVDH8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Goonies [Blu-ray</a>] status. Nevertheless, they are realistic and fun - especially the lead, Joe (Joel Courtney), Alice (Elle Fanning), and Charles (Riley Griffiths). Now, let me take a moment here to completely and shamelessly praise actress Elle Fanning. Big sister Dakota Fanning better watch her back because Elle's performance in this is phenomenal! She encapsulates both a boy's first crush as well as that cool, beautiful girl you knew in school, all in one - the kind of girl who talks and you just fall in love with her. Plus, she brings exceptional emotional depth to her character and the film; just watch the scene between Alice and Joe when they are watching film footage of Joe's dead mother - a raw, stirring scene. The heartrending bond that she and Joe have in the film helps the story along to prove that this is more than just some monster flick. As I grow older, I find that my most favorite films are the ones that explore the intricacies of peoples' connectivity and relationships to one another. For all of its special effects and monster hijinks (like in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cloverfield-Blu-ray/dp/B0018QCXGY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cloverfield [Blu-ray</a>], Abrams borrows from Spielberg's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jaws-Two-Disc-30th-Anniversary-Edition/dp/B0008KLVG4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jaws (Two-Disc 30th Anniversary Edition)</a>&nbsp;in not showing too much of the monster), ""Super 8"" focuses on relationships; and it is not in some hokey way, but in a way that imbues the film with a kind of magic. It's that same magic that you feel when you're a kid and the simplest things in life are what matter most - that magic of innocence, growing up, first love, exploring the world, and standing for what you believe in.

Most of Spielberg's movies have ""daddy issues"" where the father of the main character(s) is either dead or has left, and Abrams slightly shifts this theme with having the daddy made a widow (the always-likeable Kyle Chandler) who is estranged from his son Joe and has issues with the town drunk, also Alice's dad (Ron Eldard). Add in Joe's crush on Alice plus his growing friendship with the other boys (especially his friend, Charles), and there's a well-balanced summer blockbuster. This is not one of those ""deep meaning"" movies either; people die ... violently, things blow up (a lot). Considering the other summer releases this year, I believe I'm safe in saying that ""Super 8"" is the summer movie of the year! There is something about this film that makes you want it to last a little longer, but it's good it did not because then it would risk being too overdone. It is not the story that you want to last so much as it is a peek into the journey of these characters' lives.

An aspect I really despise as a critic is writing (or telling people) about how good a film is and then those people going in with such high expectations and when I ask them how it was, they say, ""It sucked,"" or, ""It was OK, but I didn't see why you thought it was so great."" I know what I say is going to set the bar high for most audiences out there, and they might not like it. It doesn't matter. No matter what you say as a critic, you stand by your claim; my claim is that this is one of the best movies of the year. And with ""Super 8,"" the proof is in the story, the direction and the acting.",1317859200,11,5753,6.270543615676359

4364066,2,B004EPYZQ2,"For the second time in one year I find myself scratching my head and wondering if I saw the same film others did; those that positively RAVED the film anyway. INSIDIOUS was the first over-hyped movie that left me speechless as to just how OVERRATED (and lame) a movie could be, and that was soon followed by SUPER 8. The original teaser trailer promised something dark and sci-fi spooky in the vein of X-FILES. However the trailer didn't blow me away, nor did it make me want to see the film. When I started hearing that this film actually was a lighter film and would recall the better days of Spielberg in which childhood and adventure blended perfectly, I began to get hopeful. But within thirty-minutes of SUPER 8, I felt nothing but disappointment, and that feeling only intensified as the movie lumbered along. An immediate turn-off was the language. I don't care if kids REALLY DO talk like sailors or not, the amount of profanity, which includes one or two instances of the 'F' bomb in this film, is ridiculous and unnecessary. Add to that, the sexual humor and at least one instance of drug-abuse from one character, and you DO NOT have a family film in the best tradition of Spielberg. You have a movie that offends and will probably anger some parents who fell to the hype. Look at the PG-13 rating folks! It's there for a reason!

I have read where others have compared this to films like GOONIES and STAND BY ME. Those films had likeable, believable kids. SUPER 8's kids are irritatingly loud, irresponsible and vulgar. So why am I supposed to LIKE them? The fact is, I don't. They are examples of the WORST kind of behavior from children. I have heard this film defended for its language, because that's how kids really talk. I get it, but that doesn't mean that a film MUST adhere to that kind of realism in order to keep their audience entertained. Other films have won children and adults over alike without resorting to profanity; certainly not to the degree that SUPER 8 contains.

Having kids curse in films is a bore. It's not needed.

As for the big sci-fi ALIEN elements within SUPER 8, all I can say is WOW, couldn't they have come up with something more original than that? All in all, a summer BUST for me. If you liked or loved it, fine. I didn't. If I really want my family to watch a film that blends childhood with sci-fi adventure and doesn't rely on anything offensive, I'll just put in IRON GIANT or HOOK, or a thousand other films that are better than SUPER 8.",1317340800,16,2494,4.501103752759382
4364067,5,B004EPYZQ2,"Well, now that I've seen it I've absolutely love it, the effects of the main scene were of course CGI, which made it incredibly realistic. Well, J.J. Abrams + Speilberg, E.T., GO HOME! The setting of 1979 Ohio was really authentic with the music, cars, clothes, cameras and more. I have to say that my favorite scene was when Joey, Alice, Charles, and the gang went to a train station and their former science teacher at their middle school drives his truck on to the train tracks and causes a HUGE train crash! That was honestly one of the best movie scenes I've ever seen. Now during the huge crash an alien is let loose in their town. After they get the film strip, Charles and Joey see alien claws behind the train car.

4364070,1,B004EPYZQ2,"First of all I've never written a review on Amazon before but I felt compelled to do so simply because of the number of 5 star reviews for this film. A person who's on the fence about purchasing this movie might be swayed simply by all of the reviews without renting it and I just had to offer an objective counterpoint after having finally seen the movie. People may genuinely like this movie, hey more power to them and this is just my opinion.

I went into the movie pretty stoked because of the initial previews for it. I then read some of the professional reviews and they were pretty positive. So I knew going in that this was essentially a 2-hour love letter to all things Spielberg-ian, much less classic Spielberg when he could do no wrong, so I was even more psyched! And then I watched the film.

The biggest two films that this movie borrows/steals heavily from are Close Encounters and E.T. And those two movies had one thing in common right off the bat - they hooked the audiences in. Immediately. Everyone's seen them so I won't rehash why their hooks worked. This film had no such hook - or at least not the hook you'd suspect in a movie heavily advertised as a summer action/sci-fi film. I knew something was off when they focused on the main character Joe, a roughly 15 year old kid, and then proceeded to drag out the opening. I was still psyched mind you, just less enthusiastic about the movie. And the opening was thoughtful and emotional but just not what I expected. I thought we were going to hit the ground running with the kids filming their Super 8 movie, establish quick backgrounds, and then the train derailment would hit and all hell would break loose. It didn't. We're introduced to Joe and all of his buddies and the I-couldn't-see-that-coming-1000-miles-away love interest and we eventually get to where the previews had me hyped. And then that crapped out.

It seems that the movie's sideplot of Joe's relationship with his friends, potential girlfriend, and his father took up roughly 75% of the movie and the ""other"" plot with the alien was about 25%. Keep in mind these numbers are based on my first viewing and could be off, it's simply what it felt like to me as it unfolded. You get a quick scene with the alien and then back to the much longer friends scenes. Repeat that formula a few times and there's the movie. It just wasn't properly focused. You'd get the action going and then dial it all the way back down to zero.

And then I was just amazed at the homage scenes to Spielberg. They were pretty blatant. The airforce guys who rush out of NOWHERE with flashlights at the derailment was a rip-off of E.T. as was a couple of city shots at dusk. All of the dysfunctional family scenes with Joe's buddy, the budding director, were completely ripped-off from Close Encounters as was a town evacuation scene. There was even a quick utility truck scene driving through the countryside that I would've sworn was from Close Encounters. In fact all of Joe's buddy's are simply knock-off versions of the kids in Stand By Me and, to a lesser extent, Goonies. And I won't ruin the ending but even a certain element of that basically copied E.T.

And I won't even get into actual plot holes with the government agents and the biology teacher as that'd ruin the movie with potential spoilers because if you see it I'd rather you not know everything. But I will say this to all of the 5-star reviewers - after watching this did the kids in any way forward the plot with the alien? IMO they did not - events would've unfolded without them anyways except for one single rescue scene. The main character's(the kids) that were focused on in no way helped or hindered the alien plotline. We could've essentially replaced the kids with a group of rogue monkeys that escaped from a zoo and accidentally recorded the alien. Can't go wrong with monkeys for comedic relief.

Anyways there you go. Sorry for the length of the review - I just wanted to explain why this just didn't work for me and warn you if you're expecting a whimsical, tightly knit action-filled sci-fi film you'll be in for a surprise as that's definitely not what this is. It's a tale of friendship and a coming of age story. With an alien. And that would be fine but it wasn't in any way promoted as such.

Please rent this first before just blindly buying it. And to everyone who loves it, great. I'm not full of hate for this movie, just massive disappointment for what it could have been, based on the previews. My one star rating will be considered harsh as the acting overall was decent and the effects worked, but the overall stuttering plot just didn't do it for me. To me a 5-star film is pretty flawless with the storyline and plot, that's why I'm amazed at all of the 5-stars out there. You truly think this is a perfect film? A masterpiece? You'll return to this over and over again throughout the years like you would with a true, much less original, 5-star film?  I'll just stick with the far superior source material(s) instead of this.

4364092,5,B004EPYZQ2,"I think of myself as extremely lucky to of been a little kid when I was in the 80s. It was the perfect time. I was experiencing first hand the filmmakers (and films) that formed my childhood (Spielberg, Lucas, Zemeckis, Dante, etc.) at the height of their powers. E.T., The Goonies, Back To The Future, Gremlins, Stand By Me, Indiana Jones, Star Wars, The Monster Squad, et al. Movies were magical. Going to them was an event. Standing in line was exciting. They stayed with you, and are still with you today. Sadly, that's been gone for a long time. Sure, there may be a summer blockbuster that's fun, but it doesn't have 'it'. Most are just empty, soulless CGI-fests that won't still be lauded 25 years from now. J.J. Abrams decided to do something about it. Let's get to it.

Set in 1979, we meet Joe, a young boy who just suffered a horrible loss. He lives with his sheriff father (Kyle Chandler) and has a few friends. One night, he and his friends decide to go out and make their own zombie movie. While shooting down by the train tracks, they witness a horrible accident as a truck collides with an oncoming train in a truly spectacular crash. Little do our little friends know that they captured what was in the train's cargo, and mysterious and strange things begin to happen in town. I'll just stop there and let you experience the rest.

""Super 8"" is nostalgic and fun just not for the times, but for the type of filmmaking on display here. Spielbergian shots and lens flares, story over spectacle (although there is that), and real humanistic kids you instantly like, care for, and you want to see what happens to them. Back when kids were kids and they talked and acted like kids, just like those great films of the 80s. It was so refrshing to see this instead of the typical modern kids in movies who like so polished and like they just stepped off of the newest low rated CW show. These kids are from 1979, but I find them more relatable and interesting than anything I have seen in the last decade or more. Obviously, there is an homage to producer Spielberg here, and even though there is that, the film is still it's own movie. The fact that it appears to be a love letter to E.T.'s dad is not a deterrent. It's a great, new, original movie from J.J. wrapped in touches to Spielberg and other films from that era. And what touches. I can't say that I am familiar with Abrams' work. I have never seen anything he has ever done before. I will now! He is a director to be reckoned with here. The love and detail he puts into his scenes, characters, and era the film is set in, is so lovingly detailed. It's quite an accomplishment.

""Super 8"" harks back to a time when these films meant something to the audience. Meant something to the kids. Nowadays, it's all about cartoonish CGI, 3D, and what young adult novels a studio can get their hands on and everything else comes after. Abrams and company were brave to make an original and secretive film and release it in summer. Brave to actually make it with heart, passion, emotion, and characters that actually came first. The ending and eventual outcome may not of been as great as it could of been, but that's okay. With a movie this lovingly skilled and well done in every other place, and the fact they we just got such a film like this in the first place, made up for it for me. It's not going to take away anything from the movie. The acting is top notch. These kids are great. These are the best set of kids I have seen in a movie in a long time. The actors, most of whom have never been in a movie, just shine. Kyle Chandler also does very well in his role. Ron Eldard is also on hand. More brave points to Abrams for casting the movie with no real marquee name star.

""Super 8"" is an exceptional movie that really delivers what I was hoping it would. It's funny, sweet, adventurous, exciting, scary, and interesting. Is it too self indulgent in it's homages of films past? Of course not. A good movie is a good movie however it's told and made. It's a movie that we should embrace and hold dear because it's unlikely we are going to get another movie like this for a long time....if ever. Abrams and his cast and crew should be proud of the film they made. As a child of the 80s, this movie made me feel like a kid again. The first summer blockbuster movie I have seen in eons where I kept thinking about days afterwards. I really don't know what else to say except that ""Super 8"" is a gift.",1315526400,22,4465,4.3437125748503

At times an innocent, slice of life glimpse back at childhood in the very late 1970s, the film's sudden, jolting leaps into completely different genres left me disoriented and on edge for its duration. Mixing equal parts of The Goonies, Cloverfield, ET and Red Dawn in the same blender, the final product admittedly feels a bit blotchy and uneven. Rather than running from the stereotypes inherent in each ingredient, like a cast of minors fleeing a destructive unseen monster, Super 8 wears them boldly on its chest like a badge of honor. In many ways this plays out like a picture from the distant past, more concerned with upping the ante and bringing an excess of action and adventure than delivering any messages beneath the surface. A broad, varied lead cast toes the line between strong characterization and oversharing, while their less-than-stellar supporting characters bring the cheese in lethal doses. It's a fantastic popcorn muncher with a fascinating knack for the unpredictable, but much, much more shallow than anything else in the Abrams catalog.

I know movies like this are not for everyone but for those who have kids inside themselves which are allowed to let their imagination run away for the brief movie time.  There is so much to enjoy about this movie. I wish I was 10 again then my feelings would be age appropriate. I find that sooo many people over analyze stuff today who really need to relax.  This movie is and will be a keeper which will be fun to watch over and over just to see folks jump at certain parts of a really good kids movie! Thanks for reading and to all the negative haters...one word...CHILL!!!",1312761600,4,1347,4.2952755905511815
4364097,3,B004EPYZQ2,"Even though this film was written and directed by J.J. Abrahms, the film oozes with Spielberg-ness. The film centers around a group of kids who have much more insight and wisdom than the adults, much like ET. The military branch of the US Government moves in, trying to hide whats really happening, much like Close Encounter of the Third Kind. And there's a large hulking space creature that I guess is not quite as malicious as the creature from Alien but he's tearing up a small town. As you'll see, some of the creature's victims are treated similarly to Alien.

The film involves a group of kids of junior high school age in 1979 shooting their own zombie-horror flick; one of whom has just lost his mother. The director Charles (played very convincingly by the young and talented Riley Griffiths), a sort of 12-year-old throwback to Orson Welles, replete with pipe, is the obsessed and ambition filmmaker doing everything he can to make a great film. He is constantly speaking of ""production value"". My guess is his character may have been somewhat based on the young Steven Spielberg who pressed his friends into little film projects shot with his super-8 camera back in the 1950's. The two other characters which emerge as the main focus are Joe Lamb (Joel Courtney) and Alice Dainard (Elle Fanning) two people thrust together because of their involvement with the film project who become somewhat intimate in a way that only 12-year-old's can. A supporting character of note has to be Cary, played by Ryan Lee, who carries around fire crackers just to make the older folk cringe.

The group is shooting a scene at a train station with the boy main character and the only girl in the movie. Their production literally becomes derailed by a train wreck which obliterates everything in sight, not to mention the station, although the super-8 camera which continued to film was surprisingly untouched! Of course, this is not just a train derailment: the whole train looks like it was in the middle of the front lines in WWII. A man in a busted up pick-up, looking half-dead, who may have intentionally derailed the train, tells the kids to run for their lives. The kids escape in their car, which was also surprisingly untouched, before the military guys show up with flash-lights and guns.

The story then moves on several fronts: the mystery of the train wreck, Charles' obsession with completing his movie, and the relationship between Joe and Alice and their parents. Eventually, when more of the mystery is revealed, the film becomes largely about a kind of reconciliation between the two kids and their parents. At a certain point, the movie-making aspect takes a back seat to the relationships of the two kids and the two adults. It seemed like Charles, the director, at one point, seems more like a supporting character.

Although I definitely enjoyed this film, largely because of the believability of the kids which is first-rate by any standard, I was frustrated on a couple of points. I thought the movie was trying to do too many things given its parameters. To me, the relationship between the two main kid characters and their parents distracted away from the really interesting idea about the kids trying to make their movie. Also, I thought there would be a lot more about the footage which was gotten at the train wreck.

The one character who I felt was slightly under-developed was Charles, the kid director. His screen time was sacrificed in order to develop more about the adult relationships, which I found less interesting, some of which seemed just a touch clich. I wanted to know more about Charles, why he was shooting his films and other information. Only late in the film do we learn more about him and why he was engaging in this project.

Two stories which are very similar to this film, Spielberg's ET and Stephen King's IT, focus almost exclusively on the kids, who they are, and what they are trying to accomplish. If a story begins about a group of kids, I think it is better for the story to stay on them rather getting off on tangents. Super-8 started out that way, but then took a bit of a side turn and focused more on a couple of the adult characters. I was sort of expecting the kids to be on the lead and in the forefront for most of the story, and I wanted them to be the ones who solve the mystery without intervention from dear-old dad. Still, a very enjoyable movie, and the acting is first-rate to take you all the way. One surprise is at the end during the credits, which was actually my favorite part of the film, but I won't give it away!",1312588800,3,4592,4.669962917181706

How so? Well imagine the ideas used in Scooby Doo, the Goonies, the Monster Squad and countless other franchises of young kids working together to overcome a supernatural force and that's pretty close to what Super 8 is all about.

Once again, it seems JJ Abrams can do no wrong, and with Mr Spielberg involved too - this film is as close to perfect as you will find this summer.

If you like this kind of thing, I might also suggest you check out the following two books: Department 19 by Will Hill, and the Dusk Society by Campfire Graphic Novels.",1312070400,3,611,4.389380530973451
4364099,5,B004EPYZQ2,"I saw the trailers for Super 8 in theater when I watched other movies in theater. When I saw the glimpses, even with some of the earlier trailers, I found myself reminded about a good deal of the Anime I've seen for the Sci-Fi and/or Horror genre. Particularly the ones that happened to touch upon the scientific technology only slightly, and the horror is minute. The draw for these Anime is the actual storyline and the characters. Normally I find myself not interested in watching American movies for this genre, but when I saw the trailers, I found myself wanting to watch the movies at least once.

When the movie popped up on the big screen , I found that my comparisons to the Anime I like from those two genre was not far off at all. While the subject of ""the thing"" and other scientific elements crop up in the movie, not to mention there are a few times I felt a slight terror running through my mind, I felt that it wasn't over done. Instead, the movie focused on the characters and the plot line. I found myself drawn into the whole thing.

The characters came to life in my mind. Each of the children in their group had their own distinct personalities. There are also quite a bit of growing up issues presented within the movie, dealt with in a believable fashion. There is also the issue with dealing with parents that are over bearing. The movie is one of those that one should watch at least once, despite the fact that Spielberg does over do the detail when it comes to certain things, but that only adds to the fantastical element in the story. Not to mention it is expected of his work.

I got what I expected out of the movie. There was a great plot, a nice romance story that came across as  believable, not to mention age appropriate was also in there. The story line had quite a few cliches in it, but in the long run the plot flowed smoothly from beginning to end. It has some similarities to one of his earlier work of E.T, but the story fits more into the time frame.",1312070400,3,1994,4.337801608579088

J.J. Abrams' ""Super 8"" hearkens back to the days of early Steven Spielberg (who co-produced the film) - a time when summer blockbusters could appeal as much to the heart as to the eye, when a group of intrepid suburban kids could unravel mysteries and take on evil forces, when the military-industrial complex was clearly up to no good, and when tear-stained characters could look in wide-eyed, tight-shot amazement at wonders unraveling above them in the heavens.

Set, appropriately, in 1979 - in a time before digital cameras and CGI technology, when children had to express their creativity and imagination with what was then the technological equivalent of chewing gum and baling wire - ""Super 8"" centers on a group of nerdish preteens who are attempting to make their own amateur zombie-splatter film for an upcoming contest. While filming one night, the kids are witness to a horrifying freight train crash, the repercussions of which go far beyond just the mass of mangled, twisted metal strewn across the area. For it seems the Air Force has taken a more than casual interest in the event, and soon strange and inexplicable occurrences begin happening in town.

The focal point of the story is Joe Lamb (Joel Courtney), a young boy whose mother has just been killed in a tragic factory accident, and whose grieving father (Kyle Chandler from TV's incomparable ""Friday Night Lights"") serves as the town's deputy. Joe also has a crush on the pretty and alluring Alice Dainard (Elle Fanning), who has been brought into the boys' film project at the last moment.

The similarities between ""Super 8"" and any number of Spielberg - or at least Spielbergian - films (most notably, of course, ""E.T."") are both so numerous and so obvious that they really don't bear repeating here. Yet, while I admire much of what Abrams is trying to do in this movie, so much of it falls flat that I really can't recommend it in the final analysis. What's actually missing is that special Spielberg touch, that almost Quixotic visionary conviction that could turn even a simple work like ""E.T."" into a timeless classic. One never questions Spielberg's belief in his material, but I'm not sure one can quite make the same claim about Abrams, at least not in this particular instance. Abrams' story lacks the streamlined clarity of an ""E.T."" and, by extension, the emotional resonance that comes along with it. ""Super 8"" seems to be going off in so many different directions at once that it winds up going nowhere. And, frankly, the sci-fi aspects of the story feel awfully stale at this late stage in the game.

In addition to ""E.T.,"" there are bits and pieces of ""The Goonies,"" ""Stand By Me,"" ""Gremlins,"" and ""War of the Worlds"" in the film as well. And that, in the final analysis, is what's most wrong with ""Super 8."" It's made up of so many borrowed parts that, in the end, it's left with nothing it can truly call its own.",1310947200,7,2917,4.768316831683168
4364101,4,B004EPYZQ2,"Every now and then, a film comes along and reminds you of the way it used to be. Back in the eighties, blockbusters were made with heart. Everything from the acting to the direction was top-notch, especially if the film in question was a Spielberg film. Steven Spielberg is one of the best film directors in the industry. His love of the medium shines in just about every project that he has been a part of. Some of the most influential films of the past have his name attached to them, namely E.T., Close Encounters of the Third Kind, and Jurassic Park. He deals with fantastical themes with a heartfelt, childlike curiosity - a definite trademark that appears in many of his films. Recently, director J.J. Abrams made a film which can be seen as a love letter to Spielberg. This film is `Super 8', and it is one of the best offerings of the summer, as well as one of the best films of the year. And, for those of you who have followed me over the past two years, the mere fact that I am glowing over a mainstream blockbuster is nothing short of a miracle.

The film opens in Lillian, Ohio in 1979, and follows a group of close-knit boys during summer break, as they attempt to film a zombie flick with a Super 8 camera. Young Joe Lamb has recently lost his mother in a steel mill accident, and as a way to cope with his loss, he vows to help his best friend, the film-obsessed Charles, complete his latest cinematic masterpiece. Together with three other boys, and his latest crush, Alice, Joe slowly begins a journey of self-discovery. Everything changes one night during a film shoot, when the boys witness, and barely manage to escape, a horrific train wreck. The kids flee the site, as the U.S. Air Force arrives.

This leads to strange phenomena in the town; pets running away from their owners, the disappearance of car engines and power lines, and people being abducted. Soon after, the boys discover some disturbing footage which was caught during the train crash, while the camera was still rolling film. Something crawls up out the wreckage, and dashes out of the frame. The boys decide to delve into the mystery themselves, and the adventure begins.

The performances in this film are amazing, especially from newcomer Joel Courtney, Riley Griffiths, and Elle Fanning. Each delivers an incredibly genuine performance, and I was blown away by the raw energy displayed on screen. The direction is perfect, with splashes of J.J. Abrams idol, Spielberg, splashed about the screen in nearly every frame. The musical score is magical. The mystery is involving. It all makes for an excellent time at the theatre, and will make you long for the days when summer blockbusters had a soul. With strong messages of hope and forgiveness, it is also one of the most touching films to come out in a while.

The movie seems to have been heavily influenced by ET and while it's not completely fair to make the connection, the movie would have been better served had it taken some lessons from the classic. I enjoyed the developing relationship between Joe and Alice who find a connection based on their difficult family circumstances and it was a pleasure watching these two young actors, as well as the other supporting character child roles. Unfortunately the movie fails miserably on three counts. One, the ""bad guy"", a military commander, is the same standard two-dimensional, typical cardboard cut out baddie that we've seen a gazillion times before. Two, the movie attempts to have the audience feel empathetic to a creature-character in the film, but fails to invest in any meaningful attachments that had to happen between it and the children. In fact, scenes were chosen that actually work against the emotional buildup that's required to appreciate the ending, instead you could really care less. I've seen ET nearly three dozen times in the last 25 years and it never fails to bring moisture to my eyes in the final moments of the film while your heart is breaking because of the character bond's established in the film - there is none of that here. Third, special effects and action scenes are fun to watch, (the train wreck scene is pretty cool, I'm not going to lie) but it would have been better to put more emphasis on story and character than on sequences that seemed pointless or were drawn out too long. Overall, I was marginally entertained, but felt let down given the pedigree of the talent behind the film - as if God was resting on the Sabbath day.",1310428800,2,1840,4.825949367088608

The abilities of the creature are ill-defined; it just seems to be able to do whatever is convenient for the plot.  The naturalistic kids become unconvincing action movie heroes.

Maybe part of it was the navel-gazing aspect of a movie made about tweenage movie-makers, as if someone was trying to write an autobiography the way it should have been. Maybe it was the triteness of anthropophagy - as if earthly proteins would do anything for a visitor from elsewhere. Maybe ... well it doesn't matter.

What I really love the most about writer/director J.J. Abrams' new film Super 8 (2011) is how it made me so fondly reminisce and wax nostalgic for the great, but sometimes a bit ""cheesy"" (in hindsight), movies I grew up loving in the 1980s. Like The Goonies (1985), E.T.: The Extra Terrestrial (1982), Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977), Explorers (1985), and even Stand By Me (1986).  Abrams has woven together a good story here about five childhood friends who love hanging out and making movies...at least when they're not quarreling and making fun of each other. It's an homage to himself and executive director Steven Spielberg (and many more of us), who grew up much like these kids, making their own homemade movies. Set in the 1970s, the kids especially like making zombie and horror movies, recording them on their own Super 8mm film camera with a microphone taped to the end of a broomstick ""boom"". These boys are all geeks and misfits, like we all really were when we were their age. Come on...admit it...you were an awkward kid too!

With legendary writer/director/producer Spielberg on board this project as both producer and ""Godfather"", you kind of knew something magical, and a bit cheesy, would happen in this film. I just wish it was a bit more magical in the story and character development, and less magical in the visual effects, lens flare, and alien aspects. Don't get me wrong, I liked all of that stuff, and I think Super 8 is one of the best movies I've seen so far this year. But I also can't help feeling that the third act of the film fell apart. I think once the ""Area 51 Surprise"" is introduced visually, the film gets weaker. And the fun relationships and bonds that the five boys have, along with their girl crush addition to the group (played by Elle Fanning), kind of melts. Still, there is a lot to love in this summer blockbuster. For one, it's original material that isn't based on a comic book or toy, and it isn't a sequel or remake. Super 8 seems to be the Inception of this year. It's smart, stylistic, and filled with cool visual effects and a great ensemble cast that gives excellent performances. Kudos to Abrams for a well-written script...at least for most of the movie.

The first act of the film brings with it some of the best performances by a group of kids I've seen in awhile. All five of the boys, led by newcomer Joel Courtney, create an energetic group dynamic that allows each to feed off the other...snapping sarcastic and sharp dialogue that definitely made me feel like a kid again. And paradoxically feel both the awkwardness and greatness of that time in my life. Kyle Chandler, as the single widowed father of Joel's character Joe, and the police officer who gets to the bottom of the train wreck and it's supernatural circumstances, delivers a solid performance that gels the focus on family built into Abrams script. The same can be said for the supporting role played by Ron Eldard as the single alcoholic father of Elle's character Alice. The entire cast of Super 8 feels right and supports Abrams very strongly in bringing the script to life.

One of director J.J. Abrams strengths is bringing together an incredible crew of talented artists and technicians who create productions of the highest quality. While the rumored budget for Super 8 was only $50 million, this movie looks and feels like a $100 million plus production. The production design, cinematography, music, sound, and visual effects are all well executed and support the story perfectly. I felt completely transported back to the 1970s, or at least to my imagination of what the 70s was like. The sets, costumes, props, and everything else in the production design (led by Production Designer Martin Whist) gave the film that historic feel that I just love in the movies. There's something about going to the movies and escaping into a different time, whether in the past or the future, that always works for me. And when its done well, I really appreciate it.

Director of Photography Larry Fong, known for his work on 300 (2006) and the TV show Lost, provides some stunning cinematography that literal had me gasping for air in awe. While I'm not a HUGE fan of Abrams' now signature lens flare look that he started with his remake of Star Trek (2009), it works up until I started noticing it too much...same as in Star Trek. I'm hoping that Abrams' learns that less is more sometimes, and lens flares can be great when used in the right places to support the story, but can be annoying when they BECOME the story. While I didn't overly notice the music by composer Michael Giacchino, I also didn't feel like any music was missing at crucial points during the movie. I would definitely like to listen to the Super 8 score again and focus on it because I think there were some good pieces of music throughout the movie. The sound design and sound editing was outstanding on Super 8. The dialogue was dead on and all of the explosions, gunfire, and other special events that I expected to feel from the sound of the movie worked well.

The bottom line is that Super 8 is the summer blockbuster to go see in my humble opinion so far this year. While I haven't yet seen any of the many superhero or comic book movies that have filled the screens the last two months, I do know that I really enjoyed Super 8 on the big screen. It's the kind of popcorn movie that I grew up loving and looking forward to. I love going to the theater for a clever, original film like this one. Super 8 starts as an outstanding film (4.5 stars) but ends as just a good film (3 stars). So I've given it an initial rating of 3.5 stars. It's one of those movies I wanna watch again at home on blu-ray to see if it gets better the next time. It may just be a 4 star film for me eventually, but for now it's at least locked in as one of the best movies of 2011, likely to find a place on my Top 10 at year's end.",1309996800,2,5950,4.533519553072626
4364107,5,B004EPYZQ2,"J.J. Abrams has not made a lot of films, but each film has been very good, embracing the genre and giving fans something to celebrate. Even ""Mission Impossible III"", derided because of Cruise's shenanigans, was very good, better than the first two installments. But each film has been a stepping stone. Considering the quality of these films, the possibility of a filmmaker of Abrams' skill and caliber working on a personal project has been tantalizing.

Now, with ""Super 8"", Abrams makes a film based on his own idea. He blends all of his superlative filmmaking skills with a personal story and the effort is almost magical. ""Super 8"" is by far the best film I have seen this year. And it will take a lot for a new film to take this position away. It just may end up as the best film of the year.

Set in small town Ohio, in 1979, a group of kids gets together to make a film using their super 8 cameras. Originally a zombie film, the director, Charles (Riley Griffiths), a pudgy kid from a large, noisy family, decides his magnum opus needs more drama, so he enlists the help of Alice (Elle Fanning), who his friend and cameraman, Joe (Joel Courtney) has a crush on. The whole group sneaks out at midnight and heads to the local train station. As a train approaches, Charles shouts for the crew to get ready, he wants to capture the ""production value"" of the train speeding by. But a truck soon appears and begins driving directly for the locomotive. The kids watch in horror as the truck crashes into the train and the whole thing derails. They run for their lives, trying to escape the carnage. As the dust begins to clear, they realize there have been no injuries amongst them and run off just as ominous government agencies begin to arrive to do the clean-up. Charles and Joel also find the camera. It is broken, but they decide to develop the film anyway. Over the next few days, Joel's dad, Jackson, the Sheriff (Kyle Chandler) begins to realize something strange is going on; dogs begin to disappear, then his boss is missing, then the government steps in and gives him a story about the train wreck. Jackson confronts Nelec (Noah Emmerich), the leader of the army's 'clean-up' efforts. Just as the rumors begin to fly, and stories of mysterious sightings begin to circulate, the town is evacuated because of a wild fire. Joel and his friends try to escape to figure out what is going on.

From the moment ""Super 8"" begins, you know you are in for something special. Abrams sets the film in 1979 which also seems to be a homage to the sort of film his mentor, and producer of the film, Steven Spielberg made during the same period. Everything about the film seems authentic and real. People are wearing new Walkmans. The clothes and cars are all period specific. The attitudes are even a little more innocent. Even better, when Abrams decides to feature some new-fangled item, like the Walkman, for instance, it becomes a part of the story. This takes the moment from being a simple wink-wink nudge-nudge type of thing and shows how clever Abrams really is. It is very easy to make a visual reference like this. It is much more difficult to make it a believable part of the story. Abrams always does the more difficult and makes it work.

Charles is part of a large, noisy family who seems to be bursting out of the walls of their house. Yet, there is always room for Joe at the table. Joe and Charles are best friends and this helps to make the film seem even a little more nostalgic. In fact, there seem to be more similarities in this film to Spielberg's ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" than to the oft-mentioned ""E.T."". Charles large family and their crowded dinner table are similar to the Neary family's. At one point, an electrician is fixing a power line. He stands in the bucket on his truck and rises toward the junction box. Roy Neary was also an electrician who is trying to fix massive power outages. ""Close Encounters"" is set in Indiana, ""Super 8"" in Ohio, Both feature people from small town America dealing with something they could never have imagined.

The real key to the success of ""Super 8"" is the kids. Everyone of them gives a good performance and really raises the bar for future child actors. Joel Courtney plays Joe, the son of the local Sheriff. A family tragedy puts a strain on the relationship between the two and Joe escapes the pressures of his everyday life with his large group of friends. Courtney is just so natural, so at ease, he never seems like he is acting. He deals with his grief, with his dad, with the drama in his town like anyone his age would. They escape into the making of their film. Joe is also extremely nervous when Charles announces he has asked Alice to act in the film because he has a huge crush on Alice and becomes a bit tongue-tied. Joe becomes the hero of the film, fighting every inch of the way to find out what is going on and then fighting to end the problem. It is a very good, richly observed performance. More amazing, this is Joel Courtney's first film.

Riley Griffiths plays Charles, the director of the film the kids are working on. It is difficult to tell for sure, but I will bet that this character is closely modeled after Abrams when he was a kid. Charles is a funny guy; his face always buried in a movie magazine, thinking of new scenes, new ideas to make their film that much better. He has clearly read everything he could possibly get his hands on and relishes every bit of it, even the stuff he doesn't completely understand. At the train station, he walks around framing the picture with his hands; he seems obsessed with capturing 'production values', like the real train passing. When they retrieve the camera after the wreck, they take the film to the local photo shop and send it away to be processed. His performance is funny, but not overly jokey; he is just a normal kid who loves everything about filmmaking. More amazing, this is Riley Griffith's first film as well.

Elle Fanning, the veteran of the group, is very good. Alice seems intrigued to be involved in the film, but she is also asked to help provide the transportation for the group, which puts her on edge when the Sheriff's son shows up. She doesn't have a driver's license and is afraid of getting into trouble. But Joe quickly puts her at ease. When they arrive at the train station, they are all amazed by her acting ability. Throughout the course of the film, she and Joe spend a lot of time together and become closer and their relationship provides many sweet innocent moments to the film.

The rest of the kids are all great. Each is different, fun and unique.

Kyle Chandler does a great job as Jackson, the man who is a Sheriff first and a dad to Joe second. He quickly realizes something is going on and becomes even more determined to figure things out when he meets Nelec and realizes they aren't telling him the whole truth. His town is experiencing something big, and it consumes him, so it takes him a while to realize his son is getting into mischief. But when he does, he quickly puts a stop to it. Then he becomes busy again, leaving Joe to his own devices. The relationship between the two is not good, and hasn't been good for a long time. Then, the family tragedy only pulls them further apart. Chandler does a very good job of showing us all of the different responsibilities Jackson is dealing with.

Toby Emmerich adds another shady government/ villain-type role to his resume. The role is good, believable and suitable for the story. But the character actor has played this role before, many times.

Ron Eldard plays Louis, Alice's no-good dad. Louis is haunted by many demons and adds complexity to the film.

The real beauty of ""Super 8"" is that Abrams is simply a great filmmaker. He seems determined to make films in which he reveals as little as possible about the creature/ monster/ alien/ threat to the main characters as possible. In ""Cloverfield"", a film he helped write and produce, the threat is viewed in brief snippets, often in grainy cell phone or camcorder footage. For the majority of the film, you never see it fully. This does two things. It makes the menace more believable and it creates more suspense. Because we can't see the whole thing, we are less likely to find fault in it, or to disbelieve in the existence of it. Also, because the threat is revealed in small, fleeting moments, we are never sure when it will show up. I know some people don't like this film, but the cinema verite style, the unknown cast and the snippets of footage of the creature all served to create a memorable monster film.

Abrams continues this same sort of idea in ""Super 8"". The threat to this small town is not revealed for a long time. But to maintain suspense, we see bits of what it can cause. Joe watches through small, high windows as things fly into the air. The electrician watches things happening in a maintenance building in the distance. Even when we are placed close to the action, Abrams uses some fairly brilliant methods to hide the identity of the threat.

When everything starts to fall into place and we realize what is going on, it all makes sense and we are committed to the ride because we have spent so much time in this universe, with these characters.

It is also unusual (unfortunately) for a summer film to capture any emotion, let alone anything that could seem real and move us. In ""Super 8"", Abrams sets up the story with a sad event, which helps to inform us of the relationship between Joe and Jackson. And throughout the story, we see how strained their life together is, how difficult. And this all leads to a very emotional moment, which I confess, made me tear up.

Ultimately, ""Super 8"" has moments that are funny, scary, suspenseful, exciting, dramatic and more. It has everything. Better yet, everything seems necessary to the characters and the story.

A couple of weeks before the film was released, I watched the trailer for ""Super 8"" before another highly anticipated summer film. After the trailer, someone mumbled ""E.T., phone home"" causing some laughter. But this remark is more of a compliment than a dig. Abrams has captured the same sort of innocence, the same sort of wonder Elliot and his brother and sister experience in ""E.T."" And because of this, he captures the same sort of innocence, the same sort of wonder for us to relive.

If it sounds like I am gushing, I am. Go see this movie. Go. Go already.",1309910400,4,10458,4.547821466524973
4364108,4,B004EPYZQ2,"Super 8 is admittedly not a perfect film, but I enjoyed it so much, and was so taken by the characters and the actors playing them, that I didn't really mind the occasional inconsistency or lingering ""awed expressions"" scene.

Set in a small town in Ohio in 1979, the basic plot centers around Joe Lamb (Joel Courtney), a 13-year-old boy whose mother recently died in a factory accident, leaving him with only his father, Jackson (Kyle Chandler), a sheriff's deputy who's a more than decent man but who has never known how to really be a father. Jackson's escape is burying himself in his work, while Joe's is helping his best friend Charles (Riley Griffiths) make an amateur zombie movie with the help of their other friends Preston (Zach Mills), Martin (Gabriel Basso) and Cary (Ryan Lee). But Joe's involvement becomes truly committed when Charles persuades Alice Dainard (Elle Fanning), a girl he secretly has a crush on, to join the project.

Things taken a sudden turn when, in the midst of shooting a midnight scene at the local railroad depot, Joe sees a pickup truck suddenly drive onto the tracks, directly in the path of an oncoming freight train, resulting in a spectacular crash that sends freight cars derailing everywhere and the shocked kids running for cover. The plot quickly thickens when Joe gets a glimpse of something bursting out of one of the freight cars, and when they find the driver of the pickup, badly injured, is Dr. Woodward (Glynn Turman), their biology teacher, who warns them to get away and to never speak of what they've seen to anyone or they - and their parents - will be killed. And then there's the knocked over Super 8 camera that has been continuing to roll throughout everything, capturing something that no one else saw while they were busy tried not to get crushed by flying debris. Something that will become important later as strange things begin to happen:  dogs fleeing the town for no apparent reason, car engines and other pieces of machinery being stolen, people suddenly disappearing. And of course the massive influx of military personnel who are crawling all over everything while their commander, Col. Nelec (Noah Emmerich) blandly insists that there's _nothing_ going on.

The characters are well drawn, fleshed out with real personalities, quirks and flaws, and you very quickly come to care about them.  And the actors, most of them either fairly unknown or newcomers, are marvelous, the kids in particular as they're at the heart of the film, but also the adults, particularly Kyle Chandler and Ron Eldard as the two fathers linked - and separated - by tragedy, each not doing so well at dealing with it. Joel Courtney as Joe has one of those faces that projects everything he's feeling, from the distance he's experiencing with his dad to the secret yet painfully obvious crush he has on Alice. Riley Griffiths as his best friend Charles is a perfect counterpoint, pursuing his film with single-minded determination but holding other things in. Ryan Lee's pint-sized braces-laden (and explosives-crazy) Cary is a riot, as is Gabriel Basso's Martin as the zombie film's leading man who has an unfortunate tendency to puke a lot, while Zach Mills' Preston has the healthiest fear-instinct of the crowd. And last but not least, Elle Fanning's Alice is a wonder, a sensitive girl with her own father issues whose unexpected natural talent at acting leaves the boys with their jaws hanging.

Super 8 is highly derivative, but in a good way. It draws on the best parts of any number of movies from the past, most notably E.T. (1982) and The Goonies (1985) but also films like Joe Dante's Explorers (1985) , The Bad News Bears (1976) and, more recently, Son of Rambow (2007), a little seen but marvelous independent British film about a couple of boys with family issues who bond over making an amateur movie.

Note:  in one scene, there's a definite tip-of-the-hat prop taken right out of Spielberg's E.T.  Just keep your eyes peeled when the camera closes in on the water tower near the climax of the movie and see if anything looks strikingly familiar.

There are admittedly weak points in the film, mainly where it seems uncertain of just which direction it wants to take or where inconsistencies tend to be glaring. Is the alien dangerous and deadly... or just misunderstood? Is the alien killing people... or just holding on to them for a while?  The trouble is that in different parts of the film it's definitely one, but in other parts of the film it's the other.  And the climactic lingering ""awed expressions"" scene does feel at odds with the the life-threatening dangers the characters were experiencing earlier (not to mention the burning shambles half the town has been reduced to). Another weak point is the villain, Col. Nelec (I suspect the name Nelec is an in-joke of some kind), who is never anything but a cliched military bad guy.  But as I said, while these things do keep it from being a perfect film, they don't in the end get in the way from it being an engaging and enjoyable one.

Highly recommended for anyone who likes an engaging film that sucks you in and keeps you involved all the way through, and that values story and character over special effects and stars.",1309737600,283,5249,4.7984496124031
4364109,4,B004EPYZQ2,"I keep seeing this compared to Goonies & ET. It's got it's similarities but it differs radically, and these differences may mean that it's not a good movie choice for kids. I'll explain below, plus here's the pros and cons of this movie:

Pros:

1. The acting is phenomenal. The kids are just amazing. Each of them was absolutely believable and brought depth to their characters. I could totally relate to several of the kids. The adults were good as well, but they really weren't featured and developed enough to make a huge difference.

2. The production value was amazing. What else would you expect from a Speilberg movie! The action sequences were riveting.

3. The 1979 setting was very authentic and fun. Since I was around in that time period, it was great to see.

4. The relationships between the kids were so well developed, and the main kids individual characters were beautifully written for and developed. This was what made the movie worthwhile.

5. As in Goonies and ET, the kids are the heroes in this movie. They're the ones who know the truth and act on it for good. They're pure of heart, resourceful, determined and put themselves at risk to act like heroes.

Cons:

1. This had a horror movie feel. There was plenty of violence, and it was scary. This movie is not for young kids. Those who don't like horror should avoid this movie. Granted most of it wasn't explicitly gory, but there was some blood and plenty of people died violently. There are many moments designed to shock, startle and scare you. Though it's rated PG-13, I'd say it feels closer to an R rating to me.

2. If you're looking for a feel good alien like in ET, it's not here. The audience is not given much of a chance to emotionally connect with the alien. It's ugly, scary, violent and mysterious. I don't want to give anything away, but this is not a feel good, cuddle the alien, cute movie similar to ET. You may still enjoy this flick, but go in with the right expectations.

3. There are tons of holes in the movie. There are many questions that are never answered, and a couple featured characters that are never fully explained. I don't always mind holes in movie lines if the movie is entertaining, but in this movie it was hard to ignore.

4. The story line just wasn't that original. Take a bunch of different movies, put them in a jug and shake them together and you get this movie. I don't always mind a repeated story line if it's entertaining or moving, but this was just okay for me.

So I'd say that if you like horror, this movie may be for you, though you may be disappointed with the lack of explicit gore. If you like scifi, this movie may be somewhat satisfying, but it probably won't be in your top 20. If you like coming of age movies, you'll love the story lines around the kids. If you love special effects, there are some good ones here. This movie is definitely not for young kids or for anyone who shouldn't be viewing horror.

I'd say this is a video to rent on DVD. Then if you love it, buy it.",1309737600,32,3017,4.414414414414415
4364110,5,B004EPYZQ2,"Can you say, ""E.T."" meets ""E.T.""?  Arguably the most E.T. like movie of all time, Super 8 starts up with a bang and runs through every trick in the ET playbook before the first hour is up, then goes back in again and again to expand on the one thing it knows.  That thing is the essential mystery of childhood and how, once we become adults, we lose our innate understanding of aliens from other planets.  Happily for movie buffs, Super 8 tells the story of six brave kids teetering on the brink of adolescence, and sets the story in the late 1970s so we can all identify, even the middle-aged like me.  E.T. showed us a family led by a mother and father, but Super 8 presents the children at risk because their mothers have been snatched away from them by a cruel factory death.  Reading between the lines, smart viewers will notice that only one mother remains, and she is played by Jessica Tuck, the vampire spokesperson from True Blood--what's that saying about motherhood?  I have no idea, but I'm sure that Steven Spielberg's casting is always saying something pertinent, unlike his scripts.  (Next up, Lincoln with Daniel Day Lewis as Abe, and Sally Field, short, sixtyish and moonfaced, as weird Mary Todd.  Everyone's wondering, will Anne Hathaway play Anne Hathaway, Lincoln's first love?)

Knowledge is power, summer films say, yet in Super 8 this harmless dictum is severely smashed.  In tracing the fate of the one roll of Super 8 film that accidentally records a horrific train wreck, director JJ Abrams convinces us that somehow this footage, which incidentally shows a monster rising from the wreckage, is going to be important in the denouement.  Like Hitchcock's McGuffins, the footage is presented pictorially as a matter of great consequence, and in addition it becomes a matter about which we the audience know more than the kids on screen.  Lo and behold, absolutely nothing of consequence occurs with this footage and we feel cheated, like children without a mother.  It's a great movie, even with that awful instant nostalgia factor suffusing the whole thing like air freshener.  Aliens with the minds of kids: will Hollywood, will Spielberg, ever abandon this theme?  Not on this earth.",1309392000,3,2211,4.843085106382978
4364111,3,B004EPYZQ2,"Ah yes, the 70s and 80s days of cutesy Spielberg sensibilities. Basically that's what you get here with J.J. Abrams latest installment. And why not? Steven gave his blessings and executive produced as well. But somehow I think Steven did much more than just produce. The films feels so Stevenish you'd think he held Abrams hand all through the production. You get the usual dose of Spielbergisms with the cute early adolescent kids who act twice as mature and smart as REAL kids of that age.

The film focuses on a group of kids in 1979 making a Super 8 zombie film (obviously inspired not by Steven but George Romero) and then get caught up in a government conspiracy involving a benign but very pissed-off extraterrestrial that the military has held prisoner for over 20 years. The kids witness the train wreck that causes it's escape and their peaceful little Ohio town experiences all sorts of mayhem.

Aside from the typical monster-on-the-loose plot, the film does have some good character developement. The characters, both adults and teens, are well drawn out. Touching on issues such as loss of family members, alienation with parents, a little puberty thrown in and you have all the makings of a warm and fuzzy drama Spielberg style. The only problem is as said before, these kids act just too mature for their age. When I was this age in the 70s, me and everybody else were just plain stupid. And we certainly didn't open ourselves up to each other like they do here.

All in all, the film is entertaining escapism for the summer season. While not a classic measuring up to the likes of Close Encounters of the Third Kind or E.T., I think J.J. can chalk up another winner with this one. After all, he got help from the master of the cutes himself.",1309392000,40,1758,4.646302250803859

4364143,4,B004EPYZQ2,"**** May be mini spoilers below ****

I realized a few minutes into this movie that my family and I really had no clue what it was about.  But, I am really glad we went to see it.  The movie is really about a government secrete that comes back to bite this town in the ass.  There is a train that is transporting cretin items.  They have to do with something that government got and did in the late 50s early 60s.  These kids are making a movie for some sort of festival.  They are right by some train tracks.  One boy sees a car go on the tracks, in front of the train.  The train crashes and these things are exposed.  One of the boys takes one of the items.  Soon after things in the town start getting weird.  The power keeps blinking out, the animals run away and people start to die and or go missing.  It may sound simple and it actually is.  Which makes the movie so great.

The graphics and or 3D effects look amazing.  But the great thing is, they did do it TO many times.  Even the creatures that come to do what they come to do are mysterious.  You do get to see them, BUT, it seems like every time you see one, you only see a part of it, or there is a lot of smoke or something else around to impair your vision of the creature.  They could have over did the things.  Making you see the entire thing over and over and over again.  The fact that they did not, makes the movie even better.  You really get the feeling that your watching a movie from the 70s or 80s when you are watching the film.  It had a very E.T. feel.  Also, the kids in the movie are amazing.  When I looked them up on IMDB, I was shocked at their ages.  Some amazing acting by great actors.  They really made the movie.  When you leave the theater or turn the TV off you will have a lot of answers.  But it may even put a few questions in your mind as well.  I am really excited about getting this on blu ray when it is released.  I will get to share it with my whole family.

One last thing.  I am 26 and this movie really made me feel like I was 8 years old.  I felt the same way I did when I walked out of E.T.  Go see the movie.  It will make you feel great.",1309219200,5,2146,3.897911832946636

4364145,5,B004EPYZQ2,"Super 8 began last year with a marketing campaign that provided a general idea of what to expect from the film while revealing nothing. As the trailers became only slightly more revealing, the comparisons to Spielberg began. It's no secret that Steven Spielberg produced the film, so this comparison may seem easy but it is an inarguable fact that this film would not exist without his influence. Super 8 is the offspring of films like Close Encounters of the Third Kind, E.T., and The Goonies but it never feels like a derivative cash-in and actually succeeds in taking moviegoers back to a time when the ""summer blockbuster"" meant something; a time when a good story went hand-in-hand with special effects and action sequences. There are two types of movies here and writer/director J.J. Abrams does a refreshing job balancing them both rather than letting the action overtake the story. Its adolescent characters, military villains, and late 70s, small town setting evoke memories of Spielberg but writer/director J.J. Abrams brings enough originality to the project that it's less of a rehash than a renaissance.

The film takes place in the fictional town of Lillian, Ohio in 1979. 13-year-old Joe Lamb (Joel Courtney in an impressive debut) is helping his group of friends make a Super 8 movie at an old train depot. To the group's enjoyment, the ""director"" Charles (Riley Griffiths) has convinced local girl Alice (Elle Fanning) to drive them to the depot and appear in the movie. As they're shooting, a train appears in the distance and, in moments, is derailed by a pickup truck....And, for the purpose of preserving the surprise element; I'll leave it at that.

Is the ""secret"" at the heart of the film really a secret anymore? Most people have enough information to deduce what's going on, but the less you know the better. It's all part of the effect Super 8 has. There are plenty of special effects and action sequences, but Abrams allows his film to build nicely before revealing what he has in store. Unlike most recent summer blockbusters, the action is never brainless; it serves a purpose and functions for the story as opposed to an excuse to show the advancements in technology. The first big special effects sequence is the train crash, which is one of the most intense, exciting sequences you're likely to come across this year. You may question the physics behind it, but you can't deny the heart-racing excitement it inspires nor can you deny the stunning special effects that made it possible.

Super 8 really succeeds where most summer movies fail by delivering strong writing, with a good story and well-developed characters in addition to all the action. While Abrams may go for easy emotional cues his story has a lot of heart and Super 8 succeeds extensively on its likable, well-defined characters and human story. The story never feels like a backdrop for the action, a practice Hollywood has inexplicably embraced recently. Abrams obviously has an eye for casting as well. The adolescent actors in the lead roles are a talented, funny, and emotive group that convincingly embody their characters and never seem amateurish or annoying. The adult actors do fine jobs too, but the adults aren't as well-defined as the children are. Joe's dad, Deputy Jackson Lamb (Kyle Chandler) is the anguished, withdrawn father who steps in when things get messy while Colonel Nelec (Noah Emmerich) is the typical stone-faced military villain. This is a minor flaw that doesn't affect the overall quality of the film. Finally, it captures the 1979, small-town vibe wonderfully adding a very ""classic feel"" and is a great looking film in general; moody, nostalgic, and, yes, ""Spielbergian.""

Super 8 does not disappoint on any level and is what a summer blockbuster should aspire to be. It is consistently entertaining, riveting from start to finish, and a wonderful reminder of the magic that's been missing from the movies. While it may be too soon to make such a bold statement, Super 8 seems destined to become a classic of its genre. J.J. Abrams is forging quite the career. It is impressive enough that he has made a special-effects heavy, science-fiction, summer film for a remarkably low $45 million at a time when the box office is overrun with movies with triple-digit budgets and double-digit IQs. Even more impressive is that he has fashioned a special-effects heavy, science-fiction, summer film that is one of the best films of this year.

Watching Super 8 was like watching a 2 hour trailer of a film which never really begins, I kept waiting to be awed but the film lacks an intriguing storyline. I haven't read the book and don't intend to but I paid good money to watch this and came out feeling rather ripped off. I cannot fathom Spielberg made such a lousy film especially since he has BACK TO THE FUTURE to his credit. When I think science fiction, I think of films such as - District 9, War of the worlds, Jusassic Park and such. Definitely not Super 8.

However, the movie tries so hard to invoke the look and feel of those films from the late 70's, early 80's that those who grew up back then remember so fondly, it forgets to be a good movie in its own right.  The sentiment is all cheap, the plot is all recycled, the action is all generic, and as good as the child actors are, they're still child actors.  I heard so many people say they liked this movie without offering up even the vaguest of specifics as to why, and now that I've seen it, I think I know: even if you fall to its nostalgic charms, you won't remember a bit of this eminently forgettable movie in a few days; you'll remember the movies it's trying to remind you off.

4364148,3,B004EPYZQ2,"I really wanted to like SUPER 8, and there are certainly elements to like. But as I sat there with my extended family, including a 6, 7, 10, and 14-year-old, I kept wondering who the audience was. Clearly, it was intended for children, since the mother dies immediately in a horrible crushing accent. (Dead parents are the hallmark of all great kid movies, donchaknow?) And then the jokes about what was in the mother's coffin (seriously), because she was brutally crushed, so there couldn't be a body...well those scenes had my kids in stitches. Then there was the movie-long father-son angst about the mother's brutal death - riveting to say the least - and the pot-smoking hippie who drove the kids around declaring how stoned he was. Plus the language the kids spewed. And the military murdering a teacher and...and...and...

What's good about SUPER 8? The child-actors were fine. They were 100% clich, but that doesn't bother me. The movie that they make is funny but lasts, literally, as long as it take the credits to roll. There's a clichd but sweet coming of age/first romance story that is respectable. The alien angle was too scary for the younger kids in my group, but the concept of the protagonists catching something important on their little camera is compelling. I really do wish it had been more like the Goonies or Stand By Me, to which SUPER 8 has been widely compared.

When I see Steven Spielberg's name on the marquee of a science fiction movie, I'm really torn. My impulse is to run, but I remember Minority Report and think, maybe... But I also still remember A.I., and my feet start me moving toward the door. For SUPER 8, I saw J.J. Abram's name, too, and I was hopeful. Alas, it was not to be. I have to think there were some mighty internal fights over the direction this movie should take. And in the end, I think the audience was the loser. I would have loved to see more of the small-town charm, more of the kids (quieter and with more believable dialog) and less of the angst and brutal mother-crushing.",1308787200,9,2036,4.621546961325967

Which is to say, hugely influenced by it.

But when a movie owes as much as ""Super 8"" does to other artistic creations ... can it really be considered its own thing?

Critics were saying that after ""Mission: Impossible III"" and the recently rebooted ""Star Trek"" movie, J.J. Abrams was finally attempting something that wasn't a remake. But both ""M:I3"" and ""Star Trek"" took something old and made it wildly new (I'm an enthusiastic fan of both of those films), while ""Super 8"" is so entirely beholden to ""Jaws,"" ""Close Encounters...,"" ""The Goonies,"" ""Gremlins"" and ""Amazing Stories"" that it feels like a big step backward for Abrams.

It's basically about a couple of sad and troubled kids, Joe (nicely played by newcomer Joel Courtney) and Alice (the increasingly impressive Elle Fanning) who, along with their friends, get caught up in a dangerous adventure involving a scary monster from outer space.

During the course of the movie, what happens with the monster (mild spoiler here) has the happy side effect of helping Joe and Alice become less sad and troubled, as well as improve their relationships with the people important to them. At first I thought the movie's plot was a little too neat, but now I'm coming to appreciate the elegance and craft that went into the movie's screenplay.

The film also functions, visually and thematically, as a kind of tribute to the types of movies Steven Spielberg used to produce and/or direct in the 1980's, movies like ""E.T."", ""Poltergeist"", ""The Goonies"", etc. You know, ""kids in danger, but we're pretty sure they'll be okay in the end"" movies.

4364177,4,B004EPYZQ2,"Four somewhat geeky jr. high kids opt to make a zombie movie. Joe (Joel Courtney) is one of them. His mother has recently died and his dad (Kyle Chandler) is a deputy who is semi-understanding. Charles (Riley Griffiths) is the brains behind the film. Alice (Elle Fanning) agrees to help them with the movie. After midnight, she drives the foursome to the scene. She doesn't have a license and is worried because the deputy's son is with them. Joe promises not to tell. One boy, Cary, has a love for fire and fireworks. Alice's father (Ron Eldard) gets in trouble with the law. Her relationship with Joe is not welcomed by him. This develops into a background Romeo and Juliet scenario, something for the young teen girl appeal.

As they are rehearsing a scene at the station, a train is coming down the tracks. Charles scrambles to get a film clip of the train while shooting the scene. Then it happens: a white pick-up truck speeds by the train. There is a wreak. The kids panic and run for their lives as RR cars explode all around them. When the smoke clears they take a quick headcount. There are things which look like a white Rubik's cubes all around them.

Charles recognizes the driver of said white truck; it is his fourth period biology teacher, Dr. Woodward (Glynn Turman, a black man with a PhD. in biology teaching middle school in white suburban Lillian, Ohio). In his near dying breath the teacher instructs the kids not to say anything or else they and their families will be hunted down and killed! As GI Joe shows up at the scene, the kids grab their equipment and speed out of there...and they take one of the cubes.

The Air Force has taken charge of the clean up. The town's people are kept away and in the dark. Then weird things start to happen...Sheriff goes missing, dogs go missing, car engines go missing, microwaves go missing. There is clearly a ""monster"" thing on the loose, but the camera doesn't let us see it, very similar to many of the Jurassic Park/ Predator scenes. I wish I had seen this on IMAX. There are a number of scenes where things suddenly ""jump out at you."" This always makes it fun for a bunch of kids at the theater.

Spielberg/ Adams bring out the best in the child actors making them very convincing and realistic. The humor is pointed at kids. When Alice asks how to be a zombie, Joe tells her to act like their English teacher. The movie contains numerous anachronisms: Rubik's cube and Walkman came out in 1980 while the movie takes place in 1979. Elle Fanning is asked to play a number of different parts in this film, and she does them all well. I felt like I was watching her audition tape.

At some point in time the hippie (store clerk who tries to sell Charles pot) lets out a WTF. Here we have a film clearly aimed at kids and they drop the F-bomb in it. There was absolutely no need for it. They made the rating unwatchable for the target audience which is also financially irresponsible.

4364178,3,B004EPYZQ2,"Am I the only one who thought this movie under-delivered, was over-hyped, and was unnecessarily bloated with foul language?

I guess seeing Steven Spielberg's name conjured up in my mind a warm, climax-building, plot-developing Saturday afternoon kid-flick, with a memorable soundtrack, and a terrific ending that would make me walk out of the theater amazed, and with an 'how'd they do that?' admiration.

For my matine money I got more foul language than memorable lines, an Alien-esque monster that I could develop neither sympathy nor hate for, and a not-so-epic conclusion that made me ask the question: 'who the heck cares?'

I won't rehash the plot. It's the standard-fare government cover-up (Close Encounter of the Third Kind) of the presence of an alien creature we are supposed to both fear and pity. The thing wants to go home (ET but with none of the warmth), and does more stomping and smashing than anything else.

The alien finally turns the water tower in Lillian, Ohio into a gigantic magnet which shape-shifts car engines, microwaves, a kid's locket and bikes into a spaceship. With the drama of a donut, the creature climbs aboard and goes home, and there you have it. End of Story.

While the kid actors are wonderful, and Spielberg shows again he knows the ways of adolescents well, we don't get to know them as thoroughly as we might hope.

Other than the loss of a mom, a pot-smoking dad, dysfunctional family relationships and the conflicts extant between most all parents and kids, there's not a lot else to make us love the little band of Super 8 filmmakers. They are creative to be sure, and we have the expected boy/girl crush thrown in, but other than the scene 'filmed' at the train crash, the kids are not memorable.

Also left underdeveloped in plot and unanswered as questions are: why, specifically, is it the dogs who run away? Where is the alien from and why is it really here? Why does it store humans upside down in the hole (they seem to serve no purpose)? Was there a point at all to the lady with the curlers in her hair? Couldn't we develop more rapport between the alien and the kids?

In short, the explosions and sparklers are nice, but nothing spectacular anymore. The period music is OK, and disco references, Walkman, and old Kodak cameras are nostalgic. But if you're looking for a fast-paced plot like Raiders, a spectacular conclusion like Close Encounters, or the charm and warmth of ET, you won't find it here. Just some foul-mouthed kids, an estranged alien with an attitude, and some explosions to keep you awake.

If this movie is 'memorable', our standard for Saturday afternoon adventure has been significantly lowered. Disappointing.",1308441600,3,2693,4.836956521739131
4364179,5,B004EPYZQ2,"It's rare that a film comes along about kids and has a science fiction touch yet communicates the joys and the frustrations of growing up than Super 8.

Super 8 was apparently billed as a disaster film with aliens, etc. In truth, it's not about the alien at all. It's about kids growing up in a rural town, trying to do something special with themselves.

My Impressions:

The film starts out with a funeral. A child loses his mother early on. A man comes over and is immediately thrown out of the house! Right here you wonder what the heck is going on!

We find out soon enough. I think I found the story within the story of what Abrams was trying to do. It's semi-autobiographical. Spielberg and Abrams were both into making films as kids and it stuck.

The actual filmmaking was fun to see: they set up with funky scripts, a zombie who just would not stay dead, and a kid who wanted ""production value"" in all his shots! However, a train wreck, a fallen camera and an Area 51 scientist who also happened to be their science teacher changed all that.

The train wreck special effects were amazing and horrific. The look on the love-struck kid when he thought Alice was dead was heart-touching.

Favorite Scenes:

Father's Faith:

Without giving too much away, our hero discovers a film that was made with his mother when he was growing up. Alice sits with him in his room as the power comes on. The scenes project and Alice begins to cry, realizing that if her father took that shift at the steel mill that day, the tragic accident that took his mother ""should have"" taken her father.

The theme of dysfunctional parents that actually do love their children and overcoming that dysfunctional was great to see.

Amateur Horror Film:

During the credits we actually get to see the full film that the kids were making, right down to the pipe and the armchair, the zombie and the chemical plant, etc. Fun to watch!
I actually did something like this myself when I was 17 or so.

Music!

The memories of the late 70s came back to me. The music and the excitement are really great.

Hackneyed Themes:

Yes there were some ""I've seen this before"" themes of government abuse, secrets, abducting the alien (!), it escapes, the misunderstood scientist, the innocent children that make it right while the adults are clueless.

But it's HOW Abrams and Spielberg put these themes together, with a few twists (the fathers' involvement) and the success these filmmakers did in recreating the time period, the attitudes, the 1950s horror alien invasion Grade B style, that makes this film so charming.

Bottom Line: There are some scenes where the kids swear like truck drivers; it's not a lot but parents should know. Highly recommend this film, especially for those who grew up in the 70s, enjoyed Journey and Blondie, and loved the film E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial. The trailers make believe this film is a typical invasion story. That's done on purpose. It's a coming of age story that is charming in its execution. Highly recommended.

4364180,5,B004EPYZQ2,"The Review:

When Steven Spielberg and J. J. Abrams get together to make a movie, rest assured it's going to be good.  The only question is just how good. Super 8 is a mash-up of E.T. and Cloverfield.  That's an oversimplification and a big disservice to the hard work that went into Super 8, which stands on its own two feet as a sci-fi movie with a lot of heart.  Much of that heart comes from Super 8's child actors who far outshine most of their adult counterparts this movie season.  Joel Courtney and Elle Fanning stand out in the two lead roles, but everyone in the movie did an A+ job, at times capturing the camaraderie of films like Stand by Me as well as the sense of wild eyed adventure from Goonies.

Super 8 tells the story of a group of friends in an Ohio steel town who witness a cataclysmic train crash, inadvertently capturing it on a super 8 movie camera while making a student film. It's clear that something monstrous was aboard that train and made its escape during the crash. When the U.S. Air force comes to town, local law man, Jackson Lamb does his best to get to the bottom of a series of disappearances and thefts that plague the town in the wake of the crash.  But the civilians who know the most about what happened the night of the crash are the kids who witnessed it while shooting their super 8 movie, including Jackson's son, Joe.

Super 8 does an excellent job of taking you along the adventure with its characters.  You'll uncover the mystery alongside them. Unlike a who done it, I never felt the need to guess who or what was behind all the craziness. Super 8 just took me along for a crazy ride, and I enjoyed every minute of it, and as with the best thrill rides I totally lost track of the time.  Going into the movie I feared there would be a boring half hour build up or some down time, as there is in a lot of 2 hour movies. I'm looking at you A.I. I couldn't have been more wrong. Super 8 is pitch perfect. Action, laughs, human drama and a few scares. It's all there.  I won't spoil the set piece action scenes in this review, but there is one in particular which is the best I've seen so far this year, and that includes action tour de forces like Source Code, Thor, and X-Men: First Class.

Special mention must be made at how the film makers captured 1979 down to the tiniest detail. Super 8 doubles as a time warp the same way Mad Men does with Don Draper and company. To sum it up, Super 8 is a must see and it's very much a big screen movie experience, even at today's inflated ticket prices.

4364181,4,B004EPYZQ2,"""Super 8"" is director J.J. Abrams's tribute to Steven Spielberg's ""E.T.,"" with a tip of his hat to Rob Reiner's ""Stand By Me.""

The film takes place in 1979, with a group of pre-teenage and barely teenage kids--led by the overweight Charles (Riley Griffiths) making a Super 8mm movie about zombies for a film competition. The makeup specialist, Joe (Joel Courtney), falls in love--during the filming--with the female lead in the production, Alice (Elle Fanning). They are both sensitive--having lost their mothers.

During a nighttime film shoot, a train is derailed, when it hits a truck that goes on the tracks, and explosions and intrigue ensue, with the Air Force soon appearing. Gradually (a bit too much so), we learn why dogs are running off to the next county, why people are vanishing, and why microwave ovens are missing.

I liked the solid acting by the youthful cast, especially by Fanning and Courtney, who establish a very moving relationship with each other.

Overall, this film held my interest fairly well and jolted me a few times as I munched on some popcorn. It will be worth watching again when Netflix has it, but I doubt I'll want to buy the DVD.",1308268800,4,1169,4.800995024875622
4364192,4,B004EPYZQ2,"You might remember adventure films of your youth, where Middle America kids discovered amazing wonders and defeated great evils that only they could see.  These were the days of E.T., Goonies, and The Monster Squad, where kids laughed, cried, and fought while having adventures.  It's pretty much how adults remember their childhood summers, free of the soul-crushing realities of school, puberty, and adults. If you look back on your misspent youth in the early 80s with nostalgia, then Super 8 is for you.

J.J. Abrams has seen those movies, and with papa Spielberg's blessings, wants you to see them too.  Although this film is ostensibly about a child (Joel Courtney as Joe) coming to grips with the death of his mother, it is not for children.  There's swearing, drug use, and violence - pretty much what you would expect from a film set in the early 80s. In fact, despite the lens flares, the out of focus camera work, and the soaring musical score, Super 8 distinguishes itself from other coming-of-age-with-aliens flicks with its unrelenting violence. The alien in Super 8 is big, mean, and angry, and he expresses that anger by eating people.

The alien is a stand in for the adult rage that seethes throughout the town of Lillian, Ohio.  It's destroying father and widower Jackson Lamb (Kyle Chandler) from the inside.  It haunts Louis Daniard (Ron Eldard), who was indirectly involved in the accident that killed Joe's mother.  And it is passed on to the children, manifesting with painful eloquence in Louis' daughter Alice (Elle Fanning, bred from a race of superactresses).  When Joe finally confronts the beast, boy and alien finally see each other for who they really are: innocents thrust into bad situations.  Will their tortured legacy define them o r will they rise above it?

Heady stuff for a movie, and Abrams' deft movie-making elevates a straightforward plot that might otherwise be lost in the alien-invasion morass.  The film is beautifully shot and, for the most part, tightly scripted.  But once boy and alien face off, the movie loses a lot of its momentum.

Lurking throughout the military vs. townies vs. alien conflict is a hope of redemption for both Louis and Jackson.  This redemption is found in a car ride rescue by the parents, who of course don't rescue the kids at all.  Basically, the two guys could have had a beer and come to the same conclusions, but for pacing purposes it happens in a car.

And that's where Super 8 isn't quite as successful. The ending struggles to mash the alien's resolution with a father and son reunited, complete with a symbolic locket of motherly love. It feels a bit forced, which detracts from an otherwise pitch perfect tale about filmmaking, death, and meeting girls.

With less warmth than E.T. but a better script than Signs, Super 8 is a nostalgia-fueled trip for fans of horror and sci-fi who remember using words like ""mint."" Everyone else might be a little bored.

Except for zombie fans.  Zombie fans will be pleased.",1308268800,3,2999,4.852652259332023
4364193,2,B004EPYZQ2,"Because I'm the same age as the director, I can say that this film was marketed directly for me and folks in my generation.  I appreciated the nostalgia, but: my gosh this film is SLOW to develop, way slower than the films to which it plays homage.  This will bore 14 year olds to death.  This 38 year old feel asleep in one part.  It's a pretty film, and the child actors are VERY good, but the story is sort-of lame, and the ending pretty much a let down.  Folks are rating this film highly because they WANT to like it, but own it's own merits, it's really kind of boring and too slow paced to really capture the magic of, say, ET or the GOONIES.

4364194,4,B004EPYZQ2,"Back when I was growing up there was a young filmmaker known for great movies like Jaws, Close Encounters of the Third Kind and E.T. - The Extra-Terrestrial. These were wonderful movies. The first was scary, the second was thought-provoking and the third was excellent family entertainment. As the 1980's came along, this filmmaker, Steven Spielberg, made other fine works, like the Indiana Jones series and in the 1990's gave us Jurassic Park. Then he discovered World War II, and that was basically then end of him making ""genre"" films that appealed to a wide audience.

But apparently I wasn't the only one who had fond memories of Spielberg's earlier career. JJ Abrams, noted as the man who made Lost and directed the Star Trek reboot, seems to also have those sorts of good memories. So he teamed up with Spielberg and made Super 8, a film which, aside from the modern special effects, would not seem out of place in Spielberg's resume.

Super 8 centers around events in small-town Ohio in 1979. Joe Lamb is a young boy whose mother has died at the start of the film. Four months later he and his friends are making a zombie movie when they inadvertently bear witness to a massive (and extremelyunrealistic), train derailment. They escape with their lives, unaware that something else has escaped, too. Soon all the town's dogs disappear, only to turn up in nearby towns. The Air Force arrives to clean up the train mess and begins basically overtaking the town (and get away with massive lies, because if there's one thing we know about the 1970's, it's that investigative journalism didn't really exist and trust in the government was absolute). Then various items and people start to disappear and the action gets ramped-up to eleven, leading to an unnecessarily action-heavy third act.

At its core this is a movie about the relationship between a young boy, his friends and a girl that he's starting to develop a crush on. The movie is at its finest when it shows these kids just being kids. When it shows them hanging out chatting in a diner and teasing each other like kids do. When it shows them sneaking out of their homes to film at night. When it shows them being appalled/overjoyed that they're actually breaking into their school during summer vacation. These moments, as well as the ones highlighting Joe's somewhat complicated relationship with his father, also the town deputy and person in charge after the sherrif disappears), are the true heart of the film.

Those moments also make the moments of action, which include the military going nuts in the middle of the town, completely unnecessary. Those scenes add nothing to the plot, really, aside from creating some artificial peril for our heroes to deal with. Really one could edit out all the military elements and be left with a good, solid, summer science fiction film for the whole family. Also, having gone nuts with the action sequence, I feel that Abrams missed a really opportunity to kill off one of the kids. Harsh? Maybe, but it might have added something to the film. But consider the one of the pivotal moments of Jaws is when a six-year-old boy is gruesomely eaten by the shark.

I also need to make mention of Abrams as a director. He's good at what he does. He's very good at what he does. But he's never met a lens flare he didn't like, and frankly it's really, really distracting. If you thought scenes in Star Trek overused the lens flare, just you wait. Abrams really goes nuts with it in this movie and it does not add anything to the film.

Ultimately this is a very good movie, and I'd said it's suitable for pretty much the entire family.",1308182400,4,3638,4.69435736677116

It was also a nostalgic movie, reminding me strongly of ""Stand By Me"" and ""Goonies"".  It was great watching kids actually getting out and having an adventure.

All of the dogs run away and people go missing. I'm not going to spoil the surprises, since it was a much better experience for me not knowing. The CGI is very good and the all the kid actors are convincing.

4364197,4,B004EPYZQ2,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

Under producer Spielberg's assumed tutelage and inspiration, director J.J. Abrams has constructed a more-than-serviceable homage to the master in ""Super 8"". Okay, here's the umpteenth reiteration of the plot - a group of charismatic junior high adolescents shooting a zombie film for a contest stumble upon a train wreck, a government space conspiracy and deception, and a monstrous alien that escapes the wreck. Therefore, as I said in the title, you have an amalgamation of ""The Goonies"", ""War of the Worlds"", and ""E.T."", but not in equal proportions.

Abrams handles the ""Goonies"" component skillfully and appealingly. The preteens are spirited, energetic, clever, occasionally profane, but always endearing and sympathetic. I especially appreciated their accurate, amusing speeches, especially the exchanges between the sweet, Elliott-like Joe (home movie special effects artist) and his bossy, portly friend Charles (the home movie director). The budding relationship between Joe and the older, more mature, but demure Alice was also convincing and engrossing, especially since both have the loss of a mother in common. All the kids' reactions to and investigations of the train wreck/alien mystery were finely tuned and interesting. Abrams does not neglect kid/adult interactions either. Joe and Alice each have to deal with distant, emotionally reserved fathers and somehow manage to connect with them.

The ""War of the Worlds"" component was handled nearly as well, although some logic lapses do occur. The train derailment is suitably spectacular, but as another poster pointed out, it's highly unlikely that a pick-up truck, even ramming into the train head-on at full-speed, could cause such damage. It's like trying to trip a giant with a toothpick. The train would have stayed on course, but the pick-up and its passenger would have been throughly mangled. Therefore, the pick-up's driver, Mr. Woodburn, would not have survived to give the kids the dire but cryptic warning about the train and its contents. Nonetheless, the infiltration, evacuation, and surreptitious behavior of the nefarious, devious U.S. Army into the Ohio town where the train collision occurred are workmanlike, efficient, and well-handled. Many of the military adults, and some of the townspeople, may be corrupt and selfish, but they are not boobs. And Joe's dad, the deputy sheriff, is neither corrupt nor foolish, as he tries to penetrate the military's cone of silence regarding the crash.

Unfortunately, the ""E.T."" aspect of the film, despite being its focal point, is the least developed. Abrams keeps the elusive alien beast largely concealed for most of the movie as it smashes its way out of the box car, randomly attacks the townspeople, and burrows underneath a cemetery for refuge. This suspense-building works. However, it leaves the audience (and the kids in the movie) little time to bond with or even communicate with the alien. (MAJOR SPOILER WARNING ABOUT THE BEAST'S ORIGIN AND APPEARANCE). The alien and his crashed spaceship (now broken down into magnetic cubed components) was being transported from a Roswell-type military base. The roughly 12-foot high (I guess) alien looks like a hybrid of Alien, the ""Cloverfield"" monster, the Transformer Optimus Prime (especially about the face), and the Ymir from ""20 Million Miles to Earth"". And, oh yes, a spider. It's described as frightened and distrustful because of the mistreatment it received from the U.S. Army, and actually benevolent. But throughout the movie, he acts malevolently, smashing cars and buses, apparently killing at least two people, and hanging people (including the kidnapped Alice) upside down in his subterranean cave apparently for food! Joe's short, calm confrontation with the alien in his cave seems to change its mood. At the movie's end, he assembles a new spaceship out of magnetized metal (including the locket containing a picture of Joe's mother and him as a baby), and takes off. See, very inconsistent and abrupt. Was the alien inherently sinister, or benign? Why didn't the alien construct a new spaceship immediately, as soon as he escaped? Why bother terrorizing the townspeople? ""E.T."" gets shortchanged here.

Nevertheless, I do recommend the film as a funny, suspenseful, kinetic good time. If you are a Spielberg fan, you'll probably enjoy it even more, and be more inclined to overlook its flaws.",1308009600,6,4437,5.351002865329513
4364198,5,B004EPYZQ2,"The film is about basically about an alien (and military knowledge of it) and the small-town heroes who want to solve the mystery and save the town (and ultimately the alien, too.) Sort of a mixture of Gremlins, ET, Jurassic Park (lots of Spielberg-style in this movie), the Goonies, Predator, with a little zombie stuff and Dazed and Confused thrown in. I don't want to give away too much of the plot, but it is very tension driven, not gory (which worked well for the hard-to-please tweens in my house...not kiddies, but not ready for R-ratings.)

I would have liked to have seen more of the character development between the boys (even if the action sequences were a little shorter) but that is just my preference and that doesn't fit with the ""summer blockbuster"" type of genre. Still, it seemed to ride the buddy movie/action movie line very very well. I WANTED the protagonists to win...which doesn't always happen for me in some movies. There were also a few little moments of that-doesn't-make-any-sense and corny stuff, but the movie was so enjoyable, you just let the few go.

Overall, it was quite good. I remember walking out and thinking ""I wanna see that AGAIN!"" which isn't a frequent response I have to most movies. I often judge movies by the amount of popcorn I have left...if it is gone, it means I was kind of bored/not engaged, but I had half a bag left after this one!! Be sure to stay during the credits to see the Super 8 version of ""The Case.""

I hope people are reading these reviews before the DVD is released, because this one really should be seen on the big screen. It has a nostalgic feel and being in the theater (or better...the Drive-in!) really makes the experience more whole. A dark room at home with lots of popcorn will likely work well, too.

4364199,5,B004EPYZQ2,"Super 8 was a far more interesting film that I thought. The trailers didn't look very interesting and what convinced me to see the movie were comments I heard on the radio. A comment that I recalled was that the first half of the film was like a Steven Spielberg movie (not surprising, as he was a producer) with the second half like a Jerry Bruckheimer action movie.  I came away feeling the film was an excellent tribute to Mr. Spielberg.

The story is set in a small suburb in 1979 and focuses of a group of movie-making kinds (much like Spielberg and writer-director J. J. Abrams themselves) who are making a zombie film.  The characters have their own deep conflicts centering on the death of Joel Lamb's mother (sensitively acted by Joel Courtney). Joel's father, a deputy sheriff (Kyle Chandler providing an excellent performance) has a strong dislike for one of his deceased wife's co-workers Louis Dainard (Ron Eldard). This causes problems in a budding romance between for Joel and Alice Dainard (beautifully played by Elle Fanning).  Everything changes when the kids observe a train derailment, documented on their Super 8 camera that allows an alien creature to escape.

The feel of the movie was closer to ET for me with the kids knowing more than the adults and knowing what needs to happen once they have all the facts about what is going on.  This is a beautifully acted film with some excellent special effects that add to the viewing experience without being gratuitous.  I think Super 8 is the kind of film that can be enjoyed more when seen the second or third times.

Abrams, creator of the highly commercially successful 'Super 8', understood that the way to Mr. Spielberg's heart (as well as his purse strings) was to create an homage to the 'master', a Spielberg clone if you will, that both legendary director and scores of uncritical teenagers could appreciate.

'Super 8' certainly begins with a clever concept. A group of teenagers are shooting their own amateur detective zombie movie which they hope to enter in a statewide competition. You can see how this would appeal to Mr. Spielberg--he got his start making amateur movies as a teenager. At the end of 'Super 8' during the closing credits, we actually get to see the amateur film ('The Case'), the intrepid teenagers end up creating. It's one of the most clever and enjoyable moments in 'Super 8', and it's too bad the rest of the film is unable to reflect the true joy and unheralded abandon of young teenagers trying to find their way in the adult world.

The protagonist here is Joe Lamb (very nicely played by newcomer Joel Courtney) who is your basic Spielberg stand-in. Note that the young Lamb is the make up and special effects guy who best friend Charles depends on to spruce up the amateur Super 8 film they're shooting at a nearby train station. The tension really builds when a real train derails and crashes in spectacular fashion and the kids barely escape with their lives.

After that, there just seem to be too many contrivances to ignore as Abrams introduces us to another tired alien 'E.T.' narrative, about a misunderstood Anthropod, pursued by a sadistic US military who won't let him return home. It's a little difficult to believe that Dr. Woodward, the kids' biology teacher, is able to survive the horrible train derailment; in addition, one can only wince that the film's primary victim is another saintly black man who must sacrifice his life for the good of all humanity (please see 'Terminator II' and '2012' for further examples).

Much more egregious is the idea that there is a psychopathic Air Force Colonel (Nelec) who has an entire group of soldiers who follow orders (like any good Nazi), ensuring that a kindly alien is tortured needlessly for years and his main protector, is murdered after surviving a horrendous train wreck. After the kids discover Woodward's treasure trove of journals and film, we realize that it's not only the military (represented by Nelec) who is indicted here, but the scientific community who went along with the cover-up. Thus it seems rather obvious that Abrams is content to take cheap shots at both the military and scientific community since in these days of heady conspiracy theories, it just seems like the easy thing to do.

While I had to suspend my disbelief that the military was unable to uncover Woodward's treasure trove before Joe and his gang get to it, I was more bothered by the fact that neither the local or national media picked up on this story considering that there were a lot of unusual goings-on in this little Ohio town. First off there probably would have been a lot more questions from the media regarding the massive train wreck which probably would have drawn even more reporters to the sleepy town. Then after the power went on and off, and the sheriff disappeared, there was a town meeting (which certainly would have been covered by at least some local media), leading to some additional uncomfortable questions, which in real life, probably would have led to further scrutiny (perhaps leading to coverage by the national news.) In other words, this is something that could not have been covered up so easily as Abrams would like us to believe.

Abrams has more difficulty turning his alien into something lovable and cuddly. After all, he's locked himself into a corner when Nelec is depicted as having tortured the hapless creature relentlessly for years. Abrams is content to have the creature communicate telepathically--once anyone bothers to do a 'mind meld', the alien 'understands' that humans mean no harm, and it conveniently backs off acting aggressively. This is shown in the past with Dr. Woodward but also in the present with Joe, who tells the creature 'it's okay' to go home! The problem remains is that the creature has kidnapped a whole bunch of townspeople including Joe's love interest, Alice, who remains suspended upside down, in the creature's subterranean lair. One wonders how long the all those people have been hanging upside down. What happens if they have to go to the bathroom? And why does the creature grab the sheriff a second time? Has he killed him or simply hung him up on the 'rack' for another bout of suspended animation? It's obvious that Abrams doesn't want to kill the townspeople off since that will put his cuddly alien in a bad light!

For those who haven't noticed, 'Super 8' does have a 'B' story. No it's not the prepubescent romance between Alice and Joe but rather the conflict between their warring fathers, Jackson and Louis. It seems that alcoholic Louis missed a day at work and as a result, Joe's Mom was killed in an industrial accident. Unfortunately, Abrams misses an opportunity to develop Louis's character and he comes across as too petulant for most of the film. Jackson is good trying to wear many hats in attempting to help harried townspeople during the 'creature crisis' but later, the big 'rescue' of the kids flops, after Joe and his chums escape from the besieged bus, by themselves.

For those who enjoy Spielberg, 'Super 8' may be the ticket to relive the memories of some of Spielberg's sci-fi classics. But for those who want something that's not so derivative, you'll probably come away being a bit disappointed.",1307836800,4,5811,4.849798387096774
4364201,4,B004EPYZQ2,"Going to keep this short and sweet: Great summer blockbuster movie; awesome character development; set and scenery stunning. Only two problems I had with this movie: 1) Ending could have been better, just seemed way too clich; 2) ***SPOILER ALERT*** But my major gripe: Was very disappointed to see JJ Abrams basically re-use the same monster from ""Cloverfield"", just on a smaller scale. I was expecting more originality than that, for Super 8.",1307836800,3,444,5.095890410958904
4364212,5,B004EPYZQ2,"As a kid who grew up in the late 70's and 80's watching films like ET, Jaws and Close Encounters I was destined to enjoy this movie. For me to say that Super 8 is a nostalgic and entertaining movie would be true. To say that Super 8 is a J.J. Abrams tribute to Spielbergian cinema would be partly true. Partly. There are so many parallels to story, characters, time period and genre that's it near impossible not to immediately start making connections to which Spielberg film is being referenced in any particular scene.

That said, before I get into Spielbergia I must give J.J. Abrams his due as an original artist. Anyone who has watched American television the past decade knows Abrams can deliver solidly on story and character with series like Alias, Lost and Fringe under his belt. However, until now his feature film career has been rooted in existing properties like Mission Impossible III and the new Star Trek. Both highly entertaining and visceral films in my opinion. But with Super 8 being his first original screenplay for a feature film, in some ways this was uncharted territory for Abrams. But with someone like Spielberg as his collaborator and producer and Abrams litany of experience in film-making and storytelling its hard to imagine his first original feature being anything but what we would come to expect from him. Emotional, well plotted, well acted, funny and just plain entertaining.

Now that we've gotten that out of the way lets get to the fun part - the Spielberg parallels! Here's the ones I spotted, in no particular order:

1. The ""catalyst"" into Act 2 is a spectacular train crash. Any coincidence that the 1st movie Spielberg remember's seeing as a child was 'The Greatest Show on Earth', which also contains one of the biggest train crashes in movie history? In fact, that train crash is said to be what inspired an 8 year Spielberg to shoot his first film; 2 toy trains crashing into each other (also as a way to get away with seeing his toy trains crash over and over without getting them taken away by his father.) Notice the discussion in Super 8 about filming the toy trains crashing into one another, which ultimately they do.

2. The obvious MILITARY parallel of Alien Life in Close Encounters being covered up by a staged viral outbreak that kills anyone or thing that breathes it causing town evacuation. This VS. the Military coverup of Alien Life in Super 8 being a staged grass fire that causes town evacuation.

3. In JAWS the scariest thing about the shark is the NOT seeing it. Same is true in Super 8, we don't fully see the monster until the film is almost finished. Builds suspense much more effectively.

3. Any coincidence the place that that the Alien in Super 8 makes his final takeoff into space from a water ""tower"". In Close Encounters the Alien Mothership arrives and takes off from Devil's ""Tower"", Wyoming.

4. The town hall meeting in Super 8 is very reminiscent of the town hall meeting in Close Encounters. All citizens EXCEPT the sheriff seem to be clueless and way off base about whats really going on.

5. The sound that the Alien makes is VERY similar to the sound of the T-Rex in Jurassic Park (as well as the sound of the dying truck in Spielberg's 1st feature 'Duel'.)

6. The main kid, Joe doesn't make good grades, as evidenced by him throwing his C+ papers aside when the Alice sees them (this could easily be a J.J. Abrams childhood connection too however.)

7. In ET & CLOSE ENCOUNTERS the alien makes a ""psychic"" connection of some kind with the people it interacts with. In ET its Elliott ""feeling"" what ET feels (i.e. classroom scene with frogs & Elliott getting drunk & Elliott getting sick when ET gets sick, etc.) In Close Encounters its Richard Dreyfuss and Melinda Dillon being obsessed with the image of Devil's Tower, which ultimately draws them to it. In Super 8 every human the Alien touches ""sees"" what the alien feels and has been through, thus sympathizing with it.

8. In ET a group of underdog kids led by Elliott ""save the day"" for ET. In THE GOONIES a group of underdog kids led by Mikey ""save the day"" for Mikey's families home which is about to be sold and bulldozed. Same here in Super 8 with Joe, the main kid taking one of the cubes which is close enough to the Water Tower to be drawn to it, thus creating a foundation for the Alien's ship to work from. Remember all the other cubes had been taken away by the government until the very end. And Joe is the one who tell the Alien to ""GO"" and that he understands and that bad things happen and its OK. This could be seen as the alien's motivation to leave. (my brother mentioned a parallel to 'Stand By Me' underdog kids, which is also true.)

9. Slight Spielbergian cinematography connections - 2:
  a. The way both the gas station attendant and the airfare bus driver are ""pulled away"" feet first screaming by the Alien is very similar to the first death in Jurassic Park, where the gatekeeper is ""pulled away"" feet first screaming by the Velociraptor.
  b. The side tracking dolly shots of the kids running through neighborhood ""up and over"" hills, fences, etc is very similar to side tracking dolly shots in ET of kids riding their bikes through neighborhood ""up and over"" hills, fences, etc trying to get ET to the forrest.

10. And here are a random sampling of other various connections I saw to Spielbergian cinema - the use of smoke and light, the conversational cadence of the kids interrupting each other & using cuss words poorly, loss of a parent, military being overly ""big brother"" in hiding alien, tracking and dolly shots, overhead shot of bus. I could go on and on.

Without question Super 8 has a multitude of connections and parallels to Steven Spielberg films but it is also good to keep in mind that good story elements are good story elements no matter when, where or who they are used by. Many times the good ones pop up over and over again, precisely for that reason, because they work. Overlap to previous archetypes or story mythologies is inevitable because the ones we like are the ones we like, whether they are set in space or in the old west. Good storytellers are drawn to these same archetypal stories, they just flavor them differently each generation. In summation, all of these parallels could simply be a MASTER STUDENT (Abrams) following his MASTER TEACHER (Spielberg) with such skill that it comes off as an omage, which it very well may be and does not keep it from being a truly original work.

BONUS!

#. Not a Spielberg omage but the name of the gas station KELVIN is the 2nd reference J.J. Abrams has made to his grandfather in a feature film, the 1st being the name of one of the spaceships in Star Trek (the ""U.S.S. Kelvin"") And of course all LOST fans know Kelvin is the name of the guy that was in the Swan Hatch before Desmond.

#. Also not a Spielberg parallel, but the kids zombie file ""The Case"" pays omega to George A. Romero, the godfather of zombie films by naming the chemical plant 'Romero Chemicals'. Loved that.",1307836800,5,7028,4.579617834394904
4364213,5,B004EPYZQ2,"See this movie, see it in the theater with a big screen!

I am not familiar with JJ Abrams but he definitely is a student of Lucas and producer Spielberg.

The only name actor in the movie is Kyle Chandler as  Jack Lamb, who for years has played small town Texas high school football Coach Eric Taylor on the well-acted but under-watched TV series ""Friday Night Lights"". Lamb is an overwhelmed police deputy here with the same intensity and focus as Chandler has on ""Friday Night Lights""

Set in 1979 in small town Ohio, a group of five dorky middle school kids with a lot of braces and pimples including deputy Lamb's son Joe (Played by Joel Courtney) , decide to make a zombie movie shot on Super 8 film, the low budget media of the day. The movie is seen through their eyes. They want to enter a statewide amateur movie contest. They enlist the help of love interest Alice, from the wrong side of town, played by Elle Fanning (Dakota Fannings little sister). Alice unexpectedly turns out to be a great actress, jawdroppingly good. The kids go to the train station to get more ""production values"" in their zombie movie. A train goes by while they are shooting and then wrecks spectacularly. I won't say more, but there are plenty of plot twists and turns.

Movie starts out silly and slow paced teen movie but rapidly picks up speed intensity and focus. Action/adventure, suspense, mystery, menace, scifi, a creature and a lot of strange events. Like the best of George Lucas and Stephen Spielberg, Super 8 is it's own movie, but pulls in bits and pieces from various ""Indiana Jones"", ""ET"", ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" and ""Alien"". In a season with a lot of formulaic less-than-super, predictable superhero movies, this is the action movie to see!

Highest recommendation! The kind of great action movie that just doesn't seem to be made anymore. Emotionally intense.",1307836800,3,1878,4.710365853658536
4364214,5,B004EPYZQ2,"""Super 8"" is brilliant! This is how the story goes: In the summer of 1979, a group of friends in a small Ohio town witness a catastrophic train crash while making a super 8 movie and soon suspect that it was not an accident. Shortly after, unusual disappearances and inexplicable events begin to take place in town, and the local Deputy tries to uncover the truth - something more terrifying than any of them could have imagined.

The cast led by Kyle Chandler (as Jackson Lamb) & Elle Fanning (as Alice Dainard) is excellent. The story, screenplay & directing by J.J. Abrams (who also produced) is excellent.

The music by Michael Giacchino is excellent. The cinematography by Larry Fong is excellent. The film editing by Maryann Brandon & Mary Jo Markey is excellent. The casting by Alyssa Weisberg & April Webster is excellent. The production design by Martin Whist is excellent. The art direction by David Scott & Domenic Silvestri is excellent. The set decoration by Fainche MacCarthy is excellent. The costume design by Ha Nguyen is excellent. The visual effects by ILM (Industrial Light & Magic) are brilliant. The creature design by Neville Page is brilliant.

This is a brilliant film that superbly harkens back to Steven Spielberg classics, like ""E.T"" & ""Close Encounters Of The Third Kind"", ironically, Spielberg produced this film. This is a well-crafted original story that keeps you entertained and on the edge of your seat while your heart races at a faster rate. This is J.J. Abrams' best film of his career, so far. This is also the best movie of the summer and of the year, so far.",1307836800,4,1599,4.807272727272728
4364215,5,B004EPYZQ2,"After weeks and months of speculation, the thing is unveiled. And, it turns out, what SUPER 8 is, is a blast from the past, a nostalgic kick of cinema. And it's good, it's really good. There's a kid in this film who, whenever he thought something was cool, would remark, ""That was mint!"" Well, sir, SUPER 8 was mint.

SUPER 8 is set in 1979, in the heartland town of Lillian, Ohio. Four months after the death of his mother at the local steel factory, 12-year-old Joe Lamb and his dad are grieving still, Joe's dad, a Sheriff's Deputy, still so affected that he's become estranged from his son. Joe at least has got his friends to distract him. It's summer now, school in the rearview for a while, and Joe's promised to help out his good chubby buddy (and budding filmmaker) Charles with his 8mm zombie movie, hopefully to be finished in time for an upcoming film festival. Joe builds train models, but he's also handy with monster make-up.

Joe is particularly stoked to learn that his dream girl, Alice, will be acting in the picture. Joe and his friends (and Alice) all agree to sneak out at night and shoot scenes at the local train station. But then their little horror film gets upstaged when a military train rumbles by and derails spectacularly. And that's the start of a series of mysterious and frightening events befalling the town of Lillian.

Joe Lamb, observant and early on tapped as the prospective protagonist, notes that something has punched thru the steel confines of one of the box cars. Soon after, the town suffers persistent fluctuations in electrical power, dogs are running away, and people are vanishing, as well as automobile parts and various everyday household items. And the U.S. Air Force has come to town, behaving oddly and sweeping the town streets and fiddling with their instruments. In the air wafts the smell of  a military cover-up.

In a nod to the paranoid 1950s sci-fi flicks, certain of the townspeople blame the Red Menace. Joe and his friends know better. They've seen stuff, including these weird little cubes. But they were warned, warned by the only other person to have witnessed the train crash (and he actually caused it). If the kids talk, ""they"" will get them... and their parents, too. Except that this is the kind of movie in which the adults are the ones milling around, perplexed, and kids are the only ones who can save the day. I'm all for this kind of movie.

This is intentionally a throwback film. And it throws me back to that era, when disco was at its last gasp. When the Walkman was the latest revolutionary leap in music accessibility. When sexy Debbie Harry was doing her thing. When the Three Mile Island disaster was still topical.  When folks said things like ""gnarly."" SUPER 8 will resonate with just about everyone, but even more strongly with those falling in the Generation X bracket. Writer/Director J.J. Abrams has learned well at the master's feet. Much of what's in SUPER 8 evokes classic Spielberg. This story is darker and with a harder, more brutal edge, but somewhere in it you can catch glimpses of E.T. and THE GOONIES. Only, the special effects are much more lavish. Even if Abrams teases you for much of the film by only revealing shadowy bits of the terrifying alien set loose in the tiny town.

Abrams constructs a good mystery, and he's excellent with staging the reveals. All of that doesn't impress me as much as how he handles the story's human elements, or, more specifically, how good he is with those scenes showcasing the children. He treats these scenes - which are all a homage to adolescence - with clear affection and humor and perceptiveness. More, he obviously feels a kinship to these kid characters who, just like him at that age, are avid film buffs and amateur filmmakers. Somewhere, in a producer's chair, polishing his Oscars, Spielberg must've been beaming, just beaming. It helps that the two child leads, Joel Courtney and Elle Fanning, are so terrific. They hit those emotional beats just perfect. I also got love for that firecracker-obsessed pal of theirs who is certainly destined to be a future arsonist. What's less excellent - partly because it's resolved in such a perfunctory manner - is how Joe and his dad's strained relationship is developed. Also, Joe's dad (Kyle Chandler) seems slated to have a bigger role to play in the story. But, it turns out, not so much. And, if you're anticipating a full-on E.T.-type interaction between the kids and the alien, prepare to be thwarted. For the most part, this alien is nothing like E.T. ***SPOILER FOR THIS NEXT SENTENCE ONLY*** SUPER 8 shows what well may have happened to E.T. if the military had gotten its hands on him before Eliott did. SUPER 8 is watchable because the premise hooks you in and Abrams knows storytelling. But, for my money, it elevates to must-see status because these kid actors are so good at their craft and because Abrams does well with evoking a child's natural sense of wonder. It's all mint, baby.

And mind that you stay for Charles's completed zombie film (titled ""The Case"") which plays during the closing credits.",1307750400,4,5115,4.731762065095398
4364216,5,B004EPYZQ2,"[*no spoilers*]

If you're after a non-stop thriller, packed with massacre and destruction and alien culture, this is not your movie. Super 8 tells a different story from the one suggested in its heart-pounding trailer, in that it DOES tell a story. And if you're fortunate enough to have been exposed to Spielberg before, you know any story in which he takes part is not one you want to miss.

Super 8 is about relationships and the power and ramifications of feeling, which the supernatural element serves to amplify and test. We are tipped off to these film centerpieces in the opening scene, when thirteen-year-old Joe (Joel Courtney) and his father (Kyle Chandler) are suffering through a personal tragedy, and his father's misgivings about someone in town are presented. We care already, especially with Courtney's earnest and expressive eyes that evoke empathy with every emotion he conveys. He is a promising actor whose future I look forward to seeing develop.

Don't think this film is entirely dramatic and weighty, however--the comic relief is surprising in its placement and frequency alike. It roots us in the un-jaded juvenile mind and emphasizes the grand proportions (which really pop on the big screen) of what is unfolding around the group of boys we follow and attach ourselves to.

Carrying us along on their adventure is a solid script and thoughtful detail placement. As Jamie Graham of Total Film puts it, ""Like Spielberg, [director J.J.] Abrams has an eye for awe."" Think back on the landscape you caught a glimpse of through the hole in the bedroom wall, once you've watched the film, and you'll see what he means. Or, in retrospect, mull over the defense Joe's father presents to his son, the irony in his declaration that as the town deputy, with the sheriff not present, everyone is relying on him. There used to be someone else, but now there's only him. (For now you'll have to take my word for it...)

The score, reminiscent of something from John William's legacy (hats off to Michael Giacchino)...the transportation back to 1979...the young male camaraderie and adventure...the nods to Spielberg's classic results from dabbling in the otherworldly...the focus on the characters and storytelling...all of these elements make for an experience you don't want to miss. You are, at the same time, given a dose of nostalgia and a new classic to cherish. Brilliant.",1307750400,6,2393,5.00251256281407
4364217,5,B004EPYZQ2,"First of all, I want to acknowledge the outstanding performance of the little girl in the movie, named Alice (portrayed by the beautiful Elle Fanning). From the beginning of the movie, to the end of it, Elle Fanning never ceased to intrigue and completely ""wow"" us! A mysterious character Alice is, who often displays empathic tendencies (in my opinion) and I wondered if she was playing the role of an empath. I think it is possible that such a tinge was written into her character, but also not highlighted so much as to draw too much attention to that idea. I have never seen a child perform so well in a movie, ever (at least I cannot remember) and the fact that I can't remember anyone else means that Elle Fanning has outshone every other performance by a child actor that I have ever seen! Elle Fanning was breathtaking in this film, aside from being beautiful, she manages to communicate what the character is feeling, and impart that unto the viewer just by the expressions communicated through her eyes. Outstanding, excellent acting! I will be looking out more for this young actor, I believe that she will make it very big and very far in her profession. Amazing.

Now, onto the movie... I want to stress that this movie contains the worst language I have ever heard being spoken in a movie, in all my life. Seriously. And the fact that children are saying all these profane words makes it very hard to swallow. I was watching with my ten year old son (the country in which we live rated it GP) and I don't agree with the GP rating of this movie, due to the extremely foul language! With that being said, I believe that we can't hide our children away from the world and protect them from knowing what the realities of the world are (like bad language) and at the time we watched this movie, my son was already prepared to hear all that language. I told him after the movie that I trust and know and have enough faith in him to say that this movie was a great movie, because I know that just because he hears or sees something, doesn't mean he's going to do it. In the end, we both agreed that this was a really great movie! Brilliant, actually! I am blown away and I truly admire the talent and brains behind the script, the story, the plot, the flow, cinematography, everything really! However, if you have children that are not yet prepared to hear how the rest of the world talks, don't take them to see this movie (if it's rated GP also where you live), because they definitely WILL find out how the rest of the world talks, by watching it! Terrible language! The thing is, that's life!

From the very start, this film did not fail to deliver intense punches in the face; intense emotional drama, intense thrilling scenes, intense effects, and I often found myself breathing deep sighs just to relieve myself of the tension I was feeling. So, it starts out very intensely and is very intriguing! But then it later succumbs to humor and the movie progresses into something truly hilarious (in a good way) and I have not laughed so much in a movie house, in a very very long time!!!!! Hilarious! Just so so funny!!!!! The lines, the characters, scenes, just hilarious!!!! This is the portrayal of true talent and genius behind the film, because, when delivering so much intensity in the beginning of a movie, it is wise to bring the viewers into a whole different realm later on by introducing an equally intense amount of humor!!! It was hysterically funny at times, and this is the point at which I truly began to appreciate the movie and it really did begin to shine, for me!

I would classify Super 8 as a science fiction thriller, but, due to the genius creating it, the film is able to contain the science fiction to the sidelines, and what really takes the limelight is the emotional backdrop of the main characters, this story is at last strongly character-driven and emotionally true. The science fiction part simply becomes just a thing that happened in the lives of these extraordinarily strong characters. Sort of how things happen in all of our lives that seem to come in on a train derailment and wreck havoc in us but in the end and after it all, these things that happen are just things that happen, and life is meant to be lived. I do believe that is the true message of the story, and it is built into and built up by the plot and the script and the acting, thus producing a very strong delivery of this single message.

The movie wraps-up beautifully, I cannot over-emphasize that. The beautiful wrap-up of everything surely makes up for the very foul language and sometimes hard-to-look-at bloody scenes. In the end, the fathers both learn that the most important things in their lives aren't the things and the people that they have lost, but the most important realities in their lives are the people that are in front of their eyes: their own children. The children in turn learn how to let go of pain and forgive, I think that everyone learns forgiveness and letting go in this story.

Overall, this movie is like life itself: it is at times hard to swallow, but in the end it's beautiful and we all learn the most important things.",1307750400,4,5171,4.520299145299146

But after a while it started looking like a ""who's who"" of his past (albeit great) films, and a big part of the enjoyment became trying to spot the next ""cameo"" by a previous scene, plot device, or character.  We have the ""clever-kids-who-know-way-more-than-the-clueless-adults"" of just about every Spielberg movie ever made (ET comes most to mind, for obvious reasons); we have Chief Brody from Jaws (a Sheriff's Deputy this time instead of a Chief of Police, and Lillian, Ohio instead of Amity Island, but you get the idea); we have vehicles driving down a dark, star-covered road in the middle of nowhere when mysteriously all the power goes out (Richard Dreyfuss in Close Encounters, anyone?); we have a baddie/villain/whatever-it-is that we see more and more of as the film progresses (Jaws again); we have dinner-table scenes with kids behaving more wild and out-of-control than any reasonable parent would ever let their kids behave (Close Encounters, again?); and I won't give any spoilers, but suffice to say that the film concludes in a very true-to-form Spielbergian mode.  And let's not forget the 2 inescapable contributions by JJ Abrams -- excessive and intrusive lens flares everywhere you turn (Star Trek?), and the moody (and beautiful) music by Michael Giacchino (L O S T).

Ahhhh, but this movie has heart in the story and in the acting.  Kyle Chandler, Elle Fanning, and the new young actor who plays Joe Lamb steal the movie.  This 'coming of age' story is set in a more innocent time, before middle schoolers began 'hooking up.'  The rest of the kids who make up the motley film crew are believably hilarious.  Each cleverly has his or her own specialty in film making.  You can only imagine a young JJ Abrams doing the same thing when he was a boy.

It turned out to be an entertaining enough movie, though not quite in the same league with such Spielberg sci-fi classics as E.T. and Close Encounters, and maybe not even as good as Mr. Abrams' update of the Star Trek franchise.  Still, the movie was a lot of fun, and I enjoyed its nod to the '60s 'B' movies where the army is fighting the alien invaders (or giant ants, or whatever).  Plus there was the familiar element of a small town dealing with an unknown threat to its existence.  There were also many heartwarming and/or humorous moments of the type that fans of those previous Spielberg classics will recognize, and the little romance between the two young people was nice.  However, the scenes of the middle school heroes were a bit too repetitive (ex., too many scenes of the young director demanding that they get back to making his movie).  That detracted slightly from my level of entertainment with Super 8.  Also, there is no shortage of special FX shots in this flick, but few of them were noteworthy.  A couple of impressive scenes near the end are an exception to this observation.  Otherwise, it was just a lot of stuff flying through the air, blowing up, and/or getting smashed and knocked around.  Finally, the plot plot just felt a bit too casually thrown together, never fully engaging my interest at the level to make this film truly memorable.  I almost went a star lower with my rating, but I left the theater feeling I'd had a good time, and that was enough to get me to 4 stars.

An additional note:  Make sure you stick around for the credits!  If you leave when they begin, you'll miss an amusing look at something very relevant to the story.",1307664000,4,1834,4.5349544072948325

8427520,5,B004EPYZQ2,"""Super 8"" is the type of a movie camera. This movie was a big hit when it was released in 2011. It is the 1970's era about a group of boys and their leader, a large over weight boy who believes he can tell everyone what to do; he is in charge a making a film (using a super 8 movie camera) to admit for a school prize about a vampire! They are in the local train station doing some of their scenes when they see one of their teacher's driving his pickup truck on the railroad tracks towards a train that is coming in the man's direction! There are very huge explosions and fires. They all go home...but why is the US Army and MP's in their town evacuating everyone? There is a large forest fire in another area, and the townspeople are told that it is dangerous for them to stay in the town....what they don't know is, what was on the train that got out when the train crashed? This is a science fiction film and it is a good movie!",1525305600,,932,4.070652173913044
