THIS IS THE SORT OF HOLIDAY FILM I LIKE TO SEE. MOST OF THE CHRISTMAS MOVIES THAT ARE MADE TODAY IS USUALLY ABOUT FAMILIES WHO ARE FUSSING, FIGHTING, AND FEUDING.

Like clockwork, come the holiday season, A SMOKY MOUNTAIN CHRISTMAS does its rounds thru the television networks. And, yeah, why not? It's a charming, heartwarming movie, and over the years, since 1986, it's certainly become a Christmas staple. Right around late November and then December, I pop in my VHS copy and have me a hearty sitdown and watch.

Country superstar Dolly Parton plays country superstar Lorna Davis, who one day decides to get away from her hectic lifestyle. She ends up in the wild Tennessee mountains and finds lodging in a secluded cabin already inhabited by seven distrustful orphans. Even as the police misconstrues her sudden disappearance, putting it instead to kidnapping, Lorna learns that the orphans have been fending for themselves for a while now, and hiding from the authorities. Partly because of her guitar-strumming and singing, mostly because she's an awesome person, she gets them on her side soon enough. That is, excepting the suspicious oldest kid, who is her toughest audience. Kid disapproves of her presence, believing that she'll vamoose all too soon, so there's not much point in the children becoming attached to her.

But we all know that Dolly Parton wouldn't do them the dirt like that.

This is one of those irresistible Christmas television movies you can't help but cozy up to. Its contents are totally appropriate for any age, and it, in fact, feels like a Walt Disney product. A SMOKY MOUNTAIN CHRISTMAS is also a backwoods fable, with strong echoes of Snow White and the Seven Dwarves. Bolstering the whimsical fairy tale aspect is the presence of a despicable, honest-to-gosh witch, and she harbors a grudge against Lorna for supposedly stealing her man. Lee Majors, all bearded-up, is the reclusive Mountain Dan of the terrifying reputation. Rumor has it that Mountain Dan carries a rattlesnake for a whip and uses the bones of children as weapons. Nevertheless, he and Dolly engage in a low keyed romance.

Besides also being talented, Dolly Parton exudes unfailing niceness and there's this sincere vibe to her. Her warmth radiates and effortlessly carries the film. I did smile a bit because, after a while, you can tell when she's about to go and impart some wisdom or advice just by her picking up that ol' guitar and warbling away (some of these songs, by the by, are ones she herself wrote). Anything Dolly does seems straight from the heart, and that definitely carries over to her singing.

There's a refreshing lack of cynicism in this film, and that's due in large part to Dolly Parton. But some credit also goes to Henry Winkler, the old Fonz himself, who directs the thing with unpretentiousness and with the understanding that Christmas is about being together, never mind the presents, never mind the fame and money and, in the case of one nosey reporter, never mind the big scoop. This is the kind of movie where that same nosey reporter turns out to be a good bloke after all and where even someone as formidable as a wicked witch can be vanquished by folksy trickeration (reverse psychology, to you and me). A SMOKY MOUNTAIN CHRISTMAS puts you in the yuletide mood. As a bonus, John Ritter even shows up for a mo with a nice twang and playing a mildly riled-up judge. And the kids are all cute. Dolly is cute in a lush-figured kind of way. And Lee Majors doesn't really use the bones of children as weapons. So it's all good on every front.

Okay, apparently, these dvds being offered up here aren't kosher. Me, I still have my VHS copy, so I'm still good to go. But I do agree that it's messed up to support these bootlegs; plus, why settle for inferior quality? And, naturally, when the real DVD does come out for this film, I'll willingly switch out my VHS tape. There, I'm off the soapbox.",1228780800,,3841,4.758258258258258
