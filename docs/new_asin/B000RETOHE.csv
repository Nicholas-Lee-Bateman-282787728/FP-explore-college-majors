2865273,5,B000RETOHE,Any movie with Al Pacino in it has got to be great.  This movie duo was definitely a great addition to my collection.,1381363200,,117,4.086956521739131

2865275,5,B000RETOHE,"I love these double feature packages. Two movies for the price of one. And it's an sepecially good deal  when both  the movies are absolutely first rate, such as with the ""Devil's Advocate""/ ""Insomnia"" pairing. This is about the best Double Feature DVD I've reviewed. Both star Al Pacino. In the first, he's the CEO of a major NYC law firm, sorta. Well, Pacino was excellent, but the whole movie came out very strange and rather other than expected, much to my delight. Strangely enough, it was one of the better movies I've viewed in years. I gave it five stars.

In the second movie, Pacino was a Los Angeles homicide detective on loan in Alaska and working on a complicated murder investigation where Robin Williams was the chief suspect. Not only was the case complicated, but the mind of Pacino was severely impaired by insomnia associated with the 24-hour-days of the Alaskan summer. The acting was excellent. the filming and direction was first rate. The story  was a bit lacking. I rated the film as four stars, but a strong four stars.

You can't get a much better double  feature packet than this one, and if you're an Al Pacino fan, it's just all the better.

2865276,5,B000RETOHE,"I really don't have much to say.  It's a nice Pacino two pack on DVD.  The only real reason that I am writing this review is to note that the one I purchased was a single, double sided DVD, not two DVD's as Amazon states.",1339545600,2,221,3.888888888888889
2865277,5,B000RETOHE,"The Devil's Advocate is a classic!!!  Watch it over and over to remind me that doing the right thing is the best recipe for success!!! Al Pacino at his best while ""playing"" Reeves like a piano!!!",1466467200,,195,4.416666666666667
2865278,4,B000RETOHE,The delivery and quality of the DVD is 5 stars.  The movies are good - just not that great.  Insomnia was very entertaining - Robin Williams was always great in more serious roles.  Devil's Advocate was just ok.,1463529600,,211,4.5

8200277,4,B000RETOHE,"Insomnia is a really good movie...realistic, believable, intelligent and entertaining. Rather low key which is honest.....Devils advocate was OK. I just cannot get too enthused about the supernatural stuff....I am sure it was made to give us a lesson on right and wrong....but that is a little phony when there is so much sex and ugly language...",1502841600,,346,5.087719298245614
