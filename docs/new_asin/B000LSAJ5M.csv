2713262,3,B000LSAJ5M,"This television series, up until this final year, had well established itself not only as a landmark series, but also had maintained a fairly consistent level of quality.  That is, until this final year.  Joel Fleishman's (Rob Morrow) character would see reduced time on this series until he ultimately left the show alltogether.  The producers brought on a few new actors in an attempt to reinvigorate the ""fish out of water"" scenario, but they both proved to be dissapointing.  That, and coupled with a good chunk of lackluster writing left longtime fans with a very very bittersweet ending to this series.  Even the last episode was not even written to be their finale, (it was also a very dull episode as well) and only a few spare moments were done in reshoots to close out the show.  Overall, I think this particular season is really lacking and is not in the same class as what had been established in the previous five years.",1172707200,28,933,4.693251533742331
2713263,5,B000LSAJ5M,"We have all 5 of the season's and when March 6th rolls around, we will have all of them. And it's my birthday...COOOL

We have absolutely loved the series, If your ever going East across I-90 in Washington State from Seattle take a left at the Roselyn sign, Exit 84 I think.

It's a real neat town that all the outside and some of the inside shots were filmed at for Northern Exposure. The radio station was bare bones the last time we were there. The Roselyn Cafe sign has been re-painted and the ""s"" taken off, same color's tho.

Anyway just my 2-cents, Take Care!",1171756800,10,566,4.320754716981132
2713264,5,B000LSAJ5M,"What can you say about this show that people that have already seen it haven't said already? Each and every episode of Northern Exposure has a plot and enough great writing and acting to be full length movies in their own right. Whoever was the casting directeor did an outstanding job with getting this cast together in the beginning because they all seem to fit their parts so well. Also, how many shows that are an hour long each week can last 6 seasons without the quality of the episodes going down at all. Sure, many people didn't like the fact that Joel left in this, the 6th and last season, but all of the Joel-less episodes were still great. And if you want to get technical, Joel did play in almost half of this season's episodes anyway. Each and every episode of this show was like I went on an adventure with the people of Cicely, Alaska, and I never wanted to come back. So many wonderful memries like Ed buying Ruth-Anne and burial plot and dancing on it with her, Chirs' legal trouble with the state of West Virginia, Holling's mid-life crisis at 63 years old, Joel discovering a wolly mammoth that Walt ends up cooking on his grill, and I could go on and on. Season 6 has its share of touching moments as well, most noteable is the very last episode called Tranquility Base. Did anyone feel bad for Ed when at the end of this episode everyone had someone to be with, but Ed went back home alone. But he had his movies and seemed as happy as anyone else.

Speaking of this ""Tranquility Base"", I would like to plead to whoever is releasing this set of DVD's to PLEASE leave the song ""Our Town"" in this last episode. I know the music has been reowrked a lot in these DVD's, but this song is crutial to this last epsidoe and it should be left in!

I was saddened to hear Peg Phillips (Ruth Ann) died a few years back. I wish she could have gotten to see these DVD's that she's so much a part of.",1171756800,22,1908,4.267955801104972

2713266,5,B000LSAJ5M,"I, like many others here, have been a fan of Northen Exposure both when it aired originally and in the DVD collections.  I am glad that all of the seasons have been offered on DVD so that we can capture this excellent show for our viewing pleasure for years to come.  If you have not yet checked out this show, you are missing true television enjoyment.  The actors in this show touched the lives of many fans with their wonderful characters, and we are geninely appreciative of the work that you all did on this show.",1169251200,23,518,4.375
2713267,5,B000LSAJ5M,I have loved all the Northern Exposure seasons that I've gotten so far and I have no reason to believe this one won't be as good. I rarely saw Northern Exposure when it was on TV so the sets that I have gotten have been pure gold to me. I fully intend to get this one when it comes out and I truly recommend the others,1169164800,12,318,3.8333333333333335
2713268,5,B000LSAJ5M,"Northern Exposure is the best show ever made in all of television history.

This is the final season, and though Joel leaves the show to many peoples dislike, the rest of the characters keep the show interesting up till the finale episode. The way Joel's experiences in Alaska end up changing him are very significant as we see in the final season, and this has always been in my opinion one of the most existentially sincere and compelling character changes ever developed in any television show. This is the result of writing that is comparable to high literature if you compare the character of Joel from the first episode to the final one he appears in, and the entire series of NX becomes a protrayal of a man who goes through the most poignant and profound experiences of self realization.",1168819200,85,795,4.678571428571429

Of course, Northern Exposure without Rob Morrow is like Gone With the Wind without Clark Gable and they made a major error in replacing him with a happily married couple.  And, I'm sorry, but the episode where Maggie and Joel are supposed to be way off on an Aleutian Island and he just walks off toward N.Y. City in the distance just doesn't make any sense.  If it's a dream, then say so, other wise it's just nuts. And what was all that tripe  where everybody was Russian many years before.  Just boring, I fast forwarded it.  Writers need to know when they are getting too weird for their audience.

2713456,2,B000LSAJ5M,"Spoilers herein, be warned.

Season six is a dismal end to what was a wonderful series.  Characters long known to us are deconstructed and completely changed from their long known personalities and traits.  The worst example of this is what producers and writers did to Chris in several episodes, changing him from his well known character as an intelligent, well spoken, spiritual mentor to the community, into a whining selfish boob.  And worst, setting him up with Maggie, who is suddenly interested in this whimpering uncharacteristic dis-interesting repulsive version of Chris?  Yet, in other episodes, Chris is back in character, not involved with Maggie, and enjoyable to watch as was usual such as ""the Graduate"".  The inconsistencies are maddening.

The last final episode is terrible.  Meant to be a homage to the series it does the opposite.  Nearly all the characters are changed and modified beyond belief, stuck in a script without a plot, off in some new set supposed to be a ""new summer lodge"" for Maurice.  This is not surreal, it is bad writing and destructive.  What happened to Cicely?  Were they kicked out of Roslyn, WA?  Of the episodes on disc 5 of the set, only ""Ursa Minor"" is worth watching.

Hidden within the year are the few remaining gems of episodes well worth watching, primarily those on discs 1 through 4 still including Rob Morrow as Dr. Joel Fleischman, and others such as ""The Robe"" with Shelley meeting the devil as a spa salesman.  The episodes with Joel and Maggie are still magic, especially the actually surreal episodes ""Dinner at Seven-Thirty"" when Joel experiences an alternate realty in NYC and ""The Quest"" with them on treasure hunt for the ""lost city"" which should have been the finale to the series.

Buy the set, but beware.  The new doctor and his wife never fit into the series and you may wish to skip watching episodes primarily on disc 5 which are inconsistent with the fine history of the show.",1431129600,9,1951,4.828313253012048

It's a quirky show with a quirky cast, strange storylines, and volatile personalities. When originally on the air, it used to have great music but most of the original stuff has been replaced. My understanding is that there was a lot of copyright problems with the original artists, so no agreements were ever reached to use the original music (probably all about money). In the end, the artists are the losers, because they'll never get the exposure and recognition that would have come with being included in the shows, even if it was for free.",1428364800,,717,4.609375

2713560,3,B000LSAJ5M,"The 6th season of Northern Exposure is kind of all over the place.  The real-life contract situation between Rob Morrow and the show's producers had finally come to a head, and he announced that he would not be renewing his contract.  Because however, the first two seasons of the show were partial seasons, Morrow had to appear in some of the 6th season episodes.  So they slowly started writing him out of the series with his final episode being in the 15th episode of the season called The Quest.  It was probably, along with the season premier which showed an alternate life for the characters in NY (which was totally stolen by Cynthia Geary's performance ditching the bubble-headed valley-girl version of Shelly), was the best of the season.  Fleischman finally makes his way back to NY in a very unconventional manner.  And it also had a cameo by Adam Arkin reprising his role as Chef/CIA agent Adam.

Midway through the season the show introduced the new town doctor , Phil Capra (Paul Provenza) and his wife Michelle (played by Teri Polo) who come to town after  Dr. Fleischman heads even deeper into the wilderness.  They were first introduced as wanting to be there after leaving LA, and when that did not seem to work, the writers had the characters having trouble adjusting to the town so they would hate it one episode and then seemed to kind of like it again in the next.  I think the plan was to  carry on  the show without Rob Morrow, but as they were writing him out of the show and he essentially became a recurring character, they were trying to get any storyline to work (including a possible romance between  Maggie  and Chris that felt kind of forced), that the show ended up sputtering out.

One of the other reviewers compared it to MASH and I think even a comparison to  ER can be made, where stars in ensemble cast shows were replaced and survived.  But unlike ER where the show never centered around any particular character, the first two seasons of Northern Exposure were built around the fish-out-of-water aspect of the NY doctor in rural Alaska.  Then it became how he was adjusting and growing into being a member of the quirky little town.  And so Fleischman's exit from Northern Exposure was much more akin to what MASH would have been losing Hawkeye had Alan Alda decided to leave, which would have killed that show.  The actual series finalie was a letdown because it seemed like just another episode (and even then Maggie never even appeared until the last couple minutes) until the very ending montage which did send the show out on a nice note.  And luckily Universal actually paid for the rights to keep the song Our Town in there, because it would not have worked nearly as well as with dubbed over elevator music.

Obviously the music issue still rears its head in this season.  Some, but not all, of the original songs are missing.  So, if that bothers you from seasons 3-5, then it will bother you about this one as well.  As far as DVD extras go, there are deleted scenes on each disc.  About 40 minutes worth in all.  No gag reels this time, and still no commentary tracks or behind the scenes material.

All in all I would characterize this season as good, but not great.  Certainly not as good as the first few seasons.  It has moments of quality, but was essentially lost trying to find its footing again after Morrow's departure until it because clear that a show without him was just never going to work.  Unfortunately the show did not have the kind of ending that it really should have, but with that said I did really like Rob Morrow's final episode (although it would have been better having him interact with more of the town's characters even if just through dream sequences) and thought the way he returned to NY was very fitting for the show.",1404000000,3,3802,4.579881656804734

2713614,5,B000LSAJ5M,"""If you feel like I do that there was always some fairy dust sprinkled on the streets of Cicely... you'll find that every bit of that dust has blown away...""

This really captures the transition but for me this was a very welcome change. We all loved the goofy charm of Northern Exposure or wouldn't have gotten to the sixth season. But the price of fairy dust was many of the characters were stuck in eternal childhood. The show became less a cartoonish Hallmark card on togetherness (which I loved, pure fantasy) and more of a character study.

Watching it now, especially after 'The Sopranos' had its run, you can see the effect of David Chase's rising influence on the show. Watch the sixth season again and compare to the Sopranos, you can see everything from the intense closeness of ties, to the fantasy (delusional?) scenes, the conflicts played out in often uncomfortable back and forth, to the unflinching look at the darkness of even the most fairy-dust infused characters.

The sweetness that coated their flaws in earlier seasons has diminished and we get to see them more realistically, they balance out. Maurice and even Shelly show real ugliness. We've always seen Maurice abuse and swagger his power in benevolent terms that leave everyone rolling their eyes or smirking, but here we get to see the real despot always hinted at and the insecurity that drives it -- when he ends up with Barbara its because he can finally hand over the reigns to someone he recognizes as someone very much like himself but with more integrity. Maggie and Joel develop a new inner stability and acceptance, both growing softer and more lovable. Ed, Holling and Shelly emerge from living like the approval-seeking, abandoned children they were, and insist on their place, showing real fight when challenged standing up to the town's ultimate authority figure: Maurice. Chris's endless analysis of life around him finally gets turned inward and he begins to lose his complacency and begins to care for himself and others in new profound ways. Ruth Ann loses her stoic matriarchal superiority and allows herself to look the fool for Walt. But what didn't change was the way the village accepted each other.

As for the new doctor and his wife, they were just as sweet and loving as the original Cecilians. They were also quirky but unlike the other citizens of the show they had real self-awareness and eagerly sought out opportunities to grow in time to do it with everyone else -- a fairy tale in itself really. Unlike Joel, they respected the people in the village and learned from them. It might just be you relate to them too much to appreciate how quirky they really were. :)

So I love this season. I was getting impatient with the fairy tale because the characters were so potentially interesting but were frozen in fairy dust. It was wonderful to finally see them grow and usually we grow through conflict. David Chase kept his vision and was able to start out from the beginning to paint another village of sharp archetypical and fanciful characters full of loyalty and delusion, battling the elements, who had each other for better and worse to create another one of the best shows on TV. Interestingly Chase lost NE because of character growth and in Sopranos the characters almost uniformly refused to change over the years. In many ways you can see where Northern Exposure influenced him significantly.",1369094400,2,3411,4.823931623931624

2713618,4,B000LSAJ5M,"A fitting conclusion to a creative televison premise, though it's interesting that the initial comedy impulse appears to have given way to more melodrama & less comedy by the last season. Apparently, there were contract tensions with Rob Morrow--who had moved on to the acclaimed film, QUIZ SHOW--& his restlessness (& ego) shows a bit, as he heads even further North & improbably goes native. The change in people behind the scenes--inevitable after 6 years--begins to be apparent. There's a mild loss of enthusiasm in the scripts & direction. I was surprised, nonetheless, that it held up as well as it did in its finale. Usually shows like this peak around season 3 or 4, then clearly decline in originality & energy--they settle into predictable narrative formulas & we tire of the quirks & defining characteristics of the ensemble cast. Speaking of ""peaks,"" this has always been a kinder, gentler Twin Peaks. The feedback fondness for the entire 6 seasons is well deserved, though I'm puzzled by this obsession that all of the original broadcast music is not preserved in the dvd versions (because of the escalating cost of obtaining music rights). The show's strength is in its writing, especially, & in its consistently professional cast, not in its music. (I think it's a generational thing.) The music substituted is hardly the muzak claimed. It's always appropriate, frequently extraordinary--though I don't have total recall & am not a pop music fan so can't spot the (apparently) few places where there's variation. It's as though the show depends on its soundtrack, which is far from the case.",1366934400,,1606,5.041353383458647

2713653,3,B000LSAJ5M,"NX is still my all time favorite show. Nothing even comes close.
  That being said ,I still struggle with the way Season 6 played out. I like some of the first few episodes ; ""The Robe"" is great. Also I love ""Zarya"". Most people despise the NX characters playing different people from another time or place ( A gimmick which is often considered a Shark Jumping move ) ,but I like the change. And the relationship between Joel & Maggie is always touching in these cases.
  Unlike most of you I actually like the way Joel left the series. His transformation occurred too quickly of course ,but I enjoyed his new found calmness and love of nature.
  Two other episodes which really stand out for me, are first the one where Joel interacts with the newbie Doc Capra. Their encounter with one another is well done,and it shows how far Joel has traveled in his journey. It is almost as if Capra is Joel's old self when he first arrived now meeting up with a newly evolved Joel. Joel's kindness and serenity floors Capra,but they both walk away wiser for their meeting.
  Secondly,the most important episode of this season is Joel's final meeting with Marilyn when she visits Manonash. To me Marilyn represents ALL OF ALASKA AS A WHOLE,and Joel's relationship with her is parallel to his struggle with familiarizing himself with all of Alaska. He achieves proper closure with her ,and it is heartwarming to see this happen.
  Unfortunately, I am mostly displeased with the post Joel episodes. Michelle Capra is a bland vanilla like character that basically stinks up every episode. Doc Capra is no prize either,but he has a few bright moments .especially where he actually makes his presence felt by serving as a mediator in an old world vendetta involving "" The 4 Families"". But otherwise the 2 newbies are sorely lacking when other proper actors could have breathed new life into NX.
  Also my biggest beef by far is the painful coupling of Chris & Maggie. It is pretty much unbearable to watch. You can easily tell that the writers were painted into a corner with the show abruptly ending and were forced to pair Chris and Maggie together. The only other woefully mismatched pair I can think of that comes close, were Molly Ringwald's Rich Girl and Judd Nelson's Dirtbag character in "" The Breakfast Club"". I think if the series continued there would have been 2 new characters to complete Chris and Maggie. Probably a Career /Cause driven male for Maggie like Joel or Mike Monroe,and a Earthy ,Crunchy ,Celtic Type woman for Chris to enhance his spiritual and artistic leanings. This would have completed his Malcolm X like transformation from prison. But alas ..We are stuck with a brutal, forced, and awkward courtship which is not enjoyable or the least bit convincing. What a pity !!
  I also think it would have been better for Ed to find someone instead of all the other characters who suddenly found true love in season 6. Maggie,Chris, and Maurice had all been through various romantic encounters in NX ,but for Ed all we really got was a fleeting infatuation with the painfully shallow Heather who uses him as a way to anger her Out Of Touch father Lester. It is unfair to see Ed go so unfulfilled when his character is so deep and worthy of affection. It would have been nice to see one as rich as Maurice come up empty ,while one as poor as Ed would be romantically fulfilled. How come nobody thought of that ???
  Lastly ,even Iris Dement's great closing song ' Our Town "" can not save the final episode. We see Holing and Shelly for 2 minutes ,but we get loads of Michelle Capra. UGHHHH! And to see Chris lost without Maggie is not the least bit convincing. Just bloody awful !!! Too bad this show went out with a whimper just like so many other shows ( Sopranos, X -Files, Night Gallery, Happy Days, Star Trek, All In The Family,Chico and The Man etc.) The deleted scenes are like putting a Band aid on a gaping wound.",1321401600,,3929,4.591428571428572

2713655,5,B000LSAJ5M,"There is no such town as Cicely Alaska but I hope a place like this really exists somewhere. This is one of the most wonderful, beautiful, inspiring shows. They don't make shows like this anymore, everything now needs graphic sex and violence and more special effects than acting to do well. This show was born at the perfect time and it still makes people smile and miss the quirky people that are unlike any characters today.",1301097600,,427,4.631578947368421
2713656,3,B000LSAJ5M,"I was commenting to my husband, while watching this season, that if your ""fish-out-of-water"" story loses its fish in the sixth season, maybe you shouldn't replace him with two other, bickering fish. He responded that he rarely--if ever--enjoys watching uncomfortable family in-fighting in a series like this one.

Like most of the reviewers, I regarded the replacement of Dr. Capra and Michelle for Joel with distaste; not to knock either actor, but it was an unnatural transition that just left me feeling jarred. Aside from Chris's episode (and a few deleted scenes on the dvd set), it seemed like everyone recovered rather quickly from the doctor's disappearance, and a couple of regulars inexplicably formed close friendships with the newbies seemingly overnight. It's as though the new actors were given someone else's lines to read, or the characters moved to a new town and were handed someone else's friendships along with the house, office, and personality. It's a strange thing to watch in quick succession.

Speaking of deleted scenes now available on the dvd set, I'm glad there were several scenes included for the last episode. I spent the entire hour wondering where some people were and why other people seemed to be acting strangely out-of-character, only to have it explained in one of the scenes that had been cut. I seem to remember feeling this same sense of confusion and loss the first time around, too, watching it in my bedroom late at night on the 5-inch b&w t.v. I had back in high school. Color and added size didn't add plot clarity, but the deleted scenes did.

And yes, like others, I still missed the music. I don't remember it all super-clearly (I was 17 the first time around), but there are times when the dvd music (seemingly randomly-selected instrumental stuff) made everything seem kind of, well, square.

I had to laugh derisively (and this holds true for all of the seasons on dvd) when a character would reference the music in some way, only to have some lame muzak playing in the background. ""I hate this song. This song was playing when Michelle and I first drove into town"" complains Dr. Capra, as some unmemorable track limps along at The Brick. For a show nominated for several awards for music, composition, and sound mixing, this is practically sinful.

Despite these drawbacks, if you're a fan of the show from the previous five seasons, you'll want it in your collection. I think many of the early episodes show a nice mellowing of the character of Joel, and there are still plenty of insights to be had. There's a ton of the old wonderful magic, spirituality, and dream sequences, too, enough to leave me feeling nostalgic.

If you've never seen the show, best not to start with this season. You really need to see the previous seasons to appreciate anything good that this one offers.",1293753600,3,2837,4.8391752577319584
2713657,3,B000LSAJ5M,"Sorry guys, but this last season of Northern Exposure wasn't what I hoped for. I was still moved by several scenes and still enjoyed a few of the episodes, but most of the episodes could be cut from this season (some were thoroughly annoying), and you'd still feel like it was as complete as it could get.

There were issues I would really have liked to see resolved, and resolution that was felt contrived by people behind the scenes who were probably upset or distracted. I was irritated by the addition of characters who didn't move the main story line along. It was worse than in the fifth season. This season felt like a bunch of side stories that would have been interesting to know but only after completing the main story. I was left feeling like the main story fell off the tracks and was only giving a half-hearted attempt to get back on-track.

Remember that I said I was moved by several scenes and enjoyed a few of the episodes? Those bits of video make the whole season worthwhile if you're a Northern Exposure fan. I suggest you identify the episodes you like after watching the whole season, and then skip over all the bad ones the next time you have an Alaskan marathon. That's what I plan to do!  :)",1285632000,2,1217,4.448430493273543
2713658,5,B000LSAJ5M,"For me Northern Exposure is essentially an encapsulation of the most broad-minded world view possible.  I'm a sucker for the program because the writers share virtually every belief that I do.  (The writers reserve the right to say they don't share my beliefs, as my public persona is very far out, and it wold not be fair to say they agree with me, although I say I agree with them.)  In any case, it's hard to watch this, after buying multiple seasons of Northern Exposure, since it is all permeated with the end of this whole mini-world I've lived in in my mind for a decade.  However, the endings of things are real, and for us to really know something, we need to know both its beginning and end.  I would say that the show handled its own inevitable decline brilliantly.  Janine Turner noted that she ""knew it was all over when Rob Morrow said he'd be moving on to another series.""  But really, if one looks at the whole cast of characters, one can see that after five years the whole set of concepts had played themselves out excellently.  I would not say the show was ""over with,"" but rather that it was ""eventually completed,"" or ""reached completion.""  Now, the Tao says that the end of a matter is as important as its beginning.  It's easy enough to start dating someone, but to end a relationship in a loving, civil way and to remain friends afterwards, not so easy.  So, these folks took a season to really wrap things up the right way.  And, by the way, the doctor and wife that had to finish out the season after Morrow left did a heroic job of trying to fill such gigantic shoes.  And, knowing as they probably did, that the odds for the show continuing were dim, gave everything they had to that show anyway, which was just marvelous.  Of course one can see that the writers were from time to time experimenting with new concepts and relationships and characters to see if some fresh way of transforming the whole series might give it a big second wind, and indeed, at times, one almost feels that they've pulled it off.  But toward the end, the viewer begins to feel it's also time to end, and that's all good.  In any case, the episodes are well written, and the transitional episodes, where Joel moves upstream to the village, are actually amazing.  Ironically, were the whole show to change drastically enough to breathe new life into it, it might have very well been started by centering around the amazing second life upstream that Joel had created, but, of course, since he was the very character that was leaving, that wasn't an option.  In any case, anyone who loves the series should go ahead and take this last journey with Northern Exposure, even though, emotionally, it's a hard one.",1281484800,,2712,4.5338809034907595

I estimate that 18 out of the 23 episodes are at least descent with at least 15 being very good or better. Of course this remains subjective, but if you don't like your first viewing the second may surprise you.

2713665,5,B000LSAJ5M,"I watched the first three seasons of Northern Exposure when they appeared on TV and loved them.  Recently I've been watching seasons 5 and 6 on DVD and am so glad that they are available.  Sometimes shows aren't as good later as they were in memory so I wasn't sure how I'd like them now.  I was so happy that I enjoyed them just as much, maybe even more than when they first aired.  Maybe it's because the cast members had grown so deeply into their characters that their performances were extraordinarily natural and had a huge impact.

It was interesting to see how some of the characters matured, too.  Maggie, for some reason used to annoy me in the early days, maybe because she and Joel were always fighting and that got old.  Maybe because she made friends with the part of herself that was just like her mother. (The series is very psychologically hip.) Maybe it was just that she let her hair grow and was much softer and prettier! I was happy that Joel got out of town and left her free, finally, to find a guy who was worthy of her....the magnificent metaphysical Chris, who had to go through his own maturation process to deserve the lovely lady.

I thought that the writers did a heroic job of dealing with the departure of Rob Morrow.  The culture clash of Fleischman with the Cecilians was the essence of the  beginning of the show, but after a while the other characters developed and became so interesting that we didn't need to have Joel and his neuroses in our faces every week.  The way his character developed in the final season and then faded away was masterful and quite moving.

And that's how life is---people come and go and life goes on.  The new doc and his wife moved in and again I think the writers made a good choioe in the characters of Phil and Michelle Capra.  They were from LA and had the same adjustments to make as Joel but in their own way which seemed softer and friendlier than poor old Joel. I think that, in time they would have fit in to the town and to the show very well.  Too bad we'll never see that.

The season keeps the magic and heart warming moments and the humor.  I loved the show that featured Ed trying to mother a bear cub...I found the way he tutored the cub in salmon fishing, all dressed up in fur, to be very dear.  Ed seemed to mature a lot, physically at least, and in some shots he was startlingly handsome.  It was nice to see a bit of the incomparable Adam although I would have liked to see more of Eve.  It was lovely of the writers to give us a happy ending to the tortured violinist!  The character of Maurice seemed to mature a lot, too.  His one dimensional crassness opened up beautifully at times, particularly in his relationships with Ed and again with the violinist.

This series has got to be among the very best in American TV history--up there with Cheers, Taxi, Mary Tyler Moore and Knotts Landing--maybe at the top of the list.",1238630400,5,2913,4.363636363636363

2713671,2,B000LSAJ5M,"Never having watched the show when it originally aired I became entirely addicted to the DVD sets, and have blissfully devoured them all. For my money Northern Exposure is the second greatest TV series in the history of the medium, second only to The Fugitive.

I avoided watching the final season due to the dreadful comments of many Amazon reviewers but I finally gave in... and I'm sorry I did.

There are many specific problems and one that's more ethereal.

First, replacing Dr. Fleischman with another doctor whose attitudes, inability to adjust and general whininess exactly mirror his predecessor was a foolish move. It's hard to imagine the creative team who gave birth to this brilliant show making this decision - it reeks of one mandated by clueless studio executives.

Second, Paul Provenza as the new doctor and whoever as his wife, under the blanket of a dead script, create characters who could put a speed freak to sleep. Dull as dishwater and at times immensely aggravating.

Third, the entire cast seems to have had the wind taken out of their sails. Many are walking through their roles. Marilyn's usual stoney simplicity which for five seasons was cleverly rendered and at time hilarious in the final season now becomes shockingly boring. Too often season six has what the others never did - BAD acting.

Fourth, the reliance on fantasy, dreams, illusions, etc. is wildly overworked. The season opener's recasting of the characters in New York is clever and it entertains. But let's drop it there, please. Watching Provenza at one point turn into a werewolf while his wife serves him dinner is beyond painful. It's not clever. It's stupid.

The harder to pin down problem is that the magic is gone. The indescribable mix of sharp writing and quirky charm that makes Northern Exposure so unique is entirely absent. One always had the feeling that the characters loved each other. There's no love in these scripts.

If you feel like I do that there was always some fairy dust sprinkled on the streets of Cicely... you'll find that every bit of that dust has blown away...",1205798400,22,2090,4.851123595505618
2713672,4,B000LSAJ5M,"Some call this season the worst of the lot, but these viewers are less interested in N:EX being a story of progressive growth in the characters, and more interested in the surreality of a quirky small town in contrast with a captive outsider (Joel). There is nothing wrong with this view, but there's also no questioning that this season does a great job at giving Joel the final great turnaround he needed in order to complete his ""Northern Exposure."" He finally allows his captors to take him whole, and becomes the one character in the series that actually manages to grow out of habit. The only really unfortunate part about season six is that the ending doesn't adequately resolve the other characters lives, it's more like a humble wrap-up if anything and it takes way too many episodes to do it in. There could have been a build-up in the last two episodes at least, but they fail to be the tear-jerkers they should have been.

Regardless, the middle of season six--the bulk of it, actually--is dynamite. It has much of the surreality as the earliest seasons, and is especially welcome after this season's spiritless introductory episodes. It was as if everyone finally got over mourning Joel's eventual departure and moved on. In my opinion, Rob Morrow moving on was the best thing he could have done for N:EX: it forced the writers to give his character the satisfaction of conclusion and ask themselves why all the other characters really exist, bringing out the best in everyone.

As a note: this season seems to suffer less from the loss of original soundtracks as some of the earlier seasons, partly due to replacement choices but even more so due to the way that N:EX actors became extremely mature in the way they played their characters to the point that it's almost eerie. If the change in soundtracks bug you to the point of anger you're not paying enough attention to the character acting. People complain about the Dr. Capra character being ""bland..."" he wasn't, really, but he was incredibly eclipsed by everyone else's comfort with their roles.",1200355200,3,2066,4.800561797752809

It had everything.....it was funny, it brought important life issues to the forefront, it had its sad moments, its wacky moments and its reflective moments.  It was a pleasure taking a trip back to those moments.  Watching the episodes again struck an even deeper chord with me this time because I have since visited Alaska twice.  Being a city girl (Chicago) it gave me a deeper sense of what it might have been like - even in these modern times - to live in such a remote part of the world.  The final season had some significant changes - Joel leaving Alaska for good and being replaced by the new doctor and his wife.  Yet....isn't this the stuff that real life is made of?  I'm glad it didn't end in typical Hollywood fashion, and I'm happy and proud that the season continued to show the diversity and life perspective in such a sensitive and beautiful way....right to the last episode.  The last episode was quite heart rendering.  I'm not much of a TV watcher, but I have yet to enjoy a TV series as much as Northern Exposre.",1192665600,6,1157,4.497607655502392

When I watch Northern Exposure, I think of what the poet Terrence said - ""I am a man. Nothing human is alien to me"". Well that is this show.

It's all about this experience we are all going through. What it means to be human. Mankind in its diverse shades co-existing on this all too large blue marble in the sky.

Northern Exposure gave me so many moments of pause, of joy, of smiling sadness, of deep thought, that I know and feel that I am a better person because of it. In this age where it seems everything conspires to tear us all apart, to isolate us, to scare us, where small town community is portrayed in post-apocalyptic shows like Jericho (highly recommended viewing by the way),and Mother Nature has us all on the run, that somewhere beyond the sea, and over the rainbow, North to Alaska, is Cicely, waiting to be found, visited, explored, and loved over and over again. It reminds us that we are supposed to be a community, and not isolated technology worshippers, locked away, in our sterile and efficient apartments/houses.

So hug your neighbor!!

PS - And yes, this is the weakest season of Northern Exposure. Its kinda like all the turmoil of the 21st century came early to our beloved town. The season, in some ways, was just not congruent with the overall theme of show and the characters acted, well, out of character. David Chase does deserve a minor pummeling. But still, it is the greatest television show to grace the waves and most likely they'll be watching it in a 100 years!",1186617600,14,1866,4.568862275449102

This show was terrific until the last season, where it looks like crappy writers took over?  Once Joel became awol and his personality changed, the show went downhill fast.  The final Joel episode was quite good though, with a magical kind of ending, and perhaps the series should have ended there.  Not only were Joel's replacement characters boring, but the stories themselves were also not nearly as good as in the previous 5 seasons.

I give it 1 star not because season 6 was as bad 1 star shows, but I'm comparing it to the other seasons, which I would rate 4 or 5 stars.",1185494400,10,763,4.54014598540146

Unfortunately, the final season was marred by uneven writing and less than stellar episodes. I also own all previous five seasons; in those, virtually every episode was a gem.  Not so in season six.  All that being said, two of the season six shows make purchasing this set a ""must"" for series fans. Joel's quest for the ""Jeweled City of the North"" and final episode, ""Tranquility Base"", with its wonderful closing scene with ""Our Town"" sung in the background, bring the series to a satisfying end.",1185062400,4,600,4.920792079207921
2713700,3,B000LSAJ5M,"One of the great things about this series was its great selection of pop songs for every important occasion, conclusion, or ending. There are two songs that really stuck with me for season 6.  The seaon 6 DVDs kept one of those songs. The series finale still has the tune ""Our Town"" as the theme to the great montage at the end of the episode. However, the last episode that Rob Morrow starred as Dr. Joel Fleishman had a song called ""Forever Night Shade Mary"" by the ""Latin Playboys"" that was a great fit for the moment Joel returns to his natural state. That song is sorely missed!! All the replacement songs sound hokey, but I can forgive a lot of them. However, some of these episodes are forever linked in my brain with the original songs...

So in short, NE was a great, great tv series that may have had another year or two of good tv left, if Rob Morrow had stayed on. The DVDs don't have the original songs (except season 1) and it's a big distraction for those who know the show well. But I admit, the stories are so fun and quirky I still had to buy all the DVDs.

Joel becomes rather likeable, the new doctor and his wife are good enough characters that you don't miss Fleishmann as-doctor;  but, there seems to be some need to marry-off Maggie, which with Joel in serious fade out, leaves her flirting around with Chris, the D.J., which didn't work for me.  It's the finale that is the real let down.  After six years, we are taken to a new set (Maurice's new summer cabin) with all the main characters (minus Joel, and Maggie for most of the show) invited for the weekend.  Holling gets the worst role and, with Shelly, pretty much hides out the entire episode.  The new doctor's wife gets a pretty good feature spot in the ""plot"", and an old guest character returns to delight the viewer.  Then, seemingly lost for ideas, the last show of the entire story just begins to fade, and fade, and there you are, left with nothing and feeling as if you missed a chance to say good bye.  Fortunately, Season Six, along with Season Five, is one of the better written seasons, even with the miserable non-Finale.

2713709,5,B000LSAJ5M,"It had to come to an end sometime, but the sixth season still held so much promise that it was very poignant seeing the lights turned off and the shades drawn in the touching finale of ""Tranquility Base.""  We had just gotten to know the Capras, with Dr. Phil in some amusing episodes like ""Little Italy,"" where he smells a pasta sauce only his dear Aunt Jemima could have made, only to discover a vibrant Italian community in Cicely, even if it found itself at odds with each other.  Joel finally loses himself in the wilderness.  It wasn't completely convincing but it was fun just the same, especially when Marilyn shows up for a potlatch, discovering that he still hadn't lost his ego.  Some episodes where complete throwaways such as the amusing episode in which Marilyn recounts a tale of a relative who may have foiled a treaty between Lenin and the surviving Romanov family, giving the cast another opportunity to play dress-up.  However, you know the show is winding down when recurrent characters make their curtain call such as Adam in ""The Quest,"" and Cal, who manages to tug at Officer Semanksi's heartstings in ""Let's Dance."" Even Rabbi Schulman makes one more call, discovering Michelle lost in the woods in the final episode.  Joel bids an earlier adieu in a fascinating dream sequence in ""The Quest."" This may have been the best foray into the subconscious of all the episodes.

Northern Exposure was a great series, and it was a treat to be able to view it all over again on DVD.  Some of the music may have been lost, but the episodes ring as true today as they did a decade ago when they were first telecast.  Never one to oversentimentalize, Ruth Ann seemed to sum up the show best in her weekly readings on NPR, which had everyone clamoring to have their stories told one more time.",1177459200,7,1803,4.609375
2713710,4,B000LSAJ5M,"Season six of Northern Exposure saw the departure of Rob Morrow from the role of Dr Joel Fleischman, purportedly over contract disputes. In Joel's final episode, ""The Quest"" there seems to be some light hearted jabbing fun of this making reference to 'Quiz Show'. So could the show have lasted without it's primary character? So many shows are proof that removal of the central character is the downfall of the show, we can only assume that's the reason here. Personally I think they could have made it through another season but it could also have hurt themselves dreadfully. In hindsight, it's probably good that NE ended with this season in a bittersweet moment.

This season was full of ups and downs, there were some great quirky episodes such as 'Ursa Minor' where Ed becomes surrogate mother to a bear cub. We also see Ed become a private detective, house sitter, theater employee, as well as his jobs at Maurice's, Ruth Anne's, scriptwriting,  and a shaman-in-training. Maggie partakes of becoming mayor and buying the locale movie theater (as well as bush piloting and real estate). Joel changes his life view after living with Maggie and he runs of to an even more backwoods village upriver. Mid season enters the replacement characters of Phil & Michelle Capra. Michelle becomes a more central character than the new doctor does, and she quickly became annoying in the show. About this time, we are also treated to the rather forced courtship of Maggie and Chris-in-the-Morning. The last episode left something to be desired for a series finale but the final song ""Our Town"" was a perfect song end for the series. One problem I always had with the finale was Maggie wasn't in it until the last 7-8 minutes, if that. You don't get the explanation until you see the deleted scenes.

As for the dvd set itself, I think better planning could have gone into this set and there should have been six discs instead of five. Two or three of the discs have 5 episodes each on them while the others only have four. The best thing is the deleted scenes are now accessible along with each episode they pertained to. More great still shots of the cast decorated the covers, and come in an orange box this time around. Menus are easy to follow and even some of the original music managed to stay in place. Sadly, still no 'gag reels' unless they are hidden features somewhere, but I can't find any.

2713714,4,B000LSAJ5M,"After watching the first 5 episodes in the past five months, I was excited about seeing the sixth season again as well....(or so I thought!)

I think I hurt and cried more this time than the first when Dr Joel left us. Maybe it was the knowing of the series coming to an end, or the truth that Rob Morrow and Dr FLeischman were as much a part of the show as flour and sugar are part of a great cobbler (sorry, if you're from the south you know how much that means! Plus I have a great blackberry cobbler receipe if you need one!) Anyway, I watched a few of the episodes and had to stop.  I was getting so emotional with the thought of our beloved Dr Joel on his way out the door.  I think what made it so much worse is that the Doc took on that whole new attitude toward nature when he moved in with the natives near the end.  It was as though you really wanted to love him now. Which is what we wanted all along.  But I hoped and prayed he would marry Maggie in the process. The NY attitude could have still worked with this I am sure.  These writers could pull off most anything.....Except.....enter the Capras.  How dull, hum drum can you get?  I guess loving Dr Joel so much makes yo hate them even more.

Finally I watched the very last episode and it was the best that could happen I guess considering.

I moped around for a few days, down and out about the end season.  I did get a boost from a fan that wrote ""A Northern Exposure Valentine...To the Better End"" which you can Google and read for yourself.  What a great rewrite of how the show should have really ended.  I feel closure now after reading (the fans) verson and will keep it in my head as the true ending.

Sometimes now I watch NUMBERS and try to see bits and pieces of Joel in the Epps character, and of course, he is not there.  Great acting by the way.  He even sounds completely different.

I know, get over it!  The series as a whole was one of the best on TV.  I beleive that had Rob not left it could have still been around.  So many things worked togther for the cast, crew, plot...ect.

I actually thought the first half of this season was pretty damn good, and disagree with the notion that Morrow's character was just going through the motions.

Going on without Joel or a new doctor, and maybe gradually introducing new character(s), I think the show could've worked for a while longer at least. By trying to replicate the original formula of the show rather than trying something truly new, it just seemed like self-parody. I try to just pretend that the series ended when Joel left. The new doctor and his wife were a massive shark jump. That said the first half of season 6 was great and I look forward to watching it again... and perhaps after all these years, I'll even look on the last half of the season in a more positive light.

But the entire feeling that I remember so fondly from the end of the episode entitled ""The Quest"" is altered by the change in music from the original. Years ago when it first aired, ""Forever Nightshade Mary"", by the Los Lobos side project band Latin Playboys, played over Rob Morrow's final scene on the show. I distinctly remember the calming, almost zen impression it made, twelve years after it first aired.

Now, it's gone, replaced with something that sounds like Rosemary Clooney or Ethel Merman, something that has far more bombast, and was no doubt cheaper to license for the DVD set. Do I love the fact that I can get the show on DVD? Yes. But it would be disingenuous to say that I don't cringe everytime I hear a piece of music that I know didn't play when the showed aired originally, as music played such an integral part of the mood and feel of the show. This is a case in point illustration of the effect of choice of music in television.

He left the town much more in touch with himself than he was when he arrived - which was a fitting conclusion to a journey through a place of magic.

My only complaint of course is the changed music (my set of tapes of the televised versions, incomplete though it may be, has a new reverential status - at least I can revisit the show and view it with the music intact) and the final show. It had it's moments but I was disappointed that Barbara never evolved at all and watching mighty Maurice accomodate her almost made me sick. And not enough was done to flesh out the Chris and Maggie plotline in the last season, making it hardly believable that they would end up together. It was almost as if the writers were embarrassed to put them together but felt that some type of conclusion to their individual story lines was needed.

Overall, a wonderful series that I would recommend to anyone who loves quirky characterizations and a fun, offbeat exploration of the human condition.",1173225600,13,1231,4.54054054054054
2713743,4,B000LSAJ5M,"When Rob Morrow announced, at the end of the 5th season, that he would not be renewing his contract to do the show, it sent the producers on a hunt for a replacement.  Since the show had started as a Summer Replacement show, Rob still had six months left in his five year contract to fulfill.  This meant that he had to appear in some of the sixth season episodes, and Rob seems to be just walking through these episodes waiting for his contract to expire.

While Dr. Joel Fleischer was the basis character for the series, the town itself quickly became the star.  So the death of the series at Rob's announcement was not a given situation, replacements worked fine for M*A*S*H which had the similar ensamble style (but it was not Hawkeye they were losing).  The producers introduced a new town doctor, but this time he was not neurotic and would not be persuing Maggie (he was happily married).  That was the trouble.  In a town full of neurotic characters, replacing neurotic #1 with a bland character having less personality that the town's totum pole just reminded fans that the series was ending after all.

One would think that with six months notice a better replacement could have been found.

Fans could also have troubles with the character transformation of DR. Joel Fleischman.  He starts off this season like other seasons, but he quickly becomes a different character than the one we grew to enjoy.  Watching the last 10 episodes of this season could be like watching a slow death, almost like watching ""After M*A*S*H"".  The surreal series finale is perfect for this surreal series, and should have happened a few episodes earlier than it did.  The nice part about watching this on DVD is that you can skip over those Morrow-less episodes.

I think that the town of Cicily Alaska could have survived the loss of DR. Joel Fleischman had the right replacement character been found.  The first 5 episodes are classic Cicily.  When Shelly meets the Devil the outcome is in the true spirit of the series.

Others have listed the episodes, so I will not repeat this information.",1173139200,47,2086,4.702479338842975

8163967,4,B000LSAJ5M,"I loved this series in the beginning. However, the blond bar girl character did get on my nerves. She was pregnant in the first season, but she's not pregnant in the second season. And there's no baby!

There was a clear main character goal in the first season, get back to NYC. But the main character is not a main character in the final season due to actor-studio contract disputes. So the goal, getting back to NYC, is not achieved. The series ends with other characters instead.

I devour fiction, especially fantasy and science fiction. Westworld and Outlander are a couple of my current favorites.

If the above shows don't sound interesting here are a few of the series I really enjoyed watching more than once. I love good miniseries like Band of Brothers (2001), Frank Herberts Dune (2000), Into the West (2005), Lonesome Dove (1989), Pride and Prejudice (1995), Taken (2002) and The 10th Kingdom (2000) because they have beginnings, middles and endings, like a good novel.

Other shows Ive really enjoyed include Battlestar Galactica (2004-2009), Breaking Bad (2008-2013), Cowboy Bebop (1998), Downton Abbey (2010-2015), Firefly (2002), Game of Thrones (2011-2019), The IT Crowd (2006-2013), Jericho (2006-2008), Lost (2004-2010), Rome (2005-2007), Spartacus: Gods of the Arena (2011), Spartacus: Blood and Sand (2010), Stargate: SG-1 (1997-2007), Stargate: Atlantis (2004-2009), Star Trek The Original Series (1966-1969) and Star Trek Voyager (1995-2001). I didn't list any contemporary series Im following that don't have an end date yet, not conducive to binge watching from beginning to finish, or the hundreds of other fantasy and science fiction shows Ive watched.

If you like reading try some of my favorite fantasy and sci-fi authors: Richard Adams, Palo Bacigulupi, Suzanne Collins, Abe Evergreen, Diana Gabaldon, Hugh Howey, George Martin, Brandon Sanderson, John Scalzi, and Andy Weir.",1520812800,,1907,5.343333333333334
