8353604,3,B0026T2ZWE,"AA DEKHEN ZARA (""Come, Let's See"") runs just under two hours although, sorry to say, it feels more like three hours, the normal length of a Bollywood flick. Neil Nitin Mukesh and Bipasha Basu star in this thing and if you're at all familiar with Bollywood, then you right away realize that these two ain't exactly A-listers. AA DEKHEN ZARA is a thriller with a paranormal element and I was pretty intrigued going into this one. What a waste of anticipation.

Here's the plot: Ray Acharya is a down-and-out freelance photographer who inherits his dead grandfather's mysterious camera. It doesn't take too long for Ray to realize that the camera has the ability to take pictures of the future and Ray, a step away from being out on the street, is quick to see the possibilities. But somewhere along the way, his raking in the almighty rupee just about costs him his girlfriend. Not that it matters that much, anyway, because the film doesn't really develop their romance and there's simply no sizzle between the two leads. I blame Bipasha Basu more for this, because she's always been a stiff actress. Newcomer Neil Nitin Mukesh is someone whom I haven't seen before, although, apparently, his debut made an impression in JOHNNY GADDAR. Mukesh isn't at all bad in this one and he does have this earnest quality about him. But I'm not sure you'll care for his character all that much. Ray Acharya goes into avaricious jerkmode really quickly.

The film tries to instill a sense of immediacy by featuring a date stamp device which counts down to the big finale, but it's an empty set-up with a hollow follow-through. What really kills the movie is the dragging nature of the story. It starts off really slick and you do get into it, but then the screenplay tanks it; the film's second half really falls flat and you start to see every twist coming (the ominous blank photo is fairly easy to figure out). Anyway, with Ray gambling so often and winning so many wagers, it does make sense that certain characters soon set their eyes on him. An enigmatic femme fatale is soon chatting him up. And then the government. A menacing figure calling himself ""the Captain"" is soon hassling our guy, and things quickly turn very dangerous.

Except that, under the plodding constraints of this film, there's never really a consistent sense of excitement. The only time things became nail-biting was when I started grooming myself. Even a change of venue from India to Thailand fails to infuse energy. Also, I wish whoever wrote the thing had played around more with the story's paranormal concept. I can't help but feel they could've done more with this most unusual camera. Speaking of which, if you're looking for a better executed version of this sci-fi premise, then check out the episode titled ""A Most Unusual Camera"" from the original Twilight Zone series.

AA DEKHEN ZARA offers the most obvious cue yet for a musical number when one thug in a Bangkok bar menacingly asks our two leads: ""Can you dance?"" This being a Bollywood film, well... duh. It's a shame that the film doesn't do justice to the musical sequences, which aren't bad at all (I liked ""Rock the Party"" & ""Mohabbat Aapse""). And, in the ""This is so stupid it's kind of funny"" department, there's one scene in which an armed robber bursts into a liquor store, demands money from the teller but then instantly shoots him dead. That's pretty much the kind of movie you're dealing with.

Bonus stuff on this DVD include the Making Of the Film featurette (the cast & crew interviews are conducted in English); a song selection option; the music video of the title song ""Aa Dekhen Zara""; remixes of the songs ""Aa Dekhen Zara"" & ""Gazab""; and the promotional musical launch of AA DEKHEN ZARA, in which Rising Band performs songs from the film, with Bipasha and Neil grooving in the back.",1264723200,,3834,4.724962630792227
8353605,3,B0026T2ZWE,"This wasn't a bad little thriller. It looked good and had a well flowing modern look and pace.
It is about a photographer who inherits his grandfathers camera. He finds it will take pictures of the future. If it takes a black blank shot the person is going to die that day. He uses it exclusively to make money in the beginning but then to try to save his life in a series of chases and action.
It is an action film and there are some shootings but they aren't graphic. So if you try to avoid some of the more violent Indian movies this really was more of the fantasy/action type or implied and not one of their nastier ones. The focus is more on chase and story unfolding.
While this is Bollywood and there is some music and dance, it is all in the context of the action (e.g. at bars where a floor show might be expected). The music was bright but not that memorable except one of two numbers (including the title song).
Neil Nitin Mukesh in the lead role is very good and one to watch in future. His girlfriend is played by Bipasha Basu who also does a good job.
If this movie lacked a little in 'zip' or 'sparkle' it was partly that it lagged a little when the guy is repetitively just making money with his find. I would have liked to see him explore the possibilities of the camera more beyond this limited use. However for a young man in debt perhaps this is what would happen.
The movie ends with a teaser - the guy has another of his grandfathers inventions and it too seems to do unusual things with time. We don't get to see what he will do with this and it dangles the possibility of a sequel. I doubt it will get one as the movie received a mediocre response in India. I wonder if it will appeal more in the West where we like sci-fi and fantasy-type 'what if.."" themes more than the Indians seem to.
Look I think they did this well and it is somewhere between a 3 and a 4 for me. Elsewhere on the Net it seems to be rating mostly around the 5-7 out of 10 sort of range.",1241136000,,1983,4.11340206185567
