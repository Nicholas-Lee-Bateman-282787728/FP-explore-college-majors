It doesn't keep your attention at all. I real dissapointment. If you are  looking for a good Sandra Bullock movie, rent While You Were Sleeping!",956448000,,285,4.377358490566038
878073,2,6304458932,"While watching In Love and War, one will most surely get up many times and leave the room to do something else, preferably something tie consuming. A no-no by many accounts, the attempt by Richard Attenborough to recount the  story of Ernest Hemingway and his love affair with a WWI nurse starts as  something promising. Yet, the promise is broken in the first four minutes,  and the viewer is left to dwindle among the every-so-long plot, which seems  to have no sense of balance. While the movie may be accurate as far as the  real story goes, it is certainly not entertaining enough. The actors do  what they can to contribute emotion and gumption into their characters, yet  this, along with well-designed sets and scenery, is not enough to give  moviegoers what they want. Only for solid fans of Bullock and/or O'Donnell,  and no one else.",955670400,,844,4.726027397260274
878074,3,6304458932,"People shouldn't pay too much attention to professional critics; sometimes one wonders about their agenda, not to mention their cynicism. I'm not impressed by Chris O'Donnell so far in anything he's done.  ""Robin"" seems to be his high point. Sandra Bullock, on the other  hand, graces anything in which she cares to appear. The lady brings a  ""real people"" effect to her roles. We'll see her accepting that  little gold statue one of these years. The film isn't any blockbuster; as a  war movie, it's fair. As a romance flick, it's OK. As a commentary on  Hemingway, O'Donnell isn't the one to bring life to the crusty, alcoholic,  arrogant, would-be patriarch (if he could stay family-oriented long enough)  that was ""Papa"" Ernest. Not bad cinema, just kind of mediocre.  Without Sandy Bullock, however, it would be pretty seedy.",923961600,5,830,4.956521739130435

878514,4,6304458932,A good movie essentially about a young Ernest Hemingway and how he had a brief love affair with an older American nurse. It is a well done movie that I greatly enjoyed and would recommend to anyone. Sandra Bullock is a wonderful actress she pulls off the role of a nurturing personality well. O'Donnell does a good job of portraying a young cocky Ernest Hemingway who originally is intent on trying to seduce a beautiful nurse. In a farewell to arms Hemingway wrote how a man who is trying to seduce a women is as if he were playing poker with her at first you're trying to win to sleep with her. But some where along the line you forget how the game started and you wind up falling in love with each other. Love is the enduring theme of this movie. It is almost always a major theme in almost all of Hemingway's works.,1399248000,,819,4.290322580645161

While some of the supporting actors are a bit marginal, and the story is likely a bit contrived and embellished, the basic premise is true - as was the significant psychological change that seemed to impact Hemmingway for the remainder of his life.

878661,5,6304458932,"I had not expected to like this movie at all having seen some bad reviews when it first came out.  I got a very good price on it and sat down to watch it one evening when I was sick with the flu. I never like anything when I have the flu.  But, I fell under the spell of it right away. Keeping in mind that WWI was the bloodiest war in history with the most suffering in the trenches and the most horrendous loss of life, I thought all that was well represented without it being too gory.  Knowing as much as I do about Hemingway, I could well imagine that this is a true portrayal of how he was at the age of l8. Smartass, egotistical, clueless, handsome, charming. Chris O'Donnell fit the role perfectly. Those who think he did not are thinking of Hemingway as he was when he was older, not this ""kid"". All of the cast were wonderful. I was particularly impressed by Mackenzie Astin. I wondered if he was the son of Patty Duke Astin as I seemed to see a resemblance and when I googled him I saw that indeed he is. While I'm sure the movie is not absolutely factually true, I think it comes close and it is the way I prefer to believe that it happened.  It is a very believable telling of the story with everything you could ask for in a romantic tragedy.  I wonder if this experience and the way it ended did, indeed, haunt Hemingway the rest of his life. Certainly something haunted him. After all, he never wrote a story about a happy man. All of his heroes are tragic jaded figures. I've often wondered why Sandra Bullock has not been cast in more dramatic roles. She has been wasted on light romantic comedies.  I was amazed at her performance in ""Infamous"" as Harper Lee. Could hardly believe what I was seeing.  And, she is wonderful in this movie. Absolutely believable all the way. And looks lovely. It is beautifully filmed with the unmistakable Attenborough touch. He always gives the audience quality. I highly recommend this movie.",1347840000,2,1945,4.356353591160221

878717,5,6304458932,"I don't understand all these bad reviews, I really liked and was deeply touched by this movie. Both Chris O'Donnell and Sandy deliver solid performance and the movie conveys the dark and uncertain atmosphere of the times. The love affair of Hemingway and Von Kurowsky had a profound influence on the iconic writer's further career and this story will strike home for any guy who has been involved with an older woman. A very touching and believable love story. The movie is not factually accurate at times, for example, Agnes was engaged to an Italian officer, not a doctor, and there is credible evidence that Agnes and Arnie never met afterwards. Nonetheless, I guarantee that you are going to enjoy this film, and I highly recommend it.",1273968000,,739,4.826771653543307

While bravely risking his life in the line of duty, he is injured and ends up in the hospital, where he falls in love with his nurse, Agnes von Kurowsky. Bullock and O'Donnell have a wonderful chemistry, and the lighthearted moments are weighed against a tale of great agony and suffering without being preachy or too painful. There are serious moments, when the reality of life and war come home to Ernest, and there are beautiful moments, when Catherine explores Italy. It's a wonderful mix of the dramatic and the light, without being overdone or showy. A very absorbing story of the young Ernest Hemmingway.",1267833600,,689,4.8474576271186445

878720,5,6304458932,"Although I've seen this movie twice and enjoyed it very much both times, I believe I can understand some of the negative reactions on the part of some viewers (and critics).  Some of the criticism rests on the more subdued way in which Sandra Bullock plays Agnes (inconsistent with the personality of the historical figure) and the final scene which, in fact, did not occur.  That said, many productions supposedly based on actual events take incredible departures from historic reality, such as the much-acclaimed ""Saving Private Ryan,"" which fills the screen with gripping action and terrific performances all-round, but creates a myth that all but a two in a squad of men died finding and saving Private Ryan.  So, even as a historian and WWI buff, I found the departure in this case not all that drastic and the performance of Sandra Bullock, someone I enjoy seeing on the big screen, in a more subdued and sombre role not only different and refreshing, but perhaps a more interesting and evocative choice on the part of Sir Richard Attenborough .  I could be wrong, but I believe some of the critics and reviewers simply wanted to see Sandra Bullock in a more characteristically plucky role and, quite simply, a movie with considerably more action.",1190764800,2,1253,4.868544600938967
878721,5,6304458932,"I bought this for my girlfriend and had to watch it cause it was supreme orders from the upper management :)

At the beginning I thought this was going to be a boring movie. In fact the beginning was kinda slow and as I don't like romantic movies I felt itched by the fact of watching the movie. The story was caring and developing, all those events happening and the love story in the middle, at the end I could understand the feelings of Ernest Hemingway... it is painfull to know someone that you have loved betrayed you and let you down.

Still the movie is really really good, it had me sitting onthe couch watching the movie, something not any romantic movie can do for me.",1190678400,,679,4.338582677165355
878722,1,6304458932,"I half expected to loathe this movie before I sat down to watch it, so I can't really complain that I was let down or that it proved an utter disappointment.  Just by looking at the front of the DVD I knew this was going to be a very substandard film.  Don't get me wrong entirely; I like Sandra Bullock, I won't lie.  For some reason I find myself drawn to her despite the fact that she's not really the greatest actress out there and time and time again she chooses the worst role for her career, but I still love her and will watch anything she's in just to watch it (watch something like `Two Weeks Notice' or `While you were Sleeping' and you'll instantly understand why I love her).  Chris O'Donnell on the other hand is not someone I'm even remotely drawn to nor do I care to watch anything he attaches himself to.  All that said, I sat down to watch `In Love and War' because my wife remembered liking it years ago and I can safely say when it was all over she had changed her opinion of this waste of a film.

Biopic's are actually one of my favorite genre's of film.  I love to see real life displayed in an interesting and entertaining way.  The life of Earnest Hemingway could have been very interesting and entertaining had the cast and script been nailed down a little tighter.  I actually have much hope to see Hemingway's story done right next year when James Gandolfini takes on the lead role in the upcoming biopic.  Here though O'Donnell really adds no light or layers to his character and thus does Hemingway a huge disservice, painting him as immature and unlikable.  I had so much trouble understanding why these two people were so drawn to each other.  Bullock may be miles ahead of O'Donnell but that only goes to further prove how terrible O'Donnell is here, for Sandra herself is mediocre at best.

The film follows Hemingway as he embarks on an affair with a Red Cross nurse right years his elder.  Even with its focus on this part of his life it could have broadened better and became more than just a poorly constructed love story.  It had plenty of potential and judging by the director Attenborough's other work it's almost embarrassing to place this in the list.  In fact `Shadowlands' is one of my favorite biopic's for it truly fleshes out the people we're supposed to be caring about.  `In Love and War' does nothing of the sort.  It plays out like a made for TV movie, one that you would never waste your time actually watching.  There are a few scenes that are touching, all of which deal with other characters, but they are far from enough to rescue this film from mediocrity.  In the end, `In Love and War' does nothing for me besides help me to realize that sometimes you can judge a book, or in this case a film, by its cover.",1185494400,,2767,4.3882352941176475

878724,4,6304458932,"Despite many of the reviews, I think this is quite a nice piece. It is a sad love story based upon the first love of Ernest Hemmingway.

Chris O'Donnell plays the young Hemmingway as a young American adventurer seeking excitement in northern Italy during the end of the first world war as a corpsman. He would rather be a soldier but he is too young and did not make it through the physical so he signs up for the Red Cross. While seeking excitement up on the battle line when he is supposed to be serving coffee behind the lines, he distinguishes himself by heroism as the trench is overrun and is wounded in the process. That brings him to a hospital where he meets the nurse who enraptures him.

Sandra Bullock plays the nurse. She is competent, caring and considers herself too old for the young Hemmingway. Still, she is attracted to him and fights a losing battle against his ""charm"". Meanwhile, just about everyone else wants her attentions as well. She finds herself being torn in differing directions by her heart on the one hand and her intellect on the other.

What makes this film difficult is that Sandra's character of the nurse is a very likeable person. O'Donnell's Hemmingway manages to be likeable as well except when his arrogance and vanity get in the way; I'm talking about Hemmingway's, not O'Donnell's. You get through this film thinking that she is just too good for him and that he doesn't deserve her. You also get a bit angry at her treatment of him at some points.

Love stories have to have a bit of conflict to make them interesting. This one has more than it's share. For that reason, the romance seems to be one destined for failure.",1133913600,7,1665,4.54
878725,3,6304458932,A Romantic movie with a sad ending. The only reason I think this movie isn't super great is because the emotional connection between the two main characters isn't developed enough. Its kind of like they fell in love the next day and thats it. I wish their getting to love eachother would have been more focused on. Still its not a bad movie.,1110326400,5,341,4.428571428571429
878726,4,6304458932,"Why some have condemned this movie for the lack of story line, I praise what factual information they were able to find although there was never any final meeting between Hemmingway and Agnes.  All correspondence was done through letters between them after Hemmingway went home from the war and little is known of the letters Hemmingway wrote Angus since a later boyfriend of Angus destroyed all of Hemmingway's letters in a jealous rage.  If there was in final face to face meeting, both their lives may have very different.  More than likely the two would have continued far different lives together.  Hemmingway may have never gone on to become the great writer he was and Agnes would have never continued her nursing career that she seemed much more married to, or a European whirlwind romance may have faded into the first of the many failed marriages Hemmingway went through.

Although a bit contrived from reality; the story line does make an impact emotionally.

In my opinion though Sir Richard Attenborough should have had his lead actors at least read A Farewell to Arms before attempting their roles.  It might have helped out with acting that was a little flat and emotionless at times like they didn't have enough material on the original characters and were trying to ad lib.  Still it's very much worthwhile watching this sometimes fictional account of a young Hemmingway and his first and lost love.",1094083200,7,1416,4.895397489539749

colorful. Add to that the superb performances on the parts
of Sandra Bullock and Chris O'Donnell and you have a winner. It is therefore no suprise that the film won high honors.  I think Sir Richard Attenborough's direction was suberb in every sense of the word.  Such an evocotave story with war as a backdrop truly brought forth an emotional tension that is hard to describe.  I also thought the supporting actors must have been hand picked because they fitted so easily in to the very fabric of the film.  I certainly give this film a roaring ""Five Star""

878768,4,6304458932,"I will readily admit, I am a complete sucker for love stories. They make me go all warm & gooey inside. And when you're not feeling too great, you can curl up and enjoy. There's hardly any violence - it's set at the end of WWI, there has to be a little violence, but that's all confined to the start - it has two great actors playing the parts, and it's set in beautiful countryside. What more could you want?
I've read a few of the reviews about this, and I have to disagree with nearly every person (sorry). You're not getting the movie really, are you? It's a love story. There are no complicated plots to follow. No twists and turns in the story. Hell, you don't even need to be that smart to watch this movie. And I'm certainly nothing of the sort in that department! Which is probably why I like these movies. You don't need to think much about them, and they're perfectly easy to follow.
There are some great love scenes in this, although there are is no graphic, mind-blowing sex. It's simple of how Agnes & Ernie eventually become a proper couple in the most romantic of places - a brothel. And then they have a ""waltz"" together, which is so romantic.
But the build up to their relationship can bring a little tear to the eye. (I told you I was a soppy cow) Whether it's Ernie telling Agnes that he loves her the first time he sees her, in a voice that will make me anyway go weak at the knees, or when he tries to comfort her after Jimmy dies. All are totally romantic. And other reviews say that there's no build up to their relationship, it's all over very quickly, but what they're forgetting - this was during a war, no one had time for quickness. Life's too short.
The finale is really sad. If you haven't seen it, then I'm not going to be the one to spoil it for you, but it's a real heart-breaker. Things could have been so different only if ... I'll stop there!
After watching this movie, it's got me interested in Ernest Hermingway's work, so that'll be something for me to keep my eye out for. I wouldn't say his work exactly, but probably the story of his life, and why losing Agnes made him so bitter. Plus, the fact he killed himself in 1961, and really, never got over losing Agnes. It would be quite interesting to read. Guess what I'm adding to my wishlist.
A great movie, if you're a bit simple, and like movies that you can actually follow most of the time.",1077235200,54,2385,4.267108167770419
878769,4,6304458932,"Curiosity after reading ""A Farewell to Arms"" led to the diaries of Agnes von Kurowsky and ultimately to Sir Attenborough's film.  The fact that the film takes some liberties with the actual timeline of the story (Agnes' assignments, her non-existent reunion with Hemingway in Missouri), the film itself was heartbreakingly beautiful. Chris O'Donnell did a fine job as the young Ernest Hemingway, but I wonder why the vibrant, flirtatious Aggie was played with such serious somberness by Sandra Bullock?  The Agnes we read about in the book was indeed a serious and committed nurse, but her personality was the polar opposite of the film portrayal. This is not to say that Sandra Bullock is a bad actress - I just think the direction for her character was wrong.
Ernest Hemingway clearly loved Agnes von Kurowsky with a passion that could only be fulfilled on the written page. For both parties involved, the timing of the love affair was ill-fated.",1069804800,8,948,4.955974842767295

Sure Chris and Sandra have starred in romantic movies, but they are unoriginal, and just like the next.  Chris O'Donnell was the last person who should have been picked for the role of such a noteworthy and distinguished American author.  This movie puts Ernest Hemmingway to shame.  Which is a complete disaster.  Where was the build-up of true love?  This movie bounced from one scene to the next, without ever convincing me Agnes and Ernest were truly in love.  This movie did not deserve the accolades it received from the critics.  It has the potential to be excellent, if there were different actors in the roles of Agnes and Ernest.  It had the potential to be good if it hadn't been so ""Hollywood-ized.""  If you're interested in Ernest Hemmingway's life, read ""A Farewell to Arms.""

878772,2,6304458932,"Very charming, but only a Hollywood concoction that 'rewrites' history, a totally invented concoction. Why do I say this? After seeing the film in 8/97 (just after visiting the War Museum in the Isonzo Valley in Kobarid, Slovenia) I went to the library and checked several out books on Hemingway's life. The film is false, except that Hemingway was a Red Cross volunteer in the Piave Valley and was accidentally wounded there. A product of Teddy Roosevelt's era, he went home to Illinois and walked around his neighborhood wearing an Italian officer's cape that he'd bought. One was supposed to be brave, and survive as a winner. One nice thing about the film: shots of Vittorio Veneto (more accurately, the old city known as Seravalle before the end of WWI) which is beautiful and is not recommended in tourist guide books. My wife and I spent 2 of the best days of our month-long Wanderung over the Alps in this region in '89. Finally, Hemingway himself was not Hollywood-style-sloppy: according to the books I consulted, he wrote so accurately historically and geographically that some Italian historians believed he'd been in the Isonzo Valley in the Slovenian Alps where the worst fighting of WWI between Italians and Austrians took place. He never visited the region. Frankly, it's a crime to let Hollywood teach 'history' under the guise of reckless, careless, entertainment. Also, for those who believe that war os glorious, I strongly recommend the War Museum (photos of men with half-shot-away faces, and worse).",1017792000,5,1522,5.019762845849803

If one expects to see Ernest Hemingway on screen, well, sorry, this movie is an Hollywood depiction of a mans life and writing.  With that in mind, O'Donnell plays the part to a 'T'.  After watching this movie if you didn't already have a yearning to read anything and everything by Ernest Hemingway, you will afterwards.  Sandra Bullock's acting is unparalleled in this movie.  I don't think I have ever seen her do another movie with quite the personal abandonment that she accomplished for this movie.  While Ernest Hemingway is one of my all time favorite authors, this movie helps me see a man aside from the author and more in keeping with the person he might have been.  Again, this is Hollywood and my ideas are speculation - but that makes a great movie for me.  A movie that makes me want to know more about many different things.  That is accomplished with ease in this film and I recommend it to everyone.",990403200,5,1075,4.5811518324607325
878776,5,6304458932,"Richard Attenborough's story of the relationship between Ernest Hemingway and Anges von Kurowsky (the inspiration behind the novel A Farewell to Arms) is recounted in this film.  It is truly an epic film, covering the last year of the First World War, during which time Hemingway was injured while a member of the Red Cross, to his meeting and blossoming love for Kurowsky, to the pensive, melancholy conclusion to their relationship after the war.
 The film has a rich, sweeping feel to it.  Attenborough does a wonderful job at direction, blending the gorgeous cinematography (from Italian battlefields to Venician waterways) with the loving, at-times heart-wrenching musical score.  However, the film is not manipulative, as most recent romance films are.  Instead, it is allowed to unfold slowly and naturally, and it has a more honest feel to the characterizations than you find in most mainstream Hollywood films.
 On its initial release, one of the main complaints about the film was the unusual casting of Chris O'Donnell as Hemingway and Sandra Bollock as Kurowsky.  In actuality, Bollock gives a very commendable performance, and I believe this film shows her best acting to date.  In most of her other films, she just plays Sandra Bollock with a different name, but here, she suppresses her usual idiosyncrasies and creates a true character.  While I enjoyed a lot of her other films (Speed, While You Were Sleeping), this is really her best and most underrated performance.  O'Donnell is somewhat less successful - it is hard to imagine him as a young Hemingway, and he seems like an anachronistic Boy Wonder.  His mannerisms don't seem to fit with a 1910s mentality.  However, he is not terrible, as some reviewers might have you believe.  He delivers a decent performance; in fact, if you drop any pre-conceived notions of the real Ernest Hemingway and try to view O'Donnell's character as just another spunky youth caught in the excitement of wartime, his performance works well in the context of the film.
 Personally, I like this film a lot.  It's gorgeous, it's romantic, and it feels like a sweeping epic.  If you enjoy films like The English Patient or A Room with a View, you'll enjoy this film.
 Just a few words about the DVD, which I bought....this is an essentially bare-bones DVD.  There are the usual small extras (subtitles, trailer, cast notes) but nothing else.  You can choose to view it as widescreen or full-screen.  But there is no commentary or documentary...
 So, if you like romantic films, give this film a chance....you may be surprised at how it slipped by your notice.  Recommended!",970704000,32,2623,4.9816091954022985

It's the true story of Ernest Hemingway's love for the nurse who cared for him in WWII, with Sandra playing the ""older woman"" (though, by today's standards, not THAT much older).  It's a story that unfolds and isn't meant to startle, excite or sweep anybody away.  It allows the viewer to share in a very personal and sensitive event that would forever shape the rest of Hemingway's life; an experience that he would never recover from.  Every time I watch this movie, my heart aches to replay the ending and have it all turn out different, but, as in all life, we don't usually get to have happily ever afters of the fairy-tale kind.
