However, the setting (the Avebury stone circle), the specific twist, the cast, the eerie theme tune and the superb script make for one of the most amazing science fiction series ever developed for such young children. It must be remembered that this series would have been watched by the same age group as watched The Muppets and Sesame Street. It is a pity it is so rare.",1198886400,,526,4.5473684210526315
