OTHERWISE HE IS A LOUSY INTERVIEWER.",1405036800,,80,4.0625
8429645,4,B004HO6AIG,"The Charlie Rose Brain Series is a wonderful series.  I always look forward to these panels, each of which includes distinguished experts who offer valuable insight into the brain.  Understanding the brain and how it functions is essential to have a full understanding of life.

Topics include the following:
- The growth, development and aging of the brain throughout life
- How our brain perceives the world around us
- How our brain makes decisions
- Mental disorders
- Creativity, pleasure, addiction, emotion, etc.

The DVD is highly recommended but it is a bit expensive and does not contain all the available content to date.
All the interviews can be viewed at the official Charlie Rose website (link in comments section below).",1343865600,3,736,5.008196721311475
8429646,5,B004HO6AIG,"Everyone agrees this series is of very high quality but the cost of $25 per episode is prohibitive for us 99%ers...so, what to do? Buy this ""highlights"" video and get the Cliff Notes version with soundbytes instead of discussions? No, just rent the episodes for $1.99 each from Amazon as Instant Video Rentals.",1325376000,8,310,4.867924528301887
