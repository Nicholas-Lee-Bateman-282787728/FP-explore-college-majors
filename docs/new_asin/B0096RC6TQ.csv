8536950,5,B0096RC6TQ,"This was a new series that I had never seen in the past, but I have to say that the series was action packed and a lot of fun overall. I was surprised to find how strong the cartooning was as well as the story itself, as I did not know what to expect, but it was not what I received which was great as I always enjoy being surprised!

My favorite episode in this was probably The Hunted. I truly enjoyed the story and characters in this episode, but really all of the episodes were fun, filled with adventure and action. If you enjoy great fight sequences and magical creatures, you will love this DVD and series!",1352764800,6,613,4.194915254237288
