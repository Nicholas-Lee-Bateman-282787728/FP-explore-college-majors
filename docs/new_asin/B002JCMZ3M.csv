8371356,4,B002JCMZ3M,"Great movie,based on  fact,terrific acting,and the only reason I give it four stars and not five is because of the quirkinessof the French  Director,who insisted,for accuracy's sake, on some of the dialogue being spoken in French and Russian,in addition to English. I appreciate his concern for maximum integrity,but it does little for the viewer,and probably accounts for the reason why this film has become something of a forgotten gem.
For whatever reason,the film is also available with an alternative English style title,""Night Flight to Moscow"",but don't be fooled,its the same film,and it has the same problem in terms of some tri-lingual dialogue.",1492732800,3,655,5.411764705882353
