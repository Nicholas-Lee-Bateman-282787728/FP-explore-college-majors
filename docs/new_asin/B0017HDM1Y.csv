Scottish filmaker Mark Stirton has shot a 75 minute SF Action film called The Planet for just 8000. Balmedie Beach doubles for the planet in the stories title and the film and location work was shot in an hectic 10 days.

International body builder Mike Mitchell takes the lead role as Captain Morgan, if they ever make a film of Garth this is the man who'd be spot on. Most actors appear to have some background in TV and Film work and on the whole they're pretty good. Scott Ironside who plays Vince has a proper thick Scottish accent, and I'm not sure how many people outside the UK will be able to understand him. :)

Now I've always been a fan of Low Budget films, from Dark Star, Evil Dead, El Mariachi, Braindead and Silent Running. It's that whole thing of people having to be inventive with what's available as opposed to pumping millions of pounds/dollars into a project that doesn't need it. Now some of the films I've just mentioned seem big budget compared to Mark Stirton's 8000 quid. But they do a sterling job of making what they've got look good on screen, from converted Action-Man gun's from Toys 'R' Us to the use of a water tank as the ships escape modules.

The film is fun and from what the documentary tells you they never set out to make anything but a fun movie, it never decends into spoof which is good.

The DVD also has a 'making of' which brings Mark Stirton and his mates across as my kind of madmen. They have some good tales to tell about their 10 days of shooting and the work on the films Sound/Music and Visual FX, much of which was handled by 2 or 3 people.",1209081600,3,1761,4.292168674698795

8265876,4,B0017HDM1Y,"This is the kind of Indy film that takes you by surprise and makes you realize that there are still hidden gems out there.

To me, if a microbudget movie manages to entertain despite budgetary constraints, then it deserves distribution and better recognition.

Any true fan of low budget Scifi will be pleased to own a copy.",1420934400,2,324,4.666666666666667
8265877,4,B0017HDM1Y,"I caught the making of this film on a random documentary a few years ago and found it very funny. The movie was pretty good for the budget but because I had such a good time watching the making of it I actually found it very enjoyable. I would suggest watching the making first before the movie, it's likely on the dvd.",1399939200,,319,4.161290322580645
8265878,4,B0017HDM1Y,"The people who don't like this movie apparently weren't paying attention, cuz it's a reasonably good story, decent enough EFX, competent acting, and has a good action hook at both the beginning and the end.  Yeah, it's a lower budget flick, but they did fine with that, cuz I've seen so much Sci-Fi for the past 6 decades and there's a LOT of movies FAR worse than this.  Pacing gets a bit slow in the middle, and the Scottish brogue takes a wee bit of getting used to, but those little problems don't last too long at 80 minutes.  Mormons and Jehovah Witnesses should avoid it, but Craig Ferguson should love it cuz they cuss a blue-steak in parts of it.  Give it chance with an alert open mind (and maybe a good beer) and you'll find something to like.  Originally made in 2006.",1366761600,3,780,4.388888888888889
8265879,3,B0017HDM1Y,"This movie was not bad at all,for what I payed for it it is worth the price. You could tell it was low budget but alot of b movies are better then A Movies and this one is worth checking out",1326326400,2,190,3.658536585365854
8265880,5,B0017HDM1Y,"I saw this movie abouta weekago and needless to say i was actually impressed for a low budget movie which i normally refrain from veiwing this one had character, the appeal of the movie showing a almost Pitch Black esq storyline was there, the Actors while all scottish were indeed more heart felt than most of the movies coming out of the big name studios around the globe.

yes the CG effects will make the first season of babylon 5 look high end but sometimes you have to look beyond that and treat it as part of the character of the film. As it is not often we see film come out of Scottland there is a significance with this film to show that the scotts still want to be apart of the Movie Buisness.

Yea you may want to rent the movie so do so.",1241136000,5,750,4.13013698630137
8265881,1,B0017HDM1Y,"I rented this, for free, through the Redbox DVD rentals. I am so thankful it was free, after viewing, I could have rented a better movie for free. I've seen better acting and storyline by my neighborhood kids playing army.",1221609600,,222,4.575
8265882,1,B0017HDM1Y,"Okay, I get the whole thing about making an incredibly low budget movie and seeing what happens. But this is no grand adventure. The story was completely un-dramatic though it tried to open with a dramatic fight scene between a space cruiser and some unbelievable foe's. The effects were ""home grown"" I would guess. Perhaps generated on a laptop while mass quantities of alcohol were ingested. Then, the moment the fiery villain was revealed, I literally burst into laughter.

The captain of the ship was named Captain Morgan. This was appropriate because I believe a gallon of rum is what it would take to enjoy this movie, flat on my face and unconscious (don't drink and drive a space cruiser, by the way)

Now, would I recommend buying this movie? Not on your life! I rented it from ""Red Box"" for one dollar and feel gypped! At the end of the movie, I looked at my wife and we both simultaneously burst into laughter again.

After all of that, now that I think about it, please rent this film just to see what I am talking about. You would NEVER understand unless you saw it for yourself. I'm warning you, however, have a can of kerosene ready to wash your eyes out when the movie is over.",1219190400,8,1193,4.488479262672811
8265883,1,B0017HDM1Y,no real plot....the storyline does not make any sense. and what a terrible ending. i guess the flick had to end somehow. the computer generated explosions were cartoonist. this was a bad film.,1218844800,4,192,4.848484848484849
8265884,4,B0017HDM1Y,"Despite the bad reviews, I just had to see this film after I learned it had a $13,000 budget.

It wasn't great, but then again, it was better than a LOT of big budged Hollywood movies I've seen this year. In terms of entertaining me, it did slightly better even than Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull, and even better than the most recent Narnia Installment, Prince Caspian.

It had major problems, some acting errors, disjointed plot. But the special effects weren't bad for an indie sci-fi, and was a creative premise (much like Pitch Black).

Again, not great - but I would much rather small films like this get attention, and the directing/writing skills of new indie artists get developed, than continue to see the same old hundred-million-dollor formula films get recycled by Hollywood year after year.

I give it 3.5 stars.",1218672000,5,832,4.7972027972027975
8265885,1,B0017HDM1Y,I have never written for a review but I felt obligated to say that this is the worst movie ever. I would rather watch Glitter or a public access channel movie. I can't believe this found a way to my DVD player. Just terrible.,1217203200,4,225,4.136363636363637
