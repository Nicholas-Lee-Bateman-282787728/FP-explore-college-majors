8490311,5,B0060ANMA4,"Featuring a five camera shoot from a 2007 show at The House of Blues, Anaheim and vintage video from a 1983 San Francisco set and a 1985 Nurermberg, Germany concert, this DVD is a fitting testament to the greatness of this two guitar band originally from Davis, California.

The HOB show features excellent sound remixed by band member Russ Tolman.  Also included is a BONUS audio CD featuring a live show from Portland, Oregon.

The DVD also has standard features such as vintage photo gallery and discography.

Highly recommended to fans and anyone curious about '80s guitar rock!",1322179200,4,582,4.908163265306122
