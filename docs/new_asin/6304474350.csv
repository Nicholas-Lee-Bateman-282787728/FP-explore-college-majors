7871975,5,6304474350,"National Geographic's Land of the Tiger is perfect for a class discussing animal behavior because it is interesting, informative, and fascinating.  The animal sounds set the stage for a well-narrated story involving tigers in India.  It includes many useful vocabulary words that could be linked to a biology lesson.  It is also an outstanding example of outdoor photography, capturing vivid action scenes of tigers hunting, competing against other tigers, protecting their young cubs, and others.",1306886400,,497,5.6
7871976,5,6304474350,"Land Of The Tiger is an excellent documentary about tigers living in Kanha National Park and Ranthambhor National Park in India.  Tigers are shown carefully stalking through high grass and vigorously charging after their prey, including one slow-motion sequence of a tiger bounding through water to make a capture.  A large male tiger heaves up a dead 250-pound sambar in a lake and powerfully pulls the elklike animal through deep water and dense plants to the shore.  A tiger is successful in one of twenty hunting attempts.  At the beginning of the 20th century, there were 40,000 tigers in India, while there were less than 2,000 tigers by 1972.  I particularly liked the scenes of the tigress standing majestically on top of the wall ruins at Ranthambhor and of the tigress affectionately licking her cub.  There are also many close-up scenes of monkeys, sambar, spotted deer, birds, owls, flowers, streams, crocodiles, a water snake, insects, wild dogs, and wild cattle.  Bellowing, hoarse ""owoom"" roaring is featured at the beginning, middle, and end of the documentary.",1290816000,,1077,5.12

7871978,4,6304474350,"If you love tigers, you'll love this film.  It is all about the beautiful, rarely seen tiger.  The film is full of basic tiger facts, but anyone who has done any tiger research will not learn anything new.  Though I didn't learn anything new about tigers, I still enjoyed watching these powerful, graceful animals.",995241600,5,314,4.777777777777778
7871979,5,6304474350,"One of the best videos ever! This video really shows you the tiger in the best way possible. It's land, it's prey, and the way it struggles to stay on top of the food chain in the majestic jungles of India. It is breath-taking seeing the tiger this close and seeing footage that is normally rare to find, like mating. All my life I have loved the tiger, and this amazing video just makes me love him even more. The music and the scenery is just fabulous, especially watching the tiger walking in the ruins of Ranthambore like it's his kingdom. This movie has really inspired me to even go to India and visit these great parks and to see my favorite animal of all time. The Tiger is truley the most majestic of all cats!",978998400,8,719,4.294117647058823
7871980,5,6304474350,"If you're into wildlife videos run - don't walk - to your video store for this one.  There are many excellent videos on the Serengeti from National Geographic alone, and there is no one end-all classic in that area.  Not so  for Kipling country.  This video is the definitive chronicle of the tiger  and those who must live in it's shadow.  Two sequences - one of a tiger  taking down a sambar deer in water as the whole forest seems to take up a  collective warning cry and the other of a tiger walking along the roof edge  of an ancient temple - are alone worth the price. Absolutely magical.  This  is one for posterity to be watched over and over again.",962755200,10,657,4.30327868852459
