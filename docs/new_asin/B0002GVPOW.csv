8027938,4,B0002GVPOW," (War) is a film starring Aleksey Chadov (Ivan), Ian Kelly (John), and Ingeborga Dapkunaite (Margaret). The story takes place in the early 2000s during the Second Chechen War, where characters Ivan, John, and Margaret were first held as prisoners. Then, John and Ivan were released by the Chechens after John promised to bring back money, while they held Margaret for ransom. Ivan and John make eventually return to Chechnya and the rest of the story unfolds.

The way the movie is structured is as a story told in the past tense by Aleksey Chadov, who is sitting in a dark room smoking a cigarette and telling someone behind the camera what happened. Aleksey especially was convincing with his acting, expressing the appropriate emotions for each detail of the story he told. The sets were also convincing, especially in the first three minutes of the film where the setting was in chechnya and there were mountains in the background.

Another intriguing aspect of the films production was the music, which appeared to be popular music from the time during which the film was made and complimented the film in ways that increased the depth of emotion experienced by the audience. Finally, there was a running gag in the film where each time John, an Englishman, meets a Russian, they call him an American.

Though most aspects of the film are entirely fictional, it does a good job of portraying the significance of the second chechen war in Russian history and how it was perceived by Russians as a war to save Russia from terrorists/bandits.",1489017600,,1544,4.859315589353612
8027939,4,B0002GVPOW,"This is the story of three people, John and Margaret who are touring British Actors, who get captured by Chechen Rebels/Freedom Fighters/Terrorists, I will just call them Chechens. They are taken to some dive hole in the middle of nowhere; also there are captured Russian soldiers being held in conditions of slavery. One of the first things that happens is that two newly captured Russians are brutally murdered/executed in front of the hapless John and nigh on hysterical Margaret. His reaction is to demand to speak to the British Consul - oh dear has not quite worked out what is going on.

One of the captives is Ivan a Russian who knows computers, he is allowed to live whilst helping his captors; this entails systematic abuse and beatings. What the Chechens really want is money and or arms to continue the fight with Russia, so they ask for a ransom. The ransom is two million pounds, a bit high for a jobbing actor. After some haggling the Chechen decides to let John go, but keeps Margaret and gives him a month to get the money or they are going to be more horrible to her than they were to the first two Russians. They also release Ivan, but don't really say why.

What follows is a bit of a roller coaster of a ride as John mans up, tries to sell everything and raise the money and then goes back to Chechnya to get his beloved, but will he be in time and he doesn't know what end of a gun is the business end. So you guessed it he goes for Ivan's help.

This is a small budget film that does not let it show, none of the actors are well known, but they all deliver in spades. It does require a fair amount of belief suspension towards the end, but it is done so well that you hardly notice. I must say I ruddy well enjoyed it and think it should have received a much wider audience, there is genuine tension for most of it and themes that to go into would be plot spoilers. It is in Russian with plenty of English, especially as John can't speak a word of Russian. For fans of off beat films and even world cinema this one should not disappoint, I thoroughly recommend it.",1389744000,,2087,4.305343511450381
8027940,3,B0002GVPOW,"Does this version actually have subtitles? Because one I saw on youtube had no subtitles, but claimed to. It is a decent movie, but i could hardly understand it. The parts where anyone was speaking English were dubbed with Russian. The fact that I only know a few phrases and words in Russian did not help much, only a little.",1287446400,,326,4.45
8027941,5,B0002GVPOW,"This was a fantastic movie, with extreme and raw realism in depicting war in Chechnya. Although the central story of this movie is not directly involved with the war, the ever present signs and events of the 2nd Chechen War are at the peripheries of this story.  The main character is a young russian conscript soldier who begins the movie in the captivity of a ficticious Chechen warlard, Gugayev. He is joined by a British couple and a few other russians. He is released along with the male brit with the understanding that he will send offers of ransom for the other russians in captivity. The Brit meanwhile must find 1 million pounds in order to pay the ransom for his fiancee who is left behind.  The young russian and the Brit end up having their paths cross in attempting to reenter Chechnya and either free the other captives or die trying! Impressive scenes in the Caucases mountains.  Highly recommended, but beware, it is not a kids movie!",1120521600,3,951,4.648809523809524
