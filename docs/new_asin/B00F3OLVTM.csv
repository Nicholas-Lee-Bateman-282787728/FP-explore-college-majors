5966582,5,B00F3OLVTM,You will receive lots of good information with adequate and above average 3-D presentation with this film.,1420934400,,106,5.294117647058823
5966583,5,B00F3OLVTM,"The Galactic Adventures Double Feature (3D Sun / Mars 3D) Blu-ray is an excellent addition to my 3D collection of space images. While not the same quality as the NASA 3D IMAX Blu-rays, it was still enjoyable and definitely worth the price I paid. I always love viewing authentic NASA footage in 3D.",1401408000,4,298,4.6415094339622645
5966584,5,B00F3OLVTM,I recommend this double feature to 3D techno-geeks everywhere. They go together for an afternoon's enjoyment that let's me forget the current events nonsense appearing in each day's newspaper articles. It's too bad there are no portable 3D tv sets. I can't haul my 3D HDTV out to the pool each afternoon to watch my other astronomy 3D movies.,1400284800,2,342,4.813559322033898
5966585,1,B00F3OLVTM,"Compared to Hollywood professional 3D movies, this 3D had ghosting issues. The story and narration were lacking expected information that we would have gotten from an IMAX or NASA video.",1393632000,7,186,5.233333333333333
5966586,2,B00F3OLVTM,"Being a 3D enthusiast, I bought this for that purpose, but was disappointed that only part of it was in 3D, and not very good at that.  Not recommended for anyone expecting a good 3D presentation of our galactic system.",1388793600,20,219,4.475

5966588,4,B00F3OLVTM,Good 3D.  Nice pictures of Mars.  On a larger screen one can imagine standing on the planet.  The Sun picture are very interesting.,1460937600,,131,4.608695652173913

8612066,5,B00F3OLVTM,"Not all of this DVD is in 3D, but that's completely irrelevant for people with brains interested in astronomy. It delivers incredible views that resulted from an exercise in technology that represents thousands of hours of research and applied science. Bravo!",1504915200,,259,5.341463414634147

8612073,1,B00F3OLVTM,"Two very short video footage documentaries (each is less than 40mins) included in a bluray disc. The ""Sun 3D"" is with reasonable 3D effect, whereas the ""Mars 3D"" is totally nearly with no 3D effect (suspected it's a footage on 3D encoded error).",1473120000,4,245,4.72093023255814
