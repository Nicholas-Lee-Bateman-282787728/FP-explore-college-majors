5771692,5,B00D39UQ2W,I couldn't wait to get the blu ray for this series and it didn't disappoint and this is by far one of my favorite animes and there isn't a better heroine than satellizer...,1347321600,3,172,4.242424242424242
5771693,5,B00D39UQ2W,"This is a review of the blu-ray edition.  First off, it is the uncensored version, so if you don't like bare breasts, look elsewhere. It is somewhat on the same level as the first season of Queen's Blade.  I am a firm believer that even ecchi anime need a story line that holds together (as opposed to something like, say Master of Martial Hearts, which doesn't). The basic story line is that aliens are attacking, the only ones who can defend earth are girls with attack powers. Each girl has a guy with protection power(the Freezing in the title), which makes it different from other harems, where one guy attracts all the girls.

The heroine has awesome attack power, but due to a horrible upbringing (revealed later in the series), can't stand to be touched.  The hero, of course is the only one that can touch her, much to her consternation. The girls in the academy spend most of the time fighting each other, but all pull together in the end when the aliens attack again. Lots of blood, but the girls heal fast due to their special powers. Nothing terribly unique about all this, but it all hangs together and moves forward.

The artwork on the blu-ray is great, as are the colors. There are 6 OVAs, which are all pure fan service. The package was in good shape, but I did have to clean off one of this disks with an alcohol swab due to a smudge. Everything was great on my 52 inch TV.

Bottom Line: A very enjoyable anime, reminiscent of Evangelion.  They left the door open for a follow-on, since at the end of the credits we see Aoi's father tell Sister Margaret that it isn't ending, it's just beginning.",1346889600,26,1615,4.454237288135594
5771694,3,B00D39UQ2W,"This anime was an OK watch, a lot of nudity but alright to watch once in a while. the idea was good but I feel it would have been better if they spent more time attacking the enemy, the nova, instead of fighting each other. it was kind of a let down that the nova really don't even show up until the last few episodes. it did have some funny parts which are a plus but I would wait until there's a bigger price drop or when it comes out in a S.A.V.E. edition.",1346544000,,459,3.893617021276596
5771695,5,B00D39UQ2W,"this anime is intense,you will really enjoy this anime. not a bad episode in the series. has parts of seikrei,kaze no stimga and heaven's lost properety. the main person remines of tsukime from seikrei so does the man guy, and the #1 rival acts like musubi.",1346284800,,257,4.608695652173913
5771696,4,B00D39UQ2W,"As an anime, this is one of the strong women with men supporting them type.  It has a lot of violence, including blood and limbs being cut off, and partial nudity.  Even with this, a large part of the anime is more of a high school romantic comedy than a combat adventure.  It's a combination that is not really new in anime.  It's an entertaining anime for people interested in this type of anime.

As an adaptation of the manga, I'm not as happy.  The rest of this review is going to go into specifics about the manga and anime, so spoilers will be included.  The anime goes from the beginning of the manga to the Nova attack on the school.  That's a lot of content to put into 12 half-hour episodes.  Parts of the manga are told in a different way or skipped over entirely.  This happens a lot with other anime adaptations, so it's something that I expected, but what is annoying is some of the characters become inconsistent in the anime because of these changes.  An example of this is Chiffon Fairchild, the #1 third year and Student Council President.  If I remember the manga correctly, Chiffon Fairchild is introduced much sooner in the anime than she was in the manga.  Early in the anime she ends up playing a role that someone else played in the manga.  Because of this, she ends up observing Satellizer el Bridget's early conflicts and waiting for the faculty to end the conflicts, even cowering from Satellizer at one point after she spoke out against Satellizer's actions.  When she plays the same role she plays in the manga in a later conflict when Satellizer is facing stronger opponents, Chiffon ends the conflict with one blow that no one can see.  There is no explanation as to why Chiffon treats these conflicts differently.  I'm sure this won't matter to everyone, but it irritated me a bit and I figured I wouldn't be the only one.  Also, the ending of the anime, the ending of the Nova attack, is very different from the manga.  It's different in a way that is difficult to believe based on what is revealed about some characters later in the manga.",1346198400,,2074,4.512064343163539
5771697,4,B00D39UQ2W,"I really liked the story here, however I had several problems with the series' English dub version. I like the Japanese feel of anime, so I belive the titles 'Senpai' and 'khai' should have been used. It actually hurt the story not to use them, in my opinion. In addition to the series there are 6 OVA episodes, which I got really excited about... until I watched them. They are about 2-3 mins each of pure fan service. Unless you really liked the last episode of Dragonaut Resonance, Don't bother with them. this series was like a take on Tsukiumi from Sekire. In fact Satalizer is her spiting image.. Still it was a very enjoyable show to watch with plenty of good comedy and some serious moments mixed in. Very violent, so get prepared for that, and as I said tons and tons of right - to - the - edge fan service. In fact I belive that is the main running theme  of the whole series. Still I loved the show..... and  the  fan  service.... ;-P",1346198400,,945,4.322033898305085
5771698,5,B00D39UQ2W,"Truly wonderful, once again Funimation shines. Great story, with beginning, climax (no pun intended), and an end; even if it is just a small chapter of a larger story, it doesn't leave you hanging like so many others. The characters are memorable and the English voice actors are amazing--as has become expected. Even the OVAs are dubbed--try getting that from watchama-Blasters. Until finally seeing the dubbed release, I only knew of the characters from posters, shirts, figures, etc. To see them in action was a real treat! Understand this: this anime is rather risqu, and definitely not for young audiences. I'm ever so grateful to Funimation for giving this a ""voice"" I could understand. It has yet to be determined if it will be one I could watch every month, like H.O.T.D or Spice and Wolf, but I think it may. I will enjoy this as much the next time I watch it--of that I'm sure. Cloths tearing Ikki Tousen style, My-Hime type manifestation of weaponry, inter-dimensional enemies, plus the voices of Jamie Marchi, Caitlin Glass, Leah Clark, (and the rest of the gang.) It's a no lose proposition--buy this anime--you want this anime (you know you do.)",1345075200,5,1159,4.858585858585859
5771699,5,B00D39UQ2W,"The show 'Freezing' is your typical science fiction anime with a splash of harem thrown in. The story is basically this: humanity is at war with extra-dimensional beings called NOVA. The world has no way of fighting them except with teenage girls (naturally). It focuses on Aoi Kazuya who transfers to a school called West Genetics Academy. Genetics Academy is basically a school for genetically enhanced girls called Pandoras & male students with an ability dubbed ""Freezing"" which can limit/restrict movement in the area they cast it on. Pandoras & their male partners, who are called ""Limiters"", are the only known way to combat the NOVA.

The story starts out with Aoi being shown around his new school during an annual event that consists of each & every Pandora (in their year) going at war with each other (almost killing each other) throughout the entire school. The main heroine, Satellizer (who is known as the Untouchable Queen & ranked 1 of her entire class), & another main girl crash lands in front of Aoi. That is when the main story kicks in.

There's a lot of blood, limbs being cut off, fights & nudity. So, it's not for kids. It has a good story. The opening & ending are good. The insert music is freaking great. There's not really much I can say negative about this anime. There's a decent amount of sexual references. There's pantie shots but they aren't as in your face like in Queen's Blade or Sekirei (Sekirei still being good). All in all...I would suggest watching online before the box set comes out in order to make sure you want to buy it. You can watch it on YouTube censored by FUNimation.",1337817600,85,1621,4.664335664335664

5771701,2,B00D39UQ2W,"Here is my 3/10 mangaupdates review for the originating manga and i pretty much saw the anime (the animation is a no budget mess of course) as this adapts vol 1-6: I stopped reading this mess after 5 (?) volumes but it is now reached 20, has 4 spin-offs and an official hentai companion series. I would like to point out that it focuses on rape which the main series misuses to high heaven too. What else is there too say besides that this is a mixture between a bad harem school life manga, a messy shonen action manga, a fetish porno with an art style that employs less variety of characters than i have fingers and is a waste of everybody's time due to an incomprehensible plot just like the rest of Dall-Young works. Don't even start or you will regret it. Go for the utterly incomparable Azumi (9/10) and Claymore (8,5/10) if you want to read a series about female warriors with a real edge. Or pick up real porn that isn't by him.",1436745600,2,936,4.323863636363637

5771717,4,B00D39UQ2W,"Freezing is shockingly dark and brutal.  Know that going in.  These characters will be beaten, battered and bloodied on a regular basis, and sometimes they might even lose limbs. There is humor, and there are light moments, but at its core, Freezing is a brutal battle series.

The core of the show, and the main character arc during this season, is Satellizer.  She begins the series as a cold, distant girl who refuses to let anyone touch her, hence the nickname The Untouchable Queen. She is also a Pandora, a female soldier that uses the power of her stigmata (little metal pieces imbedded in her skin) to fight the Nova, a mysterious race of aliens that have been attacking earth.  As the show progresses, and Satellizer begins to open up to those around her, her insecurities are revealed, and her past shows exactly why she has closed herself off.  I was surprised at how much thought was put into the actual characterization of Satellizer, and how the little scenes, like her trying to chose a dress to wear to prom, help create an interesting and sympathetic heroine.  The rest of the cast is enjoyable, although rarely do any of them get the level of exploration that Satellizer does.

The animation is pretty good, although some of the middle episodes suffer from some characters going off model, or limited animation in the battle scenes.  The art is nice, with solid, distinctive character designs for the very large female cast.  The male characters tend to be non-descript and hard to tell apart, though.  Considering there are only two regular male cast members, this doesn't pose much of a problem.

Sound wise, the show sports some okay music, although one or two tracks are weak.  I watched the show dubbed, and I enjoyed it.  This isn't a show that will blow you away, but each voice actor gives their character enough flare to make them recognizable and distinct, and it is obvious that a few of the VA's truly had a blast with their more over the top characters.

Here is where I will address the one major issue I had with this show.  The fan service.  There is a lot of nudity in Freezing.  I mean, a lot.  This is the type of show where every battle results in tons of ripped clothing.  Now, if you have ever read any of my past reviews, I usually have no problem with fan service.  One of my favorite shows is High School DxD (which shares several key crew members with Freezing).  The issue I have with the fan service in this show is that it is just kind of there. It serves no purpose. It usually occurs when the characters are bloodied and battered (and in a few instances, screaming about their limbs being severed), and could hardly be described as sexy.  Outside of one throw away episode towards the end of the season the nudity serves no real purpose, and actually becomes a distraction to the serious tone that the show is trying to create.  Also, Freezing deals with some pretty dark themes, including a character dealing with past, childhood sexual abuse, which makes the near constant exploitation aspects feel that much dirtier.

Freezing is a solid show.  Heck, it's a good show, and I enjoyed it a great deal.  There are some issues, specifically the unneeded fan service and some not too great animation, that keep the show from being a truly stellar series, and Freezing has the potential to be a truly stellar series.  Heres hoping that season two (Freezing Vibration) finds a better balance between its more serious storytelling, and its need for exposed boobs.",1417564800,,3507,4.658536585365853
5771718,5,B00D39UQ2W,"I love this series, I watched season 2 and it's not as good as season 1, and that's probably why North America doesn't have it. Season 1 is the best, and would recommend it for older teens and adults to watch.",1417305600,,209,4.121951219512195

5771722,5,B00D39UQ2W,"Okay, so I rated this 5 stars because it does have a very interesting main story, and I hope that they continue making more seasons but I doubt they will. I think that it would be more well received if nearly every episode did not have some serious amount of sexual assault (and the ones that do not feature full on rape/incest) That being said, the show makes zero sense at all for the following reasons:

1. Limiters are worthless. Their only use is to cancel the Nova's freezing effect, but pretty much all of the Pandora who actually do anything (and there aren't that many) can use Pandora Mode which makes them immune to freezing fields.

2. Pandora are worthless. Seriously, the ratio of Pandora who are actually worth having in a fight to those who just die is ridiculous. During the battle outside West Genetics, Elize and Soo-mi kill 75% of the Nova themselves while everyone else just dies. During the indoor battle the only people who actually accomplish anything are Chiffon, Elizabeth, and Satellizer. The rest are worthless. During the second season, the only Pandora who actually does anything is Chiffon. The rest just die or stand around crying about how life is unfair.

3. Satellizer is worthless in the first season, with the exception of the first two and last episodes. The author is really all over the place with her power/importance. In the first two episodes they introduce her as super powerful and everyone is amazed at her abilities, and then she spends the rest of the season getting her ass kicked by everyone she comes across (she really does not legitimately win a fight on her own from episode 3 unit the end of episode 12.)

4. Satellizer is worthless in season 2. They could have left her out of season 2 entirely and it would have been just fine with only a few minor changes and then they would not have had those two very awkward (not to mention horrifying) episodes (6 and 7) of her getting raped by her brother and no one caring.

5. Nobody actually cares that Satellizer's brother is a rapist and torturer. Seriously, her mother, father and stepmother all do not care in the slightest that he rapes her (in episode1-7 her mother tells her to deal with it and her stepmother encourages Luis), and when her sister finds out all she does is send Satellizer away (better than nothing I guess). Then a few years later when Satellizer visits her she is all ""Hey, you know our brother that likes to rape and torture you? Well he is right here, but I bet he is over it so I will put no effort into making sure you are not alone with him or otherwise prevent him from raping you some more."" And when Kazuya finds out he barely shows any emotion at all. He is all ""Oh, your brother rapes and tortures you? That sucks. Just kick the crap out this other girl that he likes to rape, then save both their lives and leave your brother with the other girl he likes to rape and then we will go back to the others and not do anything at all for the next five episodes."" Everyone in Satellizer's life is a horrible person.

6. They are all over the place with who is powerful and who is not. At first they act like Satellizer is super powerful, then she isn't, then in the last episode of the first season she defeats Cathy (who at the time is treated as the most powerful Pandora). Then in Season 2 all she does is get her ass kicked by everyone she fights. In episode 1-9 everyone acts like Cathy is the freaking Second Coming and says that with her power they thought she would lead the Chevalier. Then in season 2 she is now only the fifth most powerful student (note student, not out of all Pandora) in the world. Why doesn't anyone care about any of those more powerful than her, like Chiffon who is ignored for most of the series until the last three episodes of season 2 where she is revealed to effectively be a goddess (but with no in-series explanation as to why)?",1414454400,,3899,4.430962343096234

The art was good, action sequences were extremely well done, the only knock on this series is that there was only 12 episodes.",1409616000,,418,4.346153846153846
5771727,4,B00D39UQ2W,"While by no means porn graphic (in the literal sense) Freezing is geared to get a certain reaction from its viewers.  It's more than that however.  It goes without saying that Freezing is by no means a kid show. It's made for adults and should only be seen by adults. That being said, it was better than I could have imagined.  It's more than big bouncing boobs that can't stay put away, or awkward situations; it's a dramatic story packed with action and content that connects you to the characters.  By the end of the series you will care about what has been happening to the Characters.  It explores the loss of innocence,  faith, and the bleak reality of people who feel alone.  Its violent and nudity isn't always there just to be there and it largely exists to tell the story.  It isn't for everyone and some may even call it sexist, but the show is much more than it appears.

The OVA'S are a different matter. They are funny and definitely meant for men (or women) who only want to see erotic content and explicit content.  Can a freezing field generate a group Orgasm when used by the right man? You bet it can.  And the only way to escape it is to strip your good friend naked and use her to distract the guy.",1408924800,2,1219,4.325991189427313

5771731,3,B00D39UQ2W,"I've been a fan of anime since the 90's, maybe it's the age, maybe its so many repetitive ideas done over and over again... but I have been looking for some decent adult themed anime... this is NOT it.
As an older guy I'll go right to the point.
I am well aware some of my gripes may look to be about japanese culture I believe it is more about how is it portrayed and how repetitive it has been the last 20 years.

Animation: Average at best
Japanese voices: Same old hight pitched screaming voices
English voices: Same generic ones, adults trying to pass as teenagers
Story: Some vague stuff resembling evangelion, ikkitousen, saint seiya, dragon ball z, etc

Now my main complains... CLICHES !
(Don't get me wrong I love anime chics with impossible slender figures and impossibly big firm breasts but...)
1) Women falling chest first into the protagonist, most of the time topless? (I was a high-schooler and went to college, Never happened!)
2) Protagonist or main girls going almost catatonic because they were seen nude (or the contrary fighting nude in mid street like it's nobodies business)
3) Pre-teen and teen saviors of the world (japanese really love this as ridiculous as it seems)
4) Everybody loves to presents themselves by name, grade, nickname and specialty for some reason
5) Like saint seiya, dragon ball z or captain tsubasa the girl protagonist is all powerful, she just keeps on overpowering everyone out of sheer will power o script power killing any drama or relevance of all the rest of the staff during fights. She could have taken everyone in a fight provided she bit the dust enough times.
6) Female bodies absolutely inconsistent with 7-8-9th graders
7) Personalities absolutely not on par with the portrayed ages
8) Painfully absurd clothing totally inconsistent with fighting (and perhaps made of toilet paper as it tores apart with anything north of a sneeze)
9) Storyline is just a stub to showcase girls, fights and nudity ( and even if I love all of them combined in anime it's quite stale and over done by now)

Etc... I could go on forever.

As an adult I would recommend you not to buy it not even rent it, but if you have to, just watch the last 3 episodes all the action and ""story"" you need to know about is contained in the end.",1407456000,3,2272,4.616336633663367

The animation, characters, story and English dub are awesome making this series one of my favorite animes!

Be warned that the series is not suitable for children due to all the fan service and if you're unfamiliar with the term then let me explain. Fan service means there are a lot of large jiggling breasts, revealing clothing, panty exposing character animations, poses and camera angles as well as brief nudity and strongly suggestive themes.",1387929600,,920,4.961038961038961

The fight scenes all play out the same way, i.e. some random psychopathic thug tries to kill one of the two main characters for no apparent reason, then the main character comes back as if they were the underdog all along. It's the kind of scenario you've seen in every action anime ever, except here it's made worse by unwarranted violence and sadistic humiliation.

The story unfolds brillinatly and delivers enough to keep you watching and satisfied. Girls are the warriors while boys are the protectors with ""freezing capabilities"" which render an enemy unabl to move. The majority of the show is about the lives of those at the training academy; they compete, have mock battles, and tend to not get along.

5771776,5,B00D39UQ2W,"I am going to be honest here, I first started watching this back when it was only available in the original Japanese audio (Eng Sub) over the internet. Not knowing what to expect except for a endowed heroin and from what looked to be a nice art style I watched the first episode...then the second....the third; I was hooked. Yes it is an ""ecchi"" anime/manga, and that understandably is a turn off for some, but I have to say I really enjoyed the story in this one. Once I finished the series I went on to reading the manga and there is honestly something here aside from the panty flashes and bare chested moments. The fight scenes are excellent while not taking away from the chemistry between the characters...which they actually have in this show. Unlike a lot of the ""harem,"" clones that are out there today, this one actually attempts to pair characters with one another. All that aside when I heard about the English release I was worried that they wouldn't capture the characters voices correctly; luckily I was dead wrong. Satellizer sounds identical to her Japanese counter part as well as the rest of the cast for the most part. Normally I don't enjoy Dub as much but I actually found myself watching this one in full English Audio rather than Sub. They really went the extra mile to bring this already great series to the North American audience. This one is defiantly worth getting if you are into action and romance with a splash of fan service.",1367452800,,1458,4.590038314176245

  This is a good quality production but was not as light as I had expected. That said I enjoyed the story and the story arc. I could wish it were longer but it ended where it should. While there is 'fanservice' it is not done in-judiciously and fits within the story line. This was reminiscent of "" The Ghost In The Shell "" in feeling. This is not as complex or as long but the mood of it was similar with enough humor to keep it from being depressing. All in all a good balance.
  The only caveat I have is that there are few extras with it. I also wish it was less expensive, what else is new. I would recommend this to anyone who liked Ghost or Sorcerer Hunters.",1366848000,,765,4.141891891891892

5771780,5,B00D39UQ2W,"I'll review the price, physical content, and story.

Price: The price is definitely on the higher end, but nothing unreasonable for a fan. If you don't mind some blood and nude shots cut out, then watching online/renting is DEF the way to go (uncensored season not on youtube). otherwise, the amount censored out is minimal.
Bottom line - if you have any doubts spending near $60 for 1 season, rent it first.

Physical content: 4 discs (2 blu ray/2 dvd), 2 mini cases and a nice cardboard sleeve. No other material was included in mine. Be weary if you're expecting more (i.e. art book). The on disc extras are bountiful (OVA's, original commercials, commentaries)

Story
Audio: The soundtract on Freezing is one of the best, not much else to say. (Third to GitS & Deadman Wonderland IMO)

Visual: Artwork is great. There are VERY few parts where characters look unproportional, person in some weird stance, etc. The fps is def choppy (normal for animated shows) but the fight scenes pick up the slack and are epic! Lots of ecchi (TV-MA is mostly due to nudity, not blood/gore) but not oversaturated. Same with blood and gore, even less so IMO, but enough to be like ""DAMN, she just chopped that B&%@H in half!"" as this is directed to a more mature audience.

Voice overs: The cast in both Japanese and Eng did a great job...I couldn't decide which one was more pleasing to listen too. (it's hard to convert to anime after reading a manga and having the characters sound exactly how you envisioned while reading).

Plot: Actually reading the plot you can do anywhere else, so here will be my intepretation. It's a typical supernatural setting with a young male protagonist playing hero with female supporting protagonists. Lots of backstories for character development, and not so much unraveling the story. But I think this is intentional (being furthur into the story via manga, they have plenty of room to expand on the story later on). It's the perfect amount of mystery/action/character bonding to keep you reeled in and wondering ""I wonder what his intentions really are??"" for 1 season. The plot line is definitely mysterious, so for those who need explanations as the show progresses or will have a hard time waiting for the next season, this may be a tad distasteful. I'd say for 99% of you though, the action

Characters: Apart from the characters who play the obvious villan role, you grow some sort of attachment to everyone (wether it's their personality or sheer awesome battle skills). When I say everyone, it mostly means the more main characters. I noticed some characters seemed bland/too similar at fist, and was even getting them mixed up, but sorts itself out eventually. The main male char may be the only exception (and usually is the case, where they are too emotional/whiney/oblivious), though I find that he always seems to say/do something great right right when I'm losing interest in him.

Bottom Line - Plot, characters etc may seem confusing, but that is because the series is far from over. It was a good closure, and if you haven't read the manga, more roller-coaster plot lines, awesome characters and tear-jerking moments are coming!",1365552000,,3168,4.842883548983364
5771781,3,B00D39UQ2W,"The story has a great background, but I felt as thought it was suppressed. Freezing felt more like a drama to me than anything else.

In my case I agree with the editorial review that the story is minimal. Also, I did not care so much for the fan service, although it seemed that the series relied on it to keep the audiences' interest a bit. You do get a feel for the characters. But do too much with them, you can start to lose interest in them or become annoyed by them.

The level of drama mixed with the fan service makes this anime awkward to watch at some times.",1365292800,,569,4.117117117117117
5771782,5,B00D39UQ2W,"Some seriously intense fight scenes with many cute girls. Indeed though, with all the fighting between classmates in order to assert their ranking, you forget who the enemy is at times. Interestingly this is a reverse of a typical harem anime in which it's the girls who are collecting the boys called ""limiters"". Story line is good but seems to focus more on high school oriented social dilemmas and not enough on the enemy at hand, although it does so in the last few episodes. I loved this series and hope more continue. I recommend this to any anime fan. You will not be disappointed.",1363737600,,588,4.609523809523809
5771783,5,B00D39UQ2W,"It's basically super powered 90210'ers defending Earth from aliens called Nova. That being said it's a good series. The characters interact pretty well and the personality types are varianced enough to where they don't all seem to be alterations of 1 general mold. It's essentially a partner series where young men, known as Limiters, and women, known as Pandora's, work in tandem to protect humanity. The series revolves around the heroine, Satellizer el Bridget, and her de facto limiter/ partner, Kazuya Aoi. In the beginning Satellizer can't stand being touched and to that end trained to become strong enough to keep anyone from getting close. To this effect she gains the nickname of the Untouchable Queen. In classic fashion she gets knocked down from her position and begins to have to have to rely on Kazuya in her following battles.

Kazuya is the series' second focus. Brother to another Pandora who passed away before the series' start. He becomes a Limiter in order to do his part to protect the world as his sister did. In the first episode he ends up costing Satellizer her ""position"" in class, and then slowly starts to fall into the partner roll for her. The relationship between the two is awkward at times, and a bit painful, but given Satellizer's fear of being touched not only makes sense, but makes this series feel really unique amongst it's sub-genre.

In general it's a great series and if I were to have any gripe with it, it would be the lack of focus on the Nova. You don't get to really experience the gravity of the threat, and it's extremely limited to the end of the series only. But the focus elsewhere is actually very entertaining and the battles are very well done. But do keep in mind that this series is NOT FAN SERVICE. Fan Service alludes to insinuating sexuality, while still being clothed or at least covered. This goes right out the window episode one, and gets flushed down the drain by 2. If you have a problem with nudity, in pretty much every episode and OVA, you may want to pass on this one. Definitely not for younger kids or people who have a problem with some younger characters insinuating how they perform Baptism. If you watch the series you'll understand.

All considered, it's a great series, just not for children.",1363392000,,2273,4.706030150753769

5771789,5,B00D39UQ2W,"If you like Anime like Rosario or Sekirei, you'll really enjoy this.  Basically we have a high school that trains female students in martial arts aided by embedded devices called ""stigmata"" - it's never really explained exactly these are. They are assisted by their male students who they bond with by having sex - you never see that, but it's obvious. They call it a ""christening."" The place is run by a combination of the military and the church.  Pretty bizarre, considering all these chicks want to do is fight each other, have sex and show boob.  The goal of all the fights - get your opponent naked and do as much physical damage as possible.  The girls are almost immortal - they heal fast, and if the damage is too extreme, the medical facilities can reattach limbs and regrow stuff that was cut off. They are being trained to battle alien invaders that look like a cross between the old Macross ship and the statue of Liberty. All in all it's pretty strange, but the fighting is pretty darn good, the voices are great, animation near perfect, and overall it's a great series.

My only complaint is the lack of more episodes!  There is supposed to be a prequel series in the works.  This ending does wrap up things nicely - but also creates a lot of new questions, obviously leaving the opening for more episodes.

The extras are a few 3 minute shorts with even more busty break-outs - actually laugh-out-loud in some places.

5771793,5,B00D39UQ2W,"This anime is one of the best I've seen in a couple years. The action sequences and the story were flawless. I know this says ""the complete series"", but the ending leaves you wanting more FREEZING. The rivalry's in this anime were intense.

5771796,5,B00D39UQ2W,"Freezing is by far one of the best of the Asian Anime.  The main character is one Satellizer L. Bridgette who is a Pandora.  A very beautiful Pandora that is genetically modified to fight an interdemensional beings know as the Nova.  To do this Bridgette goes to a special school called West Genetics to train with other girls and boys (Limiters).  Satellizer s a bit of a loner in fact she hates to be touched ad this makes for some very interesting fights.  Freezing is by far the best of the Ecchie, Romance, Harem anime that I have seen.  If beautiful women fighting is our cup of tea then this is your blend.",1355875200,,613,4.380530973451328
5771797,4,B00D39UQ2W,"This is a story about aliens from another dimension invading Earth and the people being trained to defend us. There will be one or two spoilers in this review so look away if you would rather avoid some of them.

Pros: Really good albeit brief story, amazing visuals, pretty good dubbed voice acting, great prices for the DVD/Blu-Ray combo, lots of extras.
Cons: Lots of T&A for no really good reason, series is a little short, lots of inconsistent and confusing bio's for the characters.

I will first start out with the bio's for most of the characters, they are all listed as being 17 years old when it is states on more than one ocassion that they are younger students or older students. I think the confusion in the bios is the primary reason for the gratuitous T&A. If the girls get attacked/wounded in battle, supposedly their very brief uniforms which form on their bodies when they use their powers (why they could not form some pants is beyond me) is also armor although I cannot see how. Any attack means first the portion covering breasts goes away so lots of topless girls running around is what you see during any fight. I am not against T&A in my media, and they at least did work it out in the mechanic of the fighting to show it instead of it being for no reason, but really, you mean to tell me they could not show wounds or battle damage any other way aside form stripping the girls of their clothes?

Another thing about this series that I found odd is that all the female characters are supposedly fighting on the same side against the common enemy and yet they seem to be hell bent on killing each other more so than training seriously to fight the enemy. I am not upset by this like I am about the T&A since the training and in-fighting amongst themselves is right up my alley with senseless violence in cartoons of this nature, it is just a little disturbing as they often times go right up to and sometimes killing each other for sport. I would not recomend letting your kids watch this unless you are the type of parent who will watch it with them and explain to them why the things on the screen are happening so they can understand and not try to imitate this in real life.

Overall, I got the show because of the story and the story really does shine, albeit a rather cliche genre of training the kids to save the world.",1355616000,,2349,4.3807339449541285
5771798,4,B00D39UQ2W,This is not for kids and even though the main story is the fighting the sub stories is what makes this show come together,1355616000,,121,4.083333333333333
5771799,5,B00D39UQ2W,"I have always loved ""Freezing"" the manga and this is as close as they could get although a few parts were changed like the beauty pageant, and the ending was made up to finish the series, otherwise its pretty accurate.  The story is as follow Dimensional Beings called ""NOVA"" invade Earth and the only way to stop them is a group of female warriors called ""Pandora"".  Granted super powers and weapons by inserting NOVA tissue into their bodies The males are called limiters and have the ability to create stasis fields aka: Freezing effect.

Aoi Kazuya Is the grandson of the man who invented the Pandoras and enters the military academy as a limiter.  He mistakes a Pandora named Satelizier el Bridgett for his long dead sister who was also a Pandora who died a hero in the last clash.  After a few arguments they become partners and share many trials together.",1355270400,,862,4.644736842105263
5771800,5,B00D39UQ2W,"from the intro songs 'til the ending cerdits this show is amazing!  The writer of this anime is a well known figure and it shows.  perfect blend of action, drama, comedy, and romance.  there is never a dull moment in this series.  SUPER A++!",1354665600,,241,4.409090909090909
5771801,2,B00D39UQ2W,"This is an average story and plot at best.  The animation is alright, but again it is also not aiming to achieve anything beyond an average mark.  To be honest this series is an average one, through and through, really I'd give it 2.5 stars but since that isn't available I will round down as I feel it deserves a lower score than a higher one.  This show never attempts to be more than average on almost any level, the only place it really DOES try to do something is the ""harem"" comedy area as it delivers here strongly the most--including the play on sex and the complete lack-of-it at all, but VERY much suggested in this series.

But, if you are looking for some good action sequences with good looking girls with that ""harem"" anime feel, you just may like this series.  It is of course a short series though.  Unless you are an absolute fan of the ""harem"" genre of anime or really are dying to see an anime at all that can deliver some action sequences with flash--this is the only reason to me to buy it.  Otherwise, I actually would give this anime series a pass as there are far better series to use your money on.  Consider this a pragmatic review...",1354492800,3,1160,4.337962962962963
5771802,4,B00D39UQ2W,"In 2007, a Japanese-Korean manga series known as ""Freezing"" was created by Dall-Young Lim and illustrations by Kwang-Hyun Kim.  Lim who is best known for creating the manga ""Black God"" had written well-known manhwa (Korean comics) and in 2007, Lim's latest manga ""Freezing"" would be serialized in ""Comic Valkyrie"".

With several volumes collected in manga format, ""Freezing"" would receive an anime adaptation courtesy of  A.C.G.T. and was directed by Takashi Watanabe (""Battle Skipper"", ""Casshan: Robot Hunter Casshern"", ""Battle Royal High School""), screenplay by Masanao Akahoshi (""The Big O"", ""Duel Masters"", ""Demon King Daimao"", ""Zone of the Enders""), music by Masaru Yokoyama (""Queen's Blade"" series, ""Arakawa Under the Bridge""), character design by Mayumi Watanabe (""Koihime"", ""Happy Lesson"", ""Kimagure Orange Road"") and art director by Satoru Kuwabara (""Angelium"", ""Burn Up W"", ""JoJo's Bizarre Adventure"").

VIDEO:

""Freezing"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:78:1 aspect ratio).  As an upconvert, the series picture quality is good. It's not a series that prides itself on beautiful artistic backgrounds and if anything, knowing its demographic is watching it for the fan service, a lot of focus goes into the closeups and showcasing a woman's assets or numerous panty shots.  As expected for a TV series, the anime series does lean towards a more soft look but overall, because the series focuses more on character close-ups and action, this is not one of those series that is meant to make people feel in awe for its visual presence but more on its action and of course, T&A.

AUDIO:

""Freezing"" is presented in English DolbyTrue HD 5.1 and Japanese Dolby TrueHD 2.0.  While the Japanese lossless soundtrack is good via stereo and is well-acted, for its dynamic range, the English dub version is much better due to its use of the surround channels and the acting is also very well done.  But whichever version you choose, acting is well-done on both Japanese and English soundtracks but during those action scenes (and there are many), the English lossless track is better for its utilization of a 5.1 lossless, where the Japanese version is primarily front channel driven.

Subtitles are in English.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Freezing: Complete Series"" comes with the following special features:

  Episode 6 Audio Commentary - Featuring audio commentary by Josh Grelle (voice of Kazuya) and Jamie Marchi (voice of Rana).
  Episode 11 Commentary  - Featuring audio commentary by Caitlin Glass (Satellizer) and Luci Christian (voice of Ganessa).
  OVA episodes - (18:11) Featuring six short OVA's that focus more on the perverted fan service.
  U.S. Trailer - (1:02) FUNimation trailer.
  Promotional Videos - (5:07) The Japanese promotional video for ""Freezing"".
  Original Commercials - (1:18) The original Japanese commercials for ""Freezing"".
  Textless Opening and Ending Themes

EXTRAS:

""Freezing: Complete Series"" comes with the entire series on both Blu-ray and DVD.

JUDGMENT CALL:

When it comes to fan service anime featuring women with big breasts and panty shots galore, there are plenty of them.  From ""Gravion"", ""Tenjo Tenge"" to ""Sekirei"", suffice to say, T&A anime are common in Japan and despite being targeted to a certain demographic, while often at times, these type of anime series can be kitsch, sometimes you are surprised when one features an in-depth storyline.

""Freezing"" has the banality of action/fighting series such as ""Tenjo Tenge"" and ""Sekirei"", ""Freezing"" play the underdog card by showcasing a protagonist named Kazuya Aoi who is weak but kindhearted and you eventually find out that he has a rare special ability.  Then you add in Satellizer el Bridget, your buxom blonde who is cold and deadly but also a woman who has kept herself distant because of her aphephobia of years of being sexually abused by her step-brother.

Aside from its fan service, you really want to root for both Satellizer and Kazuya because they are literally the underdogs, the outcasts and are constantly picked on.  But the bullies will quickly learn that these two are powerful when they are together.  You know these two need each other and feel good being with each other but both are also shy and not sure how to interpret their emotions.

Also, unlike other series where nudity will make a group of perverted guys having blood shooting from their noses when they nudity, ""Freezing"" is different by the fact that often in battle, women are seen naked and it's like nudity is not much of a big thing.  Yes, Kazuya is your typical cherry boy who questions Satellizer's choice of skimpy clothing at times but other than that, you don't hear many guys going crazy about boobs but more excited about seeing the best Pandora's in competition.  So, it's a bit fascinating in that aspect, as those reactions separate ""Freezing"" from other similar anime series that play upon the show's perverseness.

And for those who want more titillating, perverted storylines, that is where the short OVA's come along.  These are more perverse than the actual main story and are simply short stories created visually for the horny otaku.

While the Blu-ray presentation is good for an upconvert and soft as one would expect from a TV series, voice acting is well-done on both Japanese and English lossless soundtracks but of course, the English version is much better due to its 5.1 lossless track as opposed to the Japanese 2.0 track.  Aside from the six short OVA's, you also get two audio commentary.  And what I liked about this audio commentary is that instead of the moderator asking questions about one's involvement in the series, the talent are answering questions written down and getting into conversations about voice actors taking part in a fan service anime series to anime con experiences.  So, if you are fan of the main English voice dub talent in this series, you will enjoy the two audio commentaries.

Overall, ""Freezing"" was an entertaining sci-fi series with a lot of action and fan service.  But instead of being banal in storyline, it takes a different approach of showcasing a protagonist who has had a traumatic past.  So, aside from all the T&A that is seen in this series, there is actually a fascinating plot that continues to build until the final episode.

So, if you are looking for an anime series with a lot of action and big boobs and panty shots galore, ""Freezing: Complete Series"" is definitely for you!",1354320000,,6447,5.09047619047619
5771803,5,B00D39UQ2W,I just finished watching this and would love for more of this show to come out in English. I Love this series and hope they come out with more.,1354233600,,143,3.9655172413793105
5771804,4,B00D39UQ2W,"Many of the reviewers seem to have missed the story. Throughout both the Anime and the Manga, clashes with the Nova are peripheral to the character story. The story of Freezing is really the redemption of Satellizer el Bridget - a girl who was brutally abused as a child and became a Pandora to escape her family. Kazuya, while being the kind of wimpy boy Anime of this type employ, nonetheless has a strength of spirit and compassion capable of drawing the ""Untouchable Queen"" out of her psychological hell.

This story is hidden in a backdrop of Anime/Manga staples, like giant, robotic aliens and anatomically absurd fan service (The ""Pandora Queen"" episode can be skipped entirely without missing a beat in the story), but gives a the series a depth that similar series like Sekirei lack.",1354147200,,792,4.823529411764706
5771805,4,B00D39UQ2W,"In the mid 2000's the Earth has been invaded by aliens called the Nova. Kazuya Aoi is the little brother of a war hero. His sister died fighting for the hopes and dreams of every person on Earth. Kazuya enters a school that trains young women and men to fight the Nova. He meets a girl named Satellizer el Bridgette. She has the same stigmata mark on her back as Kazuya's late sister. Underneath her cool exterior lies a gentle and shy side that she will only show to Kazuya. The 2 of them become partners and continue to fight to save the future.

This anime has a very generic story line. A boy meets a girl and they fight to save the world. The Nova are similar the to the Dolems in RahXephon, so there pretty cool looking. This series reminds me a lot of the Sekirei anime. Personally I liked Sekirei better. This anime also has a lot of fighting and nudity. So it's not for younger viewers. It is a very serious story. There is very little comedy if any at all. The animation, soundtrack and voice acting are all very well done. Overall this series is a good watch. It's got great production quality and a fairly solid story with some great characters. My only complaint is that it's only 12 episodes. I think many shows could be better if they took more time to develop the characters.
I enjoyed Freezing very much, and I hope you do to.",1351468800,10,1343,4.308300395256917
5771806,4,B00D39UQ2W,"I love this series, however.... I wish it had a season two. When I watch the OVAs I thought it was gonna take place after the series with showing what life is like when the characters are not fighting into war with big giant aliens.... but instead it had too many comedy moments.... plus the OVAs didn't even last long.

I do like it when this series had a fictional fast food restaurant called ""Burger Queen"", lol..... to me it really couldn't compete with Burger King.

I would say this show is over rated with lots of nudity and blood gore.",1349308800,2,543,4.366336633663367
5771807,4,B00D39UQ2W,"Upskirt panty shots; and young guys who aren't ""butt-monkey,"" ""punching bags for femdom's sake"" material. That's all I'm asking for. Unfortunately, the anime industry won't listen to people like me. Nor the potential wallets they could sap money from if they tried harder.

Then there's Freezing; a fan-servicy, alien-fighting show with an otherwise gruesome and 'more bitter than sweet"" story to tell. The people behind this show didn't harm the young guys herein as badly as the lot of other anime out there do. (And they basically did it for the lulz of the otaku-base.)

My thanks go out to FUNimation's English-dubbing crew who went and gave it a fresh coat of audio paint. I was hoping that Caitlin Glass would use her ""British accent"" like she always does with Cammy White from the current Street Fighter series. And I'd also like to applaud Josh Grelle for being Kazuya. (I liked him as Ren from ""Kaze no Stigma"" / ""Stiggaz Wind Attitude."")

I was kinda shocked to find Cherami Leigh masquerading as ""Ceelee Rose"" when she was dubbing Chiffon, one of the more prolific sub-characters of the series. Cherami's the leading voice actress for Strike Witches' Yoshika Miyafuji. And Freezing's basically Strike Witches with more blood and gore.",1349222400,,1246,4.980769230769231

5771809,3,B00D39UQ2W,I actually expected more from this for some reason. The fact that it was rated TV MA maybe? Which by the way is largely due to it showing fully drawn breasts.
