Superb acting from Adam Scott particularly, great music, the film is a reminder of that period of time between adolescence and adulthood, very close to my own experience and I absolutely loved it, I watched it over and over. It totally brought me back, and I wish I had been as brave as some of the characters in the film, confronting the issues of that age. I cannot understand how it didn't get a proper release. It would be great to see a sequel and you cannot help wondering what became of these characters. I completely recommend it; it's a keeper. deserves to be a cult classic.",1456704000,,591,4.431192660550459

I ran into it by chance on IFC at my cousins house in the  bay area and was only able to listen to it at low volume but even then it was great. The Emotions that the characters reach in this film are realistic and never over the top. Each character is believable and we can all relate to at least one and see us as one of them. The last 45 min of this movie are amazing. The bar scenes are amazing and this is movie is just comfortable to watch. I have run into some of my friends from high school and the attitudes towards them does change a little, one is a little bit held back, wondering if they are still the same, That is what all the characters in this movies are like too. Every character is at ease with everyone but they seen to fear the changes that have come between them. The original music is amazing, I would recommend getting on iTunes and listen to Anabret, the music is the same type of music that you would hear in this film. since you won't be able to find the soundtrack to this movie (something I would like very much to happen) This is a good late night movie and one of the best movies you can buy online, Just good luck trying to find it in stores.",1184371200,6,1218,4.033057851239669
8075717,4,B000A7DVQS,"I have watched this film several times now on IFC, and I have decided
that I like it. At first, I was put off by the 20-something characters'
self-absorption and unwillingness to let go of the past. Then, I
realized, these are the sorts of things I don't like in myself either,
but I'm really an okay guy. Actually, the film is pretty hopeful. Tim
is a really sweet character, Ellie really DOES grow in the course of
the film, and Peter and Sid probably have as good a chance as any
couple of making a go of it, in spite of Sid's neediness. Nobody is a
villain, and nobody is saint--kind of like in real life. The ensemble
cast is terrific, and I look forward to seeing the actors in other
roles. And I LOVE those quilts!",1145145600,4,721,4.231884057971015
8075718,5,B000A7DVQS,"I loved this movie.  A fully realized first feature from an uncommonly good first time director.  Shot beautifully, this ensemble piece about a group of college friends who get together for what appears to be a reunion weekend shines with intricately drawn characters and benefits from great performances across the board, particularly Tina Holmes. Some great original songs also highlight this funny, smart and poignant film.  Its a mystery why a movie this good didn't get a proper theatrical release.",1127779200,13,503,5.2625
