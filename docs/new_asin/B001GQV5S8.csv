8306748,5,B001GQV5S8,"This is a great documentary about the history of Russia. Some of the footage shown here, while old, covers views and locations you won't see anywhere else. Of course, this was made in the 60s, and reviewed by the U.S.S.R during and after production, so care is taken to enshrine the Soviet Union and Communism. I don't feel that there is a need to deduct stars for this, because it's just the nature of the documentary, which is in itself historical.

Given the events unfolding now, in early 2017, this documentary may prove useful. Learning what shaped Russia up til now leads to a greater understanding of the people we seem doomed to oppose.",1483574400,,645,4.657894736842105
