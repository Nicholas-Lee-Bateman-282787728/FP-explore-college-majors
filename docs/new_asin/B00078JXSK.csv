8045881,4,B00078JXSK,I have reviewed several A2Z products and I stand by my admiration for the product.  I am a student and these are very convenient.  My professor of advertising owns the bundle pack and he loves it.  Resellers prices are definately worth it.,1168560000,2,239,4.642857142857143
8045882,5,B00078JXSK,"Post 9/11 people have given a good deal of thought to the firefighters in New York - as well they should. These guys put their lives on the line for a minimum amount of reward simply to help the rest of us out.

This DVD brings that point  home by showing us vintage clips from the 1920s and 1930s (in silent and black and white) showing firemen (they were all men then) knocking down fires with the most primitive equipment I've ever seen.

It's very dramatic and the director catches flames well.",1146528000,3,498,4.391304347826087
