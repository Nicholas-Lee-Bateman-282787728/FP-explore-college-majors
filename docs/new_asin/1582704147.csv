196673,5,1582704147,It was a great reminder that how you view things forms your life. I highly recommend watching this film when times are good and not do good. Definitely a watch again and again film.,1363737600,,181,4.352941176470588
196674,5,1582704147,I thought it brought up some questions and made me think a lot. Can we shape our reality by choosing what to focus on? Maybe not totally but at least some of our experience. Remise is basically we get what we basically expect. Well done.,1362009600,,237,4.288888888888889
196675,4,1582704147,"I enjoyed this video, it gave me somethings to think about. It has a good story as the foundation of the lesson, and the ideas, while not new, were presented in a new way with new examples. Its easy to see the low production quality of the green screens, but I could look past that and get the meaning behind the story. I would recommend this video, I have already watched it 3 times.",1356566400,7,384,4.202702702702703

196677,5,1582704147,People vs the State of Illusion is a transformational movie! The movie gives great examples and expert views of how you can use your imagination to change the quality of your life. I have watched the movie 3 times in the theater and I am excited that it is now out one DVD. Watch this movie with the intention that you will get something out of it and you will! I walked away with new ways of seeing the world after watching this movie! I give it my highest rating.,1351728000,34,465,4.177777777777778
196678,5,1582704147,"I was at the premiere of this movie and was able to talk to several of the actors and the writer.  This movie is well written, directed, and acted.  It has some very heavy hitters that act as witnesses to the fundamental question of ""why do we see things the way we do?"" The expert witnesses in the movie will challenge you to ask that question over and over.  The movie follows the main character who makes a tragic mistake and shows the different ways this person could react.  A great movie.  This movie is better than ""The Secret"" because it provides concrete and believable actions you could do to positively affect your situation.",1350086400,32,636,4.543859649122807
196679,5,1582704147,"This film is unlike most films in theaters today, it makes you think.

This film is definitely one that you can watch more then once. Well done!",1349049600,,284,4.377358490566038
196680,5,1582704147,I watched this film for the first time when it was showing in Scottsdale. The next day I took my entire family back to view it. I found it better the second time as their was so much information in it. I learn or pick up something new each time. It has changed my life. Thank you Austin for your efforts and ambition. I recommend it to everyone. Oh and thank you for the extended bonus footage of all of the experts in the film. That is a goldmine.,1348790400,20,448,4.044943820224719
196681,5,1582704147,Good video with story line showing why and how we mistakenly are taught and live thinking we are separate from each other and God.,1437350400,,130,4.458333333333333
196682,5,1582704147,"I thought the movie is thought provoking.  The material was very ""down to earth"" and easy to understand, but  every time you watch this film, something else stands out. Great way to present spiritual information!",1429488000,,212,5.0285714285714285

196686,4,1582704147,"This unusual film starts out with a lawyer talking about a real case; a man who went to prison.  But this isn't a movie about lawyers and cases, nor about our justice system, nor our correctional system.  It's a philosophical and spiritual story; a story about making something better out of our lives; about how calamity sometimes is exactly what we needed; about taking the focus off yourself and putting it onto other people.  In short it's a story of spiritual growth and has been told a thousand times, but usually not starting with a nitty-gritty mess of a life.  I found it quite worth watching.",1426809600,,602,4.650943396226415

196694,5,1582704147,"Austin Vickers has created an incredibly inspirational and thought provoking film.  I have watched this fast moving docu-movie more than once and have recommended it to my friends and colleagues!  Be prepared to have your deepest presuppositions challenged and your most cherished beliefs shaken, if not overturned.  The film provides fresh insights while challenging ideologies that have been passed down from generation to generation that has diverted people from the natural course of their lives.  Most individuals have the opinion that it is the ""other person"" that causes the challenges we experience because we fail to realize it is our own need that is controlling us.  So we go on repeating the same pattern after pattern from one relationship to the next.  The main character in the film finally ""gets it"" and breaks the cycle of self-sabotage once and for all because he learns what really frees him and us!

196695,3,1582704147,"It's a little Corney, but for my purpose; to be used to show to a group as a basis for discussion, it works. I purchased it and I chose to show it to a group. The blub makes you think it is a real trial, but it isn't. it makes it's point however.",1412035200,,246,3.660377358490566

196703,5,1582704147,"I bought this for the reviews... it's a bit dorky, but the sweet, factual message of our limitless abilities to create our own reality shine through! I would have appreciated more attention on the Spiritual part / Quantum Physics part of our abilities, though. Still, so worth watching!",1396310400,,286,4.979166666666667
196704,4,1582704147,We really liked the message in this movie. friends from my church watched it with me. We all were moved.,1395878400,2,104,4.25

196711,5,1582704147,"We are the prisoners of our own minds.  This movie reveals that changing your perception can change your mind, which will lead to a happier life.

196713,5,1582704147,"If you found ""What the Bleep Do We Know?"" as a little too quirky, but like the basic premise of the movie, you might like Austin Vickers' take on how what you believe shapes the life you create.

Vickers puts together a formidable cast (some of whom you might recognize readily if you enjoyed ""What the Bleep"") to give their perspectives of how your focus generates your reality, which is woven along with the narrative of a man who finds himself in prison for his particular vision quest.

This is a fine, accessible film with some wonderful messages about changing your perspective and reaching your potential. You will likely be thinking and talking about a number of the points that Austin and the guest experts from psychology, business, biology, mathematics, medicine and engineering make. The segment where they report what they would say to the world if they had sixty seconds is very provocative.

I strongly recommend to you this film that gets better with each viewing. It's a good film to see as a group, too, and for having a discussion afterwards.

Thanks to Austin Vickers for this consciousness-raising presentation.",1378598400,3,1132,4.9109947643979055
196714,5,1582704147,"I first saw this film in Phoenix, Arizona, while attending my doctorate residency. My professor was in the film and gave the class a brief synopsis. Needless to say, my curiosity had sparked and several of my peers' and I went to the theater. I'm not sure that I have ever seen anything as thought-provoking, deeply moving, compelling, and real in my entire life! This is a must see for everyone!",1378598400,,396,4.591549295774648

196717,4,1582704147,"Reminiscent of the ""What The Bleep..."" movie.
Actually, I became aware of it while looking at the WTB website.

196723,4,1582704147,"This film is a nice introductory level presentation regardiing the interactions and results of the mind-body communion. How we think affects our bodies, emotions and behaviors. The talking heads present their information clearly and simply. This film is similar to Louise Hay's DVD You Can Heal Your Life (the extended version which I find more useful than People vs State of Illusion). ""People"", IMO, is better than ""The Secret."" As a Clinical Psychologist, I have recommended ""People"" to my patients who have found it very useful and thought provoking. Nicely done, overall.",1373068800,2,576,5.271739130434782
