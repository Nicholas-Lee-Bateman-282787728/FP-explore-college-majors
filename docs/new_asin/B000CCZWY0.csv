In the DVD you can see and hear the persons talking very clearly short sentences.
In my opinion that is the best method of learning.
I am waiting for their next follow up DVD ""Speak Arabic"".

8097719,3,B000CCZWY0,"As a collector of Arabic study materials, I have no objection with the method used in the video to teach simple phrases with lots of repetition. The problem i had viewing it was that the DVD kept hanging up and stopping. Maybe it needs a good cleaning, I'll try that before watching it again, but that shouldn't be needed with a new product. I am thinking the manufacture is shoddy, it is just a bad disk that stops a lot. My player plays all other disks fine, not this one. Buyer beware! I hope it plays clean next time.",1212451200,3,521,4.2727272727272725
