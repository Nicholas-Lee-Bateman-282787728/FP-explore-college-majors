The actors sometimes seem as though they are trying to remember their lines. Some of the scene changes look gratuitous, as if an excuse to deliver a few lines in a different cosutme. This may be endemic to Indian film, I don't know, but I have seen better quality Indian cross-over films, even some with musical scenes.",1314576000,,461,4.703703703703703

`Sambar Salsa' has already seen an overseas release and would be hitting the Indian shores now. Also starring singer / actor Taz in a principal role, `Sambar Salsa' is a tale with ingredients of humour, romance, emotion and drama.

The comedy tells the story of a Spanish girl, an Indian boy and disapproving parents, some who need little convincing and others who need a whole lot more.",1301961600,,561,4.957446808510638
