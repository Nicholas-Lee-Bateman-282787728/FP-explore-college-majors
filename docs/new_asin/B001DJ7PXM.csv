3531149,5,B001DJ7PXM,"Season Four of ""Project Runway"" starts out slow, but it builds up steam and draws you in... the show is still a high-class production and leaves other ""reality"" shows in the dust.

Early on, Tim Gunn pronounces this season's ensemble to be the most talented group they've had on yet... but it's a little hard to believe him since the cast lacks the dynamism and sharply defined personalities of earlier seasons. Nevertheless, a couple of designers quickly reveal themselves as unlikable or bizarre, and that always adds a little narrative spice. I would say that this season was largely packed with bland personalities, but once they drop out in the first half, the show gets more exciting, and when it becomes clear that one of the most irritating contestants has a pretty good shot at winning, the subsequent eliminations will get your adrenaline going.

This season was also marked by constant one-upping on the part of Heidi Klum and the producers -- almost every episode has a twist or a Big Secret. Sure, it's gimmicky... but so what?  It's also fun! Perhaps the greatest thing this season is Heidi's new wardrobe -- after being pregnant and having her baby during previous seasons, she's now trimmed back down and is again able to wear whatever she wants. One of the great joys of this season is to watch the reactions of the contestants as Klum arrives on the runway in one eye-popping outfit after another.

Great show.  Looking forward to Season Five!  (Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)",1227916800,9,1498,4.83203125
3531150,4,B001DJ7PXM,I just started watching this season on DVD and was looking at the back of the DVD case. One of the included extra features names the winner in its title. Be careful about reading the back of the DVD if you don't want to be spoiled.,1226620800,21,231,4.043478260869565
3531151,5,B001DJ7PXM,"This is my favorite season of Project Runway ever. The level of talent is unparalleled. Any of the final three designers could arguably have won and most likely would have won any of the prior seasons. Some of the challenges are silly (making costumes for wrestling divas comes to mind) but they add a bit of comic relief. The guest stars are appropriate and interesting. Sarah Jessica Parker's episode is a particular favorite because not only are the designers awe-struck, but they also have to wow her with a design for her ""Bitten"" line using only $15 of materials. Tiki Barber's challenge is also particularly interesting because it once again showcases the differences between designing for women and men.

There is little of the bickering among the contestants that has been so prominent in some seasons. And there is no clear villain among the cast. Didn't miss either one.

As for the ""extra's"": We do not have Bravo TV in our cable line up, so the shows are a first time view for me.  I can not tell you how much extra footage there is per episode. The extra features included in the DVD are minimal to the point of ridiculous. A short ""Wear is he now"" on the winning designer and a series of brief and obvious make up instructions are pretty much it.",1226275200,7,1261,4.595555555555555
3531152,4,B001DJ7PXM,"I purchased this season, hoping that it would be like 1,2,3... They didn't put in the fashion tryouts, I was hoping to see the people trying out for the show, and seeing some of last seasons, big-wigs.. coming back.. That is the only down side to this season... Please Project Runway peoples.. don't leave this out of your DVD's there is a lot of people out there like me that enjoy that part of it!

(Men's Camp Shirts) I am self taught at beginning pattern making and I've learned so much watching these shows. I also like to watch the interaction between the designers and Tim Gunn who I highly respect. I've watched the show since it started and am hooked on each years shows. I look at the kinds of machines they use, the draft paper, scissors, iron, everything that they use to make their garments. I glean much by pausing the videos and studying the work room.  It is great fun. If you pay close attention, you will get tips on textiles, underlayments, and mixing prints and colors.  Enjoy",1394668800,,686,4.661157024793388
3531189,5,B001DJ7PXM,"I feel I am late to the party, but I started watching season 4 only after watching Project runway all stars and seeing Rami Kashou's talent. After doing some research of what season he participated in, I had to watch that season. I find Rami Kashou very talented and I learned from watching him hard at work. I find his designs and creations very nice and they stood out from the other contestants.
Overall, the season was great with the different challenges each contestant faced.
My advice is to go check out project runway all stars to see all the other top designers to decide what season to watch.",1391817600,,602,4.532110091743119

3531192,5,B001DJ7PXM,"I had to have Fourth Season Project Runway precisely because I HAD viewed the season and knew the winner.  I wanted to be able to revisit the many entertaining moments of this season time and again. For me,  Season Four is one of the show's very best.  Even knowing the outcome of the challenges does not spoil its value for repeat viewings. Mentor Tim Gunn is still the same very lovable, mega-talented and highly revered mentor we met in Season One. One of the things so endearing about him is the fact that his face still seems etched in surprise at his popularity. Heidi and the judges have settled in comfortably to the success of the show and everything we have loved about them from the beginning ""carries on"".  Not to ""spoil"" the conclusion for those who buy this for first time viewing, the winner was not a slam dunk.  I find myself still cheering at the announcement of ""Who will be America's Next Big Fashion Designer""?.  If you love all things Project Runway, especially what made it popular in the beginning, Season Four is a classic and must to own.",1375833600,,1064,4.544502617801047

3531197,5,B001DJ7PXM,"So, I've just recently started watching project runway on TV (season 10) and in order to get my fix I ordered season 4 on DVD. TOTALLY FUN! I have to give this season 5 stars because of one person- Chris March! Loved him!! The rest of the cast is so talented and I can't get enough of Tim Gunn. Seeing as this was shot about 4 years ago, it's interesting to see how far the Project Runway empire has come!! I do have to say that there are spoiler alerts and I'm pretty sure if you know anything ab Project Runway you know who won this season, but it still makes it exciting! I'm excited to watch All Stars because i'm a huge fan of Sweet P 's as well!!!! HIGHLY recommend this DVD set, you will have tons of fun watching it!!

3531198,5,B001DJ7PXM,"I don't sew, but I adore this show!

Each season begins with approximately 12-16 up-and-coming fashion designers selected to compete for the opportunity to design a show for Fashion Week in Bryant Park of New York City.  Each episode introduces a new challenge for the designers in which they have minimal time to sketch and purchase materials for the challenge, always accomplished under significant time restraints.  The challenges themselves are often very interesting, such as the challenge to create clothing from non-traditional materials (e.g. items from a pet store, flowers, or items reconstructed from their own pajamas).

In addition to the challenges, the designers themselves bring a lot of color and character to the show.  The mentor, Tim Gunn, is terrific at encouraging the designers to to do their best with his trademark ""Make It Work, Designers!""  And if that isn't enough, the judges (Michael Kors and Nina Garcia) offer thoughful critiques.  And then there is the third judge and show host, Heidi Klum, who offers valuable input and something pretty to look at.

But at the core of it all is the fashion.  It is really interesting to watch the clothes come to life in each challenge, culminating in a runway show.

If you like fashion, you'll love Project Runway!",1341705600,,1285,5.04739336492891
3531199,5,B001DJ7PXM,"In my opinion, this is the best season of project runway for two reasons: (1) Chris March - this man could find humor in everything and made the show so much fun to watch. (2) Most Important - Christian Siriano!!! I love this little genius. He has an amazing eye and style. To see him grow on the show and get his start is amazing. To me, he is one of the most famous of all of the designers from project runway. He has talent and attitude, but not annoying like some other designers.

If you only buy 1 copy of project runway - MAKE IT THIS SEASON!!!",1329523200,,551,4.101851851851852
3531200,5,B001DJ7PXM,"This season is my favorite. It features the great Christian Siriano and the very funny Chris March of Mad Fashion.  The challenges are fun and different, including one in a Hershey's store, a Levi's denim contest, women who lost large amounts of weight and a fine art as inspiration challenge. Best of all, for me, the designers get along pretty well; there is drama without a lot of nasty fighting.",1318550400,,399,4.7
3531201,5,B001DJ7PXM,"Season 4 has Christian Siriano.  Other memorable contestants in this season include:
Jack (guy who dropped out because of MRSA, strong contender until then)
Chris (heavy guy who has done crazy costumes, very imaginative)
Ricky (lingerie designer, uber emotional guy, cried when happy, sad or awake)
Sweet ""P"" (totally screwed up a man's shirt, collar looked like it was 32"" around
Carmen (draped a piece of fabric around a man's neck, put a really bad unfinished cropped jacket over it)

Anyone who is a Project Runway fan knows it's impossible to buy the DVDs at Best Buy or to rent the series from Blockbuster.  They are simply not available.  I have bought episodes from iTunes, but nothing beats having DVDs where I can watch over and over.  Best of all, I don't have to download and organize the episodes so that I can watch a whole season at once, and I don't have to borrow hubby's iPod to connect it to the TV all day.  The price of buying a season of PR on Amazon is well worth it, most seasons are about $15 and that's cheaper than iTunes, too.  I love PR and the focus is really on the design and execution of the contests, with a little of the drama of other ""reality"" shows.  You do get a glimpse of the humanity of the contestants and Nina Garcia is a pretentious a$$ (she cannot even seem to PRETEND to be friendly, but Tim Gunn is absolutely teh awesome!",1316736000,,1370,4.452

3531203,5,B001DJ7PXM,"I have a lot of sewing experience, but have no time to watch TV, so I've never watched the Project Runway show until receiving this DVD as a Christmas gift. I'd heard of Project Runway from seeing sewing-related merchandise at the fabric stores, but didn't know what it was about until some sewing club members told me how much they loved this TV show. I got hooked from the first episode---this is really entertaining!

The show starts with 15 contestants who design and sew clothing for various assigned tasks----menswear, 2-piece ladies' outfit, etc, (one task per episode). The garments are modeled in a runway show and judged at the end of each episode. The number of contestants gradually dwindles at the end of each episode, when he/she who gets the lowest score for a garment is released from competition.

This show has laugh out loud moments. For those who sew, you'll get a laugh out of the contestant whose fellow teammate is exasperated and describes her as being from another planet---she has a ""unique"" approach to sewing. She is a nature spirit, into yoga, and she spit-marks her fabric, and her teammate has to explain to her that using pins is more accurate (and cleaner)! Unbelievable! I have to say, she's one of my favorites, and I like the way she uses the floor as a cutting board.

This show is filmed in such a personal way---you learn about each contestant, a little of their life, ambition, why they're attracted to fashion, their day jobs---these personal things really make you pick out favorites.

If you do a lot of sewing, you'll appreciate learning how these designers approach the tasks. Some of the contestants are obviously more experienced with sewing and tailoring, and if you sew you'll appreciate seeing them working hard at creating their garments. Some of the garments are absolutely lovely, and some are disasters. Those who sew will appreciate the sewing successes as well as the sewing mishaps.

One thing that I noticed and appreciated about the judging of the finished garments was that shoddy sewing was recognized by the judges, and that the contestant with the lowest score generally had the worst sewing. It's nice to know that good sewing skills are rewarded. On the other hand, you really have to sympathise with these contestants being under tight deadlines and scrambling to get their garments finished while running out of time. Some of the contestants are obviously skilled with sewing, and some seem to be gifted at drawing designs but lacking in sewing skills.

Sometimes celebrities are featured to assign tasks and to judge the finished garments (such as a former athlete/ news anchor who assigned a task of creating menswear suitable for a TV news host). Personally, I thought the contestants were far more interesting than the celebrities. I do not have time to watch TV, so I'd never heard of the celebrities on this show---one was an actress from Sex and the City. It is good that the narrarator/mentor/announcer tells us who the celebrity is and why he/she is famous.

It is always fun to see the new contestents and the results of each weeks challenges.  I am so glad that the show is back on again, but I do NOT like Model Runway, too much High School.

3531210,5,B001DJ7PXM,"I absolutely LOVE this show and have been watching it since it started.  This lull of time that passed as the show established its new home on the Lifetime network put me thru major PROJECT RUNWAY withdrawal and so I purchased all 5 previous seasons on dvd.  What a treat.  Any show is more enjoyable on dvd without commercials and editing.  To watch the show from the first episode till the last without any interruptions allowed me to gain even more from this season than before.  I love all the seasons but found this one to be the best.  I thought this was the season with the most talented fashion designers and the season leads to a final three all deserving to be showing their line at fashion week.

The show is always adhesively held together thru the charm and wit of Heidi Klum and the show could not exist without the heart and guidance of Tim Gunn.  And judges Nina Garcia and Michael Kors always have honest, valuable opinions as each projects designs are shown on the runway.  The unique thing about PROJECT RUNWAY is that all the contestants are people seriously pursuing a career in fashion with intense drive and the judges are all experts in the field as is Tim Gunn.  The drama that unfolds on the show is not manuipulated but merely due to the fact that while having these contestants do challenge after challenge and get eliminated one by one they form relationships and we get to care about these people.  Watching it unedited with no commercials I found this season to make me root for people I didn't particularly care for when I previously watched this season.

This show truly gets under your skin and is very addictive.  There is talent here and just by being what it is the show provides huge entertainment.  I can watch each season over and over even though I know the outcome.  There is a class and sincerity that rises this show above other reality shows out there.  And to watch contestants wear their hearts on their sleeve as they pursue their dreams to be big fashion designers is a gift.  I can't say enough about this show and this season in particular.  This season on dvd was short on extras.  There is a short profile on the winner after the season ended but I am fine with the lack of extras.  I would have loved blooper reels and even more of a history on each contestant but all of this really is a part of the show anyways.  So I give this dvd a A++++++ but do say realize you aren't getting any extras.  If you are ok with that you will be in PROJECT RUNWAY heaven.",1252972800,3,2511,4.413043478260869

3531212,5,B001DJ7PXM,"I've picked out this season of PROJECT RUNWAY to review because this season produced the most talented designer of any season of the show, Christian Siriano. He also happened to be the most interesting character. He is a slight figure of a young man who can and does try on his own clothes and models them (to great comic effect) plus has great expressions such as ""Fierce"" when he really likes something.  Also, he is likable, which is something that can't be said usually about most of the contestants.  He ran away with the viewers' prize of their most favorite character on the show.  No one else even came close.  His clothes are breathtaking.  Even Victoria Beckham was moved to say that she would wear every single one of his outfits. If you have never watched this show before, try this season, it is the standout because of Christian Siriano.

3531220,4,B001DJ7PXM,"My comments are about the DVD transfer, not the show itself. A warning to anyone who does not know the winner: don't read the back of the package! As another reviewer commented, they don't come right out and tell you who won, but you can figure it out pretty quickly. The editing for DVD seemed far more sloppy this time as well, especially at commercial breaks where you get to hear Heidi say the exact same thing before and after the cut. There are also far fewer extras than in previous seasons.",1240704000,,498,4.423913043478261

3531222,3,B001DJ7PXM,"First of all I love this show, it is only ""reality"" show where I watch it every week, and not an episode here and there. That being said I hate how the judges play favorites, I know this is partly due to the producers decisions, but their favoritism is way over the top. For instance take the obnoxious Christian Siriano (no he is not sexy, he is disgusting) he pretty much produced the same outfit every week.  It had to be black (with maybe some white, tan or brown if you were lucky) tight, with giant hats, and with either feathers or ruffles (or both).  There was no thought of whether people could wear this stuff all he had to say was that it was ""fierce"" for the judges to go gaga over it. I ask you; if any other of the contestants had made his horrible prom dress wouldn't they have been kicked off? Other contestants make similar outfits and they are kicked off for not being ""creative"" enough. The same for having a signature ""look"" such as prints or draping, if they do it every week they are criticized, not Christian though. Christian makes the same outfit every week and he is hailed as a genius. And then on top of it he was a condescending, jerk who thought everyone was beneath him, and was constantly critical of everyone else. I don't know why people even liked this guy he was such a jerk.  Oh and then for the final judging they Victoria Beckham as a judge! Like what does she know about fashion? I know she has been dubbed a ""fashion icon"", but for goodness sake she is a Spice Girl! They dressed like crazy prostitutes!  Anyway I like the concept of the show I think the judging stinks, hence the three stars. Wouldn't it be nice if the people could judge? I know it won't happen, but it would be nice.",1237248000,7,1727,4.304615384615385

3531224,5,B001DJ7PXM,I recently bought all 4 seasons and watched them for over a week.  Season 4 is the best of them.  It's more about talent and design than the gossiping and fighting between each contesters.,1232409600,,188,4.5

3531226,5,B001DJ7PXM,"Great show as always. Even if you know nothing about fashion design, the contestants and challenges not to mention the designs themselves will keep you entertained. You can also learn a lot about what's in style. Tim Gunn is the best aspect of the show, as the contestants' mentor.",1230422400,,281,4.755102040816326
3531227,5,B001DJ7PXM,"I think the title covers it.

As a slight negative the cuts to ads are jarringly obvious.  I'd never realized watching live how much of a leading to / recap out of ads project runway has.  As compared to other shows on DVD it's really striking when the ads are gone.",1229904000,,266,4.176470588235294

8293602,5,B001DJ7PXM,This is the best season of Project Runway. Well worth buying to revisit the early stages of Christian Sirianos career. Chris is a doll too.,1515715200,,139,4.6
