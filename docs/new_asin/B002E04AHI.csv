The price is great if you are like me, and just like monster movies.  Second, if you like Gamera, it is a good collection of his movies, and the inclusion of two others, Yongary and Gappa, were very nice.  Now the bad.  Most of the movies are in very bad shape, especially, in my opinion, Gappa.  A lot of the movie takes place in a dark setting, and it is almost impossible to see anything.  Also, it almost seems like the movie goes from color to black and white at times, it is so bad.  I don't want to review these movies since I haven't seen the uncut Japanese versions, however, the movie ""Yongary, Monster of the deep"" is an incredibly ridiculous and stupid movie.  It was literally painful to watch.  There is no plot that is clearly visible, and after the title monster was dealt with, you had at least 7 extra minutes of crap afterwards!  There are no extras, which I like, save for a slide show that advertises other value pack movies.  All in all, a sweet price for 6 movies, but if you want to substitute quantity for quality, definetly stay away from this one.",1276646400,,1229,4.365638766519824
