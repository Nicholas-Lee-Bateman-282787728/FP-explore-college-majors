6929300,1,B00REG9GEE,"Like many other movies and miniseries about this topic, this work is horrifically bad. It was poorly written, acted, and produced. It is almost laughable how awful this thing is. This is worse than some of the bad science fiction movies that I watch for kicks. It sticks to a convoluted interpretation of the Christian apocalypse that opportunists like Kirk Cameron, Jerry B. Jenkins, and Tim LaHaye have used to line their pockets for years, but the overused plot not even the worst aspect of this thing.

The shaky camera style is reminiscent of The Blair Witch Project, which fits well with the other poorly executed parts of the miniseries.  If you are prone to vertigo, migraines, seizures, or motion sickness, especially if these have been triggered in the past by past movies or television shows, you might want to avoid this for health reasons. If not, just avoid it for quality reasons. It's not entertaining enough to justify wasting so much time on it.",1423267200,5,963,4.83030303030303

6929311,5,B00REG9GEE,"I've watched this on History, and while some things may or may not be accurate.  One thing is clear.  The book of Revelation is a story of things to come, and how we as a people must be prepared for the return of Jesus.  As for the SFX, those that call them cheesy, well what do you want Michael Bay type of explosions????

There are many people on here whining about something in a movie and calling it totally inaccurate.  It's erroneous.  NO ONE knows how it will happen.  What we read in the Bible where John was seeing the visions, we as a people have a difficult time interpreting.  Scholars, ministers, historians, theologians all have different takes on the actual events.  Will the trumpets will sound for each event, will the angels will pour out their bowls, will there be cataclysmic disasters, do the four horsemen bring a reign of terror, does the anti-Christ rule the world?  All WILL happen and

If this movie can bring God's children to Him, if this movie causes people to read the Bible, if this movie causes people to accept Jesus Christ as their personal savior then God's work is done.

We only can draw from the past, we have limited knowledge of things to come.  God wants us to focus on now.  We are NOT guaranteed tomorrow or even the next minute.  I personally like this movie.  It helps bring me closer to the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.  How can that be wrong?  This is the problem with critics.  They look only at the superficial.  They do not look at the deeper meanings or how God can use tools to bring us closer to Him.",1522368000,2,1561,4.391608391608392

6929330,1,B00REG9GEE,"This movie is by no means related to the book of Revelation and there are many inconsistencies. There are some spoilers in what I am going to say but trust me, this will save you money and precious time.

First, the most annoying thing probably is the way they depict the Antichrist, as an American politician. The Antichrist is not american, he comes from the region of the Mediterranean Sea. Any average christian or Bible reader knows that. So this is the very first thing that is terribly inaccurate. He never proclaims himself as the Antichrist in the movie and neither is his image raised in the temple of the Jews. Oh wait, what temple? There is no mention of the temple. They somewhat say that the destruction of the second temple occurred to allow the building up of the third temple. But hey, the destruction of the second temple happened back in the year 70 A.D. and not at the beginning of the last week prophesied by Daniel. The temple was never destroyed by bombings but by the roman prince Titus and his army. There are no correct timelines in this movie related to events and prophecies, at all. The Antichrist brings an antidote to a disease created in a pharmacy and thus he gains fame and the favor of people. Really? A laboratory-created disease? Wow, never read that in my Bible.

They mention the Jews' Wailing Wall a lot in this film, but that is nowhere mentioned in the book of Revelation and has no spiritual/prophetic significance at all. I tried really hard to connect the dots to no avail.

The rapture scenes are a joke. There is mention of some people being raptured only because they were good people like a kid and later his mom which read some few pages in a Bible (that she probably never related to in her entire life) and then suddenly she was magically taken away in the rapture when she never even hinted that she gave her life to Jesus for salvation. She only read some stuff in a hurry (literally) and said to her husband that the calamities in the world were chronicled in the Bible, and thus, they had to be true. Oh my. I wish it was that easy. Besides, people are raptured at different times, like there were dozens of rapture waves. So if you could not make it to the first one, just wait for the second wave, or third, or fourth. Don't worry.

Some of the scenes where they depict natural calamities are clips taken from real life emergencies. That is a disgrace and a serious lack of respect not only for the viewers but also for the people who suffered those things in real life. Floods? Seriously? Where are floods mentioned in Revelation? God promised Noah that no flood was ever to be used by Him in His judgments anymore. But hey, the writers thought it was very adequate to portray their own misunderstanding of the Scriptures.

Everything from the interpretation of the visions of Revelation to the timelines are completely incorrect in this film. I cannot understand why Rome isn't even mentioned as the woman that sits on the the seven hills city. This is key to the book of Revelation and has deep spiritual and prophetical significance. Religious leaders? The Pope? The misguidance of the Roman Catholic Church? Of course not. None of that is mentioned in here. Oh no. In this film, the Antichrist decided that the south of the United States was a cooler place to establish his kingdom. And don't make me talk about the locusts from the fifth trumpet or what happens with any other of the six other trumpets. Totally incorrect, what a waste of time.

Too bad they wasted such a great opportunity to create a good film. Don't throw your money to the garbage can. This does not even deserve a rental if you are a truth seeker or a serious Bible student. This is probably only suitable for people who have never touched a Bible in their lives... but even for them, they deserve much better.",1510272000,49,3846,4.542568542568542

6929340,2,B00REG9GEE,"This movie is very unusual.  It is like the Blair Witch Project with shaky cameras and similar techniques.  It will make some people feel like they are sea sick.  It is not a documentary with a narrator.  It is supposed to resemble a bunch of unedited film that was captured and put together to tell the story.  It attempts to show you what it might be like at the End of Days.  It is a mini-series from 2014.

Before you purchase it, look for free samples online.

There are unusual interpretations of Scripture included.  The beast with seven heads in the Book of Revelation is thought to be a cell called 7HC with seven heads.  It apparently infects people and they resist the light. The supposed Bible scholar in the movie calls the final book in the Bible ""Revelations,"" instead of ""Revelation.""  No scholar would ever make such a fundamental error.

There is also cursing in the movie and it is NOT recommended for all ages.

6929354,4,B00REG9GEE,"I recently caught this miniseries on the history channel and I plan on purchasing copies for myself, family and friends. I have been studying end time bible prophesy since 1975. Considering the way that world events have been going since 1948 and especially since the 1960's, I found a great deal of accuracy in the way the subject was presented in this miniseries. The responses to the various disasters and events portrayed seemed to be very natural and logical, but of course they were not. That being said the movie gives a pretty accurate insight  to the goings on of the world (antichrist) leader. I think that its more than very important that people today take a very long, hard look and world events and the current events that have taken place in this country since the 60's. My only problems with this movie was the way that the rapture was portrayed. It will be far more than just the disappearance of children. It will be of all believers in Christ. The other problem was dealing with the return of Christ. That will be the most important event in human history and yet the event was not shown. Instead the movie ended one year after Christ's return and did not show what the earth and human life will be like. All in all, I think that this is a movie that should be seen my the masses.",1500854400,,1299,4.481012658227848

As someone who reads the Bible daily and has read it cover to cover more times than I can count, teaches Sunday School and Bible studies, I have to say this series is really, really bad. Which is disappointing since I've wanted to see it for a while. I got the feeling that the writers never read their subject matter in whole. The whole thing is disjointed and confusing with little biblical events thrown in here and there that come from the Bible, but there is no flow to the story at all.  And it's boring, too.  It amazes me how they can take this subject and make a snoozefest out of it. Seriously!  I was also surprised by the television preachers that allowed themselves to be used in it.  It's not true to the Bible and tends to confuse more than enlighten.  Why be a part of that?
The end of days is going to be a terrifying time - worse than the world has ever seen during its worst times.  The Bible is very clear on that. This little series does not even come close to portraying it. And the ending?  Man, the writers of this don't get the Bible at all!  What a wasted effort!",1498867200,2,1142,4.225806451612903

Only where the author of Scripture uses a figure of speech should that carefully be interpreted according to authorial intent in the context not our modern speculations. Withholding speculation and instead following the principle of the analogy of faith or the Scriptural harmony principle is most critical when handling highly figurative texts like John's Revelation of Christ's return.

The notion of a viral outbreak sounds plausible but there were no mention to boils or blindness striking those who have received the mark of the beast. Nor was there any other sufferings those with the mark will receive. On that end, it would not be a barcode...but something more complex.

6929381,2,B00REG9GEE,"I have taught on the Book of Revelation.  This secularized interpretation may fascinate the novice viewer, but it strays too far from basic Biblical understandings to be useful for a serious student of the Bible. Random proof texts were used to justify the film, rather than understand the Biblical message. The film is typical of the modern world view that always insists the Bible comfortably conform to our contemporary notion of what is ""realistically"" possible. Another a priori assumption is that if or when we find Biblical truth difficult to apprehend, it must automatically be up for grabs, so any and all speculation is equally acceptable.  In any other field of investigation, we would not hesitate to insist on a more rigorous level of expertise, or at least subject area background, before seriously dealing with our topic of study.",1492992000,2,845,5.071942446043166

6929405,1,B00REG9GEE,Poor job thought it would be much better coming from the History Channel. They kept shaking the camera became very annoying,1484006400,3,123,4.904761904761905
6929406,3,B00REG9GEE,"Several reviews, both here and on Netflix, claim that this film was not ""Biblical."" While I will agree that it is not a verbatim retelling of the Book of Revelation, it is pretty on point in regards to the sequence of events. There may have been a bit of literary license taken here and there, but not so much as to take away from the message. I do have a problem with the fact that they kept referencing Scriptural passages out of context. Every preacher and church does this and when you actually read the full text surrounding the selected passage, you find that it has nothing at all to do with what is being claimed. My only real Scriptural argument against this movie is with the pre-Tribulation rapture teaching. This is a matter of interpretation, but in Mark 13, Jesus seems to say that the elect will endure the Tribulation just like everyone else, so...

I would give this four-stars but for the whole ""Blair Witch"" handi-cam film style. I don't know what moron first thought this was a good way to film a movie, but me personally, I despise this ""style."" Usually I will not even watch a movie filmed like this, but I wanted to see who this narrative was presented. Otherwise, the acting was good, the characters were well developed and the film draws you in. The effects were well done without being overly theatrical. If you can stomach the shaking camera for 3 hours, you'll enjoy this movie.",1482969600,,1406,4.557312252964427

I don't mind this style if it's only for brief scenes but an entire 172 minute movie in ""Shaky Cam"" gets annoying. Call me Old-Fashioned but I like a Steady-Cam for long movies.

6929490,2,B00REG9GEE,"This Documentary ""Revelation: The End of Days"" on the Book of Revelation was ""admittedly laughable and imbicilic"".
It had the antichrist, the Roman Emperor Nero Caeser, whose name any Mathemetician will tell you adds up to 666 in Greek where Saint John wrote the Book of Revelation on the Island of Patmos, Greece, in the 1st Century, coming back to life as President Brandon of the United States in the near future!
The ""imbecilic producers, directors and writers"" also had the ""Two Witnesses"" in the Book of Revelation, the Apostles Saint Peter and Saint Paul who were crucified upside down by Nero Caeser in the last 3 and 1/2 Years of his Reign from 54AD to 68AD in 66AD ""coming back to life"" as 2 Modern Day Prophets who President Brandon, the re-incarnation of Nero Caesar (?!!), had put to death ""live"" on these huge TV Screens spread throughout the United States in the near future.
Folks, the 1000 Year Reign in Chapter 20 of the ""Book of Revelation"" was from the Coronation of the Holy Roman Emperor Charlemagne in 800AD to the Collapse of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806AD. So, right now, where in Chapter 20 Verse 8 ""Gog and Magog"" and any Historian or Geographer will tell you that is Modern Day Iraq, The Middle East and the Holyland where where there's a war going on right now.
So, what happens next in in Chapter 20 Verse 9-15 of the Book of Revelation?
Right, after a series of Apocalyptic Events, ""Fire falls from the Heavens and the 2nd Coming of Christ at the End of the World ""The Large White Throne"".
And these bonehead producers, directors and writers had this ""journalist claiming laughably, at the end of the documentary that maybe there
will be another 1000 years of peace on Earth if ""we, (the human race) don't mess up"".
One Problem.
After the ""2nd Coming of Christ"" and ""The Final Judgement"" which is the complete and utter end of the Human Race on Earth and the End of The World. There's no 1000 Year Reign of Our Lord Jesus Christ on this Earth because are Lord Jesus Christ only lives once as a God and a Human from 1AD to 33AD and the ""Thousand Year Reign from Charlemagne in 800AD to the Fall of the Holy Roman Empire 1806AD"" in The Book of Revelation Chapter 20 isn't going to happen again.
Humanity is in Chapter 20 Verse 8 ""Gog and Magog"" of The Book of Revelation right now.
So, most of The Book of Revelation is already long past. So, what happens in Chapter 20 Verse 9-15 of The Book of Revelation next?
Right the Apocalyspe and the 2nd Coming of Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ ""The Large White Throne"", ""The Final Judgment of the Living and The Dead"" and ""The End of the World."" The Righteous go to Heaven and the unrighteous go to hell for all eternity. The ""New Heavens and the New Earth"" in Chapter 21 and 22 of The Book of Revelation has nothing to do with this Universe or this Earth. It's Heaven because Our Lord said ""My Kingdom is not of this World"" and the unrepentant evil will be damned for all eternity...
Whoever Produced, Directed and Wrote this Documentary ""Revelation: The End of Days"" didn't learn much in ""Kindergarden Catechism"". The Book of Revelation or ""Revealing"" is about the last 2,000 Years not just the ""The 2nd Coming, Final Judgement and End of The World."" It even has material about the beast or antichrist, the Roman Emperor Nero Caeser, who swore to destroy ""Christendom"" in the 1st Century by murdering the ""Two Witnesses"" The Apostles Saint Peter and Saint Paul and All Christians. The Roman Emperor Nero Caeser is well known to everyone as ""the beast"" or ""antichrist"" that Saint John speaks of in the Book of Revelation because his name, Nero Caeser, mathematically adds up to 666 in Greek and 616 In Hebrew.
He's not coming back to life as some modern day President Branson you idiots...

It describes a greatly imagined story of Revelations from the Bible in a modern fashion and was good on every single point. They went though a lot of trouble to get every detail right.

If 'The Rapture' happened this very moment, I'd probably be left behind in some
kind of Rupture category. I'm NOT perfect; you're NOT perfect... you get nailed on
a cross if you are.
I'm not a movie critic... that, in part, is why I'm slowly slipping away from my
better days as a TOP 500 Reviewer, here. It, after all, is a non-paying hobby...
much like being a Christian. Maybe I'll have a reward, later; or, I hope so. Well,
anyway, I enjoyed this movie very much. SINCE much of it is hand-held, filmed, doc-
umentary-style, it might not be as easy to follow on a small TV. I have a 55"" screen,
and noticed subtle things in the movie that starts out in---the hand-held says--3/16/2016.
////////////////////////////PLOT SPOILERS [what the hell; read it!]////////////////////////////
""The Wailing Wall"" is blown up with the sounds of trumpets...asteroid/meteor hits...
""Jerusalem"" CNN-style news reports kept reminding me that there IS no Jerusalem without
the USA (in the middle[of the word]). Israel attacks Iran for the bombing. Israel is
attacked from the North. America and The Western World just sit on their hands.
On 3/19/2016 the children disappear [in Rapture]. Of course, in these type of films,
the parents think the children are all kidnapped.
On 3/21/2016 a ""superbug"" pandemic is introduced into the world BY the government, ON
PURPOSE. The American government says the missing children ALL have the disease that
hurts your eyes, so they have hidden away in DARK places.
On 3/24/2016 The President, and Vice President die from the man-made, seven-headed, virus.
This, self-appointed [anti-Christ] man assumes The Presidency, permanently, and declares
martial law. Rioting begins; Christians clump together, secretly, in fear of being shot.
_____________________________
Seven years later (2023), 40% of Americans are dead.
New Orleans is designated ""Safe Zone"".
Buses, provided by THE GOVERNMENT, are provided for ""anyone"" wishing SAFETY in New Orleans.
Separate, specially equipped, buses are available---with ""doctors""---for those folks over-70.
Later, ""Bottom-less pits are discovered full of the bodies of people over 70; that are a burden
on THE GOVERNMENT. New Orleans IS the new Babylon.
A protester in all this that interrupts news reports telling of The Anti-Christs deception,
these seven years---and his aid---are murdered by the government. Their bodies put on public
display, and on TV. Three days later, ""He"" is alive again. One thousand years of peace begin
when Christians---now in public---kill The Anti-Christ.

But the filming is horrible. The jumpiness of the camera rends the entire experience nothing but a migraine in the making. My wife only made it through half of the first chapter before she had to go to bed. I made it part way through the last chapter before it got me too (and I had to do that over a two day period). If someone were to reproduce this film using good Cinematography I would upgrade to 5 stars and buy it again in a heartbeat.
