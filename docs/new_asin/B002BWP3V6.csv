8362310,5,B002BWP3V6,"Beautifully hand crafted patchwork of narrators and historical events in 20th century expressing their stake in this country ranging from multigenerational Parisian aristocrats and intellectuals to a tunesian comedian and school headmistress in the politically charged suburbs. The monstrous leader of the French police in 1941-1944 chose to be SS surrogates to round up Jewish innocents in the vichy regime. It is good to see secular and religious jews announce they are proud to be French citizens citing their military service and sacrifices in all wars to the the nation and jews freely criticize their native country or their imperial fatherland if thrown out of  Algeria, Egypt, Turkey, etc.  French people of all backgrounds rally to fight acts of antisemitism in the streets. Under Israeli leader Yitzak Rabin who was assasinated, there was no intifada so hearing from intifada provocateur Sharon in regards to the spread of pograms and protests in France and encouraging aliyah was an oxymoron. The film did not include the changes brought about by the internet as a catalyst for economic and  political turmoil in France. But where is the outrage of the media and street mass rallys here in the USA to weekly synagogue arson attacks and antisemitic firebombings and anti-semitic graffiti in Rutherford, New Jersey and Midwood, Brooklyn.  24/7 police protection at every synagogue is not as powerful a message as marches and massive street protests. Two old major synagogues, Central and Kehilath had major accidental????fires in so called renovations. Now we need a documentary like this entitled being an american jew in 2012. I hate to say it, but the conservative republican movement may help our shrinking tiny minority in the USA today from being scapegoated for todays economic and third world ills. Museums of tolerance throughout the United States with school children taught the real danger of bigotry helps enormously however. Not included in the film was the French publics support for Strauss-Kahn's sex tryst or rape believing it was a setup by an African maid working for criminals. Fortunately for French Jews they have been spared the deadly civilian bombings that occured in other diaspora communities ie, Iranian terrorists carbombing a youth jewish center in  Buenos Aires, the Israeli olympic team executions in Munich,the massacre by Pakistani al queda in Mumbai of a Jewish enclave. My uncle and his children did not do an aliyah to Israel when the Buenos AIres community center was firebombed nor change his last name, Levi. So France is not unique in its loyal jewish citizens. I attended a tiny street rally led by  Harlem's Reverend Calvin Butts in front of the Argentine embassy to protest the ugly fact that their police knew of the imminent threat and did not protect the center from  the firebombing nor did they immediately arrest the murderers(but delayed the arrest). Yhe silliest quote (the last interview) was when a white haired Jewish ambassador said jewish french antisemitism is merely a symptom of a democracy that is ailing as if it will pass. I say we all know whose blood is always spilled the most. Just because the killing stats are lower than Poland's during the Shoah antisemitism is still an outrage. And thanks< France for letting my family stay 6 years after the shoah, where I and my siblings were born,  but I will never understand why my family in 1951 left for the USA and changed their names.",1327190400,,3457,5.063268892794376
