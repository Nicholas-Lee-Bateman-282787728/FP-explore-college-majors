8088813,4,B000BM7Z28,"Four stars for the Emily Remler segment. Thanks to her clear, professional explanation, I can almost play an impressive, very pretty Brazilian groove, complete with bass line. And there's a useful subtext here, too, kids. Check out those pathetic, scary needle marks up and down the veins on her fretting hand. And no attempt by her to cover them up. She was terrific.",1401235200,,368,4.857142857142857
8088814,1,B000BM7Z28,"39 minutes for 6 segments. once you figure in transitions that is 5 minutes per segment. And the segments are pretty thin. A bit of info on substitutions. The tabs book is VERY thin and very little of the video is transcribed. Try Jimmy Bruno's No Nonsense Jazz Guitar it has a fat tabs book, is way longer, and it fits together instead of just throwing parts of several videos together like this piece of trash.

Over all a RIP OFF",1144022400,6,432,4.333333333333333
8088815,4,B000BM7Z28,"If you are tired of playing the same stuff and hearing yourself play the same stuff.  You should get this DVD.  It really expanded the way I thought about chords and showed me some new ideas of how to approaching chording differently.  Joe Pass will blow your mind!  The DVD can get a little irritating on some parts, because some of the musicians don't have diagrams that go along with what they are demonstrating. So get your pause finger ready.  It is well worth it.  It brought me out of a musical rut.  You might be able to make some musical connections with this DVD.  Give it a try.",1143072000,3,589,4.339449541284404
