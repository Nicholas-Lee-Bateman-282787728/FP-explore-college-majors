995528,4,6305240655,"""Rounders"" is basically Steve McQueen's ""The Cincinnati Kid"" modernized (and ""The Cincinnati Kid"" is basically a good attempt at copying Paul Newman's classic ""The Hustler"" with poker instead of pool.  Luckily,  ""Rounders"" works very well and has some solid performances throughout  (although I'm not sure what to make of Damon's girlfriend in the film).  What sets ""Rounders"" apart is the narrative that runs throughout the film,  giving the audience an insider's look at the finer points of the `game'.  Normally, when a film attempts to insert a lot of narration, it sadly  detracts (""Blade Runner"" is a good example).  In this case, however, the  narration is timely and really adds to the film.  Between 1 and 10,  ""Rounders"" gets a marginal 8.",924307200,,749,5.057377049180328
995529,5,6305240655,"Sweet movie about the Underground Poker scene in N.Y. Many big names including Matt Damon and John Malcovich spice up a modern version of the Hustler. Saw this and the theaters, but the effect  comes across better on  the smaller, more intimate screen. Portrays addiction and gambling better  than most such movies.",923443200,,315,5.019230769230769
995530,5,6305240655,"This truly is an accurate poker movie.  It follows the life of an aspiring young poker player who gives up his best friend, his girl friend and his law career to follow his true dream.
Critics have claimed that this  movie lacks character development, and makes the mistake of developing  characters that seemingly disappear during the movie.  While this is true,  I believe it was done purposefully, and is indicative of the life of a  professional poker player.
The poker games are realistic and believable,  which makes the movie a joy for serious players.  Unfortunately, most poker  fans will not understand all of the nuancnes and conventions used in the  move.  The main style of poker, no-limit hold 'em, is not a popular variety  of poker unless you are a truly serious player.
In short, this is a great  movie for serious poker fans, but will not be appreciated by the general  audience.
Personally, I loved it.  It ranks as one of my favorite  movies, but I can understand how many people would not appreciate it.",918777600,,1024,4.732954545454546

995748,4,6305240655,"Not quite a classic Damon movie but very entertaining.

The Good:  Damon plays a compulsive poker player willing to give up his life with a serious law student girlfriend and potentially ordinary existence for the thrill of the cards.  The movie presents the various characters but refrains from moralizing about these obviously aberrant creatures as they dabble along the edges of normalcy.  Damon plays the role straight and in the genre of the hero who has an immutable internal code of conduct.  Because of his own stringent morality, Damon becomes obligated to the debts of another player (for no reason that I could figure out) and the movie then proceeds to a showdown as Damon simultaneously attempts to clear his friend's debt as well as expunge a prior loss to a feared Russian mobster (played with both humor and pathos by John Malkovich.)

The acting across the board is uneven and often kitschy and the movie seems to have been put together quickly. Lots of lazy metaphors and stock characters.  The viewer is not given much to go on besides the fairly obvious conclusion and the rush to achieve it.

The Bad:  the plot is tortured, barely believable and sometimes so downright contrary to any expectation of reality that the viewer is forced to stop and re-suspend his disbelief. If you are a fan of this genre, you will know the ending from the beginning and simply allow the movie to pull you along.

But finally, Damon is good enough to make it all watchable and if you have a lazy sunday afternoon, put it on and lose yourself in it for a few hours.",1482710400,,1567,4.665454545454545

Matt Damon is a law student and ace poker player who plays the game straight, as opposed to Edward Norton, his irresponsible pal, who loves to help his hand with some bottom-card dealing. The generally overrated John Markovich plays a Russian high-ranking poker house owner, sporting an accent that is too studied to sound realistic. Gretchen Mol is Matt Damon's love interest who tries to steer him away from poker but fails. She's largely just the voice or reason, without much else to offer as a colorful personality. Somehow, the movie failed to draw me in, because most of its scenes ended up as expected, and also because I was never much on Matt Demon's side. 3 1/2 stars",1479168000,,746,4.790697674418604

Malkovich is cool and ruthless, like ...you get the idea. All actors play to their individual strengths so much that it almost doesn't work. Almost. They still somehow retain the chemistry to keep you emotionally invested. The ending is entirely obvious but the path there may surprise you at times. And it's a fun ride. I'm not a card player so there's a lot that I feel I missed. That's not a bad thing though. The card jargon felt focused, not pretentious.

This was not a popular movie. Many people have never heard of it. But it should be a lot more popular than it is because it's fantastic. Its got an all star cast. (Matt Damon, John Malkovich, John Turturro, Ed Norton). It's well acted. It's an interesting story.

Matt Damon plays a kid who to be a card hustler. He turns his life around and is on the way to becoming a lawyer when he gets sucked back into the underworld of card sharking.

Matt Damon makes you like his character. Ed Norton makes you hate his. John Malkovich is....well he's John Malkovich. Plan on being creeped out by him. It's what he does.

It's just a fantastic movie. I saw this in the theater when it first came out and still remember leaving the theater impressed.

997467,4,6305240655,"This 1998 movie is an enjoyable exercise in a familiar genre -- the kind of movie in which a person who has made a mess of some aspect of his life gets a chance at ""redemption"" (I use the word loosely!) by having to win some decisive contest.  That contest might be a fight (""The Wrestler,"" ""Rocky""). a court case (""The Verdict""), a battle (""Top Gun""), a fishing rivalry (""A River Runs Through It""), or, in this case, a game of poker (Texas hold 'em, to be exact).  The basic pattern allows for a lot of variety -- the protagonist's mess-ups might be matters of bad luck, or lack of moral courage,"" or alcoholism, or some ethical failure -- and the antagonists might be genuine bad guys or just neutral challenges that he has to meet to demonstrate that he is worth our sympathy and the sympathy of his friends and/or lovers in the particular story.  In this story, Matt Damon is Mike McDermott, a law student whose real gift and whose real interest is in playing high stakes poker and who, in an effort to finance a trip to Vegas, where he would like to compete at the highest levels, loses $30,000 to Teddy KGB (John Malkovich, with Oreos), a Russian mob-connected player who seems to be running games out of a basement area in New York City.  Mike loses fair and square, as he knows is always possible, and at the urging of his girlfriend (Gretchen Mol) gives up the game, and to finance the rest of his education, takes a job as truck driver for Joey Knish (John Turturro), an acquaintance who makes a living playing poker cautiously.  Joey seeks to minimize risk and avoid high stakes, while Mike relishes the high stakes and therefore the risk that goes with that.

Trouble starts when Mike's friend Worm (Edward Norton) gets out of jail and has to find a way of paying off an outstanding debt.  To avoid a lot of spoilers, I'll just say that Mike stands surety for Worm, so the debt becomes his -- this is now HIS mess, even though we can see that it was prompted by a sincere desire to help out an old friend.  But Worm is neither reliable nor honest, and his impulse control is zero, with the result that the debt that Mike has stood surety for grows larger, and -- as is predictable in this kind of movie -- it's going to take a big win in a climactic game to pay it off.  The young Matt Damon -- fresh from ""Good Will Hunting"" -- is fine as Mike, but the smaller parts taken by Turturro and Malkovich are more vividly played.  As Worm, Edward Norton is infuriating -- which is exactly what's required -- and as a law professor sympathetic to Mike, Martin Landau gives him both advice and practical help.  Landau tells Damon's character that his parents never forgave him for giving up rabbinical study and becoming a lawyer -- and the fact that he became a respected and successful one cut no ice with them.  The question for Mike is clear -- is a lawyer really YOUR calling?  And we, the audience, might wonder -- is playing poker really a calling?  Well, see the movie and find out -- it's well acted, atmospheric, and entertaining.",1435881600,,3045,4.414285714285715

997613,5,6305240655,"Towards the beginning of the film, Mike McDermott (Matt Damon) chats with his girlfriend and fellow law student (Gretchen Mol) about his world of poker-playing, and she says that she can't believe that her boyfriend associates with someone named ""Worm"" (Edward Norton). In many ways, this short discourse describes largely what the story is about. It centers around the two worlds of Mike McDermott. There is Mike McDermott, law student, who habituates the very demanding and yet predictable world of professors and classmates at a nameless law school, maybe Columbia or NYU. And there is Mike McDermott, poker player or ""rounder"", who inhabits the world of card sharks which seems like another planet when compared to the world of the law school. Much of the movie is about McDermott's straddling these two worlds and realizing that he may have to choose one or the other.

This film is not about poker playing in the sense of strategy, tactics, folding, bluffing, etc, or at least we receive very little insight into the poker strategist's mind, except during the opening sequence. Instead, which is maybe a better focus, we learn about the world of the poker player. Where he plays, where he doesn't play, whom he plays, and what he's trying to accomplish. We learn about the different secret games and the strange characters that populate this other dimension which seems on the periphery of society.

Joey Knish (John Turturro) is the ""rounder's rounder"" who plays poker for a living and is one of the few level-headed people among these cut-throats. Often he tries to guide the young McDermott and steer him away from the deadlier side of the game. Teddy KGB (John Malkovich), whose nickname refers to his high position in the Russian mafia, owns a strange underground poker facility that you won't find in the yellow pages. And the creme-de-la-creme is ""Worm"", played with angst and nervous energy by Edward Norton, who is both a brilliant poker player but a reckless cheat who deals ""hangars"" even when he's winning. (A hangar"" is a cheated deal in which certain cards are dealt from the bottom of the deck to a particular player or players to either advantage or disadvantage their hand(s).) Much of the film is about their relationship, and how a scam got Worm busted before the story begins and how the two have to fight to get out of a much larger predicament than governmental authorities.

The world of the law students, which ends up playing second fiddle to the poker world, includes McDermott's girlfriend and one of the professors, played by Martin Landau. The glimpses of the more refined world of the law school acts as an excellent reflection on the seedier poker universe to better define McDermott and how he fits into both. But as the movie progresses, the poker world monopolizes larger and larger amounts of his time, energy and attention.

Briefly, the film begins with a devastating poker heads-up hand between McDermott and none other than Teddy KGB, the most feared man of the movie, down in KGB's own ""poker casino"" that looks like an underground detention center. The story fast-forwards several months later as McDermott tries to reconcile himself vowing to quit poker forever, like an alcoholic vows to stop drinking, and devote all his energy to studying law. But when he picks up Worm from prison, McDermott ends up getting sucked back into the game. And the more he plays, the more his law studies and his girlfriend take a back seat. Simultaneously, a sub-plot is brewing in which we learn that Worm has many obligations awaiting him when he was released from custody, and simultaneously, he has not shaken his ""interesting"" ways of winning poker hands which starts becoming a very dangerous game. Eventually, Worm's situations, both past and present, McDermott's willingness to get back into poker intersect providing an incredible tale of twists and turns that will keep you wondering who's got the hand and who's bluffing.

Rounders is a gem of movie. The acting is absolutely first rate all around, particularly from the supporting cast. The movie has elements of a suspense thriller with high intelligence and yet always reminds you that this is about poker players. Johnny Chan, the twice champion of the World Series of Poker, makes an unexpected cameo. And of course, the highest acclaim for Matt Damon and Edward Norton. You might be able to bluff a bad hand but the acting and script is the real deal.",1431043200,3,4449,4.910904255319149

When the part came up where the guy pulled the dog out from under the sofa, that was it for me. Animal cruelty is NEVER entertaining. I got it without that being necessary, the guy was BAD!!! Hopefully, this was just faked for the film, but it sickened me none the less.

Give this one a miss, unless you like a predictable plot, lots of F this, F that and cruelty/violence too. Not my idea of entertainment. Sad to think it is for some though.",1425340800,5,521,4.2

Matt Damon respected the game by playing a calculated balance of chance minimized by reading human nature and ""tells"". Edward Norton played the game a different way relying on his masterful craft of slide of hand, finding any edge he could by cheating to the edge of no return. John Malkovich and John Turturo played solid supporting roles. All in all, an enjoyable movie that keeps you rooting for the underdog.",1415664000,,480,4.795180722891566

It's rare when any film or TV show runs for more than one hour without an interruption, and virtually every show must be started again after a minute or so.

Unfortunately, it's almost impossible to contact Amazon and tell them what's going on, and how poor the streaming service is. They wonder why their profit earnings are down. Perhaps they should make it possible for their Prime customers to tell them.",1415318400,,639,4.8090909090909095

You don't have to know a lot about poker to enjoy this character driven drama.  While there aren't any real surprises in the plot, it still manages keep you on the edge of your seat.

I don't even play poker, but it was cool to watch how people live this kind of life. Nerves of steel is what they have, oh, and a poker face doesn't hurt much either! I've heard that both Matt Damon and Ben Affleck actually play in some of these high stakes games in their ""real lives"". I can't imagine what it would be like to make a living playing poker, it's so unpredictable. Ya never know what the cards hold, but you can win or lose it all in just ONE HAND!

Then he gets the news that Worm is getting out and what Mike doesn't know is that big trouble is coming with him. Some reviewers have called ""Rounders"" a ""crime drama"" but I think that moniker sells it short. For me, it's a beautifully filmed and gripping story of addiction, skill, courage, love and loyalty. The sets are amazing, the script is smart and very moving and the direction puts you right in a chair at the tables.

At the end of the story, the Matt Damon character was clearing up loose ends. The narration by Damon talked about things instead of us being shown the actions. An example is when he says how he used his winnings to pay back people such as the law professor. Always show instead of tell. The movie was entertaining.",1407974400,,608,4.735849056603773
1001317,5,6305240655,"Rounders is what I call another kind of sports film. It tells a story about two gambler friends. Michael ""Mike"" McDermott needs to quickly earn enough cash playing poker to after losing all of his bankroll while Lester ""Worm"" Murphy is a card ""mechanic"" needs to pay off a large debt that he owes to gangsters just got released from prison. It narrative centers on the adventures of these two people as they go through different underground casinos to earn the money that they need.

The movie provided a lot of excitement. One may consider the thrills that gambling provides but it was story of both constant conflicts between Mike and Worm,who principles in gambling are opposite each other,that made the story interesting. Credit that to the great performances of the cast especially Matt Damon and Edward Norton. The highlight of this film is the final clash between Mike and Teddy KGB,which is a Rocky-like battle between champion and underdog. This is a must see not only for Poker enthusiasts but also for people who love underdog sports films in the tradition of Rocky. Finally,I would not be even surprise if a viewer want to learn how to play poker after watching it.

This is a definitely a classic Poker movie!!!! Definitely,there is no other film about poker that has yet to surpass it after more than 16 years when it was first released in theaters.",1407974400,,1363,4.771186440677966

He makes the mistake of overestimating his skills and underestimating his opponent,  and that's when things really pick up.  He retrieves his best buddy (Ed Norton) from prison after that clown finishes his sentence, and his buddy brings him even lower.  That brings us to his eventual....

I am also impressed how Norton can play such a bad guy and become creepy and irresponsible.. lol. and yet hold some really strong characters in some movies. All the supportive players also did so well. It was fast and slow and suspenseful all at the same time. A must watch,1406851200,,442,4.469135802469136

1001783,5,6305240655,Loaned out my first copy and never got it back.  I needed a replacement.  Everyone that even has the slightest interest in poker should watch and own this movie!,1397952000,,161,4.517241379310345
1001784,5,6305240655,"First, before I explain my title, Rounders, for me, has to be in Matt Damon's top 5 movies he has starred in thus far. I know very, very little about playing cards, with the exceptions being Tunk, Go Fish(hahahaha!).....man, is that it?! Brain fart, I'll probably update this later with maybe 2 to 3 more that I can't think of at the moment. But, whether you play for fun or for real, putting your hard earned bucks where your mouth is, Rounders displays such vivid disappointment AND excitement; and with the cast assembled for Rounders, they all brought their A game and from the opening hand(like that, hand-cards-yeah), you are sucked into believing this is real. No CGI, no special effects, nothing extra to sell this movie because it just did not need it. There is a scene where these judges, who gather together to play cards what seems to be frequently, has Martin Landau, who plays Abe Petrovsky, assisted by Matt Damon's character, Mike McDermott, in spectacular fashion in winning a hand. Seeing Landau immediately made me think of his playing opposite of Peter Falk in an episode of Columbo, and I thought, ""Man, with the guys installed here to be the judges, Peter Falk would have sent this over the top!"" Anywho, it is very easy to imagine a person getting completely sucked in to this lifestyle because the adrenal rush, whether you are losing or hopefully winning, comes through, convincingly. Edward Norton, who plays Worm, shows the extreme of gambling with cards, who upon being released from prison, has to get his fix on like an addict. It is hard to like him because he never, never, NEVER EVER EVER EVER(what's up Smo-KEY!), considers anything but how to win, often with deception and lies. I found myself saying, ""Stupid, what are you doing?!"" Yeah, Norton can act and even with pondering how, as MIke says with the voice overs, no one ever stood for Worm up to that point in his life, you still want to gut punch him into seeing the thick of the moment(s). A+++++. ALL. DAY. LONG.

NOW, to the point I made in my title. The image shown is not what I received but it's what I expected. Not a big deal, until you DO NOT get what other reviewers mentioned. Others have spoke about the bonus features, about those REAL card players which constitutes the background of how the actors were prepared to do what they do. NONE OF THIS accompanied my purchase. There is no disc menu, no bonus features and has package synopsis in both English & French. I can only assume the company who made this particular Blu-ray version were stationed in Canada. Again, this should not be an issue but it is since the back story to Rounders is not provided. Before you buy this movie, BE ABSOLUTELY sure you are getting your money's worth. Ebay offers the Blu-ray/DVD combo for less money, although it is not clear if the bonus features are available. This footage does exist, so be sure to ask the seller if their offering does indeed include this.",1397779200,,2951,4.6316793893129775

I won't do an significant spoilers unless requested. However, I wouldn't trade Gretchen Moll for Edward Norton on the best day He ever had. John Turtorro is also a scene stealer.

Now Damon, in this film, really demonstrates his ability to 'naturally' show that he cares about this Buddy and wants to help him.
And Norton's character has been cheating so long, he actually believes his own con is the realistic way to live.  Norton does a great job of 'bringing to life' that Guy that can't get past being 17, with all his slick sounding talk that says nothing.

The direction and technical advice were stellar and I don't think there has ever been a movie quite like it. Despite this, I found it unrealistic that he would put everything in the pot while betting against the Russian. Yet his loss served as a lesson for him towards the end of the film.

The DVD commentaries were great in the version I had. All of the clowns who rated this movie One-Star bought the innital version from the late 1990s and thus missed the later versions. This is the best poker movie I've ever seen set in contemporary times. There were a few I loved set in the 1800s and 1930s thru 1950s, but this was the best of them all.

Matt Damon is an incredible actor and an even better person. I'd love to see a sequel to this movie. Where is Worm today in 2012? Did Damon's character win the World series of Poker or did e return to law school? Hats off to the costars of this movie. Martin Landau is a Hall of Fame Actor as is Edward Norton.

See this movie and you won't be disappointed!

The ups and downs of Matt's character's quest is a story that invariably binds the viewer to root for him.  I find myself replaying the scenes starting with ""I want a game"" through to the ending.  His games with John Malkovich's ""Teddy, KGB"" show the depths and the heights a dedicated player can reach.

1002336,4,6305240655,"You don't have to be a poker fan to appreciate Rounders, although it is one of the movies that seemingly put the game and ESPN's coverage of it on the map. I watched this movie years ago when it first came out, and thought it was one of those hidden great films of the 90s. For some reason the scenes with John Malkovich as the Russian mafia poker player stuck with me, although there is much more to the film.

In the film,  Mike (Matt Damon) experiences a conflict early on when his life-long friend, Worm (Ed Norton), gets out of jail. Worm, a bit of a loose cannon, is as much into gambling as Mike, and has accumulated a huge debt that he owes the Russian Mafia. This compels Mike to get back ""in the game"" of poker, gambling and high stakes. Mike, who is studying law with his girlfriend (Gretchen Mol), comes under scrutiny from her as his old ways surface. Although he is trying to drive straight and not pick up the game, there is a part of him that longs to get back to the excitement of it. Once he gets a taste of the game and the high stakes, it is hard to go back, and he and Worm dive full force into it. However, this puts a strain on his relationship with his girlfriend. While Mike loves the game, he is conflicted at many points. Worm's recklessness gets them into hot water with KGG (John Malkovich), and before he can truly choose between poker and his girlfriend, he is neck deep in trouble with his life. Rounders becomes as much of a movie about loyalty as poker, and Mike has to decide what price he puts on his friendship.

Damon and Norton drive home solid performances in this one. There's a good camaraderie between them, and they really do a great job of taking the audience into the world of Texas Hold em.

There's also an effective job of making the games suspenseful and dramatic. There's a great scene towards the end between Damon and Malkovich as they match wits. Damon's character also narrates the story as it unfolds.

Overall, Rounders is a great film with expert direction and acting.

Still, the movie is an excellent cross of mob movie and gambling lesson.  Matt Damon plays the greatest friend in the world to Edward Norton...until it gets him into the biggest debt with the worst person.  Then it's time to let the cards and the poker-faces do the settling.  Rounders gets better and better each time I watch it and if you're a fan of Poker (particularly Texas Hold 'Em) then you need to watch this movie.

And the end of the film is both a total illusion because you never really win in gambling because winning is only there to make you lose even more, and a fatal last move that announces the final descent into hell, a hell that is named Las Vegas. The only strange element, original element, is the Jewish dimension introduced by the judge who should have been a rabbi and couldn't because he could not see God. He actually lent money to that poor Mike knowing that Mike was going to gamble with it and was killing his dream of ever being anything noticeable in a court of justice apart from eventually being an accused or a convicted criminal. For a judge and a law student that is particularly sorry, sad and crude.

1002456,5,6305240655,"One of the biggest mistakes you can make when it comes to the movie ""Rounders"" is assume that if you have no interest in cards or poker, or don't even know how to play the game that you'll hate the movie or have no desire to want to see it.  When I first saw it a few years back, the only card game I knew how to play was blackjack, and yet there was something that really drew me in.  Something that clicked for me, and now it is one of my favorite movies.  One of those rare movies I could literally leave on all day.

Mike makes a living and supports his tuition by grinding it out every night at the poker tables.  The goal, he tells us, is to only win one big bet an hour.  Still, the dream for him is to make it to the World Series of Poker and face off with the pros.  That dream clouds his judgment when he faces off with a dangerous and no-nonsense taking Russian, Teddy KGB and leads him to lose every penny of his money.  After that night, he swears off cards for good and promises his girlfriend that he'll never play again.

Things get complicated when his buddy, Worm gets out of jail.  Worm is a card player who refuses to play ""straight up.""  He's what they call a ""mechanic,"" meaning he usually cheats when he plays.  He's got a serious debt to pay and feels the only way he can make the scratch is to play the game.  Mike wants to help him out, but he's made promises, but that slowly starts to deteriorate and he ends up being in the game again.  While it could very well be a blessing in disguise that Worm has gotten him back into the world of poker, the stakes couldn't be higher and he will end up putting the both of them into the worst kind of trouble.

What makes ""Rounders"" work are the characters and the actors.  You'll find a top-notch cast that includes Matt Damon, Edward Norton, John Turturro, John Malkovich and Martin Landau.  All are amazing in their roles and really bring their characters to life on the screen.  There will be times where you feel sorry for Norton's character and other times where you feel nothing but complete disgust and shame.  I think it's one of his best performances, and ""Mike"" sums it up best when he says that ""Worm"" knows how to play the part of the loser, because he does it to absolute perfection in this film.  The movie isn't about plot, or at least not a complex ones.  Sometimes, those are the kinds that work out the best so long as you have an all-star cast that can make it work.  Smart writing also is a gigantic help, and I'm happy to say that can be found in here as well.

Some cool extra features can be found on this version of the movie, like a behind the scenes featurette, a featurette about Professional Poker, a brief ""Head's Up"" game that's a nice little introductory to the game and some tips from the pros.  There are also two different commentary tracks.  The first one features the director, writers and Edward Norton; the second features pros Phil Hellmuth, Chris Ferguson, Johnny Chan and Chris ""Moneymaker.""  I really enjoyed listening to the commentary by the pros.  They're not there to really discuss the scenes or lighting, but more about poker itself and getting inside of some of the characters' heads during some of the games.

Do you have to know how to play poker to enjoy ""Rounders?""  Absolutely not.  Will it make you want to learn the game?  It's possible.  It happened to me.  Still, it doesn't matter if you end up wanting to play or not.  This is a solid movie with great performances all around.  It's no wonder that it is one of my favorites, and it is one that I will never get sick of.  Take a gamble and give it a shot.  -Michael Crane",1197763200,,3649,4.2821637426900585

No Law School for this young gamblerholic,despite constant pressure, both pro and con. He's young, he's aware of the dangers involved, and in the end he's taking 44 grand to Las Vegas to test himself against the pros out west, after nearly losing his life to Russian mobsters in New York. There's something to be said for risk taking at a young age, especially here where drugs and drinking seem not to be a problem.  He's doing what he wants to do, he's not tied down romantically, he's just approaching his prime, gamblerholics anonymous be damned; Matt's going for it while he still can.

1002507,4,6305240655,"ROUNDERS (1998), with an exceptionally well chosen cast (John

Turturro, Ed Norton, Matt Damon, Martin Landay, and John Malkvich) is

a movie that will appeal to those above 25 / 30, considering the

strong mental and rational aspects that the movie emphasizes, coupled

with other human aspects  that everyone will relate to, nonetheless.

If you believe that full stars should never be awarded to a story

that has a happy ending, (guy gets the girl and the money), then you

will understand how this movie is a remarkable achievement, yet not

the best I've seen, due to the Hollywood policy of avoiding tragic

endings, steering clear of despair, suffering from gambling

addiction or otherwise, due to entertainment reasons.

The acting is splendid and beyond reproach, from all actors, by

exposing the subculture of gambling as a hobby and as a social

networking and human release tool. It also exposes those players who,

naturally, take advantage and profit insidiously from the humanity

and compelling addition that exists in the weaker players at the

tables.

As such, the story is a somewhat of a microcosm of what goes on in

the financial markets, the greed and fear emotions that go back and

forth among the traders, the majority of whom lose as much as they

gain from the game, in the long run, not knowing when to stop or how

much is enough.

With a pleasing widescreen release, and sharp, professional

technique, and perfect transfer to DVD, the story underlines the

importance of one's reputation and ability to socially network to be

able to get a seat at the tables where the action occurs. It also

brings up the banking aspects, and loan sharks charging ""juice"", and

of  collectors who are called on to act on difficult debts, the

pariah mechanics, the special visual reading skills needed to be

successful in beating opponents.

Perhaps unnoticed, is the aspect of the movie, that contrasts and

compares the various protagonists character, who they really are,

their destinies, how they found their niche, by choosing settings at

peep shows, or libraries of wealthy reputable judges, lawyers, at

police officers messes, intermixed with convicts, gambling addicted

people of all kinds, including innocent tourists to Las Vegas, etc.

Catchy one-liner: ""It takes stones to  steer clear of trouble and the

wrong choices"" ... yet overall, the movie suggests to viewers that

those making no choices, stopped in the middle of the road of life,

still get run over.",1180051200,,2501,4.985401459854015

Cast:  Matt Damon, Edward Norton, John Malkovich, Gretchen Mol, John Turturro, Michael Rispoli, Famke Janssen, Ray Iannicelli, Merwin Goldsmith, Martin Landau.

Running Time:  121 minutes

Rated R for pervasive strong language, some sexuality and brief drug use.

While walking into an underground club, where the rich flounders swim, while the sharks circle for the kill, Mike McDermott (Matt Damon) sits down at a Texas Hold'em table with his gambling winnings from past games, $30,000. Across Mike sits Teddy KGB (John Malkovich), one of the top guys of the Russian mob, and one of the most feared players in the 'underground' games. Mike loses his entire bankroll and vows to his girlfriend Jo (Gretchen Mol) that he'll never play again.  Months later his lifetime friend Worm (Edward Norton) gets out of prison for scamming credit cards, yet the cocky, but confident Worm shrugs Mike's warnings about getting back into gambling and gets him to play in a game that very night.  Mike is a law student and his grades begin to slip as well as his relationship with his girlfriend ever since Worm's release. His professor Abe Petrovsky (Martin Landau) is concerned with Mr. McDermott, and his absences in his class. Abe tells Mike 'to follow your heart.' Worm is out playing in games and getting into debt with the wrong people. Mike finds out and tries to help his friend. Worm is other places getting further in debt, and he's getting his friend in debt. Mike is stuck with the debt of his former friend. He goes back to his professor, where the professor lends Mike the money to pay off the debt.  Knowing that he can beat the game of Hold'em, Mike goes to the place where this all started, and sits down with KGB. He plays the mad Russian, but will he win this time, will KGB force Mike for all his chips, or will he triumph and buy a seat at the World Series of Poker?

The biggest problem with ""Rounders"" is that it tries to create a multi-faceted story where there really is nothing but poker playing as a plot. The audience is supposed to contemplate the bonds of friendship, the struggle in relationships, etc., but these plot lines are so weak in favor of the poker playing that the film would have been better off had these elements not been introduced at all. Instead, there are many plot holes and a couple of moments where the audience will be left saying ""so what?"".  The poker scenes were indeed very interesting and well done; they probably should have been either expanded on or toned down a bit in favor of stronger and more clearly defined conflict lines in terms of the supporting story.  Having said that, the acting in ""Rounders"" is quite good - Matt Damon was, well he was ""Matt Damon"" and Edward Norton, who is always good, was solid as the degenerate hustler. The greatest acting, however unsurprising as it is at this point, was the small but effective role of KGB, played by Malkovich.  He is virtually unrecognizable beneath baggy clothes and a big beard, and his accent, though I'm not an authority, was flawless. Malkovich is best in his small, quirky roles, and this was absolutely no exception. His acting was the high point of the film, despite the fact that he was on screen for perhaps fifteen minutes total.  ""Rounders"" is not a bad film because of its flaws, but unfortunately its one-dimensionality makes it only a decent film and while it isn't a great film, it is an entertaining one.",1137456000,,3447,4.693200663349917
1002613,3,6305240655,"I really expected to like this movie based on both my admiration for pretty much everyone in the cast (did you all catch the guy from ER?) and the fact that I like to play poker.  But while it is not a terrible movie, I think it missed the mark by quite a bit.

First, the opening scene where the Matt Damon character loses all his money seemed pretty unbelievable to me.  I'm not a particularly good poker player, but I certainly would not have made that mistake with that much money on the table.  He should have known he didn't have the ""nuts"", ie. the best possible hand.

Then there is his bizarre friendship with the guy played by Ed Norton.  It does not seem fathomable that these two would speak on the street much less be best friends.  The Damon guy is so clean cut he squeaks and the other guy is a complete dirtball.  This mismatch seems even less tenable after the Norton character keeps screwing the Damon character over.  How much would someone tolerate from a jerk like that?

And the Malkovich character is just pretty unbelievable as well.  I hate it when they make actors do fake accents; why not just hire a Russian for God's sake?  I guess it's just to be able to market his name.

In summary, while interesting this was disappointing.  I think it could have been so much better.",1131840000,3,1300,4.384937238493724
1002614,5,6305240655,"Simply put, this movie is a masterpiece.  Lacking any ""action"" scene, no romantics, and no silly comedy, which are all favorites in today's movie world, the movie is absolutly compelling.  Matt Damon plays a young law student with a love of poker.  He starts the movie with 30,000 dollars and takes it all to an underground game in an attempt to get enough to make a run at Las Vegas.  After winning around 15,000 throughout the night in one moment he loses everything to russian card shark KGB, played brilliantly by John Malcovich.  He then promises his girlfriend he will never play cards again, which he firmly beleives will be true.  His long time buddy ""Worm"" (Edward Norton Jr.) is then let out of jail and quickly gets Damon back into cards.  Damon's girlfriend finds out and leaves him, and now with nothing stopping Damon he and Worm get back into there poker groove.  Worm owes many people money, and he cheats in almost every aspect of his life, including poker.  He gets Damon into countless terrible situations, which Damon must use his wit to get out of.  Norton's performance is the best of the movie, his portrayal of a scum-bag cheater who constantly puts the only friend he has in danger makes you hate him.  Which is a true testiment of Norton's acting.  The movie uses poker as a metaphor for life, as when DAmon's character thinks to himself ""you can shear a sheep many times but skin him only once"".

The characters are real and although I've seen all of the actors in better roles, you always have the sense that they're not all that they are portraying themselves to be (not showing all of their cards... yes I had to say it ;) to the audience.

You need no knowledge of poker, to enjoy this movie, you don't even have to feel for poker at any level than the games a person played with their parents.  A portrayl of following your dreams at the cost of anything.  Is what lies beneath the story.  ""What Choice,"" the proffessor (Martin Landau) asks Mike(Matt Damnon).  That right there was basically the pillar of the story.  What choice does a person have when they are faced with what they want to do and what is expected of them.  Can they ever conform?  Or do they have to do what they want?  These are the inner questions.

The interesting parts are the poker games as well.  Now I'm young, not old enough to go to a casino, and yet two months, after researching poker, using many things that are shown in the movie, I probably spent a hundred, hundred ten on the books, and got back two three hundred dollars playing a bunch of kids for their lunch money.  Like (Damon says) ""The goal is to get one big pot every hour.""  Those small interesting lessons, work great for real play.

1002660,5,6305240655,"Rounders is absolutely one of my all-time favorite movies. Granted, it has many setbacks like a pathetic attempt at being Russian by Malkovic, as well as far-fetched card-reading.

As a poker player, I understand that it is possible for pros to pick up on your cards, however Matt sat in on a single hand, and you cannot conclude from the turn what is being held by 5 different people. You'd have to watch the flop, turn, and river and gauge all of their reactions.

Second, when Matt Damon pulls his boat, 9's over aces, he hastily makes the assumption that Malkovic doesn't have a flush, and declares his thoughts. I doubt a poker player would miss the possibility of full aces over 9's and open himself up by declaring he nor his opponent has a flush. Of course, it could have been a slip of the mind, which does happen in poker just like anything else.

Other than that, the movie was written very cleverly especially considering it hung on a plot involving cardplaying. These writers are very skilled, and they made a very interesting movie to watch.

1002661,5,6305240655,"I have watched this movie several times in the last few years, and have been playing Texas Hold'em for a similar amount of time. When this special edition came out, I knew I had to check it out; and I was not disappointed, since besides the great movie, it includes a nice collection of extras.

Mike (Damon) is a grinder that plays poker as if it was a job. He has used his skills to pay his way through law school by gambling day after day without falling outside the boundaries of his method. But now something clicked and he is making a run for it. He goes to the underground club of Teddy KGB (Malkovich), a man highly connected with the Russian mob, carrying along all his savings and trading them for three stacks of high society ($30,000) to try to pave his way to Vegas.

It seems that the advice of a friend will save him from his fate when Joey Knish (Turturro) tries to dissuade him from going for it, but Mike disregards the advice and takes his chances. When Mike doesn't follow his cardinal rule (title of this review), Teddy KGB busts him for all his money. Now he is so disappointed that he decides to quit the game, takes up a job working Joey's truck and promises his girlfriend not to gamble anymore. When Worm (Norton) an old friend from school comes out of jail, Mike is tempted to go for it again. The fact that Worm is a cheat and owes money to influential people just complicates things.

This movie presents an interesting tour of the world of gambling, and if you are interested in poker you will certainly like it. You will also get the chance to see several pros in action, in a few scenes of the movie and in the extras. For those that watch poker on TV and see the glamour surrounding it, you will also get to see a more real depiction of what a professional player that is not on the top goes through.

In terms of the acting, the cast does a great job. Edward Norton is outstanding in the role of Worm, the light-headed trickster who has a history of messing up and who will not stop before getting Mike back into the action. Matt Damon plays his lead role with conviction, and the research he did on poker helps convey his confidence to the viewer. In terms of the supporting cast, Turturro and Malkovich are praiseworthy, so much so that I have always wanted to have the same poise at the poker table that Malkovich, when portraying Teddy KGB, shows in the beginning of the movie.

As I mentioned, the main plus of this new edition is the DVD extras. First, you get an interactive game of Hold'em in which you have to determine whether the correct option is to call, raise or fold, and a tutorial for those who need help learning the game. If you are new to poker this will be interesting, but if you are an average player or above you will probably get bored by it very fast. The behind the scenes feature takes a look at the world of poker, and how the creators decided to go with a movie on this subject. I liked the care they took in researching the topic and showing believable hands in the film, as well as in using specific poker terms. There is also a segment with professional poker players commenting on what the game is, and hammering home the notion that on the long run poker is not a game of luck. The Champion Poker Tips with Johnny Chan, Chris ""Jesus"" Ferguson, Phil Hellmuth and Chris Moneymaker are insightful, but do not focus on specific hands, but on overall strategy instead. Finally, you get the chance of watching the movie with two different sets of commentators, either with the four pros just mentioned or with the director and screenwriters.

As you probably figured out by this point, this is a must have DVD. It has everything a good production should have, a great film, interesting extras, and outstanding image and sound quality. Trust me, you cannot go wrong with this one!",1117411200,2,3842,4.404225352112676

This movie can arguably be held responsible for starting the recent Texas Hold em' craze that's sweeping the world at the moment.  I know it got me into Poker, when before I was just your regular house player.

  As for this particular DVD, it's not too much of an improvement on the original DVD.  It has a few goodies added on there like the audio commentaries.  One commentary has a few pros doing the talking, and while this is interesting, you can't help but get a little annoyed with some of Phil Hellmuth's comments.

  The added in Texas Hold em' game too is also a joke.  I beat the computer on the 2nd try.  Not very challanging.

  All in all though, this movie is always going to be a 5 star in my book, and while they could have done more in my opinion for a SE, anyone that doesn't already own it should buy it.

The main feature remains the same, so if you are in the same situation as I was, you'll be paying for the extra features.  In short, the extras certainly make it worthwhile to own this edition, whether or not you own the original.

1. If you play poker already, ""Heads Up Texas Hold 'Em"" won't help you.  (I bet you suspected that already.)
2. The two bonus features, ""Behind-The-Scenes Special"" and ""Inside Professional Poker"", are short at 5'20"" and 5'40"" respectively.  The former is a little disappointing; it appears that the cast and the staff simply talk about the movie retrospectively after the production.  In other words, it looks and feels like an afterthought.  The latter is a little more satisfying; it gives some well-known (to regular poker players) principles of poker.  The soundtracks are very annoying.
3. Champion Poker Tips gives a few sound-bite tips from Johnny Chan, Chris ""Jesus"" Ferguson, Phil Hellmuth, and Chris Moneymaker.  Again, if you play poker already, there is nothing new here.
4. Now, these professional players are featured in the extra commentary.  Mr. Whear characterized this commentary as ""odd,"" but I thought this was the best part of this Collector's Edition.  The comments they make are sometimes off the wall, but it just adds to the charm (to me, anyway).  They analyze the hand Mike McD loses to Teddy KGB at the beginning of the movie, and also the showdown at the end; their analysis is good, and they explain how (and why) things will be quite different in the real life.  Also, the commentary shows the characters of these pros.  Hellmuth is usually the motor mouth; Chan is the happy guy, but complains about how fat he appears in the film; Moneymaker seems a little reserved around the others; Ferguson is pretty quiet, but when he speaks he is brilliant (he even cracks a joke).
5. Staff's commentary gives some insight into the production of the film, including the real-world model of Teddy KGB (it turns out he is Eddie KGB in real life).  This commentary is also good.

What was on the original DVD edition that is missing on this edition is the theatrical trailer.  You might wonder why I bring this up.  Well, the trailer contains a couple of scenes that didn't make the cut.  I'm sure these could have been added as deleted scenes, too.

Matt Damon's superb acting draws excitement, and brings forth a natural love for his character, Mike. On the flip side Edward Norton's character, Worm, only brings out a distinct annoyance for his choices, and ultimately him.

All sides of gambling are shown in Rounders, the high points of winning, and the lowest moments, when its not just money involved.  The constant risk and intensity of it all keeps viewers on edge throughout the entire movie.

No matter how hard Mike fights, he can't bring himself to leave gambling behind to start a new path toward law school.  Along with a lesson on gambling, Rounders also offers a lesson in life; sometimes no matter how hard we try to change, our lives are destined one way or another.

Rounders was well thought out, and very entertaining. Whether you're a gambler or know nothing of the game, you won't be disappointed.",1102204800,2,1107,4.861702127659575
1002666,4,6305240655,"I used to go to Las Vegas about once a year, that was until I found out I wasn't very good at gambling...and even when I did win, I had trouble knowing when to quit, and usually ended up giving whatever I gained back plus some.  The trick is to only take what you could afford to lose, and stay away from the ATM machines.  I guess I was what people would have called a `recreational' gambler, but there are those who do it for a living, and even manage to prosper...I guess Kenny Rogers said it best in his song The Gambler, ""You got to know when to hold them, and know when to fold them...""  Rounders (1998), directed by John Dahl, who later did the enjoyable thriller Joy Ride (2001), stars Matt `Babyface' Damon (The Bourne Identity) and the extremely talented Edward Norton (American History X).  Also appearing in the film is John Turturro (O Brother, Where Art Thou?), Gretchen Mol (The Thirteenth Floor), Famke Janssen (Goldeneye), Martin Landau (Ed Wood), and John Malkovich (Shadow of the Vampire).

First, lemme get a couple of terms out of the way.  A `rounder', from what I gathered from the film, is a person who sees all the angles and makes a living playing cards.  A `grinder' is a rounder, but is a cautious player, interested only in playing it safe, avoiding the big risks and possible big rewards, always satisfied in being able to make enough to live reasonably well.  Damon plays Mike McDermott, a law student who earns his living playing cards.  As the film begins, we see Mike entering into a high-stakes game, and losing everything in one hand.  After his devastating loss, he swears off cards for good, until he's lured back into the game by his best friend Lester `Worm' Murphy (Norton) who was just released from prison and needs to make a lot of cash quick to pay off a large debt he owes to a rather nasty underworld mob, one that kept growing while he was in the stir (that's street lingo for jail, for those not in the know...actually, I'm pretty unhip, but I manage to pick up a few things here or there in an effort to sound cooler than I actually am).  Now the boys are fighting the clock, chasing games to earn enough to pay off those who seem not so interested in collecting but more in putting a serious hurt on Worm (he really has the tendency to get under one's skin).

I thought Damon did very well as Mike, an ex-rounder now eeking out a living by driving a delivery truck, trying to get through law school with his girlfriend (Mol).  With the reappearance of his childhood friend Worm, he finds himself dragged back into the life (although he didn't seem to fight it too hard), and ultimately has to sacrifice much to extricate himself and his friend from the ever-deepening hole created by Worm as he borrows money off his friend's good reputation.  I also really enjoyed Norton's portrayal of Worm, a shady, smart-mouthed scammer constantly looking for the edge (usually involving cheating) chasing the short term gains, trying to stay one step ahead of his troubles.  I usually enjoy seeing Edward Norton in films as I get the feeling he's putting forth more than most, driven by a seemingly innate desire to deliver the best possible performance he can, all while making it seem so darn natural (although his role in 2003's The Italian Job seemed a bit light...I guess it's unfair to expect perfection every time at bat) .  My favorite character was that of Teddy KGB, played by John Malkovich, a highly connected Russian mobster and owner and proprietor of an underworld poker den.  His Russian accent is reason alone to see this film...""Paeeey thet maeen his moneeeey"".  While I did like all the performances and I thought all the actors were solid, I felt like Martin Landau's character of Mike's somewhat philosophical law school professor a little contrived as he seemed only there to point out a facet of Mike's character that I felt was already detailed in a more subtle manner within the film.  I really didn't need his sage advice to learn what was already apparent, and I didn't think Mike did either.  That's my only minor issue with this film.  The dialog was excellent and snapped, utilizing all kinds of interesting colloquialisms common to the poker world, explaining meanings to the viewer enough to allow us to stay with the characters, but not treating us like we're complete idiots.  The film is lengthy (121 minutes), but does move along at a good pace, rarely losing my interest.

The widescreen anamorphic print on this collector's edition DVD looks immaculate, and the audio sounds clear in Dolby Digital 5.1 sound.  There are two commentary tracks available, one featuring director John Dahl, screenwriters David Levien & Brian Kopplman and actor Edward Norton and a second featuring actual professional poker players.  The commentary with the professionals seems a little odd, as they mainly comment on only the scenes involving poker, so there's a good deal of `dead air'.  Other special features include a tutorial on how to play Texas Hold `Em, the poker game played throughout the film, along with allowing the viewer to play in an actual game.  This was fun, but since it didn't keep track of winnings, it grew old quickly, but did serve as a good instructional aid to better understand the game played in the film.  There's two featurettes, one being a behind the scenes and the other titled `Professional Poker', which looks at real-life poker, with interviews from professional players.  Next there's Champion Poker Tips which is a bunch of short, unconnected clips featuring pros mostly doling out advice I could get from my mother, ""Never bet more than you can afford to lose""...thanks...Finally there's a couple of trailers and a Miramax 25th anniversary promotional bit.

1002667,4,6305240655,"This movie has the most poker content of any movie.  And the poker

content is realistic, unlike many other popular poker movies.  It

mainly portrays New York's underground card rooms but also poker in

a casino and in home games.  It also shows the ugly side of losing and

the fun of winning.

The story is a good one, though Hollywood, and stands on its own.  It

gives the viewer enough to think about for life, not just at the card

table.  The main draw however (other than poker) is the acting.

Edward Norton especially does a great job in creating an antihero who

is likable but in the end is someone to avoid.

I highly recommend the movie.  Be warned that the language has plenty

of profanity and poker terms unfamiliar to most.",1099958400,3,742,4.417910447761194

The acting and poker play is superb in this movie and very life-like.  It all starts with Matt Damon and his problems with the evil KGB. KGB is so funny in this movie. Especially when he sprinkles all the chips on the table and eats the oreo cookies. HAHAHAHAHA! Ah good times. Anyways I personally believe this was Matt Damons best acting job in a film and I cried when he did not win an oscar and was not even put up for one.

He has to start playing again when his best friend Worm gets out jail and is in quite a bit of debt. This was a tremendous movie i would recommend to any poker fan out there or anyone for that matter. It includes great acting and the poker seens are great. The story is realistic and superb.

1002713,4,6305240655,"It took me several years to see ""Rounders"" and when it was over I was surprised at how the movies I have seen in that period affected my perception of what was going on.  After seeing movies like ""Matchstick Men"" and ""Memento"" I could not help but be wary of what is going on in this one.  But I was really overthinking what was going on in this one.  Fortunately, that did not ruin the movie or take away from the pretty good performances turned in by the cast.

Mike McDermott (Matt Damon) is paying for law school by playing poker.  Having put together a stake of $30,000 he goes up against Teddy KGB (John Malkovich), the best poker player in the Russian-American mob and loses it all on the big hand he has been waiting for all night.  His confidence shattered, and his girlfriend (Gretchen Mol) insisting he give up on his evil ways, Mike know has to work on the grave shift to keep his head above water, but the dean of the law school (Martin Landau) thinks he has a future as a lawyer.  But his friend Worm (Edward Norton) gets out of prison and Mike is there to meet him at the gates.  It seems Worm took the rap when they were younger, which is why I was suspicious that maybe Worm was looking for some payback.

  But the problem is just that Mike and Worm represent two completely different schools of thought when it comes to playing poker.  Worm is simply out to hustle: find a mark and take them for everything they are worth, even if it means that the losers are going to be so unhappy they beat you up.  Mike wants to play the game well: his dream is to go to Las Vegas to play against the best people in the world and beat them.  Unfortunately, Mike feels he has to save Worm, who may really be stupid rather than self-destructive, but that does really make much difference when it is now Mike that is getting beaten up as well.

We have every reason to believe that Mike is a very good poker player, especially after he stops by at a game where his professors are playing and pretty much reads their tells with his eyes closed.  The problem is that Mike is not playing for himself but rather to save Worm, and he is the last one to figure out that this is a losing proposition.  But there is a third school of poker here, represented by the epitome of the Rounder, Joey Knish (John Turturro), who has been grounding out a living playing poker cautiously for over a decade.  He would never dream of playing for high stakes and going for the big score.  Yet Mike's thoughts keep coming back to just that.

Overall, director John Dahl's film (written by David Levien and Brian Koppelman), is a study in contrasting characters.  Until he is finally cut lose Norton's Worm is a manic counterpart to the intelligent restraint of Damon's Mike.  The strength of Mike's character is revealed when he is bottoming out and he does not lose it in the way that so many people do in these types of movies.  For me ""Rounders"" could have ended a scene earlier than it did, but the film decides to double down, making it perfectly clear where it is coming down on the question of gambling.  I know there are those who see Mike as being a compulsive gambler, but I do not buy the interpretation.  While there are those who think this movie should be the gambling version of ""Days of Wine and Roses"" what we are getting here is more along the lines of ""Rocky.""

Pretty much everybody in the United States today understands Texas Hold Em, at least as well as their favorite celebrities, so following the poker is not a problem.  Certainly ""Rounders"" endorses playing the game, or, more to the point, playing the game the way Mike wants to play it.  Unless you object to the morality of the message you should be able to ante up and enjoy this one.",1095897600,,3746,4.351079136690648

Matt Damon plays a law student who - sort of like his character in ""Good Will Hunting"" - can figure out the hand of everyone at the table using some kind of mathematical or intuitive genius.

However, he can't seem to figure out that his relationship with Ed Norton, his old best buddy who has just been released from jail, will be the end of him. The two get involved in the seedy dark side of big-stakes, late night, semi-illegal poker, while Ed runs up huge debts to a seriously bad guy that Matt becomes obligated to pay off.

The tension builds as Matt tries to gamble his way to a significant stake, so he can fulfill his long-time dream of going to Vegas to play with the pros.

The acting is good, the story is captivating and the poker is fun. And I am addicted to ""Celebrity Poker Showdown"" because of this movie!",1094083200,3,1039,4.34020618556701

For those who do not know how to play poker, Matt Damon's struggle to be something he's not will enthrall you. The only problem that I have with this movie is how annoying Edward Norton's character can be. Every 5 minutes he does something wrong and then apologizes, i feel like grabbing him and saying, why don't u stop apologizing and just stop being an idiot.

Matt Damon plays a law student who is also a rabid poker player; he has not neatly reconciled both pursuits.  He has an aimless, dissolute friend, played by Edward Norton, who is not as good a card player, but never found something else to do in life; as a result, he haunts the seediest joints and gets himself into lots of trouble.  His worst nightmare comes about when he incurs a huge debt to a Russian mobster called Teddy KGB (played by John Malkovich).  At that point, it's up to the Damon character to step in and play one high stake poker game that will determine the fate of his friend's life (and his own life).

The movie is pretty intense and gives you a lot of detail about poker.  Both Damon and Norton acquit themselves decently, while Malkovich is hilarious as Teddy KGB.  I don't know if it was intentional or not, but his Russian accent is terrible; as such, Mr. KGB comes across as less sinister than he actually is.",1091923200,,1200,4.502304147465438

He gets a job with another friend rounder Knish(Turturro) and it looks like Mikes done.
After Mike's best friend Lester ""Worm""(Norton) gets out of jail he wants to get Mike back into poker. He can't believe he reformed for a girl or that he's working for Knish. Worm is a con artist who is skilled at pokere but takes to many chances. Mike has his back and nobody says anythig. He gets Mike back into the game and it starts to threaten his relationship with Jo. Mike gets some advice from Judge Petrovsky(Landua) who urges Mike to get back into the game because it's who he is.
Mike gets back into rounding and gets right back to his old winning ways. What he didn't know is that since Worm had been out he'd been running up debts and using Mike as a fall back. They now owe a huge debt to the one man they can't run from and the man who beat Mike..Teddy KGB. Mike must now win back the money to pay KGB or it could be the end of him.
Matt Damon is awesome in this movie. This guy makes slik moives. Oceans 11 and The Bourne Identity were slike movies. This moive is just at slik as those two. Damon is believable and you just love watching this guy act. He puts out the best performance in the movie and this is one of his better movies.

Rounders is a good movie. I wish they would have cleaned the language up so it could have been PG-13, but then it wouldn't have been authentic saying it takes place in an underground world.

I could tell the movie was creating an insurgance of new players to the game.  Years later you can play Hold'Em at nearly any table in any casino and say something like 'weaddy ageasieev' and get at least a couple chuckles.

Mikey cant resist the draw of poker and ends up back in the frey of the Rounders again realizing that life is a grind without his true love of poker.
Damon portrays the main character brilliantly and Norton was so convincing that I actually felt angry at him for fouling everything all up.  Malkovich invents his own odd version of the Russian accent while pulling off the role of Teddy that is completely unforgettable.  There's also a great cameo by the 3 time World Series of Poker champion Jonny Chan.

From hiding large amounts of cash all over the house to the dark smokey poker rooms hidden away in a basement to ring games at the casino.  Amassing large fortunes and getting broke again then back in the same day.  The life of gambling is one of extremes, danger and euphoria.  People get drawn into it and like a drug become addicted, a small handful end up conquering it and carving out a life for themselves.

You get into the gritty urban environment so far that you'll want to take a shower after the credits. The screenwriting, direction, editing and music are all worth noting. But the big payoff with this poker flick is the supporting cast. When you get actors the calibre of John Malkovich, John Turturro and Martin Landau to stop by for secondary roles, you've got a shot at greatness. This movie is very good because director John Dahl kept the lighting, the grime and the pace constant, allowing this cast to deliver some beautiful work. Malkovich's performance alone as the cookie-munching Russian cardroom owner is worth the price of admission. Cudos to Matt Damon for pulling off the lead amid all this greatness and doing a meticulous job with the narration. Edward Norton is so twitchy and perpetually strung-out looking in this film that it may permanently damage your bias toward the actor.

This movie delivers everything you could want: incredible acting, a great plot device in poker, outstanding, smart dialouge, and suspense.  Easily Damon's best work since Good Will Hunting, and Norton shines in the supporting role.  A very under-rated movie, in my opinion.
The DVD, however, lacks special features that would have been a great addition (commentary, perhaps a feature on the poker circuit, etc.)",1068422400,,475,5.2105263157894735

In terms of the DVD you're thinking about buying (why else read this page?), the image is presented in 1.85:1 widescreen and overall is pretty great.  Colors are vivid and the picture is sharp and detailed.  The sound is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 and, while not a spectaular action epic with extreme use of surrounds, this soundtrack presents the dilolgue clearly.
Bonus supplements?  Just the trailer.

Determined that he can double his life savings, he sets off to play against the owner of an underground card club - Teddy KGB ( John Malkovich). Unfortunately, he ends up losing it all. In order to keep his relationship going with his girlfriend Jo ( Gretchen Mol), he swears off cards from then on out, and concentrates on only becoming a lawyer. But when his lifelong best friend and card shark Worm ( Edward Norton) is released from prison, he is soon back at the tables...
""Rounders"" blew me away because of the amazing insight into the world of poker and its players. One would think that a movie focusing on the game of poker would be boring. However, the film's director John Dahl, brilliantly works in a first person narrative from Matt Damon pointing out the intricate parts of the game. This causes the card games that are played in this film to be highly suspenseful. Brian Koppelman and David Leven provide the brilliant screenplay that accurately entails what gambling can do to your life, and the tough choices that one can be faced with. The relationship between Matt Damon and Gretchen Mol illustrates this beautifully because of all the lies, excuses, and false promises that are shown throughout the film. The rest of the cast is filled with amazing actors like Martin Landau, Edward Norton, John Tuturro, and John Malkovich.
"" Rounders"" offers a great look into the world of poker, a realistic look at gambling addiction, incredible actors, and a fast paced suspenseful story. The only part that suffers is the DVD, because of the lack of extras. I would have loved to have seen a behind the scenes look into the actors, poker, etc. So make sure you purchase the VHS version.",1062288000,4,1783,4.699680511182109

I like this movie because you get sucked into the mentality of Mike's character and right off the bat.  I'm not one for gambling films, but this is only partly about that. It's more about taking responsibility for the life you live, or should live.  Aside from the comical Teddy KGB accent, I found the movie a joy to experience and one where you pick up something new with each viewing.

This movie was never boring for me, was filmed in just the right amount of time, and did maintain an extreme air of authenticity throughout. Then again, I'm no card shark, so I would have no idea if even half the jargon used in the film was real anyway
the film did manage to show us everything you ever wanted to know about the game of poker and more (I don't remember seeing a better poker movie in my life, but then again, I don't remember seeing many poker movies in my life.), and a greater insight into the mind of an addict (Any type of addict, if you really think about it.) and the price one could pay for extreme loyalty.

Matt Damon and Edward Norton prove that in this film. The core of the plot, a man conflicted by what he should do versus what he wants to do, is clearly shown in this film. As always it takes a catalyst to drive you on the path you were meant to go. Brilliant film. Flashback sequences actually make sense in this film. I can only say that I am a fan of poker, by no means an expert, and this film got me really thinking about the motives of some of my opponents. If you read my profile you'll know that my background is in futures trading.

1002855,2,6305240655,"Okay, let's get a couple of things straight first: Ed Norton is a great actor. He's impossible not to watch when on screen whether here with Matt Damon, or elsewhere with types such as Brad Pitt, or Richard Gere or anywhere. On the other hand, Matt Damon, is little more than a big smile. Gretchen Mol is a non-entity. John Malkovich...?!?! (What has happened to this guy...can't anyone direct him anymore?...okay, okay, he was good as himself in BEING JOHN MALKOVICH.) And Martin Landau has turned out to be quite a treasure in his old age. His huge features exude so much life experience, world-weariness but opened heartedness. The scene where he gives Damon $10,000 is one of the best in the film.

The film...there's the rub. On one hand, it feels like it wants to be a gritty, grimy expose of the toll gambling takes, the price of friendship, the toll of clawing your way from a miserable childhood into a decent adulthood, whatever. Heck, the opening scenes almost feel like they could be set in the depression, all brown-tones and sweaty walls, with an old-fashioned voice over from Damon.

On the other hand, the film is just a cliche film, following the rules of any ""sports"" film about underdogs winning against all odds. Norton's character ends up being written in one dimension. He smiles, acts goofy but charming, gets some money, cheats at poker, gets caught (maybe beat up), loses money, is told by all around him that he won't get anymore money, but gets it anyway. Why in the hell does Damon stick with this guy? Again, and again, and again? He causes him to drop his vow to stay away from Poker, causes him to lose his girl and causes him to get the poop beat out of him and to end up owing a lot of bad people a lot of money. It was never convincing.

Gretchen Mol's character is unconvincing as well. It's tough to tell what she will or won't forgive in Damon. And all the stuff about law school is completely unbelievable.

The poker scenes seem to imply that any really good player will always have a good hand. They always seem to be battling full houses against four of a kind. In reality, aren't most poker hands lousy? A pair of eights against a pair of fours, maybe?

The scenes where all the pro players get together and chat, or play poker in Atlantic City, are kinda fun. But in general, this movie seems to want to be a crowd-pleasing sports movie and a gritty slice-of-life movie. In the end, it isn't quite either.

Matt Damon belongs in no more movies. He has no gravitas, and now his smile is getting old.

[UPDATE from May 7, 2010:  Since several years have gone by from the time this review has posted, I am HAPPY to report that Matt Damon has by-and-large greatly improved as an actor.  Age & life experience (and practice)have vastly improved him.  He's able to poke gentle fun at himself in films such as OCEAN'S ELEVEN and can actually pull off ""action hero"" a la BOURNE IDENTITY.  And he can really command a film like THE INFORMANT.  I still stick by my reaction to ROUNDERS...but I was happily wrong about his potential to contribute to films.]",1042934400,8,3089,4.526032315978456
1002856,5,6305240655,"Rounders is such a fun and exciting movie to watch.  This is a very under-rated movie!  I'm probably biased because I happen to enjoy poker very much, and this movie is definitely a poker player's movie.  The story and plot are very interesting, but the stars really steal the show here.  Matt Damon plays a smart poker player who struggles with the choice of living the ""gamblers life"" which is where his heart and skill reside, or trying to be a ""normal"" person with a normal job.  Edward Norton plays his weasely friend who is always finding trouble and needs Matt Damon to bail him out.  The real star of the show is the owner of a poker club played brilliantly by John Malkovich.  He plays a principal role in the movie as the driving force behind a fight for the main characters life vis a vis the poker table.  You will not regret watching this movie.  The only downside is that some of the moves made by Matt Damon are somewhat foolishly believed to be super suave, and might actually be terrible in real life poker.",1037923200,8,1024,4.433155080213904
1002857,4,6305240655,"A little-known fact of gambling is that there are many who make their living exclusively at it; of those people, the majority are poker players.  The deck itself is neutral, no matter how biased it may seem on any one hand or evening of play, and thus the players with greater skill take down the money.  It's not about cheating, which ultimately costs the serious player too much money to risk; it's about knowing the game and knowing the players.  The drama in this movie comes from watching a side of life most of us can only wonder about - gambling for a living.
Despite the cheap shot above in the editorial review, adequate character development does take place.  For each of the major turning points in the film, a believable underpinning exists in the film's action, e.g. Gretchen Mol's character leaves Matt Damon's character because she feels his skill at poker may not overcome what most reasonable people would call a compulsion to play.  Ultimately, the intrapersonal relationships take a supporting role for Damon's character, as his narration indicates his underlying aptitude and commitment to the game of poker; it would make as much sense to belittle ""The Hustler"" for focusing so much on billiards.
The scenes where cards are played show great attention to game details, where other films show little accuracy or care [most egregious example: ""Maverick,"" where the royal flush in spades beats a smaller straight flush in hearts and four nines].  It's not holding tremendous hands, but watching Damon put moves on other players and responding to theirs in kind.  Watching him slow-play the strongest hand after setting up John Malkovich's character to make an aggressive move at the pot...this is poker at its most engrossing.
Every performance sells this film - especially Damon and John Malkovich, no matter how outlandish his Russian-tinged English may seem at times.  It makes a perfect gift for poker players, and stands up as entertainment for those unacquainted with the game.",1037664000,2,2001,5.006024096385542

1002859,3,6305240655,"Redefining the gambling movie wasn't what 'Rounders' really had in mind so it would be unwise to view it from this perspective.  The plot has Damon as an ex gambling addict who is forced to jump off the wagon when old friend Worm (Norton) gets out of jail and needs to clear a few debts.  So the plot's obvious, but at least the movie manages to enjoy itself when the two friends are conning tourists out of money in Las Vegas or beating Russian heavies at their own game.  This being the case it seems a shame that we're burdened with the obligatory girlfriend who asks Damon to choose between gambling or her.
Yet the film's main trump card is its stellar cast.  Damon plays it equal parts old pro and wet-behind-the-ears college kid, Malkovich manages to inject some humour into the proceedings and of course Edward Norton, living up to his claim as actor of his generation, is uniformally excellent as usual, stealing the show again despite having only a supporting role.  Even so the pedestrian plotting and lack of true excitement ensure that 'Rounders' rarely rises above average.  To be fair, maybe I'd have thought the movie was better if I had any idea about gambling,  but it remains something that isn't too special.  Yet maybe it's a real credit to Norton's acting ability that I saw the movie purely because he was in it.",1033257600,,1335,4.60337552742616

That's where it starts and the action never quits. Rounders is  a high-brow suspense flick a la 'Oceans 11' and 'Spanish Prisoner.' I say suspenseful because the plot (amply explained in the reviews below) is so forward moving your head will spin. My adjective of choice is high-brow because, taking us into the underworld of high-stakes poker, this film offers us the dazzling combo of razor-sharp intellegence and quick-changing fortunes.
The script is full of 'shop talk' (top two pair on the flop, taking a pot off a hump, etc) that although unintimidating to the uninitiated like myself, will either entrance or annoy you. The acting was great and in a movie like this that is a feat. The actors (especially Damon and Norton) really make us believe  that they are rounders to whom 'taking a pot off a hump' is a completely natural occurance. That's got to be challenging! Especially if you've seen little or none of Edward Norton's acting, you have to check this out.
If you like ganster films or other high-brow suspense films (Usual Suspects, Boiler Room) you will truly thrill to this. If you get lost by tech-jargon and subtle plot nuances, this film might drive you crazy!",1018915200,,1301,4.829596412556054
1002918,5,6305240655,"""Rounders"" is an intelligent movie, being more subtle than gratuitous or violent.  It follows the trials and travails of a young law student, Michael McDermott, who 'rounds', gambles, for a living and to pay for law school. He loses his whole payroll one night, and decides to quit rounding. Nine months later he is sucked back into the world of rounding when his mischievous and altogether slimy friend Lester 'Worm' Murphy gets out of prison.
The story is very much about finding one's place in the world, as Michael must decide between rounding and the law for his career, and must wrestle with his own fear and doubts about his chosen profession. It also provides a very fun look at the world of gambling and a sort of quirky philosophy that Michael follows. And I learned a couple new ways to play poker!

1002921,3,6305240655,"Rounders: rated R, 1 hour and 54 minutes
 In the movie Rounders, Matt Damon plays the cleverly skillful cardsharp, Mike McDermott. Edward Norton plays his best friend and swindling partner. McDermott swears to his loving girlfriend that he will never again play a game of cards after losing (thousands of dollars) to a Russian mobster known only as KGB. When &#8220;Worm&#8221; (Norton) is released from prison, he finds himself greatly in debt to the Mafia. In order to help out his buddy, Mike begins to gather up money by continuing to gamble. He and Worm work together as a team, winning poker games illegally. As soon as Mike's sweetheart finds out about him going back to cards, she leaves him without delay. The rest of the movie is the trouble Mike and Worm get into in the business of gambling, and the excitement of success.
 Rounders displays exceptional acting by the Damon and Norton duo. The background acting done by Gretchen Mol (the girlfriend), and John Malkovich (KGB), on the other hand was somewhat displeasing. Mol played the average good girl with no real feeling adequately expressed in her performance. Malkovich surprisingly ended up playing the role of a seemingly idiotic underworld leader with a poor attempt at portraying a Russian accent. His pathetic depiction of the character KGB did not fit in at all well with the remarkable acting by Edward Norton and Matt Damon.
 Acting is not all that made this movie what it is. The thrill of the game was also a major part in making the movie enjoyable. Matt Damon does a good job of running the audience through the basics in how to play a good game of cards. He explains that one must play his opponent rather than the cards in order to win. By looking at the eyes of his competitors, interestingly enough, he is able to read their minds and determine his game winning strategy. Mike McDermott insists that poker is not at all a matter of luck, but that it is a matter of skill. A skill in which of course he fully possesses. Mike McDermott is clearly a poker playing genius. He accurately integrates everyday speech with sharp gambler's lingo. Though it is often hard to grasp many of the things Damon says, by using this lingo, it somehow holds the viewer's interest anyway.
 Edward Norton's character (and fantastic portrayal) truly sustains the greatest element of intensity, and though intriguing at moments, when all is said and done, the audience comes away with little more than a cheap, dramatized look at playing poker with high stakes.",1004400000,,2523,4.779816513761468

Here is my complaint, This movie is outstanding; why is the DVD so bad. The sound is half as good as it should be and there are no special features to be found. What makes a quality DVD is not just the movie(we know thats great) but the extras you get with it. You expect great sound, picture and addtional information about the movie when you pick up the DVD.

""Rounders"" is more interesting when examined from the perspective of Matt Damon's character, who has two balls in the air and can only catch one. He must choose between his ""legitimate"" life as a hard working law student with a good relationship, or his ""underground"" life as a Rounder. He is geniunely torn by his loyalty to all his girlfriend and his friend Murphy (aka Worm, played by talented Ed Norton).

Matt Damon heads an attractive and stimulating cast as a proletarian poker player and struggling law student who has been at the highs and lows of the grind and holds the clandestine key to a player's most valuable strategies. However, his knowledge comes with a hefty price - $30,000. Before Mike McDermott (Damon) walks out the door after looting his own apartment for stacks of cash in the beginning of the movie, we hear a voiceover of him saying bluntly: 'Listen, if you can't spot the sucker in your first half hour at the table, then YOU ARE the sucker.' Mike should heed his own advice a little better, as we see from what is about to transpire. He arrives at a basement complex shrouded in secrecy and regulated by Teddy KGB (Malkovich), a card shark with a yen for Oreo cookies and ties to the Russian mob. It is here that he takes a seat for a couple of hours at the 'Mad Russian's' table and walks away completely penniless, not to mention utterly aghast that he has lost every bit of his college tuition. Not only is he immediately disciplined about controlling his gambling itch, but he also replaces his poker salary with an honest minimum wage job driving a delivery truck for veteran rounder Joey Knish (Turturro).
Time passes and we see that Mike and his girlfriend Jo (Mol) are getting by reasonably in their airy city apartment. An old friend of Mike' s named Worm (Norton) has just finished serving time in an upstate penitentiary. As soon as Worm hops into Mike's Jeep on the day of his release, he is dazzling him with his tricks and trade, cajoling his friend back into the grind. He hounds him about getting reacquainted with the four suits and later in the evening, they make a pit stop at a fraternity house to play cards with some swaggering pledges - Mike's fever promptly returns. What Worm doesn't bother to tell Mike is that he is acutely in debt to higher powers, one of them a weasel named Grama (Rispoli). Grama negotiates with KGB and his cohorts, buying Worm's debt and consolidating it to a mammoth I.O.U. It is at this point that Mike finds himself caught in the sling with Worm and the only way out is to do what he knows best - the restless routine of a rounder.
Matt Damon is entertaining as the cocksure Mike McDermott, a man with few inhibitions and a lust for Vegas' lights and luxury. Edward Norton fits his character to a tee, and it's easy to see why the name 'Worm' is such an appropriate soubriquet. Norton's accustomed to playing sardonic reprobates (American History X) and calls his character 'a philosophical cheat', adding his own touches (including the tattoo of an Ace on his forearm). As Worm, he is equally scornful (minus the rigid political agenda) and a lot of fun to watch. Funny to think that Damon and Norton finally came tete-a-tete - both of them auditioned for the same roles for 'The People Vs. Larry Flynt' in 1996 and 'The Rainmaker' the following year. Damon prevailed as Rudy Baylor and Norton completed arrested the role of Alan Isaacman, each of them wisely cast. Here they make a splendid team, each dusting off the other when it suits and rarely competing with the other's screen time.
Gretchen Mol barely has anything to do here except look upset every time Mike breaks his promise. John Turturro plays his Joey Knish with suave subtlety and John Malkovich is a travesty as the Russian mobster Teddy KGB - his Slavic accent is so off the mark that it's embarrassing. Martin Landau is always a pleasure to watch and makes quite an impression as Abe Petrovsky, an astute college professor. He fashions himself as a sort of father figure to Mike, offering a piece of his wide medley of wisdom when it requires. Famke Janssen is merely an ornament for scenery, but an attractive one at the least. Michael Rispoli has been cast many times over in smaller and insignificant roles but finally gets a little more light shed on him as the loathed Grama. Director John Dahl and screenwriters Brian Koppelman and David Levien researched their story well, frequenting poker clubs in New York themselves and in accompaniment with Damon and Norton. Even two-time World Series Poker Champion Johnny Chan is impressed with the film's authenticity, making a brief cameo as himself.
'Rounders' has a lot to offer, not only for its talented cast but also for its intriguing presentation of a game few people comprehend and many underestimate. It will definitely leave a twinkle in the eyes of those who harbor dreams of holding Vegas' gambling scene in the palm of their hand.",996105600,,4582,4.658024691358024
1002943,5,6305240655,"I saw all the reviews up talking about how a poker player couldn't relate, then had to throw in my two cents.

As a 21 year old female that's never gambled or even thought about gambling, they would have you believe I would have no clue what this movie was about or what direction it was taking - wrong.

This movie isn't just for the experienced poker, although I'd imagine they would enjoy it a great deal more than the average joe like myself. From the reviews, I suppose I'm wrong. Personally, I was entertained completely & sad to see the movie end.

Ya see, this story isn't just about poker, it's also about a friendship between two men, one of which isn't always doing the best that he can for the relationship. If ya've ever had one of ""those"" friends that was always messing up, so ya had to bail 'em out..you'll relate to, & more than likely enjoy, this movie.

From a non-poker player - one of Matt Damon & Edward Norton's films to date. Everyone can relate some way to the film & I'm sure everyone can enjoy. This is a classic storyline & a wonderful film - it's my all time favorite film.",993772800,4,1102,4.309178743961352

1002945,5,6305240655,"Let's put this first:Rounders is a movie about poker..But it doesn't mean that those who are not into this game,won't understand it or like it...
Mike (Damon)is a young law student who is also a master poker player..When he loses all of his savings in a game against the poker expert Russian KGB (Malkovich),he thinks he has played his final hand and promises his girlfriend that he will never sit on a game again. Then his long time friend ""Worm"" (Edward Norton) gets out of prison and Worm is in big trouble with many guys waiting for his release,because he owes a serious amount to them and the creditors' list goes all the way up to KGB..From then on,it's the dilemma of Mike between his promise to his girlfriend,his education as a law student vs. his loyalty to his friend and his great passion for the game of poker.
I should begin by saying that all of the actors involved (maybe except Gretchen Mol who plays Mike's girlfriend) did a wonderful job. Matt Damon is great as the young poker whiz,we can really feel the state of mind he is in during the whole movie,and is also the narrator. His narration is the best bit of the movie in my opinion. Although it seems that it is always about poker,from the first moment you sense that poker is chosen as a metaphor to tell us about life and how we approoach it.
The script is brilliantly written. Altough I didn't know a thing about poker (and especially about Texas Hold'em),there hasn't been a thing I missed thanks to the narration of Mike and the perfection of the storytelling.
Many people have criticized Malkovich's portayal of the Russian card shark but I think that the final re-match between him and Mike was one of the funniest parts among all the movies I have seen. And Edward Norton should also be mentioned because I think he does a great job as the Worm. He made me hate him for all the problems he put Mike in,and that is the sign of an actor doing his job at best.
The DVD lacks extras and that is my biggest complaint..The deleted scenes I have seen from the trailer should have been added.
This is not a blockbuster and it doesn't have any action scenes. It's all about poker but poker is about life in Rounders. I strongly recommend it even if you don't know anything about this card game who is not about luck.

1002946,3,6305240655,"A bit tedious for those that are not real poker players or fans, but enjoyable.  There has been lots of criticism here of Malkovich's Russian accent - though he made the film for me - he's such a character!  I don't think the issue is whether his accent is accurate.  The issue is whether it's effective - and it is.  It came off as an accent of an uneducated, slightly learning disabled, poker-savant, creep...in short, a Malkovich character. He and Norton made the movie enjoyable for me.",977875200,3,490,4.597701149425287

He portrays a man who is addicted to the game of poker, but because of his girl-friend and life, has given it up.  Not until an old friend gets out of prison, Edward Norton, does he get sucked back into the old world that he had forgotten.  The movie is dark and gritty, offering the idea of what these people's lives were really about.  I, myself am not a real poker player, but this movie really made me want to get out a deck of cards and call a few friends.  Definately worth a watch.",977443200,,655,4.0703125
1002948,4,6305240655,"The chips, that is.
As poker movies go, this is actually pretty good.  It is the only movie about poker that is authentic both technically and psychologically.  The only real competition is the Cincinnati Kid (1965); however that film is greatly marred by the improbability of Steve McQueen being dealt a royal flush in five-card stud to win the key hand.  The odds against being dealt a royal on any given hand are 649,739 to 1.  Multiply that by the odds against getting it just when you need it, and we are in Fantasyland.  Part of the power of the script comes from the technical help of Mike Caro and other professional poker players.  I know the triptych themes of (1) buddy for buddy (until it becomes ridiculous-as Matt Damon was for Ed Norton), and (2) honestly among poker players, and (3) The Game and male-bonding before women (as when Damon gives up the very fetching Gretchen Mol for cards and ""feeling alive"") are macho poker-guy bonding themes espoused by Mike Caro and others in the profession.
Matt Damon is very winning in the starring role, and Norton is properly despicable as one of life's losers, and John Malkovich is riveting as Teddy KGB in spite of what some might say about his accent.
The fact that the players play Hold'em, which is the most widely-played game in the poker clubs and the Vegas casinos today, and the one played for the world championship, lends to the overall authenticity of the film.  Again, this contrasts with the Cincinnati Kid where five-card stud was played.  However, even in 1965 that game was seldom if ever spread in most clubs, the dominate games at the time being low-ball, draw, and seven-card stud.  Five-card stud is too simplistic for the modern player.
Much of the plot of Rounders is familiar and could be (and has been) wrapped around other themes and sleazy backdrops.  The ending, which I will skip here, is however original as far as I know, and psychologically true, just ask any rounder.  The key bit of authenticity that I think Director John Dahl and company got exactly right is that it takes courage and a devil-may-care sort of aggressiveness to win at high-stakes poker, and Mike McDermott had that.
Incidentally, the derivation of the word ""rounder"" is unclear as far as I know.  It was used  in England two hundred years ago to refer to a vagabond.  It appeared in the clubs in Gardena, California at least as early as the 1960's to identify a regular player who went from club to club looking for a game he could beat.  The term has sticking power because the chips really are round and roll from player to player, just as the fortunes of the rounders fluctuate from day to day as they make their rounds from club to club.",975974400,19,2703,4.625523012552302

I later learned how to play poker and love it just as much or more.  You don't have to be a poker player to love it!  You might have to watch it more than once to get the gist, but you'll want to anyway!  Edward Nortan is easily my favorite actor- see this movie then check out his others!

1002950,4,6305240655,"Okay, there are plenty of movies out there about gamblers and there's probably nothing new or exciting about this one.  However, what makes this one different is that it doesn't drammatise or over-emphasise the card  games, whereby either the only hands that ever get dealt are always Royal  Flush or Full Houses, or that the players seem to possess some unrealistic  magical skills to get them.
The movie is about how a law school student  Mike (Matt Damon), who is also a professional card player, struggles to  lead a ""normal"" life after his old friend Worm (Edward Norton) is  released from the prison and kept bringing him more troubles to resolve  (using his card-playing skills, naturally).  Insights into the games  demonstrate superbly how the real world of card players may not be as fun  and glamorous as you may think (even when you win).  Instead the suspense  and excitment in the games are created from (backed by Damon's voiceover)  how each player control his emotion and at the same time analyse his  opponents' tactics, in an attempt to lead them into his traps.
Of course,  the movie is more than just about card games.  Mike's desperate attempt to  avoid going back to the tables and keeping his relationship with his  girlfriend Jo (Gretchen Mol) is also well-plotted.  This contributes  greatly in showing that even a professional card player has to handle all  the difficult situations in everyday life and not just the cards.
If  there is anything to nag about this movie, it would be the relationship  between Mike and Jo, which could do with a touch more details to give a  more in-depth view of their bond and hence Mike's struggle to stay on path.  Other than that, this movie is highly recommended to anyone who's looking  for a gambling movie with a dfference.",963878400,,1791,4.786885245901639

But it's Two  Movies in one the Games Work everything else is Hit&Miss.,963014400,,359,4.966666666666667
1002952,4,6305240655,"There are two types of people watching Rounders: those who play poker and those who don't. If you can identify in any way with Matt Damon in this movie, it's going to captivate you. If you're not a card player... you can probably forget it.

Mike McDermott (Damon) is a professional poker  player and a law school student, in that order. One night, in an attempt to  raise the capital for a trip to Las vegas to play in the World Series of  Poker, McDermott loses his whole bankroll, $30K, to the owner of his  favorite underground card club, Teddy KGB (John Malkovich). The next day,  he swears off cards, but we get the feeling he does so in order to keep his  relationship with Jo (Gretchen Mol) alive. His resolve is shaken, and  quickly detroyed, when his best friend growing up, Worm (Edward Norton), is  released from prison, and McDermott soon finds himself back at the table.

This movie succeeds on a number of levels, and surprisingly so. Of  course, many of those levels have to do with cards, and if (as I said)  you're not enchanted, or at least obsessed, with the non-luck aspects of  any game of chance, it'll probably bore you stiff. But even if you're only  a weekend (or rarer) player at the card table, the horse track, or the  stock market, you'd do well to listen to Damon's voiceovers throughout the  movie, which have loads of excellent information (and mirror things I've  been telling novice horseplayers for years).

Other than that, the  insights into relationships, and the ways obsession can destroy them, are  profound. Well, okay, maybe not profound, but handled with gobs more  subtlety and wit than I've seen in just about forever. Mol isn't really  onstage long enough to give her any real chemistry with Damon, but take it  from me, the ways they react to one another throughout the film are dead  on. More importantly, both to the plot and to the success of the movie, is  the relationship between McDermott and Worm. Edward Norton proves once  again he's one of Hollywood's true rising talents, and the deeper  motivations that drive his character are exposed just well enough that we  can see them. Not an easy task, and one sure to be uncovered if the actor  doesn't understand those motivatins and the viewer does.

The other  main aspect of the film is the suspense during the actual card games.  Another thing that's not easy to pull off, and often (most recently in the  Gibson/Foster remake of Maverick) the director resorts to insane,  next-to-impossible combinations of cards to make it work. (Remember the  final game in Maverick?) In the first scene, when Teddy KGB nails  McDermott, the winning hand is a full house. Welcome to the real world of  poker, where oftentimes it's the guy holding the two pair that ends up  forty grand richer at the end of the night. Dahl realizes, repeatedly, that  it's not the cards in the hand that provide the action, it's the way the  characters react to one another. One almost thinks that Dahl could have  pulled this movie off by putting Damon, Norton, Malkovich (without the  cheesy accent), John Turturro, and two or three of the other cardplayers  around a table and shot two hours of one game.",961286400,117,3185,4.6835443037974684
1002984,3,6305240655,""" Vant Cookie?""  John Malkovich as Teddy KGB
What is a Rounder? According to Johnny Chan, World Poker Champion, a Rounder is a hustler.
The truth is that although Mike McDermott (Matt Damon) is a law  student in the powerhouse center of the New York legal community, his true  passion is Cards. Despite the fact Poker has been paying for his education,  the thrill of chance and the duplicity of the game is what keeps McDermott  coming back for more. Playing with best of the best means going up against  Teddy KGB (John Malkovich), an Oreo Cookie addict and merciless Czar of  Gotham's  Russian underworld.
Between financial difficulties and trying  to beat his gambling fixation, McDermott develops a thorn in his side when  his friend Worm (Ed Norton) gets out of jail. Worm also has an appetite for  ""the game"" and a very poor sense of judgement for cause and  effect. When McDermott discovers Worm owes a hefty gambling debt to Teddy  KGB, the two are stretched to the limit to find avenues out of their  predicament. Since McDermott has somewhat of a sense of responsibility, he  is able to consult with some of his fellow mentors. Professor Petrovsky  (Martin Landau) the wise and sympathetic veteran of the law, not only has a  special fatherly tie with McDermott, but in a firebrand speech, gives him  the courage to attack the issues which each of us face at the crossroads  our calling in life.  After settling all debts, McDermott fulfills  Petrovsky's prophecy about following one's decree, when in an astonishing  and bold ending, he remains a rounder with the most grandiose of  intentions.  This picture is a journey in the art of  carefully  constructed deception and uninhibited plunges into the face of  danger.
The characters in this film are unquestionably unique and  multi-faceted. Worm is uncontrollable and on a fast road to  self-destruction. And so it is that he abruptly drops out of the picture  and we never see what happens to him. A factor I found rather disappointing  considering the fact he was one of the central metaphors of McDermott's  dichotomy of life.  Jo, portrayed by Gretchen Moll in a slightly  downplayed role, is McDermott's other half, but even more important, she is  his conscience and the best thing he could ever hope for  in an honest love  as well as the voice of the straight and narrow.
John Turturro, although  not having much screen time, is Joey Knish, another one of McDermott's  shifty-eyed cohorts although he is more of a blister than a deep cut.
John Malkovich is as usual a chameleon in his representation of an  incontestably original character, composed of  black humor and serene  ruthlessness. Although I will say that at times, his attempt at a  Russian  accent lacks Stoli.
Rounders is a story about balancing on a ledge and  hoping the wrong wind doesn't blow.  Rather than luck, the name of this  game is destiny.",959040000,4,2888,4.811860940695296
1002985,5,6305240655,"You can't buck your own nature.  That's at the core of this film.  Matt Damon's character is trying to lead a 'model' existence.  Become a lawyer, have a traditional relationship, go to college...  The list goes on and  on.
Unfortunately, in that regard, he's a card shark. Poker to be more  exact.  And like so many of us he has had a setback which forces him to  question his ability, goals, and direction.  But while making the effort to  go a different way or play it straight he is brought back to himself by an  old friend (Edward Norton aka Worm) who doesn't try to be anything other  than what he is.

Real-life card players of any merit rarely have an option of law  school (as the Matt Damon character does), and they don't have Gretchen Mol  waiting at home for them, either. Of course authenticity is not necessarily  a requirement for a good film.
John Dahl does his best here with a weak  script, a distant premise, and what is obviously a hastily thrown together  star-vehicle for the hotter than hot Matt Damon.
John Malkovich is  brilliant  as KGB, the Russian card parlor manager, and Damon's nemesis. Ed  Norton does little with what little role he has as Damon's always in more  trouble than he's worth, accomplice. If you look quickly you'll catch  Melina Kanaredes.

1003030,5,6305240655,"Is gambling to the extreme a kind of pathological addiction?  Not necessarily, accoring to this excellent film.  Pros view it as a test of skill with higher and higher feats to accomplish, the ultimate here being  the world series of poker.
Great performanes by all, including the key  one by Matt Damon (despite the comment below) and, of course, John Torturo.  John Malkovich, not my favorite actor, does a super job here in  a role  suited to his acting style and typical screen personality.  KGB, the  Russian immigrant he plays, is truly ruthless.  Edward Norton is also  superb as the weak kneed poker player friend who refuses to stop being a  ""mechanic"" (a skilled cheat) even though he could risk great  personal injury as it does happen.
The two poker sequences with KGB at  the beginning and the end are masterpieces of suspense, acting, and  direction.  The love interest is thankfully down played.",937440000,,910,4.849673202614379
1003031,5,6305240655,"""Rounders"" is far from the first film I have bought without having seen it first, though certainly one of the few where my decision to do so was not based on it containing one or more of my favourite actors.  The risk paid off handsomely, as this film, revolving entirely round the  game of poker with which I am totally unfamiliar, was entertaining and even  gripping to the last. If I feel like going off to make something to eat  during a movie on video, then it has not held my attention despite my love  of film, and therefore is a failure. No chance here, my ignorance on the  subject matter was irrelevant as the film was not designed to go over my  head and the acting was compelling. I agree the characters were not well  fleshed out, but I still felt a degree of empathy which made me very  interested in the outcome, which again the film cleverly made less obvious  than you might expect. To the reviewer who said forget Matt Damon, either  this was jealousy or you were not concentrating, he made me care what  happened to him; a good choice, a nice surprise, buy it and you'll see why!",935971200,3,1098,4.354679802955665
1003032,4,6305240655,"With such a cast, containing Academy Award nominee Edward Norton, Academy award winner Matt Damon and the fabulous John Malkovich this movie had to be great, and it was.  It's amazing, actually, that the director manages to  keep us interested for 120 minutes, because let's face it; it's just poker,  right?  But there's more to it than that - it really portraits the gambler  in a very good way and lets the viewer share the excitement of ""high  stakes"".  One thing though is what happens to Worm (Norton) in the  end, that's the only thing I miss to make this a 5'er  And I thought poker  was just luck - I had it all wrong; see for yourself.",934329600,,645,4.389830508474576

It would be a confusing movie to those who may not understand the rules but that's where the great cast comes in and makes this movie for everybody.  Pick this up for a great watch.  P.S.
