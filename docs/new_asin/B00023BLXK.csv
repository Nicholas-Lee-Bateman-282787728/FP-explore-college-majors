2057067,5,B00023BLXK,"Set in the late 1950s against a lush Cuban backdrop, ""Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights"" follows the story of Katey, a young and socially awkward American who moves to Havana, which teeters on the edge of Castro's revolution. Amidst country clubs, pool-side cattiness from socialites, and adjusting to her new life, she meets Javier Suarez, a waiter with a passion for dancing and the sole responsibilty of providing for his large family. Immediately drawn to Javier and the world he represents, Katey persuades him to be her partner in the prestigious dance contest at the Palace Hotel. Soon, Katey visits the local club ""La Rosa Negra"" with him and experiences a side of life and herself that she has never seen before; stealing away day and night to explore both the city and the relationship that they begin to form. As their attraction builds and the contest nears, they both must overcome their fears to dance in the perfect sensual harmony, unknowing that a volcano of revolutionary violence on Havana's streets is about to erupt.
As the fresh-faced Katey, Romola Garai (previously seen in the British hit ""I Capture The Castle"") brings innocense to the screen, as well as a hindered sensuality that she must discover. As young Javier, Diego Luna (most memorable in ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"") is a new, smoldering presence in film, with the perfect mix of sex appeal and a frivolous, almost childlike appearance. Although their characters suffer through some awkwardness due to corny bits in the script, Garai and Luna have remarkable chemistry on film.
The backbone to this movie however, is the soundtrack and the dancing, both of which are truly spectacular. It is remarkable to note that neither Luna nor Garai had any dancing training before shooting, as their natural ease makes the choreography irresistable, sensual, and delicious to watch. The soundtrack, with sexy Cuban beats mixed with hip-hop from Wyclef Jean and Mya among others provide a toe-tapping setting, which enhances the experience for the audience.
Although some moments are cliched, corny lines are delivered, and the plot can be predictable, ""Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights"" offers so much, that those things can easily be overlooked. From the chemistry onscreen, to the amazing dancing and soundtrack, and the costumes and sets, it creates an entire world of sensuality and personality, that it will delight every moveigoer.",1077926400,6,2395,5.112244897959184
2057068,4,B00023BLXK,"17-year old Katey (Romola Garai) and her wealthy family have moved to Havana in 1958 and are living in a first-class hotel.  Katey accidentally causes a young Cuban waiter (Diego Luna) to lose his job; there is a mutual attraction, and they share a love of dancing.  They prepare for the big Latin dance contest, but Castro's revolution is about to change everything.

Diego Luna, who was so charming in Y Tu Mama Tambien, gets five stars from me.  Here he is sweet and very likeable, a terrific dancer, and oozes teenage appeal.  Co-star Romola Garai is fine, too, and the Cuban music and dance scenes are appropriately steamy.  The script and the photography earn three stars, however.  The story tries to balance youthful flirtation with the serious theme of political revolution.  Two movies could have been made, but one seems unconnected and somewhat shallow.  The whole movie was filmed in very dim lighting, even in sunlight, giving it a B-movie look.

But Havana Nights is a pleasant movie with an appealing star, and I recommend it to those who like Cuban music, dancing, and teen romance.",1077840000,59,1099,4.828877005347594

2057080,3,B00023BLXK,"This is definitely a low-budget film, and you have to want to see these actors or this story in order to appreciate it.  However, it has good, interesting actors including Romola  Garai, Mika Boorem, and a glimpse of January Jones.  John Slattery and Sela Ward play the parents.  The story takes place in Havana at the onset of Castro's revolution.  An American family has been transferred to Cuba, and their eldest daughter (Garai) becomes interested in a local youth who works at the fancy hotel where they stay.  He's a street/club dancer; her parents were competitive ballroom dancers.  There's going to be a big dance contest.  All pretty much what you'd expect.  It's fun if you're in the mood.  Swayze does a cameo.

NOTE:  ON PANTAYA, THIS MOVIE IS DUBBED IN SPANISH WITH NO SUBTITLES",1501977600,,792,4.785185185185185

Really fun movie with some history and politics (that are still relevant in 2017) mixed in.

Like I said - I rented the movie first - and then ended up buying a copy because I liked it so much.

Not really a sequel to the original Dirty Dancing - definitely holds its own.",1496016000,4,360,4.343283582089552

2057103,3,B00023BLXK,"**NO SPOILERS**
Having just finished watching Dirty Dancing for the first time, I wanted more of the dancing world with Patrick Swayze. I saw that this movie had a cameo, but a complete different setting. To be clear, I am fully aware that all dance movies have a similar plot line, and you can only get so new and inventive with dance plot lines. I did absolutely love the music in this movie, and I really enjoyed the Cuban dance that was incorporated into this movie. The acting is a bit sub-par, however you can only expect so much from a dance sequel. Some of the chemistry is a bit forced and the sub plot lines are lost within the main. There isn't much character development or backstory given for most of the characters. Overall, this is a movie I would have on in the background.",1472515200,,789,4.410958904109589

2057111,5,B00023BLXK,"Lovely movie, containing some great acting and a fun plot. The dancing is beautiful and the tried and true love story never gets old. Romola Garai and Diego Luna make a beautiful couple, both in dance, and in love. Both Dirty Dancing, and Dirty Dancing 2, Havana Nights, now hold a special place in my heart. When I discovered that there was a new dirty dancing, I was apprehensive, believing that no remake or sequel would ever be as good as the original, but after watching it, I have changed my mind. Others have criticized it, and even one of my friend's (who also loves Dirty Dancing,) said she was underwhelmed by the plot and dancing. While this could discourage some from watching this film, it just made me eager to see for myself. I was amazed, and continue to love the tried and true love story that this movie portrays so well.",1466726400,,839,4.490196078431373

2057132,5,B00023BLXK,"To be fair, don't compare this to the first Dirty Dancing movie. Obviously, they wanted to capitalize on the original title. This is based on real life events of JoAnn Jansen. I loved the dancing and the love story. You'd never know Diego Luna and Romola Garai were non-dancers and there was obvious chemistry between the two. What made this movie for me was charismatic Diego Luna who played the charming and sexy, young Javier Sarez (momma mia, who is this guy?) I enjoyed the video for the most part, although the story seemed choppy and disjointed. Parts left on the cutting room floor (as seen in the Special Bonus Features) would have helped fill out the story. It would have been satisfying to see the mean girls' mouths drop. Sela Ward was beautiful as ever; loved her wardrobe! Jonathan Jackson was a much more likable guy than the dweeby son in the first version of DD. The late great Patrick Swayze makes several appearances. Don't just watch the movie, check out the Special Features, well worth the time. At the end of the day, it made me want to dance like that, visit Cuba, and speak Spanish, su casa, mi casa I love this movie, what can I say, it makes me happy.

addendum: Diego Luna has moved up in the film world, winning awards and has helmed some very notable films. A name to watch.",1450051200,7,1304,4.5021097046413505

2057165,4,B00023BLXK,"The movie showed old morays as some kind of shocking new thing. Which I guess a radically politically correct-minded person today would take this movie as shocking in today's light. Since most Americans have never been to a third-world country, this is understandable. However, I personally found the storyline to be a little droll. The sets and costumes were very exciting however, and somewhat made up for the lack of story plotlines. The acting was good enough, but the script seemed politically motivated in some vague way. I really liked the old cars, they seemed to be more genuine than the portrayal of the bad guys. Getting out of jail by pretending to be Fidel Castro? Everyone knew what he looked like back then, and nobody would have been fooled by that garish imitation. That appeared to be a pretty lame attempt at creating conflict in an otherwise slow-moving part of the picture.",1443139200,,894,4.849673202614379
2057166,5,B00023BLXK,"I adore the original Dirty Dancing so much so I didn't put much stock into liking this one but I like how it's not a sequal, it's got dancing and it takes place in a time where the world was changing thats really it. I love the music to this one, I'm from the southwest so music from Latin culture is nothing new to me. But taking the Anglo-American ballroom dancing and adding the Latin moves to it was wonderful. I used to want to do the last dance from the original Dirty Dancing as my first dance as a married woman at my wedding (lol like about 100 other women i know) but something like this would really blow people away. Plus it looks so much more fun. Now I just have to find a cute Cuban guy who can dance like that lol. But really if you really liked Dirty Dancing then you'll like this but don't expect everything to match but I love how Patrick Swazey makes a cameo that was the cherry on the cake.",1442793600,2,911,4.094972067039106

2057179,2,B00023BLXK,The young man is not a love interest type  I'd pair with her. The dancing was not that good nor contest winning. The music was very good. Patrick most likely was sick at the time of filming...a great guy. Possibly a film for a younger audience.,1441670400,,244,4.304347826086956

2057187,2,B00023BLXK,For some reason it takes place chronologically before the first Dirty Dancing movie and with a different cast altogether. The plot is similar to the first. It is more of a remake then a sequel or prequel. The screenwriters just took a hatchet to the dialog of the first and made the 2nd. It Lacks the nostalgia of the first but still is somehow just as sentimental.,1441324800,,365,4.462686567164179

It's based on true events but story just seemed so forced. Not sure if it was the story line or acting that just didn't do it for me. Best part was Patrick Swayze's appearance in movie.

2057357,3,B00023BLXK,A long way from the original Dirty Dancing but never the less entertaining. Depicting a Pre-Castro Cuba was interesting but somewhat shallow. Very little about the underlying causes that sparked the revolution were presented in the film and yet the story line in the film centered around a forbidden relationship between an American girl and her Cuban boyfriend.,1437004800,,362,5.258620689655173

2057407,3,B00023BLXK,Not terrible but not great.  I feel like they tried to hard to recreate the magic of the original.  There were some obvious moments where they try to recreate scenes of the original that don't come off as homages but as cheese.  At least the setting and atmosphere is different but this is not a worthy followup.,1436054400,,312,4.43859649122807

2057433,4,B00023BLXK,"This movie is terribly miscast and the female lead is no Jennifer Grey, but the music is great and the dancing is really fun to watch.  Patrick Swayze has a small role but it doesn't really add to the film - he's not playing Johnny Castle or anything.  Really the movie is pretty bad all around as compared the the original Dirty Dancing, but I find myself really drawn to the Cuban club scenes.  I've seen it a bunch of times and try to ignore all the cheesy parts, and the fact that the male lead is physically dwarfed by the female lead, making their relationship pretty awkward.",1419638400,,582,4.37037037037037
2057444,3,B00023BLXK,"This prequel is a cheesy romance that takes place in Havana during the weeks before and days immediately following the overthrow of Batista in 1958.  The historical setting is interesting and I loved the music but the story line is one long series of clichs, many of which mirror the plot of the original Dirty Dancing.  Thankfully the film is illuminated by the angelic face and demonic dance moves of British actress Romola Garai in one of her earliest movie roles.  If you like her, or you love Salsa, or you agree with the apparent feminine consensus that Diego Luna is a stud-muffin, then you will probably enjoy this film (I did).  If you're looking for an original story or persuasive acting however, don't waste your time.  Patrick Swayze has a minor role as a dance instructor, otherwise there's no real connection to the original and IMO much better Dirty Dancing.",1419379200,,874,4.76158940397351

They have her life all planned out,  but  tension mounts with her mom and she. Her mom thinks she likes a another boy, whom is the son of his boss(James).  Katy is smart girl and is not afraid to show it and for this James(bosses son) likes he and asks her out to a gathering in a country club. she wears a daring and tight red dress. the other girls look on in shock and envy because she has James attention. the unattended teens decide to have a after party ,and needle Katy for being so proper ,and she said we are going to a local Club.  James to his credit plays along and they go, where she meets up with Havier a local waiter and he shows her how to dance and have fun the Cuban way, while James is talking politics with Havier's brothers . He then decides its time to go, annoyed at the fun and attention Katy is getting. When in the car he tries to force him self on her, saying ""you did not say no to him! "" She tells him no and he persists, ripping her dress and she runs back into the bar, Havier sees her ripped dress and wants to confont James, but instead she  is escorted home, and he gets fired for ""mingling""  She feels bad and sees a way to make it up and to enter a dance contest, grand prize is money and a going to USA, they get close as they practice and sneak around......

  This movie's dancing was a lot better than the original too.  While the original movie's dancing was perfect for that time period, Havana Nights dancing was more up beat and sensual which suits the movie.  Overall this movie was amazing, if you're a fan of the original you WILL LOVE THIS!!!
  P.S. Patrick Swayze's(man, I hope I spelled that right) screen time was a surprise but really added to the movie and made me love Havana Nights more!",1370390400,,701,4.507936507936508

another one of Hollywood's ""chopping off the classics"" because they're
running out of ideas. Was pleasantly surprised that this movie kept
my attention from beginning to end. Similar to the original,but totally
different story,setting,and characters-except Patrick Swayze (was even
more pleasantly surprised that he was the dance teacher :D)
Filming wasn't perfect,and something a little off with audio,unless
my computer's acting up again,which is more than likely,but I loved the
dancing,the romance,and the story. Definitely going on my list of

The music(latin flavor)and location is different from the first, as is the story line, but I was sold at the first dance routine. Music and dancing has a way of making peoples lives richer, that is what this movie showed, and that was my take away, just as in the original. Music and dancing is a universal expression of emotions and feelings that don't always translate well with words no matter what the language is!

2057653,5,B00023BLXK,"The two main characters in this movie are played by Diego Luna and Romola Garai. (Patrick Swayze also makes a few small appearances in this film as a middle-aged hotel dance instructor who winds up helping the young heroine work through her dancing fears in regards to letting her male partner ""lead"" her.)
Both Diego and Romola create very believable and engaging characters on-screen.
The plot is quite interesting, involving a bit more depth than the original Dirty Dancing movie of the late 80's. It is set in Havana, Cuba, near the end of the Cuban revolution to overthrow the then-current president, Batista, and to afterwards set Fidel Castro in the prominent position of leadership.
The male protagonist is a native Cuban pool boy, who comes from a very poor family, and is trying to support not just himself, but his whole family - including a young male child that one of his elder brother's ex-girlfriends dropped off prior to the time when the movie begins.
The female protagonist is a scholarly American girl, temporarily living in Havana with her mother, father, and younger sister, until she can finish the 2nd half of her senior year of high school, and then head back to the States for college.
In the beginning of the movie, the female lead is not pleased with having to move to Cuba because of her father's job promotion, but she very maturely apologizes in the first quarter of the film to her father for her initially surly attitude.
One of the commendable things regarding this movie is that the characters do not fall into completely stereotypical types. There is a refreshing element of un-expectability in how they do what they do, what they say, and their non-verbal expressions of what they think. The English actress Romola, in particular, is quite clearly skilled at her line of work. Any of the characters in this movie could have been portrayed by the actor or actress playing them in a cliched manner. However, I was very pleased that I rarely felt during the film that any of the scenes were at all cheesy. The movie was not perfect, by any means, but it was well-made, and the care and time put into its creation is evident.
I would definitely recommend this movie for someone wanting to watch any of these types of films: the romantic, teen, dancing, or feel-good variety.
If you are the sort of person who prefers watching movies along the more serious lines of ""The King's Speech,"" (starring Colin Firth), then this much more light-hearted film is probably not for you.
If, however, you want to view a positive movie purely for entertainment's sake, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend watching ""Dirty Dancing - Havana Nights.""
An interesting footnote I would like to add is that the plot was derived from one woman's real-life experiences in Cuba, which were similar to those of the character Katie in the film.
Another intriguing tid-bit is that the actor who plays the Cuban older brother is from a natively Cuban family, and truly grew up in Cuba through his pre-teen years until his family moved to Florida. The actor's father was actually present the night the revolution over-threw President Batista in favor Fidel Castro, which is the exact same evening that is re-portrayed in this movie.
All in all, I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this film, and by how many different aspects of it I found interesting or admired.  :)",1348272000,,3368,4.777015437392796

Now, for Havana Nights, I know the plot isn't very well written and the script has some pretty corny dialogue, but the dancing makes up for it big time. I love the sensual feel of this movie, and it could partly be because I'm Hispanic and LOVE the way Hispanic's dance.

She doesn't have much social experience, but she knows she likes this guy better than the son of her dad's boss. She signs up for a dance competition with the Cuban guy, and then comes a romance that you've probably seen in several movies before and after this one.

This was a pretty good movie with great dancing, and the story is nice as well. And though I like the music, it didn't really convince me it was from the 1950s. The songs in the background were much like the songs of today. I think the story writers wanted to set the film during the Cuban Revolution era so that it'll add to the drama, but they forgot to set everything else (i.e. the soundtrack) to the same time period. In any case, I didn't believe it was 1957. But it was a great film anyway!",1293062400,,920,4.2272727272727275

Schooled by her parents in the art of ballroom dancing, Katey is expected to join the smart set of American teenagers who are the Miller's neighbors at the exclusive Oceana Hotel.

It was a disappointment across the board, with just a couple of bright spots. The interaction between the girl and her father was touching. The acting by the two young stars was in character, but the script was not up to par and the rest of the actors were handicapped by the lines and situations they were required to deliver. It was shocking to see Patrick Swayze looking so old in this film. It didn't do him or the film justice. He would have been better off in a serious role rather than the bit player he was here.

The scriptwriter tried to do too many things in this film and as a consequence, accomplished none of them. The acting, the dancing, and the overall production were disappointing, to say the least. None of it was credible. I cannot understand anyone getting excited by this film, but that's just me and my tastes. The first ""Dirty Dancing"" film drew me in and caused me to care about the characters and what happened to them.

I think the actors did an amazing job despite the fact that the dialog was a bit corny.  The movie talks about two teenagers falling in love. This takes place in Havana Cuba in the 1950's right before the Cuban revolution.
The soundtrack in this movie truly ROCKS! All songs were very well selected and the actors danced amazingly. Javier (Diego Luna) and Katey (Romola Garai) shared unbelievable chemistry which made the movie more enjoyable. They performed the sexiest dance moves I have ever seen.

2057689,3,B00023BLXK,"I understand that Dirty Dancing movies aren't going to be exactly like Citizen Kain.  But when you think about the premise, the culture and classist clash of American vs. Cuban dancing, sexuality, and budding romance set during the backdrop of the Revolution, the movie sounds quite promising.  I mean, when I heard the premise I thought ""This movie was MADE for me,"" because it has Cuban history and politics, awesome dancing (or so I assumed it would, due to its predecessor,) and, come on, the main character has the same name as me.  But I should have realized then that a good premise does not necessarily lead to a good, or even adequate, execution.

I won't summarize the movie as so many others do; if you want a synopsis, look to their reviews.  I WILL point out what exactly I found so lacking about it, and why I do not feel it was that good of a movie, even when one considers that it's ultimately just a dance movie.  But again one must remember that it was their decision to involve politics in the movie, and in doing so they made themselves fair game--I do not believe in just using a deep political situation just to make a story line seem a little deeper; if it is not handled properly, it is insulting.

First off, the romance.  Diego Luna and Romola Garai had definite chemistry, and it is so disappointing when you realize that the movie did not capitalize upon this, and all you're going to see in addition to some very sexually charged dancing is a few hurried onscreen kisses and an implied sex scene.  Given their chemistry and the buildup of their relationship, their first kiss could have been so much better, instead of just snuck in during a dance routine--it was so quick I spent many minutes wondering if I had really seen it or not.  However, to me chemistry is not the only thing required in an on-screen relationship, and I have no idea to this minute why Javier and Katey fell in love with each other.  Katey's personality was developed in the movie sense (she likes classic literature, is a bookworm and rather progressive for her time) and Javier was clearly the ""will do anything for his family and feels that Cuba is in need of a change"" but I don't really know how those two fit together.  Aside from the sexual attraction component, I have no idea what exactly they saw in each other to make their relationship anything more than ""He was hot, she was pretty, and she felt sorry for him.""  Some might argue that Katey was merely attracted to the intensity and freedom of the Cuban lifestyle embodied by Javier, but I ask you: the movie was founded upon the idea of a romance, and what the heck kind of relationship is that?

I would also like to add that the Spanish conversations WITHOUT subtitles were incredibly rude to the audience.  I do speak Spanish, but I could not make much sense of the slurred words and to this day I am wondering what exactly Javier and his brother said to each other after the Revolution broke out.  Maybe they figured that the audience would not care (pfft, what are politics compared to SALSA DANCING,) but I cared.

And now, the historical components.  I will not get into the anachronisms--such as Katey's parents' attitude towards her staying nights with a boy they don't know, and that even Cuba in the 50's could not have been that unrestrained--as there are many who could do that better justice than I (apparently the style of dancing in the movie was unlike what was popular in Cuba at the time.)  After all, it is only a dance movie.  I can ignore that stuff.  But when the movie brings the history to ME I cannot ignore it, and I further dislike it when movie directors assume that their audience is completely ignorant of certain aspects of history and will just assume that ""Man, that Batista guy was a jerk; he didn't allow dancing.  Hopefully life will be better under this new regime!  Who'd they say it was, some guy by the name of Fidel Something-or-Another?"" (I am exaggerating; at least I hope that no one is that ignorant.)

And here we get to the backdrop of the story, Revolutionary Cuba.  First off, Batista's regime wasn't really shown to be that bad; aside from the story involving Javier's father, it might as well have been that town in Footloose (perhaps a little more violent.)  It was like Dictatorship Lite.  After Havana falls to Castro and co., the Cubans act happy (which is understandable) but things are otherwise pretty calm, which one cannot imagine is really likely in such a situation.

And then we get to the ending.  Katey asks Javier to come to America with her.  In a move which my sister has deemed the ""stupidest decision in a movie ever,"" Javier refuses, saying that he has to stay because of the Revolution, which he believes (or wants to believe, anyway) will improve life for him and his people, Batista killed his free-thinking father, viva la Revolucin, yadda yadda yadda.  I understand that movies don't always have happy endings, but I think that there is a middle ground between ""boy and girl live happily ever after"" to ""girl lives happily ever after and boy gets sent to the gulag after he finds out that Castro isn't exactly the nice guy he claims to be and wow, Batista was a cakewalk compared to this, and has to spend his years in a drawer cell where he would kick himself for his earlier decision if, you know, he could actually kick himself, but drawer cells don't allow that.""  I truly think that the filmmakers did not anticipate their audience to think this much, which is understandable, but come on--everyone knows that communist Cuba is no picnic, and when Katey says something along the lines of ""I know that we'll meet again,"" I couldn't help but thinking that the only way THAT would happen would be if Javier braves the Gulf and takes up Florida's wet feet dry feet policy.  In fact, when I told my friend about the ending he said, ""that boy is going to have to stop dancing and learn to convert his '57 Chevy into a boat.""

I understand that people at first thought that Castro was fantastic and he didn't reveal his true intentions until later, but the fact remains that Cuba was politically instable and to choose to stay there instead of going to America was still pretty questionable.  And then Katey's optimistic ""We'll see each other again someday!"" was just waaaay too much for me.

So, in short, if you're like me and you can't turn off your brain while watching a movie, this one's going to give you a lot of issues.  If you CAN turn off your brain and just enjoy it for what it is--a dance movie--you'll probably like it, though find some things (like the romance) lacking.",1164499200,5,6629,4.549663299663299

2057695,4,B00023BLXK,"Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights is a movie that uses music and dancing as a language to connect two young teenagers in the midst of a hectic time of adolescence. When young Katie moves with her family to Havana, Cuba, she is at first, very hesitant about the country. Katie is initially quite distant and refuses to take advantage of the country and its beautiful culture until she meets an amazing young man named Javier.

Javier is a young Cuban waiter who initially helps her find her way around. Javier becomes friends with her and later sees how she is intrigued by the style of dancing in Cuba. He then decides to help her learn the moves and the two's chemistry continues to build as their moves improve and are synchronized to the music. Javier is later fired from his job and desperately needs money to support his family. Luckily, a new Latin dance contest is going to be held with a decent amount of money offered as a prize. Katey decides to enter the contest with Javier in hope of winning the money and to help out her new love and his family. The movie takes a new twist when history is written when Castro's revolution interferes with the two love birds' plans and desires.

This movie is ultimately a great dance movie and is great for any person who loved the first Dirty Dancing or the art of dancing in general. The movie has a very sexy and sultry feel and although the ending seems abrupt, you'll want to watch it more than once! The actor, Diego Lunes, who plays Javier, has a smooth character whose moves are flawless and whose personality and humor keep all eyes on him. Katey, played by Romolo Garaj, is the typical teenage character that goes through some changes yet meeting Javier makes her reach self actualization and realize her passion for dancing.",1148774400,2,1778,4.570532915360501

Diego Luna and Romola Garai are fantastic, they dance really well together, everything fits in that area.  And the dancing in itself put together with the amazing soundrack just makes the whole experience highly enjoyable.

2057697,5,B00023BLXK,"Amazing Story based on real events that happened over fifty years  ago  during political chaos in Cuba has little connection to the Dirty Dancing masterpiece of the 1980s, except for the name and a certain extended cameo appearance by one of the original film's stars, that is.

HAVANA NIGHTS tells a  compelling story of a young girl forced to relocate to Cuba when her father gets a job over there and ends up meeting a local boy who teaches her how to tap into her spiritual side by self expression in the form of dancing. Her parents of course are portrayed as old fuddie duddies at first but eventually come to realise their daughter is old enough to choose what she wants out of life, and inevitably she and the boy fall in love.
Entering a dance competition,  the two  take to the floor and astound  just about everyone present.

But before  the young dancers are able to  fully  embrace the passion required for the moves in the contest, some necessary help is gained  by a certain dance instructor who will no doubt be very familiar to just about every female on the planet, and movie lovers everywhere.  Patrick Swayze appears for several scenes and provides rather memorable moments that really add to the overall enjoyment of the story, making this an amazing cinematic experiece that will take your breath away! Also his dance partner in the first scene at the dance studio is in reality the woman whose life this film is based on. This only makes this movie rate even higher for all the cleverness that comes out of it.

I got this DVD  this morning as a Christmas gift from my parents and just now finished it and sat down to write this review, so you know it is that good. Also of note is the song you hear at the end of the film when the young lovers have their last dance. It is called ""Hips Don't Lie"" and is by Shakira, and available on her most recent release.

Order HAVANA NIGHTS today and have a very  Merry Christmas!! I know I sure will!",1135468800,8,1963,4.43854748603352

2057699,3,B00023BLXK,"When ""Dirty Dancing"" became a huge sleeper smash in the summer of 1987 with the soundtrack still selling strong through the end of 1988, there was talk about a sequel and of course in addition to the ""Dirty Dancing Live"" tour and short-lived TV show, the phenomenon kind of died out. Thus, I was surprised to hear about ""Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights"" in 2004. Why did they wait so long? And is it a sequel, a prequel, a re-interpretation, or a whole movie on its own? Honestly, I think it did itself a disservice by having ""Dirty Dancing"" in the title. They were obviously trying to capitalize on the classic film, but the time to do that was closer to 1987, not 17 years later!

This movie takes place in 1958, on the eve of Cuba's revolution, and opens similarly to ""Dirty Dancing"". The protagonist is a girl on the cusp of adulthood, riding in the back of the car and musing on her interests in life. In the original, Baby was an idealistic daddy's girl who dreamed of joining the Peace Corps in Kennedy's optimistic age of 1963. The years are significant, because Patrick Swayze has an extended cameo sequence as a dance instructor. Is he Johnny or not from the original movie? Hard to say, as the credits at the end of the film don't name him as that character, and in this film he looks a lot older (obviously), yet he's supposed to be five years younger than when he was in the original. Confusing?

Well, taken as a completely separate film, it is entertaining with GREAT music. But purist for the Cuban music of the 1950s won't like it either, as it is definitely music blended from the traditions of Cuban style with the modern hip-hop rhythms that satisfy our feet. I love the music enough to buy the soundtrack, but as for watching the film over and over...I just didn't felt drawn in like the way ""Dirty Dancing"" did all those summers ago. That film had heart and was a surprise, under the radar discovery. This one, though based on the choreographer's life, seems to be attempting to cash in on the other's success, but it fails. Its proof that the magic some films have aren't easily transferrable to another. All the magical ingredients/elements have to be right, and this one simply fails to live up to the other. The smartest thing the producers could have done to promote the film was not use ""Dirty Dancing"" in the title. It might have done better in theaters. But then again, a film with a backdrop of the Cuban Revolution is a tough sell to American audiences anyway.

So, skip the film and buy the soundtrack. That's one thing you can play over and over without getting tired of.",1134432000,,2602,4.508474576271187

Lots of great dance music and great choreography in between.  Not a deep movie by any means, but definitely a fun one to watch and listen to.",1131062400,,408,4.704225352112676
2057702,2,B00023BLXK,"I have nothing against the film's premise itself.  Really.  Romola Galai and Diego Luna make a charming couple in 'Dirty Dancing - Havana Nights' and they are fun to watch.  The corny dialogues and forgettable supports from Sela Ward, Mika Boorem, Jonathan Jackson, John Slattery and January Jones can be forgiven.  Even unnecessary cameo of the star of the original is OK to me.  But, no, what is this?  86 minutes?

Again I say, I like the beautiful look of the film, but really hates the content which is too thin to make a feature film.  In other words, we need more romance and dancing.  However, the filmmakers foolishly -- yes, a strong word, but I insist --  foolishly inserted ""politics"" into the film which should be simple, unalloyed fun.

Yes, politics, for the film is set in 1958.  Havana is going to see a revolution and Castro, but Americans are enjoying themselves in hotels, for whom the local Cubans are working hard.  As if to stress the historical fact and social background, rich father of our uptight American girl Katey (Galai who in fact is an English) is working for one of the biggest motor companies, and her friend January Jones literally despises a Cuban youth Javier (Luna who is in fact a Mexican).

Someone please tell the producers that this kind of film doesn't need this complicated, politically conscious story.  All you need is an American girl who meets a boy in Cuba.  Period.  All you have to add is good music.  (Thankfully, the Cuban music here is irresitible, and it is always so.)

But for all good soundtrack, the dancing scenes are less than satisfactory.  The dance sequences themselves are pretty good (though obviously the leads need more lesson), they are too short, and the final chapter that should be the rousing finale is interrupted by ... yes, politics, or the revolution.  Even the fans of Diego Luna, who must have given this film positive reviews, would agree with me.  Why should we be reminded of Castro reperatedly when we need more dancing?

There are lots of films about dancing, and my favorite is Buz Luhrmann's 'Strictly Ballroom.'  Please see it, and then you know ehat I mean.",1127692800,,2146,4.722371967654986

After our introductions it moves past that to introduce the wonderful latin dancing.  The dancing in this movie really gives a great look on latin dancing.  I really enjoyed the fact that they introduced what was going on during 1958-1959 in cuba. If they would have left the politics out we as audiences would be lost as to what the fuss is all about with Katey being in love with a cuban, Javier and why the cubans were being prosecuted for doing their thing and being as free as the Americans.  The actor and actress did a great job at performing and truly looked in love throughout the movie.  I hope to see more of them.  Diego Luna was very hot in this movie and could really dance.  This movie was truly impressive and has inspired me to look into more about cuban history and latin dancing. I've started taking ballroom dancing because of this movie....

It's just a fun movie and you can really the chemistry between these two individuals.

It's not as good as the first.  I mean the first one was a classic, we all know that.  Usually nothing can beat the first movie, but this one is almost as good as it.  I really don't know why Patrick Swayze made an appearance?  I mean it was nice seeing him in it, but it just seemed pointless.

Romanticizing a failed revolution which continues to commit human rights violations against it's own people is really sad, even for a fantasy film.  Batista was bad but Castro has been way worse.  THE ENDING WAS TOTALLY DISHONEST IN A HISTORICAL SENSE, AS CASTRO'S REVOLUTION HAS DONE NOTHING BUT ENSLAVE, KILL & TORTURE THE CUBAN PEOPLE.  If you can set aside the dishonesty & illogical romanticizing of the failed revolution, the film is just ok.  The original Dirty Dancing was WAY BETTER.",1110931200,,583,4.838383838383838
2057713,4,B00023BLXK,"It's understandable that any follow-up to a cult classic such as ""Dirty Dancing"" will be ripped apart regardless of its actual performance.  That's because viewers step into the movie with a mindset of preconceived notions and expectations.  I must admit that I was one of those viewers, avoiding this film at all costs, until this past weekend.

That's when I entered the world of ""Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights"" and fell in love with what I saw.  I honestly feel as if this movie has some of the sexiest dance scenes I've seen, and the art direction is simply fabulous.  The costumes and hairstyling are also very well done.  Although mainstream American  audiences will not recognize most of the cast members, Diego Luna puts on an amazing act as Javier Suarez, an intelligent, enticing waiter at a Cuban resort.  Jonathan Jackson's performance as a slick badboy is a little unconvincing, but then again, many of the film's characters go underdeveloped.

Nonetheless, I'd still recommend ""DD:HN"" just for the sake of fun.  It's perfect for a night in with the girls or even for spending time with a significant other.  If you  have already seen it and think it's terrible, try watching it for similarities with its predecessor and come to appreciate the captivating uniqueness that is ""Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights."" :)",1110844800,2,1321,4.954545454545454

The two lead characters have absolutely no chemistry whatsoever, and their acting was the pits. This movie was very lame. I don't know how some people can say that it was better than the original dirty dancing. That is not true at all! The original is a classic! Great dancing and great storyline, which Havana Nights does NOT have!!!!! In fact, it's NOTHING like the original. I don't even know how it can even be called a sequel of it. The only bright spot of it, were the Patrick Swayze appearances, and some of the dancing was okay, but that's it, just ""okay"".

I also love the underlying plot of learning people before judging them and to watch where you step as someone's toes are always there.  I had had heard how terrible this movie was and so forth but I can say I think I like it better than the first.  I love the first one but this one the music gets you moving and the romance between the two main characters is intense.  I also loved the DANCING!  They are great!  The part with the movie is one of my favorite scenes it is romantic but not trashy.  There is intense love for one another and that acting is superb as you get caught up in each one of the characters!  If you watch this movie and enjoy the music the soundtrack is worth buying!

2057717,4,B00023BLXK,"This movie was actually quite good. When I first found out that they were doing a second Dirty Dancing my first instinct was NO! Absolutely NOT! So many times when film makers toy with older movies they never seem to come out right. For example Disney and the many sequels they torture us with. However, when I sat down and watched the movie I LOVED it! It got me really excited about dancing just as the first version had. I actually went to see the movie twice when it was in theaters. Something I had never really done before. The only reason I give it four stars is because I'm not that happy with the girl they chose to play Katie who was the Protagonist in the movie. Most of the time she was fine but sometimes I felt that she could have done a better job with some of her lines. Also there was the matter of the way Katie and her dance partner Javier express their feelings to each other. There really isn't a reckoning point. There are several points in the movie where I thought, ""Ok this is it. They're going to kiss each other and realize each others affections."" But it never really came that way. The first time we see them kiss is on the dance floor as the result of Javier's spontaneity. Then suddenly the next night they sleep with each other. It happens in a lot the same way in the first movie. If they were attempting to be more true to reality they missed the mark because I don't know if that is really something that would happen. A shy straight laced innocent virgin like Katie just hopping into his arms for one night. Then again, maybe that's the power of love...",1106438400,2,1589,4.3

The acting was poor, the dancing stunk (what little bit there was), especially since they used the same dance as was used in the original Dirty Dancing, they just added a couple latin moves.  There was very little ""heat"" between the characters during the dancing, it lacked emotion.  Like another reviewer mentioned, using the revolution as a backdrop seemed forced and flaccid.  Thankfully it wasn't a long movie.  Myself being a former dancer/choreographer, I was looking forward to a great high energy dancing movie, especially with how sexy latin dancing is, I was very disappointed and very glad that I didn't pay theater prices to see it!",1105747200,5,796,4.859259259259259

The story is flaccid and all too predictable, and the use of the Cuban Revolution in the background is forced, awkward and unbelievable.  It's just ridiculous to cast Luna in the role of a budding underground revolutionary.  The ending, with the two puppy lovers making love and then gleefully saying goodbye, is a total insult to the audience.

Ok, so we probably didn't watch the movie for the silly plot or the unbalanced romance.  But unlike the original Dirty Dancing, which had good acting and good dancing to make it into a classic, this one lacks these sorely, too.  Nobody in this movie can really act, and the dancing feels empty and falls short of my modest expectations.  Where's the energy?  Where's the rhythm?  Where's the art?  None of those.  The two leading actors are just too young to be taken seriously in any way.

The backdrop of this movie (the period just before the Cuban revolution) does not impact much upon the storyline other than being a convenient way for the show to end (and rather abruptly at that), but forget about it! What is there is enough for warrant it more than just one viewing. A definite must-watch for people who like dancing, good music and a little romance!",1100476800,3,760,4.62962962962963
2057721,2,B00023BLXK,"Patrick Swayze makes little more than a guest appearance in ""Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights,"" the misbegotten ""sequel"" to the 1987 box office smash that turned the actor into a bona fide movie star.

This time around the focus is on Katey Miller (Romola Garai), a high school senior who moves with her family to Cuba in 1958, right on the eve of the Castro revolution.  While there, she goes from being a white-bread, college-bound bookworm to a hot-blooded Latin dancer under the tutelage of a young Cuban (""Y Tu Mama Tambien""'s Diego Luna) who works poolside at the hotel where she and many other Americans live. Naturally, her cavorting around with a dark-skinned native raises a whole host of hackles among the snooty foreigners who live only to feed off the sweat and hard work of the indigenous population.

Naturally, it is the dancing that is the key element in a film of this type, but even the choreography, which isn`t really all that impressive to begin with, can't overcome the film's humdrum storyline, shallow characterizations and infantile view of international politics.  The complexities of the Cuban revolution are glossed over in favor of soap opera mechanics and corny melodramatics.  As ""Doctor Zhivago"" proved long ago (only better), there's nothing like a governmental overthrow to put a little sizzle into your love life.

As noted earlier, Swayze stops by briefly to reprise his role as Johnny Castle, providing Katie with a few words of wisdom and encouragement and showing her a few nifty dance moves before sending her on her way.  I hope Swayze was paid well for his efforts, but it seems a bit demeaning for a star of Swayze's caliber to be treated in so ungrateful and cavalier a fashion.  The irony is that the film would have been far more interesting had it focused on Castle instead of Katie, but it's obvious that the studio executives who green lighted this project weren't about to bankroll a dance film with a middle-aged actor in the lead role.  That ""Shall We Dance?"" will wind up doing far better at the box office than ""Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights"" may provide some sweet vindication not only for Swayze but for all the fans of the original film for which this sequel was allegedly made.",1098576000,14,2231,4.804177545691906
2057722,5,B00023BLXK,"I loved 'Dirty Dancing Havana Nights'! I've seen the original 'Dirty Dancing' a few times and this one is just as great!

The story is about a young high school girl(Katie) who moves with her family to Cuba in the late 1950's just before the revolution that put Castro in power(her father's job sends them there). She is bookish and shy.

At the hotel where they are staying, she meets a young Cuban waiter with whom she strikes an immediate friendship. Javier(the waiter) is different from other young people she knows and he encourages her to come out of her shyness and be more free and open with herself.

When her friend and sister see the two of them together, they alert the hotel staff and he immediately loses his job for being with her. Katie encourages Javier to enter a latin dance contest with her for the chance at some much needed cash that will be given to the winners. Javier happens to dance like a dream and Katie's family comes from a dance background as well. She feels that with enough practice together, they have a really good chance at winning. Naturally, during the course of practice and performing the two fall sweetly in love and awaken deep feelings in each other.

Diego Luna and Romola Gerai star as the young couple and they are perfectly matched!  This was great casting! They have great chemistry and their dancing is fabulous!  Diego Luna is gorgeous! What a sexy smile!

The music is incredible and watching 'Havana Nights' made me want to learn to dance! The soundtrack is definitely worth it! 'Dance Like This' is my favorite track, but I love all the songs! I could watch this one over and over!

This was a great production. The costumes, sets, location! All super!

'Dirty Dancing Havana Nights' is great. Definitely worth seeing more than once!",1096416000,11,1787,4.647619047619048

The filming (done in Puerto Rico) was beautiful. True to it's name, it lived up to the Dirty Dancing storyline. Blossoming Romance, Onlooking parents, and of course, DANCING!

The very best thing about this movie is Diego Luna. What a cutie! I think any woman watching wouldn't mind him leading her across the dance floor! I watched the movie by myself in the living room and had to call my husband at work to say, ""Let's dance!"". Needless to say I got a good chuckle! hehe

The music was great and Diego was absolutely delightful, what a sexy little bugger, who wouldn't want someone like that dancing you across the floor and anywhere else he wanted to take you. In the special features he talks about how excited he got when he finally learned the dance steps and you can see that joy all over his face in the one special scene.  For the most part the whole movie is great.  The ending is a little weak and that was the only disappointment.

Havana Nights captures the fact you dance what you feel, more than the orginal, it adds the spicy touch of the sexy salsa, to the strict form of ballroom dancing.

Its got many of the same idea's of the Orginal, such as romance, the falling in love with the boy who works for the resort, Patrick Swayze is in the movie as well as a dance instructor; and in the dance scequence you can see so many of the moves found in the orginal done by Baby and Johnny, except with the spicy latin twist added to it.

I believe the producers could have hired professional dancers for the title roles. They did so for the background and it was great.

My only complaint is that it ended much too quickly, without much closure for the audience, but otherwise this film is a joy to watch.

 Katie (Romola Garai) has just moved to pre-revolution Cuba. She's a total bookworm, but when she meets hotel waiter Javier (the marvelous Diego Luna) she's completely swept away. The basic story follows that of the original-- she doesn't know how to ""feel"" the music, her parents dissaprove of the guy she likes, preferring her to date the guy she hates.

 The cinematography is impressive, and the colors are amazing-- lots of reds and oranges. It's so picturesque. The performances were great, the dancing was wonderful (although I don't think the dancing was necessarily dirty, it was much more beautiful and sensual than the dancing in the original). I really like that Patrick Swayze makes an appearance as a dance instructor. His limited screen time is awesome.

The cast was great and the setting was beautiful. While the story was boring, it had charm. After the movie, I viewed the deleted scenes and realized that had they not been taken out, most of my complaints wouldn't exist. I hate when a movie is ruined because of test audience opinions. The deleted scenes in this case should have stayed because they added to the story rather than subtracted from it. Had that been the case, we would have had a much better movie.

Unfortunately, the camera almost always shot them from the waist up so you couldn't really feel the dance or even know if they weren't messing up. The only thing you could make out was whether they were supposed to be dirty or ballroom dancing. In fact, the only dance I could see clearly, and thus the most riveting, was the recreation of the original dirty dance with the Patrick Swayze cameo. Even when the actors finally get to their big routine you don't get to see much of it due to camera angles and the plot twist. I only harp on the dancing aspects because I am sure many other people will be interested in this movie, as I was, for dancing. The dancing is good but you see so little of it is not very inspiring.

In fact, it didn't really feel like a dancing movie. The dancing almost seemed to be a subplot to the Cuban revolution theme. The themes of the  different social classes and the revolution felt trite though. It didn't seem to fit in the movie too fluidly and it was not dealt with in depth.

Other detractions of the movie were the simplictic language used, the youthful pubescent look of the leading man which made it hard to look at him dirty dance without feeling uncomfortable, and the inconsistent texture of the movie. What I mean by texture is nothing that really detracts from the plot, just little things which seem implausible. I found it hard to believe this rich, protective, socialite family would, upon discovering their young, high school daughter's romantic relationship with a lower class Cuban would allow her to spend entire nights away from the family in revolutionary Cuba.

On a more positive note, the visual look of the movie made it a treat for the eyes. The colors and scenery were delectable. The music was a pleasure to hear. And although the dialogue is simple, it is pleasantly interspersed with Spanish language (which is refreshing after seeing many movies set in other countries where not only do the main characters not speak the language, but have no accent!).

Overall, the movie is not hard to watch. It is rather pleasant. However it is not exactly a must-see and of course it does not compare to Dirty Dancing.",1091059200,,2369,4.525700934579439

Okay so Romola Garai was a bit stiff at times but hey the dancing was SO INCREDIBLE!!!!  Diego Luna and Romola Garai are a perfect match, in terms of dancing, to this untrained (well at least in terms of Ballroom dancing which is completely different than the types of dancing I learned!) eye.  What added to the movies complete success were the costumes, which were beautiful 50's period pieces, as well as the music which was a mixture of pure Cubano music, Afro-Cubano music, and what sounded like some modern version of Cubano music.  Maya's song was to die for, but I can't say that there wasn't a single song contained in this movie that I did not enjoy!  Any woman or girl on the verge of womanhood should be so lucky to experience a romantic interlude such as this one!  I like this better than the original Dirty Dancing...speaking of which for you Patrick Swayze fans, he plays a brief role in this movie as (What Else..) the hotel's dance instructor, with (I believe) the woman who played the nymphomaniac in the original movie!!!

It would of course have been easily forgotten if the dancing

experience in dancing.  The result is obvious, and the dancing

is not good.  There are some good dancers as back-drop

but you see them for split-seconds, probably so that it doesn't

become too obvious how inexperienced the main-characters really

are.  They have a lot of talent and are doing a good job for the

short time thay have had to practice dancing, but the movie

does not contain a lot of good dancing.

It is very sad that the creators of the movie would just throw

away the money making it, considering that there are a lot of

I loved every moment of the film.

Yes, some of the dialogue was corny, and yes, some of the plot was lame. But in light of these vices, I found the performances from the two leads excellent! Luna's first English film was great, and so different than 'Y Tu Mama Tambien.'

Diego Luna and Romola Garai make a terrific couple and both have enough stature to bring this little soap opera up to higher aspirations.  Set against the end of Batista's rule over Cuba and the rise of Castro, the background of Cuban exoticism adds to this coming together of a Cuban lad and an American lass on the dance floors of Cuban nightclubs and eventual Latin Dancing competition.  The story may be slight, but the cast is genuine and endearing and there is plenty of very beautiful and sensuous dancing to brighten up the plot.

Well...according to the reviews here it was the best movie ever made, fantastic plot, beautiful love story, etc,etc.
WHAT NONSENSE.......it was one of the most shallow excuses for a sequel I have ever seen. Patrick Swayze was the only redeeming factor for the 4 mins or so he was in the movie.
Granted, some of the dancing was good but the girls parents, supposedly ex-champions, couldn't even dance. The editor was at great pains to ensure we didn't see them dance properly and the actors in the black and white footage of the parents dancing were obviously not the same as the ""on-screen"" actors.

Clearly it wasn't a completely original plot, but being set in Havana in the late 50's during the days leading up to the Cuban Revolution definately gave it flavor. I thought that the performances by Diego Luna and Romola Garai were excellent, and their chemistry was just great. They made it so believable. The music and the dancing is fascinating, however like most films with dancing, it's unfortunate that the editing tends to take away from seeing the dance routines in their entirety, but it's still impressive. All in all, I'd say this film is enjoyable, especially if you liked the first Dirty Dancing and enjoy cuban music and dancing. There's nothing deep about it, but it doesn't matter.

2057763,3,B00023BLXK,"When Katey Miller (Romala Garai)'s parents announce that they are moving the family to Havana, Cuba for her father's job, she is a little less than thrilled.  In fact, she refuses to even speak to her family for a few days, giving them the famous silent treatment.  What 18 year-old would be thrilled at having to leave behind their school, friends, and familiar surroundings to move to a country that is on the brink of a revolution?!
Bookish and shy A-student Katey arrives in Havana where her innate curiosity comes alive, as she becomes entranced by all the new sights and things around her.  She resolutely decides to try and make the best of her new home, and soon is pulled into life in Havana.  Although she is a bit quiet and standoffish to the other students at first (children of the ""smart set"": from the other well-to-do families staying at the Oceana Hotel), she soon catches the eye of one of the boys: her father's boss's son, James Phelps (Jonathan Jackson).  He becomes interested in her beauty and brains (as she ""shows up"" the other students in class), and begins to pursue her, while their mothers stand by encouraging.  One night as they are out on the town, Katey is completely put off by his snobbish manner and the way he looks down on the native Cubans and treats them like lowly servants.
It is a local Cuban boy who works at the hotel, Javier Suarez (Diego Luna), who sparks her interest when by chance she happens to see him dancing in the streets of Havana. She is wide-eyed at the Latin steps, moving with a fluid rhythm and sensual grace like she has never seen anyone dance before.
Katey soon tries to emulate the Latin influenced dance that she sees at the local nightclub, but without much success.  When it comes to the foxtrot, waltz, or other popular dances of the 1950's, Katey knows every step, but she knows nothing about Latin dance.  Patrick Swayze makes a cameo appearance in the film as a dance instructor at the Oceana Hotel: choice moments that the viewing audience went crazy over!  Katey's parents are retired Ballroom Dance Champions and are completely unaware of their daughter's growing rebellion, believing she is spending her days and nights out with the ""parent-approved"" James.  Instead, Katey is spending every moment she can with Javier: but he is about to show her that she knows nothing about moving her body to the beat of the music.  And as the revolution in Cuba swells on and their passion begins to grow...
Content: For those of you worried about taking your kids: There is some language: a few uses of the Lord's name and a few swear words, not too much.  There is some violence when the Cuban police break up a party and a few times where people brandish a gun and threaten others.  Scenes at a Havana nightclub: the dancing often shows the guy putting his hands all over his partner as they are dancing: very sensual and sexual.  There is some passionate kissing, and a scene that shows a ""morning after"" type scene, but there is nothing too graphic.  There is dance practice on the beach and in the water, a woman slapping another in the face, a guy giving his unwanted attentions to a girl (mostly kissing, it stops in time).  Be aware though, that the entire tone of the film is very sexual, and is all about moving your body to the Latin rhythm with your dance partner.
From the great Latin music to the beautiful dancing, this film is worth the watch (although I would definitely not take any little ones along).  The love story between Katey and Javier is sweet and touching, and enough reason alone to give this film a go!",1081814400,7,3597,4.577881619937695

2057771,4,B00023BLXK,"No, I didn't see this movie for the dancing, or to scope out Romola Garai.  I didn't even go to give a critical analysis of the depiction of Cuba on the fateful New Year's Eve 1958, even though the film's full theatrical title is: ""Dirty Dancing Havana Nights Based On True Events"".
None of that.  I went because it's ""Dirty Dancing"".  I saw the original in the theater when I was 13, just days after falling in love with a young blonde from Queens named Veronica, who I met a a Catskills resort nothing at all like Kellerman's.  I felt kinship with Baby, even though the only person who forbade my romance was Veronica herself, tragically into older men.  And now I wanted to see the followup, filmed in the same Old San Juan where I got engaged this winter.
""Dirty Dancing"" and I matured together.  Over time I watched it blossom into a pop culture camp classic.  Who here of a certain age doesn't instinctively break into giggles upon hearing ""Nobody puts Baby in the corner""?
""Havana Nights"" brings out the big movie guns in an attempt to recapture the magic of the original.  This is a Miramax film, so you know Harvey Weinstein was putting in the late nights helping polish the rough cut into a theatrical diamond.  Lawrence Bender, who made his bones on the early Tarantino epics, produced.  Mya Harrison and Heather Headley both show up for star vocal turns.
And, of course, Patrick Swayze is back.  He is billed only as ""Dance Class Instructor"".  He appears in only two scenes (probably shot the same morning) and applauds and whistles in a couple of reaction-shot inserts, quite possibly filmed in his home, months after production wrapped.  But we all know who he is supposed to be.  Welcome back, Johnny Castle!
Swayze was in his early-to-mid 30s when the first ""Dirty"" came out.  Now he is 51, and playing the same character... but this movie set five years before the original.  He has aged remarkably well.  And this may create a market for Swayze power cameos in remakes of his earlier classics.  Who wouldn't relish the return of Dalton in ""Road House Manitoba""?  Who doesn't want to see Swayze counseling ""Los Angeles Ghost""?  The possibilities are endless.
""Havana Nights"" gives you exactly what you would expect.  There's romance, attractive scantily-clad young people, a performance by Sela Ward modeled closely after Jerry Orbach's in the original, a smattering of social history, and a hip-swinging soundtrack.  I doubt this movie will soar to the pop-culture heights of the original: the soundtrack is lighter and the dialogue can't have much impact until it, too, has survived a thousand airings on VH1.
What intrigues is the change of focus.  ""Dirty Dancing"" was about a girl raised on ballroom dancing who wanted to get sensual.  ""Havana Nights"" is about a dirty dancing boy who wants to learn ballroom.  If, in five years, ballroom dancing has reclaimed the pop culture, we will be able to thank ""Havana Nights"", and Patrick Swayze will once again be at the center of it all.",1078617600,13,3003,4.750965250965251
