7894161,4,6305759308,The movie is just about a story being told by a girl who's grant ancestor was a evil vampire named Ricco. It has some good scenes of vampires in a night club and dancers. It revolves about a gang of vampire hunters who go searching to slaughter Ricco and his whole blood-pack of gnomes. As the story unfolds i got less interested in it.,1472083200,,336,4.265625

7894163,1,6305759308,All over the place - clashing genres - clashing acting styles.  A bit of this and a bit of that.  I bought it as a Mads Mikkelsen fan completing my collection but blink and you'll miss him.  A film made by mates perhaps - just for laughs?,1361577600,,238,4.0212765957446805
7894164,3,6305759308,"I'm a massive fan of both horror and foreign films (particularly Danish), so this was a great buy for me. The movie itself was quite entertaining with decent acting all around. It could be a bit confusing at times, but it was still good. The visual effects were pretty awesome as was the directing. It had some pretty awesome action scenes. The main girl's best friend was extremely annoying, but then I think she was supposed to be. All told, I really enjoyed it. It wasn't a deep masterpiece, but it was still a very fun film to watch.

So then why do I give it three stars? I'll tell you why...

Call me a purist, but I really enjoy hearing foreign films in their original language. Film dubs irritate the heck out of me, and not just because nine times out of ten the voice acting is terrible, but also because it takes a lot away from the actor's performance. It really bothered me throughout the whole thing that this DVD didn't have the option to watch it with English subtitles in its original Danish. The voice acting for the English dubs was typically terrible, and it just kept taking me out of the movie. But try as I might, I can't seem to find a version of this movie that offers the original voices. I wish they'd release one.

Okay, I'm finished ranting.

If you love horror/vampire movies, you'll love this movie. Despite my peeve being upset throughout this movie, I still enjoyed it. But if you're a foreign film purist and dubs really bother you, try and find another version of this film with the original track.

And when you do, tell me, so I can get it. :P",1245024000,,1580,4.397260273972603
7894165,4,6305759308,"I'm always on the lookout for new and different vampire tales.  I had first rented this at Blockbuster a few years back and kept meaning to buy it and finally did. I had liked the atypical genre ending and there are some interesting supporting characters.

  After seeing it again I still liked it, but became aware of a section of the story that was a bit confusing.  A young woman has inherited a creepy old house,in Denmark, from her grandmother and discovers a dark family secret--an ancestor was turned into a vampire.  His bones are in the basement of the house.

  As the girl, her boyfiriend, and female best friend read the history of how the man became a vampire they discover the grandmother had help, at one point, from a young man and his friends.  This is where the story gets a bit foggy becuase it's not explained how the guy and the grandmother met or who the various strangely dressed vamps are that the young man goes up against--outside of the fact that they're followers of the girl's vampire ancestor.

  However, in the special features section there's an article from ""Fangoria"" magazine which explained that the film had originally been a short and was expanded to feature length.  The short is the center section involving the young man who helps the grandmother.  But that still didn't explain the vamps and their clothes until I remembered a section in the film where the young woman, induced by her vampire ancestor's spirit to resurrect him uses the names, Gangarel, Ventrue, etc.  These are the names of vampire clans from a game called Vampire the Masquerade.  At one point it was made into a tv miniseries titled ""Kindred the Embraced"" (BUY IT!!!--it was never made into a regular series because the lead character Mark Frankel who starred as the vampire Prince of San Francisco was killed in a motorcycle accident in his home country of England.)  Each of the clans had a distinctive look and clan behavior.  The Ventrue are business people, the Toreador (the fancy dressed ones in the film) are artistic types and then there are the Gangarel (the punk looking ones) who are gypsy types.  This was obviously and homage to the game and the show (there are also novels and a book or two of short stories based on the game).",1156464000,6,2255,4.675126903553299

7894167,1,6305759308,"I thought that it was weired, they spend the whole movie with flashbacks then finaly wake the vamp for less than 15 minutes. I'll give it one thing it had cool fx, but other than that,nothing",961372800,2,191,4.333333333333333
