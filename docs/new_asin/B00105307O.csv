3047187,4,B00105307O,"""The Wild Wild West"" encountered a few production problems toward the end of its run. Ross Martin's mid-season heart attack resulted in a variety of guest agents. There also was the issue of Robert Conrad's near-fatal stunt mishap in ""The Night of the Fugitives,"" followed by a Congressional crusade that forced CBS to place restrictions on the show's comic-book violence. Amidst the behind-the-scenes turmoil were classic adventures such as ""The Night of the Big Blackmail,"" ""The Night of Fire and Brimstone"" and ""The Night of the Kraken."" Unfortunately, Michael Dunn's final appearance as Dr. Loveless suffered from a lackluster script and Martin's absence. Though uneven, Season Four marked a welcome return to the bizarre fantasies that were absent in the 1967-68 episodes. Strangely enough, ""The Wild Wild West"" remains the only series in television history to be canceled for ""excessive violence"" - a political scapegoat in the aftermath of the King and Kennedy assassinations. Perhaps it was for the best. Unlike other TV heroes, James West and Artemus Gordon rode off into the sunset without overstaying their welcome.",1201564800,21,1126,5.331460674157303
3047188,5,B00105307O,"I have been a fan of the Wild Wild West since I was a kid. It's great to see that all the seasons are finally available on DVD. It won an Emmy and was nominated for 2 Golden Globes!! Like most successful TV shows it got better each year. What is interesting about TWWW is that is was a show that was way ahead of it's time. It was without a doubt the X-Files of the 60's. I firmly believe that the creator of the X-Files(Chris Carter) grew up watching The Wild Wild West! Robert Conrad was a health buff and trained in karate and boxing which allowed him to perform his own stunts that made Secret Service Agent James West that much more realistic. Even Ross Martin was an experienced stage actor which made Secret Service Agent Artemus Gordon believable. The show was an amazing mix of spy, western and sci-fi television and also was the first TV show to cross-mix with other successful TV shows -  In episode #97, ""The Night of the Sabatini Death"", there was a tribute to the TV series, ""Gilligan's Island"" due to the fact that both Alan Hale Jr. (The Skipper) and Jim Backus (The Millionaire) were guest-starring on the episode. At the very end of the episode, Alan Hale's character said that he's going off to a deserted island for a vacation while a few notes of the Gilligan's Island theme song played in the background! That was cool to watch and again way ahead of it's time.
The show's theme as well as the spellbinding music within made the show that much more intriguing and exciting. The humor that was introduced at times also added to the success of the show.  On top of all this it introduced other stars into each episode. Robert Duvall, Don Rickles, Alan Hale Jr. Jim Backus, Boris Karloff, Victor Buono, Richard Prior, Jack Elam, Ray Walston, Willam Schallert,Agness Moorehead,Burgess Meredith,Sammy Davis Jr., Peter Lawford, Carol O'Connor,Ricardo Montalban,Suzanne Pleshette, John Astin, Martin Landau,Ed Asner,Ted Knight, Richard Anderson,Red West, Martin Brooks,Norman Fell and many more!!!Unfortunately however the movie remake of TWWW in 1999 starring Will Smith/Kevin Kline was an insult to not only the cast and characters of the original TV series but to the original series itself. However it now lives again on DVD and I suggest you check it out for yourself especially if you were a fan of the X-Files.",1200528000,24,2332,4.741379310344827
3047189,5,B00105307O,"This great series is finally available on DVD collections by seasons. ""The Wild, Wild West"" was one of the last successful Western television shows, coming on right as the era of the great Western TV show was coming to an end.

Its success was due to the fact that not only was it exciting and action-packed, but it was a curious meld of traditional Western action, espionage, science fiction, and high camp. It was in equal parts a product of its time as a Western, such as ""Gunsmoke"" and ""Bonanza,"" a semi-serious, lots of camp spy show like ""I-Spy,"" ""The Man From UNCLE,"" and ""The Avengers,"" science fiction like ""Star Trek"" and ""Voyage To The Bottom of the Sea,"" and sophomoric camp like ""Batman."" Robert Conrad and Ross Martin made a formidable team as US Secret Service agents James West and Artemis Gordon, as they travelled all over the West in their personal locomotive thwarting the schemes and intrigues of power-mad scientists and ruthless governments.

This show is near and dear to a lot of us who grew up in the mid to late 60's, and it is a joy to watch these episodes and remember that while the world was not a simple, carefree place, our living rooms could be while watching shows like ""The Wild, Wild West.""",1198108800,25,1227,4.598173515981735
3047190,5,B00105307O,"Witness if you will the fourth (1968-1969) and final season of ""The Wild Wild West"", still produced by Bruce Lansbury and that continues his updated and rugged treatment of the series with the paranoid political tales: ""The Night of the Doomsday Formula"" (guest starring Kevin McCarthy as the fanatical General Kroll) and ""The Night of the Pistoleros"" showing a future nations' conflict triggered by Mexican look-alikes of American military officers.

You will meet James West's new partners because Artemus Gordon is sent to Washington: secret agent/master of disguises Jeremy Pike (played by Charles Aidman) in four episodes (""The Night of the Camera"", ""The Night of Miguelito's Revenge"" that is the last Dr. Loveless' offering, ""The Night of the Pelican"", ""The Night of the Janus"" that is Charles Aidman's best performance as Baron Klaus Esterhauser and in which we catch a glimpse of James West's training academy), secret agent/master of disguises Frank Harper (played by William Schallert) in the two parter ""The Night of the Winged Terror"", and chemist/agent Ned Brown (played by Alan Hale Jr) in the gloomy ""The Night of the Sabatini Death"".

Moreover, we will again foray into the off-centered and the macabre fantasies as the Hammer Productions-like ""The Night of the Sedgewick Curse"" dealing with the theme of the fountain of youth, the tribute to the classic ""The Phantom of the Opera"" in ""The Night of the Diva"" (Robert Conrad even sings ""Buffalo Gals"" with his friends Richard Cangey and Red West) and a veiled reference to Conan Doyle's ""The Hound of the Baskervilles"" in ""The Night of the Bleak Island"", and two Jules Verne-oriented ones in ""The Night of the Kraken"" (which highlights a Captain Nemo type of character) and ""The Night of the Winged Terror, Part I & II"" (describing a secret organization of subversive mad scientists ruled by a hypercephalic mastermind).

One episode, directed in late season 3, depicts Robert Conrad's tragic fall while performing his stunt: ""The Night of the Fugitives"" (guest starring Simon Oakland).",1197331200,60,2051,5.171686746987952
3047191,5,B00105307O,"Well here we are, the final adventures of James T West and Artemus Gordon.  Hard to believe the series only ran 4 years.  Growing up in New York, the reruns ran aplenty during the 70s.  Sadly though, series co-star Ross Martin didn't get to appreciate the whole season as he was side lined by a heart attack.  Replacing him was a young Charles Aidman as Jeremy Pike who was as good at his trade as Arte (you get the impression he learned from the master himself) and others including Alan (the Skipper) Hale, John Dehner and William Schallert (Carson Drew, Nils Baris, Martin Lane) in a 2 part episode.  Their names got billed in the ending credits in the episodes they appeared in though Martin continued to appear in the opening credits for the remainder of the run.  Martin would recover to be able to do the sequel films made in 1979 and 1980, Wild Wild West Revisited and More Wild Wild West which according to [...] will sadly not be included in this set.  Fortunately, they are shown often enough on Encore Westerns so you can copy them yourself uncut (the prerecorded VHS tapes I believe are copy protected).  Martin passed away soon after making the sequel films, but I am sure if we looked up him up on the IMDB we would find a lot of good stuff under his name including a villain on Wonder Woman in 1977, and an attempt to bring Charlie Chan back just before or after More Wild Wild West. So get this last season, and appreciate 4 years of one of the shortest yet popular Western series of the 1960s.",1196640000,72,1511,4.410071942446043

It looks very tame today compared to the in your face ""sex and blood and guts violence"" on today's TV shows. I was very pleased when it was released on DVD. However, I am disappointed that the 2 Wild Wild West made for TV movies made in 1979 and 1980 aren't available separately but only in the complete series box set. Paul Williams as Dr Loveless's son was a perfect choice. A few years ago I heard a new TV series would be coming out but with James West being a woman Jane West. That would have been a flop. Wild Wild West was a macho western spy spoof. Would anyone have gone to the movie to see English super spy Jane Bond 007? Don't think so!",1406332800,,927,4.0989010989010985

3047331,4,B00105307O,"The fourth, and final, season of ""The Wild Wild West"" aired from September 1968 to April 1969.  The culture of the United States continued to evolve rapidly as younger people exerted a greater influence on it.  Westerns dominated television of the 1950's, but by the end of the 1960's it was apparent that westerns had run their course, though a few westerns continued to hang on.  Most westerns contained elements that aficionados of the genre considered traditional, but the format of ""The Wild Wild West"" permitted science fiction and fantasy.

The fourth season continued the formula of the preceding seasons, with a significant change due to illness.  The average episode featured at least two fight scenes, with James Tiberius West (Robert Conrad) usually winning the day.  In most episodes, Artemus Gordon (Ross Martin) would introduce a neat gadget, appear in disguise, or both.

The significant change was when Ross Martin had a heart attack and missed filming of nine episodes.  Martin's position (not his role) was filled by Charles Aidman, Alan Hale, and William Schallert.  The replacements brought their own style to the show, including a bit of humor when Alan Hale's character talks about going to a desert island and a snippet of music from ""Gilligan's Island"" is played.  That particular episode also featured Jim Backus, another ""Gilligan's Island"" regular.

In previous season, the general strategy was for James West to provide physical and strategic capabilities with Artemus's brains.  Because Artemus was often missing, James sometimes stepped in to fill in for Artemus's genius; sometimes the fill-ins did.  One thing that never failed in this series is West's fortuitous luck and the never-failing arrogance of the enemy.

In the final 24 episodes of the series, the show managed to introduce many different elements.  One episode appeared to borrow freely from ""The Hound of the Baskervilles.""  Another episode seemed inspired by ""The Phantom of the Opera.""  Other episodes seemed inspired by spy and science fiction shows of the 1950's and 1960's.  In ""The Night of the Sedgewick Curse,"" members of the Sedgewick family experience rapid aging.  There is a scene reminiscent of the wolf man and Dr. Jekyll where a family member ages rapidly in the course of seconds.  Other episodes featured deadly germs, an apparent kraken, and a gigantic tuning fork that is able to destroy houses.  ""The Night of the Juggernaut"" featured a steam-powered tank; a bit in advance of the first non-rail, mounted armored vehicle built around 1904.

The guest stars on ""The Wild Wild West"" were often entertainment industry veterans.  Comedian Harvey Korman, who was a regular on ""The Carol Burnett Show"" and was a lead character in ""Blazing Saddles,"" appeared as an enemy of the week.  Michael Dunn appeared as Dr. Miguelito Loveless, one of James West's most intelligent and creative foes, a final time.  Some of the many other guest stars, many of whom are no longer with us, were Kevin McCarthy, Pat Paulsen, Frank Campanella, Ted Knight, Sorrell Brooke, Jackie Coogan, pop singer Jackie DeShannon, who also sings on the episode, John Williams, Beverly Garland, whose last role was in ""Seventh Heaven,"" Nina Foch, Guy Stockwell, and Lana Wood.

After watching the twenty-four episodes twice, and looking back on this final season, I have mixed feelings about the fourth season.  Some of the plots seem remarkably similar to plots from the first three seasons.  I wondered whether I could go through the episodes from all four seasons and find categories of plot.  The ""old dark house"" appears in quite a few episodes, with at least three, maybe more, on islands.  Megalomaniacs were frequently the enemy of the week, though they were entertaining in their variety.  I sometimes had the feeling when watching the fourth season, which I did after re-watching the first three seasons again, that perhaps the show was winding down.  The creativity and cleverness seemed a bit less than in the previous seasons.  The show appeared, to me, to be at a turning point.  Had the show been renewed, it needed to be refreshed in some way to keep viewers watching.  Yet, it was sad, bittersweet, really, watching the final episodes, knowing that something magical was going to be lost when the show was cancelled.

Lobbying groups claimed there was too much violence on television, and for sure that violence was going to lead to bad things.  One of the television shows targeted as being too violent was ""The Wild Wild West.""  Watching the show forty-plus years later, the violence does not appear to me to be as bad as claimed.  Yes, there were multiple fights each week.  Yes, there were periodic gunfights and explosions.  Yet, in contrast to modern television, the show was not graphic and I consider the violence not only relatively tame, but also occasionally campy.

Sadly, as with seasons two and three, there are no extras.

I consider ""The Wild Wild West"" to be classic television.  The show was able to do things that most traditional westerns, and even most science fiction shows, were unable to do.  The plots were often inspired and creative.  The chemistry between Robert Conrad and Ross Martin was phenomenal and it was always entertaining to watch the pair together.  The show was frequently anachronistic, but the show turned what could have been a detriment into an advantage, playing fast and loose with history in an amusing and fun way.  Fans enjoy pointing out historical inaccuracies of the show, but they do so in the spirit of the show, which was to be entertaining.

""The Wild Wild West"" was one of a kind, and is unlikely to be duplicated.  Ross Martin and Robert Conrad were a great team.  While often formulaic, the formula worked, and we tuned in every week to see the gadgets, the characters, and just what kind of mess Artie and James would get into this week.  Here is a show that I would have watched for many more seasons, had it not been cancelled.

3047352,5,B00105307O,"""The Wild Wild West - Season Four"" was the final season of a fun TV program that was equal parts western drama and modern spoof.  Robert Conrad and Ross Martin return as US Secret Service agents James West and Artemus Gordon, out to save the American West of the 1870's from a variety of exotic and diabolical villains.  Actor Ross Martin suffered from health problems during the season.  His temporary replacements included William Schallart, Charles Aidman, Alan Hale Jr, and Pat Paulsen, each of whom added something positive to their episodes paired with Robert Conrad.

Season Four gives no indications the show was running out of steam.  Among the highlights: The return of long-time foe Dr. Loveless in ""The Night of Miguelito's Revenge; Jim West's return to the Secret Service Training Academy to smoke out a traitor in ""The Night of the Janus""; a nicely done gloss on the Sherlock Holmes classic ""The Hound of the Baskervilles"" in ""The Night of Bleak Island""; and a complicated favor for a dying criminal in ""The Night of the Sabatini Death.""

The television episodes have nicely transferred to DVD format, wild fights and James Bond spoofs intact; it is hard to believe these shows first aired forty years ago.  ""The Wild Wild West - Season Four"" is very highly recommended to fans of the series.",1254700800,2,1306,4.8558558558558556

3047384,5,B00105307O,"As with some of the other 60s shows I've reviewed (ie.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mission-Impossible-The-Complete-First-TV-Season/dp/B000HWZ4HU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mission Impossible - The Complete First TV Season</a>), I should acknowledge I was born long after this series ended and only caught some brief snippets in re-runs on TBS. But I'm a fan of the 60s spy genre, and decided to give The Wild Wild West a look.

This series is great fun, and credit goes to Robert Conrad and Ross Martin for creating great leading characters that have aged fairly well. Conrad plays James West exactly like what you'd want from a James Bond character in the old west - a dash of charm, charisma and authority, and a whole lot of toughness (more on that later). Ross Martin gets to indulge in a parade of interesting disguises and accents - a few of these likely wouldn't be p.c. today, but hey those were the times. Unfortunately Martin suffered a heart attack this year, forcing some fill-in guest agents (including Gilligan's Island star Alan Hale Jr).

The stories hit all your spy genre and western staples and then some - there's a pretty effects-heavy episode that features a giant kraken, which given 1960s effects you have to take with a few grains of salt. Michael Dunn's Dr. Loveless appears for the last time with a steam-powered robot, and another episode features a tank-like device called the juggernaut. The stories are played straight even when they venture into sci-fi territory, and at their best recall the old 'Republic Serial' style of adventure. There also seems to be an endless line of hot 60's actresses that guest star in every episode, including Lana Wood. It's almost like Robert Conrad had some clause in his contract that required at least one pretty girl per episode....

And last but not least, the action sequences are great. You'll find fights from today's shows may look more brutal and intense at first glance, but that's with a lot of clever photography and editing. In The Wild Wild West, you'll see one-take wide shots with people tossing each other over counters, tabletops, climbing onto 2nd-floor balconies and throwing others off, hurtling from staircases into crates, etc. It's amazing what Robert Conrad and the stunt team pulled off for a weekly TV show. What shows today let their actors take the same amount of risk?

If you have any interest at all in retro-TV, this is an extremely worthwhile set. I picked up season 4 first but it's actually inspired me to buy&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wild-Wild-West-The-Complete-Series/dp/B001CQONOA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wild Wild West: The Complete Series</a>.

3047386,5,B00105307O,"In the audio commmentary, Robert Conrad says that the series ended because of the concern that too much violence was being shown on television at the time the 4th season was in progress, this being 1968-1969.  Sad, because everytime there is an uproar about something happening on TV, shows are cancelled and then within five years shows are worse than they were.

I like the series because I saw it to be differnt from the other westerns that were airing in the mid 1960's.  The mainstay of shows were human dramas set in a western US setting.  The Wild Wild West was free-for-all approach to a western, blending technology, science, science fiction, the occult, adventure, action, pretty young ladies, humor, and wonderful character portrayals by Ross Martin.  All of this wrapped up in a mystery to be unravelled as the show progress.

Though I haven't seen every episode of the season, it seems that the shows are starting to lose something compared to Season 1.  Some of the props and sets have been reused so much that they are instantly familiar, thus somewhat stale.  But the plots continue to be interesting.  Two of the most disappointing episodes are TOF Bleak Island and TOF Miguelitos Revenge.  Bleak Island was fine except the attempt at the end to turn the story back on itself seemed very corny.  Miguelitos Revenge was a very poor last episode for such a clever adversary as Dr. Loveless.  The plot lacked the intensity of the earlier Dr. Loveless episodes and became poor attempt to introduce a science fiction element.  The absence of Antionette and Voltaire was also disappointing.  To properly tie up the Dr. Loveless legacy, I would have expected to see the clever Dr. once again plotting to get control of California, which is what he wanted in his first appearance in Season 1.

Overall, Season 4 continues the tradition of the series.  I wouldn't say it is better or worse than other seasons.  The episodes still surprise me when I see the unique blend of elements.  The ladies are still incredibly beautiful and Jim and Arty keep finding their way into the lair of the bad guys and putting them out of business.",1234224000,,2137,4.760869565217392

3047389,4,B00105307O,"The Wild Wild West (or W3), was one of the most inovative TV series to ever see the small screen. This unique concept blended the popular ""James Bond"" style spy with the classic western (both were very popular on TV and film at the time). It hit the mark so well that it was to inspire a number of other shows decades later including the popular&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Adventures-of-Brisco-County-Jr-The-Complete-Series/dp/B000F7CMPE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Adventures of Brisco County Jr. - The Complete Series</a>
The fourth and final season of W3 is every bit as entertaining as the other three.
Personally, I was most impressed with the very well thought out action scenes and clever ideas for the ""secret gadgets"" that were used in the show. Fight scenes are well coordinated and entertaining with the actors actually doing all of their own stunts.

The whole series,(including this season), has a guest star list that reads as ""whos who"" of actors from television at that time. For example: Season four included Alan Hale jr. and a small nod to his role as The Skipper in the beloved Gilligan's Island TV series.

The only drawback with the fourth season was that the producers had wanted to make the series more ""hip"" for the younger crowd by adding a sort of surf music sound to the score. It does not always work and the music is not as good as the scoring of the first two seasons.

That said, the Fourth season of The Wild Wild West is a piece of entertainment worthy of watching. So grab some popcorn and sit down with a series that never ""Jumped the Shark"". It's a Wild, Wild ride.",1224288000,3,1657,4.996376811594203

I enjoyed the fourth season a lot. It was sad not seeing Artie in them all due to illness at time of filming. But overall, good season. You can tell that something was going on due to repeated scenes in different episodes. For example, there was a scene where Jim climbed down a mountain and I knew they had cut that from an earlier episode. It's also amusing watching his hair style change because they use scenes from earlier episodes to save money probobly. It adds to the feeling of 60's TV though and I'm not expecting this to be Citizen Kane.

3047393,5,B00105307O,One thing to note about this seasons episodes is the occasional stylish late 60's background music blended in with the never old Wild Wild West theme music. Racial integration of more black actors in episodes can also be found during this season as well in contrast to previous seasons. The women's movement had not yet taken root at this time and only small traces in attitude changes toward women can be detected in the episodes.  The difference in the episodes produced in the first season versus this forth season reminds those of us who lived it the pronounced changes that took place in our society during those four short years.,1217462400,,635,4.7727272727272725

Of course, when you add in Ross Martin's talent with his many character portrayals, it's a wonder to me why the show only lasted for only 4 seasons?!! Their arch nemesis Dr. Loveless,their luxurious train coach and their many ""high tech 19th century gadgets"" brought a special flavour to the show that stands apart from all those other cardboard generic westerns. In my opinion the 1st season was the best, and the others seasons were all good too, but not without a few flaws, such as the shows' endings were a little anti climatic and a little too predictable, but that's the way it was with most of the show in the 60's. But the chemistry that Arty & Jim created could never again be successfully copied, as evident of that awful remake movie that bombed big time a few years ago.",1210550400,4,1024,4.54054054054054
3047428,3,B00105307O,"I hadn't seen the show since it went off the air in 1969.
I've bought and viewed now all four seasons. In my memories the last season was the worst of them all. If you had have asked me almost 40 years ago,my rating would barely be two stars. However,I think being able to see them 1) in good quality colour(no one I knew owned a colour set back then) and 2)and on MY time instead of a networks'(over a period of several months),it has changed my oppinion slightly. Actually seeing any TV shows on home video can't help but change the dynamic;some for the good,some for the bad.
I found the positives few and far between but nonetheless they were/are there. Michael Dunn returns as everyone's favourite villain Dr. Loveless. I don't think any Wild,Wild West fan ever disliked Dunn for his performances.
It is well known about Ross Martin and his health problem that resulted in him missing alot of the last season filming. It's obvious they held some shows in abeyance and ran them later instead of in shooting order because of the negative feedback they got from the public at the time about his ""stand-ins"".He was able to return for a precious few eps,but was unable to appear on the last. But every appearance he made,made you miss him all the more when he wasn't there. He was sorely missed which says alot about the man and the good actor he was. And speaking of acting it seems to me that Robert Conrad improved in that department as this season wound down. He stepped up when he had to and I thought his character was becoming more fleshed out also. He came into his own. This is in sharp contrast to earlier seasons when his good looks carried him farther than the quality of his acting and the lean scripts given him.
Another positive is the marvellous stunt work by Robert Conrad and his fellow actors/stuntmen. As a bit of trivia you may or may not know,Red West  appeared in many Wild,Wild West eps as one of the actor/stuntmen. Red is well known to Elvis Presley fans as being part of Elvis' inner circle/entourage.
And speaking of stunt work you get to see a stunt Robert Conrad made that went terribly awry and by the look of it could have ended his career and/or life had it gone a little differently. It shows him jumping from a landing area at the top of a long flight of stairs. He grabs onto a chandelier but looses his grip and crashes to the ground. The camera  cuts about a second after his landing and they ""covered"" the scene and went on,but it shows you how dedicated Conrad was in the making of this show. He bumped alot of heads with the shows' brass and other actors and even his co-star Martin at times. He didn't get his ""tough-guy"" image for nothing. But no one can ever say he didn't give his all during the making of this show and it's one of the reasons this show has remained a fan favourite since its' debut.
On the other side of the coin there is ALOT to say. The first shot must go to the man who had the unenviable task of first stepping in for Ross Martin when he fell ill. Charles Aidman was the worst choice for Martins' part. He simply tried too hard but came up short every time. He also had a terribly annoying ""the-cat-that-ate-the-canary"" smile on his face almost all the time. Then William Schallert stepped in for a bit. Schallert I didn't mind as much but he seemed to go to the opposite extreme of Aidman and was kind of a milquetoast. And of course two ""Gilligans Island"" refugees stepped in in the same ep and that was Jim Backus and Alan Hale Jr. And speaking of ""Gilligans Island"",the opening of the ep ""The Night of Bleak Island"" is the same opening from ""Gilligans Island"",the one showing the boat being pitched about in a storm!
It's obvious the budget for this season was next to non existent as the locations were becoming eerily similar,from ep to ep. In fact San Francisco was visited ALOT in this final season...must have been for the fresh ocean air! In fact any city that had a waterfront looked alot like San Francisco.
Footage was also pulled right out of a season three ep to make up time in one of this seasons' eps. It concerned Conrad getting put down a perilous deep hole and landing on a ledge which is close to breaking away. Same precarious position and he extracates himself exactly the same way because...it's the same footage.
I could go on but I'm sure you get the picture.
However this season,again like the others,has been remastered and most eps here are in good,crisp colour and haven't been seen this well ever.
In conclusion, there are alot of negatives which will be of concern to some and little to others,and visa versa. But there are also some positives and I think it's worth getting. When all is said and done and what matters most,is that Martin and Conrad helped create two unforgettable TV characters that have endured and stood the test of time. As long as you keep that in mind when you are watching this final season,it will help you overlook the drawbacks that creep in from time to time.",1210118400,22,4987,4.455142231947484

In a reflection of the times, worried about war and questioning whether kids should have toy guns to play with the show fell to a very biased axe.
The Fourth season features a few differences. In the first few episodes there is a distinct change in the background music that suggests the late sixties nightclub instead of the 1870 bar. The plots tend to revolve around eccentrics or eccentric countries trying to cause a national disaster or solve something at the expense of everyone else.
The sets are incredibly more colorful than the previous season and the plot lines tend to pick up in mid performance of action, as opposed to the old days when some explosion would occur and we get to see the reasons unravel.  There is also a significant change in the supporting actors. Although the series always featured a good amount of roles for minorities, there are more in this years twenty four episodes than in any prior series.
Many reviewers mention the fact that Ross Martin had a heart attack that caused him to miss many episodes in this particular season, but I remember that the general replacements of a steady Agent Pike and a host of guest stars adequately filled in while Mr. Martin was recovering. Pat Paulson, a well known comedian who became a star of the moment after his ""Laugh In"" roles was brought in as a ""special"" government agent and is among the many who perhaps are now forgotten, yet there presence here brings a moment to remember.

Affected by the anti-violence kick at the time -- drastically toning down the action in the later episodes and missing, for much of the season, Ross Martin due to a heart attack, nonetheless, still much to cheer about.  The spy craze that began with the theatrical release of FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE IN 1963 winding down. THE MAN FROM U.N.C.L.E. AND I SPY had both been cancelled the previous season.  MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE & GET SMART would last a couple of more seasons. Robert Conrad would go on the next season to work for Jack Webb on THE DA (a series inspired by Vincent Buliousi(?), the man who prosecuted Charles Manson) -- to be followed by ASSIGNMENT VIENNA (the late Roy Schieder starred in the pilot), the pilot (which aired as a tv movie but never made it to a series) THE ADVENTURES OF NICK CARTER, BLACK SHEEP SQUADRON, A MAN CALLED SLOANE, HIGH MOUNTAIN RANGERS and probably a few inbetween I can't recall.  For Ross Martin, there would be a lot of guest shots on various tv shows but never another series.  The heart attack had left to expensive to insure for a weekly show. (Though Martin would do a never sold pilot for a Charlie Chan series that raised the ire of the Asian American community at the time).  It was fun to see the both of them again in the early 80's reunion films but it was all tongue-in-cheek and not at all the same.  A moment in tv history never to be repeated.",1205884800,2,1433,4.425855513307985
3047473,4,B00105307O,"The fourth season of ""The Wild Wild West"" found the series returning to form with more fantastic stories than the third season but the show fell victim to increasing criticism about the level of violence in TV shows. Coupled with decreasing ratings for the series the show was cancelled by CBS. To make matters more difficult it was a very good but uneven season due partially to the absence of Ross Martin who suffered a heart attack midway through the production schedule. Martin and Conrad had a unique chemistry which helped sell even the weakest episodes of the series coasting along the action and charm of its stars.

The producers solution was admirable and smart--Gordon was in Washington on ""special assignment"" communicating periodically with West via notes and voice transcriptions while he was ""away"". A series of guest stars from the well known Victor Buno (who played a villain previously on the series), Alan Hale, Jr. (""Gilligan's Island""), Pat Paulsen (""Laugh In""), William Schallert and the wonderfully underrated character actor Charles Aidman (who appeared in such shows ""The Twilight Zone""--both the original and as narrator for the last season of the 1985 revival of the show--, ""Dallas"" and the film ""Twilight's Last Gleaming"") who appeared in fourth consecutive episodes as Jeremy Pike.

The fourth season started off strong and featured a parade of well known guest stars including Ted Knight (""The Mary Tyler Moore Show""), Harvey Korman (""The Carol Burnett Show""), singer Jackie DeShannon, Jim Backus ( who appears in the same episode as his former ""Gilligan's Island"" co-star Alan Hale. The episode has a very clever tongue-in-cheek reference to the other series). Other guest stars included Kevin McCarthy (""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"") boxer Floyd Patterson.

The multi-talented Michael Dunn returned in his final episode as Dr. Loveless and, although memorable as always, the episode was a bit lackluster compared to his previous appearances in the series.

This set as with the previous ones is packaged in thin packs with two discs per thin pack. The final season had 24 episodes and we get all 24 in their original uncut versions. Episode information is on the back of each thin pack along with a brief plot synopsis and some of the guest stars. The design of the package and photos used are, as always, first class.

As always, Paramount-CBS does a magnificent job with a sharp transfer with the rich, saturated colors the show was known for. Detail and image sharpness are both very good although there are a couple of soft spots that appear now and again. The audio sounds terrific with a nice mono transfer free of hiss and the audio artifacts that you generally expect from something that has had No Noise applied to its soundtrack. The music is, as always, bold and memorable.

The music leads me to the major drawback of the set--no extras. While we get all 24 uncut episodes, the show could stand to have a few minor extras produced for it. We do get previews for John Wayne films on DVD but nothing related to ""The Wild Wild West"". For example, a featurette on actor Ross Martin who had a storied career in television, film and on stage would have been nice. Although star Robert Conrad would go on to star in other TV shows (including ""Baa Baa Black Sheep"" another show with a repetitive title), Martin confined his work to guest work with a brief reoccurring role in ""Hawaii Five-O"" during its 1978/9 season. He was a talented, versatile actor who was sorely missed after his death in 1981. He did appear in the two ""The Wild Wild West"" TV movies produced by CBS and plans were in place to revive the series but were scuttled when Martin passed away.

Another featurette that would have been worthwhile would have been on Robert Conrad's storied career. Conrad who was born Konrad Robert Falkowski often did his own stunts working with the stunt coordinator and, in fact, was seriously injured during one stunt. He was an honorary member of the Stuntmen's Association. Let's not overlook the talented overlooked actor the late  Michael Dunn as well.

Another featurette that would have been good (CBS when you do the Blu-ray for this series I hope you're paying attention to these notes) for this set would have been one on the incidental music which often incorporated a unusual instruments including middle-eastern ones (clearly the 60's music scene was influential in the scoring).

A couple of commentary tracks from the surviving cast members (Conrad is evidently ill at the time of this writing so sent your good wishes and prayers his way) including Harvey Korman and Kevin McCarthy would have been nice as well.

What we do get is marvelous. I'm happy that CBS has continued to put out the last season of the show but disappointed that they didn't think it worthwhile (or weren't given the budget) to put some extras on this final season saluting the cast, crew and popularity of the show. Nevertheless, this is an essential season and I personally think even though it is a bit uneven due to Ross Martin's absence, it was a fine return to form for the most part. I'd highly recommend the 4th season of ""The Wild Wild West"".",1205798400,8,5181,4.856172140430351
3281684,4,B00105307O,"""The Wild Wild West"" encountered a few production problems toward the end of its run. Ross Martin's mid-season heart attack resulted in a variety of guest agents. There also was the issue of Robert Conrad's near-fatal stunt mishap in ""The Night of the Fugitives,"" followed by a Congressional crusade that forced CBS to place restrictions on the show's comic-book violence. Amidst the behind-the-scenes turmoil were classic adventures such as ""The Night of the Big Blackmail,"" ""The Night of Fire and Brimstone"" and ""The Night of the Kraken."" Unfortunately, Michael Dunn's final appearance as Dr. Loveless suffered from a lackluster script and Martin's absence. Though uneven, Season Four marked a welcome return to the bizarre fantasies that were absent in the 1967-68 episodes. Strangely enough, ""The Wild Wild West"" remains the only series in television history to be canceled for ""excessive violence"" - a political scapegoat in the aftermath of the King and Kennedy assassinations. Perhaps it was for the best. Unlike other TV heroes, James West and Artemus Gordon rode off into the sunset without overstaying their welcome.",1201564800,21,1126,5.331460674157303
3281685,5,B00105307O,"I have been a fan of the Wild Wild West since I was a kid. It's great to see that all the seasons are finally available on DVD. It won an Emmy and was nominated for 2 Golden Globes!! Like most successful TV shows it got better each year. What is interesting about TWWW is that is was a show that was way ahead of it's time. It was without a doubt the X-Files of the 60's. I firmly believe that the creator of the X-Files(Chris Carter) grew up watching The Wild Wild West! Robert Conrad was a health buff and trained in karate and boxing which allowed him to perform his own stunts that made Secret Service Agent James West that much more realistic. Even Ross Martin was an experienced stage actor which made Secret Service Agent Artemus Gordon believable. The show was an amazing mix of spy, western and sci-fi television and also was the first TV show to cross-mix with other successful TV shows -  In episode #97, ""The Night of the Sabatini Death"", there was a tribute to the TV series, ""Gilligan's Island"" due to the fact that both Alan Hale Jr. (The Skipper) and Jim Backus (The Millionaire) were guest-starring on the episode. At the very end of the episode, Alan Hale's character said that he's going off to a deserted island for a vacation while a few notes of the Gilligan's Island theme song played in the background! That was cool to watch and again way ahead of it's time.
The show's theme as well as the spellbinding music within made the show that much more intriguing and exciting. The humor that was introduced at times also added to the success of the show.  On top of all this it introduced other stars into each episode. Robert Duvall, Don Rickles, Alan Hale Jr. Jim Backus, Boris Karloff, Victor Buono, Richard Prior, Jack Elam, Ray Walston, Willam Schallert,Agness Moorehead,Burgess Meredith,Sammy Davis Jr., Peter Lawford, Carol O'Connor,Ricardo Montalban,Suzanne Pleshette, John Astin, Martin Landau,Ed Asner,Ted Knight, Richard Anderson,Red West, Martin Brooks,Norman Fell and many more!!!Unfortunately however the movie remake of TWWW in 1999 starring Will Smith/Kevin Kline was an insult to not only the cast and characters of the original TV series but to the original series itself. However it now lives again on DVD and I suggest you check it out for yourself especially if you were a fan of the X-Files.",1200528000,24,2332,4.741379310344827
3281686,5,B00105307O,"This great series is finally available on DVD collections by seasons. ""The Wild, Wild West"" was one of the last successful Western television shows, coming on right as the era of the great Western TV show was coming to an end.

Its success was due to the fact that not only was it exciting and action-packed, but it was a curious meld of traditional Western action, espionage, science fiction, and high camp. It was in equal parts a product of its time as a Western, such as ""Gunsmoke"" and ""Bonanza,"" a semi-serious, lots of camp spy show like ""I-Spy,"" ""The Man From UNCLE,"" and ""The Avengers,"" science fiction like ""Star Trek"" and ""Voyage To The Bottom of the Sea,"" and sophomoric camp like ""Batman."" Robert Conrad and Ross Martin made a formidable team as US Secret Service agents James West and Artemis Gordon, as they travelled all over the West in their personal locomotive thwarting the schemes and intrigues of power-mad scientists and ruthless governments.

This show is near and dear to a lot of us who grew up in the mid to late 60's, and it is a joy to watch these episodes and remember that while the world was not a simple, carefree place, our living rooms could be while watching shows like ""The Wild, Wild West.""",1198108800,25,1227,4.598173515981735
3281687,5,B00105307O,"Witness if you will the fourth (1968-1969) and final season of ""The Wild Wild West"", still produced by Bruce Lansbury and that continues his updated and rugged treatment of the series with the paranoid political tales: ""The Night of the Doomsday Formula"" (guest starring Kevin McCarthy as the fanatical General Kroll) and ""The Night of the Pistoleros"" showing a future nations' conflict triggered by Mexican look-alikes of American military officers.

You will meet James West's new partners because Artemus Gordon is sent to Washington: secret agent/master of disguises Jeremy Pike (played by Charles Aidman) in four episodes (""The Night of the Camera"", ""The Night of Miguelito's Revenge"" that is the last Dr. Loveless' offering, ""The Night of the Pelican"", ""The Night of the Janus"" that is Charles Aidman's best performance as Baron Klaus Esterhauser and in which we catch a glimpse of James West's training academy), secret agent/master of disguises Frank Harper (played by William Schallert) in the two parter ""The Night of the Winged Terror"", and chemist/agent Ned Brown (played by Alan Hale Jr) in the gloomy ""The Night of the Sabatini Death"".

Moreover, we will again foray into the off-centered and the macabre fantasies as the Hammer Productions-like ""The Night of the Sedgewick Curse"" dealing with the theme of the fountain of youth, the tribute to the classic ""The Phantom of the Opera"" in ""The Night of the Diva"" (Robert Conrad even sings ""Buffalo Gals"" with his friends Richard Cangey and Red West) and a veiled reference to Conan Doyle's ""The Hound of the Baskervilles"" in ""The Night of the Bleak Island"", and two Jules Verne-oriented ones in ""The Night of the Kraken"" (which highlights a Captain Nemo type of character) and ""The Night of the Winged Terror, Part I & II"" (describing a secret organization of subversive mad scientists ruled by a hypercephalic mastermind).

One episode, directed in late season 3, depicts Robert Conrad's tragic fall while performing his stunt: ""The Night of the Fugitives"" (guest starring Simon Oakland).",1197331200,60,2051,5.171686746987952
3281688,5,B00105307O,"Well here we are, the final adventures of James T West and Artemus Gordon.  Hard to believe the series only ran 4 years.  Growing up in New York, the reruns ran aplenty during the 70s.  Sadly though, series co-star Ross Martin didn't get to appreciate the whole season as he was side lined by a heart attack.  Replacing him was a young Charles Aidman as Jeremy Pike who was as good at his trade as Arte (you get the impression he learned from the master himself) and others including Alan (the Skipper) Hale, John Dehner and William Schallert (Carson Drew, Nils Baris, Martin Lane) in a 2 part episode.  Their names got billed in the ending credits in the episodes they appeared in though Martin continued to appear in the opening credits for the remainder of the run.  Martin would recover to be able to do the sequel films made in 1979 and 1980, Wild Wild West Revisited and More Wild Wild West which according to [...] will sadly not be included in this set.  Fortunately, they are shown often enough on Encore Westerns so you can copy them yourself uncut (the prerecorded VHS tapes I believe are copy protected).  Martin passed away soon after making the sequel films, but I am sure if we looked up him up on the IMDB we would find a lot of good stuff under his name including a villain on Wonder Woman in 1977, and an attempt to bring Charlie Chan back just before or after More Wild Wild West. So get this last season, and appreciate 4 years of one of the shortest yet popular Western series of the 1960s.",1196640000,72,1511,4.410071942446043

3281828,4,B00105307O,"The fourth, and final, season of ""The Wild Wild West"" aired from September 1968 to April 1969.  The culture of the United States continued to evolve rapidly as younger people exerted a greater influence on it.  Westerns dominated television of the 1950's, but by the end of the 1960's it was apparent that westerns had run their course, though a few westerns continued to hang on.  Most westerns contained elements that aficionados of the genre considered traditional, but the format of ""The Wild Wild West"" permitted science fiction and fantasy.

The fourth season continued the formula of the preceding seasons, with a significant change due to illness.  The average episode featured at least two fight scenes, with James Tiberius West (Robert Conrad) usually winning the day.  In most episodes, Artemus Gordon (Ross Martin) would introduce a neat gadget, appear in disguise, or both.

The significant change was when Ross Martin had a heart attack and missed filming of nine episodes.  Martin's position (not his role) was filled by Charles Aidman, Alan Hale, and William Schallert.  The replacements brought their own style to the show, including a bit of humor when Alan Hale's character talks about going to a desert island and a snippet of music from ""Gilligan's Island"" is played.  That particular episode also featured Jim Backus, another ""Gilligan's Island"" regular.

In previous season, the general strategy was for James West to provide physical and strategic capabilities with Artemus's brains.  Because Artemus was often missing, James sometimes stepped in to fill in for Artemus's genius; sometimes the fill-ins did.  One thing that never failed in this series is West's fortuitous luck and the never-failing arrogance of the enemy.

In the final 24 episodes of the series, the show managed to introduce many different elements.  One episode appeared to borrow freely from ""The Hound of the Baskervilles.""  Another episode seemed inspired by ""The Phantom of the Opera.""  Other episodes seemed inspired by spy and science fiction shows of the 1950's and 1960's.  In ""The Night of the Sedgewick Curse,"" members of the Sedgewick family experience rapid aging.  There is a scene reminiscent of the wolf man and Dr. Jekyll where a family member ages rapidly in the course of seconds.  Other episodes featured deadly germs, an apparent kraken, and a gigantic tuning fork that is able to destroy houses.  ""The Night of the Juggernaut"" featured a steam-powered tank; a bit in advance of the first non-rail, mounted armored vehicle built around 1904.

The guest stars on ""The Wild Wild West"" were often entertainment industry veterans.  Comedian Harvey Korman, who was a regular on ""The Carol Burnett Show"" and was a lead character in ""Blazing Saddles,"" appeared as an enemy of the week.  Michael Dunn appeared as Dr. Miguelito Loveless, one of James West's most intelligent and creative foes, a final time.  Some of the many other guest stars, many of whom are no longer with us, were Kevin McCarthy, Pat Paulsen, Frank Campanella, Ted Knight, Sorrell Brooke, Jackie Coogan, pop singer Jackie DeShannon, who also sings on the episode, John Williams, Beverly Garland, whose last role was in ""Seventh Heaven,"" Nina Foch, Guy Stockwell, and Lana Wood.

After watching the twenty-four episodes twice, and looking back on this final season, I have mixed feelings about the fourth season.  Some of the plots seem remarkably similar to plots from the first three seasons.  I wondered whether I could go through the episodes from all four seasons and find categories of plot.  The ""old dark house"" appears in quite a few episodes, with at least three, maybe more, on islands.  Megalomaniacs were frequently the enemy of the week, though they were entertaining in their variety.  I sometimes had the feeling when watching the fourth season, which I did after re-watching the first three seasons again, that perhaps the show was winding down.  The creativity and cleverness seemed a bit less than in the previous seasons.  The show appeared, to me, to be at a turning point.  Had the show been renewed, it needed to be refreshed in some way to keep viewers watching.  Yet, it was sad, bittersweet, really, watching the final episodes, knowing that something magical was going to be lost when the show was cancelled.

Lobbying groups claimed there was too much violence on television, and for sure that violence was going to lead to bad things.  One of the television shows targeted as being too violent was ""The Wild Wild West.""  Watching the show forty-plus years later, the violence does not appear to me to be as bad as claimed.  Yes, there were multiple fights each week.  Yes, there were periodic gunfights and explosions.  Yet, in contrast to modern television, the show was not graphic and I consider the violence not only relatively tame, but also occasionally campy.

Sadly, as with seasons two and three, there are no extras.

I consider ""The Wild Wild West"" to be classic television.  The show was able to do things that most traditional westerns, and even most science fiction shows, were unable to do.  The plots were often inspired and creative.  The chemistry between Robert Conrad and Ross Martin was phenomenal and it was always entertaining to watch the pair together.  The show was frequently anachronistic, but the show turned what could have been a detriment into an advantage, playing fast and loose with history in an amusing and fun way.  Fans enjoy pointing out historical inaccuracies of the show, but they do so in the spirit of the show, which was to be entertaining.

""The Wild Wild West"" was one of a kind, and is unlikely to be duplicated.  Ross Martin and Robert Conrad were a great team.  While often formulaic, the formula worked, and we tuned in every week to see the gadgets, the characters, and just what kind of mess Artie and James would get into this week.  Here is a show that I would have watched for many more seasons, had it not been cancelled.

3281849,5,B00105307O,"""The Wild Wild West - Season Four"" was the final season of a fun TV program that was equal parts western drama and modern spoof.  Robert Conrad and Ross Martin return as US Secret Service agents James West and Artemus Gordon, out to save the American West of the 1870's from a variety of exotic and diabolical villains.  Actor Ross Martin suffered from health problems during the season.  His temporary replacements included William Schallart, Charles Aidman, Alan Hale Jr, and Pat Paulsen, each of whom added something positive to their episodes paired with Robert Conrad.

Season Four gives no indications the show was running out of steam.  Among the highlights: The return of long-time foe Dr. Loveless in ""The Night of Miguelito's Revenge; Jim West's return to the Secret Service Training Academy to smoke out a traitor in ""The Night of the Janus""; a nicely done gloss on the Sherlock Holmes classic ""The Hound of the Baskervilles"" in ""The Night of Bleak Island""; and a complicated favor for a dying criminal in ""The Night of the Sabatini Death.""

The television episodes have nicely transferred to DVD format, wild fights and James Bond spoofs intact; it is hard to believe these shows first aired forty years ago.  ""The Wild Wild West - Season Four"" is very highly recommended to fans of the series.",1254700800,2,1306,4.8558558558558556

3281881,5,B00105307O,"As with some of the other 60s shows I've reviewed (ie.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mission-Impossible-The-Complete-First-TV-Season/dp/B000HWZ4HU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mission Impossible - The Complete First TV Season</a>), I should acknowledge I was born long after this series ended and only caught some brief snippets in re-runs on TBS. But I'm a fan of the 60s spy genre, and decided to give The Wild Wild West a look.

This series is great fun, and credit goes to Robert Conrad and Ross Martin for creating great leading characters that have aged fairly well. Conrad plays James West exactly like what you'd want from a James Bond character in the old west - a dash of charm, charisma and authority, and a whole lot of toughness (more on that later). Ross Martin gets to indulge in a parade of interesting disguises and accents - a few of these likely wouldn't be p.c. today, but hey those were the times. Unfortunately Martin suffered a heart attack this year, forcing some fill-in guest agents (including Gilligan's Island star Alan Hale Jr).

The stories hit all your spy genre and western staples and then some - there's a pretty effects-heavy episode that features a giant kraken, which given 1960s effects you have to take with a few grains of salt. Michael Dunn's Dr. Loveless appears for the last time with a steam-powered robot, and another episode features a tank-like device called the juggernaut. The stories are played straight even when they venture into sci-fi territory, and at their best recall the old 'Republic Serial' style of adventure. There also seems to be an endless line of hot 60's actresses that guest star in every episode, including Lana Wood. It's almost like Robert Conrad had some clause in his contract that required at least one pretty girl per episode....

And last but not least, the action sequences are great. You'll find fights from today's shows may look more brutal and intense at first glance, but that's with a lot of clever photography and editing. In The Wild Wild West, you'll see one-take wide shots with people tossing each other over counters, tabletops, climbing onto 2nd-floor balconies and throwing others off, hurtling from staircases into crates, etc. It's amazing what Robert Conrad and the stunt team pulled off for a weekly TV show. What shows today let their actors take the same amount of risk?

If you have any interest at all in retro-TV, this is an extremely worthwhile set.

3281883,5,B00105307O,"In the audio commmentary, Robert Conrad says that the series ended because of the concern that too much violence was being shown on television at the time the 4th season was in progress, this being 1968-1969.  Sad, because everytime there is an uproar about something happening on TV, shows are cancelled and then within five years shows are worse than they were.

I like the series because I saw it to be differnt from the other westerns that were airing in the mid 1960's.  The mainstay of shows were human dramas set in a western US setting.  The Wild Wild West was free-for-all approach to a western, blending technology, science, science fiction, the occult, adventure, action, pretty young ladies, humor, and wonderful character portrayals by Ross Martin.  All of this wrapped up in a mystery to be unravelled as the show progress.

Though I haven't seen every episode of the season, it seems that the shows are starting to lose something compared to Season 1.  Some of the props and sets have been reused so much that they are instantly familiar, thus somewhat stale.  But the plots continue to be interesting.  Two of the most disappointing episodes are TOF Bleak Island and TOF Miguelitos Revenge.  Bleak Island was fine except the attempt at the end to turn the story back on itself seemed very corny.  Miguelitos Revenge was a very poor last episode for such a clever adversary as Dr. Loveless.  The plot lacked the intensity of the earlier Dr. Loveless episodes and became poor attempt to introduce a science fiction element.  The absence of Antionette and Voltaire was also disappointing.  To properly tie up the Dr. Loveless legacy, I would have expected to see the clever Dr. once again plotting to get control of California, which is what he wanted in his first appearance in Season 1.

Overall, Season 4 continues the tradition of the series.  I wouldn't say it is better or worse than other seasons.  The episodes still surprise me when I see the unique blend of elements.  The ladies are still incredibly beautiful and Jim and Arty keep finding their way into the lair of the bad guys and putting them out of business.",1234224000,,2137,4.760869565217392

3281886,4,B00105307O,"The Wild Wild West (or W3), was one of the most inovative TV series to ever see the small screen. This unique concept blended the popular ""James Bond"" style spy with the classic western (both were very popular on TV and film at the time). It hit the mark so well that it was to inspire a number of other shows decades later including the popular&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Adventures-of-Brisco-County-Jr-The-Complete-Series/dp/B000F7CMPE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Adventures of Brisco County Jr. - The Complete Series</a>
The fourth and final season of W3 is every bit as entertaining as the other three.
Personally, I was most impressed with the very well thought out action scenes and clever ideas for the ""secret gadgets"" that were used in the show. Fight scenes are well coordinated and entertaining with the actors actually doing all of their own stunts.

The whole series,(including this season), has a guest star list that reads as ""whos who"" of actors from television at that time. For example: Season four included Alan Hale jr. and a small nod to his role as The Skipper in the beloved Gilligan's Island TV series.

The only drawback with the fourth season was that the producers had wanted to make the series more ""hip"" for the younger crowd by adding a sort of surf music sound to the score. It does not always work and the music is not as good as the scoring of the first two seasons.

That said, the Fourth season of The Wild Wild West is a piece of entertainment worthy of watching. So grab some popcorn and sit down with a series that never ""Jumped the Shark"". It's a Wild, Wild ride.",1224288000,3,1657,4.996376811594203

You can tell that something was going on due to repeated scenes in different episodes. For example, there was a scene where Jim climbed down a mountain and I knew they had cut that from an earlier episode. It's also amusing watching his hair style change because they use scenes from earlier episodes to save money probobly. It adds to the feeling of 60's TV though and I'm not expecting this to be Citizen Kane.

3281890,5,B00105307O,One thing to note about this seasons episodes is the occasional stylish late 60's background music blended in with the never old Wild Wild West theme music. Racial integration of more black actors in episodes can also be found during this season as well in contrast to previous seasons. The women's movement had not yet taken root at this time and only small traces in attitude changes toward women can be detected in the episodes.  The difference in the episodes produced in the first season versus this forth season reminds those of us who lived it the pronounced changes that took place in our society during those four short years.,1217462400,,635,4.7727272727272725

Of course, when you add in Ross Martin's talent with his many character portrayals, it's a wonder to me why the show only lasted for only 4 seasons?!! Their arch nemesis Dr. Loveless,their luxurious train coach and their many ""high tech 19th century gadgets"" brought a special flavour to the show that stands apart from all those other cardboard generic westerns. In my opinion the 1st season was the best, and the others seasons were all good too, but not without a few flaws, such as the shows' endings were a little anti climatic and a little too predictable, but that's the way it was with most of the show in the 60's. But the chemistry that Arty & Jim created could never again be successfully copied, as evident of that awful remake movie that bombed big time a few years ago.",1210550400,4,1024,4.54054054054054
3281925,3,B00105307O,"I hadn't seen the show since it went off the air in 1969.
I've bought and viewed now all four seasons. In my memories the last season was the worst of them all. If you had have asked me almost 40 years ago,my rating would barely be two stars. However,I think being able to see them 1) in good quality colour(no one I knew owned a colour set back then) and 2)and on MY time instead of a networks'(over a period of several months),it has changed my oppinion slightly. Actually seeing any TV shows on home video can't help but change the dynamic;some for the good,some for the bad.
I found the positives few and far between but nonetheless they were/are there. Michael Dunn returns as everyone's favourite villain Dr. Loveless. I don't think any Wild,Wild West fan ever disliked Dunn for his performances.
It is well known about Ross Martin and his health problem that resulted in him missing alot of the last season filming. It's obvious they held some shows in abeyance and ran them later instead of in shooting order because of the negative feedback they got from the public at the time about his ""stand-ins"".He was able to return for a precious few eps,but was unable to appear on the last. But every appearance he made,made you miss him all the more when he wasn't there. He was sorely missed which says alot about the man and the good actor he was. And speaking of acting it seems to me that Robert Conrad improved in that department as this season wound down. He stepped up when he had to and I thought his character was becoming more fleshed out also. He came into his own. This is in sharp contrast to earlier seasons when his good looks carried him farther than the quality of his acting and the lean scripts given him.
Another positive is the marvellous stunt work by Robert Conrad and his fellow actors/stuntmen. As a bit of trivia you may or may not know,Red West  appeared in many Wild,Wild West eps as one of the actor/stuntmen. Red is well known to Elvis Presley fans as being part of Elvis' inner circle/entourage.
And speaking of stunt work you get to see a stunt Robert Conrad made that went terribly awry and by the look of it could have ended his career and/or life had it gone a little differently. It shows him jumping from a landing area at the top of a long flight of stairs. He grabs onto a chandelier but looses his grip and crashes to the ground. The camera  cuts about a second after his landing and they ""covered"" the scene and went on,but it shows you how dedicated Conrad was in the making of this show. He bumped alot of heads with the shows' brass and other actors and even his co-star Martin at times. He didn't get his ""tough-guy"" image for nothing. But no one can ever say he didn't give his all during the making of this show and it's one of the reasons this show has remained a fan favourite since its' debut.
On the other side of the coin there is ALOT to say. The first shot must go to the man who had the unenviable task of first stepping in for Ross Martin when he fell ill. Charles Aidman was the worst choice for Martins' part. He simply tried too hard but came up short every time. He also had a terribly annoying ""the-cat-that-ate-the-canary"" smile on his face almost all the time. Then William Schallert stepped in for a bit. Schallert I didn't mind as much but he seemed to go to the opposite extreme of Aidman and was kind of a milquetoast. And of course two ""Gilligans Island"" refugees stepped in in the same ep and that was Jim Backus and Alan Hale Jr. And speaking of ""Gilligans Island"",the opening of the ep ""The Night of Bleak Island"" is the same opening from ""Gilligans Island"",the one showing the boat being pitched about in a storm!
It's obvious the budget for this season was next to non existent as the locations were becoming eerily similar,from ep to ep. In fact San Francisco was visited ALOT in this final season...must have been for the fresh ocean air! In fact any city that had a waterfront looked alot like San Francisco.
Footage was also pulled right out of a season three ep to make up time in one of this seasons' eps. It concerned Conrad getting put down a perilous deep hole and landing on a ledge which is close to breaking away. Same precarious position and he extracates himself exactly the same way because...it's the same footage.
I could go on but I'm sure you get the picture.
However this season,again like the others,has been remastered and most eps here are in good,crisp colour and haven't been seen this well ever.
In conclusion, there are alot of negatives which will be of concern to some and little to others,and visa versa. But there are also some positives and I think it's worth getting. When all is said and done and what matters most,is that Martin and Conrad helped create two unforgettable TV characters that have endured and stood the test of time. As long as you keep that in mind when you are watching this final season,it will help you overlook the drawbacks that creep in from time to time.",1210118400,22,4987,4.455142231947484

3281961,5,B00105307O,"I watched the original running of The Wild Wild West when I was a kid. I hated the fourth season because Artemis Gordon was not in a few of the episodes. When I watch them in later years as reruns, I started to enjoy them. Now in DVD I really like them. The fourth season mix of Ross Martin with guest stars because of Martin's health actually was a great mix. It allowed Robert Conrad and the script to be adjusted to the guest stars. Some of the episodes were similar to third season plus some more mysterious and suspenseful shows such as Sedgewick Curse, Bleak Island and the Plague. Another great episode Is the Night of the Fugitive where West and Gordon tackle the syndicate (Wow! in the 1870's). Overall good transfer with some grainy parts but forget about the details when you get classic television shows at its BEST! Buy it now!",1207785600,4,840,4.461038961038961

The quality of the reproduction on this series is terrific and not having to see any commercials is even better.  If you are a Jim West or Artemus Gordon fan - this is for you!

3281965,5,B00105307O,"This was by far the best season in WWW and unfortunately, the last thanks to CBS. This set has my favorite episodes: The Night of Fire and Brimstone, The Night of the Sedgewick Curse, The Night of the Sabatini Death among several others. Some of these were quite intimidating for a 10 year old at the time. Definitely a must have for WWW fans.",1206403200,3,343,4.375
3281966,4,B00105307O,"The final season of the Wild Wild West. The reason was not due to ratings. In fact, the show which was shown on CBS on Friday evenings was consistently high in the Nielsens. In a reflection of the times, worried about war and questioning whether kids should have toy guns to play with the show fell to a very biased axe.
The Fourth season features a few differences. In the first few episodes there is a distinct change in the background music that suggests the late sixties nightclub instead of the 1870 bar. The plots tend to revolve around eccentrics or eccentric countries trying to cause a national disaster or solve something at the expense of everyone else.
The sets are incredibly more colorful than the previous season and the plot lines tend to pick up in mid performance of action, as opposed to the old days when some explosion would occur and we get to see the reasons unravel.  There is also a significant change in the supporting actors. Although the series always featured a good amount of roles for minorities, there are more in this years twenty four episodes than in any prior series.
Many reviewers mention the fact that Ross Martin had a heart attack that caused him to miss many episodes in this particular season, but I remember that the general replacements of a steady Agent Pike and a host of guest stars adequately filled in while Mr. Martin was recovering. Pat Paulson, a well known comedian who became a star of the moment after his ""Laugh In"" roles was brought in as a ""special"" government agent and is among the many who perhaps are now forgotten, yet there presence here brings a moment to remember.
In the end, as with many television shows of the era, the series is left hanging and just like ""Lost in Space"" with the Robinson family, we are left to wonder what happened to our heroes. Oh well, but it was an exciting ride wasn't it!?",1206144000,9,1868,4.559523809523809
3281967,4,B00105307O,"The hijinx continues. [...] Mildly disappointed in the video transfer, which is quite grainy in some episodes,especially considering what a superior job is done with the other 3 seasons- (started by watching TNOT fugitives). Some trivia. Check out how some scenes from this episode are actually stolen form TNOT Jack O'diamonds (Jim going into the mountains and pulling out his telescope) Must have cut the budget this season. Also funny how JTW's hair is parted on both sides sometimes in the same episode. All in all great fun.",1205971200,2,529,5.0227272727272725
3281968,5,B00105307O,"Another great season of a unique, entertaining show that is like no other. Each show offers interesting plot lines, great music(love that theme song), great locations, and a sense of humor mixed in the dangerous antics of our favorite secret service agents. And at the end of each show, you always feel happy that Jim and Arte completed their mission and get to relax on the train. We're lucky to have this series on DVD so we can watch any of their adventures whenever we want.",1205884800,,478,4.569767441860465
3281969,5,B00105307O,"The 4th and final season of TWWW.  Affected by the anti-violence kick at the time -- drastically toning down the action in the later episodes and missing, for much of the season, Ross Martin due to a heart attack, nonetheless, still much to cheer about.  The spy craze that began with the theatrical release of FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE IN 1963 winding down. THE MAN FROM U.N.C.L.E. AND I SPY had both been cancelled the previous season.  MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE & GET SMART would last a couple of more seasons. Robert Conrad would go on the next season to work for Jack Webb on THE DA (a series inspired by Vincent Buliousi(?), the man who prosecuted Charles Manson) -- to be followed by ASSIGNMENT VIENNA (the late Roy Schieder starred in the pilot), the pilot (which aired as a tv movie but never made it to a series) THE ADVENTURES OF NICK CARTER, BLACK SHEEP SQUADRON, A MAN CALLED SLOANE, HIGH MOUNTAIN RANGERS and probably a few inbetween I can't recall.  For Ross Martin, there would be a lot of guest shots on various tv shows but never another series.  The heart attack had left to expensive to insure for a weekly show. (Though Martin would do a never sold pilot for a Charlie Chan series that raised the ire of the Asian American community at the time).  It was fun to see the both of them again in the early 80's reunion films but it was all tongue-in-cheek and not at all the same.  A moment in tv history never to be repeated.",1205884800,2,1433,4.425855513307985
3281970,4,B00105307O,"The fourth season of ""The Wild Wild West"" found the series returning to form with more fantastic stories than the third season but the show fell victim to increasing criticism about the level of violence in TV shows. Coupled with decreasing ratings for the series the show was cancelled by CBS. To make matters more difficult it was a very good but uneven season due partially to the absence of Ross Martin who suffered a heart attack midway through the production schedule. Martin and Conrad had a unique chemistry which helped sell even the weakest episodes of the series coasting along the action and charm of its stars.

The producers solution was admirable and smart--Gordon was in Washington on ""special assignment"" communicating periodically with West via notes and voice transcriptions while he was ""away"". A series of guest stars from the well known Victor Buno (who played a villain previously on the series), Alan Hale, Jr. (""Gilligan's Island""), Pat Paulsen (""Laugh In""), William Schallert and the wonderfully underrated character actor Charles Aidman (who appeared in such shows ""The Twilight Zone""--both the original and as narrator for the last season of the 1985 revival of the show--, ""Dallas"" and the film ""Twilight's Last Gleaming"") who appeared in fourth consecutive episodes as Jeremy Pike.

The fourth season started off strong and featured a parade of well known guest stars including Ted Knight (""The Mary Tyler Moore Show""), Harvey Korman (""The Carol Burnett Show""), singer Jackie DeShannon, Jim Backus ( who appears in the same episode as his former ""Gilligan's Island"" co-star Alan Hale. The episode has a very clever tongue-in-cheek reference to the other series). Other guest stars included Kevin McCarthy (""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"") boxer Floyd Patterson.

The multi-talented Michael Dunn returned in his final episode as Dr. Loveless and, although memorable as always, the episode was a bit lackluster compared to his previous appearances in the series.

This set as with the previous ones is packaged in thin packs with two discs per thin pack. The final season had 24 episodes and we get all 24 in their original uncut versions. Episode information is on the back of each thin pack along with a brief plot synopsis and some of the guest stars. The design of the package and photos used are, as always, first class.

As always, Paramount-CBS does a magnificent job with a sharp transfer with the rich, saturated colors the show was known for. Detail and image sharpness are both very good although there are a couple of soft spots that appear now and again. The audio sounds terrific with a nice mono transfer free of hiss and the audio artifacts that you generally expect from something that has had No Noise applied to its soundtrack. The music is, as always, bold and memorable.

The music leads me to the major drawback of the set--no extras. While we get all 24 uncut episodes, the show could stand to have a few minor extras produced for it. We do get previews for John Wayne films on DVD but nothing related to ""The Wild Wild West"". For example, a featurette on actor Ross Martin who had a storied career in television, film and on stage would have been nice. Although star Robert Conrad would go on to star in other TV shows (including ""Baa Baa Black Sheep"" another show with a repetitive title), Martin confined his work to guest work with a brief reoccurring role in ""Hawaii Five-O"" during its 1978/9 season. He was a talented, versatile actor who was sorely missed after his death in 1981. He did appear in the two ""The Wild Wild West"" TV movies produced by CBS and plans were in place to revive the series but were scuttled when Martin passed away.

Another featurette that would have been worthwhile would have been on Robert Conrad's storied career. Conrad who was born Konrad Robert Falkowski often did his own stunts working with the stunt coordinator and, in fact, was seriously injured during one stunt. He was an honorary member of the Stuntmen's Association. Let's not overlook the talented overlooked actor the late  Michael Dunn as well.

Another featurette that would have been good (CBS when you do the Blu-ray for this series I hope you're paying attention to these notes) for this set would have been one on the incidental music which often incorporated a unusual instruments including middle-eastern ones (clearly the 60's music scene was influential in the scoring).

A couple of commentary tracks from the surviving cast members (Conrad is evidently ill at the time of this writing so sent your good wishes and prayers his way) including Harvey Korman and Kevin McCarthy would have been nice as well.

What we do get is marvelous. I'm happy that CBS has continued to put out the last season of the show but disappointed that they didn't think it worthwhile (or weren't given the budget) to put some extras on this final season saluting the cast, crew and popularity of the show. Nevertheless, this is an essential season and I personally think even though it is a bit uneven due to Ross Martin's absence, it was a fine return to form for the most part. I'd highly recommend the 4th season of ""The Wild Wild West"".",1205798400,8,5181,4.856172140430351

8237086,5,B00105307O,"As others have noted, this, the series' last season, was the one in which Ross Martin's near-fatal heart attack forced his absence from nine of twenty-four episodes.

Michael Dunn makes his final, triumphant appearance as Dr. Loveless. At this writing the set is priced in the $12 range: a bargain. Sound and picture quality are quite good; no production or packaging problems. None of this series' seasons received the lavish treatmentextras, commentaries, memorabiliaas its first.
