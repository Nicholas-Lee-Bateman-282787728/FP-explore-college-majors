YOKOHAMA DEATHMATCH

Spoilers

Unfortunately  most of the undercard is only shown in highlights. This is a huge shame since these matches were great including a huge womens tag match and some familiar faces from the WWF in the 90s. So I will be laying out what matches are shown in full here.

1.[MASK VS HAIR MATCH]HAYABUSA VS MR. GANOSUKE-this is an excellent match with both men looking great. Hayabusa is phenomenal and his high speed flying assault is wonderful to watch. Ganosuke uses his power moves more so to try and beat Hayabusa down. Hayabusa wins in a great match and I love the music that plays after his win and the aftermath . Also the commentary team can get a little annoying.

2.[TEXAS TORNADO 6 MAN MATCH]TERRY FUNK, CACTUS JACK & MIKE AWESOME VS WING KANEMURA, MASATO TANAKA & ATSUSHI ONITA-excellent and crazy match right here. All six guys battle all over the place from the ring to the crowd. There are all kinds of spots and weapons here and an awesome bomb through a table. Tanaka and them get the win in a very hard fought battle.

3. MEGUMI KUDO VS SHARK TSUCHIYA-this is a fun match with both ladies looking really good here. This match is a barbed wire match with it as the ropes and on the outside of the ring. Also we get those famous explosions that Japan was known for. Good match with Kudo getting beat down most of the time only to make comebacks. She ends up winning her retirement match here.

BONUS

1. TAKA MICHINOKU VS RICKY FUJI-no commentary on this match and that may be a good thing depending on if you liked it on the main feature. This match features one of my all time favorites Taka Michinoku. This is a very short match but a good one while it lasts. Taka of course comes out the victor here in a fast paced and quick addition to the DVD.

Over all I would say that the matches that you do get to see are very much worth getting this for but I don't understand why the entire card was not shown in its entirety. With that said you get a few bonus features but it doesnt make up for the lack of matches here in full.",1426032000,,2069,4.325581395348837
7938503,4,B00005J762,"Great show and included one of
The best woman's matches / deathmatches of all time in a exploding ring match plus cactus jack and terry funk do battle caution this tape is clipped during mid card
The main attractions aren't tho great show classic must have !",1399507200,,258,4.51063829787234
7938504,4,B00005J762,"The two main events on this DVD make it a worthwhile purchase but the rest of the matches are all clipped and more like highlight reels. The commentary is TERRIBLE and the commentators don't have any idea what most moves are called.

I do recommend this DVD because watching two women fight in an exploding barbed-wire death match is something you may never forget.",1361318400,,365,4.703125
7938505,1,B00005J762,"the first FMW video i got and the last... WTF is this????

the four(ya thats right more than half of the whole show) first matches were about twenty(20) seconds long.

then we have Hayabusa who i have heard so much about vs. Gonosuke

Atcually not horrible but in TNA it would be less than average let alone WWe. O by the way horrible stupid lame ending with hayabusa telling gonosuke to change his life.... really stupid **`(of five)

Six man tornado tag match no rules

kinda cool actually a cool match, i was expecting more like this. Anyway it was a treat. (****)

barbed wire no rope electric crap match- to women- Jino vs. Shark or something like that..... STUPID MATCH i found it too slow going in Fast Forward. basiclly the entire match is just two women trying to put each other in barbed wire with fake explosions... i know it sounds cool but it really isnt.................... Horrible(*1/2 for the fire spot only)

 Do not get this lame stupid video it really isn't worth it(unless u want to belive the profigahnda)",1103068800,,1027,4.604395604395604
7938506,2,B00005J762,"I have watched this DvD and must say that for anyone who is a fan of TRUE Hardcore wrestling they should get this. For those unfamiliar with FMW, it is the TRUE Originator in Hardcore, Extreme Wrestling. It was the first to have the King of the Deathmathc Tournamet. It originated using lightbulbs, electrified barbwire, and EXPLOSIVES!!! The matches on the tape are some of the most extreme I have ever witnessed and I have been watching and following wrestling for 20 years. If you like Extreme and want to see the Real Mick Foley, AKA CACTUS JACK, and witness one the greatest wrestlers in the world before his injury, HAYABUSA, then Get this tape because if you don't then you are truly missing out.",1007769600,3,703,4.632
7938507,5,B00005J762,"I know this has not been released yet, but I know what event it is from, reading the statment in the last lot of FMW DVD's. It is not the IWA ""King Of The Death Match"" like eveyone thinks its is, but it does still feature Cactus Jack and Terry Funk. What this tape is, is a copy of the Japan only released:
FMW Yokohama Arena ""Megumi Kudo Retirement Show"" Commercial Tape 4/29/97
The matches at the event were:
Ricky Fuji & Ricky Morton v Hido & Dragon Winger
Crypt Keeper & Flying Kid Ichihara v Tetsuhiro Kuroda & Nanjyo Hayato
Koji Nakagawa v Katsutoshi Niiyama
Kaori Nakayama & Michiko Omukai & Chikako Shiratori & Mizuki  Endo & Yoko Ikeda v Miss Mongol & Eagle Sawai & Crusher Maedomari & Michiko Nagashima & Lioness Asuka
Kodo Fuyuki & Jado & Gedo v Hisakatsu Oya & Headhunters *FMW 6 Man Street Fight Tag Titles*
Hayabusa v Mr. Gannosuke *Hair vs. Mask*
Atsushi Onita & Masato Tanaka & W*ING Kanemura v Cactus Jack & Gladiator & Terry Funk *Texas Western Street Fight Death Match*
Megumi Kudo v Shark Tsuchiya *No Rope Barbed Wire Electrified Death Match*
I'm not sure which of these matches made it onto the tape (The info given says there are only 7 matches in total make it onto the DVD)
The event was a masterpiece with the last match being a true great. This one I know is on the tape, as well as the one featuring Cactus Jack, and also the match with Hayabusa - as the info in the last batch of FMW DVD's talked of Hayabusa being unmasked, along with the return of Cactus and Terry, aswell as the retirement match of Kudo.)
