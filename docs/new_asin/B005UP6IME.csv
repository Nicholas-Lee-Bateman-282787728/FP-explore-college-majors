4894459,1,B005UP6IME,I didn't not like this at all.  All she had you do we're a bunch of pelvic tilts.  Very boring.,1365206400,,95,3.7
4894460,5,B005UP6IME,"Following successful lower back disc surgery sixteen months ago (wheeled into the hospital on day one and walked out day two!)I did three months of physical therapy. Wanting to improve even more and finding no Feldenkrais instructors in the Mountain State, I purchased Shara Ogin's DVD. What a treat!!I Her instructions are gentle, easy to follow, and leave my body feeling free and relaxed after each session!!",1342396800,27,411,5.149253731343284
4894461,5,B005UP6IME,"Although the movements in this video are extremely gentle, and one would at first doubt that it would have any impact, it is really quite surprising that I did actually feel immediate changes.  With minimal equipment needed, listening to the calm voice, and music and directions, tension in my neck and shoulders decreased and I was so much more aware of my body parts and how they are so often tight and stressed.  I would never have thought about how putting a cork in my mouth while doing the movements  would instantly have the effect of releasing tension in my jaw, but it did!  I'd certainly recommend this video for anyone looking for a gentle introduction to the Feldenkrais method of body awareness in order to reduce pain or tension.",1327276800,39,743,4.6923076923076925
8487010,2,B005UP6IME,Since its in German - its difficult.... if you don't speak german - but the concept is great.,1527292800,,93,4.222222222222222
8487011,5,B005UP6IME,"It works.  No annoying music, pleasant voice, good instructions.  Did I say the exercises work for easing pain?",1457740800,2,111,5.111111111111111
8487012,2,B005UP6IME,"Sound routine.
Problem is technical - originally not recognized at all - multiple computers with concern about possible British or European formatting.
Have only had it recognized as a DVD once.",1443398400,,194,5.290322580645161
8487013,4,B005UP6IME,Video was very good till you got to the almost the end and it stuck . I tried it on other players and it stuck in the same place. But what it taught was wonderful and has helped me a lot!,1442793600,,187,3.5853658536585367
8487014,5,B005UP6IME,"This is an incredible process for improving all over health, posture and all body movement.  Brilliant and worthwhile.",1433808000,2,118,5.555555555555555
8487015,5,B005UP6IME,"I feel fabulous!  We need more DVDs like this to make the Feldenkrais lessons available to people who can't get to a teacher.  The one star review made me think that maybe some kind of explanation of the method is needed for those without any experience with Feldenkrais.  Having had the opportunity to watch many Feldenkrais therapy sessions and experience a couple myself, I knew the results we were after.  I'm not sure I would even use the term ""pelvic tilt"" to describe the movement.  It was more like ""very slightly and gently mobilizing the tailbone"".",1433462400,6,558,4.770833333333333
8487016,5,B005UP6IME,"I like the Feldenkrais ""stretching"" method and logic. I had pulled a muscle doing Yoga and this was a great substitute while healing. Now I plan on doing it in conjunction with Yoga. Definitely something for people with problems to look into.",1398556800,5,242,4.785714285714286
8487017,4,B005UP6IME,"A good selection of exercises for the back, neck and arm.  Gently guided through the process.  Would have been nice to have some longer pauses though to work thru each phase.",1388448000,8,174,4.580645161290323
8487018,5,B005UP6IME,"Very helpful, relaxing and soothing.  I could feel my spine come into alignment as soon as I started the gentle exercises.  Instructor's voice is clear and calming.  Video enhances the instruction. It's amazing what a little of the right and gentle movement can do for your body.  When you're finished with the DVD, you feel relaxed, yet energized.  What is really nice is that after going through the DVD a couple of times, you can replicate some of the exercises in a few spare minutes on your own.",1382054400,16,500,4.636363636363637
8487019,5,B005UP6IME,"Very easy to follow and not only gives you a relaxing physical realighment, but also a mental one too! SF",1366243200,12,105,4.3
