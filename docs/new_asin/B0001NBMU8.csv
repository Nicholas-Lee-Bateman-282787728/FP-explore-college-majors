8015053,5,B0001NBMU8,"Once again the fine people at Bandai Entertainment bring us another superb volume of the Big O series.
In these three episodes we start to see the rest of the second season start to wind up.  Rodger starts to remember more of his past.  We get a glimpse of Angel's Past.  R. Dorothy seems to undergo a few changes.  We even get to see the many improvements on Rodger's ""mansion"" as he fends off an attack from... Beck (forced by Paradigm's Gordon Rosewater, even Beck has a few rules of villainy).
We get to see another of Big O's abilities.  An old foe from Season 1 returns.  A son betrays his father... all in three episodes.
Like Volume 2 before it they leave you hanging with... well I don't want to spoil the surprise now do I?
All in all this Volume is a must see for any Big O fan, any one new to this series I would recommend you start with Season one else you will not completely understand what is going on.
For Parents, this Series I would recommend for ages 12 and up.  Complex plotlines, epic robot battles, lots of guns, minor blood to show damage (no Gushers), and minor adult moments (a kiss or two every once and awhile).
All in all it's worth every penny.
Oh, and the review from The Critic from Sacramento, CA, I have no Idea what anime he's writing about, but I do know it is NOT the Big O II Vol. 3",1088294400,2,1320,4.1936758893280635
8015054,5,B0001NBMU8,"This would be the most highly acclaimed anime ever made, with great storyboards and the pride of a young man who does the immposible to find out what happened to Earth, Volume II is when O meets Jack Fasdal, the King of Stanton Isle who gives him the weapons he need to recruit the perfect alliance and defeat the reigning ruler of Earth, Kowata Homyo. My highest rated DVD ever, this is a definite must see for tense action anime lovers, indeed a collectors item. 10/10.",1083110400,2,471,4.488372093023256
