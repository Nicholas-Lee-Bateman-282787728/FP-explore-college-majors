7847497,2,6303467059,"Even the presence of Fred ""The Hammer"" Williamson can't save this turkey of a movie, WHITE FIRE, starring Robert Ginty.  Ginty's character, Bo, and Bo's sister Ingrid, are orphans in the debt of an older friend; when they wee children, he saved them from the Russian army.
As adults, they plot with their friend to steal diamonds from the Turkish diamond mine where Ingrid works.  Somehow, they become aware of a legendary huge diamond, the ""White Fire"" diamond, which exists in the mine.  Only late in the plot does Williamson's character enter the movie, as a bounty hunter trying to capture one of the main characters.  At this point, the inept cinematography, laughable dialogue, and confused plotting have all but destroyed the movie.  You have to wonder if Fred Williamson even got paid for his work in this movie.
Robert Ginty's character winces throughout the movie like he's got hemorrhoids, and he recites his dialogue as though it doesn't matter one whit what he says.
The female lead's portrayal of Ingrid is unremarkable, save one or two nude scenes.  Bo lusts after Ingrid openly; what's going on here?  They're siblings, for crying out loud.  You have to see it to believe it; I can't truly convey how creepy the scene feels.
One example of the muddled amateurism at work:  part of the plot concerns the death of a major character, though I won't spoil it by telling you which one.  Then, another actor mysteriously appears (astonishingly resembling the newly departed) and is trained and modified (through plastic surgery; we all know the Turks have top-notch cosmetic surgeons!) to become a near-replica of (and assume the identity of) Character-A, even though the diamond-theft plot doesn't rely on appearances at all.
If you feel the need to see all of Fred Williamson's films, you won't want to miss this one.  Unfortunately, this is also MST3K material, for the pathetic dialogue and overall abysmal quality.
