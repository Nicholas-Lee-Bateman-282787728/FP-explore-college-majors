7850035,5,6303499198,"Some people are always looking for conspiracies or myths that go against the grain of conventional thinking or at least circumstantial evidence.  The death of Adolf Hitler is one of those.  Most people assumed he died in his little ol' bunker while the Russians were closing in on him in Berlin.  But lack of concrete evidence for many years sprouted many theories that he lived for many years afterwards plotting his comeback.  This 51-minute documentary sets all of that straight once and for all, and does a great job of explaining why it took so long to unravel.  It also tells a heartbreaking story that relates to Hitler seemingly needing to take everything around him down with him when he finally kicked in.
Yes, it's true he died in his bunker, which is not giving anything away, as that is what the evidence known pointed to for many years.  Those that persist in a different story should also keep in mind that the man was a complete physical and mental wreck at the end, and wouldn't have been long for this world even if he had slithered away.  This documentary tells the story of how the Post-WWII Soviet regime, with it's closed communist society for many years, pretty much kept things under wraps, or at least impeded completing the investigation.  The story centers on the Russian woman who spearheaded finally getting it done, and it unravels like a good detective story.
Now for the heartbreaking part, which is ironic given the circumstances of this being the end of countless heartbreaks and atrocities over Europe in that six-year period.  You see, it was not only Hitler and his mutton-headed bimbo Eva Braun in the bunker, but also some of his closest aids, which included Joseph Goebbels.  And his wife.  And for some explicable reason, their six children.  You can guess what happens here, but I'll leave it for your perusal.",1043452800,,1852,4.77115987460815
