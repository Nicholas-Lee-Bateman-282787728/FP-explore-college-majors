2840553,2,B000QUEQ3G,"My kids can watch this for about ten minutes before they wander off & lose interest.  It's so commercial & fakey that it doesn't hold them.  The characters don't really play their instruments and all the music and singing is canned so they can lipsynch to it (pretty badly).  My kids go more for artists who actually play the instruments and don't rely on kitschy costumes & over-done choreography. They much prefer the Laurie Berkner Band or They Might Be Giants. Oh, well.  It beats a lot of the other tripe that's out there for kids.",1194739200,,536,4.552083333333333

2840612,5,B000QUEQ3G,"Our daughter's daycare teacher introduce the kids to the Doodlebops. She loved it so much she started to ask for it at home. Unfortunately it was not available through any of the streaming services I use e.g. Amazon, Netflix. I ordered three of these Doodlebops DVD's from Amazon. Based on how often she asks to watch them I think we have a winner!

Parent note: I was unfamiliar with the Doodlebops. Apparently they were available in the US on the Disney Channel at one time but no longer. The content is toddler friendly with lots of lively music. This is not an animated show. The characters are brightly costumed, energetic humans! The three I purchased are below. They are all similar, at least from an adult perspective!

2840655,5,B000QUEQ3G,"If you have seen the tv series, then you know what it is about. The DVD comes with four episodes and some additional features. My 1.5 year old girl loves to watch the episodes over and over again. She sings with them, dances with them, finds a new element every time. I have to confess that I was not ""attracted"" to the Doodlebops the first time I saw them, but they grew on me. Especially after watching how thrilled my daughter is every time they are on! It has worked for us, but I have seen kids who could not care less for them, so go figure.",1211241600,,547,4.121495327102804
