8425194,3,B004DEFKNG,"The Utah Trail, 1938 film

The Pecos Kid demands respect. Tex enters the office of the Border States Rail Road to see the president, Tom Jeffers. Hiram Slaughter, the Superintendent, tells him there was a change in plans. But Tex will continue his assignment to halt the Ghost Train. Tex and his crew meet the villains who are loading cattle onto the Ghost Train, there is an exchange of gunfire. The train leaves. There is another song. Slaughter meets his henchmen and tells them to get rid of the Pecos Kid - he knows too much.

Tex plays his guitar for the new president, Miss Sally Jeffers. Texs pals are told to look for him. [They provide comedy.] All three go to the Oasis saloon. Tex is told to leave town by Badger, there is another fist fight. Tex wins again! They quickly ride away. Tex brushes his horse and sings again. Ananias and PeeWee report the death of Mason and the loss of his cattle. Badgers men modify the railroad tracks to use a spur. They find the Ghost Train and move on Badgers men. Then they start to move the train. This is reported to Slaughter.

Badger explains his scheme to blame the Pecos Kid. Slaughter tells the Sheriff the story. The Sheriff arrests the Pecos Kid and his pals. Tex sings another song in jail. Sheriff Clayton is working with Tex to catch Slaughters gang. The bank was robbed. The Sheriff forms a posse to pursue the robbers on the Ghost Train. There is shooting for action. Men fall. Tex gets on a boxcar and goes forward to attack Slaughter at the engines controls and punches him off the train! This ends this case. Tex sings a song to Miss Sally. A happy ending.

The many songs makes this a horse opera, but it lacks the dances seen in some other movies. The plot were undercover investigators masquerade as crooks has been used before, as well as the respectable citizen who is the secret head of a gang of outlaws. This is at best an average story. Did this echo the events of the 1930's where banks failed?",1508716800,,2140,4.43765903307888
8425195,4,B004DEFKNG,"1938's Utah Trail was the last of twelve films Tex Ritter made for Grand National Films; money problems at the studio soon resulted in Tex's move over to Monogram (where he would star in twenty films over the course of the next three years).  Utah Trail was built on the same template as Tex's previous films, but there were some key differences in the details this time around.  When Tex - accompanied, of course, by his comic relief sidekicks Ananias (Horace Murphy) and Pee Wee (""Snub"" Pollard) - comes riding into town this time, he's singing atop a railroad car rather than a horse; conversely, the big chase scene at the end also involves a train rather than bad guys on horses, which means you won't get to see Tex leap and drag some hombre off his horse at the climax.  Tex's character is also a little different here - but only because he's playing the part of a notorious outlaw and trying not to blow his cover as a Ranger sent to investigate the strange goings-on of a ""ghost train"" plaguing the town.  He's rather pushy and rude at first, even to the little sweetie he's trying to protect.  The gal's father is the local railroad owner who called Tex in to help, but the poor old guy's dead by the time Tex arrives.  Among the bad guys, here's a familiar face gunning for Tex as soon as he hops off the train.  Charles King, who plays an hombre named Badger, made a living out of being beaten up and bested by Tex Ritter in film after film.

The best part of this film is the singing, as Tex was in fine voice indeed.  Tex not only serenades a little lady, he also serenades White Flash, his good old four-hoofed pal (and the only horse in this movie fast enough to run down a moving train); as an extra bonus, he delivers another classic jailhouse lament designed to perturb Ananias and Pee Wee, who just never seem to enjoy sitting around in the pokey the way Tex does.

All things considered, this isn't a ""must see"" Tex Ritter film, but it's still quite enjoyable - and notable as his last film for the studio that first brought this beloved singing cowboy to the big screen.",1109116800,,2092,4.396373056994818
