8529353,5,B008OML3WU,"After suffering from daily headaches for over 2 years, and having been told they were anything from migraines to stress headaches when I knew they were muscular in nature as they went away from massages and did not go away from migraine medication,and only temporarily abated from painkillers, I finally stumbled across this DVD while searching for a book on stretching one day and decided to give it shot. Nothing else was working so I figured it couldn't hurt.

I previewed the entire DVD and watched all of the information. It made sense. Then I made a big mistake. I did all of the exercises the first day, and the first time I tried them. Don't do that! It won't make your headaches go away any sooner or speed up the process, all it will do is make your neck and shoulders very sore! Proceed at the pace recommended in the DVD. Do the exercises as recommended. The therapist recommends that they be done 5-7 times daily, 3 times each. I probably ended up doing them 4 times daily, 3 times each for the first month. I now continue to run through the exercise cycle 1 repetition each morning, and my headaches are GONE!

If I understood the DVD correctly, the therapist explained that most headaches are generated in the trapezious muscles (I might be over-simplifying this - it's been a couple of months since I played it). When I first started this program, my muscles were tight and knotted, now through daily stretching, the knots are gone. I still have tight muscles on the side of my neck, but I am able to stretch out the discomfort. Most importantly, my head doesn't hurt. Any time I feel like a headache is coming on, I immediately stretch, and the headache does not occur. The stretch sequence takes about 5 minutes to run through, so it's not time consuming, and is now a part of my morning routine.

At the time I purchased this, Amazon suggested it be purchased with ""Stretch Away Shoulder Pain"" by the same author. Although the content is geared toward shoulder pain issues (which I also tend to have) the exercises are the same. I would pick one or the other for purchase if you are considering both.

The DVD format is easy to follow, and informative. I found it easy to skip to follow, and you are able to use the menu to skip ahead to the exercises without having to watch all of the content again.",1345939200,6,2320,4.503562945368171
