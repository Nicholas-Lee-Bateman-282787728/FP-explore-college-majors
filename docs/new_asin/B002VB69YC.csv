They have many adventures with all of their other friends; a set of Geese triplets, an very friendly alligator named Jasper, Edwina the elephant, Hazel the squirrel, and Thunder the Rhino!! There is a lesson to be learned in every episode and its very entertaining. I really wished they'd make more children's' shows like this!!",1420416000,,442,4.67948717948718
