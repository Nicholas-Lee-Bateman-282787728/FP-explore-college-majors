8025635,5,B0002BBKEM,"Dr. Bragg Stockton is a legend in the baseball world. He has coached at every level from Little League to High School to College, including the well-respected programs at University of Houston and San Jacinto Junior College. He has trained over 10,000 young men in his summer baseball camps. And over 80 of his players went on to play professional baseball.
This series of videos captures many valuable nuggets of knowledge that Dr. Stockton learned and taught throughout the years. I still review the whole series every year and rediscover things to share with my teams.
