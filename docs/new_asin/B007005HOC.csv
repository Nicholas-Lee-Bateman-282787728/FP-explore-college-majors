5045842,5,B007005HOC,"This is a fast and handy way to all of the information that The Handybook for Genealogists book contains.  If you have ever borrowed the book from your public library you know the book is huge and heavy. It would be quite a chore taking with you anywhere because of it's size.  Also, my library is now cataloging it as a reference book so you cannot remove it from the library.

I have already found several useful research sources in no time at all. Some of the URL's are obsolete but that's expected.  You can use your research skills to come up with the updated or changed information quickly. The URL's are all hotlinks that take you directly to the source. This is a lot less time consuming than writing down the information or copying a page of the book for future use.  Just bookmark it in your genealogy favorites and go to it anytime you desire from anywhere.

I would recommend this CD to any genealogist.  The book itself is mentioned in almost every genealogy class you take or genealogy book that you read.  It's highly recommended by those genealogists ""in the know"".

The CD was delivered in record time.  Only 4 days from the day I purchased it.  What a pleasant surprise! Also, there was a very nice handwritten note from the seller.  Much appreciated.",1360195200,7,1269,4.541850220264317

I agree completely with the previous reviewer: this format is easy to use and easy to transport.
As for the content: I've taken several classes in genealogical research, and the Handybook has been on the recommended resource list every time.",1358899200,5,370,4.888888888888889
5045844,5,B007005HOC,"I was so disappointed to discover that the publishing company that printed this book had gone out of business--and the cheapest copy of the book in paper form was now over $150. That was out of by price league, so with no other option, I bought the CD copy. It turns out there are several advantages to the electronic copy. I can have a copy with me on all my computers. The text is searchable. The URLs are hotlinks. All in all, I think ebook may become my preferred library format for research handbooks.",1341100800,24,506,4.3936170212765955

8507390,5,B007005HOC,"There is another version which comes with a handbook.  Wondered if that would have been preferable.
NO WAY!  This DVD is full of locational help ssites as well as grave sites PLUS a great history of the US in many plates and maps included.  Show just how the nation grew with States added, lists of all county seats w/addresses and phone num,bers . . .
PLUS Maps show the growth of the US with shipping (canals) thru RR thru Interstate.
Great value for a relatively low price.",1408492800,,476,4.448275862068965
