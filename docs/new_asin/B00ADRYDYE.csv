5409617,1,B00ADRYDYE,"I was bored, the cover art looked interesting ,so why not with the price was under $10.00. The back artwork showed three rampaging monsters and a WW1 style tank. ( The hero ,Jack does not carry a sword, much less two at no time in the movie.) I could never determine the time this movie is supposed to occur at. Possibly the 1950's but its is England so Iam unsure.  At the start Jack is working on a Robot Combat Style Suit with the help of his girl friend. A mysterious ponytailed  ""Christopher Lee -looking "" man appears at his 18th birthday party with a wrapped present that his Mom and Stepfather do not want him to have. It turns out , small surprise that it contains Magic beans. A bean stalk grows and Jack is whisked away to a land in the clouds. There he meets a CGI Dinosaur like monster and his Dad flying around in a hovercraft style CGI  castle. Question, if Jacks father can wipe out all the Giants, how are the monsters more difficult to kill? Anyway there are no Giants around and the monsters are multipling because of that. Jack and his Father visit Serena ""The Witch""  who is lounging around in a Antique style tub when they arrive. She stands up and you get to SEE ...her legs as she puts on a robe. Serena is upset because when the Giants kidnapped her years ago no one tried to rescue her. Jacks girl friend grows a bean stalk in town and goes to find Jack.  Serena leads Four Monsters, three average size and one large  down that same bean stalk to England to have her revenge. Jack and his girl friend put fuel in the furnace while his Father flys the Castle over the edge of cloud land  and crash lands on the ground knocking out one of her Monsters. Serena, who is not very smart, listens to a ""Suit"" who talks her into taking her Monsters out of town before everyone surrenders to her. The Amulet, remember ""The Witch"" part,gets broken and now the Monsters are out of control. And Now, YES, Now, Jack gets in his Robot Combat Suit for a showdown with the Monster. Jack shuffels forward and ... gets eaten by the Monster. At this point the Movie should end and the credits roll. Nope .The Monster fall over and dies. Jack pops out of the Monster in his Robot Combat Suit. So to recap. No Giants are killed on camera in this movie and Serena is a "" Witch"" . Thats about it except Jacks girl friend pulls out from her coat pocket another Bean! Thats how it ends. I will not recomend this movie to anyone and in the future admire the Cover Art  but leave The Asylum Dvds in the store.",1365811200,10,2508,4.265263157894736
5409618,1,B00ADRYDYE,"This film from The Asylum may be the worst adaptation of a fairy tale in cinematic history.  You can't even tell when the movie's set?  The ""giants"" are actually dinosaur-like creatures.  The FX are so bad they never show the witch Serena riding one of the beasts...just head shots of her bobbing up and down.  The acting is atrocious, especially from Ben Cross whose once promising career continues to spiral downward and Jane March who is about as frightening as Mary Poppins.  I'm sure the movie hoped to gain momentum from JACK THE GIANT SLAYER but this flop doesn't stand a chance.  Avoid!",1363651200,6,594,4.718446601941747
5409619,4,B00ADRYDYE,"After climbing a giant beanstalk, young Jack discovers a land in the clouds populated by a witch & evil beasts. When they make their way down to Earth, Jack must figure out how to get back down and save everyone from the oncoming threat.

To be honest, the biggest selling point of this movie for me was Ben Cross. Some of you out there may remember him in movies(such as A Bridge Too Far, Chariots of Fire, First Knight, Exorcist: The Beginning & Star Trek) or TV(such as Dark Shadows: The Revival, William & Kate and Super Tanker).

Despite the fact that this is, supposed to be, a mockbuster of Bryan Singer's Jack the Giant Slayer; it's anything but..I assure you. I have to admit that Jack the Giant Killer was a very decent take on the fairy tales: Jack the Giant Killer and Jack and the Beanstalk. I really did enjoy the movie. With its' mostly British cast, you can tell that everyone enjoyed their part in this movie and it shows. That's why I enjoyed watching it. My only gripe, honestly, was the fact that the movie was way too short. By the time I got into it, it was over and done with.

I know I mention this in practically every review for an Asylum film but The Asylum seems to get better and better at their movies with each and every one they produce. Sure, every once in awhile- along comes one that reeks(most recently, Super Cyclone..<covers nose>). For the most part, however, they're getting better. For that, I have to give 'em their props.

5409620,2,B00ADRYDYE,"When the picture on the DVD box bears absolutely no resemblance to the movie, you know the movie is a real disaster. If I didn't know otherwise, I'd have thought this film was made in the 1950s. The monsters are Harryhausen-style (but not quality), the 'British Army' consists of one officer and half a dozen bewildered men in WW2 uniforms and the monsters drop in on England without anyone taking the slightest notice.

The plot is incomprehensible, the battle scenes are less scary than a dog in the park without a leash and to cap it all, there isn't a giant to be seen. Yet, in an odd way, it's so bad as to be not unwatchable. If anyone has a collection of really bad movies, this would be a worthy addition.",1435017600,,713,4.401515151515151

5409623,2,B00ADRYDYE,"This was a comedy, right?

Jack (Jamie Atkins) is given some beans for his 18th birthday.  He tosses them out.  They grow into a fabulous CGI beanstalk, which snags hold of him and whips him up to cloud land high in the sky.  Instead of being populated with giants, as one would hope (and expect), cloud land is one big field of nothing until a big monster comes romping towards poor Jack.  He is saved in the nick of time by a flying castle piloted by his 29 year old father (Harry Dyer as Newald Krutchens).  Apparently, there's a difference in ages due to sky years.  We soon learn that beanstalks come and go quickly.  Cloud land is ruled by a snippy queen (Jane March).  I guess I'd be perpetually pissed too if I had to clean that huge castle all by myself.  From the look of things, cloud land is vast and empty of people and giants, but for the odd monster or two.  The next time a beanstalk pops up, the queen and her monsters head for Earth.  She wants retribution for being kidnapped by giants when she was just a snip of a girl.  Ben shows up, quite cross, as Agent Hinton.  He brokers a bad deal with the queen (who proves to be stupid instead of evil).  A small army tries to defeat her and the monsters she rode down on.
My kingdom for a legume to send this movie back from whence it came.

While the floating castle is an interesting image and idea, it's not used to its best advantage here.
Jack is too insipid to be a hero.
Giants only appear in conversations.
There are far too many extreme close-ups (owing to the fact that they don't want you to see more than they have to create).

This is a bare bones streamlined piece of muck.  (I mean that in the nicest way possible.)",1425945600,,1694,4.224299065420561

5409625,4,B00ADRYDYE,"Well, this movie kept my ADHD grandson absolutely enthralled from start to finish.  Jack built this robot like tank and he just thought that was great.  Then, the giants that get killed are big dinosaurs, so he didn't mind that because he hates seeing giants get killed.  I think he also liked the actress that played the evil queen, and Jack's father was a really inventive guy also who flies around in this floating castle.  It was really pretty suspenseful.  I know it didn't have the expensive effects that movies today have, but we really liked it alot.  Movies today are so loud and noisy, and this movie wasn't like that.  I give this movie an A for effort because the people who made this were probably low budget, but they did alot with what they had.  So I would tell all you adults out there that gave this movie a really bad review that maybe you should let your kids rate it because I think that's who the target audience is.",1422489600,,938,4.412790697674419
5409626,1,B00ADRYDYE,"To be fair, I knew this was a mockbuster going into it, and most mockbusters aren't as bad as people make them out to be, because they want to hold it to the standard of the original movie... same with remakes. People expect something and then hate it when what they see isn't a carbon copy of the original. So, when I watched this, I judged it solely on its own merit and story.

With that said, let me say this... this is one of the WORST movies I have seen in recent memory... and that is saying something, because I just watched some really bad recent releases last night!

What made this movie so bad? Let me explain...

We start out with an 18 year old Jack in what looked like maybe 1940's-1950's London... could have been another part of Britain, but let's just go with London. A mysterious dude shows up on Jack's 18th birthday, stating he was a friend of Jack's long missing father, and gives Jack a package, that his parents do not want him to have. So, in typical teenager mode, he storms off with the package in a huff, hops on his moped with his girlfriend and goes out into the middle of nowhere and opens the package to find a couple of fossilized seeds in it. So naturally, Jack throws them into the big empty field, out of anger, and next scene we see Jack getting a phone call and heading out to the field where a big beanstalk has grown. The beanstalk hijacks Jack, and tosses him up into the the big sky cloud world, where Jack wanders around for a few hours...

Enter the bad guy (or in this case, girl) of the movie. A woman sits in a ridiculously ornate room looking into a big black crystal ball, and touches an amulet at her neck and says ""bring him to me""... How mysterious...

Cut back to Jack and he hears this rumbling, sees a big triceratops type of creature running toward him, and Jack starts running away in panic. He sees a flying castle and runs toward it... Jumps to catch a trapeze type of swing under the flying castle and is hauled on board by his long lost father, who hasn't aged a day... He's only been in the big sky cloud world for 19 days... which equal 19 years on Earth... Not a new concept in the Jack and the Beanstalk film literature out there... Jack's father takes him back to the beanstalk in time to see it collapse and disappear. He then takes Jack to the bad buy of the movie, the ""witch""... she was so memorable, I've already forgotten her name...

Cut back to Jack's girlfriend on Earth planting another seed and being hauled to the sky cloud world... and then cut back to the castle where you see Jack's father and Jack enter the castle and come up on the ""witch"" while she's in an antique type of bath. She gets up, and you see her from the knees down... No nudity, just Jack's father's funny face as he tries to avoid looking at the woman... The ""witch"" goes on and on about wanting retribution on the people of Earth, because she was kidnapped by Giants when she was little, and no one came to rescue her. Jack's father sees Jack's girlfriend in the big black crystal ball, and bails out of the ""witch's"" castle with Jack, and they run to the girl's side.

So, now Jack is reunited with his girlfriend just in time for the ""witch"" to come out of nowhere, riding on one of her big triceratops type of beasties, and hijack the beanstalk down to Earth. She takes with her three smaller triceratops looking creatures, and one mammoth one that looks like a triceratops on stilts... Really, the legs were so long it was a wonder the thing didn't fall over itself. Anyway, down the ""witch"" and her beasties go to Earth, while Jack, his girlfriend, and father decide to drop the flying castle over the side of the sky cloud world's cliff edge, and plummet down to stop her.

Cut to the ""witch"" arriving on Earth, and enter the dumbest and least believable military leader I have ever seen in a movie. The writing for this guy was so bad, I sat here wondering if he was supposed to be a 12 year old playing at being a military leader. His dialogue was such a joke. It was truly painful to watch. In addition, he commands a small troop of maybe 12 soldiers that are as dense and dumb as their commanding officer is. The ""witch"" makes her demands to rule Earth, and the commanding officer orders his soldiers to fire on her. They pump clip after clip of bullets at her and her beasties, but nothing penetrates the beastie's hides. Those are some tough little beasties.

A cop, I think he was supposed to be, coaxes the not too bright ""witch"" out of the city, on the premise of speaking with ""someone in authority that can give in to her demands""... So she docilely walks her beasties out of town. And we have come to the final location for the movie. In the field, the ""witch"" meets with the person she believes to be the Prime Minister, but who is in fact, the very same man that gave Jack the beans that started this whole calamity to start with. The cop guy that duped the ""witch"" out of town does most of the talking, and relays the ""witch's"" real demands to the military commander, who orders them back and fires on the ""witch"" and her beasties again, using WWII eraish cannons. And, then he stands in the middle of the field with his 12 little soldiers and fires more bullets at them, like it's going to do any good. Hey, it didn't work the first time, so why not do it again, and maybe it'll work this time, right?

Just as the biggest of the beasties is going to literally stomp on the commander, the flying castle with Jack and party fall right on its head. But, if you feel any sympathy for the death of the beastie, don't. It gets right back up as soon they are off of the castle and on solid ground. Yay! Jack is reunited with his mum and step-dad. Everyone retreats a little bit, and they come up with a plan to try and stop the big bad beasties and the ""witch"". Jack runs back home to get his Iron Man type of suit, and his dad approaches the ""witch"" to get her magical amulet that allows her to control the beasties. Jack's father smashes the amulet and the beasties go wild. Like we couldn't see that coming.

So, now the less than puffed up with herself ""witch"" wants to help kill the beasties she brought down with her. Jack's father tries to kill one of them the same way he killed the Giants. With the use of a Benjamin Franklin kite and key during a thunderstorm to electrocute it. The electrocution doesn't work, and out comes Jack in his big Iron man type of suit. Jack gets eaten by the beastie and then you see the beastie fall down dead and Jack's suit coming out of it's throat. He didn't even make it down to the stomach before he tore his way out.

Then everyone acts like the threat is over, and everything is ok. Jack's girlfriend gives him back his jacket, and he finds another bean in the pocket. Exit stage right...

Ok, so what happened to the other three smaller beasties? In case I missed it, they weren't killed. Just the big one, and yet the threat is over, and life returns to normal...? What?

This movie suffered from bad writing, to a bad director, to really really bad actors. The CGI was the cheapest they could get, and most of the movie was filmed outdoors on location in fields, because the movie clearly lacked the budget to build sets. I think there were three whole sets in the entire movie. The rest was just overgrown dead fields in the middle of nowhere. There was nothing even remotely redeeming about this movie. Save yourself the hour and a half of your life, and just watch the real Jack and the Giant Slayer movie that this was a mock up of... That was at least a good movie.

The Asylum should stick to making their bad syfy B-movies, and leave the mockbusters alone.",1422230400,2,7679,4.315533980582524

5409637,1,B00ADRYDYE,"Until I read the other reviews, I had no idea what a ""mockbuster"" was. Apparently the producers of this so-called ""movie"", The Asylum, have a business model that entails waiting until just before the release of some legitimate movie, then they release their own near-identically named version to try to leach some income from potential confusion in the marketplace. In this case, the ""victim"" movie is ""Jack the Giant SLAYER"".

Hmmmm..... On top of producing terrible movies, it sounds to me like they're ethically challenged, too.

ANYhoooo....

I watched this on DVD last night, and afterward I kept trying to think of any movie I'd ever seen that was worse. After many hours, my answer is ""none"". Bar none, this IS the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. As a matter of fact, it's so bad that even calling it a ""movie"" is an insult to all actual movies. This thing deserves a word all to itself; something new.

Nowhere is any actual ""acting"" to be seen, let alone ""directing"". This is literally the result you'd expect if you unleashed the proverbial unlimited number of monkeys among some camera equipment to see what they came up with. Actually, they'd probably do better.

Every penny of the budget is right up there on the screen, not a penny (or farthing) wasted.... all $3.87 of it.

The ""special effects"" and ""CGI"" made me wonder where they managed to dig up some old Commodore 64s that were still working.

I especially loved the scenes involving the Brit military, in which a General was commanding the responding force of, oh... about 10 guys armed with a motley mix of WW2 weapons. Really believable, that. His second-in-command was a sergeant. I knew money was tight in Old Blighty, but I never realized the depths of their budget cuts. Time to revisit that socialized medicine deal, guys.

Interestingly enough, the character of ""Jack the Giant Killer"" never actually kills any GIANTS. He does kill a big lizard; that's about it. As a matter of fact, there's not a single ""giant"" in the entire ... ""movie""? There's that word problem again. Apparently, all the ""giants"" were killed by another character before this movie even supposedly took place. Maybe having to have some actual giants would have placed a budget strain on the production somehow, running it up over the $4.00 limit. Could be...

Lizards were cheaper. No lines to learn, etc. Like that.

Well, I could go on, but I think you get the point. Avoid this mess like the plague. And judging by the previews on the disc, avoid ANYTHING by The Asylum production company.",1369526400,10,2550,4.761904761904762
5409638,1,B00ADRYDYE,"Mistakenly picked this up (which is the producer's intention with both release name and timing).

This movie takes place in a somewhat anachronistic setting, or maybe New Zealand. Jack (Jamie Atkins) plants magic beans, climbs and meets his long lost father (Harry Dyer). There is a ""queen"" (Jane March) who lives up there too, as well as creatures who look and act like Gumby had sex with a dinosaur. The production had a Jules Verne quality to it, but unfortunately they couldn't bring that home. The beginning of the feature opens by showing us a scene near the end, one where Jack, using stuff laying around the garage makes himself an Iron Man suit for no apparent reason.

Some of the language and visuals had enough camp value to it to make the film entertaining while other aspects simply fail. Modern helicopters, crank battery powered army field phones, bright yellow rotary phones, and what looked like 60's automobiles.

Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. In one scene the queen stands up and faces Newald, the father. She is apparently nude from the look on his face, but we only see her from behind from about the knees down. 3 stars for the camp value.",1365897600,6,1295,4.646288209606987

This film is not as slapstick as the ""Sharknado"" movies, but not as dull and lifeless as many other Asylum productions.  Surprisingly good cast and acting (better than the casts that Asylum can normally afford); however, the slowest points in the film are due to extended (and unnecessary) character interaction sequences, which I would blame on the screenwriters, director and post-production editors.
