8159436,3,B000KWZ1QG,I will qualify why this is merely okay. I totally loved the entire cast they were right on point particularly Steven Antin. I npersonally don't mind quirky or odd movies and in the case of this movie it is really quirky. I just thought that at times there was too much chaos and I had trouble figuring where to direct my attention. There was a very murky and convoluted story line with Martha Plimpton and Rupert Everett that to be honest was lost on me.,1406764800,,454,4.352941176470588
8159437,1,B000KWZ1QG,"I can almost imagine someone pitching this idea for a ""movie"" to a studio or producer: ""Hey, let's get some attractive young B- and C-list actors (and a couple of over-the-hill types) and they're all lovably zany, kooky and quirky oddball characters, and at the center is an intelligent but naturally underachieving slacker that's creative, and we'll throw them all together (at, say, a holiday dinner) and they'll project their oddball-quirky characterizations at each other for, say, 90 minutes. We'll FILM it and have a movie. Plot? Who needs one!  Realistic characters?  No one wants to see realistic characters, just as long as we give them 'indie movie'-type quirks! Just like in the Tarantino knockoff 'Killing Zoe,' the ruthless leader of a gang of thieves is also a jazz trombone player!  Or in 'indie crime' films where the mob boss is a handsome, erudite, well-dressed fellow that reads Kant and Kafka and talks like Gore Vidal, as most real-life mob bosses do. It'll be great!""

If your idea of WITTY DIALOGUE is a stereotypical cranky old lady saying: ""Who ever heard of a Jew celebrating Thanksgiving!"" [yuk yuk] or Martha Plimpton saying with all the earnestness of a 6th-grader: ""Well, well, well, what do we have here?"" -- well then, you're in luck - ""IMZ"" is the movie for you. I think it's garbage, the kind of crap that gives indie films a bad name.",1324944000,,1369,4.812765957446809
8159438,3,B000KWZ1QG,"Monkey Zetterland (Steve Antin) is a screenwriter with a crazy family. His mom (Katherine Helmond) is a soap star with  hemorrhoids, his sister Grace (Patricia Arquette) is a lesbian whose partner (Sofia Coppola) is pregnant, his brother Brent (Tate Donovan) is a self absorbed hair stylist, and his father (Bo Hopkins) is an absentee oddball who shows up unexpectedly sporting a pet parrot on his shoulder.  This doesn't even count the women in Monkey's life : his mean girlfriend (Debi Mazar) who dumps him, his stalker Imogene (Sandra Bernhard), and his mom's stalker (Ricki Lake) who tries to get to her through him. Finally there is the terrorist couple (Rupert Everett and Martha Plimpton) that just moved into Monkey's building. Obviously there's far too much going on in this movie. It isn't good by any means but it's occasionally fun to watch thanks to the cast. The plot, about Monkey trying to sell a screenplay about the L.A. boxcar system of the 30's, makes no sense. The humor, like the acting, is a little over the top. With that being said, the actors do wonders with their limited screen time. Coppola was the lure for me and I am pleased to say she looks beautiful and her acting has improved since 'Godfather 3'. She's kinda touching as the conflicted, pregnant lesbian. Antin was good in eighties movies, but here he is dreadful, like his script. Plimpton and Everett are the wild cards of the movie as married terrorists who hate each other. Donovan has a lot of fun as the vain hair stylist and we never get to know Lake's character enough to care about her. I could have done without Helmond, Hopkins, and especially Bernhard. The sound on the DVD is horrible and most of the dialogue is unintelligible (this might be a good thing). Make no mistake, this is not a good movie to recommend, but the awesome cast is  a lot of fun.",1231718400,3,1851,4.671779141104294
8159439,5,B000KWZ1QG,"Thrilled that this is finally on DVD.  An adorable, funny, absurd, self conscious mish mash with an amazing cast.  Sandra Bernhard is divine as Imogene.  For gay men who have been immersed and insulated by their  friends and family's lives, this movie is a wonderful gift.  I've worn out my VHS, and can't wait to own it in widescreen.",1170374400,4,335,4.610169491525424
