8011015,5,B0001DYVIS,"I also bought the DVD with this title and was so disappointed to find it was not the same workout. And I had given my VHS copy away to a friend before I realized the mistake! The DVD doesn't use the weights and the ""music"" is so irritating.  I'm glad to be able to order another video because this is my favorite short work out. Also the VHS doesn't seem to be offered on her website store. I'm just beginning to walk, I have a couple of other Leslie Sansone DVD's and I just love how easy it is to follow her.",1188000000,,510,4.0
8011016,5,B0001DYVIS,"If you've read the reviews for the DVD version you'll note that there seems to have been a production error -- an incorrect DVD was put into the Muscle Mile One cases.  Because of this error, I purchased the VHS version of Muscle Mile One, and it, at least, is correct.  On this tape, Leslie walks with two of her instructors, Sandy and Mary Kaye, in a studio decorated in the background like a courtyard.  The two-pound weighted balls are used for arm work. This is a nice walk that feels a lot like the one-mile Power Walk, though for some reason the pace doesn't seem quite as brisk.  It only takes about 20 minutes to do, including the warm-up, cool-down and stretches, and is suitable for beginners or for days when you're pressed for time.  As with the one-mile Power Walk, I especially appreciate this one because Leslie keeps the giggling and banter to a minimum, though she's as encouraging as ever (she's the only one of the three who talks).  I'm glad I invested in the VHS tape, because the walk is very worthwile.",1172188800,4,1026,4.489247311827957
