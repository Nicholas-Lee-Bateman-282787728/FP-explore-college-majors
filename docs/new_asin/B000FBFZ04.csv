2559732,4,B000FBFZ04,"insightful,realistic view of the insane world of the correctional system.the author seems to have lived the experience themselves. Great learning tool for teachers and social service people.",1318723200,3,190,6.074074074074074
2559733,5,B000FBFZ04,"I have used this movie for many years in my criminal justice class at high school.  I recently purchased the DVD to replace my worn VHS.  Very interesting to watch how a prisoner is booked into Lewisburg, and how they live.  Its scary to listen to a couple of the prisoners who murdered family members or the wrong person.  Definitely an eye opener for young people.",1311033600,2,366,4.5
2559734,3,B000FBFZ04,"Good interaction with subjects and great access to a high security prison.... since there is no story you just kind of hop from one cell to the next, to the patios, to the kitchen, etc. The building is beautiful for a prison, designed in a renaissance style it has a high tower similar to those cute European villages, but, not much story for that. Most of the content are small conversations with high freaky minded assassins that make you wonder what kind of species is the human being.",1260835200,2,488,4.556818181818182
2559735,5,B000FBFZ04,"Alan Rudolph (& wife) have crafted a film of unusual intensity. They were given permission to film inside Lewisberg, the maximum security prison that seems to be the end of the line for serious criminals. These are men who seem to have no hope of rehabilitation, and the interviews are riveting, whether from inmates or guards. Indeed, the warden seems to have a definite idea of what works. Much has been said about abuse in the prisons, and this film somewhat dispels that myth. To appreciate the power of this film is to know the power of evil; I won't blab away a lot, but I was totally absorbed in the material at hand. The Raymonds are to be commended for this Oscar-nominated effort. Extras on the DVD are fine and insightful.",1197417600,19,733,4.5606060606060606

8120333,5,B000FBFZ04,"Purchased this DVD to replace the VHS version which was inadvertently thrown out. I worked at USP Lewisburg when this documentary was made and know more than a few of these inmates. The documentary is good for the fact that it gives the general public insight into a world that most don't know about. The Raymond's had unlimited access when making this video and I wish they would have broaden their scope to include more of the staff, institution, and other inmates.",1461542400,,467,4.7073170731707314
8120334,5,B000FBFZ04,GREAT PRODUCT.,1451433600,,14,6.5
8120335,5,B000FBFZ04,"Used it in my Sociology and Government classes to underscore life inside ""the  Big House"" - Lewisburg Federal Prison.  It leaves nothing to the imagination stripping away the human soul and how rehabilitation has never been a goal of Federal incarceration.  Gripping, scary and honest in its depiction of prison life and do not forget it also highlights our dual justice system (one for the rich, one for the poor) and its consequences.",1436313600,,436,4.945205479452055
8120336,4,B000FBFZ04,"I purchased this as a gift for somebody who has wanted this for the longest time. I searched the entire internet and Amazon was the only place that had a copy for sale, and at a great price. Compeling documentary, very gritty & real.",1382227200,,233,4.318181818181818
8120337,5,B000FBFZ04,This video exceeded expectations and was an excellent resource for the courses in criminal justice that I teach at Rust College.,1372636800,,128,5.142857142857143
8120338,2,B000FBFZ04,I'm sure when this documentary was made in the 90s the information was up-to-date and the depiction of prison life revelatory and shocking. But in a day when we are inundated with reality prison shows on television the information presented here seemed quite obsolete. As an encapsulation of the prison experience in 1990s America it has merit. But for those seeking current information you need look no farther than your own TV.,1362614400,,429,4.972222222222222
8120339,2,B000FBFZ04,Not a really enlightening documentary.  One can see better documentation on Nat Geo or A&E.  By no means a shocking expose.,1357344000,,123,4.809523809523809
8120340,5,B000FBFZ04,this movie provides great insights into the corrections system and gives a basis for preparing lessons and explanations to students,1356480000,,131,5.6
8120341,5,B000FBFZ04,"Although it is a few years old, this documentary gives a real life view of life ""on the inside"".  The inmate interviews are candid and unrehearsed.  You also have an opportunity to meet staff and hear their views.  The interactions with the warden give you insight into the immense responsibility he has and shows him to be a man of integrity - unlike TV and movie characterizations of wardens.  As someone who spent 35 years in corrections, this documentary is as close to authentic as anything I've ever seen attempted.  This is a must see for criminal justice students or anyone contemplating a career in corrections.",1327881600,4,620,4.811320754716981
