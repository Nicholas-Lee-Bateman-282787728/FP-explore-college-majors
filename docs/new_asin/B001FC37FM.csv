3584880,4,B001FC37FM,"Maya Fiennes provides an excellent Kundalini Yoga experience that is both a workout and a spiritual experience. She incorporates mudras, mantras, and meditations and offers good explanations for each step. The exercises are good for all levels (I'm a beginner and out of shape) and the music is also very good. I do wish there was an option to just have the music and no instruction except to switch poses, as Kundalini Yoga is often done with the eyes closed and I find that I now know the moves, so I desire just the music during the exercises. My other disappointment is that this set only includes the three lower chakras and I cannot yet find a place in the U.S. to get the remaining two sets for the upper four chakras. I do recommend this DVD, especially if you enjoy Kundalini Yoga.",1276560000,14,790,4.531468531468532
3584881,5,B001FC37FM,"This DVD is simple and allows me to be consistent with exercise because its around 40 minutes, effective in terms of stretching, and toning, also it seems to subtly do something to my nervous system for sure; because after doing the root chakra work on Courage, I found myself waking up the next day on the opposite side of the bed, another observation is that I also felt pretty light hearted. These are just observations that I am linking with the DVD work I have done, even though I am yogi and have been for a decade, this DVD is still pleasant and effective, and doesn't bore me at all. I am giving it 5 stars.",1273363200,17,615,4.310344827586207
3584882,5,B001FC37FM,"If you liked the previous Maya's Kundalini Yoga DVD, you'll like these as well.  Maya's DVDs tend to be a little bit easier than Ravi and Ana's, and provide a nice change of pace.
Really like her music background!",1272153600,27,213,4.461538461538462
3584883,5,B001FC37FM,"I love this set of 3 DVDs with one for each of the first 3 chakras (she has DVDs for each of the 7 chakras). Each DVD lasts for a about 40 minutes. There is a warm up section, set (kriya)for each chakra and a meditative section with exercise/s with mantra in each DVD. The warm up for the 3rd chakra was sun salutations and the warm up for the 2nd chakra was the 5 Tibetans.

The music is beautiful and I love the pieces with violin music.

The sets include some slightly different exercises to the ones in the Ravi ana series and of course some of the same.

There is little extra talking besides giving instrutions at the start of each exercise. I like this since it allows me to concentrate inwards/ focus on my body.

Valuable addition to a kundalini yoga DVD collection.

I also enjoyed her DVDs for the 5, 6 and 7 chakras",1268438400,48,827,4.208860759493671

3584896,5,B001FC37FM,"I have never found a Maya Fiennes yoga tape I dislike. For me, her yoga tapes present a perfect harmony between practicing yoga and meditation, and I start my day (as often as I can) with 20 minutes of one of her tapes. Usually the tapes are about 50 minutes long (this one has three dvds in it so that's why the price is higher, but it is so worth it each one presents different exercises and I often see myself being better in the specific chakra area I practiced earlier that day). Within each 50 minute tape, it is often broken into 3 segments of stretching and moving and then quiet meditation, so doing 20 minute intervals within each tape has me working on a particular tape for a few days and then I can begin a new one. Would highly recommend!",1377129600,7,752,4.265734265734266
3584897,5,B001FC37FM,"This video met all my expectations for purchasing it. I'd been recording snipits of it on Magrack tv. Which piqued my interest but I could only keep for 4 weeks. In the past four years; I have experienced so many life changes it became overwhelming. Through this, I discovered the healing benefits of kundalini yoga which gave me the mental and physical strength .
I recommend Maya's dvd to everyone seeking clarity of the mind, courage to attain optimal health and understanding the power of will.
Maya is not only a great teacher but has composed and performed the musical score to video.",1376956800,3,590,4.737864077669903
3584898,5,B001FC37FM,"My only concern with this set is that the main kriya used in the first DVD is  *not* for beginners. It takes at least a moderate degree of flexibility. That being said, it is WONDERFUL and I would suggest it for anyone who has the maturity to make good judgments about the need for modifications with some movements or numbers of repetitions.

I have been using it daily for a little under a month now and I continue to progress and improve and to derive deeper and deeper benefits from it.

The way it is presented is very calming and supportive and, I would say, reverent, no matter what your belief system. It is wonderful for your body (and mind!), no matter your motivation for using it, and I would just suggest that whatever your age, take it slowly if you are new to kundalini yoga.

Bottom line, I couldn't be more pleased with this DVD set and will shortly be ordering the ones for Chakras 4-5 and 6-7.",1375488000,3,912,4.378698224852071

It 7 hours or so long (an hour for each chakra) and you are supposed to do 1 chakra a day (i think). It is cool because you get daily variation like a yoga class but you don't have to pay a lot of money a month.

3584908,2,B001FC37FM,"This video was well put together (edited well, good music, nice visuals).  I do like that the atmosphere is so meditative (as opposed to yogercise types).  But I feel like I didn't learn anything from this video.  I am a beginning yogi, and I just wanted more.  The workouts were moderately taxing...and if you are not in good physical shape, they will really do the trick.  But I would finish and feel unfinished and a little let down.  Also, I understand the benefit of repeating poses over and over to reach a maximum workout.  However, I think a video would be best to teach you how to do it yourself.  Instead of watching her do (essentially) toe touches, I would rather her do it a few times and suggest that the viewer pause the tape and do 25 reps....or suggest that when you try the routine again alone do 25 reps.  You know?  It just would feel like I am learning more for my money that way.  I come from a small town where there is no yoga instruction.  I am also a single mother.  I would like a video that mimics the quality of a real yoga session.  I have yet to really find that in a video.  Can anyone make any suggestions?",1349568000,3,1139,4.257009345794392

3584914,4,B001FC37FM,"I love the one-DVD-per-chakra concept and the excellent organization and flow of the workouts, which other reviewers have described.  I would have rated this a 5-star series except for a few detractions.

(1) The whited-out background, which actually hurt my eyes (when they weren't shut) and reminded me of the old adage about a polar bear eating marshmallows in a snowstorm. So wearying on a day-to-day basis!

(2) The music.  Too much, too loud, too foreground, too distracting from my yoga experience.  Also,I kept wishing Maya had used different music for each chakra.  The repetition of certain music (usually the song I liked the least) was irritating.

(3) It would have been helpful for Kundalini Yoga beginners if Maya, like Raviana, had suggested modifications for some of the more advanced poses.  I am not a beginner, but certain poses (such as the accelerated plough pose on the first disc) just didn't feel safe.  (I modified that one by doing spinal rolls, Happy Baby pose, and finally a full Plough.)

I'm not at all sorry I purchased this series, but whereas I had originally planned to use it exclusively for several months, because of the detractions I'll probably use it only for one 6-week rotation per year.

NEW THOUGHTS--MAYA MODIFIED (15 March 2013):

Having hit a plateau with kundalini yoga workouts, I decided to try something heretical:  creative modification, using light hand weights, bands, a stability ball, variant positions.  My new approach has worked like a charm, particularly with Maya's ""Detox and Destress"" and ""Journey Through the Chakras"".  Although each of her workouts is well designed, my ""heretical"" modified versions energize me much more than the originals ever did. I especially recommend the bone-loading benefits of adding light hand weights to the arm movements, when safe to do so.  Mudras (symbolic hand configurations) are all well and good, but as a 66-year-old woman, ""why waste an opportunity for bone-loading"" has become my new motto!",1307404800,13,1995,5.130030959752322
3584915,4,B001FC37FM,"Like myself, dedicated Christians are going to find elements of Kundalini Yoga uncomfortable with its sanskrit mantras and invocations of deceased gurus. This DVD is no exception.

This set is really not for the complete beginner either. After 4 months of almost daily yoga, I find exercises in this set to be very taxing and difficult to maintain. For example, in one DVD, we are asked to lie down on our backs and continuously throw our legs up and over our heads touching the floor. I had neck and and back pain for a day after this one. Even exercises which at first appear laughable, such as revolving one fists around one another while chanting ""harrr"" are in reality very difficult if maintained for 2 1/2 minutes nonstop. In all, you are going to have to be disciplined and in good shape to get through an entire DVD in one session. You will need the kind of discipline that Maya Fiennes, no doubt had to develop to become a professional musician as well as a yoga expert.

If you are just starting out, I think her DVD entitled, Kundalini Yoga to detox and destress, will be more accessible.

The DVDs have an elegant look and fine original music by Maya. But I think that the Kundalini Yoga DVDs by Ana Brett and Ravi Singh are more fun and upbeat, while incorporating some of the same exercises. As pointed out by one reviewer, Maya's DVDs are very similar to attending a real yoga class. As such, be prepared to work and feel muscular pain afterwards, rather than complete relaxation.",1305763200,11,1496,4.574626865671642
3584916,5,B001FC37FM,"Maya Feinnes is a gifted healer and teacher. Through regular practice with Maya's Journey Through the Chakras, along with the next two sets which round out the series, I have found a calm within. My body, mind and spirit feel great! The DVDs are soothing, fun and challenging all at the same time.  Maya is a concert pianist and amazing musician and singer.  Her music and mantras, along with the simple elegance of the production, make these DVD's a great ""time out"" from a busy and stressful life.  I highly recommend all of Maya's DVD's to anyone seeking a strong, soothing presence to guide them through home yoga practice. Alternating these with a few Ravi/Anas and Gurmukh makes a complete home practice with loads of variety and inspiration to keep at it every day. Oh, and did I mention that she will whip you into shape too?!  That, I feel, is simply icing on this big beautiful cake!

Yes, you have to buy three at once here - but you will want to buy them all anyways! This way you don't pay the extra shipping - so go for it - get the whole series now and enjoy!",1304208000,6,1074,4.404040404040404
3584917,5,B001FC37FM,"Are you like me, highly sensitive? If so, then this may just be the perfect workout for you. Yes, it is a workout. Make no mistake about that. I've been using these dvds 5-7 days a week for almost five months. There are still kriyas (or exercise sequences) that are extremely challenging to me. I've become far stronger and more flexible, both in mind and body. My posture is better than it's ever been, and the back pain that has always plagued me, as a scoliosis sufferer, is far more manageable. I used to see a chiropractor once a month for that reason. I haven't felt a need to do that since beginning this yoga. No other sort of yoga I've tried has worked with the spine in such a direct and gentle way. So, the DVDs have already paid for themselves.

I've tried many varieties of yoga throughout the years. There is no one style that will resonate with everyone. In Kundalini Yoga, however, I have found my personal home. I am a highly feeling and sensitive person, and Kundalini Yoga is unique in the way that it addresses the safe and positive release of emotions often deemed ""negative,"" like fear, worry, and anger. This yoga series addresses the whole person, mind, body, heart, and spirit, in such a gentle way -- it shows how to transform those feelings or passions into acceptance and bliss. My highly skeptical husband and my nephew, who are both complete neophytes to yoga, do the yoga with me regularly, and they are coming to love it as I do. There may be people who, like my husband, find talk of chakras woo-woo. That's okay. You can understand the chakras however you want. This DVD series does an excellent job, though, of explaining the emotions and processes governed by each chakra in the chakra-specific narrative portion of each dvd.

This first dvd set in the series is easily the most physically challenging one.

Just a note, when I say that the yoga is gentle, I mean it, but Kundalini yoga is *extremely good* at getting to those emotions. You may find yourself almost yelling the mantras sometimes, or tears may come to your eyes. Embrace that release -- it means that the yoga is doing its job. Honestly, this is nothing to be feared or ashamed about -- even in public classes I've attended, this sort of emotional release is extremely common. The yoga is designed to get those feelings out, so don't hold them back. Maya urges her students to TRUST THE PROCESS. You will be challenged, there may be times you feel like giving up, but take a breath and rejoin the kriyas when you can and more likely than not, you'll find yourself relaxed, energized, and blissful at the end. The wonderful music, which she writes, sings, and performs herself, is very supportive of the process. Play it a little more loudly, especially during the mantra sections, and you may find that music encourages you to keep up.

There are a few minor quibbles that I have. I think that the meditation sections are far too short. In my household, we've solved this by having a mantra queued up and ready to go on the stereo. You can pause the dvd in between the exercise and mantra section for a deeper meditative experience. There is also a spot in the 1st chakra exercises (""Courage"") where she does an exercise for one leg and not the other. Overall, though, this series is the BEST.",1299196800,76,3295,4.5608108108108105

Most all exercies hurt or makes the pain worse.  I don't know why, but after a session with Maya my back feels great and rejuvenated!  It just works.

Kundalini Yoga with Maya!

The DVD's in this box set are among my favourite Kundalini Yoga classes! I am comfortable with Maya's teaching and I take inspiration from her. I began with Maya's detox and destress and was so impressed that I went on to get her first two box sets of the journey through the chakra's. I also have some Ana and Ravi Dvd's and Gurmukh's DVD as I have connected with Kundalini Yoga and have a regular practice.

There are three classes on separate DVD's and these work with the first 3 chakra's. As other reviewers have described already I found the Sets to be quite difficult initially and then slowly but surely, as I worked within my own limits, I have found that I can achieve more and more and the benefits are amazing! I feel energised, yet blissful...wonderful! I like how the classes are structured and the warm up section prepares my body and mind for the forthcoming sets. Maya's music is lovely. I like the fact that my eyes are closed throughout, unless I need to check a pose.

Mistakes happen but it would be nice to have recourse when things don't go right.",1447718400,,559,4.480392156862745
8301888,2,B001FC37FM,"Very ""new agey.""  Very commercial slick looking production.  Was that Clair de Lune during one section of the practice??  Ok if you like that kind of thing.  I do not.  Having  practiced yoga for over 20 years with a number of different instructors, I was disappointed in these DVDs.  Would not recommend.",1435449600,,305,4.75
