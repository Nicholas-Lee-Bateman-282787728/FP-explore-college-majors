Dunn comes out the winner in the end with delightful escapades in the meantime.

The supporting cast are equal to the task of being opposite the fine actor Dunn and provide many great moments of comedy that are absolutely perfect in their execution.

If you like fast moving comedy this isn't the series for you but, if you prefer the classics of British Comedy such as Are You Being Served, Time goes By, and Dad's Army this is one that you will not want to miss.",1392076800,,674,4.419354838709677
