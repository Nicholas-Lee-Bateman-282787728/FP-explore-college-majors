8758962,5,B01EK3NQH6,"The DVD has a 30 day workout plan and contains 7 different ab routines. I would say they range from beginner to intermediate intensity, so a good DVD to grow with. The workouts area combo of pilates, yoga, and core work. The DVD contains a nice variety of difference exercises that work your core in different ways. This DVD has a lot of footage and a TON of variety! Great fusion style workouts and Caroline is a great instructor. This DVD will get a lot of use .",1489536000,3,464,4.284090909090909
8758963,5,B01EK3NQH6,"Tired of disliking my midsection, I ordered this DVD. I've REALLY enjoyed it. I've noticed a difference in my midsection and feel much stronger. The added core strength has helped me in ballet class and I'm finally feeling on the right track to tackle this problem area. The workouts are relaxing yet effective. I've just finished the 30 day plan but will definitely keep this dvd as my go-to abs workout.

One thing I must note that I thought was especially nice in the set-up of the DVD is the 30 day workouts are organized by day - so if the plan says to do 2 or 3 sections, they are already cued up - you just pick the day you're on and the corresponding workouts play, one right after another. That was different than other DVDs I got where you had to go in and out of the menu to do the prescribed sections. However, once you've done the 30 day plan, you can still access all the individual sections separately. Something simple but so convenient.

Highly recommend!",1488153600,4,972,4.424581005586592

She demo's well and the sets are not distracting, the music is calming and the workouts do what's promised. They build daily with progressively more challenge added as your muscles respond.",1485216000,3,300,5.02
8758965,5,B01EK3NQH6,"This is a perfect routine to get your core primed for other Pilates routines or other exercises. There is nothing that is too complicated, or for that matter, super hard to do--Sandry has you doing perfectly challenging routines with none more than ten minutes. The warm up is super relaxing and gets you ready for any of the seven routines, all of which complement each other. Sandry is super clear with her instructions and is a charming personality. I was never confused, and when not looking at the screen, I knew what to do. Her 30 day schedule is easy to follow, and all you have to do it click on the appropriate day and it is premixed for you. I actually liked the music a lot, and the setting is the same space that Nicky McGinty uses in her DVDs. I did Sandry's 30 days schedule, and yes, my abs pulled in and my core is stronger. I moved on to Barre3, and I have the strength, thanks to Sandry, to hold the planks required for those routines. I will pull this did out again as a way to refresh my core periodically. I am super happy with this purchase.",1474761600,8,1063,4.293532338308458
