2699326,5,B0007UTVB2,"Watching this movie with my grandfather, I was struck by how much better and more wholesome comedies used to be. Did you know that it's possible to make a very, very funny movie without any references to sex or bodily functions? I wish more movies today had this kid of attitude. I can't remember the last mondern comedie that I would feel comfortable watching with older members of my family. The plot involves a body that keeps poppping up all over the place - sort of like during a Scooby Doo episode. It was fun.",1148428800,,516,4.442105263157894

2699344,4,B0007UTVB2,"Slightly dizzy mystery of a  missing corpse placed in our mild mannered  main characters car trunk to implicate him in a murder he did not commit.  Either he or his butler keep switching places for it, trying to keep it out of the way of a nosy cop and his dizzy wife and children. I enjoyed this movie, probably made in the 40s, especially like the actor who played the one who found the corpse. Cute movie.",1401235200,,408,4.2727272727272725

2699348,2,B0007UTVB2,"It's worth a few chuckles, nothing more. It's an inexpensively made film with mostly routine material. It's a typical ""B"" movie for the time.",1385251200,,141,4.916666666666667
2699349,4,B0007UTVB2,"I enjoyed it. I especially enjoyed the main character played an actor I'm unfamiliar with. I'm interested enough to look him up now and see what else he's done.  :)

2699352,5,B0007UTVB2,"The Missing Corpse is a fun movie to watch. It is only about an hour long. The plot is a typical slapstick, corny, whodunnit for the time period within which it was made - 1945. Two newspaper company owners, Kruger and Hogan, are at odds. One is shot and the other is framed by the body of his rival ending up in his automobile's trunk. The storyline moves quickly as the body continues to move from one place to another to keep the police from finding it the remaining newspaper man's possession. I definitely recommend it for anyone looking for something fun and easy to watch.",1365897600,,579,4.471698113207547
2699353,3,B0007UTVB2,"This is an Alpha Home Entertainment DVD. I look worse than a VHS copy with that Blair Witch steady hand. Everything is really scratchy. You will recognize most of the actors such as J. Edward Bromberg from ""Charlie Chan on Broadway"" (1937). The story at least the presentation had those holes that you can drive a truck through. It gets slapstick at all the weirdest times.

A newspaper owner, Henry Kruger, threatens to dispatch a rival newspaper owner over an article. The one mistake is making this threat was right in front of his chauffer/friend, Andy McDonald and, the other newspaper owner's assistant/patsy 'Slippery Joe' Clary  .

And you guessed it a corps is turns up in Henry's car trunk. Then it is not there. Then it is here and there and not hear and there. Now each person sees it and is kind enough not to tell everyone.  We know h did it but no on listens to us.

Mack Hogan (Frank Jenks) as the cabin caretaker is the comic relief as if we needed relief.
The story sorts of works around Egbert (Charles Coleman) a snickering butler that seems to know something but never tells.

Any way the film is worth a quick look. I you miss this one you won't be missing much.

If you love bodies being moved then two better movies are:
Arsenic and Old lace (1944)
And
The Trouble with Harry (1955)",1342656000,2,1306,4.46218487394958
2699354,4,B0007UTVB2,"Interesting movie not to intense in fact more silly then intense.  Did enjoy it though.
Movie is only one hour long, the last 19 minutes are a black screen.",1328918400,4,156,4.379310344827586
2699355,3,B0007UTVB2,"One night Danny MacDonald found himself dead - of course, he didn't know it.  At first, everyone thought he was just missing - it was in all the newspapers.

In this movie, there are three news sources: The Argus, The Tribune, and The Gossip.

Argus: an alert or watchful person.  Danny MacDonald, the shady, double-dealing publisher of The Argus, was a watchful  person, but unfortunately, he should have known better than to trust a murderer.  Danny would never have guessed that he was about to be an unwanted guest of Mr. Kruger.

Tribune: a protector of or champion of the people.  Henry Kruger, publisher of The Tribune, thought of himself as the champion of the people, but his family thought of him as a meal ticket.  Henry, feeling unappreciated, takes the advice of his chauffeur and confidant, and decides to get-away-from-it-all, without telling anyone where they were going.  The three of them head off for the hunting lodge: Henry, the chauffeur, and their hidden, unbidden guest.

Gossip: a person who habitually spreads gossip  The lady, who ran the general store, was one.  Henry wasted five bucks paying her to keep quiet about his staying at the lodge.

(Definitions are from The American Heritage College Dictionary, Third Edition.)

Overall this is a good, well-made comedy; enjoyable enough to watch more than once.

Picture quality: Fair; the film used as the source for this DvD was degraded.  Significant cropping, most obvious in the title, credits, and a newspaper headline which should read: ""PHYLIS KRUGER IN CAFE BRAWL,"" but what you see is ""LIS KRUGER IN CAFE BRAW.""  The Alpha Home logo is displayed during the title and credits.  Sound quality: Fair, somewhat muffled.

2699356,5,B0007UTVB2,"I like how this otherwise traditional screwball comedie includes just enough scarier moments to keep the momentum going. Of coruse, like most films of this genre and era, the jokes are somewhat dated, but if you can get  your mind into the rihgt place, it can be very, very funny. The special effects are pretty good by 1940s standards and the picture is well edited and paced. A classic treat.",1160611200,,394,4.628571428571429

8159689,4,B0007UTVB2,"Good plotline and the typical cast of characters from the time period, The Missing Corpse is a fun was to spend an hour or so.  The title sounds too ominous for this light hearted mystery, no gore or bloodshed to be seen just a peek of an arm or leg in the most unexpected places and a touch of a life lesson mixed in as was also popular in the time period.",1489190400,,357,3.9583333333333335
