8562599,1,B00B54CY4A,"I got a PIRATED DVD! Written a complaint ti Amazon and promptly got a replacement... ANOTHER PIRATED DVD.
1. Both DVDs have a different cover from the one in the picture on Amazon;
2. The covers are printed on an ink-jet printer
3. The DVDs are burnt recordable media
4. The DVDs top faces are ink-jet printed
5. The DVD player does recognize the DVDs as data DVDs
6. The DVDs have two folders: AUDIO_TS and VIDEO_TS.
It appears Amazon doesn't care if it gets involved in piracy as long as it is profitable.",1506556800,,507,4.404255319148936

8562604,5,B00B54CY4A,"Somewhere I came across this movie, it wasn't rated very highly. and there are so many horribly bad kungfu movies out, I almost didn't watch it.
The first 5-10 minutes are slow, and almost pointless, and I almost stopped watching. If you get turned off by the little girl flirting at the beginning, stay with it, the payoff later is beyond incredible.
I don't like martial arts movies with a lot of wire-work, and all kinds of fake stuff, but sometimes it works (for me, the first IronMonkey).
The Kungfu is good, minimal wirework, but there is a story here that is extremely charming, witty, and eventually very emotional.
This girl Jing Bai is amazing, she is an incredible actress, and was a student of the real Ip Man's eldest son Ip Chun.
True facts:She was born in 83', which makes her age 27 at the time this film was made, and I swear she doesn't look that old. She died when she was 28, in 2012 after being stabbed by her husband, after which he killed himself. According to Wiki: ""she had been cheating on her husband with another man who had conned her husband out of 9.6 million rmb and an Audi A8",1457827200,4,1109,4.414634146341464

8562607,5,B00B54CY4A,"I thought it was great! It seems to be a TV movie along the lines of Tai Chi, the one with Jackie Wu. It has a lot of action, a decent plot and a sideline love story. It goes back and forth with the laughs , the action and some blood. It's standard Asia cinema.....little bit of everything! The main female lead is awesome! her big, dammit I've had enough fight with the main bad guy is great! If you like Kung Fu flicks as a rule, you will dig Kung Fu Wing Chun!!!!!",1443398400,5,467,3.978723404255319
