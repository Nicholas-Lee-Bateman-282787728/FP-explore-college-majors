2240838,5,B0007TKHW0,"I've been looking for this movie and ""Mas Negro Que La Noche"" and I haven't been able to find them with subtitles. It's a shame, my parter doesn't speak Spanish, that's why I'm looking for these movies with subtitles.  I don't think I'm going to find them, I guess I'm going to have to wait until someone decides to add the English subtitles to it.",1146787200,2,348,4.3538461538461535
2240839,1,B0007TKHW0,"The real name of the movie on the cover of this DVD is 'Los Murcilagos' ('The Bats') from 1964... Alma Delia Fuentes and Joaqun Cordero did not make 'Hasta el Viento tiene Miedo' (1968)... I'm not going to buy this DVD just because that simple reason... I am still waiting for 'Ms negro que la noche' and the real 'Hasta el viento tiene miedo' DVDs; Carlos Enrique Taboada made both, not Juan Jos Ortega... a quick visit to the IMDB can erase any doubt about it... The only thing to trust in this page is the Description of the movie...",1124928000,3,536,4.37
2240840,1,B0007TKHW0,"Yet again a great film gets a substandard ""PD"" style release from a company who obviously have nothing but contempt for their audience. VHS quality picture, no subtitles, no extras AT ALL (not even a text page) and a horrible cover.

A film this good deserves far better. Sadly the fact that this dreadful release is already out there and widely available will presumably deter any other company from bothering to do a better one. A real missed opportunity.",1123718400,4,457,4.784810126582278
2240841,5,B0007TKHW0,"This one of the most scariest movies of all time. It doesn't relly on gore scenes for the effect of scare you out, but on the windy black nights and our fears of see a ghost. There are two mayor scenes on the movie, one is when students Kitty and Marina see for the first time the presence of Andrea on the top window of three store cellar after chasing her friend Claudia, and the other  is when teacher Lucia (Maricruz Olivier) talks with gardener Diego about her students visions of Andrea. The dialog is supreme:

-Do not seem you very surprised.

-No...How could be the poor little one a ghost? So pretty and with those sad eyes...(seeing to the floor)

-Have you ever seen her? (With a very surprised and scared face)

-Yes...(wait a second and then) you don't?

Lucia walks to the door very surprised and confused...

-How could I see her! She's death!

You must see it!!! Five stars!!!

One note...the poster of the movie is wrong the original poster is at: [...]",1120435200,2,971,4.471590909090909

2240854,5,B0007TKHW0,"It arrived before the expected date, the movie is so interesting that the fact it is an old movie does not change the suspense and good actors that make you stay connected and interested trough the whole movie, the seller was very kind to send us a thank you note, we are very pleased with it.",1408924800,,293,4.25

2240856,4,B0007TKHW0,"Serious collectors often put up with bad prints of great movies. This is such a case. I'm guessing that the source tape for this edition came from an old TV print: it's a terrible pan and scan that stretches images and occasionally mars sound quality. We have to consider this artistic vandalism, since we're looking at a serious piece of artwork. Hasta el Viento Tiene Miedo was obviously crafted with care, features fine, sometimes Bava-like atmosphere with touces of Vadim's Blood and Roses. Serious collectors of the genre need this film, regardless of the poor format. Good soundtrack, too.",1393286400,2,595,5.02020202020202

2240858,3,B0007TKHW0,"Not bad Mexican ghost story.  Takes place in a girls' boarding school run by a martinet headmistress.  Her hardass, unfair rules lead, years back, to a student's suicide.  Now her spirit is haunting the school and taking over a new student, in search of justice.  At times truly spooky.",1369699200,,286,4.775510204081633
2240859,5,B0007TKHW0,I remember watching this as a child with my grandmother and being so scared.  I was so happy to be able to own it and have a piece of my childhood. It brought back many memories.  Fast shipping and good quality!,1356825600,,211,4.121951219512195
2240860,5,B0007TKHW0,"Hasta El Viento Tiene Miedo(1968, Even The Wind is Frightened) is a superb Mexican horror film from writer-director Carlos Enrique Taboada. Several girls are stuck at a school during Christmas break and the ghost of a dead girl is scaring them! They're also picked on by Ms. Bernarda(Marga Lopez), a straight-faced, no nonsense woman who runs the school. Maricruz Olivier plays a faculty member who is kind and patient with the girls. Alicia Bonet plays a student who sympathizes with the ghost. Norma Lazareno plays Kitty, a saucy, femme fatale who doesn't get along with Ms. Bernarda. The lovely Elizabeth Dupeyron plays Josefina, a square, unpopular girl that most of the girls don't like. I like Dupeyron's dark hair, flying saucer eyes, cute looks and golden brown skin. Dupeyron was in The Wild Bunch(1969) showing Warren Oates and Ben Johnson a ""toy"". It's fun watching Josefina and Kitty dance to Armando Manzanero's catchy 'Blues Jazz'. The film has a fair amount of humor and never slips into campy farce. Most Mexican horror films are very, very cheesy and they try to emulate Hammer Horror or something. Hasta El Viento Tiene Miedo has some class. The film has creepiness and atmosphere. The music score by Raul Lavista is quite good. The theme music for the ghost is quite moving. This film was remade in 2007. Hasta El Viento Tiene Miedo is a classic of Mexican cinema.",1323820800,4,1383,4.889361702127659
2240861,1,B0007TKHW0,"Just a warning to those looking at the product specs: the Amazon description says this film is subtitled, but it is not. There are no subtitles (English, or any other language) available on this DVD. It is in Spanish (the original language), and I don't speak Spanish, so I guess I'm out of luck. Wish the product description had been more accurate.",1313280000,10,349,4.645161290322581
2240862,4,B0007TKHW0,"I remember seeing this for the first time when I was around 11 or 12 and it scared the beejesus out of me. My cousins and I threw blankets on the floor and had a sleepover watching it. Needless to say we didn't get much sleep. Now it's 20+ years later and it still scares me a bit :) A bit cheesy, of course, but the cheesiness  makes it all the more fun to watch. When the dead girl's ""shadow"" is seen in the music room, I get chills every time! I love this movie.",1312675200,4,465,3.8947368421052633
2240873,5,B0007TKHW0,"What I love the most in this movie are the performances by Maricruz Olivier and Marga Lopez who were two of the best actresses ever in all of Latin America, is a very scary tale where there are not fancy special effects or lots of fake blood, is all about the quality of the performance of the actresses ( the cast is 90% female) is a  great film for any age, may look like a remake, however that is not so unusual in the movie making business, one example is Mulan Rouge, the original was with Marlene Dietrich, but the copy with Nicole Kidman was a huge success,",1268524800,,564,4.222222222222222
2240874,5,B0007TKHW0,"This a classic suspense Mexican film from the 70s. The performance made by all the actresses is remarkable and unforgetable. The quality of image is excellent.

2240876,5,B0007TKHW0,"This classic horror story is cleverly written and directed my one of Mexico's greatest film directors Carlos Enrique Taboada. It is one of Taboada's masterpieces.

This is one of those films that does not use gore or blood effects to get its horror effective. The recognizable music score comes from Raul Lavista. The film was also produced by Churubusco Studios (Mexico's Hollywood).

I strongly recommend this film to anybody interested in a great classical Mexican horror film.",1213920000,2,480,5.220779220779221

2240880,5,B0007TKHW0,Esta tradicional pelicula es de las que nunca deben faltar en la coleccion de un buen aficionado al cine mexicano. Sin grandes efectos especiales es capaz de mantener al espectador al filo de la butaca. Sin duda una joya del cine mexicano,1171929600,,238,4.690476190476191
2240881,5,B0007TKHW0,"This is an old good movie. This is a scary movie, a private all girls school, where one student killed herself one summer and she haunts the school for revenge.  Good one",1167782400,,170,4.3125
2240882,5,B0007TKHW0,"Hasta el viento tiene miedo stands out from other Mexican horror films because the fear is due to supernatural and psychological reasons, as opposed to the campy monsters, demented doctors, vampire women and masked wrestlers that have characterized Mexican horror.  However, the film also suffers from cheap production values, and has a decidedly late 60s look, so I'm afraid the film will still seem very campy, especially for Anglo viewers used to a more sophisticated look.  As the other reviewers pointed out, the DVD release (like the film) is cheap, and has no subtitles.  It looks pretty good, though, and the lack of subtitles is because these cheap Spanish DVDs are being marketed to Latino viewers who, presumably, speak the language.  I don't think there's enough market out there to justify a remastered DVD edition with subtitles.  Also check out ""El libro de piedra"", the follow-up film, which is also available without subtitles, and ""Venenos para las hadas"", which does have them.",1161302400,10,996,5.1234567901234565

8051326,4,B0007TKHW0,"This film is a classic of the horror genre, neglected (probably) because it's in Spanish and is nearly 50 years old.  I wish someone would restore it and give it the presentation it deserves, with subtitles, the proper screen-size aspect, and interviews with people who were involved in the production.  It's hard to believe the film was only 13 years old when I first saw it, at college in the ""international"" theater.  A friend of mine who spoke no Spanish went along, and just the creepy music and visuals scared ~him~.  The shower scene and the gratuitous striptease scene give some idea of the intended audience, but it all works.",1482710400,,635,4.745454545454545
