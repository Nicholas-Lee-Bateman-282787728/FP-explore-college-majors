2344680,2,B000A0GP1S,"This DVD just has 9 episodes that are on other DVDs. it's just recycled ones so Nick can try and make a couple bucks. No need to buy this, just stick with the seasons if you're into them.",1356566400,,187,3.9473684210526314
2344681,4,B000A0GP1S,Our other disc was scratched so it's nice to have a new one. the kids love it.very happy with the purchase.,1279929600,,107,4.142857142857143
2344682,5,B000A0GP1S,"The other reviewers are diappointed because these episodes have all been released in other collections.  Personally, I'm not a SpongeBob completist, and I don't need rare unreleased episodes or limited-edition collector's figurines, I just want a few of the funniest shows.

If you only want one DVD of this silly show, Absorbing Favorites is probably the one to get.

This disc has all of my favorite episodes, including the emotional ""Ripped Pants"" (plus Ripped Pants karaoke!), the spectacular ""Fry Cook Games,"" the poignant ""Jellyfish Hunter,"" and the awesome ""Karate Choppers,"" plus a few more good ones.  I don't know if the ""lost"" episode, ""The Sponge Who Could Fly,"" is really lost, but it is pretty funny.  And the special features are all excellent.

This might be all the SpongeBob a normal person needs.

By the way, my kids (ages 7 and 4) love it too.",1187136000,6,864,4.917241379310345
2344683,2,B000A0GP1S,"Don't get me wrong, we LOVE SPongebob at our house but as the other reviewers have also stated the episodes on here have already been released on previous Spongebob DVD's.  So why do they think we would buy something that we already have?",1127433600,12,238,4.534883720930233
2344684,1,B000A0GP1S,"There is no reason to purchase this dvd . . . none.  don't get me wrong, I'm a huge fan of the series, but this dvd is a waste of your time and money.

When the series was first released, they were bundling a smattering of episodes on each one.  Those episodes were taken from all the seasons.  Quite a few had been released, when they started releasing complete seasons on dvd packages.

So . . . if you are someone who started collecting early, then you already have every single one of these episodes.

And if you are someone who started collecting later (after the full season bundles were available), then you already have all of these episodes.

Sadly, this one is pointless.  If they had placed the three shows from season 1 that have yet to be offered, and the one show from season 3 still unreleased, along with duplicates, at LEAST there would have been something new on the dvd.  It would have been disappointing to get so many dups, but at least there would have been a reason to buy.  As it stands, there is not.",1126310400,26,1025,4.347368421052631
2344685,5,B000A0GP1S,"Don't buy this if you have the whole Spongebob DVD collection because it would just be a waste of money because you already have all these episodes. However, you should buy this if you don't own any of the Spongebob DVD's because it would make a great DVD. Here are all of the episodes: Ripped Pants, Mermaidman and Barnacleboy, Karate Choppers, Gary Takes A Bath, Jellyfish Hunter, Frycook Games, Club SpongeBob, Plankton's Army, The Sponge Who Could Fly.",1120089600,39,456,4.858974358974359
