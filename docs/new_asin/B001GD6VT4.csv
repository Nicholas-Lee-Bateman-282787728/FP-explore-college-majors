3607510,5,B001GD6VT4,"This movie has so many great twists in a very powerful, important story that needs to be told. The film is almost brutal at times in it's honesty - some scenes were actually intense enough that I almost had to look away. I was impressed with the way the film went out of its way to illustrate how the mistreatment and terrorization of people in those times was not necessarily just racially-motivated, but also by class distinction; whites bullied other whites based on socio-economic standing, or in Reese Paxton's case, for their allegiances, and blacks in a higher class, or in a position of power, looked down on the black field hands just as the whites did. The movie has an excellent sharp pace, it never dragged, and it very accurately depicted, not only the corruption of the times, but the frustration, outrage, and helplessness of those victimized - the viewer actually feels these things - almost felt what Reese was feeling at times - which really helps the viewer connect with him when he 'came back'.",1229731200,3,1014,4.734463276836158
3607511,1,B001GD6VT4,"This movie is just an excuse for a lot of quite predictable bloodshed, masquerading as some kind of historical comment, and for some nasty misogyny. The movie strives for political correctness, at least racially, but misses the boat completely where the female characters are concerned. They simply get raped and brutalized. It's unrealistic, too; everyone, including field hands, is far too clean, and there's no feeling of authenticity. The direction's adequate at best; there are far too many lingering shots of the star's face (he's too old for the role anyway).

As for being based on the Thibodeaux Massacre of 1887, as the final comments indicate, it bears little resemblance to that event - but then, it's not actually about injustice to black field hands, it's about the white guys, as usual. The black characters are just there to die on the ""hero""'s behalf, as the women are there to be raped. As long as he can stagger to the final showdown, they've played their part in this miserable vehicle for an aging soap opera heartthrob.

Forget it. It might please fans of the soap in question, or kids who've never seen any decent westerns, but that's all it's good for.",1229212800,6,1176,4.845771144278607
3607512,1,B001GD6VT4,"Epitome of low budget ""B"" movie.  Horrible camera work that is often out of focus - Looks like it was shot with a home video camera.  Sound is bad, like their budget only allowed for one microphone to record with.  As for the set, it looked like someone's yard.  Plot was standard -- wrongly convicted good man escapes from prison and gets revenge - entertaining.  Plot had some interesting moments - as in a concurrent murder, copulation scene.  And the undertaker had a great one liner.  Most of the acting is amateurish. However George Kennedy and James Patrick Stuart as the evil father and son rich landowners are good in their roles and entertaining as is Billy Zane.",1228953600,6,673,4.6525423728813555
3607513,5,B001GD6VT4,"I watched this movie basically because I've watched Eric many years now on the Young and the Restless.  Though I'm fond of his Victor Newman character, it was good to see him in this different role.  Carol Alt is beautiful as his wife.  I loved Billy Zane in Titanic and it was great to see him here too.  George Kennedy did fantastic.  Overall, an entertaining impressive movie.  I really hope Braeden makes more films in the future.  He's adorable!!!",1228780800,4,452,4.6455696202531644

One man, the one that came back played by soap star Eric Braeden, fought back.  George Kennedy is the Judge that was responsible for all the trouble in the first place and Armand Assante plays the corrupt local sheriff.

3607909,1,B001GD6VT4,"Where do I begin? ""The Man Who Came Back"" is amateur slop right from the get go. The script is not only boring but entirely unrealistic, and it is noticeable within the first ten minutes of the movie. Idioms of the present day are inserted carelessly among other phrases that sound somewhat more appropriate for the post-Reconstruction era; the intermingling of the two makes for choppy, disjointed dialogue. To exacerbate this problem, certain actors pull off a southern drawl well while others sound entirely contrived. Add in sets that look like suburban backyards, economy-props everywhere, and a collection of hokey costumes and you, as a viewer, end up feeling more like you're on the set of a low-budget film (!) than in the deep south in the 1870's.

The camera-work only makes all of this worse. Few interesting angles are chosen, there are far too many close-ups of faces, and sometimes the camera is not even focused properly. On top of that, many of the fight scenes are poorly edited, the hand-to-hand combat is done at a snail's pace, and the limited gore is downright cheesy (I cannot figure for the life of me why other reviewers consider ""The Man Who Came Back"" to be ultra-violent- there's barely any gore. While there is some violence towards women and children, most of it is suggested, not overt).

Worse still is the acting. Billy Zane is humorous as the bumbling attorney if for no other reason than he does not appear to take the film too seriously; Eric Braeden tries far too hard to pull off the stoic ""tough guy"" character and instead makes the film seem more like bad, daytime television. Wonder how that happened... Braeden annoyingly grunts, moans, and whines throughout the movie instead of attempting to express actual emotions. Tears would have been appropriate more than once, but I suspect such basic acting is beyond his ability. I only single him out because he is the lead, though- rest assured, he's among friends.

Beyond these peripheral complaints, I have two big ones. First, the plot has been done before hundreds of times in various genres; there's no riveting story to make up for the poor acting and awful production. Second, this film's purpose is confusing- is it a (failed) social commentary? If so, why are the black characters affirmed while the women are repeatedly objectified and abused? If ""The Man Who Came Back"" is only intended to be frivolous entertainment, then why include the cloudy social commentary at all? It only makes the film that much more disjointed and awkward to watch.

""The Man Who Came Back"" is one of the more pathetic films I have had the displeasure of viewing, and I have seen a lot of clunkers. I urge potential viewers to look elsewhere for a good Western. The acting alone is enough to sink this film, and it is plagued by a swarm of other problems too.",1363824000,3,2836,4.7698574338085535

3607973,4,B001GD6VT4,"Eric Braeden's the star of this film.  Eric Braeden, for crying out loud!!  You don't see him in many films.  I don't watch the Young and the Restless, but if I did, it'd be for him and him alone.  I don't know what it is about the guy, but he's just got something about him.  I loved him as the villain in Escape from the Planet of the Apes, but other than that I don't see much of him.  After seeing his performance in this film I wonder why he doesn't do more.
In The Man Who Came Back he's the only white man in town standing up for the black plantation workers.  When he tries to bring justice to one worker who was lynched, he finds himself framed for the murder by the evil plantation landowner and his son.  If this weren't enough, his wife and son are killed by the landowner's son and his evil henchmen.  After rotting in prison for a year, Braeden manages to escape and he comes back into town in full on Charles Bronson mode, kicking butt and taking names.
Not the most original of plots to be sure, but it works.  Braeden does a great job.  He's definitely suited for this kind of film.  He has minimal dialogue, but manages to speak volumes through his facial expressions and his eyes.  Plus, Braeden just looks like he's from this time period.  Some reviewers are saying he's too old for the part.  This is a really stupid thing to say.  When does a man get too old to be wronged and want vengeance?  If still in good health and with a strong will, when is a man too old to be a badass?  It's a moronic thing to say, period.
The supporting cast is also good.  George Kennedy is in a rare villain role as the plantation owner.  James Patrick Stuart makes a rather loathsome villain, as does the always reliable Armand Assante.  Hell, as does Peter Jason.  This film is full of good villains!  Even Sean Young!
Billy Zane is on board for a bit of comic relief as the only guy in the circle of villains who appears to have a conscience.
This film doesn't have a huge budget and it looks a bit cheap because of the slightly home movie-ish look, but it's rather easy to forget once you get into it.
Would I recommend?  Hell, yeah I would.  Lets hope we see some more of Eric in the near future(outside the Young and the Restless that is).",1236384000,15,2248,4.220657276995305

3608009,5,B001GD6VT4,"Canyon News Editor in Chief, Tommy Garrett loved this film.

One of the most popular actors on the planet was kind enough to make time out of his busy schedule in order to talk exclusively with Canyon News about his latest film, ""The Man Who Came Back."" A film that I have called the best film of 2008. That's right, films like ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" and ""Slumdog Millionaire"" may be garnering Oscar nominations, but these films lack the depth and value that ""The Man Who Came Back"" has going for it. Actor Eric Braeden, best known for his role as Victor Newman on CBS's mega hit and daytime Television's number one series for over 19 years and counting sat comfortably in his CBS TV City dressing room and took over an hour to engage in one of the most stimulating and thought provoking conversations I've ever been privileged to be a part of.

The film that has renewed Braeden's faith in his profession as an actor was one where he was also executive producer. ""We worked very hard to bring up to speed the crew in Texas, where we filmed our movie. They were the most accommodating and considerate people I've ever met. But being outside of Hollywood they didn't realize certain things that actors are not only used to but expect. One of the first things I did when I arrived was [to] get better dressing rooms for our cast."" Braeden who takes charge of things by nature made him a perfect Executive Producer. He knew just what to do to get the film in the can, under budget, within the allotted amount of time for shooting and also to smooth things over with cast and crew to keep things moving very efficiently.

The film's subject is taken right out of American history. The post civil war period during reconstruction was a time of great turmoil in this nation. Braeden laments further, ""It was very tough on freed slaves during the time period. Slavery as it was known may have simply evolved. Slaves were freed then became indentured servants. They would have to work very hard and pay for their own room and board and food right there on the plantation. The company store would allow them some line of credit, while keeping them enslaved by the very fact that they were never paid real money. So they could never get out of debt. It was an atrocious way to treat human beings, and when this script came across my desk, I thought about it for a while, I mulled it over, then I sent the script writer a copy of a wonderful book that explains this era better than anything I've ever read before. The book is called `Without Sanctuary.' It's a photography filled book that features the real images of what was going on in our nation at the time, lynching, murder and other horrific things that we must be aware of if we are to go further in our nation's evolution. I came to America just before 1960. I have often said, if the Black White experiment fails in America, it can't work any place else. Despite the horrors of American history, our Constitution is a document that offers such strength to our nation and to our people. I think after the past eight years, we now realize that we had such chipping away at our civil liberties and this has caused such damage to our nation. But we're on the rise again. We are going to the way we were meant to be.""

Braeden, a student of history, knows very well the dangers of giving away liberties in order to have security. German born Braeden has a real background in what happens when a nation goes too far to one side and the American patriot has great faith in America's recuperative abilities."" Braeden adds, ""The nation spoke loudly during this election. It was past time for a change. I have great faith in Obama. He's very smart, he's very pragmatic and you know what else? He's very strong. That's what we need in a president. I'm so sick of ideologues running the country. Bush made a terrible decision to not fight the real war on Terror in Afghanistan and invaded Iraq with ulterior motives. His father, a great man, was a veteran of WW II, so he understood the importance of allies and the help that other nations, especially Russia made to help win WW II. Hollywood for the past half century has perpetuated a myth about WW II and how we, Americans did it all alone. Hollywood has a responsibility to teach proper history and to not make propaganda that makes idiots of our youth and lies about our history.""

Braeden with ""The Man Who Came Back"" doesn't do that at all. He plays one of the most incredible heroes on the big screen ever. Reese Paxton is as strong a figure as any we've seen on the screen since the 1940s when men were real men and heroes. Braeden plays a no-nonsense Confederate Army veteran whose defense of black workers in the post-Civil War south has deadly consequences. Glen Pitre (""Belizaire the Cajun"") directs from a script he co-wrote with Chuck Walker (""Rings"") who produces with Stephen Bowen (""Mexican Gold""), Sam Cable (""Mexican Gold"") and John Castellanos (""The Attendant""). Though the film's crew and production staff did not consist of seasoned professionals, they were extremely professional and with Braeden's almost 50-year history in the entertainment industry behind them and his guidance as executive producer, the film turned out to be an incredible saga that has no single second or frame of film that lacks pulse pounding drama.

Braeden spoke warmly of many of his costars. The sometimes considered difficult Sean Young gave Braeden not a moment of worry. ""Sean was amazing and she was wonderful to work with. I loved also working with the great George Kennedy, he's a legend. He and I have worked together on `Y&R,' and I remain in awe of his presence on the screen. James Patrick Stuart may have played a bad guy in the film, but he is an amazing performer and he gave an outstanding performance. I also had been an admirer of actor Aramand Assante. Billy Zane was great, we'd worked together in `Titanic' in 1997 and Peter Jason was an asset to the cast as well. I was really lucky to have such a strong cast on this project. I really enjoyed the process, and being an executive producer makes me want to never just go on a film set and just perform in front of the camera again.""

Critics, costars and even the production team behind this film all agree with Braeden. He was known for being very fair on the set, but did not forget that as Executive Producer he had responsibilities and it didn't include allowing the project to go over budget or be held up for production because of someone's unprofessional behavior. Braeden tolerates none of it. But he also lives by his own words and is known in the entertainment industry as a powerful actor, the best prepared and a man who respects the ethic of hard work.

A storyline that leaves tears to anyone's eyes is played out in an almost operatic and extremely flawless manner; this was mainly because of his hands-on approach as executive producer--building not only a consensus but also a team of producers, writers and directors who were learning from the best in the business.

The modest actor never mentioned during our interview that he'd received his Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2007. Then Mayor Johnny Grant told me, ""I admire the hell out of this guy. I haven't been so excited to see so many people here to honor this great American and I'm so excited to see his peers as well as fans from all over the world who have come to this event."" Also in 2007, Braeden received the Ellis Island Federal Medal Of Honor Award. In 2004, he received The Humanitarian Award from the government of Israel and has visited with Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and Former Prime Minister Shimon Peres in Israel. Braeden also is the recipient of seven Emmy Award nominations  in the Best Actor category and in 1998 received the coveted award for ""Outstanding Lead Actor In A Daytime Drama Series.""

Braeden's life and career are distinguished beyond which anyone can describe. He has the highest TV Q rating of any daytime star ever, but he's much more than that. Now he's a film maker. ""The Man Who Came Back"" is the best film released in 2008. Braeden, however, only showed us that he can do it all. To those of us who know him, this comes as no surprise.

""The Man Who Came Back"" is brought to you on DVD by Lionsgate and is currently one of the highest rated rentals.",1233792000,3,8346,4.552964690206529
3608010,5,B001GD6VT4,We loved this movie!  Eric Braden is fantastic in this movie.  Very realistic and beliveable. George Kennedy and Armand Assante are equally as well liked in this.  We would highly recommend this to those who like history and westerns.,1233360000,3,234,4.948717948717949
3608011,5,B001GD6VT4,"I thought the story line was very good, in that the man who came back was trying to right the wrongs that had been done to the slaves. It was a very grafic film and had maybe a bit too much sexual content in it. Most likely that is the way it was back in those days of the wild west.
All in all, it was a Great film.",1232928000,,316,3.5942028985507246
3608012,1,B001GD6VT4,"I can't understand how anyone can watch this and actually think it was a good movie.  All the reviewers who rated this movie negatively are spot on with their criticisms.  Perhaps Young and the Restless fans just can't get enough of ""Victor"".  At any rate, don't waste your time.

Shot with a video camera.
Southern not a Western.
Two dimensional characters.
He is too old for the role.

Most of all a predictable story and as for the scene where his family is killed, it just made me uncomfortable to watch.  The acting lacks any real emotion, i.e. contrived.",1232496000,6,560,4.606060606060606

3608014,5,B001GD6VT4,"First, let me say I'm shocked to see people giving this film one star.

The Man Who Came Back deserves far better. This movie will stick with you for days after. It isn't a high-budget film, but the storytelling is so GOOD that you don't notice it. You will notice the former slaves have clothes that look a little too nice, and the southern accents are absent at times. However, you get so wrapped up in the story, you don't pay attention to these things.

Eric Braeden plays a battle-scarred Confederate sniper who sticks up for black rights in the deep South. He is falsely imprisoned for murder and his wife and son are murdered right before his eyes. He manages to escape and gets revenge as only he can.

Braeden is NOT too old for this role, as listed in one review. In fact, he's perfect. They make note in the script that he has a much younger wife and that he is supposed to be older. It is so obvious, anyone watching this film should catch it.

The movie is very intense, and a little sad, as most western/revenge films are. The scene where his family is murdered just gripped me. You could feel the emotions running high in that scene. It was incredibly intense.

If you like westerns, revenge movies, or films about the Old South, I think you should give this film a shot.

I did not once get up to do anything while watching it. I was in the chair all 112 minutes. That says something. I NEVER do that.",1231027200,3,1417,4.3283018867924525

8305036,5,B001GD6VT4,"Great Film. The actor that steals the film is not even listed in the credits. He is the fantastic mult-Talanted Patrick James Stuart, Who I loved as Perry on the tv sitcom Still Standing. I hate him and you will too. He is pure evil and dispecable in this movie. He along with Eric Braden make this film marvelous with their acting. Eric was on the tv show the Rat Patrol as a German officer and on the soap- The Young and The Restless. James is the newest addition to General Hospital as the Feared, Evil, most evil Cassadine of all. The fans hate him since he made his apperance as Valintine Cassadine. He first posed as a stranded fisherman named Theo with a European accent who was gentle and likable before revealing himself as Valintine. He is fabuolous in the man who came back, as is every actor in this movie. Buy this movie and feel every emotion that you will have.",1469232000,,876,4.380368098159509
