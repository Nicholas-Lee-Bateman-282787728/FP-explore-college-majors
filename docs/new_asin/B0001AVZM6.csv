1984672,4,B0001AVZM6,"Well, FINALLY the studio released this title on DVD. Thankfully they released it as the original TV version rather than rehashing the old (and disappointing) Key Video version. But WHY couldn't it be released in its original, full, uncut format for the DVD? Even the longer TV version is still edited somewhat. And there are no special features at all. Surely there could have at least been some kind of documentary, interviews with old cast members, follow-up on who and where the remaining Family members are even still today, etc.
WB had the opportunity to launch a great DVD here and they dropped the ball.
Not to glorify the Hinman/Tate/LaBianca murders, but scores of us from the 70s still remember the impact of this movie in a time when we weren't so desensitized to violence and in strict terms of a film it's an enthralling time capsule.
On the film's own merits and the fact that it's the original TV version, I give the DVD 4 stars. I give the studio a thumbs down for not going the extra step with it. Still recommended for purchase.",1082592000,8,1046,4.629032258064516
1984673,5,B0001AVZM6,"""Helter-Skelter"", the excellent TV mini-series based on the Tate-LoBianco murders in 1969, has finally been released in its entirety on DVD and the result is worth waiting for.  Technically, it's one of the better DVD's this reviewer has seen in quite a while.  The format reproduces the 1.33:1 video aspect of the original TV film and the colors are true to life.  The audio quality is clear and sharp.  This DVD is a treat to watch and listen to.
The film relates the horrendous events of the nights of August 8-9, 1969, when seven people turned up murdered for seemingly no reason: five people (six, if you count Sharon Tate's expected child, two months away from being born) at 10050 Cielo Drive, the home Tate shared with her husband, the movie director Roman Polanski, and Rosemary and Leno LoBianco the next night in the Los Feliz section of Los Angeles.  The victims were shot and slashed to death, and political slogans were written on the walls and fridigaire in their own blood.  There are no initial clues and no suspects, until the connection is made to a prisoner named Bobby Beausoleil who committed a similar homicide.  Gradually, the trail leads back to a group of demented hippies living on a dilapidated ranch under the leadership of a charismatic drifter named Charles Manson.  As the evidence builds and three young women are arrested, there is a lot of talk about ""love"" and ""surrender"" and ""Charlie is Jesus Christ"" to emphasize how completely these young people have fallen under Manson's domination, but the film pulls no punches and makes no excuses; this is a wolf pack of cold-blooded killers.  This isn't some group of free-love hippies; these people can -- and do -- murder anyone who crosses them, including one of Manson's own defense attorneys, with about as much compunction as a killing machine.
George DiCenzo ably plays the dual roles of narrator and lead prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi, who comes across in the film as more likeable and less full of himself than he does in his book from which this film was adapted.  The actresses playing Susan Atkins, Leslie Van Houten and Patricia Krenwinkel are all excellent; we look into their eyes and see hell.  But whoever cast Steve Railsback in the role of Charles Manson deserves a special award for the casting coup of the decade.  Railsback is unbelievable as Manson, with whom he shares an almost frightening resemblance, staring at the viewer with those insane eyes.  Railsback actually has little to say in the film, compared to some of the other characters, but those mesmerizing snake-eyes say everything.
The film's coda is scary in itself; DiCenzo as the narrator, informing the viewer that California outlawed the death penalty that Manson and his crew so richly deserved and got, and that their automatic sentences of life imprisonment were up for parole review in 1978, or only two years from the date the film was shown on TV.  Watching this movie again, and recalling the ghastly events of those two nights in August of 1969, we breathe a sigh of relief that almost 35 years later, the Tate-LoBianco killers are still behind bars.",1082592000,9,3125,4.849624060150376
1984674,5,B0001AVZM6,"1976's ""Helter Skelter"" is an intense and quite suspenseful TV movie, starring Steve Railsback, who is so good as Charles Manson, it's rather eerie.  The film also stars George DiCenzo, as Los Angeles prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi.  The tele-film is based on Mr. Bugliosi's best-selling true-crime novel of the same title.

The film is told in semi-documentary style (with DiCenzo doubling as narrator throughout the movie).  It begins with a very spine-chilling scene in the early-morning hours of August 9, 1969, in Los Angeles, California.  We hear multiple gunshots from a distance.  Gunshots which emanated from nearby 10050 Cielo Drive, the home of movie director Roman Polanski and his pregnant wife, 26-year-old actress Sharon Tate.

The gunshots were fired by a member of Charles Manson's so-called ""Family"".  And so began one of the most bizarre chapters in the history of crime -- a senseless massacre, claiming the lives of seven innocent people, that became commonly known as the ""Tate/LaBianca Murders"".

Manson's ""zombie"" killers racked up five murders at the Tate residence, and the next night went out and killed two more people they had never met, Mr. and Mrs. LaBianca, at 3301 Waverly Drive, in another part of Los Angeles (Los Feliz).

(In my own view, Manson and his team of brainwashed murderers should *really* have been charged with EIGHT killings in August 1969. Number eight being the unborn child of Sharon Tate.)

The film recreates the discovery of the two grisly murder scenes with nerve-wracking effectiveness, but without showing too much gore, which is all the better (as well as tasteful).  But the fact that this was a 1976 made-for-TV feature no doubt limited the filmmakers with regard to showing material of an overly-graphic nature.

The story of the brutal killings and the lengthy court trial that followed is detailed very well in this rarely-seen, full-length (184-minute) DVD version of ""Helter Skelter"".  The previous video (VHS) release of the film only ran a paltry 119 minutes, with (obviously) many scenes cut from the original print.

The movie was originally shown as a ""2-Parter"" on network television, with a total running time of 194 minutes (10 minutes longer than what we get on this DVD).  But, despite missing ten minutes, we're not really losing any relative scenes or information.  Because the ten minutes that are missing are simply ""recap"" scenes that were used for the network telecast in order to re-acquaint viewers with the storyline and previous ""Part 1"" scenes. Plus, also trimmed from the DVD version is a needless ""end credits from Part 1"" sequence.  Therefore, this 184-minute version of the film *is*, in effect, the ""complete"" film (when taken in the context of a ""one-part"" motion picture, rather than a two-parter).

The icing on this movie's cake is the brilliant and highly-effective music score by Billy Goldenberg.  Goldenberg's unsettling score evokes a feeling of uneasiness and is downright scary in many instances during the film.

Mr. Goldenberg was one busy music composer in the 1970s.  He wrote musical themes to many TV shows during that era -- including: ""Rhoda"", ""Night Gallery"", ""Banacek"", ""Kojak"", ""Harry O"", and lots of others.

The DVD's aspect ratio is Full-Frame (1.33:1), as originally shown on TV.  Video quality on this disc looks very sharp and clear. I am extremely pleased with the picture quality. There's an occasional blemish, artifact, or dust speckle, but not very many. Certainly not enough to create a distraction.  In fact, even the nighttime images in the film (which can often look ""grainy"" on an older movie) exhibit excellent clarity here, with very little grain visible.

I've found that another good ""test"" of a DVD's picture quality (that's worked well for me) is the ""Freeze Frame Test"".  Try ""freezing"" any image on the DVD.  Does the stilled picture become blurry, distorted-looking, and fuzzy?  If it can't be ""frozen"" without blurring (or minimal blurring), then I'd give that DVD video transfer a lower mark on the old ""PQ Scorecard"" than a more solid transfer where the picture can be paused and frozen in near-perfect clarity.  ""Helter Skelter"", in my view, passes the ""Freeze Test"" very nicely.  Non-moving images on screen can be paused with little or no blurriness resulting.

In short, this DVD offers up a very good Digital transfer for a TV-Movie made in 1976.

This snazzy-looking DVD version of ""Helter Skelter"" makes my ultra-poor, third-generation VHS copy of the film look mighty crummy indeed!  Needless to say, that VHS video is now destined for the scrap pile.

The soundtrack offered up here is a 1.0 Dolby Digital Mono track; and it's quite adequate (although a small amount of ""ghosting"" is evident during some parts of the film).  Mr. Goldenberg's shiver-inducing musical score comes through just fine via this mono presentation.  And all dialogue sounds distinct, clear, and is easily understood.

Extra Features .... There are none (unless you want to count subtitles, which are included -- in English, French, and Spanish).  But this lack of extras doesn't disappoint me greatly.  Just getting this excellent TV film in top-quality Digital form on DVD is enough for me.  (Although I would have *loved* a commentary by the real-life Manson prosecutor, Vince Bugliosi.  But I figured that was too much to hope for. And it was.)

Menus .... The menus for ""Helter Skelter"" are ""static"" (non-animated) ones, with the Main Menu being accompanied by a variation of the eerie music score.  Unfortunately, this is one of those discs where the movie begins playing all by itself after the Main Menu has been on screen for 30 seconds (which is common, it seems, with a lot of Warner Bros. DVDs).

If you're a fan of ""true crime"" tales, then this DVD should definitely find its way into your Digital Library.  Part documentary, part thriller, part drama, part horror film, and ALL true -- ""Helter Skelter"" (1976) is a true nail-biter.",1082505600,98,5967,5.061412487205732
1984675,3,B0001AVZM6,"I'll never forget the evening I was browsing the local video store. On the shelf I ran across a copy of the 1976 made-for-TV miniseries ""Helter Skelter."" Since I had never seen the film and had read the Vincent Bugliosi book on which it was based, I decided to rent it. Knowing full well the original series was around 200-plus minutes long, I picked up both copies of the tape assuming they were parts 1 and 2. With a line waiting behind me on that busy evening, the clerk looked at both tapes and screamed across the store, ""Is 'Helter Skelter' two tapes or just one!""
Every customer in the store stared at me, and I blushed as if I had just rented ""Showgirls."" To this day, there's this ghastly boogeyman aura that surrounds Charles Manson and his puppet clique of attractive, promiscuous, murderous teenagers. This video version was only 98 minutes long, and for some strange reason, the store had two identical copies. Stupid me. Oh well, the original version of ""Helter Skelter"" has now been released on DVD. So friends, family and dogs can now wallow in the full 200-minute criminal epic.
After viewing the full-length version, I was surprised how closely it remained true to the known facts. The trial itself, which takes up the second half, is based entirely on court transcripts. And it gives us the best scene when Manson abruptly decides to make a statement to the courtroom. The jury was appropriately led out of court, though this was irrelevant to Mr. Charlie Boy. His speech was intended for reporters and audience members. The rambling proclamation, in which he discussed his skewed philosophy, is authentic (though I doubt he delivered it with unblinking eyes a la actor Steve Railsback). For the one and only moment of this stagy 1970s production (I was expecting Jack Webb to make an appearance any second) we see inside the demented philosophy of this horrible cult. It's probably as good a clue as any as to why these kids began committing random murders around Los Angeles during the summer of Woodstock, 1969.
Fascination with the Charles Manson cult is nothing new. The book ""Helter Skelter"" has remained in print for years, making Bugliosi millions. A new made-for-TV movie is to be broadcast, including additional facts unknown in 1976. Fresh converts can now revel in a new-millennium retelling of the Manson mythos. Believe it or not, one can find as many books related to Manson as to the JFK assassination. It's a damn cottage industry. I have read several, the best of the lot being ""The Family,"" first published in 1971.
The book, unlike this film, details the constant use of psychedelic drugs combined with the isolation of Spahn Ranch. Manson and family enter an alternative zone having little to do with President Johnson's Great Society. It became the Cult of White Trash Group Think, formed by the hangover of one endless lost summer weekend. Very little of this is seen in the 1976 film version. Manson is portrayed as some kind of Devil who can stop watches by smiling. The cops, adorned in the best polyester money can buy, eventually take down these very creepy kids - and thankfully so.
There are no truths to be found in ""Helter Skelter,"" just as there are no truths whenever someone tries to understand evil. It's fascinating, no doubt. Why else would we watch Bela Lugosi stand on a cobwebbed staircase uttering ""Children of the night. What music they make!"" I suppose Charles Manson is the vampire of our generation. He could even be Dracula, if Dracula were a hillbilly redneck who could barely read and write.",1082419200,,3559,4.788617886178862
1984676,5,B0001AVZM6,"I saw this film many years ago on television and was enthralled by the horror of it. The film moves at a very quick pace and is true to the characters it portrays. The guy playing Manson is freaky and his eyes are frightening in a ""get under your skin"" type of way. The film does have some light moments (and dare I say unintentionally funny), such as the cleaning lady running out of the Tate home screaming & the prison scene where Atkins confesses, ""Charlie's Jesus Christ."" That poor inmate must have been terrified! In all, this is one of the better TV movies and still holds well nearly 30 years later. I am hopeful now that we'll soon get a release for the Jonestown film with Powers Boothe.",1082332800,,698,4.376923076923077
1984677,5,B0001AVZM6,"About time for this one to hit DVD (wonder when they will release James Michener's Space!!!!). Steve Railsback's portrayal of Manson was right on the money as was George Dicenzo's portrayal of the prosecutorial genius, Vincent Bugliosi.

1984678,5,B0001AVZM6,"Yes, this is the complete version of ""Helter Skelter"" at close to 200 minutes and not the heavily cut video release that most of us have. I, for one, can't wait to see this film again as it scared the Hell out of me in 1976. In my opinion, this is still Steve Railsback's best performance on screen.

1984679,5,B0001AVZM6,"A few years ago, when a terrible DVD called ""Helter Skelter Murders"" was released many people purchased it thinking it was this version.  This was made for T.V. as a mini-series in 1976 and while tame it managed to be explosive with right on portrayals of the imfamous Manson Family.  I was so scarred of the actor playing Manson and his freakish eyes that I was literally traumatized (like some kids get when they watch their 1st horror movies).  The sad AND Unbelievable part was, of course, that this all really happened.  The funny thing is the timing for this DVD release, considering that Helter Skelter is being remade as a T.V. movie.  Hopefully any review will remember it for the tragedy that it was and that to this day the victim's families have not forgotten that this crazy man was able to destroy their lives.  Note: to any Manson ""fans"", please do not waste precious time and space with defending him, that would be truly pathetic and you know it!  I felt compelled to add that after reading some of the ""reviews"" for the Helter Skelter Murders and for actually meeting someone who is family with one of the victims.",1075420800,8,1132,4.601990049751244

Although I was a small child during the ""Manson thing"" I do recall the feel of the era and this film captures that as well as the essence of the Vincent Bugliosi book, ""Helter Skelter"".Steve Railsback as ""Charles Manson"" brings to life the kind of charisma and intensity that Manson utilized to mesmerize the members of his ""family"" in 1969.  George DiCenzo does an epic impersonation of ""Vincent Bugliosi"", the lead prosecutor in the Manson case (and author of the book). Nancy Wolf as ""Susan Atkins"" brings to life the psychopathic hold Manson had on this followers.  The film captures all of the subtle nuances that could easily be missed when moving from novels to the silver screen.  In this cut of the film (leaving out the more graphic scenes and includes no nudity), the murder scenes and photographic evidence are minimal, which does take away from the intensity of the crime itself.  What it brings however, is well worth watching.  There is another version of Helter Skelter made in 2003.  This film, made in 1976, has the clothing of the era down pat as well as having been made just a few years after the crime itself.  This film as well as the Bugliosi novel are the ""must sees"" if you are interested in any way to Manson lore.  It is not about the murders but is about the end of an era.  The Manson case brought about changes to the social scene that IS the 1960's.  Rather than viewed as ""peace and love"" the hippy scene was tarnished with the murderous rage that Manson and his followers brought to the world.  The story includes all of the components of today's ""reality TV"", movie stars, heiresses, producers and hangers on as well as psychopaths and mesmerized teens.  The Manson era ended the 60's and our collective innocence and began the fascination of crime and mind control.  A must see!",1491264000,2,1862,4.6030303030303035

Usually individuals like Charles Manson are very intelligent beings, who fall by the wayside due to what society has done to them, or their inability to bounce back in a more positive manner.

Later Sheriffs deputies raid an old movie ranch on an auto theft complaint and arrest the occupants for Grand Theft Auto. Elsewhere a boy finds a discarded revolver, it is given to the police. The Manson Family is released for insufficient evidence. Shorty Sheas name is given to two detectives, but he went missing. Two young women stop a police car and ask for a ride; they tell what they know. The police question Susan Atkins, she talks.

Vincent Bugliosi is put in charge of the Tate Murder prosecution. He is told about the murder of Shorty Shea by a former gang member. Charlie Manson used a .22 Buntline Special revolver but it went missing. One of Mansons girls talks in prison, she asks to talk to the lieutenant. But the message is garbled! Later the police find the abandoned bus in the desert and search it. Bugliosi talks to two former Manson girls about what they know. This leads to another girl. Conversations lead to information. Are those Manson girls brainwashed? The confession of Susan Atkins affects a grand juror. Indictments result. A team of TV journalists discovered the discarded clothing of the killers. A man calls a TV reporter about that found Buntline Special. There is a match! There are scenes of the legal struggle. Can some witnesses be extradited in time? Can a trick be used for a delay?

Bugliosi finds a new witness to talk about Charles Manson and his control of people. Paul Watkins talks about Mansons beliefs and the White Album of the Beatles. They read Revelations from the Bible and what Manson believed. Paul talks about their pastimes. They make a deal with Linda Kasabian to testify truthfully. Manson supporters will be subpoenaed as witnesses to keep them out of the courtroom. What kind of diabolical mind would plan these deaths? Linda identifies a revolver, then a rope. She tells about their visit, and hearing screams from that house.

The courtroom scenes continue. A headline from President Nixon causes a temporary problem. Charles Manson tries to attack the judge! Mansons lawyer asks for a mistrial, this is denied. Mansons girls stand up and speak. Manson makes a statement (without the jury present). He is full of rage and anger. The photographs support Linda Kasabians testimony. Bugliosi called for a guilty verdict for the people of California. The jury finds them all guilty. They show no remorse. The jury sets the penalty as death. But in 1972 the California Supreme Court abolished the death penalty and replaced it with life imprisonment.

This dramatization runs on too long and could be shortened with better editing. The actual murders are played down, as it should be. Im sure the book is better on details. Curt Gentry wrote Frame Up about two labor organizers, Mooney and Billings. He would later write the best biography of J. Edgar Hoover, the last Director of the FBI to serve for life. Directors are now limited to a ten-year term.",1470873600,,3297,4.838652482269503

1984856,4,B0001AVZM6,"Well, I think we can all agree that the 60s were weird. But the 70s were even weirder, which is where we find ourselves viewing this made-for-tv movie based on Vincent Bugliosi's excellent book Helter Skelter which recounts the trial of Charles Manson, Susan Atkins, Patricia Krenwinkle, and Leslie Van Houton. I read the book and loved it. I'm sort of like a dog with a bone when it comes to this stuff. I spent a few months reading everything about the Manson family and decided to watch this movie because why not?

It was made the year I was born, which was marvelous. George DiCenzo plays Bugliosi and he does a great job. The guy who played Manson really lays the crazy on thick but, I mean, I suppose that makes sense. I was disappointed that the film didn't depict more of the defendants' outrageous courtroom antics. I also found it sort of distracting that the Beatles song Helter Skelter would suddenly come on during ""shocking"" parts but only for a few seconds. But 1970s film making...amiright?

The book also captured the sort of amazing relationship between Bugliosi and Manson and that was left out of the film. I realize a movie about 2 men sitting and talking would be super boring. But it isn't until the end that they interact at all. I think that made Manson seem more like a lunatic with no rational thought than a lunatic who was actually quite intelligent. The conversations the two had were interesting, to say the least. But because this film was made just 5 years after they were convicted (except for Van Houton, who won a new trial), there was still a need to make sure Manson was depicted as if he were the craziest killer who ever lived. Since then, I think we've seen far, far worse. Don't get me wrong; Manson is a manipulative threat who would kill anyone who got in his way. But the media has definitely made him the poster child for evil, which was in full effect in 1976.

I liked the film. For a 1976 made-for-tv movie, it hits the spot.",1469145600,4,1975,4.495821727019498

I was in sixth grade when the Manson Family murdered those poor victims and especially sad was the murder of the beautiful and gentle Sharon Tate and her unborn child.  This movie scared me to death when it first came out.  A true story such as this is much more scary to me than any horror movie.  I think just the tragedy of the needless waste of life is heartbreaking too.

1984890,5,B0001AVZM6,"I became interested in the Manson ""Family"" murders when I explored Barker and Myers ranches in Golar Wash that were used by the group when I conducted geologic field work in the Panamint Mountains in Death Valley.  This show is insightful and compelling.  In an online search, I found that it was 45 years ago today, March 29, 1971, that the death penalties for Leslie Van Houten, 21, Susan Atkins, 22, Patricia Krenwinkel, 23, and Charles Manson, 36, were returned by their jurors after 10 hours of deliberation.  Tex Watson was found guilty and sentenced to death in a separate 1971 trial. Manson was also convicted for the murders of Gary Hinman and Donald ""Shorty"" Shea.  Unfortunately, all of their sentences were commuted to life imprisonment in 1972 when California briefly did away with the death penalty. Unfortunately because there are deluded people who still follow Manson.  Sadly, some people choose to be ignorant and manipulated.  That is the cautionary tale.  This is the best movie of the murders, investigation, trial and conviction of those responsible for the Tate/La Bianca murders.  It's well worth watching as a study of individual and group pathology.  It's also well worth watching for the brilliant legal prosecution by Vincent Bugliosi.  He uncovered the motivation of Helter Skelter with the testimony of Paul Watkins shown in the movie.  Bugliosi passed away on June 6, 2015 having written many books including his 1,632 page ""Reclaiming History: The Assassination of President John F. Kennedy"" (2007).  This was the basis for the  2013 movie ""Parkland"".  Sharon Tate's mother and sister, Doris and Debra, were instrumental in gaining the rights for victims to be present at parole hearings and submit victim's impact statements.  Doris Tate also helped pass the California law prohibiting inmates serving a life sentences to have conjugal visits in response to Tex Watson marrying and having four children while incarcerated.  Along with her father, Sharon's family made sure that Sharon's death meant something.",1459209600,,2042,5.198776758409786

1985142,3,B0001AVZM6,"Very long; focused mainly on the legal aspects of the case, very little to do with the personal aspects of the victims. However, compared to the 2004 version of this film, this was better in terms of the actors portraying the lawyers. I don't think the actor portraying Manson was right for the role; it was difficult to determine which of the Manson girls was which because the actresses did not look anything like the person they were supposed to represent. For example, the one playing Susan Atkins had far shorter hair and was clearly older by about 7-10 years. Susan was 21 at the time; this actress was at least 30. It did well with accurately representing the lawyers in the case, but very poorly in terms of representing the Family members and the victims.",1416960000,,764,4.625

I remember seeing this on TV as a young teen and being scared to death. This miniseries stayed with me all these years and I was happy to be able to get it on DVD.
This was fairly graphic for the time and still had an effect on me after all that time, it was just as disturbing as I remembered. With that said, the movie was presented very well as far as the events leading up to the arrest of Manson and his followers. The trial was very interesting as I didn't recall the exact events being so young in 1969 that I imagine my parents sheltered my brother and me from the news stories.

Still, HS remains the best Manson Family movie ever made. It doesn't obsess over the bloody murders themselves, as much as it recreates the time-frame, delving into the subsequent events, court case, etc. The only movie I could compare it to would be Fincher's ZODIAC.

You will be sooooo very disappointed to pay good money for the 2004 version with out having watched the 1976 version. Be sure to read the packaging closely because the two movies ARE of the same subject, but NOT the same quality at all.

As I have responded to another customer (which my response for the 1976 is a review/response to this version and is already quite lengthy and very positive about the 1976 release). There are TWO different versions and the second was a remake. There are differences for every package.

The cover art may have been released differently within this decade BUT could be the 1976 version and yet someone may inadvertantly upload the 1976 cover art when they are REALLY trying to sell the 2004 version remake.

Please be very careful as this can be exasperating to expect one version ONLY to get a version that doesn't even meet up to the original.

Make sure that the seller has the version that you want and the version most popular is the 1976 version with Steve Railsback as Charles Manson.

Double check your purchasing and know which version that you are investing in because the sellers can confuse the two and there have been mix ups like this whenever someone uploads a varying cover art , however, a completely different version.

The 1976 version is THE CLOSEST that you will EVER get to what that period was like and it is much scarier than the remake. The remake scared America (Once again) the night that they were going to air it and once it was aired, it was a joke and not even as close to the 1976 version.

Many people thought that the REMAKE would stir up ""copy cat Mansons"" and this was a TRUE CONCERN and was even written in the newspapers before it aired that night. It was a big deal for the veterans (those of us who are old enough to clearly remember the actual case) of this case.

We lived in California at the time that the remake was announced to be aired and (not for the same reasons, but because the case was sill fresh in our minds back then in the 1970s and that as a country, we were scared of this type of criminal, it was a new type of criminal at that time ---1970s---and it was something that many of us just did not understand and were frightened of the reality of this monster) there was the same tension that was in the air when the 1976 version aired and America had a reason to be nervous because THAT 1976 version hit very close to home, particularly if you live in California or are a native of California (doesn't matter which direction---Manson had a very, very long reach when he was younger and powerful at that time).",1343865600,5,2836,4.470019342359768

1985309,4,B0001AVZM6,"This is a long movie (just over three hours), and unless you have interest in the subject itself, or perhaps in the workings of the criminal justice system, it will likely seem too long. It's not too gory; there are quick photos of the victims, but no real closeups and attempts to gross us out. The worst is the Polanski manager having to rush outside to heave after he identifies the bodies.

We all know the story of Charles Manson and his devoted followers, but this is told from the point of view of Vincent Bugliosi, the chief prosecutor on the case. Makes sense; he's the one who wrote the book by the same name. And he shows us all the mistakes and false leads and dead ends, including the news team that showed up the LAPD.

Then there's the gun that was their most important piece of evidence sitting in a police evidence locker for months while nobody paid it any attention. They simply failed to connect the gun a kid had found on a hillside to the murder, even though the kid and his father made the suggestion when they handed it over to the cop. It's also heart-breaking to see the kid handle the gun carefully by the end of the barrel, explaining to his father that he had seen that done on TV to avoid messing up the fingerprints. He hands it over to the policeman, who puts his fingerprints all over it. You'd almost think he was working for Manson and wanted to trash the evidence, but it was really just major incompetence.

There was a lot of police incompetence in this case, including how long it took for them to connect the Tate and LaBianca murders despite the similarities. I guess prior to the Manson cult, they had not had sufficient experience with the wigged-out irrational, and did not recognize it when they saw it. It was Bugliosi and his constant in-depth questioning of every witness he could get hold of that finally put together the link to Manson's concept of Helter Skelter as a racial war from which he would emerge as King of the World.

That and Susan Atkins insane bragging to a friend in prison.

Still, it was quite a fight the defendants put up, and a remarkable job by Bugliosi in pulling it all together and getting convictions. They were all sentenced to death, but then California ended the death penalty. So at the end of the movie (made in 1976), each of the murderers was named and labeled ""eligible to apply for parole in 1978"". I'm assuming that's why the movie was made when it was. As we know, Manson never was paroled, and is now a grizzled old man who doesn't really want to face the real world anymore.

It's a disturbing movie, but well made. Especially for the fact that the actors and actresses really do look a lot like the people they portray. There no big names here, but the judge may be recognizable from a couple of Star Trek episodes.",1336867200,2,2805,4.436893203883495

I have this film taped off of television in it's original 2 part version. The DVD that is available today is that same version (made for TV) that has both parts 1 and 2 spliced together. What has been eliminated is the closing credits from part 1 - (it ends with a close-up of Mansons face after Vincent Bugliosi's watch stopped) and the opening credits and flashback at the beginning of part 2. On the DVD version if you look at the closing credits at the end of the movie you will still see it states 'cast part 2.' The DVD contains the film version as it was shown on television here in 1976. There was however an alternate version shown in theaters overseas at that time and that version in on the Key Video VHS release.

Many people who have owned or rented that version remember a slightly different version of this movie. For years I was told that the VHS version (that is about 2hrs long) was an edited down version of this film. While that is partially true, it also contains scenes not seen in the TV version that is on DVD.

For example, The VHS version contains: Longer shots of the crime scene at the beginning of the film, including longer shots of Sharon Tate and Leno Labianca on the floor of his living room.

Brief nudity in the Spahn ranch raid (alternate shots) not seen in the DVD version.

During the raid scene a bit of dialog between Manson and Shorty Shea where Manson says, ""It's not nice to snitch Shorty"" and Shea responds ""Go f*** yourself Charlie"" (on the DVD and the made for TV version he responds ""horse manure."")

The biggest difference between both versions is the actual murder scenes. On the DVD version they are super imposed with Linda Kasabian's testimony and shots of Manson on trial, on the VHS version we get direct full screen shots of the crime including the shooting of Steve Parent and the stabbing and shooting of Voytek and Abigale (very graphic longer scenes) which was not shown on television in this manner.

There are other slight differences that I won't go into here, (such as when Charlie first meets Linda Kasabian) but those listed above are the most noticible.

This is a great movie and the DVD is a good buy if you want the longer made for TV version. But if your a fan of this stuff don't overlook the VHS version (now out of print) - it is not just the TV version edited down, it's a whole lot more.",1294099200,6,2524,4.401287553648069
1985347,5,B0001AVZM6,"I am not a student of the Manson Family, so I don't know how accurate this movie is, but as a movie it is terrific.

It's very long.  It was a made-for-TV two-parter.  But that actually enhances the effect.

It starts slowly, and some of the acting is a little awkward.

I get the sense that this is less because of novice actors and more because of a tight budget: not enough takes.

But after a while the awkwardness ceases, and the emotional momentum continues to build.

The ordinary settings also contribute to a realistic feel.

Manson himself does not appear till well along in the film, and at first he is small and flimsy-looking.

What a shock, then, when he suddenly seems to grow before your eyes into this towering, fire-eyed figure of domination.

Railsback's performance is amazing.  He is by turns clownish, fierce, humble, reasonable, loony, hypnotic.  It is easy to see why adrift girls would fixate on him and regard his words as holy.

DiCenzo, as Bugliosi, has been criticized as stiff, and he is.  But this simply adds to the overall effectiveness.  Bugliosi's lack of charisma makes Manson's charisma seem the more overwhelming.

An astonishing film.",1285200000,2,1173,4.79

1985350,5,B0001AVZM6,"It's fascinating to read other viewpoints about this movie, but mostly because everyone notices what I did - Steve Railsback.  I've never seen any actor in any role portray a character better than this.  Railsback was so good that it's almost surreal.  His 'look', his hair, tone of voice, body shape and size, even the eerie shine in his eyes - so close to Charley that when I saw Railsback in various other roles years later I didn't even recognize him.  Then, when you read Bugliosi's vastly detailed book, today's version more than 500 pages, then you will be equally surprised at how accurate the film is.  TV films are notorious for being underfunded, which is the reason why events at Barker's Ranch were left out, but in this case the producers were so familiar with Bugliosi's account that it isn't a necessity to read the book.  In just 3 hours you get the full story and full impact of a totally bizarre, inexplicable murder case that wasn't closed until 2 years and 2 months after it happened.  Top it off with Steve Railsback uncannily portaying Manson, as well as Nancy Wolfe and the other supporting cast performing wonderfully, and ""Helter Skelter"" is incontestably one of the best docudramas ever made.",1277942400,3,1219,4.748815165876778

I watched this miniseries too and I enjoyed it. Steve Railsback does the best Charles Manson anyone could ever do.  However, it has to omit so much because the book is so huge and the show so short.  So I really enjoyed watching Steve Railsback but my heartiest endorsement is still to go read the book.  The actor who plays the author, the prosecutor of the case, is dry as dust in televised version whereas in the book he was not that way at all.

1985374,2,B0001AVZM6,"After reading Vincent Bugliosi's spectacular book, I couldn't wait to see this movie (how I missed both on the first go-round I'll never understand).  As with most very good books, especially highly-detailed ones, Helter Skelter's reduction to a movie can be painful to watch.  First, being a TV-movie, it's production values are marginal.  Most scenes take place in non-descript offices, just like a Dragnet episode... as a matter of fact, the level of writing, acting and directing is only a fraction better than most Dragnet episodes. Everything is very by-the-numbers (don't forget to include this, don't forget to include that), and Steve Railsback plays Manson bug-eyed, as if he were plugged into a wall socket. It's almost as if he based his entire performance on one very popular picture of Manson--which by no means is representative of the many faces he actually had.  Also, to hear Bugliosi tell it, Manson was a crafty con-man and jailhouse lawyer, but we are given no sense of any intelligence (and, therefore, no real sense of threat) in Manson in the film... he's just a bull-goose looney.  What bothered me most was that no attempt was made to go outside Bugliosi's point of view.  We never see Manson actually living with his people, indoctrinating them... there was no real sense of what it was like to be living in the Family, just silent montages behind voice-overs.  In scene after scene, including the murder scenes, we are told what happens instead of just being shown what happens, as if we weren't very bright. The movie you imagine while reading the incredible book will make you feel like Francis Ford Coppola.  It's hard to imagine how anyone could take that book and get this movie.

Charlie's whole trip is laid out here, from the Creepy Crawls to him on a jail bunk, with shaven head singing: ""You can feed the world with my Garbage Dump.""  And the hate stare he gives at the end is the scariest part of the whole movie!

Of all the websites out there now seeking to glorify Manson and make him a urban legend, this movie will ground you with it's ""Dragnet"" style portrayal of the savage animalistic murders and the three ring circus court proceedings to prosecute that animal and his Garbage People.

Like in the old television series ""Dragnet,""...""Just the facts, ma-am!""

There seems to be in the public mind a battle over this version of Helter Skelter and the 2004 TV movie of the same name.  I think they compliment each other.  This one tells of how it was done and how the ""family"" were convicted.  The new version gets you more into the mind of Manson and WHY it was done and WHY young college student runaways became robotic murders on the ""suggestions"" of Manson.

Interesting enough, of the major killers, all of them except Manson now recognize the horror of what they have done and take responsibility upon themselves.  Of the original ""Family,"" only Squeaky, Sandy and Bobby Beausoleil are unrepentant and as hard core as always.

For those out there who look upon Manson as a role model, WAKE UP!  There are millions of others who went through hell as a kid who became a inspiration of good to the world!  Manson deliberately heaped all his bad karma upon himself!

1985391,5,B0001AVZM6,"Charles Manson. When I think of him I see many things crop out. Angry, Demented, Bruised, Scarred, Hateful, and all of this from the world. He was born into dysfunction, and lived out most of his life in dysfunction. His mother had no name to give him as she was mostly a criminal herself, and a prostitute who probably had no idea who fathered Charlie, or even cared. That's the hard part to swallow when your mother has no idea who your father is, and doesn't even care. She thought in her self-centered mind that she was doing the best for Charlie by shuffling him around to the different family members for she knew she couldn't raise Charlie as that would cut into her drug habit, and sex time. However, it was later determined that Charlie was bi-sexual as he wouldn't think twice about having sex with either a man, or a woman. I am left to wonder if perhaps a male family member raped Charlie perhaps out of anger at Charlie's mother for not taking responsibility for her little brat. I remember hearing a line in the film: ""The Bad News Bears In Breaking Training"" where Kelly's father asks Kelly: ""You want to be your own man?"" Meaning that Kelly take responsibility for himself; I'm sure Charlie wanted that, but the question I'm sure Charlie would ask: ""How to do this?"" No one showed Charlie how to be his own man, and the closest he came was his stint at Boy's Town, but when he was there I'm sure he couldn't look at Boy's Town without looking at his mother, family, and society in general, and they all hurt him, rejected him, and now as he's nearing 73 the hate will not die, and it looks as though it's the only thing keeping him going, but for how long? I feel that Charlie somehow learned that when he grew up that he could learn power, and take people down just give your soul to the devil. Susan Atkins would also take that route as her life was marred by dysfunction as both parents were alcoholics, and mean towards her and her brothers. She turned to Christ at an early age, but she was dissulousined especially after her mother died, and her father didn't stop drinking. Patricia Krenweinkel grew up in a more loving home, but after her parents divorced her self-esteem already not strong was even dashed upon the rocks more. Leslie Van Houten would also have her world fall apart when her parents divorced, so without a doubt on edge, and nothing to lose Charlie would create his own family. A family that was his to rule and reign one where he would be able to call the shots, and he would make it appealling to his followers with sex, drugs, and music. Now bring this up to August 9, 1969, and the Tate murders. In Charlie's mind he thought that he was doing the world a favor because after all Sharon Tate, Abigail Folger and others were all smoking marijuana, and doing other drugs, and they thought they were better than him? As for his motive I feel while it was created in a drug stupor quite a bit did come true. I would feel the fact that Terry Melchner not taking Charlie seriously as a musician, and standing him up would be a more rational motive for murder, but Manson didn't know that Melchner had moved out of that house a few months earlier. Mind you this wouldn't have been acceptable either, but more rational. Many wannabe followers called this trial: ""The Second Crucifixtion Of Christ"" Anyway as I mentioned earlier quite a bit of his prophecy came true; In certain people they feel that minorities are getting preferential treatment, definition of family is becoming more and more broader, children are becoming more and more aggressive, and motive for crime is becoming more and more trivial, and God doesn't seem to be on most people's minds anymore. I don't even know where to begin as to where the country began it's downfall; was it when sexuality was starting to become more studied, was it during McCarthyism?, or when Madeline Muhaney O Hare successfully lobbied to have prayer banned from school. I know I have said I hate the 80's, but to be honest wouldn't the 80's be fruit of what the 60's became? America seems to just wish that anniversaries like this would just go away. Woodstock would be an attempt to save the 60's from despair, but got upstaged by Camille as she ripped through the Mississippi Delta destroying homes. Let's face it folks we as Americans tend to want to repress the negative, and just go on with the positive. We want to think that if we think about it that it will just come back to us, but when the pain is so much we tend to not care anymore, and just do whatever it took to just prove to everyone that we had our act together. I feel with Charlie it was repression that more or less caused him to collapse under all that weight that he carried all his life to come to August 9, 1969. This was the original telemovie aired on Thursday and Friday April 1 and 2nd, 1976 on CBS. I remember this because I was 8, and I wanted to watch it real bad, and was upset that I couldn't. I finally did at 23, and to be honest I see what I missed. The performance by George DiCenzo was good, but to be honest he's forgetable now, Steve Railsback as Manson was almost comical, but impressive. This would also introduce the world to the most famous Beatles tribute band ""Beatlemania"", and they would do an American tour the Summer of 76. This was above-average telemovie, and has the makings of a wonderful story. Not wonderful in the sense of what happened, but it stayed with what really happened.",1178150400,,5471,4.461077844311378

1985405,5,B0001AVZM6,"I have viewed this movie more than a dozen times through out my life and have always been totally fascinated by the Manson Family and the crimes commited. My grandparents had the book back in the 70's and I would always scare myself ****less looking at the crime scene photos. No idea why. I have always felt an odd connection to this era even though I was born only a year before the Tate/LaBianca killings. I often shock friends and family with intimate details of the names and dates, needless to say, I'm great at parties:)

I do not glorify what has been done though I marvel at the details. Even though I gave this movie FIVE stars it is not a perfect movie by any means, however, in light of this being a Made for TV movie from 1976 I can't imagine a more brutal or shocking depiction being made. The soundtrack is what sets off the movie and only adds to the chill.

Charles Manson, Susan Atkins, and Leslie Van Houten as portrayed here are downright frightening. The actors seem to have risen above the TV pap and have given what are probably the best ever TV Movie performances. Even the Manson gang not on trial like the actor who played Danny DiCarlo gives a riveting performance, and lets not forget the actor who helps Bugliosi translate Charlie's ""RevolAtion No. 9"". The disappointing aspects involve casting ""bit parts"" (newsman, police, wives) that often do not fly (or feel EXTREMELY dated), and in general the side of the prosecution; cops and all involved seem flat and clinical and do not have the same spark or believability as the Manson Family cast. Bugliosi is portayed adequately but it feels by the numbers in some areas.

The picture is quite clean, considering the age, and while others here seem pleased with the sound quality, the 1ch just doesn't quite cut it. I suppose since this is a drama it is ""adequate"" but so much more could have been done. I only noticed the edits on my last viewing and am shocked at them. Not so much that they were edited HERE but that they were ever aired on TV to begin with. Since when was **** (starts with an S) ever able to be broadcast? I actually have no qualm about the edits, they are few and slight, what IS important is we get the whole movie and not the chopped up (excuse the pun) rebroadcast version that is apparently still in the VHS community. You get the full movie here, and quite cheap I might add.

There is a decent A&E special on serial killers floating around that features (the real) Manson, Krenwinkle, and Van Houten. Needless to say they all seem to be singing a different tune these days. There seems to be true remorse on the hearts of the two woman, sadly it may be too late for total redemption. It is difficult to judge the hearts of men, so I leave that to God and the conscience of the parol board.",1147132800,4,2795,4.4319066147859925
1985406,4,B0001AVZM6,"Social and legal commentators have written or said the love and peace movements of the 1960's died Aug. 9, 1969, when members of Charles Manson's ""family"" descended on the home of director Roman Polanski and his 8 1/2-month pregnant wife, Sharon Tate, and slaughtered her and four houseguests. Seven years later, CBS brought the book of Vincent Bugliosi, the successful prosector of the case, to the screen, and this version remains the definitive ""entertainment"" piece of the Manson saga, far superior to its 2004 remade counterpart. And no one has equaled much less surpassed actor Steve Railsback's sociopathological depiction of the real Manson. This telepic is graphic in its brief recounting of the Tate killings and, a night later, those of Rosemary and Leno LaBianca. The film's power, though, is in its account of the legal problems that faced Buglosi as prosecutor and serves to dispell the assumption that the case against Manson, et al, was open and shut. In his protrayal of Bugliosi, actor George DiCenzo brings respect to the real-life prosecutor who, with the trial judge and jurors, endured the antics and threats of Manson and family members through, what then, was the longest criminal trial in U.S. history. Actor Railsback's Manson gets ample support from his co-defendants, played to the chilling hilt by Nancy Wolfe (Susan Atkins), Christine Hart (Patricia Krenwinkle) and Cathy Paine (Leslie Van Houten). A footnote to this production is that it features Sondra Blake, then married to actor Robert Blake, as Ronnie Howard, who shared a cell with the real Atkins and ""broke"" the case after Atkins started bragging about her role in the seven killings. ""Helter Skelter,"" so named from the Beatles' ""White Album"" song that Manson interpretted to be a ""message"" that the world was on the edge of an apocalyptic race war, remains an important commentary not only on the legal complexities of the case against the Manson clan, but it also touches on the vulnerability of those who either abandoned or been rejected by ""normal"" society and their exploitation by others seeking domination for whatever reason. A more than worthy ""entertainment"" piece, this production is well worth a viewing.",1132444800,8,2208,5.136111111111111
1985407,4,B0001AVZM6,"This movie came out the year I was born, 1976, but I had heard about the ""Charles Manson murders"" all my life. I remember as a child hearing The Beatles song of the same name (which supposedly inspired the kooky Manson to start his little race war) and being completely freaked out by it. It was after I became a very dedicated Beatles fan that I learned that the song, written by Paul Mc Cartney, was actually a response to a song by The Who that was proclaimed to be the loudest, dirtiest, most raucous thing ever done in rock and roll up until that point in time. Mc Cartney decided to top it with a Beatles ditty.

The song ""Helter Skelter"" was, originally, a 27 minute track but was eventually cut down to 5 minutes because of time limits on radio airplay. It was never a call to arms or revolution. In fact, the term ""helter skelter"" is a British word for a carnival ride. (And thank you Bono of U2 for ""stealing back"" that song!)

Director/producer Tom Gries did a pretty good job of transferring Vincent Bugliosi's account of the trial onto the small screen (the DVD was a top notch, enjoyable viewing experience). I was disappointed, though, that the actors and actresses really didn't resemble the so-called ""family."" Only Steve Railsback remotely looked like Manson. (Although, I thought the actress playing Linda Kasabian looked very familiar. The end credits confirmed my suspicion: She was Marilyn Burns, who was in the original ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" two years before).

I did appreciate the trial scenes because it makes one think of the numerous, far out objections of one Irving Kanarek (Manson's attorney), who dragged the trial on far past the time that it should have lasted (costing California taxpayers millions of dollars in the process) to the nuisance of everyone involved. Why he wasn't disbarred during that trial, I will never understand (refreshing to know he got his in the end when the US Supreme Court disbarred him in 1990).

The movie accentuated the dedication of D.A. Vincent Bugliosi and the fact that the law profession could definitely use more lawyers like him. Although a bit too conservative for me, the bottom line is he's a very competent attorney who knows his law and practices it with the highest set of ethics.

In the end, this movie underlined how much the ""victims"" were forgotten during the course of the trial. They took a backseat to the carnival antics in the courtroom and would always be relegated to an afterthought (and sometimes not even that!).

Since the murders, Manson has been elevated to a cult hero, Sharon called every horrible name in the book (the rest of the victims' names nearly forgotten, except to those who knew and loved them), and many cruel rumors were circulated during the course of the investigation and trial.

But, as the saying goes, truth is always stranger than fiction.  Those people (Sharon, Jay, Abigail, and Voytek) came back from having dinner. Sharon and Jay talked while lying on the bed in the master bedroom, Abigail was in her bedroom reading a book and Voytek was napping on the living room couch when a group of wackjobs - strung out on acid, following the orders of a pint-sized dork po'd because he couldn't get a record deal - decided to take their lives and ruin the lives of their families and friends forever.

Sad to think that Charles Watson, who helped stab a pregnant woman, now has 4 children himself until Sharon's mother, the late Doris, put an end to conjugal visits in prison for convicted murderers through her tireless campaign for victims rights. Poor Steven Parent was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time (much like Ron Goldman would be 25 years later) and equally vicious rumors circulated about Leno and Rosemary La Bianca.

The saddest part of all is that, nowadays, whenever you're seen with a photo of or book about Sharon Tate, for instance, people automatically think of C. M. and think something is wrong with *you* for wanting to know more about the ""victims"" of that horrible night in American history (people draw blanks with the rest of the ""victims"" names).

The time is way past due for the media to remember these people for the people that they were and not merely as ""murder victims.""  The time has also come to remember that Roman Polanski, too, was a victim and to regard him in a more positive light than the animal who orchestrated his pregnant wife's murder.

Bugliosi's book should be required reading on how NOT to bungle a murder investigation (Marcia Clark and Christopher Darden could have definitely benefited!).",1131753600,8,4570,4.755050505050505

1985411,5,B0001AVZM6,I am not very good with reviews but I will say that Helter Skelter is by far one of the best movies ever made about a serial killer. The guy who plays Charles Manson does a great job and he even looks like him. We all know that the Charles Manson Family murders is one of the best known murders in history and this movie pulls it off very well. There is really nothing I can say bad about this movie. It is all around a great film and a great history lesson aswell. You will not be let down when you watch this...,1123804800,,513,3.9423076923076925
1985412,4,B0001AVZM6,I was living in LA during this time and its hard to forget the fear that hit the city. This film helps recreate the fear caused by these barbarians. If anything ended the 60's it was this senseless killing. I recommended this film highly.,1118016000,4,238,4.431818181818182
1985413,5,B0001AVZM6,"I read the book, then watched the movie and with a few exception the movie followed the book very closely. Those of us who remember when Sharon Tate was killed and finally first heard of the ""Family"" of Charlie Manson felt shivers in our spine. I love horror and while this isn't graphic, it certainly hits home when you realize that all that you are watching is true and the victims were real.",1108684800,3,394,4.410958904109589
1985414,5,B0001AVZM6,"Its been more than 35 years since the Tate-LaBianca murders and the facts of those crimes may not shock people too young to remember that brief period of history or those so inured to mindless violence through the media since 1969.  But to those of us who lived through those days, especially in Southern California's San Fernando Valley, the potency of the crimes and this remarkable tele-film still reverberate today.

The movie covers an amazing amount of factual ground and does justice to Vincent Bugliosi's massive, definitive account of the Manson Family and the era in which he operated.  As a movie, it's a classic example of mixing documentary style dialogue with first-rate characterizations.  Though Steve Railsback's frighteningly realistic performance allegedly typecast him, this actually adds to the impact of his superb performance--it was simply TOO good.  George DiCenzo is appropriately business-like as Bugliosi at the start, then slowly grows more impassioned and frustrated as the travails of the justice system wind before him.  All the ""Manson Girl"" roles are performed well, Marilyn Burns is poignant as Linda Kasabian, but special kudos should go to Nancy Wolfe as Susan Atkins.  At the least, she should have gotten a supporting actress Emmy nomination, if not the award, for her stunning depiction of the robotic, demented Manson slave who was perhaps more frightening than the leader himself.  Also noteworthy are Sondra Blake (yes, Robert's ex)as the brave Ronnie Howard and young Jon Gries as the caretaker initially suspected of the Cielo drive murders.  All in all, this film stands the test of time and is even more impressive next to the sickly ""reimagined"" version that played on early 2004 television.  Some classics don't need remaking.  Just revisiting.  ""Helter Skelter"" stands in this pantheon.",1092960000,37,1836,5.2714776632302405
1985415,5,B0001AVZM6,"This is one of the videos I've been waiting for to come out on DVD for a long time.
I watched this lengthy film in one-sitting one summer when I was living alone.  I remember turning the light on at one point when the plot began to take a sinister turn.  I was grateful for that light when the movie ended and it was dark outside.  I seem to remember sitting quietly after the credits were over, and I contemplated what I had just seen.
If you read my review of the Bugliosi/Gentry book, you'll see how powerfully the story itself affected me.  Well, this presentation captures both the essence and the emotion of the narrative.  It is both chilling and compelling.  The acting, driven along by the astonishing Railsback, is among the best I've seen in a true-crime drama.
I'm so glad the filmmakers didn't cut as many corners as they could have.  They retain the essential story line and characters to assure that those who have seen the film know almost as much as those who have read the book.  Frankly a litany of all the ways the police proved themselves to be incompetent was a tedium I would gladly forego.
Both well-crafted and powerfully presented, this is a keeper, worth watching and re-watching.",1089331200,9,1207,4.555555555555555

1985417,2,B0001AVZM6,"Bought this TV classic, which has been LONG OVERDUE for DVD release, and was EXTREMELY dissapointed to find it has been censored.  Yes, censored.  I have a copy of the original 2-part on VHS, and I was stunned to find out that this DVD release is censored.
The cops raid Manson and his family at Spahn's Ranch and have gathered them up in a circle, with Charlie in the center.  The cops bring in a handcuffed Shorty, who claims he's not part of the family.  He offers to tell the police what he knows, which brings out jeers of SNITCH from the famlily.  Charlie looks up an says, ""It's not nice to snitch, Shorty.""  Shorty promptly replies, ""Go f*** yourself, Charlie.  This DVD version has Shorty instead saying ""Horse manure.""
When Bugliosi is interviewing Paul Watkins (the man who first explains to Vince what Helter Skelter means), he says that people are ""scared s***less.""  This is painfully dubbed over with a cough.
The biggest dissapointment was in that during the trail, when Linda Kasabian is testifiying about the Tate murders, the scenes of carnage (which had previously been seen clearly) are shown with Kasabian and Bugliosi super-imposed.
My question is, why?  This DVD would have been an instant 5, but I felt as though I was watching a version of ""Cannonball Run"" on TV.
This DVD release does not do this film justice.  You do not get the full impact of this powerful film due to the censorship.  Very puzzling.",1086825600,120,1430,4.68
1985418,4,B0001AVZM6,"Well, it's finally out.  About time, although it will probably be supplanted by the recent inferior CBS remake this year.  Shame, really, as this is a closer version to the book than that horrible Sweeps Month attempt.  After viewing both, I must disagree with the recent critics reviews.  Railsback plays Manson far more convincing, and even though many complain now that DiCenzo plays a ""paint-by-numbers"" version of Bugliosi, Vince himself comes off very similar (in real life) to this version.  Sorry, CBS, even having Vince at the end of your ""event"" did not help.
Features?  Well, none, really, which is a shame, but what could you put on there?  Geraldo's Manson special from over a decade ago?  Pages and pages of court documents?  The stupidest idea I heard was a ""Where Are They Now?"" bit -- honestly.  Maybe the actors, yes, but the actuals?  Please.  The extra hour of footage, normally lopped off by TBS (who used to show it A LOT) and the other broadcasters is fine enough with me.  Don't know what you could have added to this, as a director's commentary seems out of place, interviews with the cast -- well, memories tend to fade that far out.  Footage of Manson speaking just adds to the bizarre aura he still has, and frankly I'm tired of hearing him speak what was once known as the English language (I don't know what to call what he does when he opens his mouth without offending many).
Nothing beats the book, but if you need visual, this is the best one.  Not definitive; that's what books are for, remember?  Not for the squeamish, for sure, as some of the material is very disturbing, but with the ""extra"" hour of material, the purchase is cheap and worth it.  Besides, real life can be more distubring.
Almost 30 years later, it is still as close to the book as anyone will ever come.  That's definitive enough for me.",1086739200,8,1844,4.604294478527607

1985422,4,B0001AVZM6,"It's taken years to finally get this tele-film released in it's entirety as seen on CBS in two nights during March of 1976. It's a good enough print but I was disappointed that there were no extras included on this Dvd. It would have been interesting to have a documentary etc included in the pkg.
Previously this film was released by Key video on VHS in it's edited down European theatrical release version. I say edited down because although an hour was cut there were also present a number of profane words that didn't make it to Tv and also the two murders they show snippets of were not over ghosted by Linda Kasabian (Marilyn Burns) sitting on the witness stand telling about the horror the night at Sharon Tate's house.
This new Dvd version is released just how CBS presented it back in 1976 for it's first airing. Steve Railsback still sends chills down your spine as Manson and George DiCenzo does admirable job as prosecutor Bugliosi as does the rest of supporting cast. I give the movie four stars but no kudos to Warner Home Video for releasing it rather plainly.
It will be interesting to see how the new CBS tele-movie also named ""Helter Skelter"" will hold up against this still frightening account of the Manson Family and subsequent murder spree that ""scared the hell out of us all!""",1084233600,19,1299,4.603448275862069
1985423,4,B0001AVZM6,"When this first aired in 1976 on CBS-TV, it was the first made-for-TV film to really push the envelope in terms of graphic violence. But rather than detract from the film, making it more little more than a slasher pic, it brought an element that made it terrifying, and all the more real, which it truly was.
A faithful teleplay held-up by excellent performances headed by George Dicenzo as Bugliosi and Steve Railsback giving the performance of his career as Manson.
The only reason why I did not give this five stars is because of the group who performs cover versions of the Beatles' songs in this film. To put it quite simply, it is execrable. And a serious drawback to an otherwise outstanding film.",1083715200,4,704,4.64
1985424,5,B0001AVZM6,"Finally, the original 1976 movie of ""Helter Skelter"" is released on DVD.Although there are no special features, I assue when the CBS re-make, which airs in May,204, is released on DVD, it will have them. Even without any special features, this DVD is well worth the purchase price. Although some events are slightly altered, this film is 95% accurate. Considering this was made in 1976, it holds up very well. And, as I understand it, it was and still ranks as one of the highest rated tv movies of all time. Very ground breaking for a 1976 tv movie. It defines an era that ended the ""peace and love"" late 60's flower power. Charles Manson and his sick, demented ""family"" is depicted in startling reality. The film covers everything from the murders, to the compelling trial that followed. Much of the original statements and testimony in the trial are repeated here. Excellent acting, writing, production and direction. Sharon Tate, and the other victims died in a horrible fashion none of us would ever want to experiance. If the story wasn't true, we would never have believed the sick members of the so called ""Manson family"" could do such a horrific crime. The only thing I would like to add is, it's just horrible the death penalty was briefly abolished, as these killers all deserved to die instead of being kept alive with our tax dollars, not to mention it is a mockery they are even given parole hearings. I pray to God they never ever get released. I live less than two miles from the Labianca house, and just knowing it is there gives me chills. It will be interesting when CBS airs the re-make next month. Some say a re-make should not be made. I think reminding the public of how horrific these crimes were IS important, as maybe it will inspire people to continue to send letters protesting the release of the killers each time they are up for parole. All the killers now say they have found God, and should be released. Well, the victims will never get the chance, as they are buried, so I simply feel the killers deserve to rot in jail the rest of their pathetic lives. If they truly have found God, they should realise what they did deserves punishment on this earth, and they should direct their goals to helping fellow inmates to learn from their mistakes. Parole? NO WAY!I reccomend this DVD to anybody interested in learning about the ""Manson"" case. And, I weap for the victims and the victim's families. What a shame this had to happen.

No, I don't feel sorry for them; they didn't feel sorry for their victims. But I cant imagine living with the knowledge of having done something so horrible. They look so cocky as kids, and I remember the pictures of them on the news. They WERE cocky. But we age, and we can see how we might have had some silly ideas when we were kids. We moved past them.
