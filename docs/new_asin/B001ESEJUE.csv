3557327,3,B001ESEJUE,"Flesh and Blood is an interesting look at the recent rise in body modification. At one time, it was daring to have a tattoo or for a man to wear an earring. Those days are over  and people are pushing the boundaries ever farther in their attempts to change themselves.

The documentary examines several people in Arizona. One, Steve Haworth, helps people modify themselves. Among other procedures, viewers see Haworth implant metal studs in a man's scalp. The film also examines many of those who undergo modification. The film shows people who undertake suspensions in which they hang from meat hooks that are inserted under their skin.

While I enjoyed Flesh and Blood, I wished that the film had offered viewers more insight into why people undergo modifications. However, viewers have to find the answers for themselves.

Flesh and Blood is a different way to spend an hour.",1307577600,2,878,4.912162162162162
3557328,4,B001ESEJUE,"First off, I am someone who lives in Arizona, goes to some of the fetish events Steve helps organize, and know individuals who have participated in Life Suspended and belong to other circles directly related to some of the people in this film. I have seen plenty of his work in person, and although I am not personally into heavy body modification myself, I respect his talent and professionalism as an artist.

 That being said, I think that Larry Silverman could have done better putting together 5 years worth of footage into a more coherent and straightforward documentary that clocks in at roughly an hour. Even for those familiar with the scene and/or Steve's work, the first two-thirds of the movie are informative and provide a succinct but interesting perspective on the artist, his background, and the clients he works on. It seems candid and unforced like a casual glimpse into a condensed version of his life which is what I believe a documentary should be. Some of the scenes will startle those who have never seen them, and admittedly, seeing a transcrotal piercing being performed made me cringe a little. Overall, these first 40 minutes kept me interested and made me wish I could have heard more of Steve's dad talking about his son when he was younger or heard more insight from the heavy body mod clients on why they decide to take things to the next level.

 The last third of the movie is what made me deduct a star because the movie started steering into a reality television drama vibe just for the sake of drama. Flesh hook suspension is rather interesting on its own, but someone decided to add a sub-story about a girl who travels to Phoenix to suspend on her eighteenth birthday, falls in love, realizes things about herself, gravitates out of the scene, and talks about her overall experience after a certain long duration of time. Seeing how suspensions started, how Life Suspended got up and running as a performance group, and Steve recounting his own ideas on the suspensions he organizes struck me as interesting by themselves. The interjected coming-of-age mini-saga really did not fit into the movie and should have put with the deleted scenes.

 It was all worthwhile to buy the DVD and watch it, but I felt somewhat shortchanged because it could have been more in-depth while still appealing to the crowd of people who only watch the DVD for shock value.",1304726400,2,2391,4.763285024154589
3557329,5,B001ESEJUE,"It was my pleasure to view this important work depicting the world of body modification and suspension.  I've seen various media on these topics, but have only seen justice done to them by this video.  This documentary shows how Steve Haworth has radically changed the artform of body modification forever.  Of how he has perfected the art of changing the outward appearance of the human body using only the limits of his clients imagination.  Daring and innovative, he has taken the field to places where previously noone has even dreamed possible.

In this documentary, you will see how Steve Haworth has not only created new medical procedures to transform his clients, but has also invented the tools and skills necessary to carry out their dreams.

Also, the art of suspension!  Witness the subculture who pierce their bodies with hooks large enough to pull them off the ground by their very skin!

This video is not for the faint of heart, but for brave and imaginative who are ever after the means to seek and fulfill their own individuality!",1219708800,,1049,4.853932584269663
3557330,5,B001ESEJUE,"This Doc is the most engaging look at the subject of body art,for those who know about it its an intimate look at Steve Haworths life, work,and inner circle, and for those who are just finding out,its the best entrance to this world. The fantastic story is told exceptionally well and the images exquisite.
Highly recommended",1219622400,,325,4.821428571428571
8299464,5,B001ESEJUE,This is a great documentary. It covers all types of body modifications as well as suspensions.,1502150400,,94,4.9375
8299465,5,B001ESEJUE,"This is a really interesting video on body modification. The documentary very ably raises many issues whilst always being entertaining. It does this through a genuine interest and connection with the subject; also involving a number of years (I think) following the peoples' lives and development and encountering relationships, breakups and changes of mind. Bringing the people to life adds to the subject matter, which is always focussed on BM.

The documentary covers the legal problems of performing the 'surgery' and that doing the body changes without anaesthetics avoids the legal framework that is applicable to the medical industry. Allowing the body changes is important in a nation that enshrines personal expression and free will. A wide variety of operations are shown. It also goes into personal details of why people make these decisions. In fact the way the individual personalities shine through is what adds so much life to the program. One example was a man with a metal stud mohican. He was obsessed with hundreds of implants and obviously loved doing it for a long time. [But then that old constant comes along: Change.] Because time passed we also saw how the implants were later taken out because the guy had a family, wanted to be more accepted by regular society  so issues of tribe, culture, acceptance again are put under the social microscope.

The body suspension rituals are fascinating, they seem to take body modification to beyond a personal (or fashion) statement, to a kind of physical transcendence and more spiritual implications (including fakhir). It seemed to me the doc showed more females being suspended, I wondered if this reflected reality, whether there was a power dynamic at play, or if it just made good viewing. They presented the suspension by hooks as being a skill of strength, like a dare, to endure so much pain. But isn't the taking of pain commonly associated with the role of masochist, the submissive, or victim? Interesting: to conquer pain IS a kind of strength, a mastering of will and embracing reality.

No doubt some would argue such dualist approaches of interpreting personal acts in terms of master and servant are tired and don't best serve the interpretation of human experience. But, the doc presents interesting roles. For example you can't help but wonder how much Steve Haworth 'gets off' on performing the surgery - but then doesn't any doctor . . . he is obviously very skilled, intelligent and holds quite a bit of power in the community. Steves charisma is evident, but also his smugness. Women flock to him. When he goes to visit his father there are congratulatory pats on both sides.

That the documentary allows such interpretation (and no doubt some will be incorrect) is a direct testimony of a good amount of honesty, the viewer reads between the lines a bit. But I would have loved to see what the limit of Steves patience is like  what happens when he doesnt get his way? There is a lot of bravado in the documentary, everybody is having a good time, even celebratory. Partly this is necessary, a show of strength needs to be demonstrated and is admirably done so through the documentary. They are protecting a right, to practice BM, an extreme human expression in a liberal democracy; its extremity, however, is undeniable and no doubt mainstream society (or narrow minded fascists) could present a threat.",1489536000,,3394,4.945614035087719
8299466,2,B001ESEJUE,"I bought this thinking it would be a documentary about body modifications. The first 15 minutes talks briefly about body modifications, but the majority of the DVD is devoted to body suspensions and talking about the strained relationship of the star and his partner.",1471219200,,267,5.090909090909091
8299467,5,B001ESEJUE,"This movie is really interesting. Akin to Modify, but a little more extreme. Well worth a watch if you're interested in newer or unique piercing/body modification.",1446076800,,163,5.3076923076923075
8299468,5,B001ESEJUE,Awesome movie. Great video about body modification  and it's history.,1421193600,,69,5.9
8299469,5,B001ESEJUE,"I love this dvd, i have looked for it for over 3 years and this is the only place that i found it and it wasn't really exspensive. This is great for anyone who love to see piercings and body mods taking place and it def not for the squimis or people who pass out over blood:)",1369785600,,275,3.8421052631578947
8299470,4,B001ESEJUE,"I really enjoyed this documentary. Though, I feel like it could have been longer and included more information, what it DID cover was amazing.  At the end they bring people in who had modifications done by Steve that they wanted to get removed, and people whose lives changed enough by their experience with the modified world, that they changed their ways.  I thought it was a very fitting end, rather than just being a documentary praising everything that modification is. It gave the lifestyle a different viewpoint, which was really nice because people tend to neglect those who change their minds.
For anyone interested in finding out more about Steve Haworth, this is an amazing find. I am going to be modified by him this next year and it was good research in finding out if he was the perfect modifier for me and what I want.",1355702400,,833,4.659863945578231
8299471,5,B001ESEJUE,Great video. Shows how the body mods have evolved and what Steve has done also. Shows how Steve made his products and how he evolved to who he is now. I had the honor on meeting him and having body moods done by him on me too! He is a great guy to get work by too... very interesting stuff,1347926400,,289,3.8333333333333335
8299472,5,B001ESEJUE,"absolutely one of the best body modification documentaries available , steve haworth is an amazing artist as well as a brilliant designer. he designs alot of industry tools as well as performs some very beautiful modifications & there is much that can be learned from this movie , if your a just starting out or a proffesional in the business this is a must have for piercers & body modification artists.",1330819200,,404,4.704225352112676
8299473,5,B001ESEJUE,"I don't recommend anyone under 18 view this, or anyone squeamish especially if blood or pain is an issue for one, this would be difficult to watch. I'm not into pain or blood, so at 1st it was hard to take, but once realizing these people not only choose to do this, some even enjoy the pain, the scenes were more bearable or perhaps the shock lessened. I have tattoos & pierced ears, not into any further modification, yet I can watch this for the peek into a different lifestyle, and respect an adult's choice in what they do as long as no one else is harmed by their actions. This is a very graphic documentary shot with excellent production, video & sound quality. Genitals are seen close up as is bleeding & punctures with everything from surgical instruments to giant hooks--the most difficult to watch for me was the suspension which was about half of this film's focus. Haworth explained the medical, legal, moral & ethical issues, including a sentimental scene with his father discussing ramifications. The effects on relationships of these lifestyle choices was covered in detail, as was an example of someone who later chose to opt out of body modification & had his implants removed. Whether one is into body modification & suspension, or not, this is a great look into a mostly hidden or underground part of society, and one will leave the film knowing perhaps more than one ever wanted to about all sides of these choices. I didn't find Haworth to be arrogant or egotistical, but instead honest & frank, after all he did create this industry & the tools, & he expresses concern about others who may follow in his footsteps without the proper training, concern for safety or understanding of anatomy, causing harm that could easily affect his life's work & chosen lifestyle, as well as losing legal and medical freedom to continue in his field. I wish the film had been longer and included more historical references to other cultures similar practices, although some historical coverage was included it was a very brief mention. I would definitely see this again and recommend it to others.",1315612800,,2104,4.767123287671233
