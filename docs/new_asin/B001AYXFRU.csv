8572141,4,B001AYXFRU,As far as independent movies go this one is actually one to watch. Storyline was unexpected and kept me intrigued. I enjoyed this movie.,1453161600,,136,4.708333333333333
8572142,2,B001AYXFRU,"This is an epic let down. The way it started out was amazing, unique, and a refreshing change from the she used a quija board and got possessed scenario I was so happy and psyched to see what the outcome was going to be then about an hour later the brick house fell down on me

Pros

Starts off amazingly with an awesome ( The Exorcist ) like exorcism, very cool special effects, nice plot line, scarry, with a creepy feel, and excellent actors love them

Cons

About an hour into this it swiftly goes down in flames the warrior angel looks more like an alien from ( Star Wars ) wearing a haoky silver outfit with the tackiest white wig in history, Barbie dolls have better hair. His sword is you guessed it laser sword like ( Luke Skywalker ) used. The head guy of I call them the party people cause they party a lot is more like a freakin zombie when he speaks there's no feeling in it, it feels so plastic and forced. I have seen and like well made B movies, if catagorizing this it'd be an E F movie E F as in Epic Failure",1372896000,,1026,4.08955223880597
8572143,2,B001AYXFRU,I expected Shadow LIight to be a lot better. I am only giving it two stars out of the five.  It was leaning towards corny.,1354492800,,122,3.88
8572144,2,B001AYXFRU,I couldn't finish watching this movie and it was certainly not worth the money I spent to rent it.  I would not recommend watching it even if it is free!,1353888000,,153,4.1
8572145,4,B001AYXFRU,"When I popped this DVD in, I was expecting the same type of ""low budget quality"" that you'd get from most independent films, but I was pleasantly surprised. The quality of the film amazed me, the picture was crisp and the scenes were shot with precision!

The story was very easy to follow (due to great pacing) and the effects were far above average. However, what amazed me the most was the acting. Not a single weak actor was in this feature. Kudos to the filmmakers!",1244419200,3,470,4.465116279069767
8572146,4,B001AYXFRU,I thought Shadows Light was a very well-done movie!  The acting was superb; the story was captivating; the special effects were very professional.  I was so impressed by the trailer that I simply had to buy it!  I'm glad I did.,1228176000,3,227,4.487804878048781
