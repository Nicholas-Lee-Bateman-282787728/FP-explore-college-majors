8630800,5,B00H8B8CS6,The Landscapes follow the trail of Gustav Klimt tracing the source of his inspirational landscape paintings. Klimt spent the annual summer holidays on the shores of an Austrian lake where he painted many of his landscapes. It is believed he painted using a telescope. This informative documentary explores this idea along with other simple methods he used for his landscapes that are characterized by the same refinement of design and emphatic patterning as the figural pieces.,1386720000,4,477,5.2894736842105265
