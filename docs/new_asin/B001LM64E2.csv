8318547,5,B001LM64E2,Good Stories for teaching kids. My kids love these movies and they learn from the stories. Helps them to visualize the Bible. I highly recommend this series is the most accurate I have found and is neutral on Christian religions.,1483747200,,229,4.75
8318548,4,B001LM64E2,"Great! The only thing I dislike is a lot of the ""speeches"" or speakings are unnaturally fast. However, I believe my 4 year old will grasp the words eventually. Also, just a note: they use the name Jehova instead of referring to Him as ""God.""",1449446400,,241,4.377777777777778
8318549,5,B001LM64E2,"I bought the entire collection of both the Old Testament Bible Stories for Children, and the New Testament series as well. Although the Japanese-based animation is the same in both series, the flow of the storytelling and the music soundtrack is much better in the Old Testament series (although I must admit that on some of the DVDs, the story could have been shortened by 5 minutes or so). Both series are geared towards children, and it is the reason why the violence and attempted rape scenes were removed but still referred to, so that the view understands the context of the story. This is a great series for children to watch and learn about the Old Testament. It is a useful teaching tool for parents, especially if each DVD is purchased for $5 or less.",1437264000,,761,4.602941176470588

8318551,5,B001LM64E2,"A great DVD for the family, as well as sunday school & bible study. You can't go wrong. 2 Thumbs up.",1392854400,,100,3.8095238095238093
8318552,5,B001LM64E2,"This one is fairly (not completely) accurate and is well made.  Our 3 year old loves it and wants to watch ""Baby Moses"" over and over.  I liked this so well that I bought several others from the same set, but I am disappointed with some of the other videos (too much added in that isn't in the Bible).

Moses Prince of Egypt is fairly accurate and is worth getting.

I would recommend this one.  For any other of the Rainbow series - I would recommend watching it on YouTube first and only get it if it's accurate.",1373068800,,514,4.204081632653061
