7947344,5,B00005NKSA,The Cadfael series is one of my favorite.  I love historical drama and mysteries.  This show is a wonderful blend of both.,1360713600,,122,4.5
7947345,5,B00005NKSA,"My sweetie got me into this when it first appeared on TV.
I'm not usually into mysteries, esp. murder mysteries; but the acting and cinematography is awesome.
Now that I own the entire BBS production of Ellis Peters' stories; I'm going to have to read the books.
Anything that translates this well to a television format must be a great read.
It doesn't matter if you like murder mysteries or not; this series is well worth watching.",1360540800,,433,4.636363636363637
7947346,4,B00005NKSA,"Times are tough, and the priest who was responsible for Shrewsbury Abbey for some 40 years has died. Since the bishop has lately decided that Shrewsbury should be loyal to King Stephen (again), he has sent Father Ailnoth to preside. Ailnoth is rather more like a satanic priest than a godly one, right down to the eagle's claw on his staff and his hellfire sermons.

So when Eleanor wanted to confess to Brother Cadfael and he sent her to Father Ailnoth, we knew this was not going to be good. But Cadfael pointed out that he did not have the authority to grant her absolution, where Ailnoth did. Not too surprising, however, when Eleanor is found floating in the river the next day. It is easily assumed that she was turned away by Ailnoth, and committed suicide in her remorse and guilt.

Other players in this complicated situation include Catherine, Eleanor's blind sister. What does she know about the sin Eleanor wanted to confess? There is Lord Cassale, one of King Stephen's men and a vicious torturer. There's William, Ailnoth's servant, or perhaps Edmund, a spy for Empress Maud. The sneaky Giffard, and Mary, his ward. Saxons, but Giffard made an oath of allegiance to King Stephen. Was it genuine?

It's a dark story, with two beastly men: Ailnoth and Cassale. Brother Cadfael figures it all out in the end, but perhaps is not so happy about what he learned.",1336780800,,1370,4.7
7947347,5,B00005NKSA,I enjoy all the Cadfel DVDs. Derek Jacobi is excellent in these roles. The blending of  a murder mystery and a brother as a detective who was a crusader in his youth is quite interesting.,1312675200,,187,4.3428571428571425
7947348,4,B00005NKSA,"As always, production quality was excellent, and the characters believable. This was one of the more intricate of the mysteries I have seen, and it was hard to choose a likely suspect because it was easy to sympathize with the many people wanting the new priest Ailnoth dead.

There are two deaths to puzzle out: the disliked priest, and the parishoner whom he refuses absolution to, for her unwed pregnancy.

Cadfael struggles with personal feelings alot in this tale, both for the girls he has known since childhood (one gets drowned) and over the animosity the new priest infects nearly everyone with. In fact, it is with difficulty that the village mob is commanded to release the priest, whom they accuse of killing the drowned girl.

There is also a lot of political play going on to complicate the investigations. There are enforcers bent on killing any and all dissenters who oppose the current king - who is not really the ""rightful"" ruler, but holds the power, and his spies looking for the traitors, who are loyal to Queen Maud. One of these is the manservant of Ailnoth, hence a prime suspect. Being handsome, he is aided to hide by a village woman, and eludes even Cadfael for a time.

The actual series of events leading to the priest's death seems a bit contrived, and I was not comfortable with it, but there you go - editor's discretion. Maybe it is more likely in that setting as written.

The resolution is sad, as the killer has lost both his lover and her unborn baby, and has the burden of religious guilt to crush him further. The priest, unlamented, is buried on hallowed ground, while the girl is ruled a suicide, and Cadfael has to sorrow at her grave in unhallowed ground ... which he had been trying so hard to avoid.

There is a gleam of light, because there is a final love interest kindled at the end between 2 people touched by the death of the woman. I'll let you see the end yourself, though.",1202342400,,1926,4.5520231213872835
7947349,4,B00005NKSA,"As is usually the case with Cadfael stories, it is useful to read the novel in addition to seeing the DVD.  The reason is simple enough:  it is impossible to reduce a 228-page book to a 75-minute drama without sacrificing details.  In particular, the novel gives a great deal of political background information which explains the motivations behind the behavior of the principal characters.

First the background:  ""The Raven in the Foregate"" is the 12th Cadfael novel, by Ellis Peters, published in 1986.  It is set in England in December of 1141, in the middle of a fratricidal civil war between King Stephen and his cousin, the Empress Maud.  During the previous summer it seemed that she had won the war:  Stephen was in prison, Maud and her followers were in London, and Stephen's brother, Henry of Blois, Bishop of Winchester, had sworn his allegiance to her.

But Maud proved to be impossible to deal with, the Londoners revolted, and through a hostage exchange King Stephen won his freedom anew and retook London.

As the novel begins, Stephen's brother has no choice but to switch his allegiance once again, calling a legatine council to make sure that the clergy are all on the same page, and excommunicating the followers of Maud.

Among the attendees is Abbot Radulfus of Shrewsbury.  When he returns to his monastery, he has with him a cleric named Father Ailnoth, who is to become the new parish priest for the people of the Foregate.  Shortly thereafter, the King calls all of the sheriffs to him for the Christmas feast.  There Hugh Beringar is appointed the new sheriff of Shropshire, to replace Gilbert Prestcote, who died in the spring.

Father Ailnoth proves to be a disastrous choice for a parish priest.  His predecessor, Father Adam, was a kindly man, much loved, ready to forgive the penitent.  Not so Ailnoth.  He is a harsh and rigid man, strictly by the book, and quickly begins to make enemies.  Before long he is dead, and Brother Cadfael, a Crusader turned monk, locally renowned for his ability to solve mysteries, has to figure out how and why.  As usual, Hugh Beringar, his friend, serves as a partner in the investigation.

One immediately obvious difference between the book and the DVD is the season:  the DVD takes place in the summer of 1141, not the winter, while Hugh is still under-sheriff.  This change of season subtly alters the mood of the story, but does no harm to the drama.

The producers take other liberties with the plot and the characters.  In the DVD, there is actually a second key mystery, intertwined with the first.  This involves a young woman named Elenor, pregnant out of wedlock, who apparently commits suicide because of Ailnoth's harshness.  Cadfael agonizes over how he could have saved her from despair and death, and his obvious sense of guilt causes others to question his judgment as he strives to link the two deaths.  Who is the father of the unborn child?  This plays a key role as well.  In the book, on the other hand, the girl's name is Eluned; her suicide is purely incidental, yet one more reason for the townsfolk to loathe their new priest.

A common theme in Cadfael novels is budding romances between young people, and ""Raven"" is no different.  Here again, extra wrinkles are added in the DVD, introducing a blind girl, Catherine, Elenor's sister, who is completely absent from the book.

Another added DVD character is Lord Cassale, the southern nobleman who is in search of an agent of the Empress Maud, believed to be hiding in Shropshire as he quietly contacts former Maud supporters.  Cassale quickly butts heads with both the abbot and Hugh Beringar, whom he contemptuously calls ""Under-Sheriff"" every chance he can.  In the book, Cassale is absent and Hugh himself is tasked with finding the agent.  Naturally, this mysterious young man plays a central role in the story's plot.

The acting is excellent.  As always, Sir Derek Jacobi plays Cadfael very convincingly.  And then there is Peter Guinness, who plays Father Ailnoth, a dark, malevolent man with a skull-like head, billowing black robes and a heavy, ebony staff which he is all too ready to swing at those hapless enough to get in his way.  He gives his hellfire-and-damnation sermons with obvious relish, as if longing to witness the flames of eternal torment for himself, from a bird's-eye view.  When evicting some poor peasants whom Father Adam had allowed to till Church land, they protest that their children will starve, and he suggests that they should not have had so many.  He very much resembles a raven, the traditional harbinger of doom.  He represents everything that history records was wrong about the Medieval Church, with its endless meddling in politics and its heartless disregard for the welfare of the common folk.

In summary, ""The Raven in the Foregate"" should prove a worthy addition to any DVD library.  It can stand on its own, even without the book.",1038614400,9,4926,4.825775656324582
7947350,5,B00005NKSA,"Cadfael is one of my favorite shows to watch! Especially The Raven in the Forgate! Though I am only thirteen, I have watched the shows over and over again because I thought it wasn't gruesome. If you have never seen this movie and wish to purchase this item, well, I recomend it. Take it from a 13 year old. The Cadfael series have made me want to see an read more mysteries and before, I never even wanted to look at a mystery. I thought I would hate Cadfael, but now I can't turn it off!",994982400,,489,4.104166666666667
7947351,5,B00005NKSA,"Death builds a nest for itself in Shrewsbury when a new priest is sent to replace the old one, who for forty years tended his flock before passing on.  Father Ailnoth, the Bishop of Winchester's choice for the parish, is  aligned with King Stephen and his claim to England's throne.  Those who do  not support Stephen are traitors and, according to Ailnoth, deserve to die.  Abbot Radulfus, who escorted Ailnoth from the legatine council, solemnly  states that in a civil war, ""All men are traitors to one cause or  another.""
Like the staff he carries, Ailnoth is unbending.  At its  top, a claw grasps a ball, symbolic of the priest's own talon-like grip  over ""his"" lands.  He quickly evicts the farmers who tend parish  fields to feed their families.  Ailnoth denounces all who come within the  sound of his call.  He does not pray for the souls of his parishoners but  preys on their simple way of life.
Compassionate Brother Cadfael quickly  involves himself in the peasants' plight and that of a young, beautiful  girl named Eleanor.  Unwed and with child, Eleanor's guilty conscience  sends her fleeing to the monk to confess her sin so that she may receive  absolution.  Cadfael, like all monks, cannot hear the girl's confession,  only priests can.  Moreover, Cadfael is caught up in his own thoughts about  Father Ailnoth, which are somewhat unChristianlike.  Eleanor does not like  Ailnoth, but she does as Cadfael bids and goes to the priest.
She then is  found floating in the river.  There is doubt about her death as there are a  man's footprints on the riverbank and Eleanor's arms are bruised.  Cadfael  must solve the mystery. Eleanor's eternal soul is at stake.  If a suicide,  she will forever lie in unconsecrated ground.  If murdered, who did  it?
Ailnoth is found dead next, impailed on the mill's wheel.  Most  certainly he was murdered.  Suspects are as copious as a flock of crows.  One of the farmers?  The father of Eleanor's unborn child perhaps; the girl  feared the priest and his wrath so.  Or the young man named William who  accompanied Ailnoth to Shrewsbury.
New in the priest's service, Cadfael  does not believe William is what he says he is nor does the monk think  William is who he says he is.  He does not bear the markings of a servant;  his hands are too soft, his knowledge too broad.  Cadfael is able to gather  that William is of noble birth and one of Empress Maud's followers.  He has  come to Shrewsbury to enlist the aid of Lord Gifford.  Gifford, William's  father, and Gifford's brother were jailed by King Stephen.  Only Gifford  survived.  Mary, Gifford's niece and now his ward, learns of her uncle's  true allegiance.  Birds of a feather, Gifford betrays William to Ailnoth,  which is why William is a prime suspect.  Mary and William have fallen in  love; they flee to Wales once William's true identity is learned of by  others besides Cadfael.
But how are Eleanor's and Ailnoth's deaths  connected?  Are they connected?  Cadfael grasps at every straw in his quest  to see that the girl's soul rests as peacefully as possible and that Father  Ailnoth's murderer, no matter how bitter the truth might be, is exposed.  Cadfael is, after all, a good man in an evil world.
This is a  well-feathered nest of a cast.  Sir Derek Jacobi facilely brings the  complicated Cadfael to life.  Peter Guinness (Father Ailnoth) is a good  study for modern-day would-be Bible thumpers.  Raad Rawi (Lord Casale) is  as nefarious a creature as is humanly possible.  Carine Sinclair (Eleanor)  and Catherine Cusack (Catherine) play well as siblings at odds with one  another.  Sean Chapman (William) and Hermione Norris (Mary) make a perfect  pair.  Adam Bareham (Cynric), the parish verger, is quietly commanding in  his role.  Regular Cadfael castmates Eion McCarthy (Hugh Beringar),  Terrence Hardiman (Abbot Radulfus), Michael Culver (Prior Robert), Julian  Firth (Brother Jerome), and Mark Charnock (Brother Oswin) all turn in  praiseworthy performances.
""The Raven in the Foregate,""  directed by Ken Grieve with screenplay by Simon Burke, is one of the  Medieval monk's most convoluted mysterious adventures.  Producer Stephen  Smallwood is to be congratulated for maintaining the series' high quality.",922752000,6,4246,4.945636623748212
