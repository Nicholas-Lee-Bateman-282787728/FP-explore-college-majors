3171711,4,B0017H413C,This product is a nice refresher to material already learned.  The DVD talks about a multiple of CPR techniques.  The run time on the DVD was relatively accurate too.,1411344000,,166,4.689655172413793
3171712,5,B0017H413C,"I thought this was an excellent video. Clear and Easy to understand. My biggest praise would be the ""why"" explanations. Something that I personally didn't get when taking the red cross class.",1400457600,,191,5.0
3171713,4,B0017H413C,It was good but  I wanted an up to date (20130) version as now some are saying  you don't use mouth to mouth.,1380672000,,109,3.6956521739130435
3171714,5,B0017H413C,This CPR training dvd is excellent.  I am going to purchase a CPR dummy soon so that I may practice the lessons.  Very easy to understand and follow his instruction.,1356220800,,165,4.466666666666667
3171715,4,B0017H413C,"Since I haven't had CPR training in some time, I decided that a video would be a good refresher to do at home.  This video fits the bill nicely for both those who have had prior training and anyone thinking about it.  No drama, just good sound CPR basics.",1352592000,,255,4.183673469387755
3171716,5,B0017H413C,"For years, I wanted to learn CPR but I was afraid I couldn't do it and that I might be too old to learn it.  Plus, I definitely knew I couldn't afford it through a private company.  Then one day my 55 year-old husband developed congestive heart failure and survived.  No more excuses.  We took the CPR/AED certification class offered by our church for free and passed.  In two years, I'll need recertification.  However, unless CPR is practiced after the class time, many of us lose the timing or forget how many breaths, when to breathe, when to pump the chest, how to pump the chest, etc.  This CPR DVD, while somewhat monotonous (like practicing piano scales can be monotonous), is essential so that if a time comes and someone needs CPR, it'll be automatic.  This DVD has helped me build up confidence that I can do this to the best of my abilities until professional help arrives.  CPR is not a guarantee of bringing someone back to life, but sometimes it's the only chance someone has after you call 9-1-1 and while you wait for the ambulance to arrive.  Who should learn it?  Everyone, especially if someone has a spouse with heart problems or has elderly relatives or children.  One lady in the class I attended was there to learn CPR because a lot of her friends have young children, many of whom like to swim, and she didn't want to lose any of them to drowning or choking.  This DVD also demonstrates the Heimlich Manuever, which is actually done a little differently on younger children and a lot differently on babies than it's done on adults.  For all those reasons, I recommend buying this DVD and watching it over and over and over until you hear the beats in your dreams, and, if you can, take a CPR/AED course in your area.  It only takes a few hours to learn and practice.  You don't need a mannequin; use a pillow or a teddy bear.  If I can do it, so can you.",1318982400,6,1879,4.415697674418604
3171717,3,B0017H413C,"I bought this CPR video to use for my high school health classes.  It is a very thorough overview of CPR, Heimlich Manuever, AED, and some first aid basics!  However, my students thought it was very boring and repetitive (and I agreed).  The other downfall is there is no menu button to be able to choose particular scenes.",1299196800,7,323,4.5344827586206895

3171719,4,B0017H413C,The video was very comprehensive and up-to-date with the latest CPR techniques. AED's are becoming available in many public places lately and it helps to know how (and especially when) to use these devices for heart-attack victims. Many people know how to do compressions on the chest but don't know how to use and AED.,1267574400,,319,4.818181818181818
