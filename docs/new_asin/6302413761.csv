460005,4,6302413761,"It is good of Olive Films to finally bring out 1965's ""The Slender Thread"" to DVD and Blu-ray, although I found it somewhat unnecessary as a Blu-ray title.  Although the picture does package a tense story of a young volunteer at a crisis center (played by Sidney Poitier) receiving a call from an evasive suicide (played by Anne Bancroft), it is not exactly a cinematic milestone.  Poitier and Bancroft had just received Oscars several years before and this film, written by Stirling Silliphant based on magazine article was the directorial debut of Sydney Pollack.  Pollack would follow this with ""This Property is Condemned"" and few others before directing ""They Shoot Horses, Don't They?"" which would firmly set him on the map as a director of note.  The black-and-white photography by famed cinematographer Loyal Griggs is good and aside from an astutely filmed discotheque scene, there is little visual brilliance here to adequately okay a Blu-ray treatment, if one had to choose.  Poitier is brilliant as always (one is reminded of his portrayal opposite Elizabeth Hartman in ""A Patch of Blue"") and didn't Anne Bancroft have a wonderful nervous breakdown in Harrod's department store in ""The Pumpkin Eater"" so she knows the ropes.  Even Telly Savalas gives a wonderful performance here as the crisis center chief.  And despite the discotheque scene, the film is imprinted with a dated feel as there are shots of the procedures for tracing a call and even old-fashioned filing complications that add to the tension, but, in light of today's technologies make us wish we had seen the film earlier when it was more topical and less encumbered by the snags and plot mechanics that keep her all-important rescue at bay.  The film is told explicitly as a clinical case through flashbacks, something the fifties and early sixties were known to do without much real style.  (For example, ""A Hatful of Rain:"" Subject: Drug Addiction).  Social topics were constantly being mined as film prospects, (Poitier's career led the way often) and here even the star power could not bring the film fully into prominence, even though the ambiguous ending is effective.  Like Pollock's direction, it would be a few more years before style would count.  Strictly textbook, flawed, but well-acted.",1355702400,3,2280,5.066844919786096
460006,4,6302413761,"This sixties film is quite suspenseful and has a great cast - with Anne Bancroft and Sydney Poitier you can always count on being entertained. While it's a little dated, it's still a good film, even by today's standards when it comes to holding your interest. But - I'm biased. I could watch these two stars read the phone book and be entertained.",1354579200,,347,4.523809523809524
460007,5,6302413761,"Black and white was rare for a big budget film in 1965....sometimes done for effect (Psycho, The Hustler) or just a lack of funds (I believe color film at that time added about 25% to the budget).... This is a pretty good film either way.... Definitely talky, but it never seemed to get boring....pure drama....flashbacks fill in the blanks.... Poitier is fantastic as usual....very interesting all around....just watching them try to trace a phone call draws you in to the story....good stuff....different to be sure....",1350604800,4,521,5.141176470588236
460008,5,6302413761,"Stirling Silliphant wrote the script for this movie, being the primary writer for the ""Route 66"" TV series in the 60's it has a very similar feeling to one of those shows. All of the drama, the monologues, the glitz and glamour (when appropriate)is there. The movie even opens with Sidney Potier driving by the Space Needle, how cool and kitch is that? An excellent film that needs to come out on DVD very soon - as does the Route 66 TV series!

Stirling Silliphant was definitely one of the best TV writers of the 60's, he passed away in April of 2006. He will be missed. He also wrote the original  Poseidon Adventure (1972) (screenplay), and the Towering Inferno! Two classic disaster movies of the 70's!

This film came out two years before ""The Graduate"" and shows Anne Bancroft and Sidney Poitier at their best!",1170374400,5,817,4.582191780821918
460009,5,6302413761,"Was fortunate enough to come across The Slender Thread on a cable movie channel several years ago. This film is Anne Brancroft & Sidney Poitier are at their best - extrodinary performances! Poitier plays a Seattle college student volunteering at a crisis center. One night when he's at the clinic alone, a woman (Bancroft) calls needing to talk saying she's taken pills. While Poitier tries to get help for her, he keeps her ton the line while he learns about her life, family, and why she wants to die. With a brillant script by legendary writer Stirling Silliphant, direction by Sydney Pollack, and original music by Quincy Jones; The Slender Thread engrosses the viewer from the start. We're drawn into the building suspense, caring about the people, concerned for the outcome. This dramatic character study is enhanced all the more by being in black & white. Plus, it features a fine supporting cast including Telly Savalas, Ed Asner, and Dabney Coleman. The Slender Thread is a great example of perfect film making. Why hasn't Paramount Pictures released this classic on DVD?  Please, letterbox & release ASAP so it can be re-discovered by movie connoisseurs everywhere! A must own for Poitier/Bancroft fans.",1118707200,47,1213,5.034825870646766
460010,3,6302413761,"A good storyline and relationship between suicidal caller Bancroft and student volunteer Poitier. Views like a timeline of a crisis call. Crisis hotline worker has no idea how to help this woman, who due to a situation which unfolds in flashback, is compelled to kill herself with downers. The reason behind this is interesting but not explored enough. I could have done without the behind-the-scenes interludes at the police station, the phone company, etc. And there is one freaky dance sequence which is totally out of step with the drama going on, but is crazily reflective of the times. ""Wait! Let's watusi right here in the middle of this couple's meltdown!""
Bancroft and Poitier give solid performances, but I felt the pairing of some far-out 60s cliches with the story of a couple's troubled marriage was awkward. It wanted to appeal to too many demographics at once.
Still, a snapshot of mid-60s filmmaking with the delectable Bancroft (before she became Mrs. Robinson) is always well worth seeing.",982540800,11,1007,5.0359281437125745

And although Ms. Bancroft is only shown in flashbacks, her voice carries a tour de force effect of a woman that feels her life is over. The subject matter was before its time because back then it was a very hush-hush matter but the dialogue is riveting. Great perfomances with a noir appeal.",1433894400,3,409,4.54054054054054

Sydney Pollack's first feature, a script by the inimitable Sterling Silliphant, Poitier and Bancroft - two of the screen's most enduring and talented stars, a Quincy Jones soundtrack, minor or supporting roles by Ed Asner, Dabney Coleman and (one of my personal favorite actors ever) Telly Savalas. I remember how touched I was by this film and how a movie experience like this gives me such pleasure and thankfulness for Art. This was a very honest, difficult film because its topic is so relevant even today. When people talk about great this and great that, they often spout off titles that everyone knows because it is much easier to do so, but for me this film, along with A Thousand Clowns, Harold & Maude, The Third Man and a few others are at the very top of my film list. Check this film out. It is a rose.",1429488000,,990,4.385869565217392

460127,3,6302413761,Sidney Poitier was excellent.  I thought that the movie seemed more like an hour television show than a movie.  It also seemed pretty outdated due to the technology in the movie.

If you like high drama and suspense, you will love this movie. For those who grew up in the Pacific Northwest, you will love the vintage Seattle locations. Who can even remember when the Seattle skyline was so small? Finally this terrific movie has been reissued on DVD.

When watching it in 2013 or later, any connoisseur will put up with the anachronisms (the call tracing, ancient technology).  The movie keeps your interest regardless of such anachronisms, due to the fine acting and directing. It's more a study in rising to a challenge, demonstrating what real human interest is, and the selflessness needed to succeed in spite of great odds (including possible racial connotations!)",1359936000,4,593,5.010204081632653

7825383,4,6302413761,"Review of The Slender Thread
Hot Toasty Rag, November 18, 2017

Sidney Poitier is a college student who volunteers once a week at a suicide hotline clinic. When he checks in one evening, he gets his coffee, sharpens his pencil, looks at his files, and answers the phone. I need to talk to someone, a husky-voiced woman requests. The woman, Anne Bancroft, has taken pills. Sidney tries to keep her talking long enough so that he can trace her call and find out where she is.

The Slender Thread is a fantastic thriller that takes a very simple story and manages to completely engross the audience by the potential outcome. Stirling Silliphants screenplay is very interesting, and Sydney Pollack, in his first theatrical film, creates a fantastically tense atmosphere. Since the film cuts back and forth between Sidney Poitier in the clinic and Anne Bancrofts flashbacks, it would be easy for the story to drag or seem uneven. Pollacks direction keeps the main goal in sight and constantly moves towards it in every scene. I guarantee youll be so enthralled by the film, the ending will come too soon.

Sidney gives an excellent performance, trying desperately to save Annes life even though hes a once-a-week volunteer. Hes nervous, ill-prepared, and doesnt always play by the rules. Rather than acting as a bottomless well of human kindness, he gets frustrated as the time ticks on. Heand the audiencebecomes emotionally involved with Anne, and before the end, everyone in and watching the film will be hanging by a slender thread, waiting and anxious to find out what will happen!",1510963200,,1581,4.913857677902621
