7856139,5,6303933327,"Shicka-Shicka Kaboom!  (The MSB 'Kicks Up a Storm)

It's high summer at school and hot, hot, hot.  Carlos is working on a rain catcher, but there's no rain.  Ralphie stares out the window and concludes that what they all need to cool down is a big thunderstorm.

The only problem is that the kids don't know how weather is made.  Is it water?  Is it moving air or the heat from the sun that creates weather?

Well, of course, there's nothing to be done about it but to get out there, take chances, get messy and make mistakes!

The children learn all about weather but not before they are turned into water droplets, ride on falling ice crystals and get whooshed about in a thermal updraft.

Shicka-Shicka Kaboom!  Ralphie gets carried away as your children will be with this delightful video.

Five Stars.  Top notch Edu-tainment.  My kids (3 and 5) love these MSB videos, and this is one of their favorites.",1121385600,2,909,4.530864197530864
