8066348,2,B0009SRUR4,"Only a die-hard Bjorn Borg fan would dare see or find this movie, which nearly kills comedy and tennis in one stroke, using the popularity of Borg and Ilie Nastase (shown in opening sequence) to draw you into this stinker ""Racquet,"" drawing its plot line from the Hollywood notion that tennis instructors are hustling gigolos or aspiring actors, with amiable Bert Convy(fictional tennis pro, Tommy Everett) pulling this clunker through its paces with the over-the-hill group, (Edie Adams, Phil Silvers) hustling for love while providing money for Everett's ambitions which a are not materialized until he meets up with his former flame, Monica Gordon (Linda Day George). At the start Tommy gets the volunteered 'advice' of Charlie, (Bobby Riggs, yes the chauvinist pig) the club know-it-all. As Convy goes from locale to locale in his old porsche roadster, the tennis motif crashes into left-over ""It's a Mad, mad, mad..."" gags that only get polished with trendy profanity and crass humor fit for the Moulin Rouge geriatric set. Hang in with me here, we will get to the highlight Bjorn Borg moments, but first we must follow Tommy and Monica up the coast to the Monterey peninsula exactly where Eastwood filmed ""The First Time (I ever saw you)"" interlude under the falls so teasingly with Donna Mills, but here a dreadful aping to a tepid romantic song. Never mind who does what to whom, just about when you want to know where the tennis went, Tommy Everett gets to 'challenge' the current Wimbledon champ at a spot like Vegas. In front of plenty Borg fans, they show about 6 simulated points (Convy is really a novice folks). It is the only moment filmed you will see Borg get as angry as John MeEnroe on a point, and he does a good job getting emotional (probably a release for him) for one point. However, on match point (4 minutes of screen time) Borg wins. (How could he not?) Of course, after showing tennis pros as jerks, hustlers and worse for an hour the writer gets romantic and has the two love-birds, Tommy and Monica, make up and agree to marry with the question posed with tennis balls on an empty court. Fade out. We don't know today what made Borg quit the game, but it could have been that he gave up his fortune to buy all the copies in storage. This film did not launch anybody's film career. Convy went back to TV game shows. This is a dreadful film that should have gone down with the Titanic. All the tennis stars: Borg, Nastase and Bobby Riggs got hustled by Hollywood here.",1421020800,,2497,4.6643990929705215
