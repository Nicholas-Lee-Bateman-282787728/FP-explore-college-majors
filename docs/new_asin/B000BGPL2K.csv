8086430,5,B000BGPL2K,"As a non-musician who loves Ralph Stanley's music, I'm happy to say that this DVD is not primarily a banjo instruction program. While Stanley demonstrates some of his banjo picking techniques, the disc also has excellent footage of Stanley performing and conversations between Stanley and one of his strong advocates, folksinger Mike Seeger. As such, the DVD is a treasure for folk musicians but also for those of us in the audience.",1456099200,,433,5.027777777777778
