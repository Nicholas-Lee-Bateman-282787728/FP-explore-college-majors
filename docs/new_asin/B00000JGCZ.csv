1232076,5,B00000JGCZ,"I have almost all of her books but have also ordered them to listen toon audible just to take notes for my own writing (All of her non-fiction.) Her faith series is illuminating and she has the exquisite balance between writing heartfelt, sometimes heart-breaking prose and in the next moment can have you laughing so hard tears are rolling down your cheeks. Her work is masterful. So seeing this video (I want to buy a copy just to have) was such a treat, I just can't tell you how much I love her work and how much she has taught me about writing and life and faith as well. If you love Annie's work, watch this film, it is a complete delight. Thank you so much to those who made it. You have given us a great gift.

Blessings,

1232077,5,B00000JGCZ,"I am an old person but a new writer struggling to find ways to say what I need to say. I have watched this video 4 times in two days and that includes the extras. Anne Lamott shows you how to listen with your heart. She embraces her fears so you can meet your own. In my office, I am disappearing behind a mountain of wonderful books that are straining to teach this unruly mind of mine. No matter how tall that mountain gets, Bird by Bird will always be on the top.",1337126400,,466,4.021505376344086
1232078,4,B00000JGCZ,"After reading bird by bird for the first time it became a book I returned to everytime I couldn't write or I couldn't find any good reasons to keep on writing, or just simply when everybody laughed about my desire to bring words into the page, somehow Annie Lamott saved me every time, just like this film portrait will do the same, an experience to charge energy like those who attended her seminars.",1270598400,3,401,4.506849315068493
1232079,3,B00000JGCZ,"This is a film record of Anne Lamott's lecture on writing dating back to around 1998.  It provides some insight into the person I consider one of the greatest writers of the Baby Boomer generation.  But since Annie is so topical (and since this is in truth intended as snapshot in time), some of the material is dated like a Johnny Carson monologue.  But it's still enjoyable and well worth owning for Lamott fans.  I would love to have something similar that was made in 2009.",1242950400,14,477,4.511627906976744
1232080,5,B00000JGCZ,"Anne Lamott is one of the finest writers of fiction and nonfiction in America! Her book, Bird by Bird, has proved extremely useful to me in my own writing, and in a Creative Writing class I teach. I will be ordering the DVD to show to my students this summer.",1240099200,11,259,4.2

1232082,5,B00000JGCZ,"I love this Video!  I am a Lamott fan and first heard her on a radio show.  I was attracted to her wit and humor BUT that humor and wit (as with so many comedians) was clearly grounded in deep personal pain and suffering.  So, I started reading her books and was pleased when this short video became available!  It is short! Only an hour long,  but it follows Anne through some interesting vignettes in a one year period of her life.  There is one scene where she presides over the gay marriage/wedding of two men in an outdoor wedding ceremony that may not be for all or appreciated by some.  Other than that I liked her letting us in to her life to show us that one can lift themselves from rock bottom of addiction and suffering.  There is a scene of Anne with a piece of paper, a bottle of white out, and her writing on the page looks like that of a school child's!!!  Yes, she writes like all of us did, excrutiatingly trying to get something, ANYTHING!, down on paper.
In another scene, she takes her son to an old age retirement nursing home.  Although a successful writer, her sprirituality still is in front as she reaches out to others.  There are many church scenes in the movie where apparently the churches that she belongs to have sustained her and helped her come out of her addiction and alcoholism.  Some of the church scenes could have been edited down a tad but this is a minor complaint.
When she is shown speaking at Book Fairs, there are shots of her audience.  Many in the audience respond to Anne and connect with her and others are shown bored out of their gourds! and/or not knowing quite how to take this quirky lady!  That's OK.  That's Anne!!  Either you immediately adore her or you can't quite figure out what she is all about --- this is shown in the video through these scenes of her book fair audiences.
She describes the torture of the craft of writing and there are scenes of her presiding over her writing classes which she clearly states she teaches because she needed the money. She is up front and honest and not afraid to say she was broke.  What I like about Anne is that she is a writer that strives to connect her Heart to her Voice - her writing voice - and now that she has found her voice, it is a magnificent treat to savor.
I love to introduce my friends to the work of Anne Lamott and the video and one of her books often does the trick!",1016236800,26,2387,4.280623608017818
1232092,5,B00000JGCZ,"I received the DVDs on time and they worked in my player.  Even though this was filmed in 1997, it shows Anne Lamott's spirit and faith.",1424995200,,136,4.230769230769231

1232095,2,B00000JGCZ,"I have read Bird By Bird and it's an excellent book, but  typically I don't like films where writers talk about their mundane lives (which is so much like yours and mines) as opposed to discussing writing and their experience as writers (ideas, plotting, publishing, writers, what they've learned, etc.).  It was okay, but not very enlightening.",1404777600,,345,5.035087719298246
1232096,5,B00000JGCZ,"After reading many of Anne Lamott's books, it was a treat to see and hear her.  She seems to be a very good teacher as well as a writer and speaker.  This film completed the portrait.",1399766400,,183,4.055555555555555
1232097,3,B00000JGCZ,"I liked the scenes which showed her growing up, the background of her life, but the scenes of her reading or giving lectures were a little over-long.  I watched 'Speaking In Strings', a documentary that followed the famous violinist Nadia Salerno Sonnenberg.  That is a documentary format that was nominated for an Academy award, and for good reason.  It really kept you 'engaged' with the essence of the person underneath all the fame.  You felt the vulnerability, the strength, the high's and lows of her being.  I watch it again and again because it's so inspiring.
This .... well .... doesn't come anywhere near that level.  This is not to say Anne Lamott isn't inspiring, I just didn't think as highly of the documentary format.",1386979200,3,733,4.824
1232098,5,B00000JGCZ,This is a great dvd about writing and faith at the same time. Anne Lamott has a great sense of humor and is very down to earth. The dvd is worth watching even if you don't want or need any tips on how to become a writer. Very heart-warming about God and the human condition.,1385337600,,274,4.0
1232099,5,B00000JGCZ,I think Anne Lamott is a great writer and I enjoy her humor in her books and also the depth of feelings and encouragement of faith.,1380240000,,131,4.076923076923077

7912051,5,B00000JGCZ,"I don't think there is anything written by Anne Lamott that I haven't liked. This is becoming (maybe it already is) a classic for writers. It's more than that though. Even for people who do not write, this is a book of meditations, thought provoking, and also a book of stories, very readable. I read it to learn something about writing, but I found myself reading it for the writing - a book worth reading just to enjoy reading it.",1461628800,,432,4.4125
