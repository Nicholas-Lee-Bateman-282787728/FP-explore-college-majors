8171578,4,6304242026,"The Beatles are now, of course, very popular in the US, but on February 9, 1964, America was getting its first glimpse of the ""youngsters from Liverpool.""  ""All My Loving,"" the first of five songs, is shown here.  Three other songs can be found on the ""First US Visit"" documentary.  The Beatles play their first concert at the Washington Coleseum, of which we see 3 of the 12 songs.
The Beatles begin work on their first film, ""A Hard Day's Night.""  This is immediately with the World Tour.  Two songs from Australia are presented here.  This movie is very good, but it would be better if we had a few more live performances.  I also reccomend ""A Hard Day's Night.""",1021507200,,665,4.491666666666666
