8417717,5,B003NHBVD2,"This is an authentic look at Christmas around our nations capital, and even a trip up to the NYC! There are 4 separate adventures on this disc, when even just one would be worth the price. You'll be taken through some adventures around some national monuments, such as the Capitol and the Jefferson memorial, see some famous store window displays, as well as travel through the producer's house to get the full ambience of Christmas. My favorite are the shots off of his porch to show the beautiful snow! You get a white Christmas effect without ever leaving your couch. Then, in my favorite of the films, we get to go up north to Rockefeller Square to see the famous Christmas tree! I'm buying multiple copies of this disc to send out to my family.",1394755200,,749,4.555555555555555
