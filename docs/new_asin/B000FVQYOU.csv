8127424,2,B000FVQYOU,"While the movie was delivered quickly and as described, it was just a plain bad movie.  A B movie for sure, maybe worst.  So was the other movie, Little Laura and Big John.  I wouldn't waste my money on it, if I were you.",1409184000,,221,3.977272727272727
8127425,2,B000FVQYOU,"Of our special interest was ""Little Laura and Big John"" which was loosely based on the famous 'Ashley Gang' of eastern Florida from about 1912 to 1924.  The filming for the movie was in Stuart, FL, our hometown.  We were watching for the background scenes / locations and also for any local extras we knew.
Having done a great deal of historical research on the Ashley Gang and especially when they died on Nov. 1, 1924 at the Sebastian Bridge by the 7-man Sheriff' posse ... there was a great deal of 'liberty' taken by the screen writer and director int he story they told.  So, don't believe everything you see about the Ashley Gang and especially about Laura Upthegrove and John Ashley (as children).  Too bad the writer didn't stick with the actual facts -- those were so much more interesting than their 'story line'.
The other problem we had was the editing of the film ... it just didn't flow well.",1217289600,,906,4.539877300613497
8127426,5,B000FVQYOU,"The best uncut print I have ever seen of Little Laura And Big John (1972).
It would have been nice to see Karen Black and Fabian Forte have a reunion
or even a commentary. Van Nuys Blvd. on the other hand has a very informative commentary and also an excellent print.
Nice additions to your dive-in collection.",1208390400,3,310,4.456140350877193
8127427,3,B000FVQYOU,THIS MOVIE WAS FILMED ON LOCATION IN MY TOWN AND MY GRANDFATHER AND FATHER HAD WALK ON PARTS IN THE FILM AND I WAS EXCITED TO SEE IT ON DVD..,1176163200,,141,3.7333333333333334
8127428,4,B000FVQYOU,"I was surprised to see that this movie was released on DVD.  It's been out-of-print on VHS for about 7 years.  I was a little hesitant to buy this movie when I saw that it was released by Brentwood.  Most of the time, their releases look good, but some of them are pretty crusty looking.  For this DVD however, Brentwood have excelled!  The movie is presented in it's original theatrical format and looks great!  The sound is loud and clear.  I would have given this movie 5 stars, but the fact that it's a double-sided disc with ""Little Laura & Big John"" on the other side, lost points with me. I would have preferred this movie to be on a single disc because double disc DVDs have a tendency to experience DVD rot when the glue that bonds the 2-sides starts breaking down.  Other than this, it's a nice trip back to the '70s!  You have the option of watching the movie with drive-in sound effects or you can just watch the movie regular.  If you like movies like ""The Pom, Pom Girls"", ""The Van"", or ""Malibu Beach"", then it's guaranteed that you will like this blast from the '70s past, with bad disco music to boot!",1169510400,3,1117,4.352657004830918
8127429,5,B000FVQYOU,"Van Nuys Blvd is classic Crown International. The basic plot, Bobby gets bored with his life in a small town. Sure he's got a cute girlfriend and a mobile home. He wants more. He sees a news report about kids cruising Van Nuys Blvd. He gets in his van and heads out to LA for fun. He shows up at a drive in burger joint with his beat up van and still gets lucky with the ladies. It's amazing. And so plotless that it's like watching a documentary about SoCal culture in the 70s. I can't get enough of this film.

The same can't be said about Little Laura. it has a great cast and yet is very annoying. it wants to be an artsy version of Bonnie and Clyde. But the crimes are mostly against viewers. Such is the fate of a double feature. Get worked up watching Van Nuys and get it on with your date during Little Laura.",1158624000,4,817,4.074534161490683
