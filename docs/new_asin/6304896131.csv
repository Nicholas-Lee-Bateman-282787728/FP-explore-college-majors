8079026,5,6304896131,"Grouse Hunting, like other Tom Huggler videos, is very good! There are practical tips about the actual hunt and it has great footage showing the fun of hunting with a dog. There's beautiful photography of the birds, and good information on what grouse like to eat and the best habitat for flushing them. There are interviews with conservation experts about the declining populations and what hunters can do to help prevent that. Talks with several old hunters share good hunting stories. There's practical information about gun choices, and how to dress comfortably for a good hunt. I have been hunting in Wisconsin and Michigan nearly 40 years and I think Grouse Hunting is an excellent video for both new and experienced hunters.",985651200,4,731,5.0
8079027,1,6304896131,"Title of this video indicates that there will be actual grouse hunting scenes and shots to see. Instead what you get is long long boring lectures and irrelevant topics. Tom Hugler looks like a marketing person of a shoe  manufacturing compnay. He keeps on telling you about shoes, socks, hunting  vests, food & habitat of grouse, grouse conservation organizations,  feather colors, dogs etc, sitting on a comfortable chair in a room. Just a  few blurred scenes of dogs flushing grouse in very thick cover. Only one or  two actual shots fired on grouse during total 45 minutes of film. A  complete waste money and time. What you expect in a hunting video is the  filming of actual hunting scenes. No one is interested in learning basics  of upland game. Every average hunter knows which shoes to wear, what kind  cloths and guns are required. A lot of time wasted on interviews and  showing techniques of research workers of a grouse conservation society.",957744000,12,954,4.833333333333333
