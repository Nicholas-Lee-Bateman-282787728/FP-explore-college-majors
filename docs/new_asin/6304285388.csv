824135,5,6304285388,"Dean Jones and Hayley Mills star in this film about a teenage girl whose ornery cat becomes a surveillance tool for an FBI agent on the trail of two kidnappers.  Unfortunately, Mills has to keep this a secret, which isn't  easy seeing as how she has a sister who isn't exactly being cooperative (a  hilarious performance by Dorothy Provine, in a much more assertive role  than she usually plays) and a boyfriend named ""Canoe"" who thinks  she's cheating on him.  Add to that a snoopy next door neighbor and her  virtually-deaf husband, played respectively by Elsa Lanchester and William  DeMarest (they literally steal the show from the rest of the cast) and  you've got a comedy that is full of belly laughs and able to withstand  repeated viewings.  If you're a big Hayley Mills fan, as I am, then this  film will be fun for you regardless, but one of the other reasons I like  this film so much is that it features many of the 60's TV show character  actors: Neville Brand (""Laredo"") and Frank Gorshin (the Riddler  from ""Batman"") play the kidnappers, and Grayson Hall (Oscar  Nominee for ""The Night of the Iguana) plays their victim; plus there's  a hilarious bit at a drive in with Richard Deacon (Mel Cooley from  ""Dick Van Dyke"").  But by far the actors most deserving of  attention are Elsa Lanchester and William DeMarest as Mills' next door  neighbors - the scene at the end where Lanchester gets what's coming to her  is worth the price of the video, plus some.  One more comic bit worth  noting: watch for Ed Wynn as a nervous jeweler (he's not on there long, but  you'll be laughing the whole time he's on the screen).  Great fun, arguably  the most underrated Disney Comedy ever.",956707200,59,1692,4.609427609427609

With the selection of movies nowadays, I really miss ""Wonderful World of Disney"" that used to come on every Saturday or Sunday night.  THIS is one of those movies.  There's no violence (though it is implied), no swearing, no nasty attitudes (except the bad guys and even that's mild).  There may be smoking (it's not the horror that it is now).

DC is a prowling cat about town who, on an evening excursion finds his way into the apartment where the men are holding up the woman. When he returns home with a gold watch around his neck with a scratched inscription calling for help, Patty (Hayley) is convinced that her cat can find the thieves. She goes down to the FBI office and personally enlists the help of Agent Zeke Kelso (Dean Jones) to solve the case. What ensues is a sneeze-fest, and a group of agents tailing the ""informant.""

An agent from the FBI, who is also allergic to cats ;), sets up surveillance in their home...in her sister's room.

828269,5,6304285388,"Ok, so I am a bit biased. The authors that wrote the book, ""That Darn Cat"" were my great aunt and uncle, The Gordons. As a kid, Milly and Gordon (yes, his first and last name were the same, Gordon Gordon) sent me their latest book, (they wrote 19 books) complete with a stamped black paw print (for D.C. their cat)  on the page where they autographed it for me. Yes, they really did have a cat named, ""D.C."" He was quite a cat, too. All throughout my life I wrote them letters regularly and they always wrote back. They were such lovely people. Very generous. I was a writer, too and I sent my childhood stories to them to critique. I enjoyed having them critique my writing. I took advantage of their help.

We stayed in touch my whole life, but Milly was very ill with bone cancer. She died in 1979 never to have children.  Gordon remarried and I attended their wedding with my dad.  I spent a week with Gordon and his new wife Mary Dorr in their home in Arizona. I don't recall when Gordon left Encino but it was probably after Milly died. The Jackson 5's purchased their Encino home and the rumor is that they destroyed the entire home and build their own. I will always remember the sign that was attached to the stucco arch over the driveway that said, ""This house was bought and endowed by a cat."" How I wish I could have that sign.

  I saw D.C. from time to time during my visits, but he was very independent. He had his own routine and came and went as he pleased, much like the movie.  As my own kids were growing up, they watched ""That Darn Cat"" and I told them that the authors of the book were my great aunt and uncle so they would of been their great great aunt and uncle.  I shared stories of my visits with them as well. Every year we received a Christmas card from the Milly and Gordon. They made such a lovely impression on my life that I kept every Christmas card and handwritten letter.  When visiting them we swam in their lovely pool at their home in Encino Hills. Milly was my grandfather's sister on my dad's side. My grandfather was Earl Nixon. Earl and Milly were siblings.

 I am now an author myself, thanks to The Gordons for all their encouragement. I am a retired military wife and I wrote, ""Faith Steps for Military Families."" (www. LisaNixonPhillips.com) I only wish Gordon and Milly lived long enough to see my book published. If you have small kids in elementary school, ""That Darn Cat"" is a great family movie. It's story line and funny characters really take you back in time to those wonderful days gone by.  The Gordon's were wonderful people with big generous heart.  I treasure all the books they wrote and autographed to me. Such a treasure now to have for my grandkids some day.",1431129600,,2722,4.34319526627219

828417,4,6304285388,"That Darn Cat! Movie Review For Cat Lovers!

 A bank robbery  a kidnapping  and a Siamese caught in the middle of it all.  Can D.C. (short for Darn Cat) lead the good guys to the bad guys and save the day?  And be cute at the same time?
 That Darn Cat! (1965) is a comedy featuring Hayley Mills, Dean Jones, and Roddy McDowall.  And some highly talented animal actors, especially the Siamese who played D.C.
 Lets face it, the real star is D.C.  Watching his antics is priceless.  The whole duck scene is worth the cost of the DVD.
 D.C. is handsome, cute, and funny.  A Seal Point Siamese, D.C. commands every scene hes in.  Its hard to take your eyes off him.  I loved him just being a cat  a perpetually hungry cat.  Hes adorable when he wants some fish or part of a sandwich.  D.C. is smart, tricky, and his own cat.  No one owns him.  He does as he pleases - as cats do.
 This great Disney family feature was released in 1965 but still resonates with funny scenes, innocent romance, crime suspense, and fun.  Yes, this is a fun movie, especially if you love cats.  And if you love cats, check it out on DVD!  4 stars!

828764,3,6304285388,"So-so Disney flick. Started with promise, but descended into far too much slapstick. The movie is simply too long for the very sparse plot.

Here's a head-scratcher or two. What are the odds of THREE unrelated people in Anytown, America having a British accent, namely the copycat of Gladys Kravitz, Roddy McDowell and Haley Mills? Yet, Haley's sister, Dorothy Provine, hasn't a trace of that accent. Further, it seems curious that Miss Provine was cast as a person living at home with Mom & Dad (both of whom are out of town during the escapades), given that her real-life age at the time was 30.

829210,5,6304285388,"""D. C."" stands for ""Diabolically Clever!"" (& ""Darn Cat!""). The F. B. I. is looking for the two thieves (Dan & Iggy) & bank teller ""Margaret Miller"", the duo they kidnapped & used as a shield their escape on a Monday or Tuesday afternoon. After D. C. smelled the salmon (that Iggy had just purchased), D. C. followed Iggy to their hideout. While there, Margaret Miller very carefully, quietly & secretly put her wristwatch around D. C.'s neck, then let D. C. out, to go to of the burglars & kidnappner's house. Margaret Miller's wristwatch is what triggered the F. B. I.'s search for her! Tuesday evening, D. C. Randall lead the four F. B. I. agents back to Patti & Ingrid's home, after realizing it was being followed when agent Cahill's foot hit trash of empty soft-drink cans was what made D. C. decide to ""break off contact & hide from the four F. B. I. agents, temporarily"". After agents Graham, Cahill, Spires & Kelly rendezvous together & re-locate D. C. Then, D. C. leads them back to the Randall's home, where F. B. I. Agent, Zeke Kelso, Patti Randall & Ingrid Randall are. Ingrid had just came into her bedroom, from work & first met F. B. I. Agent, Zeke Kelso.
(After a special request, by Zeke Kelso asking Supervisor Newton if he alone ""Zeke Kelso"" might follow D. C. & Supervisor Newton agreed). Wednesday evening, Zeke Kelso followed D. C., as D. C. was part of Patty dated with Canoe, to a drive-in theatre after being chased away from the drive-in, D. C. then went to Gregory Benson's home (to his cage of pigeons), Gregory Benson mis-aimed at D. C. & shot the back passenger tire of his own car, instead! The gunshot then lead Zeke to call the F. B. I. Headquarters, after Patty and Ingrid told Zeke of the pigeons were Gregory Benson's, Zeke called back & admitted that it was not the kidnappers' hideout. Gregory Benson then chased Zeke Kelso into the Randall's home then ""dumped"" Ingrid, from his daily drive to work. After Gregory sees Zeke, in the Randall's closet to stop his persuing, Zeke says ""the wiring is all right"", (to hide the Top Secret fact, that he is an F. B. I. agent, from Gregory Benson).
 Thursday morning: Zeke Kelso packs up the  F. B. I. antenna & leaves the Randall's home (but just temporarily) due to Patty Randall's accented voice and call back to F. B. I. from jeweler Hoffstedder's office building, (as ""Daphne Hoffstedder""). Later that Thursday evening, comedy really breaks out when Wilbur MacDougall calls the police on his ""over-snooping wife""! Later in the evening, Zeke hears Dan & Iggy talk, through the ""miniature microphoned wire-tap, inside the collar, around D. C.'s neck,"" just before Patty followed him, as Zeke was following D. C. quieter than a mouse! Approximately 5 minutes after Zeke heard Dan & Iggy's voices, the microphoned collar was taken off of D. C. & destroyed by Dan. Then when Zeke meets Dan, Zeke speaks of being aircraft engineer, just to stall Dan & Iggy as the 4 other F. B. I. agents, Spires, Cahill, Graham & Kelly come to the 132 8th Street apartment address. Then as Dan and Zeke spoke together, for a minute or two, Dan refuses to believe Zeke. Then, Patty knocks on the door & picks up D. C. then Dan pulls out a pistol, aiming it at Patty & Zeke. Dan threatens to take Patty as their new hostage then, Patty ""pitched"" D. C. back into Dan's face & then the fist combat between Dan & Zeke began.
 Seeing Dan is losing, Iggy tries to escape the apartment alone, then Patty throws out a majority of the cash out of the suitcase & starts kicking Iggy's shins. After Iggy finally escapes Patty's kicking, he falls off of a stairway to the ground outside & is arrested by the F. B. I. agents Kelly, Cahill, Spires & Graham closing in & finally wrap up this hysterically humerous F. B. I. case! Iggy's last words were (in a moaning voice of being found, caught & arrested, were ""That darn cat!"" Same as the movie title.
Saturday Morning: Patty & Ingrid glance through the newspaper of the crime that was solved, Friday evening. Ingrid notices ""Canoe got trapped up in an electric garage door"". They chuckle together about it & then the doorbell rings by Gregory Benson, ""Ingrid's {previous car pool & date}"", Grogory accidentally walks Ingrid to Zeke Kelso's car and she leaves with Zeke to work. Gregory is frustrated, then Canoe drives up & hits Gregory's car damaging the body. Canoe said a quick apology of ""Sorry, Mr. Benson"". Canoe then admits to Patty that he was following/spying on her, thinking she was cheating on him, (until he was caught in the electric garage door & just before Margaret Miller was finally rescued). After admitting & telling Patty of his thoughts, both go inside the Randall's house, together.
2 CLOSING SCENES: 1st, Mrs. MacDougall is back home & threatens to kill "" her husband"", Wilbur MacDougall for calling the police on her! 2nd, D. C. and a tabby cat, lead a group of five growing kittens to follow them, as Bobby Darin sings the closing lyrics of ""That Darn Cat!"", as the movie's closing credits appear on screen.",1409097600,,5033,4.602449888641425

Well, let's see, Hayley Mills and Dorothy Provine are two absolute cuties and Dean Jones is just right as the concerned and somewhat bumbling male lead. The crooks are just bad enough and the star of the film, DC the cat, has just the right persona to make this movie a hit.

I bought this copy to use with a class of English Language Learners (6th grade).  I did explain the movie was made some 45 years ago and was Disney ""Squeaky clean"" made while Walt's influence was still very much there.
I enjoyed it as much as I did when I was 8 years old but with the knowledge and understanding of Siamese Cats, having been staff to two of them for some 25 years.

Disney expected all of its comedy movies to end up on television and filmed them in full frame. Even George of the Jungle should be seen in full frame!
So ignore those 1 & 2 star reviews, the only way to make this widescreen is to crop off the top & bottom of the full frame picture.",1307232000,4,392,4.103896103896104
830581,4,6304285388,"That Darn Cat(1965) is one of the most enjoyable movies produced by Walt Disney Pictures. FBI agent Zeke Kelso(Dean Jones), teenager Patti Randall(Hayley Mills), and a Siamese cat search for a bank clerk being held hostage by two bank robbers(played by Neville Brand and Batman's Frank Gorshin). Doug E. Doug and Christina Ricci were in the unsuccessful 1997 remake of That Darn Cat. Every scene is fun except for the scenes where the bank robbers threaten their hostage. The late Dorothy Provine and Roddy McDowall are delightful in supporting roles. Keep in mind that That Darn Cat is not as fast paced as today's movies.
This film does a good job poking fun of the countless Beach Party and Surfing movies playing at drive-ins and movie theaters in 1965. Tom Lowell is quite good as Patti's surfer boyfriend Canoe. The cats, dogs, and birds in That Darn Cat act like animals. Some Disney movies are packed with anthropomorphic animals that behave like humans. It's fun watching D.C. steal a duck from Gregory Benson's house. Hayley Mills was 19 years old in 1965 and she must've gotten tired of playing wholesome teenage girls at the time. There's a side-splitting gag where the Siamese cat and a movie theater employee run past a film projector and their silhouettes appear over a movie! Director Robert Stevenson does a good job creating cartoonish gags in a live action film. This DVD was affordable, but it's only presented in pan-and-scan with no extras. Bobby Darin sang the film's theme song. That Darn Cat(1965) is good, clean fun and it deserves to be watched in the future.",1307145600,4,1586,4.856088560885609
830582,4,6304285388,"Back in the early heyday of Disney, they were pulling all the punches out on family entertainment, and this is a fine example of that legacy.  Animation, documentaries, adventure, comedy, live action, musicals, country western, wildlife adventure, and this was for the movie screens. ""That Darn Cat"" just goes to show they could have been a well known studio for comedy angle alone.
Not only is this a fine comedy, but it's also a very good story.
A neighborhood cat wanders back to it's owner wearing a woman's wrist watch around it's neck, leading to the presumption it is a secret call for help, with the latest news reel announcing a kidnapping of a female bank teller being held hostage.  This brings in the FBI, in the form of actor Dean Jones, a staple actor for Disney as well as Miss Haley Mills. This leads to a cat surveillance of the cat's normal routine wandering in hopes of it leading back to the residence of that wrist watch incident.
There are many many characters surrounding this investigation including landladies, nosy neighbors, confused friends, and reluctantly involved business people that harbor nearby.  All involved in this comedy that should have been a drama from the extreme situation of kidnapping, but becomes a comedy because of That Darn Cat playing the straight man.
The drive-in movie sequence is the official stamp for incredible ideas that almost makes Disney a pioneer in comedy also. The cat, himself, should have been given a unique award for animal acting, as it is much more than a cat doing it's duty, but also exudes mounds of expression, demure, and cat timing.  A real winner for the Disney studios!",1301875200,,1648,4.833333333333333

The story revolves mainly around teenage Patty (Haley Mills)and her determination to crack a kidnapping mystery right in her own neighborhood while involving the many interesting characters that live there.

830589,5,6304285388,"""That Darn Cat"" was made at the time of many of Walt Disney's best movies.  It fits right in with the fun ... the clean innocent fun ... movies he made during the 60s.

""That Darn Cat"" is the story of DC (as in Darn Cat) ... a mischievious siamese cat ... that happens across a crime while making his normal nocturnal rounds.  He then becomes the law enforcement people's only link to that crime, and they (the FBI) set up a surveillance and tracking operation (for the cat) in the hope that DC will lead them to the crooks' hide out.  DC then proceeds to wreak havoc on everyone ... FBI agents, neighbors, sisters, boyfriends, and crooks ... no matter how remotely they are involved with the case.  There are a lot of laughs and the ending is a happy one.

The cast of actors and actresses were very well chosen, and all do a good job.  Hayley Mills gets star billing, and she delivers the goods (as the star is expected to do).  Hayley is sort-of amazing in that she (in this movie anyway) is so casual and effective in her acting (with a camera operating a mere five feet from her nose).  Here, she is the smart blonde and the dumb blonde at the same time.  And she is very funny in ""That Darn Cat"" ... adorable and funny.

Hayley has help in making this movie work.  Dean Jones is very good as the main FBI agent, Dorothy Provine is fun as Hayley's big sister, Tom Lowell is excellent as Hayley's clueless boyfriend (and he is buried deep in the credits ... as usual), Frank Gorshin, as one of the thugs, is entertaining just about every moment he is on screen, Roddy McDowall is good when his character is angry, and Iris Adrian is excellent as the landlady.  Bobby Darin sings the theme song, and it is, like, perfect man.

The writing for ""That Darn Cat"" is pretty good ... both for the story and the dialogue ... and here are a few of the best lines:

""He's called DC.  That means Darn Cat.  Daddy named him, and he thought of something much worse, but mother refused to use that name."" (Patti (Hayley Mills))

""Your sins have caught up with you.  This is your FBI."" (Patti talking to DC)

""Oh Gregory ... I look YUCK in yellow."" (Ingrid (Dorothy Provine))

""We were in love ... l'amour tous jour ... you understand that."" (Patti to the crooks)

""Mrs. Zeke Kelso.  It sounds like something that got caught in the clothes dryer."" (Ingrid)

""And you didn't think of your stomach, not once?"" (Patti)

""You may wind up with one of ... maybe the son of ... that darn cat."" (Bobby Darin in the theme song (written by the Sherman brothers))

But ""That Darn Cat"" is a simple fun movie and a simply fun movie.  It is entertaining for children and adults alike.",1252713600,,2659,4.340770791075051
830695,5,6304285388,"This movie was ok...I was surprised that Disney (in those days) would have some of the stuff in this movie that they did.  Anyway, Haley Mills is a really pretty girl and she was a fantastic actor, especially in Pollyanna.",1251936000,,222,4.55
830696,5,6304285388,"I loved this movie as a child. It has been years, okay decades since I have seen it.

830699,4,6304285388,"Forty years plus later, THAT DARN CAT! still holds up very well as a live action Disney movie. I saw it again recently, after not having seen it for many years, and it's just as entertaining and silly, although for the most part not so dumbed-down silly that it becomes aggravating. Based on the book UNDERCOVER CAT by the Gordons (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/That-Darn-Cat-AKA-Undercover-Cat/dp/B000ZG09IM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">That Darn Cat  AKA  Undercover Cat</a>) and with the theme song sung by Bobby Darin, several things work to make this a fun flick. First and prominently, there's Hayley Mills, who spent a huge chunk of her teenhood making Disney movies (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pollyanna-Vault-Disney-Collection/dp/B00005RRGB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pollyanna (Vault Disney Collection)</a>, the classic PARENT TRAP (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Parent-Trap-1961-and-The-Parent-Trap-II-1986-2-Movie-Collection-2-Disc-Set/dp/B0009X75QU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Parent Trap (1961) and The Parent Trap II (1986): 2-Movie Collection (2-Disc Set)</a>),&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/In-Search-of-the-Castaways/dp/B00005JLJC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">In Search of the Castaways</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Summer-Magic/dp/B00005JMVV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Summer Magic</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Moon-Spinners/dp/B00007GZZW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Moon-Spinners</a>). THAT DARN CAT! marks the end of 19-year-old Hayley Mills's Disney run, but she exits on a high note. To make up for her departure, lanky everyman Dean Jones makes his Disney debut and would go on to be the featured star in ensuing Disney pictures. In this movie Hayley is as warm and plucky as ever, and Dean brings his likeability and his talent for physical comedy. Both are terrific, someone in charge being wise enough to ensure enough screentime for these two to do their thing.

But it's also about the cat. At exactly 9pm the always ravenous blue-eyed Siamese cat D.C. (for Darn Cat!) goes on the prowl and makes his rounds, scavenging for food, getting into messes, getting the neighbors all ornery. But when D.C. comes home one evening wearing an expandable wristwatch with part of the word ""Help"" scratched on it, her teenaged owner Patti Randall (Mills) makes an improbable leap of logic: that the watch is somehow linked to the daring bank robberies and kidnapping so featured in all the newspapers. I guess back in the '60s one can just stroll into the FBI offices and walk out with an FBI guy, because this is exactly what Patti does. Except that the agent assigned, Zeke Kelso (Jones), happens to be highly allergic to cats.

There's a bit of anthropomorphism thrown in, with D.C. seemingly able to understand most of the conversations going on around him. And certainly D.C. is a clever cat, and there's almost a cartoon feel in how he outsmarts the local backyard mutt. We also get absurd shenanigans with Agent Kelso attempting to take the cat's pawprints and the FBI guys tasked with surveillance detail on D.C. But thankfully the cat doesn't monopolize the movie. And, except for Kelso's attempts to fingerprint D.C. (a scene which feels really contrived), the frankly farfetched plot developments generate the humor. The funniest sequence takes place in a drive-in theater as manager Mel Cooley chases down Kelso and the cat and has ungodly amounts of icky concession stand foods dumped on him. There's also a very vague stab at romance but that gives way in favor of getting the plot moving.

Incidental characters also provide comedy support and generally liven up the place, particularly Elsa Manchester and William Demarest as, respectively, the snoopy neighbor and her hearing-impaired husband. And, yes, the snoop gets her just desserts. Roddy McDowall plays a stuffed shirt who courts Patti's older sister; Ed Wynn shows up in one scene as a nervous jeweler; and Frank Gorshin (later, the Riddler in the Batman show) is interesting as a fidgety bank robber. A dichotomy regarding Gorshin's character is that while he's the one pushing to kill off the hostage bank teller, he's a big softie for cats. By the way, another element which elevates the film is that the bad guys aren't portrayed as bumbling types but rather as fairly smart ne-er-do-wells. They probably would've gotten away with their crimes... if not for That. Darn. Cat! And who plans for cats?

So I cut my teeth on Disney flicks and grew up on Hayley Mills and Dean Jones, Fred MacMurray and Kurt Russell. Hayley Mills was excellent in all of her Disney pictures, so I'm not too surprised that, although not as timeless as THE PARENT TRAP, THAT DARN CAT! decades later has managed to retain its magic and its watchability. Even the more sophisticated, more savvy kids of today will giggle themeselves silly at THAT DARN CAT! The only down side to this, really, is that we're still waiting for a dvd release with the original theatrical wide screen format.

The villains are very effective.  You can tell from the beginning of the movie we are not dealing with typical comedy villains.  One of them, played by Frank Gorshin (a year before he showed up as the Riddler in the Batman TV series).  It creates the tension of a woman whose life is in danger, which is the set up for the story.

One of my all-time favorite scenes is where D. C. (for ""Darn Cat"") is playing with a butterfly in front of a drive thru movie camera.  I find it funny . . . but then, I can picture a cat doing that.

830917,5,6304285388,"Personally, I think calling this movie ""That Damn Cat"" would've given the movie more edge and appealed to the kids of today, but we'll have to go with the title Disney gave this thing. The siamese cat playing that darn cat puts on a performance that would rival what Keanu Reeves or Chris Klein do on the big screen today. The cat is crosseyed so it can't see things on it's left. Anyway, craziness ensues and the cat saves China or something.

I've got a cat named Hindenburg at home and the thing is freakin huge. She weighs 18 lbs and really doesn't do anything but sleep, eat and poop. It's really smelly poop too. I will taunt the cat at times. Sometimes when she is sleeping I dress up like a giant mouse or soft taco and run out of the kitchen screaming like a banshee. My cat usually leaps 5 feet in the air and then hisses at me. I'll just keep following her around making squeaking noises like a mouse or a sizzling noise if I'm the soft taco. The soft taco itself doesn't really make noise so I sub in the fajita sizzlin sound. It's mexican food, it's the same 6 ingredients cooked in different ways. If I want to take creative license to make a fajita noise instead of making up a noise for a soft taco, that's my right. As mentioned in earlier reviews, I like to play board games with my cat and almost always win. Hindy did beat me at Monopoly last week though because she got both boardwalk and park place. After the game I took her outside for a game of basketball in the driveway. I shut her out. A lot of that is due to the fact she doesn't have opposable thumbs and can't shoot a basketball, but even if she did she couldn't contain my post game.

Cats are pretty cool and don't smell as bad as other pets like Dogs or Wombats. If you want a fun family movie to watch before bedtime, this film at #7 all time would be a good call. Let's face it, if I recommend something you should probably just do it.

They could have very easily put out a seperate widescreen DVD as well as a pan & scan DVD or they could have had one DVD with widescreen on the A side of the disc and pan & scan on the B side.,1122681600,8,566,3.8461538461538463

831071,4,6304285388,"It may be possible that children in 1965 had longer attention spans.  THAT DARN CAT was a huge Disney hit, and with its almost two hours in length and it's by today's standards slow pacing, it's a wonder kids could sit through the whole movie without getting antsy.  But, hey, I did back then and now as an adult, I still find the movie a charming family film.  Disney ingenue Hayley Mills had one of her first ""mature"" roles in this film and she is delightful as always.  Disney mainstay Dean Jones played the allergy-ridden FBI agent to the tee, and lovely Dorothy Provine was sharp as Hayley's older sister.  Add a supporting cast of such stalwarts as Ed Wynn, Elsa Lanchester, William Demarest, Tom Lowell, and Roddy McDowall, and you have a highly entertaining fluffy entertainment.  It was good seeing Dark Shadows Julia Hoffman (the late Grayson Hall) in the role of the kidnapped banker, and baddies Frank Gorshin and Neville Brand as the somewhat inept kidnappers.  And of course, DC that darn cat, was perfect---no superhero abilities or talking cat, just a persnickety and sharp feline hero!",1118793600,3,1102,4.798941798941799

It is a 2-disc set presented in 1:75.  I don't understand why Disney so carefully presents one classic & treats another with complete disdain.  The ""Absent-Minded Professor"" was put out on DVD in full-screen but within six months Disney released the wide-screen version too.  I can only hope that they will do that with ""That Darn Cat"", ""In Search of the Castaways"", & ""The Moon-Spinners"".

831074,4,6304285388,"Haley Mills shines as always in That Darn Cat. I disagree with some of the other reviewers who said she and her sister came across as being very flaky. Haley stars as Patti, a girl on the brink of womanhood who lives with her older sister and parents.  She is known for having an overactive imagination, but that proves to be a good thing when she solves a bank robber mystery with the help of her Siamese Cat ""D.C.""  The cat definitely is the most humorous character in this film.  He constantly outwits humans, especially the jerks.  The second funniest character in my opinion is Patti's semi boyfriend Canoe who is always hanging around her house generally being a nuesence. My favorite scene is when he is spying on Patti and gets caught on a garage door and then the people who own it open the garage, and he flys up into it and injures his neck.  This movie is obviously dated and a bit dorky, but it is great slapstick comedy and safe for the whole family.  I recommend watching this late at night when you are a bit tired and slap happy.  I am surprised this movie isn't more popular and on DVD.  It is almost as good as her previous films Pollyanna and the Parent Trap. Those two movies I give 5 stars. I wouldn't recommend anyone watching the 1997 version of That Darn cat.  It was so bad I stopped watching it about a third of the way through it.  The acting and writing were both terrible.",1115942400,,1402,4.337164750957855

831164,4,6304285388,"In the early 1960s Hayley Mills starred in six Disney movies, ""Pollyanna"" in 1960, ""The Parent Trap"" in 1961, ""In Search of the Castaways"" in 1962, ""Summer Magic"" in 1963, ""The Moon-Spinners"" in 1964, and this movie in 1965.  In 1965 Hayley Mills was about 19 years old and her popularity was beginning to wane.  Disney made a vane attempt in this movie to have Hayley appear hip, but instead she comes across as a bit ditzy and occasionally annoying.  However, the other actors in this movie make this movie enjoyable and one to have for your collection.

Hayley Mills owns a cat by the name of DC, which is short for, you guessed it, Darn Cat.  DC wanders about the neighborhood looking for handouts and whatever else pleases his feline heart.  Recently the neighborhood had a bank robbery, and the bank robbers have disappeared, taking a teller hostage with them.

Early in the movie we see DC on his travels through the neighborhood, where he encounters, yep, you guessed again, the bank robbers and their hostage, Mrs. Margaret Miller (Grayson Hall).  Mrs. Miller attempts to write ""help"" on the back of her watch, managing only a portion of the word, and then putting the watch around DC's neck.

After DC returns home Patti Randal (Hayley Mills) sees the watch, and hypothesizes that Mrs. Miller attempted to write ""help"" and was interrupted, but had the presence of mind to put the watch around DC's neck.  She involves a host of FBI agents, lead by Agent Zeke Kelso, who is played by the Disney regular Dean Jones.  Patti's efforts to keep the FBI on the case are continually by her ditzy behavior, which also threatens to annoy some viewers.

Involved in the shenanigans are Dorothy Provine as Patti's slightly older sister Ingrid, Roddy McDowell as Ingrid's car pool and love interest (in his mind) Gregory Benson, Elsa Lanchester as busy-body neighbor Kipp MacDougall and William Demerast as her long-suffering husband Wilbur, Ed Wynn as Mr. Hofstedder the jeweler, Tom Lowell as goofball moocher Canoe Henderson, and Neville Brand and Frank Gorshin as bank robbers Dan and Iggy.

The funniest parts of the movie revolve around the cat.  DC is well-trained and in most cases is the most intelligent being in the movie.  It is little wonder that the movie was named after the cat.  Most of the characters that interact with the cat end up getting a lot of chuckles and laughs.  The bank robbers are menacing, as anyone who is familiar with Neville Brand might imagine, but Iggy seems a bit clueless.  The FBI ends up being made to look silly in this movie as well, particularly as they attempt to tail the cat, no pun intended.

The surprising part of this movie is that the bank robbers are planning to kill Mrs. Miller.  Murder is rarely blatantly plotted in any Disney movie, and though this movie is a comedy and a bit goofball, I recommend this movie for children at least in elementary school because Neville Brand and Frank Gorshin may be a bit too scary for some children.  Everything generally turns out okay in the end, as you might expect in a Disney movie, but Mrs. Miller's fears are real.

Hayley Mills has always been a favorite from the time I was a child, when I thought she was pretty and cool.  However, of her six early Disney movies this one exploits her talents the least.  In general her characters are intelligent and outgoing, and their observations often reflect our own or a position that we can often accept.  In this movie Patti Randall is too goofy for me to identify with her.  Even her sister Ingrid seems a bit too daffy.  I think Disney should have made both characters more intelligent.  I should note that the later remake did make the lead character more intelligent, but that movie is not as clever and as funny as this movie is.  Fortunately, the supporting characters are funny, and they make this movie well worth watching.

As with other Disney DVD releases, this movie is in full screen format, for reasons I am unable to understand.  Admittedly the movie probably loses little by being in full screen, but when you have a wide screen television you prefer to make the most of the screen width.

""That Darn Cat"" is somewhat dated, but I still enjoy watching it.  You need this movie to make your Hayley Mills Disney movie collection complete.  Also, Dean Jones fans will enjoy his character in this movie.  Lastly, DC makes this movie.  Indeed, DC may be the best actor in the movie.",1112140800,4,4437,4.672680412371134
831165,5,6304285388,"I first saw this on the Disney Channel many years ago and recorded it. I must've watched it 100 times growing up!

All I can say is, if they do make a widescreen version, use WIDESCREEN ANAMORPHIC mode, since standard widescreen is much lower resolution.

And it would be great if they added some dubs of other languages, or at least release it in Europe like the Herbie series. I rarely buy Region 1 DVDs when buying older movies since they only have the English and possibly a French track (Euorpeans use their multi language DVDs to learn English. I feel ripped off! I'm trying to learn German and Italian!)

August 21, 2015 (Time really flies, doesn't it?) UPDATE: The movie is available on DVD and has been for a while now.

NOW, I want to request that Disney completely Restore (and enhance?) and Remaster this beloved classic and release it on BLU-RAY.

This is the 50th Anniversary year of the movie and a 50th Anniversary Edition would have been special. (And WHY isn't this movie on Amazon Instant Video?)
.

 I don't know what Disney is waiting for, but if enough of us request the Blu-Ray, it will be made available alot quicker.

  The movie is about a Beautiful Siamese Cat, named D.C. (Darn Cat).
  D.C. and his owner, the cute (Hubba-Hubba) Disney legend Hayley Mills find themselves up to their necks in crime, and chaos.
  A woman has been kidnapped, and only D.C. and Hayley can help he police find her!
 Dean Jones, another Disney legend, plays the special agent in charge of the kidnapped woman's case, and he is wonderful.
  ""That Darn Cat"" is the epitome of a Disney Clasic film: A cute, charasmatic Animal as the star, plus some familiar faces in the supporting roles, mixed with the Disney comedy, action and overall fun that we have grown to love.
  The late great Roddy McDowall, of ""Planet of the Apes"" fame, plays a great part in this movie as well.

 They made a remake of ""That Darn Cat' in 1997, and while it was good, it is not nearly as good as the original. Not even CLOSE. The original blows the 97' version away!

 This original 1965 version of 'That Darn Cat"" is the one with the Disney Magic that we all have grown used to.

 This movie is full of comedy, action, suspense, intrigue, and most important, pure Disney fun.

  You will definitely enjoy this movie, if you haven't seen it yet. If you have seen it on video/DVD, then you know what I mean.

 Hopefully, soon, Disney will release this movie on Blu-Ray, and when they do, trust me when I say that it will be a favorite of yours and your family for years and years to come.
  So, come on Disney.....we are waiting. Please release ""That Darn Cat"" on Blu-Ray soon, so that a whole new generation can experience its wonder.",1083456000,72,2214,4.476190476190476

831263,4,6304285388,"Families and cat-lovers will delight in this comedy-mystery (based upon a novel by The Gordons) about DC Randall, Siamese sleuth, who comes home one night from his regular wanderings with a woman's wristwatch around his neck.  Patti (Mills), DC's person, takes the wild but accurate guess that the watch belongs to a neighborhood bank teller kidnapped in a robbery only that morning, contacts the FBI, and involves Agent Zeke Kelso (Jones), who's unfortunately allergic to cats, in the case.  Three nights of confusion and mayhem follow as the FBI tries to follow their ""informant"" in the hopes that he'll return to the place he acquired the watch.
DC himself, of course, is the star of the picture--a handsome and talented cat, splendidly trained, who strews chaos in his wake wherever he goes (the sequence in the drive-in on the second night is the stuff classic comedy is made of).  Mills, with her distinct British accent, is somewhat less than believable as a California surfer girl, but Jones is, as always, a delightful straight man to the wild improbabilities going on around him.  The cast also features Dorothy Provine as Patti's older sister Ingrid; Roddy McDowell as Gregory Benson, who's trying to eel his way into her affections; Tom Lowell as Patti's surfer boyfriend, Canoe; Neville Brand as the tough and sinister bank robber Dan and Frank Gorshin as the mildly maniacal Iggy; and Elsa Lanchester and William Demarest as the Randalls' nosy neighbor and her long-suffering husband.  Though lacking in the high-tech gadgetry of more modern films of its kind, the movie also manages a fair degree of suspense (Will DC return to the robbers' hideout in time to save the hostage?  Will Benson or Canoe queer the FBI's deal?).  While I haven't seen the remake, I suspect the original is superior; even its more physical moments of comedy have a certain grace about them.

831265,5,6304285388,"Young teenager Patti Randall (Hayley Mills) discovers that the Randall cat, D.C. which stands for Darn Cat, comes home one night wearing a wrist-watch around his neck. Scratched behind the watch are the letters 'H', 'E', and part of an 'L'. Patti's imagination runs away with her and she figures out that the letters were supposed to spell out the word ""HELP""! Patti thinks that the watch belongs to a kidnapped teller, Margaret Miller (Grayson Hall). And she is correct! Ms. Miller had been kidnapped by two bank robbers Dan (Neville Brand) and Sammy (Frank Gorshin) and fearing for her life, had put the wristwatch on D.C.  Luckily, Patti, ignoring her sister Ingrid's (Dorothy Provine) commands on not to call the police, instead calls the FBI and gets help from Agent Zeke Kelso (Dean Jones). From there starts a zany adventure in which Zeke Kelso has to follow D.C. to the crooks while fighting off nosy neighbors, jealous boyfriends, and D.C.'s disappearing maneuvers.
Based on the book ""Undercover Cat"" written by the Gordons, ""That Darn Cat"" is a Disney gem! For those who have read the book must be warned though that this movie is very different from the book, yet still hilarious and exciting! One of the best things about this movie though is that superb cast of stars! Everyone is perfect for their parts, from Hayley Mills the full-of-life Randall girl, Ingrid the serious sister, Dean Jones the allergic FBI agent, Roddy McDowall the short-tempered neighbor, Elsa Lanchester the nosy neighbor, her husband played by William Demarest, Tom Lowell as Canoe the jealous boyfriend, Ed Wynn the very nervous watch jeweler, and Richard Eastham as the FBI Supervisor. And of course we can't forget D.C. who is actually a very good actor! The title song is fun to listen to, very jazzy and sung by Bobby Darin.
