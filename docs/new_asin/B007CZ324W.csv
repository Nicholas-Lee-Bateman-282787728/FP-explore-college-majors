5078854,4,B007CZ324W,"I had watched THE GREY the night before, which took place in a brutal Alaskan wilderness.  BEYOND is likewise set in Alaska, this time in a snowy, bleak Anchorage.  The storyline focuses on a seasoned, soon to retire detective (Jon Voight) investigating the kidnapping of his boss' 7 yr old niece.  Things take a bizarre turn when a young tv psychic (Julian Morris) offers his assistance, an offer Voight refuses but the victim's mother (Teri Polo) embraces.
Voight and Morris do well, their love/hate relationship played out convincingly.  Polo seems unimpassioned in a low-key performance, while Dermot Mulroney (also in THE GREY) seems miscast as Voight's chief.
Despite its predictability and derivative plotline, BEYOND is an interesting and gripping film, boosted by Voight's tenacity and commitment.",1338076800,12,806,5.373015873015873
5078855,3,B007CZ324W,"Good movie to watch when nothing else takes to your liking is available. I rated B because there are a few actors in the film that really need more work in the craft. Story is good, ending not a surprise; yet I do not regret renting the film.",1337817600,,242,4.0625
5078856,4,B007CZ324W,"BEYOND is an interesting, rather entertaining, hybrid; part police procedural mystery and part supernatural thriller.  If it has a problem, it's that the filmmakers are not quite sure which one they want it to be.

Filmed in Anchorage, Alaska, the film stars Jon Voight as a ""take no prisoners"" veteran detective, who specializes in cases involving missing children.  When the seven-year-old niece of his boss (Dermot Mulroney) is kidnapped, Voight starts working the case, but soon finds himself bothered when the girl's mother (Teri Polo) enlists the help of a radio psychic (Julian Morris), who claims that a ""ghost"" is putting him into contact with the lost child.

The actors are good, and Greg Gieras' script has a couple of intriguing twists that raise this film a step above other movies of the genre.  Director Josef Rusnak keeps the action moving along at a nice pace, taking full advantage of the breathtaking Alaskan scenery.  I just wish that, in post-production, he and the editor hadn't added so many ""BOOMS"" to the sound track.

""BOOMS"" are effective in a horror movie when a filmmaker want s to underscore a scary moment, to get viewers to ""jump in their seats"".  But, this sound effect is so overused in BEYOND, which is not really a horror movie, that it becomes annoying.

On DVD from Anchor Bay Entertainment.

After a child goes missing detective John Koski (Voight) is on the case and tries to find the missing niece of the Chief of Police (Mulroney). When the mother and babysitter tell Koski about a psychic who may be able to help Koski is reluctant to accept him. I really wasn't sure what to expect from this at all. The best way to describe this is the feel of a made for TV movie with better acting and an OK idea. While this is really nothing super original or that exciting it is still worth a watch and could have been worse. The biggest problem is that the person I suspected about a half hour in turned out to be the right one. I'm not sure if it's because I watch to many movies and have picked up on certain clues or if the movie is just that predictable. Either way this is still worth a watch but nothing to rush and see. Overall, not bad but would work better as a TV show instead of a movie. I give it a B-.",1333497600,6,988,3.994949494949495

Brett Baker, who plays Jon's homicide detective partner, is the BEST!! Believable in his role, very good acting, nice to look at and we should see more of him!! Following Jon and Brett Baker were Teri Polo, Julian Morris, Dermot Mulroney and others who portrayed their characters well.

5078868,4,B007CZ324W,"By Jim Clark, publisher, Lee County Courier, Tupelo, MS

Beyond is mysterious, entertaining, and has some creepy moments. I'm just not sure if the filmmakers put a lot of thought into the direction the movie was going to take or winged it. The box art and title hints at horror, but the only really scarey moments are loud noises.
Having said that, Beyond is worth a watch. There is some excellent acting by Jon Voight and Dermot Mulroney.
A seven year old girl, Amy, is kidnapped from her bedroom in Anchorage, Alaska.  The little girl is the niece of the head of the police department (Dermot Mulroney) which gives the case an added importance.
John Koski (Jon Voight) a seasoned detective is given the case. John  is continually fighting demons from an unsolved kidnapping which happended years earlier. Running out of solid leads, and dogged by Amy's mother and the babysitter, John reluctantly turns to radio psychic (Julian Morris of Pretty Little Liars) who claims to have visions of the missing girl.
The producer of Beyond worked on Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance and the director did The Thirteenth Floor.
It was filmed in Anchorage and the subarctic climate added to the mystrey, reminding me of another thriller Insomnia, with Al Pacino and Robin Williams.
It's the talent of Academy Award Winner (Coming Home) Jon Voight that really holds the story together.",1341273600,,1373,4.9094827586206895
5078869,3,B007CZ324W,"It's hard to pull off a good supernatural thriller these days. Every possible angle has already been exploited hundreds of times. All you can hope for as a writer or director of this type of film is that your story is compelling and endearing enough to keep the audience's attention for 90 minutes to two hours. Filmmakers have to hope that the one or two ""twist"" or ""surprise"" endings they decide to utilize out of the five dozen already used will fit convincingly with the rest of the tale.

All that being said, ""Beyond"" has an uphill battle to fight from the very beginning. Add to the struggle the extremely unoriginal title of the film and you have something most consumers and renters will walk by without even giving a second glance. Although it isn't anything new, the movie does hold its own and delivers a little intrigue and entertainment.

The Blu-ray release of ""Beyond"" isn't going to make anyone want to rush out and scoop it up in the stores right away. It's one of those movies you either rent from Redbox or buy while digging through the $5 DVD box at Walmart on a Saturday afternoon. If you're a fan of supernatural / psychological thrillers, this does hold up better than your typical Lifetime made-for-TV movie.",1340755200,7,1233,4.651376146788991

8514723,3,B007CZ324W,"I was enticed to watch this film based on the two top notch actors (Jon Voight and Dermot Mulroney), but unfortunately the plot didn't really come together to allow them to show off their acting chops. Filmed in Anchorage, Alaska, the film stars Jon Voight as a veteran police detective, nearing retirement, but not ready to be out of the game. He specializes in cases involving missing children, though we never really know why until the end of the film. When the 7 year old niece of his boss (played by Dermot Mulroney) is kidnapped, Voight starts methodically working the case, but soon finds his case complicated by a locally famous radio psychic who claims that a ""spirit"" is putting him into contact with the lost child. The dramatic scenes where the psychic has flashes into another world are confusing and unexplained. Though highly skeptical at first Voight eventually starts to recognize that the psychic has some inexplicable ability to flash back and foretell events.

The climactic scene at the end where Voight confronts the perpetrator ties up the plot with a neat bow; however there simply wasn't enough lead up to the climax to make it believable. The stark, beautiful wintry landscape of Anchorage, Alaska is one of the best features of the film, particularly the scenes of Voight flying over the mountains in his small plane, and certainly makes it different than other kidnapping / police procedural films.",1447977600,,1426,4.941666666666666
