6269255,5,B00IKM5MQC,"Thus DVD was as good or better than his last one. He made a few changes for the better. I am 72 years old and have seen many ventriloquists over my life, but he is definitely the best I have ever seen.",1403395200,,201,3.8095238095238093

6269257,5,B00IKM5MQC,This guy is so talented. We followered him from his Talent win thru his 2 tapes. Never saw him in Vegas though. Great!,1403222400,,118,4.173913043478261
6269258,5,B00IKM5MQC,I saw Terry Fator In Las Vegas one of the best show ever extremely talented can sing any ones voice,1403136000,,99,4.0
6269259,5,B00IKM5MQC,"I have Terry Fator's first DVD and have nearly worn it out.  I expect this one to have the same fate.  Terry is the best ventriloquist around and sounds more like the artists that he mimics that the artists themselves.  I followed him when he won ""America's Got Talent"" and predicted he would make it big.  My daughter and her husband caught his show in Las Vegas and it was the highlight of their trip.",1403049600,8,403,4.333333333333333
6269260,4,B00IKM5MQC,"I have followed Terry Fator since his days on AGT & think he deserves every bit of the Fame he is finally enjoying. I once again enjoyed the show on this CD but must say that his performance on the ""LIVE FROM LAS VEGAS"" CD is very hard to top.",1402272000,3,243,3.88
6269261,5,B00IKM5MQC,I watched this and laughed almost to tears.  I have his other DVD and I think that this one is easily an equal to his first.  Now I gotta get to Vegas to see him live..,1400803200,5,168,3.638888888888889
6269262,5,B00IKM5MQC,Terry Fartor is awesome if it's as good as the first one we will be laughing so hard and enjoying ourselves he is wonderful The item arrive in great shape and we were please Thank You,1400803200,4,183,4.111111111111111
6269263,5,B00IKM5MQC,"Terry Fator is very good at what he does! I watched his new dvd and loved it. I am speechless with his voice talents. I'd say he is the best Ventriloquist/Entertainer ever! Sorry Jeff Dunham.....His show was so much fun to watch. Not a dull moment! Great songs, and funny likeable puppets. I like the fact that Terry gives back to others too. He's a great all around person! Keep up the good work Terry! Hope to see many more shows! Highly recommend this dvd! You will enjoy every minute, great extras too.",1397692800,19,506,4.451612903225806

6269343,5,B00IKM5MQC,"Terry Fator is a ""real entertainer.""  He is an excellent ventriloquist and his showmanship is superb.",1487289600,,101,5.3125
6269344,5,B00IKM5MQC,"Good fun.  There are alot of little changes to the show itself from the other Terry Fator DVD Live From Vegas.  This show is also tighter than the Live From Vegas show but that could be considered a good or bad thing.  There is a fun in being loose as the Live From Vegas show was.  On the flipside, this show has less mistakes.  Yet, It has that ""Just another show"" vibe instead of being truly special.  Like today, they decided to just record this particular show and put it on DVD, ho-hum.  The first one Live From Vegas felt important.  Also, there are some puppet changes.

There aren't many giant changes and some material is recycled.  The extra DVD Special Features are new and solid.  If your a Terry Fator nut, you'll appreciate this DVD as a whole.  It'll be different enough to be worth owning.  It's a high quality production and looks/sounds great.  It's also great if you never owned the Vegas disc.  But if you did and your not a Terry Fator nut.  Consider it first.  My family watching it was split 50/50.  Some loving it wholeheartedly and others saying ""the other one was better"".  I think the big problem is simply, if you've seen it once.  It's not as special seeing it again.  Unless your a super fan, that makes all the difference.",1487116800,,1254,4.436123348017621

6269393,5,B00IKM5MQC,"If you like Jeff Dunham, you should give this guy a try. He does an excellent job at reg talking as well as singing. It will blow your mind how he can sing in so many diff voices. We love Jeff Dunham, don't get me wrong, but this is a change of pace so to speak from a reg comedy routine. Yes, there is adult some adult humor, especially with the Brooks/Dunn cowboy type puppet. Even if you wind up not liking him, you'll still be amazed at how well he performs.",1462233600,,462,4.032608695652174

6269438,5,B00IKM5MQC,"Terry Fator has some new puppets and routines in Las Vegas and has improved some of his old puppets and material as well. You get a large variety of music and jokes here and their are plenty of bonuses in the special feature including a short cartoon. If you saw the first one ""Live in Las Vegas"" you need to get this one next.",1460246400,,327,4.125
6269439,3,B00IKM5MQC,"The best part of the video was the song about the little boy and the horses, which he said was a true story.  Also, the song on behalf of the military that he wrote.  Other than that, we were highly disappointed that his known puppet characters have changed in appearance.  Edgar Bergan, Paul Winchell and Sherri Lewis never changed their puppets.  If you are going to change puppets, at least change the name.  It was a disappointing video.",1459814400,,441,4.602564102564102

6269518,5,B00IKM5MQC,"I ordered this for my son to give to his great aunt for her birthday.  They watched it and were in tears!  Terry is the best ventriloquist around and has been amazing from the beginning when he started on America's Got Talent!  My son really got a kick out of how good he was able to do the puppets, since you know he is a Jeff Dunham fan, and really enjoyed Terry Fator's Live In Concert DVD.  His great aunt thought it was best birthday present ever since Terry Fator IS her favorite!!",1447200000,,487,4.204301075268817
6269519,4,B00IKM5MQC,"If you never saw ""from Las Vegas"" then this portion of the review is for you.  Terry Fator is a ventriloquist who also sings for his puppets.  Just think ""Jeff Dunham with songs"" and you'll get the basic idea.  Terry is a great entertainer and I enjoy watching his DVDs.  I do believe this is his second DVD.  He sings and makes jokes with his puppets.

If you did see ""from Las Vegas"" then this portion of the review is for you.  There is good and there is bad.  The good part is, this is a new show, a new DVD.  The bad part is, there are some repeats from the first DVD.  I never saw Terry live, only on the DVDs and I must say, if he is still doing some of the same acts 3 years later.....what is up with him?  Get some new material, Terry!  Example (SPOILER ALERT!) is the Elvis puppet.  Same material as in the first DVD.  Just bumped into him (Elvis impersonator) downstairs in the lobby.  Hello!  You bumped into him on your first DVD back in 2009.  This one is from 2012 and you just bumped into him again?  Come on!  Anyway, it is a good DVD to own/watch.  Just know that there is a few repeats from the first DVD in there, but there is also more new material too.",1447200000,,1174,4.065789473684211

6269735,3,B00IKM5MQC,"There is a reason that I cannot give this concert 5 stars. I truly enjoy Terry Fator, but if you already own his first Live in Concert like I do then you will not need to buy this one. Yes, you guessed it the show is almost the exact same. Now if you don't already own a Terry Fator concert then you are in for a musical treat, mixed with comedy entertainment. Terry is very talented and he brings music to ventriloquism like Jeff Dunham brings comedy to ventriloquism. Terry brings 8 puppets to life and he will sing a few songs without them. This is a great live concert and Terry has been headlining his own Las Vegas show for four straight years. Terry is a singing impersonator that will truly keep the family entertained.",1420329600,3,727,4.352941176470588

6269945,5,B00IKM5MQC,"Had just seen Terry Fator in person for the first time @ The Fox in Riverside & he was AWESOME! His live show was more autobiographical, less puppets but no less amazing. This disc had more of his supreme talent without his co-stars than his earlier DVD but not as much as his live show. There are some tearjerker moments when he sings two songs he wrote himself. Some of his co-stars have had a little work done, Julius in particular.  A couple of bits are works in progress & it's strange for him to have imperfect moments but it proves he's human after all. Not 100% child friendly but it is a Vegas show, after all.",1408492800,,619,4.2905982905982905

6269950,3,B00IKM5MQC,"I was very ""unimpressed"" with this new video.  It's basically an updated version of his first DVD and he even uses some of the same jokes and taglines.  It's more singing with the puppets and he introduces a few new ones, but they are less than ""exciting"".  I feel like I wasted my money on this video - the first one was 10 times funnier.  He still pulls someone out of the audience and dresses them up like a woman (1st video it was Cher, this video it's Dolly Parton).  The lines are same and it's nothing new. Overall, I say save your money and wait until he really has something new and refreshing to offer his audience.  He talks about how he didn't have any control over the first video and everyone was trying to ""run"" his career, but he took back control this time, and the result is a video that is worse than his first.  Perhaps he's a little too narcissistic to realize this first video with other producers who know what people want put out a much better video than this one will ever be! Don't get me wrong, I think he is extremely talented, I just thought I'd be getting a video with new ""characters"" and new material.  That wasn't the case.  I wish I hadn't wasted the money on this ""repeat"".",1407110400,,1208,4.286343612334802
6269951,3,B00IKM5MQC,I was disappointed.  I have the fit DVD and love it.. this one is a little 'slower'.  I recommend the first one... or see Terry in person... an amazing show!,1407024000,,157,4.2

6269953,2,B00IKM5MQC,"It seems stale. The new characters didn't interest me. As much as I love Terry Fator, this seemed like he was bored with everything. He is a tremendous talent, but he fell short of my expectations with this DVD. I am still a fan though.",1406332800,,236,4.266666666666667
