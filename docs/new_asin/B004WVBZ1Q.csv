IT CAPTURES YOUR HEART WITH THE MUSIC. IT HAS GREAT LINES IN EVERY SONG THAT WILL MAKE YOU SMILE OR GIVE A LOT OF THOUGHT TOO.  IT HAS AN ENJOYABLE STORY THAT ISN'T TYPICALLY PREDICTABLE. IT'S  FOR ALL AGES.I HAVE TAKEN ONE OR TWO OF THE SONGS AND USED THEM OVER THE YEARS IN OTHER SMALL PROGRAMS BECAUSE NOTHING ESE COULD WOULD BE AS EFFECTIVE AS WHAT I FOUND IN ARCH, SUCH AS, ""YOU CAN'T IMAGINE HOW HE LOVES THEM"". YOU CAN'T FIND ANYTHING BETTER THAN THIS SCRIPT OR MUSIC. THE WORDS TO THE SONGS ARE THE BEST. NO ONE CAN GO AWAY FROM THIS WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT CHRISTMAS IS ALL ABOUT AND KNOWING GOD LOVES THEM AND WHY HE CAME. EXCELLENT...EXCELLENT ...EXCELLENT!!!",1350086400,,837,4.428571428571429
