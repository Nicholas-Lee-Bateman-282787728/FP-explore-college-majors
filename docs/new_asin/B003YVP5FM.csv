4231585,5,B003YVP5FM,I originally saw this movie on TV and thought it was great! It's very entertaining and has a good heartwarming message. I'd definitely recommend this movie!,1278806400,,156,5.038461538461538
4231586,5,B003YVP5FM,"There is something for everyone in this movie. It shows love, compassion, trust and other feelings and how to display and appreciate them.",1277078400,,138,5.043478260869565
4231587,5,B003YVP5FM,This is a very good Hallmark movie I first saw recently on their channel. Unlike most Hallmark movies this one was released and I ordered it and added it to my collection.,1275004800,,171,4.375
4231588,5,B003YVP5FM,It is a wonderful story and it is great,1273968000,,39,3.4444444444444446
4231589,5,B003YVP5FM,I originally watched this movie on TV and knew that I would have to have my own copy.  It is a 'feel good' movie and I highly recommend it.,1271894400,12,139,3.793103448275862
4231590,4,B003YVP5FM,"The movie opens with a series of unfortunate events experienced by the 20+ nannies who have tried to cope with the 2 children of David Chandler. Meanwhile, Kate is coping with a father with heart disease, being laid off from her job, working on getting her teaching degree and tutoring kids from low-income families at her church. The driver of the bus on her regular route (and soon-to-be her best friend's boyfriend) connects her with a job because his sister  runs a business providing housekeepers and nannies. That is how the Chandlers meet Kate.

She has the same pranks pulled on her that 9-year-old Ben and 15-year-old Emily played on all of their other victims, but she needs the job, so she sticks with it. She also sees in Emily the shadows of her own past and hopes that she will be able to help her.  Ben begins to thaw toward her, but Emily remains cold and disdainful. This is the hardest part of this movie for me. The father seems completely clueless as to how to teach his daughter to show respect to others. She continually treats the nanny in demeaning ways and the father witnesses it and does little or nothing, other than apologize to Kate for her behavior. It is as if the death of her mother three years ago excuses her from accountability for her actions.

David Chandler is so grateful that Kate has stayed that when he finds himself attracted to her he hesitates to show it
for fear that things might not work out between them and then he will have lost the only nanny that stayed more than a day. Kate is attracted to him, but isn't sure of his feelings at first.

Emily is aware of what is happening between her father and Kate and she does her best to sabatoge the relationship. It appears that she is successful.

**Spoiler Alert**
A turn of events in Kate's life causes her to quit her nanny job, but she returns to the Chandler home (I don't think I mentioned that Kate describes their home as being bigger than the whole apartment complex in which she lives) to give Emily a present on her 16th birthday. Emily is anything but grateful and doesn't bother opening it.

In Kate's mind her association with the Chandler family is over and she is trying to move on with her life, but then Emily finally opens her gift and the surprising content causes a change of heart. She confesses her meddling to her father and the family sets out to get Kate back.

I always struggle with bratty kids in movies--luckily these do change. Kate is such a sweet, patient person and maybe a little ""too-good-to-be-true,"" but she is sustained by her faith and that is a positive message that we could use more of these days. If you can overlook Emily's attitude problem and the fact that she gets a brand new luxury car for her 16th birthday, it is a fun chick-flick.",1271030400,38,2781,4.4930693069306935
4231591,5,B003YVP5FM,"MY HUSBAND AND I WATCHED THIS ON TV TOGETHER. HE USUALLY DOES NOT ENJOY TOO MANY CHIC FLICS. STATED IT WAS A GOOD MOVIE.LOVE THE CAST,",1269475200,3,134,4.1923076923076925
4231592,5,B003YVP5FM,"I watched this on Hallmark Channel and fell in love with the story.

Where a young woman is working her way through school to be a teacher while volunteering to tutor at her church. Her father is very ill she lives with him, they have a great father daughter relationship. After she loses one of her jobs she finds a nanny position with a family where the kids need loads of TLC...

Great story...the father of the Nanny makes it a point to always tell his daughter that he ""Loves her as big as the sky""...

This is the type of quality I've come to associate with the Hallmark name over the years.",1267401600,55,597,4.265486725663717

I kept sticking with it,  hoping that it would get better and it finally did about a minute and a half from the end.  My own grandmother  tragically passed away the day after my mother's 14th birthday. I wouldn't show this movie to  my mom for anything in the world.  This one does not make you smile.

4231636,4,B003YVP5FM,"I want to order a copy of this movie from this seller because (as I really liked the story and characters of The Nanny Express) the Hallmark Channel re-played this movie recently and the network absolutely butchered the story line for playing time (chopped and edited).  Im SURE there were several scenes cut because it was near impossible to follow the story and in many places I was left confused to what was happening.  I am hoping this copy will be the whole movie.  Wouldn't it be nice if Hallmark Channel would release all the movies we've come to love on DVD?  I cross my fingers.  Stay tuned for my ""edited"" review once I get my copy.  Looks to be out of stock at the moment. *sigh* Just my luck.
Update:  I received my DVD copy this week.  So much happier.  Much of the plot holes were filled in from the TV airing.
But one mystifying question...  Why was Brennan Elliott's character wearing a Tuxedo?  The story line never explained this. Why did the father, David Chandler, walk out onto the patio and talk to the Nanny wearing a tuxedo?  I think she even sort of asked for an explanation but in his fluster and tongue-tied state he didn't seem to answer her.  What is up with that?
Did he just randomly pull his formal tuxedo out of his closet and decide to try it on to go all ""James Bond"" on the new nanny?  This definitely seemed to elude to some important continuity scenes being deleted from the final cut.",1463443200,,1423,4.402298850574713

Like with Sound of Music the the dad is broken as much as the kids, as such many won't get him. I see him as the most hurt of the bunch, he just acts differently. In steps a Nanny followed by a long line of other Nannies, all falling prey to the testy twosome, budget cuts, they thought seven would be to much, lol. The Nanny they need finally arrives. She sees beyond the acting out to the why and fully understands. She doesn't make them behave she makes them feel and heal, all of them.",1453593600,2,613,4.159663865546219

I like the kindness and caring of both Kate (Vanessa Marcil) and David (Brennan Elliott))  They are both superb, and the plot is quite touching.  Sometimes it is hard to take the meanness and sarcasm of Emily, but it all comes out beautifully.  I am a hopeless romantic, and do so enjoy the love that develops between David and Kate.  They are both perfect for their roles -- I have to think they are very kind, lovely people in real life, which is refreshing.",1425772800,,584,4.361111111111111

4231759,4,B003YVP5FM,The was a different slant on the widowed father who falls in love again.  The conflict between the new nanny and the teen daughter who resented her was totally believeable and loved the antics of the kids to get rid of various nannies they didn't like.,1380672000,,252,4.478260869565218
4231760,5,B003YVP5FM,"I like good clean movies (or as clean as you can get nowadays). Most people would skip movies like that because they think they are too predictable or ""lame"", but I love them because I know I will be watching something that won't make me feel like I have just been ""slimed"". Nanny Express was really quite clean.  There are regular on-screne acts of romance (kissing), a few utterances of mild obscenity, a couple is shown drinking wine, and there is not violence or nudity. There is several discussions of a mother of children who was killed by drunk driver on her daughter's birthday, and the father of the children's nanny is terminally ill and passes away.  The daughter of the family also lies several times (but she regrets it and tries to make up for it in the end).  The Dove Foundation gave it four stars and approved it suitable for all ages.

It starts out with two children (Emily and Ben) who make nanny after nanny quit, because of the pranks the children pull on them (scaring them with the pet rat, making the washing machine overflow, locking them out of the house).  The dad (David) asks them to promise to not ""plot, plan or stratagize the demise of another nanny""...which they promise...and then don't keep that promise. Finally, David hires Kate, who lost her mother to cancer when she was in high school, and is now taking car of her terminally ill father; while trying to balance work, school and tutoring kids at her church.  Slowly, Ben warms up to Kate, after she impresses him by turning the tables on the kids by locking them out of the house and turning the sprinklers on them, and when she acts calm when he tries to scare her with his pet rat. She has also taught him how to better understand his math homework.  David, not used to having someone else in the house whom he can talk to, starts to fall for Kate as well, but is worried to do anything about it for fear of losing another nanny (let alone the only nanny that hasn't quit in a matter of hours) if things don't work out.  However, he may lose her anyway.  Emily, his teenage daughter, who is still hurting over the death of her mother, has no interest in having this new woman in her or her dad's life, and will do anything she can to get rid of her

The only things that I didn't like about the movie, is with all the tactics the kids use to get rid of all the nanny's, their Dad never punished them for it.  When the daughter is downright rude to Kate, and he is standing right next to his daughter, he doesn't say anything.  I guess the upside is that the daughter does regret her actions at the end and tries to make up for it.  The other thing I didn't like is throughout the whole show the daughter is especially angry and rude to Kate, whenever she brings up the kids mother, (David didn't tell Kate at the beginning that his wife was dead) and Kate never mentions that she lost her mother too. At the end she said it just never felt like the right time, but throughout the show, there where at least 3 absolutely perfect places where the daughter would have responded well to it...desperate for anyone who could help her.  Obviously, Emily is really struggling with the death of her mother, especially since it happened on Emily's birthday.  No one seems to see that she is falling into this hole and no one tries to help her.  Finally at the end, after all Emily has tried to do to get rid of Kate, Kate reaches out one last time to let Emily know that there is one person who understands what she has gone through and has risen above it.  She encourages Emily to ""just try to keep the faith"" and one day she will realize that she had a good day.  Emily finally accept this message and a new friend.

Overall, I really liked the movie and will watch it again.",1379980800,,3760,4.345714285714286

4231777,4,B003YVP5FM,"This is a former TV movie. It follows a fairly standard plot with a lot of expected plot devices for a TV romantic comedy. It is the story of a girl who cares for her sick father while volunteering at a church and studying to be a teacher. She ends up taking a job for a widowed father and his two kids who have driven off 20 or so previous nannies. Of course the kids try to drive her off with all sorts of tricks, but she turns the tables on them and eventually manages to gain the trust of the younger one. By the end of the movie, she even manages to break through with the older kid and the father. There are a number of things about this movie that aren't so great. The first part of the movie seems sort of cheesy and not well-done. The ending is probably one of the more unrealistic endings for a story like this. There are also a number of things in between that don't quite add up. The heroine is supposed to be studying to become a teacher and the end of the movie shows her in a classroom as a teacher just a short time after the rest of the action without any indication of her having done any student teaching or having graduated. There are a couple of secondary characters that have the beginnings of a their own stories, but which are never really followed through in much detail. In spite of some of these shortcomings, once you get past the first ten minutes or so of the movie, it becomes an enjoyable little low-key movie with a lot of heart. You end up liking the characters and feeling pretty good about what happened with the possible exception of an overdone ending. The main character is a fairly well-known actress who does an excellent job of looking like a shy, lonely girl at first while making a transition to a confident and attractive one at the end.

4231811,4,B003YVP5FM,"It is about time someone saw it from the side of the nanny to a bunch of spoiled rich kids. It seems to be portrayed pretty accurately. The story has heart and depth when the daughter struggles to find peace and acceptance over the death of her mother and make room for another female role model in her life and the lives of her family. The nanny whips this family into shape and helps them grieve together to find healing so they can all move forward, especially the dad. Not too mushy but definitely a little romance, just enough not to make all the singles say, ""Really? That is not what life is really like!""",1347926400,,612,4.3304347826086955

I really like this movie. The story is terrific and instantly appealed to me. The opening sequence is genius. Thank you to whoever picked the Overture to Le Nozzi Di Figaro by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756-1791), my favourite composer, as the music that plays during the opening scene. Vannessa Marcil (The Rock) stars in this well-written and beautifully crafted story about a teacher who is hired as a nanny and...I won't ruin it for those of you who haven't seen it. SPOILER ALERT!!! The sister/brother relationship is the sweetest & cutest aspect of the movie, at least for me. SPOILER ALERT OVER!!! (Personal note: I'm an only child, and I wish I had an older sister, a combination of Emily in the movie and the older sister in the television film When Angels Come To Town).

4231819,5,B003YVP5FM,"Good, clean and at least 2 hours of anticipation!  It opened my eyes to how it could be with losing a parent at a young age.  Most of us can probably associate the anger and lash-outs directed at someone that takes the place of one that used to be the star of your eye per se in a relationship/marriage ordeal...but through in taking the place of a child's mother (or father)... I couldn't imagine the pain....  The only thing that left me curious is...what if the nanny hadn't lost her mother at a young age...would the mom/daughter relationship have ever worked out, or would a undeniable love between a man and a woman been thrown away indefinitelyuntil such time that the daughter healed, if ever?  I know some people that still don't have scars from loss of a parent...so they have never healed...",1326931200,,802,4.5874125874125875
4231820,5,B003YVP5FM,"What a pleasing movie this one is.  I will tell you right off that the story is quite predictable and the theme has been used in quite a number of movies over the years.  There are no special effects here, no violence, nothing is blown-up and there is absolutely no cursing.  The most torrid love scenes in the entire movie are two rather chaste and sweet kisses.  There is no nudity and the music is extremely mellow and pleasing to the ear.

A young girl (actually a young woman), has been taking care of her ill father since she was a teen.  She has been working her way through school to become a school teacher.  The young woman lost her mother when she was very young.  Our heroine is offered a job as a nanny and accepts.

Enter the family which consists of a guy and his two children.  The wife has been killed by a drunk driver and the father who is a professional, wealthy and good looking (in addition to being a very nice guy), has a boy and a girl.  The kids are brats, in particular the young girl who is having a dreadful time accepting the death of her mother.

The new nanny has her job cut out for her.  The children have run nanny after nanny off via their rude and poor behavior.  Will our young heroine be able to turn this family around?  Will she able to help the two children?  Will she find true love?

The acting in this one is good.  There is a gentle but not overwhelming religious tone to the movie, i.e. faith in God will see you through if you can just find and keep it; an excellent message.  The minister is played by a rather aging and chubby Stacy Keach (One of my favorites) and the about to die father is played by Dean Stockwell who in my opinion is one of the better character actors working today.  Both play excellent parts.

Like other reviewers here, I cannot classify this one as a romantic comedy (my favorite genre) because it does have a rather serious and important theme to it, but that being said it is rather funny at times, is romantic and has the ""feel.""  I suppose if it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck...well, you know what I mean.

The only complaint I have about the whole movie is the title...how on earth they came up with ""The Nanny Express"" is beyond me.

This is a story of faith, of love and people helping their fellow humans through difficult times.  I liked this movie and will most likely watch it again soon.

4231821,4,B003YVP5FM,"I bought this movie after doing a lot of research to find some clean films for my college-age daughter's collection.  I'm reviewing this from a highly conservative point of view because I appreciate it when someone will let me know about any objectionable material in a film.  Then I don't have to waste my money and find out it's great ""except for that one part.""

My biggest disappointment, honestly, was that the nanny uses God's name twice in an exclamation.  I hoped that in a movie made by a Christian company, that kind of language would be missing.  It is one of the basic ten commandments, after all. There was no other swearing in this movie.

For a low-budget film, I was pleasantly surprised.  The acting was all good and believable.  The low budget manifested itself in the music, but it was tolerable.  I'd choose bad music over bad acting any day!  This story was predictable, yes, but it still had a lot of truth, and there were two moments that I personally related to and got choked up about, having lost both my parents.  The romance was cute.  I would categorize this movie as a ""chick flick"".

Besides the uses of God's name, there were a couple of other things that were bothersome and that would exclude this film from ""all ages"" family viewing, in my opinion.  ***possible spoiler alert*** FIRST:  At one point the nanny is alone in the house when the father of the two kids comes home.  She says she should go, and he says she should stay and suggests they celebrate her getting an A on her college exam.  He pours them some wine and they drink it together.  They appear to relax from the affects of the wine, and then he puts the moves on her.  She responds and they start kissing.  They are both sitting in chairs facing each other.  The kissing is what I call the lip-lock kind of kissing, where mouths are partially open.  As they are kissing, the daughter walks in and finds them .  My objections to this are that they are in the house alone, they don't know each other very well yet, and their kissing isn't just the innocent kind.  However, this scene is not overtly sexual either.  SECOND:  The nanny wears some clothing that is not as modest as I'd like my kids to see.  When she starts to feel attracted to the father of the children, she dresses up for work in a spaghetti strap sundress that is above the knees, and then later when she goes to the ballet, she wears something similar.  At the birthday party, she has on a completely strapless sundress.  The daughter also wears some similar attire for her dance class and at the birthday party.

I hope this is helpful.  I like reviews that lay out anything that could possibly be offensive so I can make informed decisions on what I will purchase.  For my college-age daughter, this movie was a keeper and a welcome change from so many movies that are not wholesome.  She will mute the language or use a TV guardian.",1325030400,7,2904,4.47047619047619

4231830,4,B003YVP5FM,"I usually avoid these family kind of movies.  They tend to be corny, mushy, over done with syrupy music playing from start to finish.  This one is a refreshing surprise!

My wife and I decided to sit this one through, and yes, of course, you pretty much know what's going to happen from start to finish.  A young teacher to be takes a nanny position from a rich, handsome guy(Can there be any other type?)widower who has two bratty children.  This is lighthearted fair, but with a couple dramatic elements, basically dealing with the death of one's parents.  Also, I wouldn't call it a true romantic comedy because the protaganist don't spend the first half of the movie hating/fighting with one another; nonetheless, a potential romance ensues.

Two of my favorite, stalwart actors perform well in their small but important roles: Dean Stockwell as the nanny's 'hanging-on-to-his-last-gasp', loving father and Stacy Keach as the tad potbellied, sympathetic, wise minister.  I love these guys, they act without acting!

Produced by Faith and Family Entertainment, they live up to their name.  It's clean, and the story gently stresses faith in God, seeing things through, and love.

My one complaint, they do play the music non-stop through the movie, but thankfully, it's not has syrupy as most.  You know, it's difficult to make a fully balanced movie, and I think more so with family fare, and have all the elements work well.

If you need a bit more meat, bite or uncertainty in a flick, you're not going to like this one, but for us and for this type of genre, we found it satisfying. Also, there's no nasty people or words, enjoy a few smiles and tears.",1282348800,22,1659,4.778947368421052
