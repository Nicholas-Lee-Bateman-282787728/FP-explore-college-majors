3870159,5,B00280LZAE,"My sister has read all the books and was very excited to find out that they were being made into a tv show.  I bought this set for her birthday and that is all she would talk about.  We had to watch ""True Blood"".  Well I am so glad I got this for her.  From the first episode I was hooked.  The show is fantastic!  I can't wait for the second season to come out.  I might have to get HBO as I don't know if we can wait for the boxset!!",1247616000,6,435,3.6630434782608696
3870160,5,B00280LZAE,"This is not correct, it is a typo or something. Season 1 is for sale, we are still in the middle of Season 2, it's not even done yet. Something is really wrong here!!! True Blood is the best show ever!!!",1247529600,,203,3.975609756097561
3870161,5,B00280LZAE,Season 1 was absolutely great!!! I can't wait for season 2 on HBO and I have already preordered the dvd. Keep up the good work HBO.,1247097600,6,131,4.076923076923077
3870162,5,B00280LZAE,"I loved all 9 books and season 1. Anxiously waiting for season 2 now...
Since I haven't seen it yet, I can't really comment on it. I'll just say my expectations are VERY high and I have already placed my order.

If you like this type of books or shows, check out the Dresden Files too. Also books by Kerrelyn Sparks, Kim Harrison, Lynsay Sands and Rachel Vincent.",1246838400,2,363,4.338235294117647
3870163,5,B00280LZAE,"I've read all the books. Watched all the episodes. I love the way the actors portray the characters. My favorite is Eric because not only is Alexander Skarsgard super hot, but he plays him perfectly. I'm really hoping that they keep going with this series because I'm most excited about seeing season three which should be about the book Club Dead. If you haven't read the books I strongly recommend you do. Anther hit HBO!",1246579200,31,423,4.653333333333333
3870164,5,B00280LZAE,"I've read all the books as they came out.  I didn't want to watch the TV series because I thought it would ruin my vision of the people and places.  But I got curious and found I was so wrong.  The producers have stayed with the book plot lines. Everyone looks and acts almost exactly as I pictured.  I have never seen this happen before.  Oh, I will say Eric is not quite as beautiful as I pictured, but I didn't expect anyone could be.  He's got the charisma though. Charlaine Harris writes well or I never would have read stories like hers.  I'm a fan of her grave finder as well.",1246492800,13,583,4.151785714285714

3870183,1,B00280LZAE,"I watched it up to season 2, episode 3. Long enough to decide the general format was nothing more than soft porn and gore. Which is probably why the majority of viewers rate it so highly. We've become a classless society of morons.",1499990400,,231,4.395348837209302

3870194,5,B00280LZAE,"I loved the first few seasons of True Blood. I'm about a generation removed from the backwoods, and the metaphors are strong but tempered with compassion.

The writing is mostly excellent (although I did not enjoy the later seasons as much as the first few, mainly because I felt that some of the characters were written so far into corners that it was unrealistic for them to remain welcome in their communities). The vampire mythology is interesting - far more complex than the sparkly series or the chronicles - and the regulars AND the guest stars give thoroughly solid performances. Worth watching all the way through.",1491696000,,623,4.877358490566038

3870732,3,B00280LZAE,"Dumb show. I don't know why I'm watching it. It doesn't begin to compare with something like The Wire or Burning Bad or The Americans or Homeland. There are so many contradictions in this show and it's just downright disgustingly bloody. For example, if V heals wounds on people, then why do they go around with fang holes in their necks? And if vampires don't have emotions, then why are they always upset or sad or in love? The part that really turns me off is when they show parts of a dead vampire. All the humans in this show are pretty stupid except for maybe Lafayette and Tara but they are both emotionally messed up to one degree or another. I think I'm watching just because I've run out of other series to watch right now. I'm pretty bored in the evenings.",1471392000,,767,4.370629370629371

It's always sad to see someone post a ""it's really bad"" comment on a movie or tv show.

3870778,5,B00280LZAE,I absolutely love True Blood season two and the suspense i almost lost the placement of what season as i continue to watch. The seasons fly by like you will never even know your on season four because it pulls you in. Definitely do not want to watch this around kids the sexual content in it is very high but me and my partner always wait for the kids to go to bed so we can enjoy our adult show. If you like vampire diaries and drama filled shows this will be a extra souped up adult show for you to enjoy. I think the whole sookie thing is even more intense but in my own mind kinda funny since she is always the girl who needs to be saved but try's saving everyone else herself. The way i don't want to put any detail in anything because it takes all the joy out of being able to watch yourself and help make it much more exciting for your expectations. Enjoy a great show and be prepared for a great new show just for you adults or even you parents who have to watch cartoons all day.,1469923200,4,988,4.020304568527918

Even after reading the books and knowing how the story goes, it's fun to see it ""come to life"".  The character of Bill Compton is always trying to do the right thing and remain ""human"" to the best of his ability as a vampire.  Stephen Moyer does a great job showing both sides of Bill.",1461110400,,381,4.205479452054795
