8347574,2,B001WYM3O4,"This isn't the worst zombie film made in the US, it just tries to be. The movie starts out on an island where there is a battle between loggers and environmentalists. One of the loggers hits a spike while cutting down a tree. The recoil from the chainsaw cuts his shoulder. Some of the sap from the experimental tree gets in the wound and BINGO! You suddenly have a flesh eating zombie.

The scene quickly moves to a board of director scene who haven't heard from the logging camp. There is a long dialogue scene between the owner of the company and his son while they are playing snooker. It is badly written, badly acted, and badly directed, pretty much like the rest of the movie. The owner wants his son to learn the business so he goes out to the camp, which he finds deserted and he is chased by zombies, who at times can run fast, and other times move like they have a broken leg.  Go Figure.

Meanwhile back in the lab a clumsy bio-chemist cuts himself and gets some of the evil sap in his blood. He goes on to bite the neck out of his partner. Then we have the lab covered in plastic. A man in protective gear is taking pictures of the scene at the same time two guys in suits are standing there. Dad decides his son is in danger and the decision is made to lock down the logging camp, even though no one really knows what is going on.

Anyway the plot at this point becomes even more pointless. Zombies do not require head shots to kill...so are they really zombies?",1343520000,,1476,4.241992882562277
8347575,4,B001WYM3O4,"Severed is surprisingly good, seeing that the slew of recent zombie flicks leave something to be desired, this one actually does well in the sea of mediocrity. A new premise of zombie creation is brought forth, which is always new and welcome in itself.  A lumber corporation is genetically enhancing tree growth to speed production, but an accident causes the mutation to spread to humans and cause them to turn into zombies going on a strict all you can eat meat diet.  There are a few scenes with a lot of blood and gore but most of the scenes are insinuated and you never see them being ripped apart, only blood splatters from both the zombies and those killing the zombies.

  The story takes place 200 miles from the nearest city, so the loggers and the environmentalist are on their own and isolated.  The corporation has started clean up and contamination procedures and has labeled all involved as dead or expendable to keep what has happened there a secret and the corporations involvement out of it.  So there is no rescue party coming and everyone is truly on there own.  The only hope they have lies within themselves, and unfortunately like so many other zombie movies there are always some morons that manages to get most everyone killed.  Acting was good and everything seemed believable and in proper place.  A Zombie movies that thinks outside the box, and doesn't just check the normal things that you might see in a zombie movie off the list.  A Must add if your a zombie movie collector.",1294099200,,1536,4.711610486891386
