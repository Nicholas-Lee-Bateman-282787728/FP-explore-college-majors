3656438,5,B001JAMJ0Y,"In this quirky comedy by new comers Brian & Dean Ronalds, Steve Burns (Blues Clues) plays Otto Granberry a lowly cubical worker of Berm-Tech Industries, Inc.  The story begins when Otto is asked into the office of his boss (Darrell Hammond of SNL) to discover a co-worker has been impaled with a stake to the heart.  This is only the first joke in this vampiric comedy and there is no way I can do this scene justice.

This film is based on a short by the Ronalds brothers and also stars Dave Foley (Kids in the Hall, News Radio) and Jason Mewes (Clerks and every Kevin Smith film) and follows a murder mystery in a company that hides a group of vampires... er Netherbeast from the rest of the world.  They are nice monsters who only eat the recently deceased instead of hunting their prey.  But someone is slowly killing them off.

I can't say this is a laugh out loud movie but it was very very funny and the oddities of it are beyond enjoyable.

I'm glad I added this film to my library.  If you like comedies that are slightly eskewed then you will really enjoy this one.  If you however are someone who thinks Larry the Cable guy is a comedy genius then this is so not for you.",1247097600,,1182,4.288288288288288
3656439,4,B001JAMJ0Y,"There seems to be some confusion concerning the merits of this film, but love it or hate it (& consensus seems to be on the side of the former), 'NetherBeast Incorporated' has a life of its own.
I bought the DVD for two reasons; one, I am a lukewarm fan of the genre (this is a genre? you say...), & two, my cousin is in it.  To say I was pleasantly surprised, cousin or no cousin, is an understatement. I really didn't know what I was getting into, but in fact, I was hooked immediately & watched with growing fascination as the thing unfolded.
The inspired insertion of President Garfield & Alexander Graham Bell as pivots, & the kind of Bill-&-Ted-Do-Phoenix aspect thereby engendered,  had me laughing out loud. The DVD presentation is further enhanced by the Commentary Version in the Special Features section.  A good time was had by all, apparently, & I recommend 'NetherBeast' wholeheartedly.",1247097600,,900,4.719745222929936
3656440,4,B001JAMJ0Y,"I bought this movie because Amy Davidson is in it.
  I watched it more than once because it is original, witty, well made, and thoroughly entertaining. Highly recommend it to anyone who likes dark comedy.",1240617600,,204,4.8
3656441,1,B001JAMJ0Y,didn't get past 15 minutes...  maybe it improved but i have to say there wasn't much they could build on.  one of the worst movies i've ever seen...,1240272000,,148,4.25
3656442,3,B001JAMJ0Y,"This was a difficult movie to rate. If I was to rate just on the basis of originality and creativity, I would have rated it higher. Today it seems that Hollywood has an ingredient list for making a movie. Or perhaps its more like a cookie cutter. Most of the time, we see the same plot lines, and the same ole scripts, re-hashed again and again and again. Most movie makers today have no clue how to make a movie that is new, original, and exciting. This movie does not meet all those qualifications either, but it is original.

NetherBeast Incorporated is a movie about a corporation that is run by vampires. Yeah, I said vampires. If that is not original and deserving of praise, I don't know what is. If my rating of the movie was based solely on this, I would have give it a 10. Ok, maybe a 8 or 9, cause the plot was not as well thought out as it could have been.

The movie started out beautifully. Im not going to tell ya, cause I don't want to give it away. NetherBeast is a dark satirical spin on the office, right down to the goofy boss. In fact, this made me wonder which came first. The office or NetherBeast.

NetherBeast has a few short comings. The acting is above par for this sort of independent movie, but was still lacking, especially for a few characters.

Though this makes me wonder if it was the acting that was bad, or the writing or direction. After all, even the best actor or actress will suffer from poor writing and direction. Case in point is Judd Nelson. I don't think he is quite as bad of an actor and this movie portrayed him to be. However, I applaud him for choosing a script which probably did not pay him very well.

This movie probably had next to no budget at all, so the fact that its special effects were really bad is Im sure of no surprise.

What did surprise me though was the poor writing. The movie started out well enough, (I loved the narrated bits that talked about the differences between movie vampirism and the real thing... At least their movie version of the real thing) but by the time we got into the middle, I could tell that the writer was already running out of ideas. By the end part of the movie, ideas had disappeared altogether.

It reminded me of Star Trek Voyager. 50 minutes was spent on building up the story line. Then 10 of it was spent on the climax, which was very anti-climatic.

So taking all this into consideration, Id give the movie an overall score of 7 out of a possible 10. Mainly because of its originality.

Its worth watching!",1233532800,,2509,4.309978768577495
3656443,5,B001JAMJ0Y,"Could you ask for a funnier movie?  Killer cast, great gags... Definetly more in the ""comedy"" genre than the ""horror comedy"" genre, nothing in here is really going to scare you, but if you're looking for a great laugh, look no further!

Great production value for an indie flik, well written, well acted, the only problem with it is some of the timing, laugh moments come so quick and often, I had to rewind it a couple times cause my friends were still laughing when the next bit came at them!

If you have a sense of humor, and are looking for a bit of a different take, please take the time to add this to your cart, you won't regret it!",1231977600,,640,4.229508196721311
3656444,4,B001JAMJ0Y,"Having seen the short film  ""The Netherbeast of Berm-Tech Industries Inc"" some time ago, I have been eagerly awaiting the DVD release of the feature length film Netherbeast Incorporated. It does not disappoint.

Vampires ( or Netherfolk as they prefer to be called ) are among us. Toiling away in cubicles, chanting the same inane corporate slogans. They just want to live their lives and hit their productivity goals. The only major difference is that they must consume human flesh and blood to survive. In order to do so they cloister themselves away in their corporate headquarters, maintaining minimal human contact except for regular shipments of donated blood and the recently deceased. So what happens when the boss loses his mind and starts hiring humans from the outside? We get a movie that lies somewhere between Office Space and From Dusk Till Dawn.

The special features are entertaining and add to the experience. They have even included the original short film, which is excellent by itself.

All in all, this is a fun movie. There are horror elements and some gore, but they are primarily used to comic effect. If you are a fan of films like Evil Dead or Shaun of the Dead, Netherbeast Incorporated is for you.",1231632000,3,1226,4.851674641148326
3656445,5,B001JAMJ0Y,"I haven't gotten to watch this DVD yet, but it arrive before it was released to the public, which is great. However, I'm in Omaha on a business trip, so I can't watch it yet.

I've seen this movie twice already, at the 2007 Phoenix Film Festival, as well as a short promotional gig in Tempe, AZ on Mill Ave.

One of my good friends helped make this film, so I'm partial to it! It's like a twist of Buffy the Vampire Slayer meets Office Space. Some very familiar faces in the movie, and even more familiar places set in Phoenix, AZ. Independent, but great!",1231200000,,555,4.276190476190476
8312580,4,B001JAMJ0Y,Very interesting movie and great people in it from what I have been able to watch. However the DVD I purchased is defective or something. My DVD player makes awful noises and the DVD skips so I can't even watch it in full. Ugh....,1501459200,,230,4.25

8312584,5,B001JAMJ0Y,"A very strange kind of twisted comedy.
Dave Foley.
Darrell Hammond.
Steve Burns.
Jason Mewes.
Those names alone were what encouraged me to buy it, and I am not at all disappointed.
It is a low-budget film, so don't expect any fancy CGI or Michael Bay-type explosions.
If you like dry humor and don't mind budget effects you really ought to give it a shot.",1417132800,,355,4.476923076923077
8312585,2,B001JAMJ0Y,"This movie has a decent B or C list cast but it suffers from the format.  The movie starts out with a ton of flashbacks to explain a very complicated situation the movie takes place in.  All of this felt to me like it would have been best broken into 22 minute increments.

The story limes are palatable but the lack of budget harms the film immensely.  Eating flesh and human blood isn't an easy special effect I imagine and since it's so critical to the film I'm surprised they didn't pull it off better.

It feels like there is a bit of over narration as well. The script could have been rewritten to filter the movie down a tad. If the flick was 15 minutes shorter you wouldn't feel that drag that runs through the whole movie.",1372982400,,731,4.268115942028985
8312586,4,B001JAMJ0Y,"This horror comedy definitely takes a fun and quirky angle at the typical vampire story. Back in 2009 when I purchased this, vampires weren't quite everywhere and it was especially enjoyable... but even now, years later, this is a fun/odd hour of laughs you won't regret killing (pun intended).",1362268800,,294,5.020408163265306
8312587,1,B001JAMJ0Y,"This film has a good premise and the opening scene is laugh out loud funny, but it gets steadily worse after that.  Many of the jokes fall so flat that I felt embarrassed for the actors trying to pull them off.  About 1/5 of the film is composed of expository first person narrative asides set to elevator music, and much of the dialogue feels like filler--dull, jokey conversations that do nothing to advance the story or tell us anything about far too many underdeveloped, gimmicky characters.  I adjust my expectations in various ways where indie movies are concerned, but this script should probably ""nether"" have been produced in the first place.",1257552000,,651,4.846846846846847
8312588,3,B001JAMJ0Y,"Otto is the perfect corporate drone who, when summoned to his Boss' office for a new assignment, is justifiably shocked to see a co-worker sprawled in an adjacent chair with a huge wooden stake rammed through his heart.  His Boss however, sees nothing amiss since this is the manner in which one normally dispatches a vampire so to have killed him in any  other way would have been absurd.  Thus begins NETHERBEAST INCORPORATED a mostly successful satire of corporate America disguised as a horror movie.

The plot centers around Otto and the other employees of Berm-Tech Industries Inc. (the world's largest makers of telephones) as they try to stop their boss from destroying their safe little cubicled world, because you see, they ARE vampires and so is he for that matter is he, a fact that eludes him due to an inconvenient case of ""vampire Alzheimer's"" which may or may not clear up on it's own. Now these aren't your typical movie vampires and their differences are explained throughout the film via powerpoint presentations. For instance they all live in the same building in which they work , insulated from the general public except for the occasional night on the town. Their ""meals"" are donated blood and unclaimed corpses because these vampires, unlike their Hollywood bretheren, aren't on a strictly liquid diet.  And of course, all employees of Berm-Tech Industries Inc. are Netherfolk like themselves. (That's another difference. They don't refer to themselves as vampires.) No humans are allowed past the receptionist. That is until one day their wacked out boss informs them he has hired an efficiency expert from the outside to come in and get the office ""up to speed.""  And that's just the beginning of the problems. A co-worker goes missing and wacky Mr. Hammond replaces him with a HUMAN temp, a pretty girl to whom Otto quickly becomes attracted.

Right now I'm sure you're thinking; Wow, I'm in for a great horror comedy!  But the sad truth is, not so much. NETHERBEAST INCORPORATED opens with a bang and then gradually starts losing all of it's energy. The cast does it's best with the material which is perhaps a bit underwritten in the last two acts. Turner Claymore who plays Boss Darrell Hammond is hilarious as the vampire without a clue, when he's off screen the movie loses a lot of it's interest. Steven Landry (from ""Blues Clues"") as the Dilbert-like Otto is more than adequate, and Judd Nelson is amusing as the efficiency expert who harbors a secret of his own. The thing that really bothered me about the film, so much so that I knocked a whole point off my rating, is the musical score. And I NEVER pay attention to musical scores! It has to be extremely good or extremely bad for me to take note (pun intended) of it. And this score was bad. It was a bit too loud and tended to drown out parts of the dialogue, but worse yet it constantly tried to remind us that we were watching a comedy. It had everything but rim shots in it and was very distracting. A more serious score would have worked to better advantage by being a counterpoint to the comedy.

Whatever  the film had to offer in terms of creativity and originality  is ultimately ruined by bad pacing, weak scripting, and an annoying musical score. Can I recommend NETHERBEAST INC.? Only as a rental.",1252972800,,3298,4.7282229965156795
8312589,1,B001JAMJ0Y,"i wrote a long review but somehow i lost it.
'netherbeast inc.'-  it's on the level of a poorly made tv comedy [that really doesn't make you laugh.
vampires hide in a corperation.  they've been doing it for so long that they bicker.  the ceo vampire has a brain disease like alzheimers.  he hires an outside consultant [industrial psychologest or sociologist] to bring back morale.  now who's killing fellow vampire employees, why kill them, and is this all just to take over the ceo's position???  can a vampire and mortal fall in love???  the real answer, based on this movie, will be: 'who cares.  give me my money back!'
david foley [whom i really like, deserves better roles] is as two dimentional as the other charactors.
  i see that there do exist 7 people that think this is an 'okay' movie.  good for them, at least somebody made a movie they could enjoy.  you're probably not one of them.",1249344000,2,899,4.584905660377358
