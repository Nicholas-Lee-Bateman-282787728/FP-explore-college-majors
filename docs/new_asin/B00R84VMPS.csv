8694463,2,B00R84VMPS,"I thought I was going into a coma.  It started out fairly decent, then it just dragged on & started taking such an obvious path.  No, for me the acting by the lead young lady was flat, the same demeanor throughout.  The other known actors were just grabbing a quick paycheck & I can't believe they were in this movie or they owed someone a favor.  I'm sure younger adults will enjoy this, but the movie was just...meh.",1519689600,,418,4.32051282051282

8694467,3,B00R84VMPS,"Haunted by the death and dreams of her beloved mother in a Montauk surfing accident, 16-year-old Beckett and her father, novelist Miles Warner, move to Manhattan and attempt to piece together their shattered life. Now enrolled at the exclusive Hamilton preparatory school, her psychosis and hallucinations intensify with the dubious suicides of current and past students, as does her first love for Tobey Crawford. the women running the school are perpetually young and beautiful. Not hard to figure out how. The story is.....okay. The ending is very, very predictable. it is annoying how the girls father is lead around by his private parts. All the performers (esp. the young man playing Toby) are wonderful and enjoy and play the parts well. Now the biggest drawback...Kelly Reilly, the stone faced chick playing the lead...awful, never cracked a smile and showed not a wit of emotion....ever!

8694468,2,B00R84VMPS,"The film centers on Beckett Warner (Sophie Curtis) whose mother (Kelly Bensimon) dies in the first scene in what appears like she went surfing without knowing how to swim. Later on we discover it was an aneurism. Because mom dies, dad opts to move them from the country to the safe confines of the big city. Dad (Linus Roache) is the famous author Miles Warner, the most misused occupation in horror films outside of high school janitor. Miles scores a pad from his publisher (Stephanie March) who has a son Toby (Graham Phillips) who gives Beckett skate board lessons that never tie into the film due to poor script writing.

Beckett goes to the prestigious private Hamilton school where all the teachers look young and making me wish I hadn't read the DVD cover about the film and watched it cold. TMI. On her first day she hears whispers in the off limits garden, hallucinates seeing blood, becomes faint, and watches a girl (Chloe Levine) do a swan dive off the roof. Dad wants to pull her out of school, but Beckett doesn't want to ""run away."" Beckett befriends Jen (Sarah Sutherland) a girl in a plain skirt as opposed to plaid.  Meanwhile Pamela Hamilton (Kelly Reilly) the school's owner, is an overpowering redhead who finds her way into her home and dad's bed.

I think you can guess the rest of the film. I know I managed to guess the entire film from the DVD cover except for the poorly developed lead character and lame soundtrack. The film feels like a ""made for TV"" production, not daring to be creative. Sophie Curtis deadpan acting reminded me of she who which we do not speak from that sparkling vampire film.

Guide: No F-bombs that I recall. Implied sex. No nudity.",1426982400,4,1685,4.6066666666666665
8694469,5,B00R84VMPS,This movie is very well executed. It kept me and my teenagers at the edge of our seats waiting to see what may happen next. The imagery and art direction are top notch as is the score.,1426550400,,184,4.0
8694470,2,B00R84VMPS,"After a teen named Becket (Sophie Curtis) sees her mom die unexpectedly while they are surfing together her dad relocates hoping for a fresh start and enrolls her in an exclusive all girl's school--unfortunately it's run by a coven of witches who use the blood of virgins to stay eternally young.  Almost immediately after arriving Becket witnesses the apparent suicide of a student but isn't sufficiently spooked to stop going to the school, although it doesn't take long for her to become suspicious of the school nurse (Kelly Reilly) and of some of the other teachers who all seem to be sharing a secret that they make very little attempt to hide.

The whole new girl at school run by witches thing was already done most famously in Dario Argento's garishly stylized classic Susperia and more recently by genre specialist Lucky McKee with The Woods.  Innocence unfortunately adds nothing new of its own and mostly seems to be barely making an effort to function as a horror movie.

A huge chunk of screen-time is eaten up by Becket's developing romance with a boy named Tobey who teaches her how to skateboard (scared yet?) and to a lesser extent her friendship with classmate Jen (a charming but underutilized Sarah Sutherland).  There are also numerous scenes of Becket's dad spending way too much time with school nurse Pamela (Kelly Reilly) who seems to be playing a really boring version of Joanna Pacula's character from The Kiss.  Every 20-30 minutes Becket has a scary dream or vision to remind us that we are watching a horror movie, which is easy to forget since Innocence mostly seems to be doing other things.

There's no reason Innocence couldn't have been genuinely creepy but director/co-writer Hilary Brougher seems to be entirely disinterested in making an effective horror movie--there's no attempt to build tension across scenes and the movie is lazy when depicting Becket's increasing suspicions and attempt to investigate--at one point she's in her bedroom looking at a web site for her school then in the next shot she's looking at an occult website about female demons and the use of virgin blood to acquire eternal youth.  What exactly on the school web site led Becket to the occult page?  Innocence doesn't seem to think details like that matter.

Innocence needed to be a lot more focused on its horror elements.  Providing a deadline before which Becket needs to uncover the truth might have helped generate some suspense in the movie which seems to have no sense of urgency at all.  Becket enlisting the help of pals Tobey and Jen in her investigation probably would have been a good idea since Becket sneaking around on her own with no clear purpose doesn't generate much dramatic interest.

Innocence also mishandles a major plot point that could have been used to much greater effect--in order for a girl's blood to be of use to the witches the girl must be a virgin--so it's really not very hard for a girl with that knowledge to render herself useless to the witches.  Given the fact virginity is much more rare in teens these days than when the witches started using the school to attract candidates for sacrifice it would also mean that the teachers would need to keep the girls from having sex, a promising idea that the movie acknowledges but only just barely.  Innocence never explains how or why certain girls are chosen to be groomed for sacrifice and doesn't give the evil teachers enough screen-time to function as effectively creepy villains.  Kelly Reilly's school nurse is clearly meant to stand in for all of them and be the main villain but her performance is so flat she ends up coming across more dull than threatening.

Innocence is a dud that wastes the elements for a good horror movie with indifferent writing and direction that provides virtually nothing in the way of pacing or suspense.  It is watchable because of the attractive cast and slick production values but also pretty lousy if you have any hopes for something creepy.",1425513600,3,3988,4.839705882352941
8694471,3,B00R84VMPS,"3 1/2 STARS FOR A CONCEPT THAT INTRIGUES, BUT LEAVES A LITTLE ON THE TABLE

The idea of setting a gothic mystery or supernatural thriller in a metropolitan area might seem a little unconventional though there are certainly buildings that will fit the bill.  However, the infatuation of certain characters will make sense with the affluent setting by the time the movie is done.  I can't say anymore without giving it away.  The production values are good and there are some interesting characters.  However, I did feel certain things held the movie back from being something greater.  It can still entertain.  For those wondering, this is not a remake of the 2004 Marion Cotillard film by the same name which was also set at a private school.

THE PLOT (no spoilers):  Beckett (Sophie Curtis) is a young high school age girl who has just lost her mother.  She and her father move into New York where they live in a nice apartment through a connection named Natalie.  This same woman is publishing her father's book, while also getting Beckett into a prestigious private school that seems to be entirely administered by wealthy women.  The viewer soon sees that Beckett is haunted by nightmares and hallucinations since her mother's death.  Further, her new school is very welcoming, but somehow off in its atmosphere.  Things are complicated as the school nurse  Pamela (Kelly Rielly) takes an interest in both Beckett, and her father.  Beckett is also drawn romantically to Natalie's son Toby.  Beckett's dreams and hallucinations grow worse after witnessing the suicide of a fellow student.  She becomes suspicious of the school history and conducts her own investigation into macabre happenings and the strange women of the school board.

WHAT I LIKED:  Overall I enjoyed the movie and was struck by how fitting Kelly Rielly's presence was in the film.  She is a terrific actress and there is something in her eyes that just goes well with this sort of film.  I am not referring to the artificial flashes of blue they add at certain points.  She just has a very different look and expressive eyes.  The movie has an appropriately macabre feel and I was glad they didn't overdo it.  The ending is a little dramatic, but most of the way they take a reasonably subtle direction despite the supernatural context of the story.  There are some beautiful settings.

THE LESS GOOD:  I believe there was an intentional effort to project a natural sense of teen ambivalence.  I am not saying teens are ambivalent.  I am saying they attempt to project that image onto certain characters.  Add that to the intentionally somber feel of the flick, and it ends up translating as somewhat drab rather than macabre at times.  The setting also challenged the feel of the movie at times though it was appropriate to the emphasis on certain themes.  Ultimately the drab feel and lack of emotion in certain areas held the movie back from being a much more evocative thriller.  The sudden shifts to supernatural aspects at certain moments felt a little unsupported since they were only modestly developed.",1425340800,2,3086,4.871153846153846
8694472,3,B00R84VMPS,"** I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

I owe my daughter a lot of thanks for introducing me to the world of YA fiction.  I never thought of YA as being intense or riveting enough to hold my interest, but wowafter reading THE HUNGER GAMES series and a few other other titles, I am thoroughly impressed.  This is the reason I jumped on the movie adaptation of INNOCENCE, a film based on a book of the same name by author Jane Mendelsohn.  INNOCENCE is a gothic coming-of-age tale with a supernatural twist, and while the movie is not perfect, it is still thrilling and entertaining.  Fans of YA films will probably want to give this one a look.

If this film version of INNOCENCE follows the book pretty closely, I could see it as the jumping-off point for a series.  The movie provides a lot of material that could be pieced together to make a trilogy, as I can see several plot lines that could evolve from the way the film ends.  I won't give any spoilers away, but lets just say I was very satisfied with its conclusion.

INNOCENCE is shot well and has a fairly high production value.  I particularly like the location chosen for the school.  I don't know where this place is (the Blu-ray is void of any Special Features, unfortunately), but I would love to visit it.  The building appears very gothic in nature and the landscape on which it sits is very foreboding.

The acting is solid, with actress Sophie Curtis portraying the lead character.  Id swear Ive seen her in something previous, however I don't recall watching any of her prior films that are listed on her IMDB page.  Still, she does a great job with this role, giving her odd-girl-out character real life.  Likewise, her co-stars Graham Phillips and Kelly Reilly do a fine job with their portrayals as well.

Theres not many special effects in INNOCENCE, but those we see are well done.  I particularly like the funky eye-thing the ladies of the coven do before they drink the virgins blood.  Its not necessarily a ground-breaking effect, but it looks impressive nonetheless.

But although INNOCENCE is a fun film to watch, it does have some flaws.  First and foremost is the running time.  90 minutes is not nearly enough time to tell this story.  This should have been two hours at least.  This extra time would allow more fleshing out of the secondary characters, many of whom cast no shadow of menace because we simply don't know them.  A longer film would have helped develop them and the storyline.

Also, some aspects of the story are reasons for concern.  For instance, Beckett makes some interesting deductions that many normal people probably would not.  I likened this to Sherlock Holmes Syndrome, where a character is almost superhuman compared to everyone else.  This struck me as a negative, because it made the realism of the film drop a bit.

Still, INNOCENCE is a fun YA movie that is worth checking out.  It makes a statement in a way, by telling Hollywood you don't have to have a $180 million budget to make an entertaining adaptation of a book.  This film will hit shelves tomorrow if you want to give it a look.",1425254400,2,3137,4.576301615798923
