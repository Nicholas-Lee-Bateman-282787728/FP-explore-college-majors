8258815,4,B0015KG364,"I've have and read Hogan's 5 Fundamentals of Golf and decided to take my game to another level.  A friend suggested this DVD so, I took a chance.  The contents presented are theoretical so, you have to practice it's methods to understand how to ""work"" a ball.  I don't suggest this product to a beginner or high handicaper but to someone who already has a consistent swing.",1305417600,,373,4.537313432835821
8258816,1,B0015KG364,"there are about a dozen swings of ben hogan in the DVD intro that are only played once. other than that, this instructor i never heard of breaks down hogan's book (5 Lessons...). then, this guy has the BALLS to pretend he is BEN HOGAN, dressed up in the cap and everything, and they even switch from color to black and white film to add to the ""effect."" they show tons of crappy golf swings of this luther whatever-his-name-is teacher make his sad attempt at being BEN HOGAN. really? are you serious? the guy had no lag. i can't believe this guy when he says he played 44 pro golf tournaments.

don't waste your money and time like i did. get the Ben Hogan Collection DVD. it's got a lot of great footage of hogan's swing, and a pretty good break down of the swing by jim mclean.

sadly, i had to give it one star as that is the lowest score i could give. otherwise i would have given it a negative five stars.

this DVD is a total scam and these guys are just trying to make money on ben hogan's name.",1259020800,4,1002,4.154639175257732
8258817,5,B0015KG364,"Luther Blacklock delivers a one of a kind strike of excellence with his DVD!!!!
He does not disrespect in any way the great work of Mr. Hogan`s book :  5 Lessons,  the modern fundamentals of golf.

Mr. Blacklock, with a perfectly clear and easy way, takes us on a new level in the understanding of both the golf swing and the 5 fundamentals of Ben Hogan.
In all the cases he gives a profound and thorough insight on what Mr. Hogan teaches us through his book, and he ADDS with great precision the ""lost information"", details and ""keywords"" that are not present (in 5 lessons) or that simply didn`t occur to Ben Hogan.

Let me give 1 example of this : Radial Ball Position when we address the ball, neither constant or ""moving"".....you have to see it on the dvd....

There is no doubt in my mind that Ben Hogan would approve and recomend the work of L. Blacklock.
5 Gold Stars!",1257379200,3,876,4.382716049382716
