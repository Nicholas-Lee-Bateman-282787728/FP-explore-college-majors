3936015,4,B002IC1ETE,"I'm a fan of Ginger Rogers which was my main motive in buying this film.  And while some of the archive movies of hers that I've bought have been excellent, this one fell short. It centers around professional girls going to a summer camp and finding romance while they are there.  Unfortunately, the guy Ginger Rogers is paired up with isn't likeable.  Which is the main flaw of the film.  Ginger's acting is hilarious and well done as usual.  But the fellow is a down on his luck attorney (it is during the Depression era) and he asks Ginger to basically shack up with him rather than get married.  She gets upset over that lackluster type of proposal, and rightfully so. With the end result being that he finally overcomes his concern about money and gives her a full respectable proposal.  I sat throught his film because I'm a fan of Ginger Rogers, but I don't really recommend the movie based off of its own merit.",1285804800,8,919,4.5
3936016,5,B002IC1ETE,"This wonderful RKO film from producer Pandro S. Berman has a sweetness and sense of charm only films from the 1930's posessed. Perhaps because it was a lesser production shoved between RKO's new screen team of Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire this warm and enjoyable film hasn't gotten the attention it deserves. Ginger's fans, however, have always been aware of its existence.

Ginger is both lovely and endearing as Teddy, a young typist who laments she must work 50 weeks out of the year just to enjoy looking at the moon for two. It's exactly what she intends to do when she heads to the Catskills for vacation with a sharp outfit and nifty new hat.

Plot takes a back seat to enjoyment as director Alfred Santell lets the romance and humor unfold in a leisurely manner. It is not slow, however, and thanks to those great RKO sets and a nice score from Roy Webb everything is just right. Perhaps with a different cast this would be forgettable, but the two leads make it more than it has any right to be.

Douglas Fairbanks Jr. is his usual charming self as Chick, a worker at the resort Teddy eventually falls for after a rocky start. Red Skelon provides the humor as Camp Kare-Free's social director. An excellent supporting cast including Peggy Conklin, Eve Arden, Donald Meek, Lee Bowman, Lucille Ball, and Jack Carson as Teddy's ex-boyfriend.

Rogers is terrific here as a nice working girl who would rather play backgammon than fool around, at least until she gets Chick to wise up and realize love is more important than money. This is a nice find for Ginger's many fans who will enjoy watching her in this humorous romance from the mid-1930's. Skelton is actually billed here as Richard! A must own for Ginger's fans.",1251849600,11,1727,4.6524590163934425
8370784,1,B002IC1ETE,"Truly awful and not worth viewing.  This is a harsh, brittle, empty comedy with unlikeable characters and an unpleasant situation.  Ginger Rogers and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. do their best with an awkward script that has them bristling at every imagined insult and walking off in a huff at every turn.  The camp itself gave me claustrophobia, filled as it was with a mob (literally) of men and women all stampeding from event to event, making as much noise as possible, all of the single men and women seeking to hook up as quickly as possible with someone in desperation.  Lucille Ball is obnoxious as a man-hungry idiot who can't stop talking.  Red Skelton is just painful to watch as the camp entertainer.  The plot is thin and obvious: boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy and girl come together in the end.  Don't waste your time.  I sent my copy back for a refund!",1503100800,,866,4.577922077922078

8370787,5,B002IC1ETE,Once again I like Douglas Fairbanks Jr. movies most of what I have seen.  This movie was delivered exactly as predicted even though I live in Canada.  The packaging was excellent.  The movie was in good condition even better than Love is a Racket.  I am so glad that Amazon is able to come up with these great movies.  I am hoping that some of Douglas Fairbanks Jr. earlier movies such as I like your Nerve will be available which I would buy immediately.  Ginger Roger and Lucille Ball was also very good.  Douglas Fairbanks Jr. looks is different in just about every movie I have seen. Sometimes he has a lot of hair with a mustache or hair is slicked back with no mustache and either bushy eyebrows or very little eyebrows which makes him very interesting.  His acting is also very exciting and different.  I recommend this movie because it is a light hearted romantic comedy making it a relaxing and entertaining movie.,1488326400,2,923,4.545454545454546

8370791,3,B002IC1ETE,"When was the last time you got a postcard? Remember what vacationers used to write on them? ""Having wonderful time!"" they'd scribble. Anyway, this is a flimsy romantic comedy that RKO released in 1938. It has a running time of 70 minutes which means it doesn't wear out its welcome. For Ginger Rogers, this movie presented another chance to break away from her musicals with Fred Astaire, to get away from being typecast as just a hoofer.

It's sketchily based on the play by Arthur Kober, except that the Hays Office determined that the play - revolving around Eastern Jews at play in the Borscht Belt - wouldn't translate so well to cinema seeing as how the material was too skewed towards a specific demographic. The Hays Office was also concerned that, should the film stay faithful to the play, it may trigger a rash of anti-semitism. Whatever. All the Jewish content was taken out, and Having Wonderful Time became a loopy romantic romp for young Gentiles of the lower middle class persuasion.

So, here's Thelma ""Teddy"" Shaw (Rogers), typist from the Bronx, embarking on her two-week jaunt to a resort in the Catskills. Some background on Teddy: She dwells in cramped quarters with all sorts of rambunctious family members, so you can imagine how she just can't wait to get away for fresh air and for some peace and quiet. Teddy has a good mind even if she never went to college. She's reading books all the time to improve herself. She admits she's a bluff, which makes it easier to condone her putting on airs when she's out in public. Except, in Camp Kare-Free, she shouldn't have done it in front of Chick.

Chick Kirkland (Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.) is a law student who moonlights as a waiter at the resort to pay off law school. And, brother, does he have a chip on his shoulders. You can see why Teddy's snooty attitude doesn't sit well with him. Teddy and Chick get off on the wrong foot. And you know what that means. Camp Kare-Free presents all sorts of fun activities for its clientele: canoeing, hiking, horseback riding, badminton, late night dancing, and, uh, Japanese fiestas. And lots of canoodling. Right, Teddy and Chick?

Rogers and Fairbanks, Jr. work well together, but there's only so much acting you could invest in such pedestrian plotting. Still, I got a kick out of the two leads' biting banter, that is, until that turn when they inevitably get all swoony about each other. They're backed by a swell supporting cast, notably Lucille Ball, Eve Arden, and Jack Carson, with all of whom Rogers co-starred in Stage Door. Making his film debut is Red Skelton who plays the camp's madcap social director. Do you enjoy Skelton's brand of comic mugging and physical shtick? They you'll be giggling like mad because he goes into his ""how to dunk a donut"" and ""how to walk up and down the steps"" routines. Overall, I had fun watching Having Wonderful Time for the lightweight stuff that it was, and I liked looking at the location shots of Big Bear. But, honestly, I found the movie interesting more for the behind-the-scenes details, for how it was so significantly tweaked from the play. Well, that's the Hays Office for ya. Ain't censorship grand?",1440460800,3,3172,4.7202166064981945
8370792,4,B002IC1ETE,"This is a pretty good little film, but don't use the cover as a guide.  It is not really a comedy, it is more a romance film with some funny moments.  There are nice little surprises like usual second banana Lee Bowman as the cad and early Lucille Ball and Jack Carson in support roles.  The one miss is the early scenes of Red Skelton who would go on to much funnier material in coming films.  Ginger & Fairbanks make a nice pair though and if you like old romantic comedies, you'll like this one.",1423180800,4,498,4.2105263157894735
8370793,5,B002IC1ETE,"Light and breezy, Ginger Rogers and Doug Fairbanks Jr. deliver in this charming little film about an attractive girl getting away from the hot city and workaday 9 to 5 routine to spend several weeks at a summer camp full of outdoor activities. Doulas Fairbanks is one of the camp waiters expected to entertain the female visitors when he isn't serving up the meals. I love the scene where Ginger and Buzzy ( Lee Bowman) are playing Backgammon in his cabin and Douglas Fairbanks bursts through the door like an
Action Figure expecting to find Ginger and Buzzy locked in an embrace! Very funny. Look for some  stars as characters such as Red Skelton (as the camp clown) and Eve Arden and Lucille Ball as two of Ginger's cabin buddies. Fast moving and very entertaining film.",1413763200,6,772,4.676470588235294
