3481616,4,B001B3LIQU,"A review for those who have never seen the show: These are the French (picture a cafe favored by the occupying Germans in a small French town) and over there in the dark, scheming to foil the Germans are the French resistance. The ONLY problem is that the resistance can't seem to accomplish anything without help, and that help is conveniently sought from the town's cafe owner. This character is a Lou Costello sort of fellow, but with considerably more intelligence; nevertheless, not enough to extricate himself out of the crazy schemes dreamt up by the French resistance leader. This is the plot of the show. Picture an ensemble Laurel and Hardy task-based sitcom wherein the caricatured players are stealing/concealing/and playing hot potato with paintings to sell after the war; and are fashioning schemes (in a more adult manner, but reminiscent of the American classic rerun ""Gilligan's Island"") to return 2 airmen that were forced to bail out of their plane and dropped into this town, back to England. The series is known for it's tag lines; think of The Honeymooners ""Bang Zoom""/""I've got a BIG mouth""/etc, ""Yes Minister""(from that eponymously named Britcom), & ""I know nothing"" (from Hogan's Heroes, a show which is more similar to 'Allo 'Allo than not), and multiply by 10. In addition, it's full of innuendo and farcical stereotypes, but remains unoffensive and amusing...as well as being addictively likable. Do give this Britcom a try if any of the above makes sense and seems at all appealing to you. I hope I have given you a feel whether this may be so or not in your individual case. Cheers!",1241049600,7,1612,4.886861313868613
3481617,5,B001B3LIQU,"From the creators of the venerable British sitcom ""Are You Being Served?"" comes this 85-episode collection: the continuing adventures of ""humble cafe owner"" Rene Artois (Gorden Kaye), who is constantly dragooned into aiding the desperate efforts of Resistance fighters against the Nazis in wartime France. Like ""Are You Being Served?,"" the scripts are full of double entendres, single entendres, farcical pursuits and intrigues, crazy comedy props, and plenty of verbal and visual jokes, delivered by a solid ensemble cast. In the many bawdy situations where a broader comedian would mug shamelessly, Gorden Kaye's sheepish subtlety scores every time.

This is a serial, so the episodes must be watched in sequence to follow the insane storyline. Among the plot points running through the series are a frenzied hunt for a missing painting, the equally frenzied concealment of two clueless British airmen, pompous posturing by military officers and Gestapo spies, the tunneling INTO a prisoner-of-war camp, clandestine romances forced upon Rene by anyone in skirts (even the Resistance girls can't resist Rene, and one of the German officers has eyes for him, too), everybody adopting cross-dressing disguises at one time or another, and any number of wild schemes to harass and hinder German battle plans, involving ridiculous and ingeniously engineered props.

This viewer had seen the first three dozen episodes on public television before the station discontinued the series, so it was great to see so many more episodes. This 19-disc collection presents all 85 half-hours, and there isn't a lemon in the bunch. Even when the jokes are predictable, it's the reactions of the various characters that often carry the comedy. The series survived many personnel changes on both sides of the cameras, and viewers will probably become fans who will find their own favorite characters and portrayals.

There are many ""Allo, Allo""-related bonus features in the DVD set, including an episode of ""Blankety Blank"" (the British ""Match Game"") and a documentary about the series as a whole (on disc 16 -- DON'T watch it until you've seen all 19 discs, because the documentary gives the series' ending away).

Highly recommended for comedy fans, and delightfully habit-forming viewing: we enjoyed watching an episode almost every night for three months.",1237766400,76,2341,5.353260869565218

3481639,5,B001B3LIQU,"A surprisingly large box set! Nine Seasons and 19 disks! This show, created by Jeremy Lloyd and David Croft, the creators of ""Are You Being Served?"" is centered on a cafe run by Rene, his shrewish wife, and his sexy barmaids who double as prostitutes during the German occupation of France. He is bedeviled by the resistance, Nazi SS officers with fetishes, the regular German soldiers who only want to avoid the Eastern Front and stay alive and well fed, and the incompetent English who run downed airmen through his village. Rene also likes to chase the barmaids and line his pockets with whatever he can get, including a very famous painting that the Nazis are looking for. Lots of innuendo, double entendre and slapstick humour make this a very funny set to own. If you loved ""AYBS?"", you'll love 'Allo 'Allo!",1457136000,4,813,4.732394366197183

3481685,5,B001B3LIQU,"This is one of the best series of shows, ever! If you don't laugh while watching it, you have no sense of humor. It is quick, smart, and so well performed.  Not only is this show amusing, but the characters are so lovable, so down to earth, that they, in time, begin to feel like part of your family, or maybe you become part of theirs.  I can't say enough good things about ALLO-ALLO!  It's thee best!",1423699200,,402,4.194805194805195
3481686,4,B001B3LIQU,"Where to start?  ""Allo Allo"" is the very peak of farce comedy chock full of raunchy set-ups, ridiculous plots, over-the-top characters and all manner of quintessential British humor.  Coming on the heels of ""Are You Being Served?"", ""Allo, Allo"" ensures that Croft and Lloyd's particular brand of farcical humor leaden with sexual innuendo carries on into the 1980s and early 90s.
A concise summary of this long running show is that Rene Artois (Gorden Kaye) is a cafe owner in a small, Nazi-occupied French town who is trying to get through the war and live a simple life with his musical but off-key wife Edith (Carmen Silvera), while having an affair with both of his sexy waitresses (played for laughs again and again), but he has to constantly help the French Resistance and their hair-brained schemes to smuggle the same two British airmen back to Britain.  And he has to stay on good terms with the occupying Nazis and resident Gestapo officers who are regular customers in his cafe and often turn to him for help in their own madcap schemes that often are the opposite of what the Resistance wants.
When I first saw ""Allo Allo"" (the name, incidentally, comes from the affected French accent the British actors adopt when speaking ""Hello, hello""), I couldn't imagine laughing at Nazis.  But the expert duo of Jeremy Lloyd and David Croft handle the wartime setting with a brilliant lightness of touch.  Frankly so much silliness happens that you almost forget there's a war on.
Having said all that, this is probably the most convoluted, populated British sitcom you'll ever see!  Unusually for a British sitcom, there are many, MANY recurring plots, involving infidelity, sabotage, cross-dressing (oh yes... MUCH cross-dressing!), double-dealing, sausages, priceless paintings, farcical espionage, and bad singing!  It feels like there are thousands of characters, each with their own oft-repeated catch-phrase.  Like their other masterpiece ""Are You Being Served?"" Croft and Lloyd's characters don't develop beyond making us laugh with silly situations.  If this weren't a farce the entire premise could have been an interesting war-time thriller movie (a genre of film that Croft and Lloyd drew from for inspiration for this sitcom).  Rene, his family and staff, the French Resistance girls, the Nazis, and a few other townspeople live in a microcosm of the war, but with lots of sexual innuendo and outrageous schemes.  The show is at it's best from series 1 through 5.  The unusually long fifth series (26 episodes compared to the British standard 6 to 12!) is where the show peaks in quality and humor.  After series 5, the situations begin to feel a little repetitious and meaningless and you start to wonder when the war will end for our brave Rene and the other cast members.  The ending of the show is a little anti-climactic and too long in coming but a logical end to a program that followed it's own brand of logic in the midst of one of the worst global conflicts in history.
I think I am the wrong age to start watching ""Allo Allo"".  If I was a kid I probably wouldn't be able to breathe for all my laughter.  This is still a pretty good farce that is guaranteed to tickle any one up for a good sausage joke!",1423180800,2,3229,4.843636363636364
3481687,5,B001B3LIQU,"I keep watching them over every now & then... The author used names from real characters that live during ww2 but with a twist.

And this is years ago in the UK - just think what it must be like there now....  If you saw the sitcom you know that it was one of the best, most beloved Brit sitcoms of its time.

3481802,1,B001B3LIQU,"`Allo `Allo is one of my favorite Britcoms and I was thrilled to see it available at 50% off from Amazon. The show is wonderfully written and the actors are way over-the-top brilliant. The quality of the show deserves 5 stars, the quality of this set deserves -5 stars. Every disc in the set was scratched, some beyond belief. A case was broken, 2 discs wouldn`t play. I quickly received a replacement set from Amazon, and the discs in that set were in worse shape than the original set I received. Don`t avoid the show itself, it`s British comedy at it`s finest, but you could probably find a used set in a video store that is ten years old that will be in better condition. My worst purchase form Amazon, EVER !!!!

Update: I have received a THIRD replacemnet set and for the THIRD time Series 5, Part 2, Disc 2, Episode 3, An Enigma Variation will not play properly. The final chapter and end credits break up and pixilate and takes about 20 minutes to slog through the final 8 minutes of the episode. BBC Video made the set, so it`s their crap product, but obviously Amazon`s inventory of `ALLO `ALLO is crap as well. I wish I could have enjoyed 85 episodes on 19 discs, but waiting to see what would be screwed up next took all the plaeasure out of watching the show. Can`t wait to see how messed up To the Manor Born, Keeping Up Appearances, Are You Being Served?, and Are You being Served Again? are, all of which I ordered at the same time.

3481821,5,B001B3LIQU,"'Allo 'Allo was ranked #13 in the list of best Britcoms.  I think it should be number one.  The humor is anarchic and surreal, with jokes building on jokes, gags building gags; the verbal pyrotechnics in the episodes sometimes require two of three viewings to catch all the jokes.  There are references to pop culture that range from the subtle to the subtle as a pile-driver.  Sometimes the writers will take an entire episode to set up a single joke (see Klinkerhoffen in Control for one example).  Other times, they rely on cheap gags - absurd costumes, silly accents, funny walks (almost every episode).  The cast is clearly in on the jokes and having the time of their lives.

So what's the deal?

'Allo 'Allo is one of the very few successful sitcoms to use a serialized format.  Episode one sets up the basic plot which subsequent episodes follow.  We're in war torn France in about 1940 or 1941.  We're in the town of Nouvion, the Cafe Rene, owned by Rene Artois and his wife Edith.  They are roped into helping the French Resistance as well as the occupying Germans.  The Germans are trying to steal and hide valuable paintings for after the war, the resistance are trying to help English airmen who are shot down return to England.  Rene is having affairs with is waitresses.  A frequent gag is that the various parties (German army, Gestapo, Resistance, Rene and co.) come up with elaborate schemes which end up cancelling each other out.

The characters are broadly drawn stereotypes the French are amorous, the Germans kinky, the Italians cowardly and egotistical, the English are loud and bumbling.  Everyone is greedy.  No one believes much in anything other than helping themselves.

Starting with episode one, we get a series of interconnected plots the unfold over the course of 9 seasons and 85 episodes.

Season one has 9 episodes including the pilot.  It's funny but the ball doesn't really get rolling till season two, which has six episodes and a special Christmas episode for a total of seven episodes.  In season two, both the creative team and the actors have gotten their groove.  The Christmas episode, Klinkerhoffen in Control, is flat out one of the funniest episodes of TV ever.  A series of chaotic gags unravel as all the characters end up in the cafe with exotic poisons, drugs, bombs and a chicken on the general's helmet.

Season three has six episodes and is the season in which the show reaches its peak, a peak it would retain throughout seasons four and five.  Season four has six episodes and sets up a series of elaborate situations including spy cameras, the introduction of Mimi LaBonq and some of the funniest visual gags in the series.

Season five consists of 26 episodes.  The show had apparently been optioned for American television so the producers creates a then standard American season of 26 episodes.  Season five is without doubt the best season of 'Allo 'Allo.  With the introduction of some new characters and some escape plans for the British airmen that are surreal and absurd, season five fires on all cylinders.  The plots get wildly complex and somehow the whole thing manages to hold together.

Seasons six, seven and eight are a mixed bag.  The magic that made the earlier seasons funny is starting to fade.  Many previously funny gags have lost their edge.  Between seasons six and seven there was a long delay while actor Gorden Kaye (Rene) recovered from a serious injury.  The episodes stray a little from the serialized form of earlier seasons with more one-off stand alone episodes in which a plot is conceived and fails and the broader storyline is barely mentioned.  There are still good laughs but it feels as if the show is running out of gas.

The final season, season 9, has a sentimental quality for me and I still watch it, but the laughs are fewer and further between and the jokes aren't carefully constructed.  There are still silly accents and funny costumes and the situations are still as outrageous but the spark isn't there anymore.  However, I dare anyone to watch the final episode without a feeling of gentle comradeship with the characters and a sense that something wonderful has ended.

My summary is simple.  'Allo 'Allo is a personal favorite Britcom.  I've seen some of these episodes so many times I can recite the dialogue and I can still watch them.  The earlier seasons are manic, madcap no holds barred television.  The later episodes have a wonderfully surreal British sense of humor.  The whole series is a laugh out loud classic.

No-seriously-youv'e just got to! That's an order. The British have far more leeway in their scripts and they get away with murder. My father would have loved this series. He was in the German Army and had a great sense of humour. He told me his job was special courier to France taking messages back and forth,but mostly bringing wicker baskets back from France filled with wine. If there were no message,he just went for the wine. He never carried a gun and they paid him in ration tickets which he gave to my Jewish mother. Good thing they never found that out. ""allo ""allo?

I always try to buy DVDs and Blu-rays with subtitles and/or closed-captions.  Contrary to the item description on Amazon AND on the actual box for this comedy series, however, there were NO subtitles OR closed-captions...at least not on the set I received.  Also, picture quality was quite poor, even when played on an up-scaling blu-ray player!  Very dark.  IMO, without subtitles or closed-captions, the set isn't worth it.

In addition, each season is separately enclosed in a regular DVD case, and all cases are enclosed in a HUGE cardboard box with a flip-top lid, taking up an inordinate amount of shelf space!

3481912,5,B001B3LIQU,"""Allo Allo!"" Has been around since 1982 and has just recently become available in the USA on a decent media. This particular set contains series one through series six. Each containing approximately eight episodes:

""The British are Coming"" starts the series and explains many things that happen later in the series.

""The Fallen Madonna"" with the big whatever, will set a reoccurring theme as Colonel Kurk von Strom has pilfered the painting for his retirement. Keep your eye on it through the series as it becomes a shell game.

The basic story is that of a caf&eacute; owner Ren&eacute;; this is in France during the WWII German occupation. He must balance dealing with the local Germans, the Gestapo, the good Resistance, the commie Resistance, having affairs with his female help, dealing with his wife and mother-in-law. Throw in some downed British airmen and some onion soup.
I will not go though each series in detail because for those that have not seen it or if it has been while since viewing the series, the surprise factor and the one liners are worth discovering first hand.

I will say that the highlight for me in the first series was when they mistakenly fed grain laced with nitro glycerin to the chickens.

One nice thing about this series is that they place the name next to the actor at the end of each episode. Most of the actors are well known out side of this series. I was shocked however to find that Gestapo Herr Otto Flick (Richard Gibson) Played British Capt. Newman in Ken Follett's ""The Key to Rebecca"" (1985) and completely changed his accent.

But not as Michelle of the Resistance has recruited him and his caf for an escape Route for two extremely stupid British Airmen Fairfax and Carstairs. On top of trying to avoid his horrible wife Rene is passionately having affairs with local women and his waitresses. (Mainly Yvette). Yvette is Rene's only love and has vowed onto her to marry her once the war is ended. With the Germans the regular customers and a crazy Gestapo officer Herr Flick in suspicion of the Caf and him. Will Rene and Yvette get a happily ever after or will his suspicious wife tear the two lovers apart forever? A love story that is told through a comedy. Watch and see.

Facts: Vicki Michelle (Yvette) was pregnant with her daughter when filming the series.
