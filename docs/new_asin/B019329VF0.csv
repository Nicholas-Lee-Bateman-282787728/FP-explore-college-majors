7562006,5,B019329VF0,"Despite over 2 hours of commercials spread over 3 nights this was a great mini series with emotion, heart and human trials. The story is somewhat believable minus the devil-like aliens. the only thing missing was a pitch fork! The story goes as a far advanced peaceful alien race comes to earth to rid us of all the negativity of humanity and their destructiveness. Of course the full onslaught of ""the human factor"" is splendidly exposed, the hostility, corruptness, evil and destructive ways, arrogance, ect.,  I love how the aliens just  instantly put a stop to it all and the savage humans are forced to comply. The story revolves around a torn man who lost his wife to cancer who just happens to be chosen to speak on behalf of the overlords. The aliens give humans 30 years of peace and bliss, but all good things must come to an end as the overlords reveal..This movie has lots of heart and draws you into the human/alien saga. I look forward to watching it all without falling asleep during the long commercial breaks sy fy is known for.",1451174400,4,1045,4.5828877005347595
7562007,5,B019329VF0,"Yes it was everything you would expect from a science fiction / fantasy/ it-could-happen- movie. And there were many commercials, More than usual. They knew this TV movie would draw in the max of viewers, and what a better way to sell cough medicine or a brand new car, than from someone watching a movie of the end of mankind. The world can't end if you're sick with the sniffles or in search of a new car. It's just a movie..Now what if there were no commercials or reality checks? Another War of the Worlds reaction. This movie could make your reality a little off set...thank you , commercials for keeping us safe in our real world. Buy the dvd, it's a keeper. But for goodness sakes, take time out for a reality check.",1451088000,2,723,4.402985074626866
7562008,3,B019329VF0,"...because its 3-day Stateside premiere for a total of 6 hours amounted to just shy of an hour of actual viewing thanks in very large part to effectively interminable commercial interruptions, some of which at least on the first night included previews of scenes AFTER the pertinent commercial break that I could only imagine was a new wrinkle on the ""Please Stay Tuned"" pitch. And...because I like the source novel far too much to pass judgment on its long-awaited adaptation without having endured the latter from start to finish. I guess you can call this being fair though I recognize this review is for a Blu-ray that hasn't yet been issued. Here's hoping...the 3-star review might just as well be an E for Effort...and you BET I'll revisit this review afterwards.

7562011,2,B019329VF0,"Has pretty good special effects (all Sci-Fi movies in the 21st-century MUST have good visual effects).  Aside from that, I found relatively little fidelity to Clarke's story except for the beginning, and the ending.  The actor, Charles Dance, as ""Karellen"", gave the best performance in this oddly disjointed attempt to bring Clarke's novel to TV.

As has been noted in other reviews, the number of commercials that were stuffed and crammed into the three-night presentation on TV was astounding!  At least if you buy the DVD you won't have to suffer through all THAT!",1450569600,19,568,5.01063829787234

Of course, on tv, in took three 2 hour shots over 3 nights with what seems like 2 hours of commercials injected.  I'll be happy to get my hands on the dvd so I can view it in one uninterrupted sitting.  That being said, I felt that the movie did justice to the main theme of the book, it was well acted and well directed.  The special effects were really good, much better than I was expecting, after all, this was the SyFy channel, not Universal or Paramount.  It did not follow the book exactly, but it certainly did justice to Arthur C Clark, I think he would have been proud of this.

7562022,4,B019329VF0,"I watched this without having read the book.  It was an enjoyable movie, reasonably good acting, and I watched the entire thing in two sittings without getting bored.  Having said that, I got to the end and was a bit confused by the storytelling.  I sat there for a bit thinking about it, and went, ""Hunh?  What?  I don't get it.""

Then I read the book.  So much better (which is to be expected from Arthur C. Clarke).  My biggest complaint with the movie is that some of the most noticeable changes did not enhance the storytelling.  If the writers were going to digress from the book, it should have been to make things more clear, not less.  They confused things and muddled what exactly was going on throughout the entire tale.  I'm tempted to give this three stars based on that, but it didn't detract from the movie so greatly that I'll do that.  I will say that if you've read the book, you may not like what I see as the predominant changes in the story.",1508284800,,962,4.342696629213483
7562023,5,B019329VF0,"Really a fine job on this.  Yes,  it is a tv miniseries, so dosen't have the $200 million budget.  And, it is from one of the greatest sci fi books ever written, by Arthur C. Clarke, up there with his 2001 Space Odyssey.  People can quibble over the production details, but I believe they did well.  And some of the scenes, especially with the Overlords, are incredible!  The opening scene where giant mothership spaceships hover over the largest cities on Earth, was used to open the film Independence Day, which was obviously popcorn entertainment film.

7562031,3,B019329VF0,"There's three episodes which each go for around an hour twenty minutes. The first episode is really good, but really the rest could have been condensed to about twenty minutes or so, you just get bored with the second and third, only sticking with it as you're expecting some sort of payoff.  This is one of those TV shows where they like to have a spoiler scene for the end of the series at the start of the first episode, which means you know what's going to happen.  Basically aliens invade earth grounding all planes, when they arrive, which did look kind of cool, and no doubt there would be idiots just looking up at something coming slowly down about to crush them rather than get out the way, as we have with episode one.  The aliens' message appears through the appearance of deceased people, through the voice of Charles Dance (Tywin Lannister - Game of Thrones) tells them they have nothing to fear, it comes in peace and will bring peace, end hunger, pollution and everything bad we humans like to do.  It summons an inbetween, and chooses a farmer played by Mike Vogel because it liked it his performance as Barbie in Under the Dome or something like that.  The aliens refuses to meet him or anyone else in the flesh though, but brings him to the mothership on a Flight of the Navigator type spaceship after destroying his house to make him get on board.  As most seem quite happy about the aliens inclusion into our world and the benefits they have brought, a few such as newspaper tycoon played by Hell on Wheels' Colm Meaney who has labelled them The Overlords, points out that pigs on farms are really well looked after and have a great time and even willingly get on the truck go to the abattoirs to be slaughtered.

For me I just didn't find the final two episodes to be that great at all.  The reveal of what the aliens looked like was really the impact of the TV show, that was well done, but that happened at the end of the first episode.  I haven't read Clarke's novel from 1953, and I imagine in times before man had even gone to space this sort of novel would have had much more of an impact.  But aspects such as America's navy since it has nothing else to do ending Eastern African hunger by shipping food, might have been believable back then when most ships had been sunk less than a decade earlier in World War II and big ships were probably a rarity, but not today.  If conflict was ended, that's your main problem, the food already goes there today, it's just kept by warlords and corrupt parts of the government who sell it to the people who need it and should be getting it for free. I found the ending to be disappointing, especially since we already knew what was coming from the spoiler scene at the start of episode one.  But I was looking forward to seeing the aliens' planet and what their cities are like.  We don't see them at all.  It made no sense as to why they would have brought the human back anyway, wasting 80 years of their alien lives flying him back here together with their own return journey.

Fans of Orange is the New Black might get something out of the final two episodes by seeing Yael Stone (Lorna Morello) with a really bad fringe haircut but that's about it for the final two episodes.",1492819200,,3248,4.39

7562041,2,B019329VF0,"I suppose it was in my junior high school years that an uncle of mine who went on to a very decent career waxed enthusiastic about the book.  If I read it, it has left no discernible impression on me.  These comments refer to the DVD, which I stayed with, over a period of two days, to the end.  I was reminded of soap opera in the sense of a choppy development with a lot of reaction shots soaked in sometimes bombastic music.  The candy part is Dance as supervising overlord.  I might be more impressed with his appearance than others that have spent more time watching similar fare.  Still, I think that character will stay with people; 'it has some depth'. The other actors do their best, but we are not in the company of people who are expressing themselves freely, but are reactors to what might be an existential threat. The roots of our Christian tradition picture a creator God who will bring about a new heaven and earth, while at the same time allowing for free will.  That could be characterized as a conjecture, so one can compare it to the notion unspooling here.  In doing so one might find oneself reflecting on what the piper costs.
I suspect the film was padded out in hopes of recouping it's cost which for Syfy was probably high.  So, diluted product.  Sci-fi genre fans might be more supportive. I sought this out and stayed with it to the end; give the dealer credit.",1483833600,,1389,4.433070866141732
7562042,2,B019329VF0,"Some truly elegant reviews have been attached to this miniseries, so I won't go into great lengths to express my feelings about the program. Like some others, it's been about 40 years since I read the book, which I considered to be one of the greatest science-fiction novels I ever read.  How it holds up I'll find out in the next few weeks , as I finish re-reading the book again.  I purchased this mini series on DVD, unseen, with high hopes. What I feel is that the first two parts are terrifically well done - suspenseful and well acted.  The final third of the miniseries, however, seems rushed and ill-thought out. You'll walk away from this with more questions than answers.  The build up from the first two parts seems to peter out and flatten into some quasi- psycho babble ending. Extremely unsatisfying, after having already invested almost 5+ hours of viewing time, only to walk away in disgust. To quote Peggy Lee's famous tune, ""Is That All There Is ?""  Final thought-it's not enough to have a film saturated with endless CGI effects, if there's no decent script to support them.",1483660800,9,1093,4.642487046632124

7562051,1,B019329VF0,"Just stopped  watching ""Childhood's End"" released by the SyFy Channel.
Arthur C. Clarke's brilliant and classic novel of the evolution of humanity after Earth is taken over by alien Overlords didn't need the contemporary update that the powers-that-be at the SyFy Channel decided it needed in order to be a ratings blockbuster for the network.
Instead, the SyFy Channel decided to turn a classic science fiction novel into a Pro-Palestinian Propaganda Hit Piece against Israel.
Shame on the SyFy Channel and shame on anyone who watches this thinly disguised anti-Semitic claptrap that is masquerading as ""entertainment.""
NOT RECOMMENDED!
ZERO STARS!",1480636800,,649,5.49
7562052,3,B019329VF0,"What happens if a truly benign alien race arrives and stops war, poverty, disease and hunger in a single stroke? All without violence or revealing their appearance? Space exploration is stopped and scientific advancement re-channeled into planetary improvement so we can ""catch up"" with our abilities--or is there another reason? No cliche' aliens that want to eat us, enslave us, strip mine the planet or are hot for Earth women. Just a powerful and wise alien race that knows more about mankind than we know about ourselves.

Childhood's End is possibly the finest, most entertaining science fiction story ever written. In some ways reminiscent of Clarke's 2001: A Space Odyssey, this movie spans decades and presents a future for the human race that is both terrifying and fulfilling.

Unfortunately the movie falls flat, especially in the second half when compared to the book. One HUGE clinker was when Karellen wacks the street punk. The whole idea/philosophy with the aliens is that they don't kill or use violence. Also, the book spans decades/centuries, but the movie seems to wrap up relatively quickly and sidesteps important character and sociological developments as humanity matures. It simply loses the grand sweep of the story. I have no desire to watch this movie again.",1480118400,,1287,5.15311004784689
7562053,3,B019329VF0,"Hollywood has been trying to adapt ""Childhood's End"" for 40 years unsuccessfully. The narrative seemed to stymie every screenwriter and director who tackled the material (given Harlan Ellison's excellent adaptation of Issac Asimov's ""I Robot""--no not the movie with Will Smith-- there was at least one person that could have done it successfully if he had been asked) with its sprawling narrative. When I heard that the Syfy channel was goi g to adapt it, I was skeptical. While they had done a decent job with ""Dune"" and, at first ""Battlestar Galatica"" before they screwed that pooch (by messing with Ronald D. Moore's narrative plan), ""Farscape"" (where they screwed fans by cancelling the show before its conclusion), those successes were few and far between and many of their other attempts were wane at best.

Sadly other writers ripped off Clarke for years taking elements of the ideas here but turning them into more traditional storylines lacking Clarke's vision.

Although not perfect, ""Childhood's End"" does a good, credible job of presenting Clarke's vision (altered of course). Aliens travel to Earth but haven't given us a clue as to why they are here beyond the fact that they want to help humanity to achieve a utopia but never reveal what their endgame is or what they expect from humanity.

Some episodes work better than others and the set up in the first episode where Ricky Stormgren (he's chosen as their emissary to humanity) meets the aliens (without seeing them) for the first time Nd the scenes where their ship disassembles his house to find him and then puts it back together again is well executed and inspired. When Ricky does eventually see the aliens it becomes very clear WHY they didn't intially reveal to humanity.

The production values are quite good for the show although it's clear that they were working with a limited budget for the show.

The transfer of the show looks quite nice in high definition. Given that the show was shot with high def video cameras, that's not a surprise but it doesn't have that video quality often looking quite film like in its presentation.

The audio is quite immersive and quite good as well.

The only special features are deleted scenes and that's too bad as the show would have benefited from a commentary track discussing why they made some of the choices they did to tell the story and a featurette on the long, torturous road to making a show that had been stuck in development hell since ""2001: A Space Odyssey""

There is plenty of opposition, dealt with handily and without violence.  There is also an interesting relationship between a spokesman and the alien chief, Karrelan, whose shocking appearance remains hidden until the end of the first segment.  All the while, what is really happening remains a delicious and threatening mystery, revealed at the end as an awe-inspiring development.

Thinking back to my experience with the novel, I believe that this version makes explicit many fundamental details that remained unexplained in the book.  The series interprets them for the viewer and it strips it of some subtlety and nuance, which I regret.  But overall, this is very fun and thought provoking.",1474156800,14,1237,5.145

If they did that right and didn't wimp out I could forgive a lot. They didn't. If you haven't read the book yet I suggest you do to see what I'm driving at without giving any detail away. I found Part III almost unwatchable because I knew what was coming. It was, to say the least, a gut-wrenching experience for me. But I found it well worth my time. There is a warning though for people of the Christian faith (as I am): the theory of evolution is the driving force of this movie (hence the title) and the appearance of Karellen (as it is in the book) is played as a mockery of Christian doctrine. Clarke meant it that way. Sure he's playing with symbolism but it's quite clear what he thinks about religion, and Christianity specifically.

7562098,2,B019329VF0,"Let's dispense with a few of the obvious points.  Childhood's End is one of the great science fiction books.  And yes the story needed to be updated for this century -- written in 1953, the 1970s (when much of the story transpired) were the future to AC Clarke.  Having said that, excessive liberties were taken in this production.  Entirely new characters were invented, often with political agendas absent from Clarke's book.  For example, a religious zealot was introduced who committed an act not remotely in the original.  (Can we guess the actual religion of this violent character?  Hint: this is a politically correct production.)  Also, the producers must have concluded there were not enough women in the book; hence Stormgren has not one, but two wives. (One deceased that is a ridiculous plot device.)

Clark's book was a spare, thought provoking work.  This production worked in many extraneous issues -- hunger (the solution was laughable) and homelessness, to name just two -- that muddled and distracted the viewer from the central theme of the work.",1460764800,,1066,5.04
7562099,1,B019329VF0,"Like probably all Arthur C. Clarke fans, I was thrilled when I heard that Childhoods End was coming to the screen. I was skeptical when I learned that SyFy was doing it, as they don't exactly have the best record of producing quality materialbut hey, how badly can you screw up one of the greatest classics in the history of science fiction?

I underestimated SyFys ability to destroy a science fiction masterpiece.

I expected it to be a disappointment; face it, no movie, especially a TV movie, can possibly match the beautiful prose of Arthur C. Clarke.
But holy almighty monolith, I didn't in my wildest nightmares expect it to be THAT bad!! I thought there was no possible way it could be a worse corruption of Clarke's magnificence than Trapped in Space, but yep, congratulations, ""SyFy,"" you made a WORSE movie!

As with other ""SyFy"" outings, this tried hard to bury all science fiction elements. Oh, there were, by necessity, a few token shots of the Overlord ships (which were quite disappointing, especially after we've seen such impressive variants as the Visitor motherships in V), but other than that they just turned it into another dull Earth-based drama.

Why to they have to mess around and make things ""relevant"" to the modern world? A classic is a classic because it's AWAYS relevant. If Childhood's End is no longer relevant, why in Diaspar make a movie of it in the first place?!

Yes, Clarke's novel discussed the human condition--specifically, how to make it better. But fundamentally it was about the scope of the universe, the fact that we might not be alone, the possible nature of extraterrestrial beings. It hammered home the smallness of our little planet and the immensity of the universe. This small-minded miniseries puts Earth and its problems at center stage, with the Overlords just a vehicle for modern-day social commentary. The kind of lazy, self-congratulatory ""science fiction"" that ""SyFy"" has been handing the brainless masses for years now.

Clarke is renowned for his scientific accuracy and his excellent storytelling skills. Not only Childhood's End, but ALL his books and short stories are extremely well-paced. Clarke wastes no time. Five pages into Rendezvous With Rama, you're at Rama. The moonbus Selene plunges into the Sea of Dust within two chapters of the start of A Fall of Moondust. The Sands of Mars, Earthlight, The Songs of Distant Earth, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Against the Fall of Night, The Hammer of God, all grab you by the scruff of the neck and race you through an incredible journey of sights and sounds and feelings that leave you breathless at the end. Childhood's End is no exception; the Overlords arrive like a thunderclap in the book's prologue, and in Chapter 1 we're already deep into the unfolding cosmic drama.

This plodding miniseries just limps along--well, how else do you turn a 218-page novel into a three-part miniseries?--wasting time with endless montages, reaction shots, and boring dialogue, filled with constant, irritating, unpleasant, buzzing music.

And why is it that the idiots making filmed sci-fi these days seem to think we've reached the absolute apex of fashion, and everyone in the universe from now until the end of time will be dressing the way we do today?

Oh, and by the way, the blu-ray is very difficult to navigate. I don't know what all those little symbols mean. Whats wrong with labeling them play all, episodes, chapters, and bonus features?

Part 3 was moderately better than parts 1 and 2, because it at least had SOMETHING to do with the book, and we finally got a little bit of science fiction eye candy--though it was a little hard to care at this point. I was truly surprised that we saw Jan Rodricks' trip to the Overlords' planet; I was sure they were going to completely skip it, because putting it on screen requires some imagination and wonder. Granted, what we see on screen falls far, far short of the marvelous vista of the novel, but hey, food to a starving man.

Why is it that they had FOUR HOURS to explore Clarke's ideas and they barely, barely touched the surface of the novel? Why? WHY? Why did we spend interminable periods of characters staring at each other? Why did they introduce that bizarre plotline about Stormgren's illness, that had nothing to do with the story, made no sense, and wasn't in the book?

But I could get so bogged down in the ""why""s that I'll just re-enter my spiral of fury and despair that I was in as I writhed through the entire miniseries. Why? Why? Why? Why the planes falling out of the sky in the beginning? Why all the clouds and smoke around the Overlords' ships? Why the stupid hotel room instead of the small silver chamber where Stormgren met with Karellen in the book? Why make Stormgren a farmer instead of the secretary-general? Why? Why? Why?

Listen. Attention all filmmakers. Arthur C. Clarke is a BETTER STORYTELLER THAN YOU! If you're adapting his work to the screen, let Arthur tell the story! Your job is to find a good cast, build some nice sets, and create some good special effects. But let Arthur lead the way. He knows what he's doing.

Let's look at some screen adaptations of Clarke.

The motion picture 2001: A Space Odyssey and the Twilight Zone episode ""The Star"" are really, really good. Why? Because they stuck with Arthur.

The movie of 2010 was half-good and half-bad. The good stuff comes from Arthur. The bad stuff, they deviated from Arthur.

Now, Trapped in Space and Childhood's End deviated from Arthur, and they sucked!

DON'T DEVIATE FROM ARTHUR! He does it best.

So as far as I'm concerned, Childhood's End has still never been filmed. I'm hoping some filmmaker out there takes the reins and makes a good, spectacular, two-hour film that is a faithful adaptation of Arthur C. Clarke's glorious novel.

On second thought, knowing the way the dipwads in Hollywood film science fiction these days, I hope they just keep their hands off Arthur. If you want to experience Arthur C. Clarke's stories, read them.

It pains me deeply that there are undoubtedly a lot of people who watched that stupid miniseries and assumed that's what the novel is like. Nice job, ""SyFy,"" you turned an entire generation off of Arthur C. Clarke.

On the other hand, anyone who watches ""SyFy"" is probably illiterate, so I guess it doesn't matter.",1460419200,10,6325,4.799448022079117

This movie is the full embodiment of the False Hope that somehow man possesses something in and of himself that will save himself. In this case his children. Childhood's End is a great blashphemy against the True God and his son Jesus Christ. One day the devil will pay for his Deception of men through the use of his minions, other men.

And oh yeah, the devil's minions will pay too.

Man has always wanted to be God. He is Not. And the Devil is not God either. There is only One God, the Father of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Only God our Father is all powerful. Only Jesus Christ his only begotten son is the One And Only True Savior through whom man may choose to have eternal life. There is life through NONE other. If you confess Jesus Christ as your Lord, and believe that God raised Jesus Christ from the dead you become a Christian man or woman, born of incorruptible seed by God's gift of holy spirit which he gives to all Christian men and women. Without the gift of holy spirit man is only body and soul with no chance of eternal life.

There is nothing eternal about the soul or the body. Only God and his son Jesus Christ are eternal. The Devil will get what is coming to him and, Yes, the Devil has an end. A very bad one. And I (as well as all Christian men and women) will be to see that the Devil get's what is coming to him.

I'm soooo looking forward to seeing that.

The second half of the movie jumps the shark, goes off the rails, disappoints.  Over-bubbly familiar love story: not hard science fiction!

7562115,3,B019329VF0,"Childhood's End: A Review of the ScyFy Channel Production of a Classic Novel.
By Dawoud Kringle

There isn't a science fiction aficionado in the English speaking world who is not in awe of Arthur C. Clarke's ""Childhood's End."" The book is, quite literally, one of the greatest and most timeless pieces of literature in a genre wherein the passage of time almost always inflicts ruin upon its own artworks. Clarke assumed the monumental task of reconciling science with religion, and produced an unparalleled masterpiece that stood the test of time.

It hardly bears mentioning that translating a novel to cinema inflicts upon the story inevitable changes. I expected this; but still felt it right to hold ScyFy to rigorous standards.

For me, personally, the book has been a favorite since my early teens. When I learned that the ScyFy channel made it into a TV miniseries, directed by Nick Hurran, I was more than a little intrigued. In fact, I have waited 40 years for this.

Be forewarned: the remainder of this article contains spoilers.

The story is the prototype of the mass invasion from outer space. Without warning, giant spacecrafts enter earth's atmosphere and settle above most of the major cities of the earth. Yet, unlike other such stories, this invasion is a peaceful one. The extraterrestrials, who soon are named the Overlords, bring peace and prosperity to humanity. Humanity are introduced to the leader of the Overlords, and the ""supervisor of earth"" Karellen. Karellen chose a man, Rikki Stormgren to act as spokesman / intercession between humanity and the Overlords. Within less than a decade, war, famine, disease, injustice, oppression, and environmental pollution are eliminated. But for years, the Overlords refused to show themselves to humanity. The side effect of their presence was that all cultural development and scientific research came to a halt. Humanity felt it was futile to pursue knowledge that the Overlords achieved centuries or millennia ago. After some years, Karellen announced that he would show himself to the world. Many people were shocked that the physical appearance of the Overlords was identical to the classic description of the devil (horns, leathery wings, barbed tail, hoofs, etc.). Eventually, after decade of a utopia devoid of any real progress, a group of artists and scientists decided to form their own community, which they called New Athens, and pursue the development of art, science, and culture. The Overlords largely ignored them. One of them, an astrophysicist named Jan Rodricks (Milo Rodricks in the miniseries, played by Osy Ikhile) found a way to stow away on one of the Overlords' ships, and visited their home planet. But then the children all over the world began to exhibit unexplainable behavior. Eventually, it was clear that these children represented the next stage in the evolution of humanity into purely spiritual / mind beings that were to merge with an omnipotent, omniscient universal consciousness (which some interpreted as being God). With this, the rest of humanity would be extinct, because there would never be another child born on earth. Rodricks returned to a barren earth, and witnessed its eventual destruction.

The Hugo Wainwright character, played by Colm Meany, was altered in a number of ways. In the book, he was described as an honest and sincere man who sought humanity's best interest, despite his occasional shortsightedness. In the miniseries, he came across as a fanatic, and eventually a criminal.

Charles Dance did an excellent job in his interpretation of Karellen. His authoritative yet understated British accent was well suited to the character. The makeup / CGI they used on him, and Vindartan (the only other Overlord shown, played by Benedict Hardie) was flawless. The only problem I saw with the miniseries' portrayal of Karellen was that the brilliant dialogue found in the book was not brought to the screen. In the book, everything Karellen said was a statement of superlative genius. This was largely lost in the screenplay.

Hurran and the writers took a number of very obvious liberties with the story. In the books, the story unfolded over two centuries. The miniseries compressed it into a few decades. A great deal of it took on the persona of modern 21st century cultural zeitgeist; which is, admittedly, inevitable. But somehow this came across as almost cheap gimmickry.

They took considerable license with the role of Rikki Stormgren (played by Mike Vogel); in the book, he worked for the UN. In the miniseries, he was a farmer. A great deal of time was spent on Stormgren's personal life; much more than the storyline merited. The immense time spent dwelling on Stormgren's life detracted from the overall story.

Rodricks entire life was woven into the story. An impoverished boy who'd been confined to a wheelchair was eventually cured of his malady, and grew up to be an intellectually restless scientific adventurer.

There were also some additions of characters that Clarke would doubtless have felt were superfluous. The addition of Peretta Jones (played by Yael Stone) was not in the book. Her presence was, despite Stone's excellent performance, seemingly added as an afterthought in order to alter the real purpose of the story. She was professionally a child psychologist, but in her personal life was a devout Christian in a world where religion had become largely irrelevant. She was opposed to the presence of the Overlords, largely on religious grounds, and immensely frustrated because she was powerless to do anything about it.

In one scene, she was attempting to help one of the children who was transforming. In a scene where the boy's psychic power was manifesting in a violent and uncontrollable manner, a gold crucifix on a chain that Jones wore suddenly began strangling her, and the crucifix was damaged and misshapen in the process. This was clearly an irrelevancy that served absolutely no useful purpose to the story. Yet Hurran and staff took great pains to emphasize it. It was irrelevant because the apotheosis the children were going through both ignored and validated religious doctrine; especially as is interpreted through Christian eschatology. It was clear this was added to subliminally propagate an atheist agenda; which, actually has no place in the story. It's presence turned much of the message of the story into a incongruous hybrid.

There were other irrelevancies (such as the drawings some of the children were making during their transformation were an eye in a triangle)s which had absolutely no place in the story, and clearly served the aforementioned agenda.

This was the greatest weakness and flaw of the miniseries. Hurran and the writers of the miniseries almost failed to understand (or at least were weak in communicating) the main point of Clarke's vision. The original story did not drive a wedge between science and religion; it united them in a way wherein the two polar opposites validated each other. Clarke was one of the few writers of any genre who succeeded in writing anything original about God, and presented it in a way that answered more questions than it created. Perhaps these religious dichotomies were an inevitable part of the process by which the real answers to these problems must be sought. But there were times when the miniseries was attacking religious bigotry (or at least the unimaginative) when a more subtle approach would produce a desirable result. Its navigation of these metaphysical and philosophical obstacles and conundrums was more than a little clumsy. The failure to find a common focal point between all the world's religions (and not just Christianity) was another major flaw in the story.

Clarke's novel, Childhood's End draws on Christian allegory: the Overlords are Satan and his rebel angels, the Overmind is a God-like figure, and the assimilation of the children into the Overmind is the Rapture and Armageddon rolled into one. Saddled with his conception of a science fiction version of Armageddon, Clarke was forced to have the Overlords shut heaven off to mankind. This was why humanity was forbidden from leaving earth; they could never hope to handle what was among the stars, and Karellen told humanity that one of his duties was to protect them from forces they could not understand. The celestial portals were shut in humanity's face. But what was perhaps not properly emphasized in the miniseries was that the Overlords were, really, slaves of a power, God, if you will, that they were powerless against and could never understand, despite their immense achievements. In the end, humanity would surpass the Overlords and become their masters.

The presentation of the aforementioned New Athens community was pitiful. It was a cheap reproduction of 80's era New York City, that seemed to have been glued on to the movie as an afterthought.

Although the end of the miniseries was somewhat true to the book (despite some weaknesses that would have been alleviated had they not wasted so much time and budget on Stormgren's personal life earlier in the series), the emphasis on the aforementioned spiritual / metaphysical element of the story was almost lost.

Rodricks's meeting with the ""Overmind"" on the Overlords' home planet Jejedda (which would merit a thorough etymological analysis: the Arabic words for paradise and hell, respectively, are Jenna and Jehenna) was an interesting affair. The CGI treatment of Jejedda was well done, if unimaginative compared to Clarke's vision. As for the Overmind itself, I imagine anyone daring to tackle such a Herculean task is worthy of respect, and any error or shortcoming would be justifiably overlooked. The Overmind's statement ""I am the collective consciousness of the universe"" implies a pantheistic identity which, all things considered, imposed a limitation upon limitlessness; a problem solvable only by a metaphysics rooted in monotheism. The other problem presented here was that it told Rodricks that ""only the children are God."" If pantheism were to include all consciousness, then, to reject the older generations of humanity would be to cancel its own claim to pantheism. The only real solution to this is the concept of a universal consciousness that transcends pantheistic traits, and is omniscient as well as omnipotent,  And in this, time itself would be presented as a non-linear phenomenon. But Hurran's vision condemns time to linear limitations. This was another flaw the writers tried to wiggle their way out of, and lacked the metaphysical sophistication to provide any real answers for. The explanation of how consciousness survives physical earth was sophomoric at best, and lacked the subtlety that a true resolution between science and religion demands. In fact, their lack of imagination was downright deplorable.

The CGI for the end of the earth was a disappointment. In the book, Rodricks saw "",, a great auroral storm. The whole sky is lit up,,, red, golds, and greens are chasing each other across the sky - oh, it's beyond words. It doesn't seem fair that I'm the only one to see it. I never though such colors,,."" It was a terrible disappointment that the production staff of the miniseries skimped on this, especially since modern CGI technology could easily have reproduced Clarke's vision.

At the end of the book, while Rodricks reported his impressions of the destruction of the earth to Karellen. his description was immensely beautiful, and he faced this with courage. He mentioned sensing a feeling of achievement, and expressed a sadness for Karellen and the Overlords, who were stuck in an evolutionary cul-de-sac from which they would never escape. The miniseries portrayed this differently, or at least lost the inherent nobility and majesty of Clarke's original vision of Rodricks' role as the last man. This added more disappointment to an already disappointing work.

I must make mention of the music. Most of the incidental music score of the miniseries was, while competent and effective, somewhat unremarkable. Nothing stood out (or really needed to, it being in a role of subliminal subservience to the story). There was, however, one exception.

Rodricks' childhood friend was a homeless man living in an abandoned car, who often played a recording of Ralph Vaughn Williams' 'The Lark Ascending."" When reporting the destruction of earth to Karellen, he asked that some part of humanity's achievements be preserved. In what was clearly a ""downloading"" of Rodricks' memories, Karellen found this music, and used some mysterious technology to insure that, in the ages to follow, whoever would visit our solar system would encounter this music. Of course, this never happened in the book, but it was one of the few fitting and poetic nuances Hurran added to the story.

And of course, Karellen was left with the loneliness that followed. I quote the book: ""Six thousand million kilometers beyond the orbit of Pluto, Karellen sat before a suddenly darkened screen. The weight of centuries was upon him, and a sadness that no logic could dispel.""

All in all, Childhood's End was an enjoyable, if imperfect and an arguably failed attempt at translating one of the greatest works of science fiction to the screen. Like Dune, I imagine others may attempt the Herculean task, and may, perhaps succeed in those areas where this one failed.

I hope I won't have to wait another 40 years.",1456963200,55,13432,5.127513711151737

Necessary spoiler alert:  It ends with the complete destruction of humanity with some nonsense about some ""altered"" children being able to merge with God or some other such nonsense.  I didn't read the book, and this movie convinces me not to.  It was depressing.  Aside from demonstrating why folks shouldn't trust people who promise them a utopian nanny state where they will be taken care of(reminds me of Obama), it has no redeeming features.  By the way, for all the folks who complained about the commercials, why didn't you just record it and watch it a couple hours later, fast forwarding through all the commercials.

7562117,5,B019329VF0,"Childhood's End is based on the novel of the same name by Arthur C. Clarke, which is an epic spanning many years that follows a few intertwined stories after the arrival of what are deemed ""the Overlords,"" mysterious, unseen alien beings that arrive in massive starships preaching an end to poverty, war and hate, and the dawn of a new age. Broken into three parts, this mini-series shows the changes humanity endures, the darkness and the light, but leading to what?

Childhood's End depicts a grim and depressing look of the future that was showcased in the '53 book, which translates to screen in a big way. While there were a couple major changes (the time-frame, the setting, and the first lead character's background), they didn't hamper the miniseries in any way. It could be argued that the character of Ricky Stormgren being an everyman instead of a government representative was less realistic, it actually does make more sense he is that because look at the time we're in. When it comes to government officials, there's a lot of negativity and ""bad publicity."" If one of the commonfolk, so to speak, became the Messenger for humanity, he provides a much-desired face amidst shrewd politics and the chaotic media. The direction of this event series was brilliant, detailing and following the vast and revealing changes humanity endured over the course of what's called The Golden Age of Man. The writing for the series was great, and did suffer just a bit from being slightly bloated (probably trying to fill the three-night slot), but overall, it was a solid and thought-provoking script that channeled some of the best of Clarke's themes. The acting was good, a little bland in spots, but it was actor Osy Ikhile as Milo who brought an Emmy-worthy performance alongside Charles Dance's Karellen, who was both terrifying and tragic. Then, you have the outstanding and phenomenal visual effects and production. The people behind Childhood's End, surprisingly enough, took the designs talked about in Childhood's End for the crafts and the Overlords, and brought them to life with stunning CG and a substantial use of practical effects as well. Also, the CG in the third part was beyond outstanding (you'll know why when you see it), and they did go on to win and be nominated for a lot of visual effect awards. Last but not least is Charlie Clouser's musical score. Clouser also scored Fox's Wayward Pines last year, but here, instead of something more quiet and sinister, he goes for bold and heart-wrenching, making use of haunting strings and eerie ambient sounds to convey the bleakness and horror of not knowing what's to happen.

Childhood's End could be seen as a cautionary tale of sorts, about the future of humanity and our desire to continue pushing forward into the unknown. After all, what got us here: manifest destiny. Whether it's the boldness of the ending or the sheer spectacle of the miniseries' sweeping scope, Childhood's End can and probably will be a sci-fi classic, along side the legendary novel it is based on.",1454889600,17,3047,4.903100775193798

7562120,4,B019329VF0,"I've been a science fiction fan ever since I learned to read and Childhood's End. became one of the milestones in my life when I first read it in 1953. (Although not as great in the scheme of things as C.E., a couple of novels that impressed me greatly early on are If This Goes On from 1940 (before my time) by Heinlein from Revolt in 2100, from his Future History series, and Vonnegut's first novel, Player Piano (which I didn't read until its paperback release in 1954 as Utopia 14) which still has relevance for today's woprld. (There are so many more...)

Anyway, Childhood's Endf has been called Clarke's greatest novel. I agree. However it's not an upbeat story, which probably accounts for C.E. never being made into a movie like 2001: A Space Odyssey; which germinated from Clarke's short story The Sentinel, published in 1951.

Syfy's adaptation is thus the only video production of the C.E story and IMHO is a creditable effort. But Syfy's presentation was such a distraction it almost destroyed the concept. If only HBO or Netflix had gotten the rights to C.E. instead of Syfy....

I recommend reading the novel, Childhood's End before watching the video, but if you want to see the video, once the DVD is released and the price finds a level based on supply and demand, the DVD or streaming video of C.E. without commercial or promo distractions is a great consolation prize!",1453852800,2,1388,4.703703703703703

8743739,2,B019329VF0,"Apparently the Syfy home media department has decided that all of their discs must use the same menu format, with the same unhelpfully-unlabeled icons.  The first icon is the Play triangle, for Play All.  The second icon is a TV, for Select Episode.  This is a three-part miniseries.  Each part was a two-hour broadcast (90 minutes on disc without commercials), so each part is on its own disc of this three-disc DVD set.  That meansyep, you guessed itif you choose Select Episode on any given disc, there is only one episode to select!  My sincere hope is that when this title was in the design phase, SOMEBODY at Syfy tried to talk them out of this idiocy, arguing that the menu on disc one should say Play Part One and the menu on disc two should say Play Part Two, etc, only to have some boneheaded big-wig at Syfy insist that they stick to their standard disc menu, regardless of how stupid it makes them seem.  What were they thinking?

As for the miniseries itself, part one is great, part two is great, Charles Dance is awesome, but part three ends on a depressing, nihilistic downer of an ending.  There were many things left unresolved, but as this miniseries differs significantly from the Arthur C Clarke novel, this is the fault of this Syfy production, not the source material.

Given that Childhoods End is not one of Clarkes best novels anyway, and given that Asimovs novels are better than Clarkes novels (although Clarkes short stories are better than Asimovs short stories), one cant help but wonder why Syfy decided to adopt this novel in particular, when there are so many other better ones they could have chosen (Clarke or Asimov either one)?

8743741,3,B019329VF0,"The most amazing and pessimistic dystopia about humanity. Some Extraterrestrials, or Aliens, or both arrive on earth one day and impose the simple rule, one simple rule, and only one: NO WAR, NO DISEASE, NO POVERTY. But thats been the dream of humanity since it decided to become agricultural and cattle-raising. At once they had to invent the property of land and regular work in the field for everyone, except a few who became priests or soldiers or politicians. That was about 15,000 years ago. Since Homo Sapiens is at least 300,000 years old, this last and most recent period is like one hour before midnight and midnight is close.

This series in three parts or episodes is frighteningly banal. Humans accept the deal both because they like it and because there is no choice. Do it or just disappear. And they did it and they will discover in the third part that the price to pay is that all children born after the take-over have to go up into the cosmos and become the property of these Aliens. Thats so ridiculous. Thats Trump and his executive orders along the border with Mexico. The children are seized and sent everywhere, and no one knows where, away from their parents and their parents are deported back to where they were coming from. In 2015 the series was prophetic, apart from the fact that all children accept it with pleasure, fascination and jubilation: the jubilation of the silent contemplation of a life somewhere else without any link with earth at all left.

But the most ridiculous element of all is the physical appearance of these Aliens. He is (the series show two of them look-alike twins) exactly a picture of the devil, red of course, with horns of course, with wings and a tail of course, and standing on horse-like hoofs, of course, directly taken out of the medieval books of horrors where Satan is depicted like that. This is absurd and in many ways condescending and humiliating for the audience. How can a human audience accept such a ridiculous rewriting of the worst possible version of the Christian faith?

But don't worry, there is no real resistance for a long period of time, though some who manage to make a profit out of the situation, who manage to be richer than the rich and more powerful than the powerful try to organize the masses, I mean the elite, to use their science to keep control of the situation. In vain Dr. Watson, in vain, but we all know that vanity of vanity all is vanity. So the whole heavenly paradise will end when an illuminated Christian shoots the Supervisor for Earth. He is saved by the main actor who uses the present this Karellen had just given him, a special cure-all-diseases injection to revive the poor dead Karellen, dead with one miserable shot from one frail and meaningless human shotgun brandished by a woman.

Then a few scientists refuse the loss of children and to be happy slaves and they devise, I should say HE devises, one final atom nuclear fusion bomb that kills all life on earth and makes earth absolutely unstable to the point of collapse. One black scientist who was saved, preserved before the cataclysm, is revived after the upside down big bang but he refuses to remain with the Aliens and decides to go back to earth and what was to happen happens. The earth explodes and is annihilated, the scientist along with it, sitting on a derelict sofa in the middle of a field of ruins.

The worst part of this saga is that it is not even funny, and certainly not frightening or eliciting any empathy. Too bad. But the nightmare of being taken over by some Extraterrestrial Aliens is so innocuous that the use of Christian satanic iconography will never make us ask for more. We all have a little Satan in one cabinet or cupboard of ours at home. One always needs a little Satan at home.
