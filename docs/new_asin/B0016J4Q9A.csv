8262651,5,B0016J4Q9A,Teacher review: I Can Do Yoga! Year after year a kindergarten favorite (teacher and student). This video is a just right fit for kindergarten. Quite and calm for my large group. Encouraging focus and control with each pose! And don't forget the alphabet too!!!! I have 5 yoga videos in my classroom collection this is by far #1!,1415750400,,328,4.672413793103448
8262652,5,B0016J4Q9A,"I gave this video as a present for a good friend of mine, a busy mom with two energetic kids.  She just called to say that it turned into a life saver for her!  As a single mom trying to juggle work and the house, she always used to tell me that the hardest part of the day is coming home after work.  She has to help her eight-year-old son with homework, then it's time to make dinner, everyone's  hungry and her little daughter is starved for affection and attention after a long day at preschool.  She used to tell me she felt like going nuts with so much to do at once! But instead of screaming, she tried popping in this DVD I got her.  And she says it really helped in getting her kids to unwind while she prepped dinner.  She says having them do yoga is so much better than just letting them watch TV --  Rather than zoning out they're active and releasing their pent up energy -- in a calming way. She says they especially enjoy doing the ABC animal poses where they can act like ducks, hippos and other fun animals...and doing the meditation at the end of the DVD always leaves them relaxed and smiling.  She says there's nothing cuter than her four-year-old saying: ""Mommy, can I do more yoga when we get home?""
The other day I went to visit them, and, sure enough, within 10 minutes both of the kids were entertaining me with their animal yoga poses!  I even joined in practicing with them...and actually it was pretty good exercise for me, too! :)",1269302400,,1459,4.291970802919708
8262653,5,B0016J4Q9A,"My two and four year olds have gotten so much out of yoga DVDs on top of mommy and me classes. This one is a new favorite. The combination of real kids and animation seems to be an important one for keeping toddler/preschooler attention. It's such a great option to have yoga DVDs as an alternative to other kids DVDs in our collection - and I love to hear my kids request yoga above others. It's so fun to see them bust out their best poses/moves! The teacher has a great vibe - very fun, yet very calming. We are especially grateful for the multi-lingual soundtrack, since it has been impossible to find anything else in Japanese for our bilingual household. So glad that Robin/Tani Inc. put this one out there in the world!",1265414400,,726,4.425373134328358
8262654,4,B0016J4Q9A,The yoga poses are great for kids but the background need to be better. My kid have hard time follow some poses because of poor background but overall it is fun.,1246233600,,161,4.225806451612903
8262655,5,B0016J4Q9A,"I got this DVD for my cousins and they really enjoyed it with friends!  I think the instructor, Rana, is very knowlegeable about exercise for kids. With her instruction, they can stretch their body really comfortably. I recommend this to all the kids, and this video even has a Japanese voice over, which is just perfect for my Japanese speaking family!",1223856000,,353,4.786885245901639
