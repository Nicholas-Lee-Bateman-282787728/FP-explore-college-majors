'House'---the screen is too dark to see much, and it's very boring. 'Guru'---looks like a play put on by your neighbors: like the actors were told, ""don't do anything except read your lines.""",1229385600,2,307,4.923076923076923
8272229,1,B000UYN9R2,"20 MINUTES INTO THE FIRST FEATURE 'GRAVE OF THE VAMPIRE' AND I AM READY TO PITCH THIS DVD. PROBABLY THE WORST AUDIO DUB OVER EVER! AMAZON ALSO SCREWED UP BY SAYING THE STUDIO IS IMAGE ENTERTAINMENT (WHO ARE EXCELLENT). THE STUDIO/COMPANY THAT DISTRIBUTES THIS DVD IS ACTUALLY RETROMEDIA (WHICH AS EVERBODY KNOWS, IS QUITE SUCKY). SHAME ON YOU RETROMEDIA. THE DUBBING OF SECOND MOVIE 'HOUSE OF EVIL' IS NOT NEARLY AS BAD AND DOES FEATURE SOME EXCELLENT GOTHIC ORGAN PLAYIGN THROUGHOUT BY NON OTHER THAN BORIS KARLOFF HIMSELF. I'VE YET TO WATCH THE 3RD ANDY MILLIGAN FEATURE BUT AM SURE IT WON'T BE MUCH BETTER.",1181692800,,609,4.809523809523809
