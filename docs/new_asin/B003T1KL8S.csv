4190055,5,B003T1KL8S,"A fashionable contemporary art gallerist in Chelsea, New York falls for a brooding new music composer in this comic satire of the state of contemporary art.

Adam Goldberg (Two Days in Paris) plays the serious composer, whose work calls for paper crumpling, glass breaking and bucket kicking. Marley Shelton (Grindhouse) plays the gorgeous Chelsea gallerist, whose latest show features an artist (Vinnie Jones) who employs taxidermy and household objects.

Further complicating the affair is the composers brother, played by Eion Bailey (Band of Brothers), whose highly commercial art work the financial backbone of the gallery - is sold to corporate clients discreetly out of the gallerys back room.",1330214400,,700,5.472222222222222
4190056,3,B003T1KL8S,"The movie titled ""(Untitled)"" is a small-scale non-commercial art film that makes fun of small, non-commercial art works - or, more precisely, those who produce, purchase or admire such works.

The story focuses on two brothers with widely differing views on art.  Adrian (Adam Goldberg) is a composer whose idea of ""music"" is to bang away on an array of regular household items (a steel bucket being the predominant instrument in his ""orchestra"") resulting in an ear-splitting, atonal cacophony.  Josh (Eion Bailey) is an abstract painter who's ""sold out"" by actually selling his works to corporate buyers, though he would now like to earn some respectability as an artist by having his own show.  Madeleine (Marely Shelton) is a dealer who sells Josh's works to fund her own gallery of minimalist and conceptual art but who won't display his paintings there.

Written and directed by Jonathan Parker, ""(Untitled)"" offers some droll moments of offbeat humor, as it gently skewers the absurdity and self-congratulatory pretentiousness of the abstract-art world and the minions who inhabit it - though, if truth be told, there are times when the movie itself, with its minimalistic drama and lackluster storytelling, comes dangerously close to becoming the very thing it's satirizing.  However, the art works themselves are cleverly and appropriately awful, and the movie has just enough knowing wryness to overcome its undernourished storytelling.",1328227200,,1447,5.352422907488987
4190057,2,B003T1KL8S,"Sometimes even if you don't get what a filmmaker is trying to do, you like the result.  And then sometimes you do get it, but don't like it.  This film has half a dozen totally unlikeable characters, all narcissistic artists - is that redundant?  The beautiful but way quirky gallery owner has one brother (Eion Bailey) whose art is very commercial but it keeps her financially flush.  She doesn't like him or his art all that much, instead she likes the bizzarro artists of modern style.  You know the type.  Stick a cigarette on the wall, give it a name and call it art.  Well the gallerist (Marley Shelton), does like the brother of her bread winner (Adam Goldberg) who's as nutso about his music as the guy sticking the ciggy on the wall is about art.  I understand how this is a satire about art snobs, but I found the whole thing rather tedious if not odious.",1326758400,,865,4.430379746835443

4190062,5,B003T1KL8S,"This may turn out to be my favorite film of the year!  It is a hilarious send-up of the pretensions of the contemporary Art and Classical Music scenes.  Knowledgeable viewers will have a field day identifying the delightful parodies of the work of several famous visual artists and composers, while everyone else will embrace this indulgent and warm-hearted portrait of a group of people whose only sin is that of taking themselves a bit too seriously.  The splendid (and occasionally quite deliberately ridiculous!) music is provided by the fine American composer David Lang, who is best known for his work with the successful Bang On a Can ensemble.  Lang was awarded the 2008 Pulitzer Prize in music for his choral piece The Little Match Girl Passion.  I think you will all like this little movie.  I laughed myself silly.",1288224000,,825,4.899280575539568
4190063,5,B003T1KL8S,"A great film that keenly displays the contemporary art world and its Technicolor, snub, uptight, and arrogant inhabitants. The film works as a comedy with its goofy and outrages characters and scenarios though thoughtfully displays a wide range of stronger emotions without being predictable and corny like most comedy films that try to these days. There is also a lot of girth to the story and can be looked at as an artist's portrait(if the viewer is willing to risk being the pun of the many jokes included in the film about the aesthetics of such things). If you have ever had a discussion of what is art and what isn't, if you ever found yourself confused by the minimalism or dadaism of an art piece, if you ever yelled at the fat fingers that twiddle at art and the artists these days, if you ever visited the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, this film is a must see.",1287100800,4,877,4.4875
4190064,5,B003T1KL8S,"My students at the art school told me to see the movie (they had had free tickets for a local screening for art types, and the writers and directors were there in person to explain it all).  My one student Levi was so persuasive that my wife and I went on Thanksgiving weekend as sort of a cultural antidote to the previous evening when we had seen 2012.  The theater wasn't exactly packed but the air was filled with howls of laughter, for everything in the movie from the get go is perfectly placed to ensure maximum hilarity.  The movie begins with the sort of sight gag that Jacques Tati perfected: morose composer Adam Goldberg arrives at the venue for his performance and is surprised to see the sidewalk outside the box office thronged with hip, excited people.  Cut to: bus pulling up; cut to: bus rolling away and no one left on pavement at all--no, one person.  Once the concert begins iot's so bad that even Adam's dad can't take it.  Right away he rises from his seat and takes the mother with him.  (Later, when Adam asks what happened, the mother says, ""Your father had to go to the bathroom.""  ""You were gone for forty minutes!"")  Adam Goldberg isn't the world's most versatile actor, but if you liked him in Entourage playing the egomaniacal cult film director, he does it again here, but with more restraint perhaps.

Madeleine Gray (Marley Shelton) is a tony gallerist who prides herself on showing only what she calls ""non-commercial work.""  It's a little unclear what this means, since her Damien Hirst-like star artist Ray Barko seems to be selling plenty of his repulsive taxidermy pieces, but little by little we come to understand that the bread and butter of the gallery is Josh Jacobs, who paints the kind of art you see in hotel rooms--inoffensive impressionist daubs with misty swirling colors and his signature circles.  Madeleine won't give him a show, and secretively makes deals for his work out of her back room, as though it were porn or black market.  Eion Bailey plays Josh, the painter deluded about his own talent, who can't understand why Madeleine won't give him a show.  Last week we saw Marley Shelton (Madeleine) as the heroine in the 1990s thriller Valentine, and Eoin Bailey we remember as the handsome med student lusting after the teenage ballerinas in the camp classic Center Stage, and so we can report with assurance that the acting of both of them has improved dramatically!

But even they, fine as they are, are overshadowed by the acting of a magnificent team of supporting players.  Vinnie Jones, once the scariest man in UK movies, is a revelation as the Damien Hirst type.  An actor new to me called Ptolemy Slocum (!!!) plays Monroe, a single-name artist so neurotic he resembles a sensitive plant more than a human being, while Zak Orth is hilarious as a collector who'll ape any trend in contemporary art and whose apartment is a showcase of everything crazy about today's mad art world.  Trinie Dalton, writing for Amazon above, nails this one when she praises it for its consistently getting everything right.  Okay, there were a few loose ends, and the film finally does Marley Shelton no favors by turning her into a Faye-Dunaway-in-Network inhuman bitch, but it's a film that will someday be seen as superior to any of the Christopher Guest films it superficially resembles.",1259452800,16,3338,4.743944636678201
4190065,5,B003T1KL8S,"Little-known film with great performances by all. As an artist, I can vouch for the verite of this cinema. The present-day art market is 99.9% celebrity and 0.1% ripping off talented artists from pre-1964. One thing the film failed to explore is how every successful present-day artist has millionaire parents who sponsor the shows and buy their little darlings' first 200+ works through agents. The film visually referenced some of the most egregious examples from recent decades, but if you aren't knowledgeable about the art market, you won't get a lot of the jokes. Featured are works that sold for >$100,000 <20 years ago but aren't worth more than recycling today. A cautionary romp through the risible world of current tastes.",1442448000,,733,5.066115702479339

4190075,4,B003T1KL8S,"This was totally unexpected treasure comedy about art and artists in contemporary NYC.  The art is question is music/performance art and visual art (paintings, sculpures and other objects if one can call them that).  Most of the actors in this film are unknown (to me), but their performances are fantastic.  From start to finish one has to wonder are these people for real, or are they going through life faking it.

In any case, film digs into questions of today's state of the contemporary art.  What is art?  Who is the true artist - the one who can actually support himself by selling his paintings while not being recognised by any of the major art museums, or the artist whose work is bought by clueless rich people trying to make themselves look sophisticated by collecting trash and displaying it in their huge lofts?  How those professional relationships translate themselves into personal ones?

I found many moments of this film funny - particularly the performing art one (kicking the bucket).  Not a movie for shallow audiences - I am sure they would get bored by it very quickly.",1382832000,,1094,4.807486631016043

4190079,5,B003T1KL8S,"I can't say enough about how clever, sharp, sophisticated and funny this movie is.  I haven't had this much fun watching a movie in years.  Adam Goldberg's character was my favorite in the film; he turned out to be the only sane one among the rest of the quirky characters, who were also fun to watch.  He also happens to deliver my absolute favorite line in the movie (about why melody [in music] was ""created"").

I've [highly] recommended this movie to my friends connected to the art world; from academia, aficionados, artists, and everyone in between.  It's a smart commentary about the fickle nature of the art world in general, and included, perhaps inadvertently, a message about the importance of being true to yourself as an artist, regardless of how others choose to critique your work - a message perfectly applicable to anyone in any line of work.

This is definitely one of my favorites among my personal collection of movies.  An instant classic!",1364947200,,960,4.817073170731708

4190081,4,B003T1KL8S,"Untitled (Jonathan Parker, 2009)

I remember seeing trailers for this back before it originally came out, and seeing some critical buzz attached to it, but then never actually got round to seeing it until Netflix told me it was going to pop off my queue at midnight if I didn't sit down and actually watch it. Part of the problem was that nothing I heard about the movie back then really excited me; it just seemed like yet another indie rom-com. Ten minutes into the movie, I realized I had been misled. Untitled is, in fact, an indie rom-com, but there is nothing at all ""yet"" about it. I will say that as someone who's been immersed in this world for fifteen years as a participant, and decades longer as a fan, I probably found it a whole lot funnier than many people will, but that's no reason not to see it.

Adrian Jacobs (The Salton Sea's Adam Goldberg) is a classically-trained pianist who, along with the other members of his ensemble (played by Hitch's Ptolemy Slocum and Hot Fuzz' Lucy Punch), creates dissonant, inaccessible sound pieces during performances attended by almost no one. Madeleine (Pleasantville's Marley Shelton) is a Soho gallery owner who caters to the whims of ultra-rich art collector Porter Canby (Vicky Cristina Barcelona's Zak Orth) while trying to woo London-based artist Ray Barko (The Midnight Meat Train's Vinnie Jones) into signing an exclusive contract with her. The two come into contact when Madeleine, who is dating Adrian's brother Josh (Fight Club's Eion Bailey) as the film opens, attends on of his performances. She invites his ensemble to perform at a Ray Barko opening at her gallery, where Porter Canby hears them--and commissions a piece for $25,000, which may be more than Adrian has made in his entire career. Incidentally, the two of them fall in love, while trying to keep that a secret from Josh.

Why did I find this movie hilarious? Because I know these people, every one of them, most of them intimately. This despite the obvious influences (Adrian is based on Morton Feldman, and Parker--who also co-wrote the script--adds a delightful bit of meta by having Adrian attend a performance in celebration of ""Morton Cabot""'s 90th birthday, and ends up sitting next to Cabot himself [played by Jagged Edge's Ben Hammer], who offers Adrian some sage advice at a critical time in his life; Ray Barko is, equally obviously, a caricature of Damien Hirst); in fact, were Parker based in Cleveland, there's one scene featuring Ptolemy Slocum's character where I'd have bet money Parker actually based him on... me. (For trivia purposes: when he's practicing for the Canby piece, kicking the bucket over... and over... and over...) Parker gets it, and he's savvy enough to poke fun at modern art and the scene surrounding it without ever disclosing whether he's laughing at his characters or with them, not that most of these humorless fools have much of a sense of humor. A lot of people commenting on the IMDB boards about the movie are convinced Parker is simply lampooning the scene, but he's depicted it too well to just be someone on the outside looking in. (Catch a few news stories about your favorite ""fringe"" scene, and compare them to the job Parker does here, and you'll see what I mean.)

This is a fun, fun movie, and I recommend it highly. ****",1354492800,,3308,4.798245614035087
