I now have all 5 seasons and I enjoy watching it...would love to get the reunion movie if it ever comes out on DVD.",1391558400,,279,3.912280701754386

5940219,5,B00ESLAIYK,Loved this show back when I was in high-school ... and I'm loving these episodes again ... the release of the final seasons has been a long time coming ... I highly recommend this show !!,1391212800,,187,4.222222222222222
5940220,3,B00ESLAIYK,"I like this series and the people in it, but by the time season 5 came out, I could see why it was the end of the show. I don't think the stories were as good, although I did like a lot of the guest stars who were just starting out in their careers back then.  I would recommend this to Mod  Squad fans.",1391040000,,303,3.71875
5940221,5,B00ESLAIYK,"Sadly here in Australia, Seasons 2 - 5 of The Mod Squad are not available, only Season 1 Volumes 1 & 2, even thou when it originally aired here in the early 70's, it was a high rated show, which is sad for fans such as myself who never saw the original runs. Sadly too, it has never been back on Australian TV as repeats/reruns. Thanks to sites such as Amazon, I can purchase the rest of the remaining 4 seasons with no problems.
A great buy, as I was eagerly awaiting the release of Season 5 Volumes 1 & 2!",1390780800,,507,4.02970297029703
5940222,4,B00ESLAIYK,"Again, the same issues that I mentioned in the previous volumes. Again, they need to make everything in one Season. The disc set up and having easy access to see what each show is about. Again, the show is really a 5, but the issues bring it down.",1389312000,,247,4.166666666666667
5940223,5,B00ESLAIYK,ALWAYS a great TV show to watch during the70's. Very good price for the full 2 seasons. A 5 star rating !!!!,1388448000,,108,3.9545454545454546
5940224,4,B00ESLAIYK,"As I write this review, Amazon is saying that this DVD is currently unavailable as it is being reviewed for quality however I must have placed my order early enough as I did receive it and haven't noticed anything different in this set as I did in seasons 3 or 4.

The episodes (as I noted in my review of season 3 volume 1) are not restored however do not let that hold you back from making a purchase. Some look much better than others and I'm glad they are all now available in some official form. The runtimes for the most part seem complete however there may be some edits in the episodes which would be covered by the disclaimer. Again, I think VEI has to go with whatever is provided to them by the current owners of the series and it doesn't look like past season 2, the episodes have gone under any type of restoration. I can only assume it is cost prohibitive to do so as historically sales for shows dwindle with each season.

That being said, speaking of the episodes themselves, I think they are quite fun for a (by the time these aired) 5 year old show. The one thing I am a little bummed out about is that the season opener ""The Connection"" is in two parts. It originally aired as a two hour episode in 1972 and it would have been cool to see it as it was originally presented. It is interesting to see how the show changed over time as it went from the late 60s into the early 70s. While some of the earliest episodes deal with real counterculture themes, as the show goes on they get away from that and it becomes a really solid (no pun intended) fun and entertaining cop show. With the cast getting a little older and the culture starting to shift by this time, the stories aren't so much about them going undercover to keep the youth from being exploited. They plug themselves in to a variety of criminal activities where younger kids aren't so much being used to commit the crimes but their roles within these activities remain very believeable. You also have more personal stories where things are happening to loved ones in their lives and they can leverage their jobs to help out. An argument could be made that the series shifted from it's original concept at this time but I think the changes keep it fresh. They are just a good time. Pick these up / sit back and enjoy. Lose yourself for a few hours. Something fun to note as you go through these. Notice whenever anyone goes shopping, they all have the same groceries in their bag. The givaway was seeing one of those old Kelloggs variety packs each time I saw someone with a bag of groceries. :)",1387756800,2,2573,4.33609958506224
5940225,4,B00ESLAIYK,"The new Mod Squad releases suffer from what is warned as 'historical anomalies'  in the menu. The good news is that it's just a half dozen or so episodes (from VEI's seasons 3-5) that have slightly sub-par color representation and millisecond lasting foreign objects flying into the screen on rare occasion. They occur almost all in season 4 volume 1. But in an example of 'cosmic sandbagging', I found just one episode that suffers from this the most in season 5 vol. 1: The epi 'Can you hear me out there?' guest staring Lou Gossett Jr., and I was praying that this specific episode would be okay. It's also good news, however, that these releases can  be had now in the Canadian marketplace, as I'm able to enjoy them and review them presently. I think Peggy Lipton owns  season 5, artistically. But I also feel she is by far the real star attraction of the this show; that's why I love it.",1385251200,2,893,4.5
