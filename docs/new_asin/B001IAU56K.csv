8310588,3,B001IAU56K,"The first half of the concert is quite good, especially with the band that features her father on a variety of stringed instruments. Shane Nicholson was unknown to me and a pleasant surprise. Kasey is clearly the lesser vocalist of the pair who either hasn't learned how to use microphone positioning to modulate her volume or perhaps doesn't care. I've always loved her edgy voice but it grated on me when she sang her solo and acoustic duets with only Shane in the 2nd half.",1471737600,,476,4.6117647058823525
8310589,1,B001IAU56K,"This DVD is in PAL format, which means that it won't play on US formatted DVD players.  Thus, you can't watch this unless you have a computer that plays DVD's in PAL format.  Amazon really dropped the ball on this one as they don't mention that dirty little problem in the product details.  I'm returning it today.",1283212800,,314,4.473684210526316
8310590,1,B001IAU56K,"I ordered a Rattlin' Bones DVD as offered on the U.S. Amazon site. The format said ""All regions"" which was a little confusing to say the least. The DVD turned out to be PAL and formatted for AUSTRALIA. This was supposed to be a present, and had to be returned, with no comparable replacement available. Please double-check formats before ordering, since we cannot always rely on the entries posted here. Amazon did refund my money. I still don't know why they offered an Australian-formatted DVD on the US site. How many casual viewers in the US know what format they need?  They need to put a notice on the listing that it is not a US-format.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kasey-Chambers-Shane-Nicholson-Rattlin-Bones-Ma/dp/B001IAU56K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kasey Chambers & Shane Nicholson-Rattlin Bones: Ma</a>",1265846400,,856,5.848
8310591,1,B001IAU56K,Don't waste your money on this DVD if you live in North America.  It won't play on U.S. or Canadian players; it's PAL format.  Amazon should make this much more prominent.,1260489600,2,171,4.483870967741935
8310592,4,B001IAU56K,"Kasey Chambers and Shane Nicholson in a very nice concert in PAL format.  Like the previous reviewer, I own a couple of DVD players that won't play this title.  Recently I bought a Oppo DV-981HD for region free and PAL playback and must say  it is fantastic.  This disc will also play fine on my Apple computers

If you enjoyed the CD, you'll enjoy this video.  Production, particularly the lighting, is a little slick for the material but the image is very high quality and the sound is great.  Wonderful songs and soaring harmonies.",1239667200,2,534,4.617021276595745
8310593,1,B001IAU56K,"I am a huge Kasey Chambers fan and was excited to see ""Rattlin Bones"" on DVD.  The DVD arrived today, but WHAT'S going on here.  The DVD will not play on either of my two dvd players.  IT WILL NOT PLAY ON US DVD PLAYERS.
Amazon failed to inform customers that it is in the ""PAL"" format.  In fact you have to search the back of the case to find that infomation.
Shame on Amazon and the distributor of this product...  I am really surprised the Amazon would allow this product on their site and not inform customers that it will not play on US dvd players.",1237766400,6,554,4.140186915887851
