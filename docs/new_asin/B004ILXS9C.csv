4386972,5,B004ILXS9C,"Sid, Sid, Wonderful Kid! I don't mind my grandaughter watching this cartoon at all. Some of the cartoons look down right scary these days, and I don't know what they are teaching but it's not all good.... but Sid is a wonderful teacher for preschool, kindergarten age kids. My grandaughter knows all about recycling and going green thanks to Sid. Things I knew nothing about when I was 5. Two thumbs up for Sid and Going Green.",1327622400,,427,4.558441558441558
4386973,5,B004ILXS9C,"I ordered these because my son gets ""super big ideas"" from Sid.  We don't always get to catch the episodes on PBS, so this was a great way to fit it into our busy schedule.  I also like to try and do the science projects at home.  Even though my little guy is only two and a half, he has a journal.  He mostly scribbles right now. I go on the [...] and see if they have any extra activities.  Often they have coloring pages and online games. A great resource and way to teach my little guy science in a fun way.

8430819,5,B004ILXS9C,Love the graphics and the lessons taught.  Saw this series at a friends house earlier this year with her two year old and we both had a blast watching them.  Jim Henson is always a win in my book.  Especially as it encourages kids to ask questions about the world around them.  I bought a bunch of these for my 2 yr old niece and she's having a blast being introduced to Sid and his crew.  Fun & Educational to boot too!!!,1482278400,,422,4.097560975609756
8430820,5,B004ILXS9C,GREAT MOVIE!,1462924800,,12,5.5
8430821,5,B004ILXS9C,This series entertains and teaches children in a very lively way.  Going Green is just one DVD that we have and each are enjoyed by the children. Sid is a very precocious boy and he shows children how much fun learning can be.  His friends in the series are equally willing to learn and all play a part in the way they explore. I prefer to have these on hand to play when appropriate rather than wait for it to show up on PBS. My guys never get tired of watching these.,1462665600,,469,4.086956521739131
