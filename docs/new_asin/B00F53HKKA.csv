8612363,5,B00F53HKKA,Love it !  My local station stopped carrying Jamies 15 min meal in the U.S. The series had inspired me to cook flavorful and nutritious meals. What to do since this dvd formatted for Australian DVD? Solution: I bought a Sony Blu-Ray multi region player on Amazon. We needed a new blu ray player anyway.  Works great!  I 'm in heaven.  I love Jamie!,1475366400,,348,4.390625
8612364,1,B00F53HKKA,Caution:  PAL format is NOT used in U.S. and Canada.  Why not make it available in correct format for U.S. and Canada. You have fans here!!!,1386288000,6,140,4.346153846153846
