8310844,2,B001IDZGLG,"This DVD was very poorly made and presented! The subjects simply talked about what led up to the moment they died, and then......nothing! Thats it, end of story! Some of the accounts of how they died was somewhat interesting to hear, but then you're left hanging wondering ""well, what happened AFTER you died?"" Next thing you know, the credits roll by and the ""documentary"" ends. Plus.......in between subject interviews the film makers inserted some footage of images of what it looks like to drive without your glasses (Very blurry), mixed in with some annoying errie music. What the heck was that all about? Again, very poorly made and did not offer any follow through with thier interviews.",1443830400,,694,4.94017094017094
