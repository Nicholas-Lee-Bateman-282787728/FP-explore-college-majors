7798462,4,1573628646,"the only thing that rankles with me is J. leonard's moment of 'winning' - he and the entire team doing a lap of honor of the green - though his opponent hadn't finished and was left looking bemused and no doubt irritated at the childish behaviour he was witnissing, because in fact we hadn't yet won.
That sort of behaviour maybe ok for the NFL and some other sports - but it the opposite of the spirit of the game.
It's those few moments of hysteria that spoil the victory for me.",1086998400,,481,4.239130434782608
7798463,1,1573628646,"Without a doubt, this Ryder Cup will go down in history as the greatest ever. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said of the DVD.

From start to finish, the feel of the thing is that the producers had something better to do. The whole presentation feels like it's on fast forward. Choppy and disjointed!

And then there is what is left out altogether. Those of you who watched this one live will remember the actions of Payne Stewart toward his opponent, Colin Montgomerie. The matches had already been decided but Stewart and Montgomerie were still on the course. The fans had been merciless in their heckling of the big Scot and Stewart knew it. And, then, in a gesture of consummate sportsmanship, Stewart conceded the putt and the match to Monty! He just walked over and picked up Montgomerie's ball marker for a fifteen foot putt and ended the matches.

Afterward in an interview, Stewart explained that it just didn't matter. The cup was won by the US and he felt like being a sportsman and gentleman. Great stuff!

And the entire thing is recapped on the DVD. NOT!! How could such a thing be left out?! In the end it was like the air went out of the entire presentation and made me wish I had not wasted my money!

7798465,5,1573628646,"This Ryder Cup was truly the greatest golf Tournament that I have ever seen.  I remember watcing the NBC coverage, and I truly felt that the US couldn't come back.  The way they did it was truly unbelievable.  I was so  happy to here that there was a DVD coming out on the event and went it was  released, I immediately bought it.  The DVD truly allows you to see how  remarkable a comeback it was.  It was undoubtedly a comeback for the ages.  A must for every fan of U.S. Golf",955670400,13,478,4.108695652173913
