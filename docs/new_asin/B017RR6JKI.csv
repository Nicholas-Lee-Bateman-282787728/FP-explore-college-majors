I am very happy for the language of  Nd'akinna  (our land)  used in this movie, I give great thanks and praise to those working to save and revive it !

7516237,5,B017RR6JKI,"I'm not sure 5 stars is quite accurate, but at least 4 & 1/2 for a presentation that seems mostly factual about the beginnings of our Republic! While I think it pretty accurate I also think it took poetic license with some content to better sell the movie to that audience. Not perfect but certainly gives us a view of what probably took place in large part as our beginnings, our struggles and new settlers begin a new venture in a new world!",1458172800,4,443,4.349397590361446

7516240,4,B017RR6JKI,"THE STORY OF EARLY PLYMOUTH COLONY WITH AN EMPHASIS ON REALISM WHILE STILL TAKING A LITTLE DRAMATIC LICENSE WITH SOME FACTS

This made for TV dramatization has an emphasis on realism rather than pageantry, though it still changes minor instances or combines other events in order to provide drama.  I felt most of the divergences were not too critical though I don't know if I would contend they were necessary.  What I would really commend is the attempt at a more authentic feel or sense of realism to the general story and circumstances.  Of Plymouth Plantation, the literary account by William Bradford, is obviously the core of any account relating to the pilgrims and the Plymouth colony.  But I could tell this two part program relied on recent scholarship to compliment that work and flesh out the pilgrim experience.  It is not a perfect retelling and some events have been altered for dramatic affect.  But that is common in any dramatization that has to flesh out a script.  I thought it was quite compelling and the acting was quite good within the context of ""made for TV"".

THE STORY (as portrayed in this show):  As the title somewhat indicates, a significant part of the focus of this story is the conflict or differences between the believers of the pilgrims on the Mayflower and those around them.  We begin with the arduous voyage and some strain between the groups on board.  Some of those differences continue once they arrive at Plymouth (not their original destination).  But they must band together just to survive the late arrival, harsh winter on the way, and conflicts with native Americans.  The show does a terrific job of mentioning the harshness of their situation.  Though in an effort to fit into a little more than three hours, I felt it could have been even more descriptive.  Some of their hardships were mentioned almost as side notes just to make sure they were there.  Nevertheless, this is not a pretty period piece with perfect buildings, perpetually clean clothes, and overly ornate armor.  There is a gritty feel of realism rather than pageantry.  The conundrum of the natives is touched as the various tribes gather, discussing what to do and their past experiences with the English.  In particular, the leading tribe Pokanoket has now been diminished through attrition due to sickness and paying tribute to the Narragansett. Tesquanto (Squanto) is already with Massasoit of the Pokanoket.  His entire tribe has been lost to European disease.  Ironically, it is his old land of the Patuxet which the Pilgrims choose to colonize.  His allegiance and those formed by the pilgrims and Massasoit will all be tested gravely.

A LITTLE HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE:  ""Saints"" in the title refers to the pilgrims of course while ""Strangers"" is an actual appellation given to those outside the group who were not religious or at least not part of their sect.  It is used kind of how some faiths use the word Gentile. In this show, the word Stranger is used in numerous instances referring to anyone such as the non-religious traveling with the pilgrims on the Mayflower, the Englishmen arriving on the ship Fortune, or even the Native Americans.  The word is used very specifically toward the colonists arriving on the Fortune (the ones who weren't religious) as it was in real life.  The first English spoken contact between natives and pilgrims is reported to be Samoset, who was visiting Massasoit at the time and had contact with English fishermen in what is now Main.  This is depicted in the movie, but abbreviated as he does not stay the night.  It also does not depict Samoset returning with other natives to help.  Nor does it depict Samoset being the one to introduce Tesquanto to the colony.  Instead, Tesquanto makes a sudden appearance to the colony much like Samoset, but at a later time.  It still shows how critical Tesquanto was in showing the colony how to survive and facilitating relations.  It shows the distrust and precarious situation between all parties and the specific distrust of Massasoit for Tesquanto.  The fallout with Canonicus of the Narragonsett is depicted along with his war message.  However, the true weight of the native reaction to the strong reply by Bradford (and subsequent Canonicus reconciliation) was really not shown.  These are just a few examples and I am sure there are a few more.  My intent is to simply describe some of the changes and let the reader decide how important they are to you.

FINAL THOUGHTS:  This is not a Hollywood movie, nor is it a documentary.  It doesn't move at a break neck pace, but it does engage.  If the story interests you I suggest a rental or inexpensive purchase.",1455321600,16,4677,4.853535353535354

7516299,5,B017RR6JKI,"Since Thanksgiving is here again;this is WELL BEYOND a historical refresher! The accuracy and personal interaction between the films characters is excellent! Though I'm not Algonquin;Cherokee....I'm pretty,knowledgeable of Native American history....and this film is realistic in it's portrayal of American Indians as complex indivduals. Not noble savages,but people with agendas,societal aspirations,preduices',and a love for their immediate families....sometimes,above the loyalties to their tribal allies. Simply put:Watch it.

7516333,1,B017RR6JKI,"The show itself is great. But here's why I'm giving it 1 star: this is a miniseries event about the earliest European immigrants to land on North American shores (ok, excepting vikings and Jamestown), and it's not available in Spanish. Not dubbed, not with subtitles, nothing. Which is a really damn big oversight for a show about our foundational national myth released in 2016 in a country that is bilingual.",1473811200,,410,4.871428571428571
7516334,5,B017RR6JKI,"I greatly enjoyed this video. The costumes, settings, and dialogue in the (apparently) original Indian language (with some French as you would expect) were awesome.

I don't know how they could have made it more accurate and still kept it interesting and under 3 1/2 hours. I am not an expert, but I have read a little about the mayflower; I was watching for inaccuracies and I found none. (I am sure there were some; I just wasn't sharp enough to see them.) Important contested facts were left contested, as they should have been (i.e. Squanto's death).

As a conservative libertarian, I found no attempts at revisionist history, nor did I find attempts to glorify the pilgrims or the historical characters.

It was a fun history lesson.",1473292800,4,738,4.7952755905511815
7516335,5,B017RR6JKI,My hubby and I enjoyed this movie very much and what made it even more interesting is the fact that one of the main characters is an ancestor of mine.,1470528000,2,150,4.033333333333333
7516336,5,B017RR6JKI,"America will never change. I bought this movie because of actor Michael Greyeyes. It seems like they never list the Native American Actors to even this movie. Great acting by Michael Greyeyes, Tanaka Means, Kalani Queypo and Raoul Trujillo in this period movie. Give credit where it is due. Great movie besides the pilgrims always having clean clothes and so much bullets for their guns in that time period, yet they did not have enough food.

7516340,4,B017RR6JKI,"This version of the Mayflower story is a bit different than the other ones I've seen in that it focuses on the psychological and political aspects of survival. It attempts to paint a more realistic or grey picture of events than being one sided. It feels like a documentary, but it's not. It doesn't feel like a drama either though. It's a bit of a slow 3 hours, but it's good. You just have to be in the right mood for it and bring your own juice because it doesn't carry you anywhere. It makes you walk on your own two feet.",1463184000,3,526,4.166666666666667
7516351,5,B017RR6JKI,"This three hour video can divide into three parts. 1) Voyage on the Mayflower, 2) Squanto and the Natives, 3) Arrival of the English.

The story starts with the pilgrims climbing on the mayflower. Horrible conditions (many deaths), mainly caused by poor planning by the saints. God will provide. He didnt.

(The two hour documentary, 'The Pilgrims', by Ric Burns, provides more background.)

Highlights the conflict between the two groups, the 'Separatists' (saints) and the non-believers (strangers). The different reactions and different conclusions to the same events makes for good drama.

Presents the signing of the mayflower compact and why it was needed. Throughout the story it is shown how this agreement controls the decisions and conduct of this small group. Shows first winter and the suffering (horrible) when about half died.

Presents the decision to abandon primitive communism (from reading Plato) to each family keeping what they plant. The Bible principal -  Reap what you sow is applied. Big improvement.

Only with the intervention of Squanto, a native who spoke English, did conditions improve. Squanto had been captured and taken to England and Spain (crosses Atlantic four times). He had returned. Later convinced the Wampanoag to form a military alliance with the English against the Nagasserert. Massasoit, sachem, sent Squanto to live and help the English.

The role of Squanto, and questions about his motives and goals provide the drama for a large part of this story. Is he trying to start war? He explains to Bradford as he lays dying:

Do you know what my name Tisquanto means? Is means rage. I returned from England and my people were gone!

The English had brought disease that killed them all.

One outstanding facet of this story is the extensive presentation of the intertribal political struggle. The personal animosity of Massasoit of the Wampanoag and Canieious of the Narongessaet, and the determination of Massasoit to break free, adds insight. Shows the settlers problems are just a small part of a larger conflict.

Extended scenes of native leaders arguing about what to do with the English. This presented in their language with English subtitles. Really provides authenticity!

Fascinating!

Presents the arrival of another group of English. No saints just strangers. Immoral, selfish, unprincipled, and well . . . just stupid. Plymouth finally expelles them to their own efforts. They fail.
After the death of Carver, Bradford leads the settlers. His integrity, determination, faith and judgment impact the group for fifty years. The conflict because of the two groups, saints and strangers, require constant effort to keep a consensus. Bradford succeeds.

Interesting drama.",1462665600,14,2724,5.2877030162412995

The storyline is ""intense"" in places creating drama to hold interest most likely.  Overall however it is a very well-written piece of American history, summarized of course, but still conveying the challenges all groups in its time frame had to face and the courage and faith they brought to the task.",1460073600,2,448,5.371428571428571

7516355,5,B017RR6JKI,"Since I am a member of the  Society of Mayflower Descendants and have read the book, ""Saints and Strangers,"" I was intensely interested in how the story would be portrayed on the big screen. I thought the cast was well selected for the people they portrayed and was pleased that they used a linguist for the Native American language. The DVD was not an exact interpretation of the original book, but close enough to get the feel for some of the tension the real story must have had.  Bradford and Squanto were my favorites.  Sometimes history is not pretty and the ever-conquering wave of white immigrants was never a happy ending for the Native Americans.  But the fact that Bradford forged a peace that lasted for 50 years wi the local natives says a good deal about his character. I liked the costumes for all the characters and the setting.  I really loved this DVD and have watched it at least 4 times.",1459209600,17,907,4.539877300613497
