6124071,5,B00GY3S5AY,"Excellent show! This is rated MA because of the violence & nudity. The disk has a number of extras on it beyond the usual trailers.  The story picks up immediately after the second episode without any transition so if you want to know what is going on you need to watch the first two episodes/show.  Rune finally puts the rest the memories and enemies that have attacked her and finds purpose in her life. There is an epic battle between Rune and Boiled. The makers of the film have compressed the story line in the book, which improves the pacing immensely, but which leaves a few logic holes you might wonder about.  For example, the book tells how, exactly she beat the second blackjack dealer and how she penetrated the impenetrable shield that Boiled had.

FYI, the author has a 35 page short story of an episode with Dr. Easter, Oeufcoque, and Boiled which takes place before Boiled went bad that is available for free on iBooks for your iPad.  I don't know if Amazon has it anywhere.",1396310400,5,990,4.53932584269663
6124072,5,B00GY3S5AY,"What an ending!  Damn good entertainment.  Probably the best executed, most original anime I've seen in a long time.  Great character development, wonderful conclusion to the story.  Wraps everything up, gives the characters the growth they need and the viewers the conclusion they want.  A rare combination.  Go see this, it's a work of art :)",1396051200,5,344,5.053571428571429
6124073,5,B00GY3S5AY,"Mardock Scramble has been a great ride...  It's been once of the most visceral storytellings I've ever experienced.  There's the criminal underworld, corrupt officials, human depravity, and broken characters.  The story is violent, sexual, reflecting, and gives a perfect picture of the despair inside a person whose been abandoned by the world.  The viewer feels not only this despair, but also the bleak and often fleeting hope for redemption.  The animation is beautiful film noir (I fell in love after the first frame of the first movie), and the soundtrack--particularly the choice of ""Amazing Grace"" at the end of the first movie and repeated during this third--is exceptional.  Personally, I loved the first movie, but I was a little let down by the second one...  (I thought the Eden scenes were interesting, but didn't have the emotional impact of the first movie or of the casino scenes).  The Third Exhaust is a perfect ending to the story.

The first half of the Third Exhaust finishes the casino heist of the second movie.  I had to pause the movie after this part to take everything in; it's excellent.  After recovering Shell's lost memories, they proceed to wrap up Balot's case.

Mardock Scamble is a story of fallenness, despair, and little-by-little... redemption.  Unlike stories with a perfect hero who completely saves the day; it's a real story of the battle just to get through life, and maybe come out a little bit better.  The story is difficult to watch, but to anyone who has the stomach for it, I highly recommend it.",1386201600,16,1546,4.8961538461538465

8628599,5,B00GY3S5AY,"The Mardock Scramble series is phenomenal.  The animation quality is top notch as is the action sequences.  This series has everything: gambling, fighting, computer hacking, police investigations, etc.  The list goes on.  The series is reminiscent of Battle Angel Alita and Ghost in the Shell.
Overall, if you are looking for a short series then please look no further.  Three movies no 26 or 50 episode series.  Please give this a try.",1438819200,,436,4.986111111111111

8628602,4,B00GY3S5AY,"Its no masterpiece But as i have said in the past it is a dark and gritty story that is a pretty good representation of the cyber punk genre. Also at the time of the first compression's release it was one of the only new properties that stood out in the realm of modern cyber punk. while the eseest Anime to compare it to now days is psycho pass. while Mardock Scramble may not be able to stand at that level it is quiet good for the length that it is and is just good fun to watch.

Visuals-8/10 great
Sound-7/10 good
Story-7/10 good",1412035200,,534,4.134615384615385
8628603,5,B00GY3S5AY,How do you catch a murder who has no memory? This is a futuristic murder mystery. We know who the murderer is but can it be proved? Brain scans reveal nothing. It's fast paced and riveting. The dead do indeed tell a tale. this is the final volume to this story of the death of a young girl looking for her murderer and a psychotic sociopathic killer hiding in high society.,1407801600,2,373,4.267605633802817
8628604,2,B00GY3S5AY,"This series starts out very exciting and dramatic with The First Compression and the story is interesting but, the second movie The Second Combustion really slows things down and The Third Exhaust (the third movie) is out right boring. Don't waster your money on this series.

Animation Quality 5/5
Dubbing 5/5
Story 2/5

I would NOT recommend this title.",1403827200,,355,5.0
8628605,3,B00GY3S5AY,"This 3rd disc winds up the final part of the story but, for me, it seemed quite the let-down and it took forever to get there. If I had the choice again from the beginning, I probably would not get this title.",1402531200,2,209,4.0
8628606,5,B00GY3S5AY,Even though I love Sentai they don't always do a terrific dub job but this is one of the good ones. This final episode while not quite as good as the first is much better than the second.,1399939200,,187,3.9473684210526314
8628607,5,B00GY3S5AY,the movie is really good you have to watch the first two movies to understand it but it was good it's about a girl who is trying to find her killer and put a stop to him but again you have to watch the first two movies if you love anime and stories about bring killers to justice then this is for you.,1399507200,,301,3.7936507936507935
