8382424,5,B002VRNJTY,"This is a wonderful documentary on the life and work of Iannis Xenakis.

It is presented in chronologic order with rare footage on parts of Xenakis life.
It is narrated by Makis Solomos,long a good musicologist-writer of his work.
We obtained intense interesting flashpoints along thw way throughout the film interspersed with excerpts of performances of primarily solo pieces.
First is the compelling ""Charisma"" for Bb Clarinet(Lori Freedman the performer) and Violoncello(Francis Marie Uitti); a powerful piece where both instruments produce ""ugly"" sounds, threadbare in the upper altissimo registers;focused screeching; tremoli, fluttertongue.
It is clear Xenakis found the ugly the repulsive,the intense as a metaphor for existence not only in modern centuries, with this end-of-the-world-like ambiance his work often adopts but ancient civilizations. earthquakes,marauding hordes from the north equal nuclear destruction and ""pre-emptive"" wars today.

His work however is an affirmation of what control of sound through concepts,contexts of numbers-algebras can render within potential spaces in sound. His music always suggests something larger, more multi-dimensional than what it is or implies in content and shape. Roviros Manthoulis says however that beneath these violent opaque brutal surfaces you always find beauty in Xenakis, after the clouds are whisked away across borders.

Xenakis as a teenager fought in the Greek Resistance against the Nazi occupation of Greece, later the British after World War 2. This was an indelible experience, where he was hit by shrapnel in the face,leaving him with a permanent ""wound"" as he says himself for his entire existence. This ""wound"" also meant Xenakis lived in permanent exile never returning to Greece. Instead he made a life as an architect working first for Le Corbusier in Paris, then on commssion with his wife Francoise, and 2 children He continued living in Paris,while spending their summers in Corsica, where eventually they constructed a beautiful 2-level geometric white home on a hill.
Francoise was attracted to Iannis certainly for the depth and power of his music she says,as we all are;the entire world is there, if you know where to look and feel, she says,Prior to this we hear the excellent cellist Christophe Roy,who plays excerpts from the incredible cello solo ""Nomos Alpha"".

Francoise Xenakis says you feel the overwhelming power in his orchestral pieces which she prefers this intense overwhelming power of life the physical dimensions of time and space controlled in numbers. This was she says as he lived his life He would often climb the hills in Corsica there at the hottest part of the day, or going in the water in kayak during a storm.  It is all there she says in the orchestra, the lament of humanity, the fragility of what we are and how we become constituted.

Composers who knew him also reflect on how his music became indelible points of thought and concept,how his music situated modernity with ancient thinking;numbers,densities, timbre,clouds of sounds, arborescences; as Georges Aperghis relates, a composer who writes brilliantly for voices unaccompanied. This primordial approach to timbre and its construction is a focal point, as Francois-Bernard Mache says;and Gerard Pape speaks about ""Pithoprakta"" with the graphic representation of what was to become the orchestral score.

We also find here excerpts of Xenakis speaking himself in Paris at the performance of Les Polytopes, Diotopes;at the Pompidou Centre in Paris. This was with thousands of elliptical lights, streaming in seconds of time a sequence on and off, to create a motion in space.
Another was at the site of ancient ruins where a performance was to take place. Here we see Xenakis walking in the aisles, in a bright yellow short sleeves shirt, blending in to the surroundings. Also incredible vistas, panoramas of Corsica, from his home on cloudy days as well as bright illuminations.

It was incredible to see the marked up score in red and blue pencil,of ""Metastasis"".

Many of these speakers relate how Xenakis taught the limitations of the physical universe in music, He did this through notation.

Sharon Kanach also situates Xenakis oeuvre quite well, how architecture influenced the constructions of music,how he learned of the tremendous waste of glass in India in the Seventies, where he thought of a way a construction to utilize this glass in architecture.

Others solos played here are all by well-seasoned players in the modern and Xenakis, as the trombonist Benny Sluchin playing outdoors by the river Seine in Paris ""Keren"" for trombone solo ancient sounding yet filled with modern multiphonics as stopping parenthetical points in the work.
Harpsichordist Elisabeth Chojnacka recalls an outdoor performance of ""Naama"", where Xenakis had to anchor the instrument in the ground. She speaks and plays quite well not only on ""Naama"" but working with Xenakis, and points of musicality you always find in his music; Sylvio Gualda also plays also outdoors ""Psappha"" solo percussion, bells, metal cylinders, bass drums and floor tom-toms; This is an unrelenting work, again filled with power and brutality.

We then get an excerpt of a theatre piece,live performance of ""Oresteia"" by Xenakis;We find great sky-blue,oyster blue stage towers where a dancer hooked to a bunjee cord dances within it across ropes made like a cage; the loss of freedom is apparent, or freedom is allowed only within the tower. The speaker-singer in Spiros Sakkas, I prefer less all of Xenakis theatre dramatic pieces,, the power of the sound Xenakis constructs so painfully, is somewhat tamed and controlled forced into spaces and out of the conceptual contexts he builds with his formalizing theories of sound and space, the sounds and moments that they do not fit into.
I prefer the less stage bound,more abstract ""Nuits"" for multiple voices without instruments. This was a piece Xenakis did dedicate to the tortured in Iran under Shah Pahlevi although the government in Tehran had commissioned it.

Throughout the film we hear Xenakis electronic music interspersed as ""La Legende d'Eer"", the opening barge we hear ""Bohor 1"",musique concrete-like piece.",1287273600,5,6212,5.313645621181263
