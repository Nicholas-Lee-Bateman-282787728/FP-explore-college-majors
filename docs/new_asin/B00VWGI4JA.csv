8711433,3,B00VWGI4JA,I found this DVD being advertised in an educational booklet and decided to purchase one for my  third grade music class. The DVD starts off with the history of music concerning black Americans and slavery. Some of the picture shown  could be better suited for a classroom but are appropriate for older grades. I found the DVD to go off topic in the 20s when the narrator discusses prohibition and organize crime to an excessive extent.  Other pictures have women in low cut shirts and people holding cigarettes. There could have been much better decisions made about what pictures to use especially since this is designed for a classroom. I will have to do lots of fast forwarding but will be able to use it .,1482019200,2,709,4.611111111111111
