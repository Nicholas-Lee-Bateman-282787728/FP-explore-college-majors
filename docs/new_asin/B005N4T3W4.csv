8480168,5,B005N4T3W4,"When humanity descended from the sky they brought the Testament. A guideline that everyone must follow if they are to return to the heavens. In their world Japan is the only habitable country. Many different factions vie for power, and fight to protect the land they live on. Each group has an ultimate weapon called the Armor of Deadly Sins. The greatest threat is not the Armor though. The Testament ends abruptly, and this is the last year chronicled. Tori Aoi and his friends at the Aerial Metropolitan Ship Musashi will fight for the future and try to save Horizon. What or who is Horizon anyway? Is it worth fighting for? Is it worth dying for?

I bought this anime when it came out. There were no reviews or information on it yet. I was quite surprised. The first episode had me laughing out loud. At that time I could also see signs of a dramatic story in the works as well. There is an excellent mixture of comedy, drama, action, and suspense, not to mention boat loads of fan service. Most of the chicks are totally stacked, and the main character likes to run around fondling them and pulling their pants down. Along with those things this series also flaunts an amazing English vocal cast, high quality animation, and great character designs. It's got some unique themes as well as some typical anime hijinks. If I had to give you a frame of reference I would say this series very much reminds me of Infinite Stratos. I think I can see a little bit of Shattered Angels type stuff in here too. I have seen some pretty good animes come out in 2012. This series is no exception. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.

P.S. I'll give you a tidbit. Horizon is the name of the girl on the Blu-ray case cover.",1355443200,2,1713,4.400630914826499
