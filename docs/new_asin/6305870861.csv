7897735,5,6305870861,"I bought a CD of Blues From the Rain Forest around 1990. I made several cassette copies that I wore. Now the CD is in bad shape... I was quite surprised to find this DVD version for less than the CD on Amazon! I would have paid 3X the price for just the audio portion of this DVD.  This DVD contains DVD-A versions of all the music from the CD plus a whole lot more. There's a live video of Merl and Jerry in San Francisco After Dark, a video about the Amazonian rainforest, and an entire live performance by Merl Saunders and his band.

The DVD authoring is a very 1999 with links to websites that no longer exist and a menu that looks like it was designed by an intern. But I didn't buy this disk for the menus or the links. Now I just need to decide how to best digitize the DVD-A!",1427500800,,784,4.019230769230769
7897736,5,6305870861,"This a great, yet obscure Merl Saunders CD featuring Jetrry Garcia. It has some wonderful intuitive interaction betwrr Merl and Jerry. A nice set of songs all done in one take.",1366416000,,176,4.709677419354839
7897737,4,6305870861,"This DvD is loaded with great music.
If you're buying it to see Jerry Garcia in action, there are many others out there which will give better/ longer footage.
However, not only is this a good disc of Saunders' music but it serves as a very cool documentary to life and culture of the Amazon region as well.

For the price, this is definatly a good buy!",1294963200,,353,4.268656716417911
7897738,5,6305870861,"Another version of this disc, by the legendary Mobile Fidelity Soundlabs, was the first (and sadly last) DVD release by this studio. After 22 years of producing audiophile recordings and gold CD's, MFSL released this disc late in 1999 shortly before they had to close due to a factory shipping issue that made them decide it was better to close. That makes that version of this DVD probably the rarest one around.",960854400,2,413,4.75
