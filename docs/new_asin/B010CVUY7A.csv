7308992,5,B010CVUY7A,Love it,1444608000,,7,3.0
7308993,4,B010CVUY7A,"I hate to be the one to break the 5 star trend on this show because I know there will be people who will ignore it for that reason, but I feel there's reason I need to say this.

I personally love this show. When I first saw this show, I had incredibly high hopes for it. I will say that as it went on, there were points where I felt disappointed, such as how the female protagonist ends up going from being the responsible cool type to the one who gets repeatedly teased and embarrassed.

That said, I felt like the dub managed to pull this off in a less jarring manor. As well, I've learned that the final 2 episodes combine cover as much of the manga as the first 10 episodes combined. This leaves a lot of information glossed over, and while I think the show handles it very well considering that fact, it is something that will annoy some people.

In the end, I bought this almost purely for the dub, as it ended up being a show that initially disappointed me. It starts with an amount of promise that I feel very very few shows can actually deliver on; however, it was a show that would continue to pop up in my head to this day. Realizing how much I wanted to go back and give this show a second chance, a realistic chance, I went back and purchased it off of rightstuf, and I can say, I was not disappointed a second time.

This show has its flaws. Some of the characters are a bit too easily wooed and the series becomes very harem-esk, and the ending can be incredibly disappointing for some, especially if you dislike when shows return to a status quo sort of ending, but it has some amazing fights, challenges, art and music that really sells its mood and I personally think the dub is also one of Sentai's better works. Maybe some will disagree with me on that, as I have gotten fairly use to the odd voices and ones some people would flat out consider bad, but I admire what Sentai has overall put together here.

If you like shows with darker themes, heroes that utilize strategy and occasional luck or hidden potential, but also has its fair share of humorous moments, you will like this show. You also do need to be okay with moments or nudity and a bit of a reliance on sexual humor, but if that doesn't sound off-putting for you, you should like this show. It's a solid choice",1444608000,10,2295,4.254587155963303
7308994,5,B010CVUY7A,"I am truely glad to enjoy the Brynhildr in the Darkness in English!
I had already bought a Japanese Licensors Edition of the Brynhildr in the Darkness, irrationally higher-priced than this English and Japanese complete version though, I thought buying such a high-priced edition is a kind of way to show your supporting your local Sheriff stuff.  And I like this show very much. And naturally I can understand the Japanese lines very well because I am a Japanese native speaker. However you want to listen to Ms. Kana Tachibana, the future vision telling witch, how she speaks like in English as well, if you are fond of the show. At least I can understand English better than French. Accordingly, I hesitated a little when I preordered this version, because I wondered if the version were English-dubbed or English-subtitled only?  English-dubbed or only English-subtitled means whether this American version has some additional vales or not, to some of the Japanese consumers. Not all the Japanese consumers and anime-buffs looks for the cheaper version in this Brynhildr in the Darkness eddition.
Here, I wrote for the sake of the Japanese Local Sheriffs as well, namely the licensor, producers, wrght-owners and such of the Brynhildr in the Darknes.

Again I am truely glad to enjoy the Brynhildr in the Darkness in English!
I am prepared to buy a French-dubbed version as well if the French supply one in the future. And they also supply at irrationally high priced like in Japan ,however, if the German provide their German-dubbed version into the market, I would like to buy one and listen to the lines of Ms. Kazumi Schlierenzauer, the CP skilled witch, who speaks in the Osaka, Japan accents in the Japanese language original.

Thank you and Arigatou-gozaimasita.",1444262400,5,1772,4.996610169491525
7308995,5,B010CVUY7A,If you like Elfen lied you'll love this anime. It's pretty thought provoking at the same time it is very enjoyable as well. The biggest gripe most people have about it is that it was too short. To be honest it is. It definitely needed at least 24 episodes for it to be fully developed. Just like the girls(lol). Trust me on this one I think you will enjoy it if you like darker toned themes.,1444089600,9,391,4.157894736842105

7309033,4,B010CVUY7A,It's dark show that kind of loses it's steam by the time you get the ep 11 and 12. Wish it was longer but it still managed to wrap things and give the characters closer. 7.8/10,1453593600,,176,3.9166666666666665
7309034,5,B010CVUY7A,I was not sure I would have like it. It turn out to be very good story. Artwork was good to. There was 2 girls who died. Wish they could have live. One was at the lake and the other one was the mind control. At least both bad guys died.,1453075200,,236,3.6470588235294117
7309035,3,B010CVUY7A,"I just wanted to add my two cents for the show, and no I don't follow the manga.  The opening song is great but and the rest of the series had such great promise.  As everyone mentions its very similar to Elfen Lied, which is a romance with a lot of blood and death.  This show for me ends up just being ok, I think that if it weren't for episodes 9 & 10, which kind of take the show in your typical harem episode after someone just died!!!  Also, they changed the opening song to some punk metal music which just didn't fit in my opinion, put in some Baby Metal and it would have worked more.  I think what sells people on the show is that it kind of ends on a good and sort of twisted note.  Would I watch it again?  Probally not but i did like watching it the first time around.",1452384000,3,781,3.9363057324840764

7309044,5,B010CVUY7A,"Definitely one of my favorite series to come out in recent years. The dark and twisted story of these ""magical"" girls is very reminiscent of Madoka Magica meets Elfen Lied. While the story has it's flaws and the obvious tropes of a harem-style anime, it brings a lot to the table that has a new feel to it. Mainly, the main character isn't completely dense. The story has its moments of romance and sorrow, but not so overbearing as to detract from the main plot points.

Overall, I'd recommend this series to any one of my friends as a good series to follow. Hoping for a second season!",1445644800,4,587,4.435185185185185
7309045,5,B010CVUY7A,"Seriously underrated in my opinion. And like another reviewer mentioned, if you enjoyed Elfen Lied (even in the slightest) you'll enjoy Brynhilder as well. As for the rest (i.e. reviewing like a movie critic) that part is up to you. We all have stuff we like, love, hate, etc. And I refuse to push out a story line from start to finish before anyone gets a chance to watch for themselves...so my reviews are more so just a little chatter about the series before you decide whether or not to watch for yourself. :-)

First, while I still believe it deserves my 5 stars, we should agree that almost nothing is perfect across the board. And for BITD there are still a couple scenes where I believe what's happening between them can leave a bit of an ""off taste"" (for lack of a better phrase) regarding the girls and their powers. Specifically their limitations, at least in my opinion.

However, what they can do and accomplish (especially as a team) is 99% of the time, pretty incredible. Unfortunately, the side effects of using their ""magic"" doesn't ONLY come at a cost, which of course isn't uncommon in the magic world - there's always a cost. But here, it can not only prove to come with a cost, but just as easily it can come with a true detriment. And while I understand why and the reasons behind most of what they were going for during the series' inception, it most definitely makes the girls overly pitiable. Or did for me anyway. (I don't mind a case of ""the feels"" by any stretch - but there were a few times during BITD when you almost can't help but feel AWFUL for them. But no spoiling it - you'll see if/when you watch!) :-)

Nevertheless I found it very easy to like the characters across the board. It wasn't dull or boring at any time and the English cast brought their A-Games!! I enjoyed the performances very much. Their powers were a broad ""grab-bag"" and not just a bunch of girls with identical 'enhancements' simply fighting to the death. This is also a huge cause for them to start working together / learning how to ensure they all live longer, etc.

At the end of the day, if you like violence, some magic, a quasi-harem with a couple of ultra-horny ladies, the quintessential villain, and more, then watch BITD. I don't think you can go wrong. Just my 2 cents! :-)",1445299200,8,2292,4.463007159904534

A reason why is there are multiple scenes that's slightly different, and especially episode 11 because the part where the protagonist discovers the true identity of his heroine gives off a more heart-touching feeling combined with the ending theme.
