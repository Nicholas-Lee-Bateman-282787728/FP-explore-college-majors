4111978,3,B003DQXETM,"I just want to emphasize something the first reviewer mentioned: all these stories are remakes of the American series. They are not just ""based on"" the American episodes, they are almost scene-for-scene, line-for-line the same (with the appropriate English slang and legal jargon substituted, of course). So if you're a big fan of the American series, you already know the plot, the characters, the twists and turns and the outcome.
At least for me, a different setting does not make it worth while to purchase the same stories on disc a second time.",1275955200,19,550,4.924731182795699
4111979,5,B003DQXETM,The plots are new and are much more like Law and Order SUV plots than the original Law and Order. Great cast and interesting to see how UK laws can be different from US laws.,1466121600,,174,4.0

4111986,3,B003DQXETM,"My God, these folks actually speak English! I only speak English in American! Actually I enjoy the characters and seeing the different ways Brits see things, but I am a little disappointed in the scripts. Not that they weren't as nail biting as our own American version of Law and Order, but that they were the SAME scripts from our own American version. They simply rewrote them to fit this cast of characters and the British lifestyle. If the scripts had been more 'original' I would have given this show a 4, no doubt. Perhaps they move away from American rewrote scripts in later seasons, I do hope so.",1427068800,2,606,4.568807339449541
4111987,3,B003DQXETM,did not have enough drama for me it was too lame. for I like action and this did not give it in its show. for its ok but I had to watch to first season. that is all,1425945600,,164,3.3421052631578947

4111989,5,B003DQXETM,This is an excellent Brittish version of the original Law & Order. It follows the same format as the American version. I hope BBC releases additional seasons for Region 1 DVDs.,1414627200,,176,4.709677419354839

4111995,5,B003DQXETM,"I thought every episode hit the heart and the acting was excellent .  I never watched much of the original series but Season 1 and 2 I would recommend to anyone,",1399334400,,161,4.193548387096774
4111996,5,B003DQXETM,Watched this series quick as we enjoyed it so much. Great cast and a unique look at another countries justice system.,1396828800,,117,4.619047619047619
4111997,4,B003DQXETM,"This is an excellent series, but be very careful when ordering and check the differences between Series One (or Two Or Three) and Season One (or Two or Three). I bought what I thought were 3 different sets with different episodes and ended up with all of them being basically the same episodes. It would have been more helpful if each set would list the names of each episode on the DVD, that way you could avoid unnecessary duplication and waste of money. Then I found that we could watch a lot of the episodes on YouTube. Of course the DVDs are much sharper, but I was extremely disappointed in purchasing duplicates.",1373414400,4,619,4.535714285714286
4111998,5,B003DQXETM,Another example of great British TV.  Superb casting. Interesting stories. If you like British TV then you'll find this series enjoyable and worth your while. I do recommend it.,1372896000,,177,5.103448275862069
4111999,5,B003DQXETM,"Since I am a big fan of the original Law and Order Series, I was thrilled with the UK version and its' variations on the original plots. The DVDs have brought me so much pleasure...I can watch them whenever I choose!",1372464000,,216,4.2926829268292686
4112000,1,B003DQXETM,"As some other reviewers have already pointed out, this series rehashes stories from the US Law & Order series.  Many of the stories are exactly the same scene by scene but a few have some variations from the US series.  I bought this set because Law & Order UK has, to my knowledge, never been shown on US TV. I am a big fan of Law & Order and wanted more of it.  This isn't it.  One would think that there is enough crime in London to have allowed the series to use original stories, especially since British TV seasons are shorter than their American counterparts.  We Americans should not buy this drivel, and the British TV watching public should cry fraud for being subjected to rehashed American stories.  Even though it got cancelled right away, Law & Order Trial by Jury was considerably better than Law & Order UK because at least the stories were original.",1370131200,3,866,4.484076433121019
4112001,4,B003DQXETM,"Law & Order here is the USA and the one in the UK are similar yet so different. Mostly in the use of language, but you are used to that the show is great. If Law & Oder fans of the USA version wants to see something different then I would recommend Law and Order UK.",1362528000,,266,3.767857142857143
4112002,5,B003DQXETM,Love this show & the DVD! I highly recommend it - you won't be disappointed. Very interesting to learn more about the differences between the US and UK legal systems.,1358380800,,166,4.566666666666666
4112003,5,B003DQXETM,I love this series and would like to be able to view all series.  Only seies One and Two are available.,1357430400,,103,3.9047619047619047
4112004,5,B003DQXETM,I love Brittish shows and this is one of my favorite Law and Order shows on tv never a dull moment on it,1356998400,,104,3.5652173913043477
4112005,5,B003DQXETM,I wish that BBC America hadn't cancelled this great program. The Law & Order franchise from Britain was becoming a favorite of mine. I wish BBC would bring this great series back for American fans to enjoy once again.,1354924800,2,217,4.589743589743589

4112007,5,B003DQXETM,"I love the Law & Order and SVU shows in the US, love British drama, so I was really looking forward to L&O, UK, and I was not disappointed.  Interesting perspective on crime investigation and Crown Prosecution Service in the UK. Great performances by all principals.

Hear Ye...Hear Ye...brilliant television is a story told dam well. Be well. Can't wait to order Amazon !!!
Have fun :)",1314748800,,411,4.6438356164383565
4112010,5,B003DQXETM,"As an ardent Law and Order fan of the first order, I too had my doubts as to how well this series would crossover. My fears disapeared in the viewing of the first season.
All involved are to be congratulated on making this series uniquely its own. For the seasoned Law and Order fan, there are most certainly similarities, but, the characterizations are fresh and totally different from their US counterparts. I anxiously await the availability of subsequent seasons on DVD!!!",1311552000,8,476,4.888888888888889
4112011,5,B003DQXETM,"Great 'remake', if one can say so, because there are big differences. The acting, for instance, transforms the show into something new - Ben Daniels, for one, let us feel his suffering for the causes all the way from the UK. I wish my country were provided with such judicial cleanliness. The pace is excellent, keeps you on edge all the time, the camera movements make you dizzy, beautiful european locations, some the same as MI-5 (Spooks) with a different angle, and, of course, the wigs and costumes. Loved it! When is the next one coming to DVD or Blu-Ray?",1310169600,5,561,4.62
4112012,5,B003DQXETM,"I absolutely love this series! It wasn't until after I had finished all of the seasons that I read that the episodes for this series were adaptations of US episodes. I didn't ever get into the US version of this series, not one of them (though I have watched episodes of each 'brand' here and there), but the UK version was very easy for me to get into. I had finished all of the seasons before I knew it. Freema Agyeman and Ben Daniels are such a great pairing. The chemistry between their two characters is amazing.

Many people like to knock on the way that the British courts are run but I for one find it intriguing that they continue to run their courts in the traditional manor.

Another great thing about this series is getting to learn a little bit about the way of life in the UK. I have always had a fascination with the UK yet it wasn't until watching this series that I ever learned about their CCTV.

If you like the US version of this series, you should definitely give this one a try. You won't be disappointed!",1308355200,,1027,4.283505154639175
4112013,5,B003DQXETM,"I've been a Law and Order fan, particularly of the first ten seasons for a longtime.  And a fan of British drama and comedy, too.  This DVD set was such a treat for me, I truly enjoyed it!  Too bad that this wasn't released ten years earlier so that Lenny and Reynaldo could visit them as they did on Homicide: Life on the Street. I can't wait for L&O UK 2.",1308009600,3,357,4.0
4112014,5,B003DQXETM,"I bought the set with some appehention because I thought that it will be the standard Law & Order bit with a british accent.  Was I wrong!!!  The characters are strong, it is refreshingly whithin the Law & Order line but still it has a personality of it's own.  Highly recomend that you buy it",1307664000,2,293,4.290909090909091
4112015,3,B003DQXETM,"I'v always greatly enjoyed the L&O series. Fast paced, intriguing stories, likeable characters, a nice mix of police procedural and courtroom fireworks, vibrant in it's energy, and geared towards adults. Generally emotionally envolving, and often cleverly presented to provide both sides to a case, which could lead to afterward discussion (and some home-based fireworks). Contrary to many reviewers, I find the UK version, especially in an emotional way, watered down weak tea. The police are dull, the courtroom drama non-existant. The presentation seems lifeless and un-engaging. Originally I really looked forward to seeing this, a UK version. I even bought the box set retail at a local store, instead of using the benefit of Amazon. I was let down.",1307318400,2,754,5.34453781512605
4112016,5,B003DQXETM,"This is a really great series. I liked the American version very much, but I find that I like the UK series even more - maybe it's the wigs.

How about those wigs and robes that the lawyers wear? I think the wigs and robes of the judges are even more ""something"". I am an American lawyer, and I am glad that we did not retain this UK custom in our courts. Still, they do work with a British accent it seems.

The detectives make an interesting pair - one older, one younger - a real contrast, but they complement each other well to make a good team. Their boss is a lady as in the American series; she has a small part, yet is still a great character.

The prosecutor and his boss make a good pair too. The former is really driven and if he can't get a conviction one way, seems to more or less always find another way. The latter has a great Scottish accent.

If the young lady who plays the assistant prosecutor looks familiar, then there is a good chance that you are a Dr. Who fan. She played Dr. Who's sidekick in the third series of the Dr. Who revival. Personally, I think she is better suited for the part she plays in the Law and Order UK series - she was OK on Dr. Who, but better on Law and Order UK.

It is said that the UK series is a copy of the American - but putting the stories into a British context. Maybe that is true, but I don't think it makes the series here any less. The stories/cases are always a bit shocking and thought provoking.

I'd give it a try if you like crime dramas. If nothing else you get to see the wigs in action - they are especially worth looking for on female barristers.",1304294400,,1615,4.062893081761007
4112017,5,B003DQXETM,"Didn't like original L&O, but do like SVU and Criminal Intent, but this one is amazing! Probably because I lived in England and like the BBC and Channel 4. Love Jamie Bamber from Galactica too.",1304035200,,193,4.542857142857143
4112018,5,B003DQXETM,"We couldn't wait to get this DVD, especially since we didn't know that the Brits had their own series.  We have enjoyed it but can't help comparing it to L&O USA as it is a little different.  Instead of the DA it's the Crown Prosecutors in their wigs.  Very enjoyable and recommend it for people who enjoy BBC series and movies as we do.",1301875200,,337,4.234375
4112019,4,B003DQXETM,"As some other reviewer noted, this series' episodes are pretty much very close adaptations (in terms of dialogue and plot) of episodes from the original series.  I'm giving this four stars because the acting in the series seems to be up to the standard of the original series and those stories are all good. But I can't help but think this is not something that is really intended for fans of the original New York City-based series and the American market in general.

But if you're British or have never seen any of the original show's episodes, you'll probably like this series.  But since I've seen nearly all the originals and remember all the plots, ""Law and Order UK"" isn't for me.",1300579200,,688,4.622950819672131
4112020,5,B003DQXETM,"While I've been a Law and Order junkie for over 6 years, these new British episodes add new flavor to the L&O series.  My husband and I tivo these every week and love to watch each program.  All of the characters seem more caring and personable than their US counterparts, it seems to us!",1299628800,,288,4.314814814814815
4112021,5,B003DQXETM,I am a fan of the original and even they some of the episodes seem reused from original law and order I still loved it still was entertain. Just needed to get use to certain terms of their court system but doesn't matter. Great show.,1297382400,,233,4.2
4112022,5,B003DQXETM,"Excellent series...very entertaining!  DVD quality is very good and my shipment was received within 3-4 days after I placed my order.  Even though each episode in the UK series is modeled directly after the equivalent American episode, you never get the feeling that you're watching a re-run or a ""knock-off"" copy of the original.",1295222400,,330,5.092592592592593
4112023,5,B003DQXETM,"i loved law and order, but after watching this, i have to admit the english version is better.

4112024,5,B003DQXETM,"I recently placed an order for Law and Order UK, was pretty sure I  picked item that was compatible for the United States, but received item unable to play. This was given as a gift so there were weeks between purchase and surfacing the problem to RareConsoles. A quick email to them and they sent me a replacement immediately with no hassle. I was very impressed.",1294531200,,364,4.515151515151516
4112025,1,B003DQXETM,"When I saw the first four episodes in this set, it was very clear to me that the company had just used the plots and story lines of the original L&O series and simply transposed them into the UK environment with wigs and British accents. Since I had seen virtually all of the first decade or two of L&O episodes, it was almost instantly apparent to me what was going to happen and how it would end up.  I wanted to see original programming in the L&O style and not exactly the same programs rehashed with different actors.  The style and accents are different as you go from Manhattan to London, but the plot and the story are virtually the same. I'm not sure of how plagiarism is defined in the TV media, but for those of us in scholarly pursuits, submitting the same research paper for credit in two or three different courses is not exactly ethical.  Any real fan of L&O will be extremely disappointed by this set.",1292716800,7,917,4.382352941176471
4112026,5,B003DQXETM,"Great acting, no opening idiotic one liner joke at the scene of the crime, and missing civil rights scenes like the inevitable attempt to get a doctor to reveal privileged info (way different rules in Britain) make this series more drama and less diatribe.",1292371200,4,256,4.840909090909091
4112027,5,B003DQXETM,"This series is superb! I have watched Law & Order (U.S.A.) since it's inception and was saddened to see it end. Lucky for me I found this treasure. The actors are wonderful, the stories fresh and it is the closest to the original of all the Law & Orders. It is interesting to see stories from over the pond and realize how much all of us have in common, and yet revel in the differences. I can't speak highly enough of this cast!!",1291680000,4,430,4.192771084337349
4112028,5,B003DQXETM,"Although I am ordering this tonight, I feel like I can comment after watching a L&O UK marathon on BBC America.  I went to London last year for the first time and loved every minute there.  And I love going to NY (so the original was extra special for the NY scenes).  So, I looked forward to seeing London again.  I wasn't disappointed.  I love everything about this series.  In fact, I have to say that it is far better in some ways than the original.  These are people that we get to know.  I can't wait to see more!!",1290816000,,520,4.13
4112029,5,B003DQXETM,I found these stories to be very well done. They are equal to or perhaps better than the original Law and Order.  I am not very fond of some of the other spin offs from this series.,1290729600,2,181,3.891891891891892

4112031,5,B003DQXETM,"The UK series pulls from the best of the original L&O series, with updates and translations. Riveting stories and a bit of tourism. Fantastic acting by the main cast and the one-time players are even top notch. Can't wait for Season Two!",1289174400,4,237,4.666666666666667

4112034,5,B003DQXETM,"I'm a big fan of the whole range of Law & Order Shows and this UK version is a terrific addition to the franchise. Some say that Dick Wolfe series are ""too simple"" or ""dumbed down"" for Americans because we have such short attention spans and his shows always have a beginning, middle and an end within the 48 min episode--but I don't agree. Lots of great shows have full season story arcs (The Wire, Murder One)and I enjoy them, but Wolfe does this ""complete meal"" format better than anyone I think. Here you get a British version of L&O with 6 very strong main characters. Ben Daniels in particular is terrific as the tough, intense, ethical Crown Prosecuter. You'll probably recognise one of the Detectives Jamie Bambier, from Battle Star Galactica and he is great as the younger half of the lead investigators. What I liked about the stories was that the police department and courts work differently enough in the UK versus the US that the topics and procedures seemed fresh. Add to that bringing the British flair for drama to the stories touching on race, terrorism, abuse, corruption, and you have great British show in a very comfortable format Americans are familiar and comfortable with. I will definitely purchase season 2 when it gets to the US.",1283644800,26,1257,4.718181818181818

The actors do a fine job, but I wish the stories had not been confined to the 1 hour per episode format.  One of the things I enjoy most about UK television drama is the time they take to flesh out a story and its characters.  Too bad they adopted the US standard.",1281052800,3,365,4.041666666666667
4112038,4,B003DQXETM,"It's kind of fascinating, and fun, too, to see how they adapted the Law & Order episodes set in New York City to fit the setting in London. The British cops and prosecutors are all very polite and sensitive, but they get the job done and catch the criminal in the end, with a little humor and lots of suspense, so it's nearly as good as the original.",1279843200,4,350,4.161764705882353

8394894,4,B003DQXETM,"I genuinely enjoyed this series more than I expected. I must give everyone a caution. There are many instances where the characters use a LOT of typically and uniquely British sayings that took me a while to decode. Of course you'd expect these unique British terms in the drama but, it helps enjoyment of the story IF you understand the UK version of English.

I'm taking one star off my rating because; some of these scripts were rehashed versions of LAW & ORDER scripts that played in the USA version. You had the UK and its awesome culture as your canvas and the best you could do is rehash old USA based Law & Order scripts and replacing the legal process with the UK versions.
