8543086,2,B009NG8CAC,"Mark Knopfler is unquestionably one of the greatest UK guitarists and songwriters of all time. Unfortunately, this concert, the second live album Dire Straits released and one of their last outings before they disbanded in 1995, is very disappointing and their weakest release, along with the studio album that accompanied it, 'On Every Street'.

This album contains excerpts from one or two of the final concerts Dire Straits played in 1992. Instead of going for a double album (as they did with 'Alchemy') though, they decided to release a single disc/cassette, featuring only ten tracks.

There is no questioning that the musicianship on this concert is first rate. The opinion of some people may be that this concert is more musically elaborate than 'Alchemy' and the concerts accompanying the hugely successful 'Brothers In Arms' tour from 1985-86. Unfortunately however, the raw sound that the band produced in those concerts that made them so uplifting and enjoyable is missing here. This is a much more laboured effort, and it clearly shows as nearly all of the songs on this release, even classics such as 'Private Investigations' 'Money for Nothing' are rendered impotent. The exception is 'Romeo and Juliet' which is superior to the 'Alchemy' version and probably the best song on here. Some of Dire Straits' most popular songs that they played during this tour including 'Sultans of Swing', 'Tunnel of Love', and 'Telegraph Road' have been omitted and instead a lacklustre version of 'You and Your Friend' made its way on to the album, which further weakens this set.

The soloing on most of the tracks is excessive this time around and aside from 'Romeo and Juliet', this sadly makes 'On the Night' a genuine chore to listen to from beginning to end. Chris Whitten's drumming here is nowhere near as strong as Terry Williams, whose outstanding energetic contributions were always present from 1982 until he left the band in 1988.

This album is an unworthy successor to 1983's 'Alchemy', which apart from a few weak moments is an excellent live concert which grows on the listener. Dire Straits should be remembered in their most classic years, 1982 to 1988. Their 1985-86 world tour was fantastic, as demonstrated by the superb July 10 1985 concert at Wembley Arena, which was televised on 'The Tube' in January 1986 but sadly never officially released on album or DVD. Their performance was at the Nelson Mandela concert in 1988 also came close, and was their last truly great concert (as well as their last concert with Terry Williams as drummer).

With 'On The Night' Dire Straits sound tired and like a band nearing the end of their life. A disappointing, rather lacklustre release, which could have been a lot better. This is a shame as it ended up being Dire Straits' final world tour before they disbanded for good and Knopfler started his solo career.",1392768000,,2873,4.952282157676349
