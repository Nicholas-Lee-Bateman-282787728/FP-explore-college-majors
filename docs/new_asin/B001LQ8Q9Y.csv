As I watched the video and participated in the discussion,  the scales seemed to fall from my understanding.  I kept telling myself, if only i'd heard this before I could have avoided so much heartache.  My husband had cancer and died a few weeks after we split up,  I can't dwell on that, I move on and leave the past behind as much as I can, but it is a process.  It still bothers me that there can never be any kind of healing in that relationship.

I purchased this series because I wanted to hear the entire series and really absorb it so that my thinking was changed.  I also wanted share it with struggling married couples. I can't undo what has been done, but I can help others avoid the same mistakes I made.  I believe this series can have an impact, even if only one spouse is willing to do listen and absorb it.",1399939200,7,1001,4.221052631578948
