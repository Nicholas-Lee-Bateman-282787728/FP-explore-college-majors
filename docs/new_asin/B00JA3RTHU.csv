8649205,2,B00JA3RTHU,"Would like to give 2.5 stars for the 3 shorts in this collection that were well written, well produced and well-acted. I think many will like PDA, it was really clever and the best of this collection, sadly, it is the very last short. So, you'll have to wade through some mediocre and unfortunately bad material before viewing it. Be aware that these are comedic shorts, but not all are successfully conceived or executed. In fact, the majority are student project level and really not worth purchasing. I viewed because of my Prime sub. I was expecting a collection on the level of the series: Boys Briefs, but the inconsistent quality of this compilation is not recommended.",1480118400,,676,4.786324786324786
8649206,4,B00JA3RTHU,"The Frameline San Francisco International LGBT Film Festival annually presents a new Fun in Boys Shorts (and a companion Fun in Girls Shorts). Each year, you roll the dice and hope the new crop is good. And you attend both FIBS and FIGS because things might be better in one than the other. It all depends on the quality of the shorts submitted.

The Fun in Boys Shorts -- the DVD is a compilation of shorts from several years. I'm sure the selection is complicated by distribution rights and/or music licensing fees.

Personally, my very favorite two are:
* Bald Guy (Skallamann) -- a student's parents are worried because he is late returning home from school. The student excitedly announces to his parents that he is Gay. His mother is scandalized and horrified by what others will think. His father is surprised but interested in finding out why he thinks he's Gay. Well, the student has kissed a bald guy and that's all it took? With the chaos caused by the news, the student goes back outside and starts singing a song while dancing down the road. As he passes several groups of people, they are surprised that he's kissed a bald guy, but they join in singing and dancing. There are a few more surprises in the second half of the short. A very light, happy movie! Fun for the whole family!
* Spooners -- A Gay couple decides they finally need to replace their lumpy futon. Nelson is tasked with finding the new bed, but things have changed dramatically with extremely flashy high-tech equipment assisting with the selection while Outing him spectacularly. Whatever answer Nelson gives, the machine simultaneously 'reinterprets' the answer to be as embarrassing as possible.

The rest were pleasant and some were clever, but not to the same level as the two I mentioned above.

If, like me, you don't make great LGBT short films, attend LGBT film festivals and cheer for your favorites. Some festivals offer awards and/or prizes. Find an LGBT Film Festival near you -- or start one yourself!",1403827200,,1997,4.746397694524496
8649207,2,B00JA3RTHU,"Two stars is generous for only 2 acceptable shorts out of 7. If this is the best version of ""Fun"" that Strand and San Francisco Frameline could make, you'd be better off going out to Folsom in only your underwear because that is more fun than these boring sexless shorts! The only ""fun"" short out of 7 tries is the 1 that has subtitles called ""Bald Guy,"" a musical from Scandinavia.

Howevr, all of the American shorts are tired, tired, and exhausted. I watched ""Spooners"" last year and while its trying to be charming and had the crowd laughing, the lead actor is a wet fish and the bearded boyfriend bearly saves him from ruining it. The other five films are not entertaining at all. They're shot poorly with standard bad gay acting.  1 short is just 2 guys talking in a beige kitchen and living room and that's it, another short is just 2 guys talking on a bland street corner in LA and that's it, another is supposed to be in Alaska but it may as well have been shot in Nebraska because its mostly indoors.  Fun, right?

I don't live in San Fran anymore but I wouldnt see the shorts programs there if this is what they liked or played, Outfest is soo much better for shorts, 3 or 4 from last year come to mind easily. I'm just very shocked after some good shorts DVD releases in the last couple of years that this was so bad. I'll be selling the disc I bought soon to recope some of the money I spent on it because 1 amusing musical isn't worth keeping 5 or 6 yawn-inducing ones.  There's so much better on YouTube and Vimeo now anyway, way past the crummy gay comedies here.",1402012800,4,1579,4.285234899328859
