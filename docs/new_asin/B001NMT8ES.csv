Astonishing, is the story.
Pure driving, real hot rods and rat rods,yeah ! Watching it I felt like I want a rat rod and do a burn out.
Grabbing, this movie has real people acting, real musicians not the deja-vu famous actors or actresses cliche, we are talking about real feeling represented here, seems that many movies out there forget about sensations and humor.
Rocking Music, you have to see it and hear it, the music and the story is driving you in all at once.
Artistic, the coordinated muse of zombies and Aliens, the comic graphic turn of the story is unique.
I give my two thumps up to D.A.Sebasstian, filmmaker he has created a pure talented movie and may I say freaking cool story, I am definitely adding this filmmaker to my wish list for his next movie.",1229212800,2,807,4.534246575342466

3.5 (GREAT!) out of 5
FANTASTIC
by Paul Parcellin (2009-03-26)
2008, Un-rated, 122 minutes, Go-Kustom Films
So, what's going on in Anywhere, Washington? Lots of hot rods, zombies, and intervals of edgy rock 'n' roll, it would appear.

In case the title doesn't make it perfectly obvious, viewers will soon find that ""Hot Rod Girls"" owes a lot to probably every low-budget horror/zombie/car flick you've ever seen.

Newspaper reporter Vanessa Trojan (Lindsay Calkins) is determined to write a feature on the hot rod racing team consisting of Jo Leene Dodge (Melene Marie Brown) and her mute sidekick, Betty Petty (Kimberly Lynn Layfield). The two gals build and race street rods as good as the boys, but get no respect from the men who dominate the field. Vanessa wants to write a story that will shine the spotlight of recognition on the pair.

The movie's action abruptly shifts to a galaxy far, far away on the planet Moosha Maa, where the only words spoken are ""Moo-sha Maa"" and the meaning of each sentence is translated in subtitles. One Moosha-ite - sort of a whacky intergalactic neighbor living in a day-glow-colored suburb - is bothered by Earth's radio waves because they're ruining his TV reception. He decides to decimate Earth with a powerful ray gun. The ray's effect turns the people of Anywhere into murderous zombie-like creatures who prey on the uninitiated. In the meantime, Seattle-area bands are featured rock-video-like segments that marginally tie into the story line.

When Jo Leene is wrongly accused of a grisly crime, she goes on the lam and an extended chase takes place. The movie's title implies a soft and fluffy ending, but don't jump to conclusions. This isn't a happily-ever-after kind of flick.

The maker of ""Hot Rod Girls,"" D.A. Sebasstian, obviously delights in '50s style trash-movie aesthetics. Lots of chrome and steel and a cast of shapely babes prevail throughout. The dialogue mimics that of the tough-talking characters that older generations watched on drive-in screens across America.

The Planet Moosha Maa scenes, which are among the most fun and spontaneous parts of the film, seem to be from an entirely different movie. Throughout, the acting is often over-the-top and sometimes wooden - exactly the mixed bag we've come to expect from low-budget genre flicks.

The musical sequences seemed designed to stand alone as music videos, and their production values are of good quality. Overall, the film looks good, despite the occasional use of unnecessary graphical element here and there - washed out color, frames rendered in high contrast so that the scene looks like a cartoon - that distract from the story rather than tell it.

To be fair, this is a movie made by musicians who are admittedly taking a stab at filmmaking for the first time. You've got to admire their tenacity in getting the thing done.

That said, if they shoot a sequel I'd vote for a change of venue - say for instance, ""Hot Rod Girls of Moosha Maa""? Now those folks would have some totally radical street machines.

OL' Skool Rodz Issue #33
  Think late 1950s low-budget, campy, tongue in cheek, black and white hot rod horror B-movie, but set in `09. That's Hot Rod Girls Save The World in a nutshell. It takes place in small Anywhere, Washington, and the three main characters are named Vanessa Trojan, Jo Leene Dodge and Betty Petty. Get the point?
  Anywhere is invaded by aliens from the planet Moosha Maa. Those same two ""words"" seem to be syllables of most native words uttered by the aliens, too.
  Sometime Rodz and CKD contributor D.A. Sebasstian is the producer of the film. We featured Betty Petty's movie Model A coupe in an issue of CK Deluxe a couple of years ago.
  The acting in HRGSTW is bad, but we think that may be on purpose. The soundtrack, from KsK is good and the movie flows right along. We'd suggest watching it with friends rather than alone, because you're going to want to laugh and comment on it. And it's a hot rod movie. When's the last time we had one of those? - Alan Mayes

Street Rods and Hot Rods
  Hot Rod Girls Save the World has just been released on DVD. Maybe it should be seen on a drive-in screen, or maybe it should be broadcast on a public television station over rabbit-ear airwaves late at night to a late 1960s TV set that gets awful reception. Either way, if you intend to watch Hot Rod Girls Save the World, don't expect your typical film viewing experience.
  We mentioned more than three years ago in this space that D.A. Sebasstian, producer of the underground Seattle television show, Go-Kustom TV, was working on a B movie that featured female street racers, aliens, zombies and rockabilly music. Sebasstian, through his Go-Kustom Films, has now released Hot Rod Girls Save the World on DVD.
  As Sebasstian notes in the press release, ""We are a small film company (and real car guys) without a big Hollywood budget,"" and the film follows along the same formula. If you prefer actresses who seem to
have spent more time in a garage than a theater department, if you prefer gratuitous rockabilly scenes tossed into movies, and if you prefer your movies dance around genre lines between horror, sci-fi, mystery and just plain raucousness, then you'll enjoy this film. At least there are hot rods in it. - By Daniel Strohl
