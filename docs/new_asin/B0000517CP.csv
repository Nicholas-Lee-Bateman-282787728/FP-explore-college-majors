8200452,3,B0000517CP,"This performance is less than satisfying.  It makes long-time fans of this opera nostalgic for the Sutherland-Horne-Alexander combination.  This recording has certain visual and auditory shortcomings.  The colors are muted, with a sort of wash-out appearance.  And the sound, overall, has a muffled quality rather than an expected crispness and clarity.  The orchestral playing is acceptable but hardly inspired.  At times, the tempos are distressingly slow.  And what can one say about those costumes?  It is doubtful that any Roman official ever dressed like that!  The Druid warriors resemble shepherds rather than eager revolutionaries.",1471564800,2,640,5.723404255319149
