8031421,3,B0002SDZHA,"I felt that ""Simply Golf Back To Basics"" was a better purchase. The ""Fun To Know"" follows along as a real novice is learning how to play golf. There is no real terminology and no stretching exercise give as in the other video. If you just want a overview of the body positions and you buy the used one for the cheapest price, I will say it is a ok purchase. As the title states it is basic techniques and not much else. A few etiquette questions are answered, but nothing you could not ask someone for free. It does however advocate real golf lessons and does not try to pretend to be all you will need to be successful.",1255046400,,620,4.175
8031422,3,B0002SDZHA,"I bought this as a supplement to martial arts class and the most noticeable flaw I found in it is that the camera focuses on the instructor's face and upper body, while he's showing stances that require us to see his feet. It became very annoying when every once in a while he'd be pointing at his feet and we can't see them because the camera is on his upper body only. It would have been much more helpful otherwise.",1246752000,4,418,4.2375
8031423,5,B0002SDZHA,"Considering the series, I did not expect much & actually expected poor teaching. I was pleasantly & happily surprised.
The teacher is three-time Canadian kung fu champion Sifu Glen Doyle who shows Kung Fu Hung Gar & is passionate & gets to the point fast. He's not boring at all, & has great, fast, beautiful form. He teaches the basics such as punching, stances, kicking & explains the forms & how the work using Olympic athlete Elvis Stojlo who also has great form. He also demonstrates some basic combinations of kicks, strikes using other students in normal, slow speed as well as different angles.
I skimmed this with a martial arts friend of mine who was also surprised & impressed with the passion, style, detailed instruction. You really feel like you're in a dojo class w/o any digressing talking. Just explaining the moves, important info and move on.
I plan to watch this all the way through & practice along.",1181865600,9,920,4.75625
