2815453,1,B000PC8AKK,"These were the absolute WORST of any of the animated superhero shows.
As a kid I loved the Super Friends of the 70's, I loved the JL and JLU of the 90's, I loved Batman, and Batman Beyond and Superman of the 90's and 2000's as well. If its a cartoon with a superhero and doing super stuff I am for the most part happy. I am not not what you would call picky. So I don't give a one star lightly. But I couldn't stand these when I first saw them when I was 10 and after watching a couple on Boomerang I like them even less. This edition of the Justice League was pure campy garbage. Its really THAT BAD!!",1184716800,3,602,3.942622950819672
2815454,3,B000PC8AKK,"The plots/storylines were good in this series. It is good to see a variety of superheroes in this series as well. However, there is no Aquaman, Flash, Hawkman (and Hawkgirl), or the Atom, 4 of DC's more prominent characters as well as characters of the superfriends. Also, Green Lantern appears only for a short time in only one episode. In my opinion, this series gives too much attention to the ""affirmative action"" superfriends such as Apache Chief, Black Vulcan, Samurai, and El Dorado. However, this could be somewhat fair since Samurai especially was neglected during Challenge of the Superfriends. Also El Dorado had not been created during that time.

If the 5 or 6 missing superfriends stated up above appeared in this series, then this one would have been the best superfriends season in my opinion.",1183680000,4,809,4.948529411764706
2815455,4,B000PC8AKK,"""Super Friends: The Legendary Super Powers Show!"" as announced in the opening main title by veteran voice artist Dick Tufeld (Spider-Man and his Amazing Friends, Thundarr the Barbarian) was the next-to-last incarnation of the long-running Super Friends series.

Based on the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Super-Powers-Collection/dp/B004E5D8VA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Super Powers Collection</a>&nbsp;toy line of the time featuring select DC Comics heroes including hero Firestorm (a long-time personal favorite of mine), Super Friends: The Legendary Super Powers Show (1984) is most revered as the Super Friends series that first introduced Firestorm the Nuclear Man in animated form, along with evil Apokolips lord Darkseid. Not to mention Adam West reprising his caped crusader role as the voice of this show's animated Batman.

Though still ""Super Friends fun,"" the art and animation for ""Super Powers"" was diminished to rather cartoony proportions, as most Hanna-Barbera cartoons of the time (Challenge of the Gobots, Scary Scooby Funnies) tended to be. Dedicated SF fans will overlook it, while those spoiled on today's animation may not be so inclined. Firestorm's transformation scene still looks cool though. Plus the tone of the show is *slightly* more intense (for Super Friends) than the previous versions thanks to the presence of Darkseid. So while the quality of the show is down a bit, it still remains highly watchable.

Comprised of 16 episodes totaling almost 8 half hours, this ""Super Powers"" collection also may seem limited, especially to SF fans who were hoping that the follow-up series The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians episodes would be included on the set. However, unlike the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/previous-collections/dp/B0007XG0JU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">previous collections</a>&nbsp;(each also containing 16 episodes, but were wrongly/confusingly titled&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-First-Season/dp/B00023E88U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""The First Season""</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Volume-Two/dp/B0007XFZMS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Volume Two""</a>), Super Friends: The Legendary Super Powers Show - The Complete Series is properly titled and contains exactly what the title says. Look for ""Galactic Guardians"" in its own 2-disc complete set on October 23rd.

Superfriends: The Legendary Supers Powers Show - The Complete Series is a 2-disc set featuring all episodes from the 1984-1985 season; Full-Frame (1.33:1) video; plus the following Special Features: ""Evolution: New Heroes, Viler Villains, and Ethnic Additions"" - Featurette on the impact of the Super Friends era of cultural diversity in animation; ""The Super Powers Collection"" - Featurette covers the correlation between the Super Friends and the toy industry; Commentary: On 5 key episodes by experts.

2. The Bride of Darkseid (Part 2)

2815456,4,B000PC8AKK,"Yes if they are only doing the 1984 series, it will be a bit skimpy (still want to know what the bonuses are, and I wonder if any of the ""lost"" 1980s shorts will make it on this set, as they were seen as filler on some of the original broadcasts).  But being ""abused"" by WB's marketing schemes in this case is worth it to me...well, in general, I am a big Superfriends fan anyway.  And by this time, the show was turning towards the elements (including a slightly more serious nature) that would culminate with The Super Powers Team.  It took one of Challenge of the SF's main strengths by using more villains from the comics; Lex Luthor and Mxyzptlk would return, joined by appearances from Mirror Master, the revamped Brainiac, and most of all, Darkseid and other New Gods characters!  And on the side of justice is one of the most underrated DC heroes, Firestorm the Nuclear Man (by the time of the SPT, Cyborg would join next, and we'd see the Wonder Twins and most of the Multicultural Pals phased out).  As a bonus, Batman's voice from then on would be Adam West, which made the character seem less nerdy than the Olan Soule version.  Soule would take over the role of Martin Stein, one-half of Firestorm, in this season.  Stein and Batman even team up for one episode!

Yes this might be a sparse DVD release, but still worth it for me to have pristine copies of this season.  Bring on the Super Powers Team, and some more of the Superfriends series (All-New SF Hour, anyone?  World's Greatest SF?  The aforementioned ""lost"" episodes?  Heck I'd even buy a set devoted to the Wendy and Marvin episodes)",1177977600,19,1608,4.506896551724138
2815457,3,B000PC8AKK,"I am glad that WB is continuing to release different incarnations of the Super-Friendsa, and will hopefully release them all, but I have concerns with the lack of content of this set. The 1984 season of ""Superfriends:The Legendary Superpowers show"" only had eight 1/2 hour episodes (sixteen,  11 minute episodes if you break them down), but with most DVD box sets all that could easily fit on one disk. I am hoping the 2nd disk has the follow up season ""Galactic Guardians"", which only had seven 1/2 hour episodes with some being a full 1/2 hour, and some being two short episodes. These would be great to package together as one set, but I fear WB will get cheap and try to get the most for their money that they can. Lets just hope they decide on what most fans would like, so that their DVD sales can continue to be profitable.",1177891200,8,830,4.4605263157894735

Even though I am not a fan of Alan Soule's Batman voice work, nor that of Kasey Kasem as Robin,
this is still a really good and well-done series, that is infinitely better than the horrific ""Superfriends""
series from the early 1970's.
This series was definitely a breath of fresh air from that previous 1970's incarnation which was short on action, plot,
and good voice acting other than the tremendous work of Danny Dark as Superman.",1416268800,,497,4.858823529411764

Though not as sophisticated as the Justice League, as an adult there is still an appreciation for seeing Black Vulcan, Apache Chief, and Samurai in one collection. All the exposition tends to get on my nerves as an adult, but as a child, this was must-see Saturday morning television. The voices and characterizations were interchangeable, but nonetheless, enjoyable, then and now.

2815555,4,B000PC8AKK,"This season takes the first of several steps to shake off the ridiculous
and pathetic stigma of the politically correct (whatever the hell that means!!!)
nonsense that pervaded the previous seasons.  Jack Kirby's great Fourth
World characters are introduced (Darkseid, Kalibak and Dessad) along
with the reboots of Brainiac and Luthor.  The great Adam West is now
providing the voice of Batman.  Firestorm is added to the team and the
Wonder Geeks (Ha! Ha!) are relegated to the background were they
belong.  Missing in action are Aquaman, Flash and Hawkman, while the
four ethnic characters take the spotlight.  Not an objection, but a little
variety and contrast is a good thing especially in this genre.

The extra features and commentaries all feature comics scribe and
historian, Mark Waid, who besides the late and greatly missed Dwayne
McDuffie is the best thing that happened to comics in the last twenty
years.  He is highly entertaining and informative in the same breath.
The show would require one more season before they absolutely
got it right with SUPER POWERS-GALACTIC GUARDIANS, but would
have never made it without the groundwork laid out in this season.",1395187200,2,1172,5.104712041884817

2815621,5,B000PC8AKK,"The first of the two ""Super Powers"" shows, and the last two incarnations of the long-running Super Friends show, ""Legendary Super Powers"" and ""Super Powers: Galactic Guardians"" were the first entries in the series (1973-1986) to actually attempt to truly emulate the comics featuring more detailed character designs and a noticeable increase in production values.

They were the first time since the late 1960s (i.e. ""Aquaman"", ""The NEW Adventures of Superman"", and ""Batman With Robin the Boy Wonder"", which contained real comic villains and more action-oriented stories) that parent groups loosened their death-grip on cartoon programming to include more adult themes like the murder of Batman's parents and the death of. Superman. And the inclusions of more menacing villains like Darkseid and the redesigned Brainiac.

When those shows wanted to appeal to the teenage demographic, they didn't include The Wonder Twins teaching about peer pressure; or Wendy, Marvin and Wonder Dog. They included Firestorm, a character with actual development and emotional content, with a unique perspective.

This show also featured action, dynamic camera angles, and not the same old left to fight flat repetitive motion Hanna-Barbara had become famous for throughout the 70s. Gone away was the constraining ""Scooby-Doo"" formula and style. The ""Super Powers"" show was a return to form for Hanna-Barbara, a renaissance of actual plotting, individual characterization, and action that hadn't been seen since shows like Johnny Quest, Birdman, and Space Ghost. Only, the ""Legendary Super Powers"" show did it even better.",1364688000,,1604,5.538775510204082

By the time this series debuted in 1984 I had discovered Japanese animation in shows like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Robotech/dp/B000B5IOY8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Robotech</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Blazers/dp/B000WB0DUO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Blazers</a>, and the complex plots, story arcs and real human emotions of Japanese cartoons left the poor outdated Superfriends looking like the flat, colorform characters that they were.

I was wild about the Super Powers action figures however, and collected as many of those figures as I could.  So I always had a lingering curiosity about the animated series that had spawned the legendary figure line.  This was, after all, the series were Jack Kirby's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fourth-World/dp/1401213448/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fourth World</a>&nbsp;characters made their first animated appearance.  The set had to have some merit.

The animation and storylines are just as bad as I suspected.  Hanna Barbara was really cutting corners, and much of the animation is of the ""static head with just the mouth moving"" -style.  At first I thought they were unwatchable, but after getting into the rhythm and enjoying the nostalgia of the whole series I started to enjoy them.

Having Darkseid as the main villain is both a blessing and a curse.  One the one hand, he provides a necessary challenge for the assembled Superfriends, and someone to plan storylines against.  On the other hand, it is hard to take Darkseid, Lord of Apocalypse and seeker of the Anti-life Equation, as a ""Curses! Foiled again"" -type of villain whose main goal in life is not the subjugation of all free will in the universe but instead to get Wonder Woman to marry him.  Really.

Cartoons aside, what really made this set for me was the bonus features and commentaries by DC Historian Mark Waid (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kingdom-Come/dp/1563893304/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kingdom Come</a>) and some of the episode writers.  The point is brought up as to how far behind the cartoons were from the comics; this was the era when the comic world was being revolutionized by&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Watchmen/dp/0930289234/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Watchmen</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Batman-The-Dark-Knight-Returns/dp/1563893428/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Batman: The Dark Knight Returns</a>, but the TV Superman and Batman were still sanitized and impotent ""good guys.""  Writers for the Superfriends would try and sneak in some character development and edge, but by the time the censors were through with their scripts all that remained was the bland, flavorless product we can still see today.

The ethnic characters, Black Vulcan, Samurai, Apache Chief and El Dorado, are also much discussed.  I didn't realize that there was a rule that one of the ethnic characters must always save the day in each episode, while the main DC heroes of Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman were just constantly captured and put into peril.  The writers are the first to admit that the handling of the ethnic characters was awkward, but felt that even those few first steps opened the door for other, better characters later on.",1262822400,,3927,6.91497975708502

2815680,4,B000PC8AKK,"Growing up watching the ""Challenge of the Super Friends"", this mid 80's part of the Super Friends run was quite different. I'm enjoying it very much, it has a much more detailed plot then its predecessor and better character interaction with a wider base of characters including Lois Lane and introducing Firestorm whom is a new and like able edition to the Justice League, (if you will). Its also great to see the villains back in action and causing chaos for the Super Friends. We haven't seen any villains like this since the first series of ""Challenge of the Super Friends"" when they were up against the ""Legion of Doom"". My only problem with it is the change in casting on the voices of Batman and Wonder Woman. Batman is now voiced by Adam West, and don't get me wrong, I love Adam West in his live action role as Batman, but I find in this Series of Super Friends he sounds dull and unintelligent. Wonder Woman is now played by a former Playboy bunny and kind of sounds like it. Again nothing wrong with Playboy bunny's, but for the voice of Wonder Woman? I'm use to a deep and strong voice from Wonder Woman.",1208908800,,1116,4.4487804878048784

2815682,4,B000PC8AKK,"I was looking greatly forward to this set for some time on account of the fact that this is the era of the Superfriends that coincided with Kenner's popular Superpowers Collection of toys.  As others have stated, the writing in the show matured a bit over seasons past and seemed to have better figured out how to create situations that required the unique skills of the individual members.

As the bonus features confirm, this season was also noted for its use of specially created ethnic characters to diversify the roster.  As such expect a slight overload of Samurai, Apache Chief, Black Vulcan, and El Dorado.  Additionally the Wondertwins (and Gleek) make a few slightly out of place appearances.  On the positive side this also the season that introduced us to Firestorm; the first Superfriend to truly have a personality.

Like others have said in their reviews, one does begin to miss the Legion of Doom slightly.  Darkseid and his brood make up the antagonists in a majority of the episodes here.  Although I should mention that we are treated to the redesigned Brainiac (much improved) and Lex Luthor sporting his cybernetic PowerSuit.

In addition to the 16 episodes across 2 discs, the special features included are ""Evolution: New Heroes, Viler Villains, and Ethnic Additions"", writer commentary of 5 episodes, and my personal favorite ""The Super Powers Collection: The Effect of the Toy Industry on the Super Friends"" which explains some very interesting history on why so many animated shows in the past failed to have a corresponding toy line.

The episodes themselves are very short (roughly 11 minutes each) which often results in a show that resolves in the tune of 45 seconds or so.  The pace is certainly welcomed to the drag-heavy hour-long shows of seasons past but prepare for some seriously quick wrap-ups.  Upon hearing the sheer number of restrictions that were placed on the writers, it's amazing this show existed at all.  Honestly, once taking into consideration that there could be no real violence, no weapons, no punching, only a few robot enemies on screen at a time (so as not to scare children) the beauty of the writing starts to become clear.  We're lucky the Superfriends weren't all just sitting around in a group hug!

Overall, a nice set that is definitely worth the money for the extra features if nothing else.  This era marked an interesting time for the Superfriends, especially considering that this really was their last iteration in classic form.

Here is the complete episode list:

1. The Bride of Darkseid (Part 1)
2. The Bride of Darkseid (Part 2)

Any of the old DC cartoons shouldn't be criticized for their simplicity because at the time they aired they were awesome.

You'll see Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, and more battle Darkseid and his crew.  There's a few extra featurettes and the one about the Super Powers Toy Line is phenomenal. There's a charm that these cartoons have that the new ""The Batman"" and ""Justice League Unlimited"" lack.

These new episodes totally ignore some of the other characters such as Green Lantern, Flash, Hawkman etc.

My other biff is each episode is only 10 minutes long. These short episodes doesn't give much time for story development it's just ""ha ha.... I'm being evil. We will stop you and then they do.""

If you like the old school superfriends stick with the ones involving the Legion of Doom. Those are a lot more fun than these are.

With that being said my small children (ages 2 to 4) love these episodes every bit as much as the Legion of Doom ones and I can show them these older episodes in lieu of the newer ones which are way too violent.",1192492800,4,870,4.3580246913580245

Who voiced Batman? Adam West (the definitive Batman voice, who previously voiced the character in his live action series of the 1960s, and then in Filmation's 1977 New Adventures of Batman - now on Warner DVD).
Old villains like Luthor and Brainiac are retooled for the series, with new costumes and powers, or just return for more fun, like Mr Mxyzptlk..
New villains have been imported from the comics, such as Darkseid, Kalibak, Desaad, and Mirror Master.
Hanna-Barbera did go a little overboard on playing up their multicultural characters, created in earlier seasons of Superfriends specifically for TV (unnecessary really, as they could have used DC characters like Black Lightning, John Stewart, etc)
The writing improved in this season, and both art and writing will improve again in the upcoming release of sequel series ""Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians"" in late Oct 2007. Watch for that too.

2815700,4,B000PC8AKK,"For the 1984-85 season, Hanna-Barbera produced its latest and next-to-last Superfriends incarnation: SUPER FRIENDS: THE LEGENDARY SUPER POWERS SHOW, the ""Super Powers"" tag being added so as to tie in with Kenner's action figure line. I know I nagged my parents for some of them neat action figures (I think I still have Flash and his kicking legs somewhere). Superfriends was a regular Saturday morning staple which I'd much looked forward to in my childhood. But I have to admit that the more sophisticated kids of today would find these very simplistic episodes beneath them. Nowadays, the Superfriends series is appreciated and savored mostly by nostalgia buffs and by ""kids"" of my generation.

Heroes are only as good as their villains. This time around, the show discards well-intentioned scientists who've strayed off the righteous path (well,excepting ""Island of the Dinosoids""). This particular season introduces a decided upgrading in supervillainy. The regal Darkseid, whose malevolent presence is felt in seven episodes, shows up to inflict misery on the Superfriends even as he crushes on Wonder Woman (as a side note, does anyone else think that he sounds like an evil Cookie Monster? No? Okay.). Brainiac reappears, this time oozing more palpable menace in his revamped, now metallic skeleton guise. Luthor also swings by, and in a power suit, natch. On the side of the angels, the matter-converting teen superhero Firestorm, he of the surprising secret identity, debuts and gets a lot of face time. Other heroes don't fare as well. Word to the wise: Despite Aquaman and the Flash showing up in the opening credits, neither makes an appearance in this season.

Around this time, the show had apparently received a mandate from the high muck-a-mucks to present a more ethnically diverse cast. Thus, Black Vulcan (the cool-costumed electricity emitter), Apache Chief (size shifter), El Dorado (telepath), and Samurai (wind master) are showcased more prominently, with each actually taking turns in saving the day. The writers and animators meant well, but the results of this racial integration come off more as clumsy and even condescending. But, hey, it's the thought that counts, right? And I guess this did pave the way for superheroes like John Stewart's GL, Static Shock, and even Stan Lee's dubious The Condor.

The extra features (which are decent) go more into it, but, regarding animated shows, there were very strict codes being held up back in the day. As well as other issues. Did you know, for example, that Darkseid became a major bone of contention as it was felt that the spelling of his name might aggravate the German fans? As well, heavy restrictions were placed on cartoon combat which severely limited the action sequences. In fact, I don't recall seeing anyone hit anyone else with their fists or feet in these shows. Firestorm saved a lot of hair pulling on the writers' part as, a lot of times, he resolved a lot of the conflicts by merely pointing and doing his thing. Less violent? Certainly. Boring? Infinitely.

SUPER FRIENDS: THE LEGENDARY SUPER POWERS SHOW - THE COMPLETE SERIES is comprised of 16 episodes, each about 10 to 11 minutes long. This exercise in brevity means that each episode moved briskly, as opposed to the prior hour-long episodes which sometimes just draaaagged. Of course, the downside with having these short episodes is that no time at all is spent in character or plot development. But, then again, if you're a 6-year-old kid criticizing a TV character's motivation, then you need to be put in a corner and given Sandman comic books. Anyway, yes, the animation is crude and the stories are more campy than interesting. SUPER FRIENDS: THE LEGENDARY SUPER POWERS SHOW, as well as most of the other Superfriends versions, are more quaint than anything else. Old school charm. Yeah, that's what it's got going for it. Oh, and Adam West as Batman. Three and a half stars for this one, as nostalgia wins out.

Disc One:

Episodes 1 & 2 - ""The Bride of Darkseid (Parts 1 & 2)"" - The Superfriends are bemused as a mysterious new superhero gallivants around the country saving the day. Meanwhile, Darkseid, in search of a bride, has his eye on Wonder Woman.

Episode 3 - ""The Wrath of Brainiac"" - The re-tooled Brainiac creates robotic doppelgangers of Superman and Wonder Woman, with a final assist from Darkseid. Darkseid, by the way, again proposes to Wonder Woman.

Episode 4 - ""Reflections in Crime"" - One by one, Mirror Master traps the Superfriends in the 6th Dimension (the dimension behind mirrors), until, finally, only Samurai is left.

Episode 5 - ""No Honor Among Thieves"" - Darkseid and Luthor siphon off the Superfriends' powers and then begin backstabbing each other. Darkseid proposes to Wonder Woman for the 3rd time.

Episode 6 - ""Mr. Mxyzptlk and the Magic Lamp"" - The mischievous other-dimensional imp passes himself off as a genie and begins harassing the superheroes.

Episode 7 - ""The Case of the Shrinking Super Friends"" - Left in charge of the Hall of Justice, the junior members of the Superfriends go up against Lex Luthor, who shrinks them. Featuring the Wonder Twins. Cameo by Green Lantern (Hal Jordan).

Episode 8 - ""The Mask of Mystery"" - The bumbling Captain Mystery fits perfectly into Luthor's scheme to destroy the Superfriends.

Episode 9 & 10 - ""Darkseid's Golden Trap (Parts 1 & 2)"" - An intergalactic underworld auction puts up rare gold kryptonite for bidding. Later, El Dorado challenges Kalibak on the Moon of Games.

Episode 12 - ""Uncle Mxyzptlk"" - Superman is exposed to red kryptonite and reverts to a little boy, and a bratty one, at that. Mxyzptlk pops in to make things even more miserable to Samurai, Firestorm, and the Wonder Twins.

Episode 13 - ""The Case of the Dreadful Dolls"" - The Dollmaker has magic mud and, with it, he'll take over the minds of the Superfriends. This one's right up El Dorado's alley.

Episode 14 - ""The Royal Ruse"" - An alien princess, whose planet has been invaded by Darkseid, begs for assistance from the Superfriends.

Episode 15 - ""The Village of Lost Souls"" - While on a hike, Apache Chief and the Wonder Twins stumble into a mining town crawling with zombified inhabitants.

Episode 16 - ""The Curator"" -  A beam from outer space causes the world's most famous landmarks to vanish.

Special Features: Episode commentaries (again by Mark Waid and various series writers) on ""The Case of the Dreadful Dolls"" and ""The Royal Ruse""; the  two featurettes ""Evolution: New Heroes, Viler Villains and Ethnic Additions - How Super Friends Prefigured the Era of Cultural Diversity in Animation"" (18 minutes, and interesting) and ""The Super Powers Collection: The Effect of the Toy Industry on the Super Friends"" (7 minutes).",1189209600,11,7153,4.96652719665272
2815701,4,B000PC8AKK,"Long before The Justice League animated series on the Cartoon Network there was the Super Friends on Saturday Morning TV. Premiering in 1973, the Super Friends went through various incarnations over the years until the final season during 1985 - 1986. The show featured a number of DC Comics' superheroes but the mainstays were Batman & Robin, Superman, and Wonder Woman. The show was geared toward Saturday Morning TV viewers and not comic book fans. Thus the stories were more simplistic and the violence was toned down quite a bit. One thing that the Super Friends did was to introduce ethnically diverse heroes to Saturday Morning TV with an African American (Black Vulcan), a Native American (Apache Chief), an Asian (Samurai) and a Hispanic (El Dorado)

This particular series, The Legendary Super Powers, was a rather ingenious media tie-in with Kenner Toys' line of action figures called the Super Powers Collection. This is truly one of the great action figure lines of all time. First, the line featured many characters who would not be seen in action figure form until the DC Direct series. This included Red Tornado, Dr. Fate, Martian Manhunter, and Captain Marvel. In addition, many of the figures were short-packed, creating instant collectibles for figures such as Cyborg, Plastic Man, and Mr. Miracle. It was a great line of toys.

Onto the DVD...The Two Disc set includes the complete, 16 episode series to go along with some nice special features. No one will ever accuse Hanna-Barbera of producing great animation, at least not in the 70's and 80's. Animation was still on the downslide prior to being revived by Disney in the late 80's and early 90's. Hanna-Barbera did what they do very well...and that was produce animated shows quickly and cheaply and it's a far cry from today's animated TV shows.

Each episode runs about 9 - 11 minutes in length and there are a couple of two-parters on here as well. The First episode, ""The Bride of Darkseid"" (a two-parter) introduces Firestorm. This is the first version of the character who is made up of teenager Ronnie Raymond and Professor Stein. The mysterious new hero aids the Super Friends and is soon welcomed into their ranks to help battle Darkseid who has kidnapped Wonder Woman and intends to make her his bride. The hilarious thing about Firestorm is that the flames atop his head never move, making him look like he's wearing some kind of a goofy hat. That's just one of the many corners that Hanna-Barbera cut to keep costs down.

In, ""The Wrath of Brainiac"", the new and improved Brainiac is introduced in his new robotic body as he and Darkseid join forces to destroy the Super Friends. ""The Royal Ruse"", ""Island of the Dinosoids"" and ""Darkseid's Golden Trap are other standout episodes. The disc comes with commentary on five of the shorts by the episode's original writer, and comic writer/historian Mark Waid. These provide some insightful and often humorous revelations about the constraints placed on the writers on how they had to present the heroes. There are two special features on the set, the first a look at the previously mentioned cultural diversity of the Super Friends; and the second a look at the Super Powers Toy line.

The Commentaries and documentaries are very good and worth the price of the set alone. Yes the animation is very outdated and the stories are rather juvenile but taken within the context of the era they were produced, the Super Friends was still a great series and its nice to see these on DVD. Total run time is 179 minutes.

REVIEWED BY TIM JANSON",1188777600,21,3568,4.840983606557377
2815702,5,B000PC8AKK,"I title this review after a phrase that was uttered by El Dorado, the super-hero whose main power is creating hologram's. This series of SUPERFRIENDS is the next-to-last installment of the classic era. It was followed by SUPER POWERS TEAM: GALACTIC GUARDIANS in 1985. The super-hero that the writers were spotlighting the most was Firestorm, a hero with an unusual alter-ego. Firestorm was one half of Professor Stein. See, college student Ronald Raymond got tangled up in an experiment gone wrong by the Professor. As a result of the freak accident, both Ronald and the Professor if they concentrate could fuse into the super-hero, Firestorm.

There are 8 episodes on this collection...each episode contained two segments that range 10-11 minutes each. Each segment is counted as an ""episode"" and therefore the DVD is promoted as having 16 episodes. 5 episodes {broken down into 10 short segments} appear on DVD #1 while the final 3 episodes {broken down into 6 short segments} appear on DVD #2. Lex Luthor makes several appearances...he is toned down somewhat because he plays opposite Darkseid in ""NO HONOR AMONG THIEVES"".

The writers must have felt that the strong-willed, ruthless Luthor from CHALLENGE OF THE SUPERFRIENDS wasn't needed because of Darkseid, a demonic villain from the planet Apokolips, and so they played Luthor's character pretty much for laughs. Luthor appears in NO HONOR AMONG THIEVES, THE CASE OF THE SHRINKING SUPERFRIENDS, and THE MASK OF MYSTERY.

Brainiac, as he appeared in the comic books in the mid 1980's, shows up in robotic skeletal form in the episodes THE WRATH OF BRAINIAC {where he goes one on one with Darkseid} and THE VILLAGE OF LOST SOULS {about an island of zombie slaves}. Mirror Master and the series created villain, Doll Maker, create problems for the Superfriends...in the short REFLECTIONS IN CRIME, Mirror Master traps several of the Superfriends behind mirrors {the 6th Dimension as it's explained}. In a funny scene, Superman is flying around looking into mirrors trying to get help when he looks into one mirror and a lady screams...Superman says something like: ""I'm sorry, Miss..."" and then flies off talking to himself: ""I gotta be more careful..."".

The 5th dimensional joker, Mr Mxyzptlk, appears in MR MXYZPTLK AND THE MAGIC LAMP about a petty crook who believes Myxzptlk to be a genie...the story is basically a series of practical jokes against the SUPERFRIENDS...ending with the villain tricked into saying his last name backwards...sending him back to the 5th Dimension. His other appearance is in UNCLE MXYZPTLK where the Wonder Twins find red kryptonite and innocently expose it to Superman...who turns into a small kid as a result. The other Superfriends refer to the boy as ""Super Brat"". The story is played for laughs...Mxyzptlk trying to win over Super-Brat's attention in a series of stunts to prove he's more popular than the Superfriends.

Darkseid appears in much of the cartoon shorts...one stand-out is DARKSEID's GOLDEN TRAP, which airs in 2 parts. That episode focuses on gold kryptonite...which according to the Superman history is an element that strips Superman of his powers forever. THE CURATOR closes out the collection...that episode features Samuri and Firestorm tracking down an intergalactic museum curator who's stealing landmarks from around the globe.

In THE CASE OF THE DREADFUL DOLLS, the Superfriends are up against Doll Maker...sort of a voo-doo villain who makes clay dolls of the Superfriends for a strange plot.

Throughout much of Darkseid's appearances, there is always this love he has for Wonder Woman. From the start of THE BRIDE OF DARKSEID and continuing on through the other episodes that feature Darkseid as the villain, it was always made clear that Darkseid has a soft-spot for Wonder Woman.

The voices of the characters remained the same except for two notable changes. Batman was no longer voiced by Olan Soule...instead, Adam West was called in to voice Batman. West had portrayed Batman in the live-action TV show in the mid '60s. Olan Soule, on the otherhand, was called upon to voice Professor Stein, one half of Firestorm.

In the episode ISLAND OF THE DINOSOIDS, there's a lengthy scene between Professor Stein and Batman. Lex Luthor's base of operations in this series is ""L Island"". Darkseid, his son, Kalibak, and henchman, Dessad, hail from Apocolips. Brainiac holds fort in his Starship. Mxyzptlk roams freely once he leaves the 5th Dimension until he's sent back to the 5th dimension ""for 90 days"" if tricked into saying his last name backward.

BJ Ward took over the role of Wonder Woman in this series...previously the character had been voiced by Shannon Farnon for years. William Woodson was once again on hand to narrate the action.

All in all this is a great installment of SUPERFRIENDS cartoons.",1187481600,10,4831,5.10253164556962

They released the series in no particular order. Like 1977 was first, 1983 second then maybe 1980 then 1985 show and given stupid names like ""Lost episodes"". The only thing lost were our patients. Arrrghhh!! but here it is. I made a list for those who want them in original airing dates.

2815704,4,B000PC8AKK,"Along with ""Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians"" & re-runs of ""Challenge of the Superfriends"", this cartoon was a highlight of many a Saturday morning.  Next to ""Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends"" this particular cartoon was one of my favorites as a kid.

This 2 disc set complete with commentaries of select episodes (by comic book writer Mark Waid no less!) and 2 short documentaries will certainly hit the spot if you're a child of the '80s.

Before the legendary DC animated incarnations of today, this camp fest was the best there was in it's time.  These episodes are still entertaining despite their dumbed down scripts and low-end animation.  The only thing keeping me from giving this 5 stars is the fact that I've been so spoiled by modern day cartoons which finally take all this super-hero schtick seriously.  Still GREAT fun though!",1186444800,4,848,4.936619718309859
2815705,4,B000PC8AKK,"The shows are exactly how I remember them.  Not my favorite seasons like challenge or galactic guardians, but have some fun episodes with firestorm replacing Aquaman.  The extras are cool and fun to watch the toys in action.
The set cost too much since challenge of the superfriends had 16 full episodes while this is half that with only 8 episodes for 16 shorts.  But im
a fan so I paid the full price!  But the set should cost less.  Maybe they have to pay the Firestorm creator more money for the sets??",1186444800,2,506,4.397849462365591
2815706,2,B000PC8AKK,"The Superman overload is toooooo much. Almost every villian on this collection is a Superman Rogue. That includes Darkseid, Lex Luthor, Brainiac, Mxypltlk?, etc... We only get one segment that features another hero's rogue and that is Mirror Master. What is odd is that The Flash is not even in that one...it is all about friggin' Superman getting trapped in mirrors! Geez. DC really needs to realize that there are other heroes and villians outside of Metropolis.",1186444800,,464,5.038961038961039
