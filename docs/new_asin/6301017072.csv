320685,5,6301017072,I thought this movie was VERY funny.  Shelley's death scene is quite a laugh.  And of course the story premise is very fun.  Not a bad film at all.  What can I say!  It's just very cute and funny.  Very good for a Saturday/Sunday afternoon movie.,1052611200,6,246,4.239130434782608
320686,1,6301017072,"This has to be just about the worst movie I've ever sat through.  I watched it because I couldn't take my eyes off Gabriel Byrne, who has beautiful eyes and a beautiful accent, but otherwise it was just terrible.  It wasn't even bad in a funny way; I just felt embarassed.
The story was completely ridiculous.  I'm generally willing to suspend disbelief, but the whole back-from-the-dead thing seemed singularly pointless.  Implausibilities mounted like cars in a pile-up.  The dialogue was so banal it was almost unbelievable.  The problems facing our pair of lovers were so manufactured I expcted the seams of the film to tear every moment.  You don't fire a good doctor because reporters are crowding the operating room.  You ban the reporters from the hospital.  And why did they have to tie up all loose ends by hooking up the protagonists sister with that millionaire?
Among the many bad performances, the sister had to be the most annoying of the lot, but Shelley Long was pretty awful too.  Even Byrne wasn't great (how could he be, with those god-awful lines to say) but at least he wasn't embarrassing like the rest.",1049155200,7,1126,4.787564766839378
320687,5,6301017072,One of the funniest movies ever produced.  Good for families as well as adult viewing.  Did not get enough notice in the theatre when first released.,1048982400,,149,4.6923076923076925
320688,5,6301017072,"Hello Again is a delightful film from the late 80's about a housewife,(Long),who suddenly dies and is brought back to life by her sister. Then, through the rest of the film, she has to start her life all over again.  Long is delightful, and she becomes funnier every minute.  The slapstick performed by her and Judith Ivey is true magic!!! With support from Corbin Bersen, Gabriel Byrnes, and Sela Ward, Hello Again is one of the greatest 80's flicks of all time!!!!!!!",997401600,4,469,4.7073170731707314
320689,5,6301017072,"I thought this movie was very delightful, definitely a family movie and I really enjoyed it.  I am trying to buy a copy, but it not in print at this time.",959299200,5,154,3.967741935483871
320690,4,6301017072,"It's easy to dismiss this film as a forgettable piece of 80's fluff, but don't be hasty.  Agreed, it is difficult to go along with the whole ""back from the dead"" aspect without rolling the eyes.  But if you  take that element out of it, you'll have the same story of life and love,  and of second chances for both.  It's an adorable little romp.  Nice  performances all around, especially from Gabriel Byrne as the charismatic  yet lonely doctor who falls in love with Lucy (Shelley Long).  So abandon  your standard discriminating tastes in films for about 90 minutes, and  enjoy the fun.",949536000,6,589,4.621359223300971

320760,5,6301017072,"A little mystical, a lot zany, personally I loved it and was looking for it to see it again; had remembered it after not seeing it for at least 10 years. This movie may not be for everyone, but it's a sweet one.",1513382400,,211,3.9302325581395348
320761,4,6301017072,Shelly Long and the entire cast pull off this fantasy in a charming way. Always worth yet another rerun.,1505952000,,104,4.526315789473684
320762,3,6301017072,"Kind of amusing in parts, and unexpected in others.  I rented this thinking it would be the usual person-goes-through-afterlife bureaucracy kind of stuff that's been recycled every so often, and usually played for laughs.

But the big surprise was when this film went in a different direction and had all the characters acknowledge that the impossible actually happened, even to the point of world wide recognition.  That was actually kind of refreshing for a film, because usually you have the frustrating trope of the main character not being remembered by those that knew him or her (her in this case).

Even so this film needed a few more dollars behind it to punch up some laughs and, as many extras as there are in this film, it needed a few more to really sell the concept for the film.

Shelly Long does a pretty good job of playing a resurrected late 20th century house-wife, and shows what a versatile comedienne / actress she is with her channeling scene.

It's not an outstanding film, but it's respectably shot, has a good score, and takes the ""fake death"" scam and turns it on its head.  In a sense if this were a traditional drama, the ""bad guys"" were turned into the ""good guys"" (gals) to put a unique spin on the afterlife sub-genre.

There's not much more to add.  The script could have used a few more laughs, because as it is now it's just worth a smirk here and there, and not much more.  There really aren't any big laugh out loud moments, just some amusing circumstances sold as a light hearted romp.

See it once to kill some time on a lazy Sunday afternoon.",1501372800,,1582,4.535211267605634

321130,3,6301017072,"This movie deserves at least 3 stars for the performance of the luminous SHELLEY LONG.  Her co-star, CORBIN BERNSEN, cannot match her talent and is miscast as her jerk of a husband.  The story, a woman brought back to life by her eccentric but delightful sister (JUDITH IVEY) after choking to death on a chicken ball, has great possibilities for hilarity, and Ms Long does create some side-splitting scenes.  Unfortunately, the writing and directing do not always hold up, creating some holes in logic that are too flagrant even for this farcical movie.  That, combined with Mr. Bernsen's lackadaisical performance takes from this movie many of the comedic possibilities it would have had.  It is worth seeing, however, if you are a Shelley Long fan.  If it hadn't been so flawed, she could almost have carried it on her own.",1432080000,,825,4.857142857142857

It was quirky and fun; spooky and mystical. The combination of prepubescent hormones, my love of the occult and Are You Afraid of The Dark and love conquering all made this an instant classic in my book. However, back in the days before DVR and easily accessible cable channel guides, you just had to wait for a gem like this to come around again.

And I waited. And waited. And. Waited.

Years later, I talked to my Mom and she couldn't remember ever watching it. Siblings - no. Dad - no help. I described it friends - they too had never heard or seen the movie. Was I insane? Did I dream up this madcap hilarious movie in the throws of some flu hallucinations?

321910,4,6301017072,"Lucy ( Shelly Long ) is a mild mannered housewife who gave up all to help out her husband ( Corbin Bernsen ) to become the plastic surgeon of his dreams.  They had a son, who was a joy to his mom and who, inspired by his mom's herbs and cooking, loved to cook and create as well.  Lucy's sister, Zelda ( Judith Ivey ), is a bit out there with her mystic beliefs and chants, but the 2 sisters love each other deeply.  Lucy is the odd-man-out at most high society, ""snob"" parties, as she trips, gets parts of her clothes drenced in soup, and assists in the burning of a prized tuna on a spit for a meal.  She always feels like she doesn't fit in with her husband's friends and colleagues, nor her glamorous friend Kimmy ( Sela Ward ), who goes through rich husbands like kleenex.  Kim's last husband, unfortunately, didn't leave her any money, as he died shortly after he...had his ""moment of passion"", so to speak.  ( If ya know what I mean ).  Lucy goes to her sister's shop and takes a bite of Zelda's lunch, which is a chicken ball, and promptly chokes and dies from it ( gets caught in her throat ).  The last thing she sees before she passes away is a friendly pair of caring eyes--the examination Dr's ( Gabriel Byrne ).

A year passes and many things have happened....Kimmie married Lucy's widowed husband, Lucy's son is a chief at a famous restaurant, and Zelda has found a way to bring Lucy back to life!  After Zelda says the magic words and waves her crystal ball while at her sister's grave, Lucy comes back to life, but must adjust to the media scrutiny ( she did come back to life, after all ), the loss of her marriage, and the loss of her sense of self, i.e. wife and mother.  She is sort of a fish out of water, all the while the media hounds after her.  She begins to fall in love with the doctor whose eyes were the last thing she saw before she died a year ago, as he helps her with tests to see if she actually is alive and well.

Lucy's former husband has told her that he enjoys his new life with Kimmie and all the excitement she brings, but he likes all the attention Lucy is getting and wants to be a part of that, as well, but Lucy wisely rebuffs his advances. Kimmy sees her husband give a peck to his former wife's cheek and her jealousy rears its ugly head.  She holds a press meeting telling everyone that Lucy is a fake and that she took some drug to slow down her heart and breathing rate, but she was still really alive.  Lucy, wanting the press to get off her back and off of those that she loves as well, says nothing.  Now the doctor that she has fallen in love with will be digraced as a nut, and Lucy feels terrible, as she was only trying to help.  Together with the help of Zelda and Zelda's most interesting rich boyfriend, they prove the nay-sayers wrong and get a confession out of Kimmie that clears their names.

This is happily-ever-after type of movie and once in a while, ya just need one of these, especially after a downer day at work or whatever.  The clothes/music/art are vintage 80's, but that's one of the things that just makes it so light hearted and fun.

Despite the foolish plot, this really isn't that bad. It's one of those silly 80's movies that you have to laugh at because it is such a far fetched story.

321988,2,6301017072,"Shelley Long's decision to leave CHEERS, ostensibly to focus on movies, made her the brunt of many a late night talk show barb. Understandably so since it seemed like classic show biz hubris.  You're on a great TV series and garnering acclaim and Emmy nominations, so you leap to the conclusion that big screen success is virtually inevitable if you but make the leap.  In Long's case, she went from the Emmy winning CHEERS to, well, TROOP BEVERLY HILLS, followed by a string of other cinematic flops.  Admittedly there were some successes too, but when critics--or comedians--are looking for examples of bad show biz career moves, Shelley Long's case always seems to be at or near the top of the list.

It probaby should be noted that the 1987 film HELLO AGAIN was actually made BEFORE Long's announcement that she would be leaving CHEERS.  This Disney/Touchstone comedy had been preceded by the much more successful (both critically AND commercially) OUTRAGEOUS FORTUNE) with Bette Midler.  Long, like Midler, was apparently being groomed for Touchstone stardom, but it probably should have been clear to both Long and her handlers that not every Touchstone film would do for her career what FORTUNE had done.  HELLO AGAIN's critical and box office failure probably should have sounded a clear warning that cinematic success just might prove more elusive that it may have appeared at first blush.

This film's ""high concept"" is that a socially and physically awkward wife and mother dies in a comically(?) quirky way (choking to death on a piece of Korean chicken) and is brought back to life by her endearingly eccentric, New Agey sister's (laughably hammy) incantations exactly one year after her death.  In the intervening year, all kinds of changes have occurred--including her plastic surgeon hubby's remarriage to her glitzy,  best friend.  You can imagine the ""highjinks"" that ensue.

One such complication is her husband's apparently hasty marriage to her former best friend.  If that promts you to feel sorry for poor Shelley, you needn't fret.  True, her shallow husband (Corbin Bernsen) has no desire to leave his current and equally shallow wife (Sela Ward) and the chique urban lifestyle they have since adopted.  But we know that truer love must be right around the corner, namely in the form of the handsome, soulful doctor she literally met on her deathbed (well, ok, it'd be more accurate to say her death gurney).  Of course, you just know that she's going to hook up with Dr. Right again upon her resurrection.  (Hardly a spoiler, I trust, since a five-year old could tell you that you don't exchange glances like that unless your cosmically matched).

Can a story this patently silly even begin to succeed.  Certainly, more outrageous premises have been successfully handled before.  But you need sharp, sharp, SHARP writing, keen directing and spot on acting.  You don't see nearly enough of any of these in HELLO AGAIN.  It's a common enough Hollywood syndrome--the belief that a wacky premise is enough.  It's not, and it can't sustain the film's tepid humor, plodding story line and weak character development.  We are, at least, spared a chase scene.

A number of the reviews published on public sites like Amazon, seem to tout this film's virtues as family fare.  It's true you needn't worry about the little ones seeing anything objectionable here, and some of the younger ones may like the film's hokey hocus pocus.  But the film actually tries to make some grown up statements about accepting change and moving on--always relevant messages, certainly, but hardly the most significant lessons a profound event like resurrection from the dead would seem to offer.

Long's apparent career blunder, of course, is hardly of cosmic significance either.  Twenty years after the fact, I imagine that the real-life Shelley Long has ""moved on"" as well.  HELLO AGAIN probably should have served as a very earthly warning that good comedy scripts are hard to come by, no matter how gifted a comic actor you may be (and I do believe that Shelley Long is certainly that).  Letting go of a great small screen role for an iffy big-screen future may have been unwise as career moves go.  As stated, this film should have served her as a warning of sorts.  As it stands, it's likely that the small screen success of  CHEERS will remain the highlight of Shelley Long's career.  On the other hand, like most of the cast of this flop (incluing Byrne, Bernson, Ward and Judith Ivey, who had perhaps the film's most unfortunate role as the eccentric sister), she has remained a working actor with plenty of large and small screen credits on her imdb roster.

And there are struggling actors out there who would DIE for that level of success.",1196380800,,4749,4.922110552763819

321993,5,6301017072,"One of Shelley Long's better comedies, HELLO AGAIN is an entertaining ""What If?"" story with a twist.  Lucy Chadman (Shelley Long) has it all...a rich plastic surgeon-husband (Corbin Bernsen), a devoted son, a faithful dog, great friends and a beautiful mansion.  But when she accidentally chokes to death on a chicken-ball, her charmed life comes to a premature end.  Enter her wacky sister Zelda (Judith Ivey) who resurrects Lucy with an ancient spell.  But Lucy is shocked when she discovers how much time has been taken from her, with her husband now re-married to her supposed `Best Friend' (Sela Ward), and when the press finds out about Lucy's miraculous return from the grave, it's every man for himself!

Shelley Long radiates charm and warmth as Lucy.  I've always loved Long and this is arguably her best solo comedy effort.  She adds a lot of pathos and heart to the role.  Judith Ivey is hilarious as Zelda; can you say `scene-stealer'?.  Corbin Bernsen and Sela Ward play the uptight yuppies to the hilt.  The outstanding supporting cast includes Austin Pendleton, Carrie Nye and Gabriel Byrne.  A witty and clever comedy that needs to be rediscovered.",1142380800,25,1165,4.953608247422681

7810357,5,6301017072,"I wasn't prepared for how powerful this movie was gonna be. Unlike some of the less-enthusiastic reviewers, Id seen the stage musical and knew what I was getting into. The source material is very cinematic, but unlike an actual movie, a stage production puts a certain amount of distance between the action and the audience. The creators of this movie adaptation clearly understood the opportunity they had to explore intimacy in ways a stage production never could, and wow, did they ever! The performances are first-rateespecially Audra McDonald, who is no stranger to the composer and this material. Her scenes with Martha Plimpton are some of the most exciting moments of the film. Whats truly remarkable, though, is the way this piece never re-treads material. Theres a danger in stringing together a series of romantic encounters that the piece might become repetitive or emotionally stagnant, but Hello Again deftly maneuvers through encounter after incounter and from time period to time period and the characters and their interactions and emotional journeys are all fresh and real and vibrant. I look forward to seeing Hello Again again and again.",1520035200,,1157,5.192513368983957

the above movie actually is all mostly sex scenes and i would never have chosen it if i had known it was NOT the one all the reviews are written about.
look at ALL the 180 reviews and notice it says the movies is about shelley long and her sister.
maybe the old movie everyone seems to be reviewing is called the same name??? just a guess...
 and the shelly long movie is charming and cute. this is not NOT the movie above.. it was truly horrid and made in 2017 or 2018...

i really REALLY HOPE THIS GETS FIXED.. i can just imagine the SHOCK some parents might have if they base their movie choice for their kids on the reviews!!!!
