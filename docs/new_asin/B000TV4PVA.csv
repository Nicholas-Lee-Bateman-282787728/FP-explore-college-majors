2910515,5,B000TV4PVA,"This was one of the best movies I've ever seen.  It was smart, intense and thrilling.  It shed a whole different light on professional thieves.  Seriously..rent this movie, as it's now on netflix and then fork down the $5 and buy it.  I bought it primarily to share it.  I'm not sure how stuff like this doesn't make the theater but a talking dog always does...

Go figure.",1228176000,4,373,4.411764705882353
2910516,1,B000TV4PVA,"Since I am obsessed with documentaries, I went crazy when I saw the trailer for this film. Street thief, shot by a documentary filmmaker following his ""exploits"" and sold as a ""true story"", promised to be the ultimate milestone in reality media: What about the legal consequences? When does a director turn into an accomplice? How could a criminal -or a documentarian- agree to do such a thing?

I was anxious to find out about all this, but after the first ten minutes I realised that the shots were too beautiful and the narrative too neat. It was obviously a mockumentary (only based on real crimes, hence the ""true story"" tag). The real thief is whoever wanted to pull off this stupid gimmick, if you ask me.",1202342400,2,712,4.606299212598425
2910517,5,B000TV4PVA,"This is honestly a great movie, I first say it on A&E and thought it was such a smart movie, weather it's a documentry or a mocumentry, it's a good film to see. You can't find it on Netflix and they arn't showing reruns anymore. Free Shipping? Good deal.",1195430400,6,254,4.204081632653061
2910518,5,B000TV4PVA,I stumbled accross this movie on Netflix the other day and was blown away by it! My only complaints are that it wasn't longer and there wasn't a series (with Casper? and or others in the business) made. I don't want to spoil it with details but Check it out!,1322006400,3,258,4.18
2910519,4,B000TV4PVA,"This one really flew under the radar. Yet another one of those hidden gems I randomly came across that somehow didn't get barely any attention when it was released... it definitely should have. It's basically a fake documentary... although you wouldn't really know that based on how the film is done. It's filmed as almost a guerrilla style documentary following a professional thief in his day to day life. We get to see how he scouts locations, what methods he uses, and even a little peak into his psyche.

I found it absolutely fascinating, and throughout I kept imagining how even though it's technically fake... it's probably pretty close to how a real professional thief would work. There are also moments of tension and suspense as we actually tag along with the main character on some of his heists... real nail biting stuff; which is aided with the documentary style film making. The movie just came off as wholly original, and I can't recommend it enough... especially if the topic intrigues you. 4/5 stars.",1294358400,4,1018,4.850574712643678
2910520,5,B000TV4PVA,"I never heard of this movie before, but one boring day I was flipping through Instant Netflix and read the synopsis for this movie, so I gave it a shot.  So glad I did! Others here are bemoaning the fact that this is ""FAKE, FAKE, FAKE!!!!"" It is -- who cares? It's an awesome, well done movie, that kept me watching the entire time.  Probably the best ""mockumentary"" I've seen.  Anyhow, to say anymore would ruin the experience.",1284076800,5,428,4.461538461538462
2910521,4,B000TV4PVA,"It's a DVD, what does one say about a product like this. I wanted one and I now have it.",1275782400,,88,3.45
2910522,5,B000TV4PVA,"This is a great docu/mockumentary (however you want to label it) about a thief.  It's dark, grungy, and intriguing, making it quite honestly one of the best movies I've seen in some time.  There are great plot twists that keep you guessing and the actual film and acting is so well done that it can be passed off as a real documentary!

Don't believe me?  Sadly, all the 1 star ratings should be 5 stars.  Just because it's good enough to dupe you doesn't make it bad.  It makes it that much better.  This has been a must have for me and, sadly, I've bought it many times over as my friends have a tendency to ""borrow"" it.",1269993600,4,622,4.220338983050848
2910523,5,B000TV4PVA,"Hollywood glamorizes high-profile burglaries. Street Thief gives you the down and dirty version of how it really happens. It's raw and gritty, and doesn't paint a pretty picture of career criminals.

Street Thief pulls you in early, and delivers a powerful ending that is sure to make you think. I picked up a copy of the DVD from Amazon several years ago, and to this day it is one of my personal favorites.

This will be one of the most brief reviews I've written for Amazon for a reason: the less you know about Street Thief going in, the more you will enjoy it. Try to avoid the spoilers in the other reviews, and definitely add this DVD to your collection.",1268611200,2,661,4.454545454545454
2910524,1,B000TV4PVA,"Simple: The film-makers state at the beginning of the movie that it is true.
They lied.
Then they continue to lie. . .
And lie. . .
And lie. . .
I don't care that it was suspenseful, that the acting was good, that the camera work was professional. I do care that I was being lied to.
Not thieves. . .Liars.",1266624000,2,306,3.9516129032258065
2910525,1,B000TV4PVA,"This movie is NOT a documentary.  That's just what the distributors & cable companies want you to believe.  Take away the false premise, and all you have is a disjointed, poorly scripted movie with horrible dialogue and plot holes you could drive a tank through.

In my opinion, the only thing that made this movie watchable was the actual belief (not willfully suspended disbelief) that the thief was on the edge of getting caught and/or smacked down for his audacity.  Without that, there's no reason to watch it.  Save yourself the time & money.",1258934400,3,548,4.787234042553192
2910526,5,B000TV4PVA,"This movie is not your typical ""crook/burglar"" movie. This guy takes you thru the so many steps of a burglary ( recon, planning, & the actual thing). I can't believe that the film crew could keep up with him. This movie is full of suspense and the ending was very unexpected. I've seen a lot of independent movies before but this was one of my favorites.",1245196800,3,354,4.378787878787879
2910527,4,B000TV4PVA,"I saw this on A&E. Frankly, I really liked this! The main character [Caspar] works well. No contradictions, he's simply a crook. There's no love interest or any other disctractions.

I thought this was a credible movie and the acting was good.",1233705600,4,243,4.785714285714286

8211126,5,B000TV4PVA,"If you like movies like ""Usual Suspects, Slingblade, Snow on da Bluff"" etc... you will LOVE this mockumentary about a career criminal who takes some documentary film crew members along for some ""real world"" heists.

This movie is so well done that I had to watch it twice (and then BUY IT!) to make sure it was really a movie & not an actual documentary about a 'street thief'.

GREAT movie for anyone who likes something that makes you think... and wonder... if you're really seeing what you think you're seeing.

It's not a 'car crash' or 'action' movie... you'll have to use your noggin a bit but that's ok if you use a brew or two to keep it from overheating.",1448150400,,663,4.418032786885246
8211127,5,B000TV4PVA,"One of the best movies I've seen in a while, if you're considering watching it, stop reading this review and just go watch it. Personally, I love how sub plots went nowhere, relationships you were expecting to develop were never fulfilled, this movie was raw gritty entertainment from start to finish. My only complaint? They didn't make a part 2, 3 and 4, highly enjoyable - Street thief is the hood black swan.",1422057600,,412,4.657534246575342
8211128,5,B000TV4PVA,"I loved the cinematic style this was filmed in.  The attention to detail and the fact that all of the crimes were based on true events is pretty amazing.  At first I really thought it was real, then I was upset it wasn't but after a little poking around I found out that the story was based not he life of a prolific night club burglar in Chicago who co-wrote the film and was an advisor.  I'm a huge heist flick fan and this was definitely a good one.  Not for those looking for shoot outs and explosions this one is more about the life of a thief and the intricacies of pulling a successful score.",1419206400,,599,4.137931034482759
8211129,4,B000TV4PVA,"Color me Mr. Gullible. Not until I read other reviews did I realize that the main character here was the director. Still, it's a captivating slice of street life. Worth watching, even if you know the spoiler.",1393977600,,208,4.648648648648648
8211130,4,B000TV4PVA,"what a slice of life!  there are a few serious surprises awaiting the viewer in this gritty, authentic gem.  fasten your self belt; you're in for a ride.",1356652800,,153,4.428571428571429
8211131,1,B000TV4PVA,"I could tell right away that the main character Malik Bader was also the director, because of the through-the-roof egotism. There should have been someone else to yell ""cut!"" after every single one of Malik Bader's stupid, self-absorbed, swear-riddled lines, and educate him on what real criminals say. He must have used the f-word 500 times in this film. I didn't buy the character or the plot for one second. Stupid, stupid, stupid.",1353369600,,434,4.958904109589041
8211132,5,B000TV4PVA,"Cleverly made film in the style of a documentary which purports to follow a professional thief around Chicago. Actually the director Malik Bader plays the subject, with convincing arrogance, patter and chain smoking profanity. He loves to eat and the camera catches him cooking, ordering fast food, reveling in his food. I only realized this was fictionalized late in the film when the supposed documentarians bring their footage to the police, which seemed unrealistic in the extreme. In any case, very skillful and certainly the directors had access to gritty real life expertise if not their own. Fascinating glimpses into techniques of robbery including power saws to cut into safes. The plot is minimal but the thief at one point breaks his rule of working alone by collaborating with the Russian owner of a strip club to stage a robbery as an inside job; unfortunately this leads to his murder. The artists created a cloud of ambiguity around the film which kept the Tribeca Film Festival people guessing. All part of the art game.

Malik Bader is an innovative talent and new voice in independent film. He has a new project to be released this year; look forward to seeing it.",1329091200,3,1183,4.885572139303482
