8306837,5,B001GRZ5SS,"Good luck finding a copy.  If Amazon has one, grab it.  I picked up mine at the Fly Fishing Show in Denver in Jan '15, and it is an amazingly good little reference.  It is not a watch all the way thru vid, it is organized by chapters, and covers anywhere from 10 minutes to 20 seconds per species, around 40 species.  But it does a very, very good job of it.  I tried to track down the source, but the website flyfishingdvd is not active, or not owned by the people that made the dvd.

p.s.
I managed to track down the source, and it can be found over at a site named perfectflystore  Seems to also be home of a number of worthwhile fishing things.",1421020800,,648,4.05511811023622
