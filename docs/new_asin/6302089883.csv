7820601,4,6302089883,"I don't know how many times I followed along with Madeleine Lewis and ""jumped around"" to her routine in my parents' den, way back in the nineties while I was still a teenager.  Recently I decided I wanted to see how her workout held up to the test of time and ordered myself a used-but-in-good-condition copy of this VHS tape.  It's amazing that when I first put the tape in the VCR and began playing it, I still almost seemed to know her moves (and perky words of encouragement) a half-second before they actually happened.  Blast from the past!  This California Calorie Burner definitely makes you sweat: there's brief section after the warm-up that showcases some bodyweight-only calisthenics (push-ups, lunges, squats, etc.) for mild, beginner-level strength training, and then comes the cardio.  Madeleine favors low-impact aerobics with fun choreography that was designed to keep individuals in the lower end of their target heart rate.

While a few things wouldn't fly nowadays (like the head twists in the warm-up... watch that delicate neck!) I still feel that most people of at least an average fitness level would find this little VHS tape a bright, useful addition to their home fitness library.  (Those who are of a lower fitness level might find it too intense.) It's a shame that it hasn't been released to DVD.",1345248000,,1326,4.9192825112107625
7820602,5,6302089883,I have had my tape forever and it is the only one that I can actually do the whole way through!  My family laughs but I don't care because if it works for you then you continue to use it.  Why cant they just put it on DVD!  I know there are some of us that would buy it!,1338422400,3,270,3.542372881355932
7820603,5,6302089883,"I will sum up Madeleine Lewis's ""California Calorie Burner""  video in one word ""FABULOUS"". I first bought a copy of this tape back in 1992. Every time that i have successfully lost weight, i have used this video. Here it is 2004 and the only reason i will not get rid of my VCR is because of this tape. My family considers this tape a family heirloom of mine. I absolutely love it. Recently the tape broke (from old age i am sure)i frantically ran out and tried to find it everywhere but to no avail. I actually had my husband glue mine back together. Recently I found out about Amazon.com. They actually still had a copy of it and for only about .80. Well, for now mine still works. Maybe I can get another 4 or 5 years out of it, if not, i know where to find it. Thanks Amazon.com.",1081641600,4,783,4.151315789473684
