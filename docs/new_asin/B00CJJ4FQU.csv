Unfortunately they aren't any more alive but the richness, signification and influence were and still are bigger and greater than anyone else. Jackson do Pandeiro gave with his voice and his accordeon a special musical way to enjoy and influence worldwide the whole Music Scene. Me pesonally, I have the whole musical work by himself. It's a enormeous pleasure, and all Brasilian People, coming for a visit to me, get to tears listening to him. Really GREAT!!!!",1396483200,,603,4.921568627450981
