8289560,5,6304570147,"My nephew loved this tape when he was a child. My son watched it at my parents house and fell in love with it too. It was really hard to find because my nephew is 16 now and I think it was new when he was a baby, but had to order one for my child. It has classic kids songs like old mcdonald, yankie doodle, BINGO the dog and many other cute songs!! Highly recomend.",1356739200,,366,3.8289473684210527

8289562,5,6304570147,"My 18 month old loves this movie so much that she has watched it till it did not work anymore.  She runs around the house saying, ""boogie woogie, boogie woogie""!  She does not understand that boogie woogie has left our home.  We are from Canada and the only places we have found this tape are at garage sales...  If you have the tape hang on tight to it because they are so hard to find. Great video!!!!!",1096675200,2,404,4.207792207792208
