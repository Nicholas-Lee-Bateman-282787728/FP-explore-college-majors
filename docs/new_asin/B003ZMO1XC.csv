Even though Percy Kilbride wasn't in these last two, the original elements of good, clean fun were still present in these. Nothing here to shield the children's eyes from will be found here.",1388534400,,277,4.673469387755102

8410659,5,B003ZMO1XC,"Received the dvd set about a week after ordering.  This completed the complete series for me.  I have enjoyed the Ma and Pa Kettle movies since I was a kid, including the original movie that started it all, The Egg and I.  Also, I have read Betty MacDonald's book by the same name and really enjoyed it, not knowing, until then that it was based on facts and people she met when moving to the Washington peninsula.  Very humorous book and equally funny movie series.",1336867200,,466,4.447058823529412

The Kettle's have been a favorite of my families since I was a young girl (I'm 57 yrs.now. I also have a Red  Skeleton collection. I love good clean humor.

8410661,5,B003ZMO1XC,"When Percy ""Pa Kettle"" Kilbride was forced into retirement after a car accident, it seemed like ""The Kettles"" series' future was in serious doubt. After all, one half of the famous pair was exiting the series---how could it possibly continue? Seems Universal International was not quite ready to put its beloved B-movie franchise out to pasture just yet...along came two more films, sans Kilbride.
""The Kettles in the Ozarks"" (1956) has Ma (the still blustery & funny Marjorie Main) & kids traveling out (via an amusing train ride) to stay a spell & help Pa's hapless brother Sedge (Arthur Hunnicutt, sort of a makeshift ""Pa"" figure in his absence). There's some shenanigans about bootleggers squatting on Sedge's property, and a love interest subplot as Sedge has avoided getting hitched to his longtime gal (Una Merkel). But of course, it's really Ma who takes center stage as she helps outfox the bootleggers. There's also a funny bit about the animals getting smashed on moonshine, via special effects.
""The Kettles on Old MacDonald's Farm"" (1957) brings down the curtain on the likeable series as Ma & Pa (and kids) settle into new digs...and discover a young couple hiding out. And so, it's up to the Kettles to act as chaperones, along with some funny bits of business involving doing chores, a logging competition, and a pesky bear. Veteran actor Parker Fennelly takes over the Pa role. And while he has some amusing moments, he really doesn't get a chance to make the role his own. One film wasn't enough; he needed 1 or 2 more to settle into the role. Alas, that didn't happen.
But whether you prefer Kilbride or Fennelly, you'll find these last two entries satisfying, with the same warmth & hokey humor of the first 8 films. I found they brought back some nice memories!",1310169600,3,1782,4.826797385620915
8410662,5,B003ZMO1XC,"I have the Ma and Pa Kettle collection in video, and was thrilled to find it in DVD, as video tapes do deteriorate.",1298764800,2,115,4.043478260869565
8410663,1,B003ZMO1XC,"First: This is a Turner Classic Movies title which is currently exclusive to their site for half or less (currently twenty bucks plus shipping) the scalper rate.  BUT these 2 films are now available on pressed disks in a *FULL* set of the Ma & Pa Kettle films!  More about that below, but first about *this* set:

This set contains the last 2 of the ""Ma & Pa Kettle"" film series containing ""The Kettles in the Ozarks"" (1956), and ""The Kettles on Old MacDonald's Farm"" (1957).  Both films are anamorphic widescreen.

Because a few of the TCM ""Universal Vault"" titles have appeared on Amazon as DVD-R (MOD - Manufactured on Demand) product I contacted the company which makes the titles for TCM. This is a DVD-R MOD title. I'm not too keen on the current trend towards MOD as the longevity compared to a pressed disk has yet to be proven. Aside from that, most MOD titles *do* at least have silk-screened disk art and professionally done sleve packaging/artwork.

Percy Kilbride is no longer part of the action leaving Marjorie Main to carry most of the weight along with a stalwart supporting cast.  The films are typical of the series and good clean fun delivering many laughs even without ""Pa"".  The package is a must if you're a fan of the series and/or a completist.  If you like the other Kettle films you'll probably like these as well.

Earlier I'd recommended you start our ""Kettle"" film journey with:

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Adventures-of-Ma-Pa-Kettle-Vol-1-The-Egg-and-I-Ma-and-Pa-Kettle-Ma-and-Pa-Kettle-Go-to-Town-Ma-and-Pa-Kettle-Back-on-the-Farm/dp/B0000WN0O6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Adventures of Ma & Pa Kettle, Vol. 1 (The Egg and I / Ma and Pa Kettle / Ma and Pa Kettle Go to Town / Ma and Pa Kettle Back on the Farm)</a>

as that package contains the first of the ""Ma & Pa Kettle"" films, ""The Egg and I"", in which they are supporting characters (Fred McMurray and Claudete Colbert star) and follows it with the first 3 of the franchise ""B"" films.

BUT - these 2 films have now been added to the previous 8 to provide *all* the Kettle films in a single package at a very reasonable price, typically the same, or less, than either of the volume sets.  Plus it's single-sided disks!  What you now want is:

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ma-Pa-Kettle-Complete-Comedy-Collection/dp/B005DDN51A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ma & Pa Kettle Complete Comedy Collection</a>

Even if you already own one or both of the volume sets (I *did*) the ""Complete Comedy Collection"" is worth the purchase and best of all it's *pressed* disks rather than MOD.  Just pick that one up and gift/donate/sell your no longer needed volume sets.

This set now only gets 1 star due to the superior new package with all 10 films and that it's a MOD title.",1282780800,9,2838,5.225165562913907
