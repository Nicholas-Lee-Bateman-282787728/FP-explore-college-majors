1947919,5,B0000UX52K,"I have never surfed in my life. I used to live in Florida where the beach was a 60 second walk away. I would watch surfers, I would swim, boogie-board, skim-board, just lie on the beach, etc - but never did I surf. I now live a lifetime away from the southern-florida beaches. I bought this film because I am now a 6 hour drive from anything partially resembling a decent beach and I wanted to see a movie that would take me back there.

I would describe the movie as a vibrant surf film following a group of surfers across the world set to a chill soundtrack. The cinematography is just plain awesome. The movie was shot on fullframe 16mm film - sometimes in black-and-white, mostly in color. The music is terrific. Others complained that the music was too chill for the imagery of surfing; I think it fits perfectly. Johnson has a few riffs placed throughout the movie but mostly heard are other artists. Also included is a commentary track by the Malloy brothers and Jack Johnson - if you are interested in the locations (vague references) or short anecdotes told by the filmmakers then I recommend listening in on this. Found on the extras page is 'Holes To Heaven': a great song written and played by Jack Johnson set to more great footage. Other extras include a handful of deleted scenes.

I am glad I bought this film. It is a small price to pay for an excellent trip back to the beach.

1947920,4,B0000UX52K,"Yes it is a little short, but they shred the whole time.  Tough to know where they are, would like to know.  Kinda arrogant, like them sharing their memories is something really special, I guess it tries to be a little too artsy.  I'm not dogging it, it's certainly different than most surf films, it's just whether you like that kind of thing.  And the music in the background seems somewhat repetitive, the same baseline over and over.  But like I said, they rip it the whole time, so it's tough to be mad.",1250985600,,508,4.361702127659575

1947924,4,B0000UX52K,This DVD is one I think every surfer should see at least once. I will not go as far as saying its one of the best surf movies ever made but in my top 15 list. Great surfing and a hip sound track.,1222128000,,195,3.558139534883721
1947925,3,B0000UX52K,"I had never heard of Jack Johnson before I came upon his DVD called Thicker Than Water, at a used DVD store, which, if the DVD package was accurate, seemed to be a documentary about sailing around the world. The back cover features robed Buddhists on the bow of a boat, in an exotic sunset. Could this be a Generation X riff on the whole Seven Years In Tibet theme? I did not know, but always one to enjoy offbeat documentaries, I decided to give it a whirl. Was I surprised, or what?
  Well, the disk is a documentary, but not of water-centered cultures about the world, nor of existentialism in a Thoreauvian vein admixed with rock music. No, instead it's a surfer film, although not of the sort brought to you by Hollywood airheads. It follows a group of young twentysomething surfers who spent a year and a half in the early part of this decade just bumming around beaches all about the world, and shooting their adventures with an old 16mm camera. It is part home movie, part guerilla filmmaking, part acid trip, part bad garage band, and all in all oddly interesting, if not riveting. There are, of course, some great shots of young studs riding through tubes of water- although very few bikini babes, and a good deal of lite pop music, spiced with a bluesy vein, by Johnson. His tunes are most akin to the music of The White Stripes, albeit a bit mellower, but nothing much really happens in the forty-five minutes of the main film. We see surfing in different locale, hear random voices come on and off and say things banal and observant, but, I guess, not much more can be expected from Johnson, who was a former pro surfer whose career ended after an accident, and has since become an alternative music icon, of sorts.
  Don't get me wrong, some of Johnson's music is evocative, and he does seem like a nice enough guy. I just wonder what sort of vanity is behind such an exercise? That said, the camerawork is much better than one might expect from mere amateurs, but what deeper point is there in the whole exercise, apart from a vanity video. There are scenes that a filmmaker with a real vision could have cut together with much more effective music. The documentary- if one can really call it that; it's more of an extended music video, travels from Tahiti to India to Ireland to Australia to Hawaii and to many unnamed ports of call, seems like the first rough cut of a filmmaker trying to find his way, not a finished product.
  All in all, this is the sort of DVD to watch if you're a teenager with a little bit too much weed and not enough pals to toke it with, but it is not a film for a serious cineaste, nor even a serious surfer, for the waves within the film are rather paltry. Not that any of that is necessarily a bad thing, but it's certainly not too good of a thing, either. The fact that it could have been more suggests that the boys' youth was to blame. Ah, youth! If you need me to fill in the rest of that observation you will know how I felt watching Thicker Than Water. Okay?",1221955200,,3010,4.366071428571429
1947928,3,B0000UX52K,"The first music video Jack Johnson was much better! However, if your a Jacki fan then it's a great addition to your collection.",1209686400,,127,4.565217391304348
1947937,1,B0000UX52K,"All should know that I am a huge fan of surfing movies.  From ""Endless Summer"" to ""Riding Giants"" and even the small ""Billabong Odyssey"", I have been there to watch the greats catch some of the greatest waves in history - and be there with a camera.  It is phenomenal to watch these small men ride creations of nature.  It is these types of movies that make you want to grab a board, learn to surf, and fly to Hawaii just to experience the North Shore.  These films evoke a sense of excitement, the push you to the limits, and make your jaw drop to the floor.  Having seen most of the more recent surf films, I was on the hunt for a new palate of cinematography.  I wanted to explore the next level in the surfing genre, sadly, what I experienced was a little over-hyped surfing documentary called ""Thicker than Water"".  Helmed by the musically inclined Jack Johnson, I was prepared for some great surf, amazing music, and people that I would never forget as I continue my quest as a pho-surfer.  Alas, that wasn't the case with this movie.  I have no idea where the hype seems to be, if maybe only for the purist of surfers, but what I experienced was an amateurish feature, with no opportunity for involvement, and a sound that seemed like scraps off the dinner table.  Nothing was worth enjoying, and for me, this 45-minute feature took nearly three days to watch.

I must admit, the concept for this film was good.  I liked the idea of friends out surfing these remote spots of the world, seeing through their eyes places I may never see in my existence, but what I didn't need was rush images of people with no introduction, sappy tunes, and upper-class individuals rubbing it in my face the wealth of their parents.  This wasn't a film about surfing, while there was plenty of it in the film, but instead an opportunity for these guys piggy-back on Mr. Johnson's career in hopes of making a cult surf film.  ""Thicker than Water"" eventually turned out to be nothing more than a couple of guys surfing the baby pool at each exotic location.  When I watch a movie like this, I hope to see tremendous waves  that show me how impressive these guys are with their trade.  I wanted to have my jaw drop on the floor with excitement over what maneuver I would see next, or how big Mother Nature would get for the next surfer, but it never happened.  For 45-minutes we went to remote locations with no name (could someone tell me where they went - please!), with surfers with no name (could someone give me some history on these athlete's - please!), and pathetic waves.  Am I being too negative on this film?  Nope, if 45-minutes of a sport that I loved bored me, than something definitely wasn't working.

Arg.  As I read the mostly positive reviews of this film, I am puzzled.  What was it that drew most of the audience in?  As I read words like ""beautiful cinematography"" and ""unusual and exotic music"", I just get completely puzzled.  Did I miss something?  Am I not as big of a fan as I once thought I was?  Are there fans that could sit through this more than once?  While I think most will say ""yes"" after reading this critical review, I just don't think I can honestly say that I enjoyed any part of this film - outside of the audio commentary.  The commentary provided me with the missing puzzle pieces that this film horribly missed.  It provided a voice, a direction, and a focus that the original 45-minute feature lacked.  I needed this guidance.  I wanted to hear the story of these guys told through any means necessary.  The sporadic filming, the graininess of the view, and the overall ambiance of ""Thicker than Water"" was so diluted that watching kids on a raft in a wave pool would have been more entertaining.

Overall, I cannot suggest this film to anyone except those needing a good night's sleep.  The music, while I am a fan of Jack Johnson's work, is not the caliber you would come to expect from him, the film itself is pointless and excessively random with horrid dubs and inconsistent A to B direction.  I love surfing films, but this one lacks the draw and power of the others mentioned.  Not that I need all the flash, I don't mind a pure film about surfing, but give me names, give me places, give me stories.  All of these features are what make up a true surfing documentary.  We need words (actually ANYTHING) to go with the waves.  In ""Thicker than Water"" the waves were just not enough.

1947940,5,B0000UX52K,"I absolutely love this video and have ordered it for friends. Jack Johnson and the Malloys did a great job with this one. Warning: don't set your expectations too high because this was not made for the critics. These guys are out there having fun. The budget was tight and the whole thing was made using 16mm film. If you are looking for a great video to chill out and relax with, buy this one. There is barely any dialogue, but great tunes by Jack Johnson, G.Love, and many more. A Brokedown Melody is the new video that these guys have released. I highly recommend that one as well. More dialogue and more of a storyline. Also Kelly Slater with great surfing.",1168300800,2,661,4.426229508196721

After awhile I clued in that there would be no story and virtually no dialog or commentary... nothing. They don't even tell you where they are?! It's basically a 45 minute music video. And the music, although I like it, doesn't fit with the footage at all. I really don't understand the point of this project. I watched the first 20 minutes uninterrupted and then started fast forwarding. Total waste of time and money. And I am a Jack Johnson fan.",1161475200,7,618,4.477876106194691
1947947,5,B0000UX52K,"Nice video from the malloys and jack. Filmed in quite a few different locations..australia(no exact spot was specified), the big island of hawaii, the north show of oahu, indonesia, ireland and tahiti. The directors commentary is worth watching multiple times and the segments with shane dorian and kelly slater are both very good. It was also nice to see ireland in a surf film...somewhere kinda different from the norm.

The photography is really great...shot on a 25 year old 16mm camera, gives it a nice feel..not blurry and not digital looking. Also kinda neat is the bonus footage for holes to heaven, a song jack wrote while filming this project. The great thing is that I bet that quite a few fans of jack's music have no idea he's a great filmmaker and surfer too.

 The green board (hobknobber) segment makes more sense also when you watch the commentary also the names of almost all the surfers are told while they are surfing in the commentary...seems as though most of the reviewers here missed that point.  The waves are generally pretty average with the only great waves being a couple in ireland and a spot in tahiti that isn't teahupoo but it looks real nearly identical exept it spits way harder(according to the directors). Definitely would reccomend this video to just about anyone that's even considering buying it and for the price it's really a great deal.",1136160000,24,1379,4.805907172995781
1947950,2,B0000UX52K,"I just bought this DVD and am very disappointed. Yes, the soundtrack is good, however the footage is very boring. Some sections of the movie (like the surf session with the old ""singlefin green"") are nice for the soul content, but the rest is very, very substandard surfing (nothing really amazing on the wave size or on the ""gnarliness"" of the moves). I haven't watched the bonus video yet, but I don't think it'll be that good to change my rating. If you're looking for soul content, you're much better off buying ""Singlefin Yellow"". If you want to buy this for the soundtrack, then buy the CD.",1128902400,13,596,4.579439252336448

1947970,1,B0000UX52K,"There are so many better surf films out there than this.  I love surfing but this film just left me cold. If your idea of a great surf movie is 45 minutes of different bits of surfing footage without any storyline accompanied by a wholly uninspiring and unsympathetic soundtrack, then check this film out.
Some of the waves surfed in this film are dramatic; I am pretty sure one of them is Teahupoo in Tahiti, a wave to equal almost any in the world in ferocity and the drastic consequences of a wipeout on it.  Unfortunately there is no indication either in the film or in the credits where any of the footage was shot, which is a shame and also an unneccessary omission.
But please, surfing is an adrenaline sport and whilst, with the exception of the (maybe) Teahupoo footage, the waves surfed in this movie are not particularly big, this movie fails to capture any of the dynamism and excitement that is an integral part of surfing.  This is despite the fact that many of the world's best surfers feature in it!  Because there is no storyline or dialogue, the soundtrack dominates the aural part of the experience and the soundtrack is just awful. It is soporific mush. What you experience with your ears is completely at odds with what you see with your eyes. There is no synergy between the two whatsoever.
If you are desperate to add to your surf movie collection, then this one is watchable, just.  If you want to be more selective, then any of the Endless Summer trilogy or Billabong Odyssey would be a far better choice.
And if you only want to buy one surf movie, then it has to be Step Into Liquid, which is a million miles better than this one.
In fact, if you want to buy ten surf movies, buy one copy of Step Into Liquid and watch it ten times!",1083888000,9,1759,4.416666666666667

It was somewhat hard to figure out where they were. We have clear scenery change, but no indicator to tell us where they really were except for the traditional Irish folk music that obviously indicated they were surfing Ireland. Director's commentary is witty and insightful and gives us perspective that few surf films give us and basically provides a good reason to watch it again -- and again. The version of this DVD I purchased in a local surf shop included a second disc; a CD with the soundtrack from the film. Very nice and a unique marketing and packaging idea. It actually convinced me to purchase the package. More importantly, the music is actually good (I was disappointed, though that the Irish folk music used in the film was not included on the soundtrack CD).  But as a film, come on, it's only about 45 minutes long (with special feature bonus material, about an hour). It can't possibly be that difficult to compile film to make it last longer than an hour. Anything less than an hour these days, let's face it, is somewhat of a disappointment. Jack Johnson's involvement added to the film, though. Nicely done, let's just have more of it.

First and foremost it's a surf video, but there's more going on than just some guys showing off with their moves. Unlike what you might see on Bluetorch or 54321, this video offers a different perspective, and it sets the mood with an awsome original score. This is no less than a work of art. Through the surfing you get an expression which comes from a passion for life not just the sport itself, it's also in some ways a glimpse into the creative process of a musician. If you listen to Jack Johnson's ""On and On"", then watch this film you can see where the inspiration came from. A lot of the lyrics relate to some of the imagery which was selected. This film has definatly given me newfound respect for that these guys do, and I can't really express how good ""thicker than water"" is. It's actually very tranquil. It's a must have for any surfer, and I reccomend it for anyone who is big into music or is a musician themselves [and I think all other artists can probably walk away from this video with something too].

TTW takes a break from looking at surfing as an ""X-Treme sport"" and more of a great thing to do with freinds. the music is great, the imagery is great, and there is some great humor to be had (that part at the begining when they use a jacket as a parachute is hilarious!!) my only complaint is that its too short! around 45 mins long! there is extra footage though, which why they didn't just include it in the actual movie in the first place is beyond me. however, the 45 minutes that are there are perfect, and i cant take off a star for the length. if you're in to just kicking back  and having a good tim, this movie is perfect.",1073952000,15,811,4.165605095541402
