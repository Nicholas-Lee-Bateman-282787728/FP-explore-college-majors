reputation among school boys.  I wanted to see it again.
A true classic - rugged acting and that nicely old-fashioned atmosphere
all around.",1355788800,,206,4.694444444444445
8039584,2,B000679NDM,"This is one strange series. At least to this Western viewer it is. The old TV Batman was brought to mind many times, not just because of the no-one-ever-getting-hurt violence and bad guys standing in line to attack the heroes, but also by the acting skills of Adam and Burt. There is lots to not like here. What, you ask? OK, let me list (some of) the flaws. Dreary music that is so 70s, but with one theme used over and over with very little variation. A hunky guy hero who's not much of an actor, though he can stare thoughtfully into the distance, but has some amazing pecs, and shows them and the manly hair covering them often. Lame and silly humor, not funny, that eventually rises to become annoying. Soft focus photography of the hero and his best gal tediously running, swimming, embracing and kissing. A frightfully predictable romance, complete with a mother eager for grandchildren. Sets that look as if they're made of Styrofoam. A confusing space/time relationship--is their hideout far from the village, or near? And the unavoidable requirement of all such Robin Hood stories, a buffoon landowner and his greedy, selfish and incompetent margrave who're about as believable as Snidely Whiplash. Yep, just about every bad series cliche rolled into way too many episodes.

I watched it to be done with it, but enjoyed only moments of some of the episodes until the last two, which were surprisingly good. Still the cartoon violence, still the all-too-easy solutions, but some content, some conflict, something worth watching. And then the ending. Yikes! Where did that come from?

So, not very good, with a terrible transfer. But not a total loss. 2.5 stars on the 1-5 scale.",1323388800,,1687,4.833910034602076
