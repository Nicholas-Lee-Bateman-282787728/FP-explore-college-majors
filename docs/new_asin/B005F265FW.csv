Watched the first three in the set and decided to write Mickey Rooney a fan letter letting him know how much I enjoyed these films. Sadly he happened to die just a few days later. There are some dated and socially unacceptable scenes (all the black-face numbers) but take those out and the films still stand on their own.

4670391,4,B005F265FW,"I like this group of musicals, not so much because of the story behind them, but rather because of the musical numbers played in them and the pair of stars. Not being from this period, I also get to take a glimpse at youth-oriented films were like during this period (1938-1943). Babes in Arms, Strike up the Band, and Babes on Broadway a group of young kids, lead by upbeats Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland put on a show for some altruistic purpose. These films, populated mostly by youngsters, tend to be very optimistic about young people and about swing music. Although the stories are predictable, and perhaps a little corny, they are entertaining to watch because of the musical numbers. In Babes in Arms, I got a kick out of watching Judy Garland singing Good Morning and Figaro, accompanied by an enthusiastic Mickey Rooney on the piano. Done in 1938, it is also interesting to note the  ""isolationist"" theme in the last song ""God's Country"": ""We have no douche, we have no Fuhrer, but we have Norma Shearer..."" and later on ""We have no goosesteps."" This musical, however, is not a political one. If it sings about peace in America, it does it to instill a sense of optimism about the future and young people.

In Strike up the Band, Mickey and Judy want to create a dance band with swing music in order to save the school band. This film guest stars a famous band leader at that time, Paul Whiteman. My two favorite, memorable numbers here were Do the Conga, performed and danced by Mickey and Judy, and Drummer Boy, performed by Mickey Rooney and an orchestra. Babes on Broadway was, perhaps, my least favorite one albeit it had its interesting moments. This film does touch the theme of war when Mickey and Judy lead an activity to help English children who must live in America away from their parents because of the war. I thought that this film overdid to much the idea of presenting too many obstacles in Mickey Rooney's objectives. This film ends in a minstrel show.

In Girl Crazy, Mickey plays the son of a wealthy business person who is always being ridiculed by the press and is sent to a college in the American West where he must become a responsible citizen. He meets Judy Garland, who plays the role of the mail person for this college. They fall in love as usual. In the meanwhile, Mickey concocts a plan to save the college from ruin due to poor enrollment that, as usual, involves swing music. In this film, Tommy Dorsey and his orchestra is the guest star in this film. The conclusion to the film ends with a song that is a favorite of mine because Gene Kelly tap dances to it in An American in Paris. That is the ""I Got Rhythm"" song. Although the lyrics are different, the energy and the enthusiasm are the same. The choreography is also great during this last number.

I was quite pleased with this collection of films. I got a pretty good glimpse of Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland and I know now why they were so popular then. I also get to see both actors performing music as singers and dancers. The first three films were directed by the famous choreographer Busby Berkeley,and the last film was directed by Norman Taurog. They are all in black and white.",1420329600,,3188,4.529513888888889

4670393,5,B005F265FW,"These movies are still hugely enjoyable, especially for older folks like me.  They need to be considered in the context of their time, music, American entertainment, Depression and wartime, etc.  For a young audience today, they might seem silly or naive or sentimental.  But the incredible singing and dancing talent of both Rooney and Garland still shine through.  Highly recommended....and also a steal at the price.  Excellent technical quality and some delightful extras (shorts, cartoons and commentaries).",1419984000,3,512,5.597402597402597

I thoroughly enjoyed these films and hearing the amazing music in its original state. This is a quality DVD set with each movie on a separate disc. Purchase and enjoy these light films that record a historical version of America and the performing arts of the past.

There are two minor complaints about the set. The first movie ""Babes in Arms"" has a lower audio quality than the rest, which is very sad at times as though the DVD were a warped record wavering the violins up and down. Most people won't recognize this, perhaps. The other is that though each film is a little different, there are over-arching themes and lines that seem repetitive when you watch the films back to back. I would suggest spacing them out in order to get the full enjoyment. For example, they say lines about Abercrombie & Fitch in two of the movies, they also have a minstrel show that feels like the same experience twice over. Of course, these movies don't take themselves too seriously, so though some material is recycled, it can still be enjoyed.",1419724800,,1158,4.5673076923076925

4670413,5,B005F265FW,"It's too easy to dismiss theses 4 movies as silly fun. They show two A-list child stars maturing in their craft and bodies. It's fascinating to watch how in 4 short years Judy turns from a plane Jane to a glamorous leading lady. Mickey seems to be historically under looked as a talent because of his great ability to be a ham, do `stick' and physical comedy. But in each movie he shows incredible talent in musical insterments. The drums in 'Strike up the Band', a truly awesome banjo solo in 'Babes on Broadway' and playing Gershwin on the grand piano in 'Girl Crazy' with Tommy Dorsey. All very complicated pieces that he played with ease and abash. He's a great athletic dancer too. He actually got an Oscar nomination for one of these. The patriotism of the first 3 movies before we entered the war is strongly contrasted with the 4th after we had entered WW2 which makes no mention of it and waves no flags.  Mickey unfortunately never gained height and his extreme shortness really doomed his career. Sad for such a very talented person. He still worked a lot but became a character actor. Of course the year after 'Girl Crazy' Judy did 'Meet me in St. Louis' so her career did the exact opposite of his...Skyrocketed. That said he's still ALIVE and WORKING his IMDB credits are truly amazing.
  These are really terrific movies on many levels but really are just an excuse for some great musical numbers from 2 very endearing stars.
The finale of 'Girl Crazy' holds up the best and is indeed the finale of their collaboration.
**Note there are 3 Andy Hardy movies that Judy was in with Mickey that are different from this set. These are NOT Andy Hardy movies! Absolutely worth owning even if you just watch the musical numbers over and over.",1379030400,13,1749,4.5814696485623

I love these movies, and have since I was a small child. Along with the Andy Hardy movie series, they give a glimpse of what family life should be like, but probably never has been. Judy sings like an angel and Mickey has more energy than seems possible for one human being. Wonderful - let's hope the whole of the Andy Hardy series are re-issued soon.",1370649600,,476,4.678571428571429

4670432,2,B005F265FW,"Our family was disappointed in these films. There are several interesting performances by Mickey (playing drums and piano) but overall, his Andy Hardy and horse movies are much better and more entertaining. The musical dance production numbers directed by Busby Berkeley in these movies are very strangely overdone. ""Love Finds Andy Hardy"" is a great Rooney-Garland classic and a much better choice, in my opinion.",1354147200,,414,5.384615384615385

4670434,4,B005F265FW,"In the early to mid 1940s, the Judy Garland-Mickey Rooney team was THE team in Hollywood movies.  These movies(with Girl Crazy being the best), show us why they were indeed the best- and reveal an America that is completely different than todays America.  Highly recommened.",1342137600,11,274,5.066666666666666
4670435,5,B005F265FW,"How I long for the days of the 30s, 40s and early 50s of film, when it was entertainment and not some socially-laced, comment or an hour and a half of Computer Aided Special Effects, with cars and people, along with planes, and buildings exploding, to fill and satisfy the need, the insatiable desire for destruction,  of the lowest common denominator, which has seemed to have taken the lead, culturally speaking, in this wonderful country of the United States of America...What a disappointment Hollywood has turned into, in the film industry. Hollywood is just a fantasy in its own right, as most of the studios no longer exist and have not for all too many years, but what Hollywood is today, are a few of the Entertainment type television programs, such as ET, which conjure-up images and photos and videos of a few obscure stars, if I may, and if it were not for Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt, some of those programs would go off the air in one night...In any case, this is about the Rooney & Garland DVD release from TCM. It is a must own for anyone, who enjoys being entertained. From the youngest child to the oldest senior, this is as good as it comes and in my opinion, Mickey Rooney is perhaps the most important actor of this genre and time period and should have been honored as 'Entertainer of the Century'. Judy Garland for the female running, should have the same accolades and honors. They are two of the most talented and interesting people of the 20th century and without them, film would not be complete. I play one of the four offerings at least, once a week, for it brings me back to my younger days, growing up in the 50s, which was a time I hope we could have revisited for the many young children today. Mickey and Judy's plots are basically all the same, as the basis for all of these movies was, the ""Show Must Go On."" But this is what is entertaining about this collection and it is pure enjoyment, from beginning to end. As I have already stated, it is a must, if you are a collector of film. You will absolutely love all of these movies. And, although several months away, it will make a very handsome Christmas gift, this year...!!!",1340236800,,2163,4.4759493670886075

4670438,5,B005F265FW,"TCM Greatest Classic Films-Mickey Rooney & Judy Garland DVD set is the buy of the year! The earlier 2007 full package released at $57 contained a terrific bonus disc. But here, you get FOUR individual discs - the same discs as in the full package release. Each is complete as originally, with loads of extras. The comments stating there no extras, and the listing stating 1 disc are wrong. Grab this collection of innocent simple fun musicals with Mickey and Judy at their youthful peak.  They don't make them like this anymore - silly perhaps but better than a sugar fix. The RRP of over $26 was a steal.
