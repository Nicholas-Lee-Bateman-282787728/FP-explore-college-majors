2852405,5,B000QXDCOC,"Great performance by all actors.  Joseph Cotton's character somehow detected Marilyn's lover and knocked he out.  I am not sure how he was able to detect who he was?  I had visited Niagara Falls (with parents) about the same time that this picture was filmed and remember all of the scenes, wearing the rain coats, being on the wooden walkways next to the falls, and being aboard the Maid of The Mist.  This film is a real Classic of All Time.",1452902400,,443,4.432098765432099

2852433,5,B000QXDCOC,"This is my absolute favorite Marily Monroe picture of all time. Her acting was superb in this film, and as was Joseph Cotten as her tortured husband. I have watched this movie many times on TCM and decided to purchase a DVD for myself. I was able to find a used copy in wonderful condition, and the seller shipped it to me promptly, at a great price!",1476403200,,350,4.2388059701492535

2852435,5,B000QXDCOC,"Had been waiting for a cheaper version of this DVD to come out. The price was right as other versions were more expensive. The quality of the playback was perfect. Great film, I have seen a number of times on TCM, but wanted my own copy. Marilyn Monroe is physically stunning which adds to Joseph Cotten's fine portrayal as the neurotically obsessed husband of Monroe. And the scenery of Niagra Falls adds to making this a great film",1472947200,2,433,4.564102564102564
