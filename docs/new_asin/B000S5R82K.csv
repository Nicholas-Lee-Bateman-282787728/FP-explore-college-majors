8204306,2,B000S5R82K,"This game strikes me as very low-budget, almost homemade. The DVD contains 2 discs, each of which has 6 games (a game consists of 6 rounds). Unfortunately, the ""rounds"" are simply poorly-proofread questions about movies. The questions themselves are OK, but they'd work just as well in a trivia board game. Words are misspelled, and in a couple of instances, the answers they gave were wrong. There are no movie clips, and each game takes less than half an hour. Plus, on the spine of the game, it says ""music"" even though the game is clearly movies. That pretty much summarizes the quality of the game. I'd pay maybe $1 for this, but no more.",1482364800,,643,4.6
