8709415,5,B00V6RB1TU,this is a awesome movie. this movie is about the true story of one mans survivle in ww2 Loui Zamprini. this is probably one of the best true story war films i have seen. It actually is not about the war but about a man surviving the war and the prison camps. He showed everyone how strong he was by not giving in to the abuse of his captors and showed everyone how he overcame the truma and found his faith. great movie. He is the one person that i know from the war that actually travelled to another country and forgave his captors thats a real man of god. He sounds like a good person to know and will be missed. The actor who played Zamprini did a good job and anjalina jolie did a great job on directing this film. the story is good and the acting is amazing. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do. Thanks Louie for all you have done for this country and helping other people out. May he rest in piece,1435708800,2,924,4.054644808743169
