1828949,2,B000087F66,The movie was grade Z budget. They used that junky digital camera stuff to make it. I rented it because it had a cool cover but when I saw the first few seconds and saw how cheap it was I almost shut it off. But I didn't and was strangely entertained by it. The last half hour was dumb but if they had a budget and a little more talent this movie might have been pretty good. The Scarecrow looked cool though.,1061942400,4,409,4.0
1828950,1,B000087F66,"I am getting really tired of renting these new straight to video horror films and getting nothing that shocks or scares me.  I read the back of this DVD case and I decided to rent it at the my  local video store.  I don't mind the bad acting or the bad script cause that is what B movies are all about.  Script was bad, but the overal story was even worst.
The story of a kid being picked on by everyone from his Mom's drunk boyfriend, to every popular kid at school, to even his teacher was a lame storyline for a backstory of a killer.  What made Michael Myers so scary in Halloween was we didn't know why he was crazy.  Now this poor kid dies and some how and someway his spirit goes into a scarecrow out in the fields and then goes for his revenge.  OK, why would I be scared of a guy trying to get revenge on all the people who tortured this poor kid?  I wouldn't be scared, but I would root for the guy to get his revenge.
The director in the ""Behind the Scene"" extra talks about his mentor's Dario Argento, John Carpenter, Wes Craven etc etc etc. He even gives them thanks before the credits roll at the end.  But this director has no clue what made those great horror directors so great.  He then said he wanted to tap into what the kids today like.  Horror, matrix style fighting, and comic book style.  OK, horror fans DO NO, I repeat DO NOT want to see a Scarecrow do flips OK!  Top it all off we have another killer trying to be FUNNY.  Freddy Kruger might have popularized the comedy line before or after killing someone, but it was the first Nightmare On Elmstreet everyone calls the best because it was creepy, scary and NOT FUNNY.
The only thing that was good was the makeup of the Scarecrow which really looked fabulous.  The main heroin was great, but the plotline just wasn't scary and you ended up not carrying.  Also never start off a story by saying there will be a suprise twist at the end. BTW, the suprise twist you can see coming a MILLION and ONE MILES away.
Also these new horror movies of today are just too slick.  I hate the digital shot ones.  Even with low budget (This movie was shot in 8 days) still it came off too slick.  I think these new directors need to go back and watch the great horror movies of the 70's and 80's and learn why these films where so good.",1061596800,2,2298,4.170068027210885
1828951,1,B000087F66,"This reminded me of the toxic avenger, however, it wasn't even that good! beyond B movie! bad qaulity, bad editing, bad acting, bad FX, really really bad lines (although what is really sad was some of the lines where the best part of the movie)
  note: to the guy that said all horror movies are bad, and compare them to this one: your nutz! this is way down near the bottom of the barrel for horror movies. Try hellraiser 1 or 2, Friday 13th parts 1-3, nightmare on elm st 1-3 (I could keep going, but you all get the point)",1052265600,,525,4.188118811881188
1828952,3,B000087F66,"Okay, there's not much that I can say that every other reviewer has said thus far.  True it's badly acted and written but on the other hand the story is good, or at least the concept anyways.  They spent some time on the scarecrow costume so the finished product looks great.  Anyways, if you are a fan of cheesy horror movies (and who isn't?) at least watch it once, or add it to your collection like I did.  It's good for a laugh and/or a cheap thrill, (not to mention your own Mystery Science Theatre impersonation).",1051574400,,519,4.375
1828953,1,B000087F66,"I gotta say that this show was just sad.  But then again...
nowdays what horror movie isn't.  If I had to edit out all the bad acting and unnecessary dialogue throughout the movie then there wouldn't be enough film left to create a trailer.  Basically this show is about a kid who gets picked on...gets killed...becomes a scarecrow (without any explanation on how that happened)...comes back and gets revenge on the people that picked on him...then he gets himself killed (again).  The only thing that I can honestly say was decent about this movie was the gore factor...and even that got tired after a while.  I mean everyone that died was spitting up blood regardless of how they were killed and it seems all this gore was put into the movie to keep the audience hooked.  The worst thing was the acting and unnecessary dialogue.  Examples are the boy's mother and the dates she brings home to the trailer (bad acting and some totally unnecessary parts).  Next would be the sheriff and the deputy...the grave digger and is daughter...the three guys telling stories in the cornfield...I mean did these people even go to acting school or what.  Not that they were the only ones with bad acting...in fact to be honest no one in that show could act.  I could go on and on and on about everything that's wrong with this movie but I can only use 1,000 words or less in this review, which is about 5,000 words too short.  I'm a fan of horror films and I'm always hoping to see a good B rated horror movie but this definitely wasn't it.  If you see this in a rental store and you think it looks good...I suggest you rent something else.",1051401600,,1629,4.503401360544218
1828954,2,B000087F66,"I think there have been a handful of these death-animated slasher-scarecrow movies, all of which seem to come complete with a whole mass of acting and continuity problems. This one is no exception. As far as shooting, casting and special effects went, this movie reminded me of Bloody Murder 2, and it even had this chick from Bloody Murder 2. There are a scatter of hot-looking girls, which is cool. And another good thing is that, in this movie, you look forward to seeing just about everyone die.
There's this skinny high school kid that's constantly getting picked on by all of the nancy-boy bullies; this part of the movie is familiar enough. But they went overboard. The ridicule is just a little over the top, complete with a teacher that calls the kid white trash in front of a whole classroom; I don't think they can really get away with that kind of stuff these days, can they? Anyway, the little chick from Bloody Murder 2 is the only one that defends the guy. And he's in love with her. Then, the skinny kid sees the Bloody Murder chick kissing the pudgy football punk that ridicules him the most. Enraged, the kid goes home, and promptly walks in on his lowlife mother and some pot-bellied slouch fornicating like dogs. The slouch ends up killing the kid, and his soul jumps into the body of a very horror-movie-looking scarecrow.
This could have been cool, but they just messed it up. For some reason, the Scarecrow, armed with two small scythes, has to enter every scene with a spinning Power Rangers flip. Uggh. And, they gave him this stupid Freddy voice complete with a full arsenal of cheap one-liners. Uggh #2. Now, this is an area in which the time-honored techniques of the main man, Vorhees, divide the neophyte johnny-come-lately slashers from the true masters. Vorhees just goes in and does his thing, never stopping for some kind of jerkweed Freddy comment, just getting business done. Yeah baby. But, the Scarecrow does kill the football punk by cramming an ear of corn into his ear, and he does another creep with the let-you-see-your-heart-before-you-die trick. So, I mean, the movie does have its moments. However, next time, I'd go with alot more Vorhees and ALOT less Freddy.
The Bloody Murder chick ends up burning the Scarecrow, but it seems that he now has the ability to soul-transfer at will. Ostensibly, he can't be destroyed---so I guess his ghost haunts the images of a sequel yet to come. Maybe they'll get the formula straightened out by then.",1051056000,3,2485,4.728110599078341
1828955,2,B000087F66,"don't think i've ever been real impressed by any of the scarecrow films even though there's only like 4 or 5 of em.  they must be hard to make.  this movie tried wayy to hard, the scarecrow tried to have a personality like freddie krueger but was more ridiculous than anything.  was fairly entertaining and had a few cool death scenes but other than that i can't say i highly recommend this movie.",1050710400,,397,4.410958904109589
1828956,2,B000087F66,"I hoped for an atmospheric, suspenseful and classy horror movie, but unfortunately none of those qualities are found here. All the characters are caricatures, the tongue in cheek humor falls flat, and the overdone, often grotesque acting grates. The gore is fine, but the stalking scenes have no buildup and no tension, so it's hard to care. This could have been so much more - the elements for a good horror show are here, including nice photography and special effects, but there is no solid foundation to lay them on. Those who crave gore for its own sake probably won't be disappointed, but more discerning horror fans will only be frustrated by all the missed possibilities in Scarecrow.",1050624000,2,692,4.872881355932203

1828959,3,B000087F66,"Scarecrow a number of things to like in it.  The colorful lighting and cinematography pay a reverential nod to Dario Argento, and scream queen Tiffany Shepis is always nice to see, but the film would have been better if the scenes with the Scarecrow had been played straighter and not been so jokey with the kills.  That said, Scarecrow is a competent little B-flick with a few fine performances, most notably from the aforementioned Shepis and Richard Elfman, in a dual role as Sheriff Patterson and the redneck named Hewitt.",1125964800,3,526,4.833333333333333
1828960,1,B000087F66,"Let's start with what's good in this movie. The scarecrow was pretty creepy looking. Ok, we're done with the good, now the bad. Do we start with a script so bad that even an infinite number of monkeys with an infinite number of typewriters would never write it or do we begin with acting as hambone and scenery chewing as a high school play. Perhaps we should go right  to the incompetent directing. Emmanuel Itier has a credit at the end of the movie with a laundry list of directors and writers he says have inspired him including John Carpenter, Stephen King, Wes Craven, and Dario Argento. After the inspiration kicked in, he should have paid attention and learned something from them. This movie is horrible and I want my $2 rental fee back.",1118707200,,746,4.567164179104478
1828961,4,B000087F66,"While the story begins with a boy that is teased and tortured by everyone around him, including his alcoholic mother and the girls at school he likes, it quickly turns into a blood bath when Lester becomes the mythic Scarecrow. Over the next hour, blood murder and revenge soaks the screen red. The plot also has a trippy, fun twist ending. Always a plus.

This film has nearly every type of bloody murder possible AND a martial arts master Scarecrow, what's not to love?

Is it the best horror movie ever made? No. But it's better than most other direct to video horror movies, and the soundtrack is even great. Check this movie if you're looking for something gory and VERY fun.",1114819200,2,680,4.565573770491803
1828962,5,B000087F66,"I had a blast with this movie. This movie was not intended to be taken a serious horror. This is both a tribute to and a parody of the works by low-budget horror masters like Argento, Fulci, etc. Watch the ""behind the scenes"" and you should pick up on this. Do not buy this expecting serious horror, but if you wanna have a good time and see a little gore, then go for it! For a movie that was shot in 8 days on a totally crapola budget, this is awesome!",1113264000,3,454,4.0
1828963,2,B000087F66,"As many have mentioned, director (?) Emmanuel Itier claims he has been influenced by Dario Argento, John Carpenter, Troma, and George Romero.  Can you arrest someone for directing under the influence?

SCARECROW is Carrie reborn.  The put upon young geek who nobody likes but one girl, naturally..and even she's not sincere to the heart.  But anyway said geek gets killed by mom's disgusting lover, and his soul goes into a scarecrow and the revenge begins.  Handled with a little more style and originality, it could have been passable entertainment.  But the Matrix jumps, the Freddy attempts to be funny, and the unrelenting gore plummet this movie into the depths of the B bin.  Tim Young as Lester looks like he's 30 years old; the teacher makes the wicked witch of the west look saintly, and the overall acting is essentially rotten.  I have never seen so many wasted scenes of the moon, clouds racing across the sun, and other padding scenes.  The musical score is relentlessly bad and boring.

No surprises, no genuine scares, and the behind the scenes documentary is a hoot.",1091318400,5,1083,4.868852459016393
1828964,1,B000087F66,"i just cannot believe how terrible this was. the box art looked cool, but it just turned out to be another crappy wannabe horror ""movie"" that was made in the 1990's or 2000's. don't get me wrong, i LOVE 70's-80's horror movies. i live off of them. halloween(none of the sequels though), friday the 13, madman, the funhouse, texas chainsaw massacre(the remake was pretty cool), suspiria, the shining, black christmas, all of those 70's 80s slasher/horror movies. they are wonderful. but this trash, it is just so bad. no suspense, no atmosphere, nothing. and how cool the crow looks means nothing. it is overridden with crappy effects, terrible plot(who wouldn't kill of those a**holes if they had the chance!?), TERRIBLE cast, no hot girls, especially judy, ughh, talk about a serioulsy hideous...thing, i guess, but i don't want to call her that, that is an insult to that movie the thing(great). lets just call her an hideous, ugly, disgusting piece of s***. the guy who kills the nerd kid looks like mario mixed with some inbred idiot, none of the characters are likable. i am not even sure if this movie takes itself seriously. it gives me a headache watching it. and the worst part it, the incompetent excuse for a director on the behind the scenes crap said tobe hooper, wes craven, dario argento influenced his life and he gave them a big thanks. he probably just said that so if they happened to see it(i don't know why they would)they would be like oh how cool, maybe i should direct a film with him. but the true disgrace, is that he said JOHN CARPENTER influenced his movie. THAT IS TOTAL BULL!!!! this movie has boring gore, nothing to hold your attention, unrealistic deaths, every time someone died they made this annoying moaning noise. carpenter believed in suspense, atmosphere, creepy settings, but this guy totally relies on gore. i love gore(check out the prowler and the burning), but this guy uses boring gore like blood shooting out of peoples mouths and all this crap. please avoid this, at all costs. -100000000000000000000000 out of 5. like all of those crappy troma films, this does not take the horror genre seriously and should not have ever been made. it sucks. go watch the funhouse instead, now THAT, is a wonderful slasher film. all slashers of the 70's 80's are, for the most part, these are A films to me, but scarecrow, just like most films made in the 90's and 00's(not including leprechaun, jack frost, and VERY few others) this is crap and should totally be avoided. I HATE TROMA AND THIS DIRECTOR AND ANYTHING THAT DISGRACES THE HORROR GENRE LIKE SCREAM, SCARECROW, TROMA, AND THAT DISGUSTING B***** THAT PLAY JUDY IN THIS MOVIE. AHHHHHHHHHH, STICK TO THE 70'S 80'S AND YOU CAN NEVER GO WRONG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

1828965,2,B000087F66,"I first heard about this film in a film-rental store's ""Upcoming Rentals"" catalog. The boxart creeped me out and the story seemed great! I rented this one rainy Saturday night a few weeks after it's release and my friends and I went home to watch it. We turned out the lights and prepared to be scared. We were mistaken. Not only does this involve a no-name cast (Some of which are actually okay), but a poorly produced and directed film overall. This is in the same category as Cabin Fever. The one thing that busts my button is when the scarecrow pulls the heart of the black boy out and then thorws him to the ground and then you can still see him breathing.... Anyways, another thing that kinda disappinted me was the overall effect of the film...sad. The actor who played Stephanie's boyfriend was pretty sexy though and I found myself looking at him mostly thoroughout the film. If someone remade this, say Wes Craven or Steven Spielberg, this film would be great. A different cast, a better script, a better director...

7979781,2,B000087F66,"I never thought I'd live to see another movie that almost had the same bad quality as Plan 9 from Outer Space.  Scarecrow comes the closest I've ever seen, even beating Battlefield Earth.  It's so bad that it's actually funny; Not good, funny.

Scarecrow stars a 30 year old high school student, a porn star, the directors friends and Earl Hickey.  After being pushed to the edge by everyone, Lester Dwervick  ends up dead, but his vengeful spirit lives on in the body of a scarecrow and begins taking his revenge, one by one on everybody who did him wrong, while coming up with several contrived excuses to do acrobatic flips over what ever obstacle happens to be present.  As the bodies begin to pile up, it's up to Tiffany Shepis to combat this evil scarecrow who is armed with the worst one-liners in history.

The thing I noticed straight away with Scarecrow is that it isn't scary.  This isn't helped by the scarecrow uttering the most ridiculous lines ever thought up.  This can best be summarised in the scene when the Scarecrow makes it's first appearance.  Picture it like this.  It's close to midnight, there's a low lying fog, there's very little light, and Earl Hickey is wandering along, drunk as a skunk, cursing the late Lester Dwervick, calling him an idiot.  Suddenly, from within the darkness, a hollow deep voice booms, ""Takes one to know one; Idiot!""  I laughed the soda was a drinking through my nose when I heard that.  There's absolutely no pacing or effective use of stillness. The Scarecrow just can't get enough of the spotlight, back flipping off car roofs and displaying himself from the earliest opportunity, even in broad daylight.

The actors are all terrible, and look like they're in this film because they're the directors friends, giving it that Ed Wood feel, and possibly the same Ed Wood magic.  Tim Young dose not look like a high school student, and Tiffany Shepis wins all the Razzie awards for Most Obviously Crowbarred-In Love Interest, Most Irritating, Most Stereotypical Beautiful Heroine, and Lifetime Achievement.  However, speaking in Ms Shepis defence, Halle Berry could've have played the roll, and the character would still have failed because there was simply nothing to play.  The dialogue she had to work with and the character development were utter garbage, not helped by the fact that the character she's playing is a Mary Sue.

Despite all the flaws I mentioned, I kept watching until the end, laughing all the way and even shaking my head at the obvious shock ending that's about as shocking as that ninja baby on YouTube.  Still, after watching the whole thing and getting a good laugh out of it, I have found that after putting it back on my shelf, I have no desire to watch it again.",1321747200,,2745,4.751054852320675

Nothing really fits the mood better then a scarecrow themed flick to bring us to the nice frame of mind. While cruising through some online choices we stumbled across a film we'd noticed years ago but never got around to renting called Scarecrow. Judging from the cover it had promise of delivering the B-ness we always look for with also some high hopes of actually being creepy. Well unfortunately within the first minute we came to the realization this one couldn't even be enjoyed for laughs...something that is very hard not to accomplish when it comes to the Super Sid brothers.

The film starts out with some kid getting impaled with a pole while trying to fix his mustang on the side of the road, and goes so quickly downhill from there without chance of redemption.

I'm surprised so many reviewers didn't mention this. Once I saw the age discrepancy, I knew I was in for it.

The scarecrow costume wasn't bad and maybe the best thing about this film. In all fairness, though, the kill scenes were decent and entertaining.

I purchased the DVD that has Scarecrow and Scarecrow Slayer on one disc.

Now, don't expect phenomenal quality in terms of compression. There is some fine grain which is always present throughout the film but what do you expect from such a production. Pray this never goes to Blu-Ray.
