2874401,4,B000RPOCMA,I saw this at the Angelica months ago without any expectations or thoughts on air guitar.  By the end I was so caught up in the competition and performances I found myself cheering.  The final winning performance from the one who would be crowned air guitar international campion has to be seen to be experienced.  I found myself recommending this film all over the place. The soundtrack is fantastic too.,1186963200,,405,4.757142857142857
2874442,5,B000RPOCMA,"I just watched this movie the other day, and let me just say that it was amazing and funny. everyone should check it out",1322956800,,120,4.041666666666667
2874443,5,B000RPOCMA,"If you're under 60, you've played air guitar at some point in your life - and not just as a child.  Even Mr. Bigtime Lawyer or Dr. Smartypants still knocks out a few major riffs when no one is looking - don't try to deny it (unless you've sold your soul to Guitar Hero).  What you probably don't realize is that air guitar is no longer just the stuff of private bedroom concerts and junior high talent shows - there's a freakin' world championship of Air Guitar held every year in that bastion of rock `n' roll nirvana.  I'm talking, of course, about Oulu, Finland.  Yes, the city that gave the world composer Leevi Madetoja and black metal band Impaled Nazarene - and rebuilt itself out of the ashes of a devastating fire in 1822 - has played host to the annual Air Guitar World Championships every August (when the temperature can rise as high as 64 degrees Fahrenheit) ever since its creation in 1996.  When a couple of plucky Americans (Kriston Rucker and Cedric Devitt) read about the event in the august Wall Street Journal, they decided to experience the magic for themselves - only to discover, to their horror, that America was not and had never been represented in the sport.  They resolved to do something about it, establishing an American championship and sending the winner to compete on the world stage.  The rest, as they say, is history.

The 2003 East Coast regional takes place above a strip club in New York City's Pussycat Lounge.  Thanks to some last-minute promotion by Howard Stern, hundreds have to be turned away after the place fills up.  Those lucky enough to make it in should all have T-shirts saying ""I was there when C-Diddy first took the stage.""  Oh, there are some gifted performers there that night, including Dan ""Bjorn Turoque"" Crane, but David ""C-Diddy,"" in his red Oriental robe and ""Hello Kitty"" breastplate, blows out the competition.  Unbowed, Bjorn Turoque heads out west for the West Coast regional, looking for a rematch with C-Diddy - if he can get by the likes of cubicle-dwelling government worker Gordon ""Krye Tuff"" Hintz.  The ultimate winner is Finland-bound, where, for the first time, an American will unleash his air guitar chops on the world stage.

The documentary focuses primarily on C-Diddy and Bjorn Turoque, letting us get to know them personally to see how their Air Guitar personas differ from their normal selves.  Stylistically, they could not be more different.  While C-Diddy is, in a word, unique, Bjorn's old school style puts one very much in mind of Keith Richards or The Kinks.  C-Diddy manages to be supremely confident without ever becoming overbearing or a product of his own ego, while Bjorn's relentless pursuit of a championship can make him seem a little overbearing at times - but he acquits himself well in the end.  There are no bitter rivalries here, and it's nice to see all of the air guitar champions from various nations all across the globe competing in such a friendly manner.

Naturally, there is a fair amount of humor in Air Guitar Nation, even aside from the actual performances themselves.  The Air Guitar boot camp is really something to see.  I'm still not sure why the champions of their various nations need Air Guitar training just prior to the World Championships, but it's great fun to hear the instructors talk about the spiritual elements of Air Guitar, techniques for maintaining your instrument (seriously) and how to deal with groupies.  Finally, the actual Air Guitar World Championships are truly something to behold.  I have to admit I was on the edge of my seat, cheering C-Diddy on for all I was worth.  I was a little disappointed that we didn't get to see more of the actual performances of all the contestants - but maybe that's included in the special features (I don't know because I watched Air Guitar Nation on NetFlix).

So, yeah, the whole Air Guitar thing is kind of silly, but it's just the kind of thing that makes our lives of quiet desperation so worth living.  If you can't watch and enjoy the heck out of this documentary, you're a total square, man.  I know I'll never play Air Guitar the same way again.",1312675200,,4133,4.712100139082058
2874444,4,B000RPOCMA,"I thought this ""rockumentary"" was great. It was a great look at a unique culture, and had a feel good ending.",1309478400,,109,4.238095238095238
2874445,5,B000RPOCMA,"Since there has been rock n' roll, there has been air guitar. For decades, air guitar was something that you did behind a locked, closed door. But no more - some enterprising people have established an Air Guitar World Championship in Oulu, Finland. The documentary Air Guitar Nation focuses on several American contestants for the coveted championship.

Viewers meet many great characters. David ""C Diddy"" Jung is one of the favorites for the title - much to the consternation of his Korean-American parents who wanted him to become a doctor or a lawyer. C Diddy uses a ""Hello Kitty"" backpack as a breastplate during his performances. One of C Diddy's main rivals is Dan ""Bjorn Turoque"" Crane, who often comments on the deeper meaning behind air guitar.

Viewers have to see some of the other contestants to believe them. One man performs in the nude while another plays air guitar to Christian rock from his wheelchair. All hope to impress the judges by demonstrating an ill-defined quality called ""airness.""

It's hard to say what makes Air Guitar Nation a winner. There are great tunes, interesting characters, and lots of humor. My wife and I watched with our ten-month-old daughter and she happily bounced along to the songs. In the end, the film is goofy, good fun that gives the viewer a different slice of life.",1282435200,,1320,4.857777777777778
2874446,5,B000RPOCMA,This DVD is a fascinating insight into a truely amazing musical competition. I particularly enjoyed the performance of Roxy McStagger from Australia and believe he was the true winner.,1258934400,,184,5.379310344827586

2874451,3,B000RPOCMA,"Air Guitar Nation is one of the stranger documentaries that I've seen in a while. The film chronicles the events leading up to and including the World Air Guitar Championship of 2003 held in Oulu, Finland. More than this the film tells the personal stories of two of the United States competitors, David ""C-Diddy"" Jung and Ben ""Bjorn Toroque"" Crane as they compete for national and world fame as air guitarists.

Alaxandra Lipsitz's documentary is one of those strange films that holds you fscinated while you wonder why on earth you are taking the time to watch this film. Weaving interviews with competitors and the founders of the US Air Guitar Championships along with performance footage the film gives a fairly good overview of the hobby/sport.

This is not deep drama but Lipsitz pulls it off well and the short film is fun to watch even if it is all essentially good fun. The film boasts a great soundtrack and aroun 40 minutes of deleted scenes and bonus interviews. Rent it before you buy.",1227225600,,999,4.735632183908046
2874492,5,B000RPOCMA,"Every now and then I get in a mood to watch a truly goofball movie, and I rented this thinking it would be one of them.  And it is, I guess... at least, it started out that way.  But in spite of myself I started getting really caught up and rooting for the American air-guitarists through the competition, and actually caring!

It was really rather profound to realize that although the US is the womb, birthplace, and cradle of Rock-and-Roll, there had never yet been a US contestant in the world air-guitar championships.  Hard to explain how something can have you laughing one minute, and saying ""Hmm...."" and sniffling the next... what a roller-coaster ride.  Kind of like, umm, Rock-and-Roll, I guess!

Oh, the music is the best of the best, too.  I was singing and dancing for days afterward.

Anyway it has really stuck in my mind, and here I am to buy my own copy to put on my shelf of ""movies I'm going to make everyone I know watch.""",1223251200,,944,4.4476744186046515
2874493,5,B000RPOCMA,"Air Guitar Nation is a truly wonderful documentary on the United States first entry into the Air Guitar Championships.  This film is just a great look into the comradery of international participants, the hell-bent fury of contestant, Bjorn Turoque, the intensity of the participants attending seminars on air guitar, etc.  It will make you wonder, it will make you laugh, it will make you go ""hmmmm"".  Overall, it is an honestly fun movie.",1208563200,,440,5.0
2874494,4,B000RPOCMA,"""Air Guitar Nation"" is probably the best documentary ever made about a non-subject.  Air Guitar, for those unfamiliar with the term, is the art of playing heavy metal guitar sans the actual guitar.  It's what every spastic, tone-deaf teenager with dreams of one day becoming the next Jimi Hendrix has done in the privacy of his own bedroom since the late 1960's.  Who could ever have imagined that a whole subculture and cottage industry would one day spring up around an activity that most of us probably never admitted to doing even to our closest buddies?

Yet, that is exactly what has happened, and in its rise to semi-""respectability,"" Air Guitar has gathered unto itself a bevy of impassioned, hardcore fans who see nothing crazy in cheering on a wannabe guitarist as he mimics the moves of actual music-making immortals like Jeff Beck, Jimmy Page and Eric Clapton on stage.  Indeed, the Air Guitar movement even boasts its own roster of revered icons and pioneers and has established well-attended competitions on the local, national and international level as a means of showcasing its finest talents and garnering itself some much-needed publicity.  The movie follows two of the key figures in the field, C-Diddy and Bjorn Turoque - each with his own very different hard rocker persona - as they head to the 2003 Air Guitar championship held in Oulu, Finland.

The basic charm of ""Air Guitar Nation"" lies in its ability to acknowledge the silliness of the whole concept while, at the same time, evincing a genuine, heartfelt affection for both the activity and those who participate in it.  Indeed, far more time is spent getting to know the ""musicians"" as people than in watching them actually perform.  What is most striking about the young men is just how reserved, shy and self-effacing they are by nature until they take to the stage and simply cut loose with all their wild gesticulations and antics at the behest of the adoring crowd.  It is then that they become truly transformed, so much so that even the most cynical scoffer may find himself caught up in the spirit of the moment, sweating out the contest's ultimate outcome right along with the participants.  The men also face their inexplicable status as celebrities with a clear-eyed rationality, not taking themselves or their accomplishments all that seriously (their satirical names alone reflect that playful spirit), a fact that makes the whole thing at least palatable for those who still may not quite ""get it"" even after the closing credits have rolled on by.",1199059200,,2542,4.91588785046729
2874495,5,B000RPOCMA,"No doubt about it, Air Guitar Nation rocks.  The competition is fascinating, as well as the stories of the film's two main subjects--C-Diddy and Bjorn Turoque.

After watching this film, I've been rocking on my imaginary guitar along with any song I hear...probably not the safest move while driving, but my chops need some work before the 2008 season starts.",1196899200,,359,4.966666666666667
2874496,3,B000RPOCMA,"3.5 stars

The hyperbole of the other reviews here is extreme; comparing this to Spinal Tap is way off base. It's nowhere near as funny, fresh, or ingenious. Yeah, it's good, but it ain't one of the great documentaries of all time.

This is indeed a fun film, full of good vibes and nice guys. But damn, it's just slooow at points! The filmmakers keep it basic, and I think they lost a lot of potential humor doing that.

I may be biased in that I saw The King of Kong a couple of months ago, and that to me was the truly classic movie others found this to be. Side by side, Air Guitar comes off as a student film, not technically, but in that while Kong often surprises and plays with your expectations, this film merely shows what happened, and somewhat blandly at times. AGN is just straight narrative, and while all the characters are pleasant, the only real pay-off is when C. Diddy gets the approval of his parents at the end, and his Mom does the metal sign. That was touching, but the rest of this movie was merely a fair doc on a funny subject, and nothing that really involved me. I just think it could have been cut and paced in a more rock and roll way, in light of its subject.

Hey, I love air guitar and real guitar, but I've seen way better air guitarists than this many times in many places. As far as humor goes, I laughed out loud during King of Kong nine times (I started counting after four; it's rare to get that many big laughs out of my jaded humor center); I didn't really have one gut laugh during this film. Just a lot of smiles. I'm all for smiles, but they ain't belly laughs.

I liked AGN, but it's far from a masterpiece. No offense to those who love it---each of us must march to his own (air) drummer. Diddy and Bjorn are nice guys, but wait until Billy and Steve get on dvd; now that's some truly five-star goofiness.

I've watched Spinal Tap more than a dozen times; I don't regret watching Air Guitar Nation, but I doubt I'll ever want to see it again.",1191110400,2,1988,4.218421052631579
2874497,5,B000RPOCMA,"This is not a goofball subject.  Air guitar is one of the unspoken truths associated with American culture since the early stages of rock.  Most of the people you see at one point in time indulged themselves in the apparitional past time.  This movie comes at a time when wielding the symbolic guitar is now approaching reality.  I was struck early on by the feeling of magical metal tempo surrounding me as I contorted and muttered the groans of approval on my stage I could take wherever I went.  My fingers on my hand danced seemingly close to the speed of light with the stage light eclipsed by the musings of others.

As a child, I took air guitar, we called it shredding, quite seriously, even more so after a horrible accident in a closet with my brother.  Inspired by some fresh Winger riffs our star studded dream took us into a whirlwind of uncontrollable fits until it all stopped after colliding our heads into each other.  I was unconscious for hours until I awoke and my parents explained that my brother had passed away.  To this day, I shred air guitar to his honor as he was probably the best air guitarist their ever was.  I honestly have no idea what happened in that closet dewd, but every time I watch this, you will be by my side.",1189036800,2,1252,4.427947598253275
