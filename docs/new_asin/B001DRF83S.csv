3537499,5,B001DRF83S,"DB GT perfectly married what I loved about the story and feel of DB with the scale and intensity the DBZ took the franchise to. I feel that the DB GT is the perfect crown to the trifectal series of the three and delivers in every way that it needs to. The story is great, the characters are great, the production values are better than ever, and it continued the story in a way that did not come across as a half-baked way to make money off of the name. As a long-time fan of the series I am well-pleased.",1451433600,,505,4.06

3537505,5,B001DRF83S,One of the best Japanese anime series ever created! No doubt about it... if you grew up in the 90's... you definitely knew about the ka-me-ha-me-ah!!!! Great series!!!,1440460800,,167,5.0
3537506,4,B001DRF83S,"I grew up on Dragon Ball Z, so when GT was announced (ages ago), I was quite ecstatic. The first season is a bit slow and the second season is better but the first season is a fun romp through the Dragon Ball universe, none the less. I just tend to view it as an alternate timeline. Don't be so uptight, don't flip out, just sit back and enjoy the ride.",1439942400,,353,3.9859154929577465

3537509,2,B001DRF83S,"I loved Dragon Ball. I loved Dragon Ball Z. And although my friends warned me that GT wasn't good, I went in with a positive attitude. I was thinking, ""it can't be THAT bad"". Oh no, it IS. The show is just nauseating and obnoxious, the plot makes no sense, the poor attempts at cliffhangers aren't good and won't keep you hooked, the characters act annoying, and on and on. The overall feel is different and more like some Saturday morning Kids WB thing. Pan is a stupidly annoying character that ruins the show more, and the little robot that follows them around is annoying too. Even Goku is annoying here, and I adored him in DB and DBZ. Don't buy this. Just don't. This is to me what Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde for the NES is to the Angry Video Game Nerd.",1433980800,,756,4.256944444444445

3537522,1,B001DRF83S,"There's something wrong with these disks, they are either damaged or bootleg copies because the video does not keep up with audio. I want a refund!",1395792000,,147,4.6923076923076925
3537523,4,B001DRF83S,"Yes, compared to Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z this series is not as great. Yes, it has it's inconsistencies. Yes, the soundtrack is dull. However, that does not make this series a bad series. Be grateful we have some more Dragon Ball action to watch! Also don't forget Dragon Ball Z also had it's inconsistencies with the series! Plus, there are plenty of memorable moments, especially Super Saiyan 4. This season does lack in the good stuff, season two has the better things in it, but what is season two without season one? I don't mind GT, it's not DBZ good, but it's still a decent series.

Now for the quality of this release! The Green Bricks(GT seasons one and two) are slightly zoomed in, but there's nothing like the Orange Brick(Dragon Ball Z season sets) hack job. The video is remastered, so you sacrifice the arguably annoying Dragon Box grain for some blur. Depends on what you prefer, some like the authentic grainy image. The colors are more pronounced on these brick sets, but again, purists complain that this is not the original image, so it gets back to an issue of preference. This release has good encoding (minimal macroblocking)These Green Brick has all three audio options for the series, English/JPN Music, English/English Music and the Original Japanese Dialogue with optional Subtitles.

Cons purists give you that I don't really mind:
Redundantly encoded 30i (hard-coded 3:2 pull down)
Blurry
No alternate angles.

These Green Bricks are your ideal choice if you want a complete set that is easy to find and affordable. You will be missing the JPN Title Cards and the Next Episode Previews, but I don't mind that at all. It's the best GT Funimation release in my opinion!",1393459200,,1701,4.798634812286689

There's a couple stupid episodes here & there, but need I remind you that even Dragonball had some bad episodes?  And they were alot worse than what's on here.  I'll analyze it in detail later, because I enjoyed it so much I got the complete series & it was only a little more expensive, so I gave this to my cousin, who was very grateful.",1365984000,,405,4.0375
3537533,5,B001DRF83S,"I loved dbz and db, but had never seen this series before. I looked at the reviews and a lot of them said it was just not the same.  I disagree, it was like a combination of the first two with a lot of similar villians.  Great series",1365724800,,233,3.8333333333333335

3537537,3,B001DRF83S,"I purchased this series because I love Dragonball and Dragonball Z. I had read mixed reviews on Dragonball GT so I did not have high hopes and unfortunately I was correct in holding back. This set reminded me of very bad reiterations of stories we have already seen in Dragonball. Many of the adventures are almost the exact same, I felt like they just gave up on writing. Therefore, it was not gripping and seemed very slow and dull to me. On the other hand, seeing Goku transform into SS4 is still pretty cool. I would only recommend this series to a hardcore db fan.",1358208000,,569,4.428571428571429

3537539,5,B001DRF83S,"One of the best Anime series ever! I am a hude DBZ fan, and was very cautious of this series (was not done by the original DBZ creator), but it was great and I think it actually beats DBZ.",1355875200,,188,3.8461538461538463
3537540,4,B001DRF83S,season 2 is better. the begginning of gt is slow while they look for the dragon ballz its not to exciting till the middle of the season.,1355270400,,136,4.074074074074074
3537541,4,B001DRF83S,"A lot of people wrote reviews saying to not buy this product, and skip to season 2, but DON'T do it. Because if you skip to season 2, you will feel incomplete and feel that you missed a lot. But anyways, dragon ball GT is an awesome series, although it's boring in the beginning, but it will get better once you've reached the baby saga. It has ssj4 goku and vegeta, ssj4 gogeta, and awesome villans. And by the way, buy this product so you understand the story better, and season 1 is when it says the problem and their mission.",1353456000,,529,4.247524752475248
3537542,4,B001DRF83S,"I bought this box set and traded in my individual DVDs of GT. There is a difference in the quality of this product and the original releases. Obviously it's cool that they put 34 episodes on 5 DVDs. I think all of us hate changing DVDs every 3 or 4 episodes. This set is remastered and is in 5.1 Dolby Surround. One of my favorite features is the marathon play. They have used this for the box sets from Dragonball up to this GT series. They also got rid of the ridiculous rap song that made you dumber every time you heard it at the beginning of the episodes. In this you get to watch the Black Star Ball saga and most of the Baby saga. It ends when Goku changes into the Super Saiyan ape/Super Saiyan 4 transition. I'm not as fond of GT as I am the Dragonball and Dragonball Z series. I kinda think that this is a cross between the 2. Goku being a child for most of the series, and some of the less serious bad guys give it a Dragonball feel. On the other hand the other characters and some of the battle scenes make it seem like Dragonball Z. It's a good mix of both, but not as good as either. If you like the Dragonball series this will probably make you happy. If you're gonna watch GT this is the way to do it. Enjoy.",1351641600,,1224,4.041152263374485
3537543,5,B001DRF83S,"It could be a never befo
re seen footage of the dragonball universe from dragon ball, dragon ball z and dragon ball gt and that includes dbz kai and dbz levels and please have the movies in the dragon ball seasons and dragon ball z seasons. And for the dbz levels please include the series and show everything like in dbz. But even more not only have the z-fighters lives from each series but when they were in peace time and when so parts they did not show like maybe it was a villian that was plotting to come to destroy the whole universe and as well even the after life. So especially in dbz Goku have to go in different parts of the universe and have not only the z- fighters but certain heroes like maybe an unlikely one like it could be a frieza like creature but he is good and he didn't want to be like his family. Also maybe a broly like person I know everyone calls him gay but this could be a like a mixture of a Goku and Vegeta time but he has the mass of broly and other creatures that might seem like past villians and it would be good that cell could comeback to life and he could be an allie. And at first Goku and the others don't trust him but he saves a worhty opponent his toughest foe he faced Adult Gohan and after they defeat the villians.

Gohan and Goku and Vegeta as well as Cell they could pratice fighting to get past their limits but they can change some of the parts like with Cell in Hell if Goku was in Hell. It could be Reborn Kid Goku against not only Frieza but maybe Cooler or BoJack oh what the heck throw 3 people all 3 of them in the mix. Also it could be Goku turns in to SSJ4t(Super Saiyan 4). Also it could be most of the actors and actress voices from each db universe saga from db to dbz levels because maybe serveral of the actors and/or actresses passed away. So it could be things you might knew like how old is Master Roshi by DBGT and How old was the Roshi's Master when Master Roshi was young Roshi and so for and  so on. And why noy? Show the parts when the actors and actress made mistakes or when the look on their faces when someone said a funny or powerful line. And it could be some swear words but like the series it could be an pg version and an uncut version (mature and sexual content) so minors cannot see the mature version they can see the pg so you would have to be 18 to whatever.

And the music should be american music and japanese music so no matter what your country is so say your in the u.s.a you can hear the english version no matter if your hearing the english voices or japanese and no matter what country it is in. It should be 2 versions in the blu-ray  pg version and the mature version. And for the arabic version I know it is no curse words in it but it might be sexual content so Bulma Mom might should hear body to Goku, Gohan and Vegeta at different times so depending on what country your in. It might be sex in their I mean humping and like say when Goku he beat Kid Buu on the same night when Kid Trunks and Goten were playing with Goku like they did fusiom. He turned into super saiyian and he was naked and people was laughing because he must of had a big you know what but i did not what to see that. In under countries around the world they might have showed it but I know straight guys like me did not what to see that but homosexuals and of course women fans wanted to see it.

If they have the full versions of everything it could be a ultimate bundle collection and it could be in 2014-2015 they can do it when they put their mind to it. And it don't have to cost and arm or leg to have it. You can have it at stores like walmart, Target,and other department stores and why not?
You can have it on qvc or hsn or both and their websites and it could cost about 500 to 800 dollars for everything and it could be an easy flex pay so it could be about around 80 something to about 140 something for 6 easy payments. And it could be an special offer and it could be free shipping and of course tax and the biggest scam in the world a recycling fee I am not going to get into that part everyone don't like it. And the plus side even though your making payments you can get it almost right away so if you want 1 or 2 day shipping it will cost a little more, if you don't want to wait for the standard shipping because alot of people don't want to wait. So if you want for the standard shipping it might take 5 to 14 days, not counting if their is a weekend and/or hoilday.

And before you say they cannot do that or it is too expensive they make so much money on the tv series and of course when it was in tape form to when it was in volumes at first from each series. And then they started seperate bundles and then they made a whole series bundle like in db, dbz, dbgt and that's not counting the epic games they made so they can afford. If you say they cannot afford it you will sound like a Ricky Ricardo type and by the way I'm not racist. So if you defend them being in their jock strap and getting your panties in  a bunch not talking about females. The guys they are not going to give you a game(s) are anything free the are about moneyn so if the owners of funimation ent. what to make alot more money that would be a good idea of they do it. Please cerain the possibilities I bought alot of the series and grow up watching it as a kid and as a Grownup I still like it.

But it would be good if they give a new look on things along with the old look. And mix it together, It is still fun a smile comes to face when I still watch the episodes of Goku whether it's DBZ or DBZ Kai and they should have alot of the orignal english music like when Vegeta was announced thought he was a super sayian and he said for the very first time Vegeta the super saiyan and the old music was epic when he was powering up for about 4 minutes and Piccolo was pondering in his mind. Like was vegeta this powerful all this time and he said he just stood their and watchm frieza was taking care of me easily and vegeta stood their a watched and if he had a that power along why did he help me against Frieza.

Also one of the best parts of season 3 when Piccolo when they taught Frieza was dead and they were happy the long on Krillin Face when he seen Frieza and when Frieza was about to kill Goku with a death beam Piccolo knocked Goku out the way and Frieza it Piccolo. And Goku told Krillin and Goku to leave and when Gohan didn't want to listen he did an attack and send Krillin fying and he blew him up. And Frieza said pop goes the weazel and Goku he felt like he wanted to cry but he was angry. He pleaded with Frieza and he said I want let you get away with this repeat him self the same thing and he just exploded like the power of an great ape i guess. He had the power of the creature in human form so say goku power level was 100 hundred because he was hurt by the battle his power level grow what you would call a one time thing or something that rarebut csn happen. His power grow to about 5 millon or better. A classic line by the orginal voice of frieza which was a woman voice I think it was the original voice of kid Goku the first original frieza in american version. Frieza said I will pay you back 10 no 1 thousand fold for each and every blow he delt to me, and of course probably the best part when Goku give Frieza some of his superb energy. Frieza was thinkiing about when alot of what happened when Goku arrived on the battle field against him and tghe spirit bomb and when Goku Transformed and the main thing that made him made that you were beat by a monkey and that what frieza said he wasn't smart he said im smart enough to defeat you.

So when Frieza got super mad and when Frieza was saying he was the smartest and strongest being in the universe no way even comes close and he was laughing. Goku senses a powerful blast and he said no matter what version it should always be that way no matter if it is DBZ levels if they ever continue and finish the series Goku said You Fooool. With an angry voices and it was awesome, and they can have the orignal music to season 4 when they had alot of the parts of season 3 in it and it was great the music and it was no words just the music. Dem Dem Dem Dem Dem Dem Dem Dem and when Goku had that blast on Frieza and of course when Goku Transformed for the first time and other seasons like the ending when they showed Gohan and he was walkimg and they had Piccolo watching Gohan. When he was a kid and he walked away with the wind blowing it was so epic when they was showing does episodes in the 90's on tv.

The last thing im going say bring back the american music and give us or choose to pick what music we want to hear no matter what series it is. Please send written reviews and video reviews if to the people of anime funimation entain. If you want an Ulitimate Bundle Collection like me.

I bought DragonBall GT with the assumption more is better, but after watching quite a few of these episodes, i can't recommend it. I don't think the plot is good. I don't think it was good enough to start a new season, I think it is ridiculous. It's either that or I'm too old. I'm not willing to admit I'm too old, so i'm rating this 2/5 stars.",1336262400,,404,4.1265822784810124
3537545,3,B001DRF83S,"The Dragon Ball GT Season One box set includes five DVDs that contain thirty-four episodes of the series.  The first four discs contain seven episodes, while the fifth disc contains six episodes and the extras.

On the main menu of the first four discs, you can choose to watch all the episodes, watch the disc with the marathon feature, choose which episode you want to watch, and set up your language and subtitle options.  One of the best features of this Dragon Ball GT set is the marathon feature; this allows you to watch all of the episodes back-to-back.  However, with the marathon feature, you only see the opening credits once, and the ending credits are not shown.  This feature is very helpful when you're trying to watch all of the episodes on a disc in a single sitting.

In the setup menu, you can choose between the English audio from when the series originally aired on television, the English dialogue with the original Japanese music, and Japanese dialogue and music.  In this menu, you can also choose to turn the subtitles on and off.

The menu on the fifth DVD adds in a link for the special features.  This set includes a textless opening and a textless version of the first closing song.  On these textless songs, the credit text is gone, but there are still subtitles that appear on the screen.  Also in the extras menu is a link for trailers.

Compared to Dragon Ball Z, it seems that the Dragon Ball GT episodes have a much better pacing; I definitely didn't feel nearly as bogged down with this series.  Even with the better pacing, I feel that Dragon Ball GT is overall the weakest anime series in the Dragon Ball franchise.

I would recommend this set to any Dragon Ball fan that must have all of the episodes of the franchise on DVD.",1330387200,,1764,4.541139240506329

3537549,1,B001DRF83S,"I bought Dragonball, Dragonball Z, and Dragonball GT, and watched them in  that order. It took me a while to do it. The first thing you need to know about Dragonball GT is the story makes no sense if you have seen Dragonball Z, and I am shock no fan reviewer has said anything! I want you fans of Dragonball to read this review carefully. The first problem is with the characters-they act dum, and I don't know if its the English soundtrack or what but the dialogue(the things they say) and there grammer don't sound right. It feels like Goku acts more childish than he should at times, he acted more adult when he was a kid in the first Dragonball series, and I hate that dam Giru! The story has little or no explination for anything that happens, examples inclued-One: the missing dragonballs, why not wish Goku was an adult again with the Earth or Namek Dragonballs?!-Two: Trunks makes a secret plan with Giru at some point, but they are never alone together before the plan is underway?!-Three: after Goku, Trunks, and Pan first meet and then blow to bits the evil Baby, he appears to be in three places at the same time!? First he latches onto Dr. Myuu to get off planet M2, then he's back on planet M2 latched onto General Rilldo, then he's on a random spaceship latched onto an alien boy?!- and Four: and it might just be me, but there is a missing sense of urgency-in the charachers-to save Earth by collecting the Dragonballs. Another problem is the fights, why dosn't anyone go super Saiyan for more than 10 seconds? Why have Goku and Trunks started to act weak, they wasted time fighting at what looks like 1/2 strength? The talking didn't help ether, they kept stating the obvious!  In closing a warning to fans that follow the story of Dragonball-!Dragonball GT is not for you! If however you don't care or don't know the full story and bad dialogue dosn't bother you then buy this boxset. I for one have buyers remores...",1304812800,,1935,4.50997150997151

While beiong shrunk down to a kid goku is off again for the Dragonballs. This time he searching the galaxy! While it start out how I love Dragonball to be is funny. Not very surprising since akira toriyama is the creator for the first ten episodes. After though it turns away to a side of Dragonball that me and many others have never seen. It is fast pased and action packed. The only problem is it stops right in the middle of the greatest part! Super Saiyan 4! So I would recomend on buying both seasons at the same time. or just the full two season special. It also comes with the story to what appens after Dragonball.

My advice to you, the good public, is if you're a collector of Dragonball, get both seasons. But get ready for a frustrating, boring and downright silly first few episodes. The fun begins on season one, at about the third disc I believe, the beginning of the Baby saga and progressively starts getting better. Be warned you're going to hate Pan, apparently she was supposed to be the spunky new character in the Dragonball universe who was supposed to be fearless and indepedent(for a little kid). Yet she comes off as a HUGE brat that grates on your nerves everytime they give her face time.

I personally love the series I felt like Pan, Goku, and Trunks searching for the dragonballs at the beginning of this series was a very nice nostalgic element to the series, getting ot see Goten, Trunks, Vegeta, Bulma, Gohan and the rest of the gang in their much older forms is pretty cool, especially if you've been following the series since you were a child, most fans grew up on the series, but newcomers can still enjoy this series (If you like GT, you'll love Dragonball and DBZ). This box set covers the Black Star and Baby sagas(though a few episodes of the Baby saga end up being on season 2). The Season one box set includes a booklet that gives you a brief summary on characters and episode descriptions, which is a very good tool for those who are new to the series or who want to come back later to watch their favorite episodes. The marathon feature is great for quicker viewing, they've got textless songs, andanese audio for those who want to see the series in its original form. The DVD includes 34 episodes on 5 discs, and although the first 15-16 episodes are entertaining, there's not as much fighting as hardcore DBZ fans are used to, but it quickly picks up as the Baby saga gets underway and continues onward from there. If you're a fan of the series, I recommend adding GT to your collection, and at the reasonable price 0f around $18, it's worrh it.",1273104000,,1464,4.507518796992481

3537556,4,B001DRF83S,"I must admit,I had my doubts going in to this show. I am a huge fan of Dragonball Z, having grown up with it, and had recently just finished watching the original Dragonball show. From reviews I read online of Dragonball GT though, I wasn't sure if this was going to be for me. People said it had plotholes, wasn't true to the original story, was slow and boring, etc.

But let me tell you, it isn't.

I actually quite enjoyed this season of Dragonball GT. It felt nostalgic, not only by placing Goku back into a child form, but also by finding the right balance between comedy and action, like Dragonball did. It was nice to see Trunks grown up as an adult who wasn't from the future, and it was also nice to see how Pan ended up, trying to follow in her Grandfathers footsteps. Giru was a little annoying at times though.

Overall, you get a nice introduction and foundation to what is a good show. While this box set is advertised as including the baby saga, it actually doesn't have the complete saga, with the last few episodes being in Season 2. You do however get to see SS4 Goku, who is pictured on the front cover, and I think he suits it nicely. I actually enjoyed this season more than the second one, so if you were like me and wondering whether or not to invest in this, take a chance on it, and I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.",1268784000,,1348,4.2784313725490195

3537560,3,B001DRF83S,"It has been 10 years since the pure hearted Goku saved Earth from the menace of Buu. Since he departed with the innocent Uub, a great deal as changed. Earth has been at peace and all of the characters we have enjoyed watching have grown up. Now, Goku has emerged only to find his very first enemy (quite old I might add) preparing to make a wish on the mysterious Black Star Dragon Balls. Like the first time Pilaf makes a mistake and wished that Goku be turned back into the child he first met all those years ago. Now the Dragon Balls have been scattered across the galaxy and if they are not returned to the planet the wish was made on in one year Earth will be destroyed. It is now up to the pint sized Goku, the matured Trunks and Gokus' fully grown granddaughter Pan to head out and search for the Dragon Balls.

Dragon Ball GT is the final chapter in the great Dragon Ball story and since its release in 1996 it received a great deal of flack from critics and fans alike. There are some strong points as well as weak points in this series, but summed all up it passes. I love the constant aging of the characters it is great to see characters like Trunks, Goten and Pan all grown up. Still as Vegeta says in the second episode the DB crew has grown soft. The show dropped a good portion of the drama and it seems that the writers tried far too hard to fill in the story with goofy and extremely cheesy moments. I mean yea Dragon Ball is known for that humor, but a good portion of it just seems so out of place. The fight scenes with the main villainous characters are awesome. They hit harder and are much more intense than Z. It is great to know that they still are bent on making stronger villains causing the heroes to tap into deeper stronger powers.  So far the first two sags of this short lived chapter I am sure are just the beginning of better things to come. So I guess now that Season one is wrapped up I have to see the final season. I just hope these little misses are taken care of.",1265846400,,2004,4.162371134020619
3537561,3,B001DRF83S,"I have watched GT season 1 and it is okay to good. It's a pity that Gohan has to be a bit boring and wearing a suit (thanks to his mother's influence when he was a child) & Chi Chi has changed alot from keeping her sons away from danger to supporting them to go into outer space.
After learning of the Tuffles and the Saiyans from King Kai from DBZ Season 1, I thought they both lived on the same planet and renamed it Planet Vegeta when the Tuffles were wiped out.
I certainly like the Baby saga especially when Baby Gohan fights Vegeta and grinds Vegeta's face into the road. There are a few good family moments like when Vegeta drives Bulla shopping and when Vegeta wants others to notice he shaved his moustache off.
It is good to see Vegeta has dropped the tough,arrogant attitude and become alot calmer and not often he flies into a rage. Piccolo doesn't get much of a part and it is sad to see Majin Buu go. I think it is a good way to have Buu merge with Uub instead of getting rid of Buu completely. Majin Buu's high pitched voice and innocent child like personality will be missed.
Trunks & Goten's character designs look different to the ones seen in the DBZ episode ""Granddaughter Pan"". They look & act a bit goofy sometimes. Vegeta is another character who looks different, in a bad way.

In the booklet, why isn't Goten,Gohan & Vegeta in the Hero section. They should of been there!

But the Black Star dragon ball saga is probably the dullest saga of all but the story of Planet Luud does fit in with the Planet M2 and Baby episodes. Maybe the trio could have gone to one of Freiza's old home planets that he took over before he was killed and fought the army that was still there to recover the dragonball. I did like the fight between Goku and General Rilldo. Also I liked General Rilldo as a character. Also there is a new type of Ginyu Force on Planet M2. They are sadly robots and not aliens but they call themselves the Sigma Force.
I think having SS4 Goku on the front cover shot is a good idea even though this transformation appears in the last few seconds of the last episode of Season 1. Other characters who would have been good to have on the front are Pan or Majuub.

It is a great idea that they fitted the 34 episodes onto 5 discs. They should have made that rule for some of the DBZ seasons which were under 30 episodes.
The thing with GT is that they only made 64 episodes and most storylines are resolved in a few episodes. Whereas in DBZ most storylines are dragged out for 15 to 20 episodes.

Ah yes, Dragon Ball GT.  I have actually not seen all of this series yet.  I had not seen any of it until I picked up this set at a local Wal-mart a few weeks ago.  Didn't go into this with very high expectations because of what I've heard from other fans, and I'm glad I didn't.  The first sixteen or so episodes are what Funimation dubbed ""The Lost Episodes"" and did not air them with the others.  If memory serves they took pieces of the first episode and sixteenth episode and put them together to create a new episode one.  Suffice it to say, Funi cut out most of the first sixteen episodes because they were, well, pretty awful actually.

The premise of the story is pretty silly: Emperor Pilaf (Yes, THAT Emperor Pilaf) has gathered the seven 'black-star Dragon Balls' in order to use them for some purpose.  Pilaf meets up with a grown-up Goku and a small conversation ensues.  At the end Pilaf yells at Goku ""I wish you were a kid again!"" and unintentionally uses his wish to revert Goku back to the size he was in the beginning of Dragon Ball.  Unfortunately for Goku and the gang the negative energy that is caused by the Black-star dragon balls will ultimately destroy the planet in which the balls happen to be on at the time of the wish unless they are gathered again and brought back to that planet within one year.  The next sixteen or so episodes are about Goku, Trunks, and Goku's granddaughter Pan on a mission to collect the seven black-star dragon balls.

After all of the 'Lost episodes' we are eventually introduced our first big enemy, Baby.  The introduction to the Baby arc is reminiscent of Cell episodes.  Baby's creator, Dr. Myuu, will remind many of Dr. Gero and Baby himself of Cell.  Don't expect the Baby arc to be wrapped up in this set because it's not.  If I'm remembering correctly there are still four or five more episodes involving Baby at the end of this first set.

At the end of this first set, or season as Funimation calls it, I am left thinking that DBGT is pretty bad.  I think it took me about two whole weeks to finish this, which is kind of a long time for only 34 episodes.  To sum up, DBGT does have it's good points but no one would blame you if you decided to pass this one up.",1236988800,,2277,4.350710900473934
3537571,2,B001DRF83S,"Dragonball GT Season 1 is the first half of GT.  Those of you that are familiar, or have watched the first Dragonball episodes before Dragonball Z, you will find Season 1 GT a graphically updated Dragonball.

Goku is turned back into a kid, by mistake, by Emperor Pilaf, the villain way back in Dragonball.  As a kid, he has to undergo a search for the Black Star Dragonballs, which scattered accross the entire galaxy, not accross the planet.

With a time limit of only one year, after which the planet Earth will explode if the Dragonballs are not gathered, Goku accompanied with Trunks and Pan (Gohan's and Videl's daughter), search for the dragonballs.  The adventures are downright silly, with off-beat humor, occasional short fights scattered throughout the episodes.

After passing half of the first season, you will understand the new threat to rise against the galaxy, and throughout the later episodes, Goku and company will rise to challenge it.  The battles are short and rather uneventful, and after Goku unsuccessfully stops Baby, he is saved from death by the Grand Kai, and is taught that he can tap into an even greater power by having his saiyan tail restored. Super Saiyan 4.

The final episodes show a revitalized Goku attempting once again to stop Baby.  He gets beat down, and then out of love and caring for his own people and planet Earth, manages to transform into a golden ape with the help of planet Earth (Baby used the collected Black Star Dragonballs to wish for planet Tuffle, his home planet, to orbit the sun next to planet Earth).

After Pan helps the ape rationalize his thoughts, and renew his vision of what he is really trying to accomplish, Goku gains full control of his newfound power, and transforms into Super Saiyan 4.

Season two of GT will pick off from there, comprising the true action and excitement of GT.

Dragonball GT Season 1 is basically nothing but plot development, leading up to a classic cliffhanger:  Goku manages to ascend to the next level, Super Saiyan 4, in an attempt to overcome and beat Baby, whose revenge includes taking over the entire Universe.  What power he has obtained, how strong he has gotten, and his battles as Super Saiyan 4 are not shown.  That will have to wait until Dragonball GT Season 2 comes out on February 10, 2009.",1234051200,,2304,4.739348370927318

3537573,4,B001DRF83S,"Just like the previous review, I will be making it about the set - and NOT THE SERIES! For starters, anyone who likes the series in general, this is a great and cheap way to see all the episodes! I got mine at Wal-Mart for only $29.96! FUNimation has been dropping prices lately, and let me tell you, it's a bargain! If you do the math, each episode is a little less than one dollar. Moving on, some of my favorite things about this box set is that the episodes have opening credits (it's just really cool to me), and the original Japanese songs are translated erasing the first ""rap"" theme. To me, that song wasn't that bad! Anyway, I do have 2 problems with the set and they both have something to do with the recording: I remember back in '06 when FUNimation said they were re-recording the dialogue and it seems they started with the DBZ sets, but now they keep saying ""don't miss scenes from the next..."" which is annoying to me because THERE ARE NO SCENES. And secondly, with the original Japanese music, I think the GT narrator (from english dialogue) has too much a deep voice to go with the soft melody of the episode recap music. Doesn't anyone agree? Otherwise, those 2 little problems, I feel it's a great set!",1230681600,,1222,4.411504424778761
3537574,4,B001DRF83S,"Unlike most of the people giving this a bad rap, I actually own the product in question. This is not just some kid howling because they hate DBGT since it's not as OMFG H4RDC0R3!!!1ONE!!!... THREE MONTHS BEFORE IT'S EVEN ON SHELVES. Come on.

The box itself is the same as the DBZ sets, although it is a few millimeters longer vertically, so it doesn't sit flush with the DBZ sets on a shelf. The booklet inside has some character biographies and short episode summaries. There is no ""About the Transfer"" blurb on the back of the booklet as there was on the back of the DBZ set booklets.

The transfer on here is pretty much on par with the DBZ remasters. Not a lot of spots or scratches to be found. There isn't any evidence of compression here even though they squeezed 34 episodes on 5 discs instead of the usual 6, so I was impressed. You are unable to switch the visuals to the original Japanese, so you're stuck seeing the ""comical"" Funimation episode titles.

The standard audio track is the 5.1 English dub with original Japanese audio, and they remade the opening track. Instead of the horrid rap track they originally made, they had Vic Mignogna sing the original Japanese track in English. Even if you switch the audio track to the US broadcast version, you will still hear this remade track. The rap version is nowhere to be found. The Japanese track is in mono as always.

Extras (on the 5th disc) are pretty sparse, following the recent DBZ box sets. You can see clean opening and ending videos as well as some trailers for upcoming releases, although they are a little dated. The Dragonball Z trailer is for Season Seven, which released last month. You'd think they would use the most recent trailer for Season Eight instead.

The set includes episodes 1-34 (Black Star and the majority of the Baby sagas), so it encompasses all of the ""Lost Episodes"" that were originally released out of order. The next box set, featuring SS4 Gogeta on the front, will include the last half of the series as well as the special ""A Hero's Legacy"" to wrap up the series. No release date was shown on the trailer.

3537576,2,B001DRF83S,"Ok, I'm an anime fan at heart.  I recently bought my 92nd anime show and am still going on...  Dragonball GT was the first anime I've collected.  When i heard about the actual dvd coming out remastered and in a Season box set, I got really excited and expected lots; especially since I've really LOVED the Dragonball Z Season sets (GO ANDROIDS!!) But anyways, for some strange reason, my best buy likes to put things on shelf a week before they are REALLY supposed to be released.  Knowing this, I hopped on over and purchased the season 1 set.  Little did I know, the format of the show had completely changed.  First of all, I like my anime how it's supposed to be and I can't stand when the american companies mess with the original japanese footage and stuff.  Funimation changed the logo of ""Dragonball GT"" in both the original Japanese and English opening theme credits. They also completely took off the American Rap Opening Credits (which I wasn't much of a fan of) and switched it with some other person singing the original Japanese Opening with English words (no offense to the singer).  For those that like the rap, sorry it's gone.  Also, the screen is in Full Screen, not Widescreen. (Not that that matters to me).  I could tell in certain parts of the show that it WAS remastered, but it wasn't that much of a difference from the original dvd releases Funimation did 3-4 years ago.  Also, in the orginal releases, there was Japanese characters at the bottom of the screen for the original Japanese themes that played, but in this set, they completely took those off!  I can't read Japanese, but taking off the words was still kind of like...""Why?""  I don't mean to sound mean and I know it's just a dvd, but it was really not what I expected when I bought it.  The only good thing that I liked was the fact that they had the English voice actors with the original Japanese music in the background.  But the music seemed a bit quieter than the voices and sounds itself.  Well, that's basically it.  The box cover and back looks cool and all, but yeah.  I think I've said what I wanted to say.  If you don't mind the set containing and cutting the things that I mentioned, then price wise, it's WELL worth it.  It contains the entire first half of the show and it's an easy way to see most of it if you haven't already.  Funimation is great, but I've never really seen a problem like this before.  The season itself is fairly long and still the show is enjoyable...so get it if you haven't....regaurdless of whatever set or individual dvds you purchase.  ;)",1228435200,,2570,4.491379310344827

3537579,5,B001DRF83S,there is going to be a dragon ball GT movie double feature but they only made 1 DBGT movie. how dumb is that but still it's great that they are remastering everything. anyway the season is great the lost episodes are kind of boring but the end of the baby saga is great. the super 17 saga is good but a bit short.,1227139200,,313,3.984126984126984
3537580,4,B001DRF83S,"Im a big Dragon ball fan and even though everyone kept saying how horrible Dragon Ball GT was I just had to check it out. If you're a true DB fan you will enjoy DB GT. Although at times you will definately be dissapointed, especially if you like seeing other characters fight besides goku cause theres not a whole lot of that. I do agree with what everyone says though, skip the first 20 episodes if you can.",1226966400,,408,4.243589743589744
3537581,4,B001DRF83S,"I have to admit, when I first heard that GT was going to be coming out in boxsets, like Dragonball Z, I was quite upset. After weeks of searching, and shelling out nearly $150 to get the whole GT series in 15 dvds, I find that not only is the series coming out in cool boxes, but they're still going to be $50 apiece? O_o I'm sorry but Dragonball Z was nearly 3 times as successful as Dragonball GT on the air, and yet GT seasons are costing more? My advice? If you already own the volume boxsets, this isn't really worth it right now. Wait about a month or so, and the price will inevitably drop to a more reasonable $39.99 or so. (still more expensive than Dragonball Z: Season 6 which is now $29.99). If you don't own any GT dvds, and you are an avid Dragonball fan like myself, I would still recommend waiting a little bit. Just a couple weeks drops the price of a Dragonball Z boxset by $10. So unless you absolutely have to have the lukewarm childishness that is the first season of Dragonball GT, wait a couple weeks after the release before purchasing.",1226361600,,1060,4.278606965174129
3537582,2,B001DRF83S,"I've already seen the entire series and even though I love DBZ this Next Level is really the lowest in the entire Dragon ball Series.
Every character is ether working at a job or just plain boring. The villains are kind of wack. The best scenes are mostly at the end of the series, like when they turns SSJ 4 Gogeta and fight Omega Shenron (By the way,I think the Super 17 saga was way worst than the Garlic JR. saga)

But if you still want to watch it and you're a big fan like me, start from the Second Season because the first is really Lame. Just don't expect it to be half as good as Dragonball or Dragonball z.",1225497600,,616,4.090909090909091
3537583,4,B001DRF83S,"I was never a fan of Dragon Ball because when the show aired on TV it was at 5:30am in the morning. I couldn't watch it on the Cartoon Network because they were way to deep in the story for me to catch up. All i knew about DB is that the artwork and character design is addictive. God Bless Funimation for releasing the new remastered widescreen box sets because i finally see the show that everyone loves so much. I decided to rent the GT series from Netflix to see what it was all about when the Z series ended. I started with the 16 lost episodes when Goku becomes a kid again by accident, anyways it barely kept my attention. But i decided to hang in there. You can see from the very 1st episode that the magic is gone. But overall its still a decent anime. There are far more aime titles out there that are just a mess. I'll update my review if i find out its widescreen etc.",1225065600,,880,4.092485549132948
3537584,1,B001DRF83S,"If you like Dragonball Z and are interested in giving GT a try I'm telling you it's a bad idea. I watched most of Dragonball GT because I kept expecting it to get better. It doesn't. The whole show series is an abomination. The show singlehandedly makes a disappointment out of every character. Vegeta grows a mustache and cuts his hair. Goku becomes a little kid. Gohan settles down and barely fights at all. Bulma becomes a grandma. Trunks becomes a scientist. To put it plainly, Goten is one of the coolest characters. Thats how bad it is.

  If you can't resist however I would recommend season 2 of GT since the first 20 episodes of this show Pan is a main character. (Pan is Gohans daughter.) She whines and complains the whole time and Goku (as a litttle kid)has to keep saving her. If that isn't bad enough they find a little robot name Giru who follows Pan around for the rest of the show. He's really annoying. Basically these 20 episodes consist of mini adventures to find each dragon ball. You know those episodes they used as filler between sagas in Dragonball Z, well this is just like that, except 20 EPISODES! The actual Baby saga doesn't start until episode 21.

This is just my opinion. My friend Mic loves the show. He also admits however that the first 20 episodes are boring and should be skipped completely. I have to give the show a little credit. SS4 is very cool but the plot and writing is terrible. Dragonball GT is not based on a manga like Dragon Ball and Dragonball Z were. The original writer had nothing to do with the show.

So I'll end by saying that I think you should avoid this show. If you  really want to check it out I would skip episodes 1-20 and just watch episodes 21-32 online. Then, if you liked the baby saga, buy season 2.",1224720000,,1769,4.394495412844036

Season 2 has young goku, pam, young adult trunks, and the adorable robot iro seeking for the dragon balls across space to save earth. Season 2 goku pam and the robot fight the evil dragons made from their wishes this is more like Dragon Ball z vs buu cell ect but better and shorter.",1503619200,,465,4.065217391304348
