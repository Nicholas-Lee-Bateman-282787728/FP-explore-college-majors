8337816,3,B001REE2FW,This is educational for kids who have no clue about polio & what could happen to people. It gives pretty good pictures of the iron lung. Needed to deal more with how long Martha lived in that iron lung. She was quite a good role model for sick people who think they have it bad-her attitude was remarkable. I could not understand a lot of what she said-not good sound quality. Got this for an educational dvd.,1478563200,,409,4.324675324675325
