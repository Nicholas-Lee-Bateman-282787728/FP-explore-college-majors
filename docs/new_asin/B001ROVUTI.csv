3777205,1,B001ROVUTI,"I have enjoyed British films for decades and own many of the television series devoted to mystery (A Touch of Frost, seasons 1-12 being the gold standard).  Thus I was unprepared for Murder Most English.  It is simply the most dreadful, amateurish, and god-awful film you will see outside of a drive-in movie theater.  Laughter is the only sensible response to the terrible acting.  The sets, the costumes, the makeup, and the writing are being surpassed routinely by high schools all over America.  Try, for example, to discuss the plot of the first film--without cracking up.  And then have a contest for worst camera angles.  Count the number of cigarettes hauled out, pipes lit, and drinks poured by the actors to help them get through the corny and sometimes ridiculous script.

And you thought the later ""Carry On"" movies were awful.  Murder most English is simply offal.",1243555200,21,877,4.91156462585034
3777206,5,B001ROVUTI,"Anton Rodgers plays Inspector Walter Purbright who in his own indefatigable way goes about solving the homicides in the town of Flaxborough, population approx. 15,000. The murder plots are engaging and well-written, unfolding in an entertaining manner, portraying various themes such as class distinctions, affairs of the heart etc. Rodgers' performance is complemented by the supporting cast, such as the confused Constable Chubb [Moray Watson], perky young Sergeant Love [Christopher Timothy],  and Mr Warlock, the forensics expert [John Tordoff]. There are rich characterizations here and the dialogue is highly entertaining, tinged mostly with a dry humor and satirical wit.

Having been in the annals of classic yet 'lost' shows for so long, I am so glad to see this wonderful series finally see the light of day. Highly recommended!",1243468800,11,838,5.488372093023256
3777207,4,B001ROVUTI,"""Murder Most English,"" a classic British mystery series that dates from 1977, was produced by the British Broadcasting Company Birmingham, rather an unusual genealogy.  The television series, which aired in the United States on Public Broadcasting System stations, is, not too surprisingly, set in the Midlands, Birmingham area.  Thankfully for us, Acorn Media has provided subtitles, as Birmingham accent and usage are surely unfamiliar to us on this side of the pond: not sure how familiar they'd be on the other side of the pond, either, where, I believe, Birmingham's native speakers refer to their patois as ""brum.""The boxed set release consists of three DVD's and four mysteries in seven episodes, approximately 344 minutes.

The series stars Anton Rodgers (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dirty-Rotten-Scoundrels/dp/B00005PJ6O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dirty Rotten Scoundrels</a>;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lillie/dp/B000XUF6AG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lillie</a>) as Detective Inspector Purbright: outfitted in tweed and puffing a pipe, he does his best to stamp out serious crime in the fictional, sleepy country town of Flaxborough.  (This town was apparently modeled after Lincoln, a Midlands town where Colin Watson, the author upon whose series of detective novels this TV series was based, worked as a journalist.)  Purbright is assisted in his crime-solving efforts by Detective Sergeant Love, (Christopher Timothy,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/All-Creatures-Great-and-Small-The-Complete-Collection/dp/B0011V7PSM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">All Creatures Great and Small: The Complete Collection</a>); and, occasionally, by his boss, Chief Constable Chubb (Moray Watson (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Darling-Buds-of-May-Collection/dp/B00005QW4N/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Darling Buds of May Collection</a>).  The mysteries are ingenious and offbeat, with surprising twists and a light comic touch, and are well-acted by a distinguished company of supporting players that would have been more familiar faces in the 1970's.  The current release itself warns us that, due to the age of the underlying programs, there will be occasional flaws in picture and sound.  The series also shows its age in some other ways: I was stunned to see a Detective Inspector puffing away at crime scenes, but then, this D.I., and seemingly other cops, puff away in people's homes and offices, too, without seeking permission.  And none of these actors, who presumably smoked in real life as well, could be described as having white teeth.

The mysteries are:

Hopjoy Was Here, (Parts 1 and 2).  Hopjoy had an eye for the ladies, and hated paying his bills: he was apparently a spy, and has disappeared.

Lonelyheart 4122, (Parts 1 and 2). Local women of means sign up with a matchmaking agency and disappear.  There may be a dangerous predator at work.  Enter the fearless Miss Teatime....

The Flaxborough Crab, (Parts 1 and 2).  The old men of the community are suddenly acting out, and the women of the town aren't safe anywhere, in church, on the street, in their own homes. Does Ms. Teatime, who makes an herbal tonic, have anything to do with it?

Coffin, Scarcely Used (Parts 1 and 2).  The funeral of Councilor Carobleat is attended by his wife, to be sure, and four local notables, newspaper owner, doctor, undertaker and lawyer. Two of the gang of four are soon killed.

More than anything else, this series struck me as belonging to a mystery category I didn't know existed: a men's cozy.  Most of us are familiar with women's cozies of course: think Agatha Christie's Miss Marple, in St. Mary Mead.  They're meant to be not too threatening: a crime must be committed, of course; that upsets the community.  But as the crime is solved, things are put back to rights.  Well, ""Murder Most English"" seems to follow these rules, and to have been made largely by men, for men: women don't have much part in these stories.  However, we can enjoy them, for their humor and lightness of touch.",1243382400,38,4165,5.833333333333333
3777208,5,B001ROVUTI,"DI Purbright (Anton Rodgers of ""Lillie"" also recommended by this reviewer) works his way through crime in the fictional rural village of Flaxborough. His drone monologue way of sorting through the clues and elements of a mystery take place either through interrogations over a cup of tea or a pipe of tobacco. His intellectual approach to crime is never flustered.

His Det. Sgt. assistant, Sid Love (Christopher Timothy), is a bit more animated. His speech is more typically British and fast-paced making the Acorn Media addition of the SDH subtitles advantageous.

The stated seven episodes is a bit of a misnomer in that the first 3 take in two crime stories ""Hopjoy Was Here"" and ""Lonelyheart 4122"". One story turns into the other just as the first crime is solved. Episodes 4 & 5 are two parts of the story ""The Flaxborough Crab"" about neighborhood sex-maniac activity by a man who walks sideways.  The final story, ""Coffin, Scarcely Used"", is another two-part, making up the final episodes 6 & 7. I'll say no more about the final story to refrain from spoiling your viewing.  Each episode is 50 minutes. The stories to have a connection one with the other, through the town characters, more than just the two lead coppers.

The first story seemed a bit slow. After one hour I was considering this set less than a 5-star value. But then the stories picked up in interest and plot lifting the set to where I was glad to have purchased.

The DVD's themselves warn in the beginning that there is a less than 21st century level with the visual and audio aspects of the TV series. This is due to the quality of the original, dated from 1977. Because of age, although the resolution is improved, not all can be elevated to perfection. Very fair of Acorn Media to acknowledge that right on the box & discs.
These British mysteries are in 4:3 full screen, and full color.
Based on detective novels by Colin Watson.
Extra features limited to 4 actor filmographies and a bit on the writer.

Regardless, this is a fun 5-star revisiting of retro BBC TV. More outdoor rural English scenery was expected which proved a bit disappointing in the beginning. Much of the story takes place in obvious theatrical sets. But, hang on and keep watching, because like the stories, even the filmed scenery improves in quality and quantity through the final 5 episodes.

I'm glad I watched; I think you will be too.
And there is a fun final-scene finale for the entire Flaxborough Chronicle series that you WILL enjoy.",1241136000,71,2497,4.7110091743119265

The entire series is gentle, low-key, and slyly witty .. think of it as a ""Miss Marple"" that is quietly making a little fun at itself while providing a pleasant bit of ""guess who did it"" entertainment. Anton Rodgers steals the show as the unflappable Inspector Purbright, and it's also fun to see Christopher Timothy in an early role (before James Herriot). So, not a ""must see"", but great fun to watch with a ""nice cup of tea"" on a wet afternoon. But watch carefully, some of the humor is left for you to find!",1451347200,2,602,4.4324324324324325

3777246,4,B001ROVUTI,"I have to let myself gradually sink into viewing a mystery in ""Murder Most English"". Airing in 1977, this series is veddy English. The humor is so dry as to be desertified and it takes me a bit to get into it. But if I don't expect a Flaxborough Chronicle to sound like a modern series, I start to chuckle. There is a ton of humor in these mysteries, wry and low-key.

The last mystery in this series is based on the only Colin Watson mystery I've read,

The book, like this series, is chock full of low-key humor. Watson started off writing mysteries, but the Flaxborough Chronicles eventually morphed into comedy of manners, and you can see why. Quirky personalities, in the book and TV series, are predominant.

In this set, you get 3 DVD discs with over 5 and 3/4 hours of viewing time. The show is presented in 4:3 TV ratio. English subtitles are available throughout. The Bonus Extras on Disc 3 are minimal.

Disc 1: 2 episodes
....""Hopjoy Was Here"" Detective Inspector Purbright and Detective Inspector Love are searching the rooms in an abandoned house. As Purbright tells Mr. Warlock, they're there because the police received an anonymous letter starting with ""Why don't you take a look into 4 Beatrice Avenue?"" Purbright muses, ""You'll notice how damnably rhetorical these anonymous letter writers always are.""
It's a joke. really.
And here's Purbright to his boss: ""Have you read anything about cannibalism, Sir?""
Chubb, ""Not avidly, Mr. Purbright.""
This episode is enlivened by two MI6 agents, who are ridiculously braggarts about their secrecy: ""I don't have to tell you about the Thimble Bay establishment. Couldn't, anyway, not without Security [Level] Three. And you wouldn't be much the wiser if I did.""
Trivia: This episode is based on the novel of the same name, the 3rd in the Flaxborough series, published in 1962.
....""Lonely Hearts 4122"" We are introduced to one of Watson's best characters, Miss Teatime. Just down from London, the enigmatic Teatime responds to an ad in the paper for the Handclasp House Matrimonial Agency. She doesn't strike you as a woman in need of a husband.
Trivia: Based on the novel of the same name, 4th in the series, published 1967.

Disc 2: 1 episode
....""The Flaxborough Crab"" A dowdy woman is arranging flowers in the church when an old man giggles from the side, ""I'm a bee! Buzzzzzzzing!"" He sidles over to the door, closes it and goes after her, buzzing something about fertilizing her! The totally respectable woman escapes and later tells Detective Purbright that her pursuer, whom she couldn't identify, ran sideways, ""just like a crab!'
Purbright and Love are on the job, because that's only the first they hear of randy crab-men. One of them is named Walter Grope!
Trivia: Based on the 6th novel of the same name (1969), also issued in the U.S. under the title ""Just What the Doctor Ordered"".

Disc 3: 1 episode and Bonus Extras
....""Coffin, Scarcely Used"" Mrs. Corobleat is not amused when her late husband's will is read, and Mr. Carobleat left almost everything to his neighbor. Who then turns up equally dead. Their lawyer has a very odd conversation with Detective Purbright, though not in the form that so tickled me in the book. This is a convoluted tale, and several someones are not telling the truth.
Trivia: Based on the 1st Flaxborough Chronicle, published in 1958.
....Cast Filmographies. Written selected appearances by four actors: Moray Watson (plays Chubb), John Comer (plays Sargent Malloy), Christopher Timothy (plays Love) and Anton Rodgers (plays Purbright).
....Colin Watson Biography. Short written biography for Watson (1920-1983). He had worked as a journalist in Lincolnshire, and ""they"" say Flaxborough is based on the real town of Boston, Lincolnshire.

I enjoyed this series, but it won't be for everybody.

3777247,5,B001ROVUTI,"If you love the books you will love this BBC series.  The episodes keep close to the plot and satiric tone of the novels-- and for extra points, there are actors from All Creatures Great and Small and Dr Who.  The Flaxborough Crab episode is especially wonderful!",1408320000,5,263,4.574468085106383
3777248,4,B001ROVUTI,"Even if you watch a lot of British TV mystery, chances are good that you haven't seen something like this.  This brief series (4 stories) was made in 1977.  It's very tweedy and talky compared to something like New Tricks or Vexed.  Also the picture quality isn't the greatest (but I've seen far worse).

I often find that it takes me awhile to get into a new series, to get comfortable with the characters and their accents.  In fact the first episode was pretty rocky.  The spouse made the comment that it seemed almost like a Monty Python sketch.  (If you squint, Anton Rodgers bears a passing resemblance to John Cleese.)  In fact, the underlying humor is so sly and subtle that it takes a while to figure out that they aren't completely playing it straight.  Once we relaxed and went with the flow, this was a very pleasant way to spend a few hours.

The characters are delightfully named.  The murderous action is not particularly gruesome.  There is really nothing to get emotionally involved about, with any of the characters.  It's just good, old-school fun.

I have to mention the character of Sid, played by Christopher Timothy.  I was completely unnerved to see a younger and much blonder James Herriott assisting Inspector Purbright with his investigations.  In fact this series was filmed only a year before All Creatures Great and Small began.  I could never get used to Christopher Timothy as a blonde, and a pretty goofy one at that.  I found it distracting (but definitely not the fault of the production).

Based on running time and quality of the video, I would have to say it's not the greatest value for your money, particularly when you compare prices to other series.  (I got it on deep discount at a bookstore chain.)  However, it's a little time capsule of what British viewers saw on their telly in the late 1970s, and for that reason it's worth seeing.",1381708800,,1880,4.670731707317073

3777260,4,B001ROVUTI,"This series was intended as a serious detective story. If you expect an ordinary detective program, you will be disappointed. The characters are eccentric in the extreme and the plots are contorted and obtuse. Some of them defy the laws of physics.

You will probably enjoy this if you like Monty Python and the Carry On movies. If you are disturbed by non-realistic aspects of a program, you will not enjoy it.",1353715200,4,411,4.708333333333333
3777261,5,B001ROVUTI,"These poor DVD's have taken quite a few knocks. They aren't beautifully filmed like the Poirot series, but I think that the writing is pretty good. British humor is different. If you don't care for it, or don't understand it there's no need to knock the story. It simply isn't your thing. I accept that these were done in a ""low budget"" style probably on a sound stage, and like them anyway. The series opening is rather amusing in its almost cartoon-ish style with goofy, off-key. slightly sinister theme music. I think my favorite episode is The Flaxborough Crab. Ms. Lucilla Teatime has some classic, hilarious lines here!",1337212800,9,625,4.796296296296297
3777262,4,B001ROVUTI,"But then, I enjoyed the satirical crime novels by Colin Watson on which these episodes are based. And I realize it's a DVD made from a cheaply produced 1970's Brit TV show, so I didn't expect high-def wonders.

The setting for these stories is Flaxborough, a British town rife with corruption and hypocrisy. The intelligent Inspector Purbright is usually a match for the villainy in his own understated way.

Watching these DVDs was a fun trip back in time to the 1970's. The late Anton Rodgers gave us a solid Purbright, and I enjoyed the young Christopher Timothy as innocent Sgt. Love. Brenda Bruce was well cast as Lucy Teatime. I'm usually oblivious to these things, but I recognized a young actress playing a sulky housekeeper-with-benefits in ""Coffin Scarcely Used."" I learned from the credits it was Lesley Dunlop - who several years later starred opposite Rodgers as his wife in the Brit TV series May to December.

3777264,1,B001ROVUTI,This set was purchased by my husband and we both tried to sit and watch it but couldn't finish watching. The acting is quite terrible and the story line is very slow moving.

3777269,3,B001ROVUTI,"This show is off the beaten path as far as British Mystery Shows go. Thankfully they perserved this series and put it out on dvd finally.  It's a oddball show that seems to exist in it's own world. Like many shows of the era it's shot mainly in the studio so you get a feeling of a stage play like atmosphere and that's fine. This show is very character and dialog driven.  The pacing is slow and builds up gradually to each shows conclusion. It even has a pertually strangely cheerful sidekick detective that finds humour in everything.  I have met people like this before so that's not bad acting it's actually spot on! The lead detective is a old time detective that still existed in small town British towns back in the late seventies. This type of show is for those who enjoy offbeat shows that are not slick or quick in story. The stories reflect  the stories they come from and mystery fans may either enjoy or dislike this type of eccentric show.  The show reflects the place it takes place in too. With characters from the small towns of the period.  The picture has a few defects but that's in only a few scenes which is good news for fans of older british tv.  Obviously this is the opposite of the modern detective show even in 1977! but that's ok if you are in the mood for this type of slow unfolding story. That is not violent even by 1970's standards , still it's entertaining and bizaare in a slow old fashiioned way.  I am glad that I got to see this unusual show.",1258502400,8,1482,4.324909747292419

First of all the quality of the video itself is terrible and looks like it was even shot in the 50's instead of the 70's.  The plots themselves are so slow you can't believe it and there is virtually nothing but dry monologues from the characters.  All the scenes also seem to take place entirely, with few exceptions, all inside one set and the acting itself is terrible.  I cannot believe some of the reviews for this series that say they actually enjoyed these shows.  I see that all the bad reviews of this show only have a few people who say they were helpful.  All I can say is I sincerely hope that anybody that actually spends their money on this video based upon one of these reviews will see the light and come back and rate those panning it higher because I can guarantee that you will be disappointed.  I keep trying to find SOMETHING I liked about this video but for the life of me I can't come up with anything.  In fact, I have never felt moved enough to write a review of any video but this series is so bad I felt it my duty to warn anyone that might think about spending their hard earned money on it.",1253318400,28,1312,4.240963855421687

3777295,1,B001ROVUTI,"There are no words to describe this DVD!! The acting is awful, the plot non existent just talk all through it.  We don't know what happened in the ending of the first part and the second part was entirely about another plot.  This DVD should never have been released or at least had a warning label on it for ""boring"".  Can't believe it was so expensive for such trash. Even had some intimate groping.  Believe those other reviews that called it ""god awful""",1248652800,12,457,4.469879518072289
3777296,4,B001ROVUTI,"I was delighted to find this made available again, having watched it on BBC when it first aired. It's lovely to find that people in the US  have also warmed to its charms. As some reviewers have already suggested, this is NOT low-concentration span tv, the pace is leisurely (slow) and it has neither the visceral thrills of a CSI nor the chocolate box Englishness of a Miss Marple plus its 1977 shoestring budget shows. That said the charm, as with the Colin Watson novels the tales are based on, is in the dry, sly subversive wit and the steady unravelling of social pretension. However I was amused by all the talk of subtitles.  No offence intended but is the accent of Lincolnshire (not Birmingham - that's where the tv studios were located) really that impenetrable to Americans when English audiences have had to deal with New York gangsters, Detroit rappers, Southern belles and Texas Cowboys without ever resorting to subtitles? Maybe some of the phrases are unfamiliar but listening and applying some context is the best way to learn a language - even if it is English.",1247443200,27,1079,4.73404255319149
3777297,2,B001ROVUTI,These films are not really up to expectations for British TV.  Even given their early age for TV they do not have the quality I have come to expect of British mystery productions.  A slim night of entertainment.,1246665600,9,211,4.526315789473684
3777298,4,B001ROVUTI,"Neither Souchet's Hercule Poirot nor Rutherford's Miss Marple, Murder Most English is most definitely not one of the hard edged contemporary British mysteries with hard-nosed exteriors and complex interiors. It is a venture in folksy village crime solving by ordinary police who get the job done with a touch of humor. Clearly, a set-bound series with no goal of realism to drive it deep and dirty, it still creates its own ambiance which some of us find soothing and entertaining even though murder may be the initiating factor for the plot. It is unlikely to please those for whom the cutting edge-dramatic police procedural derived series is intended. The lead characters are well-cast, the speech for Americans not overly incomprehensible but requiring patient bewilderment as do many British shows, the plots interesting but not intense.
Best to give it a try if you can before buying the series.",1246060800,12,901,5.094594594594595

8338418,2,B001ROVUTI,"Britain is home to many outstanding murder mystery drama series; so much so youd be hard pressed not to remember at least ten or more right off the bat: Inspector Morse, Inspector Lewis, George Gently, DCI Banks, Prime Suspect, Foyles War, Midsomer Murders, you get the idea. Unfortunately, Murder Most English is so tedious and dull, not even the diverse talents of Anton Rodgers, who so effortlessly blends the comedic and the dramatic successfully, cannot save this turkey. Most British detective dramas move linearly from clue to clue until the protagonist solves the crimenot here. The plot crawls with so much unnecessary minutiae with secondary players eating up screen time for no apparent purpose. The plot, like DI Purbright (Rodgers) meanders from room to room, much like the audiences attention with this farce to more pressing and entertaining issues, like mowing the lawn, walking the dog or doing the laundry. Dont waste your time with this DVD set, you're better off watching your well worn and favorite set of Patrick McGoohan in the 60s Classic, Secret Agent for the 27th time....",1520208000,,1098,5.071823204419889
