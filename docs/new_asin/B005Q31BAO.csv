4857801,5,B005Q31BAO,"Clifton Webb at his best.  No one quite like him, no actor can emulate his persona.  The support cast of elderly inmates in a care home are wonderful.  A lovely, family, gentle comedy.  You just can't help but love Mr Belvedere in spite of his supreme arrogance and his brusque manner.  Beneath lies a heart of gold and a really resourceful genius.",1356825600,5,348,4.548387096774194
4857802,5,B005Q31BAO,"""Mr. Belvedere Rings the Bell"" is one of my favorite movie comedies, great wit and acting by Clifton Webb and the cast.",1354838400,2,119,4.454545454545454
4857803,5,B005Q31BAO,"Glad MR. BELVEDERE RINGS THE BELL is on DVD.  But why not the original in the series SITTING PRETTY?  This one, RINGS THE BELL and GOES TO COLLEGE should be released in a package of some sorts.  Are the people at Fox listening?  Also, how about more Clifton Webb films such as WOMANS' WORLD (a great 50's movie)as well as DREAMBOAT; ELOPEMENT; REMARKABLE MR. PENNYPACKER; HOLIDAY FOR LOVERS and FOR HEAVENS SAKE.",1340582400,17,412,4.680555555555555

4857810,5,B005Q31BAO,"Thrilled to pieces finding these films; smart, crisp scripts and watching Clifton Webb is an absolute delight. One gets the feeling that beneath Mr Belvedere's slightly gruff and pompous exterior there is a kind gentle soul. He's lovely.",1424131200,,237,5.2631578947368425

4857813,5,B005Q31BAO,"By popular demand, 20th Century Fox treated audiences to one more Mr. Belvedere vehicle and the adroit genius of Clifton Webb.
Mr. Belvedere Rings the Bell (1951) reprises the irrepressible character of Lynn Belvedere, sadly, for the third and last time. (In the 1953 picture Mister Scoutmaster, the person of Lynn Belvedere is slightly altered to Robert Jordan, also played by Mr. Webb.)
The cast for this dear and perfectly told tale hails originally from the legitimate stage, as had the original venue for this story (The Silver Whistle, by Robert E. MacEnroe).
Doro Merande reprises her Broadway stage character Mrs. Hammer, as she will again on TVs Playhouse 90. At the age of 59, as was common in her career, Miss Merande plays a far older woman. Her droll and caustic delivery is beyond price.
Joanne Dru is as always lovely and well-fit to the plot. Hugh Marlowe is solid as the stuffy Reverend Charles Watson. And for absurd juxtaposition, utter magic is produced by the pairing of Clifton Webb with Zero Mostel.
As for Lynn Belvedere, he is supercilious, snobbish, petulant, insufferable, priggish, snappish, intolerant, pompous, loquacious, and, paradoxically, possessed of a saintly heart, which he attempts with effort to hide under his bespoke-tailored waistcoat. When hes not eliciting laughter from his audience, he is evoking tears.
Where Mr. Belvedere sees injustice, he attacks it by first creating disorder, dislocation, and chaos. He breaks hearts only to see that they are mended aright. He insults the wrong doer and the injured party alike; leads sinners to redemption and underdogs to recompense.
Must-see compliments to this offering are Sitting Pretty (1948) and Mr. Belvedere Goes to College (1949).
Mister Scoutmaster (1953), cited above, falls a little short of the three Mr. Belvedere films, but is worth the purchase and ones time.",1418774400,4,1864,5.175496688741722
4857814,5,B005Q31BAO,Excellent Show Overall!!!,1415923200,,25,7.666666666666667

4857818,3,B005Q31BAO,Was a little slow moving but it has a sweet sentiment. We shouldn't forget those whom have taken care of us when they get older and the Elderly need to remember to find happiness in their lives.,1406505600,,194,4.27027027027027
4857819,4,B005Q31BAO,I am not good at writing these reviews.  I liked all the movies I got thru amazon and am pleased with them all... I will not write a review for each one....  thank you for the opertunity to get some of my old favorites.,1403568000,,219,3.9545454545454546

4857821,3,B005Q31BAO,"Story had a point to it and still holds up to this day, however a little on the depressing side for me the movie set was sad looking and kept you that way, Clifton Webb was as usual at his peak of his career and gave out the only positive side in the movie, for the Belvedere fans I feel sure this will be enjoyed.",1389484800,,314,3.8461538461538463

4857823,4,B005Q31BAO,Not Clifton Webb's best film.  Still enjoyable.  Always loved his sharp tongue and lightening fast retort yet in the end always succumbing to those he really loves.,1386115200,,164,5.037037037037037

4857826,3,B005Q31BAO,"I guess I was comparing it to the Sitting Pretty movie which I really enjoyed, and it just was not that interesting.  As a matter of fact I just quit watching it about half way through.  So if it gets really going after that I cannot say.",1379721600,,238,4.042553191489362
4857827,1,B005Q31BAO,"By far the weakest of the three Mr Belevedere movies -- bad enough that it kind of ruined the other two for me.  Stick with Sticking Pretty and Mr. Belevedere Goes to College.  If you need more Clifton Webb, see his version of Cheaper by the Dozen.",1369008000,,248,4.25531914893617

4857829,5,B005Q31BAO,"Since my original review has disappeared mysteriously, this title is indeed worth the money spent to buy it, as I did so last year. Thank you Fox Cinema Archives :) :) :) & Amazon.com !!!
As revealed by the Classic Flics web site, the first Mr. Belvedere film will be released on April 8th, 2013, ""Sitting Pretty"" and ""The Remarkable Mr. Pennypacker"" (both starring Clifton Webb)as part of the next wave (25 films altogether)from the 20th Century-Fox Cinema Archives ""MOD"" series. Sitting Pretty (1948, B&W, also stars Maureen O'Hara)was a broadway hit as well. Mr. Pennypacker (1959, Color, also stars Dorthy McGuire). Both films are worth spending your hard earned dollars on and are films that can be viewed by ""all"" family members. Highly recommended.
I can't wait to pre-order from Amazon.com ASAP (better sooner than later) !!!
Have fun :) :) :)
