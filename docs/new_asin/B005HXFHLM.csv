8473944,2,B005HXFHLM,"In all fairness, the movies are just ok for low budget films. Blu-ray does not help the picture quality of these films at all. They both look pretty bad. I wouldn't recommend paying more than $5 for this set.",1369180800,,208,4.358974358974359
8473945,1,B005HXFHLM,"Camp Blood was the first of several films made for the home market in the 90's they were released in a flickering electronic 3D decoder and glasses some of which were wired and in old school red and blue. Now they have been converted to Blu Ray and they look pretty good considering bu the movie is pretty bad and the story is very obvious and done to death. A guy in a five dollar clown mask terrorizes campers and two of the gals get naked briefly. That's pretty much it. No production values at all. They just went to woodsy part of California where there aren't too many rangers  so they didn't have to pay permits and shot the thing in about 3 days time. The 2nd feature Camp Blood Two is the better feature. It at least has some decent gallows humor,lots more blood and lots more boobs. I got this and all of the other Sterling entertainment movies used for about $20.00 that's about 10 features so I'm not complaining but don't expect Avatar or even Jaws 3D.",1357430400,,965,4.331491712707182

My ratings are based mainly on the QUALITY OF THE 3D, not the video content.

CAMP BLOOD 1 (1999)
There are about 42 out of screen effects that extend about 10% of the way, from the screen to the viewer and 19 at 25%. Many of the OOS effects are just branches etc. Of the 19 at 25% 6 are nice OOS effects containing a knife or a machete. My favorite, but not the farthest out is at 55:40, a machete stuck in a head.

There are tons of flaws in the 3D. Most of the scenes in the film have excess parallax and many times there is a disparity in colors between right and left eye. The disparity is seen as surfaces looking `weird'. For example (the hood of a black truck) the right eye will see a shiny whitish surface while the left sees a no gloss black surface. The human brain just doesn't know what to do about receiving significantly different images in each eye.

CAMP BLOOD 2 (2000)
There are about 19 out of screen effects that extend about 10% of the way, from the screen to the viewer and 7 at 25%.

The good news is they filmed with less parallax than the first movie. The bad news is you MUST pause the film and use your TV's picture correction function in the 3D menu at least 7 times because the film swaps the right/left eye during playback.

If you want to see these 2 movies in 3D, buy a 2D version and use your TV to convert them!!!

*** Many, Many flaws in the 3D ***

MY 3D RATING = POOR (poor, fair, good, very good, excellent)

Note: As far as the percentages go, everyone's eyes are different. What I see at 25% you may see at 15% or 35%. To fully realize how far something is out of the screen for you, pause on an effect and direct a partner with an extended finger to the tip of what you are seeing. You may be surprised.

8473947,3,B005HXFHLM,"This is the first of the grindhouse series (1-4) i got to watch. bought all of them, @ $15. too cheap not to.
If you love 80s?-90s? b-horror films you will like these.
campy,predictable,""rules"" type story...fun stuff! no commercial interuptions or editing for content. this means some gratuitous nudity, f***-bombs (real R rated) and bloody effects.

LOTS of little cinematic flaws and mistakes to find!

the bad is that it is all standard def. video in letterbox format which restricts the 3D a lot along with a lot of ghosting and no digital surround.

if you are a genre fan these may be future cult classics. looking for a blockbuster-eye-popping-mega-thriller? save your dough.",1319673600,4,682,5.017699115044247
8473948,3,B005HXFHLM,"OK I saw the original camp blood movie years ago. The film says it was made in 1999. It is a throwback to friday the 13th. In fact alot is there that fans of the genre would like. crazy ""your all doomed"" guy. in the woods and a camp where a murder happened. campers getting stalked by a killer in a mask(clown mask). there is a bit of a who is the killer but you will figure it out pretty easily?

This is low budget, really low budget film. It had a gimmick. the gimmick was this film was shot in 3d. remember this was 1999 3d. before avatar, before 3dtv. the blu-ray 3d is an ugly affair compared to current 3d. blurry backgrounds and no detail and ghosting etc... etc.. and while the shots are come out at you gimmick. they don't work as well because of the quality. To really enjoy it I suggest sitting closer then you usually do to the tv. not to expect great 3d but an interesting look inside of low budget horror stuff that is out there.

I had the original dvd with the red/blue glasses. I just bought a 3d tv and when I saw this I had to buy it. For me it's a hoot. It's a fun flick you don't take serious. I loved 3d even before 3dtv and there were very few choices of 3d back then. This was one option that was out there back then and it's nice to see it here resurrected. For me it's a 3 star but for most they would probably hold their nose on this poor quality video,but for the price you get 2 films that are fun and in 3d.",1317945600,11,1438,3.972318339100346
