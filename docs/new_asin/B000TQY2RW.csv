8210374,5,B000TQY2RW,"At the risk of sounding trite, this film has similarities to Seinfeld in that it is film about nothing other than the relationship between some ordinary, decent, slightly flawed people. It has a car crash but this is more of a dramatic device, and on rewatching there are other more dramatic plot lines that could have been explored and which other films might have. This film gently lets the dramatic stories fall away and instead draws us into the dreams and stories that each relationship creates.

The film contrasts the things that make a love with the things that mark love's cold absence; and at times it explores the occasionally brutal journey between the two.

The film is uncomplicated and does not use heavy handed metaphors or symbols. Filled with meaning yet the meaning is left for the viewer to extrapolate. If you have ever been fascinated by wild flowers, stylish cars, the smell of grass, the buzz of a fly, wind and rain, cigarettes, love, scarves, the sea, friends, dappled or reflected light this film will have some meaning for you. Much is left unsaid and the film does not judge. The director, Claude Sautet, is not forcing an interpretation, instead, through meticulous and efficient portrayal of everyday detail he invites the viewer to interpret for themselves.

The film finishes with a sophisticated act of decency showing true respect for lovers - rarely seen and typically French perhaps.",1315872000,5,1420,4.933054393305439
