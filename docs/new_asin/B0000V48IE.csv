1948435,5,B0000V48IE,"I share the same feelings as Gary on this one.  This is a really great program- not only for the Academy Awards info but for film history and great footage.  There's plenty of red carpet footage and interviews with the stars who won and who came close.
- This is the silver dagger of my DVD collection.  I literally hugged this boxset after watching it.  I hugged it.  It is mine.  I am Fortunato Plethora, and I hug stuff I really, really like.  And I really, really like this DVD collection.",1075334400,3,493,4.351648351648351
1948436,5,B0000V48IE,"This is a great compilation of the last 31 years of Academy Awards.  (They say that it is for the last 30 years.  Wrong.  Years 1972 through and including 2002 is 31, and not 30 years.)  Of note, when they are referring to the winners of the 2002 Academy Awards, they are talking about movies released in 2002, and the Academy Awards show from spring of 2003.  In other words, this compilation was completely up to date as of January, 2004, given that the Academy Awards show for movies relased in 2003 didn't occur until February 29, 2004.
This set is a great trip down memory lane.  At about six hours for the entire 3 disc set, each year has only 12 or so minutes devoted to the catagories of Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor and Actress in Leading Roles, and Best Actor and Actress in Supporting Roles, listing all of contenders and then the winners.  Occasionally, they would even mention who won that year for the best screenplay, or original or adapted.
I started watching the awards for 1972 movies, and didn't stop until 6 hours later at around 3:30 a.m.  One interesting facet of this collection is that I could reflect on who I likely saw these movies with, given what realtionships I was in at the time.
In watching this collection, I was able to remember some of the great movies that I've seen, and to be exposed to new movies to watch.
But I want more!  First, I thought that I'd like for them to go back to include the 50's and 60's.  Then I realized that I'd want to see all of those great movies just before World War II.  Then I realized that they might as well go back to the first Academy Awards in the late 20's.
This collection is great fun.  Every movie lover should have it in his or her library.  I recommend it highly.",1074902400,8,1752,4.3538461538461535
1948437,4,B0000V48IE,This is a nice reminder of some wonderful movies over a span of 30 years. I watch this to get ideas for movies I want to watch or purchase in their complete versions.,1358985600,,166,4.0606060606060606
1948438,5,B0000V48IE,"Excellent items for yourself or a gift.  Gave it to a friend who is still raving about the package and quality of the films/discs.
Arrived quickly and all was well.",1352419200,,164,4.466666666666667
1948439,5,B0000V48IE,I purchased this as a gift for my brother as he is really into all the academy awards since they started (even though he's not THAT old).  He was really surprised and very happy with all the years of award winners.  It was the perfect gift for him.,1345852800,,248,4.145833333333333
1948440,5,B0000V48IE,"This documentary was exactly what I was searching for when I ordered it.  It does a great job of covering the highlights of each academy awards year for the past 30 years.  It was easy to watch all of it or to pick out certain years.  I have recorded some of the recent academy awards shows but without the editing, they are extremely tedious to watch.  This set is perfect for showing the important races, wins and losses, and some of the drama involved without putting you to sleep.  I look forward to watching the Academy Awards each year and hope a DVD covering 2003 through 2012 is in the works.",1314921600,3,600,4.36936936936937
1948441,1,B0000V48IE,"If you buy this product, be sure to inspect it immediately. My set included two Disc 1s and no Disc 2, a discrepancy I didn't notice until the return window had closed. But after watching the beginning of one of those Disc 1s, I realized I wasn't going to miss Disc 2 or ever get to Disc 3. Lackluster narration, ten aimlessly arranged minutes per year, and prints so bad they make 8mm bootlegs look good. It's hard to make watching clips from old Oscar winners unpleasant, but this set is up to the task.",1268092800,,505,4.326315789473684
1948442,3,B0000V48IE,"For film buffs, it is a decent overview that spots the humorous acceptance speeches as well as a panorama of what American liked to watch since 1979.  Wish it had more perspective from the directors and critics, though.",1260921600,,219,4.7631578947368425
1948443,5,B0000V48IE,"If you really enjoy movies and even collect them, you will appreciate this set of 30 years of history on movies,. However, this set doesn't show the Academy Awards Ceremonies, but scenes of the winner films and performances by the actors, there isn't a lot of moments when they actually get the award,..but,  very entertaining, keeps you watching for several hours.",1197244800,,365,4.983606557377049
1948444,2,B0000V48IE,"I too was very dissapointed, i went into blockbuster video to see if i could find extra dvds for the dvd video game scene it, and ended up buying an academy award collection, to relive some of the reactions to stars winning their oscars and some acceptance speeces, and all i got was a recap of who won each year, i already have the oscar books, it almost seemed like they were not allowed to show the acceptance speeces, they talked about michael moore's controversial acceptance speech, but never showed a clip, the only clip they showed was very little about the man who ran across the oscar stage naked one year, adn showed very little of that was well, not that i really wanted to see it, very dissapointing, i wanted to see speeches, and stars sitting in their seats, and i got very little.  They really need to come out with something better for academy award fans, they have a video cassette with stuff from the ceremony up till 1991, but nothing after that.",1130630400,29,966,4.488636363636363
1948445,1,B0000V48IE,"I feel nothing but disappointed...I was expecting to watch some essences of Academy Award show for last 30 years, but I got nothing but the shortfilm of nominated movies...

Totally different to what I expect..

If you have same expectation as me, which is just to watch the ""orginal"" award show and their acceptance speeches, DON'T BUY IT",1112054400,43,339,4.827586206896552
8003405,1,B0000V48IE,"The listings of each movie in the description is incredibly misleading.  The movies themselves are NOT included, just a poor quality program about the Academy Awards movies.  This is a deceptive rip off",1524700800,,202,5.090909090909091
8003406,1,B0000V48IE,Should have read the reviews before buying. I thought I was getting all the movies - turns out it's just people talking about the movies!,1474416000,2,137,4.52
8003407,1,B0000V48IE,"i was expecting acceptance speaches, celebrities sitting in there seats a real accedemy awards cerimony it wasnt. It was just a bunch of movie clips and a guy just talking about the movies. Pretty dull, right. It didn't even high light the winning oscar winners, yeah it meantioned the winner but it more discussed the other nominees. Another flaw with this set was the 1975 and 74' oscars were flip flopped. Not a good buy.",1471046400,2,424,4.666666666666667
8003408,1,B0000V48IE,I was mistaken about the contents. There are no movies. It is just the footage and interviews relating to the awards presentation.,1441670400,2,130,4.954545454545454

8003411,1,B0000V48IE,Not what you expect. No speeches or the good stuff such as performances not available elsewhere. Kind of a fake bio with standard footage and info you could get on a few minutes online. Worthless without a doubt.,1388793600,2,212,4.605263157894737
