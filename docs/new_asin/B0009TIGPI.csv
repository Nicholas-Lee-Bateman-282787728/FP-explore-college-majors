8066434,5,B0009TIGPI,"This is a great movie. Based on a series of books by Akunin about Erast Fandorin, this is by far the best screen adaptation based on one of these great books (the screenplay was written by Akunin himself). There are two previous screen adaptations of other books: Azazel (book 1) and Turkish Gambit (book 2). The cast is brilliant: Menshikov, Mikhalkov, Mashkov. Director has captured a sense of danger and suspense, and created a believable atmospere of Russia at the beginning of the 20th century. Very enjoyable experience.",1119225600,5,526,4.988636363636363
