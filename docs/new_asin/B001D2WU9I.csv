3523767,2,B001D2WU9I,"The Dark Knight?  Wall-E?  None of the film trailers from such great films this past year have had a trailer as strong as the one The Strangers had.  It was scary.  The creepy masks, the eerie setting and the looping record song combined to deliver some genuine chills and for myself, gave me hope that finally a horror movie had come around that was Halloween 1978-esque and relied on suspense more than gore.

Upon seeing the film, that's partly true; The Strangers does deliver some creepy moments that have not been seen much in mainstream horror since the 1970s and gore is mostly absent.  Regardless, the film falls victim to the stupidity of its characters and the lack of a body count.  I must preface the meat of this review with a SPOILER!!!! tag.

SPOILERS

The Strangers, like Halloween 1978, doesn't have a high enough body count for a horror movie.  True, many would say it's the methodical plans of the Strangers and of Michael Myers that makes them terrifying, that the killers seem to enjoy toying with their victims more than actually killing them.  But there's only so many times one can show shots of people in masks staring at others before it stops getting creepy and starts getting boring.

What's worse, the victims actually had plenty of tries to foil the Strangers' murderous attempts and failed embarrassingly.  The most obvious example being when they finally did something right and entered a room with a shotgun with only one way in or out.  Meaning, if any of the strangers were stupid enough to enter, they would have been blown away.  Instead, after another embarrassingly stupid incident from Mike, a friend of Speedman's character, Speedman's character panics and runs outside with the shotgun, leaving his girlfriend unarmed in a house full of maniacs.  How is an audience member supposed to sympathize with these characters when they make decisions like these?

END OF SPOILERS

The Strangers should have been good.  No, it should have been really good.  But after a promising start with genuine scares (including that looping song from the trailer!) the film tapers off before ending on a cliched wimper.  And by all indications, the unrated cut will only make the ending a little longer; maybe it will clarify a couple of plot holes, but that's it.  Save the money and savor the film's promising trailer instead.  The movie itself is for me one of the biggest disappointments of 2008.",1219449600,5,2423,4.841849148418492
3523768,5,B001D2WU9I,"When I first saw the preview for this movie on television I liked it from the beginning. When it came out in the movies,from the beginning I was into it. It was everything that I thought it would be & more. What I personally liked about it was that there were surprises when you didn't expect anything to happen. All in all if you like suspense that keeps you @ the edge of your seat,this movie is for you.",1219363200,3,406,4.151898734177215
3523769,4,B001D2WU9I,I feel THE STRANGERS is a unique film. A classic thriller destined to be a favorite on BlueRay and DVD. This movie will have you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end. I have been waiting for this film to come out on BlueRay and will definitely be one of the first to own it.,1218931200,4,284,3.913793103448276
3523770,5,B001D2WU9I,"Now, pound for pound as far as actual scares (not blood, gore or excessive violence) but suspense, chills, creeps and overall scares, this movie is without a doubt the scariest movie I have ever seen. Hats off to Bertino.",1218931200,3,221,4.6923076923076925
3523771,3,B001D2WU9I,"I really wanted to enjoy this film much more than I did. But it was indeed (as another reviewer accurately penned) irritatingly plodding (think less pyschological terror and more a funeral dirge set on continuous loop). I'd never seen the French version before my theater viewing of this (yes, Strangers IS a remake for folks out there claiming how original the concept was), but heard and read great things - the trailer was pretty spooky too. Perhaps something got lost in the translation-vouz...

The common criticism of horror movies is the stupidity of its characters and this one has it in spades. By the time dawn actually breaks (which is apparently noon in this part of the country), my moviemate and I were dying - no pun intended - to see Speedman and Tyler FINALLY get finished off. I'm not sure who was being tortured more, them or us.

Name a horror cliche and Strangers probably had it...

Character heads out into darkness of night with confirmed crazed killer(s) on the prowl? Check. Complete weirdo shows up on doorstep at very unusual hour, yet inhabitants fail to secure the premises? Check (really better to make sure they've gotten inside a time or two before getting around to that). Friend and savior apparent shows up to site of an all-too-obvious tussle, yet sneaks around in silence - stalker style - rather than call out to his buddy from a safe distance and as a result becomes a victim of best friendly fire? Check. I could go on, but then I'd be plodding too.

The most disappointing part of this flick though (I have a high tolerance for asinine characters and horror cliches) was the number of details that weren't well thought-out or researched by the director. Surely, I couldn't be the only viewer who noticed the STREET lights in front of the ""under siege"" abode. In virtually any part of the U.S. this would indicate one of two things: either the property was in or very near a municipality or it was adjacent to a major rural intersection or highway. Either way, you're not going to have the seclusion necessary for completely unnoticed and uninterrupted hours of torture, arson and other assorted mayhem. At some point a random motorist (yes, people DO drive in the country - even at night) is likely to notice a blazing Volvo in the drive or a truck stopped on the road and masked lunatics darting to-and-fro. But do we ever see a passing motorist? Not a one... even the hills in the Hills Have Eyes had more traffic.

Calling further question as to just how far in the sticks this isolated property was, from where did the Mormon boys arriving just after sunrise come? Utah? On bikes? That doesn't seem like a very efficient method or mode for protheletizing if you ask me.

If the nearest population center was indeed miles away, obviously they left their parents' homes in the middle of the night. Silly me for finding that an unlikely scenario.

Furthermore, speaking of parental dwellings, I don't ever recall hearing an explanation (or even subtle intimation) why Speedman's parents weren't home or why they weren't expected home at any time that evening or early the following day (admittedly, I might've already been half asleep during this part). Perhaps they were road trippin' to Bonnaroo considering their affinity for vinyl records and folk music... one can only guess.

And, regardess of the movie's description, no one will EVER mistake the run-of-the-mill everyday brick ranch-style killing site in the Strangers for a ""vacation home"". Unless there was some lakeshore or mountains behind the machine shed I missed, that's looking a lot like a regular single family home at the edge of suburbia or a small town to me. If his parents only occupied it during their ""vacations"", perhaps there's a good reason Liv shot down his proposal. Maybe he originally suggested eloping to Des Moines and Bertino edited that scene out later? Boringness after all is just as much a heritable trait as it is a learned behavior.

In all candor, I hate being overly critical of horror movies. As a huge fan of the zombine sub-genre, I have no problem making giant leaps of faith and overlooking Titanic-sized plot holes. But this movie's claim to terrorize was its supposed realism. Suffice to say, the contextual errors all but destroy the believability of this film.

If you're looking for a gut-wrenching (rather than yawn-inducing) flick with psychological terror, [painfully uncomfortable] suspense and randomness that's truly frightening, I'd highly suggest Funny Games (a shot-for-shot remake of Austrian sadism that loses nothing in translation) over this one. It succeeds in every sick way that the Strangers fails.",1218931200,2,4661,4.888607594936709
3523772,4,B001D2WU9I,"Calling ""The Strangers"" old school is not a put down at all.  It is a definite plus and a sign of praise because this film took it upon itself to strip away the contrivances we see all too often in thrillers these days.  It took two ordinary people and put them in a stark and isolated situation that would terrify any human being if it happened to them.

Even if you overlook the extremely frugal yet taut direction from Bryan Bertino, the eerily composed score from tomandandy and the remarkable sound design...even if you took all of that away, ""The Strangers"" is worth your time simply for the gut wrenching, anti-glamour performance from Liv Tyler.  She was absolutely amazing...bare bones, raw, intense and fierce, she rules the show as she goes from heartbroken lover, to suspicious houseguest, to terrorized victim to would be hero.  She was the real deal.

So, lock your doors.  Bolt your windows. And hope that you have a couple of friends willing to sleep over with you...""The Strangers"" are coming...",1218758400,4,1012,4.781609195402299
3523773,4,B001D2WU9I,"Far from the current crop of loud noise, teenage slasher films, this film delivers the scares the old fashioned way.  Dread and menace is built until both the lead characters and the audience are stuck right in the middle of a realistic, modern day horror situation.  The creepily masked assailants stalk their prey with sadism and without emotion and no easy answers are given as to their motivations.  This is what empowers ""The Strangers"" with such a degree of power.  People are killed everyday in real life for little or no motive so why not in the movies?  Liv Tyler and Scott Speedman are both great and for the most part avoid common horror movie cliches in their onscreen behaviours.  Tomandandy provide an eerie and chilling minimalistic soundtrack which really adds to the suspense of the film.  The Strangers isn't up there with films like The Shining or The Exorcist however it is a very noble and welcome addition to the horror genre and achieves far more scares then 100 Prom Nights could ever hope to achieve.",1218326400,10,1025,4.757062146892656
3523774,5,B001D2WU9I,"In response to some of the negative reviews: Some reviewers say that people banging on your door in the middle of the night isn't scary? Have they ever been in this type of situation before? I didn't think so. For someone who actually grew up in an isolated home in the woods, I can tell you how nerve wracking it is when you are all alone and you hear strange noises and think someone is out there. Some reviewers remark that the characters do dumb, ridiculous things. First, in horrific and intense situations that almost seem surreal, people aren't always going to make smart choices. You can say if you were in that situation, you would do this or do that. But you don't really know until it actually happens to you. Sometimes we only have a split second to think about what to do instead of sitting down and analyzing the situation. So why is it so hard to think that we wouldn't make the most intelligent choice? That is not what I call unrealistic as others say. Some reviewers have a problem with the ""because you were home,"" bit. Use your head and read between the lines people. These ""strangers"" are obviously unbalanced and what is more unsettling is to think that there are human beings out there (and there are) who get off on terrorizing innocent people just for the fun of it. To me, that is what true terror is. Some reviewers poke fun at the acting. Liv Tyler actually gives one incredible performance. Her emotional scenes were heightened beyond believable and you don't doubt for one second the horror this woman is being subjected to. I guess some audience members prefer seeing Jennifer Love Hewitt in a tighty whitey tank top yelling out ""What are you waiting for!?""

One reviewer says the ending was worse than Showgirls. Well, in my eyes anyone who even watched that film shouldn't be trusted to give a fair review. I never even watched Showgirls just for the record. Another reviewer says we saw this already in Vacancy. Not really. Vacancy doesn't even come close to creating the suspense that fills most of the running time in The Strangers. One reviewer says this is as bland as dry toast. Maybe she was drunk when she was eating her dry toast and writing her review? One reviewer says at least Saw had gore and sadistic violence. Anyone who aspires to gore and violence in their choice of films and think that it is quality filmmaking, they shouldn't be writing a review. ""Travis Deputy"" has given one of the most moronic reviews here. One issue he seems to have is that the film didn't tell us if Liv's character had survived and if the Strangers were caught. And we needed to see this why? A film is more than fine when it is left open-ended. (Hint hint: Think about the ending to Hitchcock's The Birds). Then he says ""Aren't some films just wonderful?"" Yes, they are. Like this one! Some reviewers say this is cliched because of the phones not working, the girl twists her ankle, etc. Let me just remind everyone that this is a movie. If the phones worked and they called the police, we would have a 30-minute film. And so what if she twists her ankle? Maybe the director is tipping his hat to the old-school horror films we all know and love. Find something else to complain about. I know, how about the Black Christmas and Prom Night remakes, films that really deserve the 1-star rating. There are also other reviewers who aren't happy when something scary doesn't happen within the first 15 minutes. If they would practice some patience and get to know the characters so the film can establish a backdrop, the suspense will happen soon enough. And in The Strangers, it did and once it started, it never let up and the payoff was more than rewarding.

The reason why I loved this film is because A. It was very intense and kept me interested and on edge the entire time B. The story was kept simple (simplicity being key) and captured the spirit of old school horror films C. The music and atmosphere used was very effective and downright chilling D. We did not know much about the Strangers so there was a sense of mystery which is lacking these days. I don't need everything spelled out for me in black and white to enjoy it. Was their an explanation in Halloween as to why Michael Myers was terrorizing Laurie Strode? Did we learn who the killer was in the 1974 horror gem Black Christmas? I guess people can't use their imaginations and want a motive like maybe the Strangers were getting revenge because one of their friends was killed by the couple or the couple was living in the Strangers old home, and they wanted it back. Maybe these Strangers were just born sick, plain and simple. Again, human beings of this nature is what true terror is.

I commend Bryan Bertino for his excellent direction and actors Liv Tyler and Scott Speedman who did a wonderful job. Liv looks as gorgeous as ever here. This film went back to the basics and as the Amazon reviewer stated, earned its scares the old-fashioned way. An isolated home in the woods, people knocking on your door in the middle of the night, an atmosphere of dread and doom, haunting music that heightens the suspense, a thrilling game of cat and mouse, it all adds up to one awesome horror flick! Do not miss this and ignore the poor reviews given by others. These are people who probably consider I Still Know What You Did Last Summer a good horror film or who just have bad taste in general. If you enjoy horror films that put the focus on the unexplained, suspense, atmosphere, music and characters, this is your kind of film. If you want fancy special effects, a love story with a happy ending or torture and gore, go rent something else. This film is all about putting the audience through the suspense ringer and it succeeds very well!

Also recommended is Neil Marshall's The Descent and Alexandre Aja's High Tension, both of which earn their scares the old-fashioned way much like The Strangers and keep your nerves on edge throughout!

3523813,5,B001D2WU9I,"Finally. A movie that you can rent with any of your friends, a loved one, a lover, of any human being who understands reality and can get scared...

This movie allegedly tells the take of a true story, but it is a mixture of many stories. This actual story never happened anywhere, at least not as the movie leads you to believe. It is not based on actual events of one story, but rather the idea that any stranger or group of strangers, COULD do what you are about to see.

This move is extremely effective, especially late at night, stormy or rainy night and with lights off. If you truly want to scare the CRAP out of your friends, have a neighbor come over (text them) about 45 minutes into the movie and knock on the door really loud. I am just saying it is effective!

Yes, there were a few times where they incorporated the cell phone - and it could have been possible, but they had chances to escape and did not really do a great job with being inventive. That said, and movies have to have something to go on, it still hits ""home"" quite well by showing some modern technology that needed to be shown - yet was not useable for whatever reason.

That said, you will not be disappointed one iota with the acting, writing, scares and even the ending (which could have run 100 ways in your mind as to what they could or would do) is well worth every penny. Maybe the best horror movie in years not being overtly made to be banned, not exploiting women, not exploiting children, etc. It is just a well made, scary, horror movie.",1521158400,,1531,4.305555555555555

3523843,5,B001D2WU9I,"I remember seeing this film awhile ago and recalled one thing that stood out from the other horror films that were released at the time; atmosphere.
I feel that many horror films released are quite boring and generic. This film truly has a creep factor backed up with excellent sound design and a chilling score.
The film centers on a couple having a rough night. They stay at a friends cabin only to have their night get a whole lot worse. Three strangers being stalking them. First outside and then eventually entering the house.
I will suggest you suspend some disbelief at some of the character choices, I mean it is a horror film. One thing I will commend is that the characters aren't perfect and actually stay that way. One cliche I usually recall is one meek character eventually becoming Rambo at the end facing off against a strong killer. Here I feel its presented in a much more grounded fashion.
Yes there are flaws and in fact if you want a hilarious review of this film, Id highly suggest you watch it on the YouTube channel, Your Movie Sucks. Adam rips this film to shreds and its great.
At the end of the day. This is a creepy horror film that is also gusty in its execution.
I also recommend the original film ILS: Them, that is much more too the point in terms of pacing, but still worth a watch

Scream Factory has certainly raised the bar in their Blu ray releases. We get a fantastic cover art and a two disc set with the Theatrical and Unrated cuts. Both films have a new HD transfer. The picture looks awesome  Captures that low lighting wonderfully. Make sure your room is nice and dark!  Same with the DTS surround mix. This is ideal for a home theater.

The good:

The random act of violence aspect and anonymity often mentioned in reviews.

The basic premise of the movie.

The lead into the events.

The bad:

The execution of the premise of the movie and the pacing.

The ""villains"" are meant to reflect random thrill seeking killers that are just people. However, the killers appear and disappear in a supernatural fashion. The also coordinate non-verbally. Seem to be immune to fear of an armed person. Immune to harm and precognizant. In short they don't seem like people at all and more like a supernatural slasher akin to Jason or Michael Myers where the rules of the universe exempt them.

Our heroes are ""stupid"". For all of our supernatural killers have in their favor, our heroes seem supernaturally stupid. Expect to scream at the screen a lot ...even for a horror movie.

In short, I didn't like it. There are a lot of good horror movies out there. Part of the problem is the way the movie and the viewers depict the movie as as a ""it could happen to you"" quality of it. I think if you are looking for a slasher movie, this is fine. For me, this movie is grossly overrated and not unique at all. It loses a star for the undelivered hype.",1517788800,,1299,4.447257383966245

3523882,5,B001D2WU9I,"James and Kristen come home from a friend's wedding to a remote cabin, James' childhood summer home. A stranger comes to the door at 4am and leaves, only to return multiple times despite being told she has the wrong house. The incidences get more and more frightening as the phone stops working and noises are heard throughout the house. A trio of people torment the couple throughout the night and only time will tell if the couple will survive the encounter.

I first saw The Strangers in the theater when it came out and it still holds up. The characters, the eerie suspense, and the villains make the film memorable despite it's pretty basic plot. James and Kristen are going through a hard time. While most times home invasion movies target happy couples without a care in the world, there is already tension when the movie starts. They should be elated, but instead, they drive home in silence, refusing to look at one another. Kristen refused James' marriage proposal because she wasn't ready and both are pretty upset. They get to a place where they can both move forward and talk rationally about their relationship, but intruders interrupt their relationship problems.

The eerie atmosphere stays throughout the film. It starts with the couple's emotional tension and progresses to quiet, mundane moments punctuated with either intermittent loud bangs or silent intrusions. The loud bangs show how the people outside could be doing anything and use the loud noises to both distract and frighten. The most memorable scene is when Kristen is smoking and getting a glass to drink while a man in a sack mask simply observes from behind her. Our most mundane moments are supposed to be safe and private while these scenes have the intruders boldly observe them without really hiding. This type of scene repeats throughout the film and makes the danger real. Silence and sounds are used effectively from the strained silence of hiding in a closet to the blaring record music to cover James' brother's arrival.

The villains are memorable because of their masks, bold attitude, and surprisingly competent tactics. Nothing is really known about them as people because it doesn't really matter. They randomly chose this couple to terrorize and seem to work well as a team. With three people, it's much easier to strategize and keep eyes on the couple at all times. They anticipate what the couple will do and respond to surprises with supernatural calm. They remove their masks at the end, but their faces are thankfully kept out of the frame. The ending confirms that this is likely be their first kill and they want to do it again.

The Strangers is such an atmospheric movie that feels realistic. James and Kristen fight these intruders and honestly do their best. They don't make many obvious mistakes and they don't make it easy for the intruders. The Strangers: Prey at Night is coming out next year and even though it's coming out a decade after the original, I'm pretty hyped. I hope they follow generally the same formula with the atmosphere and the treatment of the villains at the very least.",1514505600,,3104,4.862003780718337

The ambiance could be creepy and scary but you don't believe it, and that's the biggest failure of the film, it's hard to make a point without spoiling its contents, but to be brief (spoiler alert) there's a point where a character walks into a friend's house, noticing the door entrance has been forced, his friends' car totaled by some strangers' pickup truck, there's music playing, broken glass and lamps, ok, you get the point, and what does this character does? Walks around the house, very slowly, doing his best at being silent. Not one call for his friend. Doesn't act scared. No phone call. Was he supposed to be drunk? I think he was supposed to be, but if that was the case, that must be among the worst drunken acting in the history of cinema.

3523952,5,B001D2WU9I,"Amazon has this review listed under the DVD version of this movie. The version which I own and which this review is based upon is the Universal Studios Blu-Ray version.

If you like horror movies (and who doesnt), this ones for you. First of all, forget about plot. There really isn't any. Forget also about dialogue. What dialogue it includes is quite banal and adds little to the movie. What this movie has however is ATMOSPHERE, and it has it in abundance. In one of the extras on the Blu-ray version of the film, the director and other key filmmaking personnel discuss the lengths that they went to in order to create a highly charged, suspenseful and terrifying atmosphere for the movies lead characters.

In my opinion, they succeeded greatly. Although the film starts out slowly (hang in there, it will pick up considerable steam as it goes along), the viewer (as well as the lead characters) start to notice strange and ominous happenings around the house. There is never any hint of hauntings or the supernatural in these events (and the noises which accompany them). Instead, its clear throughout the movie that while the strange occurrences may be as frightening as anything supernatural, they are from the real world.

One key element of the film is the costuming in my opinion. By this, I mean specifically the masks. They contribute significantly to the sense of the terror which builds throughout the movie and demonstrate the creative lengths to which the filmmakers went on order to create a unique and inventive horror film. I liked seeing the bad guys in something other than the usual hockey masks or ski masks.

I have the Universal Studios Blu-Ray version which contains both the theatrical cut and the unrated version and I have seen both. There really isn't much difference in the two in my opinion. The unrated version is slightly longer and has a slightly different ending which I don't think adds that much to the film. Also, the unrated version has a considerable amount of F-bombs and other foul language.

I have noticed that this movies reviewers (both here on Amazon and elsewhere) tend to fall into two camps. Those who think its quite boring (1-2 stars) and those who think its great (4-5 stars). There doesnt seem to be much in between. I have given it 5 stars on Amazon because I liked it a lot. If you like scary movies, I would say don't miss this one. Also, I would NOT recommend watching it alone, especially late at night.

Addendum 

Apparently this movie is getting some extra attention promotion wise. As I write this, I have noticed that Shout Factory/Scream Factory has announced a Collectors Edition Blu-ray for later in 2017 or early 2018. Shout Factory has described it as an upgrade with more extras, cast interviews, etc. to the existing movie. There has also been a sequel announced (The Strangers 2) which is currently being filmed and due out in 2018. You can find out more about that one on IMDB.",1502496000,,2951,4.738791423001949

As one gets to know the characters, minimally but on a very personal level, what they're already experiencing just as a matter of regular living creates great empathy. It's impossible not to care about them. That makes the entire film effective. I was a little worried about Liv Tyler, who in my previous observation has not been much of an actress, though charming, but this director got what may be a once-in-a-lifetime performance out of her. She carries a good deal of the movie and she does it believably and with wrenching emotional investment. An understated gem, 10/10.",1493769600,12,633,4.981132075471698

Not a whole lot of character development but luckily this movie doesn't rely too heavily on backstory or character development.

3524105,5,B001D2WU9I,"If you are not ready, please don't even think about watching this movie cause this movie will make your heart stop beating.
It is really really scary.
It has nothing to do with the screenplay.
Some says script is more then 50% of the movie.
This movie is all about sound + framing + and actin.

The sound makes you scare the shit out of you to death. You should be really prepared.
Otherwise don't be bothered even turning on this dvd.
If you want to live a little longer.
The one who did the sound design wanted just to kill us all I guess.
Silence is a great weapon. The killers never speaks till the end.
That is really really scary. They are wearing the mask some kind of KKK kind.
That is really make you wet your pants kind of thing.
The girls are even scary then the man. They are just so intensive to even look at.

The framing is just genious work of art.
Whenever the killer appears it was so intense and so so creepy to even look at because it is so out of focus and it is in the same frame with the main actors all the time. We know that they are there to kill the main charactor and the main charactors does not know foolishly.

It's easy to say but seeing is not easy.

Acting.

Liv Tyler, she is so beautiful but that's not the point here.
Her screaming and being scared in this movie is everything that counts in this film.
It just makes us want to jump into the screen and save her.
Scott Speedman (UNDERWORLD) is brave but not powerful enough to stop them all.
He is brave but not smart to outcome them. That makes us even more scary.
He just goes out to be the victim.
Yes he will be dead at the end.
But he is a charming guy and we all don't want him not to.

The music is not that strong. But the background sound effect is all that counts and that is really something.

If you have a weak heart maybe you should skipp this film but if you are ready you should maybe just have to click at once and buy this dvd now.
I mean now!

WHERE TO FIND:

It's not difficult buying this movie from your country. And it's only 6.59$.
 It's a bit expensive in Korea. It's about 9$ and it is an R rated version not the Unrated one.

The acting is well done but you can't help but feel frustrated at some of the dumb decisions that were made.  However the frustration is also part of the excitement I guess.  You will definitely not get bored watching this.  Oh yeah and the music absolutely makes this terrifying.

3524536,2,B001D2WU9I,"This movie does almost nothing for me. Spoiler alert! It's foundation, the core of the whole thing, is nothing more than a series of suspenseful scenes. So what you end up with is, suspense, false shock, suspense, shock, suspense, false shock, on and on and on until it gets really irritating. Wonder what's around that corner? SURPRISE! It's nothing. Next time... SURPRISE! It really is something this time! Bet you didn't see that coming! It would be fine if there were more to it, but there isn't. It's brainless. You can't build the movie around a single cinematic device. You need a plot. You need to give us a reason to care what happens next. There is no skeleton, it's just meat. In this case, really bad meat. It's not even shot well.
The protagonists do the usual idiotic things all protagonists do in horror films. Let's split up! We'll be easier to kill that way! Unknown threats are outside the house? I know! Let's step out into the night, that way, if they have guns, we'll be REALLY easy targets and they can hide safely in the cover of the woods! Their actions are consistently unbelievable as well. You find your girlfriend has just been attacked by a masked man & now you're in an immediately dangerous and desperate situation. What's the first thing anyone would say? Naturally, the first words out of your mouth would be, ""What did the mask look like? Was it a nice mask? Was it scary?"" How about, ""What kind of shoes was he wearing? Did they match his outfit? Were they dated? Were they suitable for hiking or were they more casual?"" You go to your friend's house and find it looks like a war zone. Someone attacks you. Solution? Lurk through the house without announcing yourself. Two teenage kids find a wrecked house with dead bodies on the floor. Should we stare at the corpses for a while or go get help? Should we touch their bodies? I'm sure the cops won't mind if that one bleeds out while we stand here gawking for a while. And, don't tell me this nonsense can be chalked up to shock. If they are trying to convey shock or panic, then it's some of the worst acting imaginable.
The disclaimer at the beginning about how nobody fully understands what really happened was apparently added to cover the massive plot holes, rather than to create a true sense of mystery or the supernatural. Even the continuity falls apart. Being attacked? Suddenly cut to a scene of the person being attacked crawling through the grass. How did she get outside? How did she escape the line of sight of her attacker? Who cares? Just go with it. Why explain anything?
I wanted to like this movie. I really did, but I have failed. The only reason for the two stars is for the SMALL amount of quality atmosphere here & there, and for the soundtrack. Tomandandy did their usual stellar work on the score. It's not their best, but it is very good and the only truly redeeming quality to be found. All things considered, this movie is not on the level of the very worst I've seen by any means, but it takes a lot more than an admittedly decent premise to make a good film.

Short description: It's an assault that goes on for an hour & a half with no explanation or intrigue.

3524552,5,B001D2WU9I,"The Strangers

 I usually enjoy watching big explosions on the movie screen or things that make me laugh or rarely, something that might make me think.  I don't enjoy having the bejeebers scared out of me.  For you that like having the bejeebers scared out of you, I saw The Strangers this week.
 Right out of the box I have to say that Liv Tyler is one of my favorite actresses.  I wanted to see her, even in a scary movie.  She was of course great.  I knew it would be a hard movie for me when the first shot of her was of her crying.  She had just told her boyfriend no when he asked her to marry him.  The pair still head for the county house for their planned romantic evening, now spoiled.  They should have stayed in town.
 This is a finely crafted scary movie.  The tension builds slowly for the first two thirds of the film until you want to claw your hair out of your scalp.  Nothing much happens, but noises are heard and very creepy bad people are briefly glimpsed wearing masks.  You know bad stuff is coming down, inevitable, unstoppable like cargo breaking loose in a storm at sea.  The scary movie makers craft is in prolonging the inevitable.  You want the two lovers to somehow escape, to out wit or out fight their tormentors.  But the bad people are remorseless.
 This R rated movie is extremely violent, but it is no simple gore fest splatter flick.  It is a movie that scares the viewer without just plane grossing the viewer out.  There is a taste for this kind of thing.  The budget to make this movie was only nine million dollars, the three day take was $21 million, a very large three day total for this genre.  Moreover, the per screen revenue was a spectacular $8,500.  The people have spoken.  They like this movie.
 This is a really scary two saw blade movie, the best available for the genre.  See it with somebody whose hand you can hold.  And use the cup holders for your drink so you don't spill when you jump out of your skin.",1428537600,2,1962,4.301369863013699

Quite a few home invasion copycats since, but nothing can quite capture the tense creepy atmosphere of The Strangers. Kind of sets a tone like no other. Saw it once a while back and it stuck with me. Watched again and it's even better. I could not help but be transported to the same sense of shock at points that came from Michael's terrible visage appearing just behind Jamie Lee Curtis in the hallway from the original Halloween film. Negative reviews here all sound pre-jaded. If you go in without expectations, it's hard not to be gripped by the intensity. Sure the characters make some wrong turns, but it's a rather well thought out twisty storyline. We all think we'd be heroic geniuses in a situation like this, but truthfully most would cower, try to run, be trapped by fear, and do stupid things. That's sort of the point. Monday morning armchair cinematic quarterbacks sighting ""realism issues"" take a seat, enjoy the ride.

I won't ruin the ending by disclosing it to anyone who hasn't seen it already, but it is most apropos for what things are like today with someone being murdered for five cents or for a thrill.  Yes, the couple acts stupidly, and some of the episodes seem a little overreaching, but that is the part of the ""willing suspension of disbelief"" that helps to enjoy a movie like this.  I think some judicious cutting would have been in order, but maybe the length gives the ending more of a punch. The ABSENCE of the supernatural makes the ending even more terrifying as does the setting of a rural-suburban type.  Come to think of it, the ending dialogue is reminiscent of Capote's ""In Cold Blood""  (book and the first black-and-white version shot in real time and lighting conditions in the house where the murders took place), with one killer's comment about a victim whom he had placed on a mattress box to make him more comfortable before killing:  'he was a nice man; I liked him right up to the time I cut his throat.'",1414281600,2,1124,4.512315270935961

3524649,5,B001D2WU9I,"I have a very high tolerance for horror movies, rarely com in no across one that truly terrifies me.  This is a movie that truly terrified me.  I was scrolling through the tv channels and of course nothing was on.  I came across this with a description that stated something along the lines of ""a young couple is terrorized by some neighborhood kids"".  I thought to myself ""this sounds really lame, but there's nothing else on"", so I put it on.  I was alone.  All alone under a blanket and terrified.

3524674,3,B001D2WU9I,"I believe that there is a rule in horror films, in particular the home-invasion movies, that goes something like the following:  someone must either die or be seriously injured in the first 15 minutes.  Otherwise, the audience will quickly become bored.  Evidently, the director of ""The Strangers"" -- Bryan Bertino -- never got the memo.

There are more false starts in this movie than the 100 meter dash at the Olympics.  Fairly early on, you just might think, ""Oh, Scott Speedman's gonna get it now!"" and then when that fails, you think shortly thereafter, ""Oh, don't open the door, Liv Tyler!""  But nothing really happens.  Well, it does add to the suspense, I suppose.  At least it tries to be the thinking-man's horror film.  In the first act.

But perhaps both of these main characters deserve to die, not that I'm going to tell you if that happens or not.  After all, if you have a home, and you don't have a gun at the ready -- Mr. Speedman does, but he doesn't remember how to use it, of course -- then you deserve to get carved up by the invaders in my opinion.  I have a 9MM myself, and it is ready to rock and roll, and I make sure to keep my license active as well.  (BTW:  for any of you anti-gun pushers out there, I say, ""Go ahead; don't get a gun!  Then the criminals will come to your house instead of mine.""  It's a win-win-win; you can prove a point, the killers can kill someone, and I can continue living.)

And why is it that people that are the victims of home invasions only have land-line phones anyways?  Surely, almost everyone has a cell phone nowadays, except for perhaps Ms. Tyler in this film.  Of course, one of the first things the invaders do is cut the phone lines so she can't really call for help.  (Not that this matters anyways.  Without flogging a dead horse on the whole gun issue, if I were the victim in a home invasion scenario, I would grab my gun first.  If you try to call the cops, by the time you're off the phone you'll be dead.  With a loaded gun you at least have a chance.)

But the real issue that I have with this movie:  After watching, I'm not convinced that I understand the main theme.  Any movie, in my opinion, should have a strong theme; it's the glue that holds all of the pieces of the film together.  There seems to be some religious nonsense thrown in at the end that I just didn't get.  Did the writer and/or director not know in which direction this film should go, and so they just threw that in last minute?  At any rate, this film doesn't seem to say anything important, minus perhaps,  ""It's not much fun to get sliced and diced.""  And maybe, ""You might die just because you're home.""

Well, this is all too bad, because this film had a chance for greatness.  But I'm not convinced that it's even any good.",1406073600,,2779,4.323643410852713

---
Horror movies have a pretty bad reputation in general so I don't judge them as harshly as other genres.  That being said, I still have two basic requirements for a horror movie to be somewhat decent.  The lesser of these two demands is commendable audio and visuals of the frightful elements in the movie (obvious enough).  The second but certainly more important demand is for the overall plot to be suspenseful and frightening without relying [too heavily] on the previous demand.  For an example, in order for a plot to be suspenseful and scary, it should not be solely dependent on men in burlap sack masks popping up (or not popping up) in the background every time the girl faces away.  That's NOT a suspenseful plot!  It's simply a handful of scenes with men in burlap sack masks playing peekaboo.

Before I keep ranting about the abominable plot (most important requirement), let me quickly address how well ""The Strangers"" fulfilled the other requirement.  It didn't.  See, quick!  The ONLY reason why anyone watching would jump is because he/she has a decent enough sound system that can really amplify the difference between silence and a SCREAM.  Who wouldn't jump if he/she randomly heard a scream? As for the visuals, suits and burlap sack masks? Doll masks? Really? Both Scarecrow from Batman and Chuckie were much scarier looking.  Unless blood/gore really scares you, the visuals will be extremely boring.

Back to the plot.  Most of the movie takes place at night inside a shady vacation home in the middle of the woods and the surrounding area.  And it's BORING.  Now don't get me wrong.  There are movies out there that are much scarier and even utilizes a smaller and more static environment.  But the way that this movie was done, you kept seeing the same mundane scenes in the house from the same angles over and over again with the same sound effects. We get it!  There's the door and here comes the knock!  Same door! Wait for it......knock!  You feel like you could edit the rest of the movie after watching less than a quarter of it!  But that's too bad. You're not being paid to edit it.

So the actual plot seems to be about how long these three sadistic strangers in masks can go without becoming bored and finally killing the couple in the home.  That's really all there is to it.  Once you realize that the couple is doomed from the get-go (guy doesn't even know how to use a gun and when he figures it out, shoots the wrong person), the rest of the movie becomes a drag.  The movie relied way too much on the three strangers popping up randomly to keep the audience on the edge of their seats.

I'm going to be lazy and wrap this up since this review is already way too long.  However, I'll leave you with this.  We all brace ourselves for full impact from human ignorance in horror movies.  But not even elf armor can protect you from this level.",1405728000,5,3154,4.578571428571428

3524705,5,B001D2WU9I,"The Strangers is the disturbing chilling film debut for director Bryan Bertino about a home invasion, loosely based upon the Manson Familys murder of Sharon Tate, and possibly inspired by the French film Them.  While this film does not break any new ground regarding its story, the fascinating use of music, imagery and camera work allows a menacing atmosphere of paranoia and claustrophobia to build up throughout the film, eventually reaching its shocking climax.

The film begins by introducing us to James Hoyt (Scott Speedman) and his partner Kristen McCay (Liv Tyler). Their evening is not off to a good start, when James makes a marriage proposal to Kristen and she rejects him. However it gets much worse when a masked young woman knocks on the door. This is the beginning of a series of disturbances that start out as annoying and a little eerie but soon develop into something far more threatening which leads you to question Just how safe are you in your own home?

The Strangers are Dollface (Gemma Ward), Man In The Mask (Kip Weeks) and Pin-Up Girl (Laura Margolis) and they all wear masks throughout the film. The blank anonymity this gives these characters is one of the most unnerving aspects of The Strangers as it dehumanizes them implying that they cant be reasoned with, also coupled with the fact that only Dollface speaks for the majority of the film and even she only has about five lines in total most of which can be seen in the film trailer.

 There is a range of techniques that Bertino uses to frighten his audience. Every camera shot in The Strangers has a specific purpose in mind to disconcert the viewer. He frequently shoots from the characters point of view and he allows the audience to see things the characters dont. We know that The Strangers are in the house long before the characters realise it. A particularly unnerving scene when Kristen is standing in the kitchen completely oblivious to Man In The Mask standing watching her from the corner of the room. The Strangers also seem to possess the ability to appear and disappear soundlessly, therefore adding to the idea that they are not quite human.

For me personally, the scariest aspect of The Strangers is that they have no apparent motives, personalities or anything else that would make them human. Kristen asks Why are you doing this to us? and Dollface replys simply Because you were home.  The Strangers do not respond to pleas or emotions. They cannot be reasoned with. It's pure nihilism. They kill because they find control and domination powerful, and they don't care about consequences, moral or of any other kind. At the end of the film when they finally kill James and Kristen, they remove their masks and we are reminded that we are not dealing with the supernatural, but real human beings who have chosen the path of evil and cant be convinced otherwise.

This film is genuinely chilling, however it focuses more on psychological torture rather than physical and may therefore let down less sophisticated horror fans. However for those who appreciate more subtle horror, The Strangers will definitely not disappoint.",1396396800,,3127,4.853658536585366

Anyway, I would not consider this movie the scariest I've ever seen. It's not realistic, there are some parts where I just shook my head at the stupidity. For example, if the assailants are coming after you from all directions, you don't split up. I'm willing to concede, I can't begin to fathom what I would do in their shoes and I hope I never have the chance to find out, but come on.

What made this scary for me, made it a terror film, was it reminded me of The Texas Chainsaw Massare. Its a movie that that could very easily be a reality, to anyone.

With the strangers, I anticipated a goofy slasher with lots of blood and jumpy scares, and was pleasantly surprised when I actually saw the film.  The Strangers is more about the mood, building intensity and imparting that sense of dread and anticipation that great horror directors do so well.  While The Strangers doesn't quite reach masterpiece heights, it sticks to the slow-burn anticipation of the greats, and is a fun ride from start to finish.  4 Stars for slightly above average horror film, and Liv Tyler.

3524719,4,B001D2WU9I,"I lie between those who see this as a masterpiece, and those who see it as en empty exercise in clichd sadism. On the one side, the film is very well made and effective. The cinematography, the acting, the editing, the score and direction work together to create a lot of truly creepy uncomfortable suspense, without resorting to too much gore, especially in the film's first half.

On the other hand, it lacks any thematic core (as opposed to, for example ""Territories"" a recent low budget horror film that also managed to raise questions about political prisoners and xenophobic paranoia). It also lacks any psychological insight although the first half hints that might be where the film is going. But these horrific intruders aren't ultimately reflections of the main characters' inner lives, or a comment on their emotional struggles. They're just generic, unexplained evil. The film does a good job of evoking a nightmare, but by not aiming higher misses the chance to be something more special than an effective scare machine.",1390608000,4,1033,5.005813953488372

3524721,1,B001D2WU9I,"In this flick, its bare-plot just dealt with a couple at an isolated place being annoyed by three strangers who had an intent to kill (but wanted to scare them more first). This had no point, was entirely uninteresting, offers nothing new compared to other horror movies, contained no character development, and I didn't even see the hardly-terrorized couple as 'real people'. The situation had so many ridiculous moments that it was embarassingly funny and became one of the dullest movies of any genre.

It tried to tell us at the start about how it was based on true events. Now, whenever you read anything like that, the most miniscule amount of a real event could be used in the flick and all the rest can be fake. If a person took a dump in the movie and that is something that took place in the real history, then it can be 'based on a true story' and they aren't fully lying. I think most people believe the majority of everything is based on actual events in such tales, when the opposite is most likely because it is a movie script with an author.

Here we go! I've written the above information before looking around and, lo and behold, I read details stating that this was based on a memory of the writer/director Brian Bertino. As a boy, he recalled a stranger came to the door asking for someone. Later, there were a lot of burglaries in the area. That's it! From such an incredibly miniscule 'story', it was stretched into the 'plot' of this movie. For all we know, that stranger could have been trying to find someone he hadn't seen in a long time and surprise. He didn't scare the writer/director and most-likely had nothing to do with the burglaries (which didn't even involve murders).

We read at the end of the film that ""The brutal events that took place there are still not entirely known."" Really? Since the movie ends with the woman suddenly coming-to in fear after someone who found her touches her, are we to think that that she survived long enough to tell SOME of the tale? For there to be a movie, events had to come from her or the person who found her. If it was from that person, then the only true part of the flick would have been that at some time in history, a person came upon people who'd been attacked. Without knowing what part of the movie is based on actual events, people tend to think the majority really took place. The only true thing for this movie: it's fully fiction except that the writer encountered a stranger in his life.

There is so little substance to this movie that writing more is a waste, but here I go with some various thoughts anyway.

- The writer spoke of wanting to strip away many of the horror cliches so it doesn't get repetetive . . . but the movie's just filled with them.

 * couple is in the middle of nowhere and cell phones are not working; jump-scares; first, the bad-person is there then he's not (oooh ... where did he go?); a baddie is right behind you but nobody bothers to look even though he was just previously seen in that direction; someone stands in the distance just staring (shades of HALLOWEEN'S Michael Myers); woman decides to make a run for it and trips (nobody's ever tried THAT before)...starts crawling...one of the baddies appears behind her and she doesn't know it or behave in a manner that she expects it to happen (but it's okay because the stalker will just disappear for no reason except to make the movie longer and add fake tension); and at the end, we have some kids come upon the house and find the bodies...one starts to reach out for the woman, who suddenly perks up and screams while the movie ends (is she alive or not?); etc. *

- The unrated version has approx. 2 minutes of added length, which consists of just one extra scene near the end that made no difference. In it, we see that the woman was also not fully expired...she hears the cellphone of the guy who was accidentally shot...she crawls to it....the masked-man returns, takes the phone and chooses to leave her still alive a bit. That's all.

- The almost-husband is a moron. The woman told him that one of the strangers came into the place. He says that nobody came in. How could he be so certain and why in the world does he doubt her immediately for no reason? The woman's terrified and the man decides to leave her with the baddies (which he doesn't even think exist). The act of him leaving the house was to get them separated so the audience would have another location/setting to look at.

- The baddies take time to make spooky noises, play records of dull music, and write words repeatedly on windows without being noticed. Maybe they were having flashbacks of being bad in school where they had to write the same word over and over.

- In the extra-feature on the DVD, someone's talking about how he agrees with what he heard from others: that it's not a horror movie but a terror movie. I disagree with that. This is not horror and there was nothing terrifying here either.

- This is a perfect example of a movie where sounds ruin the atmosphere. A spooky masked person appears out of the shadows and you're presented with a quick bunch of notes/lil' bit of music indicating something happened that you should be scared of. Just like canned laughter in a sitcom, which assumes that the audience doesn't know when to laugh, a similar method is used here and it fails. It needed to be quieter in order to gain some sense of terror. The movies ""High Tension"" and ""Funny Games"" got that part right.

- Perhaps the worst scene is when the dude's in the car and bending down to get something. Oooh....a human hand appears and a finger touches him on the neck. He quickly freaks and turns around to see that there's isn't anybody. Quickly getting out of the vehicle, he encounters nobody. So in a split-second, the actual person ran away and hid? Or is this to represent how fear caused him to imagine something that didn't really happen? Regardless, it's another
cliche and unoriginal.

Another scene equally annoying: the couple is in the car after they managed to grow brains and decided late-in-the-game that it just might be a good idea to leave. A truck pulls up behind them -- but not too close. The almost-husband driver sees a masked woman -- who was originally ON the property -- is in the vehicle (I guess she ran off to get it so they could use it to smash the other car). Looking ahead, the couple see the masked man in front of the car. Rather than try and run him over or merely drive away, genius-man brilliantly suggests to the wife that they ""Get out of the car."" I changed my mind: that is definitely the worst scene and one that should make everyone say ""What in the world are you doing??"".

That truck, by the way, is apparently the same one that we see the three baddies in at the end of the flick. At that time, we see that it miraculously wasn't damaged at all even though they rammed the couple's car with it earlier. ""It will be easier next time,"" are the final words of one of the women baddies as papa (?) drives away. Seriously, there
was nothing hard for any of them. They were spending time making records play, writing messages, sneaking up with an axe and stopping and disappearing for no reason, banging on doors and making other noises,
etc. A lot of what was done was just to get the audience to think ""Uhoh...this is it!"" and then it was over. None of the strangers got hurt and they made it hard for themselves by taking a long time to do their terrible deeds. I can picture one of the baddies thinkin' ""Sure, I could hurt them now, but first I need to change the record."" There was nothing of resistance they encountered and the couple could have just been offed right at the start. Maybe it wasn't easy in their minds because they were mechanics (or ""MacGyver"" wannabes) and it took time to fix the banged-up truck and make it all pretty before they left?

- The only potentially-good idea the couple had was when they were in the closet and decided to just shoot whoever came in. Yet after they accidentally kill a friend that showed up, stupidity returns and
they decide it's best to leave the closet. I think they could have still remained and made sure that it was a masked person first before shooting. Then again, maybe the strangers would have also grown a brain by then and realized that the targets have a weapon and not gone in.

- So, at one point, something was blocking the smoke from getting out of a fireplace's chimney. In time, the house should have filled with smoke. I guess the blockage eventually fixed itself. Maybe what happened was one of the strangers climbed up to the roof, blocked the chimney so that an alarm would go off and spook the woman, removed the blockage, climbed down from the roof, and eventually snuck into the house and turned over the detector to scare her even more. What amazing planning! The strangers
must also be psychics to know that the woman was going to drop the smoke detector.

- This was compared to ""Funny Games"", which also had no real plot and only dealt with a dangerous pair of 20-somethings who had nothing better to do than travel around playing mind-games with unsuspecting people and killing them in the end. It was a much more interesting movie with some 'terror' moments and wasn't filled with continual stupidity like this one.

- ""Why are you doing this?"" the woman/almost-wife asked. ""Because you were home,"" one of the masked women-strangers says. In a non-brilliant move, the trailer for the movie ends with this which ruins the 'twist'.

- The strangers' time writing on windows and just appearing and disappearing over and over made me think that they weren't human or this was some person's traumatic memories/creation. The movie seemed to want the audience to think that something supernatural was going on when there really wasn't. It felt like it couldn't make up its mind and, in the end, they were just basic serial killers.

In conclusion, this was totally forgettable and I slept very well that night. It's a bad movie where the barely-terrorized couple had a shotgun with a lot of shells and a working car that none of the three strangers had enough sense to damage so the couple could easily escape. The movie was filled with stupid cliches and dumb actions or inaction.

It's a bit sad when I watched an old review on YouTube which had a guy talking about how fantastic the flick is and that he was going to pay to see it again and get the DVD. Of course he can have his
opinion, but I was thinking ""Dude, don't pay any movie theatre their exorbitant price twice! Just wait a few months for the DVD.""

Out of all of my reviews, this is the first movie
that I gave one star to. According to the rating system here at Amazon, one star means 'I hate it'. Even with other movies I disliked, I was always able to find something semi-worthwhile and gave two stars ('I don't like it')...but I couldn't seem to do that with this one which had nothing I even semi-liked.

  Initially, when I saw ""The Strangers"" in the video store, I refused to buy it because of the cover depicting a hooded man dragging someone across the floor by their legs.  I thought it was another one of those gory, mundane torture porn films.  My friend Beth loaned it to me.  I was simply amazed by the message that it taught me.  The plot was simple; a young couple spending the night in a house in the country is terrorized by masked strangers.  However, the plot was also terrifying.  A year later, I can't forget the film's message.  I probably never will.

  Bryan Bertino's ""The Strangers"" is realistic in that innocent people are attacked all the time in this country by amoral strangers who are simply looking for a thrill.  The film merely sheds some light on this growing epidemic.  It reminded me that I should never open the door to a stranger at night or during the day for that matter.  (If you pay me a visit, you better call me beforehand.)  If a stranger comes to my door more than once, I'm calling 911.  I will always remember to keep my iPhone charged.  I don't want to make myself a prisoner in my own home but it is better to be cautious than dead.

  The film's leads (Liv Tyler and Scott Speedman) deliver excellent performances as the young, beautiful couple who are terrorized without mercy.  There is much chemistry between them, making the scenes more believable.  Because I liked the characters, I feared for their safety and experienced a tremendous amount of tension and stress whenever events didn't bode well for them.  ""The Strangers"" is not a high body count thriller with a lot of torture scenes and gore.  It is a cautionary tale that warns us that there are evil, demented strangers who enjoy preying on innocent people.

  ""The Strangers"" is highly recommended for fans who enjoy realistic horror.  Since watching it, I've had two incidents of strangers ringing my doorbell late at night.  I never answered; I just let them ring it until they finally left.  Mom, who was visiting me during the last incident, looked out of the second story window and saw a young girl walk away from the front door and join a guy who'd been standing under a nearby tree.  They may have mistaken my apartment for one belonging to a drug dealer.  Everyone, I believe, should watch ""The Strangers.""  Even if it doesn't scare you, it may save your life.

3524753,5,B001D2WU9I,I would consider this an instant horror classic. this movie is creepy and the people who play the strangers did an excellent job at just being creepy and evil. I would not doubt that actually happened. there are a lot of crazies out there that would do what they did. the movie also stars liv tyler and scott speedman. I thought liv did an excellent job and scott did to. the story is great and the movie has that eerie feeling witch I like to find in these kinds of movies. if you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do,1381795200,,530,4.155339805825243

I thought the cast, and the acting were both good. The translation to Blu-ray came out very nice as well, compared to the DVD version I seen at a friend's house. The movie leaves you with wanting more tho. I heard there was supposed to be a sequel made to this movie, but I don't know what ever came of that. I don't hear anything about a sequel for this anymore now. I do recommend this film to watch or buy.

As the silence and tension grows, someone comes knocking on the door asking if so and so is there (you can't really hear who they are asking for, it's muffled).  From there, a few scenes of a mysterious person in a mask lingering behind backs or peaking in windows are looking at the main characters.  Those scenes were good to build a sense of tension or fear.  And ... that's about it.

The ending was just an ending.  It's like they ran out of something (time, money, energy, etc.) to do anything more substantial than end it as they did.  Fortunately I got it from the library for free.",1379376000,2,881,4.296969696969697

I'm normally not a big fan of Liv Tyler as I consider her acting pretty wooden. However, she is quite tolerable in The Strangers. But the real stars are the masked people who terrorize her and Scott Speedman's character. Truly a great horror.",1375833600,,517,4.329896907216495

This is how the story goes: After returning from a wedding reception, a couple staying in an isolated vacation house receive a knock on the door in the mid-hours of the night. What ensues is a violent invasion by three strangers, their faces hidden behind masks. The couple find themselves in a violent struggle, in which they go beyond what either of them thought capable in order to survive. The cast led by Liv Tyler (as Kristen McKay) and Scott Speedman (as James Hoyt) is great! The story and screenplay and directing by Bryan Bertino is great! The music by tomandandy (who also did the music to ""The Hills Have Eyes"" (2006) is excellent! The cinematography by Peter Sova (who also did the cinematography to ""Lucky Number Slevin"" (2006) is great! The film editing by Kevin Greutert (who also did the film editing to the ""Saw"" movies) is great! The casting by Lindsey Hayes Kroeger, David Rapaport, (both who also did the casting to ""Vacancy"" (2007) & ""Prom Night"" (2008), Tracy Kilpatrick) is great! The production design by John D. Kretschmer is great! The art direction by Linwood Taylor is great! The set decoration by Missy Berent is great! The costume design by Susan Kaufmann is great!

For 174 minutes three nameless, faceless, masked characters work to pointlessly terrorize two equally faceless, (though not masked), characters. For no real reason, for no good purpose, for no real point beyond the ""booga-booga"" factor.
The victims are morons, who split up and separate at every opportunity. The bad ""guys"" apparently can walk through walls, or bend space and time at will. When they are not making huge clanking, banging, scaping noises, they are moving with the swiftness of gazelles and completely silently. There is just no plot, no tale to tell, no characters to care about and worst of all... no pay-off in the end.

The movie itself, as it was released in theatres, was excellent.  The script was well written, the acting was pretty good (the scene in which Liv Tyler was directed to be startled and scared when she noticed the smoke alarm has been picked up from the floor and placed on a chair was SO fake I laughed out loud when seeing for the first time-this did not win me any new friends at the theatre), and it was horrifying in a what-if-it-were-happening-to-you sort of way.

3524835,4,B001D2WU9I,"I will not focus too much on the plot within ""The Strangers""; rather I will focus on the atmosphere as well as other elements that make this film worth watching.

The basic premise of the plot revolves around two individuals, James and Kristen, a couple whose relationship is on rocky grounds when Kristen apparently turns James' proposal down.  They go to a remote cabin in the woods, where they were supposed to enjoy the weekend.  Their weekend doesn't go according to plan when a group of psychopaths decide to scare the living hell out of the couple.

Lighting:

The lack of light to protect the psychopaths is simple, yet effective.  Throughout the film, the viewer doesn't really get a sense of what these individuals look like.  When the audience witnesses one of these individuals, they are shrouded by darkness, effectively hiding their identities. The psychopaths are briefly seen throughout the woods running between trees, playing cat and mouse with the couple.  However, the scariest use of lighting used in the film occurs when the couple looks out their window to see one of the psychos simply standing there and watching them.  It is extremely creepy watching someone as they watch you.

Props:

The masks of the antagonists are also equally scary.  Ominous is probably the best word to describe the masks of the psychos.  Two of the individuals use a doll-like mask that is far from its original sweet and innocent intention.  The third individual uses a mournful, shroud-like mask that hides all emotions.

True Events:

The third part of this film that makes it horrifying; it is ""inspired by true events"".  I don't know about most people that use Amazon, but I live in the middle of the woods. My closest neighbor is roughly a half a mile away.  So when I found out that these events occur throughout the United States on a frequent basis, I began to psych myself out.  I had a feeling that if this could happen to these individuals, it could happen to me.

Pros:

* Creepy soundtrack
* Scary psychopaths
* Great lighting
* Based on true events

Cons:

* Poor plot development
* Sub-par acting
* The couple is ridiculously idiotic
* Shoddy ending

I give this film four out of five stars.",1351814400,2,2209,4.73753280839895
3524836,3,B001D2WU9I,"Other reviewers have done an excellent job describing this film and pointing out its faults. Here's my two cents: This film would have been vastly more terrifying and believable if there were one killer only--the adult male. Since he's wearing a mask, the connection with John Carpenter's Halloween is inescapable in my mind. Indeed, certain scenes could have been inspired by the 1978 classic. Somehow, making the killers a ""family"" takes away a lot of the dread. A girl, with or without a mask, doesn't make a very frightening killer to me--just a pathetic and terribly twisted child. The same goes for ""the mother."" Also, it would have been more frightening if the killers didn't speak at all--just like Michael Myers. That way, the viewer is forced to speculate. Providing any explanation about why they're terrorizing and killing just detracts from the horror the viewer has. Nevertheless, the indisputable creepy atmopshere of this film is not to be missed. Required viewing, then, even with strong reservations.",1351641600,,1018,5.13855421686747

3524845,2,B001D2WU9I,"The Strangers is a horror film that follows a young couple and their night as they are stalked and terrorized by several young adults (teens?); the film attempts to use high tension and loud noises to scare the audience but fails, in my opinion.

First, you should know the Strangers is a slow-burning horror film. I'm usually a big fan of slow-burners (like the Pact and Absentia) but this one isn't very effective. It starts off very slow, without any scares and limited dialogue and it starts to pick up after the 25 minute mark; considering the movie is about 1hr 20min without credits, I found that to be a bad thing. When it gets started, it's still slow but we do get some very intense scenes and creepy imagery, like the masked man watching from the background. But, most of the intense scenes last too long and the tension begins to fall the more you see the same scene; the tension/build up lasts so long, by the time the scare or creepy imagery occurs, you're no longer scared or paying attention. The loud noise scares were very predictable, but somewhat fun. And, as for the dialogue, I felt like they were whispering most of the time. Also, the pacing was terrible, even with its short runtime, I felt like this movie could've been cut to a shorter runtime and still be equally effective. The ending was decent, though.

Overall, The Stranger is paced poorly and isn't as scary as it could've been. The concept was decent, but the tension was too fabricated and the loud noise scares were too predictable. If you must see it, I'd recommend a rental.

The Strangers has strong violence and blood, no sex or nudity.",1349049600,,1627,4.584192439862543
3524846,3,B001D2WU9I,"You're not always safe at home. That's the lesson here. It's a simple story about home invasion as a trio of masked killers visit the summer house of James and Kristen; a couple romantically involved but very much unmarried. It's almost morning but still dark out. If there are neighbors within screaming range, they're probably sound asleep. So it's a terrific setting for a horror movie. The horror begins interestingly enough, but it stalls itself all the way to the end. The killers seem to realize they're in a horror movie, in other words, so they play around with their victims, appearing then disappearing suddenly, sometimes magically, in what seems like a collaborative effort to stall time. It's an effective technique at first. Loud door-knocks are scary at night. But the threat wears thin after a while.

James (Scott Speedman, ""Underworld"") and Kristen (Liv Tyler, ""Jersey Girl"") are a young couple coming back from a wedding reception and they decide to stay at a cabin that is shall we say out in the middle of nowhere. A few hours pass and some strange things start to happen, a girl comes to the door, they answer and after a bit she leaves, then the couple gets the feeling they're being watched. Turns out they are as three strangers have decided to target James and Kristen for reasons that are pretty simple, ""Cause you were home"" as the girl says later in the film (and was also in the trailer, for those who remember it).

What makes this movie scary is there isn't a whole lot of people in the cast, beyond the strangers, the couple there's maybe four other bit players, so the focus is really put on the strangers and how they simply are out to cause havoc on the couple. One of the best sequences was when a friend of James comes into the cabin and well meets an untimely end shall we say, but the tension keeps mounting even though most horror fans know whats coming way before it does.

I don't often get scared watching horror movies but this was one that got to me, probably cause while its of course just a movie, that this whole situation could actually happen.

You can give them one, two, or even a few of those, given the stress of their situation, but when it becomes obvious that they will always act against their best interests and willfully forfeit every advantage they have, you lose both sympathy and an emotional investment in what ensues.

In one of the ""bonus"" clips, the director talks about how this in an entirely new approach to horror movies.  I respectfully disagree, and submit that his claim only reveals his youth and ignorance of what has come before.  Fundamentally, this movie is one long string of horror movie cliches, taken to the point of near parody, without any of the tension that depends on realism.

3524859,5,B001D2WU9I,"The Strangers is a VERY frightening film. This is one of those movies that stays with you after you leave the theater. The plot is neither complex nor is it a new concept. This is a perfect example of how a film is executed (pun intended) is what's important. It's all in the timing and subtlety here. Strong acting and a great soundtrack also helps.

When we first meet the main characters they are in a very awkward and uncomfortable situation. She has just refused his marriage proposal and here they are alone together in a vacation home completely unsure of where they stand. This uncomfortable air sets the perfect tone and is only amplified when a strange girl knocks on the front door. The terror in this film comes from it's atmosphere and uncertainty. Though people creeping around in masks doesn't hurt either. The story keeps you at the edge of your seat and the tension starts small and builds to its disturbing climax.

Another aspect of this film that keeps you creeped out is that it feels very real. At no point does it become fantastical, this could very well have happened. Which is a point since the story is inspired by real events. This is much more psychological horror, my favorite, then it is boo, going to get you. Though there are a few nicely done jump scares that got me good.

If you want a film the gets under your skin, then this is the movie for you. It's the kind that has you up checking your car or home to make sure no one's there. It leaves you looking over your shoulder. The Strangers is a great ride that doesn't disappoint.

3524870,4,B001D2WU9I,"THE STRANGERS

Now the idea behind this film is really scary especially since it can really happen. In fact it is based on true events or at least something the director experienced or remembered from his childhood. You can say it is a rip off of the film ""Them"" [really good] all you want but I tend to believe what the director has to say and how he wrote this. This film was based on three different things it seems that lead to the director writing this.

The film is based on an incident that happened when writer/director Bryan Bertino was a kid. One day some random people knocked on his door and his sister answered, they asked for some one who did not live there. Turns out later he found out they went around knocking on doors and if there was no answer they broke in. Also the director has stated that the book ""Helter Skelter"" helped in the penning of this. But there is also a real crime that happened in the Sierra Nevada Mountains known as the Keddie Cabin Murders of 1981. That is a creepy real life crime you should read up on, very chilling stuff.

Any way the film follows a young couple who are having some romantic issues and are just returning home. After James leaves for a while some strangers show up at the door while Kristen is home alone. After asking for some one that isn't there they start to terrorize this poor girl. When James returns things heat up to an even more violent level as the strangers pick up the pace.

I have to say Liv Tyler really did an excellent  job here as she had the hardest role of all to play. I personally think she did a marvelous job portraying both an emotionally detached girlfriend to Jason and also a women being mentally tortured. As for Jason, Scott Speedman does a good job here as well but Liv is the show stealer. The strangers are creepy as they should be. Bryan Bertino did a good job here in my opinion as a first time filmmaker. This film does a good job building tension and using the right amount of atmosphere. The score is great as well and plays a big part here.

I had a good time with this one and would recommend it. I know that there are those who don't like it as much but I thought it was good. I say check it out because you may like it as well. Does it have problems, maybe, but that didn't hurt the film in my eyes. Rent it and check it out late one night, you not want to answer the door after that.",1322352000,2,2388,4.203056768558952
3524871,2,B001D2WU9I,"Starts off fairly creepy. By the time ""the strangers"" begin to show themselves though, it falls apart. The director only has a few tricks in his bag and he uses them ad nauseam as this film crawls its way through its second half.

Nothing makes much sense. You think these ""strangers"" must be ghosts or something, considering their ability to teleport and their apparent psychic abilities when it comes to tracking their victims and predicting their every move. But no, they are allegedly normal human beings. The logistics that would have to be involved in their plans are just...beyond belief. Unless they are aliens with advanced technologies and the director just decided not to tell us.

None of this is helped by the fact that our main characters are incredibly stupid, constantly finding reasons to separate that beggar belief. ""Yeah, some maniac just axed his way through the front doors, and these masked murderers are constantly teleporting in and out of our house at will anyway, but you stay here while I go out to the Ol Spooky Barn(tm) and see if the ol ham radio works"". That's not even an exaggeration. But to be fair, nothing these characters decided to do would work out as ""the strangers"" would simply teleport behind them.

Don't buy the hype about this film being old fashioned atmospheric ""psychological terror"". The scariest thing about his movie is the directors solemn conviction that he's actually achieving anything remotely scary while dragging you slowly, slowly, slowly through boring dreck.",1322265600,5,1521,5.003952569169961

3524874,5,B001D2WU9I,"The Strangers is one the most unsettling, harrowing, suspenseful, tense, nerve-wracking and vastly underrated horror/thriller films that I have ever seen. It takes plenty of time to allow the ever-building sense of dread to mount up until it becomes almost unbearable. I personally find this far more effective than the usual slasher type of horror film that mostly only revels in gory make-up effects and thus drowns the suspense. You know pretty much what is going to happen and it makes it predictable. In The Strangers, even the most ordinary things such as a country music song, a turntable, a car, a nice house and a fireplace can take on a real sense of menace. You know that something is wrong and are not sure just where the danger is going to come from or when it is going to strike. Once it really starts, it doesn't let up on the viewer until the end. A film like this tends to stay with me much longer than a slasher film. One of the most frightening aspects of The Strangers is that something of this nature could actually happen. It never stretches the believability to where you think to yourself, this just couldn't happen to me. Liv Tyler is marvelous as Kristen and she never fails to make her character realistic and sympathetic. There is quite a bit of violence of a pretty graphic nature in The Strangers, but the use of it is never at the expense of the suspense or the tension. You won't ever feel quite as safe in your own home again after seeing The Strangers. This is certainly not a film to watch alone in the house late at night.",1319414400,2,1558,4.48943661971831

However, here are a few pointers for watching: Turn up the AC in your house and put a chill in the room. Watch this film late at night. Watch it by yourself or with very few people. Watch it on a good size screen in surround sound with the volume up.

I watched and was held to the narrative, and kept thinking this is just another home-invasion, slasher film. I was wrong.  Director Bertino put together an attractive cast, and found a sound crew of absolute perfection. This is psychological horror done quite well, without the blood and gore. It also helps that Liv Tyler and Scott Speedman handled their roles very well. It may have moved a little too slowly, and the 911 call at the beginning doesn't make sense,  but it's a truly scary film. The final scene, with the Jesus freak kids, was clever.

3524877,1,B001D2WU9I,"Ok, now I've seen a lot of horror movies in my day, the best and the worst, enough so that I can tell exactly when the next ""jump-in-your-face"" scene is due to appear. I know all the memes, all the themes, etc. Even so, a finely-crafted psychological horror film will still hold my attention, and the best can still even make me jump. ""The Strangers"" ain't one of them.

(Spoilers to follow) This film has the ""creep"" factor, I'll give it that much. But the rest was a snooze-fest, not to mention ridiculous. Three people in masks creeping around the house, leaving cryptic messages on mirrors, etc., and the homeowners don't even notice?!?! ONE person might have managed to not be found, but THREE? And two full-grown adults working together can't defeat two girls and an asthmatic? Even when one of the homeowners has a gun? One would have thought that all that wheezing would have given the asthmatic away...next time, try bringing the inhaler! Cripes, even ""Paranormal Activity"" was better than that (another one I'm not all that taken with). The scariest thing in the whole mess was when the intruders gave their reason for intruding: ""Because you were home."" Now THAT'S creepy!

It distresses me, because ""The Strangers"" had the potential to be a true classic of the genre. Too bad it was all for naught.",1315353600,3,1310,4.741228070175438
3524878,3,B001D2WU9I,"The first two-thirds of this movie are incredibly creepy. There is great atmosphere, plenty of scares, and just overall chilliness. However, the last third of the movie allows the masked killers too much air time, thus losing their creepiness, and the pace of the thriller slows remarkably.

Liv Tyler and Scott Speedman are a couple that are spending a night in a remote vacation home after attending a wedding. Both are already on edge for a different reason: she just turned down his marriage proposal. It doesn't take long for weird events to begin, with the creeps and the scares right behind them, as Tyler's character is left alone for a somewhat brief time. The movie steps up from more atmospheric creepiness to a scarier cat and mouse game, as Speedman's character returns.

The last third again relies on Tyler, who did a very good acting job, and the scariest thing about this part of the movie is the what ifs...What if this really happened? What if this happened to me? The ending is definitely disturbing, not so much because of the movie, but, knowing that people do sick stuff like this is real life.

While I enjoy good old fashion scarey movies that rely on plot, characters, scores, shadows, etc, more than gore for no reason movies, I was overall disappointed in this film. Yes, the beginning started off great, very scary, but then the movie seemed to slow down and switch to the gore for no reason type of movie, yet, minus most of the gore.

There were several problems with this movie. First of all, the characters were dumb!! They made many of the old fashion cliche mistakes: splitting up, not using weapons appropriately, hurting themselves stupidly, etc. Also, I felt that the masked killers were on screen too long. To me, this made them seem like real people, as oppose to monsters, therefore the hunted couple really could have fought them off, if they even made any half attempt to. Also, there were a lot of ""now they're here...now they're gone"" moments. If these are suppose to be real people (the whole basis of the major scare factor of this movie), and not ghosts, or Jason, Mike Myers, etc types, then they shouldn't be allowed to enter and exit rooms totally impossibly, and disappear in a second.

Overall, I would say that anyone who enjoys a quieter, more old fashion type of thriller (as oppose to Saw and the like) would probably enjoy most of this movie. I believe that the first two-thirds of this movie are good enough to enjoy and watch the whole thing. If all you like are very heavily bloody, gore-fest films or you hate it when a movie's ending doesn't live up to the beginning, then you should skip this one. You don't need to watch this movie to make you contemplate what is really scarey: someone randomly hunting you down for no apparent reason, other than their own sick amusement.",1315094400,,2838,4.668
3524879,5,B001D2WU9I,"If you're looking to be scared, 'The Strangers' will to do the trick and then some.

I was a little worried, to be honest. Based on the premise and early looks at the trailer, it had the look of yet another ""torture porn"" story, of which there are already plenty. Fortunately, 'The Strangers' rises above this and sets out to create something far more subtle, but no less gripping.

'The Strangers' is a no-frills suspense film. The premise is pretty basic: Liv Tyler and Scott Speedman play a couple on the rocks, spending the night together in a secluded home. From the beginning, there's a strong sense of isolation and a feeling of sadness that pervades the movie. The uneasiness grows, steadily and unstoppably, as it becomes apparent that they're not the only ones out there...and the strangers that slowly encroach on them do not have good intentions.  Not at all.

There's a little backstory here, mostly telling us what's going on between the two main characters, but the main thrust of the story is the growing presence of the strangers. It's done effectively, at first mostly with sound - a knock on the door, a whispered voice, a disturbed wind chime on the back porch. Eventually we see them, often lurking in the background, wearing blank masks of burlap or creepy doll faces. The pace is steady - implacable and insistent and undeniable.

The smartest thing about 'The Strangers' is how it balances what is seen and what is unseen. It doesn't rely on gore or ""gotcha"" moments for its scares. Instead, it captures the feeling of isolation and the unknown - the feeling of being alone and afraid of something you can't see - and builds on it effectively. The ending  is shocking and brutal yet not overdone. Like the rest of the film, it leaves much to the imagination of the viewer, where truly the worst can happen.

Fear is a powerful force, but truly expressing it in a visual medium (like film) is tough. If too much is explained or too much is shown, what at first seemed fearsome now becomes tame. At some point, you have to trust the viewer to fill in the blanks of what you don't show them. A movie that can do that, and do it well, is the one that truly captures the heart of fear. Not many live up to that idea.

'The Strangers' rides the razor's edge of known and unknown, seen and unseen, and in so doing creates something rare: a truly frightening film.",1310688000,5,2380,4.557377049180328

The silence and creepy possibilities blew my mind.

My thoughts:

- Environment was very eerie. Silence was the constant, with little cracks, sounds, music, wind, and everything all magnified even more.

- character's decision making is suspect. Such as going outside alone, and leaving your spouse alone was poor decision making. It wouldn't happen in the real world.

- Movie felt fresh. It didn't need zombies or chainsaws to create fear. The raw vibe of the scenes are haunting

Even the beginning is disturbing, with the 911 phone call, and, well I don't wanna give away too much, but it really sets the tone for the rest of the film. It starts off quiet, dramatic, and kinda creepy, and right when the girl in the mask asks ""Is Tamara home?"", you know some scary stuff is gonna go down. One of the most subtle creepy scenes is when the guy in the mask (the one on the cover) has his head peeking out of the dark hallway. That still creeps me out. That same phrase repeating over and over on that phonograph when it gets knocked over is also still haunting. The film gets more and more intense and finally it becomes big on terror without becoming extremely loud, except for the screams. Later, you're on the edge of your seat, especially when it passes the 1 hour mark. The ending is also disturbing. ""The Strangers"" haunts you long after you see it.

I will admit, making thriller and horror movies with cell phones nowadays is not easy. I've seen better written and scarier movies out there but this did keep me in suspense.  However, the director made a few mistakes in the film, For one, in one scene, when the guys friend comes into the house and becomes suspicious, he never yells his name, rather he silently seems shelle-shocked and walks to see who's here and then mistakenly,  his friends shoots and kills him as he enter the doorway.. Normally in real life, its natural to yell for somones name to see if anybody is home. By the couple hearing his voiced, they would of recognized him and would of saved his life...

 The second mistake was the ending, first of all, the movie is about 1:18 min long (blu-ray not worth more than 10.00) and the ending left you too wonder if the 3 masked strangers will ever get caught. Since the girlfriend survived the stab wounds,  i would of tweaked the ending and drag it 20-30 min longer, those extra minutes would been directed toward hunting down the criminals and maybe be forced into a gun battle with police where the criminals finally die.",1297296000,,1266,4.510917030567685

I won't spoil the movie for you, but think of it as just a meat & potatoes scary movie, not much in special effects, not much dialogue, in fact the ""bad guys"" don't even speak, which adds to the uncomfortable mood & the evil unsettling feeling you get watching this..It sort of dehumanizes the villains although you are perfectly aware that they are human, you almost don't see them as such bc they don't talk.  They are simply ""Strangers"" as the movie's title states..

It doesn't mean they have to use any elements of what inspired them...they were just inspired by some incident.

So the murder behind Cain and Abel in Genesis could've ""inspired"" THE STRANGERS: somebody did something bad to somebody else.

And not that you ever find out why or who the bad guys really are or why we're submitting ourselves to this ordeal.  Call me fussy, but I like to know what's going on in my movies.  I like to know why people do what they do.

This isn't a terrible movie.  It's well-crafted...but I knew as much at the end as I did when I started it.  It's all style, no substance.

This is one of those movies where the victims' implausibly stupid behavior is the only thing that keeps them from escaping before the third act.  Even worse, the killers lazily toy with the victims instead of offing them when the opportunity arises.  And there is a preposterous denouement that makes the film even less satisfying.

3524905,1,B001D2WU9I,"Mr. Bertino, born in 1977,needs alot more research and practice in how to direct a smart, suspense driven horror-film.
His 2008 feature, The Strangers, based on random terror and senseless, brutal violence (always a fascinating and chilling idea)unfortunately, fails to deliver any menace.
This tale was assembled from bits of three documented real life random-violence legends,not on one single horrific event...and it still doesn't work.
Liz Tyler and Scott Speedman play the movie-star-perfect/beautiful-young-couple indulging in some romance in an isolated vacation house in the woods (fabulously decorated in mid-century vintage-chic)who are terrorized, brutalized (and murdered) for no apparent reason by three masked, creepy characters (whose real faces are never revealed).
With no back story whatsoever this film provides no satisfying tension at all....and we have seen those masks too many times before and terrorizing beautiful people who live an advantaged life is old news as well.
I realize it's almost impossible to find a new way to stage cinematic horror in the 21st century, every ""scary"" idea has been played out too many times over...but(fortunately!) there's always a genius out there who does!
The art direction and set design of Mr. Bertino's  film outshines any real dread. The few sudden jolts are predictable and cheap...but, not exactly scary.
In the hands of any one of these masters, Spielberg(born '46),Demme (born '44), Sena (born '49) and the youngest master, Fincher (born '62) this same story
(or ANY story) could have sent real chills....and thrills.
My Bertino was only about 6 years old when Spielberg made DUAL, a clear indication of his budding genius at staging (GORE FREE!) suspense and terror....way back in 1971....and who can ever forget the brilliant, frightening CUJO...and that dog scared the C@#$ out of everyone, without wearing a silly Mask!",1279324800,2,1892,5.4573378839590445

After they paid for her to be in this film, they didn't have any money to pay the electric bill as most of the movie is shot in the dark. Scott proposes to Liv and has a nice evening set in a secluded home (one nicer looking than my dump). The only problem for Scott is that Liv said ""No,"" she is not ready, but she is still his gf and sex is still on the table.

Rather than be happy, like most males, Scott mopes about and plays lousy tear jerkers. At this point I am hoping the intruders would come in and kill him, but they don't. The movie drags on. Scott leaves Liv, who is now subjected to people banging on the outside walls as we get to see her slither around in the dark all in a panic...no phone, no gun, just a kitchen knife. This is the intense horror that I didn't feel.

3524909,2,B001D2WU9I,"When I first saw the trailer for The Strangers, I was stunned. Everything was done perfectly. For once, a trailer made me want to see a movie, despite knowing nothing else about it, and that rarely happens for me. The 3 strangers standing there, watching the couple was a chilling image, because you knew something really awful was going to happen. And the movie does almost match the rad-ness of the trailer, until it hits the halfway mark. Yes, this was another horror movie ruined by the middle mark, and ruined even more by a cheap ending and being branded with the 'UNRATED' label, despite it not being much longer than the standard version, and the two being nearly identical.

Basic story: a young couple end up stranded in a secluded country home at night after their relationship is pretty much over (right after leaving a wedding no less). They try to make it through the night after three strangers begin to lurk around the home, and one even gets inside, unnoticed until it's too late. The former lovers now have to survive, but with seemingly no one else around to help them, and without much to fight off the attackers.

'not much of an original plot, but it's how the movie's presented that makes it work. Liv Tyler and Scott Speedman have excellent chemistry together and their characters make decisions that most people would in the same situation. For the most part, they don't make cliche horror movie choices. One of the first things they do to guard themselves is back off into a corner of one room while armed and wait for someone to come at them. The tension is incredible during this scene, and it's one that I could watch a few more times and still get the same feeling I had the first time I saw it. Because of where they are, the couple can't do a whole lot, especially since the home they're in doesn't have much to work with. Whenever they're able to get away for a few minutes, they try their best wherever they are, be it a shed, kitchen, or even a by a car. Even when they did make some kind of dumb choices, they weren't that bad. Why not just call the police? 'hard to do when you've got 3 people who planned out this attack and made sure you wouldn't be able to before the real fun starts.

But about halfway through the movie, things get pretty boring. Running from x location to x location, hiding for x minutes, the tension that the first half had ends up being killed because they overdo it. Despite being on the edge of my seat early on, I was about ready to fall asleep once they left the house and tried their luck outside for a while. ...even typing that just now I yawned. And the ending is nothing short of cheap. I'd describe it without ruining anything, but it's hard to because of how basic the 'scare' was they were going for. Where the final scare can be good in movies like [REC], this one has the kind of lame ending that plagued another movie that could've been good- Paranormal Activity. It sucks too because this movie was going somewhere, but it almost seems like they got a new writer for the second half of the script, or somehow ran out of ideas. All that build up for nothing?? Come on guys. This could've been a modern classic!

One more thing that hampers the experience is the picture quality. Watching this on a good tv won't do much because of the 'muddy' effect the picture has. If it was done for style, fine, but outside shots look pretty bad, and with everything taking place at night, it's hard to see if there really is anyone behind someone or not. The audio's pretty good at least, and if you have a good sound system, crank that baby up. Whenever the house makes a sound, you'll hear it, from the smallest creak to the faintest footstep.

Special features? None really. You get 2 deleted scenes that were deleted for a reason, and a decent featurette that covers a lot of the production of the movie. It's informative, but nothing that the average horror fan will get much out of unless they're interested in making their own movies.

Even with the huge problems, The Strangers was better than most of the other horror movies that came out that same year. It's just a shame that before it's over, I didn't care any more. And I can't stress how lame the ending was. I can't help but wonder if there was an alternate ending, one that wouldn't have killed the movie.",1274227200,2,4337,4.442211055276382

3524912,3,B001D2WU9I,"The Strangers (Bryan Bertino, 2008)

I know it's not a rational thing to consider where The Strangers is concerned, given that the movie was written in the early 2000s (according to IMDB, it was written two years before the release of Ils, to which it is often compared; that would put the writing date at 2003), but I kept thinking to myself that this is basically a remake of Funny Games that was released in the same year as Haneke remade his own movie for an American audience. Yes, there are some surface differences between the movies (and I do mean surface, e.g. the terrorists in this movie wear masks, where Haneke's don't), but the movie gives so many nods to Funny Games that it can't be a coincidence. I should probably give Bertino props for the subtlety of some of those nods (for example, the use of dissonant music that doesn't fit with the rest of the soundtrack; Haneke drops Boredoms into the main title of his 1998 flick, while Bertino tosses in a wonderful bit of Joanna Newsom), but it kept bringing home the similarity underlying the two movies. I can't imagine either Bertino or Haneke knew they would be releasing their two films so closely together, and it's not like this sort of Hollywood anti-magic doesn't happen on a regular basis (think Red Planet and Mission to Mars being released a month or so apart in 2000, for example), but the whole time I was watching this movie, fairly or not, I was comparing it not to Ils, but to the 1998 version of Funny Games. (I haven't seen Haneke's 2008 remake yet.)

If you've seen Funny Games, the plot of this flick will be very familiar to you; a couple, James (Underworld's Scott Speedman) and Kristen (The Lord of the Rings' Liv Tyler), are in their remote vacation house when they are terrorized by a band of thugs (supermodel Gemma Ward, Glory Road's Kip Weeks, and Dirty Sexy Money's Laura Margolis). The rules of this game seem simple enough: get out of the house or die.

It's not a bad movie, especially the first half; Bertino understands, as few American directors in the Hollywood machine do, that atmosphere and character are two of the key components you need to work with if you're going to scare the living daylights out of your audience. And the first half of this movie does achieve fat stacks of scary, as the terrorists don't actually do anything other than stuff that can still be (kind of) construed as harmless. (This is the major way in which the movie does remind me of Ils; that's one of those movies where I was wondering whether anything was actually going to happen right up until it did.) Once the terrorists ratchet up the terror, however, Bertino himself seems to lose his way, and the movie drives straight into clich&eacute; territory on one too many occasions. In the film's defense, Bertino does know how to take those clich&eacute;s and make them effective in the scope of his film. Yes, every horror movie has that scene with the killer just suddenly appearing in the background without the characters noticing, and the disappearing again, but I haven't seen it done this effectively in a while. And I give Bertino major points for the terrorists' answer to Kristen's repeated ""why are you here?"" imprecation. (If you don't know the answer yet, I won't spoil it for you, but I think it's the worst-kept secret about this movie.) Yes, it's another of the movie's possibly-unconscious nods to Funny Games, but it still hasn't been used enough to not have power.

A couple more deviations from the norm and this could have been one of the best horror movies of the decade. As it is, it's still worth checking out, but it's ultimately empty calories, especially if you're an aficionado of this kind of film. ** ",1260403200,,3714,4.646879756468797

3524914,4,B001D2WU9I,"The Strangers reminds me of the basic horror movie, and that's a good thing.  Think of the original Halloween from 1979.  Imagine 2 people intending to enjoy a romantic evening in a home alone, far from civilization in the countryside.

It appears to sample other horror movies, including the ""closet scene"" from Friday the 13th (the original 1980 version), and elements of The Shining (also from 1980).  There is a fair amount of blood and gore, but not what is commonly seen in most modern horror movies.

I don't know the story this movie is based on but it is quite interesting story never the less. You can easily skip the first twenty minutes because nothing really happens and it's quite boring. Then a knock at the door with a girl is looking for her friend at 4 am in the morning; That might seem strange but the fact that the house the couple is staying on a is a deserted road with no other houses in what appears to be miles. She turns away and thats when the good stuff hits, well sort of. Three masked intruders do all sorts of stuff to mess with this girl and her boyfriend comes back after getting a frantic call. One thing I thought was funny was his beautiful car was destoryed and he didn't seem to care one bit about it. The three intruders disappear on and off, almost acting like ghosts and playing tricks on the couple. The movie is only an hour and twenty eight minutes (unrated edition) and it is pretty well paced but some things just don't add up. A unique part of the film is there is little speaking and it relys heavily on sounds. Expect for the girl that shows up at the door, you never see the rest of the killers faces. The chilling answer to way they did this was because they were home. I don't know if it's a real story or not, the speical features include a making of documentary. I wish they would have added a feature about where this story is based on.

In fact it's horror ""fans"" like this that are the reason that the horror film genre is so in the dumps. As long as blood, gore and torn limbs are what rakes in the money- thanks to the fans I just mentioned- then we will get more of the same and less TRUE scary stuff like ""The Strangers"", which is a shame.

The film was rich in atmosphere. The acting was good, the villains were compelling and the director did a masterful job keeping the suspense taught without resorting to cliche's like things suddenly and constantly jumping out at you, hordes of insects, gore or teens having sex. I also felt that the inherent improbabilities in the story were well ironed out and made believable. They tried to leave, but couldn't. They tried to call for help, but couldn't. They tried to fight back, but couldn't find an enemy to fight.

3524931,3,B001D2WU9I,"Liv Tyler (""Lord of the Rings"", ""Jersey Girl"") and Scott Speedman (""Underworld"") play a couple with a dissolving relationship spending the night in a vacation home. Claiming to be `inspired by true events', it's not difficult to believe. The story is a rehash of possibly every slasher film from the seventies. The real star here is the sound effects. The viewer is initially spooked by loud knockings on doors and other things that `go bump in the night'. After ten minutes, it becomes wearisome and nearly the entire film is a series of sound effects to fill in the voids. This is particularly annoying if you have surround sound.

The plot is remarkably static and contrived. A portly man and two women wearing masks besiege the couple throughout the night. They appear and disappear, seeming to just enjoy terrorizing the couple. But this couple does all the typical `do not go there' and `do not do that' stuff you've seen before. Why would the guy leave his girlfriend alone in the house to get cigarettes with this going on? Why would the gal leave the house and run in the dark to the barn to try and make a call? How could the guy claim to not know how to work a shotgun and then make a pinpoint perfect hit? Thankfully, director Bryan Bertino keeps the gore to a minimum until the end. However, even that has been done before.

Problem?  Everyone's a moron.

If you're a home intruder and the people at home have a gun, you're not going to keep attacking.  No you're going to run the **** away and go to some other house some other night.  If you're the guy being intruded upon and are sitting in the corner one night with a gun you're not going to go outside and play Elmer Fudd.  No, you're going to sit in that corner and stay awake until morning when the suburb will be active.  If you're the intruder watching the guy play Elmer Fudd with a shotgun you're not going to bull-rush him and succeed.  No, you're going to be blown the **** away.  And if you're some guy who just had his windshield smashed before your eyes and sees signs of an obvious break-in you're not going to quietly sneak inside to investigate.  No, you're going to drive away and call the cops.

The suspension of disbelief is just too much in this film.  It's a battle of who wants to be killed more and who's more inept at taking an advantage.  And when a victor emerges it's hard to care, not only because all the characters are boring as cardboard, but because they just succeeded winning the Darwin Award of the night in a rather fierce competition.",1243814400,85,1467,4.381481481481481

Maybe this is accidental, but the film's story looks very familiar - which reminds us of ""Funny Games"" ""Vacancy"" and of course, David Moreau and Xavier Palud's French thriller ""Them"" - but what disappointed me is not the similarity in story. It is something different.

The problem with this film is that most scares are clichd. Despite its promising atmospheric opening scenes, the film largely depends on old tricks such as sudden appearance (and disappearance) of something or someone, big banging noises, useless cell phones and cars, and yes, a wardrobe. Please no more wardrobe. Even the final act (that is obviously trying to shock us) looks predictable.

""The Strangers"" is the first film by Bryan Bertino who also wrote the script. He may not be the most innovative writer, but it is certain he can direct. There is one tense scene in the middle of the film, which involves Glenn Howerton's character, and Peter Sova's dark, brooding photography and tomandandy's score is also effective.

While 2008's ""Funny Games"" was easily one of the most ""intruders slaughtering innocent homedwellers"" sorts of movie, this takes it up another level, only because everything that happens here is plausible, and for that reason alone, bonechilling.

Much has been made of Liv Tylers' performance, and the hype is right. She is beautifully cast and performs her role with great dignity, although some may wonder how hiding in a closet could be termed 'acting'. Unbeknowest to most, this film also marks the debut of supermodel Gemma Ward (in the roll of 'Dollface') but we never really get to see her face throughout. ""The Strangers"" may have no motive or real direction except to 'finish off' the young couple, but the movies' brilliance is in how it prolongs their agony and make things worse. This is not a pretty picture, things seem only 'all too real', and you may not be able to watch certain segments.

3524940,4,B001D2WU9I,"If you are looking for a mindless horror film that will shake you to your core and scare the pants off of you, then `The Strangers' is right up your ally.  The film seriously had me shaking in my bed sheets and I actually lost a lot of sleep last night because of this movie, so I can honestly say that the scare factor here is very high.  Sadly, it doesn't back up those goods with anything remotely intelligent.  The big reveal at the end is rather disappointing, but I won't spoil it (although I've noticed that a few reviewers already have).

The film opens with two beautiful people driving to a cabin in the woods.  Clich, I know.  That beautiful couple is Liv Tyler and Scott Speedman, who play Kristin and James.  They are already in sour moods beings that James just proposed to Kristen, who turned him down.  The cabin, which belongs to James's parents, is not really an ideal location now, beings that it has been decorated with flowers and stocked with champagne in celebration of the proposal.  Almost immediately after arriving though, their focus is shifted when a strange young woman knocks on the front door.  She's looking for someone who doesn't live there.  The couple shrugs off the incident and decides to move on with the evening, but when James ventures out for cigarettes things get serious.  The knocking returns, and soon Kristen realizes that their evening is going to be far from pleasant, and it's not because of the proposal.

I was very impressed with Bertino's direction of this film.  The scares provided are not your typical gory massacres, but they are wisely constructed thrills delivered by the right music, the right lighting and the right focus, and by focus I mean `camera focus', as in a masked man resting out of focus at the far end of the frame.

I'm getting chills just thinking about it.

The films first half is extremely successful in getting under your skin.  With Kristen alone in the house and the masked people outside your skin starts to crawl with genuine terror.  When James gets back things start to pick up pace, which kills the creepy a little bit, for a while at least.  Once Kristen is left on her own again though, things return back to their original terror and we are taken by storm with genuine bouts of fear.  This is a true testament to Liv Tyler's grasp of the genre.  She understands how to register pure terror on her face without delving into clich or even campy reactions.  She is petrified, and it shows.

Like I said, the ending is a disappointment.  We are waiting for this huge reveal and when it comes it fails to really make a dent.  I seriously was thinking ""this is it?""  I really was expecting something a little more, what's the word, powerful.  I've seen this same `ending' before, but with a little more thought behind it, so without that extra 'thought' this ending feels rather lazy.  So, in closing, the thrills are there but the brains are not.  Sometimes we just need a little scare.  If that's the case, dig into this one.  If you want something a little more intelligent then look elsewhere.",1241395200,4,3082,4.589743589743589

The next is the blood pool. Someone is shot in the head, and as they lay on the floor, a huge pool runs out onto the floor, but it later shots the pool is either nonexistent or remarkably smaller. At one point Liv is dragged by the body and down the hall, clearly showing her head dragging on the floor and not leaving a trail, but later there is a blood trail from her hair on the floor.
The male lead has blood on his hand an wipes it on his white shirt, for the next 20 minutes, the stain changes shape and location on his shirt.
Liv hides in a closet and is attacked through the slats and a number of slats are damaged. In fact the door is nearly destroyed, but when Liv emerges from the closet, only two slats are gone.

I think the whole movie could have been scarier if the murderers had remained more in the shadows like in the beginning when you could barely see the bagged head murderer standing behind Liv. And the goofs weren't so obvious.",1241308800,,1403,4.250936329588015

So what MADE the Strangers such a good scary movie?  How about the great acting from *all* the characters (the good and bad guys!)

Right from the very beginning I thought the movie would be worth my time because of the slow build-up of character development and storyline.  The man and woman obviously aren't going through the best of times as far as their relationship is concerned.

The thing that made the movie so much of a quality suspense was the way the bad guys were actually IN the house while the man and woman were being terrorized, but the man and woman didn't realize it at first.  The bad guys were constantly making noises in the house, writing words on the walls, and finding ways to mess with the people (and driving them insane while doing so).

Imagine looking outside a window and notice someone standing in your yard, looking directly at you?  Something like that happens here.  Absolutely scary.

So yes, this movie did its job, and did it fairly well, but I've seen movies that disturbed me in a way that made me wonder just how sick human beings can be if pushed far enough.  The Strangers isn't on *that* level of fear.",1241308800,3,1314,4.5021097046413505
3524944,5,B001D2WU9I,"Take a remote location, a handful of actors, a dark night, and you have a film that can go a number of ways: from slasher to scary to awful.

This movie is scary. It makes you jump and doesn't let up until the end.

Liv Tyler and Scott Speedman return to their remote retreat after a wedding. He has just proposed to her and been rejected. It's an inauspicious start to the night, though it's 4:00 am so, morning would be more apt. Their ""make up make out"" is interrupted by a knock at the door.

Thereafter, they are under siege by a trio of strangers who toy with them throughout the night. There are moments of sheer terror. A scene in which Liv Tyler is getting a drink, the camera pans and we see a hooded man watching her from inside the home, sets the tone and keeps it in overdrive. Even when you're expecting a shock you're shocked.

The acting is superb. Liv Tyler can look scared - really scared - when she needs to. Scott Speedman is just as convincing in his own way. The rest of the cast just needs to be there to keep the action going and they do a great job of it.

I noted in a couple of reviews that people thought one or two things far-fetched, such as when a friend arrives and sees the carnage. Rather than leave, he enters the house and...

But I think you can forgive those smaller slip-ups because the rest is quite believable and the ending is exactly as it should be. As day breaks and the couple are sitting tied to chairs they ask ""why are you doing this"". The answer is a perfect footnote to so much random violence one hears about today.

The story is supposedly based on true events. How much I don't know, but I think one of the scarier aspects of the film is that is is plausible. It's not a dream. There are no vampires. It's a group of psychos out to terrorize a couple.

They end up terrorizing the viewer too. I think much of it has to do the incredible direction and an absence of special effects and ""in your face"" gore that so many people accept as ""horror"" these days. This movie relies as much on perception and what you don't see and then scares you to death at precisely the right time.

To be scared by this movie you have to put yourself in the place of Liv Tyler. It's terrifying because she's all alone. There's no one around for miles. And these people are torturing her for no apparent reason. They just play games with her. Throwing mud against the window. Writing hello from the inside of the doors.

It's not the masks that are scary. Although when he is waiting for her to pull the curtain back.... man. Haha. What makes this movie scary is that fact that she is completely defenseless against these people. They know that and so does she. She can't lock herself in the house because obviously they can gain access anytime they want. They just toy with her. And they draw the kill out. They don't come right and kill her.

3524958,3,B001D2WU9I,"In the Director's Commentary on this DVD, Bryan Bertino makes the distinction between ""terror"" and ""horror,"" and categorizes ""The Strangers"" firmly in the former genre. That set me thinking, ""What's the difference?""

I suppose ""horror"" carries a connotation of some supernatural entity doing the menacing. Whereas ""terror"" is perpetrated strictly by worldly beings. If that is indeed the difference, then yes, this movie is definitely terror. It plays into one of our primal fears about having our homes, our sanctuaries invaded by very real humans, but humans with a psychopathic bent, humans willing to casually commit the most horrible crimes - just for fun. That's what this movie is about. ""The Strangers"" are strange, not in the sense of being from some other plane or planet - but even more horrifyingly, because while they are physically human, they are alien to the human spirit.

This movie has a few problems delivering the chills on this score. The picture projected on my screen was so murky, that sometimes the action was almost just a smudge. I know a Director would want to keep things indistinct to heighten suspense - to keep us guessing what is lurking in those shadows behind the curtains, in the other room. But the obscurantism of ""The Strangers"" often seems as if it might be due more to a low budget and poor production values than to intentional effect.

Then I don't think the movie allows us to get to know the threatened couple enough to sufficiently care about them. There seemed to be some vitally missing back-story for them. In fact, the beginning of the movie made me feel as if my DVD might be defective, as if it was missing a few scenes. I got so distracted trying to figure out what sort of quarrel might be behind the couple's initial strained silence and disaffection - that the growing menace which is the point of the film was somewhat diluted for me.

Nevertheless, this is a scary movie - good for raising goosebumps, and maybe some deeper issues about people's capacity for evil. Then if you can stomach the genre, you might want to check out ""Funny Games"" - another movie about brutal home invaders. But get the German-language original.",1233532800,,2182,4.810666666666667
3524959,5,B001D2WU9I,"Intense.  That is the best word to describe this movie.

A seemingly innocuous beginning lulls the audience into what is going on.  A little mystery lingers and is resolved through a flashback to hours before.  But as soon as we learn why this couple is so miserable and separate from each other, bizarre occurrences begin and distract the audience's focus.

A knock at the door, ""Is Tamara home?"" and suddenly the movie leaves the banal conflict between this couple and eases into a terrifying mystery of a completely different sort.  Bumps in the night and then some make this film intense.  You will be holding your breath in anticipation of what will happen next....

The Strangers thankfully falls into neither category, taking the best parts of what really makes a horror movie a horror movie; The Strangers stars Liv Tyler and Scott Speedman as a couple with some troubles spending the night in an isolated cabin after a wedding.  Things start to get rather creepy however when three masked assailants make their presence known, violently escalating towards a riveting, frightening, and incredibly unsettling climax.  Director Bryan Birtino mixes old school fright elements with an unnerving score, adding to the uber-creepy atmosphere, and Tyler and Speedman are surprisingly impressive as well in the leads.

3524962,1,B001D2WU9I,"That's what this unbelievably low quality, zero imagination, miserably boring flick must be.. otherwise how would you explain a couple armed with two cellphones, a shotgun and plenty of shells and a working car to fall victim of an overweight man and two girlies? Liv, Liv Taylor, how can you lower yourself with this movie after such a beautiful movie like Lord of the Rings? You definitely need a new agent..
She manages to: 1) cut one of her hands almost in half 2) twist her ankle totally disabling one of her legs  and all without any of the bad guys touching her. Her companion is not much better.. 1) he keeps leaving her alone under the creepiest circumstances for important business like driving to buy her cigarettes 2)instead of shooting the attackers at will with his shotgun he finds nothing better to do than shoot a visiting friend in the head as soon as he enters the door (a lucky shot just in the face for someone who admits he does not even know how to charge a shotgun). And that's all without any help from the bad guys! :P
One keeps hoping almost till the end that something brilliant will save the movie and make it actually look like it has a plot.. surely the bad guys must have something supernatural since they move around without a sound like untouchable ghosts and appear and disappear inside and outside of the house at will.. surely they must have a deep connection with the past of the couple.. but no, it goes on as dumbly as possible till the end where an overweight panting man and two girlies finally put the couple ( and all the viewers ) out of their misery by stabbing them to death and call it a night.
But it's a happy ending anyhow.. that hopeless couple and their friend would have soon and inevitably removed themselves from the species. Only, not letting them do it spontaneously is robbing them of their well deserved Darwin Award..

Purchased on a whim prior to Halloween 08, I sat down one night expecting another badly written, terribly acted scary movie (think One Missed Call or The Messengers). Within the first hour I found myself at the edge of the couch, peeking between fingers to see what would happen next. The Strangers is probably the first truly scary movie produced in years and was so terrifying I spent the night sleepless wondering if anyone was creeping around the house. Liv Tyler, making her way back into the public spotlight, is wonderful in the role of a woman fighting with her boyfriend alone in a creepy summer home. The catch, it's winter and the neighborhood is greatly deserted. The cast consists mainly of five people, three of which never show their faces.

3524966,3,B001D2WU9I,"This is a good little chiller--despite giant holes in the plot and a heroine who is so helpless and fragile that she should be in a nursing home. The story is a classic setting for fear and mayhem: an isolated house out in the woods where a couple is terrorized by mysterious forces.

The first time you hear the sudden knocking on the door, you experience a sense of dread. Not many people have a visitor knocking on their door at 3 or 4 in the morning. When the visitor turns out to be a total stranger, asking a strange question, the suspense mounts. But what does Scott Speedman, the husband, do? He moseys out to his car for a drive, or is it to buy some cigarettes. Anyway, his gentle, child-like bride, liv Tyler is left alone and another visitor knocks on the door. Throughout this movie, the actress portrays a woman who is so pathetically a ""Daddy's Girl,"" that she can't function on her own. She cringes and cowers and when she gets her husband on the phone, she doesn't sound very scared. She just tells him to hurry home. Does she check the windows and doors to see if they're locked? Does she gather around her an arsenal of possible weapons to use--like knives, screw drivers, heavy plates, pots, etc. She does none of these things.

She just sits and nervously waits for her man to come back to protect her. When the violence escalates, she retreats even more into child-like behavior, not even bothering to help out her poor husband who is being beaten up and tortured. She just screams and wails and hides out.  One scene is unbelievably illogical: her husband has made his way to the garage while the killers are all around. And what does his wife do? She just sits on the backsteps of the house, her head resting on her knees, exposed to the killers. When she does FINALLY grab a knife for defense, it's the smallest one in her kitchen. I would have found the biggest one to protect myself. And when a buddy of her husband finally comes to visit them, the couple have barricaded themselves in a room. The buddy doesn't even say anything, like, ""Hey, anybody around?"" He just walks into the darkened house with destroyed furniture everywhere and something really bad happens to him. The wife has another chance to shriek and gibber and wail, alerting the killers to their hideout.

Despite these weaknesses, this movie proves that you can still make an effective thriller on a low budget without l00 million dollars worth of special effects or paying some actor $25 million to show his face for the camera. If they could have made the wife figure a feisty, realistic woman of 2008, this flick could have been even better. Maybe in the sequel that's being planned, we'll have a female who knows when it's time to fight back and stop looking for her ""man"" to protect her.",1230595200,,2788,4.536779324055666

You can have your Saws, your Hostels, your Screams - I'll take this movie over all those put together because it's based on real events and it makes you identify with the characters by conveying their helpless situation far better than the other films I mentioned, making you realize that you could find yourself in the same situation - I guess I'm simply saying this movie connects with what truly scares people on a personal level.  I haven't read the negative reviews here but it's too bad they didn't get this film - I guess it's too psychological and not enough of a mindless slasher film for them?

Spoilers below:
 First, when the friend shows up and has his windshield hit AND sees a friend's house in a violent disarray, what does he do, he walks in silently. Some claim he did it so the bad guys wouldn't know he is there, but since they threw something through his windshield I'd have to say they DO know he is there. Then on top of those clues he doesn't even call the police or his friends, please! (You don't have to be a Navy Seal to do that)
 Second, after everything that happens to Liv Tyler, she crawls to the barn and after literally looking at the various weapons at her disposal, what does she do? She decides to turn her back to the only entrance to her safe haven and try to call for help on a CB. Most people would have grabbed the 2 scythes (?) next to the empty ax spot and shut the barn door and tried to call for help. Personally I would have grabbed every possible weapon and had them all over my body just in case, hell at the very least hide one weapon in your clothing.",1230249600,15,1179,4.1173913043478265

When they walk, they don't make the sounds of foot steps, they can appear and disappear whenever they want, they can see perfectly fine out of those masks, and they move at lightening speed.

The other problem I had with the movie is the people don't act like real people. When Mike shows up and his car gets it's windshield mashed and he notices that the house has been broken into, why doesn't he call the police? Why does he go into the house alone instead of driving for help? Why do the two little boys go into the house at the end and have no reaction to the dead bodies?

It's things like that, that make horror movies like this frustrating and therefore unenjoyable overall.

3524971,1,B001D2WU9I,"The two leads are very good. The suspense is really well set up at the start. The stranger at the door that early morning is really well set up. I had come to care about the husband and wife, wanting to know what the sadness was about. The way the strangers start breaking into their home and their lives is really well set up. And when the horrors start starting to happen, this too is really well set up.

But along about now, I started thinking well this really well set up film is seeming to be a series of its really being well set up. The torture scene was really well set up, and when the strangers took off their masks were well set up, though we didn't see their faces, which probably made no difference anyway, but was kind of annoying.

The opening narration about these brutal events based on fact, reminded me of the opening of ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" for some odd reason--the events that were never explained kind of bothered me--but here we go---

And after about an hour and 23 minutes, the boys with their religious tracts find the dead husband and his seemingly dead wife--though there is a surprise!!!--and the stranger in the truck saying we'll do it better next time. I should hope so, but let's not turn this one into a franchise too, ok?

So as the end credits were rolling, I was still waiting for the pay off to all these really good set ups, and realized I had been the one set up.

A young couple being terrorized in the wee hours by masked intruders out for some thrill-killing?  Good stuff.  I was so disappointed by this movie!  It has a prologue which essentially gives away the ending, which was my first gripe.  The couple, played by Scott Speedman and Liv Tyler, are very annoying.  Don't get me wrong, I find both actors very liakble . . .but as characters in this claptrap, they suffer from a common syndrome among movie couples in thrillers.  they never really seem to talk or believe each other.  Speedman seems surprisingly unalarmed by the events, which I was hoping would lead to a delicious twist at the end, adding a double entandre to the title.  Nope.  The film borrows from every classic . . .""A Clockwork Orange"", ""Halloween"", ""In Cold Blood"", etc.  It's directed with style and oodles of atmosphere thanks to the cinematography and music by tomandandy.  However, the movie gets weighed down in its cliches and never taps into its very frightening premise in a primal way.  The characters fall down, get limping leg injuries, and as usual, the killers are master electricians, cutting power and devices that offer escape and help.  There are more plot-holes here than a wheel of Swiss cheese.  Look at the scene with Tyler's cell phone early on . . .does anyone have a cell that will not work even when you plug it into the charger regardless if the battery is weak or dead?

The ending is the one moment that the film hints at what should have been a much scarier movie, as it is also the moment of relaization that everything that came before it was time-stalling prologue, which makes less sense as a story.  It was like the ending belonged in another movie.  A better one.  The actors are on their game in this scene and it's what elevated the rating by one star for me.  I just wish the rest of the movie had the balls to follow this premise more closely instead of boring me for 80 minutes to reach one moment of terror.

The special features do not help.  Mostly the filmmakers and actors all pat themselves on the back, but it offers no insight and does not reference the ""true story"" it is based on.  Very disappointing.",1228780800,4,2321,4.607317073170732

The horror remake is a genre that needs to die right the hell now.  People who buy tickets to this sort of thing, puchase the DVDs, and tell people that drek like this is good: you are the problem and the reason Hollywood doesn't bother with things like imagination and creativity anymore. Support the real deal and shun garbage like ""The Strangers"" or great American horror will simply cease to be.

Throw a few attractive, brainless, vapid characters with the common sense of a moth into a secluded location, create an entire subplot about why they can't use their cellphone (the newest hateful cliche to besmirch my favorite film genre), send in psychic faceless killers who can disappear and reappear at will, cue cheap startle scares and old music -preferably played on an old-time record player, and call it a film.  Oh, yes, I forgot the best part: claim it was based on a true story.  This is to say that once upon a time, some people died and nobody really knows how or why.  So just use their actual names and location and build a preposterously moronic excuse for a story and watch the sheep pay their hard-earned cash for the latest horror fraud.  This is the last remake I will ever watch that isn't put in the hands of a director I know only puts out quality work. In fact, I received this by accident and watchd it grudgingly.  I wish I had sent it back without even opening it.  I could have spent that time doing something else.  Anything else.

Ils)</a>, the film alegedly based on the real events that was remade as ""The Strangers"",  but I may well skip it if the plot is as hollow and the ""scares"" as impotent as they are here.  I was literally calling every attempted scare as it happened in my mind.  Oh look, he doesn't see her in the closet, but as soon as he appears to move on BAM!  From the side! Startled yet?  Maybe if you've never ever seen a slasher flick.  Of course they know where everybody is; they ALWAYS KNOW in spite of the crummy visibility their masks must offer.  Here's the entire plot.  Unlikeable mumbling couple lull you half to sleep before Liv Tyler (still almost as hot as her dad is rockin') puts on a nighty to make things watchable.  Panties come off and....knock knock.  Man shoos off bizarre 4 AM knocker girl and promptly ditches his wife under these creepy circumstances.  About 45 knocks later, you get the only legitimate scare in the film.  It's been done, but it's done well here right before it is undone by the mega-cliche of having the masked stalker behind our protagonist vanish as she turns around.  That was when I knew I was in for a long night.  Moving on: 3 wierdos in unscary masks continue play pranks on our couple all night before remembering what they wanted to do the next day and then going on about their pointless business.  The end.

Details, you ask?  You'll be sorryyy...
Masked killers to affluent couple: ""Ha ha, popped your tires and busted your windshield, losers!  Pwned!""  ""I totally wrote 'hello' all over your mirror, dudes!  Isn't that FREAKY!""  ""I'm gonna cuuuut yooooouu. No, not really. No really, I am!  See me scraping the knife on stuff as I slowly walk towards you?  Creepy!  I'm really gonna cut you.  NOT!""
So the requisite friend comes to visit and enters the fugged-up house without so much as a ""hello, anyone home"" while the couple are huddled in a room with a shotgun pointed at the door.  Gee, I can't imagine how this will end.  Oh, wait, there's a sranger totally following him with an axe so.... nope, ironic cliche overdrive still in effect.  Snore.  Oh, look the big man with a gun is ditching his lady again.  Why?  Because he's an idiot.  How about BOTH OF YOU going outside together so that you two with the friggin' gun and pockets full of shells have a wide open view and can therefore shoot any of the three knife and hatchet wielding masked losers trying to prank you to death?  No?  You'd rather get snuck up on trying to hotwire a vehicle while your wife sits in the house alone with her face buried in her knees and the dude with a gunney sack on his head stares at her while doing that head-tilting thing that hasn't been effective since ""Halloween""?  Alright, I guess that's what any reasonable couple in peril would do.  Does anyody find any of this believable or remotely scary?  Anyone?

But when I'm acutely aware of how every single scene will end and actively annoyed by the stupidity of each and every character, a tension and suspense vacuum inevitably results.  The ending is particularly laughable.  The final shot is the most cliche of them all and the only thing remotely disturbing about the stangers' parting line ""next time wil be easier"" is that it implies a possible sequel.  That and the only way to make it easier would have been to not act like a bunch of prank-crazed teleporting fratboys who have seen too many slasher films for an entire night before finally doing what they presumably came to do (for no reason, mind you) in broad daylight to a couple that appeared to desire nothing more than death's sweet release from the opening scene.

James (Scott Speedman) and Kristen (Liv Tyler) are on their way to a summer retreat house. The house is completely decked out with rose petals, candles, and champagne.  It was supposed to be a happy occasion for the couple, but Kristen unexpectedly turned down James' marriage proposal.  Now, the couple is shut up inside the house with virtually nothing to do.  Kristen discovered she had run out of cigarettes and she asked James to go out for more.  But, when James leaves, the terror begins for Kristen.  Soon, she is hearing strange noises and loud knocking at the front door.

The events continue to get more and more scary until the masked intruders have made their way inside the house.  Ultimately, Chris and Kristen are abducted and tied up by the intruders, leaving Kristen to say ""why us?""  The abductors' simple reply is chilling: ""because you're home"".

Although her screams and wails were quite realistic and moving at times the movie itself failed to deliver any kind of thrilling horror. The storyline is not original but the fact that it was based on true events gave it some weight, unfortunately the movie had nothing. I couldn't help but see it as an extremely bad remake of 'Funny Games' the movie written and directed by Michael Haneke. The mind games took up all the movie time and built up the viewers expectations so much that when the end came it was kind of ""YAWN that's it?!?!""
Also this movie probably had 4 lines altogether so not much to say about the script at all.

3524981,5,B001D2WU9I,"Bryan Bertino's debut film ""The Strangers"" is among the most frightening American horror movies I have seen released since 2000.

Starting with a serious disappointment in ""love"", young almost newlywed Kristen McKay (Liv Tyler) and her amazingly stoic would-be fiancee Scott Speedman (James Hoyt) retreat to their vacation home in a remote wooded area to get it together.  After a close friend's wedding, Scott proposed to Kristen and was rejected.

The symbolism is appropriate for the events to come--rose petals scattered around champagne bottles, the now humiliating box in which a marriage ring is held--beauty and security rejected and destroyed.  And me oh my, is it.

The only time the viewer gets a close shot at one of the ""Stranger"" when both characters are home: a nondescript blond woman pounds on the door and asks: ""Is Tamra home?""  When Scott answers no, she smirks a bit in the darkness and replies ""Are you sure?""
Using the eerie backdrop of vinyl records skipping and ceaseless pounding at the door, the nameless killers (who wear childlike Halloween masks) launch an all out assault on the senses, souls, and physical safety of the two.  I was convinced that at some point Bertino would make a mistake and reveal the identity of the family? doing this: he never drops the ball once.

3) Bad people come to the summer home.

Overall I really enjoyed it and I was scared. Liv Tyler was fantastic. My only criticism is that the main characters employed some really terrible tactics.  One of the things I like about the SAW series is that they are in a super tough situation and even a pretty smart guy would have a hard time surviving.

One big question - where do these people live, with no neighbors who call police after hearing screams, shotgun blasts, splintering wood, and exploding car windows?  If they live in the middle of nowhere, it would have been nice to tell us that.  Instead, any city-dweller viewer is going to wonder when the police are going to show up.

Behold the stupidest human being on the face of planet - the friend of the lead actor.  If you arrived at a friend's house, and a second after shutting off your car, your rear window explodes accompanied by a shotgun blast, would you:
a) Start your car and hightail it out of there
b) Duck under the dashboard and phone 911 on your cell
c) Get out of your car and walk cautiously walk toward your friend's house asking ""is anyone there?"".
If you answered C, then it's only a matter of time before the Darwin Theory does what it's supposed to do and removes you from the food chain.

It reminded me of some of my favorite horror books, people being lost or cut of from civilization with something evil on their trail. Well this movie was awesome, I enjoyed the atmosphere and the creep factor was high, a cozy home has never looked as ominous and unfriendly as this one.

When a couple on the verge of a happy moment ( en engagement)  suddenly hits a rough patch because the girl doesn't want the ring, they leave the dinner party and head back to on old family house; set up with rose petals and awaiting them with privacy and what was supposed to be a romantic night. Alone in middle of nowhere they try to settle in for the night, their awkwardness visible as James Hoyt (Scott Speedman) tires to lessen his embarrassment from the rejection without cutting out Kristen McKay (Liv Tyler) from his life forever. Depressed and confused up they manage to hug and kiss, when loud knock rattles the door. Seeing that it's 4 am, they make their way to the door with apprehension and open it to see a girl, standing in the shadows, asking for someone who doesn't live there. They eventually get her to leave, but more knocking and strange noises are soon to follow.  Out of cigarettes, bad habit in life but worse in horror movies, James volunteers to pick some up for Kristen, leaving her alone in the house. Obviously this is when the scary stuff picks up and she is terrorized and eagerly awaiting his return. He comes back but safety is nowhere in reach, together they try to figure out why someone is knocking on the door and banging on the windows, wearing masks and holding weapons. Pretty soon it's apparent that the three strangers are well organized and they want to do more than scare from people, they are out for blood, for no reason other than they fact that they can do it.

I loved the eerie atmosphere and the dark shadows surrounding the small home, with nowhere to hide and with three clever attackers close behind in pursuit.  The couple was driven mad with confusion as to why this was happening and with hope of surviving till dawn, some part of the movie were peaceful, making me feel like all the bad stuff was in my imagination and then the madness would return and paint a grim picture for out couple. This reminded me of ""Vacancy"" which was another fun horror movie; because when people think they are safe indoors it turns out that they are not safe, instead they are trapped, waiting for the predator to strike.

This is a great movie to watch in the dark, for those who dare of course. The TV looks great blending into the shadows and the movie is thrilling and entertaining and even little strange, but all for its benefit.

3524993,4,B001D2WU9I,"I was quite surprised to see really negative reviews of this film.  Yes, ""The Strangers"" does make use of familiar plot devices common to several horror or terror films.  Plot devices, of course, are necessary to movies, plays, and opera.  There is an answer as to why the cell phones don't work: if they did, 911 would have been called with a SWAT team swooping in, and the movie would have been over in 20 minutes! It's not about the devices, it's about execution around the devices.  This film really executes.

I found ""The Strangers"" to be highly suspenseful.  This is a terror film, as opposed to a standard horror film.  The gore is kept to a minimum, so if you are looking for on-camera decapitations and the like, this is not your film.  If you are looking for edge-of-your-seat suspense, you will love it.  Like other reviewers, I won't spoil this movie for you by discussing the plot.

I knocked off one star for one issue.  In one scene, Kristen falls in a ditch and supposedly sprains her ankle.  It's bad enough that she has to crawl.  In the next scene, she is walking fine.  In a subsequent scene, she is back to the limp.  I was surprised to see this when the attention to detail was otherwise so sharp.

Director Brian Bertino got the most of the set, the lighting, sound effects, and his principal actors Liv Tyler (Kristen) and Scott Speedman (James). This is a very scary movie, where the victims are trapped no matter which way they turn.  You find yourself hoping against hope for an escape, even though you know the futility of the situation.

Highly recommended.",1227312000,5,1587,4.567375886524823
3524994,4,B001D2WU9I,"Let it not be said that fiction is scarier than truth. ""The Strangers"" shows the viewer what evil is in its purest form--inexplicable, cold, merciless. We are told at the beginning that this is a true story, thus truth is far, far more terrifying than fiction. Because it is true.

James had set up a bower of love to take his beloved Kristen after he proposed. Things went wrong and the bower became a cold place, almost embarrassing in its intended intimacy. Now reread the previous sentence, with the knowledge that a blood bath will take place during the early hours of the morning.

Three strangers terrorize the young couple in one way after the other, extemporaneously making up their next act of terror based on the actions and reactions of the couple. At one point Liv asked, ""Why us?"" The answer: ""You're at home."" The setting was a vacation home at the lake.

Evil is cold and merciless and inexplicable. Then it moves on to kill again and again and again. Until it is caught. But we don't know that, not in this story, not in truth and not in the film.

Not for the squeamish. In fact, I wish I hadn't seen it. I rated four stars because the film has a sense of documentary, even of being right there with the characters. Liv Tyler's sense of horror is palpable and our sense of inescapable, inevitable death is totally visceral.",1227139200,3,1341,4.528925619834711

Liv Tyler and Scott Speedman don't dazzle in their roles, but I'm also sure they're not the worst choices for their parts.

The Strangers is not a great exciting slasher bloodbath, or even an innovative horror-thriller, but it is a pretty eerie and ambiguous film, and while its not the best to come out in some time, it's a pretty decent experience unless you're looking for extreme gore or a very rapid pace. If you can't sit still for an hour without labeling it ""boring"", go look elsewhere.",1227139200,2,667,4.700854700854701
3524996,4,B001D2WU9I,"There are a few flaws in this otherwise successful film that is in fact as frightening as the trailer makes it out to be.  Not being one for the constant barrage of thriller films (the 'Saw' Series, the endless vampire variations, 'I know what you did...', etc) this viewer hesitantly watched what could have been yet another exercise in blood and gore.  But surprise!  The story (based on a true incident in 2005 as outlined by an off camera narrator discussing the number of violent deaths in America each year before the film opens) is tight, credible, and deals more with the emotion of terror of the unknown than images of gore.  Kudos to writer/director  Bryan Bertino for finding the core of the macabre.  And it is true!

James Hoyt (Scott Speedman) is driving his girlfriend Kristen MacKay (Liv Tyler) to the isolated summer home in the woods that James and his best friend Mike (Glenn Howerton) had earlier decorated with rose petals, candles and champagne in preparation for what was supposed to be a celebration of a marriage proposal.  Sadness prevails in the car as Kristen has turned James' proposal down.  They quietly enter the decorated house, and almost immediately begin to hear sounds outside and a door knock by a young girl apparently looking for a person not living in this house.  Kristen asks James to go out and get her cigarettes and the creepy action begins.  Three strangers each in masks terrify Kristen with noises, secretly entering the house, and creating a tense atmosphere until James returns.  At this point the story becomes an almost unbearable sequence of events: it is clear the strangers are out to murder James and Kristen.  Bound and beaten by the three strangers Kristen asks 'Why us? Why do you want to kill us?' and the simple answer from of the strangers is 'Because you're home'. The ending of the film could have been better handled by someone telling us the results of the night - the follow up to this true story.  But instead Bertino elects to keep the level of terror high.

Peter Sova (cinematographer) finds the right amount of shadow and dark to keep us guessing and the musical score by tomandandy is pitch perfect.  This is a fine little film, but be prepared to jump in a few spots...and keep the lights on!  Grady Harp, November 08",1227052800,24,2292,4.704260651629073

3524999,5,B001D2WU9I,"There is a scene in John McNaughton's HENRY: PORTRAIT OF A SERIAL KILLER (1986) in which Henry (Michael Rooker) and his friend Otis (Tom Towles) invade the home of perfect strangers and torture, rape, and kill the occupants.  When I first started seeing trailers for Bryan Bertino's THE STRANGERS, I got a strong feeling that the film was going to be little more than a feature-length re-do of that scene from McNaughton's film, only it would be padded out, I feared, with lots of the elements of the so-called torture-porn that is en vogue in contemporary horror cinema.  How wonderfully wrong I was.

Instead of another ho-hum, leave-nothing-to-the-imagination torture-porn horror flick, THE STRANGERS is a truly terrifying film that hearkens back to the pre-1980s era of the slasher sub-genre.  As it follows a young couple on their return from the wedding of a friend, the film starts out sort of leisurely and ordinary, not even hinting at the horrors to come.  The terror comes on slowly, starting with a late-night knock on the door, then escalates through home invasion, vandalism, violence, and murder.  However, unlike the relentless graphic bloodletting common to most of today's horror films, THE STRANGERS separates the acts of violence with the types of cat-and-mouse chases and boogeyman-at-the-window shots that made slasher films so much fun back in the day.  Not that the film is totally devoid of grue and gore, but the filmmakers avoid the in-your-face viscera that tends to push a lot of recent horror films into the realm of exploitation cinema.  With THE STRANGERS, director Bertino and his crew want to scare you; they don't want to make you lose your lunch.

As this film's proverbial final girl, Liv Tyler does an outstanding job donning the mantle of a scream queen.  This part is a far cry from her more-famous role of the stoic Arwen the elf in THE LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy, yet she does a very convincing job here generating various degrees of fear and terror.

The DVD from Universal Studios presents THE STRANGERS in both the R-rated theatrical version and a slightly extended Unrated version, and both are in anamorphic widescreen.  The 5.1 Surround-sound English audio is pretty good, although the dialogue seems, at times, to be muffled a bit by the ambient sound.  DVD extras include two deleted scenes and a making-of featurette.

Although THE STRANGERS didn't slaughter 'em at the box office, it did garner on opening weekend more than double its production budget.  Not bad for a taut little thriller that has more in common with 1970s slasher flicks like John Carpenter's HALLOWEEN (1978) than it does with contemporaries like HOSTEL (2005) and HOSTEL: PART II (2007).  Which just goes to show that talented filmmakers can still give an audience a good scare without tossing bucket-loads of blood and guts at the camera.  And delivering a good old-fashioned scare is what makes THE STRANGERS a refreshing standout among today's mostly stale horror offerings.",1226793600,9,2999,5.014112903225806
3525000,3,B001D2WU9I,"I enjoyed The Strangers; I really did.  The setup is simple, the execution frightening.  The ending, however polarizing, is truthful to what comes before it and earns its place in the film.

Having said that, I recommend that before seeing this movie, you watch the 2006 French film Them (Ils) on which it was based.  No, that's not right.  Let me try again.  I recommend that before seeing this movie, you watch the 2006 French film Them (Ils) that The Stangers writer-director Bryan Bertino flat-out ripped off.  Now that I think about it, ""ripped off"" might be too kind a term.  It insinuates that Bertino simply stole the *idea* of the movie instead of lifting scenes directly from it and planting them in his own movie.  It's basic, good old-fashioned plagiarism at work here, and I think Bertino should be a little bit ashamed of himself for thinking that no one would ever notice that he copied an infinitely superior and little-seen French film.

As a punctuation point, when asked during an interview if The Strangers was influenced by an ""original movie or other films,"" Bertino carefully replied: ""I don't necessarily think that I looked at it.""  The title to which the interviewer was referring is not mentioned, but I'm pretty sure it was Them.  The similarities are too many to be coincidental, and Bryan Bertino's response is more than vague; it's downright evasive.

3525001,5,B001D2WU9I,"I'm at a lost for words as to why so many people didn't enjoy this film by Bryan Bertino.  I hate these types of movies, but my roommate's daughter talked us into watching it; and, even knowing what was going to happen, I got caught up in the plot and found myself shouting at the TV, thinking that the two lead characters (Liv Tyler & Scott Speedman)could actually hear my warnings to them.  I never do that when I watch a movie, but this film played on suspense and anticipation, rather than outright violence, except at the end, and hooked me line and sinker.  It also worked on my innate fears, playing them like a maestro would a violin, causing me to think about buying a .44 Magnum encase stead someone starts knocking on my door in the middle of the night.  I think the small group of actors did one-hell-of-a-great job for this low-budget movie, with Liv Tyler carrying a large part of the film on her very skilled shoulders.  She and Scott Speedman certainly did a marvelous job at the beginning of the movie in setting up their relationship with each other.  These were people I liked and cared about, not wanting to see them hurt or killed.  I also liked the fact that you never really see the faces of the killers (except for the girl who was knocking on the front door) though they take off their masks at the end, before doing the dirty deed so that the victims can see who they are.

The writer/director, Bryan Bertino, definitely has talent as a film maker, and I can see a bright career ahead of him in the Hollywood movie industry.  He knows how to reel in an audience and to keep them constantly guessing as to the outcome.  And, no, I'm not really Bryan Bertino, writing a good review of my film under a fake name.  I'm just a movie buff who found myself enjoying The Strangers against all odds, when I actually expected to hate the movie.

Then do watch this and if you're one that gets scared fairly easy, I'd suggest watching with someone or lights on. It is very eerie with the noises of outdoors trying to come in like tapping, rubbing, swinging, scratching,knocking etc. set a very intense haunting feeling. The movie pulls you in and almost makes you feel like it's happening to you. I was afraid to move in my chair or get up for a snack and afterwards to walk in order to turn on a light. My husband did not smoke 1 cigarette during this. None of these reactions are common for us. This movie is not common.

So the film starts with a prologue about how many violent crimes there are each year and how this film is based on actual events.  After doing a little researching here is what I found.  Yeah, the film is based on actual events...in that people are victims of home invasion and murder and that people probably are killed in South Carolina in February.  Aside from that, nothing in this movie is factual which is fine but don't make the claim that it's a true story.

I also found that the ""scary"" moments were too scripted; like there was no reason for someone to just jump out from nowhere for the sole purpose of scaring the viewing audience.  I guess my point is that don't just have people jump out in front of the camera for no reason.

The plot was also a bit thin.  Ok so this couple is in a secluded house and they become the prey in some sick game by these killers.  Why?  The killers were far too devoted for this to simply be a random act of violence.

I'm also not sure why when the couple found the shotgun and figured out how to use it, why they didn't just remain in the house instead of deciding to split up and go in opposite directions away from the house.  Hmmm, what's going to happen here I wonder...

And apparently, the whole plot was dependent on the fact that Liv Tyler's cell phone needed to be recharged.  Had her phone been charged, they could have called the police and been just fine.  I'm pretty sure the killers didn't somehow drain the phone as part of their plot.

Also, the last scene...the killers stopping and talking to the Jehovah's Witnesses...was there supposed to be some profound point in this or was it just there because...?

Overall, I was pretty disappointed with this film.  It could have been better and honestly...why do film makers feel the need to tell us that the movie we're about to watch is based on true events?  Why lie?",1226448000,4,2266,4.4309927360774815

I won't go into the story, because most of you already know it, but I will tell you this: if you are as jumpy and as easily frightened as I am, do NOT watch this one alone. I made the mistake of doing that the first time, and I couldn't finish it. I had to rent it later on, and watch it with a room full of people in order to see the entire film. The thing that makes the film so effective is simply this: this could happen to anybody. Anybody could break into your home and terrorize you for no reason.

The direction is strong, and Liv Tyler does an excellent job. You can tell that it was definitely inspired by Haneke's FUNNY GAMES, but it's not a rip-off by any means. Bryan Bertino has done an excellent job with his first film, and I look forward to his next film.",1226016000,47,932,4.143646408839779
3525014,1,B001D2WU9I,"This movie gets one star for Liv Tyler.  That's the only redeeming point of this movie.  She is a terrible ""terror"" actress.  She spends half the movie crawling around or knocking over things clumsily once the movie gets going.  She looks goofy with long arms and legs crawling through the house or out back in the leaves.  While gorgeous, her screams never resonate and by the end of the movie I actually wanted to see the villains get her because she never seemed believably frightened for her life until then.

It's difficult for the audience to connect with a movie that feels this disjointed.  It's almost a production of what not to do in a horror film.  Everyone's seen writing on the walls and windows in what looks like blood.  Everyone's seen a mistaken tragedy because someone made a wrong decision and the consequences were someone (nameless guy) dies.  Everyone knows that the murderers are always slipping behind the victim just out of reach.  But in this movie, there's no heartfelt loss until the VERY end.  The bad guys are pathologically slow and there's no urgency whatsoever to trap their victims.  While some may say they're ""having fun with their victims"" like a cat and mouse, this is taken WAY too far.  If you pay attention you'd note that Liv should have been taken hostage in the very first scene where a masked person appears.  She was ALONE, fifteen feet away, with no warning.

Don't waste your time.  This movie relies on loud noises for ALL of its terror factor.  And just as a final slight to the movie, records playing in the background does NOT equate to an eerie backdrop if you go through four of them in the movie!

If this were a series of montages or production stills it would make sense but as a motion picture (and I do stress motion!!!) it makes no sense. If this is meant to give us some philosophical or some artistic statement about the casualness of violence and the loneliness and remoteness of society today go watch Bowling for Columbine. There is absolutely no point to this movie. At least Hostel or Saw had gore and sadistic violence and a pretty good plot. This has no plot, no dialogue, no acting, no effects, just pointless noise, some horrible songs on the turntable (I guess every time a movie shows an old phonograph playing it's supposed to signal that this movie is a throwback to some genre in the sixties or seventies). The utter stupidity of the victims contrasted with the paranormal abilities of the perpetrators make the ""based on true events"" tagline of the opening shot laughable. But more than this, this movie is sooooooo pretentious in it's craving to somehow succeed as minimalistic horror I feel like I'm watching it run at half speed.

3525017,1,B001D2WU9I,"""The Strangers"" seemed like a good horror movie when I first saw the trailers,however I didn't get to see it in theatres. Instead I rented it on DVD recently,and I have to say that I expected something totally different. I really tought there was a story,but after watching it I realize that there is no story at all,it's just a couple being attacked by strangers,sure there is enough with that idea to make tons of movie but this one just didn't make anything of it,it's like it just stops there. The idea sounds good on paper but what's been done with it is just plain awfull. What could have been a great movie has been ruined by so many things. I should have known better,it was supposed to be released in mid-2007 and it got delayed twice.

The movie starts with the writtings on the screen : ""What you are about to see is inspired by true events. According to the F.B.I. there are an estimated 1.4 million violent crimes in America each year. On the night of February 11, 2005 Kristen McKay and James Hoyt went to a friend's wedding reception and then returned to the Hoyt family's summer home. The brutal events that took place there are still not entirely known"".Then the movie starts with a kid calling 9-1-1 saying he's in danger,afterwards the movie shifts to what happened before. Kristen and James are at their summer home after Kristen refused James's proposal. It's dark,they're talking and they hear loud knocks on the door...

The fact that it mentions it was inspired by ""real"" events when it's not really the case. Director Bryan Bertino said that the event that inspired the movie was when someone came knocking at his door when he was young and asked for someone who didn't live there,the neighberhood's empty houses have been vandalized. That's the real part of it.

One good thing about the movie is the two main actors Liv Tyler and Scott Speedman who do a pretty convincing job as victims. What those two characters did was pretty stupid and predictable at times(the girl running and breaking her leg is an exemple of something that's been done countless times before).The strangers were also solidely portrayed but then again put a mask on anyone who doesn't really talk in the movie and you've got your bad guys. They made the strangers seem supernatural and inhuman but that was probably the point,it can be frustrating tought.

The fact that you don't know anything about the strangers is frustrating you have no reasons as to why they did it or who they are,it's really just people wearing masks killing innocent people. All along you're watching waiting for sort kind of revelation that won't happen,there's just no point at all. You don't get the feeling that there was anything behind those murders in the movie wich makes it pointless. I know some people like the movie but I just can't. The first few minutes of the movie are intriguing and create an atmosphere of suspense,unfortunatly it doesn't get any better.

The movie ain't really scary,it's scary how it's awfull tought. I jumped on a particular scene that really surprised me but that's it. The strangers is not worth buying,so if you really want to see it,just rent it I advise you. The worst part is that they are actually going to make a sequel to this movie .",1225843200,4,3257,4.677137870855148

There's no question that the first half hour or so of this movie is fraught with unnerving tension.  The apprehension increases with the loud knocks on the front door.  Up to this point there is the escalating tension of the unknown.  From now on, though, the movie becomes monotonous and predictable.  The reason is simple:  there's no story.

There's no plot driving the action or ratcheting up the suspense.  I'm not giving away anything when I sum up ""The Strangers"" as ""home invaders terrorize couple in remote house.""  That's all there is.  Once you realize this, the movie becomes cut and dried.  I hasten to add, however, that it does have scary moments, such as, those loud knocks on the door and those masked intruders when they seem to float through the house's rooms in the background behind the heroes, who are oblivious to them.

In the end, devoid of a story line, ""The Strangers"" is a pointless, empty, and, ultimately, sordid exercise in terror, which leaves one sickened and cheated--if anything.

Yes this film is awful. An idea stolen from the french film Ills (Them),  constructed without the key elements that made the french film so harrowing- tension, tight performances and realism.
Basically, this film is about Liv Tyler's character asking- ""why"", commando crawling and knocking into every prop that makes loud noises. Her male co-star has a more complex performance that involves- pointlessly leaving his girlfriend alone more than once and saying ""run"".
The Strangers has no scares or gore and the faux hand-held cinematography is the worst i have seen. This film should take the cake at the next raspberry awards.

Most, if not all, of the stuff Hollywood churns out on a weekly basis is hardly fresh, yet it doesn't keep hordes of people from fawning over them like they were the second coming.  Was ""Dark Knight"" (which I loved) new and novel? I don't think so.  How about ""Incredible Hulk or any other sequel, remake or movie born from any other source material, such as videogames or musicals?  The over-hyped ""No Country For Old Men"" treads down one of the most worn out paths in all of film, yet it won an Oscar for best picture.  The list is endless, so please let's put that argument of originality to rest already.  If someone manages to create a wholly new cinematic experience, then I say bravo and I'll be anxious as all hell to see it, but let's face it, at this stage of the game, I'm not holding my breath like I used to.  Let's face it, people, this is 2008 and there's nothing new under the sun, anymore.  Either you borrow from existing sources or fuse as many disparate ideas as possible with the hopes of achieving something radical and invigorating.  More often than not you end up with a dud.

I thought it was concise, brutal, harrowing and taut and it was all pulled off expertly by those involved.  The camerawork was fantastic and the way the interiors were filmed, with deep pockets of shadows everywhere, turned an otherwise nice country house into an ominous and terrifying trap.  The exterior shots, though ample, gave the feeling of crushing claustrophobia, the overwhelming feeling of being trapped even where you are outside and free to move.  Liv Tyler and Scott Speedman were great, their terror and anxiety both palpable and believable.  The nihilistic ending didn't put me off, because that's life, sometimes.  Nice resolutions aren't always part of the deal.  For me, ultimately, it's how well the material is handled that really determines the quality of the film.  If you have good craftsmen at work, who really care about what they're doing, you'll end up with a more than decent flick, more often than not.  Here we have a very good example.

I am not going to recap the movie ad nauseum the way some of the other reviews here have already done, however I will give a high level perspective of why this movie is so good at being scarry.

1. There are no ghouls, ghosts, vampires, and demons. The premise of this movie is litteraly one group of people taking advantage of other people.

2. The costumes used by the strangers were simple, and eloquent. Exactly the kind of stuff one could pick up at any party store or costume shop. I feel as though this added a whole other level of realism to the movie.

3. Overall creepiness of the type of harrasment the strangers inflicted on the kristen, and james.

Some negatives that I observed about the movie:

1. James and Kristen making some stupid decisions, that would have any person with a brain scratching their heads...ie...splitting up when you have these psychopaths coming at you from all directions.

2. The strangers violating the laws of physics by being able to subtly and quickly sneak into a space and scrawl messages across the walls, windows of a room to further torment our protaganists, and never ever be seen or heard by James and Kristen. This just doesnt seem plausible to me.

3. The ending didn't really give me closure.

With all that, the movie was highly effective at serving its purpose which was to freak me out, and entertain me, which it did for it's entire 80 minute running time.

I highly recommend this movie, and am only giving this movie 4 stars instead of 5 for the reasons I state above.",1225065600,97,1789,4.460122699386503

3525035,3,B001D2WU9I,"""The Strangers"" can be a fun horror film, as long as you have no problem leaving your reasoning and sensibility at the door. As far as tension-filled horror flicks where innocent victims are terrorized by madmen go, ""The Strangers"" is about on par with the Luke Wilson movie ""Vacancy"". You've seen the basic storyline before, ""Innocent couple attracts the attention of homicidal nutjobs"". It's one of those movies that builds suspense by having the protagonists choosing to make the stupidest decisions available to them at the time. Go investigate that strange noise, open your door at 4am to a complete stranger, make sure there is not one working phone in the house, run out into the darkened woods and fall down, walking into a house after someone shoots out the windshield on your car. If you like movies where you scream at the TV because the heroes/heroine are dumber than a bag full of hammers, you will love ""The Strangers"".
I do think that the masked trio of nutjobs in ""The Strangers"" were pretty scary. Whoever created the masks for these homicidal midnight callers really should get bonus bucks for creating such frightening images. The ""leader"" of the strangers, wearing that pillow-case mask is truly a frightening figure, as are the china-doll masked accomplices. The visage of these three posing like ""Michael Myers"" outside of various windows of the home is geniunely creepy.
So while ""The Strangers"" isn't a great movie, it is entertaining. Clocking in at just over 80 minutes, there are few times where you will jump, and while many consider these ""cheap scares"", I had fun with it. Just don't expect too much and you will have a good time.",1225065600,5,1660,4.869257950530035
3525036,1,B001D2WU9I,"First of all, this is not a true story. Spoilers included. Sorry, couldn't resist.

Saying that this film is inspired by true events is like saying that Bambi was inspired by hunting season or Casablanca was inspired by The Big Bang. C'mon people, you're pushing it.

I find it incredibly strange that a first time Director would even bother, or be allowed, to front a film with erroneous text and false information trying to convey a sense of credibility to the viewer, which  very quickly unravels. It's pretty easy to discover that the factoid:

""On the night of February 11, 2005 Kristen McKay and James Hoyt went to a friend's wedding reception and then returned to the Hoyt family's summer home. The brutal events that took place there are still not entirely known.""

 ... is complete fiction. The director repeatedly changes his story about what was the inspiration for this movie in his statements to the press and other interviews. He goes from the Keddie Cabin murders as a possible influence to the Manson Family murders.

The film does benefit from very nice cinematography and a good budget, but that's about it. It seems that some real professionals within the industry turned up for work, but were given a weak script and some less-than-stellar acting.

I also find it odd that some people think they can make a horror movie and yet what they produce is not horror at all. It's just a bad movie masquerading as a horror movie trying to capture some of market share available. This film is very clearly a scam in every sense of the word. What's next a horror movie with Hugh Grant involved in being a bachelor with narration and complete with an American love interest that just happens to be a movie star? Wait ... haven't we seen that already though?

I was actually looking forward to seeing this for quite some time as the trailers looked intriguing. But I guess I should be mad at the trailer people for raising my expectations on this on not at the film for being awful.

This is a weird project that takes court and homicide television and puts it onto the big screen. Knowing that this was all fake, but being fronted as the truth, made it feel as if I was watching a long episode of Dexter or Cold Case. Both two very good shows which deserve a movie more than this fake story did.

They're staying at James's family's summer home in a remote and quiet part of town.

And see them later she does. She comes back later, beating on the door, swinging in the yard, and generally wreaking havoc with her two masked companions. And oh my jeez, I was terrified. I'll admit I spent most of this movie with my hands over my ears and my eyes half-open.

3525046,4,B001D2WU9I,"""The Strangers"" is not exactly an original movie - it is a remake of the 2006 French movie Them which I thought was more tautly made and well-defined in terms of characterization. Also, The Strangers brought to mind another movie ""Funny Games"" with Naomi Watts [2008] which also happens to be a remake of Michael Hanneke's 1997 Swedish movie of the same name. The basic difference? In Funny Games, the victims know all too well who their psychopathic tormentors are, but not so in The Strangers.

Watching The Strangers [just like Funny Games] was a disturbing experience for me - because of the hopelessness of it all - we may root for the couple in this movie to make it through their ordeal [and Scott Speedman and Liv Tyler do a pretty convincing job in their roles as likable victims] but we also get this sickening sensation in the pit of our stomachs that their tormentors aren't people one can plead mercy with. It all seems a pointless exercise and just emphasizes how empty some souls truly are.

So what made me sit through the movie? Well, the scare tactics were quite unsettling - the use of masks by the villains was a convincing cinematic tool as it completely dehumanizes them and the effects are thus all the more chilling. The sound effects were simple yet effective in conveying how totally vulnerable the victims are [banging on doors, glass shattering, folksy music playing in the background,  etc]. Of course, as with many horror movies, the protagonists do some pretty stupid things that has us going ""What???"" but all in all, the creepy factor outweighs these lapses in judgment. It also helps that the movie isn't too long, about 87 mins total running time. The convincing character portrayal by Liv Tyler especially had me rooting for her to make it right till the end.
Gore factor - not much, this is not a splatterfest though there is plenty of violence and blood at the end.

3525052,3,B001D2WU9I,"After watching the French-horror thriller ""THEM"" a few months ago, I didn't really have high hopes for this supposed ""based"" on true events film: ""THE STRANGERS"". If this isn't a remake, it certainly has strong similarities. (Maybe this was also based on the incident in Romania?) ""Them"" came out around 2006, if this was written before, what took it so long to be made? The quality of the film doesn't reflect anything special to cause a delay in its release. The French film was based on true events that happened in Romania; ""Them"" was full of atmosphere and the actors portrayed a very panicked couple who were trying to survive. ""The Strangers"" is no different, very similar premise--with a slightly different screenplay, comparisons will be made and this film gives a feeling of Deja Vu. So how does it compare to the French Horror thriller?

A young couple, James and Kristen (Scott Speedman and Liv Tyler respectively) goes to a summer house after attending a wedding for a little ""R & R"". Apparently their ""love"" had become strained due to the fact that Kristen had rejected James' proposal. The two are quite uncomfortable around each other with James acting embarrassed about the whole thing. The two thought that they could try to reconnect with each other this evening, little do they know that this may become their most horrific night together as the summer house is assaulted by ""The Strangers""...

I had mixed feelings about ""Them"", but I can very well say that the French take on this idea is a lot better than this film. This film would have done a lot better if it just remade ""Them"" shot for shot, and avoided any attempts at another screenplay. There isn't much that happens in ""The Strangers"" and while I do accept the idea of one night--a couple--in a big house--attacked by home invaders--the film resorted to the usual weaknesses that made horror films so full of clich.

The usual clichs are present in this film; very idiotic decisions, panicked reactions that doesn't make any sense and antagonists that ""toy"" with their victims. At least, in ""Them"" the couple were making credible attempts to survive; in this remake, James and Kristen seem to be just waiting for death. Sure, the antagonists were probably ""spooking"" them out, but all their reactions did not make sense. All the potentially ""good"" decisions were abandoned so the film can get to where it wanted to go. Talk about ""Lambs to the Slaughter""...

Now, I can ignore clichs as long as the film knows where it is going but here, the antagonists spend a very significant amount of time standing around, walking the house and trying to intimidate --writing notes in walls and windows with red (I assume either) lipstick or paint; the film just dawdles too much in trying to be creepy that it lost all elements of realism. (This is supposed to be based on a real story, right?) The lack of character development may be ignored so long as one can relate to the characters, when the viewer is immersed in the proceedings. The antagonists are all wearing masks that look rather silly and one look at those masks you'd know their intentions were obviously hostile. ""Them"" had it right with the hooded sweaters and the trickery with the shadows. Director Bryan Bertino definitely wanted to add some nice visuals and plays on ambiguity to try to make the film disturbing.

To its credit, the performance by Liv Tyler was quite good and she managed to show a lot of emotion. Scott Speedman had so little to work with, so I couldn't really say if his performance was bad or not. The ""strained"" romance thing does add some empathy to our characters. I was somewhat pleased that they weren't the usual happy couple. The film's cinematography is also quite atmospheric, although some elements looked too polished to really be claustrophobic. There were some intense moments that managed to give an unnerving feeling but the unsteady suspense just lost a lot of its ""punch"". The film is just based on clichs and idiocy, it is difficult to promote suspense when the build up is based on these formulas.

I do think this film would have done better without the ""based on true events"" gimmick. The ""true events"" thing will have to be met by realism and once you don't see that one defining factor, no matter how good the set-ups are, you may just fail. The film is supposed to be violent and disturbing, but for some reason, it felt oddly ""tame"" and irrelevant. Bertino's attempts for suspense relied too much on cheap scares and spooky sound effects. The director ends up relying on overused genre mechanics that overstays its welcome.

For a film supposedly based on ""true"" events, ""The Strangers"" just falls flat. It even lacked the original's disturbing finale. The film would have been better off billed as a ""slasher"" flick than an involving horror drama that supposedly hits closer to home.

The dvd's unrated version clocks in 87 minutes while the theatrical version is at 85 minutes. Both versions are in the dvd. The extra two minutes of running time is on James' additional seconds of  shooting and Kristen drags herself on the floor, for more of a ""tormented"" effect.

3525053,1,B001D2WU9I,"The movie, ""The Strangers,"" is the worst movie I have ever seen. Supposedly this movie is based on a true story, but I don't understand how.  The numerous plot holes in this movie make it hard to believe that this could actually happen in real life. This movie was supposed to be scary, but personally I was too busy to be scared because I was thinking in my head, ""this would never happen."" The three strangers, in this movie, are supposed to be regular human beings, but that is hard to believe when they have super hero capabilities.  For being human beings, the three strangers move at a ridiculous pace, that isn't humanly possible. For instance, at one point in the movie, the good guy goes out to his car, which happens to be located in the middle of an open field. While at his car, one of the strangers came up to the guy and tapped their finger on the back of the guy's neck. Immediately, the guy turned around and the stranger was gone. Now, this would make sense if we were dealing with super heroes, but, the strangers are simply just human beings. This is so unrealistic. Also, throughout the movie the strangers run at ridiculous speeds and act like they're in tip top shape. But, towards the end of the movie, the male stranger is wheezing, and has a case of asthma. So how was this guy, rather overweight, running at a ridiculous speed, having asthma and still remaining quiet during critical times in the movie? Another plot hole in this movie, that makes no sense, is when the three strangers come hacking through the door. The couple inside has a shot gun, why not do the sensible thing and shoot them? No, of course not, even though the couple is only a few feet away, and they should have no way of missing, somehow, miraculously, they miss because the strangers use their super human quickness to escape the gunshot. The opening scene of ""The Strangers"" is actually the ending. Personally, to me this was the biggest plot hole in the entire movie. It starts with a telephone call, saying there were dead bodies. In the actual ending of the movie, though, there was no telephone call.  But, how could they make a telephone call in the first place, because the strangers ruined all the cell phones and cut the phone line to the house. In conclusion, ""The Strangers,"" is a complete waste of time. I would not recommend ever watching this.

I took off one star from the review only because Liv Tyler's delivery could have been better and because the characters do some truly dumb things.  The cell phone should have been charged, and there's no reason to remain in a house if someone has already broken in.  And they should have called for help after the woman appeared for the second time.  When it's 4:30am,  someone knocking on your door for no apparent reason is NOT a good sign.
However, the atmosphere and tension are maintained well throughout the production, and the actors are convincingly frightened by the inexplicable cruelty of three masked intruders.  The strangers do not even want money; they just want to terrorize this young couple, cutting off their communications, smashing their car, trying to get rid of their friend when he arrives, messing with the record player, and so on.  They escalate from psychological to physical torment, with very few words.

3525056,3,B001D2WU9I,"I saw ""The Strangers"" in the theatre and was somewhat ambivalent.  On one hand the premise is terrifying--a home invasion; being attacked by strangers in your own home for reasons that are not apparent.  On the other hand, it was hard to sustain a home invasion scenario, a very simple concept, being padded out to last an hour and a half.  It just seemed to go on much to long.  I found myself wanting to look at my watch about 2/3 of the way through and that's never a good thing.  I also found it a little hard to believe a home invasion scenario lasting all night long and well into the morning of the next day, and I'm pretty quick to suspend disbelief in movies.

Anyway, the film, although a little slow and padded as it was, is disturbing and terrifying at its core and is definitely worth seeing, if only once.

Does anybody know what footage is unrated?  I hate these ""unrated"" cuts.  If you do some research you'll usually find that the unrated cut is maybe a minute longer than the theatrical cut... probably nothing more than a minute of dialogue or a scene of someone picking their nose that was cut from the film for pacing and therefore wasn't seen by the MPAA when submitted for rating.  I'd love to know if anybody can answer.

3525057,4,B001D2WU9I,"Based on a true story?  I think that has been laid to rest as hype and hype only.  But ""The Strangers"" is a reasonably well-done thriller that doesn't break any new ground necessarily but does what it is supposed to do very well.  The underlying premise is that a trio of young adults choose to terrorize a young couple just because they can -- they do it for kicks, it seems.  That makes it a much creepier premise than having an over-the-top creature like a Freddy Krueger or Jason Voorhees chase someone around for a while.

When a person or persons just simply decide to do something horrible and despicable for the fun of it, then the rest of us are basically at their mercy.  You can't predict or defend against someone that determined to make your life a living hell.

That's why ""The Strangers"" works so well -- it shows that the brutality of a someone who is demented (and perhaps just bored) is far scarier than monsters under our beds.

And the real-life sickos are even scarier and more dangerous than the ones Hollywood dreams up for us.

3525058,4,B001D2WU9I,"This movie, of course, starts out purporting to be taken from a true story - a conceit used in horror stories for years, all the way back to ""Last House on the Left"" (which, really, was more grindhouse than horror). The young couple in search of solitude for a night away with each other become the unwitting victims of a sadistic, silent group of people.

James and Kristen (Scott Speedman and Liv Tyler) are a couple obviously in love with each other; but apparently she isn't ready for the big move, because at the outset, she has just turned down his marriage proposal. Here is where it would have been better for both of them if they had just decided to go two ways for a while, but perhaps to put a cap on things, they return to their remote cabin in the woods for one last night together.

Things go horribly wrong when, for the most elemental of reasons (divulged at the end of the film), a group of sadistic strangers appears at their door. Initially the encounter is merely unsettlingly odd; the girl at the door is asking for Tamara, who doesn't live there. (Who in their right mind would open their door in the middle of the night anyway? My first move - if my cell phone was working - would be to call the authorities.) James and Kristen consider the incident odd, but close the door and seemingly go back to mulling over Kristen's refusal. James, clearly strained at being in her presence, opts to go to town for cigarettes. Any excuse to bolt, I suppose. While he is gone, the strangers - who appear to be a guy and two girls - move in and begin terrorizing Kristen. Of course, none of the phones in the house are working - ain't it always the way? I found myself yelling, ""Stay in a lighted room! Make them come to you!"" when, predictably, she begins searching the house for intruders.

James returns, and although he is armed with a pretty lethal-looking gun and our assailants seem to only have knives and the power of suggestion working for them, they get the upper hand time and time again. It is a very psychological thriller; the lovers are gradually broken down to terror-stricken, blubbering victims without any clear thought on what to do to get away. I thought Kristen was on to something when she discovers a two-way radio in an outbuilding (what are the chances of that?) and briefly raises the authorities, only to lose connection.

This sort of movie isn't what I usually indulge in, but I appreciate Liv Tyler's work and here she does an excellent job. You can really believe that she is terrified and at a total loss. Scott Speedman - who I had not previously been aware of - does a good job also, in a handsome-leading-man sort of way, to portray a man who feels like he should be able to figure this out but hasn't a clue. The bad guys, anonymously masked, were chillingly effective without using any dialogue until the end, and that itself, in its brevity, sent icewater down my spine.

For its genre, this was a good yarn, though the ""true story"" bit is laughable. Liv Tyler is becoming a world-class actress, if she isn't already there; and while this isn't my type of movie, it was entertaining.

This is a very spooky film and in the 87 minutes of it's playing you keep wishing the nightmare might come to an end not because you're not liking it, but you're just wondering what will happen next. There were four scenes where I flipped out and had to pause the movie to give the bathroom a quick visit. The sound effects are awesome and not over done. People with weak hearts, watch this movie to see just how weak your heart is. Liv Tyler is so beautiful and ageless that you have to ultimately feel it for her. Very good acting.",1224201600,2,565,4.2407407407407405
3525060,2,B001D2WU9I,"If you saw the trailers for this movie, you pretty much saw the movie. The main quote from the trailer depicts the victims asking the strangers why they are doing this to them (holding them hostage, chasing them, etc.), and the strangers reply, ""Because you were home."" This becomes the main theme of the film.

The movie is loosely based on the events of real life murders such as the infamous Manson murders, which on paper sounds like a pretty good idea for a horror flick, unfortunately it's not translated very well. The entire movie is really just a huge cat and mouse game, with only some ""misfortunes"" (death) along the way. The first act of the film seemed to spend way to long building up the relationship (or lack thereof) of the two main characters, because by the end of the film, it really doesn't further the story or make me like/dislike the characters any more/less.

A couple positive things that redeem the movie somewhat is the sense of realism. After watching this movie, it can make you think that this could potentially happen to you, especially if you live in an area that's tucked away from the rest of a town. Another element that The Strangers succeeds in is the use of sound to create ""cheap scares"". Unfortunately, this is also a con as the rest of the movie doesn't really have much else to offer aside from the cheap scares. It was hard to feel genuine fear when for 3/4 of the movie, the antagonists are essentially playing a game of hide and go seek with the protagonists, like a bunch of children on a playground.

The bottom line is that if you're going into this expecting an ultraviolent horror movie, you won't get it. There are a couple graphic scenes, but none are nearly memorable enough to make the ""sadistic"" strangers as convincing as they should be. Perhaps the performances or lack of much dialogue from the antagonists contributed to the characters being less convincing as well. I felt that even a movie like Funny Games, which was more or less the same idea mixed with some social commentary/borderline parody on stereotypical horror movies, featured much more convincing characters, and I almost felt genuinely bad for the events that were unfolding in the victims' home in that movie. I just wasn't feeling it with this one.

I guess the main message to take away from this movie is that there are killers out there that kill for absolutely no reason at all, which can be scarier than any horror movie. The problem is that this idea really isn't that scary until it's on the local news, not a fictional movie. It becomes painstakingly boring when you realize that the entire movie is focusing on this one very small piece of the killers' psychology.

I can't comment on any extras as I don't own the DVD (I saw it in theaters), but I would say that giving this a rent should be more than adequate. I was definitely disappointed The Strangers.",1224115200,6,2893,4.620622568093385

3525062,4,B001D2WU9I,"While this may not be the Citizen Kane of the thriller/horror/suspense genre, it was a highly effective, suspenseful film. I've seen some reviews on here that tear this movie to shreds, but I don't see any reason for that. Do the characters always make smart choices? No. I would say they do some pretty dumb things.

SPOILER ALERT!
For example, why does the woman stay in the house knowing there is somebody in there with her??)
SPOILER OVER!!

But let's be honest, even real people don't make smart choices. And quite often, it is the dumb choices that people make that give many horror movies their suspense. And given the circumstances that are occurring, I think most people could be forgiven for making some irrational decisions.

Did it have a great ending? No, it wasn't ""Halloween"" or ""Planet of the Apes""-great, but it was harmless. But I don't feel the ending completely sucked, either, like some other films (Cloverfield comes to mind.)

Was it slow? Yes, it was a little. But that is what builds SUSPENSE, people. Try watching The Exorcist again sometime and you'll realize (if you haven't already) that NOTHING remotely interesting or scary happens for the first hour and 15 minutes. But because you know what is coming, you force yourself to endure it. Which builds the suspense. And this movie isn't nearly as slow as The Exorcist (not comparing quality here, just pacing.)

What I loved about the movie was its realistic feel. It felt like actual people who are going through relatable issues in their life who are forced to deal with an out of the ordinary, but not entirely implausible situation. The fact that they make unwise decisions is REAL because in real life, nobody is prepared to deal with a situation like this (no matter how many horror movies you watch.)

This movie doesn't pretend to be anything but what it is.  A solid, B-movie thriller. Why hate on that?",1223942400,4,1891,4.764525993883792
3525063,2,B001D2WU9I,"There is no doubt that this very simple movie is creepy and will get your heart racing and perhaps even have you on edge. Heck, even the previews for the movie were pretty darn creepy!

A young couple, Liv Tyler and Scott Speedman, arrive at his family country home after a pretty serious disagreement. They've been at wedding, and while at the reception, Speedman proposed...Tyler declined. So they still love each other, but they sure are carrying a big Pink Elephant into the house with them. So these two are already on edge with each other, creating a feeling of dis-ease in the house. Just as their interactions are heating up comes a BIG knocking on their front door.

From that moment, they are stalked and terrorized by some very creepy masked figures...seemingly bent on torture and mayhem.

That's all I'm telling. Most of the film is this scenario playing out. And as with most films of this kind, the lead characters make many choices that perplex us. My personal favorite is: ""You stay here while I go to this other building...with the only gun we have."" ""No, I want to go with you."" ""Nope, you'll be safer here."" WHAAAT???!!! It makes no sense, yet this splitting up of the heroes is often one of the only ways to help fill what is essentially short story into movie length. So, yes, once again, the people we are meant to sympathize with do a lot of stupid stuff.

But we can overlook that in the heat of the film, because frankly, the chills and tension continue to mount. The ""strangers"" are able to move seemingly at will throughout the house and land, knowing and seeing all. The masks certainly make them creepy...but equally scary is their stealth. The movie is shot with a lot of extreme close-ups of the heroes...who are often looking on direction, while in their background, we see a masked figure.

The film deliberately avoids using deep focus, and the camera is unsteady (not CLOVERFIELD unsteady...just moving a lot.) There is nothing truly unique in the technical side of the film...but the ""tricks"" of the trade are plied effectively, and I certainly was good and worked up through much of the film.

But the ending is so sordid, grim, and STUPID. I'm trying not to spoil anything, but let's just say that the word ""squalid"" came to mind, and that is one thing I don't want from a film. Scare me...GREAT. Gross me out, if you like. But don't devolve into utter pointlessness.

When the film ended, and the lights came up, I was angry at the film for taking away the first 90% which I enjoyed and soiling it with a final 10% that was nasty and in which most the characters acted in ways that were not remotely logical. I've seen films fall apart at the end before and given them okay ratings...but this one is such a tremendous insult, that I can't see my way past 2 stars. Well, 1.5 stars actually.",1223942400,8,2829,4.568047337278107
3525064,3,B001D2WU9I,"This nasty and somewhat pretentious offering from first-time writer-director Bryan Bertino proved to be a surprisingly effective little modern-day genre film. It is also completely reprehensible.

Bertino has done a fine job of grafting together various events to form the basis of his film, which is shocking, unpleasant, and grim. Most of the film's dread comes from the fact that seemingly normal and everyday events can turn ugly in a matter of seconds as you find yourself right smack in the middle of a grotesque crime that is all too conceivable and realistic. While random and unprovoked home-invasion movies do have a certain sense of dread about them (not least because they are so plausible, but because such events are so well grounded in history, the infamous Manson murders being an obvious example) the film derives much of its horror from the familiar elements of other well-known horror classics (The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Last House On The Left, Halloween, and Carrie being prime examples) which gives it a great genre feel. Bertino is well aware of this and while I commend him for portraying innocent people caught up in circumstances beyond their control or understanding, ""The Strangers"", however, is not content to be just scary and grim - it purposefully strives to be as repugnant as possible (the use of a killer child is beneath contempt), which is where the film falls down. Eschewing the explicit nastiness of a cheap and pointless exploitation movie where the poor decision-making of the victims undermines the sense of reality, we are ultimately forced to watch 84 minutes of innocent people being taunted, tortured, and murdered just because ""they were home"".

Note* The film initially portrays the killers as being ghost-like or ""unstoppable"" yet they turn out to be human enough, which begs various questions. For example, how does one of the three masked strangers gain entry to the house so easily? How is he able to appear/reappear so quickly? Why (when armed with a shotgun) are the victims still defeated against aggressors who use only sharp instruments? What was the motive of the killers? The Strangers is a bizarre mixture of real and unreal and is deliberately ambiguous about both.",1223856000,,2229,5.070844686648502
3525065,5,B001D2WU9I,"I really enjoyed this film.  It is really sad to think that this was based on a true story.

3525066,2,B001D2WU9I,"If you were like most who enjoy horror movies, you probably looked forward to The Strangers like a kid on Christmas day, running down to a living room filled with brightly wrapped presents and a dazzilingly lit tree. What you probably didn't expect when you opened your expensive looking box was a handful of gravel and the smell of cat urine. That pretty well describes the disappointment that you'll feel with The Strangers, one of the greatest previews ever made.

The premise is straightforward. A couple recently returned from a wedding, and reeling from a refusal of marriage, stops at a remote house for the night. What was supposed to be sunshine and romance is instead an awkward and drawn out shuffle of two people who can barely stand to look at one another. Then a knock at the door, a woman looking for her friend Tamara, which sets off a series of startle scares and repititous spooky scenes, as the couple are set upon by three masked assailants.

The let downs begin with the characters themselves, who apparently barely made it out of the 3rd grade. While many people bemoan the stupidity of characters in slashers, these two hopeless souls and their erstwhile allies are so mind boggingly inept that its a wonder the villians don't leave them in peace. Hunters want prey, and tormenting Tyler and Speedman was about as challenging as kicking a pair of still blind puppies.

The set is spooky, though lighting and setup make for some poorly shot scenes. Overall, it was a great design for a slasher pic, though it was poorly handled. The sound and dialogue are okay, and the costumes for the villians are definitely unsettling given their relative passivity. You don't expect Pikachu or Hello Kitty to try and drive a knife into your guts.

The story line is rather fast paced, and there are some very spooky moments, the majority of which you saw in the trailer, but expectations were far higher for this piece, and it ends up being a remake of Friday the 13th, an empty slasher following people with more alcohol in their system than brains, with a disappointing, predictable ending and a hollow message of evil wearing many faces.",1223510400,4,2150,4.740641711229946

1)it has well known actors in it. the actors did a very good job at developing the characters. it was well picked. u can tell the personalities and interaction between the couple. it was also good to see how they were evolving throughout the movie.
2)the setting was brilliant. it could look like a home to live in. unlike the typical horror movie, you actual feel at home.
3)the terror was there and alot of the time it sent chills down my spine. it could have had more and better terror but it did satisfy my taste. im pretty jaded when it comes to slasher or psychological thrillers. its more about suspense and character development rather than body count, blood and gore. it is also not a torture porn like hostel or captivity.
4)the camera work was brilliant. it was simple and none the fancy work like u see in black xmas (remake)or the panic room, it was more ground based. it was more of a realistic sense instead of flying the camera or goin though walls etc.
5)it takes homage to some 70s and 80s slashers like black christmas (original) or texas chainsaw massacre without over doing the homage to those movies or looking cheesy.

overall it was a very good psychological slasher. if ur looking for torture porn or a very blood and gore type of horror movie then skip this movie. but if ur looking for scares or thriller than check this one out.",1221350400,,1400,4.46484375

Since this movie is based on a true story, it'll make you think that someone is out there, watching you, and waiting for you to be alone, so they can go in for the kill.

3525074,5,B001D2WU9I,"To say that the horror genre these days is in a dire situation is a bit of an understatement. From repetitive torture films, dreadfull remakes, and cliched endings, its very, very rare to find a good horror movie these days. But every once in awhile, we are treated to a very good scary movie that rises aboves the genres bad reputation and delivers the thrills and chills. The Strangers is one of those movies.

The premise of the film is extremly simple. A young couple find themselves being terrorized by three masked strangers one night and both must fight for survival in order to make it out alive. That's all I'm going to give away, so as to not spoil the movie experience.

There are a few reasons on why the film works. First, as stated before, the premise is simple, with no back story, huge sets, glossy effects,  over the top gore effects, none of that. Instead what the film employs are simple sets, dark atmosphere, creepy music, and killers that are not given a background but just there to terrorize.

The director Bryan Bertino uses all these elements to create nerve jolting scenes that keep your heart pumping, eyes glued to the screen, and jumping with fright. From a simple act of rusty chains, creaking doors, shifting shadows, crackle of leaves, you already get this feeling of unease, as if you are not sure what is going to happen or what may come next. Every corner you see, every window you look out, it gives you this sense-of-dread feeling that gives The Strangers its power.

 Strangers gives me not one, but three Jason-in-the-mask people, that's nothing new, but when Burtino dosen't give the 'shen' sound along with the scare, it sure gave a bigger depth of reality to the film. The victims are actual smart people, who THINK on their own, not just cut the phone, Oh-NO!, naw, the couple actually trys to defend with a what? A bat! Seems novel, but I haven't seen any horror flim recently that has smart stalked people, though they lack some serious IQ points when they run straight into the lunitics chasing them. Even with this 'revolutionary' realism, Srangers might have taken that alittle far, by having no story at all. I understand that having three villians not reveal their ideas or reasons is what happens in real time, but at least we could've heard some back story, an overheard conversation, or at least their faces!

 Realism in horror has its advantages and setbacks, but if you're just looking for the quick rush, The Strangers will have you thinking twice about turning off the light.",1219881600,,1291,4.699115044247788
