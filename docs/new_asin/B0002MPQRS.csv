2106837,5,B0002MPQRS,"I was patiently awaiting the airing of the show because the trailers for the series looked really refreshing and real. The first episode was wonderful and I became an instant fan of the show. I use to watch Queer as Folk when it first came on but it began to lose me because it seemed to be more about sex than about relationships which ""The L Word"" seems to concentrate more on in its series. Its hard for me to even watch Queer as Folk now after seeing how great the acting, producing and directing are on ""The L Word"". I am eagerly anticipating the second seaon and will own the first season on DVD when it is released in November.",1091750400,18,634,4.24793388429752
2106838,5,B0002MPQRS,"I saw the series on showtime and I was hooked since the first episode.  The characters and their lives are detailed, complex, and very entertaining.  They all have their quirks and it's great to see a collection portraying lesbians as normal people.  The relationships between all eight woman (20s to early 30s)are complex yet you still ""get"" the feelings they encounter with eachother.
There is plenty of sexual scenes however you don't feel like your watching porn because it's filled with various emotions: passion, lust, desire, pain, and much more. It varies from casual sex to commitment so you're covered any way you go.
Anyone who's looking for something more than just girl on girl porn and movies that lack any plot please watch/buy this.  You're gauranteed to love the characters and wish some of them were your own friends.  Enjoy!",1090022400,21,843,4.950354609929078

I thought I would go back and watch it, but so far it really doesn't seem to live up to its hype.  I acknowledge and understand that it was groundbreaking in its day, but some of the writing seems weak.  The hardest scenes to watch are the yo-yoing by the straight girl who is attached to one of the alpha lesbians.  Her reactions and actions just seem very stilted and overly wrought.  I'll give it 'til the end of season one, but so far I'm not impressed.",1470700800,,543,4.233009708737864

A lesson well learned from this show is love is there for everyone and the line between love and pain is very thin...no matter who you are.  I am looking forward to season 2",1444867200,,335,3.955223880597015

2106968,5,B0002MPQRS,"Definitely the best season so far, on the second now and somewhat disappointed. I think the first season covers a wide range of new territory to those unfamiliar with the lesbian lifestyle (assuming this is a stretched version of reality), which makes it intriguing to a fresh set of eyes, and from then on, you get sort of tired of each of the character's flaws and recurring mishaps. Also, awaiting Marlina's return (if that happens)...!! She was one of my favorite characters.",1443139200,,479,4.853658536585366

2106974,1,B0002MPQRS,It took me three attempts to finish the first season. Easily the most boring show I've ever seen in my life. I honestly think the whole reason this show was so popular is because of all the sex scenes. Plot is boring and the characters are all so dull! If there was no sex in this show it would have been cancelled season 1 without a doubt.,1440374400,,340,4.08955223880597

2106977,2,B0002MPQRS,It's like watching a reality show with all the nonsense talking. Also the show is obsessed with showing us sexual acts that is not necessary for the story. I guess since it lacks in material it tries to appeal by using sex.,1440201600,,223,4.333333333333333

2107058,1,B0002MPQRS,"Season 1 Episode Lucky has "" provocative scenes "" that depict the Son of God, Our Lord Jesus Christ, in carnal situations.  The plot seems to be that art can be interpreted by anyone in their own way, art should have free expression,  and it is okay to depict someone's art even if it is offensive to some groups.  Well, that being the case, will someone please tell me if in other episodes will there be offensive depictions of
Mohammed and Moses?  Why is it that art can offend Christians but not Muslims and Jews?  I refuse to watch the rest of the episodes.

Just wish they had more ""gorgeous"" women like her on the show, but I know they are just being ""realistic"".  Not all women are as beautiful as she is, in real life.  Oh well!  She plays the perfect ""role"" of a gorgeous lesbian woman on the show, that's for sure.  The show covers so many great topics, that truly have to do with ""real life"" experiences in the lesbian lifestyle.

Realistic or not, this show helped me and I'm re-watching it,  10 years later, and it's still reassuring and makes me feel alive.  If you're complaining about it being false representation of lesbians, then idk what lesbians you surround yourself with, but I have a friend to match each character,  though some are gay men rather than women haha.  Plus, nothing in Hollywood is all that realistic; this is not going to be a special circumstance just because the characters are gay.

So I have been curious for a long, long time.  When I discovered that I could watch the premier episode of Season 1 on Amazon Instant Video, I jumped at the chance.  But I simply did not find it all that interesting.  I'll never bother to watch Episode 2.  Mind you, I didn't dislike the show.

2107232,5,B0002MPQRS,I don't suspect that this will be the most helpful review but as a hereto male I really enjoy this show.  Before buying this DVD recently I had never seen the show or heard about it from friends.  The stories are powerful and controversial to this day.  I suspect that many people would be put off by the content of the show but it's done in a rather tasteful manner.  The direction is great and the shots capture the emotion well.  Some of the audio seems like bad ADR but I don't know enough to judge that.  Don't be surprised if you want to buy season 2 after watching this.,1355443200,,577,4.2

2107234,5,B0002MPQRS,I just loved season one so much. I can't remember how I came to the show but I got it back in Dec 2007 and then didn't watch it until I moved into my new apartment in Jan 2008. I feel in love with the show then out of love at the ending of the series but this is about the beginning. I liked how they would show a snip at the beginning that would connect back to the episode in someway. Although at first I did not understand what it was doing. Awaiting season five in the mail then it will be time to re-watch the season that started my love affair with these amazingly hot women.,1343088000,,581,3.9322033898305087

2107250,5,B0002MPQRS,"Progressive, groundbreaking, right up to season 4, I'd give it a wide swerve after that though - Chaiken/the writers go into destructive meltdown in season 5 and season 6 bears no resemblance in content or atmosphere with the earlier seasons.

If you are a lesbian this is heaven, finally a TV programme which portrays our lives and loves. I don't live in LA or have that lifestyle but there are a huge amount of commonalities which you can ID with which just doesn't happen in the usual heterosexual/ist TV.
Its an epiphany.",1288137600,,525,4.706521739130435
2107251,5,B0002MPQRS,"My first response, which lasted several years, was to be repelled by the air-brushed, skinny white supermodel push with the one token black chick.  I felt that this was not representative of the lesbian community. I heard that they made lesbianism all about sex---lots of sex scenes, kind of like pornography.

Then I actually watched it and got totally hooked.  I found it incredibly well done and not trying to suggest that it was a representative sample.  This is not research, it has to bow to the God of ratings and corporate sponsorship.  Sex sells.  And many of the sex scenes are very well done.  The ones that bore me I fast forward through.  Mostly, their sex is an extension of these women's lives, which is how most folk I know live.

It sports snatches of ""Sex in the City"" cafe check-ins and is the next generation, the female generation after ""Queer as Folk""...the latter of which I could never get into.  So, in summary, it isn't perfect but it is riveting, funny and brilliantly executed, weaving in elements of the queer community I've never seen even attempted before in a credible context rich with depth of characters and surprising plot twists.  I wish I had this show to complain about when I was a teenager. I am eager to see what kind of ""alternative life style"" series is coming next.",1275350400,2,1310,4.627705627705628
2107252,5,B0002MPQRS,Had a great buying experience with this.  It arrived in a timely manner and in the good condition I was expecting.  Much appreciation!,1271635200,,134,4.782608695652174
2107253,2,B0002MPQRS,"In my humble opinion, the L Word leaves much to be desired. First of all, the lesbians here are all very sleek-looking, and always dressed to-the-nines. Where are all the plainly dressed, overweight, average-looking, or senior citizen lesbians in this series? I mean c'mon! I realize that there are plenty of feminine, lip-stick lesbian sisters out there. And, I say that they should fully exercise their right to dress and act however they wish. But, the L Word is SATURATED with mainly high-femme lesbians with long, dark hair, and stunning out-fits. I know that they have Shane in this show, but she seems to be just a token butch. And Max is the show's token transman.

If the L Word truly wants to be representative of the lesbian community, then they should include more lesbians that are on the butch side, working-class, punk, poor, struggling entertainers and artists, etc. I know that LA is the glam-chic capital of the US. But it's also a major metropolis, with a rich variety of lesbians-NOT just up-scale high-femmes.

Another thing that bothers me about this show, is that they use too much gratuitous profanity. I know that most people do use some profanity in real life, but most of these characters use too much gutter language to be believable. It's as if the producers want to show how 'cool' this show is, by having the characters constantly spewing four-letter words.

They also have too many cheap, tawdry sex-scenes on this show. Yes, plenty of cheap, tawdry sex probably happens in the lesbian community. It's a long-standing myth, that most lesbians don't value plain old raw sex. Many (if not most) can, and do. But sex is definitely over-emphasized in the show. It's thrown in your face, in a manner so blatant, that it's obviously done only for shock-value. It doesn't enhance the plot-lines, and seems tacky and contrived.

We need a show on the air about lesbians from all segments of the community. And the L Word just isn't presenting that. This show is so lacking in depth, realistic characters, and taste, that it's mediocre at best.",1262044800,2,2067,4.830508474576271
2107254,3,B0002MPQRS,"Would that all my friends had those bodies and I should include myself in that wish. There was plenty ""eye candy"".There could have been more substance. When Tina had the miscarriage there was little attention given to the affect it had on her and her relationship with Bette. The actor who played tennis pro Dana,in my opinion,was not athletic enough in appearence to be taken seriously in that role.
These and other things didn`t stop me from enjoying and wanting to see more.",1247616000,,477,4.759036144578313

I immediately ordered and watched seasons one and two, and loved them. I then purchased seasons three, four, and five - loved them, too. You do not need to be gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgender (GLBT) to appreciate the show. It is beautifully written. These gals go through all the same day-to-day struggles that the rest of us do, but with - perhaps - a little more of a challenge.

Note: there are, at times, very graphic sex scenes, so I do not recommend this for anyone under 21. There is also a lot of explicit language; it is really only intended for adults. Just my opinions...",1239062400,,707,4.396946564885496

2107273,1,B0002MPQRS,"Why doesn't any one else say it? ""The L Word"" has nothing to do with gay liberation or feminism. It's pornography pure and simple, a commercial attempt to main-stream porn by making it look PC. The plot is meaningless, the dialogue ridiculous. The whole point of the series is to show nude women having sex in front of the camera. I'll bet the actors aren't even lesbians. I only watched three episodes of this sexist crap. Enough is enough.

Those who think this series will aid lesbians in their quest for equal rights are kidding themselves. ""The L Word"" is part of the same context as obviously sexist serials such as ""Deadwood"". It's about pushing the limits of what's acceptable on TV. What will come next, I wonder?",1233878400,4,722,4.640625
2107274,4,B0002MPQRS,"This emotionally daring show centers not only on gay issues but a bit more to a relationship than sex... All the characters are complex but instantly likable...The nudity is not exhibited in a gratuitous manner, it is shown as part of the thoughts and feelings of the characters...

The main characters are:

Bette and Tina, a life partners who have been together for seven years... They have the best relationship of anybody gay or straight... They are about to do an incredibly major thing...

Into this mix comes Shane, a girl with short black hair who doesn't get involved with anybody; Alice, the bisexual writer who has one conviction that we're all connected through love, through loneliness, through one tiny, lamentable lapse in judgment; Dana who refuses to accept that whether you're gay, or you're straight, or you're bisexual, you just go with the flow; Jenny who has her world turned upside down when she met, at a party, the most stunning woman she had ever seen; Marina the owner of the little caf who doesn't think she has done something wrong; and Kit, the lady with the flashing eyes, who has always wanted to have a place where musicians could come and jam and get much love...

As Bette, Jennifer Beals is a very well-rounded individual... She keeps replaying it over and over again in her head, just trying to figure out the exact moment when she could have stopped herself...

As Tina, Laurel Holloman gets the feeling from Bette that she's so proud to be with her, and she makes her feel really safe and loved...

As Shane, Katherine Moennig is amazing... She is an unattainable beauty who practices sex with no emotional entanglements...

As Alice, Leisha Hailey is constantly complaining about feeling sluggish... She ends up with the most complicated interpretation of sexual identity she's ever encountered...

Mia Kirshner gives the picture of togetherness and sanity to Jenny... She's beautiful and that compensates for a multitude of sins... While she is truly in love with Tim her increasing fascination with Marina permits her life to be wrecked with supposition...

Karina Lombard is definitely beautiful, sophisticated and hot as Marina... The really thing about her character is when she focuses on Jenny we truly feel that Jenny is the only human being that exists for her...

Erin Daniels knows that she is gay but is indecisive to reveal it...

Lolita Davidovitch is not exactly an innocent bystander... She tries to make others jealous in order to find the others desirable...

Rosanna Arquette never felt more alive than she has in the last 20 years of her life... But would she leave her husband, her child, her houses, her trips to Paris, her black-tie galas to run to some rank little love nest with a nice assistant hairdresser who barely has her foot in the door?

Much could be said about every character... Each actress takes on controversial subject while still injecting true different feelings...",1233792000,,2947,4.917338709677419

2107293,4,B0002MPQRS,"I enjoyed watching the first season of ""The L Word.""  In the beginning, during the first few episodes, I didn't think I was going to particularly care for the series, but as I progressed further into each episode I began to care more and more about each character.

The series revolves around a group of lesbians (and one or two bisexuals) whose lives are intertwined in one way or another.  On the whole, the issues touched upon in this first season are the kind one would find in every day ordinary life, namely love, friendship, betrayal, jealousy, etc.  It is fun to watch this group interact with one another.  You'll also find several episodes dedicated to larger societal issues, such as censorship and gay parenting.

On the whole, however, you will not be bogged down with excessive political agenda-setting maneuvering, and I appreciated that this series didn't attempt to resolve all the world's problems in one fell swoop in its first season.  You won't find any over-the-top Rosie O'Donnell-type obnoxiousness, and I suspect the series wouldn't be as successful as it has been if this had been the case. There is a nice balance in this first season, and those who aren't inclined towards misandry, misanthropy, or the chronic malcontent mindset will surely find something to like somewhere along the way.

One thing I didn't particularly care for, and which is not exclusive to this show in particular, was the fact that almost all the characters are beautiful, slim and trim, and have very interesting careers and lives.  Come on.  We all know better.  But then again, I doubt very many people would want to watch the daily machinations and inner workings of this subculture's most obnoxious and undesireable.

All in all, I really enjoyed the first season of The L Word.",1199404800,,1785,4.874172185430464
2107294,2,B0002MPQRS,"I heard that this show was the lesbian version of Sex and the City which is not at all true.  They don't delve into fashion at all.  The show is mostly about lesbian relationships which is great, but the story line wasn't believable.

But I must admit that I still purchased Season 2 because there's something addictive about it...",1190678400,,331,4.576271186440678
2107295,5,B0002MPQRS,"One of the main reasons I purchased the first season of The L Word was because I came into the series late, at the beginning of Season 3.  So of course I wanted to know how it all came about.

Season One finds Jenny Scheckter moving in with her fiancee Tim in sunny LA.  Soon, she finds out her neighbors are something else again.  After witnessing Shane and her girlfriend making out in the pool, Jenny becomes fascinated with the lesbian lifestyle.  As she gets out and begins meeting people, her curiosity soars.  When she meets Marina at a party ... fascination becomes infatuation.  Then the drama really begins.

Unable to resist Marina's attentions, she and Jenny enter into an affair.  Tim one day finds them out and after a brief reconciliation the marriage ends in an annulment.

Season one introduced some of the most interesting characters, only to let them slowly slip into oblivion by mid Season Two.  The most sorely missed to me is the character of Ivan ... a drag king who became deeply smitten with Kit.  I thought this character lent a lighthearted romantic tag to the series and I'd love to see her written back in.

The most tense moment was in the end when Tina caught on to Bette and the carpenter (sorry the character's name escapes me at the moment) and Tina leaves.  The heartwrenching struggle Dana had to endure coming out, not only to the public but to her parents lent good drama to the series as well, and was handled, I thought, in an appropriate manner, although I'd like to have seen her mother come around a little sooner.

Overall, I adore this series, I'll be purchasing Season Two so I have the whole thing to watch over and over again.  There are life lessons thoughout this thought-provoking series for all of us out there.",1183939200,3,1763,4.56687898089172

2107299,2,B0002MPQRS,"Back in the day, television was populated by ""normal""-looking people. Looking like the average bloke enhanced the empathy factor, or made us laugh harder, because we knew that could be us or mirrored our lives. Today television is populated by boring, self-congratulating pretty people, which is why I rarely stray from the likes of the History Channel, CNN and ESPN. Still, some people prefer to live in a world of make-believe, and this is no different with the producers and actors in ""The `L' Word."" I hate to break it to those people, but lesbians tend to dress like men, act like men--and look like men. The ""hot babe"" is about as foreign to the lesbian demographic as ""Mexicans"" are to the nativist crowd these days.

  Of course, if television actually portrayed the ""L"" word folks as they really are, that would be a ratings loser, since it would cause some sensitive-stomached viewers to lose their lunch (and supper, too).  We might even find ample examples of misandry and discrimination; Minneapolis Fire Chief Bonnie Bleskachek was recently demoted (rather than fired) for discriminating against men and women who were not gay, and giving preferential treatment to lesbians and those who associated with them.

If you like GOOD solid dramas with a bit of flare (like the O.C.), as well as stuff exploring the emotional life of women (like Sex and the City), then you must take a chance on the L-Word.  Even though the first episode was incredibly boring, and sometimes its a little shocking to see women romantically linked with women, from the second episode the L-Word hits its stride and only ocassionally falters.  As to the shock, well, when you come right down to it, all women - regardless of orientation - have the same stuff to deal with no matter who they love, and that's where you find the bridge of association.  There is such great comedy in here in unexpected places, also, and I sometimes found myself laughing even as I was reaching for the cleenex; the writing of the show is quite good.  **But I must warn that there are blatantly graphic scenes, and there are moments that reveal lesbian fantasies to those of us who are straight for the first time; if this will psychologically disturb you, don't watch this show.**",1161648000,6,1067,4.507772020725389

2107304,3,B0002MPQRS,"So how does one write a show about lesbian's in a city as tough as LA? While I've never been there, it seems as though the writers of this show haven't either--nor have they ever met a lesbian--or completed an undergrad course in creative writing. The constant comparisons to S&TC are valid in that this show attempts to link these characters and their lives with the same humorous and sentimental string we saw work so well for our favorite NY daters. The problem? The L Word proves painfully disjointed and overwhelmed with its own attempts at supporting such a large cast--so much so it often slips into terrible clich patterns that almost destroy the enjoyable aspects of the show. One cannot help but cringe at the site of Tina's pout and whine combo, Bette's (and Shane's, and Dana's) out-of-no-where obsessive love attractions or Jenny's completely bizarre breakdowns over the most insignificant events (and the poems--eek!). Relationships come and go with almost no explanation either way--plot and character development is cast aside and you often find yourself groaning at the screen, ""Why?!!"" or ""not another breakdown, please."" If this show were about portraying women with coping mechanisms of a five year old, then I could understand--Girl Interrupted was an interesting film I guess. But I thought I was renting something smart, challenging and explorative. I thought ""The L"" was about strong women, their relationships, their lives, their missteps--but it ends up a kind of schizophrenic jumble of grossly sentimentalized floss-thin plots, faucet-like love affairs and embarrassingly bad dialogue.

Okay, so that said (I know, how can I redeem myself from here?) there are good parts of the show. The soundtrack is fantastic, the women themselves are great to look at, and when the writers let go of their pretense and let the ""camp"" out, it's funny, mildly witty and somewhat engaging. The premise has potential and the casting phenomenal--but there is just too much happening, too many divergent themes and stories and too little development to make it really POP the way Sex and the City did. I feel bad for the cast because their talent is really lost in the convolution. I hope that some of the mistakes of the first season are mended as the series goes on and the writing tightens up a bit. Will I watch? Yes--my crush on the cast makes me retain hope that Showtime will recognize the flaws and fix them. We'll see when I rent season two. And while I know the writing will never be on par with HBO, I'll keep holding out that the script will grow up, Jenny will stop being so scary and Shane and Alice will spend a little more time on screen.",1157932800,13,2664,4.854945054945055
2107314,4,B0002MPQRS,"I really enjoyed watching this DVD Set. Its serious, funny, and provactive. i liked the way the stories developed and how the producers intertwined the stories together. One thing i really liked were the featurettes that begin some of the later episodes and provide a framework for the episode and its characters. The best one being the one featuring danas mother in epeisode 9.

The characters seem real enough and the relationships that develop over the course of the season are believeable. I especially like the story lines that followed Shane, and Alex and Tina. What started well but got more boring as it went on was the marina 7 jenny storyline. it got to weird with the introduction of characters later on and some ofthe twists weren't really believable.

The BIGGEST tragedy of Season one was the relationship between Lara and Dana. This was the greatest story of the entire season. it was so romantic and they seemed so good together. you wanted them to be together, but the story ends strangely. Theres words and feeling left unsaid and not acted on. lara wants dana to be herself and once dana is herself she never trys to reconnect with lara.

Okay, this is a TV show so I'll pretend I'm okay with the beauty factor. The show was well-made, very pleasing to the eye for the most part and I enjoyed seeing the seedier neighborhoods of LA. On the other hand, both Jenny and Marina (especially Jenny though) got on my nerves quite a bit and I wanted to slap Tina around frequently. I agree with the reviewer who said Pam Grier's talents were wasted. Jennifer Beals plays an annoying character (Bette) but it is mostly realistic and she is so beautiful you want to watch her all day long. Dana and Alice are type-cast as providing the lighter side and the comic relief. As for Shane, I am not quite sure what to think.

There's a loving couple who want their own family, there's a closet case, a wisecracking bisexual, and other interesting characters who bring it all alive. The comedy and gay terminology along with the sizzling sexuality make this the show to be watching.

Some could easily title this as a ""lesbian soap opera."" But you really have to give it more credit than that. There is a lot of humor in it, which soap operas don't have. And the events that happen are actually common.

You'll be taken into a group of close friends who happen to be lesbians, and witness each character's different lifestyle.

Watching the complex relationship between Bette(Jennifer Beals) and Tina(Laurel Holloman). Joining Alice(Leisha Hailey) on her search for love. Dana(Erin Daniels), with her lack of ""gay-dar.""

Bette-a dominant art director in a multi-year relationship with Tina.

Tina-a straight-laced woman who before Bette, only dated men.

Shane-a rebellious, hard-edged but caring girl who is a former prostitute turned hair stylist.

Alice-a bisexual journalist who provides much of the comic relief with her witty quips and her weird relationships, like with the man who identifies himself as a lesbian woman.

Dana-the loveable, insecure pro tennis player who is still in the closet for much of the season.

Kit-the straight, former superstar songtress and recovering alcoholic sister of Bette.

Jenny-the slightly naive, but imaginative writer who has come to L.A. to live with her boyfriend Tim, but falls for Marina.

Marina-the exotic homewrecker of Jenny's and Tim's relationship. She owns the Planet, the local gay hangout coffee shop.

Girlfriends gathering together ala ""Sex"", at a coffee shop, albeit more uptown than ""Queer"". They are all talking about sex & the politics of sex.

She meets next door neighbors, Bette & Tina who have been together as a couple for seven years. They are seeking a sperm donor so they can start a family. They invite Tim & Jenny to some of their parties which introduces Jenny to a  life- style she never knew existed. It interests & frightens her... a little. She meets Marina, who is very attracted to her. Poor little Jenny. By the end of the secnd episode she is so confused. She really does love Tim & he her.

I also learned that the term ""dyke"" is not offensive so long as the term is used among friends.

I am glad that this show really broke up the stereotypes that I had as far as homosexual women goes. So the next time that I meet a rich, attractive, white woman from California, I'll know that she is probably gay.

Now, I knew before I ever saw this show that it was created as an afterthought behind the success of Sex and the City.  But gay, straight, or completely confused, there is no way that the writing in the L Word even approaches the wit, humor, and poignancy of S&TC.  Of course, the women are just as self-absorbed in LA as they are in NYC.  But for this viewer, the L Word is just absurd.

We've got two power lesbians who keep saying, ""let's make a baby.""  Two women cannot ""make"" a baby.  This notion is ridiculous.  Next, we've got a near-anorexic hairdresser who is nothing more than a womanizing-rock star type who happens to be a female.  This casting is completely transparent.  Then we've got the newbie next door who wants to have it both ways and is cheating on her way-too-good-for-her fianc.  We've got the closeted gay tennis star that's going to do ads for Subaru.  Pam Grier's talents are completely wasted on a supposedly recovering alcoholic who can't stay sober.  I guess any work is better than no work when you're in the acting business.

I gave this show a fair chance.  I watched the pilot and the next 4 eps.

2107333,5,B0002MPQRS,"What a series!  What a show!

The L Word is a treat

I started watching Season One

And was glued to my seat

Hot new $ex in hot new city

With girls so hot they sizzle

They even got Snoop Doggy Dogg

Fo' shizzling his nizzle

It's Jenny trying something new

With Tim way out the loop

And when she's caught Marina-ing

She lands deep in the soup

Bette and Tina want a child

Shane likes breaking hearts

Dana's racquet's closeted

While Alice plays both parts

Foxy Brown is back in town

As Bette's straighter sister

Bette's art show is so hot

it almost starts to blister

Girls in prison - quite a scene

There's cheatin' going on

Someone takes Shane's hardened heart

And it gets trampled on

With all the girls so very close

It should be tense, but dammit!

Every day, like Central Perk

The Earthlings hit The Planet

The acting's great, the stories real

So when you need a break

Plop right down and play this one

It'll keep you wide awake

2107334,5,B0002MPQRS,"The directing, writing, and filming of this series is superb. Something that both men and women, straight and gay will love!",1131840000,5,124,4.9523809523809526
2107335,5,B0002MPQRS,"I have only seen the pilot and 8 episodes from the first season so far, but this is in the running for the greatest tv series ever created.  It has the quality of the early Sopranos shows.  I find it annoying to see someone else's review, limiting this magnificent series to only four stars because something about the DVD package displeased them.  Nonsense.  The hell with the DVD package.  Watch the show and if you have any taste at all you must give it five stars because it is the finest work out there.  If you don't appreciate this, you can't tell a diamond from glass.

For me so far, the most compelling character is Jenny, the bisexual girl engaged to a man but seduced by a woman.  She is usually beautiful, when the director isn't making her look haggard and tired.  She has the appeal of a Susanna Hoffs, and Susanna is, in my eyes, the image of feminine perfection.  But Jenny is a bit of a flake, unable to level with her fiancee.  The sexual predator who has seduced her has singled out the vulnerable calf in the herd and eaten it.  And yet there is something likeable about her too, about Marina, though she is devious and overrates herself and her lifestyle.

Parts of these shows have me laughing loud.  There are some subtle moments that just get me rolling.  It is sometimes so subtle that once you explain it, it doesn't sound funny.  Here's an example.

Shane, Alice and Dana are conducting an ""intervention"" to stop Bette and Tina from being boring.  Shane and Alice wrap up the intervention by telling Bette and Tina that they love them, and Dana says ""ditto"", and Alice jabs her with her elbow to let her know that ""ditto"" really isn't enough.  It's just the expressions on the faces, Alice's attitude, Dana's reaction, that cracks me up.

Alice is hysterical, Shane is awfully appealing, Dana is best when she is giving one of her subtle looks, Tina is Miss Saint, Jenny is sensitive perfection in a flaky biscuit, Bette is a great actress, Marina is Miss Exotic, so self possessed.

For those of you who believe in eternal souls, and that an eternal soul can have a gender different from the body's gender, an issue particularly appropriate to a series about lesbians, I'd say that if our souls can have opposite genders to our bodies, the prime candidates for boy soul in female body would be Marina, Shane and Bette.  Tina and Jenny are girly girls to the core.

In a sense, this series shows people not always on their best behavior.  But I don't think it really comes too close to the depths we all sink to on a fairly regular basis.  It still shows attractive characters behaving in a way that is usually enjoyable to watch, unlike reality, which often disgusts us.  I have yet to see a really realistic show about anything.",1131753600,7,2758,4.5212121212121215

The characters are so well developed and the storyline keeps you breathless. Imagine how talented these actresses are if they can make you believe that they are 100% lesbian, and in real life, they may not be. I did wish, however, that the DVD would have more of the extras that we've grown accustomed to. Perhaps some interviews, bloopers, ""back stage passes""... All in all, I am a die-hard fan and it takes quite a bit to impress me like this. Most people think this is about a bunch of lesbians ""getting it on"", but it is so much deeper than that.

2107341,3,B0002MPQRS,"I often find myself bucking the tide, and here I go again.  I avoided The L Word for a long time because I feared it would be unrealistic in its depiction of lesbians.  Although I know there are lesbians in the real world who look totally straight, are extremely feminine, have tons of money and very mainstream values, I'd have to say that yes, my fears were realized.  I've been out for 35 years and I know zero lesbians who match the profile of any of the women on this show.  So then I had to decide if I could simply sit back and enjoy the show for what it is:  cheesy entertainment.  First I had to overcome my almost immediate hatred for the leading couple on the show, Bette and Tina, who spend the pilot episode trying to locate the appropriate sperm to make a baby via artifical insemination.  Have these highbrow, professional ladies never heard of the sperm bank?  Rather than doing it the scientific way, carefully choosing an anonymous donor from a reputable sperm bank, they interview their male friends and acquaintances, none of whom is just right.  And then at the last minute, these two very choosy lesbians decide to have unprotected sex with a strange guy they pick up at a lecture!  The stupidity and cluelessness of these two characters made my jaw drop.  And over time, my interest in this couple never grew.  Tina is vapid, dull and depressed; Bette is more dynamic, but humorless and dry.  These women never seem to be having a good time!  Making them the central characters is a serious weakness of this series.

Other reviewers have mentioned the problems with the character of Jenny, so I won't bore the reader with repetitious criticisms, except to say that anytime Jenny is on the screen is a good time to take a bathroom break or get a beer from the fridge.

But after watching the entire first season, I figured out what the strong suit of The L Word is:  satire.  When it's funny, it's really funny.  Viewed as a satiric take on our up-to-the-moment political and cultural trends and fads, The L Word really shines.  From Alice's ""male lesbian"" boy/girlfriend, Lisa, to the group therapy sessions for expectant parents, to Rosanna Arquette's kinky sexual predator, to Snoop Dogg's sleaze-ball hiphop impresario -- well, let's just say that I laughed out loud more than I expected to, and those moments were a real pleasure.

In addition, the casting of Helen Shaver in the role of Bette's right-wing Christian fanatic nemesis was a stroke of genius.  Shaver is loved by millions of middle-aged lesbians for her ultra-romantic turn as an uptight English professor brought to her lesbian senses in ""Desert Hearts,"" and here she is cast as an activist, homophobic bigot with considerable skeletons in her own closet.  Brilliant!

Bottom line, The L Word turns out to be fairly entertaining if you don't look too deep or expect too much realism from these plastic, shiny, sleazy and flaky players.

Oh, and one last thing - there seems to be more hot and loving sex depicted between heterosexuals than between the lesbians.  What gives?",1126569600,15,3066,4.716165413533835

  The spanish voices sound so unconvincing and boring!!! This was an issue that made my friends that do not speak english not interested in watching the show which actually is very good.

  I have the First Season of Queer as Folk which is dubbed in the most terrible way too!!!! The voices are so femenine and so bad synchronized.... I believe the dubbing company is the same because some of the voices are in ""The L WORD"" too.

  The SHOWTIME executive that hired this company have to be dating someone working there because otherwise I can not understand the LOW QUALITY.....

2107348,5,B0002MPQRS,The L Word is by far the best (and most realistic) lesbian tv soap to date. Better than Queer as Folk by far! Enjoy!,1121040000,3,116,3.875
2107349,3,B0002MPQRS,"I have a weakness for soap operas that rarely gets indulged; by soaps, I mean melodramatic interpersonal stories with surprise twists, a reliable stream of storylines about conflict-sex-conflict, and most of all: storytelling that makes me unbearably curious about what happens next. Yet I don't watch daytime soaps because mostly the acting is terrible (the actors have no prep time to learn their lines), the plotlines too convoluted and unrealistic (they have to fill five hours a week, which is a grind on creativity) and the writing is really bad (see re: creativity). Most primetime TV shows are episodic in nature, except for a few nice examples like this show, THE L WORD, and THE OC. I recommend this DVD set only if you think you'd like soapy melodrama about a pack of glossy lesbians (more beautiful and thin than your even porno ""lesbians"") living and loving in Los Angeles. Though the show gets into serious issues (which is a soap staple!) and has some great interpersonal drama, this is NOT the gritty and realistic series to finally show the reality of being gay and female in America.

I'd rate the show a solid FOUR STARS, but the DVD set deserves TWO STARS, which averages out to THREE STARS.

The show is fun and enjoyable melodrama (my sister and I refer to it as ""our lesbian psychodrama""). The acting is uniformly good -- Jennifer Beals is particularly good as the brisk career-woman Bette, a woman who is no-nonsense about always getting her own way, though she is softened by compassion and humor. Mia Kirshner plays Jenny, engaged to her college sweetheart, who finds herself foundering as she falls in lust (or is it love?) with the beautiful Marina. Kirshner is great in acting out Jenny's increasing emotional instability, making you feel for her even as she cheats on the man who loves her. And Katherine Moennig plays the rock-star hot Shane, who seduces everyone in her path, yet genuinely seems like a sweet human being. I'm a straight chick, and yet I could feel the sexual magnetism of Moennig -- the girl is HOT. The storylines are satifyingly complicated, which I won't spoil much, but people hop in and out of bed with regular frequency(...) The sex scenes are shot tastefully enough to qualify as ""arty"" rather than ""porny"", but still, the actresses are beautiful enough to make it sexy. It's the kind of show that works really well on DVD too, with having all the eps at your fingertips, because I don't know if I have the presence of mind to catch this weekly.

The DVD set itself is meh though. There are precious few extras or commentaries, which I'm cool with: I don't need bells and whistles for my guilty pleasure. I really recommend renting these DVDs, because I don't know if the show stands up to repeat viewings; rent them first, and if you get hooked on the glossy lesbian MELO-drama, then buy.

Final review: cool & fun soapy show, not precisely a classic for the ages.",1120608000,11,2921,4.7215686274509805

2107358,2,B0002MPQRS,"I heard so many good things about this show that I went ahead and checked out the whole season from the library to see what all the hype was about.

Now that I've watched every episode, I think the hype has mainly to do with the fact that these women are honest to goodness lesbians.  It's not just some women coyly making kissy-face for the benefit of heterosexual men's arousal, it's about the actual relationships these women go through, and all the ups and downs.  I like that, and I was very hopeful about the show not only being true to that but also giving me an inside look into a community I don't know very much about.  I was looking forward to being not only entertained, but informed.

Unfortunately, all I found when I got to this show was stiff acting, mediocre writing, and a closet full of material knocked off of other shows.  Basically, this show is ""Sex and the City"" except it takes place in Los Angeles and everyone is gay.  That's it!  There's not much new here.

Some of the things characters say are either grating in their unrealistic cheesiness, or downright unbelievable.  In the very first episode, the token straight female character (who likely won't remain straight for long in this world of shifting sexual identity) makes a speech about how the characters need to stick together and really love one another and be a family or something like that.  It's the kind of speech you find tucked into movies when people need motivating.  The problem is that after one episode, I am not invested in these people enough to really believe what she's saying, and it sounds fake.  This character is played by Pam Grier, a wonderful actress who has put on a lot of weight recently.  I found myself actually worrying more about her health than about her character!

The two main people seem to be Bette and Tina.  Bette is a biracial art gallery director played by Jennifer Beals (yes, the girl from ""Flashdance"") and she is the one getting top billing for this show, so much of the story revolves around her.  She and her partner of seven years, Tina (Laurel Holloman -- yes, the girl from ""Angel"") are trying to have a baby and the first episode tracks them as they try to get some sperm.  At one point, Bette is asked by the doctor to go down on Tina to ""relax"" her while they're in the office.  This is the most exploitative, unrealistic thing I've ever seen.  What's the point?  We KNOW it's a show about lesbians, thanks Showtime.  The episode is full of lines like, ""[This cup of sperm looks so] disgusting!  I can't believe I used to swallow that stuff.""  Is the show trying to make a statement about sexuality?  The only person on the show who seems to have been actually ""born"" a lesbian is the tennis player character, Dana.  But not a single episode explores the causes of sexuality, it just makes side comments about them, and the comment seems to be that evey gay woman has a straight girl inside her somewhere.  This is the myth that straight men like to perpetuate -- as if every gay woman just needs a good man to ""snap her out of it.""  I call it the Ben Affleck syndrome, and I am so disappointed that it's being perpetuated on this show.

The show isn't really that funny, and the characters are too broadly drawn to really hit home.  Beals has a few good moments when she's fighting for artisic freedom at her gallery against a group of cardboard-cut-out conservatives, but her character is done an extreme diservice in the worst episode by far, which is ""Locked Up.""  In this episode, Bette is thrown into jail for fighting with protestors, along with the lesbian who's doing her gallery construction for the controversial exhibit.  Her attraction to this woman and her decision to cheat on Tina don't seem true to her character, and this episode features the two of them in a jail cell.  The scene is laughable, not only for its unrealistic depiction of what ACTUALLY happens when you're arrested (and yes, I know something about that) but because it looks like something straight out of a porn movie designed to arouse straight men.  What a cop-out!  It's sweaty and cheesy and such a diservice to these actors and these characters.

Another irksome thing is the show's tendancy to open every episode with some kind of flashback.  Most of these are totally pointless, only tangential to the story in that episode, and very poorly done.  It reminds me of the first few seasons of ""Sex and the City"" when they used to have ""real"" New Yorkers commenting on the topic Carrie was writing about.  The difference is that those were funny, and fun to watch.  The openings of this show are emphatically not.  Also annoying as hell is the ""music"" that plays over the opening credits.  It sounds like the kind of computerized schlock that people come up with when they first figure out how to use their MIDI player.  Are there any professionals in the house?  Come ON, guys.  Get with it.

The best character/actress on this show is Shane, played by Katherine Moennig.  Wow!  I've never heard of her before, but she's amazing.  She's gorgeous, and her character has the most interesting arc, and the most interesting history.  Either she's practically the only actress capable of carrying off the bad writing, or she just gets all the best lines.  Either way, she's a joy to watch and definitely on the list of women who are the answer to that question, ""If you had to switch teams for anyone, who would it be?""  Well now Shane/Katherine's up there with Angelina Jolie!

The worst character is Jenny (Mia Kirshner).  Aside from the actress being so skinny and pale that she's often painful to look at, her character is touted as being this fantastic writer -- yet the samples we are given of her work sound like a 7th grader's diary.  Her character starts off as a straight girl living with her boyfriend cum fiancee Tim (the delicious, delicious Eric Mabius, who was often the only reason I stopped myself from skipping the crappier episodes).  We are supposed to believe that she'd stray from this cushy set-up (rent free in LA!) and this gorgeous man so that she can go be a lesbian for awhile.  Her character is grating, annoying, lying, conniving and so stupid that I kept hoping she'd be hit by a bus or otherwise removed from the proceedings.  One can only hope her role will be cut down severely in the next season.

But I won't know, because I won't be watching.  This show is just not that great.  I guess it's nice that gay women finally have a show of their own like gay men do (Actually gay men have a bunch -- all of them better done than this one!) but I think the lesbian community deserves better and can do better than this program.  I don't think it represents them very well.  After all, there's no way they're ALL fashion-model-thin thirty-somethings with plenty of money and free time!  And to be quite frank, the world presented here is quite dull, and I don't believe the real lesbian community (in LA or ANY city) is this devoid of spark.

So I'm sorry ladies, but I can't support you with this one -- I'll be busy watching something else.",1116633600,19,7094,4.561708860759493
2107359,5,B0002MPQRS,"The 5 stars goes to the lead, Jennifer Beals and Laurel Holloman.  These two actresses make it look natural and believable.  They look comfortable and convincing playing the ""stable committed"" couple  amongst the trendy, thin, beautiful, typical,  Los Angeles gay women on the first season of HBO's  ""The L World.""  At least that's the impression I got

Remember  that  boring English assignment back in middle school, ""write an essay explaining what a peanut butter jelly sandwich is to a martian who just arrived on earth.""  Well, if you are living in the suburbs and isn't really familiar with gay life in Los Angeles, or much less about gay life,  this tv show might be that essay.  Or is it?

But enough with the social anthropology, back to the opinion page.  I think Jennifer Beals is just gorgeous to look at, when she smiles , her whole face smiles.  She is very sincere as the Alpha female in this relationship and when she's with Laurel, they really seem like they are a couple struggling with a saggy, seven year relationship.  The writers of the show put a lot of effort in mapping out the various characters and how they fit with each other but it's great that they put a lot of considerations in the Beals and Holloman characters.  There are a lot of eye cathcing scenes like the one where Bette (Beals) though that she was still struggling with the advances of an attractive female and whispers ""I'm sorry I can't,""  but walla, it's Tina (Holloman) giving her a bear hug from behind.  The first episode ended with Bette and Tina in an intense, intimate embrace and that's also how the season ended although the love making was done after a violent confrontation.  Beals and Chaiken did an audio commentary on the first disc and pointed out that the first love scene was difficult to shoot and had to be choeographed meticulously, it would have been nice if the two did the same on the last disc.  I was interested to know how much effort it took to shoot that last scene.  It was a very effective scene  but  Beals and Holloman must have had some misgivings  or at least some difficulties  in filming this scene.  Well, if you already own the DVD or plan on watching it, you will know what I mean..  It  was kinda hard to watch, but this kind of thing, I think happens to a lot of straight couples as well.  I will agree that the DVD didn't have enough stuff in it, but I do advice that you might want to rent it first before buying.

2107360,4,B0002MPQRS,"There really isn't many shows on network tv or general cable that interests me nowadays. They all are rip offs of another show. Nothing is original or worth watching. Unfortunately all the more interesting shows are on premium cable channels that costs more than I care to pay for. One of those shows I have always wanted to check out is ""The L Word"". I finally got around to renting the series on dvd. It did not take me very long to become addicted to this provocative series on a group of lesbians and their life in Los Angeles.

The backbone of the series I think is Bette (the immortal Jennifer Beals) and Tina (Laurel Holloman). This is one of the most realistic portrayals of a long-term lesbian relationship that I have ever seen on a mainstream show but then again most mainstream shows wouldn't touch this subject with a ten foot pole without offending Big Brother (i.e the Parents Television Council). Like any heterosexual couple, Bette and Tina have their fair share of ups and downs in their relationship. They are as human as the next person. Bette has an older sister named Kit (Pam Grier) on the show.

Their neighbors is Tim (Eric Mabius) and Jenny (Mia Kirshner). Jenny just moved in with Tim from Chicago. What she didn't expect was her world to be completely turned upside down by Marina (the smoking hot Karina Lombard) who owns the local coffee shop The Planet.

Rounding out the cast is ex-Murmurs Leisha Haily as the bisexual Alice, Erin Daniels as Dana (a closeted tennis player), and Katherine Moennig as the playboy (or playgirl) of the group Shane.

What I like about ""The L Word"" is that the writing is sharp, witty, and the portrayal of lesbians is more real than what I would see on network tv and in mainstream movies. Still the show is not without its flaws. Lesbians comes in all shapes and sizes from butches to drag kings. On the other hand the lesbians on the show is not your atypical porn star that you would see on a Vivid picture. Other than the lack of diversity, I enjoyed the series. I can't wait for the second season to become available on dvd.",1116374400,5,2091,4.538461538461538
2107361,5,B0002MPQRS,"Finally there is a show that I can relate to.  I have been waiting for a show like The L Word my entire life.  It is insightful, entertaining, moving, humorous, touching, passionate, and intense.  While waiting for many, many months for the next season to begin, I watched the episodes on the DVD just to get my ""fix"" and to remember details I may have forgotten.

I wish I could personally thank the writers, producers, directors, and actors and everyone else involved in the production of The L Word.

I hope this show will have many more seasons to come!",1115856000,4,557,4.53
2107362,5,B0002MPQRS,"We (room mate, friends) LOVE the show. Finally a show for women who love women!! It could be a little bit more enjoyable without the songs from Betty, but that is a small distraction that can be easily overlooked. I think its great that they portray girls that don't all look ""butch"" or ""femme"". Awesome that Showtime shows you that your co-worker or neighbor can be gay and you would never be able to place a label on her because she doesnt have short hair or constantly sport a rainbow item giving herself away. For those of you who are complaining that they ""should have more butch and femme like me"" come on...the show wouldnt be as interesting. I love their styles, and the storylines don't lack anything. This isn't a reality show, remember? Dont stereotype yourselves ladies..dress how you want to dress..wear make up if you wanna and be yourself.

2107364,5,B0002MPQRS,"There are different reasons why people watch the L word, some people watch it because they are looking for the perspective of a lesbian, some people watch it because of the incredible acting, some people watch it for its meticulous directing, some people watch it because it offers a addictiveness that I haven't seen in a series since Sex in The City, respectively. I know I watch it because of all these things.  If you want to see a series that is not just groundbreaking in its creation, but also incredibly moving at times, then the L word is definitly for you.  To be able to portray to the world an unfamiliar picture with such grace, ease, and still keep humor within it all, this is no small task, and I give kudos to Chaiken for doing it with such flair.  Some people may call the L word just another soap opera with the lesbian tagline attached for publicity, but I disagree and say that the L word is better than any soap opera I have ever seen, and it is a show that has overcomed fears (lesbian sex scenes) that other series are still struggling with.  If you want a safe show that won't make you think, won't make you reevaluate your beliefs, then watch Will and Grace, but if you want something revolutionary, then get the L word.",1114473600,5,1246,4.404347826086957
2107365,2,B0002MPQRS,"I can't believe people are giving this good reviews. It is definitely mediocre at best.  While I think Queer As Folk is one of the best series ever made, this pales drastically in comparison. I'm a gay guy with a lot of lesbian friends and none of them are like the characters on this show.  Whereas QAF is somewhat realistic and depicts a wide range of gay male types, every single character on the L word is a ""lipstick lesbian"" and totally feminine.  This is not real life. They should have cast a few really butch women, a few soft butch women and a couple of really femme girls, THAT would have been realistic. None of these characters ever seem to be at work, they are always at restaurants and coffeehouses. The stories are dull and ineffective, and the acting is terrible.  Most of the actresses seem to not want to kiss each other and to not be very comfortable with it. They don't seem like people who have been in long relationships.  And why isn't there even one gay male character on the show? A buddy? Something? On QAF, they at least have a lesbian couple.  And a few older people. On the L Word, everyone is a slick, hot twentysomething. Again, not very true to life. Well, except for the awesome Pam Grier, who is wasted in a nothing role in this. And don't get me started on Mia Kirschner. She looks like she has an eating disorder, because she's so sickly thin.  I just wanted to sit her down and make her eat some pancakes.  The one interesting character is Shane, who isn't given enough storyline. This is a boring, unrealistic, attempt at a lesbian soap that doesn't ring true. Be warned.",1113955200,17,1610,4.433898305084746
2107366,5,B0002MPQRS,"When I first heard the premise for The L Word, I was pretty skeptical. A show centering around a group of lesbians seemed very gimmicky. Still, I decided to take a chance on it and give it a try because it seemed like something different from what is usually offered on television.

It's a good thing I did. The L Word is probably the smartest, most thought-provoking, sexiest, and, most importantly, incredibly entertaining show to premiere on TV in years. By the end of the first episode, I was already caught up in the lives of these great characters. What struck me most was that I found myself forgetting these were lesbians. I came to think of them simply as people trying to live their lives the best way they could, which is what the writers were trying to go for.

The acting is just terrific. Jennifer Beals is so good, she makes you forget she is the girl from Flashdance very quickly. Her best scene is when she is facing off against Faye Buckley on a TV show and is hit with an incredibly hateful critique. In my opinion, Mia Kirshner had the trickiest part as Jenny, the wide-eyed straight girl who almost instantly begins a same sex relationship with the very beautiful Marina. Many times I was rolling my eyes at what this girl was doing because she just seemed so aggravating, but she always seemed like a regular person caught up in an emotional whirlwind, which is a testament to Kirshner's skills. Really, though, the entire cast is great. By the end of the season, I couldn't find a weak link at all. Everyone cared about their character and it shows on screen.

The writers also need to be commended. There were plenty of times when I didn't know why a character was doing what they did, but a few episodes later their reasoning would subtly be revealed, making it seem reasonable. Every character went through an emotional turning point by the end of the season, giving us an entire cast of well-developed characters, another rarity in television.

I highly recommend this show. It is incredible and when the sad final scene is finished on the season finale, you will be left wanting more. Pick this up and find out for yourself what you've been missing.",1112486400,15,2177,4.5886889460154245

Not to say I do not and have not enjoyed gay TV or QAF.  So when the L-word was introduced, I was MAJORLY intriqued. Since I missed the entire first season when it aired, I rented it!  I was hooked after episode 1 and watched the whole season in a weekend.  I'm not sure which plot I liked the most, the Marina and Jenny affair, Dana coming out to her parents, or Bette and Tina's up and downs.  The only thing I was disappointed about was Marina not being a part of season 2.  Upsides: everything else.  I think the young lady cast as Jenny gets my vote for best actor not to say they are not all good.

Watch the show and you will certainly see why ""L"" can stand for so many things that anyone can encounter each day; thus bringing the world a little closer together.

What I liked the most about the show is its spontaneity.  Each relationship ""goes with the flow"" as Shane would put it.  And life deals each one of us a set of cards exactly the same, regardless of sexual preference.

2107377,5,B0002MPQRS,"Perhaps the L Word originally intended to cast a net to catch a small niche audience; women wanting to see their lives represented on television. The end result of the L Word, however, casts a large net by telling compelling, interesting stories of compelling, interesting women.

Set in in the great sin city, Los Angeles, the L Word tells the story of several women who are friends. Bette and Tina, the show's ""power couple"", start the series trying to concieve a child and suffer the problems of finding an adequate sperm donor. Tennis player Dana is just starting to come to terms with her orientation and the demands of a burgeoning successful career. Writer Alice, the group's bisexual, plays sweet while dealing with a kooky mother and a male ""self-professed lesbian"". Shane, who starts out as the show's loose cannon, grows into her character as the episodes progress to a complex woman actually dealing with strong feelings. And then there's Tim and Jenny, who test the bounds of their relationship when Jenny starts an affair with coffee shop owner, sultry Marina. Each of these women are self-realized and very real.

Kudos goes to the women who play these characters honestly, and realistically. You can see each of them grow into their performances as they get comfortable in their characters skins, especially with Jennifer Beals portrayal of Type-A Bette. Also, kudos to Mia Kirshner, who gives Jenny's struggle through the first season real heart and intrigue. She is everyone who has ever struggled with their sexual identity, and Mia nails the struggle on the head.

However, it's one Pam Grier, who plays Bette's straight sister Kit, who will run away with your heart as she wrestles with the demons of her alcoholic past. Pam is absolutely luminous in her role; somehow managing to play each scene with dignity and sorrow. If one should be turned off by the content of the show, one should watch it if only for Grier's beautiful performance.

And the content of the show is definitely not for everyone. Easily offensive to those people who prefer one closed-minded version of the world, the L Word may not be for them. However, for the rest of us who love a good story, and who love to see strong women characters dealiing with life's issues, the L Word should be on our must-see list.",1106438400,36,2305,4.827848101265823
2107378,1,B0002MPQRS,"Lame! Very, very lame. Now, I know most will be disgruntled with this review; I can't help but to find the show tedious and boring. Is this supposed to be controversial television? Pretty much change the lesbian tension to heterosexual tension and you would have any nighttime soap on television.

I am a big fan of Queer as Folk and the comparisons are pointless. Queer as Folk is a better show, with better writing, better acting and characters that make you feel something and even, if you watch long enough, make you feel as if you know them. While watching the L Word; I was just begging for these women to shut up. I mean, it was pretty much bed-hopping, complaining and then sitting around drinking lattes and complaining some more. Deadly boring in my point-of-view but would it have hurt to insert some humor, some light-heartedness?

Also, I keep reading in these reviews that finally a show that represents lesbians? I do congratulate them for moving beyond the butch stereotype but they traded it for another stereotype, the femme one. I'd love to see a show where the lesbians were more than just lipstick lesbians and have it where all types were involved. At least QAF does that much.

Why is it that most gay men take so much care of themselves but most lesbians don't? How can one be attracted to an overweight woman with a military haircut, tattoos all over, B.O. and hairy armpits? Before I get a woman that looks and acts like a man, I rather go for a real man!

The show is so erotic and interesting from the first to the last tape that I could not stop watching it. I was attracted to almost all of the characters in the show, especially Alice.

The women on this series definitely help us ""lipstick lesbians"" to feel even more sexy and attractive, ready to make every man jealous! ;)

This show helped tremendously in proofing that lesbians can be smart, classy, sophisticated, attractive and sexy at the same time. I know they are out there, unfortunately they are hard to find, but they are out there!

2107381,3,B0002MPQRS,"This series, the L word, is interesting. The positive commentry I have over it is the fact that for once there is a show about the personal and intimate lives of lesbians, which is something you don't see on television or DVD everyday. However, that seems to be the only thing about this show that makes it interesting and slightly different. It's interesting to kind of have a glimpse of the lesbian world behind closed doors and in bars on television. BUT, the criticism i have over this show is just that...the stories are kind of flat. At times the stories are hard to follow, or they are simply too boring. Also, there is nothing much about this show that shows originality, except for the fact that the episodes revolve around these lesbians. I think there should be more to a show than just knowing the sexual preference of the characters. Half of these characters don't seem to have much personality, they're all too comfortable in their cliche, some are quite annoying, and there is barely anything in these characters that you can actually relate to, or actually love. And i wish that they could have made things more natural. It seems as if every single person on the show is a lesbian, except for the sexually confused Jenny and her fiance/bf tim. As i said before, the show lacks originality and excitement in these episodes. They seem to just go nowhere, and i notice at times that one day they can be at the bar, then the next scene can be at some other place and its the next day already. I wish they could specify when something is happening and where. I know this is a lot of criticism for a freshman debut of a new series, but i just think that this show is getting a bit overrated and overlooked because of the lesbian factor of it. Don't get me wrong, it's great that this show revolves around lesbians, and its great that there are a few lesbian sex scenes (not enough though...so don't expect this to be porn) but i just think there should be more to this show than just the fact that these characters are lesbians. They need to put more depth and personality in these characters, and make them more unique, sometimes i feel as if they're so comfortable with each other that they don't even have their own unique personality. Anyway, i give it 3 stars for at least making an effort to create a show based on the love lives of lesbians. I give it 0 stars for originality, there still needs to be some development on this show, so hopefully the creators will put more character and story development by the second season.

2107383,5,B0002MPQRS,"My god ... where can I start? OK ,from the beginning. I am a 21 year old heterosexual female from England and I have no idea how I got into The L Word.

I brought the box set from Amazon.com (obviously).  When it arrived I sat down and in one night I watched 6 episodes ... yes 6 episodes.  I couldn't stop.  Never have I been so captivated by each episode since being introduced to the world of ALIAS.

The L Word centres around Bette and Tina a Lesbian couple living in LA.  After 7 years together they believe they are ready to start a family.  Bette is the career minded (stressed) one and Tina recently quit her job as an Executive to have their baby.  They have a relationship in which all their friends envy.

Shane is the heartbreaker of the group, sleeps with all the girls then leaves them. She does have a good heart, but is longing for the togetherness that Bette and Tina have.

Alice is the funky blonde writer for LA Magazine.  She created ""the chart"" in which Shane is the hub (think of it as Shane is the centre of the universe).  She can link any person (including herself) back to Shane within 6 moves (sometimes less!)

Dana is the closeted pro-tennis player.  Very smart, witty and very sexy but has no gay-dar.  She develops a crush on Lara (an assistant chef at her Country Club) but will not act on her feelings.  When she does she pushes Lara away.  In my opinion, ""Showtime"" needs to use Dana more - give her something to get her teeth into like ... Alice!.  Use her, she's a really talented actress.

Tim and Jenny live next door to Bette and Tina.  Jenny just moved to LA to be with Tim.  She saw Shane and ""her latest conquest"" in Bette and Tina's pool and was intrigued.  She later encounters Marina.

Marina owns ""The Planet"" a hip, up and coming gay bar in Santa Monica - where everybody hangs out.  She later starts a little somethin' somethin' with Jenny ... the seemingly straight Jenny.

Believe me - it's compulsive viewing for anyone - gay, straight, bi or whatever ... its good.

I'll get to the sex part and go back to the rest.

It's a show about lesbians, then why so little sex between the women.  The lesbian sex (primarily with the Marina character and a flaky bi-airhead named Jenny) was non-threatening to any male viewing the show.  And in truth and boyfriend Tim have more sex between them than all the lesbians on the show combined.  I not looking for porn, but just as much passion and lust, and frequency, between the women.  The way the physical relations are between the women, make me think that this show is out to draw a lot of men.

I didn't expect to see stereotype 350lbs. dykes on bikes, but did every lead character have to be fashion model thin.

The stories were weak.  I read a review comparing this show to a soap opera, I think that's an insult to soaps.  This show walks a straight path of mediocrity.

I have HBO and watched The Wire, I also watched Six Feet Under for a while.  There was originality in those shows, L-W is stale from the word go.

In this day and age, we need stand up and be counted as a viable market. If the show HAPPENS to be really fun and really hot - isn't that a nice by-product?",1103414400,7,973,4.293478260869565
2107388,3,B0002MPQRS,"Another series about the young, beautiful and rich, but this time the women fall for each other.  This is a soap opera with all the glamarama and gratitutious sex of the genre.  The women are a little shallow and none of them hold a regular job or deal with any of the economic realities most lesbians face.  Nor do any of them seem to be aware of how priviledged their little clique is.  They're self-absorbed, melodramatic, and incapable of resisting a cliche.

But it is a soap opera.  And, as soap operas go, it's a pretty darned good one.  The actresses are talented and do an impressive job with a script that is often wincingly trite.  Pam Grier is especially good as the older sister of Bette.  Plus, it's nice to see at least one woman on the show who's secure in her own skin and more than 30.

Plus, it does grow on you.  After the first few episodes, I found myself wanting to know how the gals were going to work ""that"" out and looking forward to finding out.  The writing does get better as the characters evolve.  It's worth the money, and I'm hoping the next season continues on the same road of increasingly improving.",1103328000,7,1135,4.399038461538462

Granted no media can be expected to represent every aspect of any culture, this is a well developed attempt to focus on a group of friends who just happen to be Lesibans struggling with ordinary issues and in some cases dealing with the extraordinary complications. All in all I liked the work and look forward to next season. The actors have done a great job bringing the characters to life. The writers are sticking to stories that they clearly have really dealt with on some level, which infusing creditablity into the work. The directors and production staff are successful in creating a very believeble feeling between the actors. We as viewers accept these actors to be the rich and complex characters they play and care about their lives. On many levels as a woman I can related to several of the internal struggles these women have faced on the show.

Jennifer Beals is amazing and deserves much of the credit, however, the other actresses shine in their own light as well. I can only highly recommend this DVD to everyone.

2107393,5,B0002MPQRS,"I thought that L Word was wonderful. When first heard of the show I thought that it was going to have a weak story line and alot of females having sex with each other but when I set down and watched it on demand I was hooked. I devoted all of my free time to the L Word. I wanted to see more of the ""butch"" type played by a black female but otherwise it was great. My ""straight"" friends are now hooked on the L Word. The one to look out for is Bette Porter (JENNIFER BEALS) she is beautiful.
The story line:
Bette and Tina, been together for seven years are trying to start a family in a relationship that is not as good as it seems.
Tim and Jenny lives next door to Bette and Tina. Jenny just moved in with Tim but starts having feelings for Marina.
Marina and Jenny dates and have a sexual relationship. Jenny later finds out that Marina is in a relationship with someone after Tim leaves her.
Bette and Kit are half-sisters that cant get along. Kit is suffering from a drinking problem.
Dana is a tennis star who is afraid to ""come out""
Alice is Bettes ex-girlfriend turned best friend who is wanting to date men again.

2107395,4,B0002MPQRS,"I first heard about this show from a friend in Vancouver who raved about how good it is. So I watched the first episode and I must admit that I was disappointed with the image of the show. I found that the women were too trendy, stylish, attractive and well, too feminine. They don't look nor dress like any lesbians I know.
Two things that bother me about the first season: the character Jenny is tiresome, annoying, immature, and just too messed up. The second thing is that they seem to put so much focus on her and not enough on the storyline of some of the other characters. But other than that,the dialogue and situations are very real. The show deals with a lot of issues that not only gay people face (having children, coming out, etc.), but also straight people who are in the dating scene. It is witty, very funny, intelligent, and exciting. The writing is such that you can relate to the characters. They face normal, everyday issues and deal with them in a way that makes me think, yeah that is how someone would react in that situation.
Unlike Queer as Folk with its over-abundance of and focus on sex, the sex scenes in The L Word complement the storyline. The sex is erotic rather than in-your-face in graphic detail.
And the music! To hear songs from groups like Portishead and Bet. e & Stef is such a treat. The show's producers have this uncanny ability to choose the perfect music that fits so well with the scenes.
I highly recommend it. This is a show for people who are looking for something fresh, different, exciting, and well... sexy.",1100736000,9,1559,4.492957746478873
2107396,4,B0002MPQRS,"Longing--which is pretty much how the DVD set leaves you due to the poorly done extras.  That said, however, the Pilot Episode commentary by Ilene Chaiken (exec. producer) and Jennifer Beals (Better Porter) does more than make up for the poorly put-together extra's DVD on Disc 5.

The series itself is groundbreaking, but it is lacking a bit of direction as with most First Season shows.  Despite some flat episodes (Losing It, Locked Up, etc.), the series overall does a good job at bring about the main theme of the show--love.

There is a bit of controversy at all the main characters being too ""lipstick"" to represent the lesbian scene, but I think it is important to note that the series only serves to portray the lives of a specific group of lesbians living in L.A.  Having lived in Los Angeles, I have to agree with Chaiken's portrayal of its core cast--besides, it is impossible to explain every single spectrum of the [...] community.

All in all, a very good show--I would've given the set 5 stars if the set had a bloopers/deleted scenes reel, but it didn't.  I've grown attached to all the characters, and this DVD box set will hopefully last long enough before Season 2 premiers on Showtime on Feb. 20, 2005.",1100304000,19,1223,4.660465116279069
2107397,4,B0002MPQRS,".

If you're considering this boxed set, then likely you've already seen the show. There's a lot written about the plot, characters and cast, so I thought I'd take some time to review the Bonus Disk in this set.

Disk 5 - in the same case as Disk 4 - contains Bonus Features. All of which are explained below :

Fashion Extras - This is a behind the scenes feature with the fashion consultants for the show. It shows them shopping for each characters wardrobe and includes a fitting session with Erin Daniels (Dana).

Puppet Movie - This is actually worth the price of the set. It's a terrifically funny ""mouth puppet"" presentation by some of the cast. It includes a recap of several scenes and show an appreciation of a cast that does not take itself too seriously. My particular favorite part is towards the end, where we see their trailers. I laughed out loud. This is a keeper.

The L Word Defined - Basically the extended promo that appeared on Showtime. There's a lot here about how the L Word is NOT the Lesbian Queer As Folk. To quote Guin Turner, the L Word has ""a lot less drugs and a lot less dancing"". You have to love her for that. We'll excuse the fact that QAF does feature two pretty fabulous lesbians.

Wardrobe Closet - This is just a still photo gallery with information on each character that also directs you to a website for more information. Do we need more information on their clothes? Um, anyone? Painfully, there is no background soundtrack on this feature.

Season 2 Sneak Peak - Just that, a montage of snippets from upcoming Season 2 episodes. Lots of teasers and glimpses of guest stars.

Power-Up Panel - This is a moderator lead panel discussion featuring some of the cast, producers and Showtime execs talking about the show. Power-Up is a professional organization for lesbians and women in the Entertainment, Arts and Media fields. You can check out their website. This is an interesting feature, though the camera work is shakey.

Fan Mail - Well, its basically... fan mail. Yes, you read that right, this is still pictures of women who wrote in praising the show, and typed out versions of their letters. Again, painfully, there is no background sound track. I guess it's cool for the women featured, but otherwise, I was sort of bored.

Biographies - Again with the still picture (would putting in clips have been so difficult) and a type written bio on each featured actress/actor. Again no background music or soundtrack. You can get this information anywhere, and incase you didn't know... Jennifer Beals was in a quiet little film called ""Flashdance"" before starring in The L Word.

Photo Gallery - Finally, some music! This is stills from the show, cast and crew, edited to music. Some you've probably seen already, from the Showtime website.

Previews - No, not of the L-Word but of other Showtime programs: ""Fat Actress"" and ""Queer As Folk"" (dvds).

Promotions - Well, at least they tell you what you're getting. Basically, commercials.

Though I've read several descriptions indicating a gag/blooper reel. I was not able to find out. It's possible that it's hidden, read ""as an Easter Egg"", but I haven't been able to locate it yet.

Hope this was helpful. Enjoy your set.",1100217600,17,3219,4.702846975088968
2107398,2,B0002MPQRS,"In one simple word: lame.  The only reason this show was a hit and re-newed for a second season is the fact that gay women are so desperate for a t.v. show where they can identify with the characters.  This is Showtime's sorry lesbian fill-in for Sex and the City and falls short of its well-written, superbly acted ""brother"" Queer as Folk.

Bette and Tina ""ground"" their friends with their seemingly perfect lifestyle and when things run amok they assume that the answer to their lack of ""marital bliss"" would be to bring a child into the world.

The foil to Tina and Bette finds us with Shane, the only one in the group I actually like, who is lucky enough to have women, both attractive and rich, panting like puppies to jump in her bed.

Dana and Alice, a feminine version of Martina Navritolova and a bisexual six degrees of separation guru, respectively, have a somewhat playful yet overly typical lesbian friendship and by the end of the episodes all you wish was that Shane would cut the dangling bangs covering Alice's eyes.

What would a drama be without a character made to suffer the trials and tribulations of alcohol abuse nowadays?  That is where Kit, Bette's half sister comes in.  By the end of the season, Kit seems to have ""drunk too much punch"" as she questions whether or not she can love a cross-dressing mullet sporting woman who goes by the name of Ivan.

Karina Lombard, who was not asked back for the second season stars as Marina, a sultry seductive medusa who also manages the coffee clutch the gals frequent. I'm not quite sure how she turns a dime as her friends seem to have a never-ending unpaid latte tab.

When Marina isn't whipping up frothy beverages she is seducing Jenny, a soon-to-be-married-waify-whiny-crying all the time-kind of just want to punch her-fiancee of the adorable Tim, played by Eric Mabius.  Too bad the hottest scenes take place between the only straight couple on the show, huh?

In a nutshell the writing in this show falters with a seemingly talented and attractive cast.  The storylines seem drawn out and the characters don't really resonate, the way I had hoped they would with my own life.  While I applaud Showtime for going ""beyond limits"", take your money elsewhere and invest in a solid, fluid, stellarly casted and thought provoking series: Queer As Folk.  You'll be drawn in and craving more instantly",1099958400,29,2370,4.704600484261501
2107399,5,B0002MPQRS,"This is one of the absolute best series I have seen in a long time! It focuses on the life, love and trials of being in a same sex relationship... it shows you the good, the bad and sometimes the ugly. This series is not only targeted at GLBT commmunity, but also at heterosexuals as well. It was wonderfully created and has great characters! Way To Go!!! :)",1099958400,12,358,4.279411764705882
2107400,4,B0002MPQRS,"At long last, the entire first season of the L word is out on DVD!  And while fans of the show are undoubtedly thrilled, as a DVD buff, I was less than thrilled with the lack of extras on the set.  Any fan of Star Trek or Xena knows box sets covering those TV  classics are chock full of extras such as bloopers, deleted scenes,  behind-the-scenes interviews with the stars, commentaries, and more. Early reports said this box set would have some such content, but it evidently didn't make it into this season's offering.

While the box set does have an extra disc dedicated  to special features, most of these features have either been seen  on Showtime or available in print-form on the Web. For example, ""the  L Word Defined"" is a special that Showtime aired several months  ago while promoting TLW, and while it's always nice to watch reruns, once is normally enough. There are some behind-the-scenes featurettes  about the fashion designers, and we get to see a little bit of  what goes into dressing the character of Dana Fairbanks (Erin Daniels),  and the process dressing each of the characters. We get cast bios, some selected fan mail, and a Season 2 preview (which is also currently  running on Showtime).

The most original, and probably the funniest, piece on the set  is a puppet show created by the cast. A spoof based on Marina and  Jenny's first meeting, it will crack you up laughing. Evidently,  these ladies have entirely too much time on their hands or have  a damn good time hanging out together. Either way, it's pretty darn funny. Kudos to the creators!

Even though it's not as packed full of goodies as we'd like, it's  still nice to have all the episodes of the L word on DVD without worrying about someone erasing the TIVO! Enjoy!",1099872000,91,1758,4.627831715210356

It comes over a little flat as it feels sometimes u are watching Queer as folk just with women as the main focus and less sex. I guess I was wanting something a little more original.

Also the setting is a little unreal sometimes. But if u push past that its a great series and actually is a step up for us. The acting is believable and the women are absolutely gorgeous.

While it's refreshing that lesbians are finally being represented seriously with their own weekly drama, I found the season to be a bit of a let down.  With all of the hype leading up to it, most of us waited with baited breath to see what was in store.  But once you got past the first two passion filled episodes the rest were a bit slow and a tad lacking in realism.  I actually find Queer as Folk to be a more compelling weekly drama for gays and lesbians than The L Word.  Most of the trials and tribulations of the characters were superficial and shallow and have been done already in one form or another.  The casting and acting were definitely superb, but other than asking a straight actress to play a lesbian they weren't truly challenged in their craft.  A majority of the lesbians I know do not identify with the skirt wearing, purse carrying characters who have little worry about money and making ends meet that are portrayed here(it is L.A.).  However, since it is the only show of it's kind on television right now it is definitely worth seeing.  Besides, the first season is always about getting to know the characters.  Based on where they left us at the end of the season, the writers seem to have gotten all of the cliches out of their system and may actually be ready for some storylines and character arcs with depth and growth for the characters.  I would recommend the DVD set just so that you have the background before the second season begins.",1099267200,23,1531,4.432142857142857

But seriously, after the initial exciting nude scenes, I was actually interested in the characters and their development! ( Wow, I sound so like a lesbian right now - and i'm a guy! ).

Shane seems to be my favorite...well ok she doesn't just seem it, she is lol. but everyone seems cool in their own ways.

From what I've seen, the issue of lesbianism isn't sensationalised at all; it's just real normal life for most of the woman. Wait, it is sensationalised alittle...all of the women in the show are gorgeous, especially Kate Moennig, so yeah, it is sensationalised *smiles*. But not materially, only asthetically...if that makes sense, but in a good way.

I recommend seeing this if you're a woman, primarily. It doesn't matter what your sexual oriantation is (unless you are totally narrow minded and/or grossed out by lesbianism of course); you'll find something to like about it. The characters are loving, funny, and for the most part, hugely endearing. It's amazing to think after watching clips that the shows subject matter is so contraversial. Hopefully not for much longer ay?

Soon after mixing with Bette and Tina's circle of lesbian friends, Jenny learns that her Midwest background may not have prepared her for what she will soon learn about life, lust and love in Los Angeles.

Bette's sister, Kit (Pam Grier) is battling with her alcoholism and trying to keep her music career going.  Dana (Erin Daniels) struggles with her identity as a closeted lesbian while advancing in the world of professional tennis.
Shane (Kate Moennig), an assistant hair stylist by day and resident player by night, always keeps the women satisfied.  Writing for a local magazine, Alice (Leisha Hailey) makes sure she's in the know about everyone and everything. Their lives and loves are discussed and played out at the local coffee shop/club, The Planet, run by Marina (Karina Lombard).

The L word is most definitely one of my favorite shows. I can't wait to own it on DVD. The story is well written, the characters engaging. This first season also has excellent guest stars including Ossie Davis, Holland Taylor, Lolita Davidovich, Rosanna Arquette and many more. This series gets my highest recommendation.

I thought the casting was more diverse than any other show I have ever watched. A male that identifies as a lesbian and a pregnant transgendered character! Wow! I was sooo hooked. I loved all the characters which includes the ones that get mean and evil. The last season is so exciting! It was so good to see the young and new actresses in with the seasoned ones. Jennifer Beals character Bette was my favorite. Some reviewers say it doesnt represent real lesbian life. Are lesbians not just people? Of course they are.

But, I had a best friend that I loved, and as naive as I was and looking back, what I thought was girl talk was her working me.  And, I fell for her and I got my heart broken, just like some of the girls in this show.  That was around 2010 and I never pay for cable aside for basic that comes along with my building or association.  But, boy it would have helped if I knew that this show was around.  It did get better as the show progressed and as one of the reviewers said it was cheesy to begin with and it got better.  The show got better and so did the sex.  Good job Laurel and Jennifer.  ANd Jen, don't trip too much about people thinking your gay or bi.  Many studies say that all women are bi.  Everyone told me that I was just experimenting and there was no way I liked woman.  But, I really fell in love with the person not the gender and I know you can too.  You can't say that you can be that close to someone for that long and have ""no feelings"".  However, you don't need to attach any title to it or nor is it anyone's business.  This 28 year old girl didn't chase me down until I was 36 and she only got me because my guard was down because she was not my type if I had to pick a woman either.  I'm with Laurel, Angelina Jolie is the bomb!  But don't get me wrong, your a beautiful woman as well, you would even be more beautiful if you were more honest to yourself and us.  You were a little more transparent at that meeting when you cried about people ending their shoot at different times.  I mean I can't help but watch that unedited stir fry scene over and over and wipe my head and say ""OMG"".  Bravo ladies.",1506297600,,1789,3.9859154929577465
8029551,5,B0002MPQRS,"I love this show. Didn't have the ability to watch it when it was new but now with my Prime, thought I'd give it a try. It is addicting. Hard to stop after each episode. Seems like each season there is someone I wish would just disappear but all and all, it is a great show. Shane is amazing.",1505865600,,292,3.9661016949152543

8029553,3,B0002MPQRS,"quite amazing in Episode 2 that the primary females rejected the use of an object rape con dumb since such ""turkey baster"" approaches are one of the primary reasons object rape devices were inflicted on places of worship of hetero religion so that qualified sperm gatherers could pass along male outputs to their antisocial population littering unattractive sisters along with relocating such bodily fluids for use as DNA identifiiable ""evidence"" of crimes in places the brutalized male would never go.  Other than that, as a politically ""correct"" promotional piece for mah durn homosexual dominance of American society and criminal abuse of the human and civil rights of hetero citizens, the series appears to be worthy of a three star rating.

The series remained ratable three stars even after Episode 9 when a ""black woman"" demanded that a genuine half breed (one black and one white parent) could only see herself as BLACK, throwing away not only half of her real identity but subverting her reality into an exclusive unsupportive group grope posture despite both recognizing themselves as active less beings.  So genuine as a half breed was Bette that she even arranged for her ""white"" life partner Tina to become a mother by a ""fully black man"" thereby producing an anticipated genuine half breed.  My Half Breed Scholarship program is operated specifically to encourage such half breeds to realize their true potentials as bridge persons between disparate races and cultural backgrounds, regardless of sexual orientation, and it offended me that an idiot supportable by the NAACP would thus denigrate a functioning viable half breed.",1496793600,,1641,5.204545454545454
