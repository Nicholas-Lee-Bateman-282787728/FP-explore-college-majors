3917628,5,B002EIPPHO,The delivery went really great and all the DVDs work. they even included a gift. I recieved a super man comic book. I think it's worth it.,1376524800,,138,4.148148148148148
3917629,1,B002EIPPHO,Unfortunately they stopped releasing Kenshin the DVD series which explains why the original DVDs are sold in a high price. I checked this product in particular and it is clearly a bootleg (a fake) release. Which is weird since its been sold with a high price,1368576000,19,258,4.630434782608695
3917630,1,B002EIPPHO,"The price is a joke. Just saw the whole collection at f.y.e for $15, new. This series is great, but also nearly 15 years old, this price is outdated.",1368489600,2,149,4.172413793103448
3917631,5,B002EIPPHO,"I ordered this import as my husband's Valentine's Day gift. We have been watching it as often as we can, and love it. We enjoy watching the Japanese dialogue with English subtitles, as it seems more ""natural"". We love having all the episodes and all the discs in a nice, new Japanese cover. Such a nice set, and a great addition to anyone's anime collection, highly recommended.

promising is the best seller! Two hours after placing my order, promising had the item packed up and shipped, and it arrived at my house within the next two days. Great product, and a great seller.",1361145600,3,577,4.601941747572815
8367744,1,B002EIPPHO,Bootleg rip-off,1506643200,,15,7.0
8367745,1,B002EIPPHO,12 disks? No no no. The original box set had 22 disks. Do your homework people. Look at where this is being shipped from. Poor audio and quality. Buy at your own risk!!!,1468368000,,169,4.151515151515151
8367746,5,B002EIPPHO,"I love this show. It's a classic Anime. Product arrived when expected and in good condition. The price was a little steep, but I don't regret my purchase.",1460592000,,154,4.535714285714286
8367747,5,B002EIPPHO,its field with suspense and activity its a very good show it has a good team and concept,1460419200,,88,3.9444444444444446
8367748,1,B002EIPPHO,"The 12 disc set is a bootleg.  The original set has 22 discs with separate boxes for season 1, 2 and 3.  The 12 disc set crams 22 discs onto 12 discs and usually in 2 thin cases, 6 discs stacked in each case.  The 12 disc set should cost way under $50, although it's worth about $15, the 22 disc set is mostly likely from China, you can tell because a lot of the discs will be scratched up with play problems.  It's hard to find the original 22 disc sets anymore until another company releases it.",1459728000,,497,4.040816326530612
8367749,2,B002EIPPHO,"Terrible sound.
Bad image quality.",1456963200,,34,6.0
8367750,5,B002EIPPHO,The video looks good. The audio sounds good and this is prob the cheapest you are going to find this series. Granted it was only at 70 when i paid for it. Still worth the money if you are a fan of the show,1433289600,,205,3.6818181818181817
8367751,4,B002EIPPHO,"I like this story and the artwork was good!. I think it bite to long. Parts of the story was weak.  Over all, the anime was good.",1412985600,,129,3.7777777777777777
8367752,3,B002EIPPHO,"The show is fantastic. My favorite anime from all time, but i am a little biased to it since it was the first anime i had ever watched.

The DVD's however worked for the most part. I was watching them on my Xbox. I got through to about midway on disk 9, and then the DVD froze. I tried skipping passed it to a different episode, but it would not play anything beyond that point. I tried to play the next disk, and I experienced the same behavior. I do not know if it is the disks or the xbox and disk combined, but I have since played DVDs from the xbox with no issue.",1383609600,2,568,3.9391304347826086
8367753,5,B002EIPPHO,This is a beautifully done series that will keep you on the edge of your seat through most of the series as you fall in love with the colors and complex friendships Aline and bad guys get what's coming to them. I love this series and I can't wait too show it too my daughter....,1377475200,3,278,4.072727272727272
