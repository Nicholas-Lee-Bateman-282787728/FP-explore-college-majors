2554040,5,B000F7CMSG,"Matt Lucas and David Walliams are the most talented comedic actors I have seen.  I  saw Little Brittain USA when it premiered on HBO several years ago and loved it!  The characters they have created are so believable, and unbelievable  at the same time because of their antics.  Speech and body language, comedic timing, make up and prosthetics allow these guys to literally disappear into the characters...and none of them are the same.  They are all unique and memorable.  What's nice is this type of humor is that it is genuinely funny yet bawdy, but not over the top or juvenile and gross like much of the American comedies.  I'm far from being a prude, however I am impressed when this duo can write material without swearing or gross, toilet-based sight gags.  Refreshing.",1386806400,,778,4.7894736842105265

I realized how much I missed my favorite characters and had no hesitation to buy the dvd's for my own collection.

2554054,5,B000F7CMSG,"Little Britain is back for another season of hysterically funny, totally irreverent and wildly inventive comedy, courtesy of the talented duo of David Walliams and Matt Lucas.  All of your favorite characters have returned, plus a few new faces that add enormously to one of the funniest shows on television.

If you've never had the pleasure of watching the very British ""Little Britain"", the show is a compilation of comedy sketches featuring Lucas, Williams, and a revolving group of additional players in a series of vignettes that are, for lack of a better term, shockingly vulgar and funnier than s***.  While the following phrases might not seem funny to you now, watch a few episodes and check back...you'll be snorting and choking back laughter, spraying milk out of your own nose...

...""Bitty!""
...""Look into my eyes, my eyes, not around my eyes but at my eyes""
...""Eh, eh, EH!""
...""I'm the only gay in the village!""
...""Call me Bubbles dahling, everyone does!""
...""Computer says no""

This is a show that you will either love or hate.  If you have a great sense of humour, love English comedy (i.e. ""Sean of the Dead"", not ""Love Actually"") then you will find ""Little Britain"" great fun. Give it a try.  If laughter is really the best medicine, then ""Little Britain"" is your daily dose of comedy heroin!",1373500800,,1313,4.834821428571429

2554074,5,B000F7CMSG,"""Little Britain"" is back. Season two is, with a couple of small changes, just an extension of season one, and it's fantastic.

The sketches and the characters are roughly the same (still just basically blokes dressing up as girls and such) and they take it straight to the limit yet again. It's comedy on the edge, where it belongs. Who can keep a straight face when you see (and more importantly hear) Matt Lucas in the shape of Vicki Pollard ramble on about nothing and anything and nothing again? Or Andy making Lou's days a ""straight keffufle""? And who can sit there claiming not to be laughing their heads of in pure suprise and disgust when Bubbles get naked? And yet again the narration of the series is enough to get me laughing out loud as Tom Baker returns to do an absolutely fantastic job of narrating utter nonsense.

I've heard people mention the monotony of the sketches. Well, season two is not better than season one in that aspect, and it is true that when you've seen one you've seen 'em all. David Walliams in fact commented on that very thing in an interview once: you know exactly what's gonna happen. However, these are characters and indeed sketches, that dosen't wear easily. I've seen them all many times, and I still laugh every time. They are simply funny, no matter how many times you see them (well, within reason of course).

This is more of the best comedy to hit your telly for a long, long time. It dosen't matter whether you're wathcing this solo, with your misses or with the lads, it's always a winner.",1178841600,,1539,4.548736462093863

Writing and acting (all major roles; both male and female characterizations) in sketches that are extremely funny boarding on the obscene.  I still found this show wildly amusing and would highly recommend to those that are amused with the outrageous.

Once again some of the same zany characters are featured and again I still love Vicky Pollard, Marjorie Dawes, and Emily Howard.

  All the best characters from season one return and many more are introduced. The writing seems sharper and the actors melt into their roles so well that SNL actors should take note.

  Claims that the series is ""too repetitive"" I cannot believe. Recurring characters are sketch show staples and you stick with what works while introducing new characters. Something this show does superbly. Without viewer favorites returning, a required familiarity would be lost. The Fat Fighters sketches alone are worth the price of admission.

  This series is raunchy and that is on exhibit in season two. It definitely delivers in the laughs but if stuff like nude fat suits and projectile vomit aren't your bag, then you may not take to some of the sketches.

In the former, we were introduced to these characters, and with each new scene, a new quirk or tidbit was released to us. In the latter, there is no development at all. It is formulaic. The characters basically do the same thing, again and again, without even much of a change in scenery. Messrs. Walliams and Lucas do not challenge themselves to broaden these individuals in the least, which I find all the more egregious because they have an unerring eye for detail. Perhaps the grind of a series is too much for them. It certainly seems that they have stopped caring.

I thought the first season was much more clever - still raunchy, but had a redeeming charm; this second season started just plain crude for the sake of being crude, and only got funny by about the 4th or 5th show.  I have seen this often in season premiers of TV shows, especially The Simpsons: it seems the writers have all summer to come up with the most over-the-top scenarios and line up special guest stars that take away from the natural development of humour.  But as the season goes on they go back to the clever writing that made the show great in the first place.

These are two of the greatest actors I have ever seen, and there's no question I'll be buying and watching Season 3 when it comes out, but at least now I'm prepared to have to suffer through a few episodes first.

Unfortunately I also didn't realize the season was only SIX episodes long!  With two DVDs in the package, as we were finishing up the sixth show on the first disk, and the characters were starting to get funnier and less forced, I popped in the second disk and found only interviews, off-takes and deleted scenes.  Again, no huge deal, but added to the disappointment.

If you're a fan like me you're going to buy this DVD anyway, so I don't know what good this lament will do.  I haven't seen a show as funny as Season 1 in a very long time, so I'm just hoping for better in Season 3.",1156118400,,1491,4.277580071174377

Maggie and Judy - Two respectable old ladies in the lace handkerchief set, but Maggie possesses a particularly delicate stomach. Nice spoof of ""charming"" racism.

Bubbles - Wealthy wife attending a prestigious health spa. Nice parody of the health spa clich, as well as penny pinching and vain rich

It's all very, very funny, but some of the humor borders on bad taste. Definitely not for the weak at heart.

Walliams and Lucas are excellent actors with a knack for accents, but I wish they'd deepen the writing pool a little to help develop a cast of potentially much funnier characters.

Now normally I would keep on moving across the dial, but this ""sight"" made me pause.  I have been hooked ever since.  As an American with an expat English wife, I have come to love English comedy.  Little Britain is English comedy at its best....and absolute worst... I would have it no other way!

Fortunately BBC America has been playing Little Britain for the past year.  They just finished Series 3, which easily builds upon the success of the first two Series which are both currently available on DVD stateside.  I will not go into an exhaustive review of all of 6 sketches, but rest assured that most of your perennial favorites return: Lou & Andy, Daffyd and of course Vicky (ya, but no, buy ya) Pollard.

The second disc in Series 2 is a real treasure.  There is a great behind the scene documentary as well as sketches Matt & David did for England's Comic Relief.  Appearances are made by Elton John, George Michael and Robbie Williams.  There are about 40 minutes of deleted sketches.  Here you will find sketches with familiar characters that they felt where not quite up to par.  Plus, there are a few new characters which I actually thought were hilarious.  The ""Porno"" sketch was great.

Introducing English comedy to my friends has sometimes been hit and miss.  Little Britain has transcended this and has been uniformly accepted as the ""it"" comedy show.  I know that other reviewers have dissed Series 2 because the characters play upon the same themes they did in Series 1.  I disagree.  I believe that because of the amazing abilities of Matt Lucas and David Williams, this is why Series 2 is so good.  I find my self caring more about the characters then the hijinks they get into.  Yes, Andy can walk.  Yes, Vicky is a ""little"" rough around the edges.

2554106,2,B000F7CMSG,"The wait for Little Britain - the Complete Second Series to be released in the U.S. was agonizing.  In the First Series, Matt Lucas and David Walliams proved themselves to be side-splittingly funny and remarkably talented; particularly in being able to present themselves in such a variety of ways so convincingly and so hilariously.  The delivery of most of the characters was done so well I found myself developing a genuine fondness for many of the characters and such a loathing for still many others.  And this speaks nothing to the subject matter.  These blokes throw political correctness out the window by poking fun at virtually every prejudiced group one can think of, but making a point along the way.  That Lucas and Walliams did this in such a bold and hilarious way in the First Series is a tribute to their undeniable and lovable talent.

Why they decided not to tap into this talent for the Second Series I cannot understand.  Instead of clever sketches, the viewer is subjected to skit after skit of 'shock-value' humor.  Sure, some of this good for a reaction, but it departs too much from what made the Little Britain sketches so cherished in the First Series.  Worse than that, the Second Series is plagued by repetition.  New characters and old rely on one funny idea that is played over and over with slight twists that don't really add anything.  This cookie-cutter approach got to the point where five seconds into a sketch the viewer can predict where it is going and how it is going to get there and is left to only hope it gets there sooner than it eventually does.  It made for frustrating viewing given the expectations following the First Series.  There are some very funny moments, but the general sense while watching these episodes was one of disappointment (and perplexity).

I'm still going to get the Third Series when it comes out, but I was almost persuaded not to by these sketches.  What Lucas and Walliams gave us in the First Series was brilliant.  I'm not sure what happened in the Second Series, but it felt as though they opted to take the easy road by being graphic or simply beating to death the characters' idiosyncrasies which, regretfully, had the effect stripping many characters of their magic.  (Marjerie Dawes, Sebastian, Emily Howard, Davydd Thomas, Mr. Mann, and, tragically, Lou and Andy all fall victim to this.) Sometimes the new series works for a quick laugh, but mostly it came across as a dumbed down and rushed sequel to the first series.",1150070400,,2502,4.75462962962963
2554107,2,B000F7CMSG,"Seems like I'm out on a limb here compared to the other reviewers.... I confess that was waiting with bated trousers for the second set of DVD's from Little Britain.  As an ex-pat I was delighted to discover the first series of Little Britain as part of the in-flight entertainment transatlantic flights to and from London.  Getting Little Britain's first season on DVD was one of my best British Comedy purchases (along with The Black Adder set, The Thin Blue Line, Fawlty Towers, Father Ted, all the Eddie Izzard stuff and, most recently, the superb Vicar of Dibley) and I played the hell out of the first season's DVDs because they are superb.  When Little Britain Season Two arrived, I even savoured the moment and put off watching it for several days.  When I did eventually make myself comfortable in front of the DVD player, with a cup of tea and much anticipation, the result was a tremendous disappointment.

David Walliams and Matt Lucas simply retread the tyres on this car - tires if you're American - the slipshod workmanship all the more upsetting since the vehicle is still fairly new.  Not to say there aren't some very funny moments - there are, hence two stars, but every carbon-copy situation seems to have the last drop of comedy squeezed from it then repeated again ad nauseum.  I felt that many of the characters were already approaching over-exposure in season one and I expected some new, original scenarios to be developed.  However, even the new characters seem to be the old ones in new costumes.  For instance, adding Matt Lucas' cross-dressing sidekick to Emily Howard's schtick actually made it less funny than before.  The comedy of repetition can work, but in Season 2, in my opinion, it simply runs out of steam.  There is not enough creative comedic thinking to freshen up the old characters or make the new ones stand out.  The wonderful Margerie Dawes character is so played out in this series that she simply ends up hyper-mean and almost painful to watch.  The end result is that there are no mitigating circumstances that help us sympathise with either the intolerant (Margerie) or the untolerated (her ""fat people"").  Much of the comedy adds up to an increasing feeling of mean-spiritedness which is a shame.  I believe that Walliams and Lucas are both writers with great potential but I suspect that the pressure of repeating their initial successs with Little Britain was overwhelming for them.  They became less inventive and too repetitive on season 2.  Comedy at it's best makes us feel like we've learned something.  Even when The Office threatens to engulf us with it's abject hopelessness for all the characters concerned, it manages to pull something out that is enlightening or instructive, or just damn funny and unexpected.  I barely made it through the complete viewing of Little Britain Series Two as I was constantly glancing over to The Vicar of Dibley DVDs wondering if I should just cut my losses and watch something genuinely funny.  I REALLY wish Matt and David had called Richard Curtis or Ben Elton to help them out with this one!  I wish I'd been the show's executive producer...  Most of these scripts would never have seen the rehearsal studio - much less the set - until they'd added some comedic substance!",1149811200,,3273,4.817531305903399

2554109,5,B000F7CMSG,"Matt Lucas and David Walliams are back and have successfully avoided a sophomore slump with six episodes from the second season of Little Britain. This time the boys have veered deeply into politically incorrect territory with their popular British sketch show. The comedy has moved from subtext and innuendo to a bolder more aggressively offensive humor. They insult lesbians, blacks, women from India, Asians, little people, the homeless . . . and that's the first episode and a half alone. What definitely wouldn't fly on American television is one of the most popular and award winning British hits. If you're easily offended or plan this purchase to play at work then move on, move on, nothing to see here folks. Everything, costumes, makeup, scenery, even the nudity has been ramped up for more audacious look. The new opening titles are even funnier than last season. If you're not familiar with Little Britain then start with the first season to get the flavor and feel and back story of the characters and learn why this is one of the most highly anticipated DVDs in the British Isles.

For fans of the first season some of the characters make return appearances. Vicky Pollard is still a juvenile delinquent, Kenny Craig is still using his hypnotism to exert influence, Dafydd still thinks he's ""the only gay in the village"", Lou is still patiently caring for Andy and oblivious to the fact Andy doesn't need his wheelchair, Sebastian Love still has a crush on the Prime Minister, Marjorie Dawes is still torturing Paul, Mira, Pat, and the whole Fat Fighters gang, Dr. Lawrence still puts too much hope in the assimilation of ""Eh Eh Eaah"" Anne into society, and pint-sized actor Dennis Waterman still wants to ""write the theme tune; sing the theme tune."" Unconvincing transvestite Emily Howard is back as well but this time with an equally unconvincing and mustached ""lady friend"" Florence.

The flute piping, looney Innkeeper of the Ye Olde Hotel in Scotland, the Kelsey Grammar schoolmaster, Royal correspondent Peter Andre, novelist Dame Sally Markham, ex-actor Sir Bernard Chumley, schoolteacher Edward Grant and his young wife and pupil Samantha, Denver Mills the Olympic medalist, Des Kaye the ex-children's television star, and in an act of mercy, Jason -- the bloke who fancies his friend' Gary's grandmother have all disappeared in favor of a host of new characters and sketches.

Below is just a sampling of the new characters you'll meet:

""arghhhhhhhhhhhhhhh""

Judy and Maggie judge the local baking and jam making contests but the flavor of who makes the food always moves Maggie the most.

""Computer says nooo . . . [cough]""

Carol Beer works at the bank and gets all her answers from the computer. One guess as to the answer it always gives.

Ms. ""just call me Bubbles, dahling"" De Vere has been living at the Hill grange Health Spa for over 5 months now and is willing to offer her ample sized body as payment for her ample sized overdue bill. The fat suit Matt Lucas wears is extraordinary.

""How shall I describe him . . . .""

Linda, a guidance counselor at the University of North West Midlands (Formerly Dudley Poly) is always phoning her college, Martin to help the students. The problem comes when she tries to describe the students in the most offensive way possible.

""Bitty!""

Harvey Pincher, a man from an upper crust family who should have given up his mother's ""Bitty!"" long ago. His fianc Jane and her middle class family stand by helplessly not daring to say a word.

""do you have [  ] . . . ?""

In a sketch idea explored briefly last season ""Mr. Man"" enters a store and asks for increasingly more complex, specific, and near impossible to find items. The storekeeper always employs his off screen wife ""Margaret!"" for help.

There are lots of other little skits with minor characters: the psychiatrist whose own big vice is gossip, the restauranteur who orders highbrow dinners but really wants lowbrow foodie pleasures, Viv Tudor the crime victim who can only describe her attackers as ""gorgeous!"" and one woman who is trying to set up one of her girlfriends with a date and always has a revealing picture of him to offer.

The whole shebang is still voiced over by Tom Baker whose narrative is more ridiculous than ever.

The first series DVD was packed full of bonuses and extras and the second series doesn't disappoint. The commentary by David Walliams, Matt Lucas, and producer Geoff Posner is funny and insightful and is included on all 6 episodes. Find out what's been going on in the real Llanddewi Brefi. The Comic Relief sketches are like a whole additional half-hour episode and feature guest appearances by Elton John, George Michael, Robbie Williams, and Simon Callow, there's a ""Little Documentary"" featurette, interviews with Matt Lucas and David Walliams visiting different UK chat shows, and if you really miss Jason and Nanna you'll find them in an ample Deleted Scenes section..

One note, the menu is a bit hard to navigate. The moving picture post cards are a bit hard to read and decipher even with good eyesight and problem solving skills. To select an item from the menu, what you're looking for is an old fashioned style pointer finger.

Travelling from Newcastle station to nearby Sunderland I came across a phenomena where idle youths dressed in track suits and sporting apparent items of Burberry clothes or accessories and almost constsantly talking on mobile phones predominated in towns and on public transport. An old school chum identified this class as ""Chavs"" which would be known in the venacular of the United States as white trash and who is exemplified in Little Britain by Vicky, the archetyal Chav.

Indeed the endearing feature of this series and which is more prominent in Season 2 is the degree to which Britain laughs at itself through the mechanism of Little Britain.  A friend commented to me that a number of the jokes and scenes were very repetitive and the degree of variation between sketches was not that great. While at first, I agreed, after several watchings it is clear that the writers of this show are able to focus on the stupidities which prevail in contempoaray British society. Take the question of cultural assimilation which is so loudly claimed as being the exemplar for other societies to follow. What Little Britain shows us is that the spin is radically different from the reality as indicated by the two ladies sampling different foodstuffs and the reaction of one of them upon discovering the social standing of the maker of that foodstuffs.

Similarly the homophobic attitudes of Daffyd, the only gay in the village. Again the reality being somewhat different from the publi9c persona. Whilst on that theme, some of the most hilarious sketches are about the straight Prime Minister and his gay secretary who has a thing for him. There is a degree of cruelty too particularly in the sketches of the mental patient who's behavious is being supervised by a medical practitioner who clearly has nothing to say in the face of repeated anti-social behaviour by a patient who often indicates every evidence of compos mentis but who perpetrates a fraud on the mental health care policy of the state.

Much of this show can be taken as being offensive and would be if it was not portrayed within the context of Britons laughing at Britain. The effects are heightened by the lush baritone of Tom Baker, better known as the fourth incarnation of everyone's favourite timelord.

All in all a vulgar comedy in the grand British tradition of Carry On and Monty Python yet at the same time, this is certainly a sharp witted social commentary which should make us all think in between all the laughter.",1148688000,,2717,4.882863340563992
2554111,5,B000F7CMSG,"If you liked the first series of ""Little Britain"", you can buy this one without hesitation. As of early May 2006, it hasn't been released in the US yet, so when I received a british copy as a gift, I ran out and bought a region-free DVD player just so I could watch it !

 There are a few more wacky characters this time around, and the existing ones are more outrageous than ever. Some of the skits are so un-politically correct, it would never fly in the U.S, which probably makes it even more fun to watch.

A little more shocking in the ""Bubbles "" character skits, but so funny.. The UK has less censorship than the US. The second disc is not a continuation of the series. It is a documentary of how the series is made with commentary from the actors. I found it interesting but long.",1470528000,,418,4.30379746835443
