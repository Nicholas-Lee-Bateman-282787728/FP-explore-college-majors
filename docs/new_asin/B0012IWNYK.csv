3090680,5,B0012IWNYK,"My wife and I had tickets to the Michael Buble concert on May 4th in Sacramento and we were not aware of the opening act. When we arrived at Arco Arena, we were ushered to the floor seats we had. Already on stage were seven men singing and it wasn't until we settled into our seats and began watching did we realize these men were singing WITHOUT a band or any instruments. My wife is Thai and this was her first American concert and she truly was amazed, as I was. Naturally Seven put on a show that rivals any a capella group I've heard, with a great deal more of range and diversity in music style. They don't keep to music often associated with a capella and delve into other genres, including Simon and Garfunkle and others. Truly inspirational music, too! This is a must-see and though the video is wonderful, hearing them in person is INCREDIBLE!",1211155200,2,853,4.405063291139241
3090681,5,B0012IWNYK,"Live from the Montreux Jazz Festival in Switzerland, this live DVD captures the energy and excitement of a Naturally 7 show.",1206662400,2,124,4.9523809523809526
3090682,5,B0012IWNYK,"My wife and I were fortunate enough to get tickets to the Michael Buble concert in Jacksonville during Feb 2008.  The warmup act was Naturally 7.  Never before have I felt that I would have loved seeing the warmup act do an entire concert.  The combination of their amazing ""Vocal Play"" style and the following astoundingly classy performance that Buble gives, made this the best concert experience of my entire life.

The DVD is decently high quality, though not as good as it could be.  The quality of the performance that these seven guys provide is more than enough to make up for tiny issues with the DVD editing and such.  They are truly incredible!",1206662400,10,655,4.6521739130434785

8246166,5,B0012IWNYK,Amazing group,1410825600,,13,6.0
8246167,3,B0012IWNYK,"It was good,but obviously earlier in their career,",1407196800,,50,5.375
8246168,5,B0012IWNYK,"I actually have two copies of this DVD. Believing I had lost the first, I repurchased it ... then found the first, which I had bought after seeing the group on the Quincy Jones 50th Anniversary Live at Montreux DVD. As a Creative Writing and English high-school teacher, I have shown it to my classes and organized follow-up exercises on it.
I have seen the DVD over five times and discovered something new everytime. It's truly a fabulous performance!!!",1370390400,,454,4.7594936708860756
8246169,5,B0012IWNYK,"I was introduced to Naturally 7 as they opened for Michael Buble. Already a fan of A Cappella and vocal play groups, these guys completely blew my mind. To hear them is one thing - to SEE them perform, knowing that they use no instruments whatsoever is just unreal. Humble to the core, they give thanks to God for their gifts but don't shove their beliefs at you. It shows in their music. I highly recommend this DVD so you can see as well as hear this wonderfully talented group.",1325289600,,480,4.344444444444444
8246170,5,B0012IWNYK,"I have some male singers who are interested in forming an all male singing group.  Naturally 7 is one of the groups I introduced them to.  Of course, they had not heard of this group but, they could identify with this contemporary group (their singing, their style of performance and their attire).",1324339200,,298,4.711538461538462
8246171,5,B0012IWNYK,Saw them live in NO and DVD certainly does them justice. Hard to describe--needs to be seen!,1281398400,,92,4.470588235294118
8246172,5,B0012IWNYK,"One of the best groups you'll ever see. Their sounds are AMAZING!!! I saw them live at the Michael Buble Crazy Love Tour in Tampa 2010, and was astounded. They are truly talented. So I bought this DVD to show to my family and friends, and although it is not like seeing them live, it is a wonderful DVD. Must see!",1271289600,,313,4.147540983606557
8246173,4,B0012IWNYK,I had never really heard of this group before I saw a video clip on them. Their performance on this DVD is simply amazing. I'm impressed and now look for music that they have worked on.,1252886400,,185,4.166666666666667
8246174,1,B0012IWNYK,Received post Xmas and returned and refunded. Tried to cancel within hours of ordering once discovered would not be received for Christmas but system would not allow this. Cost me return postage.,1231891200,,195,5.125
8246175,5,B0012IWNYK,"These guys are great, and it's even more exciting to SEE it rather than just listening.  Saw them in concert-Awsome!
It's really different, but really good.  I bought the CD ""What Is It?"" and the Christmas CD.  Give them a listen!",1226275200,4,230,4.560975609756097
