5737822,5,B00CSW0792,"So let's say you're a movie maker and you wanted to know how a 3D movie should look.  This would be one of the movies you'd use as reference material.  To say the film is stunning in 3D would be underestimating how great it looks in 3D.  I own around 20 3D movies, this movie is now my new reference disc to show what 3D looks like in the home.  This is right up there with what I think is the best 3D movies ever made Space Station 3D and Avatar.  As if you couldn't tell, I can't recommend this movie enough for people looking for great 3D content.",1375747200,12,550,4.009174311926605

Great use of 3D.
Dropping down the step at Shipsterns in first person 3D was something out of a dream for me.
Recieved this bluray super fast in great condition.
Well worth it!",1408147200,2,247,4.391304347826087

5737833,3,B00CSW0792,I really liked it for a while and yes the 3d effects are worth buying it for but maybe it's just that I'm not an avid surfer. If you are you're going to love this film. For the normal Joe however it gets a little boring/repetitious. Again maybe it's just a lack of real intense interest in the subject matter but it's a little tedious unless you're into surfing.,1391126400,2,362,4.260869565217392
5737834,5,B00CSW0792,incredibly intense and well made..a 3d must see even if you don't surf ..tom carroll and ross clarke-jones are certifiably insane in pursuit of their passion of finding giant killer waves no one has every ridden before all over the world and putting the viewer in the action with great camera work and story telling..awesome footage shot entirely with 3d cameras...easily one of the best 3d presentations to date...,1388102400,2,415,5.028985507246377

We have a normal 2D LCD screen, so I can't comment on the 3D aspect of the BD, but it looks very clean and crisp in plain old 2D. And more important is that not only is the (Way) Down Under big wave footage excellent and the shots of exotic breaks that almost never go off a real treat, but the exemplary friendship of Tom and Ross is what really makes this a fine film.

Yes, there are some stunning waves here---Tom is a master at big Pipe; Pedra Branca, Cape Solander and Shipsterns are insanely massive and clean; the new mid-ocean break Turtle Dove is a no-lineup freakshow---and the footage is so good that I winced every time one of them eats it on yet another monster wave. Ross' tumble over the falls at Solander is something else, as is Tom's at Cow Bombie when his jetski also heads over the crest and they both hit the 25-foot washing cycle. But my favorite bits are Tom and especially Ross talking about their love of surfing and each other. Clarke-Jones is just a hoot, balls out at all times, and his bit about being held under big waves making him drift into reveries of clubbing is pricelessly funny, one of the best non-surf bits in any of the dozens of surf flicks I've seen. As is his line about Carroll's having three daughters and a wife making him ""become a girl"". He smiles as he says this, knowing that Tom will stake his life for him on any 60-foot wave they can hunt down.

Carroll's love of his family, and him talking about why he's still willing to risk it all on the big waves, juxtaposed with Clarke-Jones' sheer adrenaline freak attitude make for good entertainment as well as many thought-provoking moments. These aren't just minor adventures, they're insanely huge waves that could easily snap the necks or backs of even legendarily talented surfers like these two. But they need the speed and the rush and the thrill of the chase, which is explored in more depth than usual for most surf films, and the planning of each trip with their wave-seeking weather guy is also quite interesting.

The fact that they're both almost 50 is no small detail either; to be able to ride waves this big for that long is a serious achievement. These two are true surf legends, old kids at heart who've never stopped playing at the highest level of their sport. And their attitudes are so good.

The BD extras are pretty skint, only about 20 minutes' worth, a short doc on the film and also one each for Tom and Ross and a few others, nothing special but not bad. Still, come on boys, surely you could have dropped in another half hour at least of wipeouts and other stuff, especially Clarke-Jones outtakes, which must be numerous, hilarious and continuous.

Yet it's the overall arc of the film's story of the long brotherhood between these two veteran Aussie wavemen that makes this such a unique surf film. There's only maybe 25 minutes total of wave footage, and as great as some of those waves are, and as distant from civilization, the real hook here is two guys laying their lives on the line for each other year after year after year. That's a pretty cool story, whether in 2D or 3D.",1386028800,2,3120,4.474516695957821
5737836,5,B00CSW0792,"Great film, truly amazing in 3D!  These guys are truly nuts and to do prep all of those days just to get a day of surfing, you gotta marvel at their dedication!",1385942400,,160,4.0
5737837,5,B00CSW0792,"SPECTACULAR! One of the best uses of 3D technology yet. If you love the ocean and 3D you're going to REALLY love this movie.

The crystal clear 3D is so real you almost expect the waves to roll out of your flatscreen and get you wet!

Very interesting story about two middle-aged surfers - but the visuals are the hook here.

Get ready for a great ride!!!!",1384992000,,356,4.2835820895522385
5737838,5,B00CSW0792,"A must for 3D enthusiasts. Towering waves slam down on you, surfers speed at you and zoom past at the last second. Nature itself is at fast work in this doc that rarely slows down. If you like 3D, and you enjoy the ocean, then make this part of your collection. Not only is it great fun, it can also be very relaxing.",1382832000,,317,4.0476190476190474

5737840,4,B00CSW0792,"I have criticized many of the new 3D movies for lack of 3D planning and execution by the videographers and cinematographers.  I have an extensive knowledge of 3D and how to effectively shoot it from years of experience practicing with the various methods etc.  As I have stated many times, the one problem I see most in the recent films is that the convergence window frame is usually set too far forward (toward the audience) causing great depth behind the screen, but very little in front.  And, it is the objects in front of the screen that the audiences love to see.  Flaming arrows do not have to be shot out into the audience, but simple objects (not even moving) but seemingly floating just in front of you is one of the wonders of good 3D and what made it so popular in the 1950's.  Because the 3D technology was new - the early films of the 50's really exhibited great 3D cinematography - each shot was effectively planned for effect and it obviously paid off.  Now, it seems, the new cinematographers have a one-set convergence no matter what they are shooting and miss out on more than half of the effective 3D shots they could have achieved with some thought and planning.

This film places the convergence frame correctly for the most part and gives a very strong 3D image that is very effective.  So, I have to strongly differ with the review stating the 3D isn't good - it is extremely good.  And for using very small 3D cameras to boot - it is better than I would have guessed it could be.  I can only think that the dissatisfied reviewer has not correctly set up his 3D system.

If you are not into wave running - then 90+ minutes may become a drag.  But the 3D is great and the waves really are amazing.

Oh, and LJ - I really have no connection with this film - I promise!",1379721600,13,1791,4.358433734939759
