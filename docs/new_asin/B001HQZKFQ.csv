8309373,1,B001HQZKFQ,UnWatchable.  The sound recording of the concert is beyond bad.  After the first song I stopped watching.  I bought this based on the Album which is amazing.  I don't understand Why the film sound track on Amazon is so distorted ?,1522800000,,230,4.536585365853658

8309375,1,B001HQZKFQ,"Great concert but I agree with other reviewer, there is something wrong with the audio on this streaming version. It seems as if you are only getting the surround mix, which does fade in and out.

I have the blu-ray version (5 stars) and it is perfection. I bought this on a whim while travelling so I could watch it on a flight. I can't believe Amazon has not fixed the problem with this version of the video.",1462665600,,410,4.256410256410256
