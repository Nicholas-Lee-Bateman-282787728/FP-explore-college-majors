First down with the sickness DVD I've gotten from cz dub and it did not disappoint. Pick it up and enjoy!",1478736000,,280,4.403846153846154

8240406,1,B00114UUB8,"This is not a documentary, and it is not a historical account. It is a hyped-up, made-for-TV series.

They group the episodes by certain battles, but they are not in any logical order. For any particular episode/battle, they show some real footage related to the location, but the footage is not related to that particular battle...it's just footage from the country location in general. The rest of the show is re-enactments and interviews.

The docudrama style re-enactments are obviously fake. There are a lot of shaky handheld re-enactment shots. They use a lot ""attention grabbing"" film techniques. They aren't telling stories here, they are making-up stories...and it seems the taller they can make the stories, the better. Checkout some scenes on youtube by searching for 7Y10FR4Vry4 or njbTLYSh1bM.

Five-star General and President Dwight D. Eisenhower had this to say about war: ""I hate war as only a soldier who has lived it can, only as one who has seen its brutality, its futility, its stupidity.""

Combat Zone is just the opposite. The way Combat Zone is produced/directed, it sensationalizes and glorifies war. The music is hyped--it's mostly rock and acid rock. They are trying to make the battles seem ""cool"". That's bad.

The way Combat Zone is produced/directed, it seems more like a recruiting commercial for the military; and it reminds me of propaganda. In my opinion, it's not watchable. There is more fiction than fact.

8240407,5,B00114UUB8,I ordered this DVD after having seen this series on the Military Channel.  I would recommend this for anyone interested in military history as it portrays several important battles in our nation's history.,1369353600,2,205,5.212121212121212
8240408,5,B00114UUB8,"I ordered this DVD because one of my life long buddies is featured in one of the battles. My buddy has never spoken to me about the event and he's never seen the story but I believe he received a medal of valor for his actions. I don't get Discovery or the Military channel so I'd never seen Combat Zone. I first watched the segment about my buddy on-line then knew I had to have a copy. The writers and directors have done an excellent job on all of the stories told here. The stories are told with footage, and production interspersed with personal interviews. The DVD quality is excellent although the camera work is somewhat raw (as it should be). My husband and I watched tale after tale with awe, amazement and gratitude. We have a 20 year old son in the Marines. Watching these stories helped illustrate for us what it takes to fight up close and personal. The men in these stories are skilled, courageous, and sometimes just plain lucky but all are dedicated. I recommend this DVD to anyone who respects and appreciates the service of our men and women, and accepts the reality that war is a necessary evil.",1320019200,2,1115,4.470588235294118
8240409,5,B00114UUB8,"Watch with amazement with live accounts , footage  and reinactments of what the American soldier deals with in major military confrontation. Put down the video game and understand the costs of freedom. I really like the information this series provides. Our troops have always been amaxing people and this will show you why. MUST SEE ! and God Bless the USA",1247097600,9,357,4.852459016393443
8240410,5,B00114UUB8,"CZ does a great job of giving you a good look at various firefights throughout modern history.  Fights are recreated and intermixed with actual combat footage, and interviews with the guys who were actually on the ground doing the fighting.  This is not your grandfathers war documentary.  The show moves at a fast pace and is really focused more on the combat action itself.  Similar to Battlefield 360, computer generated graphics supplement the narration and gives the viewer a good 360 degree view of the battlespace, which really offers a unique and clear perspective of how things unfold during a particular engagement.  You get the entire series in single boxed set, so it's really a nice DVD series to own for any modern military history buff.",1240704000,13,751,4.928571428571429
