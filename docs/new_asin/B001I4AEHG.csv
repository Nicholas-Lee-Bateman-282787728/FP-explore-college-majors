8310462,1,B001I4AEHG,"If you're still reading, I'll basically say the same thing again:

WHATEVER this DVD is sold for, it's overpriced. I paid twenty-five for it and in no way does the content or quality justify the cost.  In fact, this CD should simply be placed in a sleeve on the back page of the Survival of the 21st Century Planetary Healing Manual (at no extra charge)that I purchased.

The DVD REALLY IS simply a marketing tool for the Planetary Healers Manual. Apparently, the DVD was recorded around 1998 so perhaps Debra Secunda's hair and wardrobe is just extremely dated.

Nothing presented in the video is REVOLUTIONARY, LIFE-ALTERING, or any other description that the dubious other reviews mention.  Basically, someone took some basic VHS footage and digitized it.  Yeah, he's speaking at a seminar, but it's ultimately to promote the Planetary Healer's Manual (he's also wearing colors to match the book).

Instead of watching this DVD, check out Viktoras Kulvinskas - Rawkathon 2008 with Kevin Gianni for FREE ON THE NET and read Kulvinskas' book.  The Rawkathon video is a lot more interesting. It's also more like what you're probably expecting this video will discuss.

You'll also want to check out ""Nutrition and Physical Degeneration"" (Price), and all of Ann Wigmore's stuff which obviously influenced Kulvinskas' and is relevant to his work.

As far as Viktoras making raw food recipes on the video, you'll find similar, if not better and visually more appealing recipes on you tube.

At the very least, you'll save yourself ""almost 2 hours"", and for whatever price rascals are trying to peddle this DVD off on you.

But if you HAVE to have it, I'll sell you mine, for half of the lowest price it's listed for on this site.",1341100800,9,1726,4.873287671232877
8310463,5,B001I4AEHG,"Viktoras Kulsvinskas is the most important biochemical researcher of our time.  I will leave it to history to verify my estimation here.  Admittedly, my view is predjudiced. The man saved my life back in the 1970's when information about a breatharian-sproutarian-fruitarian raw vegan diet was far less widely disseminated.  If you seek healing, rejuvination - life - look no futher.  Remember, above all, despite all the negative stuff you might read on the internet, Viktoras is not scientistic, but a scientist of the highest order.",1318636800,2,535,5.258823529411765
8310464,5,B001I4AEHG,"Viktoras packs an enormous amount of great info on raw lifestyle and staying healthy in Viktoras' no-holds-barred style.  He's amazing!  I also loved the part of the DVD with Viktoras retro style from 10 years ago, before I knew about him.  He's truly an icon.  Thanks for making this DVD!",1247097600,4,289,4.72
8310465,5,B001I4AEHG,"I have the extreme pleasure of knowing and working with Viktoras for the past year - he walks his talk and shares his wealth of information lovingly and with great attention to detail.  A chef, teacher, and founder of this movement, he emanates a vibrant and intelligent energy.  I learned a great deal from this DVD and it's on permanent rotation in my kitchen.  Lots of helpful tips to assist you in transitioning to a raw and living foods lifestyle.  He has been raw for over 30 years, co-founded the Ann Wigmore institute, has created enzyme products and is a healer.  I have found him personally to be a caring, loving individual who truly wishes to assist others.  Buy this DVD and give yourself the gift of self care!",1245196800,4,724,4.573643410852713
8310466,5,B001I4AEHG,"I had a pleasure of working alongside Viktoras Kulvinskas on several occasions in the past and I must say - this man is brilliant. The vastness of knowledge he possesses about everything health, nutrition, personal development, and spirituality never seizes to amaze me.

This DVD consists of 3 parts:

1. Intro to Raw, filmed at New Life Expo in NYC in 1998: short but very informative piece on benefits of eating raw, live foods, why they are important for our health, and a quick overview of various raw food dishes Viktoras prepared for his upcoming talk (veggies, dips, crackers, nori rolls).

2. Raw Recipes demo, which was part of previously released VHS ""Raw Food Fest with Viktoras Kulvinskas"", a lovely class that Viktoras and Debra Secunda (the creator of the DVD) hosted at the same New Life Expo. Recipes like Rivers of Life, Sufi Rolls, Red Festivity Dressing, and some others are spiced up by personal stories and  jokes that Viktoras is so full of (did I mention he has a wonderful sense of humor?).

3. Raw Survival lecture, filmed in NYC in 2008 at Bonobo's restaurant (which I had a pleasure of attending). This lecture will be a cherry on top of your raw cake - frankly, one of the best Viktoras' lectures I have attended. He covers a wide range of topics, from how childhood diseases develop, to functional nutrition, to meditation and its benefits. Viktoras is a walking encyclopedia of knowledge, and every time he gives a lecture he tries to give you as much information as he possibly can - and every lecture he gives is a pure stream of consciousness. Viktoras never uses notes, he just goes with the flow, moving from one topic onto another almost unnoticeably.

This DVD is a must have, a valuable addition to any collection of educational DVDs. Give it as a gift of health to someone you know who's dealing with health challenges. Watch it yourself and share it with your family. This DVD will, without a doubt, expand your knowledge about your health tremendously and possibly change your life.",1229904000,12,2024,4.752136752136752
8310467,5,B001I4AEHG,"I've read a lot of info on raw nutrition but this DVD seems to outline everything from a source of higher intelligence. Suddenly everything I'm trying to achieve by eating better makes sense, I can't wait to integrate
this information from Raw Survival into my eating plan, also for my family members.
This year I'm not waiting for New Years to start a healthy eating resolution.
Thanks!",1228003200,5,387,4.791044776119403
