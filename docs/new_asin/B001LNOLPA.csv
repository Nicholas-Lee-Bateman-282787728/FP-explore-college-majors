3688266,4,B001LNOLPA,"This I'm sure was a made for TV movie by the BBC back in the 70's. It features a good story as the background and mainly relies on the acting without any special effects. Basically in early times when Britain was still divided into multiple kingdoms, three royal crowns were buried near the coastline of Britain as part of some supernatural ritual using black magic which would somehow guarantee that the island of Britain could not be invaded as long as at least one of the crowns stayed buried. That's already enough to make any history buffs laugh since the Danes under King Canute successfully invaded the island and held nearly all of England for about 200 years.

  Treasure hunters over time learn about the crowns and one that is known. There is one family living near one of the crowns that protects it by driving off anyone who is there to take it. Apparently even after death one of their ghosts reappears to protect the crown. I don't want to give away to much more, but that's the basic synopsis. It is an interesting story and has a good moody 70's soundtrack to it. I don't think the picture has been remastered but it looks good enough, and the sound definitely has not been but you just have to turn it up a bit.

  So if you're a fan of British horror and thriller from the 70s this is a good one you'll be interested in. There is no blood or gore or monsters. The British TV and film makers seem to do more with a good story with less money.",1344124800,,1460,4.349264705882353
3688267,5,B001LNOLPA,"The setting - between The War to End All Wars and World War Two.  The plot - a crown that keeps England safe is guarded from those who would steal it.  The story - somebody comes to steal it.  Gee, not very interesting...or is it?  As with most BBC dramas, it isn't the story as much as the actors that draws you to it.  The way they emote, walk, talk, and fit into the setting makes you want to watch the DVD again and again.  And I have!
And, as many of the others have pointed out, it will not make you jump, but it may make your kids demand a night light.  Bwuahahahahaha!
Peter Vaughan is one of those actors that the BBC could not do without.  He is in everything, including&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Brazil-The-Criterion-Collection-Single-Disc-Editon/dp/B000G8NXZA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Brazil - The Criterion Collection - (Single Disc Editon)</a>.

3688268,4,B001LNOLPA,"An exceptionally scary short film, made on a no budget yet thousands of times more frightening than modern slasher fare. The desolate Norfolk broads (an expansion of a river) act as a setting for this truly macabre tale in which an archaeologist is chased by a vengeful spirit after stealing a buried crown. Very hard to find today, the cheap film stock used gives the movie a grainy, realistic look. Definitely a case of ""less is more"", this is without a doubt a 100% perfect realization of the original M.R. James story, and he would be proud.",1244246400,22,545,4.628865979381444
8318890,1,B001LNOLPA,Another fairly dire video transfer from the folks at Sinister Cinema not quite on a par with VHS quality.,1436572800,,105,4.578947368421052
8318891,5,B001LNOLPA,"Scary and extremely atmospheric. Recommend for horror fans. Straightforward horror, well made on the English coast.",1430524800,,115,6.25
8318892,5,B001LNOLPA,"As a fan of M.R. James and his ghost stories, I was pleasantly surprised at how well this short film was done. An excellent cast and steady, quiet pacing made this story as creepy to watch as it was to read. I highly recommend it for anyone who enjoys classic, atmospheric horror tales.",1428710400,,286,4.415094339622642
8318893,4,B001LNOLPA,Great picture and sound. I would give it five stars if it had been longer. This could have been one of the all time best mystery stories if the producer of the move had not been lazy or maybe he or she just did not have the money to develop the story. This you can be sure of. What you get is better than most British movies. I hope to watch it over and over. I suppose this is one of those rare movies where you get to add to it within your mind as to what a great one it could have been.,1413763200,,489,3.7115384615384617
8318894,4,B001LNOLPA,"A good chiller. This is full of atmospheric, foreshadowing and dread. Its wonderful for a winter evening's night.",1406073600,,113,5.333333333333333
8318895,3,B001LNOLPA,"An interesting idea about the three hidden crowns that keep England safe--but the tale could have done with a lot more depth.  The characters were thinly drawn, and the surprises few.  OK for a short sit-down with a cuppa.",1402185600,,222,4.666666666666667
8318896,5,B001LNOLPA,"M.R. James is one of my favorite ghost story writers, and ""A Warning to the Curious"" is one of my favorite tales by him. Of course, no movie can ever turn out quite the way you imagined the story to look like. But this little film does capture the essence of this creepy store. The sets and cinematography very much reminded me of another great ghost movie, the Japanese classic, ""Ugetsu."" This film was shot in places that would make you nervous even without a ghost.",1394928000,5,468,4.453488372093023
8318897,5,B001LNOLPA,"Montague Rhodes James ranks as my all-time favorite author of the supernatural. I first became acquainted with his works when my uncle got me his collected works as a birthday gift. I was only ten at the time but I loved reading and I was absolutely bewitched by his stories of the supernatural, not to mention terrified! I've revisited James' works over the years and it was only recently that I began to wonder if there were any TV or movie adaptations of his works.

By chance I was surfing on Youtube and came across a BBC series titled ""A Ghost Story for Christmas"" that featured adaptations of several of M.R. James' works (the show also featured an adaptation of a short story by Charles Dickens, i.e. The Signalman, as well as original screenplays by Clive Exton and John Bowen). BBC's A Ghost Story for Christmas ran between the years 1971 and 1978. Here is a list of the episodes in the series:
The Stalls of Barchester (1971) - adapted from a short story by M.R. James
A Warning to the Curious (1972) - adapted from a short story by M.R. James
Lost Hearts (1973) - adapted from a short story by M.R. James
The Treasure of Abbot Thomas (1974) - adapted from a short story by M.R. James
The Ash Tree (1975) - adapted from a short story by M.R. James
The Signalman (1976) - adapted from a story by Charles Dickens
Stigma (1977) - written by Clive Exton
The Ice House (1978) - written by John Bowen

More recent revivals:
A View From a Hill (2005) - adapted from a short story by M.R. James
Number 13 - adapted from a short story by M.R. James

""A Warning to the Curious"" is highly atmospheric, and its setting, filmed around the North Norfolk coastline certainly enhances the narrative. The dramatization does differ in parts from the source work. Here the main character is not a young man as portrayed in James' story, but an older man fallen on hard times, and the role of Paxton is played by Peter Vaughan. Paxton is obsessed with finding the legendary crowns of Anglia, and uses his amateur archaeological skills to find the treasure. From the beginning, one senses that this is not going to turn out favorably, and the menacing atmosphere is palpable throughout the episode. The dramatization for the most part retains the essence of the source work and I rate this as one of my favorite adaptations in this series.",1390780800,3,2329,4.54047619047619
