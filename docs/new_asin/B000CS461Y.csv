8101576,5,B000CS461Y,I bought this for my husband who is a retired detective and is now teaching a CSI class.  A great video for the students.  This is one of the few episodes of Modern Marvels that is not available on their website.,1384473600,,212,4.146341463414634
8101577,2,B000CS461Y,"Its giving a 43 min (YES not 50 min) insight into their most fancy lab F.B.I /150 million dollar building with 700 workers.
Its superficial, and gives nothing i didn't knew already anyway, for some new into this? then it might show you around the facility with short shallow observations on the themes as gun ballistic and fingerprints and such very vidid and not into details, whatever it might be, very little forensic informations was to be found on my behalf seeing it.

8101578,4,B000CS461Y,"I really liked this DVD.  I thought it was very interesting to learn about the history of the FBI crime lab.  The DVD goes though several different units within the FBI crime lab, including ballistics, trace, and DNA.  I bought it to show in my forensics classroom, but the students were not impressed with it.  I guess it's for an older age group.",1226016000,3,348,4.476190476190476
8101579,2,B000CS461Y,"""The FBI Crime Lab"" provided little specifics on how its equipment worked, and was slow-moving and boring.

The DVD began describing its new facility (4X the size of former space) in Quantico, VA., costing $150 million, using nearly 700 employees, and taking in about 600 pieces of evidence/day.  The FBI started forensics services in 1932.

Viewers then receive a brief overview of the lab's various units:  Firearms and Tool Marks, Explosives Unit, Latent Print Unit (utilizes 80 different processes for finding and examining prints), DNA Unit (both nuclear (2 copies/cell) and mitochondrial (many more copies/cell), Chemistry and Trace Evidence Unit (eg. hairs, fibers, etc.), and its Hazardous Scene Response Units (protective suits, robots).",1221955200,5,746,5.575221238938053
8101580,5,B000CS461Y,History Channel brings very informative subjects to our livingrooms. We need more of this and less T.V. We sat with rapt attention looking at this movie. I felt it was very worthwhile in money and time !,1172534400,,203,4.513513513513513
