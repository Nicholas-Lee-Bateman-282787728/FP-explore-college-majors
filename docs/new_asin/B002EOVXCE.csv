3918471,3,B002EOVXCE,"I purchased Man Stroke Woman dvd's because of some of the skits I saw on [..]. The dvd was ok, they obviously just put the funniest ones on youtube, which I can look at for free. The dvd was ok,but definitely not worth the high price. I wish I could get my money back.",1277424000,,268,3.9814814814814814
3918472,5,B002EOVXCE,"There are moments of sublime idiocy in this series that leave you wondering how the sexes EVER get together--others that leave you wondering how we, as a species, manage to get out of bed in the morning, tie our shoes, much less go out and earn our daily bread . . .

From the slacker who casually informs his ex-girlfriend that he's now the King of Spain (he's got a business card that says so -- see?) to the lady whose wardrobe choices leave her husband gasping, to that MINOR incident of cannibalism, these sketches will often leave you gasping for breath, limp with laughter, and more than once with your jaw on the floor.

God knows the cast helps -- to most Americans, Nick Frost will be the most familiar name, but by the time you finish the second disc, you will have become a firm fan of his colleagues here; Nick Burns, Meredith McNeill, Amanda Abbington, and the wonderful double act of Daisy Haggard and Ben Crompton, whose timing and inflections are truly exquisite.

Another great extra here are the episode commentaries -- sometimes to the point, more than once wandering off onto tangents.  At some point or another, the entire cast, as well as director Ric Cantor and the series producer Ash Atalla, participate, and their sometimes-prickly, often riotous interaction demonstrates that the hilarity of this show was no fluke -- this is the work of seriously funny people . . .",1277078400,12,1394,4.677551020408163
3918473,5,B002EOVXCE,My entire family loves this series. Too funny! I wouldn't recommend it to anyone for family viewing with kids under 13...some very adult humor at times. But we are huge fans of this show on-line and now we have them all...excellent!,1257984000,,232,4.682926829268292
3918474,5,B002EOVXCE,"I found out about this show much later than most, through little clips online.  Well, I liked them so much I wanted to see more.  This show is definitely worth the money.  And it has deepened my appreciation for British comedy.  While I am not a fan of Monty Python, I do love the Office (both versions), and ManStrokeWoman has added to that love.  All the players are great, although I must admit a special appreciation for Nick Frost (just so funny) and Daisy Haggard (really cute!)

Not much more to say.  If you like funny shows, buy this.  It's worth it.  And in retrospect, only doing two seasons (or series) can be good, because a show can stay good, and not end up jumping the shark, like so many of our beloved American sitcoms.

Enjoy!",1257897600,5,745,4.411764705882353
3918485,5,B002EOVXCE,"Very hilarious, phenomenal skits. We really enjoyed this series, and lend it out to friends so they can be in on the jokes!",1390003200,,123,4.391304347826087
3918486,1,B002EOVXCE,I didn't think it was the least bit funny and I am a big nick frost fan the whole thing was lame,1383782400,,96,3.409090909090909
3918487,3,B002EOVXCE,It not really funny. It is entertaining but not laugh out loud funny. For what I paid totally worth it.,1381708800,,103,4.2
3918488,4,B002EOVXCE,"This is a BBC sketch comedy, and I found that some of the sketches (primarily those which rely upon the British sense of propriety for their humor) fell flat with me.  When this show is funny, however, it is REALLY funny.  I've shared the ""Man Cold"" sketch with a lot of people!  Please be aware that a lot of the humor is deliberately vulgar, and sometimes violent; this is not a show to share with young children.",1374796800,,415,4.363636363636363
3918489,5,B002EOVXCE,"From the last episode of the first season onward, it's simply brilliant. If you buy it, don't give up quickly...it's worth it...",1369353600,,128,4.863636363636363
3918490,5,B002EOVXCE,This was a really great show and the skits put tv shows on now to shame. I just watch it over.,1367193600,,94,3.5238095238095237
3918491,4,B002EOVXCE,"Many funny sketches, some cross a line that some might find offensive....not me! There are some smart. clever sketches and others are just plain hilarious. (one or two snoozers, and one might get old after a couple of times....) Overall pleased with it and recommend it to others, especially fans of BBC comedies.",1359849600,,313,4.9245283018867925

3918493,5,B002EOVXCE,"This is one of the best British comedies I've seen, for my personal tastes at least. It's a bit dark, cruel, ironic, and smart. Its comedy lasts, I've often emailed skits to friends (exploding dog the most), and have had friends I've introduced this series to send me skits. This is Nick Frost at his best, though often, in my opinion, I've seen him mostly at his worst; don't get me wrong, he makes a great goofy yet often annoying side kick with Simon Peg, yet in this show, he stands on his own two, and stands very well (what does that mean?)

Many of the other cast members, those who might not be too recognizable by name, are, however, recognizable by their many other appearances in other British comedies.

I highly recommend this show.",1317686400,,745,4.511111111111111
3918494,5,B002EOVXCE,"I'm not usually a fan of British comedy, but this had me rolling on the floor laughing in the first two minutes.

Each episode is a compilation of random (and quite short) comedic situations where the actors always play different characters. You can watch these in any order you want - there's no storyline to worry about.

It's definitely worth having in your comedy collection.",1317081600,,379,4.815384615384615

8367901,5,B002EOVXCE,"Great set for a great show. Many more extras than I expected. Wish it was available as a Blu-Ray and better resolution / quality, but I'll take what I can get.",1493251200,,159,4.161290322580645
8367902,2,B002EOVXCE,"British humor more or less beaten to death.  A few marvelously funny bits, mixed in with lame skits that go on far too long -- they would have worked for three minutes, but many of them not only go on well past that but actually become repeating ""bits"" from one show to the next.  I got up to about my fifth ""Oh no not this again"" before I ejected the disk and put it in the charity box.  Maybe some British person will buy it from the thrift store and think it's funny.  We can only hope.",1491782400,,489,4.010309278350515
8367903,2,B002EOVXCE,"A wonderful cast is mostly wasted in this series.  Far too many of the sketches are surprisingly unfunny, made worse by being repeated in slight variations over and over again.  Maybe one out of ten will generate any laughs, which is a terrible rate.  I only wish the show was as amusing and unpredictably zany as the actor commentaries.",1467072000,,337,4.677966101694915
8367904,4,B002EOVXCE,"The first season was hilarious!  Not as fond of the 2nd, but love this DVD--couldn't see it anywhere else because it's not available anywhere. Definitely worth a watch if you like quirky British humor (humour).",1448150400,,210,5.0

8367908,5,B002EOVXCE,"I feel as though it is an acquired taste, but if you like ""stupid funny"", then it's hilarious. It's different, but great, not for everyone though.",1398297600,,146,4.653846153846154
