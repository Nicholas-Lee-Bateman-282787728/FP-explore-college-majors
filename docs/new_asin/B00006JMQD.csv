1781624,4,B00006JMQD,I think this is a great series for the younger children. Very entertaining and good story plots.,1286236800,,96,4.705882352941177

1781626,5,B00006JMQD,"Not the same as the first movie at all, but goes along with the second movie and  is nice for a multi episode TV show. I still have not finished watching all the episodes but still kind of like what I see. One item that is in the show is that the mother is alive then dies in the hospital after an auto accident. The mother is never ever alive in the movies and if I remember the book she was never alive in the book either. Still, it is fun to just watch a movie or tv show with out having to think about it.",1259798400,2,509,3.80188679245283
1781627,2,B00006JMQD,"...but it basically fails on almost every level.  It takes the name of ""The Neverending Story"", but shares very little with the book.  This raises the first question, which is: why make a ""re-imagining"" when the book is filled with so much stuff that has yet to be put to film?  Most of the altered plot really does nothing to enhance the story.  It is pretty much boring drivel that takes away from the themes in the book.

For example, naming is an important theme that is well explored through the danger to the child-like empress.  Making an agent from Fantasia disappear by erasing his name just debases the idea.  Similarly the constant incursions into the real world from Fantasia make little sense, and screws up the idea that Fantasia is a fantasy world.

These incursions are a perfect example of the bad plot changes.  Most of them make little sense, especially the constant failure of Xayide's agents to recover the book from Bastion.  At many times they are just staring at the book, and they could just take it, but don't.  If, like Oren, the book cannot be lost or stolen (and I never noticed them mention it to be so) they never really ask him or try to leverage it either.

The plot changes also bring in a bunch of annoying characters.  Fly Girl is a boring name for a badly written character, and the rat-faced salesman is no better.  For some reason, all the kids at Bastion's school are about 5 years older and at least a foot taller.  Coriander is now a wizard, but typically waivers between impotence and omnipotence.  The G'mork just kind of looks retarded.

The casting is problematic too.  There is nothing child-like about the child-like empress.  In fact, she looks like a failed beauty pageant freak, far from the innocent dignity of the girl in the original movie.  There is nothing even remotely menacing about the evil queen Xayide.  In any case, they both share bad writing and expressionless acting.  Most of the other main characters, however, are both cast and portrayed fairly well.

The sets do seem impressive at first.  However they increasingly follow the story into making Fantasia into some sort of technomagic monstrosity.  Without giving away any spoilers, some of the CG gets really bad towards the end.

In summary, the movie fails because they take a good story and change the plot in a really bad way.  I don't mind that they weren't true to the story, just that they did a really bad job of it all.  The production, writing and casting were all bad as well.  The movie got 2 stars instead of 1 because it's not exactly unwatchable and even has a few laughs from time to time.",1215820800,8,2625,4.609071274298056
1781628,5,B00006JMQD,"I enjoyed watching this TV series although it was definitely different. The story is about a 12 year old boy named Bastian Bux. This boy in growing older has lost some of the creative imagination he had, but when his mother suddenly dies this imagination returns. Bastian finds this book called 'The Neverending Story' in a book shop. The rest of the story unfolds in adventure, battles, suspense and pure imagination. This fun story has a different twist to it than the Neverending Story movies, but is just as exciting if not more. I would definitely recommend this TV series. Be prepared to sit awhile because it's 10 hours long.",1213315200,,632,4.754545454545455
1781629,5,B00006JMQD,"At long last fans are given an uncut version of Tales From The Neverending Story! The previous two volumes were severely edited for time and pacing so that it would feel more like a feature film. Fortunately this set boast all 13 UNCUT episodes and comes in a cool box shaped like the book!

Unfortunately this particular set is somewhat tricky to find in stores. I own it on DVD, as the quality is better and so forth, but since the DVD sold out in the blink of an eye and was a VERY limited printing I have to review the VHS set. The picture and audio quality is simply amazing. The cover art for each individual VHS/DVD in the set once removed from the box leaves a little to be desired, but they still look nice. The box art for the edited versions is quite flashy, too bad they only have two volumes instead of 4, otherwise you could house all of the volumes in those cases. As for the show itself, it's simply amazing. The best version of the Story next to the original 1980's movie, and the book itself.
Now, it's not very true to the book, but the plot adjustments and changes lend themselves to the episodic format and make the show quite exciting at times.

The story is as follows: A young boy named Bastian Bux discovers a mysterious book after the untimely death of his mother. The book is actually a window to another world of fantasy and magic called Fantasia. Little does Bastian know that the story he is reading is actually happening concurrently or that his thoughts and whims have a major impact on events. The Dark Princess, Xyide is destroying Fantasia with an evil force known only as the Nothing. The Nothing is powered by peoples loss of the ability to hope, dream, and fantasize. A young woodland boy, Atreyu, sets out on a quest to discover a way to save Fantasia and to find a cure for The Child Like Empress who has become deathly ill. The nameless empress is connected to her world in a physical way, and when it begins to die, so does she. The Child-Like Empress lives in the great Ivory Tower in the very heart of Fantasia. Every Fantasian loves her because they are all held to be equal in her eyes.
  As Bastian reads the book, be feels a strange connection with the story and finds it nearly impossible to stop reading. I find this show impossible to stop watching because it's so good. I recommend this series to everyone. Especially those who have hopes, dreams, or wish they could escape reality and go to another world. I give this series 5 stars.",1081209600,27,2486,4.40958605664488
1781630,1,B00006JMQD,"*This also refers to part one of the series*
How about a new film in theatres...""The Neverending Story IV:Escape From The Tragic Canadian TV Series""?
I cannot believe that even one person would stick up for this tripe.  It saddens me.  Deep down, it saddens me to think that people would obligingly lower their standards and say, ""Well, it's okay.  It could have been worse.""  Could have been worse?  Anything could always be worse!  I'm giving it one star because they spelled the title correctly.  There will be no further argument...YES, this is as bad as we say it is.  NO, it's not the worst thing ever, but we aren't comparing here.  We are rating this particular series, not the series in light of Harry Potter or Galidor or whatever has taken the spotlight these days.  This particular series should be ashamed to have the title ""The Neverending Story"" attached to it, although, as I mentioned, they did spell it correctly.  You don't have to stick to it word for word, but I refuse to endorse inventing asinine characters, events, plotlines and props simply to keep a new generation of kids glued to the television.  That's not a new spin, it's a sinister gimmick.  Sticking to the original storyline and utilizing the new technological capabilities would have produced far better results.  So, please, I'm begging you, if you watch this series, be familiar with the book.  Do not go into the breach unarmed.",1042070400,26,1417,4.773662551440329
1781631,2,B00006JMQD,"From the outset, this DVD was somewhat disappointing, despite some fantastic graphics and special effects. It appears to have been a hastily edited and heavily cut compilation of a series which was made for Canadian TV, with some disturbingly short and choppy segues from scene to scene, implying there was much extra material removed to edit this down to a film length feature. For continuity, I wish that the editors had allowed the original series to be transposed onto several DVDs and sold them as a complete set - it would have made more sense as a story, and allowed the original intent of the screenwriter and director to come through. Overall, though, it was a good try. Wait for the whole thing to be released, though - the bonus features hint at an amazing and entertaining multidisk story.",1039996800,22,801,4.76978417266187

This complete set so far is completely different. Now on the original my 5 year old granddaughter when she was 4 as soon as she would arrive, every weekend and summer, would pull out of her room her couch, put it in front of the TV and load the original film and watch it all day unless we went to the pool.. She still loves it and tells the story to her 4 year old sister. The first DVD from this set scared her enough to run away crying and not wanting to see anymore.

1781637,5,B00006JMQD,"I could not find a place to give a tag line so I put it into my title review. I loved Mark Rendall in this movie. Of course he is already grown up since the movie came out in 2001 to present day 2012. Eleven years later. Mark Rendall played the part of Balthasar Bux reading and narrated the story. He also reaffirmed the name of the child-like empress. ""Moon Child"". This movie was not quite like the first 1980's movie called Neverending Story with Barret Oliver. However, despite shortcomings I was very satisfied with the entertainment value of this movie. If you want to rent it or buy it, then do so you will still enjoy it. I love Mark Rendall, very good actor. I wish him the best of luck in future movies as an adult or whatever career path that he chooses.",1354752000,,766,4.289655172413793

7970510,3,B00006JMQD,"My feelings are complicated.
This is the worst acting I've ever witnessed, and I went to many high school theatre productions.
I did not like the Neverending story movies but somehow saw all three chapters (different actors in each one).
I came across this series because a friend had a random 2 disc on their shelf.
The fun I gathered from this was the heckling between me and the friends. We did not watch the pilot, nor the episodes in order but we did not care.

I will never know how this ends and I couldn't care less.
However the joy of mocking was so genuine in this, in a way I haven't felt in a long time, was fun.

7970514,4,B00006JMQD,"First let me say, that I never even heard of Tales from the Neverending Story until I looked it up on Amazon. But, out of curiosity and being a fan of the book and the movie, I thought I'd give it a chance. And I'm not regretting it.

I think previous reviews are being a little harsh. Yes, Tales from the Neverending Story is nothing like the novel or the movies, but you'll notice that in the opening credits it says ""Based on themes of the Novel by Michael Ende."" That alone should let you know that you're about to watch something that has the same THEMES as the novel but is not meant to be an adaptation or anything like that.

If you're looking for the original story of The Neverending Story; go read the book. Simple as that. If you want to see as close to an adaptation of the novel as you can, watch the movies. If you want to simply see something else that is fun, fantasy-filled, and has similar tones as the novel or movie; than Tales from the Neverending Story is great.

Admittedly, the acting is somewhat cheesy... the videography is reminiscent of watching any other kids show like Mighty Morphing Power Rangers or the like... but it's still worth a watch if you're not hyper critical of it. The show does provide nods to the novel such as referring to Atreyu as ""The son of all"". But then a lot of stuff is added that is totally unnecessary such as adding the characters ""Tartus"" or ""Mr. Blank"" whom were added just to fill up the show.

All-in-all, it's not bad and I do recommend it. If you're a Neverending Story snob; stay away from this. Otherwise, it's a good watch and I recommend it to anyone who wants something to watch with their kids or something to entertain your inner child.",1390694400,8,1708,4.361635220125786
7970515,1,B00006JMQD,"I thought it was the first Never Ending story, but it wasn't. I was my mistake for not looking closer before I bought it.",1386374400,,121,4.083333333333333
