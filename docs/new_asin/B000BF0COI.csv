8085726,5,B000BF0COI,"The Railroads That Tamed the West looks at the construction of the railroads between 1869 (the completion of the transcontinental railroad) and the 1930s (when air travel started to replace rail travel).  Topics portrayed include the challenges facing railroaders, the completion of the transcontinental railroad in 1869, dangers of rail travel, hazards of being a railroad worker, the invention of the coupler, the development of the air brake, George Pullman and the improvement of sleeping cars, dining cars, immigrants, competition among survey teams, the Homestead Act of 1862, the creation of towns, freight transport, refrigeration cars, the establishment of standard railroad time, and James Hill and the Great Northern Railway.  The video concludes with a consideration of how the railroad industry sought to conserve the West by promoting the national park system.  I show this video as part of my Westward Movement unit in my American history classes and have found it to be an effective teaching tool (but it does contain one expletive so you might want to inform students ahead of time).  Still, this video strikes a good balance between economic history and the history of technology.",1459468800,2,1198,5.322751322751323

8085730,5,B000BF0COI,"This is History 101 for all Americans on how the Transcontinental Railroad contributed to trade, unity and an indivisible country under God.  This program compacts from the advocate to the final joining ceremony with the last gold spikes

It features interviews with historians and museum chiefs with their insightful sharing.  The Union Pacific and Central Pacific competition with Leland Stanford team win in achieving "" 10 miles a day"" speed miracle without any credit to who the workers were even now 150 years after.  The railroad joined East and West with the work on plain and mountain, white and Chinese, mile and inch, hard and easy.  Stanford made his fortune in this adventure in establishing Stanford University.  Nowhere in Stanford campus on his favorite  Chinese team could be found even today January 1 2014! - a giant work by the small, hard working, discriminating slave wages pig-tailed Celestial Great Wall builders.

In one of the interviews, the scene was in front of the large life-like and size of a group of Chinese hauling barrel of gun powders for breaking up the rocks inside the California Sacramento Railroad Museum.  It was advocated and achieved by Chinese -American historian of San Francisco, Philip Choy to honor the thousands of Chinese in help building this country but subject to racial discriminated  Chinese Exclusion Act 1882 democratically voted in Congress. Mr. Choy raised the point on the credit due for the ""10 miles a day worker"" in the 1969 Centennial Celebration in Utah.

This is a good American history lesson which may lead all Americans to explore more on ""10 miles a day achievers"".",1388534400,,1636,5.022222222222222
