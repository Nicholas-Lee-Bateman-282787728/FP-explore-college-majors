3063981,5,B00119Y3RA,"DUSK

Something I appreciate in watching a film, and rarely get from the experience these days, is when the piece truly makes me reflect upon viewing. Michael Maney's DUSK did just that.  The best part is I didn't see it coming, and when everything hit me at once and all was revealed, it was very satisfying.  It's not often a psychological thriller/horror movie makes good on it's plot twist promises and then throws in some powerful sentimentality to boot.  Films in this genre are too often, and undeservedly, compared to 'The Sixth Sense', but in this case, DUSK earns the acclaim for the afore mentioned reasons.

DUSK ensnares it's viewer by opening with a chilling mystery.  John Whitmore (played seamlessly by John McGlothlin), leads an idyllic suburban life which is abruptly shattered when he wakes one morning to find his wife Anne (Juliana Harkavy, of 'Walking Dead' fame), has been kidnapped.  He learns of this via a baleful tape recorder left by the perpetrators with instructions on how to retrieve his wife.  What follows is a suspenseful tale in which John falls down the foreboding, eerie rabbit hole that is his journey to find Anne, partially contained within riveting flashbacks; some horrific, some touching - all revealing.  Lead actor McGlothlin shines here, without spoiling the twists I'll say he deftly balances a very fine line and is quite convincing in his portrayal of a man thrust into extremely dire circumstances. Harkavy is elegant as Anne and the couple's on-screen chemistry is sweetly natural.  While the lead performances are fantastic, supporting actors Ford D'Aprix (David), and Ron Kidd (simply known as ""Man""), practically steal the show.  As much as I was already enjoying DUSK, the late arrivals of these characters capped off my pleasurable experience.

The range of emotions experienced by the viewer is brilliantly staggering.  In a day where independent cinema has become fractured, I, more often than not, expect the genre listed on the DVD jacket or the Amazon detail page to be precisely that. Sadly, gone are the days where an indie film rarely exceeds my expectation of genre trope...DUSK did exceed.  I thought I'd get horror, I did, but I got MUCH more and that was unexpected and wonderful.  Admittedly, I enjoy a good cathartic tear duct letting while watching a film.  It's been a long time, but, dammit, if DUSK if didn't open those flood gates.  I wish I could spoil the film and speak of this moment, for director Michael Maney nailed this particular scene. A scene in which I was hoping he would make a very specific choice and he did, you'll have to watch and see for yourself.

Writer/Director Michael Maney's script is flawless and air tight.  It's the kind of movie which rewards subsequent viewings as you can see the careful, thoughtful details placed throughout the picture that add up to well crafted, precise storytelling.  In a story that features a good amount of thought provoking twists, the writing pays off these devices and rewards the audience with satisfaction.  These details, I find, are far too often left out in storytelling (I'm looking at you 'Game of Thrones' post season four), nice to see Maney caretaking here.  Credit goes to distributing company Monarch Home Video for getting behind this project and trusting the director's vision.",1465948800,3,3327,4.978300180831827
3063982,4,B00119Y3RA,"Strange, eerie story with a real surprise at end.  No blood or gore, but kept me watching oil the end!",1465948800,4,102,4.1
3063983,2,B00119Y3RA,"Let me start by saying,...I do believe there's a good story in there somewhere. Unfortunately, this ain't it. And I'm going to spoil what little there is. That's your WARNING!

The film focuses on John Whitmore waking up only to find his wife missing and a tape recorder with the words ""Play Me"" written on it. We've seen this before, but honestly, you gotta start the story somewhere. Actually, the movie begins with John having some sort of dream about driving and seeing a cancer riddled woman in the middle of the road roaming about. That's your first give away. Back to the tape. John listens and while the voice on the other end tells him what to do and specifically what NOT to do,...John decides to do basically the opposite. Don't call the cops?! I'll dial 911 and not say anything! Don't tell anyone about this? I'm going to phone my best friend! You get the idea.

Basically John is not the John you see on screen. John is, in fact, an old man that is suffering a losing battle with Alzheimer's. He thinks that he is being taken to find his wife and give what money he has left (as if there'd be any) to the kidnapper, only to discover he was the one leaving the messages the whole time. Now, my one and only question is,...who in there right mind would allow the father with Alzheimer's to not only live ALONE, but play out this crazy game that he has set up for himself?! They would,...it's stupid. Then he blows himself up? Yeah,..not really buying that either. Besides, he's been holding this ""hunting"" picture for the whole movie showing his killer, but he never once notices (until he's supposed to) that it's folded over in the back?

Final Verdict: Pass. There's already a FAR better movie dealing with Alzheimer's/Dementia. Go watch Shutter Island instead.",1465603200,,1776,4.596214511041009
3063984,3,B00119Y3RA,"So my buddy tells me about a movie called DUSK since Im a sucker for anything in the horror and thriller genre.  As a writer and connoisseur of everything horror, I approached yet another horror movie like Id pretty much seen everything that could be possibly done in this genre.  And to be honest, the past few years have been terribly disappointing when it comes to horror with a few, rare, bigger budget exceptions.  All you have to do is try to watch a few small budget horror films on Netflix and youll feel my same disappointment.  (And why is most of the new stuff coming out of Japan and Norway?  Japan, okay.  But NORWAY?  Whats scary about Norway?)

But back to DUSK, one hell of a surprise!  You could call this movie a horror movie and just as easily call it a psychological thriller and be correct. (Trust me, if this happened to you in real life youd be scared s***less!) Ill not drop any spoilers in this review, although I want to because it is so rare to find a movie with this level of suspense. And just when you think you have the damn plot twist figured out, with only a few minutes left to go in the movieNOPE, wrong!

What the hell good did it do to watch all those episodes of X-Files and read all of those Sherlock Holmes stories??  I couldn't figure this one out because the plot twist seemed to twist again and again so seamlessly.  That is credit to one hell of a great storyline, a whole hell of a lot of imagination, and some good acting chops.

It wasn't until I went back and watched it again that I noticed a few subtle hints in the movie that I didn't pick up on.  Michael Maney (never heard of him until now) made an indie film with a great storyline that actually kicked some ass.  Its cerebral as hell (pun intended).

3064009,5,B00119Y3RA,"I picked up a DVD copy of DUSK from a recommendation of a friend.  He knows I have a pretty high caliber for film, especially horror  and then I saw DUSK.

The bar just got raised.

Theres a lot of twists and turns on the plot going on with DUSK, directed and written by Michael Maney, who really matches a GREAT script with tight visuals.  Hes got some other projects posted I found on IMDB.  In the auteur theory of cinema (Yep  I wasted 4 yrs on a film degree!), the French believe that writer/directors are the true silver screen Gods.  I don't really know about that, but the stuff on IMDB, some shorts, looked really AWESOME.

But back to DUSK.

Herein lies the dilemma of this review: spoilers! Im especially leery AFTER I was jumped in that Austin bar when I told them Chewbacca died in the new Star Wars movie. (Lost two teeth and a busted rib, who knew geeks could throw down?)

Ill address some of the earlier reviews later, but DUSK is horror, the stuff of nightmares, on a truly frightening level  that of the psychological and grounded in reality.  The plot keeps you guessing until the last frame.  If you're a film purist like me, I ignore the box summary and toss in the movie and go in cold.

Maneys DUSK has so many twists, its hard to review and not reveal.  The film opens with John Whitmore, everyday family man, waking one morning to find his wife kidnapped, and a sinister tape recording telling him what he must do to get her back

This is as far as I can ethically go, other to say this, and Ill underline it to make it very important THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS.  There are hints throughout the film, that on my second viewing, I picked up even more  and got genuinely more creeped out.

The acting talent, featuring John McGlothlin, as the tormented husband; and Ford DAprix in a truly creepy role as SPOILERS AGAIN, so Ill go with his character name: David, truly shine.  As does the comic relief in the form of Todd Litzinger, in the role of that obnoxious friend everyone has, or in my case, married.  In fact, theres not much here to criticize negatively on the cast or story.

Back when independent film was a movement and not a marketing term, Im pretty sure DUSK would have gotten wide screen roll out. The upside is I saw it on DVD but you can watch it on Amazon.  With a little more budget, the closest comparison I can come to is Jason Batemans disturbing and equally unforgettable The Gift.

One last thing upon a viewing DUSK  a WARNING if you will.  Like any cool horror, DUSK creeps up at you where you least expect it, so ignore those immediate questions  or are they clues?  nagging your mind until you get to the horrific last frame.  DUSK, once you actually watch it, is impossible to review in 3 sentences.

Or one word.

As for any doubt among reviewers DUSK is not a horror movie?  Forget it  its the cerebral as much as the gore, but restricted by neither.  Thats part of its unnerving charm.  DUSK is a horror story, its one of the scariest kind.

The kind of ones that are for real  and probably await us all.",1464566400,14,3061,4.342756183745583

3298478,5,B00119Y3RA,"DUSK

Something I appreciate in watching a film, and rarely get from the experience these days, is when the piece truly makes me reflect upon viewing. Michael Maney's DUSK did just that.  The best part is I didn't see it coming, and when everything hit me at once and all was revealed, it was very satisfying.  It's not often a psychological thriller/horror movie makes good on it's plot twist promises and then throws in some powerful sentimentality to boot.  Films in this genre are too often, and undeservedly, compared to 'The Sixth Sense', but in this case, DUSK earns the acclaim for the afore mentioned reasons.

DUSK ensnares it's viewer by opening with a chilling mystery.  John Whitmore (played seamlessly by John McGlothlin), leads an idyllic suburban life which is abruptly shattered when he wakes one morning to find his wife Anne (Juliana Harkavy, of 'Walking Dead' fame), has been kidnapped.  He learns of this via a baleful tape recorder left by the perpetrators with instructions on how to retrieve his wife.  What follows is a suspenseful tale in which John falls down the foreboding, eerie rabbit hole that is his journey to find Anne, partially contained within riveting flashbacks; some horrific, some touching - all revealing.  Lead actor McGlothlin shines here, without spoiling the twists I'll say he deftly balances a very fine line and is quite convincing in his portrayal of a man thrust into extremely dire circumstances. Harkavy is elegant as Anne and the couple's on-screen chemistry is sweetly natural.  While the lead performances are fantastic, supporting actors Ford D'Aprix (David), and Ron Kidd (simply known as ""Man""), practically steal the show.  As much as I was already enjoying DUSK, the late arrivals of these characters capped off my pleasurable experience.

The range of emotions experienced by the viewer is brilliantly staggering.  In a day where independent cinema has become fractured, I, more often than not, expect the genre listed on the DVD jacket or the Amazon detail page to be precisely that. Sadly, gone are the days where an indie film rarely exceeds my expectation of genre trope...DUSK did exceed.  I thought I'd get horror, I did, but I got MUCH more and that was unexpected and wonderful.  Admittedly, I enjoy a good cathartic tear duct letting while watching a film.  It's been a long time, but, dammit, if DUSK if didn't open those flood gates.  I wish I could spoil the film and speak of this moment, for director Michael Maney nailed this particular scene. A scene in which I was hoping he would make a very specific choice and he did, you'll have to watch and see for yourself.

Writer/Director Michael Maney's script is flawless and air tight.  It's the kind of movie which rewards subsequent viewings as you can see the careful, thoughtful details placed throughout the picture that add up to well crafted, precise storytelling.  In a story that features a good amount of thought provoking twists, the writing pays off these devices and rewards the audience with satisfaction.  These details, I find, are far too often left out in storytelling (I'm looking at you 'Game of Thrones' post season four), nice to see Maney caretaking here.  Credit goes to distributing company Monarch Home Video for getting behind this project and trusting the director's vision.",1465948800,3,3327,4.978300180831827
3298479,4,B00119Y3RA,"Strange, eerie story with a real surprise at end.  No blood or gore, but kept me watching oil the end!",1465948800,4,102,4.1
3298480,2,B00119Y3RA,"Let me start by saying,...I do believe there's a good story in there somewhere. Unfortunately, this ain't it. And I'm going to spoil what little there is. That's your WARNING!

The film focuses on John Whitmore waking up only to find his wife missing and a tape recorder with the words ""Play Me"" written on it. We've seen this before, but honestly, you gotta start the story somewhere. Actually, the movie begins with John having some sort of dream about driving and seeing a cancer riddled woman in the middle of the road roaming about. That's your first give away. Back to the tape. John listens and while the voice on the other end tells him what to do and specifically what NOT to do,...John decides to do basically the opposite. Don't call the cops?! I'll dial 911 and not say anything! Don't tell anyone about this? I'm going to phone my best friend! You get the idea.

Basically John is not the John you see on screen. John is, in fact, an old man that is suffering a losing battle with Alzheimer's. He thinks that he is being taken to find his wife and give what money he has left (as if there'd be any) to the kidnapper, only to discover he was the one leaving the messages the whole time. Now, my one and only question is,...who in there right mind would allow the father with Alzheimer's to not only live ALONE, but play out this crazy game that he has set up for himself?! They would,...it's stupid. Then he blows himself up? Yeah,..not really buying that either. Besides, he's been holding this ""hunting"" picture for the whole movie showing his killer, but he never once notices (until he's supposed to) that it's folded over in the back?

Final Verdict: Pass. There's already a FAR better movie dealing with Alzheimer's/Dementia. Go watch Shutter Island instead.",1465603200,,1776,4.596214511041009
3298481,3,B00119Y3RA,"So my buddy tells me about a movie called DUSK since Im a sucker for anything in the horror and thriller genre.  As a writer and connoisseur of everything horror, I approached yet another horror movie like Id pretty much seen everything that could be possibly done in this genre.  And to be honest, the past few years have been terribly disappointing when it comes to horror with a few, rare, bigger budget exceptions.  All you have to do is try to watch a few small budget horror films on Netflix and youll feel my same disappointment.  (And why is most of the new stuff coming out of Japan and Norway?  Japan, okay.  But NORWAY?  Whats scary about Norway?)

But back to DUSK, one hell of a surprise!  You could call this movie a horror movie and just as easily call it a psychological thriller and be correct. (Trust me, if this happened to you in real life youd be scared s***less!) Ill not drop any spoilers in this review, although I want to because it is so rare to find a movie with this level of suspense. And just when you think you have the damn plot twist figured out, with only a few minutes left to go in the movieNOPE, wrong!

What the hell good did it do to watch all those episodes of X-Files and read all of those Sherlock Holmes stories??  I couldn't figure this one out because the plot twist seemed to twist again and again so seamlessly.  That is credit to one hell of a great storyline, a whole hell of a lot of imagination, and some good acting chops.

It wasn't until I went back and watched it again that I noticed a few subtle hints in the movie that I didn't pick up on.  Michael Maney (never heard of him until now) made an indie film with a great storyline that actually kicked some ass.  Its cerebral as hell (pun intended).

3298506,5,B00119Y3RA,"I picked up a DVD copy of DUSK from a recommendation of a friend.  He knows I have a pretty high caliber for film, especially horror  and then I saw DUSK.

The bar just got raised.

Theres a lot of twists and turns on the plot going on with DUSK, directed and written by Michael Maney, who really matches a GREAT script with tight visuals.  Hes got some other projects posted I found on IMDB.  In the auteur theory of cinema (Yep  I wasted 4 yrs on a film degree!), the French believe that writer/directors are the true silver screen Gods.  I don't really know about that, but the stuff on IMDB, some shorts, looked really AWESOME.

But back to DUSK.

Herein lies the dilemma of this review: spoilers! Im especially leery AFTER I was jumped in that Austin bar when I told them Chewbacca died in the new Star Wars movie. (Lost two teeth and a busted rib, who knew geeks could throw down?)

Ill address some of the earlier reviews later, but DUSK is horror, the stuff of nightmares, on a truly frightening level  that of the psychological and grounded in reality.  The plot keeps you guessing until the last frame.  If you're a film purist like me, I ignore the box summary and toss in the movie and go in cold.

Maneys DUSK has so many twists, its hard to review and not reveal.  The film opens with John Whitmore, everyday family man, waking one morning to find his wife kidnapped, and a sinister tape recording telling him what he must do to get her back

This is as far as I can ethically go, other to say this, and Ill underline it to make it very important THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS.  There are hints throughout the film, that on my second viewing, I picked up even more  and got genuinely more creeped out.

The acting talent, featuring John McGlothlin, as the tormented husband; and Ford DAprix in a truly creepy role as SPOILERS AGAIN, so Ill go with his character name: David, truly shine.  As does the comic relief in the form of Todd Litzinger, in the role of that obnoxious friend everyone has, or in my case, married.  In fact, theres not much here to criticize negatively on the cast or story.

Back when independent film was a movement and not a marketing term, Im pretty sure DUSK would have gotten wide screen roll out. The upside is I saw it on DVD but you can watch it on Amazon.  With a little more budget, the closest comparison I can come to is Jason Batemans disturbing and equally unforgettable The Gift.

One last thing upon a viewing DUSK  a WARNING if you will.  Like any cool horror, DUSK creeps up at you where you least expect it, so ignore those immediate questions  or are they clues?  nagging your mind until you get to the horrific last frame.  DUSK, once you actually watch it, is impossible to review in 3 sentences.

Or one word.

As for any doubt among reviewers DUSK is not a horror movie?  Forget it  its the cerebral as much as the gore, but restricted by neither.  Thats part of its unnerving charm.  DUSK is a horror story, its one of the scariest kind.
