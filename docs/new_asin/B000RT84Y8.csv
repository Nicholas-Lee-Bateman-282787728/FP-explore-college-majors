8202467,1,B000RT84Y8,"Senator Giacinto Puppis is running for president. He has an uncontrollable subconscious desire to grab the butts of people, mostly women. He gets caught on camera, blackmailed, then goes on a spiritual retreat in a place filled with German nuns. Guess how that works out.  This is supposed to be some sort of political satire, but lacks bite.

The comedy wasn't funny. The erotic scenes weren't erotic.

8202469,5,B000RT84Y8,"There are a lot of different kinds of comedies in this world from many different countries.  However when it comes to the genre of Sex Comedy, nobody, but nobody, does it like the Italians.  Unlike USA films on the subject of sex, they don't go for teen age boy humor.  This film is one of the good ones.  If you liked, ""Divorce, Italian Style"" for example, this should be your kind of movie.  I use to have an Italian Sex Comedy which in English is called ""Come Have Coffee With Us""  I had a VHS copy that I got from Cinemax back in the 80s'  I have looked for this film in any format and it's not there.  Wish they would release more of these from the 1960-80s' era.

Also I might add that another reason to enjoy this film is Laura Antonelli!  A true latin beauty and excellent in comedies as well as serious drama.",1291161600,6,818,4.185897435897436
8202470,2,B000RT84Y8,"A lot of movie packed into this; a mix of italian politics, religion and fascism. Misses the eroticism, though. The title is a bit mis-leading.",1275696000,3,143,4.76
8202471,1,B000RT84Y8,"This product (the one with the central photo of a man and two women on a light blue background) is a complete rip-off.  The DVD quality is so poor it is almost unwatchable.  It is not anamorphic widescreen, so the image is very small on your screen.  Do not buy this lemon (it may even be censored).",1260230400,6,299,4.2105263157894735
8202472,3,B000RT84Y8,Not a record maker but fun to watch and was glad to add to some like films from the 70's and 80;s,1220313600,3,97,3.4545454545454546
8202473,4,B000RT84Y8,"Twenty or so years ago, when I was in graduate school, a small UHF station in the Detroit area had its late night movie programming taken over- or so it seemed- by a film buff with a taste for low-budget European soft core. There were lots of German lesbian vampire films, strange Italian fantasies, and this movie, which seemed to play at least once a month. A small group of my fellow students (yes, we were all studying psychology, as amatter of fact) became rabid fans of this film series (and of Prisoner Cell Block H, but that's another story.)

The Senator Likes Women is a classic sort of Italian dark comedy and parody, combined with a typically Italian strong anti-Church message. The Senator is a young politician on his way up, destined for the Presidency. He's the product of years of careful grooming by the Church, and by one Bishop in particular who watches over him and advises him. He does have one problem- he's prone to blackouts in which he makes love to dozens of women- and you can guess from the pictures where some of those women reside.

I won't spoil the plot- such as it is- with further details, but I will note that there are some very dark twists intertwined with the comdey and sexual romps. It's not a film for everyone, but if the description appeals to you... well, you're one of those it's for.",1156896000,36,1330,4.514522821576763
