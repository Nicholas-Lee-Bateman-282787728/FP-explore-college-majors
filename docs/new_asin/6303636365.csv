693662,5,6303636365,"I really enjoyed this mini-series thoroughly.  I've always had a fascination with the Kennedy's (as did my Mom) and this was one mini-series we both enjoyed.  In fact, it's one of the last items she borrowed from me before she died in 1991.  I would love to see it come out on DVD as my VHS copy is really showing it's age.  I didn't take the commercials out either so I'm getting ads for the ""new 1990 cars"" coming up, which is pretty funny.",1270598400,3,442,4.226190476190476

7851877,5,6303636365,I don't know why this VHS tape is so expensive and I don't know why it isn't available on Amazon on DVD. I had a VHS tape that I had taped from t.v. but I loaned it to someone and never got it back. I finally googled The Kennedys of Massachusetts and got several sites where it can be purchased. I purchased it on DVD for less than 20.00 shipping included. It does not have the case. The DVDs come in sleeves but it seems to be in excellent condition. This mini series is unique in that it begins when Rose and Joe Sr. met so you get a better idea of what made them what they were before any of the children were old enough to have stories of their own. It contains a lot of detail but ends when JFK is elected president. It's several hours long and very well done.,1379980800,,765,4.006535947712418
7851878,5,6303636365,I first watched this on Youtube.  I would much rather watch it on my big screen tv! Please bring it out on dvd.  It would sell with no problem.  Excellent movie about the Kennedys.,1358380800,2,180,4.235294117647059
7851879,5,6303636365,"On what would have been the 95th birthday of John F. Kennedy, I pay homage to a formidable, intelligent, albeit tragically brief Presidency by reviewing the 1990 3-part miniseries that was first aired on ABC---a skillful encapsulation of the making of an American dynasty.
 Based on Doris Kearns Goodwin's biography, ""The Fitzgeralds and the Kennedys"", the author's screenplay(co-authored by William Hanley), and directed by Lamont Johnson, it has been given an emotion-laden score by David Shire in which full orchestration emphasizes the triumphs of this family, but which gives way to the doleful,plaintive strains of the instruments of old Ireland in moments of tragedy, of which, of course, there are many.
 It begins on the day of the 1906 inauguration of John (""Honey Fitz"") Fitzgerald(Charles Durning) as the Mayor of Boston in the company of his close-knit family, including his wife, Josie(Jean De Baer), younger daughter, Agnes( Jane Loranger), and particularly his devoted oldest daughter, Rose(admirably portrayed by Annette O'Toole) who is courting the son of an up-and-coming Irish American family, Joseph Kennedy(William Petersen), a Harvard alumnus with a promising future.
 Life for both families is fairly idyllic, but Joe Kennedy still faces difficulty in gaining full social acceptance in WASP society due to his Irish heritage.
 Rose experiences a major disappointment when, after a discussion with the Bishop of the Boston Archdiocese, Mayor Fitzgerald denies her her long-cherished wish to attend Wellesley, due to the belief that a young woman of a prominent Catholic family should set the example of attending an institution that promoted the faith in which she was raised. She and Agnes attend the convent school Kasteel Bloemendal in the Netherlands, where Rose recieves a high honor, becoming a Child of Mary, which requires her to hold her soul free in times of changing fortune--a spirituality that will be largely required of her for her remarkable life's journey.
 Joe and Rose marry in a wedding ceremony that is a notable social event in 1914. As Joe establishes himself in the business world, Rose begins having a family.
 Joseph Kennedy Jr.(Dante Magnani, Michael Goodwin, and Campbell Scott),born in 1915, is the first of Joe and Rose's brood to have his name inscribed in the family Bible. He is soon followed by John Fitzgerald(Thomas Krajewski, Stephen Weber), then Rosemary (Remi Nichols, Jennifer Walsh, Deidre Lovejoy), whose intellectual challenges will provide a trial for her family, Kathleen(Kelsey Nichols, Tracey Pollan), Eunice(Halina Radoz), Patricia(Karen Chafee, Kristin Kelly), Robert(Will Gardner, Casey Afflec, Randall Mall), Jean(Danielle Schonback, Beth Herzig), and Edward(Ryan Shaughnessy, Matthew Dundas).
 Amid Rose's observation that ""A family happens each person in it is aware that they are a part of something greater than themselves."" the tumultuous  journey of this boisterous and competitive family begins. John's rivalry with his oldest brother mounts amid frequent illnesses, his parents have Rosemary's mental abilities tested by doctors, Joe Sr. becomes America's youngest President of a bank at age 25, officially laying the foundation for his family's fortune, dabbling in film production and dallying with actress Gloria Swanson(Madolyn Smith Osbourne, whose swarthy complexion contrasts dramatically with the actual fairer complexion of her character).
 Pained by her husband's infidelity, Rose is advised to keep her faith and keep her family together. She must be the one who points the moral compass despite having legitimate grounds for leaving her marriage.
 The family enjoy sailing and walking the beach at their Hyannisport home, withstanding even the Great Depression due to Joe Sr.'s shrewd Wall Street dealings, which today would be deemed illegal insider trading.
 His oldest sons are becoming young men, whom we've seen through at-home boxing matches, Joe Jr.'s confirmation, and though Jr.'s stellar academic performance. Rose's father empathizes with John's feelings of love and admiration for his older brother, but weariness at constantly playing second fiddle to him.
 By the late 1930s, Joe Sr. has been appointed as Ambassador to the Court of St. James and the Kennedys move to England. As always, family meals are disciplined rituals in which current events are discussed and everyone's input is expected.
 Kathleen blossoms in England, becoming a great social success. ""Kick"", as she is known, and her two oldest brothers are a celebrated ""golden trio"" known for their charm.
 A falling out with President Roosevelt(Joseph Sommer) as war clouds gather in Europe results in Joe Sr.'s being recalled. His second eldest son publishes a bestseller, ""Why England Slept"", revealing insight his father failed to have.
 Back in the U.S., problems with Rosemary's erratic behavior--a liability to a political family-- mount. Having learned of a new procedure called a lobotomy that might help his oldest daughter, Joe Sr. takes advantage of the time his wife and children are vacationing in South America to have the surgery performed. Alas, Joe Sr. learns the hard way that neither his Wall Street wizardry, powers of diplomacy or all his acquisitions can undo the tragic results for which Rose would never forgive him.
 With one child discreetly sent away, the family will see two sons join the Navy and only one come back. Kathleen decides to help the war effort in England where, to her mother's dismay, she falls in love with the Protestant William Cavendish, the Marquess of Hartington(Michael Cumpsty) and marries him in a registrar's office rather than in church.
 By war's end Kathleen is widowed and still in Britain, and war hero Jack, who saved most of his crew  after his PT-109 boat was attacked in the Pacific, takes the reins as the one being groomed for political office. The whole family partake in the campaign for a Congessional seat with Joe Sr. spearheading the effort--except for Kathleen, who is advised to stay in Britain, being a political liability among the Boston Irish for her marriage to a Protestant aristocrat.
 The ""Kennedy Blitz"" style wins Jack his Congressional seat. But those years are marred by a tragedy involving the willful Kathleen and her illicit and still-married suitor, Peter Fitzwilliam(Thomas Gibson). We learn how a political family must refine that situation for public consumption.
 1950 provides a moment of contrasting happiness with Bobby's marriage, and a last glad moment for Honey Fitz, and a moment of solemn reverance as the family bid him farewell, once again finding consolation in their faith.
 By 1956, the decision for Jack to run for the Presidency in 1960 has been made, and from there, we forge ahead to the 1960 Campaign where the issue of Kennedy's faith is addressed, and the tale ends on a note of triumph--Inauguration Day, 1961.
 Joe Kennedy Sr. had initially vowed to improve his family's marginalized status, telling Rose,""We're going to the party!""
 As we watch Stephen Weber's JFK--a man no longer waiting  with his hands in his pockets--give his inspirational and highly memorable inaugural address, and know that more colossal tragedy lies on the horizon, we leave this family at a moment when they are the center of the party--and the celebration is grand!",1338249600,4,7329,5.320069204152249
7851880,5,6303636365,"When oh when will this be available on DVD????  I have a copy I taped off the tv in the early 90's when it first aired, commercials and all and the sound quality is going.  Other good Kennedy miniseries' have made their way to DVD.  When will this?

Very well acted, this miniseries was everything I had hoped it would be after reading Doris Goodwin's wonderful book that it was based on.",1306713600,10,388,4.347222222222222
