I had seen several of his shows, but this tape really struck home with me. I can now answer our front door without my visitors being barked at and jumped on.

3729487,5,B001OB9L8Q,"Cesar Milan's techniques have changed our lives so much for the better.  We have learned that our dogs listen so much better when we are quiet or make the famous ""Shush"" soundno more yelling which just confuses them.  Simple techniques such as the person being the first one out the door for a walk, the dogs never being in front of you on walks, dogs being invited on the furniture before jumping up, etc., make so much difference in letting them KNOW who the Pack Leader is.  One really big help is to gently yank the leash sideways when the dog is misbehaving on a walk instead of pulling the leash back; it makes them unbalanced, and they have to concentrate on regaining their footing rather than misbehaving.  It all makes so much sense.  I highly recommend it.",1430092800,5,767,4.528985507246377

I got enough information to resolve my issues, saving me a great deal of money over the trainer my vet recommended.  Each story taught me something!  Beyond my own education I enjoyed seeing other pet owners who too are decent people, but somewhere became misguided.  I was comforted by knowing I'm not the only person who needed training with a new dog in my house.  I also found the stories to be very uplifting.  The humor is enjoyable.  This is one thing I bought to help me be a better pet parent, and it is the single thing worth every penny!",1422230400,,649,4.525862068965517

3729502,5,B001OB9L8Q,Love to watch Cesar on TV and got this for my son and daughter- in-law when they adopted a dog from a shelter.  This dog had several behavioral issues once they brought him home and they were afraid they could not keep him.  My daughter -in-law  had not seen Cesar prior and now is a big fan. Followed his suggestions on how to correct behaviors and with love and persistance their dog has come full circle.  Helpful to see how it is done rather than just reading in a book.,1389052800,2,474,4.233333333333333

Its so educational for people wanting to learn how be a pack leader and have the best dog possible! Cesar Milan is truly an amazing man and knows all things dog.

3729510,5,B001OB9L8Q,He has helped us rehabilitate our pack of recalcitrant dogs and train their ignorant owners. We had a really problem poodle we rescued from an abusive owner and the dog is coming along nicely. We had no idea all the ways we were contributing to his problems. Cesar demonstrated time and again that we were the real problem. We love his episodes and watch them over and over. They have saved us hundreds of dollars in dog training fees!,1376438400,,435,4.518987341772152

3729512,5,B001OB9L8Q,Awesome taught me a lot  I would recommend it to all dog owners Cesar Millan does wonderful work thanks again,1375142400,,109,4.45
3729513,5,B001OB9L8Q,"We have a new puppy and using Cesar's methods with him has us all happy and calm. Seeing him rehabilitate dogs in this DVD helps us remember that whatever it is that our pup is doing that we would like to change, change is always possible.",1374451200,,239,4.217391304347826
3729514,1,B001OB9L8Q,"I have not watched this particular compilation and will not, since I've seen enough episodes of this dog whisperer show to judge it. The 'techniques' he's using don't even deserve to be called techniques, since they are simply a demonstration of human superiority over dogs. Caeser Millan uses seriously violent and life-threatening means to force a dog into submission, basically he deprives them of air until they face fear of death, and that is how he breaks them. I cannot understand how the owners of these ""rehabilitated"" (read: broken) dogs can possibly overlook the signs of fear and physical exhaustion in their dog. All they see is: Oh look, he's not trying to bite me anymore - could it be because the dog is busy trying to get some air after having been this close to death?! Go figure.

Please, people, have a critical look at *how* this Caesar Millan person achieves his goals, do not just look at the effects. A broken dog is broken, not educated. Do you want to be part of this? I hope not.",1373500800,,1006,4.620111731843576

3729516,5,B001OB9L8Q,"As usual with Caesar's tips, this is a great aid for those working with a dog.  I like ideas that do not involve ""corporal"" punishment for misbehavior.",1372896000,,151,4.592592592592593
3729517,5,B001OB9L8Q,I thought this DVD was very informative and found it very uesful. Especially since I couldn't find his show on TV,1369267200,,113,4.428571428571429
3729518,4,B001OB9L8Q,Cesar's Dvd is helpful with leaning how to better train your dog.  Would suggest it to dog owners with problem dogs.,1368057600,,116,4.523809523809524

3729521,5,B001OB9L8Q,"At age 50, having had dogs all my life from german shepherds to African Basenji, greyhound, shi-poo, pitbulls, great dane mix and more .... I thought I knew about dogs.  Then because of my allergies I needed a no-shed dog and was looking for a large dog and we got a beautiful rambunctious Bouvier des Flanders puppy and wow, I felt like I knew nothing about dogs and she tore up the house. She popped my husband's hernia surgery appendix open jumping, jumped so high she'd knock me over and I had scratches on my face, just below my eye where she barely missed me with her gigantic paw, etc.  Then we discovered this series and not only is our dog changing, but our personal lives are changing as we realize the dogs reflect often our attitude. After a few weeks she is now a little frisky but will calm and submit immediately and with no trauma, no harsh words, nothing but firm pressure ... well, don't want to ruin it, but its amazing.  God used this series to teach me to be more calm and relaxed and less stressed so that my dog will be the same.  So we're both learning. May God bless Cesar for sharing his knowledge with the world.",1363564800,,1139,4.333333333333333

3729523,3,B001OB9L8Q,Not the  newer stuff.  Older Cesar so it's a bit unrefined as he was still honing his craft.  Not bad though by any means.,1359504000,2,122,4.0
3729524,5,B001OB9L8Q,"I love Cesar's approach to dog training, I have used his ways to deal with my 2 dogs, a 72 lb Lassie Collie who thinks he is a lap dog and a 6 lb toy poodle who thinks he is a big dog.  Cesar is the only trainer I will listen to as it is kind training and he works on the dogs level instead of trying to change the dog into something it is not.",1357171200,,344,3.526315789473684

3729530,5,B001OB9L8Q,"This video doesn't disappoint, with Cesar Millan showing dog owners how to correct a variety of unwanted behaviors in their pets. As he says, he rehabilitates dogs and trains owners!! I know that by taking his advice, especially not talking so much to my dog and using the ""tsch,"" sound to correct her, I have been able to break some bad habits my Chihuahua had upon my adopting her. Being the Leader of the Pack is really the best way to have a balanced and happy dog, which makes for an enjoyable pet.",1349568000,,503,4.419354838709677

And then, when I needed a good movie on animal psychology for our psychology class, I decided to take a look. And oh, boy, Cesar Millan does true magic with our four-legged friends. And it's extremely fun too. I think these series should be an essential watch for anyone who even contemplates adopting a dog.",1332806400,,421,4.341772151898734

There's a little bit for everyone - dogs that are aggressive, or fearful - but it just gives a taste of what The Dog Whisperer is all about.

8330157,5,B001OB9L8Q,"This video features condensed versions of six Dog Whisperer episodes:
  1. The Shiny
  2. One Last Chance
  3. Raging Bandit
  4. Banjo Runs Scared
  5. Four Alarm Dog
  6. Maureen's Gift

All these episodes are outstanding. One Last Chance is the story of a boxer whose owners found Cesar's newspaper ad the night before he was scheduled to be put down. Cesar's sensitivity and respect for dogs shows even brighter than usual in Banjo Runs Scared. Four Alarm Dog, about a Dalmatian dropped off at a fire station, was for me the most enjoyable. Have some tissues handy for Maureen's Gift.",1465516800,,588,4.702970297029703
