8139708,5,B000HG7ZQY,"The Muslim religion is just as complex as Christianity. Does one need to focus on a small, violent minority when making a single television episode on a particular religion? I'm a liberal Christian and I certainly don't want to be associated with Christian fundamentalist kooks spewing hatred and insanity at military funerals or with those who kill medical doctors or with Ugandan Christians that support execution for homosexuals. Neither does the vast majority of Muslims want to associate with people who are crazy kooks, either! I'm glad Bill Moyers and Huston Smith focused on Sufism. How many people in the USA have the slightest idea that there is a mystical Muslim sect that has survived and flourished for well over a 1000 years?",1308268800,3,739,5.016260162601626
8139709,1,B000HG7ZQY,"When I borrowed this tape from my local library, I expected a documentary about the Islamic faith by a scholar of religious studies. What I got instead was a syrupy, nauseating, aw-shucks episode of feel goodism. Huston Smith hems and haws about the Sufi experience and its supposed focus on sweetness and light, while the viewer learns next to nothing about the less conciliatory orthodox Islam, or about Islamic history. Pseudo-mystical hoopla, plain and simple.",1283126400,2,464,5.2
8139710,2,B000HG7ZQY,"Bill Moyers interviewed Huston Smith in 1996.  The well known religious scholar spends most of the time talking about Islamic mysticism.  The Sufis are of particular interest to Smith.  He fails, however, to point out that many Muslims consider this interpretation of Islam to be heretical.  Smith ignores the second class status of women in the Muslim world.  What about the persecution of religious minorities?  Not a word.  He also conveniently fails to mention that Islamic scholarship and architectural development virtually ceased around four to five hundred years ago.

Much of the Muslim world today is a basket case.  Anti-intellectualism and hatred of modernity dominate the thinking of the its hardliners.  Did you ever wonder why we were surprised by the attacks of 9/11?  Well, all you need to do is view this video.  Houston Smith presents Islam as mostly a religion of peace and warm feelings to all of God's creatures.  Jihad is supposedly not the urge to violently dominate the non-Muslim world but one's stuggle over their own personal inclination to sin.  In other words, Smith downplays the existential clash of civilization between the radical Muslims and the Western World.  Seeing this original PBS production in 2007 is a real eye opener.  The liberals in our country wanted to remain oblivious to reality---and the very left-wing Moyers gave them exactly want they wanted.
