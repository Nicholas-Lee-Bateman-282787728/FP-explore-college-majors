2499427,1,B000E6ESA8,"Ok, this season had a few funny sketches such as Def Strawberry Jam commercial, Dirty Dozens, and some of the music video parodies such as Snow, Ike Turner, and Michael Jacksons' Billie Jean or Lil' Timmy's Not My Lover - Thats All You Get!!!!  Any true In Livin' Color fan would agree with me knowing that season 5 was what really cancelled the series for good.  It's bad enough that the series got butchered by many unfunny sketches, but the new actors were not funny at all (except for Anna Marie Johnson from Whats Happenin' Now),  the entire Wayans clan dissappeared and Kelly Coffield (she was really funny -why she leave!?) and J Lo left too.  Besdies the fine Deedra, you won't see any orginal fly girls and music guest attendance that come out at the end of each episode (Shaq, Eazy E, and Patra)

WARNING - The fly girl's hip hop music will be switched to the generic techno crap on this release.  I will warn you that sketches will be removed, such as all of the music video parodies (like what was done for seasons 2-4)

These are really good reasons why NOT to get this because you will waste your hard earned money on a bad season and a half-ass dvd.  Do not pay attention to other reviewers that think seasons 3 to 4 dvds plus this are good because they are not.  If they want to waste their money on half-ass dvd releases, then let them!!  As said before, you can tape the sketches that you want on BET at low low cost because at least you get the privilage to to filter out crap.",1140220800,23,1496,4.329749103942652

2499490,5,B000E6ESA8,"I love the Wayans Brothers, and this variety hit show will have you drop dead laughing. These guys really did push buttons, and made fun of so many people in the 90's. I say yes purchase well worth the money!!!",1403136000,,210,4.275
2499491,1,B000E6ESA8,"Rupert Murdoch & his New Corp that run Twentieth Century Fox are too cheap to pay for the original music bumper songs that were featured with the fly girls. This series was a hit due to the writing headed by Keenan Ivory Wayans. These DVD releases SUCK!!!!. BEWARE NOT ORIGINAL AS IT WAS ON FOX TV 1990-1995!!!!. YOU ARE BETTER OFFER RENTING IT ON NETFLIX OR WATCHING ON YOUTUBE OR CABLE. FOX NEEDS TO GET WITH IT & PAY THE MUSIC LABLES THIER MUSIC FOR THE ORIGINAL BUMBERS AT THE END OF EACH SKETCH. KEENAN LEFT AT SEASON 4 BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT GIVING HIM SYNDICATION PAYOUT ON THE RERUNS!!. 20TH CENTURY FOX DOES NOT LIKE TO PAY ITS MINORITY OR LABELS THAT PRODUCE HIP HOP!!!.************DO NOT PURCHASE*************************BOOTLEG EDIT RIPOFFS!!!!********************** - I LIKE TO SEE JENNIFER LOPEZ, DEIDRE LANG, CARI-ANN INABA, CARRI FRENCH, LISA, ETC. - THE ORIGINAL FLY GIRLS DANCE TO THE REAL HIP HOP MUSIC THAT MADE THIS THE CLASSIC SERIES IT IS!!!.",1397347200,,964,4.848484848484849
2499492,5,B000E6ESA8,This was a gift so that person would know why we would say certain phrases from this tv show.  Usually about Homie the clown....very good actors and laugh out loud episodes.,1389571200,,173,4.580645161290323
2499493,4,B000E6ESA8,I bought Season 5 to complete the series. I was hesitant to buy it after reading some of the reviews but I find this season just as funny as the others. There are new faces and missing faces but it is still worth a watch. It's been so long since I have seen this show that I really wouldn't know what was left out....,1332547200,,317,3.96875
2499494,4,B000E6ESA8,"If you can get this for a good price it's worth getting, i remember when these first came out you could get them at Target for $10 a season, that's when I bought 1-4, they didn't have 5, any missing parts from the DVD you can watch on Youtube, it's not worth spending time recording this yourself from TV to save $10.",1322870400,,317,4.129032258064516
2499495,5,B000E6ESA8,All of the In Living Color series are awesome.  I bought all seasons as a Christmas present for my son.  You wanna laugh?  Pop one of these in when you have company and it will be great entertainment for all.,1296259200,,208,4.15

2499530,3,B000E6ESA8,Old Fare...the series had become tired by now. I bought it to round off the entire 5 seasons for my collection.,1228003200,,111,4.333333333333333
2499531,5,B000E6ESA8,Jim Carrey and Jamie Foxx are a riot as always. Chris Rock only adds to the hilarity. I loved this season! It is definitely worth the buy!,1226448000,,138,4.148148148148148
2499532,4,B000E6ESA8,"Very good but I was disappointed to find out
the ""Droop There it is"" song is not on any of
the discs.  I bought Season 5 especially to
have that hilarious song as I am getting older.
I wonder why they cut it out of this.",1223942400,,220,3.782608695652174
2499533,5,B000E6ESA8,THIS WAS A VERY FUNNY SEASON...JAMIE FOX REALLY SHOWS HIS COMEDIC TALENT DURRING THIS SEASON. THE OTHER REGULAR COMICS ARE JUST AS FUNNY!!! I LOVED THIS ONE KUDOS!!,1188432000,,164,4.892857142857143
2499534,5,B000E6ESA8,"I have been looking for this dvd set for a long time and to get from amazon has made me very happy , and the price was nice , another thing is that you had plenty of them is in stock. I will always use amazon for all my dvd's purchase.

2499535,1,B000E6ESA8,"I haven't bought this DVD set, and I have no plans to because I know exactly what to expect: edited episodes, no extras, and sub-par content.  This is the season where all of the Wayans siblings, along with the highly underrated Kelly Coffield, are gone from the show, and a bunch of minimally talented new cast members are brought in to replace them.  Jamie Foxx, Jim Carrey, and David Alan Grier pretty much had to carry the show, and as a result they often came off as obnoxious caricatures of themselves (especially Jim). Granted, there were still some good sketches here and there, most notably the Dirty Dozens sketches, but these were overshadowed by a bunch of sophomoric material.  There were also some pretty good music video parodies, but of course they're edited out of this set.  So there's not much to recommend here - just record the episodes off BET (where the music video parodies are left in) if you want to see the handful of good sketches from this season, or if you want to get a general idea of what the show was like at that point.",1146268800,14,1054,4.531578947368421
2499536,3,B000E6ESA8,I just got season 5 yesterday and already watched the first side of disc 1. Looks like this season is edited just like 2-4. I did notice on the box it did say edited content for DVD release. I don't know what is missing but so far the episodes are ranging between 15-20 minutes. I HOPE sometime in the future FOX entertainment will find a way to release some of the missing stuff or at least the music video parodies. It's better that we got something than nothing.,1145318400,15,465,4.295454545454546
2499537,1,B000E6ESA8,"This final season is just ridiculous...and not in a good way.

When the Wayans abandon a project, then you know it is unfunny and over. Just look at the Scary Movie films.

Kelly Coffield left because the producers wanted to use Alexandra Wentworth more. A huge mistake! Kelly was hilarious.

Save your money and avoid this stinker season.",1144540800,14,339,4.810344827586207
2499538,2,B000E6ESA8,"When shows do final seasons usually they go out with a bang. But saddly this shows last bullets in this shows gun was a bunch of blanks. Now don't get me wrong, it was funny, I'll give it that, that's the only reason it got 2 stars, but season 1-4 raised the comedy standeard so high and were so funny but this season was a huge failure IN LIVING COLOR wise. So I'd recomend this for the series collectors like me. meaning I have season 1-4 and although I didn't like season 5, I'd feel uncomplete without it.",1142812800,6,509,4.204081632653061
2499539,3,B000E6ESA8,"24 minutes was NOT how long each episode was. FOX shows from that time generally range between 22:30 and 23:15, no longer than that. So if the total time you posted is right, we might finally have another uncut DVD set for In Living Color (season 1 being the other). If that's the case, I might just end up buying season 5. I bought 1 and 2, and skipped 3 and 4 due to the large amount of edits. I'll stick with recording those seasons from BET. The replacement music will be the only other issue, but I'd rather have replacement music than chopped up episodes.",1140480000,4,561,4.30188679245283
