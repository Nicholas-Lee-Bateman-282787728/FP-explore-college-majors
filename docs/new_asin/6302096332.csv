The acting is poor at best but I think an Oscar should be given to Randy Pearlstein (Joe Wave, Jr.) for his role - I couldn't work out whether he was supposed to be playing a d*ck or whether he really IS a d*ck and was just playing himself!!  I love this film, it's cheesy and bad in such a way it makes it good and compulsive viewing.  I can highly recommend this film to anyone who loves a good bad movie!",1107129600,,536,3.935185185185185
7822104,2,6302096332,"This not so funny horror spoof (which won Best Independant Theatrical Feature at the 1990 Houston Film Festival)centres around a newspaper reporter named Mike R Wave (ha ha. NOT) who is having what appears to be the best day of his life. He has just gotten engaged to his beautiful girlfriend and is about to undertake the biggest scoop of his career to date: exposing corruption at a nuclear power plant. However the evil chairman Peter Spurtz (haha) and his henchmen including Dick Swell (haha again) decide the best way to stop Mike from putting the plant out of business is by throwing him into a vat of toxic waste. Predictably Mike is not killed but returns as a hideously deformed freak hellbent on getting vengeance (shades of BATMAN).It's also ironic that this was released the same year as DARKMAN because the similarities between the two movies are enormous. It's just that DARKMAN is slicker, funnier and darker than this. Aside from the juvenile sexual references the jokes in REVENGE OF THE RADIOACTIVE REPORTER are just not funny. The film makers tried, they didn't completely fail, but they didn't really suceed either. If this movie were junk food you could class this as a ripoff Quarter Pounder: plenty of cheese but not a lot of meat to wrap your chops around.",1030492800,,1280,4.796380090497737
