7426734,5,B0152AW10Y,"A well made movie based on true history of Korea under colony of Japan from 1919 to 1945, and little bit beyond it. The story line is good, and actions, too.",1451779200,,157,4.096774193548387

7426738,5,B0152AW10Y,I'm a big fan of Korean movies. Loved it.,1449273600,3,41,3.6666666666666665
7426739,3,B0152AW10Y,"Assassination is a drama set in Japanese-occupied Korea during the 1930s. When an agent from the provisional government (Lee Jung-jae) determines to assassinate both an army commander and a national traitor, he enlists the help of three exiled rebels: a sniper in the Korea independence army (Gianna Jun), an imprisoned military school graduate (Cho Jin-woong), and an explosives expert (Choi Deok-moon). When the Japanese Consulate in Shanghai learns about the intended assassination, they dispatch contract killer Hawaii Pistol (Ha Jung-woo) to stop them.

The film is overly complex, with too many characters and subplots, a serpentine script, and three different time periods. Its often difficult to keep track of where and when action takes place. More an action flick than a deep exploration of the Japanese occupation of Korea during the 1930s, Assassination is at its best with some effectively staged action set pieces and a smattering of comic relief. The film has problems tying things together, and the ending seems awkwardly strained.

Director Choi Dong-hoon has fashioned a decent escapist movie. There isn't much depth of characterization, but production values are first-rate. At 140 minutes, however, the movie is overstuffed and could stand some prudent editing. There are no bonus features on the Blu-ray release.",1449014400,3,1333,5.466019417475728
7426750,2,B0152AW10Y,"I wanted to like this, I mean look at all the five star reviews! I tried it but just couldn't get into it. It had an action oriented opening scene but was so slow after that. I love watching the occasional Korean movie and there are some great ones out there. Perhaps that will be the case for those watching this movie after me but my search will go on.",1485820800,,354,4.071428571428571
7426751,5,B0152AW10Y,"Wang Ji Hyun (The Legend of the Blue Sea) stars in this movie.  An untold story about Japan's domination of the Pacific Rim prior to WWII.  The lead female actor is terrific as a sniper for the Korean Independence Army.  ""Empire of the Sun"" was a story about European struggles under occupation.  ""Assassination"" is the story about the occupation of Korea before Perl Harbor.  Wang Ji Hyun uses very subtle expressions in her acting - the dance scene is a good example of her acting style.  The films has stunning cinematography in each scene.",1485043200,,543,4.723404255319149
7426752,5,B0152AW10Y,"Gianna Jun, awesome!!!

7426753,5,B0152AW10Y,"Assassination is an epic historical ww2 movie that destroys anything Hollywood has made in the last few years I watch a lot of foreign films because Hollywood mostly makes bad overrated and badly acted movies as of late assassination is an amazing movie Gianna Jun is an amazing actress she delivered an Oscar worthy performance all the other actors and actresses did a great job too this movie shows a part of ww2 that most Americans don't know about the Japanese did much worse than bomb pearl harbor they brutalized Korea and China during ww2 and this movie shows what the Japanese did in Korea and shows how the resistance tried to fight them all of the clothes uniforms and weapons are historically accurate and the storyline is great some people say the movie is hard to understand but I had no problem with understanding the storyline

Assassination is definitely on my top 5 list of movies I also recommend generation war and the flowers of war as well

Highly recommended",1484265600,,980,4.7251461988304095
7426754,5,B0152AW10Y,"A great period movie, great acting, direction, setting, everything from the opening to the end.
So, I too loved this movie from beginning to end. Lots of action, intrigue humor, life. If you like complex then you'll enjoy the depth and sweep.  It definitely lives up to all the five star reviews. The characters were well-cast, well acted, and intelligently believable.
So grab the popcorn and put up your feet and enjoy this fine movie about war resistance and counter-plots.",1480723200,,476,4.95

7426763,5,B0152AW10Y,"Interesting plot, great actors, cool action sequences. At first the plot's complexity is a bit overwhelming, so I found myself occasionally rewinding for a few seconds in order to make sure I understood what was said. Some of my friends who saw this in theaters said they had trouble keeping up with what was going on. I've seen that some people call the film a weak commentary on the politics of the time, but I prefer to simply enjoy its value as a fun action movie (which is how it appears to be intended).
Highly recommended!",1470614400,2,529,4.520833333333333

7426768,5,B0152AW10Y,"A pre-WWI era drama of mainland China's struggle to rid itself of the various colonial efforts by European countries and Japan in maintaining a footholds in their country with brutal military backed forays that targeted all who opposed their occupations.  Push-back was organized by Chinese, undercover nationalists, who specifically wanted to assassinate those responsible for the deaths of Chinese citizens, many being close supporters, friends and relatives of the nationalists.  Clever double-agent masqueraded successfully to avoid detection, to learn about the planned assassinations and to intervene in hopes of preventing them happening.  Years later, our clever double-agent is unmasked.  Beautifully filmed.",1461801600,2,717,6.069306930693069
7426769,5,B0152AW10Y,"Probably one of my favorite movies out of Asia.  At first I had a hard time following the story, but it didn't take too long to catch up. Good story, action, and characters. A rare combo, and almost nonexistent in Hollywood.",1459728000,2,224,4.463414634146342
7426783,5,B0152AW10Y,"Excellent movie! I've been to a lot of Korean movies and so had my expectations in the middling zone...didn't expect much. I don't mind seeing mediocre Korean movies because I'm an avid K Drama watcher so love everything about the culture. They make great TV shows, but for some reason, can't make great movies. However, this one was a winner! The story, actors, period details, action, and character development were all top notch. So glad I gave this one a try. Loved it.",1458259200,2,473,4.710843373493976

7426785,5,B0152AW10Y,"An Excellent film!  The actors were perfect in this movie, maybe it had to do with the director, who tied the whole story together smoothly.  Jyun-ji hun was amazing, from her Sassy girl days, to now, she's improved so much as an actress.  Another great job done by Lee Jyung Jae!  Ha Jung woo has become one of my favorite actors being able to play so many different type of roles, and he did well in this one too.  Simply a great film!  I didn't believe the reviews after watching the trailer, but all I got to say is you have to watch this!",1457654400,,543,4.173076923076923

7426828,5,B0152AW10Y,"This movie is one of the good Korean movies based on historical fact in 1940s.

It has an awesome story and tons of action, I loved how it was complex and you had to pay attention but not so much that if you missed even a second you'd be lost. It definitely is one of those movies worth watching over again and I'm very happy I bought it based on the reviews because it lived up to the hype.
I won't be like a lot of people and spoil anything by going into detail about the plot and characters because there are plenty of reviews that will do it for you. Basically, if you love an awesome story set int war time with awesome action, acting and all around AWESOME then check it out because again, it lives up to the 5 star reviews.",1453939200,8,692,4.0583941605839415

8732470,5,B0152AW10Y,"A bit confusing in places unless you have some basic knowledge of South Korea under Japanese occupation in the 1930s, but a rip-roaring yarn involving double-crosses, betrayals and heroic sacrifice. Quite bloody in places, so be prepared for that, but otherwise a real ""Wow!"" of an action film. Gianna Jun is, as always, fabulous, playing the part of twins.",1522022400,,357,5.067796610169491

8732478,5,B0152AW10Y,"To those who do not understand the full meaning of this movie.

This movie was dedicated to the unknown and largely forgotten Korean independence fighters who have given up their lives against the oppression of the Japanese occupation of 1906 to 1945.

I applaud Jun Ji Hyun for taking on a decisively political role in favor of Korea.

Lee JungJae gave perhaps his finest performance for this film.

Nothing speaks of sincerity like giving your life for a cause you believe in.

This was one of the greatest Korean movies ever made. I highly recommend every Korean to watch this.",1487894400,3,580,4.76
