7913909,4,B00000JZHQ,"I just got my K2000 Advanced and tried it out last night. It's a tough  workout and Savidis is quite the charismatic drill sarge instructor!  Glossy, slick set with glossy, slick women and a pulsing techno beat. It  gets a little corny: the camera lingers provocatively on a glistening torso  or the lights flash like it's a disco; sometimes views of the moves that  are going on get lost to the MTV effects.
The routine is good, with  punch-kick combos like jab-cross-roundhouse, squat and kicks, and some  extremely tough kick-lunge to the floor moves! But the major problem is  that he goes lightning fast--way too fast! People who complain that Tae-bo  moves are done so fast they sacrifice form and become unsafe should see  this video--I've done tae kwon do and cardio kickboxing for a long time  now, but there's no way to avoid getting sloppy here because the speed of  the sequences get ridiculous! It's not double-time, it's triple-time! So  you have to just modify and go at your own pace, which to Savidis' credit  he does recommend.
Another annoyance is that before each new sequence,  this slick title i.e. ""Roundhouse jab cross"" will fly onto the  screen and you see the exercisers doing the move like it's an MTV video for  a few seconds, then the camera quickly cuts to them doing the move in  real-time--but you've had no set-up time at all to prepare for the  sequence. The second half of the video has tough boxing drills--endless  sets of jab-punches and front kick-roundhouse combos. But he completely  works out one side of the body then neglects to do it on the other side!  Yikes. My right arm felt like Schwartzenegger and my left arm like  neglected flab.
This video in my opinion *could have been spectacular* as  a workout if more emphasis was given to making the workout balanced, at a  more realistic pace, and less emphasis on making it seem like a Tiger  Schulman commercial, complete with bodacious chicks ala video-game  heroines. Less close-ups of navels and more shots of the proper moves,  please! But Savidis is very good, tough, cute and friendly--like Billy  Blanks without the touchy-feely Christian angle.",968976000,10,2148,4.824175824175824
