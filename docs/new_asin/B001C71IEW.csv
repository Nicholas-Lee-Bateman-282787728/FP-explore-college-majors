3506383,5,B001C71IEW,This product was a gift for my four year old nephew and he loves it! He wants to play it all of the time.,1327104000,,105,3.4166666666666665
3506384,5,B001C71IEW,"I bought this for my nephew for Christmas. He absolutely loves anything to do with Scooby Doo. He loved the introduction with the gang talking, leading up to the beginning. He had the most fun when he got to visit the different sections of the park on the DVD. By doing that, he got to help his favorite mystery gang solve the crime. I recommend this for any parent whose child/children like Scooby Doo. You will be glad you bought this.",1262822400,18,437,4.407407407407407

3506387,4,B001C71IEW,My 3 & 4 year old love this game. Great mindless fun for scooby fans of all ages. Kids love it,1388707200,,94,3.5238095238095237
3506388,4,B001C71IEW,Good game but did not hold my kids attention compared to the Wii versions. They did enjoy it for awhile.,1371945600,,104,4.25
3506389,5,B001C71IEW,"This movie is a must see for children of all ages, that includes the parts of the children and so on. In any format, it is great.",1370995200,3,129,3.814814814814815
3506390,2,B001C71IEW,"My wife and I are big time Scooby-Doo fans.  I thought it would be interesting and fun to purchase this dvd game for us to play and have fun together.  Although the story is entertaining and feels like your actually watching a scooby doo show, the game in and of itself we found to be a huge disappointment.  I thought there would be more than 1 mystery to solve and there's not.  The game also is quite simple and although was fun the first time, the second, third and so on becomes boring fast.  There is however an activities mode where you can just play each of the ""mystery games"" over and over as oppose to going through the entire story mode.  I honestly think it was a waste of money; definitely not worth the price.  I can't even fathom how this would entertain kids.  Had I know what it was about, I would not have purchased it.  If your a scooby fan or you have kids, nieces or nephews that are scooby fans, I recommend purchasing a scooby series or a scooby movie as oppose to this game.  I think it would be more worth it.",1364947200,,1035,4.208121827411167
3506391,5,B001C71IEW,"My 7year old son LOVES this game! It's pretty basic, but if you're a Scooby Doo fan (or your child) you'll enjoy!",1360886400,4,113,4.181818181818182
3506392,4,B001C71IEW,"A little difficult to navigate through some of the scenes.
Overall enjoyable and fun.
I hope my son will grow into it a bit more.",1358467200,,129,4.2
3506393,4,B001C71IEW,Had fun playing with the kids.  (4 & 7 year old girls) It is something you would play once in a while. It is interactive & shows clips from the old tv shows durring the game.,1356480000,,174,3.8333333333333335
3506394,5,B001C71IEW,Always enjoyed this cartoon growing up and even newer ones coming out with today cute and fun to watch too.,1356048000,,107,4.4
8286169,5,B001C71IEW,"My 7 yr. old ""stalked"" the mail until this arrived.(I was worried it would not work with our remote)We are both very happy & it's worked great! She has played it probably 20 times & has only now grew a little bored with it. For the price I think its worth it! [I don't think this is for adults but young Scooby fans for sure.]",1522627200,,326,4.030769230769231
8286170,2,B001C71IEW,"Too easy, kiddie stuff",1515888000,,22,4.75
8286171,4,B001C71IEW,"I got this for my boyfriend because he loves Scooby Doo. He was ecstatic to get it, though it's something one might get bored of easily. Then again, this is probably intended for kids under 11/12 and could more than likely entertain them for a while. As an adult, I wouldn't buy it if you want to use it more then once. Overall though, it was a pretty good product, though the animations weren't to die for.",1515715200,,407,4.298701298701299
8286172,2,B001C71IEW,Boring but not to boring. So disappointed.,1496880000,,42,5.142857142857143
8286173,3,B001C71IEW,"Great concept, but not developed as well as it could be.  Kept a first graders i terest for a very short time and probably won't use again.",1494892800,,139,4.148148148148148
8286174,5,B001C71IEW,this was a gift for my 7 yr old..something she can do by herself that makes her think. She was very happy & I am too!!,1461456000,2,118,3.576923076923077
8286175,5,B001C71IEW,Happy with purchase,1453593600,,19,5.666666666666667
8286176,4,B001C71IEW,This has keep my child entertained forever!! He loves Scooby doo and from the second we saw this commercial he was begging for it. It has two different types of games you can play. We kept helping the team solve crimes. I would make sure your child can work a remote with the arrow buttons or this game won't much fun unless someone is doing it for them. Great way to play a family game!,1447372800,4,387,4.173333333333333
8286177,5,B001C71IEW,Kids LOVE it!,1433635200,,13,3.6666666666666665
8286178,1,B001C71IEW,I bought this for my 12 year old son and we played it as a family.  There was really no challenge to each of the sections.  I doubt he will play it again. Maybe it would be better for children around 6-7.,1420329600,2,204,3.8333333333333335
