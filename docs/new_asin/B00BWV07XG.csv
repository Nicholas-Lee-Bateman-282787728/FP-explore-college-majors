5679809,5,B00BWV07XG,"Great science fiction. As a fan of both the original and new Star Trek, the movies are great. The old series Star Trek became very trite after the Gene Roddenberry, the creator of the series, left the show; but it was really innovative for its time. The new Star Trek series was an instant hit because it went back to the original premise of science instead of formula tv.",1468627200,,372,4.405797101449275
