8458173,3,B0055EHV9E,"I could have done without the scrap metal guy, as my interest was in Jim Bishop.  I was looking for something that would reveal more depth about Jim Bishop's story beyond what I could find on the internet, but this documentary seemed pretty lazy in it's ability to dig deep.  I would have liked to have seen more about his ""ranting and raving"" or how he apparently avoided having to pay taxes on the property and all the legal battles behind his project.  Ultimately, these questions were just touched on mostly from within the perspective of the family and a few friends.  What about the community perspective, such as the neighbors, other artists, his enemies or government officials?  The cinematography and film quality also missed what I expected to be a great opportunity to show some of the artistic beauty of the castle.  The scrap metal art, which I had little interest in, even had less appeal to me because it was captured so poorly on film.  It looked like the footage was filmed in maybe a few days time, all during some crappy grey skies and damp cold weather days with no leaves on the trees ... very depressing feeling.",1456617600,,1135,4.616915422885572
8458174,4,B0055EHV9E,"This DVD gave me great insight into each of these men's private lives. The movie was very interesting in terms of giving us ""the rest of the story"" that the public does not learn from just viewing their work. The most telling scene in the movie was the segment where Tom Every's wife walked up to him to fix his blanket as he was sitting in his wheelchair (in a snowstorm) giving an interview. His reaction told the whole story. I now have GREAT respect for the wives of these two men. This documentary sheds light on the work these selfless women performed in a truly thankless environment.",1415232000,,591,4.481481481481482
8458175,5,B0055EHV9E,"For many years I have followed the building of BISHOPS CASTLE. Jim Bishop is a man with a mission and a great inspiration for anyone taking on a project the requires iron will and long standing stamina, Jim certainly has both. This video shows some of his inner thinking and a peek into his personal life through his wife and sons eyes. Jim sometimes gets a bad rap from U tube but after seeing this video you get a real respect for the man and his family. A very informative video and one place I intend to go is to see Jims Castle in the very near future.",1352937600,,557,4.166666666666667
8458176,4,B0055EHV9E,"Art never stands alone; it's always created, and we always experience it in context. What then of art that is so big, the only possible context is the entire life (and family) of the artist?

While ""Scrap"" may nominally be a documentary exploring two such monumental works of art, and two uncompromising artists who have been driven to commit their entire lives to the projects, it actually strikes me as a piece mainly (and more interestingly) stepping back to explore that context in a way which might be difficult if not impossible in any other medium.  ""Scrap"" explores these men and their worlds as much as it explores their art - their uncompromising vision and approach to life which gives them and their work focus, both for better and for worse.

Jim Bishop started working on his Castle in 1969, and has been at it ever since. With his own hands he has built his dream stone by stone, eschewing heavy equipment for sweat and ingenuity (as he describes it: ""engineering without money is ingenuity"").

Tom Every (a former key designer of Wisconsin's famed ""House on the Rock"") has likewise been at his own project for decades; the ""Forevertron"" is a massive steampunk scrap metal art installation that he began before ""steampunk"" was even a thing. Stretching out over acres, Every (adopting the persona of ""Dr. Evermore"") blends the reality of his work with fantastical story, making us sometimes wonder where one ends and the other begins (at the very least in his own mind).

Both of these men are uncompromising individualists. Their magnificent obsessions have produced work that in itself is truly impressive and inspiring, and that's even before you consider how much they've done on their own with so little. But where this documentary shines is in showing us not just the vision of the artists, but how their obsession has impacted those around them. As the wives of both these men are quick to point out: the construction may be (though as we see isn't always) a solo effort, the projects as a whole most certainly aren't. Both men's wives play an indispensable supporting role in keeping their lives together so they can pursue their art. Both men's children have likewise been drawn into the projects as they've been raised in and around them, and significantly framed their entire lives. The projects themselves take a toll on the families, the relationships, every bit as much as the toll exacted by these obsessive artists themselves.

There's a line in, of all things, the movie ""Braveheart"" that comes to mind, in which the father of Robert the Bruce is talking to his son, about the latter's admiration for William Wallace: ""Uncompromising men are easy to admire. . . [b]ut it is exactly the ability to *compromise* that makes a man noble."" I think we see some of that here, that uncompromising spirit is very easy to admire in these artists, and their work is truly impressive, but at what cost? Certainly they have foresworn any nod toward 'fitting in' with the rest of society, but then again they don't seem to have ever had any desire to do so. In the little picture, in the world of their projects that they so tenaciously pursue, they are certainly the central figures and the heroes of the tale, but once we start pulling back and panning out just a little we start seeing that the ability, the requirement to compromise is borne by those around them, and the weight becomes very heavy indeed.

This documentary does a great job of exploring that meta-level without hitting us over the head with it, showing how the art projects are in many ways a reflection of the men themselves, how the pursuit of the projects is (and more to the point is not) congruent with life in the ""real world"" of the rest of society, and how those conflicts are borne every bit as much (if not more so) by those around them who allow them to continue, as they are by the artists themselves.

At the end of the day, in my mind the success or failure of a documentary piece lies in whether or not it has made me care, has piqued my interest in some way beyond the time I've spent watching it. Here, ""Scrap"" has certainly succeeded for me. I'm not often in the areas of Bishop Castle, or the Forevertron, but now I'm certain that if I'm anywhere nearby that a side-trip to go see them will be in the offing. Even failing that, after seeing ""Scrap"" I found myself moved to hop online and start doing my own follow-up research about not just the attractions themselves, but the men behind them. What other context could I find for these men and their families? What did the documentarians leave out? What has happened since the film was finished? Any time I find myself doing that kind of after-the-fact research after seeing a documentary (especially when the subject matter didn't hold any original interest for me) I know it's done its job and done it well.

One final note, the music in this film is amazing, and amazingly well used. During the film itself, Jim Bishop comments on how a movie without music is missing something (in his own, un-edited way - I'm underselling his point). Given the use of music in ""Scrap"", I've got to think Jim would be particularly satisfied. I wonder if a ""Scrap"" soundtrack is in the offing.",1311724800,3,5236,4.670281995661605
