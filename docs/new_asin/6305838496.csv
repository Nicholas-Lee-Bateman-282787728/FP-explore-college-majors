7896806,3,6305838496,"Labeled a ""Naxos Musical Journey,"" this DVD music video from 2000 was among the first in a series of such productions from the company that had hitherto given us audio-only CDs.

But before I tell you what I think of the disc, let me make an introductory remark: A while ago I said to a friend that if it had not been for the advent of home-theater and surround sound, two-channel home stereo would be practically dead by now. What I was getting at was that in the old days a lot of people interested in music would sit in front of and between their two speakers and concentrate on the musical sounds coming at them. But I guess such people as we were, and still are, in a minority. From everyone I know come comments like, ""How do you just sit and listen to music? Isn't that a little like meditation?"" Most folks, it seems, attend to music while doing other things, sometimes not even in the same room with the music. So, for years even audiophiles would spend thousands of dollars on elaborate stereo setups and then hardly ever listen to them except, of course, to show them off to friends. Now that home theater has been with us for a good long time, people have a reason to listen attentively again. Namely, the movies they watch force them to sit in front of and often between their front speakers because that's where the TV is. And they no longer have to address the music alone; they have images to go with the sound. The world is happy.

Frankly, I still don't subscribe to this all-inclusive audiovisual theory, and I maintain two separate systems in my home: A two-channel stereo rig in the living room for music-only listening and a 7.1-channel surround-sound setup in a separate room for home theater viewing and listening. It is in this latter room that I auditioned the present crossover disc from DVD International and Naxos Records. Naturally, it combines music with pictures and does so in a relaxing audiovisual environment.

Although the music seems almost secondary to the imagery, for those interested Takako Nishizaki, Oliver Dohnanyi, and Capella Istropolitana present the Bach violin concertos in reasonably attentive if somewhat staid interpretations characteristic of the performances often recorded by Naxos. However, they are not the most lively, distinctive, or creative performances you'll find, meaning they are solid, middle-of-the-road readings, well matching the easygoing serenity of the visuals. The DVD's total running time is fifty-six minutes.

The disc offers an image in a 1.33:1 ratio, presenting a lovely pictorial survey of architecture and nature. The scenery is mostly from Italy--ancient Roman ruins, parks, palaces, interspersed with mountains, hills, valleys, vineyards, seas, bays, and such. The picture quality looks warm and inviting, sometimes quite beautiful. It sometimes looks very slightly blurred, too, but nothing to worry about, and there were a couple of instances of fluttering horizontal lines.

The audio options include Dolby Digital 5.1, Dolby 2.0, and DTS. In DD 5.1, the sound, recorded in 1989, is pleasant, a bit bright on my system but easily tamed, with a couple of occasional, extraneous bass rumblings. The rear channels hardly come alive, adding only a subtle ambiance appropriate to music reproduction. In any case, with music the listener should not actually notice the back speakers at all unless they're turned off. This is not an action movie we're listening to. Also, there is no narration on the disc, thankfully, just music and pictures, and an easy-to-use menu system allowing one to navigate quickly through the musical selections or the written travel notes. There is also an option to repeat certain chapters or play them randomly.

Now, I have to be perfectly frank with you here in saying that I found all the imagery superfluous.  Personally, I would still rather listen to a more imaginative interpretation of Bach by, say, Kuijken and La Petite Bande, Menuhin and the Bath Festival Orchestra, Grumiaux and the New Philharmonia, or Lamon and Tafelmusik than these. Then, closing my eyes and listening only, I can use my imagination to envision whatever I choose without the distracting pictures. OK, as I said before, I know I'm in a minority here.

7896807,5,6305838496,"This DVD is one of the most enjoyable in the Naxos Musical Journey series. While it may seem a bit incongruous for Bach's violin gems to be set against various Italian backgrounds, both the music and the scenery are highly enjoyable. The music is well played and well recorded, and the video direction shows both good taste and imagination.",1423180800,,340,4.779661016949152
7896808,4,6305838496,"Designed for the ill-fated Laser Disc format, the series of DVDs titled ""A Naxos Musical Journey"" is now represented by the first six offerings issued by DVD International: <Bach> (DVDI 0991) with three  of his works and the scenery of four parts of Italy, <Handel> (DVDI  0992) with his ""Water Music"" and ""Fireworks"" Suites and  the scenery of parts of England, <Italian Festival> (DVDI 0993) with  the music of several composers [only one of which is Italian],  <Mozart> (DVDI 0994) with his Symphonies No. 49 and 28 and three  overtures and the scenery of the Southern Tyrol and Austria, <Spanish  Festival> (DVDI 0995) with the music of Chabrier, Glinka, Massenet, and  Rimski-Korsakov , and finally <Vivaldi> (DVDI 0996) with his  ""Four Seasons"" and a Concerto in D minor and the scenery of  northern Europe and Scotland.
  It is strange that native composers were  not chosen in so many cases, especially in the one dedicated to Spain where  we have two Russian and two French selections, however good they might be.  But the most famous Swiss music ever written was composed by Rossini, so  what the hey!
  First the minuses. These sets were designed for the  music and the visual without any reference to specifics. By this I mean,  there are no subtitles to let you know where in Europe you are or what  music is being played. Since there is a ""Random Order"" option,  your player will not display the track being shown. I found this quite  annoying at first viewing and had to keep my eye on the back of the DVD  case to try to find where I was musically--where I was geographically was  quite impossible.
  Now I am told by a gentleman from DVD International  that many persons have already commented on this lack of features; and I am  told that all future releases will remedy what the producers did not but  what many viewers did consider a problem.
  As for what we DO have, it  is marvelous. The music is played competently to splendidly by European  groups such as the Capella Istropolitana, the Czecho-Slovak Radio Symphony,  and other players familiar to owners of Naxos CD recordings. As for the  video portion, I cannot praise it too highly, except for my not being told  where on earth such beauty exists.
  When the titles are added, this  series will make a fantastic teaching tool for geography periods in the  lower grades (why not let the tiny tots learn about the beauty of the world  and of its great music at the same time?) and even for higher-class  restaurants to play for diners. Come to think of it, even the untitled  releases will work beautifully in the latter case.",960163200,27,2603,4.688888888888889
