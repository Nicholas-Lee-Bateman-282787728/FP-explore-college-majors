2211668,5,B0007GP7MS,"You have to marvel at how much work goes into this. It's evident in every scene. It's an excellent way to introduce a child to a classic work of literature, too.",1358467200,,161,4.225806451612903
2211669,5,B0007GP7MS,"Years ago I showed this as a projected film to my 7th grade students with good effect. The colors and animation are superb. Its theme is a welcome antidote to the harsh judgment children often pass on those who don't fit a common mold. Rip is a misfit among the solemn Dutchmen of his time and place. His gifts are not practical, but rather sympathy, warmth, and song. When Rip swallows a magic draught his world unravels and swirls about him in brightly colored clay bits. It is a visually impressive and artistically astute performance. His world is stitched back together with a new slant when a wise old mountain gives him some advice about values along the lines of the lilies of the field. Very highly recommended.",1308787200,3,720,4.6328125
2211670,1,B0007GP7MS,"I bought this to show my students after they read the short story.  They asked me to stop the movie.  Really.  They would rather take a quiz than watch this.  My students are in high school and they played along for a while but then things got crazy -- bizarre music, acid flashback scenes,  and the worst part is that the movie tried to justify Rip's inability to take care of his own business.  There was a whole segment where a talking mountain let Rip know that some things are just in this world for the delight of them--in song-- hmm, no.  Rip's family doesn't even make an appearance.  Very disappointed with this.  Unless you are into early claymation,  no, even then,  skip this purchase.",1296086400,3,697,4.496
2211671,5,B0007GP7MS,"I like this series titled ""Clay Classic"" by Will Vinton quite a bit. The animation is amazing, the color, the voices, they all work great. The script follows the original short story by Washington Irving pretty faithfully. My hands down favorites in the series so far is The First Christmas (actually 3 films on 1 disc), and Martin the Cobbler. I have also seen Michael the Visitor and I hope to order some of the other titles soon.",1276732800,7,432,4.551282051282051
2211672,3,B0007GP7MS,I purchased this video for my students who read Rip Van Winkle.  It was appropriate for my special education students.,1263081600,,118,4.9
2211673,5,B0007GP7MS,I first saw this movie in the early 80s.  When I had children I picked it up on VHS.  When I saw it on DVD I had to have it.  Kids love it but so do adults.  My adult friends ask me to play it for them.  I watch it whenever I need a pick-me-up or inspiration.  BUY! BUY! BUY!,1235520000,5,275,3.5
2211674,4,B0007GP7MS,"This Claymation version of Irving's ""Rip Van Winkle"" offers a fairly accurate retelling of the legend.  What sets it apart, however, is the delightfully complex clay animation.  Facial expressions and moods are clearly shown in the animated figures, bringing surprising life to each and every character.
The songs are simple and offer good insight into the story's interpretation.
The film is generally geared towards children, but adults certainly can appreciate the artistry.
This one is definitely worth the purchase as a visual aid to teaching the old tale in most classrooms.",971395200,4,580,5.362637362637362
8047300,5,B0007GP7MS,Though this is strange and a little bit terrifying I mostly bought this because the only copy I have is a BetaMaxx tape from a long time ago. It was great. I really wish they would make this animation more often. It was such a great thing to watch as a kid.,1461456000,,257,3.9615384615384617

8047302,1,B0007GP7MS,"There is no denying the talent that produced this video.  That said, it is a very boring video.  Just not worth buying.",1450656000,,119,4.363636363636363
8047303,4,B0007GP7MS,"This was the first Claymation classic I saw (excluding the California Raisins) and fell in love with it. Old Rip tries so hard to do the right thing but always manages to get sidetracked. Thus he falls into his long, long nap only to wake and find that almost all of his friends had passed. And the music is infectious.",1417564800,,319,4.333333333333333
8047304,5,B0007GP7MS,Loved it. In great condition.,1417478400,,29,5.0
8047305,5,B0007GP7MS,Just how I remembered it when I was a kid.,1413072000,,42,3.3
8047306,5,B0007GP7MS,This is another great childhood program I will keep in my movie library till the day I die.  I can't forget how I felt when I first saw this many years ago.  This one of many Clay Classic movie should be digitized and put in HD format for the new generation of kids and adults to enjoy.,1391817600,,286,4.0
8047307,5,B0007GP7MS,A classical movie that every kid must have. A story with sensitivity and good humor. Should be in any language.,1388620800,2,111,4.6
8047308,5,B0007GP7MS,"I had this movie on VHS and watched it until the tape broke. Not because I watched it incessantly as a child, but because I kept revisiting it to enjoy the scenery, the story, the music, and ALL of the ridiculous creative imagery when Rip is not himself. It's great. I consider this truly appropriate for all ages because the lesson is universal - self-acceptance and joy. Honestly I put this on when I have a crap day and feel so much better about the world.

And for anyone with small kids, the music is varied enough that it's not really earworm material and complex enough to appeal to adults. So if they want to watch this 10 times in a row, you won't want to pull your hair out.",1375747200,2,684,4.2615384615384615
8047309,1,B0007GP7MS,"This is a third rate story someone has taken and used from the Original Rip Van Winkle by Washington Irving.  Any part of it actually coming from Irving, must be an accident.",1364601600,,174,4.4375
