so I won't say I do but I don't like like it when they are screaming in my ears.  The old songs are the best for me.  I think anyone
who like the Gaithers will like this.",1388361600,,296,3.7580645161290325
8362459,4,B002BXJYW4,"Although this is on the ""old time"" avenue of VHS tape, it is amazingly fresh and new!  Music, after all, is the key to longevity and happiness!  This music touches the heart and moves the spirit!  ""Bill Gaither Remembers Old Friends"" is a timely tribute to those who made gospel music popular and comfortable and reminds us all that we are connected by a silver thread!",1213315200,,369,4.5606060606060606
