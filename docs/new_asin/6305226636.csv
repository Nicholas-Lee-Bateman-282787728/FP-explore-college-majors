993393,3,6305226636,This movie was ok if you like a plot line that is not deep.  I don't really think the scene changes work.  Some of the characters are not developed.  this story does not stand alone. If you were not familiar with many stories of herculies than this would not only seem undeveloped but incomplete.,1314662400,,296,4.444444444444445
993394,4,6305226636,"Reg Park is perhaps the stockiest of the screen Hercules's(Herculae?) and swaggers, flexes and grunts his way through this film with beefy elan'. Fay Spain makes a great evil queen, the equal of any Disney villainess. The feisty midget kicks a$$ as a feisty midget.

  The movie has a lot of interesting themes that translate into a fun movie. It has a shape changing wizard,intrigue, a magic rock, an evil queen, Atlantis, a master race of ultimate warriors, stock footage of volcanic eruptions and a feisty midget. And lots of loose talk about the ""Power of Uranus"". As a matter of fact an entire nation worshipped Uranus. But to no avail. The ingredients are there and the result is a fine peplum of the first order.",1293494400,,719,4.690476190476191
993395,5,6305226636,"WOW. This film is awsome. It has everything from babes, midgets and muscle men, to a dragon that must be seen to be believed. All in all, awsome and worth your time.",1214524800,,165,4.1875
993396,5,6305226636,"HERCULES AND THE CAPTIVE WOMEN (also known as HERCULES CONQUERS ATLANTIS), is one of the best Sword & Sandal films ever made. It's big, colorful and very fun. If Frederico Fellini had directed an action film, it would look like this.

The film was way ahead of its time, regarding the psychedelic colors and imagery, the massive sets, the surreal action. It looks and feels like a big summer blockbuster made 47 years ago (it was made in 1961 but released in 1963 in North America). The film had a big budget and was shot in 70mm film stock and the DVD transfer, which is presented in widescreen here, has an amazing amount of details, even if the transfer itself could have been a bit better. I can't imagine how more amazing the film would look like with a perfect transfer or projected on a big cinema screen.

Reg Park fits the bill as Hercules and he does a good job but he's no Steve Reeves, Mark Forest or even Richard Harrison when it comes to acting or looks. Park is believable during the action scenes but he's a bit stiff during the acting scenes. The cast is excellent, including Fay Spain, Mimmo Palmara and the beautiful Laura Efrikian, who's a revelation here. But the best actor in this film is Ettore Manni. His acting is effortless and always believable. The DVD has the US version of the soundtrack, including the score. The only weak point I could about this film is the soundtrack. It needed more omph. I wish the Italian soundtrack was available on the DVD.

In all, I highly recommend this Peplum.

p.s.: the original title was HERCULES CONQUERS ATLANTIS but the more sensational HERCULES AND CAPTIVE WOMEN still makes sense because Laura Efrikian is seen bound to rock, with other petrified women, when Hercules fights Proteus. In fact, the whole plot is about Laura being a sacrifice.",1210032000,5,1810,4.629283489096573
993397,1,6305226636,"This is another surreal Hercules movie from Italy, this time with Reg Park as the slab of oily beef mixed up in an incoherent plot and cheesy effects. Herc ends up on Atlantis where he saves a young woman from being sacrificed. However, the girl is the queen's daughter and is immediately sent back out to be sacrificed again. This time Herc's son, who stowed away on Herc's ship, saves the girl. Herc spends some time with the curvy queen who wants to keep him in the palace so he doesn't find out what's going on. If only the writers had let the rest of us in on what was going on. There are slaves who Herc frees only to have them killed in their rebellion. The queen is raising an army of super warriors somehow through the power of Uranus. It's never exlained just how Uranus has done whatever it is he's done. They're supposed to be super fighters but Herc throws them around like they're nothing.

The only reason to watch this movie is to see Herc fight a six foot tall red lizard which is obviously a man in a lizard suit. And what the fight has to do with the plot is anybody's guess.",1201046400,3,1094,4.259615384615385
993398,4,6305226636,"What can be said about this movie. Ive seen this more than any Hercules Movie. This is one of 2 Hercules movies that I can really recommend. The other being Hercules in the Haunted World (also with Reg Park)
These were made in the 1960s where Italy was doing movies with the Gods, more or less rewriting the myths. First there was Hercules, then Maciste,Samson,Taur/Thor, the Son of Hercules Movies (some of those aren't bad either)etc
Now on to this movie
Hercules & the Captive Women has Hercules taking on bad guy / monster on the Island of Proteus AND Atlantis (hes searching for his friend who was captured during a sea quest) as well as fighting people who worship Uranus (!!).. Along for the ride are his son (Hinus?) a funny midget, a damsel in distress, Fay Spain(!!!) and some the corniest effects yet...totally entertaining
Proteus is the island/man turns into a lizard, a snake, a lion(that clearly becomes a puppet when he gets tossed by Herc) and a bird on visible wires. This had the scene with a captured female who says ""Kill me, kill me"" This was the best scene of the movie, and also the campiest cheesiest effects...the rest is still good - a lot of fun & goofy fight scenes..and the funny stock footage ending of volcanic eruptions...
This was good enough (or bad) to be on MST3k- Mystery Science Theater 3000 and this was a wise choice. The film was cut quite a bit for the show, being that the show was 97 minutes minus the commericals and this movie is 96 minutes. The best segment was Joel and the Bots doing some good natured brawling, a smack on the opening scene where crow sees Reg Park for the first time and goes ""I hope thats not Hercules!""
I like this movie on its own or via the MST3K version. I found it to be entertaining. Not a masterpiece, but some really good popcorn fun & entertaining. Glad its on DVD and in widescreen...check it out. I rate it 4 stars for its campy low budget entertainment :)..
On the DVD that Retromedia put out was Hercules Prisoner of Evil, again with Reg Park.
Other Herc films I will recommend
Hercules in the Haunted World
Medusa Against the Son of Hercules
Fire Monsters against the Son of Hercules
As much as I like Steve Reeves in Hercules and Hercles Unchained, they are a bit long & dull..better as MST3K experiments
Avoid the Hercules movies with Lou Ferrigno (sorry Lou)",1173225600,5,2344,4.517647058823529
993399,3,6305226636,"Hercules (Reg Park) is heading off somewhere when he encounters a woman trapped in a rock.  It turns out that the woman is the daughter of the Queen of Atlantis, and a sorcerer called Proteus had entrapped her in the rock to provide the blood he needed for his powers.  Hercules, always enthusiastic to save people in distress, does battle with Proteus, who is a shape shifter.  Proteus turns himself into fire (a cool special effect), a dinosaur (not so cool, looks like a guy in a suit), and a buzzard (attack buzzard; not very realistic).  Of course Hercules prevails over Proteus.

It turns out that the Antinea, Queen of Atlantis (Fay Spain), is unenthused about her daughter returning.  In fact, Antinea seems quite enthusiastic about sacrificing people to various gods and other beings, one of those being Uranus, who left a drop of his blood nearby.  Antinea has been exposing children to the blood to create warriors.

In the course of all this rescuing, Hercules is looking for a friend who washed overboard during a storm.  Of course Antinea has captured his friend and has treated him so that he has lost his memory.

To add a little spice to the mixture, a local priest wants Hercules to expose the blood of Uranus to sunlight, which will cause havoc of all sorts and end the reign of tyranny by Antinea.

This movie is reasonably good.  I had to laugh at the concept that Hercules caused the sinking of Atlantis, but since there is a lot of debate about whether Atlantis ever existed, and if it did, what caused it to sink, well, why not Hercules?  Otherwise, Reg Park plays Hercules in a very casual manner, somewhat like Arnold Schwarzenneger's Conan.  Hercules seems lazy and carefree in this movie.

I hesitate to recommend this movie because the Italian sword-and-sandals genre is many decades in the past.  If you have seen other Italian Hercules movies and liked them, then you will mostly likely enjoy this one.  However, remember that this movie was filmed in 1961 and production values were very different then.  Also, this movie is dubbed from the original Italian, so there are occasional problems with the dialogue syncing with the scenes.  Good luck!",1138406400,4,2178,4.775401069518717
993400,3,6305226636,"A cut above the ususal muscle-man, sand-and-sandal movie. The plot, such as it is, hinges on exposing children to a drop of blood shed by the god Uranus as he flew into the sky fleeing the attack of his son Cronos. This ""drop"" of blood has burned its way into a mountain and the children are brought to this cave to be exposed to it and thereby turned into invincible warriors who, when they finally take off their helmets, look like some terrifying Nazi cloning experiment. For just a moment, this movie truly captures the wonder and awe of Greek myth. Reg Park is fine as Hercules -- rather less wooden than most, and the rest of the cast is OK. There's the usual bad dubbing and absurd dialogue. But there are genuine moments of wonder and a nice surprise or two.",1089072000,3,766,4.401408450704225
993401,3,6305226636,"This film is probably the definitive Hercules movie starring the definitive Hercules, Reg Park.  Not only does he look the part, his lightweight, yet sincere performance adds a great deal of depth to what  would otherwise be a two dimensional character.  His personality actually  penetrates the clumsy dubbing.  Unfortunately, this edition of the film is  not the full European version, adding new titles and a needless voice over  explaining plot and character motivation which we really don't need.  Also,  much of the original music score is lost in the process.  This is also the  case for ""Hercules in the Haunted World"", a film distributed by  the same company as this one.  The intention is to link the two films, when  in fact they are two different visions by two different directors.  But  this aside, Reg Park is the greatest Hercules on screen, followed by Steve  Reeves as a close second, so enjoy the fun.",961459200,8,920,4.87012987012987
7885618,2,6305226636,"This review is for the Synergy DVD version that is available with Prime.  Absolutely horrible picture quality.  Very faded colors.  Very bright, washed out picture.  Extremely pixelated.  It's no better than a VHS copy.  Heck, a VHS copy might actually be better.  This movie itself might be pretty good but don't waste your money buying this particular copy unless you really, really must see it...and then you'll struggle to actually see it because the video quality is so poor.",1497916800,,480,5.0

The DVD is not mastered very well, though.  Despite a nice, clean bright anamorphic print, there is quite a bit of compression and the image is badly pixelated during fast movements.  Bright reds tend to be striped as well.  A pity a bit more care wasn't taken with the mastering.  However the film is great and everything you've heard about the impressive, mammoth sets is truethey're amazing.  Reg Park makes a great hero and Fay Spain makes a great villain.
