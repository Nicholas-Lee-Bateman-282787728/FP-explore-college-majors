612755,4,6303257380,"Bela Lugosi is Armand Tesla, an amazingly Dracula-like vampire, in this fangy fable. Assisted by his werewolf helper Andreas Obry (Matt Willis), Tesla goes on a reign of terror, only to be stopped by a spike through the heart. Years later, during WWII, we find Andreas reformed of his lycanthropic ways, and working for Lady Jane, the very woman who had helped put an end to Tesla. Well, the nazi's bomb England, unearthing Tesla. Two civil defense guys find his body and one of them pulls the spike out of Tesla's chest! Soon, The bloodsucking begins! Tesla regains his hold on Andreas and hatches his plot for revenge. Tesla now has a vendetta against Lady Jane. He has decided to destroy her by taking control of those she loves. Can Lady Jane stop him before it's too late? You can tell that Bela enjoyed playing this role. He IS Dracula in this movie, no matter what his name is. The acting is pretty good all around, including the wolfman, even if his make-up job is a tad goofy. Worth owning...",1081555200,5,1001,4.566666666666666
612756,4,6303257380,"I can't carp about this little 40's spooker with LUGOSI playing Dracula again (finally) even if it IS low-budget and has a funny-looking werewolf/assistant. It's still a curio and features a wartime setting as well as the lovely Nina Foch (in an early role) as a potential victim. It's goofy and weird and not all that bad, really. At least it was a major studio that released it and not one of those hideous poverty row junkfests that were churned out by the truckload around the same time. The class shows through with the acting,camera-work and story coherence. It could have been much worse but it's not and it sits proudly with my other DVDS as an old fashioned reminder of what going to the movies used to be about and how thankful I am that some of these old chestnuts are still around to be appreciated.",1031875200,16,811,4.523809523809524
612757,4,6303257380,"The definitive movie vampire, Bela Lugosi, stars in this entertaining Columbia production.  Although mired in a downward career spiral of poverty row clunkers, Bela, ahem, rises to the occasion.  Among the familiar vampire cliches, we find a unique character in Andreas (Matt Willis), the wolf man familiar that serves the vampire.  This guy looks like Lon Chaney, Jr. in full makeup, but he does not go around howling at the full moon.  Instead, he shows great restraint and is quite articulate as he speaks rather than growls.  His fiendish appearance tells of the soul's evil and the vampire's spell.  After a prologue, that shows the vampire's 1918 horror and dispatch, Andreas escapes the dark side with help from a kindly lady scientist (Frieda Inescort).  He falls back into dreadful habits after a WWII bombing raid unearths Bela.  The scenes in the London cemetery inflicted with bomb damage are surreal images of foggy darkness and the children of the night.  The script suffers from some B picture limitations, but not enough to matter.  Lugosi's character, Armand Tesla, is merely Dracula, winking at legal copyright infringements.  He catches Nina Foch in his alluring web of unholy desire.  The climax in the bombed-out church is done well, and covers a multitude of unlikely plot developments.  Character actor and former Mack Sennett star, Billy Bevan, plays Horace, the comic civil defense worker who utters the above immortal dialogue.  Some viewers may recognize Bevan as the hapless Whitby policeman, Albert, in Universal's ""Dracula's Daughter.""  Atmospheric sets and a veteran cast add to the enjoyment.  Great fun for genre fans and collectors.  ;-)",1028592000,62,1671,5.198501872659176
612758,3,6303257380,"A little bit too much dry ice lurking around the soundstage but as atmospheric as you could get on a shoestring. Full of terrific imagery not least the hammer and sickle as the two cockney gravediggers walk through the graveyard. A key scene, I think. Watch for the shovel getting caught by a shrub's branch and marvel at the anti communist symbolism. I believe the film is clearly saying at this point that there's more to fear from the living...ie communists....than the dead. Maybe they're the same thing.

612759,4,6303257380,"This is a brilliant, underrated picture, featuring Bela Lugosi playing a real vampire for only the second time in his career. Here, he is aided by a talking werewolf who, although looks a little tatty, has rather more  character to him than Lon Chaney's more famous lycanthrope. If you let  yourself believe in such concepts, you will probably find this film  enjoyable and even a little shocking.  Lugosi plays Armand Tesla (basically  Dracula under another name), who returns to claim the heroine (played by  Nina Foch) after 'marking' her when she was a child. However, the werewolf  with a heart eventually turns on him and drags him out into the sunlight,  where he melts in spectacular fashion. Original touches, such as the  inclusion of the very real (at the time) Second World War, the  afore-mentioned werewolf and Miles Mander's final words to the camera, are  mixed with traditional fog-bound graveyards, howling wolves and long-caped  vampires, and are married together with startling effect. It is well played  throughout, especially by Lugosi, who seems to relish the part, and  urgently requires reappraisal from horror buffs. It was to have marked the  start of a series of Lugosi-vampire films from Columbia, but Universal,  worried by the similarities to it and their Dracula films, insisted against  it.",963446400,32,1323,5.136150234741784

612829,4,6303257380,"The general concensus seems to be that Return of the Vampire is an inferior ""unofficial"" sequel to Universal's classic version of Dracula, which of course stands as perhaps the foremost cinematic version of Bram Stoker's famous novel. And indeed, Return of the Vampire does borrow a great deal from the Universal film, not the least being Bela Lugosi himself in a virtual reprisal of his celebrated role. That being said, Return of the Vampire is a very effective film in its own right, one which is cleverly written and creatively directed, and which allows Lugosi to effectively enlarge upon his iconic performance as the Prince of Vampires.

Director Lew Anders deserves a lot of the credit for the quality of Return of the Vampire. The plot moves quickly and everything is absolutely saturated in Gothic ambiance. The closed-in atmosphere, centered around a few central sets and principal characters (much like the Tod Browning-directed Dracula), is used to marvelous effect and creates a dream-like quality surpassed by few other films of its day. Produced in 1944, the film incorporates the London Blitz into its narrative, and this element serves to produce a couple of key plot points. There is some humor, mostly of the understated sort, but for the most part the story is straightforwardly told and is admirably sober.

The cast does a fine job all-round. Frieda Insescourt takes on the role of a feminine version of Dr. Van Helsing and handles it very well, conveying just the right amount of matronly authority. The extremely lovely Nina Foch captures viewer empathy as the innocent and unsuspecting object of the villain's unholy desires, and the expressiveness of Foch's dramatic performance makes the key scenes where she is under the vampire's spell especially resonant. Also impressive is Matt Willis as the vampire's werewolf henchman, a cursed soul who loathes his master's power over him even as he revels in it. The werewolf's struggle for salvation is one of the story's vital subplots, and one which Willis imbues with all the necessary pathos.

But of course the standout performance belongs to Bela Lugosi. Lugosi will be remembered forever for Dracula, but his portrayal of this film's vampire--Armand Tesla--arguably surpasses even that. Lugosi radiates evil almost palpably, yet when Tesla is required to put on the mask of a harmless gentleman the seamless transition is in and of itself rather unsettling. For all practical purposes, Lugosi is playing Dracula again--but this time around his performance is even more nuanced and believable. Lugosi's Tesla is a truly malevolent master vampire, and when Lugosi turns his hypnotic glare upon his victim the actor leaves no doubt in the viewer's mind that resistance is indeed hopeless.

Classic horror, especially from the pre-Hammer days, is something of an acquired taste, and many of today's horror fans don't want to watch the old black-and-white gems. That's a pity. These older films are classics for a reason, and the best ones stand the test of time. Return of the Vampire is a fine addition to vampire cinema, and offered Lugosi the chance to basically play Dracula one more time. Thanks to solid direction, a strong plot line, and inspired performances from virtually the entire cast, it remains an entertaining movie that all fans of classic horror should see at least once.",1437955200,,3363,5.098003629764065

612889,5,6303257380,"I liked the concept, a pseudo-documentary of sorts, as a narrator explains that the following events were taken from the notes of a certain professor (as though that would lend credence to the notion of a vampire with a werewolf sidekick ravaging the neighborhood).  Only this particular doggy is of the yappy sort.  ""Master, it's night again.""  As with most dogs, he's anxious to please.  Sadly, the werewolf makeup does tend to look a little silly when too well lit and at the wrong angle.  The vampire (Bela Lugosi as Armand Tesla), on the other hand, is kept a mystery for quite some time which makes his character all the more intriguing.  He's introduced as a guy (could be any guy) in a cape with a high collar, seen from the back.  In fact, Lugosi isn't clearly identified until the story jumps 24 years into the future.  When he's finally revealed in a splendid close-up, the effect is quite chilling.  The film practically oozes atmosphere, lots of dark shadows, fog, things shown in silhouette, a child in jeopardy.  It's also a fabulous tale of revenge.  The vampire is more than a little miffed when the professor (mentioned in the opening narration) and Dr. Lady Jane Ainsley (Frieda Inescort) stake him with a spike, putting him out of commission until the war intervenes with a well aimed bomb.  A couple of dopey gravediggers remove the spike before reburying the corpse.  At this point, Armand Tesla insinuates himself into Lady Jane's life by taking the identity of a doctor she's expecting.

I found the plot engrossing.  It's a fun film that goes directly into my collection.  I actually prefer Lugosi's performance in this film over that of Dracula, mainly because he's given more to convey in this film and he makes the most of the opportunity.

THE RETURN OF THE VAMPIRE may be the first horror picture to feature both a werewolf and vampire. It's an interesting WWII-era 'B' grade Bela Lugosi movie, made by not UNIVERSAL but COLUMBIA. There's plenty of gothic atmosphere, fog and a caped Lugosi oozing his lines at Nina Foch to enchant and delight fans.

His assistant, a talking werewolf who stays hirsute even in the day and when the moon isn't full, is to some this picture's weakest element. Suggest you ignore the beast and concentrate on Bela's beautiful performance instead.",1392854400,,755,5.032

The idea of being revived by a WWII bombing actually plays out better than it reads in the movie description. Bela is, and always will be, the best Drac/Vamp. Make no mistake, this is Dracula with a different name. The acting is mostly good. There are a couple things in the movie that disappointed me. The death scenes were um, let's say somewhat muted. Sorry, not sure how to describe it without giving it away. Also, I felt the werewolf character and acting were pretty poor. The wolfie in this one is turned into a wolf merely by the hypnotic gaze of the vampire (not a full moon), is able to move around in the daylight, is not particularly strong, and does a lot of cowering. There are a couple of minor comic relief characters which you will either like or not depending on how serious you like your monster flicks.

A couple of scenes have a lot of the flying white specks in them, mostly at the beginning and then the bombing scene later on. Other than that, sound and picture are in good shape.

613033,4,6303257380,"In the 18th-century, Dr. Armand Tesla, a ""depraved"" Romanian scientist, developed an unhealthy obsession with the supernatural--vampires in particular--and became a foul creature of the night shortly after his death. Flash forward to 1918 and Tesla, with the help of his rather pathetic werewolf slave, has relocated to a desolate cemetery in London. After preying on the young niece of the intrepid scientist Walter Saunders, who immediately deduces a vampire is on the loose, Saunders and his colleague Lady Jane Ainsley find the vampire in his lair & drive a spike through his heart.

Twenty-five years later, German bombers disturb the cemetery where Tesla lays at rest & two cockney civil-defense workers remove the stake from the vampire's unearthed body. That night, Tesla sets out to reclaim his now reformed flunky, Andreas, whose ""iron-will"" shows through as it takes no more than a few minutes in Tesla's presence before he's furring out again. The vampire sets out to take revenge on those responsible for his quarter-century dirtnap, but like all malevolent beings in these types of horror films, his cruel mistreatment of his servant will eventually come back to bite him...

""The Return of the Vampire"", while no masterpiece, is chock full of some wonderful atmosphere & images: the fog-bound cemeteries, Lugosi's outstretched cape, the entranced young beauty (Nina Foch) hypnotically walking through the graveyard. Speaking of those graveyards, have you ever stopped to wonder how this vampire can be so repulsed when a cross is shoved in his face, yet has no trouble stalking around cemeteries littered with giant stone-crosses.

Lugosi, of course, still has his vampire-mojo working, his line readings being as priceless as ever. As for his servant, was there any point in subjecting Matt Willis to a werewolf makeup, aside from Columbia feeling the need to jump on the bandwagon in light of that ""Wolf Man"" character that was making money for Universal Pictures. Matt's role could've just as easily been played as a totally human lapdog (ala Renfield).

613038,3,6303257380,"The Return of the Vampire(released Jan/44)stars Bela Lugosi reprising,yet again,his famous vampiric role,here as Armand Tesla. Columbia couldn't use the name Dracula,so they settled for that name. He is ably backed by Frieda Inescort as Lady Jane Ainsley,Nina Foch as Nicki Saunders,Miles Mander as Sir Fredrick Fleet,Roland Varno as John Ainsley,Matt Willis as Andreas Obry/The Werewolf,and others. No matter how able his co stars are,this film puts the B(for bad)in B pictures.
The plot is quite the intricate one for a B-film but it starts out with a scary tomb and a werewolf dressed in a suit,who comes to wake his master out of his coffin(you know who).They start talking about a patient in a local sanatorium. We switch to the hospital and a doctor there is commenting to a Lady Ainsley,his assistant,about their patient's anemia. The patient is left with an attendant and as the vampire cannot gain access to the patient,he attacks the doctors young girl Nikki. The doctor stays up at night reading a manuscript on vampires by one Dr. Tesla(the vampire himself and written some 200 years before).The next day the patient is found dead and the doctor then notices two puncture marks on the neck and surmises it is vampiric in nature. The doctor also finds two such marks on his daughter who they cannot readily awaken. He saves her by giving her a blood transfusion. The doctor,accompanied by Ainsley,finds the vampire's coffin and drives a stake into its heart. At the same time his werewolf assistant arrives and the spell put on him by the vampire is taken away,and he returns to be being human.
Almost 25 years pass and Ainsley is talking to the head of Scotland yard about just the same occurrences of 25 years before,and he tells her if he can find the body of the person they staked,she may be liable for charges of murder. In the meantime Ainsley has rehabilitated the werewolf,called Andreas,who works relentlessly for the now older Ainsley. This is London in WW2,and a German bombing dislodges the very coffin containing the body of the staked vampire. Two men come by to re-inter the corpses and one of them,noticing the stake in the heart,mistakes it for some shrapnel and pulls it out before they bury it. This of course has the unintended consequence of raising the vampire from the dead once more.
Back at the Ainsley house,Ainsley tells Andreas to go to meet a Dr Bruckner at the docks,as the scientist has escaped successfully from a concentration camp. Andreas goes off but gets stopped by his old master Tesla,who puts his spell back on him and he turns back into a werewolf. Andreas returns with the scientist's papers and effects to Tesla,as he has dispatched the good scientist and the men accompanying him. Tesla will now pose as Bruckner to get to his old nemesis Ainsley. Meanwhile the Scotland Yard head and Ainsley have found the grave of where the vampire was supposed to have been reburied,but it is empty. Ainsley is off of a murder rap,but Tesla is on the loose but good.
Tesla as Bruckner has Ainsley fooled for quite a time,but the Scotland Yard chief has his doubts about him,as his behaviour is erratic and strange. The chief doesn't believe in vampires and the such,just that Bruckner seems to be not who he claims. An important manuscript goes missing from one of Ainsley's locked desks and it is Andreas who is found to be the culprit. In fact Andreas even turns into a werewolf and scuffles with two police plainclothes men,but gets away.
Events are moving faster and Tesla's cover is slowly being blown. He makes a move to abduct Ainsley's now grown up daughter Nikki. Andreas helps in his attempt but as he carries the limp Nikki in his arms to his master,he gets shot. He manages to get Nikki to Tesla,and asks for his help with his wound. Tesla shrugs Andreas off and tells him to go into the corner and die. A bomb falls and it knocks both unconscious. When the dust clears and Andreas wakes,he drags Tesla into the sunlight,stakes him and falls over dead.
The film ends as the Scotland Yard chief is asking his plainclothes men whether they believe in vampires,and then he faces the camera and asks us.
The film just creaks along and the cheap sets and effects really off-set the feel the makers were trying to achieve. Lugosi is seen only from behind or the side,and never in full face,until a good portion of the first part of the film has passed. This makes me doubt whether it was really him walking around or in silhouette. Andreas as the werewolf is more cute than scary. Actually he looks better dressed than some of the others(nice tailor).Lugosi doesn't seem himself here,and in fact I noticed in one scene where he steps sideways down some stairs while talking to someone,he seemed very stiff and almost faltered. There are the unplausible scenes,such as Nikki's fiance running way ahead of Ainsley up a winding staircase,then in the next shot it's them entering a room,and she is right in lock step with him. Then there is Andreas getting shot by the Scotland Yard chief. He and Ainsley are right behind him carrying Nikki at that point,but next thing you know he is carrying Nikki into Tesla's lair and no one is anywhere around. In reality they should have beat Andreas to Tesla! Then there is the murder rap the good chief tried to pin on poor Ainsley after 25 years!?? I couldn't swallow that one. This film was produced by Sam White,the brother to the famous Columbia short subjects director Jules White. Crossing the T's and dotting the I's were not a trademark of either men.
Technically speaking the film is in its full screen presentation and could use a remastering,as it has alot of age related defects. No extras are here to speak of.
All in all a movie,the very epitome of the negative definition of a B-movie:a well worn star reprising a well worn role,cheap budget,overly intricate and flaw filled plot,and coming in at around 70 minutes. While the film does strive to develop a certain mood,the film will,more often than not,sabotage itself. Not recommended.",1351468800,2,6037,4.766953199617956

613083,4,6303257380,"Bela is back in a Columbia picture directed by Lew Landers, as a vampire who, with his well-spoken, Oxford educated (apparently) werewolf, stalk a cemetery in England.

The werewolf walked up to the coffin where Tesla hangs out (Armand Tesla, who also happens to be a published author of the supernatural) and gives Tesla a weather report of the night and fog.  Being questioned, the werewolf admits to looking in a young lady's room (peeping Tom, man!) who was recently bitten by the vamp.

The doctors and scientists are puzzled.  ""This goes deeper than science"", intones one professor.

And you know it's a Columbia picture by the introduction of two English children who are begging their parents if they could play the piano before going to bed.  So cultured!  In a Universal picture, they'd be screaming their guts out by now.  But I digress.

I spoke too soon!  Next scene, the children's room.  They're sleeping soundly, except for the little girl who tosses and turns.  A pane of glass pops from the French doors and in glides Tesla.  Uh oh!

I must say the acting of the professor and the woman scientist is very stilted.  ""Did imagination cause those marks?""  and ""We must try them (cemeteries) both, are you coming with me?"" ""Yes.""  As if he's asking her to go to the supermarket or something.  The acting lacks depth.

I found it interesting that the vampire gets staked early on in the film and that the werewolf (who was apparently carrying his laundry or something) is released from the vampyric spell and becomes ""normal"" again ,and works with Lady Jane and the professor, two of the most calm, normal people who have ever graced a horror movie!  Ghastly!  Love the werewolf in a suit!

There are great moments of suspense and intrigue as Tesla pretends he is a visiting scientist recently escaped from the Nazi's, as he tries to pick up where he left off (biting Nicky and now trying to get her).  Cool stuff.

The film is very ""talkie"" and we have to go through tediously long conversations of how it's so impossible, what the legends say, etc., etc., yak yak yak.  A Universal picture would have suspense and buckets of blood and horror by this time.  Sigh.

Many years later the little girl grows up.  The werewolf is now an assistant to Lady Jane, and Scotland Yard wants to lock her up for driving the stake through a dead body.  Huh?  First off, the guy was already dead.  And secondly if they pull that stake out, per Hollywood horror legend mythology, Tesla may return!  Yay!

The comedy relief with the Civil Defense boys is cute but typical.  ""Ain't even safe to be dead"" is an ironic line.  The ""Jerrys"" bombed the cemetery and the boys are cleaning up.

The story overall has suspense, is a bit too talkie and the acting tends to be stilted and dramatic, as if I'm watching a Bogart picture than a horror film.

Bela Lugosi as usual is intense and hasn't lost his bite!

613084,4,6303257380,"This surprisingly good tale has Bela Lugosi donning a Dracula-like cape, this time playing a Romanian vampire named Armand Tesla.  Tesla was a scientist seeking eternal life who eventually became a vampire.  Tesla lives in a cemetary mauseleum protected by his talking werewolf servant Andreas.  Throughout the film Andreas seems to always be carrying a package that looks like his laundry.

The story begins during WW I where Tessla is visiting a rich scientist's mansion, first praying on a woman then his young daughter (I wonder how that one got past the censors back then).  The scientist and his wife seek out the vampire during the day and locate his hiding place at the cemetary (they follow barefoot footprints in the cemetary to the mauseleum.  They are about to spike him when Andreas returns.  He tells them to basically go ahead and after the dead is performed, Andreas is transformed into a man.

Tesla's body is buried in a secret grave and Andreas goes to work for the scientists.  Things stay quiet until the beginning of WW II.  The Germans (they are called Jerrys in the film) start bombing raids and for some reason they decide to bomb the cemetary (they want to make sure those dead people stay dead).  The force of one of the explosions exposes the hidden grave of Tesla.  Some comical grave diggers come by and see Tesla and figure that the spike should be removed before they rebury him (you wonder why his body isn't destroyed because he is in sunlight when they find him).  Off course Tesla comes to life again after sundown and seeks out Andreas again.

Tesla assumes the identity of a visiting doctor that Andreas has disposed of.  He arrives at the mansion and of course is the charming visiting guest (looks like a scene from any Dracula movie).  Of course Tesla is after the little girl who is now grown into a beautiful woman.  The female scientist starts to realize what is happening and must figure a way to defeat Tesla again before everyone ends up a victim.

The movie is fun and a good period piece.  Though it was made by Columbia, it has the look and feel of any of the classic Universal monster films.  The DVD extras include a hysterical trailer for Hammer's Revenge of Frankenstein as well as the trailer for Brahm Stoker's Dracula.",1261353600,2,2275,4.668341708542713
613085,2,6303257380,"This movie will only be of interest to fans of the Universal horror films. The production imitates the popular Universal horrors, even to the extent of casting Bela Lugosi as a vampire with a werewolf sidekick, but in most departments it falls far short.

The story itself is interesting, and touches on Stoker's original Dracula plot, but the dialogue is terribly clunky, and there are a couple of major plot holes (to do with Jane not recognising Tesla, and the inconsistent effect of crucifixes). The acting is not up to Universal's standard, but this may partly be due to a rushed production schedule. The sets are atmospheric (especially the overgrown graveyard), though obviously done on a budget (Lady Jane's staircase looks like a parade of showgirls will dance down it at any minute). Sadly, the director wastes many opportunities to create atmosphere or drama, and doesn't even bother to hide the blank wall at the back of the graveyard set. The music by Tedesco is a high point - written to resemble the work of Salter, Skinner, et al. at Universal, it is nonetheless original and well crafted, though the small size of the orchestra reveals itself.

Lastly, Lugosi himself is actually not on-screen for long, and when he is, his enfeeblement (due to sciatica) is obvious. The slipshod direction does not give him a chance to shine as he does in other roles.

The Universal horror films were ostensibly B movies, but, with Universal's lavish resources, could boast the production standards of an A picture. Columbia's imitation, in comparison, is notably inferior in almost every respect, and falls well below even Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man, arguably the weakest of the Universal series. If you are a fan of the Universal horror films, you'll find Return of the Vampire makes an interesting point of comparison, but don't expect to find present the same elements that make those films so enjoyable.",1256083200,6,1915,4.959501557632398

613089,4,6303257380,"During the 1930s and 1940s, Universal Studios had a string of hits with horror films. Most of these films went on to become classics, mainly because of the presence of three actors:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bla-Lugosi/dp/B0009X770E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bla Lugosi</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Boris-Karloff/dp/B000FWHW8Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Boris Karloff</a>, and Lon Chaney, Jr.. Universal was then imitated by many other studios that tried to capitalize on the success of these iconic horror films, but typically the results were disastrous. There were, however, a few noteworthy exceptions. In the Columbia Pictures film, The Return of the Vampire, Bla Lugosi once again played a bloodsucker, though this time in World War II England. His role as Armand Tesla is almost identical to the role he played in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dracula/dp/B000GPIPSS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dracula</a>, which was the classic film from Universal that spawned the horror movie craze. Along with Bla Lugosi playing the archetypal vampire, there is also a reluctant werewolf, and a chase seen through a fog-enshrouded cemetery; all of these things, which could be attributed to the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Universal-Monster/dp/B0001CNRNO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Universal Monster</a>&nbsp;cycle of films. Unlike most attempts at recreating the atmosphere of the Universal films, The Return of the Vampire succeeds on most levels. The acting is of the same style and quality of the Universal films and look of the sets and costumes is very close to those films. The film so closely resembles the horror films of Universal that I'm surprised that the Universal Studios didn't sue for plagiarism. Luckily they did not.

During the air raids in London a vampire named Armand Tesla is accidentally resurrected after a bomb blast disturbs his coffin. He sets out to destroy those responsible for his temporary demise twenty-three years earlier. Tesla targets the offspring of his assailants, Lady Jane and Professor Saunders. He once again calls upon his slave, the reluctant werewolf Andras to help him carry out his insidious plans. But little does Tesla realize that in his absence, Lady Jane has been teaching Andras to resist his master's hypnotic powers. As Tesla takes his revenge, Lady Jane is forced to consider the possibility that only through sacrificing her son, John and Professor Saunders' granddaughter, Nikki will they be able to stop Tesla from spreading his plague of death and vampirism. But can Armand Tesla be thwarted?

While Bla Lugosi's performance is by no stretch of the imagination groundbreaking, viewers will delight in seeing him once again playing a Count Dracula-like vampire. The  cast also includes Nina Foch, who later would famously declare that she hated horror films.
While the plot is not that dissimilar from other horror films of the time, it is interesting to see a B-movie address the war, even if they merely exploit it as a plot device. Most films intentionally avoided the subject for fear of depressing audiences further.
It's also fascinating to take note that Lugosi's costume is almost exactly the same as the one he wore in Dracula, and some film historians have even suggested that the costume he wore was that from the 1927 stage play of Dracula.
Despite it's predictable plot and hammy acting, The Return of the Vampire is a must-have for horror fans, if not for its story then for its star, Bla Lugosi. Another reason for adding this often-overlooked film to your collection is its novel ending. After seeing the disintegrated corpse of the vampire, a skeptical police investigator turns toward the camera and actually asks viewers if they believe in the existence of vampires. Priceless!

613090,4,6303257380,"I have loved this movie ever since I was a kid, because it has absolutely everything, including classic British character actors, comedy, atmosphere, and above all, a talking werewolf who aids the title vampire.

A talking werewolf is unusual enough, but this one is also quite talkative, asking his master questions, making jokes, laughing, and generally capering around in a most lively manner. The actor Matt Willis is almost unknown outside of this one role, but he had a wonderful voice that gives a strange charisma to the werewolf's conversations with his vampire boss.

Lugosi plays vampire Armand Tesla for all it's worth, creating a truly sinister character. Some of his speeches sound curiously Fascist in their ideas about power and dominance, which may well have been intentional, given the World War Two production date.

Anyone who enjoys old horror movies or is a Lugosi fan should see this picture. It is odd, funny and unforgettable. It may not be great cinematic art, but it is one of the most purely entertaining movies ever made.",1223856000,,1050,4.988571428571428

613133,4,6303257380,"After appearing in a slew of poverty row features throughout the 1930s and into the 1940s there's slight sense of renewal in seeing Bela Lugosi donning the role of a vampire in the film Return of the Vampire (1944).  Oh sure, his character here isn't the same as the one he most famously portrayed in Tod Browning's Dracula (1931), but it might as well be...directed by Lew Landers (The Raven, Condemned Women), based on an idea from Kurt Neumann (Kronos, The Fly), the film stars, as I've mentioned, Bela Lugosi (Dracula, White Zombie).  Also appearing is Frieda Inescort (The Alligator People), Nina Foch (Cry of the Werewolf), Roland Varno (Women in Bondage), Matt Willis (The Mark of the Whistler), Gilbert Emery (The House of the Seven Gables), and Miles Mander (Tower of London, The House of the Seven Gables), probably best remembered as his role of Cardinal Richelieu from the classic film The Three Musketeers (1939).

As the film begins we learn the year is 1918, and we're in the outskirts of London.  Seems a woman, now a patient of a sanitarium run by a woman named Lady Jane Ainsley (Inescort), is suffering from a strange case of anemia, enough so to warrant Lady Jane to call in a colleague named Dr. Walter Saunders (Emery).  After reviewing the works of a Romanian scientist named Armand Tesla, an authority on vampires, who's been dead for the past two hundred years, Saunders believes the woman's condition is tied to the supernatural.  After Saunder's granddaughter Nicki is attacked, he and Lady Jane seek out the creature and stake it up good.  Flash forward about twenty five years and we learn Lady Jane's son John Varno is engaged to Nicki (Foch).  As the Jerries (i.e. the Germans) are aerial blitz bombing England (WWII was in full swing by this point), the vampire's grave is unearthed, and later a couple of comic relief types charged with graveyard detail cleanup remove the spike, which, as you can guess, brings the vampire back to life.  Oh, by the way, the vampire is actually Armand Tesla (Lugosi) himself.  Anyway, with his wolf man minion Andreas (Willis) in tow, Armand poses as a scientist named Hugo Bruckner, a recent escapee of a German concentration camp, to get close to Lady Jane and her family in order to exact his revenge for what went down so long ago, his dastardly scheme involving turning Nicki into pawn to do his bidding (man, vampires sure are a vindictive lot).  Lady Jane soon realizes what's going on and enlists the aid of a skeptical Scotland Yard commissioner named Sir Frederick Fleet (Manders) to help her free her family of the curse of Tesla and put an end to the menace once and for all...

I think this film has a number of things going for it, the main being the presence of Bela Lugosi in the role of the vampire.  Lugosi, who was in his early sixties at the time (I believe), still possessed a good deal of what he displayed some thirteen years prior in his landmark role of Dracula (charm, allure, magnetism, call it what you will).  That's not to say this film is on par with Dracula, because it's not, but it is still a lot of fun, especially if you enjoy old timey monster movies (you know I do).  I think the thing that hurts this film the most is the writing.  It's not that it's bad, but it just feels so derivative of what came before.  A number of aspects to sort of make up for this, including the solid performances, the decent direction, the atmospheric settings, and the overall strong production values (the graveyard bits were especially ookie).  The wolf man bit tended to draw a few chuckles from myself as the character spent an inordinate amount of time slinking about, carrying, for reasons not entirely clear, Tesla's laundry bundled up in a paper parcel.  I guess when you've spent the last twenty odd years in the ground, your clothes tend to get a bit rank, so it's advisable to always keep a clean outfit on hand.  It's unclear why Tesla maintained a lackey in the form of a wolf man, other than it allowed for the inclusion of two monster type creatures rather than one.  The wolf man character didn't seem to follow the established structure presented in past films in that his transformation here seemed voluntary, an aspect he could almost control, and not something dependant on the lunar cycles.  I was willing to go along with this, but I was slightly annoyed by the fact he was relegated strictly as a lackey, present only to do the bidding of his vampire master.  In my mind frame, a wolf man is no one's subordinate, except maybe for his lunar mistress.  In wolf form Andreas really didn't seem all that menacing, but more like an oversized yappy dog in search of a treat.  Another element I found a little hard to swallow was how quickly the scientific types were willing to buy off on the supernatural as being the cause for a strange, unexplained ailment.  I suppose given the fact the film only runs about an hour and ten minutes there wasn't time allowed for them to deal with putting aside their secular leanings in order to accept the mythical, but still they, being Dr. Saunders and Lady Jane, seemed awfully easy to convince, based on so little, at least initially (then again, it is just a movie, so perhaps I shouldn't read so much into it).  Taken for what it is, a middling monster movie loaded with atmosphere, the film is a lot of fun, and worth seeing if only to show Lugosi still had it, it being the ability to bring forth, many years after the fact, from a role he literally defined.

The picture on this Columbia/Tri-Star DVD release presented in fullscreen (1.33:1), looks relatively clean and clear, but does display some occasional white specking.  The latter didn't bother me much as it didn't seem present throughout, and picture comes off as well as most any have probably ever seen it, bar those who may have been present for the original theatrical release.  One noteworthy aspect is the inclusion of a bit of text prior to the opening credits, something apparently missing on previous VHS and Laserdisc releases.  As far as the mono audio, it comes across well.  There's not much in the way of extras except for subtitles in English, French, Spanish, and Japanese, along with a couple of trailers for the films Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992) and The Revenge of Frankenstein (1958).  The release seems a bit pricey for so seemingly little, but if you're a fan of Lugosi or old timey monsters, then you probably won't mind coughing up the dough to add this to your collection.

But make no mistake, Lugosi is playing dracula, complete with cape and menacing eyes.  In 1918 Tesla and his werewolf servant named Andreas were preying upon the family of Lady Jane Ainsely until Tesla had a stake driven into his heart and he was buried in a cemetery.  Fast forward to worn torn England in the 1940's.  A stray German bomb slams into the cemetery and unearths Tesla's grave.  A couple of dimwitted civil defense men find the body and remove the stake.  Tesla returns to life and tracks down his werewolf servant.

Andreas has now been working for lady Jane and she's been able to cure him from turning into a werewolf.  Look, don't question it...this film plays very loose with werewolf and vampire lore.

Return of the Vampire is an exceptional movie for Lugosi.  he gets to do even more than he did in Dracula.  The film is beautifully shot with misty, shadowy cemeteries and crypts that rival Universal's classics of the 1930's.

Like the Universal horror films lensed at around the same time, ""Return of the Vampire"" was probably targeted to a younger matinee crowd than the original ""Frankenstein"" and ""Dracula"" films. At heart, and in budget, this is a B-movie complete with occassional lapses in logic and continuity. These have been mentioned by other reviewers, and will be weighed more heavily by nonfans of the genre.

This film easily holds its own with contemporary Universal films, mainly because of Bela Lugosi's excellent performance. At no time in this film does Lugosi behave as a campy, hammy actor. Rather, he seems to seize on this role as a chance to revisit his famed Dracula performance and improve upon it. Partly due to the screenplay and partly due to his own interest, Lugosi invested a tremendous amount of care into portraying the vampire Tesla. It shows in every closeup, and in every line of dialogue Lugosi delivers.

Forget about the shoestring films Lugosi ended his career with. If you want to appreciate his legacy, films like ""Return of the Vampire"" and ""The Black Cat"" provide a far more respectful tribute to one of the best pre-WWII horror icons.",1098921600,17,1440,4.921810699588478
613140,4,6303257380,"""Return of the Vampire"" (1943) is an underrated, atmospheric chiller that surpasses the missed opportunities of ""Dracula."" Unlike Tod Browning, director Lew Landers gives Bela Lugosi a terrific showcase as vampire Armand Tesla. The World War II setting works quite well and the script is surprisingly intelligent. There are moments in ""Return of the Vampire"" that evoke a Val Lewton quality in terms of mood and character development. Lugosi, in particular, effectively underplays his role  complemented by a fine cast. Columbia Pictures made relatively few horror films during the 1930s and '40s, yet ""Return of the Vampire"" remains the studio's finest contribution to the genre.",1095724800,8,680,5.476190476190476
7842217,5,6303257380,"""The Return of the Vampire"" with its bravura performance by Bela Lugosi, deserves to be considered a classic. While the monster movies put out by Universal Pictures are considered to be the apex of the genre in the 1930s and '40s, this gem from Columbia Pictures is just as good as, say, ""The Wolf Man"" with Lon Chaney, Jr. and Lugosi sharing the title role. Stepping up from the poverty row pictures he'd been making for far too long, Lugosi does a fine job of acting as Armand Tesla, a vampire out for revenge. He would don the cape one last time for ""Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein."" Director Lew Landers, who helmed Universal's ""The Raven,"" with Lugosi and Boris Karloff, keeps things moving right along, as Tesla and his ""familiar."" a werewolff named Andreas, hurtle towards a final confrontation with a female vampire hunter. All too often movie buffs forget how good Lugosi was in ""Son of Frankenstein"" (as Ygor) and ""The Black Cat,"" as well as ""White Zombie,"" ""Night Monster"" and ""Death Kiss,"" among others. Yes, his films for poverty row company Monogram Pictures and the talentless Ed Wood do nothing for his reputation as a film actor, but movies like ""Return of the Vampire"" show good he could be when given decent material and direction.

This story is set in 1918 at an asylum on the outskirts of London. It is night again. Andreas the werewolf tells what happened during the day. A vampires (shrouded to hide his face) awakens and prowls outside. Professor Saunders analyzes a blood sample. Two children play at war. A female patient has a nightmare. Fog enters her open window, then a cloaked man appears! Later the Professor notices two pinpricks on the woman's throat. Dogs barked last night as if wolves were near. Nikki needs a blood transfusion. They must search for the vampire's resting place by day to find and kill it. They defend themselves against a werewolf! They plan to dig up Armand Tesla's grave to check its contents. There are scenes of an enemy bombing attack, people seek shelter.

Two grave diggers provide comic relief. They find an open grave with a wooden shaft in the body, and remove it. What was that noise? A telephone call tells of an escaped prisoner from Nazi Germany who will soon arrive. We see a hand reaching from a grave. Andreas is called by a man in the night. ""Come here."" Andreas suddenly develops hyper-hirsuteness! Andreas must find a new resting place for a coffin. Later Andreas obtained new identification papers and clothes for his Master. Doctor Bruckner appears at a party. [Note the lesser accent since 1931.] ""If you control the mind you control the body"". Bruckner must not be disturbed as he sleeps during the day. He calls Nikki to him, she rises from her bed. Armand Tesla can never die. He will take Nikki back to his native country. She faints (low blood pressure?). Can they do something? The two grave diggers tell what happened earlier. They show where the body was reburied. Where did that ring come from?

The statement of the maid is disbelieved. ""Galloping ghosts""? They search for Andreas, who then develops a hairy face and enormous strength. These two detectives are not believed. The laboratory analyzed their samples as wolf hair! Nikki doesn't want the blackout curtains drawn for the night. [Remember them?] Andreas opens the window to neutralize Elsa the maid. Nikki rises from her bed. A pet dog barks a warning. Nikki stares at John's throat. Lady Ainsley gets a telephone call and finds John on the floor. Why are there two pinpricks on his throat? Where is the manuscript of Armand Tesla? Andreas admits taking it and runs away. Who is impersonating Hugo Buckner? That ring belongs to long gone Armand Tesla! Can a cross protect the ill?

Armand will take Nikki away tonight, never to be seen again. But Lady Jane uses a cross to drive Armand away. Sir Frederick sees Nikki descending the stairs, they must follow her to find Armand. Nikki walks to a cemetery. Airplanes drop bombs. Where is Nikki? Andreas' usefulness has ended. [No retirement plan?] Andreas finds a crucifix on the ground, it helps him to overcome evil. A bomb explodes to let in sunlight. Andreas drags Armand outside. ""Sunlight is the best disinfectant."" Andreas hits a wooden stake with a brick. Lady Jane finds Nikki alive. Poor Andreas has found peace. ""Do you believe in vampires?"" asks the Inspector of Police.

This is a pretty good story for a low-budget movie during wartime England. It follows the Hollywood legends of the 1930s. They don't explain why a cross avoiding vampire should inhabit a cemetery that is filled with crosses. Many of the legends about vampires and werewolves were invented by a Hollywood movie writer, such as the use of garlic to keep vampires away.",1478131200,,3531,4.791461412151067
