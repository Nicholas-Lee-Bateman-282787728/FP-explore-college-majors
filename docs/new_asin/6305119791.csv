That said,  ""Dinosaurs Dinosaurs Dinosaurs"" is a very enjoyable piece of 1980's children's programming.",1315008000,,298,6.2439024390243905
8159510,3,6305119791,"The first is a dull movie about an encounter with dinosaurs on Earth but the second one is rather interesting: Astronauts (or better: Cosmonauts, because the director uses a lot of space footage from a russian SF movie)  lands on a planet to encounter among other things - you guessed it -  Dinosaurs. Enjoyable. (And if only for the footages) But NOTE: they are  recorded in the EP mode!",961545600,2,388,4.594202898550725
