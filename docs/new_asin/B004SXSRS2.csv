Rating = ***
Director:  Kenji Mizoguchi
Streaming
1946

(Editorial Note:  Criterion folks, here is another fine film that ""cries out"" for digital restoration.  Commercially releasing it [on HULU] in this condition is inexcusable!)  Film = three (3) stars; subtitles = 3.5 stars; music = two (2) stars; ""restoration"" = one (1) star.  This time out, Director Kenji Mizoguchi's melodramatic model (with roots in kabuki and shinpa theater) focuses on an Edo period  school of art whose leader/master specializes in painting the female face and form on paper and on female forms!  (The former gain greater permanence via a nearby block-printing factory; the latter when replaced by tattoos.)  Utamaro is a ""people artist"" (as contrasted with commercial painters of landscapes, birds, flowers, etc.) who seems to have plenty of apprentices and models, since the art colony is located inside a major brothel (or two).  The master runs afoul of authorities when he tries to paint women who are not members of brothel sororities; he ends up being sidelined for six months and forced to wear a contemporary version of handcuffs (which, of course, prevents painting).  In a refreshing reversal of gender domination, Mizoguchi's photo play shows women in control of things, since the male painters would be deprived of models without the cooperation of their subjects.  The Director also draws out a sub-theme that shows the attraction that some ""strong"" women have to weak/""useless"" men (linked in part to a ""mothering instinct""?).  The photo showing a beautiful woman's bare back being painted with an erotic picture of a beautiful woman is probably better known than the film itself!  This famous scene occurs early in the film; iterations do not appear in the rest of the movie (a missed opportunity to further distinguish the film and appeal to a broader audience?). Cinematography/lighting  (narrow screen, gray & white) are hard to judge (especially lighting) although Mizoguchi's favorite shooting technique of mounting a ""floating"" camera on a crane is much in evidence.  Scenes are mostly shot long (full figure style) or medium (bust style).  Because of the absence of restoration, facial expressions of actresses and actors can not be determined (even in rare close-ups), hence depriving the viewer of seeing complete performances.  Subtitles are fine.  Music consists of occasional and random snatches of instrumental performances and noh singing/chanting.  Recommended.  WILLIAM FLANIGAN, PhD.",1477699200,,2623,5.359413202933985

This film is currently showing for two weeks at the Film Society of Lincoln Center.  The theatrical premiere in New York in 2015-16.  Better yet, in a ""new digital restoration.""  Which means that it is likely this Mizoguchi highlight will be eventually released to us ""hoy poly"" in the digital restoration!  Which it has needed.",1451520000,,432,4.783783783783784
