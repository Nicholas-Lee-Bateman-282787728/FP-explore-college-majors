4581238,5,B0055UA1KO,"Previously, on my review of Beast Wars Season 1: Put away the 80's synthesizer and pull out the 90's generic rock guitar! Created by the same company that created Reboot, this classic Computer Generated series is the follow up to the original Generation One Transformers. Beast Wars in America, Beasties in Canada (Canada has a rule that no show aimed at children can have war in the title, go figure). An enjoyable series that had previously been released in bare bones sets by Rhino (which I own and are now discontinued), it has now been rereleased by Shout! with new extras! Beast Wars has finally gotten a more deserving release!

1st Season:

Beast Wars (1)
Beast Wars (2)
The Web
Equal Measures
Chain of Command
Power Surge
Fallen Comrades
Double Jeopardy
A Better Mousetrap
Gorilla Warfare
The Probe
Victory
Dark Designs
Double Dinobot
The Spark
The Trigger (1)
The Trigger (2)
Spider's Game
Call of the Wild
Dark Voyage
Possession
The Low Road
Law of the Jungle
Before the Storm
Other Voices (1)
Other Voices (2)

The first season is more generic and simplistic as far as most of the stories go but it sets things up nicely and builds to a wonderful climax by season's end. The second half of the season really started to become inspired and storylines had more continuing arcs and characters were becoming much more developed and defined.

2nd Season:

Aftermath
Coming of the Fuzors (1)
Coming of the Fuzors (2)
Tangled Web
Maximal, No More
Other Visits (1)
Other Visits (2)
Bad Spark
Code of Hero
Transmutate
The Agenda (1)
The Agenda (2)
The Agenda (3)

This season completely transformed the series into something much more serialized and much more mature. They cram a lot into this thirteen episode season and once the first three episodes set things up nicely the rest of the season tries out some very mature storytelling and quickly delves into huge plot advancements for the series. The three part ending, The Agenda, is fantastic and took the series right back to its G1 roots in a way so well planned and so perfect. Let's also not forget the fan favorite, Code of Hero, one of the series best.

3rd Season:

Optimal Situation
Deep Metal
Changing of the Guard
Cutting Edge
Feral Scream
Feral Scream (2)
Proving Grounds
Go with the Flow
Crossing the Rubicon
Master Blaster
Other Victories (aka Closure)
Nemesis
Nemesis (2)

If you thought the second season brought new maturity and depth by transforming the series then the third season must have gone Transmetal 2. Each episode has either an inspired premise or great plot/character development if not a combination of both. Other Victories may be on of the most successful attempts to quickly tie up loose plot threads for a series that I have ever seen and the series finale went out on the high note that this series deserved.

For a show that was honestly just one huge commercial for Hasbro toys this is quite a show. It is so well designed that the addition of new characters feels natural and adds excitement to the show rather than feeling forced and contrived. The status pod crashes actually make for some of the most interesting episodes because the new character can be programmed to fight for either side. The second season concept of updating certain characters with the surge and the notion of Fuzors may also be new marketing ploys but they feel so organic to the story of the series because of the way they were handled. The final season and the concept of Transmetal 2's was also quite well executed. Just a marvelous series all the way around.

Thanks to Shout! for putting in effort when they get the rights to a series and here's hoping they obtain the rights to many more (I'm still hoping Gargoyles will get a complete series set after Disney dropped the ball those many years ago).

**Many already own this set through Shout!'s website, I'm actually waiting on the November retail release as it coincides with my birthday so I will further review content of the actual set then. However, as an owner of the Reboot set I can say if it is similar (the only downside being some audio pops and some questionable picture quality) then I will be extremely happy with my purchase.",1316390400,65,4168,4.718019257221458
4581239,5,B0055UA1KO,"Like the previous reviewer, I got this off pre-order from the shout factory website.  Although I haven't had a chance to catch up with the series, I have a pretty good idea of what had happened, seeing bits and pieces of the show when it was on the air of course.  I collected the toys back then, when I was a good deal younger than I am now.  If you are a trans-fan and want to catch up on what had happened and didn't get the chance to order the original sets, then go for it.  Bonus material doesn't really matter that much to me, I am satisfied with what I got plus there are a lot of episodes that I never did see cause either I had lost interest or completely forgot about it since I was still in school (middle approaching high school) back then if I remember right.  So this set is the perfect chance for trans-fans in particular beast wars fans for you to catch up with what happened.",1308700800,3,893,4.138728323699422
4581240,5,B0055UA1KO,"Bought this as a pre-order off the shout factory website...and other than a lack in special features somewhat, and no option to play multi part episodes seamlessly, I've got to say, this is well worth the price i payed for it, and i recommend it to anybody that didn't get a chance to buy the dvd's when they were availble originally, and if anyone wants to know where to get em just go to the shout factory website (though it's a tad pricy but not a problem)",1308441600,5,459,4.287356321839081

4581255,5,B0055UA1KO,"I loved it.  Just watching the series again felt like the good old days as a kid.  My favorite character from the will always be Dinobot.  He was such a well developed character that I almost cried when he died.  My other favorites would have to be Rattrap and Waspinator.  Rattrap has clever skills even though he'd rather sit battles out.  Waspinator is the most slapstick comedic villain in the series. He's clumsy, a little stupid, and always getting himself shot by either the Maximals or his own side.  I also love how this show connects to the G1 series.  Seeing G1 Megatron in CG form was really cool.  I highly recommend this show to any Transformers fan out there.",1505865600,,674,4.55

It comes with all the episodes in a nice presentation with a prequel comic and special features on the DVDs. I haven't noticed any sound or picture quality issues and the show is just as excellent as I remember it being.

4581283,4,B0055UA1KO,"Beast Wars is possibly the most cherished relic of my childhood. Even Before Power Rangers and Ninja Turtles. As a 90s kid it was a big part of my life growing up and now that I am an adult and own the entire series on dvd I can give my honest assessment of it. If you are a Transfan and are going into this expecting G1, don't! This series was written by writers who wanted to write a hard scifi action series that kids of the 90s and the grown G1 fans could both enjoy. It has much more mature,logical storylines and characterization, making it a different animal from its G1 ancestor. *Puns intended!* ;)

First, the animation:
This is easily the part that did not age well. The movements are very rigid and jerky, the backgrounds are bland and solids are blocky, no shadows, and things like fur look more like surfaces with fur drawn on them. This was before hair was mastered in CG years later with characters like Donkey in Shrek. In other Voices Parts 1 - 2, it looks like images of actual fire were used in the CG, looking very out of place and jarring: once when Inferno roasts Tarantulas, and second when Optimus destroys the Planet Buster. The best part of the animation are the character designs themselves, especially the robot modes. Metal looks like metal with reflective surfacing and robotic sound effects to drive home the feel of realistic robots on the screen with very sharp and angular designs that look as cool now as they did twenty years ago. In one of the behind the scenes featurettes with this dvd set the Hasbro execs revealed that most of the budget was blown on the character designs, which makes perfect sense since this was basically a half hour toy commercial! ;)

Second: The Characters
The strongest part of the series, Bob Forward and Larry Ditillo did an excellent job writing them. They were very mature with distinct personalities with conflict among themselves as well with their respective enemy factions. There were characters that were egotistical jerks that seemed to care only for themselves, such as Megatron and, to a degree, Rattrap. And then there were the good guy characters that made you want to be like when you grew up like the fatherly but stern Optimus Primal  and the brutal but honorable Dinobot. Their personalities also changed as well as their relationships, like Megatron becoming more of a megalomaniac and Dinobot and Rattrap developing a kind of unspoken respect while Cheetor grew form impetuous and reckless youth to a mature and level headed soldier. And when many died you were genuinely sad like Dinobot and Depth Charge because they were written so realistic and likeable, you became attached to them. Even the villains deaths would make the viewer feel depressed like Tarantulas or Inferno.

Third: Storylines
This was kind of mixed. It srarted fairly well-written but nothing memorable and later become much better as time went on. Bob Frward described the writing style as ""Swashbuckling"" in a behind the scenes featurette. The story was not planned but instead written on the fly with elements that could be developed into larger story arcs, such as Optimus Primal mentioning a ""Great War"" written in that could be used to refer to the events of G1 if the writers decided to take that direction. Or the marooned planet later being written as prehistoric earth and the standing stones and second moon being the result of aliens called the ""Vok"". The first few episodes, while fun, are very unremarkable with no overall direction at all, and then when we learn of the Vok and Megatron's true agenda, it now develops a purpose taking much darker tones and a hard scifi story that leave it feeling nothing short of an epic sequel. In season 3 it begins to suffer when the execs at Hasrbo became more concerned with selling toys and the themes of the series being too dark for a kid's show and tried to take more control from the wirters. Certain elements like Optimal situation, the Dragon Ball Z rip-off Tigerhawk, and Megatron becoming a dragon, which offsets the hard scifi theme with a fantasy theme, get very jarring and come off as badly planed. The writers are still able to do a good enough job that you still want to see the end of the story.
While it does feel like we are cheated out of the climax we were promised, ending in a whimper rather than the bang, and many elements becoming overly kid friendly and silly, it still maintains an epic enough feel to leave you on the edge of your seat giving a climax to the series as a whole in Nemsis Part 1 -2. All in all, the writers could have done better, especially with season 3, but they still did impressive and clever enough writing with the ""swashbuckling"" elements and how they developed them into an overarching plot. The conclusion leaves you satisfied with the end to a long journey.

This series is enjoyable and for people of all ages. But if you are not a scifi fan or are expecting a G1-2 you will be disappointed. The plots can get convoluted but the charcaters and the later firm storyline direction save it and make it the most memorable installment in the Transformers. frnachise. It is a hard scfi series with good writing, great characters, and plenty of episodes to leave you feeling caught up in an epic battle between Maximals and Predacons. It may not be a masterpiece by any means but it is a lot of fun and it saved the Transformers brand from extinction during the 90s and transformed the franchise forever. *Pun intended again!* ;)",1469059200,,5489,4.660474716202271

4581319,4,B0055UA1KO,"The Beast Wars cartoon did something that I always knew would happen ever since the US cartoon stopped in 1987. Transformers toys were GREAT toys.... BUT were often sold through the great cartoons that made the kids LOVE the characters and want to buy them. The toy line never recovered from the cartoon's cancellation in '87 (it continued in Japan and parts of Europe, but in the US, it went away for a few years).

And the Beast Wars toys were simply... ew. Where's my cars and planes and guns that transform into robots? Why are they earh animals? Duh! THEY RUINED TRANSFORMERS FOREVER!

But then, as predicted, they made a good cartoon with a good story and the toys AND the line were reborn. While the stories weren't as appealing to me as Generation One (I grew up on those), they were still good, and the tie-ins TO the G1 cartoons and comics just made it all the better. But older fans (and more important, newer KIDS!) wanted to buy the toys again! GASP!

Now with the handful of live-action movies, toy lines, cartoons and comics out there - not to mention my favorite, the Masterpiece Transformers toy line -  we can somewhat look back and not remember much of a time when TFs weren't around (other than when the original kids of G1 went to high school and college). But one can also look back to this and think... the Transformers never looked dumber than Beast Wars... BUT... the whole thing was saved by the cartoon. And they should've NEVER stopped it in 1987.",1439942400,,1475,4.533834586466165

4581324,5,B0055UA1KO,"Having grown up with the original Transformers Generation One series, Beast Wars had me feeling like a 10 year old kid all over again.  It was only one of two times in my adult life I've ever felt that way watching a cartoon (the other being Transformers Prime).  It was groundbreaking in its day and the story and characters were not only well written, but also well portrayed by the voice actors.  The animation carries subtlety of expression and gesture in the characters that for only being the second full length CGI show ever produced (Reboot being the first) sets it well apart from other cartoons at the time and it still holds its own along side most current animated shows today.

And before someone decides to correct me on the fact that there was a French CGI show before Reboot and Beast Wars, do note that the French show was CGI animated SHORTS, not a full length show; though the shorts were edited together to create 22 minute episodes to air in other countries in much the same way that Tiny Planets was edited together.

The behind-the-scenes special features are fun to watch, especially getting to see how the animation is done and seeing the voice actors as they record their dialogue for the episodes ""Law of the Jungle"" and ""Double Jeopardy"".",1433376000,5,1266,4.6591928251121075

What I remember from my childhood it was a great show next to the G1 series, it even had episodes of having G1 characters. I bought this mainly for 2 reasons first is a birthday gift to myself & 30th anniversary transformers line, they remade RHINOX, RATTRAP & WASPINATOR which where all made more show accurate than the original. When it finally gets here it will be so nice to have this series going alone with my G1 series set and to have something that i loved as a 5 year old kid this show & G1 series will always be my FAVORITE shows. I'm so GLAD I got this, after watching the whole series I remember watching almost all of season 1 during my childhood and certain episodes from seasons 2 & 3, like the final episode of season 2 when megatron finds the Ark & badly damaging Optimus Prime's head intent on destoying the Maximals, and the first episode of season 3 Optimus Primal taking the spark of Optimus Prime & turning into Optimal Optimus these two episodes really stand out to me. There are other episodes, I remember from my childhood but these 2 episodes where my favorite as a kid. It was a GREAT SERIES to watch & to relive my childhood. It makes me want to find the rest of my original Beast Wars action figures that I didn't keep with my Optimus Primal transmetal, Optimal Optimus, Cheetor transmetal, & Rattrap transmetal. I have the 30th Anniversary of Rhinox, Rattrap, & Waspinator to go along with original Beast Wars action figures.",1414800000,2,1525,4.430604982206406

4581351,5,B0055UA1KO,"Beast Wars!

I live in the UK and for some reason this series never got a full release. Yes we had one or two episodes here and there, but no actual full season 1, 2 or 3 release. We did get Beast Machines thought...

People have said that the visuals are not great, but it was released in 1996 when CGI was not at it's best, so it is horribly unfair to compare it to programs such as Transformers Prime or anything like that.

Watching it brings back memories of mine that got me interested in Transformers properly. A small group of Maximals (decedents of the Autobots) are chasing after a small group of Predacons (the descendants of, you guessed it - the Decepticons) and go through a transwarp (think I have spelt that right) portal that travels through time and space and crash land on a deserted planet. As the transformers have downsized now (conserving energon - obvious!) they are more suited to the sixe of animals now. The fact that the planet has a huge amount of energon on it, so much so that over exposure will casue them to shut down they must take on the forms of beasts in a semi organic coating to keep the excess energon away. And so begins the Beast Wars!

You get a free comic book with it, a prequel to the TV series and special features. I would hugely recommend this, I have not finished watching the DVD yet, but am enjoying every nostalgic infused minute of this TV show.",1408320000,,1399,4.369230769230769

So what if the animation is dated and bad compared to modern Transformer series (like Prime)? It may be an old show, but it more than makes up for it in other ways. It stars amazing, fleshed-out characters, has talented voice actors, awesome soundtrack and a story that may start off slow, but soon escalates into something great and deep.
Plus, if you are one of those G1 fans, then you may like that little bits of continuity they hide in here.

I admit I had originally been rebuked by the designs and the animation (the 90s CG that wasn't quite mastered at the time, remember?), but decided to try it after countless of good reviews and just deep affection for it.
I was hooked in the first ten minutes.
The characters' personalities are beautifully crafted, the storyline is one of those that makes kids understand that they are not taken for granted and adults appreciate a good show, the cast is truly wondeful (chosen by none other than Susan Blu, the original voice of Arcee in G1) and revealed some of the most loved voice actors out there (David Kaye and Scott McNeil as a prime example).
And the animation WORKS, it may be a bit stiff at the beginning but it gets better really quickly and by the end of the series you got a great example of a 90s CG series that rocked!

4581387,5,B0055UA1KO,i have already watched the dvd set almost 25 times already. its also cool that they have some of the generation 1 characters in the show. i love it!,1359331200,,148,4.137931034482759
4581388,5,B0055UA1KO,Yes the graphics are not good by todays standards but the story is great. I remember loving this series as a kid so the nostalgic feeling was what I was after and this boxed set delivered,1358985600,,187,4.222222222222222
4581389,2,B0055UA1KO,"I own the original RHINO DVD release of this series (season 1 anyway) and after watching some of it recently with my son I noticed how poor the quality of the video was, like VHS copy of a copy quality. I assumed it was due to it being a rather old DVD and since my son and I were having a good time with it I decided to pick up this newer version so we could watch the entire series.
 I watched some of it tonight and was really disappointed to find that the video quality is only a tiny bit better. It is still VHS quality at best and just repackaged with a newer menu interface.

By today's standards the animation looks really dated, but I'm fine with that, it is what it is. I am a fan of the series, it's still as good as it ever was as far as story, characters and such, but until this gets remastered onto Blu-ray, I would not recommend buying it.
 If it weren't for my sons interest in finishing the series, I would send this back.",1358812800,3,940,4.043010752688172
4581390,5,B0055UA1KO,"my son and his father both share the love of anything transformer. so when i seen this, with such a great price as well!! I just simply had to get it. The look on sons face when he opened it christmas morning was well worth it.. priceless even. Thank You!!!",1356912000,2,257,4.16
4581391,4,B0055UA1KO,Remember watching this as a kid years ago and had to have it.  Series gets off to a slow start and the CGI in the first year while it may have been awesome back then really lacks compared to today.  The story line is very choppy to start but the second and third season really makes up for it.  Brought back some memories and loved watching the series again.,1355875200,,358,4.159420289855072
4581392,5,B0055UA1KO,"I've reminisced about this show for years with my friends, and we'd talked about locating the complete series for about as long. I purchased this as a birthday gift, and it was very well received! Aside from the pleasure of re-watching the entire series, that are ample bonus features that we found immensely entertaining as well as interestingly informative. Great buy!",1351555200,2,370,5.081967213114754
4581393,5,B0055UA1KO,"This was a fantastic tv series, one which blended CGI, good story telling, and characters that you actually cared about. As a child, this was one of my absolute favorite Saturday morning cartoons.
My friends and I all collected the toys, and played many hours re-creating the scenes from the show. In fact, several months ago, we pulled out all our old Beast Wars toys to reminisce.
This box set is solid, and the discs are great. What a fun way to re-live a part of childhood.
I would definitely recommend for children today. Even with the old CGI, it won't seem outdated, and the story telling is much better than the current crap out there for kids today.",1349395200,7,658,4.53781512605042
4581394,5,B0055UA1KO,Totally worth every penny for any fan of transformers.  Gives more depth to the story and is a really fun show all around.,1347148800,,122,4.304347826086956
4581395,5,B0055UA1KO,"Transformer: Beast Wars is a sequel of the original G1 series. Beast Wars helped pave the road to today's CG skills and abilities, that today have been used in the new Transformers movies along with many other fan favorites.

Beast Wars is taking place millions of years after the end of G1. Optimus Primal and his Maximals are decedents of the Autobots, who govern over the decedents of the Decepticons known as Predicons. However, Primal and his team are shot down on an unknown planet by a rouge Predicon who is named after Megatron. Stranded together, megaton wages War on Optimus Primal and so the Beast Wars begin.

This series is full of jaw droppers, particularly in the last 2 seasons. The character development and story plots are more in depth than G1 because it focus's on less characters. Anyone who loves G1 or the movies, will love Beast Wars!!!!",1345248000,,861,4.733333333333333
4581396,4,B0055UA1KO,"If you are a fan of Beast Wars or Transformers then this is a pretty nice set to own.  The show is definitely oriented to kids like most of the Transformers shows, but it can still be enjoyable for the parents too.  The CGI was ground breaking, but looks plain by today's standard.  This box set is an excellent value at under $30 for 3 seasons of the show.",1340928000,,357,4.144927536231884

if you have not seen this show or this before then i recommend you do",1339718400,4,1486,4.117647058823529
4581398,5,B0055UA1KO,"If you're wanting a more visual review concerning how this series looks, I advise you to skip this review since I'm totally blind and can't help ya there. And as for a disk by disk breakdown, I'm sure that's already been done by some devoted Transfan.  But here's what I think of this set.

  When I was a kid and this series premiered, I wasn't sure what to think about it.  My little brother introduced me to it one summer when I was visiting him in Memphis.  G1 was the series I cut my teeth on via old video rentals from Blockbuster and Scifi reruns since I was a kid of the early to mid 90s.  But the more I watched Beast Wars, the more I enjoyed it.

  And I really enjoyed Shout's presentation of this epic in one complete boxset.  The retrospective featurettes are a treat.  And it's nice to see the whole series from beginning to end.  All the episodes are in chronological order, so you won't have to worry about flip-flopping disks.  The sound quality is what I would expect from Shout.  It's very crisp and clear.  I love the stories these writers have penned down, especially those told in the second and third seasons.  Although the first also has memorable episodes.

  This was a darker and more mature cartoon than others produced during the mid 90s.  I can't remember seeing any other show portraying character deaths.  And character development was something few writers chose to tackle.  This one's got it all.  I only wish there would have been more stories to tell after this series and Beast Machines.  And yes, I liked that one as well.  But that's a review for another day.  Maybe Shout will get around to acquiring the rights to Gargoyles some day.  Keep em coming, Shout.  Keep em coming.",1337040000,2,1715,4.495114006514658
4581399,5,B0055UA1KO,"You had to have seen this show. It's great. Brings me right back to my childhood (third grade more specifically). Animations are out-of-date, obviously, but what's not to love about nostalgia? Great show for kids and those of us that grew up in the great cartoon explosion of the mid to late nineties.",1334275200,,301,4.69811320754717
4581400,5,B0055UA1KO,"Rhino put out a solid DVD collection of this great series some years back.  ShoutFactory! puts out nice DVD boxsets (nice art, nice packaging, nice bonus features, etc.) and looks to be carrying the mantle that Rhino used to carry given the depth and breadth of their offerings.  I love this show so much I bought this 2nd issue to have as backup and available for lending to any family or friends who I can convince to give it a try.  This isn't just a great kid's cartoon but a flat out great out sci-fi series.  Turns out Larry DiTillio and Bob Forward had worked together on SheRa: The Princess of Power and Larry did a bit of work on Babylon5.  Larry also wrote some of the more amazing episodes of the overall amazing 1984 Filmation HeMan and the Masters of the Universe cartoon series.  Simon Furman- a revered writer of transformers stories for the UK comics- was even brought in to pen a great episode.  Top writing.  The voice acting is as amazing as it can get in any cartoon (thank you Gary Chalk and David Kaye).  There were staff with some real bona fides behind this show and the show delivers from beginning to end with a great story arc that really entertains.  When G1 transformers get referenced (Starscream, Ravage, Autobot Ark, the flagship of the Decepticon armada ""The Nemesis"") you get the goose bumps and chills of awesomeness flowing through you.  I get the chills just thinking about Ravage's great lines in those amazing episodes aboard the Nemesis and you will too!  You too will be speaking in Waspinator speak or para-phrasing dino Megatron's ""Egggggsellent!"" every chance you get too after taking in this beautiful show.  I look forward to watching it again (and again) with my boys.",1331164800,8,1715,4.657807308970099

4581402,5,B0055UA1KO,Great dvd set! Everything came intact and no loose discs floating around the box.  They had a good 15min or so video of bonus video discussing creations of BW and why the background was so generic.  I just finished converting all the discs over to droid format on my pc so i can watch it on my down time and such on my tablet.,1329609600,,326,4.078125

4581406,5,B0055UA1KO,"This is the best transformers series there is. Unlike the others, this one keeps the main plot and main characters while adding acceptable additions.

4581408,4,B0055UA1KO,When the series started syndication re-runs back in the late 90's I was in between careers and had the pleasure of watching over my 4 year and 1 year old sons during the day while working nights for 2 years.  One of the biggest highlights during this time was watching the Beast Wars show in sequence with my sons.  The story lines were great and most of the characters were given a chance to develop and I can honestly say there were some touching moments as well as funny back and forth between the good and bad forces.  We still have a laugh reminiscing Waspinator's constant bad place bad time situations.  Now that the boys are in their teens they have been watching the series with a renewed interest.  It was a no brainer adding this package to our video collection.  I am looking forward to sitting with my boys and returning to the world of Beast Wars.,1325894400,,861,4.417721518987341
4581409,5,B0055UA1KO,"Beast Wars is a hit for our three young sons for Christmas. I remembered some of the series, but I had forgotten how little those making the show had only a fair controll of the computer animated graphics. This was not too disappointing since the story line and character acting more than made up for what was lacking visually. The episodes from the first to the last fit together seamlessly unlike that of the original Star Trek. The bad guys were the bad guys. And while there is an extreme ammount of depth to the characters with today's storlines I don't have to answer to my young sons about what the heck that robot is doing.

The package from Beast Wars arrived undammaged and on time before Christmas 2011.",1325548800,2,714,4.534883720930233

The videos are pretty much as high a quality as you could ask for from a show from the late 90's.  The packaging for the discs is the best I've seen in season DVDs. The special features aren't particularly robust, and there aren't any commentary tracks, but if you want to watch Beast Wars this is the way to go.",1324944000,,459,4.123595505617978
