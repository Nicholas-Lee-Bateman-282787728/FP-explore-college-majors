8763859,5,B01GWBYFX8,"A treasure has been passed from had to hand and growing for centuries. The freemasons, last to hold the treasure hid a treasure presumably in the U.S. They did not want the British to get their hands on it during the revolution. The last person with the information on the hiding place is dying and tells the only person near. Now his great grandson Ben Gates (Nicolas Cage) is determined to find it.

In the effort to find the treasure Ben must team with an unscrupulous person Ian (Sean Bean). Now they are at odds as to how to go about flinging a string of clues. We get to guess along with them and if we are knowledgeable we can stay ahead of them.

Formula story with standard action mixing such things as The Da Vinci Code and Indiana Jones. If I were to make one change it would be to exchange Cages and Beans characters. Sean Bean looks more the from no one to hero type.

Blu-ray can only enhance the visual experience. Be sure to have National Treasure 2 standing by.",1531008000,,978,4.333333333333333
