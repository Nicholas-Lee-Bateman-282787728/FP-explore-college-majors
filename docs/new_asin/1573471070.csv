195084,1,1573471070,"""Blood Dolls"" is a confounding freakfest about which little of worth can be said... It begins with a quite literal indictment of corporate ethics as a pair of unscrupulous complicitors in an unethical business enterprise enter the world of a business ""genius"" who wears a long-discarded X-Files prop (literally copied from the episode ""Grotesque"") as a mask, has a morose clown for a butler, and keeps a dwarf around for no apparent reason other than to keep the general sideshow aura amped to an extreme level. This dwarf routinely tortures his encaged, all-female rock band, who, beside being surprisingly technically adept, do little more than provide nudity. Shortly into the proceedings, the cornball bloodletting starts, the billionaire reveals the disproportionately small head beneath the mask, and one of the complicitous nobodies is transformed into a ""blood doll."" These must be parodies of ""Puppet Master,"" but since that film might as well have been a parody itself, that isn't saying much. The film exudes an air of sadism amid the camp, and occassionally meanders into utterly senseless philosophical musings culled pretty much directly from the sources they cite. The acting is awful; the characters and story, absurd. However, it's also pretty damn funny, in an Ed Wood-let's take this seriously even as it becomes increasingly absurd to-kind of way. Worth a rent for a camp conoisseur, but little else.",1138838400,,1420,5.232456140350878
195085,4,1573471070,"This one went surprisingly deep on the philosophical banter between the protagonist and antagonist. But it was no mere head-to-head talkie. The music was astonishingly good, the suspenseful action lent a continuing air of suspension and tension that gave you the creeps, and the script was a twist if Nietzsche meets the Twilight Zone. The babes were hot and sassy and the relationships complicated like the taste a well aged wine. If you don't like this movie, you probably don't like to have fun with horror and should seek your thrills in more somber chillers. The clown!  William Burns brought levels of sophistication to his role. His character was a spiritual man, you see. The story's message might offend the devoutly religious. Too bad. Hidden talent showed up in this yarn. The girl band coulda been a contender. The lead actress in the movie leaves you begging for more. Literally.",1091232000,,892,4.946666666666666

195087,3,1573471070,I'm almost ashamed to admit this but I loved this movie. The first time I saw it I thought it was a parody but by the third or fourth time it simply grew on me. Virgil is a billionaire with an anatomical problem and a totally out of control sense of humor. His henchman Mr. Mascaro is a clown who has no intention of making you laugh. Virgil has a live band held captive in the living room and has living dolls who kill people. Sounds ridiculous right? Well it is but Blood Dolls never pretends to be anything more than the B flick it is.,1049846400,5,538,4.084905660377358
195088,5,1573471070,"I avoided this movie for quite some time, wondering if it would have anything at all to offer. Just looking at the packaging and promotion made it seem as if this movie might be nothing more than a Puppet Master spoof, and that worried me a little. Still, it was a Full Moon production and I wasn't semi-certain that Full Moon wouldn't do that to one of their more successful franchises, so I cast my fear aside and bought it. Happily, I have to say that I made the right choice in the matter.
Blood Dolls was indeed a spoof of Puppet Master, but only to a point. It also went even further than that, going out of its way to help even the most reserved viewer have at least a little laugh. The story focuses around Virgil, an eccentric billionaire, who wears a mask to conceal the fact that he has a really odd secret. Still, this does little to conceal how truly twisted his sense of humor is, and how much he delights in power and acquisition. Added to this is an entertaining support cast, from his girls-in-a-cage band that he forces to play at will, to his biological inventions, the blood dolls.
It isn't something that should be taken too seriously, and is positively entertaining.

195094,3,1573471070,"Caged singers who can't sing yet sing too much, a crabby guy sporting clown makeup and no sense of humor, a surly dwarf/butler, and a wealthy villain who needs a head-mask for obvious reasons.  This static pseudo comedy/horror flick has several drawbacks, not the least of which is every character is reprehensible and unremittingly dull.  When people are dispatched in the usual way, it's with an air of ""who cares.""  Everyone is dour and nondescript.  The mastermind is easily discredited as an idiot by the actions of another unscrupulous villain who beats him at his own came simply through stealth rather than intelligence (which everyone claims to have).  The sets are few, the `action' limited, the plot is threadbare, the dialog lacks wit.  I was thoroughly unimpressed with this venture by Charles (hit or miss) Band.  It wasn't whacky enough, wasn't absorbing, it played out like a one joke premise that repeatedly kept hitting the same note, cue the band (that joke grew old instantly yet they kept using it throughout).  Worse.  They gave their movie two endings (probably because it was a tad short, yet oh so long, at a mere 85 minutes)!  It needed to be goofier, more ridiculous, more sinister..........something, anything.

It's not as if I don't have a lot of Charles Band's movies in my collection, I do, but this one isn't going to join them.  It was okay for a single viewing; don't care to see it again.

195095,5,1573471070,"Like most full moon products Blood Dolls is a really cheap horror movie. It is also a lot of fun. The music is really cool, the acting is extremely cheesy, and the story is just plain fun. One of the things I like most about the movie is that everybody is bad. There are no real good guys in the movie. It is unusual to have no one to root for in these movies.",1366156800,,360,3.8783783783783785
195096,4,1573471070,"How do you describe a movie like Blood Dolls? it's crazy, it's silly, it's gory, it's funny, it's complex and it's simple all at the same time. Now I'm a huge Full Moon fan I love B movies of all kinds and Blood Dolls really is something different, is it the best Full Moon feature ever made? Not by a longshot, is it one of the best? Maybe. There is so much going on that you don't quite know what to focus on, but it's fun no matter what aspect of the film you wanna focus on.

 It seems almost redundant to explain the plot and characters as so many other people have done it, but in time honored tradition I'll do it. The main character is an eccentric billionaire named Virgil who has recently lost a substantial amount of money after being cheated out by his business partners, he blames his lawyers for it and does away with them. We then have some other weirdos like a clown who considers himself out of character as a costume(creepy) a dwarf,(little person, sorry) a hot girl band trapped in a cage(though it's implied they're allowed outside occasionally)and of course the Blood Dolls themselves which are a real rogue's gallery of freakazoids. The first half of the movie consists of him using his little friends the Blood Dolls to get revenge on his corrupt business friends,(yeah, yeah). This half of the movie is great there's blood being spilled and plenty of wacky things being shoved at us to keep things that much more interesting with all that imagery and scenes that come up.

The second half is still good but not quite as much mostly because most of the killing is over with, but there's still plenty to look at. The antagonist(?) is Moira who pretends to be innocent and dainty with her passive husband who is Virgil's arch rival, but she proves to be the real brains of the operation and quite the crazy power hungry chick and manages to use Virgil's revenge scheme to her advantage on occasion. The latter half consists of her and Virgil trying to outsmart each other in this sort of deadlock that occurs, she even manages to gain the upper hand by capturing the Blood Dolls and seemingly is going to win. Then the film takes an 180 and takes a weird nearly soap opera direction that is not what you expect to see in a Full Moon film but fair enough. The ending(s?)is a genuine surprise and left me scratching my head saying ""What the hell do I make of this?"" I was genuinely not expecting something like that from Band.

Charles Band takes alot of chances with this film, to be honest but I think it mostly pays off and though Blood Dolls is not perfect it's entertaining enough especially if your're already a Full Moon fan. The music is great I genuinely like it and I really wish there was a soundtrack available( I even read online that Band wanted to actually promote the band itself and sell cds and do tours and stuff, but he quickly backed out after he saw it would cost more than the movie itself, which is a shame I would've liked to see and hear more of these girls.)and the DVD itself is very well done, the picture quality is crisp and clear and looks really good for such a low budget movie, and the sound is absolutely perfect. The best thing though is that the DVD is LOADED with every special feature you could want there's plenty of goodies to check out after you're done watching the movie. Overall it's a good B-movie and that's all Blood Dolls is just a fun B-movie, but it almost becomes something more, I recommend it and you'll most likely enjoy it. Final score: for Full Moon fans 4 stars, everyone else 3.5 stars.",1360972800,,3565,4.438167938931298

I just watched this movie and was astounded by the large number and wide variety of bad ideas packed into it.  I didn't know a movie could have this much action and yet be so boring.  It's 85 minutes long, but it seemed like 85 hours.  I didn't know that such bad actors could get star billing.  You learn something new every day.

195099,2,1573471070,"Blood Dolls isn't so much strange as people and the director have said, as more, and interesting idea that failed to achieve becoming a really great movie. A deformed business man and his second hand clown faced man have just lost a court-case against someone they beleive to be as smart as they are. He realized that the Judge and Prosecutor where paid off to go with a verdict in his competitions way, so he shrinks the Judge and Prosecutor down into dolls, one a pimp-clown and the other a complete rip-off of Pinhead from Puppet Master. Oh, the main villain I believe is named Pinhead too! How surprising.

Pinhead also shrinks down his lawyer and has a total of 3 puppets, a clown sidekick and a band of lesbian rockers locked up in a cage that get electrocuted if they don't play when the midget demands them too. The little guy is a recognized face, but I have no idea what his name is, nor do I care, but the band in the cage must have been a real band, because not one of them can act for $#@*. The Dolls are then summoned to go and kill the competition, but the other side figures things out and go on the defense with an offense plan as well.

Quite frankly, this movie failed in just about every attempt it had to make a decent movie. Obviously the director wanted to make a Puppet Master movie, but I guess didn't get the rights to make one, so he made his own version, packed with a pinhead boss who reminds me of Beetlejuice at the end of his movie where his head is shrunk... then there is the clown faced side-kick who I guess was supposed to be a man who does anything for his boss, but no explanation as to why he thinks he is a combination of Alfred Pennington and The Joker. The all girl rock band was a horrible idea to have them play every song throughout the whole movie... I dunno, maybe the director thought trying to include video clip like scenes would be a brilliant idea, but it was annoying after the 2nd song they do. It seems they have a total of 10 songs, and when the Pinhead boss wants a song, he calls out a number, and they play a song that I guess reflects what he is feeling. When they don't play, they either fight with each other or sit around depressed and adding contribution ideas to the boss's .... euhh, forget it, it's too stupid to explain how badly placed the whole thing is of chronically confused lesbian band members.

The opposition side is controlled pretty much by one man, so people think, but by the end the real brains are exposed and her character is supposed to be as brilliant minded as Pinheads, but you know what, nothing at all seemed to show any intelligence, just like the way this whole movie plays out. The comedy relies more on how stupid plots are or how dumb someone looks... look a guy with a small head... hardy-har-hAr... sigh. Nothing about this movie is anything I would say is something that is a must watch for horror movie fans, or even Puppet Master fans. I had high hopes that maybe this would go nicely with my Puppet Master collection, and maybe think of it as an unofficial sequel or something from their timeline or universe etc... but no, this movie is not worthy of being a part of that and will never sit on the shelf next to Puppet Master or be mentioned in the same context ever again by me.",1329177600,,3282,4.307443365695793

Great mix of horror/humor, and a fun movie I can see myself watching over and over.  It ranks right up in my guilty pleasure department with Killer Klowns from Outer Space.  All the characters are enjoyable and they all fit very well into the plot.  It's just a fun watch.  You get creepy, funny, serious, complex, simple all rolled into one.  One of the few B movies that is enjoyable and gets better with each view.
