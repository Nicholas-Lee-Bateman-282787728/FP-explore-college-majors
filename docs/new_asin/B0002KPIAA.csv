8028341,5,B0002KPIAA,"This is an older movie, but sounded fun. I'm a big HBC fan and was afraid I would never see it as all the copies I came across were for the wrong region. I finally got a copy that works for US region and it was worth the wait. Cora and Ellen have the kind of friendship that would be great for all women to have... except for Cora accidentally sleeping with Ellen's husband. It really was a positive movie about friendship and how they were there for each other without being judgmental. Their whole circle of friends seemed like a good group of  people to hang out with.",1500768000,,571,4.238532110091743
