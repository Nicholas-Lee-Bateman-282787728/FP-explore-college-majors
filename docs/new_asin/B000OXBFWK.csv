Although, due to time constraints, some parts had to be revised, the end result is nothing short of brilliant! If you are a fan of the manga, you owe it to yourself to check this movie out. If you've never heard of Death Note before, you will not be disappointed. This is one of the of the greatest psychological thrillers of our generation!",1314921600,,412,4.434210526315789

8187131,5,B000OXBFWK,"I never read or seen the comic, ""Death Note"" and was a little sketchy about watching these films (the boxset).  Most Japanese movies is not to my liking, but this film rocks!  Truly suspenseful and wicked!  I believe the director, writer and actors did an overall great job in making these films.  The bonus features were interesting and backstage to the film.  Once you watched the firt one sequel, you will want to watch the next.  Great stuff.  Great writing.  Awesome movie!",1190851200,,478,4.7439024390243905
8187132,5,B000OXBFWK,"This is one of the best real person movies that was based on a manga. It does not follow too closely with plot of the manga/anime, but it has it's own favor to it. The ending was more suspenseful but different. Many of my friends loved it which include me. Tatsuya Fujiwara makes an interesting Light Yagami. Kenichi Matsuyama portrays L perfectly down to the last bit of movement and eating habit. Erika Toda is Misa Amane with the exception of black hair instead of blond, her outfit and personality fit the character very well. It will make a Death Note fan very happy. I also own the DVD. If it's directly imported from Japan, the picture quality is very good. Also, you will be able to enjoy some of the funniest cast interviews.",1183248000,4,734,4.485074626865671
