6303935,5,B00IXPQU8U,this is a great DVD to watch and the matches were great and john CENA VS BRAY WYATT STEEL CAGE IS ONE OF THE BEST,1402358400,,113,3.56
6303936,4,B00IXPQU8U,"Rob Van Dam vs. Jack Swagger vs. Cesaro - It was made clear in the beginning that this match was every man for himself with each man having their own issue with both of his opponents leading to various situations where the third man capitalized on a situation involved his two opponents such as one man being flipped onto the other & situations where one man executed an offense move only for the third man to deliver one right after while each man in this match was given his own moment of dominance throughout the match from either RVD starting out to deliver a 5 Star Frog Splash only to end up in the anklelock, Cesaro powering one man from the apron into a superplex, or RVD resorting to his past extreme ways with a Van Daminator using a trash can.  This was a great opener with tons of great sequences & very physical to the point where one man showed the effects of the match for days afterwords.

Rusev vs. R-Truth & Xavier Woods - This was pretty much a squash match with Rusev taking out Woods on the floor before the match started before dominating Truth in the ring with his size & power.

Intercontinental Champion Big E vs. Bad News Barrett - Big E started out showcasing his power with moves like the shoulderblock takedown before Barrett was able to use Big E's momentum against him more than once to get an advantage while keeping him grounded on the mat to take away his power advantage as both men traded momentum delivering some physical offense such as a big overhead release suplex, a Cactus Jack elbow off the apron to the floor, and a spear through the ropes.  A really good match here with the interesting twist of who the crowd decided to support throughout the match.

The Shield vs. Evolution - This started out as a brawl between all six men before things settled down with Evolution dominated grounding one man with their power offense & illegal double & triple teaming in their corner while The Shield took back control with each member using their strengths such as Ambrose's brawling & Rollings aerial assault & Reigns power along with double & triple team tactics of own including using a specific submission maneuver just to play mind games before things really got out of control with the action spilling onto the outside with men fighting on & running across announce tables into the crowd with one man taking one hell of a ""leap of faith.""  You can tell going into this match that it was going to be a war & it didn't disappoint one bit.

Steel Cage Match: John Cena vs. Bray Wyatt - This match started off pretty even with both men attempting to use the cage to their advantage only for it to be countered or blocked with the Wyatt's showing when the opportunity came that a cage wasn't going to stop them from getting involved & was able to use it against Cena from the outside both physically & mentally as a distraction while Bray did the same including attempting to spiderwalk out of the cage at one point as Cena continued to play defense as he had to keep dealing with Bray inside the ring countering his offense while Rowan & Harper kept stopping him from escaping outside of the ring.  While I am a fan of the storyline coming into the match (including the creepy ""Children Of The Corn"" moment at the beginning of the previous RAW), I didn't like this match as it did have some entertaining action but was pretty much a glorified handicap match and had more interference than their previous WrestleMania match along with the ending suppose to be creepy but came off a bit silly.

Divas Champion Paige vs. Tamina Snuka - Paige came out very fast paced keeping Tamina grounded attempting to take away her strength advantage only for Tamina to regain control by slowing the face down & using her power via multiple slams & even swinging her into the barricade at one point causing Paige to switch gears attempting to play defense & catch her.  This match told a good story but was a step down from the previous PPV divas title matches.

Extreme Rules Match: WWE Champion Daniel Bryan vs. Kane - Bryan came after Kane in the isleway only for Kane to react aggressively slamming him against the apron with & using the barricade on more than one occasion to punish him as both men started to fight fire with fire using various weapons from a kendo stick to parts of the announce table to using a chair in various ways to punish each other such as being slammed & dropped onto it both when it was both closed & opened as this fight continued outside of the ring from the stage area to backstage with everything being used that they could get their hands on including windshields & car windows getting damaged in the process with the fight getting taken back to the ring in one of the most unique ways ever seen as things just continued to get even more aggressive as the heat got turned up...literally  (just look at the DVD cover)!  This was the type of aggressive & out of control brawl WWE hasn't seen in a very long time & showcased both men perfectly with Kane being the unstoppable demon that we haven't seen in a very long time.

(Pre-Show) WeeLC Match: El Torito vs. Hornswoggle - I'll try to avoid all of the usual puns & jokes about the obvious during this review as this match just had so many highlights such as 3MB & Los Matadores getting involved & taking their own share of hard hits & bad landings due to their opposition & even at one point their own partner, both men using their own special tables & ladders & chairs, someone at one point having a fear a heights, and the most hysterical commentary I've heard in a long time thanks to J.B.Elf & Micro Cole & Jerry Smaller.  This was exactly what it was designed to be...entertaining.

This was a good PPV as we got solid action with a majority of the roster working very hard & taking more physical risk than we normally see from them as there wasn't a bad match on here so this is an event I would recommend.",1400284800,,5920,4.457486136783734
6303937,4,B00IXPQU8U,"El Torito vs Hornswoggle Preshow Match: I just know 2 things, one El Torito won and two, the match needed Brock Lesnar lol.

  RVD vs Swagger vs Antonio Cesaro vs Swagger in an elimination match: RVD pinned Swagger and Cesaro gave RVD his finisher on a garbage pail for the win.

  The Shield vs Evolution: Since I waited too long to write a review without the show fresh in my mind; I just remember Orton and Triple H fighting Ambrose and Rollins through the crowd. Then Reigns being left alone with Batista and gettingthe win with a spear on Batista.
  I'm sure Evolution will get the win at Payback though.

  Rusev vs Xavier Woods and R-Truth and getting the submission win on Truth in the most predictable match of the night.

  Bray Wyatt vs John Cena in a steel cage: Since the other Wyatt's were out there Cena had trouble escaping the cage. Super Cena of course did a good job fighting three people by himself. Cena would have even won if a kid with a demonic voice singing ""he got the whole world in his hands"", didn't distract Cena. Bray then hit Sister Abrigal but of course chose to escape the cage by the door, over pinning Cena.
  Cena made Ryback look weak at Payback last year and ruined his momentum for good. I predict he does the same to Bray at Payback this year. Cena's character is played out and moves like the Five Knuckle Shuffle are as painful to watch as ever. So my advice to WWE is to just let Bray win the feud. He needs it a lot more than Cena. Make a new star, don't panic and ruin him like you did Ryback.

  Tamina vs Paige: I only know 2 things, one Paige won by submission and two I love Paige! She has made the Diva division worth watching again.

  Kane vs Bryan: The match was entertaining but I don't remember all the details. Just remember that Bryan won with the running knee. And afterwards Kane had fire explode at the entrance signaling that this isn't over. At Payback though I predict Kane doesn't get the win and redemption that Cena and Evolution will obviously get that night.",1399420800,2,2027,4.363636363636363
6303938,3,B00IXPQU8U,"The RVD-Cesaro-Jack Swagger-3 way Elimination match was a solid yet unspectacular way to start the show. The Handicap match between Alexander Russev against the team of R-Truth & Xavier Woods was a one-sided filler and flop. The IC title match between Big E Langston & Big News Barrett was not great but pretty good. The 6 man tag team match between Evolution & The Shield was a chaotic and wild brawl in a good way. The Cage Match between John Cena & Bray Wyatt was all smoke and mirrors with overkill on visual falls to cover the fact that Cena was losing. Translation: It was awful. The Divas title match between Paige & Tamina Snuka was short but solid. The Extreme Rules match for the WWE Worlds title betweeen Daniel Bryan & Kane was a hardcore,smash-mouth,violent,personal bout with a awesome ending to boot. I give this PPV a 6 out fo 10.",1399248000,2,846,4.572368421052632
6303939,5,B00IXPQU8U,"1.) Triple Threat Elimination Extreme Rules Elimination Match: RVD vs Jack Swagger vs Cesaro

At first I was a little skeptical to them adding RVD to this match but it turned out to be a great move. Swagger is eliminated first following a superplex from Cesaro and a 5 Star Frog Splash from Van Dam. That then left RVD and Cesaro to go at it and indeed they did! Both superstars are very resilient and athletic in the ring, which made it really exciting to watch. RVD brings a trash can in the ring and tries to 5 Star Frog Splash Cesaro on it but he moves out of the way. Cesaro Neutralizes RVD on the trash can for the win. I hope RVD and Cesaro have plenty more matches with each other down the line. They're 2 that mix well in the ring

2.) Alexander Rusev w/Lana vs R-Truth and Xavier Woods

Honestly, this match should've happened on the pre-show. With Rusev recently debuting, everyone knew Truth and Xavier weren't winning. Rusev wins with his Accolade camel clutch on Truth

____________________________________________________________________________________________

3.) Intercontinental Championship Match: Bad News Barrett vs Big E Langston (c)

After Bad News Barrett won a tournament on the Raws leading up to Extreme Rules to determine the new #1 Contender for the Intercontinental Championship, his IC Title match was granted here against Big E. A decently solid match from both Barrett and Big E. Barrett has been getting pushed by the company since his in-ring return last month so it was kind of obvious he was going to win the title here. Barrett nails Big E with the Bullhammer for the win and we have a new IC Champion! I just hope that WWE gives Barrett a better reign as IC Champion this year, unlike his lackluster 2013 reign

____________________________________________________________________________________________

4.) Evolution vs The Shield

This was without a doubt the match of the night. A lot of nice ring psychology in this match that definitely told a story. With the recently reunited Evolution battling against The Shield, this match was personal and was all about who was going to perish. The action was spine-tingling and even breath-taking! The fight goes into the crowd with Triple H, Randy Orton, Rollins, and Ambrose. Rollins steals the show with a Jeff Hardy like dive off a ledge onto Triple H and Orton below. Back in the ring, Reigns mops the floor with Batista with his Superman punch and a spear for the win! This is definitely a match of the year nominee!

____________________________________________________________________________________________

5.) Steel Cage Match: John Cena vs Bray Wyatt

After failing to destroy his legacy at Wrestlemania, Bray Wyatt wanted to find a way to bring out the monster in John Cena so they battled it out in a rematch inside of a Steel Cage. I have to say, I was nervous watching this match because at certain times it seemed like Cena was almost going to win. Another win from Cena would've destroyed a good chunk of the Wyatt Family's credibility. Just as Cena prepares to escape, the lights go out and a little kid in a black robe with a demon voice sings ""He's Got The Whole World In His Hands"" to John Cena. That was without a doubt, probably the scariest thing WWE has done since Undertaker hung Big Boss Man at Wrestlemania 15. Cena creeped out by the kid, gets back in the ring, where he gets Sister Abigailed by Bray. Bray escapes the cage and walks away with Luke Harper, Erick Rowan, and ""Little Johnny"". Now all he needs is Sister Abigail! But the ending was absolutely epic!

____________________________________________________________________________________________

6.) Diva's Championship Match: Tamina Snuka vs Paige

After Paige defeated AJ Lee on the Raw After Wrestlemania and ended her reign as longest Diva's Champion in history, Paige's first challenge was non other than AJ's bodyguard, Tamina. The lack of build-up for this match made it obvious that Paige was retaining the title. Other than a stare down on an episode of Main Event, there was no build-up between Tamina and Paige. No segments, promos, or attacks. Paige retains with the Scorpion Crosslock on Tamina

7.) WWE Unified Championship Match: Daniel Bryan (c) vs Kane

After Stephanie McMahon unleashed the demonic side of Kane, we witnessed the return of the Big Red Machine! In the weeks leading up to the PPV, Kane Tombstoned Daniel Bryan 3 times. Once on the floor, once on the steel steps, and another on the announce table. The following week, he tried to drag Brie Bella to hell but she escaped. This match was personal and a lot of historical riding on it. Everyone knows Kane and Bryan's history. They went from enemies to one of the most popular tag teams of the Modern Era, Hell No. But those days were gone and now Bryan would be fighting for his life and championships against the Big Red Machine! This match was excellent! Kane and Bryan tore into each other and we even got a backstage fight, re-living the old WWF days. Bryan ends up knocking Kane out with a tire iron and brings him back to the ring on a forklift. Bryan's headbutt from the top of the forklift was amazing to no end. But it doesn't stop there! Kane sets a table on fire and prepares to Chokeslam Bryan through it, but Bryan manages to push Kane through it! After some shady assistance from a guy with an extinguisher, Bryan hits Kane with the high knee for the win

Overall: This PPV was amazing! WWE must've hired some new writers because this was the best Extreme Rules PPV WWE has done so far! After a rather boring Extreme Rules last year, WWE stepped it up this year and literally made this PPV extreme! Flaming tables, bent trash cans, demon kids, high flying leaps!

EXTREME RULES 2014

1.[THRIPLE THREAT]RVD VS CESARO VS JACK SWAGGER-excellent opening match with three great guys involved. The action is fast paced as one would expect from these types of matches. All three battle looking great until Swagger is eliminated. RVD and Cesaro now battle it out and are excellent together. They go back and forth until Cesaro takes advantage of an RVD misstep and gets the win.

2. R-TRUTH & XAVIAR WOODS VS RUSEV-one of those good old fashioned squash matches. Rusev basically takes out Woods and then dominates Truth for the win. Fun match for what it is.

3.[I-C TITLE]BIG E VS BAD NEWS BARRETT-we get a really good match between these two with the people behind the heel. Barrett the more technical of the two but also a brawler held his own against the powerhouse. Good back and forth with Barrett taking the title.

4. EVOLUTION VS THE SHIELD-probably the best match on the card as these six guys just delivered. The action is all over the place once it turns into the brawl. But at first the match is an actual tag match but it gets chaotic. All six guys looked good here but to be honest this was a showcase for The Shield. They get the win in an excellent match.

5.[STEEL CAGE]BRAY WYATT VS JOHN CENA-if the last match wasn't the best match on the card then this one was. These two battle it out in a nice brawl with the Family on the outside. That of course keeps Cena in the cage, including a very creative way. Both Wyatt and Cena look great here in a different match than they gave us at Mania. I will say that the right guy actually won this one, Bray Wyatt. He should have won at Mania but at least they gave him this one. I thought the ending was fitting.

6.[DIVAS TITLE]PAIGE VS TAMINA-this was a pretty good Divas match. Tamina used her strength to beat down Paige but Paige kept coming. Good effort from both ladies with Paige coming out on top.

7.[WWE TITLE EXTREME RULES]DANIEL BRYAN VS KANE-this was an excellent match that was full of spots and action from start to finish. They fought from the ring to the back and back again. This was a fight, brawl, slobber knocker, whatever you want to call it. Every weapon that you can think of was used here including a forklift. Things get a bit heated in the end with a table on fire which leads to a Bryan victory retaining the title. This was one of the most fun matches I have seen, great match.

BONUS

1.[WEELC MATCH]EL TORITO VS HORSWOGGLE-great opening match between these two guys right here. I loved that everything including the announcer and play by play team were also wee. The wee chairs, stairs and ladders were used here along with wee tables. This was a straight fun match and helped kick the night off right. Both guys did a great job and their respective teams also got involved. El Torito takes the victory here.

You also get an interview with The Shield before their match as well as post match press conference footage with Bryan and Bray Wyatt as bonus features. This was a great event full of great matches and some really fun ones. Recommended to any wrestling fans out there.",1434412800,,3103,4.48581560283688

8646081,4,B00IXPQU8U,"Extreme Rules 2014 was the first and, basically, the last of the Daniel Bryan movement that began earlier in the year (once it became clear the WWE couldn't continue to shaft him into the mid-card). Unfortunately, Bryan was forced to the sidelines shortly after this show, leaving the WWE to rebuild their summer plans from the ground up. Nevertheless, this show gave us a glimpse of what they had planned with Bryan at the helm, and, I gotta say, it looked pretty good!

Not Worth Watching: Rusev squashed R-Truth and Xavier Woods in a handicap match, Paige defended her newly won Divas Title against Tamina in a mediocre match, and Bray Wyatt defeated John Cena in Steel Cage match. Too bad there were so many shenanigans in the match that it hardly felt like Bray won anything at all.

Worth Watching: Cesaro fought Rob Van Dam and Jack Swagger in an elimination match, Bad News Barrett and Big E has a solid fight over the Intercontinental Title, and Dani Bryan defended the  WWE Title in a really good Extreme Rules match that included tables, fire and other crazy spots.

Match of the Night: the Shield and Evolution had another in a series of great, show stealing tag team matches at this show. This was a bit below the Wyatt's encounter with the Shield at Elimination Chamber, but it's still an amazingly well put together match with constant action from bell to bell.

Aside from Cena/Wyatt, nothing performed below expectations. There's some great matches on the show and the good far outweighs the bad.",1406419200,,1513,4.737642585551331
