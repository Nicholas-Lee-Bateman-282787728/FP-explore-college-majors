8337654,4,B000AA4H0E,"Coming from New York City and being a hard core basketball fan, The Documentary Hood Hoops really gives and inside look and interviews with NBA Stars like Rafer Alston,Patrick Ewing, Cutino Mobley, Steve Francis and Rap Stars like Fat Joe who explain street ball culture and the competitions and then how this outlet leads to College Recruiting and NBA opportunities in some cases. I would say about 65% is hard core Street Ball Action and 35% Interviews with a great rap soundtrack. The Bonus CD or second CD is a soundtrack that comes with the DVD Video so a great value and must have for Rap, Hip Hop, Basketball Fans",1264896000,,620,4.6454545454545455
