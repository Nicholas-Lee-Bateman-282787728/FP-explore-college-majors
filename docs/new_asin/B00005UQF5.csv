1667066,4,B00005UQF5,"Joey and Matthew Lawrence are impossibly gorgeous -- you can't look directly at them, or you fall into a catatonic stupor. (Andy needs another few years of bulking up.) Putting them together in a movie set on a tropical island, where they wear as little as possible, is a risky proposition -- who's going to pay attention to the plot?
Ok, I didn't. There's some minor character-building and relationship problems with pat Disney-esque solutions. Joey bonds with Andy. Pirates attack. Andy bonds with Matt. Pirates kidnap Andy. Matt bonds with Joey. Etc. The conclusion is fairly touching, with the trio deciding to stay together even after their rescue -- I think they go into business together, but I'm not sure.  I was just coming out of the catatonic stupor.",1024185600,,761,4.89922480620155

1667133,5,B00005UQF5,Great Disney film. This film has all 3 Lawrence brothers in it unlike the prequel. A bit corny at parts but over all fun and a good story line. It's a great follow up to Horse Sense!,1439510400,,182,3.945945945945946

1667160,5,B00005UQF5,"My son and I have always loved this movie and I was glad to find it on DVD.  Our VHS tape was getting worn out.  It's kind of an implausible story, but it had the three Lawrence brothers and all are credible actors.  Their supporting cast did a good job, too.  The scenery kind of stole the show, though.  I love the ocean and islands, so it all combined into a fun movie to watch.",1408665600,2,381,4.026666666666666
1667161,1,B00005UQF5,Won't buy it too pricy :( if it was $10 or less then I would buy it. It's not because I'm cheap but it's an older disney channel movie like really? Almost $30? Rip off,1403222400,,167,3.8
1667162,5,B00005UQF5,I watch this on disney channel on april 18th 2014 and it was great. it was on at midnight at i watched it all the way through. Unforcanately I cant afford it right now but it was great. To bad I had to get up at 3,1397865600,,213,3.5531914893617023
1667163,4,B00005UQF5,"This is a good movie, and a cute squeal to the original, Horse Sense. That said however this movie, and others like it are overpriced on Amazon. Any movie from Disney's movie club that is labeled ""Disney Exclusive"" has the price marked up 50-100 percent when it reaches amazon. For example Gargoyles season 2 volume 2 is priced 40 on amazon but only 20 on Disney.com.
If you want this move go get it from Disney it's $10 cheaper.

That said any chance Disney has released the first one, Horse sense. Don't get me wrong Jumping ship is good  but like most sequels they just can't quite top the first one.",1392940800,,603,4.423423423423423

1667165,3,B00005UQF5,What I wanted to buy was Horse Sense w/ Joey Lawrence.  Bought this to give it a chance.  The story line isn't as good and I wasn't impressed w/ some of the acting.  It is an option for older boys for something to watch w/ action etc.  I just wish they would release that other DVD...bummer.,1378425600,,291,4.142857142857143
1667166,5,B00005UQF5,This is an awesome Disney Channel movie with all three hunky Lawrence brothers.  One of my children's all time favorites!,1359158400,,121,5.05
1667167,5,B00005UQF5,This was one of my favorite movies since the first time I saw it on the Disney Channel.  I was so happy when I finally found it on DVD!,1358035200,,135,3.6551724137931036

1667200,5,B00005UQF5,"This is a great movie, fun to watch. I first saw this movie when I was babysitting for a friend of mine several years back and recorded it onto vhs (since they didn't have dvds yet or they just came out with them, can't remember which) The kids loved the movie as well, the thing that I'm confused about is that this is the sequel to the movie Horse Sense, a movie that I loved and have been looking for for a long time and I can't find it anywhere. I did just order this movie (Jumping Ship) because it is a great movie, but it would be nice to have the movie Horse Sense as well since it was the movie that started it all and it also explains a few things in this movie Jumping Ship that if you hadn't seen the movie Horse Sense might not make sense. If anyone has any information as to where I could purchase the movie ""Horse Sense"" please leave a message on here in your review, I will be back to read reviews periodically.  Thanks.

I also hope that this review helps others trying to decide if they want to buy this movie, it is very good. They do have it priced kind of high for an older movie, but I feel it's woth the price, you can always go to e-bay and see if you can find it cheaper, sometimes you can find movies at a cheaper price there and sometimes they cost more, it's kind of a catch 22 really, ya just never know which way it will go :)  Anyway, I hope that this might help some of you.

Thanks for reading!",1353283200,,1427,4.014084507042254
1667201,2,B00005UQF5,"Would love to buy this movie I remember watching it on Disney when i was little, but it is way overpriced! this makes no sense...bring the price down and ill buy",1349222400,3,161,4.225806451612903
1667202,5,B00005UQF5,"I love this movie and the movie Prince for a Day with Joey Lawrence. Unfortunately you can't find that one anywhere. But I would love to buy Jumping Ship, but seriously almost 30 dollars? That's crazy considering it's rather old and it's not on blu-ray.",1300320000,9,253,4.644444444444445
1667203,5,B00005UQF5,"I was up late last night and they played this on the Disney Channel at like 1:30 am.  It was so good I couldn't get to sleep I had to keep watching it.  I wish I would have taped it on Windows Media Center, because now I can't find any showings on TV.  This is a sequel to the first movie ""Horse Sense"" which I can't find anywhere.  I would love to see the first movie, and wish I would have before this movie.  So I suggest that you watch Horse Sense first if you can find it, then this movie.  It keeps you on the edge of suspense every scene.  Very good movie with good twists and great ending.  Price for the DVD is way overpriced though.  They should have a DVD of the first and second movies on one, and charge like 14.99 like regular dvds are.  But anyways, 5 stars.",1279411200,2,773,3.9934640522875817
1667204,4,B00005UQF5,"The lead actors are three brothers in real life working together in an action filled story. Having gone on a private boat cruise, Michael and Tommy (played by Joseph and Andrew Lawrence, respectively) find themselves being chased by a group of criminals. Forced to abbandon their boat, they and the owner of the boat (their cruise guide, played by Matthew Lawrence) jump off of it, and swim over to a small uninhabited island. It`s fun...with good music...and, with a tropical background :)",1235174400,3,490,4.987804878048781

Now we want to buy a DVD so we can watch as often as we want to. Love the Lawrence boys, they do a great job in this movie.....Would like to find their movie Horse Sense now too........",1218844800,,309,3.9206349206349205

Fantastic movie! Just great!

1667207,5,B00005UQF5,"There was so much more to this movie than just three guys shipwrecked!  There were lessons on the value of friends and family... and just how valuable material objects are.  But it's just like Disney to add a moral to a story... thank goodness!  This is the reason I feel comfortable turning on the Disney channel when our family sits down to watch a movie together.
I really liked to see all the Lawrence brothers together, as well.  I still can't decide which is my favorite.  The movie had action, adventure, and drama all rolled into one.  Though the plot seemed unbelievable, it didn't seem completely impossible either... and usually I watch a movie for its entertainment value, not necessarily it's realistic possibilities.  Anyways, this is an excellent movie, the whole family will enjoy!",1033689600,,797,4.902985074626866
1667208,3,B00005UQF5,"Although slightly implausible, ""Jumping Ship"" is a good all round family entertainer - ideal for those lazy summer afternoons, when you need something fun and light to entertain the kids. Certainly worth watching. There are no Oscar winning performances from the young cast, however, its pace is at a comfortable jog and worth sticking though all the clich&eacute;s. The director left a couple of ""bloopers"" in the final version that are a nice touch.",1027296000,,451,5.108108108108108
