3036450,5,B000YXMM9U,"I found this new series by Michael Palin to be remarkable.
As has been mentioned, he investigates and travels through parts of Europe not necessarily familiar to all people as they have not always been accesible for one reason or another (generally speaking, communism).
The fact of the matter is that many of these countries paid a remarkably high price to be the ""free"" Europe they are today.
Many of these countries are very small and offered both Nazi Germany and then Stalinist Russia a great deal of resistance and suffered accordingly. Michael Palin does not shy away from these facts and this approach makes this quite different from his other travelogues.
This particular series is imbued with a definite sense of melancholy and bittersweet feelings.
Rather than the lack of energy some reviewers seem to sense, I feel that Michael Palin has shown a remarkable degree of maturity and intelligence in his approach to this series.
This is a very good series and, I feel, a really good documentation of where these countries are today. The whole thing is approached with wit, wisdom, grace and  respect.
I've been to Estonia, Finland and Hungary and you cannot leave these countries without an enormous amount of respect for these people for what they have accomplished in so little time as well as the resistance they offered their oppressors.
I am pretty certain I will be watching this series more than once and I do highly recommend it.",1210809600,10,1446,4.878048780487805
3036451,5,B000YXMM9U,The BBC and Michael Palin's travel programs never disappoint me.  I teach HS Geography and use many of the videos in class.  Money well spent.,1209859200,4,142,4.64
3036452,3,B000YXMM9U,"After having seen Around the World in 80 Days, The Himalayas, Sahara, I was really looking forward to another exciting adventure with Mr. Palin. The nations covered in this series are in the forefront of international news hence, such coverage were, indeed, timely. Who could have imagined countries such as Croatia, Slovakia, Latvia would emerge from the rubble of the Great East Shake up in the late 80s early 90's which continued into the present with the eventual break-up of Yugoslavia. This moved further with Kosovo finally achieving independence in early 2008.

Mr. Palin tried his best to be in top form clowning here and there, joining artists and theatre groups sometimes doing impromptu roles but one obviously sees that age has caught with him. His efforts to make some scenes funny can be ridiculous at times (A very good example would be that laughing group in East Berlin. There you see him laughing but quite bored and looking at his watch - that should have been edited). THe quest for youth or more accurately health promotion is covered extensively specially those scenes taken in Hungary, the Czech Republic, Latvia or was it Estonia(?).

In previous series, you saw him running around town and that looks fine but this time, you see a haggard-looking host with the usual unappetizing bland Britishness from dressing to even hosting.

Since much of this new Europe thing is about the political change going on in the continent, the concentration should have been on that arena. However, there were great moments in the program specially as he asked his guests about their perception of their country, where it is going - form those articulately worded opinions of those 2 Serbian ladies to the philosophically absurd views of a Romanian train passenger.

The deleted scene of a once popular Macedonian singer basically defines a sectoral view of the break-up of Tito's empire and it came out strongly.  You can basically feel the passion and longing of the singer and her ""Don't Cry"" says it all.  Its deletion is worth explaining.  Actually, a number of those deleted scenes has greater relevance on the balkanization process which has reemerged and has continued to plague the region just recently. Mr. Palin would have concentrated along this line - more of a serious documentary rather than a travelogue primarily because the concept of a new Europe is more of an economic and a political reality rather than being caught up as tourist trap. Besides, one can not forever clown his way; even Chaplin has to take serious roles when he reached a certain age. Europe is a serious idea, very much Teutonic in character and not a glossy American attraction.

The Romanian journey is one of the highlights of this series - it was an eye-opener for travel hungry eyes longing to see the Old Europe (I mean the Europe of yore) still visible in this part of the world. Snippets of Transdniestra, Western Ukraine and even Kaliningrad were unexpected but worth including simply for their being part of the continent as well as the delicacy of savoring something from the Unknown.

I was just a little shock to have Turkey included and with the implied assertion of even neighboring countries like Syria, Iraq, Iran being gobbled up by this peninsula of Asia (which actually is). Let's wait for the Old Europe to decide on that whether this time the Ottoman descendant will finally realize its dream of conquering the continent. The Cappadocian episode taken in its winter dressing is just a marvelous sight!",1209772800,3,3520,4.912457912457913

3036454,5,B000YXMM9U,"Once again ex-Python turned globetrotter and British national icon Michael Palin goes out into the world to ""discover"" new and wonderful places. This time around Palin gives up the far away exotic places of travels before and stays a bit closer to home, namely Eastern Europe.

Eastern Europe was, as Palin points out, off limits in all senses of the word for the better part of half a century, which has greatly influenced the way in which Western Europe sees these ""new"" neighbours. We do indeed know very little about them. Michael Palin frequently asks the people he meets to compare their countries and societies during and post communistic rule, which actually makes for some quite interesting answers.

Palin also meets up with some of the people he has encountered on his previous travels around the world, for example the Yugoslav captain of a ship he travelled with in ""Around the World in 80 Days"", which adds a nice sense of familiarity (and quriousity for the viewers with prior knowledge of Palins earlier travels).

Palin is, of course, in usual good form and delivers a witty yet informative narrative and proves yet again why he is one of the best television presenters. His high spirits and pleasant smile really inspires the viewer, and makes you understand why there is such a thing as 'the palin effect', where people go to places en masse because they saw it in one of his series.

The programmes are visually stunning and very well produced. The extra material in this version is plentiful with loads of scenes that didn't make the final cut. It is probably not the best series that Palin has made to date, but it still stands head and shoulders above the competition. Worth every penny and more still.

Highly recommended.",1207699200,16,1746,4.806666666666667

3036456,5,B000YXMM9U,"I like all of the Michael Palin travelogues, but this is my favorite. If you like any of the previous adventures then you will also like this one. Hitting a number of countries that he has never visited before, Palin takes us for a casual inside look off the beaten path of such wonderful destinations as Bulgaria, Hungary, Moldova, Turkey, Romania and others. What I like best about these Palin travels is that it is not the obvious ""tourist destinations"" that he visits, and I think that this affords a more genuine view into what is truly interesting about the countries, cultures and people that he encounters along the way. You do start to feel as if you are really there with him. They are the sort of adventures - off the tour bus - I strive for when I travel abroad. Great fun.

3036459,3,B000YXMM9U,"I loved Round the World, Full Circle and Pole to Pole. This series lacked the energy, humor and spark of those aforenamed shows. Palin is still emminently likeable and has a great eye for the off-beat and off the beaten track. But at the same time his age is showing and he just doesn't have the quick wit and ready sense of humor he once had in the earlier series. Not that I blame him. Travel is tiring, especially marathon traveling of the type he does.

Regardless, ""New Europe"" was engaging and held my interest throughout. I questioned a little bit the choice to go to Turkey which was never an East Bloc nation--and also the least interesting part of his journey. And the series felt a little rushed at the end in eastern Germany. That said, I was very glad Palin included the former East Germany in his journey. Also interesting was his visit to a Stasi museum and Cauceascu's obscene palace in Bucharest.

One other criticism is that Palin in looking for the off beat went for the purient just a tad, including a cross dressing performer and a burlesque show. Not attacking people for their lifestyle choices, it's just not what I'm looking for in this type of programming. Nor is it what I would consider indicative of the culture like so many other unusual people or places Palin often found in this series and his earlier ones. But it's a niggling complaint.

Overall worth the price, though I have to say I'm not sure it would lend itself to multiple viewings like his earlier DVDs did.",1327536000,2,1499,4.544444444444444

In this series Michael Palin explores old Soviet Bloc countries including the former Yugoslavia, Romania, Hungary and the Ukraine amongst others.  He makes a great tour guide because he's genuinely interested in meeting the people and understanding the traditions in each country.  It's also beautifully shot and the scenery is amazing.  Made me want to visit these places myself.  Even my 17 year old son who never watches TV enjoyed this show.

8234363,5,B000YXMM9U,"This series first aired in 2007. It's called ""New Europe"" because several of the countries visited were new at the time. Yugoslavia, for example, had split. Czechoslovakia had split. And Germany had joined together. I think these are all the countries visited: Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia, Serbia, Albania, Macedonia, Moldava, Romania, Hungary, Ukraine, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, Czech Republic, and the part of Germany that was once East Germany. Countries that weren't new were newly opened, the Cold War having ended not that long before. There's also Transdniester, a part of Moldava which wants to be part of Ukraine, and the Kaliningrad Oblast, which is a little part of the Soviet Union that might just be part of Germany.

Maybe you get confused like me, but Moldava is the country; Moldavia is a region of Romania. Macedonia is a section of Greece, and to insure which is which, the country of Macedonia is officially called the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.

It would be too lengthy to list all the interesting facts, humor and history and information in this series, but I'll list some of my favorite sections. In addition, please don't forget to watch the Bonus Extra Deleted Scenes and Extended Scenes. They total a lot of time and add even more history and information. You won't want to miss them.

I was fascinated by the visuals of the White Brotherhood, a religion founded in 1897 of which I'd never heard. Every summer solstice, they gather in a mountain clearing in Bulgaria. There, participants dressed in white, they form giant circles and worship with paneurythmic dancing.

In Hungary, among other things, Palin was able to watch the great Lajos Kassai. Kassai is an expert on horseback racing, ""a skill perfected by the armies of Attila the Hun."" Hungary also has the awesome Hungarian gray cattle. The narrow wide horns of favorites may be tipped in gold.

Don't miss when Palin tries hirudotherapy!  And you'll have to watch to find out what is the terror of 60 Andrassy Street in Budapest.

The episodes total 413 minutes of enlightening and interesting viewing. If you buy ""New Europe"" on disc, subtitles are available in English SDH, Polish and Russian. Subtitles are available on the Bonus Extra's too:
...A... ""Michael Palin Interview"" (2006, two parts totaling 26 minutes)
...B... ""Deleted Scenes"" for all episodes (132 minutes total) Mostly, it looks like these were sequences which had to be cut for lack of time. Think of them as a free extra episode. For example, in what was once East Germany, Palin met Hans Zimmerman. He was guilty of environmental activism and he has a copy of the Stasi files on him, which total 3,228 pages.

Michael Palin's travel series, including ""New Europe, have been collected in a great set, which I highly recommend,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Michael-Palin-Collection-New-Europe-Around-the-World-in-80-Days-Sahara-Hemingway-Adventure-Great-Railway-Journeys-Himalaya-Pole-to-Pole-Full-Circle/dp/B001B3LIQA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Michael Palin Collection (New Europe / Around the World in 80 Days / Sahara / Hemingway Adventure / Great Railway Journeys / Himalaya / Pole to Pole / Full Circle)</a>.

8234370,5,B000YXMM9U,"Although New Europe does not have the same ""energy"" as Around the World, Full Circle and Pole to Pole, this is still a must see for all Palin fans. I thoroughly enjoyed this series and would recommend.",1402963200,,201,4.45945945945946
8234371,4,B000YXMM9U,"This is Palin on the road in a more relaxed mode; not the stunt travel of Around the World and Pole to Pole, which undoubtedly pushed our peripatetic narrator to his limits. This is a leisurely amble through eastern Europe and parts of the old Soviet Union. Meeting interesting people, learning about the cultures, seeing the sights, occasionally doing silly Palinesque things. It's an entertaining travelogue that Palin's fans will not want to miss.",1384300800,,450,5.094594594594595

y economically depressed Albania , to places like Romania etc. This looks pretty good although it was a hd show , I don't of any way to see it in hd in America.  But if you see it on dvd  , you at least have a clear picture.  This is worth watching and you get to see some places that are off the beaten path in this series.",1377993600,,484,3.9690721649484537
