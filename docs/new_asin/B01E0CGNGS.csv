7729848,5,B01E0CGNGS,"If you search on Amazon under the name Jack Irish in the DVD section you will find one marked set 1 and another marked Series 1. This may be a bit confusing, so Ill explain that first. In 2013 the commercial Australian Broadcasting Company broadcast a series of TV feature length films based on the Jack Irish novels by Peter Temple. Acorn released these a few years ago as Sets. In 2015 the ABC commissioned a new series based on the Jack Irish character and with the same cast but three different directors. The series consisted of 6 episodes  varying from 56 to 64 minutes each, with one main story line. This is what the product you are looking at is. Its called Season One.

While I liked the shorter films, I really liked this series too. I found it worked on many levels. There is international intrigue here (thats not a spoiler) as well as a story about relationships (some successful, others failed), and some really funny moments (Ill just say the three old guys in the bar). Honestly I didn't really care who did it? but loved the characters. It does have graphic violence and graphic language but no nudity.

I will suggest, however that  even though this is Season  1, you might want to start with the earlier sets before heading directly to this series. There are characters who appear here who have a history with the lead character but the connection is never revealed. And, even the opening minutes need some background history. Its been a few years since I watched the sets and I was confused some of the time.

This is a mystery and so  the less you know about even the basic plot the better. For some reason, Acorn likes to give you a synopsis of each episode before you get to watch it. The synopses give away a lot of what will happen and Ill suggest that you skip right by them. They don't recap the story till that point; they tell you what you will see. Im not deducting any stars for this; just suggesting that you skip over these

The DVD has two bonuses: A Photo gallery (I never find those interesting) and a 10 minute behind the scenes featurette with interviews with the major cast members.

Guy Pearce, who plays Jack, is great! He really gets into the part (and gets beat up a lot  thats not a spoiler, thats just what always happens to him). Marta Dusseldorp (who I just enjoyed in another Acorn series  Janet King  is great too as her character leaves Australia for (I won't reveal) and finds her life changed.

So, in summary, if you have seen the other Jack DVDs, go for this one. If you havent, try the others first to understand Jacks background and relationship with recurring characters. And I continue to urge you to be careful of reviews of mysteries which give away too much. There is a reason they are called mysteries

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

7729849,5,B01E0CGNGS,"An excellent crime show where the main, not so innocent, characters are not cops. Jack (Guy Pearce Kings Speech) is not even a PI but a debt collector, carpenter, and guy repeatedly in the wrong place. His lover, a journalist, Linda (Marta Dusseldorp A Place to Call Home) takes a bigger role in this miniseries. Both have a story-plot in different countries. 6 episodes create a story with 3 plots plus other threads that all realistically come together in the end. Many great performances combine to keep viewers spell-bound. I loved the comic pub boys scenes as well as the horse track boys segments. Humor, drama, horror, action, well, it has it all, even off/on/off romance.

Differences from the 2012 & 2014 Jack Irish include this being a 5  hr miniseries rather than feature length stories. Also the story Blind Faith is based on characters by Peter Temple, but he did not write a novel by that name where the earlier 3 stories each covered a crime novel. The writing is super, real, complex. Many important characters return with John Flaus, Ronald Falk, and Terry Norris at the pub; pub owner (Damien Garvey) has his own cyber-date comic thread; Harry (Roy Billing) & Cam (Aaron Pedersen) adding more humor with a horse. Copo Barry (Shane Jacobson) is back . . . well, its a series reunion for sure.

SDH SUBTITLES for feature and bonus.
== 1 ==Jack/Linda relationship is interrupted due to her new Manila job-not so good. A witness to a Philippine is kidnapped upon returning to Australia. Harry & Cam con Jack into owning a race horse (plot C).

== 3 ==Jack & Sarah visit her Senator dad (John Bach) for clues. Lindas investigating a Manila bank.

== 5 ==Jacks hospital recovery gets Linda returning to Melbourne. They begin to see their misadventures are connected.
== 6 ==Who will catch Jack firstcops or happy-clapping phony church leaders? A tense thriller finale.

7729858,5,B01E0CGNGS,"""Jack Irish: Blind Faith"" is an Australian television series that first aired in six 50-minute episodes in 2016, following three earlier ""Jack Irish"" television movies in 2012 and 2014. I wasn't impressed by the movies, but I found the series to be a big improvement. The movies and characters are based on novels by Peter Temple. The series is not based on a novel, but Peter Temple is credited as a co-writer at the bottom of the list, so his input was probably minimal. Unfortunately, it is necessary to see the earlier movies or at least the first one- to understand the characters' situations. Most of the cast returned for the series. Vadim Glowna, who played cabinetmaker Charlie Taub, died in 2012 and has been replaced. I think the reason I liked the series so much better than the movies is that the relationships are more plausible, and it doesn't have as many plot holes or rely on implausible behavior. The signature corruption-by-public-officials is still there but not central to the plot.

Jack Irish (Guy Pearce), a former defense attorney who quit the business for a life of debt-collecting and horse-betting after his wife was murdered, is contacted by Travis Dilthey (Jeremy Stanford), who wants to find his brother Wayne and will pay $350 an hour plus expenses. Jack tracks Wayne down but realizes too late that he has been set up and framed for murder. Wayne's girlfriend Janene Ballich (Peta Brady) takes off with Jack's vintage Studebaker, and a woman Jack never met before, Sarah Longmore (Claudia Karvan), provides him with an alibi. Janene left a message on Sarah's machine implying that Jack might know something about Sarah's sister Tina (Brooke Satchwell), who went missing upon her return from the Philippines, where she worked for a charity run by ""The Way of the Cross"". Meanwhile, journalist Linda Hillier (Marta Dusseldorp) is in the Philippines working under difficult conditions, trying to interview Islamic militant leader Hadji Adhib (Osamah Sami).

The plot of the series is more intricate than those of the movies, as it is much longer. Linda and Jack's relationship is more friendly than romance now, which seems more plausible. Everyone else is in form: the three old men who spend all their waking hours at the bar, bartender Stan (Damien Garvey) looking for love on the internet, crack researcher Simone Bensten (Kate Atkinson) is an unhappy newlywed, police detective Barry Tregear (Shane Jacobson) eats a lot, and Jack's former law partner Drew Greer (Damien Richardson) is naively optimistic. Jack's partners at the race track, Harry Strang (Roy Billing) and Cam Delroy (Aaron Pedersen), provide some of the show's most memorable moments, and Cam habitually swoops in to save the day. There is more humor in this series than in the movies. The only element that seems wrong is Jack's appearance. He starts out so grimy that he could be mistaken for a homeless person. He even goes to a business meeting like that.",1506038400,,2961,4.97979797979798

Jack Irish is a complex character, a one time criminal lawyer, he is now sometimes a private investigator but mostly a debt collector.  He is not exactly a model citizen, and he has relationship troubles with his girlfriend Linda (Marta Dusseldorp) who has decided to take a job in Manila.  A murder of one of the people he is trying to collect from sends Jack into an situation that explodes into an international plot involving extremists in both the Muslim faith and the born-again Christians.  Well written this drama has moments of comedy, albeit dark comedy interspersed with breath taking action and unrelenting tension.  You laugh and gasp in the next breath as Jack navigates dire situations.  I don't want to tell too much of the story, as discovering it is part of the allure of the plot.  Based on the character from the crime novels of Peter Temple, Jack Irish is a character that holds your attention and makes the viewer wonder how on earth he is going to navigate the trouble that surrounds him.",1473379200,2,1127,4.661616161616162

7729895,5,B01E0CGNGS,"Australian author Peter Temple's series of detective novels about Jack Irish have been lighting up television screens since 2012, when the first two adaptations were broadcast.  An immediate hit, a third Jack Irish telefilm was broadcast in 2014.

Jack Irish is an emotionally wounded, borderline down-and-outer who had once been a successful lawyer but was professionally and personally derailed when his wife was murdered.  Guy Pearce, the star of the JACK IRISH series, brings just the right amount of world-weariness to his role to suggest a classic film noir protagonist.  The supporting cast, including Marta Dusseldorp as Jack's on again-off again love interest, Linda (who also stars in two other Autralian series--JANET KING and A PLACE TO CALL HOME) are just as compelling in their own way and the show is as much a series of character studies as it is a detective show.

Now we have JACK IRISH Season 1: BLIND FAITH, the most recent addition to the JACK IRISH canon, which is a six-part mini-series, a format that serves the story well.  While not based on one of the JACK IRISH novels, it is as faithful to the original characters as die-hard fans might want it to be.  With the increased running time, multiple story-lines can converge and develop without seeming rushed.  Given that one of the story arcs focuses on religious extremism, (both Christian and Muslim) it is wise the makers of JACK IRISH recognized they needed a larger canvas to fairly examine the inherently sensitive issues.  While it is common these days for people of faith to be portrayed negatively in film and television programs, it is encouraging to see some balance achieved amidst the accusations.  Case in point: there is a scene in JACK IRISH--once we've established that a ""mega-church"" is behind a series of murders and other misdeeds--in which a character points out, while sitting in a soup kitchen, ""That fellow there runs this place.  He makes $40,000 a year and gives most of it away.  He's doing what the others SHOULD be doing.""  (I paraphrase, but the gist is clear).  One can only appreciate such fairness.  It is a breath of fresh air, really.  Of course, the principle characters are shown specifically to be non-believers, another annoying trend that needs to be addressed in this writer's opinion, but it's a start.

JACK IRISH is notable too for being about people who are older, from forty-somethings, like Irish, to a substantial cast of older, even elderly, characters.  The regulars who haunt the bar Irish might call his second home are a great bunch of old codgers.  And Irish's furniture-making mentor, an old master by the name of Charlie, whose infinite patience with Irish gives him the much-needed respite he occasionally needs from his problems, is a true rarity on television today.  Interestingly, Charlie was portrayed in the first two JACK IRISH films by German actor Vadim Glowna, who passed away before the third film was made.  The role is re-cast for the mini-series and features an actor named David Ritchie--who also passed away not long after the mini-series wrapped.  Is the role of Charlie cursed?  Only time will tell...

While it is not yet known whether there will be more JACK IRISH films/mini-series produced, it's a pretty good bet that there will be.  The show is extremely well produced, brilliantly acted, with quirky humour, troubled romance and a world-view that, while sometimes cynical and dark, like the best of film noir, is ultimately life-affirming.  Jack is a classic underdog and we want him to succeed, to get his life back together, to rekindle his romance with Linda (Dusseldorp's character).

How many characters on television today do we truly care about?  Jack Irish is one of them.",1470960000,,3739,4.967845659163987
7729896,5,B01E0CGNGS,"Jack Irish: Season 1. In this topnotch Australian television series,  a noir crime drama if ever there was one, Emmy-winning Guy Pearce, (MEMENTO, L.A. CONFIDENTIAL, IRON MAN 3) returns as Jack Irish,  charismatic, brooding anti-hero, former criminal lawyer whose world imploded at his wifes unsolved murder.  As created by outstanding Aussie crime novelist Peter Temple, Irish now spends his days as a part-time investigator, debt collector, apprentice cabinet maker, punter, sometime lover.  Irishs Melbourne world revolves around the racetrack, the local pub, the artisan woodwork shop where hes apprenticed himself to a master craftsman. But its in his investigative work, often small jobs that snowball into larger, more dangerous ones that Jack is set on paths he doggedly pursues.

An Australian aid-worker is kidnapped by Muslim extremists; East is pitted against West, crescent against cross in this savvy thriller. From the island of Mindanao, in the Philippines to Melbourne, Irish is caught in a global web of religious zealotry: right wing Christians, media-savvy jihadists.  At the same time, Jacks on-again, off-again girlfriend, journalist Linda Hillier (Marta Dusseldorp, A PLACE TO CALL HOME, JANET KING), leaves Melbourne for Manila to further her career as a foreign correspondent. The job is not exactly what she had planned, but Linda quickly realizes she may yet be on to a big story. Their cases eventually intertwine; however, Jack and Lindas reunion is tested by the arrival in the detectives life of Sarah Longmore (Claudia Karvan, THE SECRET LIFE OF US), metal sculptor with connections.

This series differs from the 2012 and  2014 Jack Irish series in that it is a 5  hour miniseries rather than separate feature length productions. In addition, BLIND FAITH is based simply on characters created by Peter Temple, not on any specific crime novel of his. The earlier three shows were. Temple has been called ""a terrific writer: sharp, funny and ambitious"" by NPRs Fresh Air from WHYY; he has won the Ned Kelly Award five times , the Crime Writers Association Duncan Laurie Dagger Award for best crime novel. The episodes are:

Episode 1. Tina, the only witness to a massacre in the Philippines returns to Australia; she is kidnapped  shortly after sending a cryptic text to her friend, Janene. Jack is employed to find Janene's boyfriend.  Linda's new journalism job in Manila, the Philippines, is off to a rough start.
Episode 2. Jack tracks down the woman who gave him an alibi; Sarah turns out to be Tinas sister. They are daughters of the Attorney General. Barry faces suspension pending an investigation because of his connections to Jack.  Jack asks an increasingly frustrated Linda to help find whoever  deposited  money into his account.
Episode 3. Jack convinces his lawyer to give him the name of the witness against him, as he continues the search for his accuser. Jack and Sarah visit her father, the attorney general, to get more information about Tina. In Manila, Orton notices Linda's investigation into a bank.
Episode 4. Linda and Orton stumble upon the village ruined during the massacre, but are forced to flee when violence erupts. Tina's body is found; Jack and Sarah attend Tina's funeral service at the Way of the Cross.
Episode 5. Jack recuperates following the bomb blast at Sarah's workshop; Harry decides to move the horse to Jack's courtyard. Linda rushes back to Melbourne to see Jack; their reunion is not a happy one.
Episode 6. Jack finds himself in the frame for Pastor Rob's murder, despite Barry's efforts to buy him time.  Harry has Jack stay with him as he is concerned about the way in which Jacks arrest might affect the upcoming big horse race. Back in Manila, Linda finally gets her interview, in  hostile circumstances.

The box set, which I received in expectation of an honest, unbiased revue, consists of two discs containing six episodes, for approximately 346 minutes.  As bonuses, it offers ten minutes of behind the scenes featurettes and a photo gallery.  And, thank goodness, subtitles, for those of us not up on our Down Under speak. It contains violence, strong language and sexual situations for those of us discomforted by those sorts of things. It is a cinematic noir that features  romance, exotic suspense, complex narrative with dark humor in the tales spun at the pub and the race track. Memorable characters, outstanding performances as it gives us a longer more complex Jack Irish/Linda Hillier story than weve ever had before. As binge-worthy as anything weve ever watched. You don't want to miss it.

Guy Pearce plays Jack as vulnerable and a bit befuddled.  Very endearing.  I want more!",1524182400,,363,4.666666666666667
