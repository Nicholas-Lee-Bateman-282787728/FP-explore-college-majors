Thanks for bringing us that wonderful DVD ""Principles of Swingtime"". In today's day and age, when we're surrounded by information everywhere, this one not only stands out but is also unique, useful, and informative in a very practical, matter of fact way...congratulations!!! All your time and research is really appreciated by this drummer, with a library of easily sixty plus DVD's. I highly recommend all serious players pick up a copy this guy, they'll love it for sure!

Just a few comments on what I found to be particularly appealing on this instructional video. Firstly, I liked the raw footage at the beginning demoing hand and foot technique,
keeping it simple, there's a challenge in itself. A phrase you used ""make the stroke and get out of the way"" is a good key reminder. You cut right to the chase without a lot of high tech mixing, camera work and sound control. I don't have the luxury of a sound studio, so that's what my drums sound like when I'm practicing.  I also liked your reference to Ted Reed's  book and ""singing the drum figures"" I think this is also key.
The real bonus, of course, is your footage on the Royal Crown Revue with your narrative
along with a drummers view of your treatment of the drum parts and rhythmic approach to all the tunes...really, really neat! I liked the personal stuff as well along with the brief history of ""swing"" as well!

Thanks again Daniel...keep it coming!

The dvd is poorly recorded, short and too ""obvious"". Furthermore, it doesn't really bring a light in any subject about swing music. Daniel only shows a couple of things and does it ""his way"".
Don't buy this dvd if you want to learn about swing drumming, or ""swing style""...
And, my advise, if you are a Royal Crown Revue fan, DON'T BUY IT EITHER, because you'll feel stupid as I did after paying the bucks for a dvd that should be a ""free download"" on Daniel's website.
And please don't get me wrong, I'm sure Daniel can and know swing, I'm just upset he didn't do neither on this dvd...",1216252800,,782,4.29054054054054
