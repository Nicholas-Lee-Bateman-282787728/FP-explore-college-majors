7420925,3,B014TC60LC,"As a fan of the first movie, I was excited for a continuation of the story. However, that's all this movie proved to be a continuation and nothing more. Don't repeat my mistake by seeing this movie and expecting it to be better or as good as it's predecessor, you'll be in for a disappointment!
I'll probably by this movie when it comes out, cause my daughter (age 2) really enjoys this type of animation, but I'll wait for it to be around the 11 dollar price range.",1443225600,3,466,4.306818181818182

7420927,5,B014TC60LC,"I have to admit, I was looking forward to seeing Hotel Transylvania 2 ever since I first heard that they were doing it.  And the film definitely does not disappoint.  Which is not surprising as they had the same creative team and talent behind this new movie as they did behind the original.  Directed by Genndy Tartakovsky (Hotel Transylvania, Star Wars: Clone Wars, Samurai Jack) from a screenplay by Adam Sandler and Robert Smigel (You Don't Mess with the Zohan, Saturday Night Live), Hotel Transylvania 2 is a seamless follow up to its predecessor with everything, including the animation, taken up a notch.

A couple of years have passed since we first saw the Hotel Transylvania when Dracula (Adam Sandler), who had built the hotel as a kind of secret sanctuary where monsters could periodically escape to to get away from the much dreaded humans, had to deal first with the crisis of the hotel's discovery by a genially goofy human backpacker named Jonathan (Andy Samberg), and then with the much bigger crisis of Jonathan meeting his teenage daughter Mavis (Selena Gomez) and the two of them immediately ""zinging"" (also known as love at first sight).  But things worked out and, as we see in the film's beginning, Jonathan and Mavis get married, nature (human and vampire) takes its course, and Dracula is now a doting grand-dad, to Jonathan and Mavis' adorable toddler Dennis (Asher Blinkoff).  With the delight of course being shared by Mavis' extended monster family:  Frankenstein (Kevin James) and his Franken-wife Eunice (Fran Drescher), buttoned-down wolfman Wayne (Steve Buscemi) and his were-spouse Wanda (Molly Shannon) and their feral pack of were-kids, the invisible man Griffin (David Spade) and the mummy-with-the-most Murray (this time voiced by Keegan-Michael Key).

But of course there has to be a crisis, and this time it comes in twin worries for the Count.  The first worry is that Dennis, who's supposed to be half-vampire after all, is showing no signs of becoming a vampire, much to Drac's chagrin and embarrassment. But the second worry hits even harder:  Mavis feels that the hotel, much as she loves it, is not a safe place for a human child to be raised and is talking about leaving so that she and Jonathan can raise Dennis in a safer environment. Unable to bear the thought of not having his beloved daughter and grandson around, Dracula and his buddies have to find a way to get Dennis's latent vampire-ness to emerge before Mavis makes the final decision for the family to move.

While there is a certain predictability to a lot of the situations that arise, Tartakovsky deals with it smartly by keeping things moving and focusing on how the characters deal with things, each in their own distinctly individual way, and the fun lies in watching how things play out. There's a lot of affection for these characters not only in the way they're written in the script but also in the way they're given life by the animators and by the voice actors playing them, and that is what really drives the film and makes it fun for everyone.

With the exception of Murray, originally voiced by CeeLo Green, pretty much all of the voice actors from the first movie are back in their familiar roles, doing a superb job of bringing the Hotel characters to life. One notable change though is that Jon Lovitz, who voiced the hotel's hunchback chef Quasimodo Wilson in the first film, is this time the voice of the Phantom of the Opera, now apparently employed as the hotel's lounge singer. Among the new characters and voices is Dana Carvey as Dana, the safety-first feelings-are-good vampire camp counselor, though the hands down stand-out is Mel Brooks, perfectly cast as Dracula's dad, the crotchety cantankerous Vlad.  And like I said earlier, the animation, which was already pretty good in the first film, appears to have been taken up a notch in this new one, with added levels of detail and texture that really give depth to the settings and the characters.  This is definitely the kind of movie you want to get the DVD for so that you can go back and catch all of the little throw-away details and references that have been worked into it.

Also returning is Mark Mothersbaugh (Hotel Transylvania, Pitch Perfect 2, The Lego Movie) to provide the musical score which nicely adds to the overall feeling of the animation and the character interactions playing out on the screen.

My one real quibble with the movie is that the story doesn't flow as smoothly as it did in the first film. The first two-thirds of Hotel Transylvania 2 seem a bit choppy by comparison, jumping rather than flowing  from scene to scene, which made it hard for the film to build up momentum. But that said, when things do get going they get going in a big way, and the payoff when it comes delivers in highly satisfying ways on every level, making it all worthwhile.

The DVD details don't indicate what, if any, the extras will be, but I'm hoping they'll include a featurette I saw with the film's production designer Michael Kurinsky where he gives some background on what went into the animation and the design, which is quite interesting and gives you an idea of the level of thought required to pull off the things you see in the movie.

Highly, highly recommended for anyone who loves animation, family comedy and classic movie-monster riffs.",1443139200,70,5352,4.797826086956522

7420945,5,B014TC60LC,"IMO this is the best of the three HT movies.  It has enough adult humor and poking fun of modern and family life to keep adults entertained, while not being inappropriate or scary for youngsters.  IMO the first movie was boring and the new one, well, I'll wait to review that when it gets released.  The kids also thought it was very funny.  Great movie for the parent of small children and great for Halloween.  I usually can't stand Adam Sandler either, but he is bearable in these movies, even quite funny at times as he was when he first began his comedy career.",1533600000,,566,4.403846153846154

7421032,4,B014TC60LC,"This movie is a great example of generation influence on the next. In the Film, Mavis and Johnny are newlyweds who just had a child. It is difficult enough to be new parents but it's worse when you have both sides of the families telling you how to raise your child. Both Mavis and Johnny just wanted to be happy and let their child grow up in whichever environment he wanted to, whether it was with the humans or with the monsters. They were two type of families with different customs and practices and a child who was in between both. At the end, the families were able to put all their opinions and differences aside for the love of the child.",1512604800,,647,4.311475409836065

7421056,5,B014TC60LC,"As a Christian family, we do not celebrate Halloween and other holidays unrelated to God. This movie was on our 'no' list ...and I feel rather foolish for having it be on that list. I just watched it alone and did NOT stop laughing. We then watched it as a family and kids were loving it just as much as the adults. It is not the monster aspect that concerns my family, it's the values and purpose. This movie is about family, love, being different AND important... being friends with lots of people  (aka monsters and humans)... just all around good social skills. Jokes, while a bit adult like, were rather tactful. I am so proud of the cast who created this tale as it's just a genuine love for family, forgiveness and being yourself. Wish I could hug the crew who created this. Will likely buy on DVD!",1502928000,,805,4.402684563758389

7421076,1,B014TC60LC,"I just saw this terrible movie on Netflix. To me, it is definitely not appropriate for children. On more than one scene 666 is seen in the movie. Why? Why would anyone want their child to see that. It is inappropriate for a child's movie! And second, the grandfather carrying the child up a rickety tower only to throw the child off. Third the great grandfather pretty much making a reference to possessing his great grandsons favorite puppet show, then the puppet starts spewing out cakes. Gee, I wonder where they got that from. The great grandfather was trying to scare his great grandson, so that he would grow his fangs. Seriously, if you let your kids watch this garbage, you might as well
1. Be desensitizing the kid.
2. Then there is reference to well, let's just say human and animals being together.
3. Or if you're gonna let the kid watch this movie, you might as well, let the kid watch the exocist too.

This is my view of this garbage movie.",1497139200,2,955,4.488505747126437

UPDATE: I really liked it!!!! There was a couple cheesy parts and I love the first soundtrack WAY better. And I seriously can NOT stand one of the ugly bats voice towards the end of the movie.

There are some pretty humorous scenes here (a revival of the infamous ""I don't say bleh, bleh, bleh"" exchange, and some semi-realistic-but-funny pregnancy references).

Mavis gets to explore more outside Hotel/Castle walls, and Drac faces off with his own unaccepting father (Mel Books).

7421434,4,B014TC60LC,"I didn't mind this sequel, for the most part it was quite good, I quite liked the invisible man having an invisible girlfriend, that the other monsters don't believe actually exists joke for one.  The monsters in this one are more comparable to parents/grandparents who have become a little bit uncool and out of the social loop of their kids generation with a road trip where Dracula (who can't really use a mobile phone to communicate with his daughter) is trying to make his grandson into a real man (or vampire as is the case here).  The other monsters have told him that if the kid doesn't grow his fangs before his fast approaching fifth birthday, he never will, so hence he isn't a vampire.  Of course Dracula insists, he's just a late bloomer.

I did think the ending was a bit weak and contradicted the whole up to then looked like being an accept people (especially your kids and grand kids) for who they are and not who you want them to be message.  Spoilers - It would have been way cooler if he had remained a human (at least until the threat was over) and he'd saved the day as a human, possibly in a way a vampire couldn't.  Then Dracula accepting him and being proud of him anyway.  Maybe just before the credits rolled he could have sprouted teeth and winked at the camera or something if need be for the next sequel or whatever.",1474675200,,1346,4.403225806451613

7421447,5,B014TC60LC,"Just got back from seeing it in theaters, and let me tell you, there were several moments when just the kids would laugh, and moments when just the adults would laugh, and even moments when everybody laughed.
This is coming from a guy who doesn't watch a lot of ""kid"" movies, and I can tell Adam Sandler wanted more than just kids to enjoy it, so he threw in child-raising jokes, nipple jokes, and a few other jokes and themes that go right over your average kid's head. And of course there's silliness plentiful for the kiddies to enjoy.
If you're reading reviews, you should already be familiar with the plot, which in a nutshell for those who aren't, is basically the two kids from the first one are older and married and have a kid, who the grandfather, Count Dracula, hopes is a Dracula/monster like his own bloodline, but it doesn't seem to be the case. So family relationships are slightly strained in this movie as Dracula wonders if he'll be helping to raise his vampire grandson, or watching his human grandson and human son-in-law and vampire daughter move away and leaving him behind alone in his hotel, to go live with *gasp* HUMANS.
So on top of it being hilarious for everybody, there's a lot more to it as well. Obviously if you're a fan of the first Hotel Transylvania, it's a guarantee you'll enjoy this sequel. The style of animation is exaggerated, highly sporadic, like a human gas molecule with ADHD and an IV inserted coffee bag. There is a lot going on in almost every scene, and with the characters behaving so hyper, it may take a couple viewings to take in all in. The humor is quick, very in your face, but welcoming. And trust me, humor is a-plenty.
There are a few minor flaws; while tailored to two separate audiences, obviously there will be moments where one side will feel out of place. Either a child will cock their head to the side in puzzlement and maybe laugh but only because the adults are, or an adult will think to themselves ""well that was just weird."" And yes it's mostly a kid's movie so much of everything is easy to swallow.
Go see it, even if you don't have kids, it's a fun, easy-going flick that's sure to make you jiggle with joy like Blobby. The characters are fun and diverse as before, humor is constant, and for those sticklers out there (you know who you are), the plot exists and it flows sufficiently enough to follow, and at a reasonable pace. So bust out your popcorn and brain juice, and enjoy this light-hearted comedy.",1474243200,4,2482,4.505543237250555

7421631,2,B014TC60LC,"Hotel Transylvania 2

  (WARNING! Spoilers are contained in the following!)

Plot: A couple of years after the events of the first Hotel Transylvania, Mavis and Jonathan have married, and had a son named Dennis. But in Papa Dracs eyes, Mavis is still his little girl.
  As Dennis grows older, his family begins to wonder if hes even a monster! For one thing, he has an un-vampire crop of curly red hair. And he has yet to sprout his fangs.
  Dracula insists that he is late fanger, and he insists that hell soon be a true vampire.
But Mavis feels that the Hotel is too dangerous for a human to live there. She and Jonathan decide to move to California where he grew up.
  Dracula, however, does not Mavis to go away. He comes up with a plan with all his monster friends: Teach Dennis how to be a proper monster. When Mavis sees her vampire son, surely shell change her mind about moving!

  The Seven Questions.

1. Is it funny?
Like the first movie, Hotel Transylvania 2 is one of those Single-Purpose movies. In this case, the goal is to keep the audience laughing. This means youll find a wide range of gags in this movie. Slapstick, Wisecracks...Toilet humor, etc, etc, etc.
  Ill admit, some of the jokes were genuinely funny, such as Dracula struggling with the mysteries of technology. There are even references to Phantom of the Opera and Sesame Street!
  But because the movie puts so much effort into being funny, everything else (animation, acting, music and, most importantly, story) is lacking in quality.

2. Is it romantic?
Mavis and Jonathan are married, as you know. There are some lovey-dovey moments between them where they exchange overly-cliched lines such as: Youre perfect the way you are!
  All the rest of their dialogue consists of Mavis worrying about Dennis and Jonathan insisting: Hes fine! That is not romantic.

3. Is it thrilling?
Over the years, thanks to modern conveniences seeping into Transylvania, all the monsters have become so...domesticated.
  When Dracula insists that his buddies show Dennis how to be a monster (by killing a deer, conjuring up a sandstorm, and so on) they fail.
  To make it worse, when they do make an effort to scare humans, the humans  are either indifferent, or starstruck (starstruck? By Frankensteins monster?! Give me a break!!)
  Most of the film focuses on Draculas unexciting attempts to vampirize his grandson.
But in a final attempt to be exciting, the filmmakers threw in a completely random human-hating bat villain. The battle that ensues becomes predictable within thirty seconds. Why couldn't they cut out the villain and make the movie 20 minutes shorter?
  In short? No, this movie is not thrilling.

4. Is it heartwarming?
There are moments that couldve been heartwarming, such as the birth of Dennis. Unfortunately, even these moments don't hit the mark because of all the humor.

5. Is there anything else I liked?
Unlike the last film, Hotel Transylvania doesnt rely so heavily on the potty humor.

6. Is there any negative elements?
If I were pick a word that summed up everything wrong with Hotel Transylvania,  it would be: Juvenile.
All the characters in the movie act like a bunch of whiny, clinging, immature kids. Even Mavis, the most mature monster in the bunch, goes crazy over pinatas and slurpees.
  Then theres also the films theme, which appears to be: Accept one anothers differences.
Everyone in Denniss family (with the exception of Drac) believes hes all-human. At first, Drac seemed okay with it.
  But then Mavis says shes thinking about moving. And Drac is still not ready to let his daughter grow up (Let her go already!!) Once again, his desire to keep his baby-girl home leads him to make some pretty poor choices. Including trying to make Dennis something hes not.
  Finally a furious Mavis orders her dad to lay off! Let him be a human! Then she starts packing.
Now Drac finally realizes that he shouldve listened to his friends.
  Then...during the battle with the random villain, Dennis suddenly develops vampire powers!
Now Mavis can stay, because it turns out he is a vampire. Hooray!
  While the Accept one anothers differences is a good message, it doesnt work because Dennis isn't different.
  The real theme seems to be: Those who seem different will soon reveal that they're not. Just be patient! Real inspiring, isn't it?

Theres also the annoying idea that Women can do anything better than men. This is a specially true in Mavis. Shes more a better parent than her husband. Shes a better biker than he is, and so on.

One last thing. The acting sounds very half-hearted, almost if the actors wanted to be somewhere else. Even Steve Buscemi, who plays Wayne the Werewolf. He sounded much better as Randall in the Monsters Inc movies.

7. Would I recommend this film?
No. There are worse films than Hotel Transylvania 2, but there are also much better films.",1469145600,,4878,4.797118847539015

7421679,4,B014TC60LC,"Back in 2012 when Sony, under Genndy Tartakovskys direction, released the star-studded monster comedy Hotel Transylvania upon the world, it seemed like a simple formula for success.  In fact thats exactly what it turned out to be, turning its 85-million dollar budget into $358.4-million at the box office alone.  Most importantly, perhaps, is that those kind of profits assure beyond any shadow of a doubt that sequels will follow.

And follow they have- in September of 2015 Hotel Transylvania 2 was released once again under Tartakovskys directorial efforts only this time leading voice actor Adam Sandler co-wrote the script to insure maximum laughs.  The budget was $80-mil (rare that a sequel to so successful a debut would have a smaller budget) and the film managed to collect a cool $473-million at the box office this time.  Less money to produce and even larger profits mean you can bet your high-collared cape this isn't the last well be hearing from Hotel Trans.

The story in Hotel Transylvania 2 doesnt bother treading old territory but rather picks up with events just as we left them at the conclusion of the first movie:  Dracs (Sandler) daughter Mavis (Selena Gomez) ties the knot with dopey human suitor Jonathan (Andy Samberg) and a wedding at the hotel means human guests amongst monsters.  -You may remember from the first film that even a single human was a terrifying prospect for the monsters.

From the gags of such intermingling, the viewer is quickly whisked along lifes highway as the couple announce they're pregnancy, have a baby boy, and discover a bit of trouble when the lad (Dennis) doesnt seem to be following in the familys vampiric traditions.  Could he be just a late fanger? Could Drac (and his even nastier father Vlad voiced by Mel Brooks) love their grandson if he was more human than monster?  Will Mavis just give up on the whole hotel altogether and move to California with her in-laws so that Dennis can hope to grow up normally among humans?

These are just some of the sleep-depriving questions Hotel Transylvania 2 presents and if it all sounds a bit contrived, thats because it is.  Depth of plot or awards for best drama aren't the name of the game here but that doesnt mean there aren't a few laughs to be had with Steve Buscemi reprising his role as the Wolfman, Kevin James as Frankenstein, David Spade as the Invisible Man and even John Lovits as the Phantom of the Opera.  The jokes are new but the gags largely unchanged.

About the biggest problem I found with the piece is that its pacing is far from even.  In one sense its doing its best to offer up some heavy handed themes of individualism, political correctness, unconditional parental love and so on but then in another it sorts of dares its viewer to stop worrying about lessons and just laugh at the silliness.  This isn't an inexcusable crime by itself (after all, the kids will likely be enamored with the slapstick anyway), the bigger problem here is that the film attempts so much in its 89-minutes that certain things drag on unnecessarily while other touchstone moments (like marriage and childbirth) are glanced over at blink-and-you-missed-it speeds.  I suppose another way of saying it: the pacing in the first film is vastly more organized than how things come together in the second.

On the other hand, if you were the type of viewer who enjoyed the shtick of Drac being a bit overprotective (over-imposing?) of daughter Mavis in the first film, get ready for overload status in the second.  Thankfully for most of the movie Drac and Mavis aren't in the same locale, which provides many more opportunities for effects-laden monster mischief; the fire effects are particular have gotten to the point of photo-realism here.

All in all, Hotel Transylvania 2 is an enjoyable romp despite being slightly unsure of precisely how serious to take itself.  Fans of the original will likely find much to enjoy here.  The gags are pretty continuous and a few of them are funny enough to atone for some of the cornier ones.  By no means the film reinvent the CG medium but it builds upon many of the same elements that made the first film memorable.

Oh and that was no mere conjecture in my stating the sequels are a coming.  Part 3 is already in the works for a 2018 release and an animated television series is set to drop in early 2017.  Sonys been around long enough to know there is no sense fixing that which isn't broken.",1467849600,,4449,4.744155844155844

Hotel Transylvania 2 is about Dennis, the son of Mavis and Johnny.  Living and growing up at the hotel Dennis is viewed as a human more than anything.  Even Mavis wants to move to Santa Clara, where Johnny was raised and where his family still lives.

7422164,4,B014TC60LC,"Oddly enough, it was a trailer for ""Hotel Transylvania 2"" that led me to check out the original ""Hotel Transylvania.""  While the second movie looked like it would be cute and funny, I wanted to learn the backstory behind it first -- generally watching the sequel before the original movie is just a recipe for confusion.  And I thought the first movie was adorable and fun, and hoped the second would be just as enjoyable.  And while it does have a few problems (more on that later), it's still a great ride, both funny and heartwarming and with the always-timely message of accepting others despite their appearances.

After the events of ""Hotel Transylvania,"" laid-back slacker Johnny has married Mavis, the adorable daughter of Count Dracula himself, and the two of them now have a son, Dennis.  Dracula couldn't be happier to be a grandfather... except for the fact that Dennis has shown no signs of becoming a vampire.  When Johnny and Mavis plan to move away from the Hotel Transylvania so Dennis can be around normal humans, Drac panics, and he and his monster friends decide to take his grandson on a road trip to show him the joys of being a monster and to hopefully kick-start his inner vampire before his fifth birthday rolls around.  But Mavis isn't happy with her father's antics... and Vlad, Drac's traditionalist father, isn't happy with the idea of having humans in the family...

Like the first film, this film has colorful, stylized animation that keeps up a quick pace without ever feeling rushed or frantic.  It looks fantastic, though with a heavyweight like Genndy Tartakovsky (the man behind ""Samurai Jack"" and the 2D ""Clone Wars"" cartoons) at the helm, it's no wonder the film came out looking so great.  Traditional monsters are still recognizable but also maintain their own unique looks, and the human characters are stylized enough to avoid the uncanny valley without also looking grotesque or weird.

Most of the original voice cast has returned for this film, with the exception of CeeLo Green (Murray the mummy is now voiced by Keegan-Michael Key of ""Key and Peele,"" though I didn't notice a significant difference between the voices).  Even Jon Lovitz makes a reappearance despite Quasimodo vanishing between films (he's now the Phantom of the Opera), and Mel Brooks makes a hilarious cameo as Vlad, bringing his trademark snarky, crotchety-old-man humor to the film.

While the film is mostly just as fun and heartwarming as the original, this film, much like its predecessor, feels the need to throw in a villain for no apparent reason.  Not every film needs an antagonist, and this film's bad guy, a giant bat named Bela, feels out of place and forced in simply for the sake of having a human-hating villain.  We didn't necessarily need a villain or a climactic action scene to make this film work -- the first film worked just fine without a fight scene at the end (though it, too, had a villain tossed in simply for the sake of having a villain).

That beef aside, this film is still a sweet and funny ride through a world where humans and monsters live side by side, and an enjoyable romp with characters we've come to know and love.  Probably best for ages 8 and up due to some scary scenes and bathroom humor.",1461715200,,3249,4.762923351158645

I highly recommend downloading the movie in this manner especially if you have an IPad like I do because it is super easy to access but then you can also watch it from your television if you log onto your Amazon account.  The video application is easy to use and works well with all of my televisions.

I was extremely skeptical at the first Hotel Transylvania because Adam Sandler has honestly made some horrible films.  Yet he has made some truly great films as well, so that is why I keep giving him chances.  I am SO glad that I did because these Hotel Transylvania films are awesome!

Mr. Sandler, you nailed it with Hotel Transylvania 1 and 2.  I love that you're such a good and loyal friend by including them in your films, giving them genuinely fun roles.  I also love how you brought together some great musical talent to add an extra dimension to these films.  Bravo, sir!",1459296000,3,691,4.652892561983471

7422455,5,B014TC60LC,My family loved the 1st HT and we couldn't wait to see the second one. We enjoyed the purity of Jonathon and Mavis's relationship and how well Jonathon got along with Drac. The 2nd HT was just as good if not better than the 1st one. Mavis and Jonathon get married and then have little Dennis who is adorable. They go through all the normal things newly-weds go through with in-laws and starting a family. The struggle between being respectful of parents and trying to break away to raise children the way they think is right was something my wife and I could totally relate to. The monster themes are tastefully done and filled with very likable characters.,1459209600,,657,4.576271186440678

7422536,3,B014TC60LC,"This wasn't nearly as good as the first one - for a few reasons.

1) Totally cliche. the joking/humor wasn't nearly as funny, because it was much more predictable. Also, the previews showed all the best jokes first, so that kind of ruined it for me before I even saw it.

2) Completely predictable. Specifically, there were several ways the story could've gone, but only ONE way that it could have a happy ending - and that's exactly what happened.

For these reasons, I liked it, but it also wasn't the kind of movie I'd want to watch over and over. It was good, but not THAT good. 3 stars.",1459123200,,591,4.3545454545454545

The animation is top notch, the very talented voice actors did a great job, even the package is great but unfortunately the story just can't keep up.  Many of the scenes feel forced, unoriginal, lackluster and lacking in the comic genius that the writers packed so much of into the first movie.

However, the second one totally come in with a very delightfully fun script. I have watched the second one 30 times more than the first. Shame on the NYPost for rating this film a one star. I don't think people with no sense of humor or joy for life should write reviews. Trust me, you don't have to like the first one to love this one. Cheers!",1458172800,,493,4.25531914893617
7422638,5,B014TC60LC,"Now that Dracula (Adam Sandler) has opened the Hotel Transylvania's doors to humans, things are changing for the better; however, Drac is secretly worried that his half-human grandson, Dennis, isn't showing his vampire side. So, while Mavis and Johnny are away, Drac enlists his friends to help him put the boy through a ""monster-in-training"" boot camp. But things really get batty when Drac's cantankerous, old-school dad (Mel Brooks) pays an unexpected visit.

While I loved the first film, this one was much, much better.  It was alot more fun, humorous and more briskly paced& timed perfectly. I'll have to say, out of the two, this one has to be my favorite of the both. The characters seem a lot more fleshed out with personality than they were in the first film. I hope we see more of this franchise.",1458172800,,807,4.798561151079137

So here we go again with more straight-ahead comedy, family-oriented gothic  this one co-written by Adam Sandler, who once again voices Count Dracula  just in time for Halloween: staple TV and cinema fare from the days of the Addams Family and The Munsters.

In the first film, Dracula was perplexed to see a human guy show up at the hotel he runs for his fellow beasties, and even more bemused to see that his daughter Mavis was falling for him. Now they're married and having a baby. Will it be human or vampire? Will they live in Transylvania or at home in California? Dracula is now the lovably overbearing-adoring grandpa whose interfering causes wacky scrapes. A fangless sequel.",1457913600,,795,4.746376811594203

I think sometimes movie makers have a hard time with sequels but whomever wrote the script for this did an awesome job and I am looking forward to a third!  I almost wonder if it is the same person who wrote the story line for Shrek as the first, second were great However, if your child is sensitive to violence whatsoever you might want to stay clear of this for another year. There are a few parts towards the end that 5 and under or children sensitive to this type of show might find scary. My kids loved it!",1456185600,,575,4.18018018018018

7423120,3,B014TC60LC,Cute but not as good as the first one... I felt irritated at the daughter the whole time.  She took mothering to a whole new (extremely annoying) level.  Totally out of character for her in my opinion.  Liked the interactions with the other monsters and the human in laws though.  That part was good.,1456012800,,300,4.5
7423121,2,B014TC60LC,Well as this is an animated flick aimed largely at younger viewers I give it two stars. I saw the original HT and loved it. This one doesn't live up to the original and is very short. Thin story line-lots of silly gags. It seems as though the producers simply wanted to drain as much profit out of story as possible. The thing is I saw where they could have done quite a bit more with the story-but didn't. They were either in too much of a rush to get it out or simply didn't care because they knew it would make a profit regardless of what they slammed together. Kids will still love the show-for adults not so much.,1456012800,2,618,4.158333333333333

7423340,1,B014TC60LC,Yes it is me the bell curve buster. This is just another piece of rubbish that I chose not to see at a movie theater. All I need to see to judge a movie is less than 15 seconds to judge the quality. I would say this movie is total rubbish and is not worth paying fifty cents let alone full price to see it. Save yourself the expense and refuse to purchase schlock. This will force the movie studios to make a better product.,1455321600,,424,4.0

7423343,5,B014TC60LC,"Can't believe I enjoyed this sequel better than the original. One of the few children oriented movies I can stand multiple viewings of. A lot of 'in' jokes and side references touching upon some of the current pop culture happenings. Entertaining and very funny in spots. SPOILER alert: Has a moral lesson about differences and acceptance and some mild gross out humor. Nothing particularly scary, obscene or inappropriate for the younger viewers IMO. The few mildly off colored jokes are bound to go over the little ones heads. My favorite scenes are the camp scene (the camp director is the cutest 'oh, my devil' and when grand-pops (hilariously voiced by Mel Brooks) pays a visit. Recommended and can't wait for the 3rd installment.",1455321600,,735,4.983739837398374

7423492,5,B014TC60LC,"No spoilers, I promise! The second visit to Hotel Transylvania is fun & in the same spirit as the first. It's brings us back to another phase of life (or two?) for Mavi & Johnny that includes the whole crew in at least small doses &, interestingly, deals with issues like the foibles of modern parenting & even the dynamics of mixed-heritage families with the same irreverence & heartwarming care we got in #1. My wee one loves them both - especially the music & dancing, so make room for the kiddos (which, for me, includes my hubby) to rock out. I've heard people say it wasn't as good as #1, but I disagree. While there are a few characters I wish we had seen more of, I think they returned to the various groups enough to really make you remember why you love them while introducing new characters and groups & fleshing them out enough so you want to see more of EVERYONE in the NEXT one! :D See it - you won't regret it in the least.

7423668,5,B014TC60LC,"I rented this movie last night from a local Redox kiosk to watch with my 6 year old niece and my 7 year old nephew. I also intended for my older sister to join us but didn't intend for my brother in law to watch it as animated films talky aren't his thing and everyone knows that. We started watching this film and let me tell you I wasn't 5 minutes in to the movie before I was laughing out loud. Ok so...you don't really HAVE to see Hotel Transylvania to watch the second one. This movie is a cute little film about a vampire who owns a hotel for both monsters and humans, his daughter, and his now son-in-law who is a human. So if you couldn't imagine things are pretty wild! And they get even wilder when the daughter tells vampire dad she's pregnant with what could very well be a HUMAN. Convinced the child can only be vampire based on years and years of vampire bloodlines ""vampa"" (vampire grandpa) starts spending SO MUCH TIME worrying about whether or not little Dennis will become a vampire that he ends up pushing his daughter away. In the end love prevails above all and it doesn't really matter if the child turns out to be a vampire. Now, I thought this was am AWESOME concept. About halfway through the movie my brother in law snuck in and ended up watching the movie with us. Everyone chuckled and giggled and laughed because this movie was HILARIOUS! I definitely need to purchase this for my own collection and will probably end up doing just that when my income taxes come. I also need to buy the first one, too. These are awesome movies to watch with the whole family...our even by yourself as an adult! Kudos!",1454371200,,1630,4.365131578947368
7423669,5,B014TC60LC,I thought this was just as cute and enjoyable as the first one. I was very glad to see it had the same main stars. I hate when sequel cartoons come out and the voices are a totally different person-totally ruins the movie. Adam Sandler cracks me up and did such a great job playing the character of Count Dracula. Selena Gomez does a great job with her character as well. Very cute movie & id definitely recommend. My daughter just loved it.,1454284800,,441,4.325301204819277

7423681,5,B014TC60LC,"well its a must see movie for the kids and adult too. My 10 year old enjoyed it so much .we had missed this movie in theater but Amazing AMAZON
it the best service in the world. We do not miss or wait too long or stuck in the front rows of theater .we can pick our day and can enjoy the same fun in our own cozy beds .its so economical and for that I will give 5 stars to AMAZON. There is no streaming problem at all.
I would say AMAZON PRIME service is wonderful and awesome service to have in which you get so much which is worth more what we pay for.

This is great movie and all the kids will love to enjoy the show together in home with pizza and yummy milk shakes which they can't get in theater.
if you miss something or a part you can always go back and if the little one sleep and miss ,no need to worry the rentals are for 24 hrs .Amazon is very fair in that way.",1454284800,,873,3.7967032967032965

It's generally about a girl (vampire) who marries a regular human and they have a baby.  The grandfather (dracula) wants the baby to be a vampire, but he isn't showing any signs of actually being a vampire and he is worried that he will be a regular old human.  It's definitely cute.  The only thing that I personally didn't like is that it uses the word ""stupid.""  Certainly not a deal breaker, but I hate that my 3 year old repeats everything he hears in movies and this word did not go unnoticed.",1454112000,,590,4.3090909090909095

I preordered it before it was to come out on amazon as i loved the first movie and couldn't wait to see the second movie. I even ordered the first movie so that we could have the set. Overall very cute family movie that even our almost 3 year old loves to sit and watch this movie with or without us.

I am not usually dramatic with my comments. So with that being said, this is a family friendly movie and every time we watched it we all noticed something different. Such funny creative things were said in this movie. The items in the movie are hilarious. Husband even watched and did not fall asleep. (self explanatory) :).

(Its like flipping through a photo album and not taking the time to actually look at the pictures)!  After this begrudging prologue, the story is reduced to a simple plot device: worrying about whether the kid is a vampire or not.  Grandpa (Adam Sandler) is adamant, his grandson is a vampire; his fangs just haven't grown in yet, so he tries to scare the kid into turning.  Thats it.  They spend the entire movie racing through gags all focused on making/proving the kid is a vampire.  Apparently, hes not good enough the way he is (which is a disconcerting message).  If he expects to fit in with this crowd, hes got to be a monster.  And the right sort of monster.

Im not a fan of Adam Sandler but not having him on screen is a great asset.  I was amused more often than not.  I laughed at most of the jokes.  Its a keeper.  But Im not going to brag about that.",1453680000,2,1001,4.434065934065934

7424154,3,B014TC60LC,I will start off by saying this is a good movie......... Until the last 5 minutes or so. Till then the story plot and animation were above par. Grandpa wanting his descendant to grow up like himself and takes friends on road trip to show the old ways that may turn out to be the dead ways.  No pun intended. BUT the last five minutes when child gets fangs and violence ensues to the maximum. Not good for small children watching with us. Under lying tone of kick ass of others not like us. The end could have been a lot better with love and lessons learned.,1453507200,,557,4.205607476635514

My daughter thought it was really scary in some parts and I saw my son hide his eyes once or twice. One part has some pretty scary looking bats/vampires and I think they shouldn't have made them so dark for a children's movie. I won't let my kids see it again.,1453507200,,340,4.014705882352941

I was actually doing something on the computer while the rest of my family watched the movie but as much as I was concentrating on what I was doing the movie kept pulling me in!  It had a lot of really funny moments and nothing inappropriate!  I did not really watch the very beginning so I was a little confused about the transition from the first Hotel Transylvania and this one.  I was never sure if the red headed boy is the same one as from the first movie.  It had the same characters with a few new ones and while you certainly don't need to see the first one to see and enjoy this one it bothered me that I did not understand the segue from one to the next.  I think I would actually watch this without even thinking about the first one!!  It was definitely a cute family movie.  Definitely worth renting or buying, depending on whether your kids like to watch movies again and again.  I wouldn't mind sitting down to watch the movie again!",1453334400,,1003,4.2368421052631575

7424456,3,B014TC60LC,"I hate being negative, but I'm tired of Hollywood phoning in some of their work.  As personal opinions go, it felt as if the creators were pandering to the audience by expanding on some of the jokes and sight gags that made the first movie so endearing. ""Hey, you liked this funny bit...Well, let's do it again, only this time not as well and we'll cram it in the script somehow!""  Like the original, the same hilarious, hyper-exaggerated cartoon animation was very well done, but it wasn't enough to fully rescue this sequel from its very lackluster writing. All in all, I would say it wasn't a terrible movie (I have seen worse), but one viewing was quite enough for me and my usually easy to please kids.  Glad we rented instead of bought.  So Mr. Negative here will conclude on a positive note:  Kudos for casting the legendary Mel Brooks as the curmundgeonly grandfather.  For now, I will continue to wait for the thoroughly likable Adam Sandler and Kevin James to do another good movie.",1453075200,,992,4.607954545454546

I think this movie would be good for the whole family. I watched this movie with my 2 daughters (ages 2 and 6) and both of them laughed the entire time. I laughed harder than they did at some spots!

Adam Sandler and Robert Smigel really made some great material for the comedian hall of fame they had as the cast! It was great to see some familiar SNL voices together in one movie too.

7424582,4,B014TC60LC,"As far as I am concerned, Sandler has had three credible hits in his repertoire; The Water Boy, The Wedding Singer, and Hotel Transylvania.  So, I was naturally hyped for this much-anticipated sequel, hopeful that it would complement the originality of its predecessor, but worried that it would fall flat like most of Adam's recent jokes.  I am pleased to inform that the sequel is not only thoroughly entertaining and endearing but it effectively recaptures all of the charm, humor, and emotion of the first.  The full cast is back as big and vibrant as ever, with a few newcomers that energize all of the already over the top performances.  I mean, its pretty hard to lose when any comedy adds Mel Brooks, animated or not.  The story is simple but fun and engaging and its fast pace will keep both young and old riveted while taking just enough time for those heartfelt moments to have an impact without becoming overtly sappy.  Genndy Tartakovsky should direct all of Mr. Sandler's films; he might find a renewed success as opposed to his latest run of nonsensical excess and box office poverty.",1452643200,,1099,4.757894736842105

Granted it is by far the least offensive Adam Sandler movie in at least a generation. It isn't painful to watch and is at times even amusing. Which put sit on par with the Godfather when compared to Pixels. Some of the characters are entertaining. But there is no real cohesive story. It's all snappy patter between Sandler and his buddies. It's not bad snappy patter by the standards of Adam Sandler and crew, but without any underlying meat it just gets old fast.

7424658,2,B014TC60LC,"So disappointing. The first one is easily one of our favorite movies ever. We've watched it a zillion times and still love it. We were expecting something similar, but this movie really disappointed us.

I don't want to ruin the movie for anyone, but I feel the need to say that the image that Drac gives is one of a selfish, manipulative, lying and cheating grandfather. NOT something I want my kids to believe is normal. Even though there are definitely grandparents out there who totally ignore their children's parenting philosophies and walk over everything that is asked of them, that doesn't mean it's ok for that to be depicted in a children's movie as if it's funny instead of downright disrespectful.

Drac ""gets away"" with a ton of things that are just NOT RIGHT. All in the name of comedy.

I really tried hard to enjoy the movie, but I found it was simply not all that funny. It almost seems to me as if they tried too hard, and overdid it. There are many attempts at silly jokes or dances or expressions that go way overboard.

The underlying story, however, starts as acceptance of people's differences, and it does a pretty fair job of that - up until it sort of shoots itself in the foot towards the end by undoing the difference most central to the plot.

I was looking for something amusing and not requiring too much thought. This was nearly perfect: amusing, and not able to stand up to too much thought.

7424661,4,B014TC60LC,"I am a HUGE fan of Hotel Transylvania (it has been a movie staple for the kids the last 2 Halloween's). So, I was super excited to see the whole gang return for a second round. I thought the movie was absolutely adorable! I loved seeing the continuation of the characters, however, the execution of the story line left something to be desired.
The few issues I had with the movie, were the absence of Jonathan (Johnny Stein), and the scarier than expected minions of Vlad (Vampa of Mavis). While, Jonathan's human family is heavily featured in the continuation of the Hotel Transylvania's sequel, the character himself seems to be an afterthought.
The second issue I had with the movie, revolved around Vlad's (Mavis' grandpa's) devilish minions. These animated beasts were slightly scarier than expected (at least for the youngest viewers). I could see these vampire/bat hybrids causing nightmares for a few of the wee ones.
All in all, the addition of Dennis, (Mavis and Jonathan's son), stole our hearts! And who isn't a fan of Mel Brooks (Mavis' Vampa)!?! When this comes out on DVD, we will definitely be purchasing it. Well worth the watch!",1443830400,4,1146,4.8520408163265305
7424662,3,B014TC60LC,"When the original ""Hotel Transylvania"" was released, I'm afraid to say I never caught it in the theater. I instead waited until it came to DVD to check it out, and immediately regretted not seeing it on the big screen, for I loved the simple, but funny plotline, and all the loveable and relatable characters. So much so, that the movie is now a staple for my folks and I to watch every Halloween. (And it helps that Genndy Tartakofski of ""Dexter's Lab"" and ""Samurai Jack"" fame directed it and had a hand in the writing.) So when a sequel was announced, you can bet we were all hyped to see it.

The verdict? While the first movie is far superior, this new adventure with the hotel monster crew is still fairly enjoyable, and kept us laughing all the way through.

Taking place seven years after the first film, Dracula has since opened up his hotel to also include human guests, resulting in the general public now being fairly used to mingling with monsters. Mavis and Johnny are happily married, and soon give birth to their half human/half vampire son, Dennis. But as the years tick by with Dennis showing no signs of developing any vampire abilities, Dracula begins to worry, especially when his daughter considers moving away with Johnny to raise their son among normal humans. When the couple goes to visit Johnny's parents, Dracula (with the help of his friends) hatches a plan to help force Dennis' powers to emerge, and teach him how to be a ""proper"" monster (as well as to ensure that Mavis and Johnny stay at the hotel). But when Dracula's human-hating father shows up and discovers his great-grandson's duel heritage, Dracula must come to terms with who and what his grandson is, and learn to let him be himself.

Starting with the good, all of the characters that made the first movie great are back in full form, and are just as charming and funny as ever. (There's a monster-themed joke practically every five minutes--all of them hilarious.) With the hotel now open to humans, Johnny acts as a liaison between the monsters and humans;  helping Dracula get updated on modern technology, and introducing Mavis to his family and old hometown, all with gut-bustingly funny results. The new characters, such as Johnny's parents, are likeable, and Dennis is beyond adorable--wanting anything to just please both sides of his family. This leads to a rather important message about letting your kids just be who they are, especially when it comes to ones who come from families that are a mix of different races, cultures, or other heritages. Being that Dennis is half human/half vampire, both sides of his relatives just want what's best for him, but can't quite decide just what IS the right thing to do for him, especially when it's unclear if he'll ever develop vampire powers or not.

While this is all well and good, the plot, however, is a bit more disjointed, in comparison to the first movie. The previous film had a simple, solid plot that carried all the way through, about Dracula learning to accept humans, and let his sheltered daughter explore the world. The sequel, on the other hand, seems like it doesn't quite know what it wants to do at times. It seems that at this point, humans have accepted monsters as a part of their everyday life, which, while charming, pretty much negates any sort of dramatic tension the first movie had. The closest we get to any human/monster conflict comes in the form of Dracula's old fashioned father, Vlad...and while trailers and descriptions might make you think he plays a huge part in the plot, he actually doesn't show up until the last third of the movie (making the film's ending/big finale, while touching, admittedly VERY rushed). I feel his character would've served a much better purpose if he were introduced much earlier, and had a more active role in the plot, instead of just following the antics of Dracula and his buddies. It's as if the writers just came up with a bunch of funny monster jokes, and strung them all together, and then suddenly remembered ""oh yeah, we need some conflict"", and then hastily assembled an ending that pretty much takes us through the same story arc of the first movie, except in under ten minutes.  (Not to mention that at one point, Mavis casually tells her in-laws how her mother was killed by angry humans...to have such a driving force of the first movie be turned into a mere throwaway line is just....sad. )

While the movie isn't without its problems, I still none the less enjoyed it. The slick and expressive animation and great characters more than makes up for whatever I found lacking in the plot. It's a nice continuation of the gang's adventures, but doesn't really bring much new to the table either. The first film is far better, but if you liked the first movie, you'll most likely enjoy this new outing as well.",1443657600,29,4836,4.702479338842975

I was so excited to see this movie but I found the trailers were the best part.  So disappointed , we were all looking forward to a great movie like the first one.",1443571200,,340,3.8840579710144927
