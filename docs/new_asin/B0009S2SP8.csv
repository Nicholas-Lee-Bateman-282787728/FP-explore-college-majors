2314642,5,B0009S2SP8,"I give As Time Goes By a rating of 100 stars.

I will always love this British Comedy and I dedicate it to my beloved Kevin Calladine who reminds me so much of Lionel.

May As Time Goes By live on forever.",1124755200,6,205,3.857142857142857
2314643,5,B0009S2SP8,"I cannot add much to what has already been written.  Suffice to say, you can not go wrong with purchasing this lovely series.  Regardless of age or background, you will find a touchstone or two for your own life.

As for the acting, well, no words can describe the pure magic of witnessing the chemistry between Geoffrey Palmer and Judi Dench.  They are two of the finest actors any generation could produce.  The supporting cast is very strong, even though some of the characters might have to grow on you.  Then again, the same could be said for many people in our own lives.

Enjoy.",1123372800,17,585,4.514285714285714
2314644,5,B0009S2SP8,"I am not just a ATGB fan, I appreciate all of the work of Judi Dench - and find As Time Goes By to be some of her finest work. As amazing as she is in every last thing she embarks on -- as an artist -- I think ATGB is her swansong. Really. It's just so real - so apart from her other beautiful work - yet just as profound. Just crazy beautiful in how relevant to all of us - choosing to practice love and compassion and humor in our daily lives. Art is at its best when it imitates life and life is inspired by how artfully it is depicted.

If you like any serial TV - you've got to give AS TIME GOES BY a look. This is intelligent stuff - and truly humorous, truly interesting - and somehow everything is OK in the end. That's nice to know!",1123113600,7,741,3.843137254901961
2314645,5,B0009S2SP8,"This single series has done more to convince Americans of their intellectual inferiority to Britain than anything since the invention of the Oxfordshire accent. The fact of the matter is this series is not just astounding relative to American television. It's astounding relative to British television.

There is an old aphorism of American football that states, ""When you get the ball into the endzone, you should act like you've been there before."" As Time Goes By is television for people who have been there before. It's for real grown-ups, not kids who've recently discovered the magic of genitalia. It doesn't matter what your national identity is, this stuff is good.

Also, hilarious.",1122854400,28,692,5.169642857142857
2314646,5,B0009S2SP8,"These are the final two seasons plus wrap up special for one of the best dramadies.  Jean and Lionel are lost loves that find each other again after many years.  They fall in love again and finally married.

In series 8 & 9 many of the long running storylines are completed.  Including will Alister pop the question to Judith and ditto for Harry and Sandy.

We spent many years getting to know these people and finally can be happy all is resolved.

If you have not seen this series or just started watching.  Buy all nine series and have a long weekend.  I had to wait five years to see the end. (And I was lucky and saw the final episode premiere in London a year before PBS).

This series is the cornerstone in Judi's career.  She became a movie star during this show but never gave up on this show.

Jeffrey Palmer has been a cornerstone in the Britcom industry for thirty years (His first starring role was in Butterflies which is also just coming out on DVD).

The featured cast includes vetran actor Frank Middlemass as Lionel's free spirited father, Philip Bretherton as Lionel's playboy publisher and Judith's on again, off again boyfriend and Moira Brooker as Jean's daughter Judith.

Know that this is a show that will make you laugh then cry the laugh again.",1122768000,63,1270,4.517543859649122
2314647,5,B0009S2SP8,"""As Time Goes By"" is a smart, elegant comedy full of characters who are easy to like and easy to laugh with.  There are few farcical antics here.  Rather, the humorous situations unfold at a pleasant, leisurely pace.

Allow me to add that - in my opinion - the reviewers who say all of American television is lowbrow are being unfair.  You just have to put a little more effort into finding the good stuff!  Americans are very fortunate that PBS and BBC America are filtering out the dreck of British television (and there is plenty!).  Both networks excel at offering high-quality British programs which are palatable to an American audience, and ""As Time Goes By"" is a fine example of such fare.",1122163200,6,697,4.626016260162602
2314648,5,B0009S2SP8,"I've watched the entire series a number of times on PBS and BBC America.  VHS or DVD videos of all series now available have a prominent place in my video library.  If you are totally fed up with the foul language, gratitious sex and nudity and the absolute stupidity of 99% of American TV fare this series is for you.  The subtle humor, tenderness, and great acting by Judi Dench, Geoffrey Palmer and the rest of the cast make for an unforgettable story that will have you rolling on the floor and/or shedding a few tears.  I admit to being completely hooked!",1119225600,99,560,4.46078431372549
2314649,5,B0009S2SP8,"What can be said about ATGB it is a lot better than most of the American fare that we ""yanks"" have to deal with. The show is subtlety at it's best it contains no harsh language (no bullocks) no over explicit sex just good clean britfun. It is much better than Friends, but not as good as Sienfield. The trend in American TV is fat balding guy in his 40's married to hot slim wife in her 30's. You could never get a show about two people who have been apart longer than the regular TV couples have been married or living,

If you see the very first episode (I suggest you take some time of work for a rather good ATGB marathon) then look at lets say season 6 episode 7 (that is the episode in which she finally saw the letter) you will see the evolution of a show who writing was a master of the old school style where two people can talk without the usual! @#$%*&^%$%.",1118448000,23,868,4.105882352941176

They are talking and suddenly the disc ends. There was no closure, no indication of what occurred next and moreover, the final scene just seemed to end in mid-sentence. I thought the reunion specials might solve what happened, but it did not. Seemed a bit strange to me.

2314703,5,B0009S2SP8,"**possible spoilers**
It is slightly difficult to confess that I cried on the last episode and I'm not really a man who cries at the drop of a hat. I've thought about why this show had this effect on me and I realize that it is because the characters of this delightful program deeply inhabit your mind as you watch them throughout the years. They are friends and loved ones that you see on a day to day basis (drinking tea, making food, going on walks, chatting together and so many other common daily activities) but at the same time, you're aware that they are aging and their lives are all moving forward and things will never be the same again for all of them. In short, this program presents life just as it really is. When Jean and Lionel are left alone in the house, you can't help but feel for their loss and despite being thrilled for their daughters, they are indeed left alone. I have noticed that in my own relationship with my own wonderful Jean, I have tried to be a worthy Lionel and enjoy every custard tart, every lively conversation with her and my Judy's and Sandy's and relish every moment in my comfortable leather chair. This is a lovely, powerful and brilliant television program. I will watch it all again soon, I'm sure.",1453075200,,1246,4.445414847161572

2314706,5,B0009S2SP8,"Have re-found this series lately.  A few years ago, while watching on public TV, I thought the characters were rather too argumentative and snappish with one another.  Now, I enjoy the series more--maybe because I'm about their age and I understand how people react to each other  at this time in life.

2314738,5,B0009S2SP8,A gift for my husband. He loves the show. I  bought all the series for the years it ran. The description should say seasons instead of series.

2314740,4,B0009S2SP8,"All good things must come to an end eventually, and these two series mark the end of ""As Time Goes By"", the most pleasant, gently funny show you could ever hope to find.  Much as we would like it to go on forever, things had to end soon for our characters, otherwise risking the danger of repetition and blandness.
Judy and Sandy are still reeling from their respective breakups from Alistair and Harry at the start of series 8 and they will continue to vacillate over these men with a few twists, including Alistair and Sandy going out once... but don't worry, nothing too rocky for our beloved characters!  Lionel faces a minor crisis of conscience over his lack of pension and for a while considers selling the large country house his father gave him back in series 4... so what happens to Loll Ferris and Mrs. Bale?  The last episode of series 8 sees Alistair devastated financially (or as devastated as this gentle show will allow us to see) and Jean and Lionel try to hook up to the Internet (as a young person watching two older people try to get online I found this to be particularly endearing and funny!)
The very short series 9 can be summed up thus... episode 1: Alistair proposes to Judy, episode 2: they plan their wedding, episode 3: they marry (in a sweet, country wedding at the end of a long, sometimes turbulent courtship), episode 4: Sandy gets back together with Harry and Jean and Lionel face an empty house by the end of the last episode.  Alistair and Judy's wedding brings a degree of closure to this show that feels hard to end properly.
It's hard to end a show like this... and in a funny way it's good that there isn't too much closure to the characters.  Let's always think of them in that house in London, or that large country home.  Jean and Lionel will always be there in our minds and hearts, living out a second chance at love that rarely comes to any one with grace, dignity, and a little fun!",1414972800,,1929,4.435028248587571

It's that good and the characters (actors) make it so real and so warming.  Series 8 and 9 really keep up the pace with the rest of the series.  Never tiring and always fresh and funny.

2314863,5,B0009S2SP8,"I have  enjoyed the complete ""As Time Goes By"" series from British Telecom because it is a truly funny tale of a tragic early love affair reunited at a relatively late age. The characters are strong resulting in lots of humerous adventures.",1178928000,,240,4.714285714285714

2314866,5,B0009S2SP8,"I can't believe how well the series held up over all the years. Even in the last season, looked forward to every episode. Whoever said there's no life over 30 belongs in the dark ages! However, if I may be allowed an observation, I found it very funny that when Rocky and Madge got married, his best man broke his leg and Lionel was berated for a very lame parrot joke. Then when Alister and Judith get married, his best man breaks his leg and Rocky is trying to tell the same joke! I really hated to see the series end, but the wonderful thing is that you can go back and live the whole experience over again. If you are in doubt, I encourage you to get the series and enjoy life as you wished it could be.",1173830400,,707,4.093525179856115
2314867,5,B0009S2SP8,"This is such a wonderful show, full of great acting and writing. The characters are warm and loving without being cloying, and it's great fun to see the characters evolve over the years. Jean (Dench) and Lionel (Palmer) are full-fledged, wonderful characters that certainly make you wish you were part of their family.",1166227200,,318,5.018867924528302

You really get to know this group of people and there is never a moment that isn't genuine.  If you are not familiar with the series, do start from the beginning and be prepared for a rare treat.  One of the best things on ever television.",1153267200,2,372,4.197183098591549

2314911,5,B0009S2SP8,"Simply Wonderful !!!! My only complaint is there are too few episodes to enjoy. Although I am an American,I lived in England for a number of years and I watched many British Comedies on TV.Shows like: To the Manor Born, Blackadder,Are you being served?,and Yes Minister just to name a few. I can say that; As Time goes By,is definitely One of the Very Best. I was glad when it came out on DVD, I can now watch it from Begining to End over and over. All the Cast are Terriffic,especially the Great Judi Dench and Geoffrey Palmer. The writing;having been done by the same man throughout the entire series,shows why it was so Brilliant. Anyone who liked Seasons 1-7 will find 8 and 9 a joy to watch also,as many of the storylines get wound up. Do yourself a favor, ""Play them again and again, Sam""!!!!!",1141257600,8,799,4.442176870748299
2314912,5,B0009S2SP8,"Wonderful! I missed the ending of the series on PBS and was delighted to see that there was more of the series available on DVD. Finally put some closure on Alistair and Judy and Sandy and Harry, while at the same time focusing on the changes in Lionel and  Jean's relationship. So funny and sweet without obscenities, foul language or sick plot twists! Yet never dull or boring. It even holds the interest of my 4 kids, ages 6-12, who have varied tastes in entertainment. While they don't always understand the subtle humor or nuances, they still think it's fun to watch. I can't agree more! A great series. One to watch over and over again, just to unwind, smile and laugh.",1140825600,,675,4.532786885245901
2314913,5,B0009S2SP8,"Many think that As Time Goes By owes its quality to the great writing and the very talented cast - headed by Judi Dench and Geoffrey Palmer. I definitely agree that the witty dialogues and clever acting are two important aspects in making it one of the best Britcoms ever. Additionally I would like to point out that As Time Goes By is a bit unusual. First, the main characters are a bit older than the average American sitcom character, and even more remarkably they are allowed to behave in accordance with their age (not the 50 going on 35 stuff the American TV landscape is so full off). The overall pace of the show appears a bit slower, but the dialogues are not and appearances can be deceiving. I also find it appealing that the situations are simple, but stressful, everyday occurrences (dating, retirement, visits of relatives) and we can therefore easily relate to Jean and Lionel and the odd situations they maneuver themselves into. Some of the comedic highlights on this DVD focus on Lionel's hearing, a stray dog, and the problem of living in a house with only one bathroom. This is the conclusion of the series, so wrapping up the three different narratives (Jean & Lionel / Judith / Sandy) in a satisfying manner is a big part of the later episodes.

The entire series is very refreshing and enchanting entertainment, ideal for a rainy weekend at home - because once you own the DVDs you will want to watch them back to back over and over again. So give this DVD a try, but not without having watched at least some of the previous episodes to help ease you into the story. If you like As Time Goes By I would also recommend watching the Reunion Specials, which pick up the story from the end of the series. If you like Judi Dench and/or the basic concept of As Time Goes By I would recommend the series A Fine Romance, which will provide a good opportunity for compare and contrast.",1138579200,12,1899,4.504347826086956

Very distracting!  The fact that this happened on both copies of the DVD's leads me to assume it has to do with the quality of the recording.
