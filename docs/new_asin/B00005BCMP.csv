1421808,5,B00005BCMP,Any video that teaches my daughter to speak another language (spanish) gets an A in my book.,1010016000,,92,4.470588235294118
1421809,5,B00005BCMP,"Very good! My son loves to watch this tape, and I love to have him watch it. He's 2 and a half, and can already count to 10 in spanish in large part with the help of Dora. Dora is very user frendly and has the viewer interacting with the action currently going on. Not only that, but its fun and even somewhat interersting for an adult.",1002931200,2,336,4.029850746268656
1421810,5,B00005BCMP,"This is an exceptional series for children who at a time in their lives learn the most, will love this video and the others in the series. My son loves it! and he is learning spanish too! It is a big motivater and allows him to feel good about himself when he gets the answers right. Finally this is one video that you can feel comfortable knowing that it is purely educational at its best ! Your kids will love it. The whole family watches it together.",995587200,4,453,4.218390804597701
1421811,5,B00005BCMP,"Our 2 1/2 year old Granddaughter is now a great Dora fan, as is her Nana. What a fun way to learn! The characters are very likeable and the problem solving is interesting. We recommend all the Dora tapes.",995500800,7,204,4.256410256410256
1421812,5,B00005BCMP,This is a wonderful video for my grandaughter.  She likes the interaction this video offers and likes to answer the questions when Dora asks for help.  It also offers Spanish words for her to learn.  What a great learning tool.  The characters are adorable.,993600000,8,257,4.7727272727272725
1421813,5,B00005BCMP,"She loves Dora the Explorer. We got this video as soon as we heard it was out. She even gets excited when you sing Dora's theme song.  The stories have problem solving, there isn't violence, and the bad guy, Swiper the Fox, is usually thwarted by everyone chanting with Dora, ""Swiper no swiping!"" If Swiper does manage to swipe something belonging to Dora and Boots, my daughter and her cousins get to help Dora look for it. We always shout out the answers to the questions Dora asks us.  We have to have our Dora the Explorer (and our VeggieTales!)",993168000,5,549,4.48
1421814,5,B00005BCMP,"This interactive video had my 4 year old solving problems and vocally participating with the video. Always sweet, Dora has become a ""friend"" of my daughter.  This video seems to have more short stories than most childrens animated videos. I highly recommend it.",992476800,6,261,5.069767441860465
1421815,5,B00005BCMP,"I have two 3 1/2 year old boys at home and they absolutely love this ""episode"" of Dora.  They love all the singing and the inter-active play with Dora and Boots!  They especially like telling Swiper, ""Swiper No Swiping, Swiper No Swiping, Swiper No Swiping""!  And now they are very interested in the sky when it's night time and say the phrase ""Starlight Starbright"" all the time.  I think that this is a great educational video that stretches childrens minds to think and choose the right toy or item when asked by Dora or Boots while in the meantime teaching them a little bit of spanish too.  I definately recommend this or any other Dora The Explorer video!",990403200,17,661,4.567796610169491

7937235,3,B00005BCMP,It was kind of lame but my kids like it so that's all that counts. I found it boring but then again I don't like Dora.,1272499200,,118,3.576923076923077
7937236,5,B00005BCMP,"Yeah, so many hours have been spent watching this one with my niece that I have become a ""Doraphile"".  Engaging dialogue, brilliantly alive colors, and easy-to-learn songs make Dora a perfect ""teacher"".  She and pal Boots play off each other well, and the sinister Swiper the fox is an amusing foil in their adventures.
It's no wonder that Dora is so popular among the preschool set.
In the words of the backpack, ""Delicioso!""",1058572800,2,426,4.821917808219178
7937237,5,B00005BCMP,"In my house, we have gone from Sesame Street to Dora the Explorer.  This is the first video that we bought after watching the show and it was a great buy!  Two episodes of Dora the Explorer on the tape, which contains fun songs and of course a subtle lesson in Spanish.  My daughter loves Dora and this is a plus, as she is learning some Spanish along the way.  A great idea for a gift, this video will actually help your child to learn something....not just have them staring blankly at the screen.  And in my book, that is always a good thing.",1024617600,5,545,4.201923076923077
7937238,5,B00005BCMP,We got the Spanish version.  It is definitely a winner at our house.  My 3 year old never tires of it and she has picked up even more Spanish because of the way it has held her interest.,1012003200,,186,3.8684210526315788
