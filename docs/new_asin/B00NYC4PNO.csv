6684684,5,B00NYC4PNO,".... that's only scratching the surface .. He's John Waters .. Frank Capra .. Alfred Hitchcock and even a smidge of Russ Meyer! .. He's not afraid to go for any laugh .. and like his first 2 films, he gets plenty of them here! .. as far as I'm concerned, he's as funny or funnier than Mel himself .. can't wait for the DVD .. and I can't wait for his next movie!

Loved Ted .. love Ted 2!",1435449600,,388,3.85
6684685,5,B00NYC4PNO,"If you know Seth MacFarlane, and have followed shows such as American Dad, The Cleveland show and Family Guy, then you know his MacFarlane's sense of humor can be extreme. That being said, I am a fan of Seth MacFarlane's and I was excited to get the opportunity to see the sequel Ted 2.

A year after getting married, Ted and Tami-Lynn are arguing constantly. After a suggestion from his co-worker, Ted decides to have a baby with Tami-Lynn. After hilarious attempts to get sperm donors, Tami-Lynn is discovered to be infertile; and Ted is later brought to attention as to whether he is a person or property.

I want to start by saying that a lot of the jokes in Ted 2 are completely over-the-top. COMPLETELY. And surprisingly, I laughed a lot more than I expected to. Between the initial negative critical reviews, and because sometimes comedy sequels don't always live up to their predecessor, I lowered my expectations going into the movie. Thankfully, Ted 2 manages to do what the first did in an even better way in terms of comedy. Ted 2 has some pretty awesome cameos ala: Liam Neeson, Dennis Haysbert, Tom Brady, Sam Jones, and a few others, but Ted 2 benefits tremendously from its main characters Mark Wahlberg as John and Seth MacFarlane as Ted. I also enjoyed seeing Amanda Seyfried(does she not have the most gorgeous eyes ever?) as Samantha Jackson in Ted 2. While the humor itself was extremely funny and definitely over-the-top, Ted 2 also has an underlying message that also makes the movie better. And Ted 2 definitely goes out with a bang-an exceptionally funny one at that.

While there were a few times where the jokes did not exactly hit right or just got didn't exactly make me laugh, Ted 2 is a very good movie that has some of the most downright over-the-top humor in recent memory, awesome cameos, the duo of Seth MacFarlane and Mark Wahlberg being reunited, and the story that provides both humor and has an actual message behind it. I can't say that a third Ted movie is or isn't likely, but in my opinion Ted 2 is:

A Very Good Experience

There were some funny parts and I am happy to add it to my collection, as I own the first movie. Just beware, just like with any sequel, you can't always guarantee it will be just as good. In a nutshell, Ted gets married to his checkout register girlfriend and their marriage is rocky. He gets advice that a baby will solve the situation. Because he is a bear with no method of making a baby, they must do invitro or adopt. Well, it turns into a fight for whether or not Ted can be classified as a person or property. 4 Star Rating.",1485734400,,707,4.1678832116788325

6684920,2,B00NYC4PNO,"I love Family Guy !!
I have seen every episode at least once and it is creative brave often stupid sometimes smart but ALWAYS ALWAYS ENTERTAINING and always provides,at least a couple  great laughs
Now for ""Ted 2""  I laughed 2 times hence 2 stars and that is overly generous but I like Walberg and McFarlane.  This is mindless CRAP !!
and were it not fot Ted 1 and A million ways to die in the west I would believe it was made as a bet that any kind of garbage can make money. I think it may have been an effort to appeal to Stoners since getting high seems to be the most prevalent scenes in movie but laughs are few and strained I feel embarrassed for for everyone involved . If you want funny stoner stick with Harold and Kumar . If you want aomething of a two year old mentality and as funny as a loaded diaper then this is for you.  More than a couple steps down from bathroom humor. You can follow Teds legal drama as he must prove he is not a toy and is a human with human rights between getting high and  lame dull uninspired humor ( with a few funny exceptions )
Seth McFarlane has set the bar high for himself with family guy . But this bar is so low and provides so many dead ends when you expect a moment of inspired humor  the expectations are  unwarranted and scenes  just die out zip goes nowhere.  l am baffled as I am unable to understand who could be entertained by such junk. Well again I return to whence I started Family guy brilliant . Ted 2 moronic cannot even say sophomoric that would give it to much credit.
If you don't mind the bar so low that a snake can slide over it then you might really enjoy this.",1466553600,,1631,4.087774294670846

Seth Macfarlane has no boundaries and is an equal opportunity offender here and that said, my wife and I haven't laughed this hard at a movie in a while. Thoroughly enjoyed the big name star cameos and it looked like everyone had a great time just letting their hair down and making this very crude and well played gag fest sequil. No one should be surprised at what you get with Seth and Ted. Mark Wahlberg's timing for comedy is spot on here as well. If you didn't enjoy this, that's cool. There must be some Adam Sandler veal cutlet or a Jonah Hill insomnia cure that can put a smile on your face.

Some of the jokes/scenes and parts of the plot were borrowed from the first movie but it's a Seth McFarlane movie so don't expect lots of originality.  If you don't like crude jokes or dark comedy then don't watch this movie.  I find both to be funny so I watched it and laughed at some parts but overall it was not as funny as the first movie was.

Ted is on a mission to prove he is a person and deserves the same civil rights as the rest of us.  While on his journey, he and his buddy Johnny team up with a young female attorney named Samantha.  They all go on wacky adventures and have crazy times as they crack jokes, do drugs, drink booze go to court and also go to the NYC Comic Con!

6685206,4,B00NYC4PNO,"With Ted 2 you should at least know what you're getting by now. If you didn't like the original, you won't find vastly different characters or anything here. Although you won't find Mila Kunis, she didn't return for the sequel. However you do have Amanda Seyfried about half way through when Ted goes to a lawyer, which she is an intern at, and Morgan Freeman has a few very minor but important scenes near the end. You've also got some cameos by Liam Neeson, David Hasselhoff and a heap of other actors, including the car who played K.I.T.T. who gets into a heated argument with Ted at ComicCon. Ted 2's premise is a bit more shaky than the original. Basically Ted and his new wife who are having marriage difficulties decide to have a child. Medically they can't so after some failed other methods, decide to adopt. It is only then that they discover Ted is not legally a person, so cannot do that or even be married. Ted and John (Wahlberg) decide to fight the injustice. Meanwhile a janitor at Hasbro has evil plans for Ted.

I thought Seyfried was a bit underutilized and really should have appeared a bit earlier in the film as the character of Ted's wife wasn't bringing much to the movie. The ComicCon scenes were probably the best, a few more interactions with either celebrities or attendees would have also been more fun I think. Also for the plot I didn't understand why it never dawned on Ted that he could make a bit of money by simply attending something like ComicCon and charging for photos with him, autographs etc like a lot of celebrities do. He could have had a book ghostwritten and made money making appearances. He didn't need to rely on a low paying supermarket checkout gig. Also you would imagine there would be a lot of public outrage and pressure on the government/courts to overturn that decision.",1450915200,7,1827,4.587155963302752

Similarly I don't read film reviews, since most of them are just so much noise written by people who aren't intelligent enough to watch films (or literate enough to write reviews), so I was an open book coming into the second installment. I was not sure how well they could carry the original premise to yet another hilarious conclusion, but they did not disappoint. Amanda Seyfried takes the place of Mila Kunis here without missing a beat, and the return of Giovanni Ribisi was a pleasant and genuine surprise.

6685233,3,B00NYC4PNO,"John (Mark Wahlberg) and the foul-mouthed teddy bear (voiced by Seth MacFarlane, who also directs) return for a sequel. Its been about three years since the successful original was released, and there are plenty of jokes and references throughout Ted 2, but the new film seems in desperate need of a story that these characters deserve.

As Ted 2 opens, MacFarlanes teddy bear marries Tami-Lynn (Jessica Barth). And he wants to have a baby! In spite of the interesting opening, however, the filmmakers fail to develop the story that gets weaker as the film goes on, with a drawn-out story about Teds legal battle. Giovanni Ribisi reprises the role of a creepy kidnapper, but his character is simply unnecessary.

Ted 2 MacFarlanes jokes are as crude and politically incorrect as in the original, but not as funny as before, partly because what made the first Ted unique is missing. It is not just about the novelty of talking teddy bear, but the friendship between him and Wahlbergs character.

As Mila Kunis refused to return, Amanda Seyfried appears as a new girlfriend for Mark Wahlbergs character John. Seyfried is not bad. The problem is, like big names such as Morgan Freeman and Liam Neeson who also appear here, her screen time is too brief.

After all, though pretty entraining, Ted 2 fails to provide a drama that the main characters thunder buddies really need.",1443312000,4,1372,4.875536480686695

Ted and his wife want to adopt a child.  The government says no way to the miracle teddy bear and then starts to take everything away from him including his marriage, his job, etc. because he is listed as ""Property"".  Then Giovanni Ribisi comes in...ugh.  So, the movie goes from a C- comedy to a F depressing drama.  I had an inkling that this movie was in trouble when Seth kept going on interviews before the release of the film stating that the intended storyline for Ted 2 was the storyline for ""We're the Miller's"" movie.

Everybody keeps saying ""Seth Macfarlane isn't funny anymore.""  I completely disagree!

I thought the edition of Amanda Seyfried would ruin the movie but she actually did quite well here. She has the tendency sometimes to annoy me so I was grateful to like her character. All in all, Ted 2 is a hilarious sequel that I can't wait to own. If you liked the first one then you should love the new one. Go out and see it now!",1436572800,20,793,4.025316455696203
6685252,4,B00NYC4PNO,"In 2012, Family Guy creator, Seth MacFarlane, introduced the world to Ted, a talking teddy bear. People thought he was crazy, but the vulgar bear quickly gained a cult following and was a rousing success. The first film was really nothing more than an introduction to Ted, that showed just how extreme a talking teddy bear could be, but it lacked a real story line, and the jokes quickly got old. That however is not the case with the sequel. In Ted 2, the newlywed bear is not getting along with his wife. To save the marriage, they do what many couple do, and decide to have a baby. After failing to obtain ""celebrity"" sperm, Ted and Tami-Lynn decide to adopt, but the state has other ideas, as they determine, Ted can't adopted because he's not a person, he is property. From their Ted has to use every means at his disposal to prove he's a real person. This sequel has an interesting story and Seth MacFarlane finally decided to play on his strengths in regards to a film. Instead of these long drawn out jokes that seven people in the world get, he utilizes cutaways, the same way he does on Family Guy, and it really makes a difference. Half way through the first Ted, I was bored of it already, but Ted 2 is genuinely funny and can hold your interest throughout. This is the kind of film I always expected to see from Seth MacFarlane, and even people who hated the first film, will not be disappointed. Ted is certainly a unique character, but when he's portrayed in the proper setting, he becomes exactly what he was originally intended to be, hilarious!",1436572800,,1562,4.484210526315789

6685254,1,B00NYC4PNO,my wife & I saw this movie in the theater this week.  do not waste your time. it is really very bad.  we are surprised that Mark Walberg would make such a bad movie.  the people who wrote reviews with 4 & 5 stars must be children 14 to 16 years old.  do not waste your time buying or watching this movie.  the first Ted movie was not to bad. at least 2 stars.,1436486400,4,359,3.7972972972972974
6685255,3,B00NYC4PNO,"The problem with sequels, especially those crafted by the same minds behind the first film, is that they inevitably get greedy. That goes double for a film like Ted 2, a sequel to Seth MacFarlane's unexpectedly robust Ted, which finished up its raunchy run with more than $500M, a record for R-rated comedies. MacFarlane is a brilliant guy; whatever one wants to say about Family Guy or his stable of button-pushing animated ventures, MacFarlane is smart enough to know that his style of humor connects with people. And because of that, he knows he can use comedy to try and say something important. That's a great idea, but Ted 2 probably wasn't the right vehicle for him to do it.

That's not to say Ted 2 isn't funny; it's often quite hilarious and crude in all of the ways we expect. There are more jokes about more bodily fluids than anyone should ever hope for, and there's enough pot smoke to keep Method Man and Redman high for years. But MacFarlane is grasping at something profound with his screenplay, and every attempt he makes to say something relevant is undercut by the inevitable rude or racist joke, or somebody smoking out of a penis bong.

The MacFarlane indulgence begins near the beginning with a rousing Broadway musical number that goes on way too long and adds nothing to the narrative. MacFarlane's love of these big musical acts is well known but this one lasts an eternity. From there the story kicks off in the same delightfully loopy tone as the original, albeit with a few real-world circumstances. Ted and his gal Tami-Lynn (Jessica Barth) decide to get married, but it's a bittersweet event as John (Mark Wahlberg) is still grieving over his divorce to Lori (Mila Kunis, who doesn't appear at all). So he indulges in more weed with his teddy bear pal, but it isn't long before he too is facing a marital crisis. Ted and Tami-Lynn's marriage hits a roadblock and they are fighting non-stop, so John comes up with the kind of hair-brained idea only a complete moron would come up with: have a baby to save the marriage.

So this is what the movie is going to be about, right? Ted and Tami-Lynn trying to have a kid? For a while, yes, but MacFarlane has never been very good at walking down a straight path, narratively speaking. He indulges in too many subplots that add nothing, including a last-minute kidnapping scheme involving the return of Giovanni Ribisi's stalker character. The film's best gags occur while Ted and Tami-Lynn are trying to figure out how to become parents because obviously it's going to be tough since he's a stuffed animal. There's a disastrous and gag-worthy trip to the sperm clinic, and an attempt to steal the golden semen from NFL QB Tom Brady. These scenes are great, simple, and allow MacFarlane to indulge in being as offensive as possible.

But then MacFarlane gets greedy. Ted and Tami-Lynn attempt to adopt a child, only to learn that the state of Massachusetts doesn't consider him to be an actual human being. He has no social security number, he doesn't pay taxes, and he doesn't exist as anything other than property. So his marriage to Tami-Lynn is revoked and he even loses his job, but if he wants to have a child he'll need to sue for his rights. Yes, Ted 2 becomes a courtroom movie about Ted's fight to be considered equal. Ugh. Ted and John hire a starry-eyed young lawyer named Samantha (Amanda Seyfried) to try their case, but when things get tough they go on a pot-filled road trip to New York to try and hire a big shot attorney played by Morgan Freeman, who sadly seems out-of-place here.

The problem is that MacFarlane is trying desperately hard to equate Ted's plight to the struggles of African-Americans and gays, but his approach is incredibly clumsy. Simply showing a brief scene from Roots isn't going to cut it, and it's tough to take serious when Seyfried is in court equating a teddy bear's rights Dredd Scott and people who literally fought and died just to be considered. We get that the point MacFarlane is trying to make is that anyone who feels is deserving of equal respect, but isn't this the same Ted who has never contributed one decent thing to society ever? Interestingly, the defense actually makes that case against Ted and it rings truer than MacFarlane probably intended.

The dynamic between MacFarlane's Ted and Wahlberg is different this time, but we still believe in these two as ""Thunder Buddies for life"". Only now the focus has shifted to Ted's problems, not John's. That said, they still make a goofy pair of slacker buds we'd want to hang out with forever, watching Law & Order while high and obsessing over Sam ""Flash Gordon"" Jones.  Ever the genius when it comes to pissing all over pop culture icons, MacFarlane dreams up a couple of laugh-out-loud memorable scenes involving Jurassic Park and a field of weed, and a great Breakfast Club dance montage using Bone Symphony's classic ""One Foot in Front of the Other"".

MacFarlane flopped hard with A Million Ways to Die in the West, and compared to that Ted 2 is an unmitigated success. It's not nearly as funny, as vulgar, or as original as the first film, but there are still enough good laughs to make for a perfectly decent sequel. Hopefully if there's a third time hanging out with the bear and his human pal, MacFarlane will leave all the serious stuff elsewhere.",1435968000,3,5339,4.684434968017057
