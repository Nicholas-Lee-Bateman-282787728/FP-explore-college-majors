8271773,5,B00193U250,"This DVD showed hunts where California Bowhunter Bob Fromme took some huge animals! It shows him in British Columbia, where he takes a beautiful Black Bear, along with a huge Grizzly, a 400"" Caribou in the Northwest Territories, which could be the largest taken on video with a bow, along with some big Red Stags down under in New Zealand! Surely some great hunts all around the world",1497916800,,384,4.661764705882353
8271774,5,B00193U250,I have met Bob Fromme a few times. He is an accomplished bow hunter and makes an awesome DVD. I recommend watching.,1444867200,,115,4.2727272727272725
8271775,3,B00193U250,The editing in this video leaves alot to be desired.  Most of the footage is good but there is too much jumping around and no flow to the video.,1348272000,,144,3.9655172413793105
