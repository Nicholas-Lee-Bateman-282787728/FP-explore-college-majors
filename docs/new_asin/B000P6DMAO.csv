8189166,3,B000P6DMAO,"Fabulous account of New York's history from 1929 - to the brink of WWII. Reveals the long-lasting impact of Fiorello LaGuardia, one of NYC's most dedicated and self-less mayors and the influence of Robert Moses and how his love affair with power and the automobile shaped the landscape of all the boroughs. Packed with wonderful, insightful interviews and archival footage. Unfortunately the rote, almost robotic, stodgy narration of David Ogden Stiers is so bad that it's hard to watch in one sitting. It's hard to believe that no one noticed how stiff and dated the VO sounded.",1521590400,,579,4.979381443298969
