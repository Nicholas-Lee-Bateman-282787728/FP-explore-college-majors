7781004,5,B01H4LZZ3O,Is an excellent program. I ran across it on youtube and loved it. I was glad to find it on Amazon. It is an easy and fun way to learn to do sign language.  I really love it.,1396224000,,173,3.5526315789473686
7781005,3,B01H4LZZ3O,It was ok....I like Signing Time With Alex and Leah much better.  Miss Patty only has 1 signing video....Alex and Leah's Signing Time has tons.,1395705600,,143,4.72
7781006,5,B01H4LZZ3O,"Patty Sign Language is how we were introduced to her years ago. I LOVE that it's grown and expanded and my kids really love it. It helped both communicate before their verbal skills developed. Sign Language also helps to increase verbal communication and that shows in how advanced our kids' verbal skills are at a young age. I highly recommend teaching baby sign language and Patty's is the best out there. I have searched the web and my kids respond and learn best from her slow approach, the soft, calm teaching, and the repetition.

Patty is a modern day Mr. Rogers who combines all necessary elements to keep kids engaged and learning.",1389139200,,640,4.714285714285714
7781007,5,B01H4LZZ3O,Patty DVD and CDs are a wonderful purchase !!!! You will not regret buying your children will enjoy :) I bought some and they are just great for my preschool class they love it :),1386460800,,179,4.142857142857143
7781008,4,B01H4LZZ3O,"We found Miss Patty on youtube and bought this hoping that it would be more comprehensive. It is not.

I enjoy how she does it with the singing, but it is really repetitive. I was hoping she would include a bit of diversity, but it is her singing each sign three times.

Good for learning. Would hope that in the future she adds to this.",1385856000,2,337,4.1692307692307695
7781009,5,B01H4LZZ3O,Super-just as I expected because I have ordered other CD's/DVD's by her in the past.  They were all exceptional as well.,1378339200,,120,4.714285714285714
7781010,5,B01H4LZZ3O,"Miss Patty is a genius when it comes to communicating with children.  She is so loving and kind that the kid in me felt valued.  This DVD is the best way for very young children, and their parents, to learn basic sign language.  The signs are demonstrated through repetitious songs, that are very effective.  I highly recommend this for every child (and grown up).",1374451200,2,364,4.640625
7781011,5,B01H4LZZ3O,"My girls were 1 and 2 when we first discovered Patty on you tube. ""love at first sight"". My girls picked up the signs within the first several times of watching it. We have since bought a cd and dvd. My girls are now almost 3 and 4 and still love it. Highly recommend this artist!",1370563200,,280,4.017857142857143

8764757,1,B01H4LZZ3O,Both my 2year old son and I enjoy her online videos. I thought this video would have just as much dancing and singing but Patty just sits on a beach signing while saying ALL the words in the SAME tone. My son was excited to see her but then left the room not bothering with video. Patty you could have at least change the tone or tune.,1436313600,,335,4.014925373134329
8764758,5,B01H4LZZ3O,"I'm a sub teacher's aide and have been trying to learn signing and Miss Patty's videos are EXCELLENT!!  I bought this for a friend with an autistic son (who I met at school and have fallen in love with!) and a newborn daughter.  She wants her children to be able to communicate with each other, so she's teaching both of her children to sign.  I HIGHLY recommend this video and any other of Miss Patty's videos to learn sign language.",1426377600,,434,4.4
8764759,5,B01H4LZZ3O,"This is an excellent video that is exactly as described.  Ms. Shukla sings each word clearly and repeats it a few times.  The tune is repeated for every song so that when we are reminding Jr of a word or working with him, he automaticlly recognizes/understands that we are working with his hand signs.

Yes, it is super repetitive but that is the charm.  It is great also as a calming video when Jr is going through a fussy period or painful growth spurt for holding and cuddling time.  It doesn't pull my focus when I am reading a book while rocking him to sleep

As a bonus, my husband is studying English and singing along with this while cleaning or whatever while Jr is watching has helped his pronounciation.

At 17 months, Jr speaks 2 words (""Da"" -Spanish for 'give' and ""thirsty"") and uses 4 signs (thirsty, eat, more, and one that he made up for breastmilk).  He understands many more of both words and signs. It is great to be able to tell him ""yes"" and ""no"" and other things without verbalizing or when he is playing or whatever in a noisy place.",1415318400,,1057,4.384615384615385
