1978189,5,B00018YC2S,"I am surprised by all the complaints I see from other reviewers. We bought this in a two-pack with the Miss Spider DVD, because our 4-year-old had enjoyed the Miss Spider TV shows. After watching both of these ""movies,"" he did not want to watch Miss Spider -- but he requested the Stellaluna DVD over and over.

We then got the book from the library, and renewed it for a while because it became a favorite. We also deduced that he might have gotten a look at the book at preschool before we ever heard of it. In any case, our son was perfectly happy with both the book and the DVD versions, and did not have problems with the fact that there were differences between them.

The overall story is the same, but the telling is different -- as it HAS to be, to make a video more than 10 minutes long. That point was proven by the PBS show ""Reading Rainbow"" which featured the book one day. A professional narrator read the book out loud, and they used its illustrations for the visuals. And it runs about 10 minutes at MOST. The rest of the 25-minute show is filled with related material about bats and so on.

Well, in this DVD version, they've added a rather silly ""super-hero"" jumping spider character, who provides a couple of pivotal plot points. They also added a couple of birds who attempt a makeover on Stellaluna, which fails but teaches everybody a lesson about getting in touch with the person you are inside. That is, of course, the idea of the book but this simply accentuates it with some singing and some fun. These scenes seem to depart greatly from the tone of the original book -- but they do NOT depart from its message. Our child enjoys them, but more importantly, I feel they help the Stellaluna character develop a clearer sense of her own value.

The rest of the DVD completes the storyline with an ending that one would expect from a ""movie"" even if it's not exactly the same as the book. It's a happy ending, it leaves the birds and the bats with greater mutual understanding and respect, and -- again -- emphasizes the importance of looking beneath the surface to get to know somebody.

The DVD has extra features, including a detailed examination of bat physiology and living habits, an explanation of the differences between American bats and the African fruitbats featured in the story (something that really DOES need emphasis for an American audience, in my opinion), and the chance for kids to see what real bats look like, compared to the cartoon versions in the book or the DVD.

In summary: this version is great and should be viewed and enjoyed without fretting over its relation to the book. Guaranteed: KIDS will not care nearly as much about the differences as parents do. I mean, let's face it -- your child is going to see/read/hear 5 or 10 versions of Mother Goose Rhymes by the time they go to school, as just one example. Our child has read them in several books, then seen video versions done by the Barney TV show, ""Busytown"" by Richard Scarry, and more. And it is a great growing experience, a learning experience, when a child sees the same story interpreted more than one way.

I think it's a huge mistake for parents to get hung up on the impossible goal of trying to dictate the ""right"" version of every story for their kids. Let them see different ones, and decide FOR THEMSELVES which ones appeal to them more. Our child continued to request the book long after seeing two different TV versions, including this one. They can coexist just fine, so give your kids some credit and some leeway, and don't judge things for diverging from your expectations. Being that judgmental of superficial issues runs contrary to the lesson of the book, after all!

It tells the same story as the book, just in a different style, that's all. On its own, or in conjunction with the book, it's a fine DVD, and a perfectly acceptable addition to your home video library. We found it to be a pleasant surprise, and a good deal.",1119744000,30,3957,4.524475524475524
1978190,1,B00018YC2S,"I saw this DVD at the library (I check things out there before buying) and mistakenly thought that it was a Scholastic production.  Imagine my regret when we got it home and instead of an interesting reading of `Stella Luna' with good animation --you know, where animated drawings *actually* match the artwork in the original book-- we got a lame Hollywood video.

After 3 minutes my son (3) ran off to play with Thomas, and my daughter (5) began asking if the Library had made a mistake and put the wrong DVD in the box.  ""I thought this was about Stella Luna?"" she complained.

And that was their complaints.  Mine are even longer.  First there are the multitudinous sales pitches for some of their other slocky products at the beginning of the tape.  (I guess they couldn't pitch them after anyone had seen the movie!)

Then there is the weird option of turning off the music that goes with the video.  Well, at least it seemed weird.  After having listened to the music I know why that option is there.

But *Worst of the Worst* must be the misguided rewrite of this well known and well loved story (which some MGM mogul must of thought was a good idea).  Out goes the wonderful tale of friendship and tolerance, and in it's place a tale featuring bullying and fear.  Stella Luna?

MGM is responsible for this DVD and truly I think it would take a big movie company to ruin such a wonderful book.

If you would like a story about a bat and some birds that is entirely unlike Stella Luna, this would be a good choice.  Zero stars.",1118102400,22,1533,4.440860215053763
1978191,3,B00018YC2S,"Our 2-year-old daughter loves the Stellaluna story from the book and has read it more times than we can ever count. I got the stuffed toy for her before I got this DVD. All of these things feed upon each other, by the way.

The first time I showed the DVD to my daughter Sarah she got up and left when the first song came up, sung by Stellaluna. So, after about 10 minutes she was done with it. But then something happened - she got hooked. We had to limit her to one viewing a day because she would rather watch the DVD than eat breakfast.

Understand that she never watches any TV at all, zero. So, this is a huge video treat for her. I will give some credit to the video for the appearance of the parrots, who are more entertaining than most things that appear, and to the general storyline which is kid-friendly. However, the video does hugely divert from the way the book reads, with new characters and new storylines that have been adapted generously from the book. It's not a true rendition of the book at all - but if you know that going into it, the surprise factor goes away.

Back to our daughter - she loves it, even though she knew the book by heart before she ever saw the DVD. She even loves the spider character (not in the book) which I loathe, but to her he is awesome.

There are some lines in song that are pretty horrid. ""Gastronomically lame"" and feeding bugs ""by the pound"" come to mind - the ""by the pound"" statement is forced to find something to rhyme with ""upside down"" which Stellaluna is, no matter which way she orients herself. Ug - no professionals came up with that song. The Parrots' song is much better, later on.

All in all the video is pretty harmless and any kid that loves the Stellaluna story will probably get a kick out of it. For parents, it is a bit of an adjustment (!) but is certainly not harmful. The fashion makeover that the parrots perform is pretty fun, I must admit.",1112313600,5,1920,4.263736263736264
1978192,2,B00018YC2S,"Apart from the content directly taken from the book, this movie is confusing, jumbled and misguided. If you just want to plop your kids down in front of some DVD, regardless of the quality of content, then this is the movie for you.

I gave this 2 stars instead of 1 because it did, in fact, make my 4 and 6 year olds laugh a couple times and get scared in the scary parts, but I had trouble watching the whole thing because half the time my eyes were rolled so far back into my head (when they weren't sharing disbelieving looks with my wife). The music and voice casting were nice, but the plot was illogical and wandering and the song lyrics unfocused and forced.

Just read the book. If you want a magical DVD for kids, get My Neighbor Totoro.",1105747200,2,747,4.253521126760563
1978193,5,B00018YC2S,"My 4 year old was introduced to Stellaluna the book through her preschool class. They ended the series on Stellaluna by showing the video. My daughter loved it so much that she asked to borrow it from the classroom. I am so pleased to learn that the video is now available to purchase! The video stresses that differences are ok and the music is very upbeat and fun! I higly reccomend this movie from preschool-early elementary age. My 6 year old going into 1st grade enjoys the movie as well. A good, wholesome choice that you will love as much as your child!",1091059200,11,560,4.446601941747573

The video doesn't even come close to the magic of the book. The story has been changed and fluffed up so much that other than for a few characters from the original story, it's not even close.

1978303,1,B00018YC2S,"We love the Stellaluna book and this DVD completely veers from the tone and warmth of the book's story.  It was a major disappointment. The movie guts the story, introduces the baby birds as snarky, adds terrible characters (a spider that wants to be a superhero and some tropical birds who want to make Stellaluna into something she's not) and has completely unneccessary ""scary"" parts.  I say scary with some qualifications - our kids are sensitive to such things and many of our friend's kids would not find this scary.  It also has the owl continually threatening to eat/harm the baby birds and Stellaluna as a subplot. This movie is not worth anyone's time.  There are so many movies that are much better.",1357948800,,710,4.747967479674797

1978309,4,B00018YC2S,"I am always on the lookout for books, audio books, and DVDs that teach valuable life lessons for my grandchildren. When I came across this DVD I decided to buy it based on the price, that it was by Scholastic and had a Dove Family Seal of Approval on it. I also liked the ""Read Along Caption"" to help young readers. Before sharing with my grandchildren I always review the product. This is a delightful story. My least favorite character was the Hero spider that from the reviews was not in the original book, but as noted in an animated feature they have to add ""fillers"" to the story. ""Stellaluna"" teaches acceptance of someone different than ourselves, the value of friendship and sticking together when the going gets rough. Like they said, Stellaluna may have made an awful bird, but she was a great fruit bat or flying fox as they called themselves. I will definitely want to check out this book from the library, and maybe purchase it for my kids' home library.",1254700800,,968,4.568965517241379
1978310,3,B00018YC2S,"Both my preschooler and I enjoyed the book ""Stellaluna"" and when we came across this MGM produced DVD of the story, we were quite excited to check it out. Upon watching it however, we both realized that this DVD version is very different from the original story with many embellishments and introduction of new characters. Despite that, my 4-year-old daughter enjoyed this movie - the animation in quite well done and the little bat Stellaluna looks adorable. We both didn't much care for the songs in this movie [which come with the options of turning it on or off for sing-along].

Conclusion - this adaptation will offend purists with its Hollywood approach to the story [well, the book is relatively short, and this show runs about 41 minutes]. However, if you're ok with a less than faithful adaptation purely for entertainment purposes, this DVD just might fit the bill.",1237852800,,876,4.879194630872483
1978311,3,B00018YC2S,"My kid was psyched to find this DVD, since they read this story at her school all the time. And I think she liked the adaptation okay; it's not much worse than other modern kid's cartoons.  The thing to know about this ""Stellaluna"" cartoon is that the music is absolutely AWFUL. Just dreadfully, utterly, completely tacky and bad. If having your kid not hear terrible music, avoid this one. If you don't really care, I guess it's okay. Very sub-Disney, similarly formulaic, but not as good. (Axton)",1230940800,,498,4.724137931034483

1978372,5,B00018YC2S,"When my now-8-yr old was 3 or 4, she fell in love with the story. I happened to find the DVD at a movie rental store that was going out of business. She watched it over and over again. The birds sing a very catchy song during the makeover of Stellaluna. It's so much fun while teaching a valuable message. Now I have a 3 yr old that adores the movie. She doesn't care for my singing, though. The 18 month old can't request the movie by name yet but she enjoys the singing and music whenever it is on (she's our dancing daughter - even dances to the Siamese cats in Lady & The Tramp). It's a well-loved movie. I came out there tonight looking for the book because one day the DVD or the player is going to give out!

At the end of the movie there is a segment on fruit bats. It's very informative and should be watched at least once to learn about these little creatures and the good they do for us.",1224806400,,898,4.044943820224719
1978373,2,B00018YC2S,"I love Janelle Cannon's children's books, so I'm puzzled as to why the author would allow her name to be associated with such a poorly written DVD production based on her work.

There are two musical numbers and they are are pretty awful. For example: A sad Stellaluna sings about being ""gastrinomically lame."" Ugh. I hate it. Two fancy birds sing to Stellaluna about her needing a makeover (double ugh) and use words like ""diva"" and ""shake your derriere!"" TRIPLE UGH. There's an option to play the story without the sing-alongs and I recommend doing this because then the story is tolerable. My son loves it but had I known about the content before-hand, I would not have purchased it. This mom has definitely learned a lesson about checking out content before buying.

I gave it two stars instead of one because there is some good educational information about bats in the other segment included on the DVD as well as a how-to video on making your own bat toy.
