8083777,4,B000B910KO,She said it will be basic. She was right. But I like just watching her.  I think Hapkido is more built for people withe flexibility but not necessarily for long legged people,1497052800,,174,4.4375

8083780,5,B000B910KO,"Excellent instructional DVD.  Techniques are well taught.  However, Erin Day could have made herself look prettier.  From a distance and in a lot of the dvd, she looks like a guy.  Motivation and training by watching this dvd could have been so much more if she wore spandex, a skirt, or a bikini.",1252454400,,297,4.547169811320755
8083781,5,B000B910KO,"Both Master Erin Day and this dvd are excellent. She teaches you proper stretching, warmups, and then teaches you all the kicks. She breaks them down well and you will definitely learn and improve your skills with this dvd.",1169251200,8,223,4.743589743589744
8083782,4,B000B910KO,I bought this dvd on a whim while looking for books about martial arts kicks.  I did not expect too much but was pleasantly surprised.  Master Day explains in detail how to do kicks from simple to advanced.  The exercises for the advanced kicks are coming in handy as I work on spinning jumping kicks such as the hurrican kick.  I do not practice Hapkido but rather I practice tradtional Taekwon-do.  I think any kicking art would find this dvd useful.,1158537600,8,452,4.530864197530864
8083783,5,B000B910KO,"I am an experienced martial artist that has trained in various styles for years & I am currently training in the art of Okinawan Shorin Ryu. I bought this DVD because I had developed an improper kicking technique that resulted in a knee injury a while back, so I wanted to find detailed instruction that would allow me to overcome this limitation. Erin Day gives clear & detailed instruction that gives the practitioner a strong foundation for superb kicking technique. She clearly shows the body mechanics that are necessary for good technique. She also covers a great variety of kicks. The information this product provides has helped me by leaps & bounds!!!",1156809600,12,660,4.901785714285714
8083784,5,B000B910KO,"Being self-taught I search for good martial arts instruction and this DVD was a good find. Erin Day knows her stuff and I picked up a good 20 kicks and some neat stretching exercises I haven't seen before. The jump and spinning kicks are really impressive with my favorites being the flying 360 kicks. More than the kicks themselves I like the details on proper technique for getting optimum power, speed and better balance which improved my current abilites ten fold. Lots of kicks to learn here and worth the money.",1129507200,15,517,4.6923076923076925
