5966702,3,B00F3OLVYC,"This movie is great for kids but for adults I think it's a bit slow paced and very boring through out most of the movie. The antics that goes on between the dogs and the thieves reminds me of the comedic but much funnier and better playing thieves in Home Alone. In fact, this is almost like a spin-off from the Home Alone movies with the dogs and thieves but done in bad taste. No imagination here!
It's worth the viewing if you have time on your hands and want to watch something with a ""little"" comedy and cute story line. Last but not least, personally, I can't stand when they have real dogs ""talking"" in movies. It just ruins the movie altogether in my opinion. I feel this would've been a MUCH better movie had they not added the talking and the moving mouths of the dogs. How beyond unrealistic can a movie get than this? Such a shame! Anyway, def. a 3 star rating because of the effort to make someone laugh but it def. won't win any awards. BTW, saw this movie on Netflix. Would NEVER purchase it for myself. Last word: Kudos to the dogs I must say ... in my book, they made the movie! They were the REAL stars!",1395273600,,1121,4.21860465116279
5966703,2,B00F3OLVYC,"Basically this is a cheap knockoff of the ""Airbud"" movies with a little ""Home Alone"" thrown in. The actors are awful and I'm not sure why the Canadian dog sounds like Mater from Disney-Pixars ""Cars"". The teenage girl is the only believable character. You definitely want to bash her head in half way through the movie. My three year old liked it. I guess that makes it worth the $1.20 to rent it from redbox, but I can't imagine buying it or watching it again.",1393804800,2,460,4.423529411764706
5966704,5,B00F3OLVYC,A fine family movie. The dogs are great! Love the entire movie was made. Great Family movie 5 stars! Dogs are great!,1393027200,,116,4.318181818181818
5966705,3,B00F3OLVYC,"It was a bit slow, and I wanted something with more action.  I am 12yr old, and liked Hotel for Dogs better.",1393027200,,108,3.909090909090909
5966706,3,B00F3OLVYC,"You know when families marry you have the blended yours, mine and ours.  This goes the same with your pets.  And they do not always mix at first.  This is the synopsis here.  Pampered pooch meets country dog.  Not the two you would put together but I bet the owners are also just as different and they found a way to love each other.  It helps when they have a mutual cause to fight for too as here when foes attack the home.  Predictable but in a way that the 8 to 13 year old group loves.  Lovable dogs and plenty of action.",1389484800,3,526,4.038834951456311
5966707,1,B00F3OLVYC,"This movie is 85 minutes of insipid horror, yet it's not a scary movie. Well, it's scary that someone financed it and paid the awful actors to drain my life's essence one minute at a time.

My first grader wanted to watch a kid movie WITH me ... As in popcorn and family cuddle time... so a dog movie seemed a good way to fulfill the request. The other reviewers are correct that this film is an even lamer Canadian knockoff of Home Alone. But I hated that movie, so my review will not be kind. Here's a rundown since I'm still a little weak after the sheer feat of endurance watching this film:

The Canadian Belgian Malinois, ""Meatball"" inexplicably has a hillbilly accent and a love of meatballs. Why would a Canadian dog sound like an American hillbilly and WHY does he love meatballs?

The loving couple has zero romantic chemistry. The dad is a Ron Livingston (Office Space and Carrie Bradshaw's Post-it Note breakup) Canadian who is not funny.

The kids are grating at best. At best.

The ""bad guys"" are so much more insulting to one's intelligence than the bad guys from Home Alone. The fake mustaches and hijinks with the Pomeranian dropping a cactus on one of the robber's faces was just atrocious. I had a Pomeranian for 15 years. All they do is bark and pee on things so it would have made more sense to have the Pomeranian do just THAT for some cheap laughs from the target audience, 5-yr-olds at the babysitter's house who are plopped in front of the TV while the caregiver is outside smoking and not exposed to this horrid film.

I could go on, but reliving the experience that was ""Step Dogs"" is just too exhausting of mental punishment. My summary: one leg up ... As in peeing on this film. I bet the writers will steal that  joke for Step Dogs 2.",1388448000,3,1764,4.425925925925926
5966708,5,B00F3OLVYC,"This is a kids film, no idea why they have it rated R. It's somewhat funny. It's a total rip off of home alone.",1388275200,,111,3.6666666666666665
5966709,2,B00F3OLVYC,"This film is a low-budget knock-off of Home Alone, except with a thin plot, poor acting, weak dialog worthy of a high school writing class, and dogs, one of which carries things in its mouth.  According the film's Facebook page, the film was shot over a couple of weeks at someones home in Canada (at least the scenery and cold weather seemed authentic).  Despite the producers' best intentions, and a large number of people in the credits, in the end my assessment was ""why bother?""",1387584000,4,483,4.670588235294118

5966734,5,B00F3OLVYC,Too cute. Reminiscent somewhat of both Lady and the Tramp and Look Who's Talking Now where the city dog and the country dog start out hating each other but learn to love and like each other when it means helping out their respective owners.

5966738,4,B00F3OLVYC,"Shades of Home Alone but with a pair of talking to themselves dogs and taking place in the Canadian North, this comedic film is a hit with the kiddoes.

Recently married, a famous actress, along her niece, move in with her husband, a  widower and his son, at his house in the Great White North.  Leaving the teens in the care of a babysitter, the newlyweds head off for a week on their honeymoon.

At first, the children are at odds and so are their dogs.  The dogs lips move when they speak to each other, and there's plenty of silliness when two inept thieves attempt and attempt and attempt to steal a diamond from the house.  Lots of slapstick made our kids(ages 7& 10) laugh as the dogs team up to, repeatedly, thwart the baddies in totally ridiculous fashion.

The dogs are well trained, and overall the movie's well made; although, some adults may get bored quickly.  It's all done for the kids' humor and point of view with nothing scaring or threatening.  Filmed in Regina, Saskatchewan with plenty of snow.",1397260800,3,1016,4.538461538461538

8612100,4,B00F3OLVYC,"My mom (a senior citizen) and her home health clients all enjoy this movie and I really think young kids would too.  I'm guessing kids under age 10, and maybe preteens who are particularly into animals and/or not super mature or sophisticated for their ages.  I don't mean to sound bad in saying that but I can't see my friend's 14 year old daughter watching this with a straight face.  It is very very cheesy and silly.  I have not personally watched the entire thing and I don't plan on it, but it seems cute enough.  Talking dogs.  You can imagine what it's like.",1499040000,,566,4.394230769230769
