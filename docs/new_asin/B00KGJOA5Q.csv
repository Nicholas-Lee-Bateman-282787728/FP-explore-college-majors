6425405,1,B00KGJOA5Q,"Near the end of ""Purebread Murder"" the narrator claims she was ""the victim of her own trusting nature...""

Uh. Nooo...

She was the victim of the murderer, not herself. Let's keep the blame where it belongs, shall we? Dang it.

Also, the ""information"" is brazenly presented in such a way that's meant to toy with your head (of course)...Cheap, overused, lazy production tactic...Kind of lets you know how seriously you can take programs like this.

Useful for procrastinating, though.",1472342400,,484,5.0886075949367084

6425455,5,B00KGJOA5Q,"enjoy watching real life events, heart felt seies life these tv episodes need to be reviewed.  Criminals should be caught and be brought to justice for
their crimes.  Most criminals should serve life without parole.  These people who live in the United States, or from other countries, do not think about
the crime until it's to late and will run, cover up and hide their crime.  It may take yeats or not months.  Evendents and cues thats left behind, with the
vast technologies, forensic Doctors look into the case.  Detectives will be on top of the case day in and out to bring closure to families and love ones.

I tragedy happen in my family, I will want the same closure for justice.  Yes, people makes mistakes, but need to be accountable for what they do in
their life.  We live free, stay free, and make decison to be crime free.  We should not take another life, and yes we are only human.",1464393600,,898,4.45398773006135

6425481,5,B00KGJOA5Q,I've been watching this show for years. It's is great to have on Prime. Some of the episodes start to run together and there is even an episode where the killer had watched Forensic Files and tried to plan a murder based on that. But over all same great show.

The director was not afraid to tell the story or share the awful details of murder and the inhumanity of man against man.  The series will bring tears of grief and joy in the celebration of the capture of the culprits.  I fully recommend this adult entertainment.",1418169600,,436,4.76

Essentially 78% of all murder victims are men, but it seems like 95% (I'm guessing here) of the cases shown are female victims.  Maybe the ones where the women are victims are more interesting.  Don't know.  I'm sure tracking the killer down with science is interesting regardless of the gender of the victim.  So why do we have it more representative of the truth?

That's why I give it 3 stars.",1413849600,,553,4.46
