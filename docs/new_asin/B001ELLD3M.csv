8298712,5,B001ELLD3M,"I have just received this, arrived promptly. I ordered this because I saw it online and I thought it would be a good reference product to own. It is a fascinating, quite objective documentary on Ataturk, founder of Turkish republic. Probably there is more to know about this fascinating soldier/leader however this is the first ever realistic one I come across. Being made 4 decades ago, also adds to its appeal.",1336780800,,412,4.816901408450704
