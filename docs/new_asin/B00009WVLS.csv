1894635,5,B00009WVLS,"This is an educational and emotional look at the Bronte family, not just 3 author siblings. Although beginning in 1826, it primarily covers two decades (1835-55) when ambition, creativity, successes, failures, and heartache mingles together as is true for normal families of any period. Having first aired in 1973, the Yorkshire production offered almost a documentary timeline, but performed in a drama mode. It is as good as filming was capable of producing nearly a half-century ago. It used the actual family home Hayworth Parsonage as well as the surrounding landscape (Pennine moors) to make the viewer travel back into the days of Bronte mastery of words. Not being an expert in the biographical aspect of the Bronte family, I hesitate to declare the characterizations as authentic, but I can say they are extremely alluring and captivating. Each sibling, even the brother, plus Pa become an endearing person who you empathize with through the thick and thin of life.

A most fascinating part of this DVD set is the cast. Most would have been considered unknowns, certainly not ""BIG NAME"" stars at the time of filming. For instance the son, Branwell, was played by quite young Michael Kitchen, of course known around the world today for so much, including&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Foyle-s-War-Series-1-5-From-Dunkirk-to-VE-Day/dp/B0024OW1QQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Foyle's War: Series 1-5 - From Dunkirk to VE-Day</a>&nbsp;.

""The house is old, the trees are bare
Moonless above bends twilight's dome

1894636,5,B00009WVLS,"When it debuted on British television a generation ago, this five-part docudrama on the Bronts was acclaimed by viewers ranging from specialists in the writings of the family to people who had never read a line of their works. Today, the series looks as good as ever (if not better), an impressive fact given the sheer amount of Bront scholarship published in the last three decades. Even in 1973, however, Christopher Fry in his screenplay could draw on separate biographies of all four Bront siblings by Winifred Grin, in addition to Mrs. Gaskell's 1857 life of Charlotte Bront, which is a touchstone of the series. It seems that Fry resolved to restrict himself to events in the family history that could be documented; this precludes high-flying recreations of Emily's mysticism, Branwell's supposed influence on his sisters' fiction, and Charlotte's alleged destruction of manuscripts bequeathed her by Emily and Ann. Consequently, mounting controversies on such topics have left the screenplay unscathed. Even when Fry improvises dialogue and violates strict chronology, he never strays from the plausible. Not that this concern with verification lacks its penalties. While Emily is often seen writing or reading, the subjects of these activities are scarcely ever divulged. A particular letdown is the failure to acknowledge Emily's six months at Law Hill near Halifax, where (as Grin argues in an entire chapter of her biography), this great author may have conceived a narrative that evolved into ""Wuthering Heights."" By contrast, her dissipated brother Branwell gets a lion's share of screen time, recollected as he was by anybody who got drunk with him. More justice is done to Ann, the Cinderella of the family in 1973 but (thanks in part to Christopher Fry) acknowledged today as an important author. The recreation by Fry of Charlotte Bront should fascinate any reader of her works.

The screenplay comes to life in the film. Haworth Parsonage, where most of these events occurred, is vividly evoked, heightening the immediacy (and poignancy) of what are already inspired performances. Alfred Burke, as the Rev. Patrick Bront, is so perfect that the good gentleman himself seems to have been resurrected to star in the series. His four children are marvelously impersonated, and Emily, who says relatively little, becomes a focal presence thanks to the speaking silences of Rosemary McHale. Unquestionably, this series will prove most enjoyable to people with some prior knowledge of the subject. But geniuses are human, and the humanity of these portrayals can be felt by any receptive viewer.",1270080000,3,2608,5.2541966426858515
1894637,5,B00009WVLS,"I managed to watch this 1973 production through a rental site as the price of this DVD set is just too high. Like many others, I've loved the works by the Bronte sisters, especially ""Jane Eyre"", ""Wuthering Heights"", and ""Vilette"". I've also read many biographies of this talented and literary family, and based on my reading, I found this production to be a credible adaptation of the lives of the Brontes. Personally I felt there was too much focus on Branwell initially and the production could also have delved deeper into Charlotte's experiences abroad.

All the actors did a great job in their roles - the viewer gets the sense that these are the actual people, so credibly are they portrayed. How tragic that all of them died young! This production is not for everyone as it is outdated (in terms of production quality) and the subject matter itself can be a tad depressing and dark. But fans of the Brontes will find this a faithful retelling of the lives of a most compelling family.",1267920000,2,991,4.662857142857143
1894638,5,B00009WVLS,"This is yet another amazing production that is impossible to find in the UK - I was so thrilled, after years of searching, to find it on DVD in the States. I sat and watched the whole series through in one day from start to finish. They don't make them like this anymore, is a cliche but in this case, true.

The script is by Christopher Fry - so expect the best!  Wonderful acting, great locations in the North of England, no intrusive music and a fine performance from the young Michael Kitchen as the deeply troubled Branwell.  His descent into hell through drugs and drink and his inability to harness his talents is movingly portrayed.  The sisters are given credit and time as complete individuals in their own right and their stories unfold, entwined against the backdrop of the authentic wild moorlands around them. The one steadying influence and the lonely survivor is the father, played with great dignity, restraint and compassion by Alfred Burke.

Absolutely wonderful experience set against the backdrop of Victorian England - unforgettable.",1264809600,2,1055,4.904494382022472
1894639,5,B00009WVLS,"Discovering the Brontes in my teens in the seventies and subsequently becoming a member of the Bronte Society for over ten years, I remember this series reached an almost mythological status. It originated here in the UK on Yorkshire television from 1974 and though, at Society meetings in London, everyone by reputation praised it, none of us had actually seen it! It had probably never been shown on television outside of the Yorkshire area. Then in the mid-nineties it was released as a plain-wrapped educational two-video set and I then found out the reason for all the praise. But on video and from 20 year-old master tapes it was a prime candidate for DVD treatment so a heart-felt thanks to BFS Video of Canada for having the good taste to do this.

Now I will concede that the pictures manifested in the mind from reading a book are very personal; more so Victorian literature with it's attention to detail on characterisations. Victorian novel fans have probably all at sometime shouted at the TV screen ""that's nothing like Heathcliffe -Rochester -Becky Sharpe -Mr Dombey (insert favourite character here)""! but having read just about all there is to read on the Bronte Sisters this dramatisation for me is faultless.

It must be remembered however this is not a big-budget production, with big name actors and a computer-generated Haworth and Yorkshire moors - it resembles the made-for-TV BBC classics from the seventies and eighties, and I mean that as a compliment. These series were known for using superb, restrained stage actors who knew how to convey that minute Victorian detail of character and emotion for close-up TV work. The locations are genuine as well: filmed at the Bronte Parsonage (the later wing added after the Brontes time carefully cropped from view); at the small quarry just above Haworth; and the waterfall and Pennine moors west of Haworth. The interior shots, though I'm sure studio sets, are also spot on.

I can vouch for the accuracy of the Brontes' story as portrayed in this series and there are some points to mention that illustrate the quality of the research and the acting: the too-little mentioned self-deprecating humour of all the Sisters is well portrayed; Mr Bronte is not portrayed as the usual priggish, strict, disciplinarian but is presented as an understanding father who actually gave his daughters an unusual, for the time, amount of freedom and support; Anne Bronte is quite correctly given an equal amount of importance as a sister and author and her worldliness is emphasised as well; Aunt Branwell is nicely presented in a kinder light than usual; Emily Bronte for all her genius and mystique is portrayed here as refreshingly ordinary and out of the all the sisters we see her in domestic situations the most; last but not least Vickery Turner's Charlotte is, for me, just perfect; especially her humour and energy but most important of all at the end when you wonder just how much more tragedy can befall a person her Charlotte doesn't become either a pathetic victim or a cold stoic; under such tragic circumstances she could so easily become distanced from the viewer and indeed, herself, end up like a character from a Victorian melodrama.

As I said earlier, biographical dramatisations are very personal and subjective but for me I can't imagine a more moving, well acted or more accurate portrayal of the most talented family in English literature.",1158969600,30,3421,4.954703832752613
1894640,5,B00009WVLS,"I've loved the story of the Bronte family ever since I read Jane Eyre at age eleven and have since read everything I could about this unusual, talented family.  This production follows closely the facts of their lives as I have understood them though the first half especially focuses so much on Branwell that Charlotte, Emily and Anne fall in to the background. As another reviewer wrote Charlotte's time in Belgium could have been expanded especially since it so heavily influenced her writing in both Jane Eyre and Villette.  One of the high points of the film is the  actresses playing the girls are made up and portray themselves so they closely match the famous portrait Branwell painted of the trio.  I loved the little things that were brought out - fiercely intelligent Charlotte so nearsighted that without her spectacles she has to almost put her face to the print as she reads and writes, brilliant eccentric Emily who rises from her death bed to feed the dogs and sweet Anne perhaps the least gifted but the one most likely to have led  a conventional life if only circumstances had been different.  The actor playing Branwell does a good job as he falls from the bright shining hope of the family to crazed recluse destined to be the first Bronte to die young.  We are never sure if it was drink, drugs, depression or just failure to meet his dreams that turned him in to a decrepit heap rarely rising from his bed.  Rev. Bronte is portrayed as almost unbelievably passive as he takes the self destruction of his son and the later deaths of his daughters stoically.  The only thing that ever really upsets him is when Charlotte's future husband, Arthur, first begins to show a romantic interest in her.  Yet after Charlotte's death Arthur is the only one left to care for the old man so he deigns to considers him a ""son"".  But as Rev. Bronte says himself in the final scene he is ""eccentric"".  I do think that many viewers who do not know the story of the Brontes will find this production to be confusing, boring and ultimately depressing but this Bronte lover at least was thrilled to find the Brontes and their parsonage and Yorkshire moors acted out on the small screen.",1157760000,17,2189,4.61340206185567

1894642,1,B00009WVLS,"I feel almost guilty in commenting on a television production more than 30 years old, but I continue lest some other unwary admirer of the Brontes wastes money on this video.  To the best of my knowledge the lives of the Brontes have been recreated on film only three times: here and in ""Devotion"" (Warner Brothers, 1946) and ""Les Soeurs Bronte"" (1979)  I grant that ""Devotion"" is more fiction than fact, but it does capture something of the Bronte myth.  This production--titled ""The Brontes of Haworth""--gives us precious little of Haworth and an utterly boring version of the Brontes, mythical or otherwise. Papa Bronte is generally benign and genteel, his daughters far less passionate and intelligent than their novels would suggest, and his son a self-pitying fool.  Indeed, Emily, Charlotte, and Anne seem like waxwork figures.  The text on the box describes their lives as ""turbulent,"" although as presented here, those lives are about as turbulent as clotted cream. Branwell is fawned over, coddled and cuddled, and constantly praised by his family, but the character as acted by an unrecognizable Michael Kitchen is a braggart, a pompous braggart at that, whining, morose, irritating, confused and--to the viewer--confusing.  God only knows why Branwell behaves so childishly, and He didn't confide in  Christopher Fry--THE Christopher Fry--who wrote the script.  Thus, what his family says about Branwell, compared to what we see of him, makes us wonder if his father and sisters were stupid.  The fault lies directly with Fry. Perhaps members of The Bronte Society will prefer this video to ""Devotion,"" but the latter at least has some fine acting and good production values.  I find absolutely nothing to praise in this turgid biovid. No one seeing it would ever wish to read one of the Brontes's novels, and that is the greatest sin of all.",1140307200,17,1854,5.069078947368421

1894651,5,B00009WVLS,"Even though this presentation is decades old, it is a wonderful stage play that translates well into film and television.  What struck me most is the mood that it conveys.  It shows the bleakness of the locale with its moors, and the isolation of the Brontes as a family.  The only one who seemed to function well while alone in society was Charlotte Bronte.  Today we would call her a ""go-getter.""  The remaining siblings seemed to find that their family and home were the only places where they felt safe.  This is the second viewing I had and did not realize that Michael Kitchen played brother Branwell.  His characterization is not the cool detached character from Foyle's War.  Highly recommend this for the die-hard Bronte fan.  Note: If your public library has this, check it out and see if you like it.  Based on some of the feedback here, it may not be for everyone.  Bear in mind though that this was filmed in the 1960s I believe, and does not have the Masterpiece productions that we are accustomed to now.",1402012800,,1019,4.574585635359116
1894652,5,B00009WVLS,"Watching this exceptional five-part series about the Bronte family of artists is a fascinating experience. Consider this: a widowed country clergyman has six children to raise (with help from his sister-in-law and a devoted housekeeper). The two eldest children have died before the story begins. This leaves son Branwell, who everyone describes as brilliant and destined for artistic greatness, and his three sisters, Charlotte, Emily and Anne. If you didn't already know that the three sisters were to achieve literary greatness with their respective novels JANE EYRE, WUTHERING HEIGHTS and THE TENANT OF WILDFELL HALL among others, you would never in a million years expect the artistic muse to descend as it did on this humble household. Isolated in northern England, living most of their lives in the parsonage, surrounded by an enormous graveyard (with the resultant effects on sanitation), and with little artistic influence at hand apart from the books they read. Its an artistic miracle.

Yet that is precisely what happened. The real tragedy here is that son Branwell failed to live up to his prospects. There is an underlying theme of sexism at play here. Everyone expects the sole male child to succeed while the women are given nary a nod. And when they do begin to write and find success, they have to do so under male pen names. This sets up an amusing scene when two of the sisters travel to London to meet their publisher to prove to him that their books are written a) by different authors (he thought one person had written all their works) and b) that they were female. Of course this thinking was very much of the time and the injustice is not belaboured. It is just one aspect of an incredible true story that is unparalleled in the annals of literature.

Christopher Frys brilliant script is at times poetical and subtle, in keeping with the best of this great poet/playwrights work. It is fitting for an author of his calibre to have undertaken the story of this unique and tragic family.

Brother Branwell is played by a very young Michael Kitchen, who will be particularly well-known in North America for his brilliant work on Foyles War. Kitchens career got off to a great start straight out of drama school when he was signed by a top agent who recognized his exceptional talent. He was 25 when this series was made and he gives a beautifully-nuanced performance.

Alfred Burke, known for his long and varied careerhe died only last February at the age of 92gives weight as the Bronte patriarch, Reverend Patrick Bronte. Apparently he had a lifetime habit of announcing when he was going to bed, which always ended with the gentle admonishment to his daughters not to stay up too late. This is gently humourous, and also shows the fathers undemonstrative affection for his girls.

Vickery Turner (once married to the great Warren Oates!) is particularly good as Charlotte Bronte, who outlived all her siblings. She seems the nearest to finding happiness in her short life. The Brontes were a tragic family, though it was not uncommon at this time for people to die young.

This is low-key but compelling drama, produced and performed with a sure hand. Lovers of Brontean literature will revel in the details of the lives of this family of artists. The dampness of life next to a wind-swept moor is well-created and lovingly brought to the screen.

Barbara Leigh-Hunt, a wonderful actor not nearly known well enough in North America (shes a contemporary of, and every bit as good as, Judi Dench) holds the narrative together, playing the historically-true Bronte biographer Elizabeth Gaskell, narrating in the first four episodes and appearing in the last.

It is a well-known historical fact that the Bronte children all died young. The last scene shows father Bronte, sitting alone before the fire, wearing as always his high, preferred Wellington-style collar. He gives a short soliloquy on why he thinks life has unfolded as it has, why he has lost all his children. It is deeply poetic, beautiful, tragic and as haunting as the great words woven together by this trio of tragic sisters. This is the genius of Christopher Fry, finding the right words to end this history which asks more questions than it can answer.

THE BRONTES OF HAWORTH is fine, intelligent biographical drama.",1397433600,,4312,4.903978052126201

This product is amazingly true to life; I could swear the actors were the actual Brontes themselves! They looked and acted exactly like their pictures and biographical portraits. The only thing missing was Charlotte's thwarted romance with M. Heger, whom she loved ardently and hopelessly. He never answered her letters, in which she begged for just a crumb of friendliness after she returned to Haworth from Brussels. She alludes to the heartache of unanswered letters later in the miniseries, when Arthur Bell Nichols sent her letters that her father would not allow her to answer. The deaths of all the Bronte children, including Branwell, Anne and Emily, were poignantly presented. Charlotte's demise was the saddest of all, as it ended her brief happy marriage with Nichols. I cannot recommend this film highly enough to anyone interested in the Bronte family.

1894668,5,B00009WVLS,"I stumbled across this series by accident and I'm very glad I did! I think it's by far best dramatization of the Bront family's story  I've ever seen. Made in 1973, by Yorkshire TV , its sets are simple as are the costumes...but imo that adds to the realism...the Bronts and other people at this time lived much more simply than is usually depicted today.

 The cast is superbly suited, everyone is wonderful. The writing is excellent, those  involved knew thier subject and loved them I think.

This last ep. shows the crushing loneliness Charlotte had to endure after her 3 siblings died, one after another within 8 months. One has to wonder how she did it. Such a loss would be terrible for anyone. But for a Bronte, it was like being the last of her race. Even with others, you are alone. Two other sisters had died years earlier, so of a family of six children , Charlotte was the last.

 Charlotte has to choose, not simply between marrying Arthur Bell Nicholls or remaining single, but will her life be London centered, or Haworth centered? Because as Mrs. Nicholls, she knew it would be the later. However by this time she was getting somewhat weary of London. I believe that is why she  finally accepted Arthur and then worked on her father to make the marriage happen. A disenchantment with London had to happen first.

It sadly seems the producers didn't have time to show the 3rd time Mr. Nicholls broke down over his love for CB. It was at the parsonage garden gate after handing over the school deeds to Mr. Bronte. Arthur believed he would not see her again. She came out to find him sobbing. Their love story has as many twists and turns as any Bronte novel! I love how he is pass caring how Haworth gossips or what anyone thinks, his love sickness is on full display for months. It's the only way he would have be successful. Brontes respond to that level of emotion ...anything else bores them.

It seems to me Charlotte was testing Arthur by not merely attending the last church service he would conduct before leaving, but she actually appeared at the communion rail! Forcing him to interact with her during the sacrament . He could barely function. She called it "" a lesson not to be repeated."" Indeed! She took Mr. Nicholls's love more seriously there after

The death scene between Charlotte and Anne is very toughing...as is the last one. The actor who played the father was inspired. Really glad I found this gem!",1351036800,6,2438,4.556064073226545
1894669,1,B00009WVLS,This movie is terrable the acting is substandard. The photography looks like this was spliced from an old TV program done in the 1970's.,1349136000,2,136,4.708333333333333

1894671,4,B00009WVLS,"The Brontes are seen as they were, very extraordinary people living very ordinary lives. The film does an excellent job in getting that point across. As was true of their day, the family's hopes and dreams were set on the son who was never able to fulfill his destiny. Melancholy and sadness abound but it was true of the Brontes' lives. A very good film indeed.",1339372800,9,362,4.5

7993784,3,B00009WVLS,This DVD is dated.  The writing is dull and the filming is the old video style of stifled interiors and washed out exterior scenes.  But perhaps that is an accurate depiction of their rigid middle-class sensibilities and strictured morals.  Thank goodness their novels were far more exciting.,1525132800,,292,5.170212765957447
7993785,5,B00009WVLS,"I had to have something to do while I recovered from carpel tunnel surgery in the past and gathered all the stuff of these galls reading and history.
This is a great show to get the emotional impact. I have issue with the supporting caricatures and how they are portrayed. The aunt was to be the one that could barely see and that is why the writings of the children were made in very small books so she could not see them, because you could get a beating, if caught doing self indulging activities.  For girls to be writing was considered to be self indulging. I know that as artist media takes liberty with the facts and that is ok. The things Emily wrote would have not been publish today, the stories I read was so dry and almost read like a manual to something. But I could have read more but did not have time, at that time. The father was show to be the puritan and treated Charlotte as a wife figure to take care of his frail condition. He out lived them all. Charlotte only live one year after she married. Now with all that said, I could have looked at that information differently because coming out of surgery and not quite all there. So this is just an thinking  and not  factual or I would added references to the books I read.  There are two parts to the series but I could not get back to the first one. Still can't navigate this system. lol",1508716800,,1357,4.227799227799228

7993790,5,B00009WVLS,"Brontes....  Does it get any more Goth than that?  This is a fine production.  One in our day and age can find the cloying closeness of brothers and sisters in the early 19th century--especially the Brontes--a little uncomfortable.  Sisters were supposed to make over their brothers like they were husbands--the brother's interests always before the sister's.  And most of the Bronte siblings died of Consumption.  I wonder why?  they lived in an open air, isolated community in Yorkshire, on the moors.  Anyway... Good production.  I didn't see the other episodes",1454198400,,564,5.177777777777778

I don't know, however, if the movie is true to their actual lives, since some screenplays take license to change a few things to make the story more interesting.  We have read most of Charlotte's books and Wuthering Heights.  We prefer Charlotte' s works.",1440374400,,448,4.620253164556962
