It is Funny Funny Funny and amused me the whole way threw...Whoever did the writing did a great job of casting and pairing and pitting these two up against each other. Yea Yea its a cliche movie but who doesn't love a great comedy holiday movie. Its funny and your never quite sure who you want to route for (him or her) they are both such funny characters. But in the end it ends perfectly. I wish they would have made a Part 2. My husband even liked it, mind you in the beginning: Ohhh do i have to watch this Chick Flick???

4661741,5,B005DTGB0G,"I've only seen ""His and Her Christmas"" and have it recorded off of my television from a few years ago and wanted to get it in DVD because it is in my top 3 Christmas romances. Very entertaining and romantic, these 2 actors are charismatic together. The story is about two newspaper journalists going head to head over views on Christmas - one is for it, one is against it.

4661748,3,B005DTGB0G,"Not two that I cared for.  Just my taste, but those that watch to fill time might give them a peek.
His & Her Christmas.  Have you every watched two people who have never met screaming and insulting each other and so you say - ""they are so in love?""  Neither have I!  I kind of get tired of these type stories because we all know that these never end well in real life.  How can these movies always have friends around telling them they are so in love with each other. This is another of these movies.  Two columnists at different newspapers run columns (one pro & one con) about the Christmas season and trade insults.  When they meet at a Christmas party she attacks him physically - then they fall in love and live happily ever after.
Will You Merry Me.  Suspend reality and you will get a kick out of this one.  It is silly, ridiculous, over the top, but there is some humor in this one.  Patrick McKenna was fun as the stunned father of the girl walking around in his own little world.  People in Canada might remember him from The Red Green Show many years ago.  Good actor, solid comedian.
These films are geared for the adults, not the family.",1417737600,,1151,4.277777777777778

4661764,2,B005DTGB0G,"I love Christmas movies, but could not stand these two. I have learned to steer clear of Lifetime movies which only ever have one theme- girl meets perfect boy and after some trouble, lives happily ever after. Just like real life, huh?

4661766,3,B005DTGB0G,"Clean.  They had their moments.  Overall, both movies were slow.  Like David Sutcliffe in Gilmore Girls, but it took along, long time for the story to get going.",1389139200,,161,4.678571428571429
4661767,4,B005DTGB0G,"Where's my spoon? Hang on, as I try something.

In the 415 area code - mister, that's in the Bay area - two feuding journalists are about to make their respective papers the morning must-read. Tom Lane (David Sutcliffe) is one of *those* guys, such a smooth operator. He writes for the mighty San Francisco Sun. Tom has got his ducks in a row, career on the fast track, set to land his own television show any minute now. Tom claims a - ehm, how did he put it? - ""21st century, metropolitan perspective"" on politics and art. His work computer, when he checks it in the morning, routinely has fifty messages waiting for him.

In New York, Rebecca and Henry, roommates of six months, have just gotten engaged. But is six months long enough for them to really get to know each other? Both sets of parents harbor deep concerns, and perhaps rightfully so. Rebecca Fine (Vikki Krinsky, very cute) comes from an affluent Jewish family in Los Angeles. Henry Kringle (Tommy Lioutas) is a kid from Wisconsin, raised on midwestern Christian values. Maybe their disparate backgrounds wouldn't have mattered this early, but Rebecca and Henry couldn't pass up on the opportunity to meet their impending in-laws. Henry invites Rebecca's parents to come visit in his home town of Dunston, Wisconsin where his own parents lurk- er, I mean, await. It's a recipe for nothing good can come of this.

Back in the Bay area, Liz Madison (Dina Meyer), unlike Tom Lane, has her ducks in no row whatsoever. Liz is sort of a hot mess, y'all. She runs an advice column for the small town periodical, the Marin County Voice. She has got a scattershot grasp of her life right now, what with her recent divorce and an aversion to dipping her toe back into the dating pool. Liz draws a blank when her young niece, Jacqui (Alexia Fast), astutely asks, ""How can you give advice on relationships when you don't even have one?"" Way to put your hot aunt on the spot, kid. Oh, and this morning, when Liz powered up her computer, guess how many messages were waiting? One message.

In the other narrative, both sets of parents indulge in ignorant social psychology (but you can call it ""stereotyping""). Rebecca's mom, Suzie Fine (Wendie Malick), is talking smack about her prospective son-in-law: ""And he better not ask her to convert, because Jews don't convert. We are the Chosen Ones, after all."" (Never mind that the Fines haven't been to the temple in three years.) And then there's Henry's mom, Marilyn Kringle (Cynthia Stevenson), who does her bit of summing up: ""Jewish people are very sensitive and high strung."" It's suspected that the Fines and the Kringles are in for a spell of awkwaaard. Here's one such moment:

- Rebecca (confirming her vegetarian preference): ""I don't eat anything that smiles.""
- Mrs. Kringle: ""Okay. Quiche. Takes an hour, tops. I can get a recipe from the Internet...""
- Henry: ""Mom, Rebecca, she doesn't eat cheese, either.""
- Mrs. Kringle (flustered): ""Cheese can smile?""

So much is made of the San Francisco Sun's recent acquisition of the floundering Marin County Voice. The Voice has been the dependable read for Marin County for the past 70 years, but circulation's dropped 16% from last year. To revive subscriptionship (if that's a word), Liz (the hot mess, remember?) retools her column, forsaking giving advice to them lonely hearts for the heartfelt editorial. And, apparently, Liz has a finger on the pulse of the community. Overnight, the Voice's readership increases. The Voice's turnaround success threatens Tom Lane's shot at a television show, and so his editor orders him to undermine Liz's column. And so was born Tom Lane's big city column dedicated to swift rebuttals of every little thing that Liz writes about. He ridiculous Liz's sensibilities as the ""contemporary sentiment of a 19th century schoolmarm."" Oh, snap.

Note that the Wisconsin branch of Kringles has fully embraced their name. They celebrate Christmas with the intensity of a thousand suns. The Kringles have holiday-themed ring tones. They drive the Christmas mobile. They're ferocious in their participation in the annual neighborhood competition to see who could put up the best Christmas decorations. Their house looks like Santa's workshop if it exploded. I'm sure Wendie Malick can tamp down her snark, even when she espies that giant fiddler on the roof on the Kringles' roof. (Okay, the Kringles were only trying to make the Fines feel included in the holiday festivities, never mind that it comes off vaguely condescending (but remove the ""vaguely"" part). Maybe it's apt that Rebecca whimsically coins the whole thing ""Christmukkah.""

Would you like a slice of that 1930s newsroom screwball? In His and Her Christmas (2005), Dina Meyer and David Sutcliffe are terrific in reviving that classic feud between two reporters who don't give an inch but inevitably fall in love. Meyer and Sutcliffe channel Hepburn & Tracy (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Woman-of-the-Year/dp/B00004TJOE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Woman of the Year</a>, 1942), Elizabeth Perkins and Kevin Bacon (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/He-Said-She-Said/dp/B00005NVDG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">He Said, She Said</a>, 1991), and even Julia Roberts and Nick Nolte (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Love-Trouble/dp/6305428395/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I Love Trouble</a>, 1994).

Or maybe you prefer a madcap comedy of manners. Wendie Malick and Cynthia Stevenson drive this narrative. Will You Merry Me? (2008) plays up the anxiety attached not only to meeting your intended's parents for the first time but also in trying to find that common ground - or at least a neutral zone - between two conflicting life styles. Malick and Stevenson are so very funny as the two moms stubbornly at cross purposes. I love Malick's under-her-breath sarcasm and Stevenson's frequent freak outs. The kids initially just want to get married, but then their parents' influence begin to make them second guess. Can Rebecca and Henry hurdle the obstacles of warring cultures and holiday traditions? Meanwhile, the dads are mostly chill. I say ""mostly"" because Mr. Kringle does obsess about the house decorating contest. I have three favorite quotes from this one. One is the above ""Cheese can smile?"" There's Malick's ""In the town of crazy, you're the mayor!"" (Guess who she was talking to?) And then there's the family dinner where the families were debating the where and what and who of the wedding, and a Kringle remarks: ""Rabbi? I don't think that's going to work. Henry isn't circumcised."" Oh, yeah, that's uncomfortable.

Huh. It just hit me that, of these two, His and Her Christmas may be the more family appropriate movie, if you're planning on watching these with the ankle-biters. For those wondering, yes, there is some sexual innuendo in Will You Merry Me?",1387843200,,6931,5.219227313566936

I like Christmas movies anyway, but ""His & Her Christmas"" had a fun storyline.  His view versus her opinion...the ""Adam's Rib"" of the newsworld.  Like Tracy & Hepburn, Sutcliffe & Meyer play off of each other like the masters.  There were a lot of immature ploys, but all in all, it was entertaining.
  ""Will You Merry Me"" was good.  It was the lesson for anyone that thinks they know their partner well enough. Just take them home for Christmas.

Other things that cause it to be non-family friendly-- lots of references to sex - ""getting busy"", rating past sexual partners, etc.  Why can't they just keep that stuff out so that ppl's minds can stay pure and a nice feel-good movie can be shared by the whole family - children and all.

I wrote Lifetime, the producers and the production company trying to get a copy of it. Last year (2010) Lifetime didn't even show this movie on the network, only on computer.  The story is about a guy and a girl who both work for newspapers in Northern California. He's a lifestyle reporter and she is an advice reporter (Miss Lonelyhearts).  The guy's company is larger and the company he works for buys the local newspaper she works for.  She gets upset and changes her column into a local lifestyle column and they both write about Christmas from the male and female point of view (His and Her Christmas).  They scabble, but ultimately fall in love. Will You Merry Me is a Christmas Romantic's Bonus Movie.  It's a Christian guy and a Jewish girl fall in love and all the craziness that ensues as they try to bring their families together.  Ah Christmas.... I think that I'm going to look at it right now!",1326758400,5,1007,4.46448087431694

I recommend this and will be one of my ""30 days of Christmas"" movies I will watch over and over. The other DVD in the set was filmed in Fort Langley,BC~ my old hometown, so a nice reminder of the past.
