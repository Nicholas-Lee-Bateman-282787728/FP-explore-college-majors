8625302,1,B00GO55O2E,"I'll be honest and say that as I wasn't terribly keen on the original movie finding it to be too slow, bland, lacking in gore and nudity both, way too talky, and especially characterless; I figured that this version would have to be the savings grace somehow.  Well after watching this version, as it happens it just wasn't to be.

This movie had dull, flat characters that I honestly didn't give a crap about, really poor gore effects, no cool kill scenes, a chase scene including the camera constantly panning left to right in a dizzying manner, very little nudity, no memorable characters, slow, plodding and decidedly boring scenes, painstakingly slow deaths, a killer ripping off Billy from Black Christmas by talking to people over the phone in a creepy manner, everything the killer says through that voice machine was totally incoherent, a dull discussion of the will scene that took too long, poorly lit dark scenes(night time or with little light) that made it near impossible to see what was going on, this movie totally lacked egregiously in any kind of camp, humor, or fun, one of the characters is born out of incest, and it had an ending that is both upsetting as it is bland.

Overall, if you're into such Christmas horror classics as: Silent Night, Deadly Night parts 1-5, Black Christmas(1974), Two Front Teeth, To All A Good Night, Christmas Evil, Santa Claws, Satan Claws, Don't Open Til' Christmas, Saint Nick, Gremlins, or even Blood Beat, I mean if you like any of those well then this one will just leave you disappointed for sure.",1450224000,,1555,4.773234200743494

8625305,1,B00GO55O2E,"This review is based solely on the dvd cover art, and not the film itself, which I have been unable to watch yet since I just received it.
DO NOT BUY THIS DVD. DVD COVER ART IS NOT ACCURATE. I purchased this item because I love the rare original that this film is a remake of. I had read multiple unfavorable reviews for this film, but still purchased it because if nothing else, the cover art with the killer standing in the snow in front of the house is amazing. However, this it NOT the cover art you get with the DVD. The cover art that came with the film is hideous and makes the film look like a bootleg. When I contacted Amazon immediately about this, they said that other customers have had the same complaints and could provide no explanation as to why they have the wrong cover art posted on their website. very unhappy!",1415059200,,830,4.292993630573249
8625306,1,B00GO55O2E,"Several months ago, I obtained an import copy of this DVD through Amazon.uk thinking that it was, in some way, related to Theodore Gershuny's 1972 classic 'Silent Night, Bloody Night' (which, unfortunately, has yet to receive a proper release in any format). The product description provided practically no information regarding the film, but I decided to take a chance...
Well, now I am writing this friendly review as a warning to anyone who is thinking of wasting their time and/or money on this rubbish.
Yes, it is related to the original film in that it completely steals the plot (practically word for word and shot for shot) with only a couple of minor (and uninteresting) variations WITHOUT giving credit to the original writers (Theodore Gershuny, Jeffrey Konvitz and Ira Teller) or acknowledging the 1972 version in any way!
The writing credits are instead given to plagiarists Andrew Jones and James Plumb (who also directed).
Also, this wretchedness is a shot-on-video production with what looks like a 99 budget, terrible acting and totally uninspired production values.
Do yourself a favor and instead obtain a copy of the original (there are many editions floating around) which, even with the atrocious picture and sound quality, it is a far better investment than this muck.
As a film lover approaching fifty years of age who was weaned on the classics of cinema and knows a good piece of celluloid when they see it, trust me when I say that 'Silent Night Bloody Night: The Homecoming' is unwatchable dreck.
Any true film scholar would have to agree that film as an art form is (sadly) dead and this turkey is an all-too-perfect example of its disgrace.
Thank you for lending me your time and reading this review.",1388880000,23,1730,4.928082191780822
