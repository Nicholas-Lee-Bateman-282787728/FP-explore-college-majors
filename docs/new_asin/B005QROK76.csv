8483721,5,B005QROK76,"I only knew the basics of the Sartana franchise when I picked this up: a hybrid gunslinger/hard-boiled detective/magician/James-Bondian mystery man, played by the cool-as-a-cucumber-in-a-black-cloak Gianni Garko, who goes around tracking down ill-gotten cash and riding off into the credits with a heavy load of the long green, leaving behind a pile of perforated badmen. Turns out that's almost all you need to know. But it's all carried off with such cool, such charm, such witty reworking of western tropes that I'm left scratching my head why Sartana isn't a ""name"" to audiences here in the States.

Throughout the film's twists and turns, Sartana tries to work out who double-crossed who over $500K in gold and 2 mil in counterfeit bills, while making sure the interested parties stay at each other's throats. If the storyline gets a little byzantine here and there, remember that Sartana is deeply committed to making sure no evildoers live to see the end credits, and if he can get them to take care of each other, that's even better.

In between, Sartana trades some witticisms, remains suave as hell, pulls off amazing feats of sharpshooting and sports a mean set of threads. What more do you want from a main character, people? Oddly, while he seems like he'd probably be a ladies man...there aren't many ladies in the Sartana flicks beyond the occasional evil widow or painted saloon girl. The only exception to this is the romantic interest in the previous Sartana film, HAVE A GOOD FUNERAL MY FRIENDS...SARTANA WILL PAY. In that one Sartana reveals he's just as good with the ladies as he is with everything else.

For most of the first half, this movie is fairly standard western stuff, with a few nifty atmospheric touches - the bizarre prison-planet style jail and a blowgun, for example. But about 45 minutes in, when we meet the maniacal General Monk, things go psychotronic. LIGHT THE FUSE... is probably as radical a mutation as the genre could experience without becoming another species entirely, and it stands just on this side of the line the ""Trinity"" films and their offspring drew and crossed.

This is the final ""official"" Sartana film, and a little more playful than most of the others, but I can't think of any film series that went out on such a strong note. HA HA ""NOTE!"" You'll see what I mean when you get to the end of the film, which I strongly recommend you do asap, by way of the beginning and middle. They really *snicker* PULL OUT ALL THE STOPS for this one. The scene to which I am annoyingly indirectly referring was one I'd heard about a few years back, that made me decide I could do without Sartana - how wrong I was! Even knowing what was coming, my jaw dropped and my hands clapped as Sartana dispensed musical justice. Trust me and watch the movie. Do it. It's a wonderfully badass scene of absurdist cinema that winks at all that has gone before (especially the original DJANGO and the Bond films), and puts its own twist on it, making it all its own.",1400716800,2,3000,4.719465648854962
8483722,5,B005QROK76,"I actually discovered G. Garko through Star Odyssey, one of the best under rated sci-fi films of the century. Really. So to go from that to his western movies period was strange for me. Never the less he is great in this genera and i look forward to viewing all of his Sartana roles..",1380931200,,284,4.277777777777778
