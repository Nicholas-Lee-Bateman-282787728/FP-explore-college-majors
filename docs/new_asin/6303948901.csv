Soundtrack dates this watchable movie. Main characters are a little overplayed, nevertheless lovers of wilderness escapades might find this worth watching. The rather brutal and gory scenes might be of concern to parents of younger children and I would not describe this movie as representative of the behaviour of Wolves. However, this adds to the plot where those villainous characters ultimately meet a bloody end at the jaws of the Wolf, suggesting some sense of a 'primeval' redemption, true only in the darkest fears of Man.",1241395200,,669,6.362637362637362
