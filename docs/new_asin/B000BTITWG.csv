2441273,3,B000BTITWG,"The movie itself gets at least 4 stars from me but the transfer quality only 2 at best. It's a shame that this seriously under-rated film met with such little success when it was first released. It was retitled ""The Great Spy Mission"" after MGM thought that its original name was giving people the impression that they were about to see a Robin Hood type of adventure film! Loosely based on a true story, this is a well-made thriller that's intelligently scripted, fast-paced and with a nice balance of tension and big bangs. The perfomances are good, especially by Sophia Loren and the ever-reliable Anthony Quayle. It's a highly enjoyable and entertaining picture so it's all the more shameful that its first DVD release turns out to be on a second-rate DVD transfer. The menus are absolutely basic (only four chapters) and with no extras of any kind. I wouldn't care about any of the window-dressing if only they'd have given me a high quality print. This is not the kind of DVD quality we'd expect from an MGM production: a grainy print with below standard colour and sharpness and with light leakage on the right side of the projection screen. It's most obvious in the blackouts where much of the screen is a much lighter grey fading to black. It's still watchable but it's clearly a quick and cheap release aimed at making someone a fast buck. This film deserves better. I can only hope that we get a full DVD studio quality release at sometime in the future. Good movie but the DVD could have - should have been much better. One big thing it has going for it is the low sticker price. I'd have been really ticked off if this cheapie had been released at a studio price.
REVISED - Aug 29 2006: It has just been announced that this film will be released at full studio-quality on Dec 19 2006. Good news indeed!",1137974400,7,1815,4.536585365853658
2441274,1,B000BTITWG,After reading the opinions on the poor quality of the DVD release of this film I'm inclined to agree with the others that rented this DVD. I have the MGM release on laserdisk which is a far more superb picture quality on widescreen format with the begining and ending credits along with a documentary of the V-1 rocket. I am now persuaded to hang on to my laserdisk copy. I'm sure there are bootleg copies out there that with a better clearity and make a laughing stock out of the DVD original.,1137801600,7,494,4.380434782608695
2441275,1,B000BTITWG,"How do you rate something this bad!  Not the movie itself, but this sorry excuse for a DVD.  I thought I was getting an official MGM release, but instead I got a very cheap poor quality transfer.  Just wait to see this movie on Turner Classic Movies, or wait until MGM decides to release the movie themselves, which I hope is real soon.",1137801600,14,336,4.301587301587301
2441276,1,B000BTITWG,"I remember seeing 'Operation Crossbow' in the late '60s soon after it came out. Resplendent with MGM's roaring lion logo and the superb Panavision presentation - on which basis I bought this newly issued DVD.  What a let down. Only a 4x3 format and a pretty fuzzzy transfer, despite the cover proclaimation of a 'digital'mastering'. No opening logo - straight into the main title and only 4 chapters to the entire film. No extras, not even a trailer. Atleast it could have been issued in the original Panavision format. Barely worth 1-star. A total waste of money",1137715200,6,563,4.804123711340206
2441277,1,B000BTITWG,"I rented this DVD and found the production to be choppy, have blurry video and sub-text, and missing any openings and closing of the film. The overall quality is quite poor such that it is worse than the VHS version I recorded for myself several years ago. I expected a superior quality recording but only got an extremely amateurish attempt not up to the expected quality I have seen in other DVD releases of older films. I had intended to buy a copy of this DVD but will not now. How unfortunate!!",1137110400,21,499,4.434782608695652

8092552,3,B000BTITWG,Basically have to agree with all the U.S.A. guys. The picture quality on the D.V.D.was very poor indeed. The movie itself was amazing and George Peppard was one of my favourite actors. Maybe one day it will come out in Blu Ray format and then we are talking.,1437782400,,258,4.395833333333333

This DVD is a poor quality copy, but I still enjoyed it nonetheless.",1380931200,,162,4.225806451612903

8092556,3,B000BTITWG,"I gave it a 3 star not because of the movie but because of the print used. It looks as if it was taped from a VHS version. It is not bad at all but it could have been better. You can't expect much for $7.99.

Unless you want to own a copy on DVD very badly, wait until a major studio like MGM releases it. I think MGM has the rights.",1140480000,,333,3.625
8092557,1,B000BTITWG,"I saw this film a few weeks ago in German TV, and decided to buy the DVD. As the film is not available in Europe, I ordered it in the US.

But what a shock! I have never seen such a disastrous DVD - poorest picture quality with blurred colours, lines and subtitles (only available for German-spoken parts). The sound is dull. It is like watching a film in a very old TV set. Or even worse...

Therefore: DO NOT BUY THIS DVD!!! Even if you adore the film!",1139529600,3,454,4.089887640449438
8092558,1,B000BTITWG,I preordered this one which is from the same company which released From hell To Victory. FHTV was a bad transfer to dvd. Anybody order Attack Force Z ? That one looks like somebody made the copies in a basement. How a reputable company like Amazon can sell such poor products is beyond me.,1139356800,3,290,4.388888888888889
8092559,1,B000BTITWG,"I am very glad that I read the reviews for this DVD.

Fortunately it gave me time to cancel my order for this item. So thanks to Amazon for providing this feature.

But I must agree with everything that the reviewers have said. WHAT A WASTE !

This was a really excellent film which would warrant at the very least a 4 star rating - but any film should be transferred to DVD in it's original screen ratio - as any true film enthusiast would agree - and in addition the copy needs to be taken from the very best source material available,and ""cleaned up"" where necessary.

Extra features in the case of this film could include some original footage of the Peenemunde Rocket Sites and in addition perhaps a documentary about the testing of them.

The company who produced this copy however,should really not be in the DVD business. As another reviewer has said, they are obviously just out to make a fast buck with a total disregard for picture quality or anything else. I feel sorry for the people who have,in effect,been ""ripped off"" by this company.

The film was shown here on Turner Classic Movies some months back in wide screen and top picture quality,but I still really want to get a copy of this film on DVD,so I can only hope,like the other reviewers,that a more reputable and more professional company (MGM perhaps) will eventually produce it on DVD and do the film justice.

So MGM take note - it would appear that you have a ready market out there.",1138579200,11,1459,4.503787878787879
8092560,1,B000BTITWG,"What a waste!

I've loved this movie since first seeing it in the theater back in the 60's.

I own the Laser Disc, which MGM did a fairly good job with.

But this DVD is a joke. It's grainy, fuzzy and the beginning credits are cut out! It's also in full screen -- why --considering the original film was made in 70mm.

The audio is also another disappointment. The Laser Disc has surround sound, yet this muddy transfer to DVD is only 2.0.

I'm hanging on to my Laser Disc until Trinity Entertainment comes to its senses and re-releases this movie in better condition.",1138147200,10,568,4.423076923076923
