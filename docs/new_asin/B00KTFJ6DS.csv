6446088,3,B00KTFJ6DS,"Not for us because we just couldn't get past the quality of the animation and the stories that we just didn't like. We thought it might be cool to see the original and this is a cheap set for 65 episodes, but we will be trading this one in for sure. If you're kids are fans of the Friendship is Magic version of MLP, perhaps see if you can watch some of the old episodes on TV or PPV first, because you might be wasting your money. My daughter watched 5 episodes and I had to force her to watch that many.",1412121600,3,505,3.9607843137254903
6446089,5,B00KTFJ6DS,"If you'd told me two years ago that I'd be a fan of My Little Pony, we would've had words. But once I took the plunge into FiM, I learned a really valuable lesson about passing judgement on a show before seeing it. It only seemed fair to give G1 a chance.

It took me a while to get into G1. At first there were so many 80's animation pitfalls that just couldn't be ignored. If you're familiar with a lot of 80's animation, you know what I mean. It really isn't any better or worse than most animation from the 80's. But let's just say it took me a while to get into it and I can see why some bronies rather not give it a chance.

But if you give it a while, give it a good solid chance, you'll find that G1 does have a charm all its own. It can be downright dark and forboding. One look at ""Rescue at Midnight Castle,"" ""Return of Tambelon"" among others can be downright creepy. But then you also have the more light hearted episodes as well.

Over all, give it a while to sink in. If you're used to FiM and other cartoons of today, there's a bit of culture shock to get used to. But if you give it a chance, you should find something about it you like.

Just a couple notes. ""Rescue at Midnight Castle"" and ""Escape From Catrina"" aired as specials before the series proper started. They were later edited down quite a bit and aired later in the final season. The versions on this collection are the edited down versions.

Also, while the video quality is certainly better than the VHS rips you'll probably find on Youtube and it seems cleaned up rather nicely for this DVD release, it's still definetly 80's animation and could only be cleaned up so much.

Still, a solid release. If you're a brony, you've already taken the plunge to decide you liked FiM. I highly encourage you to take another plunge and really give G1 a chance.",1412035200,28,1831,4.232091690544412
6446090,5,B00KTFJ6DS,"First of all, this was my FAVORITE show growing up!  I am a mother of 4 now and my children share my love of ponies.  My children have a FEW of the Original G1 episodes on DVD so I was VERY excited to find out about this new Complete Series release of this classic cartoon!

The DVD list of episodes was posted verbatim from the website mentioned above.  I know quite a few of you have been wondering which episodes this series includes, so hopefully this has helped some of you out.  If I find out anything further, as far as cut or uncut information, I will be sure to edit this post for all to read.

Thank you for your time!  God Bless and take care!

[EDIT 10/09/14]
I meant to post this a few days ago, but I thought I would let everyone know that this My Little Pony Series Set is CUT UP!  If you were hoping for the originally aired SPECIALS of ""Rescue From Midnight Castle"" and ""Escape From Catrina"" with the memorable songs, ""Little Piece Of Rainbow"" (Rescue From Midnight Castle) and ""Those Good Old Days (Before You Went Bad)"" (Escape From Catrina), you will be heartbroken to know, they were cut up yet AGAIN :-(  A few of us have actually talked about it in the COMMENTS for this review. So sorry to disappoint anyone.  This still is worth buying if you want a collection of all the episodes for yourself, your children or someone else you know that might enjoy the Classic ORIGINAL My Little Ponies.

Take Care and God Bless.",1409011200,102,3948,4.388736263736264

The voice actors sound EXACTLY the same and I had to check on IMDB to see if it was really them.

6446159,4,B00KTFJ6DS,"The classic My Little Pony series is a lighthearted action-adventure series with very little violence. The animation is about average for the 80s, which is to say usually adequate but with the occasional animation error. The writing is above average for the era, with many surprising plot twists; however it is weighed down somewhat by the huge cast, which makes it difficult for the writers to flesh out very many of the characters and for the viewers to keep track of them all. Note that while part of the same franchise, this series has a very different look, feel, and storyline from ""My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic"".

This collection contains the entire original series, except for ""My Little Pony the Movie"". It is worth noting however that the versions of the two My Little Pony specials, ""Rescue at Midnight Castle"" and ""Escape from Catrina"" are the versions used in reruns, and as such are lacking several scenes from their original broadcast; also they are on disc 4, which might be confusing to new viewers (these episodes occurred prior to season 1 and the Movie).",1438214400,,1081,4.8432432432432435

I can only assume the master had been damaged judging from the section. It's not bad enough to ruin it or make it unwatchable but a buyer should be made aware. Otherwise it's a pretty decent collection. It's missing some of the later episodes that were aired as part of a different show which I belive was under a slighly different title (probably the reasoning for their omission.)",1432339200,,533,4.34

I gave this only 4 stars because there were songs in some of the original episodes that were cut out. i'm only aware of a few for certain, but it makes me wonder how many more I'm missing. I bought the disc with Escape from Catrina and other episodes hoping it would have the songs, but it didn't.

6446182,5,B00KTFJ6DS,"So many parents are so afraid of their kids watching TV.  And I admit---most TV is probably not good for your mind, whether child or adult.  However like any rule, there are exceptions.

Some TV shows like Sesame Street have shown real benefits in subsequent testing of kids.  The My Little Pony series, as far as I know, was not tested in the same way that Sesame Street was, but in moderate doses I think this is great for kids, if they like it--LET THEM WATCH!

The complete series has 4 discs, sixty some episodes.  At an episode a day or less, that can stretch out quite a while.  Our grandson as young as 4 months old found them soothing when he was unconsoleable by anything else.  Our grand daughter age 4 loves watching them.  They're bright, cheery, gentle, introduce kids to nice music and probably to some new vocabulary.

While the singing is a little cheesy it's a great show. However, for a kid's show it's very dark. I suggest watching it with your kids because as a kid this would have given me nightmares. You can tell these were originally vhs tapes. Unfortunately it does not come with subtitles. All in all, I highly recommend it! I just started disk 2.

I remember collecting and playing with My Little Pony toys as a kid.  I don't recall watching the show much though.  Fortunately with the helpful DVD set My Little Pony Classic TV Collection, I can relive my childhood and be reminded of how animation has vastly improved since the eighties.  :)  The lessons of helping others and treasuring friendship are timeless and my kids enjoyed watching the 4 disc set.

Each disc is approximately 3 hours, so there's twelve hours of entertainment to be had.  My daughters and (surprisingly) my son enjoyed watching the show.

6446202,5,B00KTFJ6DS,"For years finding this series was nearly impossible: it was only available in copies of copies from decaying VHSes or in long out-of-print collections, and even those had badly compressed video.  No longer.

The quality of the episodes I have watched so far is crystal clear.  It is obvious that the people who made this collection cared enough to go back to the archival copies and make fresh, high-resolution transfers of all the episodes.  If I have any complaint about the DVDs themselves, it is that the collection does not include the uncut versions of the original two specials.  Overall, though, this is the nicest release that this series has ever had.  Now if only we could get a new DVD release for Tales...

I grew up long after this series finished airing and did not watch it until I was in my 20s, so I hold absolutely no nostalgia when I say this series is truly amazing.  It has the kind of charm that only low-budget cartoons from the 1980s have, and succeeded despite its low budget and early cancellation.  Without this series, My Little Pony would have been a very different franchise.",1420243200,,1106,4.65979381443299

6446208,4,B00KTFJ6DS,"This is a good budget release. I bought it thinking I could replace my several disc/ugly box art Rhino release. Sadly the two specials (Rescue and Escape) are still the edited versions which is why the score wouldn't be 5 stars. The Rhino release is much cleaner and nicer as far as video quality. This version looks like it was taken straight from a vhs. It's not terrible by any means, but when compared side by side, the Rhino release was the clear winner. If you don't have the series already, or are a fan of FiM, then this is a great way to see the first series without hunting down the pricey box set or the individual DVD releases.",1418688000,4,639,4.333333333333333
6446209,5,B00KTFJ6DS,"Seriously... Give G1 a chance! If you got into G4, this is your foundation, your origin. Give it some respect. Yes, it suffers from the abysmal quality of 80s era animation and voice acting. Plots can be disjointed or downright silly, but the series tries to do something that back then, was new. You had rainbows and unicorns and ponies and colorful flowers... and red and black centaurs kidnaping ponies and transforming them into beasts to pull his chariot, threats of decapitation, and the evil goal of a night that never ends. Sonambula stole youth, and there were other baddies too. The series was perfectly capable of being dark when it wanted to. At this price, it's practically a steal! If you love My Little Pony, then give this a shot. Not everyone cares for G1, but at least show MLP's elders some respect! :)

I gave G1 a chance, and I actually very much enjoyed it! It was a little girls show that tried to incorporate adventure and danger into it. Later on in the series, corporate interests shifted it to a ""happier"" direction, but that first season... Totally worth it, even if you only ever watch it once.",1417737600,7,1123,4.615

You'll enjoy revisiting with the Baby Ponies, Firefly, Spike and the (rather snobby and almost bitchy) Princess Ponies as well as accident-prone-Meghan as they fight sludge-monsters, evil lobsters and help save Flutter Valley and hang out with the Sea Ponies, Bush Woolies and Mr Moochik.

6446217,3,B00KTFJ6DS,"First I'd like to note that the low rating is ONLY for having learned that the two specials (""Rescue at Midnight Castle"" and ""Escape From Catrina"" are still the EDITED versions, the same as on the other recent MLP DVD titled ""Escape From Catrina and other Adventures"", as the uncut versions have not been seen/released since the 80s as VHS rentals. So disappointing.

Does anybody know if the song ""Hurry"" is included in part 4 of ""The Glass Princess""? This was cut when aired on the Disney channel in the early 90s and has not been seen since.

But I really wanted to respond to those fans (of ""Friendship Is Magic"") who are still new to MLP by comparison, who have been describing the original (G1) MLP series as ""culture shock""...as a MLP fan/collector since 1983, you may be surprised to know that it works both ways, with each new generation, and I recall using very similar words when ""Friendship Is Magic"" was first announced in 2010.

Now in 2014, looking forward to season 5, I could not imagine my life without Pinkie Pie, Fluttershy, the Apple family, Princess Celestia and the incredible world of Equestria that has become a definitive and beloved part of the MLP universe and history, beyond anything that I could have ever foreseen.

Seeing Princess Twilight Sparkle battle Tyrek, the original villain from the 1984 special ""Rescue At Midnight Castle"" in the season 4 finale ""Twilight's Kingdom"" 30 years later, there can be no better time to close the gap between MLP of the past and present...and future.

6446218,4,B00KTFJ6DS,"I like it but it does have a few flaws. I grew up watching this show in the 80s and playing with the toys, this set does have some minor flaws, I don't know how many since I haven't taken the time to watch every dvd but I've noticed that the intro animation's moves a little fast, just seems kinda off. rescue from midnight castle and escape from catrina had songs cut and while I do understand that they had to do it to fit space, it makes little sense to have them at all when they have those specials on another set entirely. And I don't know if it's just my copy, but on the second part of Princess Pony Quest the sound cut out at the beginning for a few seconds.

Other then that? Good feelings all around. Can't believe they managed to squeeze every episode onto 4 disks and I'm not disappointed with this purchase.

6446219,3,B00KTFJ6DS,"This is not a complete set. Far from it! When you state it as a complete set that means it's uncut original episodes. That's not the case here. Episodes are out of sync. The specials came first, then the main series. Yet for some unknown reason these specials are on the last Disc. Seriously? And the specials are heavily edited when they are not suppose to be. And let's not forget that Shout Factory didn't really put a lot of effort into cleaning up the episodes. Which explains why the set is only $20.00. Why couldn't they give this series the same treatment that they gave Jem? and Transformers? I usually love Shout Factory's releases. This is a first disappointment.
