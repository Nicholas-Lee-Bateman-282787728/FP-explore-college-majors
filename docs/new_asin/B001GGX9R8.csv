8305333,5,B001GGX9R8,"I've been a fan of The Wildhearts for years now. From their debut release, ""Earth Vs. The Wildhearts"", through their latest release, ""Chutzpa"". They never disappoint. This DVD is rear and out of print, but for those of us lucky enough to acquire it, it's a gem. They play their 2007, self titled, and in my opinion, MASTERPIECE CD, ""The Wildhearts"", in it's entirety, live in the Apollo 8 Studios. The sound is obviously studio quality. The camera work is beautiful. You also get to see the band's personality and humor come out both in between songs and in interviews as well as on screen captioning. If you are a Wildhearts fan, it's a MUST HAVE.  CHEERS!",1375833600,,657,4.615384615384615

Personally, I can begin by saying that they are my all-time favourite band and the finest example of rock music this world has seen. Their eponymous 2007 album strayed from the pop-oriented '... Must Be Destroyed!' album and boasts longer songs with far more complex song structure. Along with a top album comes this DVD featuring the band performing 'live in the studio'. The clean, crisp sounds of a studio setting are allowed to shine through as the boys play through every song off the album.

The best bits, however, are of course the banter between the band members in between song performances. Ginger's comedic gold never ceases to make you laugh and the chemistry between Ging, CJ, Ritchie, and Scott is incredibly entertaining. One of the best things about this film is that the fun these lads are having playing in the studio is evident, which projects onto the viewer and (with a good stereo system) it will feel like you're in the studio with them.

The extras on the DVD feature the music videos for 'The New Flesh' and 'Destroy All Monsters' as well as a humorous ""extra"" from Ritch. What sticks out is the fascinating 10-minute 'Making of the ""Destroy All Monsters"" video' - weak stomachs beware, if you've seen the music video before you will know why.

The quality of the film itself is very professional looking, very clear, and the sound is as epic as the band.

Overall, Tim Smith did an excellent job filming The Wildhearts and my only complaint is that the film wasn't days long because I never tire of them and listening to the brilliant music. Undoubtedly, every Wildhearts fan should own this DVD.
