8566547,5,B00BD3NOS8,"I bought a multi region Samsung DVD player exclusively to buy and play these more obscure cartoons that have not been released in the U.S. I paid under 50 bucks for the recorder. If you don't have a player that plays region 2 disks DONT BUY THIS. The seller was gracious enough to send me a confirmation email. Obviously many people don't read the description and then complain and want to return when it won't play on their basic US DVD player. Foolish.
  This is a great collection and took me back to my childhood. Each episode is entertaining and usually has a good villain. Sometimes characters that are rarely found in animated form, such as Shana or Swarm make appearances. The representation of Doctor Doom was pretty satisfying, with good voice effect. Ms. Lion (the dog) is slightly annoying, but not nearly as bad as Snarf from Thundercats or Orko from He-Man. For years and years when reading Spiderman comics, I imagined Spidey's voice as that of the voice actor from this cartoon. Very Satisfied.
Next on the List of PAL toons is all the 60's Marvel toons I can find, The Banana Splits and Blackstar. It also seems that the 90's Spiderman, Iron Man and X-Men toons are better represented in PAL format (with full seasons instead of a hodge podge).",1462233600,,1261,4.650224215246637

8566550,5,B00BD3NOS8,"This is an AMAZING SET! I am very pleased with it. You will not find better quality than this out there, of this series. Avoid bootlegs and torrents and videos on tube sites. Just get the real thing. My kids love the team work shown between Iceman, FIrestar, and Spidey.

I purchased a really inexpensive DVD player by Memorex (Model MVD2016 I think) that plays ANY region just to watch this set. Then my son showed me I didn't have to. Apparently a free program online called VLC media player plays any region DVD right in your computer. I have a HD flat screen TV hooked up to my PC via HDMI and that works out perfect we never even use a ""traditional DVD player"" anymore.

I know it's sad that ""they"" (Whoever that is) don't release good shows like this in the US. Even though we are the ones who produced and aired the shows first, it's other countries like the UK that get spectacular boxed sets while we get nothing.
I don't know what reason for this is. But maybe if we start buying more complete collections here they will release more.

If you were a fan of 80's cartoons then you are a fan of this show and for any fan this is worth it. I couldn't wait for this to possibly maybe come out one day.

OH and if you speak Dutch, or Spanish, or French, or German, or Ukrainian then you will be pleased to know they have  6 additional languages other than English included as Subtitles or Audio and sometimes both.  This is a great gift for a person who speaks another language. If they ever release this set in the US you can bet it won't have as many languages on it.

The sound is in Dolby Digital Stereo. And the screen is cropped 4:3 which is exactly how it aired when I watched on TV in CA in 1985.",1411084800,5,1709,4.207951070336391
