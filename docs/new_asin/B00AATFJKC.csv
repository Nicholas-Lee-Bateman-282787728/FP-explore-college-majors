5407533,5,B00AATFJKC,"The Brits have the knack to create the detective/miurder TV series that actually makes you think. Sure there are some formulas, but the stories always seem to have the twist that you don't see in US TV

5407581,5,B00AATFJKC,"Although he does still have a few ""inappropriate adjustments"" in public, this season's Dalziel seems to be much less crass and more compassionate. Perhaps his brush with mortality is giving him a good think. Excellent series, particularly fine cinematography and landscapes this season.",1366588800,2,286,5.674418604651163

5407583,4,B00AATFJKC,"I love most the british mystery series like Midsummer, Foyles War, Morse and Case Histories and this one is also special.

5407585,5,B00AATFJKC,"This show tends to vary as to quality in its different seasons but this Season Seven collection of SIX episodes is as full and vibrant as they come!!  Not
only great acting with beautiful scenery but also excellent plots which all are
quite complex and satisfying to the viewer.",1363996800,2,278,4.673469387755102

8549374,4,B00AATFJKC,"Great series...ok Amazon, where are 2 missing episodes? It skips episode 3 and 4 and goes to episode 5...And where are the rest of the seasons? Paying for both Acorn and Britbox- should not be missing..",1530316800,,202,4.638888888888889

8549380,4,B00AATFJKC,"Warren Clarke is really great in this show.  I wish the Seasons were complete.  The finale for Season 7 is a two part but does not seem to be in these collection.  I felt like other episodes were missing as well as I made way through the seasons.  There are 5 more seasons any chance those will become available for the U.S. audience.  I know this series is ""old"" but really good and I hope the remaining episodes will soon appear.",1510444800,4,431,4.271604938271605
