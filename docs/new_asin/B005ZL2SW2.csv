If you or your child is on drugs, then you've found the right movie. This guide will help you see that the absence of parents in the education of a child can cause tragedies in the future. This is real and it happens every day in families where parents are more interested in your business. ""this is to give a better future for my son,"" Is that better than investing time with them? Ask them if they prefer that you work hard to give him the best video game or come home early from work and play, Love, cuddle, talk, have quality time?
The best for him, is you Father, mother ...
God is faithful and powerful and he can help you fix it, ask Him, pray, read the Bible and God does the impossible happen.
""1 Corinthians 3:18 Do not deceive yourselves. If any of you think you are wise by the standards of this age, you should become ""fools"" so that you may become wise. 19 For the wisdom of this world is foolishness in God's sight. As it is written: ""He catches the wise in their craftiness""",1340582400,,1024,4.310880829015544
4910913,5,B005ZL2SW2,"I rented this movie at a local Redbox, and watched it twice myself before renting it again for the family to see (2 teenagers and my husband). God used this film in a mighty way, and I believe this film can be life-changing. I saw the change in my teenage son immediately. The lead is a boy who was brought up in a Christian home with a God-fearing, prayer warrior mom, and a busy, absent father. The film chronicles the boy as he grows up to become a teenager, and opens the ""door"" to the enemy through drugs, rock and roll and the occult-since his ""mentor"" is an occultic rock star. There is music that the teenagers will enjoy hearing, but the message is clear. God fearing moms-this is a spiritual battle for your kids souls. Through prayer, the enemy is defeated. Without giving away the ending, God prevails. This movie lets a teen know that the battle for their soul is real, and that we can't wrestle this battle in our flesh, but must do so in the spiritual realm.
 This was one of the best Christian films I have seen and had the most powerful message for each of us. Moms, kids, dads. It is encouraging for those of us who have teenagers, and gives us hope and faith that God is in control, and that we must be on our knees in serious prayer for our kids.
 Unfortunately this film has not been promoted in the US market, and I hope throught the redbox rentals, more will watch it. It is a great evangelism tool since there is clearly a point that the lead character is born again. I highly recommend this film and came to Amazon to purchase a few copies to share with others. Make sure you turn on the subtitles for English translation. The fact that the English speaking audience will ahve to read the subtitles, makes them more foused on the movie, and less temptation for distraction.",1339200000,,1798,4.380239520958084
4910914,4,B005ZL2SW2,"I'm not so much into Pablo's music but having met the man, I can testify that he is a very genuine and caring person, with a passion for God. His story is a huge inspiration for me, especially when I think about how God granted him the desires of his heart and now he's out there making an impact with his gift for music and evangelism. This movie however, narrated by Marcos Witt (I think, at least that's who it sounded like), could have used better direction/storyboarding or something like that. Production value was high, but the super-hero, sci-fi battle between good and evil felt TOTALLY out of place. It took away so much from the scene, I was in schock, like ""who on earth thought that scene was a good idea???"" And why did the old lady angel have to turn into a hip superhero wannabe??? The only reason I'm being critical about this is because they should've edited that part out because it didn't flow at all.",1337472000,2,921,4.455621301775148

4910918,4,B005ZL2SW2,esta pelicula es la historia de pablo olivares y como Dios lo salvo en cuerpo y alma es un gran testimonio el cual deveria ser visto por todo joven que no cree en Dios podran ver como Dios obra atravez de la oracion lo unico que yo podria decir es que al final no muestran como es la carrera de Pablo hoy en dia ya que pablo sigue en la musica y sigue en el genero rock pero ahora para Cristo lo cual creeo que es importante ya que el Rock es criticado por muchas personas que no pueden entender que no es el genero lo que hace una cancion mala si no el mensaje y el rock es unos de los generos donde mas cristianos deverian entrar para sacar de la obscuridad a esos jovenes que estan perdidos y el soundtrack de esta pelicula lo recomiendo es de 5 estrellas si les gusta el heavy metal como a mi.,1327536000,,797,3.9875
4910919,4,B005ZL2SW2,"Esta pelcula es muy inesperada.  Siendo una produccin hispana y sobretodo un produccin cristiana; pocos esperan que sea algo de buena calidad.  Sin embargo la pelcula fue muy bien hecha y logra captar atencin y transmir un buen mensaje.  La historia es inspirada en la vida de Pablo Olivares, msico argentino del gnero rock, quien se alej del camino de Dios y se involucr en en cosas ocultas.  Esto le trae xito y forma el grup Halgena.  Despus de aos de oracin y sufrimiento de parte de su madre, Pablo se arrepiente de su pasado y vuelve a Dios.  La calidad cinematogrfica no carece de ninguna manera y las lneas de los actores son muy crebles; nada suena fuera de lugar.  No es libre de errores pero lo bueno le supera a lo malo.  Lo nico que no me gust fue que en el final usan efectos usuales de la pelculas sci-fi.  Comprend el motivo detrs la decisin pero no lo logr muy bien.

Cmprenla y vanla.  Apoyen a estas pelculas para que se siga produciendo ms pelculas de calidad.",1320364800,6,980,4.388888888888889

8489769,5,B005ZL2SW2,"Our youth group watched this film during a movie night. In the past, we've had a hard time getting them to sit still and watch a movie all the way through, but this one had them completely focused. They had a little discussion afterward and they seemed to have received a powerful message through this film. The overwhelming focus was on the forgiveness he eventually experienced. Several girls cried during that scene.",1382659200,,419,4.833333333333333
8489770,5,B005ZL2SW2,"Is great...great message! Good I would totally recommended to buy it. Specially to share with friends and family, co-workers or someone in need.",1380672000,,144,5.304347826086956

8489774,4,B005ZL2SW2,Buena historia sobre este joven que se vuelve rebelde contra su familia y contra Dios.  Que bueno que se dio cuenta a tiempo que Jesus es el unico camino. Que pena que el audio del DVD no se escuchaba bien.,1361404800,,206,4.15
8489775,5,B005ZL2SW2,I didn't know what to expect from this movie but decided to watch it after my brother's recommendation. I don't know Spanish so it took me a minute to figure out how to turn on the English subtitles. The subtitles made me be more tuned into the movie and made me pay attention more. I love the Salvation Poem song. It's beautiful. Anyone who ever felt like they're to far gone should see this. God is always there for us if we would just turn to Him.,1359244800,,450,4.183908045977011
