4232804,5,B003Z6HSFQ,"This DVD release is a MUST for Rush fans! It is amply long (including the bonus stuff), and chock full of great new footage of the band expounding on each other, their music, and illustrious career. There are also industry comments by other notable rock musicians, famous radio DJ's, talk show hosts, 'Rolling Stone' reviewers, etc. But the biggest treat is watching their original producer, Terry Brown and the band dissect (and perform in a studio setting) their great, clockwork masterpieces '2112' and 'Moving Pictures'.  The audio/video quality is top notch, even on the non Blu-Ray version.  It's about time Rush did a 'Classic Albums' DVD, and they do this one justice bigtime.  A huge THANK YOU to Geddy, Alex, and Neil for sharing this with your fans (this 49 year old 'fossil' has been one since 1977).",1286064000,,812,4.869565217391305
4232805,5,B003Z6HSFQ,"That's it really. This is a great and totally worthwhile companion to the recent documentary 'Beyond the Lighted Stage'. In fact, it seems like much of this was filmed after the doc must have been filmed, because it shows more footage of the band with famed producer Terry Brown. It also has some of the other people that were in the doc such as Taylor Hawkins and Cliff Bernstein. A must have for true fans.",1285891200,,408,4.453333333333333
4232806,3,B003Z6HSFQ,If I wasn't a HUGE Rush fan I would have given this 2 stars. There is nothing new here. The interviews seem rushed (no pun intended) and there is no new vintage footage and you just KNOW they got it. Most of it is from Live in Rio concerts with some stuff from the other concert films. There is some Black and White footage and studio footage they provide but my old bootleg VHS tapes look and sound better!!! Dont know where all these 5 star ratings are coming from. Maybe the reviewers havnt heard all these stories before or seen the same old footage before?? I dunno but save your money and just get Beyond the Lighted Stage dvd (which I gave 5 stars as I love Rush!) Anyways-I wish I would have just rented this instead of buying it but I just couldn't resist. Hope this helps somebody out.......................,1285891200,60,817,4.417218543046357
4232807,5,B003Z6HSFQ,"The extra features on the DVD are worth the price alone. It troubles me that two such pivotal albums are combined into one show for TV. I understand it, but both are very different and important albums--for different reasons. I won't reveal spoilers, but there's a good deal of inside stuff that even I as a long-time Rush nut didn't know.",1285891200,3,339,4.573770491803279
4232808,5,B003Z6HSFQ,"Just a stellar documentary on two of the best rock albums, by one of the greatest bands. Where as the doc Beyond the lighted stage covers the band in general you get a little background for reference of the band and in depth looks at 2112 and moving picture. Great interviews and some amazing footage of the group playing parts from the albums.",1285804800,2,344,4.476190476190476
4232809,5,B003Z6HSFQ,This is a note to Greg - can I use your review on my blog?  I love what you said.  I was given a promo copy of the DVD to review and think its definitely a must have for Rush fans.  Let me know.  My blog is called Layla's Classic Rock.,1285804800,,235,3.549019607843137
4232810,5,B003Z6HSFQ,"I don't have much to add to the excellent review that Zoom already wrote, except to say that for the small outlay of cash, I find this DVD a worthwhile addition to my Rush collection.  After recently buying remastered versions of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/2112/dp/B000001ESF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">2112</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Moving-Pictures-Eco-Rpkg/dp/B001DZDTX6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Moving Pictures (Eco) (Rpkg)</a>, and seeing (and buying the DVD of) the excellent documentary,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rush-Beyond-the-Lighted-Stage-Blu-ray/dp/B003JLA4KS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rush: Beyond the Lighted Stage [Blu-ray</a>], I questioned the wisdom of yet one more bit of Rushverse memorabilia.  Turns out I still have more to learn, and I was especially interested in learning more about the connection of the story in 2112 with the Ayn Rand work,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Anthem-Expanded-50th-Anniversary-Edition/dp/0452281253/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Anthem, Expanded 50th Anniversary Edition</a>.  I knew that 2112 was influenced by Rand, but was under the wrong impression about what that influence had been.  That's just an example of the types of revelations on tap in this documentary.

And the guys are as low-key and approachable as ever.  I said it about ""Lighted Stage"" and I'll say it about this Classic Albums DVD...the personalities of the Rush bandmates, and their friendship with each other, and their gonzo commitment to their musical vision, make them extremely attractive as artistic icons, even if some of their music is, let's face it, as annoying as hell.  (But that doesn't apply to anything on the two albums showcased in this documentary--this is cream-of-the-crop Rush.)",1285718400,3,1930,7.293103448275862
4232811,5,B003Z6HSFQ,"This Blu-Ray is essentially the documentary that aired on the Classic Albums TV series. There have been a number of releases for Rush lately from concert footage to documentaries. For a band who is as prolific and influential as they are I say it's high time more stuff has been put out there. While the recently released documentary, Rush: Beyond the Lighted Stage, gives a lot of details spanning their entire career this disk delves into great detail Rush's two most important albums. While the band has released more than 20 albums these two bookend the five albums that defined them as the ultimate power trio and masters of the progressive/art rock genre.

2112 was Rush's fourth (third with drummer Neil Peart) album and it was created out of a mixture of defiance, anger, and pure sense of uncompromising. Their album Fly by Night made critics take notice and Caress of Steel made them disregard the band out of hand. 2112 not only make them take notice again, but it caused a frenzy from just word of mouth. This documentary goes into the thought process behind this. Not only the ""we are gonna do this album our way"" and ""if we are going out we are going on our terms"" kind of thinking, but also the music theory behind the songs written and the long play format of the titular 2112 suite (consisting of an entire side of a vinyl album.

So you have that breakaway album, and then Rush makes a couple more critically acclaimed concept albums, then two albums that take the band to a more radio-friendly arena. This is where Moving Pictures comes in. As the last of the albums of this genre it marks the band's complete departure from the art-rock/long form suites (The album Permanent Waves still had the multi-themed Natural Science) to single concept, self contained songs ready for airplay. This album also marks Rush's greatest hit single to date with Tom Sawyer.

Again this doc goes into not only the thinking of where they were going with Moving Pictures as a band, but also the musicality of the various songs (and studio theories and techniques). It's a good message Rush says when the changes they went through on each of these albums were something they did all for themselves and for the love of music. This documentary really shows how a band can change their (for lack of a better word) shtick and still be true to who they are.

You get some great early footage from studio to concerts and more as well as current interviews with each band member. You get to see the breakdown of many of the songs of each album and how they were put together both instrumentally and post production. You also get interviews with Terry Brown, Rush's studio producer and engineer from both albums and each one in between. All in all this is a great resource for anybody who loves these two albums.

This Blu-Ray has some solid video comprised of the newer interviews and footage done in high definition and older concert footage getting some decent touch up (not as good as the high def stuff, but it's as good as you can get). The video I believe is in 1080i, and while that's not quite full 1080p I think it's probably a better idea so there isn't too much of a difference seen between the older PAL footage. The audio is in Linear PCM Stereo. That may sound like a limiting factor, but you don't really need surround for interviews and the music was recorded in two channel stereo. BTW that music footage sounds awesome on this disk so forget the need for 5.1 anything.

What's cool is the extras, which is about an hour of additional interviews and concert footage not shown in the original airing on Classic Albums. That's like getting twice the show in one disk. If you are a fan of the classic Rush this disk is worth going for. If you are a serious music fan and enjoyed the song Tom Sawyer I think this will be a very informative and enjoyable disk to have in your collection as well. If you have been collecting all of the other Rush videos believe me; there is still stuff in here you don't have.",1284940800,86,4014,4.537292817679558

4232813,4,B003Z6HSFQ,"I've watched the other classic album documentaries and this is one of my favorites.  Rush is by my favorite band and this product does an excellent job of going in depth on my two favorite albums. The only con in my opinion is that they did not cover every song on the albums. For example, they did not examine Lessons on 2112 and they didn't look at any songs from side B of Moving Pictures. I was a little disappointed with that but the rest of the film really does make up for it. Each song is taken more in-depth and I learned more about my favorite songs than I've ever known. The bonus material is a great addition, and it makes the extra dollars worth forking out for the special edition. (I bought it used, so it was only a couple dollars extra) CD copies are also a great addition that makes it a great bundle. Great product overall, perfect for any Rush fan!",1473292800,,868,4.260606060606061

4232816,3,B003Z6HSFQ,"These Classic Albums shows on DVD are very cool for fans of the artist, the specific album, musicians, and those who enjoy rock music history. However, not all of the DVD's are equally good in terms of thorough coverage of the material. This episode focusses on 2 key albums by Rush, 2112 and Moving Pictures. The main show is about 54 minutes long and about 36 minutes are on the 2112 album, so there's barely 20 minutes on Moving Pictures, which is the album I really wanted to see. There is not ample time to cover 2 classic albums, they should have each been given a full episode's time.

However, there is also another 50 minutes of bonus material that covers more material. It is well filmed and Rush's interviews are enlightening and you get to see them demonstrate a lot of their instrumental parts. And the DVD usually sells for only about $10.

Still, as is the case with many of the shows in this series, not every song on either album is covered. I wish it was more thorough. You can likely find this on YouTube, although maybe not with the bonus footage, so check it out before you buy it. I think the ""Beyond the Lighted Stage"" DVD set is a far better purchase, and it is far more thorough on the Moving Pictures album.",1458864000,,1233,4.4035087719298245

4232838,5,B003Z6HSFQ,"I will be honest, I am a big fan so this review is from the perspective of someone who loves all things Rush. That said even with the biased slant this was a great insight into the bands relationship with their long time producer Terry Brown.  That being the reason I found it interesting, more so than the claim (which was also true) that this was a documentary about two of the bands, most noted, albums.  While it is true that these two albums were created at turning points in the bands career, they were not, in my opinion their most noted work.  However there are many Rush fans who would disagree with that. This is definite must for Rush fans and great place to start for those who might be a little bit curious about a band that are third in the world, next to the Beatles who are number one and the Rolling Stones who are the second, platinum selling acts ever.

4232853,5,B003Z6HSFQ,"I enjoyed this dvd but I wish they would have broke the songs down more. The should have been more indepth when they talked about ""Tom Sawyer"" and explained what all the lyrics in the song meant. The song ""YYZ"" was kind of interesting to hear about. They could have been more indepth with ""Red Barchetta"" and explained all the lyrics on it. They explained ""Limelight"" okay but could have explained all the lyrics on that too. Maybe they should have done a seperate dvd for each album and could have been more indepth and thorough.

On the album 2112 they did okay with explaining the side long track. On the song ""Passage to Bangkok"" they didn't really explain the use of pot like they could of. All Peart said was that thai stick came out at about the same time as the album and that was all that was said of pot use. Most rock groups of the 70's were using pot at that time and it wouldn't be a big deal explaining that they were really into pot at that time. ""Twilight Zone"" was short but kind of interesting. On the bonus part they talked about ""Something for nothing"", it was short but interesting. It would have been good to hear about the two songs by Lifeson and Lee. I really like the song ""Lessons"", and it would have been great to hear about. I took off one half a star because they weren't very indepth with a lot of the songs but what was on the dvd was enjoyable. Maybe they could do a classic albums dvd about PERMANENT WAVES but I doubt it. This is still worth purchasing with the gripes I have. Enjoy!!!",1342828800,,1520,4.277777777777778
4232854,5,B003Z6HSFQ,"The famed British TV series called Classic Albums has been around for many years. In September of 2010, Classic Albums and Eagle Rock Entertainment released their episode spotlighting Canadian prog rockers Rush's 1976 classic 2112 and 1981's blockbuster Moving Pictures.
While 2112 was approaching its 35th Anniversary, Moving Pictures was celebrating its 30th anniversary throughout 2010 and 2011. First came the band performing Moving Pictures on its Time Machine Tour. Then came this DVD documentary on how this and 2112 was made in September of 2010. Then Moving Pictures would be re-released on CD and DVD/Blu-Ray in surround sound in April of 2011.
All three members of Rush's classic lineup being co-founder/singer/bass player/songwriter/keyboard player Geddy Lee, guitarist/songwriter Alex Lifeson and drummer/lyricist Neil Peart are all featured in new and exclusive interviews in this 2010 documentary. Also Geddy, Alex and Neil play songs and demonstrate themes from the the two albums. Alex demonstrated on ""2112"" how he came up with the music and for the ""Discovery"" part played whilst he tuned his guitar. Neil's revelation on how The Solar Federation got destroyed at the end to set the record straight on what happens at the end of ""2112"". The guys paying tribute to Rod Serling's ""The Twilight Zone"" and Geddy demonstrating his bass guitar parts for that track. Original producer Terry Brown sifts through the original multi-track tapes isolating some parts of songs to hear some parts isolated either on their own or not ever heard before on both albums. Also, there was some rare concert footage from the band's performance in New Jersey performing ""2112"" in 1976 plus some rare seen pictures and for the Moving Pictures parts pieces from the videos made for the album (sans ""Vital Signs"") and Exit...Stage Left and additional interviews with ex-Mercury Records exec Cliff Burnstein, David Fricke (from Rolling Stone Magazine and a self-confessed life long Rush fan), the legendary last real DJ Jim Ladd, Foo Fighters drummer Taylor Hawkins and a few others.
There are also some extra features with more demonstrations from Alex on the riff for ""Something For Nothing"", Geddy explaining how the intro to ""2112"" came to be when their album cover designer Hugh Syme was fiddling with some synthesizers, a Neil drum solo. Also some more revelations from the band on some bits that didn't fit onto the actual documentary itself due to time constraints. Also a new video of ""2112 Overture"" and ""YYZ"" with the band miming in their current age to the tracks they recorded in 1976 and 1981 respectively (Geddy pulled out his Rickenbacker for 2112 while used his Fender for YYZ, Alex using two different Gibson Les Pauls (sunburst for 2112 and the black for YYZ) and Neil using one of his current DW drum kits with Sabian Cymbals as he no longer has the drum kits he originally used on those recordings nor Zildjian cymbals).

4232855,4,B003Z6HSFQ,"There's a lot of good reasons to watch this video, namely the band of your youth on their 2 most famous albums.  For what's here there's a lot to like.  The bonus features go in depth a little more and add more substance to the whole package as the main video alone, while nice, still feels a little thin.  But even with the bonus features, we still only get discussion on the first side of the Moving Pictures: Tom Sawyer through to Limelight.  What about side 2?  Camera Eye, Witch Hunt and Vital Signs are SORELY neglected and not even mentioned!  For real Rushians like myself it's the B-sides that come to be what you want to know most about.. and the side 2 of Moving Pictures is FULL of good stuff to be explored and would have liked to have heard a few words from Neil (or anyone) on what inspired Witch Hunt, and Vital Signs or even Camera Eye which is a great tune. At the time it came out, Witch Hunt nearly put Rush in the same ""devil camp"" as Ozzy and Sabbath and the trend at the time among metal bands etc seemed to be occult minded stuff.. Not that Witch Hunt ever actually promotes ""Satanism"" (quite the contrary), but it came out at a time when people were back-tracking Stairway to Heaven looking for hidden messages, etc.  And Rush with their hidden devil face in the ""man-in-the-star"", the red and black Moving Pictures album, and the times, only continued to steep the band in intrigue of this sort.. this album was a farewell to the 70s.

Anyway, it's cool hanging out with Rush again as they reminisce these 2 albums though I'd have given 5 stars if they'd gone into the less famous songs as well.  Also, I think they should have stuck to more concert footage from the actual era of these two albums rather than post-Moving Pictures concerts - when they're looking a little more new wave.  Whatever.  It's a good watch and you'll have fun strolling down stoner lane with them and remembering wherever you were when you first heard either of these albums.  Bet there's some stories there..",1337904000,,2012,4.452316076294278

There is a real pleasure to see those guys getting older and having fun with their former album producer Terry Brown and discover some of the secrets of the ""2112"" and ""Moving Pictures"" albums (although I think that ""Permanent Waves"", a year before, is a better recording than ""Moving Pics..."" but, anyway!...). So you can get in, a little bit more, the Rush Sound and all the idea before it. And it's a great surprise to listen all the Neil Peart's comments about the lyrics of the songs and the books that he has read. it's obvious that he's not only an excellent drummer but a monster reader too... so don't miss it! it's really a fantastic fun Rush video for collectors and it worths the price...

4232859,5,B003Z6HSFQ,If you have any knowledge of RUSH and their music most will agree the realease of 2112 ensured that the group is here to say.  Moving Pictures showed the range of RUSH and they can create songs that play on the radio.  This DVD highlights those two critical albums.  This is a MUST see for RUSH fans!,1307750400,,300,4.228070175438597
4232860,4,B003Z6HSFQ,"While some of this info is more or less contained in the Beyond The Lighted Stage film, this is nonetheless a fascinating glimpse into the making of 2 incredible albums from Rush.  Some of the best parts include moments where Terry Brown solos up parts on the console, as well as insight from each member about coming up with the tunes, both lyrically and musically.  An absolute must have for any Rush fan - even casual Rush fans will be interested in this.

My only criticism is that they do not address each song from each album.  For example, I would love to have heard about how they wrote and recorded side 2 of Moving Pitcures.  Most of 2112 is covered (exceptions: Lessons and Tears).

Fun to see these guys in this light.",1299456000,,730,4.451127819548872
4232861,5,B003Z6HSFQ,"I got ""Beyond the Lighted Stage"" recently and absolutely loved it. My only gripe was that it was too short. It was the Rush biopic that you could sit down with your wife and watch but not quite enough for the rabid Dungeons and Dragons playing muso uber-fan.

Not that I know anybody like that. Ahem.

So many things that I'm really interested in hearing about were kind of glossed over quickly that I could have really used a BTLS pt 2. This Classic Albums video was about as close as we'll probably get to that. It was obviously shot around the same time that biopic was, but I was happy to see that almost none of the footage was used in both places and in fact if you were to take both of these DVDs and edit them together you would come up with what is probably an excellent and cohesive Rush super-documentary.

Some other reviewers have griped about there being a lot of the same stuff as in the biopic. Obviously much of the same ground is going to be covered because of these albums' place in Rush's history and because it's not like Rush spent ten years making these albums. There's only so much to talk about! That said, there was a lot of stuff in this DVD that really should have made it into the movie. There things that the studio and musician nerds are looking for: many of Alex's solos are discussed specifically and played sans backing music for instance - very interesting stuff. There are bits of band history, such as a lot more specific discussion about Ayn Rand's influence on the band as a whole as well as how Mercury's arm-twisting of Ray Danniels and Terry Brown led those sentiments to heavily influence the writing of 2112 rather than whatever else they were reading at the time.

In general, it is absolutely silly to suggest that this video is at all ripped off of BTLS or that the stock footage (mostly some clips of old videos like ""Tom Sawyer"" and some concert shots from ""RE30"" and ""A Show of Hands"") makes up too much of the DVD. I almost didn't get it because of this and am really glad that I went ahead and bought it anyway.",1293235200,15,2063,4.364583333333333

4232865,5,B003Z6HSFQ,"Another candid look at what goes on behind the scenes with Rush.  The alblum 2112 was my first Rush alblum that I listened to as a young teenager, and the making of it shed some light on just why I still considered it my favorite Rush alblum.  The interviews are great with Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson, and Neal Peart; but the talks they have with Terry Brown are the ones that get inside the record.

The making of Moving Pictures is done well with more insight as well.  You will want to watch the extras as that is a show in itself.  This DVD is a s staple for any hardcore Rush fan, but certainly worth the purchase for fans of rock music and middle of the road Rush fans.",1289692800,,672,4.138461538461539
4232866,5,B003Z6HSFQ,"I am a huge Rush fan and have seen a lot of different videos, but found a lot of new info here that was very interesting. I especially enjoyed the parts about the not so popular tracks from 2112....Something for Nothing, Twilight Zone, Passage to Bangkok. Also the interviews of the 3 giving their opinions of the other 2 was great. It is excellent that they break down the different sections of 2112 (the song) and explain the different parts and I was surprised about the ending which Neil described. I have understood it wrong for 35 years. Most people (non fans) hear 2112/Temples of Syrinx on the radio and think that is 2112, not realizing that it is a 20+ minute novel, set to awesome music. I have never heard the complete ""side"" on radio and it would be great if some stations would play it. Between this and the documentary earlier this year, it's no wonder that Rush is probably more popular than ever now. I went to the Time Machine concert and was amazed at the number of females there and also the young kids and all were enjoying it. I think they have opened up an even broader fan base.

On both album reviews, they left out the songs: The camera eye, Witch hunt, Vital signs,Lessons, Tears. They should have left out their brief life story(all this can be found on the Beyond the lighted Stage dvd) and concentrated on talking about EVERY song on both albums. I own other ""classic albums in review"" dvd's from other bands and they do go into all songs of that album in detail. The only thing that saved this dvd from getting one star from me is the bonus stuff. Rush is my favorite band of all times and I enjoy learning a little history about their songs. I just wished they include all songs when they decide to do another ""Classic Album"" dvd. Hemispheres and A Farewell to Kings would be awesome!",1288742400,3,862,4.496815286624204

4232871,4,B003Z6HSFQ,"I am part of that faction of rock fans who think that Canadian power-trio Rush is something great. I loved last years documentary about the group, Living on the Lighted Stage. While mostly affectionate, that doc did acknowledge criticism of singer Geddy Lee - his high-pitched vocals are not for everyone.

While that voice may keep Rush out of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, it has not kept them from earning massive respect of other musicians and legions of fans. Their anthemic songs have helped them sell more records than almost any artist touring today.

As a fan I was hopeful that the mostly sympathetic portrait present in Living on the Lighted Stage of three humble and nice guys (isn't that the Canadian way?) might make the case for reconsidering them for the Cleveland based hall. No such luck. Nominations are out and they aren't there again.

Now comes another consideration by way of the always excellent Eagle Vision Classic Albums series. In what might be a first, this episode (available on Blu Ray)  is double one - examining not one but two Rush albums, 2112 and Moving Pictures. This might be too much of a good thing.

Rush's mega success came by way of the runway created by Permanent Waves two great songs Spirit of Radio and Freewill. Both were FM radio staples. By the time the needle hit the vinyl for Moving Pictures, the public was hungry for ""the most requested songs from our catalog"" - Tom Sawyer, Limelight, Red Barchetta, and one of the great displays of monster music chops in rock music, YYZ.

All these classic tracks are dissected in that informative Classic Albums way with producer Terry Brown and members of Rush having a seat at the recording board isolating various tracks providing anecdotes. For any fan, this is essential stuff and you won't want to miss it. Hard to believe that YYZ started as a jam between drummer Neil Peart and bassist Geddy Lee.

The 2112 section not as enjoyable. I am not sure I understand why this album, rather than say Signals, was examined. 2112 is weird album - one song takes up a whole side - and while it helped them ""solidify their sound as a band"" I am not sure there is much pent up demand for this deeper dive into that particular record. Much back-story is presented that is better covered in Living on the Lighted Stage. I suppose if you haven't seen this, this might be more interesting than it was too me. It struck me as overly familiar.

As with the entire Classic Albums series these are minor criticisms. It is still the only must have series in music video. Rush truly deserves a treatment and the Moving Pictures section is as good as any in the series.",1288137600,2,2647,4.593220338983051

4232873,4,B003Z6HSFQ,"I just received this blu-ray and watched it last night. Video quality is very good although the soundtrack is only 2.0. Still sounded great though.

This disc doesn't quite have the same entertainment value of the very well done Beyond the Lighted Stage. It's very dry and matter-of-fact for the most part but the depth they go into is great. I specifically love seeing Terry Brown behind the mixer soloing individual tracks with the original recordings. They also show the band members playing individual parts at times.

I would have liked them to go into full detail of all songs though. They only focused on the most popular ones. If you are going to go in-depth you might as well go all the way.

I highly recommend this to Rush fans that also might be musicians themselves.",1287532800,,779,4.671532846715328

When I was younger all I knew was that the music was great of course but I didn't realize how complex it was.  And then you add that in with having the greatest drummer in the world.  Sorry Neil I'm sure your uncomfortable with that but a fact is a fact.  Alex and Geddy are amazing too.  I hope RUSH does one of these DVD's of their entire catalog.,1287532800,,457,3.978021978021978

Not a lot of original footage of them actually working on those projects back in the day. Rush always kept the fans excited because they don't flood the market with themselves like DT does. I take this as a positive approach. This release is borderline flood. It's nice to see the band members in a documentary after a year or two of not hearing from them.

I would have liked to heard more about the songs on side 2, in particular 'Tears', a very rare ballad of a song with lyrics by Geddy.  The piece on 'Twilight Zone' was humorous though.  After 2112 we had the great live album 'All the Worlds a Stage' followed by the 3 albums leading up to the classic 'Moving Pictures'.

Same goes for Moving Pictures. Songs not covered are 'The Camera eye' (why not?), 'Witch Hunt' and 'Vital signs'.
