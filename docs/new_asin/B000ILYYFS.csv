8146220,5,B000ILYYFS,KOTC has come a long way since these days. I like watching these dvds to see the up and coming fighters come up in the ranks.,1413763200,,125,3.8461538461538463
8146221,4,B000ILYYFS,"Yes, these are not your typical King of the Cage fighters.  Most of these guys are new and/or unexperienced compared to the fights you see on pay per view.  However, many of them are interesting to watch for their unique fighting styles and sometimes just comic amusement. (Watch the Forgione/Blackula fight - it's like a chicken chase.)  It's a great price for the number of events that are included.",1162080000,2,401,4.782608695652174
