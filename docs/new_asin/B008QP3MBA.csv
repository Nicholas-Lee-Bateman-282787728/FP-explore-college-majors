8529647,1,B008QP3MBA,"This show was about a school for teenage idiots somewhere out in the backwoods of Australia. As anyone with even the vaguest notion of what teenagers or Australia are can readily surmise, the series was a litany of stupid, frustrating, and altogether unfortunate events. Episodes revolved around a group of these doleful dolts who lived in an abandoned garage. They spent most of their time slobbing around, eating pizza, and attempting to communicate in a semi-verbal fashion which too often descended into bestial grunts and flailing fists. Their frequent belligerence was caused by a complete incapacity to understand  their surroundings and the daily tasks and predicaments that most of us take for granted. The show ended abruptly when their leader, inexplicably named ""Draswick"", drowned after attempting to take a drink from a water fountain and failing to release that he had to remove his face from the fountain after he had finished drinking. A senseless, though few would consider tragic, accident which could so easily have been avoided had ""Draswick"" or any of his friends had a single brain-cell to rub together.
