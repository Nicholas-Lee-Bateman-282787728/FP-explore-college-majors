What's great about this dvd collection, is that it offers the option to watch them chronologically. Which is awesome!! Now I can watch it in a way that makes sense. Yay!! for the creators of this collection!!",1454025600,,339,4.540983606557377

8449176,5,B0032LTVXG,"This series completely through me off guard. I had always wanted to purchase it but I usually don't like subs when often times the translation doesn't come across also I like the subtitles when I know that I will enjoy it. And , that I did! A mix of magic and friendships. I had loads of fun watching it. I think it is worth the money and that you won't be disappointed with the Japanese cast or translation.",1354924800,,408,4.243589743589744
