8557679,5,B00ATRPH7U,I bought this DVD for my daughter and she loves it a lot. But you need to get a region-free DVD player to watch it because it is a region 2 DVD. I recommend this to all parents who is looking for a Japanese show for their daughter ~!!,1413504000,,234,3.795918367346939

Very professional work! Congratulations to Mana and her team! Very serious work at such a young age was a serious challenge and Mana successfully did this! My congratulations!",1390435200,,330,4.610169491525424
