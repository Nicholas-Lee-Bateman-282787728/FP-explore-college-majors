And I completely understand why some/most would find little redeemable here, UNLESS you are an aficianado of all things 60's (fashions, cars, Italy/Europe at that time, music, hairstyles, etc.), Monica Vitti + Jean Sorel. Then there's something here for you.

I fall headfirst into that catagory so, in spite of a trite plot and child-like outcome, I had fun watching this flick. Always a fan of Vitti + Sorel, they carry the film to it's conclusion with great aplomb - I could watch Vitti change clothes + hairstyles for 90 minutes, for chrissakes... The entire cast is good in spite of a weak script - and it's not a bad one, just underdeveloped. So for the last 40 minutes we know what's going on + where it will likely lead, but that can be said of most 60's films, and films in general. Do you honestly think today's flicks are any different? Then I envy your niavette.

The first reviewer hated it, but I have to say with some degree of embarassment (nah, not really) that I found it fun - silly, yes, but fun if you appreciate the things I mentioned above. Otherwise, why would you be reading these comments? It plainly states in the Amazon details that this is in English (and I HATE dubbed foreign films, and ain't seen one that wasn't amateurishly done in all my years), but my love for the stars and 60's foreign films trumped my detestment for full-frame flicks and poorly dubbed (an oxymoron if ever there was one) films. And the over-utilized theme song played incessantly throughout was at least done by The Hollies - cut me some slack here, would ya?

All in all, it's a 3 star flick, in spite of all, yet I'm bumping my review up to 4 stars because it's a LOT better than the first reviewer would have you believe. Not that he's entirely wrong, not at all, just a bit harsh. But in a free society, or at least a cheap one, he's entitled to that. God Bless America, and 60's foreign films.",1403827200,3,2024,4.435483870967742
8617336,1,B00FNRA8OI,"When I purchase a foreign movie I expect it to be presented in its original language with English subtitles. This terrible Italian comedy from 1967 is a strange DVD offering. The titles and everything else within the action (a handwritten note, telegrams, etc.) are all in Italian with no subtitles, yet the entire main soundtrack is dubbed English. Someone at Sony must have been on their smartphone when this half-baked mess got past them.

It does not help that the plot which at first seems quirky ends by being tired and predictable, and it becomes obvious quite quickly that director Maselli is no Richard Lester. The film desperately tries to be another ""Modesty Blaise""-""What's New Pussycat""-""Fathom"" romp and it fails in all departments except in the star wattage provide by its gorgeous, charismatic leads (Monica Vitti and Jean Sorel). But even these two can't salvage a rotten script that boasts no less than four writers and a director who insists on constantly shooting up people's nostrils.

The plot deals with a pair of con artists who eventually meet their match. The first part takes place in several luxurious locales along the Mediterranean, and the second part in swank locales in ""groovy"" 1960's London. The print provided is quite stunning in both sharpness and color saturation, but the whole project turns into an irritating and futile exercise. The awful 60's rock ballads that are played almost non-stop and at full blast do not help either (the final music credits show Graham Nash and The ""Hollyes"" [sic] as the culprits).

Why don't I give this movie 5 stars?  I take one off for the lousy script, another one for the inept wannabe hipster direction, another one for the rotten use of pop ballads and a fourth for the inexcusable dubbing job. So I give this clunker only one star for the poor leads who certainly deserve better.

Strictly for the most devoted fans of Vitti, Sorel, or things 60's.",1403308800,6,1928,4.883792048929664
