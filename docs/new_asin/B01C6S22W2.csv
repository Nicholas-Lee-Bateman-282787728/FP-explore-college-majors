8752369,3,B01C6S22W2,"Medaka Box is an unpredictable monster. It starts off as any other slice of life, student council quirkfest, and quickly escalates into something no one could have foretold, pushing the boundaries of a story that seemed drawn out for it. The themes regarding ""naturally privileged"" human beings was actually quite interesting in the first season. ""Abnormal,"" the second season, is more entertaining, but not as fundamentally deep. Of course, Gainax wanted to get bigger and better, which is one of the things that made their firstborn (Neon Genesis Evangelion) so great. In fact, I could see this series as the precursor for Kill la Kill, which would be released a year later (by TRIGGER). However, towards the end, I cannot help but feel that something occurred in production, because I was wrought with a vicious anger when the final episode rolled around. Nevertheless, let's open up Medaka Box and study this miss mash of surprises.

CHARACTERS: The characters of the first season are very interesting themselves, but the sad thing is that they are given little to do storywise but advance it. Therefore, I never really formed emotional connections to any of them. Medaka herself is an enigma, seemingly perfect with a heart of gold. We are never sure of what she is, but the problem is that we very rarely grasp WHO she is; her feelings come about through actions and words rather than expressed emotion. There is a lot of outright ""stating"" on her part. Instead, it is Zenkichi, proving that normal people can surpass the gifted through hard work, who is mostly relegated to spouting of exposition about Medaka's feelings and habits. Akune is a pretty-boy who used to be a violent thug, and Kikaijima is a cold super-athlete who is learning to care for more than just money and has some rather cute awkward moments, but both drop into the plot shadows until they are necessary after their induction to the Student Council. Shiranui is basically a way for characters to receive information about things they shouldn't be able to know, but she's delightfully wacky enough to forgive. In my opinion, Unzen is the best additional character to the series, since he catapults the events into insanity with such arrogant glee that I was soaking in every bit of his detestable performance. In ""Abnormal,"" The Front Six and Kugurugi are welcome additions and oppositions to Medaka and her friends. Their powers are imaginative, interesting, and create some enjoyable action scenes. The Plus Six are a plot device and a waste.

ANIMATION AND SOUND: Medaka Box's OPs and EDs are your typical Shounen pop tracks. They work decently enough, since the show has no definite atmosphere or feeling to convey, so there is no necessity to produce a feeling of gravity, longing, or deep inflection in the music. The background tracks are actually catchy ( I was able to remember specific scenes and their tunes whenever they were used), but not what I would call evoking emotion; the music is there as a space filler. The animation, on the other hand, is fantastic, reminiscent of Gainax's ""Gurren Lagann."" When, of course, the characters actually move. Their designs are very sketch-like and sharp, their movements perfect for capitalizing on each character's traits, and the animation is fluid during action. However, the characters actually remain in stasis very often, and the story is to blame for that.

STORY: One of the most important philosophies of the visual arts is to show, not tell. Hence the term ""visual."" Medaka Box is a very talky show, especially in the latter half. The story is very episodic in season one, following the student council as it expands, solves problems for students via suggestions submitted to the Medaka Box, and clashes with the Student Police Committee. The finale is definitely the best part of that series, raising two questions: What exactly IS Medaka, and who are these Abnormals? Well...throughout the entirety of season two, which transpires over what seems like two days, we never learn the answer to those two questions. Why do Abnormals receive their powers? What is the greater world actually doing to cope with them? Is Medaka actually human? How exactly does the Flask Plan work? I was so boggled by what was going on, that I still couldn't solve the mystery no matter how much exposition was spoken. Yes, most of the dialogue is the student council or the Front Six ""explaining"" certain abnormalities or Medaka herself. This drags on, even through the action scenes; I was constantly checking the time. At one point Oudo asks ""Must I repeat myself?"" and I was begging him not to because every character repeats themselves six times at least before the story moves on. The story is the most important thing to the show, so much so that they repeat several things in order to make sure that we understand what is going on, to the point where we don't understand and the entire show suffers for it. Medaka Box is mostly about becoming more and more of a spectacle, and I became less and less invested as the characters became less and less important. I would still have given it four stars, but for one teensy teensy issue...

THE ENDING (SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS DID I SAY SPOILERS? SPOILERS!!!!)
For those of you who missed it, SPOILERS! The show screws itself in the end. It has a great idea of bringing back the character in Medaka's flashbacks as the final antagonist, Kumagawa, and hitting us with several images of Team Loser and Plus Six being brutally murdered. This hits hard, and I was so pumped for the next episode. FAKE OUT! Instead, we receive a stupid, pointless, confusing, bonus story centered around Kumagawa that has little bearing on the plot we just witnessed, in my opinion. And then, so many questions are raised! Why did Kumagawa kill the former student council president? Why does he get away with murder? How can he be such a loser if he actually wins? What's up with this girl with the spiky teeth? Does he kill that painter abnormal? Who is this Anshin person? How did he not beat Medaka if he can erase things from reality? WHERE IS OUR CONCLUSION TO ""MEDAKA BOX?!"" I was viciously angry and could barely sit through this episode as I realized what would happen, that our final episode would not conclude Medaka's story. This isn't Evangelion move, where the story merely becomes confusing; this is a total cop-out. But why? Did they end on a flashback in order to ensure fans would demand a sequel?  Did they run out of money and need an excuse to paint everything in black and white? Though I doubt this, I feel it is true; there is a large mech controlled by Oudo, as well as two outfits Medaka does not wear (one of which shows her magically sealed for some reason) towards the end of ""Abnormal's"" opening. This makes me believe that there was a grand battle between the two planned, but that the budget was reduced or something and this could not happen. As it is, there is a lot of talking and comparatively little action, but that could pass if they actually finished the story they were telling.

I do not feel up to buying ""Medaka Box."" It is a pretty show with interesting choices and a good deal of unpredictability that kept me interested as the show wound on, but it eventually crashed in a heap of disappointment. I understand there is a large fanbase, and they would most likely tell me that it makes sense if I read the manga. Let me tell you: If a studio produces an anime that is adapted from a manga, they better have all audiences in mind. Expecting only the manga readers to get it will not generate the necessary audience, and will ultimately feel like a cash-in (anyone who has seen ""Jinki Extend"" will know what this feels like). Indeed, I believe this was just a cash-in for those who love Medaka's design and the manga; Attach it to the name of Gainax and promise over the top action, and no wonder people saw it. I saw it, and was glad I did for curiosity's sake, but I think the creators lost the importance of the value of entertaining over just preaching ideas and exposition. Don't get me wrong, as there are great characters and an intriguing story to tell, but it was not handled well in the slightest. And that last episode is simply unforgivable, especially since I have heard nothing of a third season. Take my word as you see fit.",1461110400,2,8362,4.743642611683849
