8753937,5,B01CRDZLZQ,"Great to have this on Blu-ray. I like this edition since it comes with DVD and soundtrack. The steel case is nice but mine came with a couple of faint scratches, but I might use a paint pen to cove them up since it's on the face of the steel book case. The HD transfer is good. This is a great Argento flick showing some obvious Hitchcock influence in particular scenes. I love the retro soundtrack too. Worth the money, the seller I bought it from had it for slightly higher than the Synapse site/about $4.00 more. The Synapse site was down for taking online orders and I didn't want to call them over the phone so I just ordered it for the few dollars more.

I do wish Synapse could offer their products for purchase on Amazon in the future.",1466726400,,743,4.2695035460992905

8753939,5,B01CRDZLZQ,"I pre-ordered my copy of TENEBRAE from Synapse Films' own website months ago and it arrived last weekend. I was thrilled with the video quality of this stylish Italian slasher/giallo. It is definitely one the classier offerings of the early '80s Slasher Boom. The gore is still there, yet it doesn't seem as sleazy or gratuitous in the hands of director Dario Argento. This would be the European counterpart to a film like The New York Ripper yet doesnt come across as misogynist although there are a half-dozen young ladies sliced and diced and the script keeps us guessing just who this razor-wielding maniac is. The cast is certainly above average and having prestige names like John Saxon and Anthony Franciosa on board really helps to elevate the material. I really enjoyed the performance by Daria Nicolodi as Franciosas assistant.

The Blu-Ray is fantastic as I said, but this deluxe steelbook also comes with a DVD, a CD, and booklet with informative essay on the film. If you didn't order from Synapse, be prepared to be gouged by Amazon scalpers for this one because only 3000 copies were made.",1458345600,6,1104,4.841269841269841
