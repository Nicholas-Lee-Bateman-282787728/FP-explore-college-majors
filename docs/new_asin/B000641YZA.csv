There was only 15 min on a few basic strokes & very little info on reflexology that would fill only a 20 page book.
Visualization was also a disapointment where you only concentrate on breathing & what you feel & not be afraid to be more aware of your body lead by a woman with 2 other woman sitting & breathing while the teacher spoke. They discussed what they felt & they did  do another visualization of reminding you of nature scenes you remember & concentrating on that, but it also could have been more uplifting & longer.
All these only gave a brief overview & was a good start but barely scratch the surface of these great arts.",1154476800,,882,4.313253012048193
