3090745,1,B0012K53L8,"Unfortunately I did not check out these reviews before ordering the DVD; how could one imagine it would be so bad?  The filmed concert quality is absolutely substandard -- particularly the sound.  Film is grainy, but that is tolerable.  What is NOT tolerable is the sound, which is extaordinarily poor.  The vocals are almost indiscernable (even the speaking portions) -- the singing overwhelmed by a tinny instrumental back-up.  I cannot imagine how Vance and the Planotones could have permitted such a poor-quality representation of their superb performances.  This product should be taken off the market.",1270339200,11,607,5.336842105263158
3090746,1,B0012K53L8,"I have to agree with the majority of the others on this one.  Kenny Vance is incredible and I never get tired of listening to the Planotones.  I just ""had"" to get this DVD to satisfy my own curiosity and see whether these negative reviews were being too hard on the group.  Well, they were being correct and fair.  This obviously was created with an ordinary hand-held camcorder.  The sound at any point in time depends on where the photographer happened to be relative to the PA system.  But it's really bad overall.  In my opinion, the group isn't doing itself any favors by allowing this DVD to be released.  These guys are still my heroes, but don't expect much from the DVD.",1239148800,,679,4.463414634146342
3090747,1,B0012K53L8,"Very disappointed in the sound and visual quality...Such a great artist and the performance was excellent..just a poor quality video, I don't recommend this to anyone.",1231977600,,167,5.461538461538462
3090748,2,B0012K53L8,"Shame on Alpha New Cinema for producing Kenny Vance & The Planotones Live DVD for the audio recordings.  It is as if they put a microphone in the middle of the room while the group performed.  Unless you have some audio enhancement software you will be disappointed with the overall vocal sound quality.  DVD was played on desktop computer, laptop computer and combination TV/DVD - all with the same poor audio sound quality.

Play LOOKING FOR AN ECHO from the Doo Wop Vocal Group Greats DVD and compare it to this DVD.  No comparison at all!",1229644800,5,542,4.604166666666667
3090749,5,B0012K53L8,"In reference to the 2 reviews:  I purchased this DVD in 2007 and thought it was AWESOME.  If you went to their website you would find out that when they recorded this DVD it was put together with Live FOotage and not studio quality.  My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed the DVD and understood every song and the quality was very good.  We play it over and over again and the performance was excellent.  They should make more live DVD's because Kenny Vance and the Planotones are remarkable, enchanting guys.  I would recommend this DVD for anyone who are diehard fans.",1217808000,4,568,4.574257425742574
3090750,1,B0012K53L8,"I agree with ""MacMyst.""  This DVD is a great disappointment.  The audio quality of the concert is utterly horrid.  It is difficult enough to detect which songs are being performed, much less to hear their words.  I was very much looking forward to this concert, but could not proceed beyond the first several minutes, during which my only ability to determine which songs were being performed came from the listing on the DVD box.  This DVD is unlistenable.",1215216000,14,457,4.8076923076923075
3090751,1,B0012K53L8,"I'm a big enought fan of Kenny Vance and the Planotones to own ALL of their CDs. I guess it was too good to be true that they they had a concert DVD up to the same high standards as their audio recordings. Unfortunately, in my opinion, the audio and video quality of this DVD are amateurish at best, and a great disservice to Kenny Vance and the Planotones, as well as to their loyal fans like me. To be more specific, it sometimes seemed to me that this DVD was recorded using nothing more than a couple of handheld consumer camcorders! I hope that Kenny Vance and the Planotones will produce a first class concert DVD to make up for this HUGE disappointment.",1212624000,17,660,4.330645161290323

8246327,1,B0012K53L8,"I never would have thought that the production and audio would be SO bad on ANYTHING  by Kenny Vance, but I am actually going to return this. It is so bad, you cannot make out the vocals, the comments he makes, and you cannot hear them sing very well due to the guitar drowning them out. There was such poor lighting that even the audience seemed to disappear. This does not do him justice. I'd rather get an audio cd and use my memory and imagineation. Do NOT buy this. You will nearly cry listening to it.",1478995200,,507,4.22680412371134

8246329,1,B0012K53L8,"I love Kenny Vance, what an awesome voice he has!  It certainly didn't come through on this dvd! I'm so disappointed I could cry. I hope he does a new dvd BUT have a good professional sound company record it. Again, this is a waste of good money.",1440979200,,246,4.125
8246330,2,B0012K53L8,"I am a loyal fan of Kenny Vance and the Planatones and have seen their live show at the Palace Theatre in Greensburg, PA several years ago...a fabulous presentation that could have been recorded. This DVD, however, is of very poor quality, and I find it hard to believe that Kenny Vance, with his and his band's professional standards, would permit its release for sale to the public. Sound quality could not have been worse, as was the lighting, which consisted mostly of glare on the faces of the performers and complete darkness when the camera moved to different views of stage and audience. For much of the performance, instead of front or side views of the performers, all that can be seen is their backs!!! Horrible, to say the least...the producers, photographers and sound engineers have hopefully moved onto other professions.",1440720000,,836,4.894366197183099

8246334,1,B0012K53L8,"Very poor  sound quality. Video  was very jerky in motion as if done by an unsteady hand held camera. The whole video was more like a poorly done home video rather than a professional product. If you want to hear Kenny Vance at his best, just purchase a studio quality CD.  It would be nice to watch his performance on DVD but not this one. Save your money.",1400630400,2,357,4.220588235294118
8246335,1,B0012K53L8,Kenny Vance and the Planotones are the best but the video and audio quality of this DVD is a disgrace. I'm sorry I ever bought it and I would not recommend it to anyone. Alpha home entertainment should be ashame for putting out such low quality as this. They are not doing Kenny and the guys any favors.,1365206400,,303,4.241379310344827
8246336,1,B0012K53L8,I should have read the reviews before purchasing this absolutely awful production.  I have downloaded videos of Kenny & the Planotones from YouTube which are far better quality than this horrid mess.  I can't believe they actually charge money for this.  I am a huge fan of Kenny's and I can't believe he actually permitted anything this bad to be released.  Buyer Beware!!,1291939200,5,373,4.873015873015873
