5449397,4,B00ALX3QBQ,"This is the first two adaptations of the Jack Irish books.  Set in an area of Melbourne at a time just before gentrification happened.  Jack Irish is a successful lawyer.  One day one of his unsuccessful defendamts comes back looking for justice and kills Jack's wife.  This sends Jack into a tailspin and he gives up practicing the law and becomes a sort of private eye (note: this is the first 10 minutes of the first movie).  In the first movie, he investigates the death of one of his old clients, which leads to other murders and a coverup.

Guy Pierce, who came to America's attention in LA Confidential and Momemto, stars as Irish and brings life to this troubled character.  This is an iteresting yet flawed pair of movies that are worth looking into.

Making of documentary is included.",1384992000,,795,4.628571428571429
5449398,3,B00ALX3QBQ,"This ""set"" of JACK IRISH episodes is two feature length TV movies on a single DVD.
Very well made, yet this viewer was often baffled by thick Aussie accents,
colloquialisms and a tendency to speak indistinctly in rapid, incomplete sentences.

Because of a definite handicap of American comprehension, I was often left
confused by plot developments and unable to fully appreciate the stories.

IMDb voters rated ""Bad Debts"" and ""Black Tide"" in the mid-sixes, which seems about right.",1384819200,,482,5.166666666666667

5449402,5,B00ALX3QBQ,"Expect action with this Jack Irish bloke. A criminal lawyer gone rogue as debt collector, drunk, gambler, and more after his wife's murder. Guy Pearce becomes the character that was created from the crime novels of Peter Temple. Those books are being released in America now in parallel with the winning TV series. Even 100 minutes can't do justice to the novel, but the character focus is preserved, as well as the Melbourne setting, also the film location.
Some great orchestration and pop music mixed into the episodes.
Jack is a fallen, grieving lawyer who investigates dark lives--a series that is Aussie character driven.
I loved the touching scenes in the wood shop which included the old cabinet maker Charlie (Vadin Glowna) but alas he died prior to airing of the 2 episodes he acted so honestly through. There are also some great give-n-go moments in the local pub.

Bad Debts
An ex-client turns up dead, so jack falls back into a bit of his old life. Politics, crooked cops, business, and murder for $$$ all become a part of the cleverly woven plot of conspiracy and corruption that get the protagonist, Jack Irish, back into the investigative life he so hoped to avoid. Yet he keeps a hold on his gambling and woodworking apprenticeship during life and death events. A bit of nudity during bed scenes with reporter Linda (Marta Dusseldorp) who wants more than just a news story scoop--oops! Complex suspense to keep you on your seat's edge.

Black Tide
Irish's dad's old friend has a case that might provide him some insight into his own dad's past. The friends son, Gary, is missing along with $$$ belonging to his father. And Jack's cabinetmaker gets involved indirectly. As always there are evil people in high places. Romance takes a back seat, well they're not really seated. Always plenty of action.

SUBTITLES are available for not only the 2 feature-length episodes but also the Behind the Scenes film bonus segment. Unrated but with gritty adult content. It's a combo Blu-ray (1080i/16:9) & DVD set.",1377820800,23,2020,4.84927536231884

Most of these serials would be even better if they told the story in two or four hours at most rather than six to sixteen..

The pluses are overwhelming: the plots are simplified a bit but not dumbed down, the actors really fit the roles (Pearce in particular is great), the production values are top-notch, and the atmosphere is genuine Melbourne. The only downside is really half my own: that the accents are so authentic that my American ear has trouble following them at times. I use the 10-second rewind button a lot! This set is a gift to those of us who believe Peter Temple is one of the finest crime fiction writers alive, and who await his next book.",1464652800,5,683,4.796610169491525

5449532,3,B00ALX3QBQ,"The first episode looks like it could have been interesting, if not a bit formulaic, but I could hardly understand any of the dialogue.  Certainly the accents and Australian references I don't get  played a role, but overall I think the audio itself was just awful for this.  I could be wrong--let me know if it is just my hearing that isn't as good as it should be any more.  I don't have this much trouble with UK shows, and surely Australian accents can't be harder to understand than Brit and Irish accents.  Come to think of it I think I could better understand Brad Pitt in Snatch.

5449541,3,B00ALX3QBQ,"3 1/2 stars -- Guy Pearce is a vivid and appealing actor, and he has quite a bit of range, but the character and the writing of ""Jack Irish,"" at least so far, doesn't ask very much of him.  What it does ask, he does perfectly well.  In this case, he's a damaged ex-lawyer whose wife was murdered about ten years before the action of the stories here, but that tragedy seems to weigh on him less than one might expect.  Apart from what seems like a permanent five-o'-clock shadow, his life seems in reasonable order, and the only real quirk that we can see in him is his propensity for evaluating and betting on race-horses, a pastime that he carries out with a couple of appealing different friends, who, of course, are there when Jack gets into trouble that has nothing to do with horse-racing.  Basically, the genre is thriller-procedural, with attractive women thrown in for interest, and there are dirty politicians and dirty cops, questionable real-estate deals, and frame-ups for murder.  It's all entertaining and well done, but it seems a bit weightless, compared, say, to the Irish ""Jack Taylor"" series (with Iain Glen), where the writing has given Glen a more engaging and credible damaged character, and where the cultural specificity of Ireland weighs heavily on the action and on the psyches of the characters to a degree that the Australian setting doesn't in this series.  Still -- it's not bad:  the plotting is clever, the pacing is good, the bad guys are suitably menacing, and there are thrills and narrow escapes a-plenty.  You won't be bored.",1433721600,,1563,4.762962962962963

In a blink, Jack's back to tracking clues in the dark underworld and finds the energy to uncover the wrongs that affected his life and those of others.

Problem with the BluRay edition of ""Bad Debts"", the sound is out of sync with the picture.  It is difficult to watch the delay between facial reaction and the dialogue. It becomes ridiculous when gunshots are added to the disconnect.  Poor editing.  No problems encountered with the second feature ""Black Tide"".  Stories are convoluted but interesting with Jack as a heroic character with strengths and weaknesses.  He is dogged, but no super hero.  Refreshing.

Here, he plays a disbarred lawyer who works for a local gangster but who tries to take on entrenched local corruption.

5449577,5,B00ALX3QBQ,"In JACK IRISH, we have a recent Australian television series of noir mysteries, based on Australian author Peter Temple's award winning crime novels. The series stars the tall and handsome Emmy winner Guy Pearce (THE KING'S SPEECH, MEMENTO, IRON MAN 3) in the title role, as a former lawyer, part-time private investigator, full-time alcoholic and brooding antihero. The series, made by Australian firms,  is set, and apparently filmed, in the rougher precincts of Melbourne, Australia, certainly part of the world that few of us will have seen.  It was a ratings winner in the U.K. and Australia; two more feature length installments are in the works.  The 1st series, a box set, consists of two feature-length mysteries in a DVD/Blu-ray combo pack, running approximately 202 minutes, 3  hours, for mature audiences, as it contains strong language, violence, graphic images, nudity and sexual situations.  It has an extra 17 minute glimpse behind the scenes of BLACK TIDE.  And, thank you, RLJ Entertainment, it's got subtitles; however else would us Americans ever understand the Australian lingo - and no, I didn't catch a single `let's put the shrimp on the Barbie.'

The episodes are:

Disc 1 (DVD)
Episode 1: Bad Debts
Successful criminal lawyer Jack Irish's beautiful wife is murdered by an irate client, causing Jack to  swear off the law and  his old life. So now he passes his time collecting debts, betting - in as well-informed way as possible-- on horse races, and boozing at a dingy local pub with a handful of senior citizens. Suddenly, a man he once represented - poorly, as it was right after his wife's murder and Jack was drinking heavily - dies; Jack feels he must look more deeply into the situation, to at least render justice to his client now. With the help of reporter Linda Hillier, Jack uncovers a high-level, wide-ranging conspiracy.

Episode 2: Black Tide
As he hopes to gain some insight into the father he hardly knew, Irish accepts a case from Des Connors, one of his dad's old friends. The man's son, Gary, has vanished after scamming $60,000 from his father. Jack throws himself headlong into the search, even though his relationship with Linda suffers as a result; he soon realizes that Gary may be mixed up with dangerous and powerful people.

Seemed to me that the plots of the episodes were somewhat dated, and spoke of the 1990s.  Still, Melbourne is quite an interesting city, and a good setting for these suspenseful shows.  Pearce inhabits the title role stunningly and manfully. (He is, of course, also delineated as a cool guy, with his vintage Studebaker, his Johnnie Walker, and his cool jazz.)  I never imagined he could play a role like this after the first film I ever saw him in.  THE ADVENTURES OF PRISCILLA, QUEEN OF THE DESERT, in which the actor portrayed a tall, handsome, gay female impersonator, child of a rich family and spoiled rotten, so well that, at the time, I doubted he could ever play anything else.  Then I saw him in LA CONFIDENTIAL.  All the acting is strong, particularly that of Vadin Glowna, who plays the old cabinet maker Charlie. The series comes to us with rough edges: characters make nasty comments about seniors; one of the lead characters is an Aborigine, about whom racist comments are made; racist comments are made about Jack, indicating he may be of Jewish background.  Over the years, there have been incidents and government policies that showed a racist streak in Australian society.  I've sometimes thought that `gratuitous' sex and violence can perk up many a film, as witness GAME OF THRONES.  At any rate, we loved JACK IRISH in this house.",1397865600,,3632,4.863636363636363
5449578,5,B00ALX3QBQ,"Guy Pearce is an English-born Australian movie star of considerable international appeal and regard. His father, a test pilot, died when Pearce was nine years old. This made Guy very close to his mother, and with the inherent responsibilities of helping her run a deer farm and the opportunity to attend private school in Australia, Guy found the perfect outlet for his experiences and natural talent as part of the Geelong College Junior Drama Players. He also participated in bodybuilding (winning Junior Mr VictoriaVictoria, Australia being the city where he lived since the age of three) and fencing; both sports that require discipline and focus. His first big acting gig came at the age of 17, and soon he was appearing in Australian TV shows and films.

And, like any actor who has made it in the world market, Pearce likes to do Australian projects when they come up. JACK IRISH is such an endeavour.

Based on the books by Peter Temple, the source material fits Pearce to a T. Part thriller, part redemption story, these first two episodes have a definite film noir feel at times. Characterizations are particulary effective, from the old boys in Irishs local pub, to one of his contacts on the police force who is constantly eating junk food, to the sexy journalist he meets who just might help him to heal from the murder of his his beloved wife, to his business associates who stand with him when the going gets tough. One particularly effective performance comes from German character actor Vadim Glowna, who died shortly after the second episode was filmed. Acting as mentor of sorts to Jack, his Charlie Taub is a furniture maker who allows Jack to be his apprentice. From Charlie, Jack learns patience, craftsmanship and basically how to relax. Its without a doubt a form of therapy for Jack and appears to be working. This is one of the stand out features of JACK IRISH; yes, hes been through hell and has suffered accordingly, but we see him slowly beginning to make progress out of the pit of despair. Sometimes with these burnt out cop type of shows, nothing can extradite the hero from his flaws and that can be a little bit tiresome. Not so with Jack. He makes a little bit of progress each episode (presumably with more to come in the anticipated next set of cases). This makes Jack easy to root for, even though he has made some self-destructive (though understandable) choices.

Theres a lot of bad language throughout, and some pretty racy sex, both of which are not necessary. Were not in Disneyland, true, but it does remind of the old question, just what, exactly, is entertainment? We can enjoy MIDSOMER MURDERS, GEORGE GENTLY and POIROT and others without being subjected to such things which might turn off some viewers. Its always worth mentioning in reviews that certain content may not appeal. Having said that, there is far more to enjoy in JACK IRISH than there is to condemn.

For those who welcome JACK IRISH as the latest in Acorn Medias phenomenal output of great television, there are two more JACK IRISH books currently being adapted for production, and a fifth novel in the works.

I have been a Guy Pearce fan since ""Memento,"" and he is great in these Australian crime dramas.  The plots are intriguing, the acting was convincing, and there is even a bit of dark humor afoot.  The story lines made me think of Raymond Chandler's classic detective novels.

In Jack Irish, Pearce takes some pretty common scripts and themes (investigator with demons etc) and elevates the material with the force of his acting.  Few modern actors can really inhabit a character like Pearce, really the only one coming to mind being Idris Elba.  As Irish, Pearce treads the line between someone you root for and rather pathetic and despicable character, leaving us with what is so rarely seen, especially on American TV:  a real character.  It is an excellent start and I look forward to more from this character.",1387411200,,809,4.784172661870503
5449587,4,B00ALX3QBQ,"...even if the start is a little cliche and shaky.

Set in Pearce's native land of Australia, Jack Irish (based on the novels by Peter Temple) is a broken man, having lost his wife to an extremely disgruntled former client, he drinks... collects money for the local mob... and occasionally gets involved in private investigations.

This set contains two feature length cases: Bad Debts and Black Tide

Bad Debts introduces us to Jack with the opening murder scene of his wife, then thrusts us into his fallen lifestyle. Muddled in the middle of his downward spiral is another old client who he calls for help, but who ends up dead after a violent confrontation with police what would appear justified on the surface, but feels wrong to Jack. The journey this one death takes him on covers police corruption, corporate fraud and malfeasance, and the possible fall of the government. To help him on his quest, Jack enlists (and romances) a reporter, his mob buddies, and old connections to the case.

Black Tide picks up a few months down the line from where Bad Debts ends, with Jack and Linda an item, but separated (and things are tense). An old rugby buddy of his deceased father's comes around looking for legal help concerning a debt on his house that he didn't know he had... which leads to more corporate fraud, the drug trade, and bloody murder.

While it's a little rough, Jack Irish is still a quality drama that is well above the standards of most prime time procedural. It helps that Guy Pearce is the lead, most assuredly, and being a ABC/Acorn production (ABC as in Australia Broadcasting Corporation) helps its pedigree. They've been putting out a lot of good mysteries lately, like Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries and the like.

If you're a fan of the modern era of Masterpiece Mysteries, Wallander, or Annika Bengtzon, Jack Irish is right up your alley. Smart, occasionally witty, and tense right up until the end... the series is modern noir done almost perfectly, only needing a bit more in the cinematography, writing, and mood departmens (getting 4 out of 5 in each of those).",1387324800,2,2095,4.773480662983426

Mumbling isn't cool no matter what your dialect. When characters mumble or speak unintelligibly subtitles should be put on the screen. Yes, I know I can use subtitles permanently , but I shouldn't HAVE to. Dialog should be clear if it is meant to be, or subtitled when it intentionally intelligible. Jack himself is a handsome, likeable character, although the alcoholic PI or man who goes off the deep end because of the death of his wife is a bit overdone especially in crime drama. But about one hour and fifteen minutes into this, I simply lost interest. I didn't really care whether the crime was solved or not, or who the bad guy was, or if Jack hooked up with his girlfriend again, or achieved redemption for his bad past.  I had thoroughly lost interest. That's too bad. There were some interesting elements. Just did not care what happened to him or whether he ever solved his crime, because the storyline was bleak, difficult to follow and filled with characters I only had marginal interest in.",1386288000,4,1176,4.653846153846154

Major problem: the Aussie accent is almost completely impenetrable and there are no subtitles.  Other reviewers have complained about the fact that the actors tend to mumble; that accentuates the problem with the accents.  For whole passages you get elongated vowel sounds as you struggle to understand what the characters are saying.

Guy Pearce is a superb actor, so if you can understand what he and his fellow actors are saying, go for it.  Otherwise, be very wary before you plunk down your hard-earned cash.",1386201600,3,690,5.0

Still, if you are a fan of a decent, modern day suspense/mystery then this might be a series you could enjoy. The American series are more easily digestible and more obviously entertaining, the British series seem to be a bit more understated and slower. The Australian series tend to fall somewhere in between. Hope that helps!",1386028800,,750,4.769230769230769
5449592,4,B00ALX3QBQ,"Jack Irish Set One is a DVD with two episodes from the Australian television series.

Jack Irish is a former lawyer.  The demise of Irish's law career is only hinted at; however, it seems pretty clear that the title character became an alcoholic and was no longer able to function as an attorney some time after his fianc&eacute; was killed in cold blood by a disgruntled, former client.  Now the more or less sober Irish makes ends meet by functioning as a debt collector for a bookie.  Fortunately for the viewer, Jack seems to have a knack for getting himself stuck in the middle of unsolved murder mysteries.  The series is long on character and both included episodes a while to get revved up, but the payoff is generally worth it.

The DVD contains two, feature length (about 1 hour 40 minutes) TV movies: Bad Debts and Black Tide. The DVD is short on extras--there's only a single 'behind the scenes' video that is about 17 minutes in length.  There is also a prolonged promo for Acorn TV--the online video service dedicated to bringing the 'best' of British (and in this case Aussie) television to the US.  One important note: this is Australian TV.  The level of violence and nudity exceeds what you might expect from US network TV, but doesn't nearly reach HBO levels.

In Bad Debts, Jack ends up trying to find out why one of his former clients was murdered.  He crosses paths with a beautiful and resourceful reporter Linda Hillier and ends up embroiled in a conspiracy that cuts deep into city politics and the highest ranks of the police force.  In the second episode, Black Tide, Irish tries to help a friend find his lost son, Gary. As it turns out, there is far more to Gary's disappearance than meets the eye.

Both dramas are entertaining enough, but take a fair amount of time to wind up.  American audiences may lack the patience for the first 30 to 40 minutes of each of these dramas. Although I thought that the pay off was more than adequate, more time is spent on the development of mood and brood than on action.  The odd thing, however, is that more time is spent on ancillary character chatter than is spent on thickening of the plot or character development per se.

Don't get me wrong, I didn't find any of this to be boring.  The parts are all well played from Guy Pearce's brooding Irish to the crusty, elderly denizens of the local pub. Everyone seems real and authentic. At the beginning of each episode, there are enough micro bursts of character to keep up your interest, but very little that pushes the plot forward.  Once things get going, however, there is ample payoff at the climax.

As noted above, the acting is superb.  So superb that the actors don't seem like they're acting; the characters are 100% believable as played.  The dialogue, which is often sparse and nearly Pinteresque, is also quite realistic.  For good or for ill, the dialogue is devoid of many of the usual gestures that you expect in this genre.  On the one hand, it's refreshing that they aren't playing to the usual cliches, but at the same time there are no grounding or orienting cues.  The actors also do not try for filmic diction.  As an American listening to British or Australian accents, I almost never have a problem understanding the dialogue.  However, the speech here is often quick and mumbled--perfectly in character, but sometimes difficult for the non-Aussie to understand.  I had to play some scenes back a couple of times until I got it.

The mood is clearly film noir. The cinematography, however, is a bit uneven. When at its best, the overall look is slightly dark and quite feature film in quality.  Oddly, this contrasts with some segments that look more like low-budget television footage (especially some outdoor scenes and some of the chase scenes).

In spite of any shortcomings, however, I really like Pearce's Irish and I will look forward to seeing more of him. This is definitely a different take on television crime dramas than we may be used to in the United States. Is it 'must see TV?'  Probably not.  But it is certainly high-end television; far from your average crime drama and well worth a look.",1385856000,,4150,4.642465753424657

5449596,4,B00ALX3QBQ,"As with many Acorn products, two things are generally assured: high quality and high price. As I write this, the latter is certainly the case; the former is present, too. This set consists of two 100-minute mysteries from the novels of Peter Temple (whom I have not read): The two episodes, ""Bad Debts"" and ""Black Tide"" feature Jack Irish, a former lawyer who now makes his living in a variety of ways, including debt collecting and investigating (and being an apprentice woodworker). In the first episode, originally aired on Australian television in 2012, Jack finds himself drawn into the investigation of a former client's death. Prior to the death, the client reached out to Jack, only to be ignored. Now, Jack finds himself back in a life he hoped to avoid. The second episode is somewhat more straightforward (in that there is less need to set up the character and his past).

I found the first episode somewhat slow, but ultimately, I liked the setting, the character (or, more accurately, Guy Pearce's portrayal of the character), and the level of intelligence in the plot. The acting is restrained, leading to a more subtle crime story than is common in American television. I understand that there will be at least one more episode coming up. I will be happy to watch it when it becomes available, but it won't be on my must-see list since, as much as I admired these two episodes, they did not captivate me.",1385683200,,1419,4.744939271255061

5449598,2,B00ALX3QBQ,"First, I thought that this DVD was the first few episodes of a TV series so it came as a rude surprise when the first ""episode"" (Bad Debt) kept going on and on (I think it ended up being 90 minutes). I went back and looked at the Amazon product page after that, and feel that there is not enough explanation of exactly what you're getting.

I have loved Guy Pearce in everything I've seen him in, but this? Not so much. And even then, he was pretty much the best thing about the piece. His character was a lawyer before a horrible incident sent him into a tailspin. He became a vengeance-seeking vigilante trying to uncover the circumstances surrounding this awful deed.

This is an Australian production and most of the accents are bordering on unintelligible. Additionally, there seemed to be a lot of mumbling going on, which doesn't help when you already are having trouble deciphering an accent. I had plans to commit myself to watching the whole DVD in one evening (2 movies at around 90 minutes each). Not an hour into the first one, I found myself picking up my Kindle Fire to check Facebook and email. I think I may have fallen asleep at some point too, though it was nowhere near bedtime. I think I made it to the end of Bad Debts, but there was no way in hell I was watching the second one that night.

I don't know that I can put into words why it did not keep my interest, other than the fact it's hard to keep up with what's going on when you are having a hard time understanding the dialogue. And the whole mood is so dark and dreary. I understand he's had a horrible thing happen, but geez, it was just so morose and bleak.

I am glad I watched the second episode.  While just as slow - probably even more plodding - it added a lot of humor and the story-line was a fun, twisty ride.  Maybe, it's my American TV sensibilities, but I feel that these ""feature length episodes"" could be easily wrapped up in an hour.  The moody wandering around to musical interludes are about 10 minutes of each episode.  I prefer this old school sleuthing (Jack says he's pre-Google) over today's attention deficit CSI cutaways, but this is just a little too slow for me.",1385510400,,783,4.5177304964539005
5449600,3,B00ALX3QBQ,"I wanted to like this more than I did, but in the end, the banality of the stories in the set made it difficult to marshal up more than a lukewarm enthusiasm for this Australian noir series.  Jack Irish is an Australian lawyer whose worldview takes an understandable nose dive when his wife is murdered by a crazed, distraught client.  Abandoning his lucrative practice with a well-heeled law firm, he takes to heavy drinking and hanging out with some rather dodgy characters, including a horse race fixer and his bodyguard/driver/legbreaker, as well as some amusing old-timers with a rabid love of a football team that has moved on to play in another town.  When he's not drinking and helping to fix horse races, Jack does the odd bit of work for former clients and old friends, work that could prevent powerful and ruthless men from making heaps of money in the drug trade and real estate scams.  Naturally, this makes the powerful and ruthless men want to kill Jack and everyone he knows.

All this sounds terribly interesting and it should be, except that it's not.  The mysteries themselves manage to be both lackluster and confusing, and I found myself watching not to see how it would all turn out, but for the odd bits of interaction among the side characters who make up Jack's collection of friends: the Fitzroy alte kakkers who hang out at his favorite pub watching 30 year old ball games, the world weary German cabinetmaker who's actually trying to teach Jack how to go on living in the face of life's cruelties, and Cam, the philosophical hired muscle working for the horse race fixer.

Although I could understand what was being said fairly well, I turned on the subtitles to get a better grasp on the slang and keep up with the story more easily.  For example, in one story, Jack and Cam go down to ""Tassie.""  Seeing the word on the screen instead of having to suss it out made it quicker and easier for me to realize that they were in Tasmania.  You'll also get the correct spelling for various idiomatic words and phrases, which makes it easier to look them up online.

My husband and I initially watched together and both of us agreed we'd love to see more of this series - which had numerous sub-plots, likable main characters, very unlikable devious minor characters, and others who just rounded out the stories. I watched the DVD two more times by myself, and liked it the 2nd and 3rd times just as much - which is unheard of for me - I'm not much of a repeat customer on DVD's ... occasionally I'll watch something twice, but very rarely three times! This is just a really great series!

There's really nothing to compare it to in the U.S. - at least nothing that jumps to mind. I can tell you a little about it, but be forewarned:
SPOILER ALERT!
As the 1st scene opens, Jack and his beautiful young wife are talking about domestic things, and as they descend the stairs an angry client bursts in through the front door ... yelling about his case, how Jack hadn't listened to him, and he spent all this time in jail because of that. Another man in the office says he's going to call the police, but Jack says not to, and shortly after that hear a shot in the background. Jack rushes out to see what it is, and he sees the client with the gun, starts to try to calm him down, and then realizes his wife has been fatally shot! At which point the client turns the gun on himself and commits suicide!

Jack goes from a well-groomed, suit wearing lawyer in the 1st scene, to a handsome yet scruffy, dressed-down P.I. of sorts investigating private matters for people whom he knows ... or knows of, in one way or another - some more dangerous than others. During one of his particularly dangerous cases Jack gets involved with a female journalist. She's very sophisticated, with a dry wit, and a great sense of self assurance. She's no push-over either ... she won't settle for anything less than what she's after - which is a great story, and if there's some great sex and also a relationship along the way, that works too!

We also really liked the guys Jack went to the horse track with. They're two kind of salty guys - one short and round - the boss, and the other was tall, dark, slim, with dark wavy hair, and a sparkling smile. When Jack gets into a bind and they're with him,  they're  prepared with the necessary guns and ammo to get by.

The main plot involves government level corruption, a cover-up, stalking, chases, and spying. When they find out Jack has his nose in their business, they bring him in to have a talk with him, and it appears Jack can't be bought - although it's obvious he is just a bit scared and rightfully so.",1385510400,2,2654,4.384146341463414

I missed a lot of it on my first viewing because my son felt compelled to bring the house down around me while I tried to watch it, so I came back later when I had some quiet time to myself. I'm glad I did.

Sure, Jack Irish is, on the surface, typical of the genre: sad, haunted by his past, scruffy. (I understand it's part of his ""look,"" but it bugged me that Jack couldn't be bothered to take a shower and shave before a big fancy dinner.) Pearce plays Jack almost dully, but that makes his occasional zinger hit harder. Jack himself is sort of a cypher, but he's surrounded by interesting, entertaining characters, including a group of old footballers at the pub who idolized Jack's father; the underused but vastly amusing Aaron Pederson; and the Australian Oliver Platt (Pearce's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Hard-Word/dp/B002RIXNRU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Hard Word</a>&nbsp;co-star Damien Richardson). Jack's romantic entanglements are believable; his relationship with his woodworker ""master"" is short on words but big on heart. (The scene where Jack fixes up the shop is masterfully done.)

Consider me a fan. I look forward to future entries in the series.",1385251200,,1925,5.653979238754325
5449607,4,B00ALX3QBQ,"Based on the novels of Peter Temple this set includes the first two movies originally produced for Australian television: Bad Debts and Black Tide.

Jack Irish (played by Guy Pearce) is a former criminal lawyer who, after his wife was killed by a disgruntled descends into an alcoholic haze.  He spends his time collecting debts, working as a PI on the lower end of the scale and drinking at the Prince of Prussia pub.  Then an old client turns up dead and Jack finds himself drawn back into the world he had left behind.

In Black Tide Jack is contacted by an old teammate of his father's--Jack's father was a once famous Australian footballer--  to find his son and the money his son took with him when he disappeared. Like Bad Debts this is only one strand of a far more complex and interesting case with a pretty high body count.

Guy Pearce does noir right.  There's some dark humor and a lot of drinking, but when the chips are down Jack comes through.  There's supposedly a third firm that was to start filming this year and the promise of one based on the fourth Temple novel in this series.

I'm very pleased to find another series available in the US from a legitimate source.  Let's have some more now. And PI fans, do not miss this one.",1385251200,,1248,4.434210526315789
5449608,4,B00ALX3QBQ,"From the first horrific scene, Bad Debt takes the viewer on a roller-coaster ride with Jack Irish.  Jack used to be an attorney, until one of his clients kind of crossed the line.  Now, a former client's calls to Jack for help went unanswered and the client shows up dead.  Despite the Police Commissioner's claims to the contrary, Jack knows the client was clean. and flawed, Jack and his boyish grin get the girl, get the criminals and solve the case.

Based on a popular book series, the producers tried to stay faithful to the novels.  There is a large, very large, cast of characters; something like 40 in the first movie alone.  It can get confusing, as ca the sometimes incomprehensible Aussie accents.  Fortunately, Acorn provides a scene by scene option, as well as subtitles, though some of the ironic humor is lost.

I didn't like the second movie as much as the first.  Jack's bad luck with women got a little dreary, and the aforementioned women's pleas for understanding were a bit tedious,  ""I didn't mean it, Jack!""  They whine.  I like romance as much as the next chick, but this wasn't very romance-y.  The strong woman partner Jack had in Linda, a feisty reporter in Bad Debt, really fizzled in the second movie, and I was very disappointed.

For those accustomed to the sanitized and pretty U.S. TV,  and those easily offended, there's nudity, fairly explicit sex, and very strong language in these movies.  The corpses look like corpses.  That's all I'm saying.

I really enjoy detective stories set in other cultures.  Jack Irish does justice to the Australian landscape, interiors,  and brashness.  This pair of movies is well worth watching and I'm off to read the books.",1385251200,,1695,4.756013745704467

I won't spend time discussing the plot, because others have already done that.  But Jack Irish is enjoyable.

I didn't love it, but I liked it.  4 stars.",1385164800,,345,4.328125
5449610,4,B00ALX3QBQ,"I recently watched Top of the Lake and was hungry for another character driven thriller. Jack Irish was perfect for me.

Guy Pearce is an amazing actor. You believe in him just as much when he is at the top as when he is on his way down. The back story is necessarily sad but compelling. His fall from high flying criminal lawyer to a some times  detective made sense. I do wish that just once we could get a character that was complex and tormented that wasn't a drunk or a drug addict but alas- jack Irish is a lush.

But he is also a person. And that part of him was very likable.

Jack Irish has a more subdued production quality. If it was made in the US it would be much more amped up. The comparative simplicity gives jack and his stories more gravity and more dignity. His friend ship with his mentor made him more interesting too.

I was surprised to see that there were just two episodes. But they are quite long- like a movie. They are not comparable to the 44 minute episodes in the US.",1385164800,,998,4.177083333333333

8553429,4,B00ALX3QBQ,"""Jack Irish: Bad Debts"" is a movie made for Australian television based on the mystery novel by Peter Temple. The titular character Jack Irish (Guy Pearce) is a defense lawyer in Melbourne, Australia who quit practicing law after an unstable client murdered his dear wife Isabel (Emma Booth). Ever since, Jack has been living by his wits as a gambler and debt collector. He bets on horses with wealthy investor Harry Strang (Roy Billing) and best friend Cam Delroy (Aaron Pedersen), and he apprentices in cabinetmaking with Charlie Taub (Vadim Glowna). While he is away on business in Sydney, old client Danny McKillop (Simon Russell), who went to prison on a hit-and-run conviction, leaves several messages on Jack's phone. Upon Jack's return, he finds that McKillop is dead, shot by a police officer in a car park. Feeling guilty, Danny attends the memorial service and learns from McKillop's wife (Alicia Gardener) that a mystery woman recently contacted Danny about evidence that would prove his innocence in the death ten years earlier. Jack feels compelled to investigate.

On the face of it, ""Jack Irish"" reminds me of Jackson Brodie from the Scottish detective series ""Case Histories"", based on books by Kate Atkinson. Both characters left their professions due to personal issues to become private investigators, though Jack Irish is not officially an investigator. But Jack Irish is a far more functional and watchable character than Brodie. He's not falling apart; he's not a loser; he just doesn't feel up to the things he did while his wife was alive. He has acquired a laid-back demeanor to complement the lawyer cool, as he spends his life gambling, woodworking, and passing time at the pub. In ""Bad Debts,"" Jack is assisted by hard-nosed journalist Linda Hillier (Marta Dusseldorp), tall, blond, and divorced. I found Linda overbearing, ill-mannered, and unpleasant to watch. I wonder if the writers mistook these characteristics for confidence and assertiveness in a woman. Otherwise, I like the supporting cast. The plot is labyrinthine, good old-fashioned municipal corruption  hackneyed but entertaining. The movie runs 1 hour 40 min.",1502928000,,2154,5.204610951008646
