Would rather have more extensive race footage of each round similar to the WSBK annual reviews. Understand what they were going for here but I'd rather see more actual racing.",1521417600,,323,4.586206896551724
8251050,5,B0013I97SE,I enjoyed every minute of this video. I was at the final race of the season but saw much more of it on this video than I did in person!,1377993600,,135,3.533333333333333
8251051,1,B0013I97SE,"Once again the Americans show how not to make a sporting review. I don't know how they get it so consistently wrong. Fans want to see a race by race breakdown of the seasons races and that includes predominantly race footage with a few relevant interviews, some statistics, graphics and possibly a bit of technical stuff, but mainly the racing. Instead what you get here and with most other AMA or NASCAR compilations is anything but. I don't want to see endless boring interviews and examples of the Directors need to be arty by showing unconnected crowd scenes. None of this rubbish either entertains or enlightens me, it just makes me want to go to sleep. Perhaps the Directors are more used to making cooking or lifestyle shows but they certainly know nothing about Motorsport. We also don't need hosts who try to hog the limelight from the actual riders. Commentators should be nearly invisible and confine themselves to voiceovers where relevant and appropriate intros and commentary. For most fans the sound of the bikes is music enougth but as with most American productions they see fit to add a soundtrack of boring, by the numbers, middle of the road rock music. I'm afraid it got to the point where I almost turned the sound off and cranked up my stereo, and I certainly will if I watch this a second time. Another thing that is incredibly irritating is the way they have started this feature at the last race and then relied on flashbacks for the preceding events, what were they thinking? This is not some Hollywood epic dealing with secret agents suffering from amnesia or an old man recalling his storied youth, it's a season review! No wonder they've stopped producing this compilation in recent years as people have probably lost interest. Sure the racing wasn't the greatest with Spies and Mladin dominating but it was still worthy of something better than this. I love Motorcyle Racing and want to see as much of it on DVD as I can, but this is awful. It pains me to say that I can only give this one star.",1270598400,2,2026,4.646239554317549
