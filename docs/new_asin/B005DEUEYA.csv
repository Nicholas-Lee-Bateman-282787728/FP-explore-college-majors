4658680,2,B005DEUEYA,"Meagan Good works at a curio shop for a perfectionist. When she gets an opportunity to dance in hip-hop videos she tries it out. The young director takes a personal interest in Meagan who can't resist him.

Meagan spirals downward as her career goes upward. She has dreams were she talks to her dead sister who tries to get her on the right path. The film was packed with cliches, stereotypes, and mediocre acting. To assist Meagan in her downward/upward spiral, other video girls influence her.

Meagan is excellent as a video girl, but the rest of the film lacks credibility and is clearly a ""come to Jesus"" film. Message: People who do drugs, do so because there is a void in their life. I was so bored with the film, it created a void in my life...

No nudity. Rape attack.",1318636800,10,777,4.457746478873239

4658691,1,B005DEUEYA,I am extremely irritated. Amazon notified me that this video wasn't available in HD for my laptop (MacBook Pro) which is annoying enough as it is. But then they charged me the HD price anyways while I was stuck watching SD. Super annoying. Why charge me more when you can't deliver?,1428278400,,282,4.549019607843137

4658697,3,B005DEUEYA,The movie was great at least the part I could see. I was unable to watch the entire movie because it just froze and skipped to another area close to the end. Very disappointed but lesson learned maybe not continue to buy movies off line because too much trouble to send back whereas locally I can just go back to the store and return.,1389052800,,334,4.234375
4658698,3,B005DEUEYA,"I rate this movie ok because the plot could have been better. Meagan Good is a good actor and the movie shows how some  actors in real life is about getting you a career but majority of the actors are sleezy that all they see you as is basically a prostitute. Booze, drugs, sex is examples of sleezy actors. They see a sexy woman trying to get a career they convince them to come to their apartment, condo, home, etc. take pics there after they offer drinks maybe slip a mickey in it, have sex with them and its a rap.",1378166400,,518,4.128712871287129

4658703,5,B005DEUEYA,This was a great movie about video females trying to make it big. I have a  different kind of respect for them because I didn't know it was all like that. Dang.,1357603200,,160,4.0
4658704,5,B005DEUEYA,"I really did like this movie. To me Ms. Good is a great actress, may be on TCM down the road. We have grand-daughter telling us they want to be actress in movies. I will let them watch this next year, when the oldest girls is 9. We train a child in the way they should go, with God. But as we know, being in the world ourselves. Teens young adults must see things for themselves to really understand what grownup try to protect them from, as with Video Girl.
  Meagan get's to experience a life that many will only dream of. She will share first hand what woman may face in the business of entertainment. You will see the ups and downs, from struggling to making it to deep thoughts of wondering if it's really worth it. One must know their own limits not the limits of so call friends. Like Friends don't let friends drink and drive, but today kids. That's my friend, she got drunk with me.....Sad, but true.

Learn from others what you witness. You may say in your head, ""I'll never allow myself to be like that."" She thought the same. Know your limits and stick to them. ""But as for me and my house, We will serve the Lord."" Be there for your kids when they fall Parents.",1356566400,3,1174,4.232142857142857

4658707,1,B005DEUEYA,"I watched this movie thinking it might be a Honey knockoff and probably not that great but I like movie that show decent dancers. I was thoroughly disappointed. Not only does this movie have crappy dialogue, no story arc, but it's so poorly shot that it could have been shot by a high schooler. The part where they shoot a music video in front of a green screen made me want to throw my remote at the tv. It was so poorly lit that you could see artifacting on Meagan Good. So if you want to buy a movie that isn't even good enough to wipe your ass with then Video Girl is right for you! One star because you can't go any lower.",1352851200,,627,4.064516129032258
4658708,3,B005DEUEYA,"The story of a good girl gone bad...heard it all before! The acting is acceptable but the storyline is played and fails to offer much more than the usually. However, it does show that there's light at the end of the tunnel; you just have to get there.",1349740800,,251,4.25
4658709,5,B005DEUEYA,I plan to return the video. The DVD does not play the digital contents does not display. I was told I could not exchange the item for another. I'm awiting to see when you get another copy in stock.,1349049600,,197,4.076923076923077

This movie made me like her agin, she played this role really well. And that's her real sister, for some of u guys that didn't know, she was in that group Iysys in the early 2000's.",1348617600,,296,3.95
4658711,4,B005DEUEYA,It could have been worse. But it wasn't that bad. What can you expect? Its about a video girl! duh lol Not much of a plot but it is a little interesting if you are trying to break into that type of business.

4658713,1,B005DEUEYA,"This movie is HORRIBLE.  The acting is lacking and even die-hard Meagan Good fans will be disappointed.  Save your money and rent it at Redbox if you absolutely must see it.  Otherwise, skip it.  In my opinion, it is not even worth the Redbox charge of 1.28!",1332547200,4,258,4.425531914893617

4658715,3,B005DEUEYA,"Meagan Good performance was exceptional as a young timid girl from a small neighborhood find her way through the urban music industry in Hollywood.

The quality of the movie was great, though the film felt a bit rushed but what is there to express through film of what we already know about ""video girls?""
Angel Lola Luv, Lisa Raye, Melissa Ford, Suelyn, and Esther Baxter...the Hip Hop Video model heavyweights blessed this film and validated the title of this film.

So that's it really.",1326585600,,489,4.809523809523809
4658716,2,B005DEUEYA,"A small town girl named Lorie Walker is injured, which forces her to abandon her dreams of becoming a professional ballerina. After a chance encounter with an old friend, she is convinced to appear in a rap music video. The director of said video is immediately smitten with her beauty and takes her away to Los Angeles to become a Video Model.

The music video's Lorie appears in are of the lowest common denominator standard (her debut video seems to only consist of the lyrics ""I got a big booty cutie"" repeated over and over) and her roles only demand that she stand around and look pretty for the camera. If you are not a casual fan of modern (and may I say, low grade) hip-hop, these will be the first hurdles you have to cross to become invested in this film.

There are pacing issues throughout the film. Sometimes scenes seem to drag on, then other moments  rocket to moments that are overly dramatic without warning. For example, soon after we watch Lorie stand around at work (which IS her work), then go on a boring date, we see her sister get slaughtered outside of a gas station. Before we have a chance to catch our breaths, we're right back to a series of scenes that slow the story telling to a crawl.

Having Lorie's sister dying seemed to only be included so that her ghost could visit Lorie in her dreams and offer her moral support...I suppose phone calls would have been too dull a concept for the screenwriter. Such a tragic event should have anchored Lorie, but instead it only makes for temporary guilt trips down memory lane before she vaults right back into lines of cocaine.

Speaking of those lines of cocaine, Lorie's downward spiral is typical of these types of films. She is new to Hollywood so it is only a matter of time before she falls in with the wrong crowd and loses herself to drugs. Lorie goes from being the most in-demand girl for rap videos (for what that's worth) to being kicked off of the set for, what appears to be, choosing not to stand still during scenes. Naturally, the stakes are raised higher than that, as her drug use makes her start to alienate her true friends, including her best friend from her old town who has recently signed with the NBA...because apparently she came from a town of lottery winners who eat four leaf clovers for each meal, as well as getting nearly raped by a sleazy ""movie"" producer while high.

Meagan Good, who plays Lorie, is a talented young actress who helps to make this story function on some level. If not for her performance, this film could have been intolerable.

Writer/Director Doc Duhame does try to add some flare with a few stylish shot choices and scene setups, proving that he is competent behind the camera, but he the story he has written is still predictable and overly long.

4658718,2,B005DEUEYA,"I'm a big Meagan Good fan and I think Adam Senn is cute. So that was pretty much my only motivation for watching this movie. But it's not bad, has a good message, and is enjoyable somewhat (not boring).
Pros of movie: Meagan Good is beautiful. Adam Senn is beautiful. We get to see two beautiful people in a romantic storyline.
Cons of movie: Low budget, the acting is not so good. The music is annoying. And the ending is predictable.",1321142400,,435,4.382716049382716

4658720,5,B005DEUEYA,"I thought the movie at the beginning was a little slow but it picked up quickly. I love Meagan good and she clearly explains that the movie was to relisticly show that not all that glitters is gold. A lot of young impressionable girls watch music videos and envy the video vixens wanting to be ""like them,"" but the film definantly gives a realistic view of that life-style. I thought the movie was inspiring and I believe that it sends a good message to young adolescents about life in the fast lane. The movie was great, don't believe the haters!
