Faerie Tale Theatre's ""The Princess Who Had Never Laughed"" is very, very bad.  Starring Ellen Barkin, Howard Hesseman and Howie Mandel, it tells a bland story with worn-out humor that is old the first time one hears it.

An extremely serious king, played by Hesseman, has forbidden laughter in his kingdom and condemns his daughter to constant study.  The kingdom's comical rebel, affectionately known as 'Weinerhead' Waldo, goes on his silly way oblivious of the king's disapproval.  Frankly, though, the jokes Howie Mandel tells are so cheesy that it's hard to see where he's breaking any rules.  Through an unlikely and dull series of events, Mandel's Waldo ends up plying his shtick for the king and princess, played nicely by Ellen Barkin.

It pains me to write this review because I do appreciate much of the other work produced featuring Hesseman, Barkin, and Mandel but this Faerie Tale Theatre episode should have never seen the light of day.",1270857600,,968,5.0125
7826758,4,6302492882,"THE PRINCESS WHO HAD NEVER LAUGHED is one of the lesser-known tales featured in the FAERIE TALE THEATRE series, though it's up there with the best.

In a kingdom where fun and frivolity is forbidden, a Princess will discover the greatest treasure is something she can't buy...

Princess Henrietta (Ellen Barkin) lives a life dominated by lessons, lessons and more lessons.  Her only friends are her poe-faced father the King (Howard Hesseman), the tutor (Barrie Ingham) and governess (Mary Woronov).  When her life becomes too much to bear she retreats to her room and won't come out unless someone makes her laugh.

Enter 'Weinerhead' Waldo (Howie Mandel), who's considered the most funny boy in the kingdom.  Will he make Henrietta laugh, or perhaps even capture her heart?  Wait and see!

Probably one of the strongest casts ever assembled for a single episode of FAERIE TALE THEATRE; Ellen Barkin is a delight as Henrietta, Howard Hesseman (DOCTOR DETROIT) is hilarious as the king and Mary Woronov (of Andy Warhol-CHELSEA GIRLS fame) is excellent as the strait-laced governess.",1099958400,8,1082,5.107954545454546
