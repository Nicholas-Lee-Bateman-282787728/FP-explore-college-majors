5802911,3,B00DHJT4DU,"To this day, World War II is the deadliest military conflict in the history of man - with an estimated casualty count of anywhere from 50 to 85 million lives lost.  The war ended nearly 70 years ago, but its still fresh in a lot of peoples minds, especially since theres no shortage of films featuring the wide variety of events that took place during the six-year (plus one day) war.  From films like Schindlers List and The Longest Day to Flags of Our Fathers and Patton, new generations are able to get a glimpse and be reminded  through superb filmmaking reenactments, of what bravery looked like in the early 1940s.  However, heroics were not just reserved for the individuals that enlisted or who were drafted to protect their county, but also for those that took on their own cause.  And, in the case of the film, The Monuments Men  it was a cause of devotion to recovery and preservation.

The Monuments Men, which is based on the novel of the same name by Robert M. Edsel, is directed by George Clooney (Leatherheads, The Ides of March), who also stars as Frank Stokes  an army leader of a group of men devoted to the cause of preserving art in Europe during World War II.  With the war nearly over and the Germans in near full retreat, Stokes enlists the help of several fellow art enthusiasts, including James Granger (Matt Damon), Richard Campbell (Bill Murray), and Walter Garfield (John Goodman), to accompany him to Europe and maneuver around the final skirmishes to begin tracking down precious pieces of art that should be recovered and preserved for the good of culture and humanity.

Nazi leader Adolf Hitler was a well-known lover of art and even an artist himself in his younger years.  As the dictator of Germany, he plans to construct and open a Fhrer museum and orders his officers to steal the most precious art pieces ever created, including the Alterpiece  which is comprised of several different panel paintings.  The Altarpiece, along with several other priceless paintings and sculptures fall into the hands of the Nazis, and the officers have orders that  in the event Hitler falls  to burn and destroy everything.

Looking to make contact with anyone that might be able to help them, Granger eventually meets a former museum curator and supposed French traitor, Claire (Cate Blanchett), who might possibly know the locations of the art.  But, with time running out, it has put the men in the difficult position of each trying to individually find their own leads to recover the Nazi-possessed art.  The only question is: will they be able to locate the stolen items before the Nazi army has the opportunity to destroy it?

Much like Saving Private Ryan, The Monuments Men is about a group of men that are assembled with one specific task.  However, unlike Saving Private Ryan, this film lacks a clear, specific goal other than the randomized repossession of stolen art.  These men are not regulars in the army and are nothing more than art enthusiasts  meaning for much of the film they appear to be randomly wondering the countryside like a chicken with their heads cut off chasing after nothing in particular.  In the beginning, this film attempts to make it about retrieving one specific item  the Altarpiece, yet if thats the lone goal, the underlying premise will often elude your thoughts.  And, eventually emotional attachment comes into play as Clooneys character sets his sights on recovering one sculpture, called The Madonna of Bruges.

This film may star two high-profile actors in George Clooney and Matt Damon, but this film hardly highlights either one of them.  Oddly enough, this is a film less about specific acting ability and more about the occasionally broad story itself.  The wide range of characters is given relatively equal screen time, although it may lean a bit more so in the direction of Matt Damon  whose mission appears to be slightly more important than the rest.  Still, seeing John Goodman and Bill Murray in this film obviously lightens the mood, making a for a few brief moments of ironic humor  the most memorable of which takes place during their brief stint in basic training.

Honestly, the lovers of action-packed war films will be vastly disappointed in what this film has to off you.  Sure, there are encounters that require the abbreviated use of weaponry, but thats not exactly the point of this flick.  The war is coming to its end, and as you might have already anticipated, it causes this film to drag on more often than not.  Imagine a film where all you see is men cleaning up the mess after all the action takes place and thats roughly what youll see here.  Still, for me personally (as a lover of everything history-based), the lagging story wasn't that noticeable  but for anyone that doesnt find historical films to be all that entertaining (at least without action), this film could understandably feel like it goes on for an eternity rather than two hours.

Overall, The Monuments Men focuses on an isolated story that took place right about the time the dust was settling.  To that end, its commendable that a story like this receives attention  yet the film is noticeably clustered and lacks a prime directive.  Its as though the assertion is there but the emotion is absent.  The characters are spread extremely thin as far as their back-stories go and it makes it difficult to resonate with their individual predicaments as the story progresses.  History enthusiasts might find a certain amount of enjoyment or entertainment in this story, but for a film with unmistakably high-profile actors, it easy to see how this film could be a monumental disappointment  no pun intended.

5802912,4,B00DHJT4DU,"A refreshing new dimension on the Second World War. This film provides a welcome change from all the conventional war films. Here the mission is to save cultural monuments and art, etc. Although the film has a strong historic background, I believe that the Nazis did not want only to destroy art and monuments but also to steal them. Hitler 'owned' one of the largest such collections of art stolen from conquered neighbours.
  George Clooney (like his father) has a social conscience about his work. In a recent interview he was honest enough to agree that the so-called Elgin Marbles (stolen from the Acropolis and still housed in the British Museum) should be returned to Greece where they belong. This was an entertaining film with a great cast. I hope that a sequel will be made about all the treasures stolen from the Museum in Baghdad!",1391817600,2,842,4.760273972602739
5802913,4,B00DHJT4DU,"""The Monument Men"" is a fun, old-fashioned, feel good movie. I walked out of the theater inspired. The movie isn't perfect but its gifts outweigh its flaws.

""The Monument Men"" tells the story of a group of art experts recruited by the US armed forces during WW II to ensure that Europe's artistic heritage was not destroyed in the war.

Hitler had been a painter before he became fuhrer. Joseph Goebbels was a novelist. Speer was an architect. Filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl did as much to spread Nazism as many troops. Nazis didn't just mass murder human beings. They burned books and paintings. They worked very hard to destroy ""decadent"" art and to elevate and appropriate art they deemed worthy. Nazis plundered and stockpiled other countries' art. Just the other day, Feburary 6, 2014, art the Nazis stole from Poland was repatriated. In January, 2014, the World Jewish Congress demanded that Germany do a better job of returning art.

There's a long tradition of World War II movies about international, all-star teams of experts uniting to achieve some goal: ""The Great Escape,"" ""The Guns of Navarone,"" ""Kelly's Heroes,"" ""Dirty Dozen,"" ""The Longest Day,"" ""A Bridge Too Far."" And of course George Clooney is a veteran of the ""Oceans"" movies.

""The Monument Men"" is a little bit WW II team movie, a little bit Oceans. The team members are shown going about their day to day lives when George Clooney shows up and signs them up. The movie is based on a real project, and it plays like the best anecdotes from that project's team members. It's a series of vignettes that aren't particularly coherently connected. Some of the vignettes were not clear to me. Why was Matt Damon suddenly flying in a biplane over Paris at night? It was a pretty scene but I didn't understand how it fit into the rest of the plot. Why was the German-Jewish translator, Sam, suddenly carrying a wounded soldier into a mobile army surgical unit? Who was that soldier? Not sure.

Other vignettes are really gripping, moving, suspenseful, and/or funny. The movie won me over with its depiction of a British art expert's heroic attempt to rescue a Michelangelo Madonna from Belgium. I cried. I was inspired.

There is a funny, scary, sickening scene where a beefy German dentist hammers away at Bill Murray's teeth with a mallet and pliers while Bob Balaban makes provocative commentary about how he bets all the Germans were innocent  not.

There's a powerful scene where Americans are invited to a German home for dinner, and discover that the paintings on the dining room walls are too good to be reproductions.

The movie is flawed. Its editing is choppy. It feels rushed. I got the sense that not enough time was devoted to cast members building bonds with each other. John Goodman and Jean Dujardin are meant to be tight team members, but I saw no real chemistry between them. Not nearly enough time is devoted to fleshing out the all-star cast's characters, or to simple exposition. I'd simply like to know more about everything onscreen, from the Ghent altarpiece to Hitler's Nero decree. I would like to have seen the Nero decree's destruction of art placed into the context of the mass suicides at the end of the war. Hitler's suicide isn't even mentioned in ""Monuments Men.""

Sam, a GI, is recruited as a German translator. The average moviegoer might have no idea that Sam is Jewish. Sam says, ""I'm from NORTH Newark."" How many moviegoers know that North Newark was a Jewish neighborhood? Sam says that his grandfather in Germany was not allowed to enter a museum and joked about being barred because he was ""too short."" The real reason he was barred is that he was a Jew, but the movie never states that plainly.

I got the impression that Clooney was making his film for people with short attention spans who want the shallowest treatment possible of the subject matter. That's too bad, because with a little more tender loving care, this could have been a great movie rather than a good one.

Some popular culture and even academic retellings of WW II work to humanize, or even exculpate, Germans. ""Monuments Men"" does not. At first I thought that Sam would be the good German character  the noble ""true"" German who hated the Nazis from the get-go, resisted them, and was now helping the allies defeat them. But Sam turns out to be Jewish. ""Monuments Men"" uses the word ""German"" were a more German-friendly film would be careful to use the word ""Nazi,"" thus emphasizing that not all Germans were guilty, but merely an ideology.

""Monuments Men"" is unusual among recent American films in that it unapologetically and enthusiastically celebrates Western Civilization and the Christian heritage as something that utopians  in this case Nazis  tried to destroy, and that good people  among them Americans  heroically and courageously died to preserve. This is a really remarkable message. I wonder if left-wing Clooney embraced it because he saw ""Monuments Men"" as being about Art, not about Western Civ or the Judeo-Christian heritage. The two artworks focused on the most  the Ghent altarpiece and the Michelangelo Madonna are both overtly Christian.",1391817600,3,5137,4.86368843069874
5802914,4,B00DHJT4DU,"During WWII, there was a group of soldiers and civilians who scoured Europe in order to ""safeguard historic and cultural monuments from war damage, and as the conflict came to a close, to find and return works of art and other items of cultural importance that had been stolen"" (quote from Wikipedia). This was something that had never been done before in war; in the past it had almost always been ""to the victor belong the spoils."" However, the Allies (not including Russia) realized that the preservation of art and culture was part of what they were fighting to protect. To make a better future, they wanted to save, protect, and preserve the past. Some of the undertakings of a few of the Monuments Men were told in the 2009 book THE MONUMENTS MEN and that book is what formed the basis for the movie THE MONUMENTS MEN.

Directed and co-written by George Clooney, THE MONUMENTS MEN follows a group of artists as they travel through Europe in an attempt to save and protect works of art and return those pieces to their rightful owners. Clooney stars in the movie as Frank Stokes. Stokes petitions President Roosevelt to let him assemble a group of artists and scholars that will be sent to Europe to protect works of art, architecture, and items of historical importance from destruction and return stolen items to their rightful owners. He recruits his good friend James Granger (Matt Damon) to assist him with his efforts. Together the two men round up the rest of their troop: Richard Campbell (Bill Murray), Walter Garfield (John Goodman), Preston Savitz (Bob Balaban), Donald Jeffries (Hugh Bonneville), and Jean Claude Clermont (Jean Dujardin). After going through basic training in England and arriving in France a month after D-Day, the group enlists Sam Epstein (Dimitri Leonidas), a German Jew who fled to America with his family as a child, to be their translator. The team splits off to different parts of the continent and while in Paris Granger meets Claire Simon (Cate Blanchett) who eventually provides him with key information to finding and retrieving lost artifacts. It all becomes a hunt against time as it becomes clear that Germany will lose the war, but the stakes are raised as the Russians refuse to return any stolen goods, claiming them as restitution for the twenty-million people the war cost them.

The acting in the movie is well done. Clooney and Damon portray characters that seem similar to other characters they have played before. All the lead cast gets at least one big moment to shine in this piece. However, I was particularly impressed by Bob Balaban, Bill Murray, and Cate Blanchett. Balaban's Preston Savitz is the eldest member of the group and has a wonderful dry sense of humor. The pairing of Balaban and Bill Murray was genius. Murray also has a moving solo scene that illustrates once again that Murray isn't just a comic actor, but a fine dramatic one, too. Meanwhile, Blanchett fills her role with all kinds of mesmerizing actions and movements. She's a pure delight to watch.

I enjoyed THE MONUMENTS MEN. Having read the book prior to seeing the film, I was surprised at how many of the stories from the book actually made it into the movie. There are some scenes that are added for dramatic effect. There are also certain events and people that have been condensed to make the story more cinematic, but overall the movie stays close to the source material. The one big thing I was surprised about were the names of the people in the movie: almost all of the major characters in THE MONUMENTS MEN are based upon real people, but for some reason they are given different names in the movie.

The movie never steers away from the importance of the mission these men have undertaken. The audience is reminded of it several times by different characters throughout the film. However, the film also has a comic tone to it, which is somewhat surprising for a war movie. The comic tone doesn't take away from the seriousness of the subject matter, however. Nor does the film shy away from the real dangers of war. However, there are some who might find the dual comic-dramatic elements of the film to be confusing and, perhaps, even inappropriate. This shouldn't be the case: life is often tragic and comical at the same time. Tragedy and comedy might be opposites, but they are not mutually exclusive.

Overall, THE MONUMENTS MEN is an entertaining film that brings to light an important aspect of WWII history that is often overlooked. It's lighthearted, but doesn't glass over the risk and tragedy of war and it's a great reminder that the past should be saved in order to make the future worth living.",1391731200,82,4655,4.777639751552795
5802915,4,B00DHJT4DU,"""The Monuments Men"" (2014 release; 118 min.) brings the story, ""based on true events"" we are reminded at the beginning of the movie, of 8 men, tasked by President Roosevelt himself, to try and protect and/or recover the troves of art looted or threatened to be looted by the Germans during WWII. As the movie opens, we are in Ghent, Belgium, where Jan van Eyk's Altarpiece is being dismantled and whisked away. The scenery shifts back to the US where Lt. Frank Stokes (played by George Clooney) is putting together his team. There is the architect (played by Bill Murray), the sculptor (played by John Goodman), etc. etc. Once they get to Europe they split up and head out to various areas (Belgium, France, Germany). In a parallel story, we also get to know Claire (played by Cate Blanchett), a Parisian secretary working for the Nazis but secretly keeping track of everything. To tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Several comments: this movie is very much driven by (a labor of love for) George Clooney, as he co-wrote, co-produced and directed this (his first since 2011's excellent ""The Ides of March"", and his 5th overall). Second, notwithstanding what I just wrote, the move is an ensemble performance of mostly all-stars. Besides the ones I've already mentioned, there is also Matt Damon, Jean Dujardin (he of ""The Artist"" a few years back) and the always reliable Bob Balaban, just to name those. Third, even though this is NOT an 'action' war movie in any way, there are nevertheless a number of impressive looking production scenes, with a cast of hundreds, as Clooney is trying to recreate the chaos that existed in the latter phases of WWII. Fourth, if you don't like art or history, save yourself the trouble as more than likely you will not enjoy this movie. Besides the search for the Van Eyk Altarpiece, the other artifact that is a major plot point in the movie is Michelangelo's sculpture of Madonna and Child, from Bruges, Belgium. AS it happens, I grew up in Belgium (went to HS in Bruges, no less), and have seen both these artifacts, but had no idea about their perils during WWII until I saw this movie. Last but certainly not least, there is a fantastic orchestral soundtrack to the movie, composed by Alexandre Desplat. Bottom line: this movie is definitely not for everyone, but if you do enjoy a historical drama with a heavy dose of art, you cannot go wrong with this. At one point in the movie, Hitler signs a decree that if he is killed, all, as in ALL, of the looted art works are to be destroyed. Clooney's men get wind of that, prompting one of them to comment ""Now we have to hope nobody kills Hitler. I thought I'd never say that"", ha!

I went to see the movie here in Cincinnati at a late matinee today. Imagine my surprise when it turned out this particular screening was absolutely PACKED! I never expected that. I enjoyed ""The Monuments Men"" more than I had anticipated, truth be told. This is a solid historical drama that gave me some insights on WWII, and in particular the preservation/recovery of art in WWII, which I didn't have before. ""The Monuments Men"" is well worth checking out, be it in the theater or on DVD/Blu-ray.",1391731200,5,3258,4.634948096885813
5802916,5,B00DHJT4DU,"George Clooney directed this movie, and stars as George Stout, the man who puts a mission together to preserve, and protect the world's greatest art. The Group is named 'The Monument's Men' who are sent on an almost impossible mission as they risk their lives, in a race against time to avoid destruction of the art, and return it to their rightful owners. The art is trapped behind enemy lines, with the German Army under orders to destroy everything as the Reich fell. This movie is based on the true story of the greatest treasure hunt in history, as the artistic Masterpieces are planned to be rescued from Nazi thieves.

The movie portrays a dark spot in history that covers the screen with explosive action, as the tension increases during 'mission impossible.' Some of the team members gave a superb acting performance: Matt Damon; Bill Murray; John Goodman; and Cate Blanchett were fantastic.

The entire cast grabbed your attention with the roles they played, and sound effects were excellent. The compelling story was informative and historic, with an incredible setting that grabs your attention immediately. Overall, this movie is packed with drama, and action until the end. Interesting, entertaining, great acting, and worth an Oscar. I haven't seen a good historic movie in a long time, one I could rave about.

The story being spread too thin meant that the idea of a team working to save treasures was diluted. Something that annoyed me as well was the casting of Cate Blanchett as the bad tempered, chain smoking art curator of the Jeu de Paume gallery. Her French accent was not bad all, and I have heard some awful ones in movies, but please, for Petes sake, cant they cast a good French actress instead?

5803063,5,B00DHJT4DU,"Based on a lesser-known, true story about World War II, this film exquisitely portrays a quest for the rescue and preservation of much of Europe's art.  At Adolf Hitler's command, the Nazi army looted defeated European countries, stealing both their public and private art collections as spoils of war, then hid them in various towns, with the intent of ultimately sending them to Germany.  As the war was winding down, and Hitler could clearly see Germany's impending defeat, he gave the military order for all the works of art to be burned or destroyed by German troops as they retreated back to their home country.  While it is not the main focus, the film does not shy away from the appalling truths about Germany's hatred for and genocide of Jewish people (or everyone who was sent to their deaths at Concentration Camps).  And these truths are revealed in different ways as the stolen art is finally found.  This wonderfully detailed and beautifully acted story has a little bit of everything in it.  It is a story with distinctly memorable scenes of danger, courage, daring, humor, tenderness, commitment, comradery and sacrifice for a larger ideal -- a preservation of the world's cultural heritage which serves as an antithesis to the human savagery of war and unbridled greed.  This film has many surprises along the way and will make you laugh and tug at your heartstrings as you cheer on the Monuments Men's crusade.",1520294400,,1428,4.87603305785124

5803116,5,B00DHJT4DU,"I don't know how historically accurate the movie ""The Monuments Men"" is.
I do know, however, that it is an excellent film.
The movie focuses attention on a little-known effort at the end of World War II to recover art stolen by the Nazis during their reign of terror in Europe. The subject of a book written several years ago, ""The Monuments Men"" is an interesting movie for many reasons including the fact that it broadens our understanding of the war itself. The Nazis are notorious for many reasons but many people are unaware of the fact that in addition to murdering millions of men, women, and children they were gangsters who stole anything and everything they could get their hands on. The depth of their immorality and their cruelty is almost bottomless and their desire to possess the treasures of other people is almost without parallel. It's been said that the only real difference between them and criminal organizations such as the Mafia is the fact the Nazis wore uniforms and that might be closer to the truth than we realize.
That said, I think this movie does an excellent job of highlighting the efforts on behalf of the Allies to recover this stolen art, preserve classic buildings from destruction, and - in the process - help to save civilization. That may be too grand a claim but I would argue that had these artistic and architectural treasures not been recovered and saved this world would be a much poorer place.
George Clooney, Matt Damon, John Goodman and the rest of the cast were wonderful in the film as a small group of academics charged with the task of finding and recovering the stolen art. The script allowed them to show a wide range of emotions and the director was sure handed. The costuming, cinematography, and musical scores made the movie come alive for me and helped to enhance the performances by a truly gifted cast.
My conclusion: An excellent piece of film making and a movie I highly recommend.",1511568000,2,1944,4.703812316715543

5803189,5,B00DHJT4DU,"So, I'm guessing the Nazi demonstrators in Charlottesville didn't get to see this movie. Because to watch Priests and peaceful people being shot and killed in a church, for the sake of stealing art, really should change their minds about what the word Nazi stands for. Or seeing barrels full of gold teeth that were plied out of people's mouths most likely before they were executed because they weren't the right color, shade or hue; should really change their minds about clinging to Satan's flag of evil.
This movie is so powerful and it shows the scope of Hitler's rage against Humanity. It shows the pure bravery of a small group of men who didn't want to die, who were afraid and who didn't know the way; but they knew in their hearts, that they had to charge forward to do what IS right.
This is really a beautiful tribute to the silent brave brothers and sisters of Humanity who risked their and their families lives to hold the line. Kate Blanchett, pure brilliance. Matt Damon, such classic grace. Bill Murray, so real, so loveable. George Clooney and the rest of the Good News Gang bring the message of preserving the great Art works of History, and refusing passage to Hitler to the big screen. Where it belongs, to be seen by everyone. So that we ALL may learn from this evil dark period in time when MILLIONS!!!!!! of innocent men, women, children and babies were slaughtered; so that we NEVER allow it ever to happen again.

My only explanation is that those people watched it expecting to see people getting their heads blown off and every second word is a curse word - in other words, the people who rate this poorly must honestly be too jaded to enjoy a story about likable characters that have a task perceived by the modern cynic as ""simple."" The very nature of this story means you won't get gore and blood, but it doesn't miss the mark as a war movie, either.

There are some scenes that were shot for purely emotional value, but that's okay.

I for one appreciate both the story itself of the Monuments Men and that Clooney as the director can tell it without including any heavy profanity, with zero sex, and without needless violence.

I can understand why it wasn't a blockbuster or a runaway hit; but when it comes to understanding why so many people hate on it, the only explanation I can muster is a person calloused by modern cynicism, one who believes sex and gore are the trademarks of realism and quality - they're not.

If you are a WWII history buff, you will likely be insulted on top of being bored to death and put to sleep.  A straightforward documentary, with real names and factual events, would be so much better than this.  Other sources state that the historical accuracy is almost non-existent.  The scriptwriting is weak and terrible.  Much of the dialog and even the vocabulary is just not credible for 1944-45.  None of the military troop scenes are credible.  I never could find any plot or plot development.  (The real group had plans and organization, intel and orders.)  It has the modern Hollywood disease of predictable gratuitous Holocaust references thrown in at regular intervals, like non sequiturs.  I expected and hoped to learn a few things about the art -- a little bonus art history lesson along the way -- but there is none of that, either.  What a pity that so much money and time was spent on something like this.",1482192000,,1037,4.731843575418995

It is so often said that is a work of art worth a life.  This shows the why of it.  It also shows the greed that has nothing to do with art, just POSSESSION.  How one values the sublime over the mundane.  I rarely give five stars, but this actually being based on a true story shows how sad it is when men are willing to destroy the works of great artists for all the wrong reasons.  Nature destroys the works of mankind...but this is pure destruction of all that is good in mankind by someone who was all bad in mankind.  I loved this movie.",1480636800,,718,3.972027972027972

5803635,5,B00DHJT4DU,"I just watched this movie again, this time with my father who is in his 80s.  He enjoys a good movie and prefers stories that are based on actual events.  Let's just say that both he and I thoroughly enjoyed the experience.

It's 1944 and Allied forces have established a beachhead in Normandy while in Italy Allied forces are fighting their way north.  Meanwhile, in the USA a man concerned about the cost of the war in terms of its impact on our culture (art, architecture, etc.) has gained an audience with the FDR and wins his support in doing what can be done to preserve these things.  Also in the meantime the Nazi regime is hauling off vast numbers of pieces of art and taking them back to Germany, their fate is tied to the fate of the Third Reich.  If the Reich falls, the art will be destroyed.

The leader of the Army unit tasked with finding and returning this art recruits a small number of mostly older men, all artists, architects, museum curators to join the Monuments Men.  They arrive in France a month after D-Day and try to get to work, seemingly stymied at every turn by circumstances and Army chain of command.  Yet they press on.

Their accomplishments are a matter of public record, fantastic!

Some people complain that this movie moves too slowly, that there is too little action, etc.  You have to understand that while this movie is set in the midst of the fighting toward the end of WWII, the real story is the drama and intrigue and daring do needed to try to so what they set out to do.

The cast is fabulous.  They gel well and the acting is impressive.

This movie resides firmly in the 5-star category of my collection.  I will watch it many times in the years to come.",1476316800,,1704,4.396166134185304

That all being said, the movie is a bit slow and there really isn't much ""excitement"" or ""action"" or ""suspense"" to be had.  I suppose that is due to the nature of the story.

However, the pacing was kind of slow, the writing didn't really have any zing and it fluctuated from serious drama to goofy comedy. I think Bill Murray was not right for the part. He's quite funny, but doesn't do ""serious"" very well. The ending, although satisfactory, did not get me really pumped up. One real standout: Cate Blanchett showed how she can really disappear into a role. George Clooney was George Clooney and Bill Murray was Bill Murray, but Cate Blanchett was not Cate Blanchett but rather a member of the French resistance. Great performance.",1468540800,,729,4.703125

When they were losing the war, they began hiding the stolen artwork and that's when these Monument Men came in to help retrieve this lost art before the Nazis were able to destroy it (most of it anyway, some was still not found in time and was destroyed, other pieces of art are still being found throughout Germany to this day).

And it was only 3 bucks. But I've seen better films from both actors, in my opinion O brother were art and Michael Clayton and the best for Clooney is the Descendants and Damon, Good will hunting and many more that I don't have time to list them all but I've never not liked one of his films. Other great actors of our time are well good will hunting he and Ben wrote that together and maybe the last outstanding performance by Robin Williams who I think was a better actor in straight roles, He will be missed!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

5804222,2,B00DHJT4DU,"If ever a movie suffered an identity crisis ""The monument Men""gets a full dose.
Is it a comedy? A serious examination ...or ""Ocean's Eleven"" set in WWII?

I ALMOST turned it off in the first 15 minutes when, to the tune of some generic clich American ""recruiting"" music, all the old familiar faces come on screen as the ""troops are marshaled"".
This is definitely a movie that SHOULD have been filmed with unknowns, free of the cinematic baggage that George Clooney, Bill Murray and John Goodman all carry.
Matt Damon isn't too bad, and Hugh Bonneville of Downton Abbey fame doesn't last all that long.
Clooney is the worst offender here, wearing his perennial grin and tricked out in stylish aviator glasses. He just acts as Clooney throughout the whole movie with no attempt whatsoever to vary his persona from any other Clooney performance. He just phones it in as the saying goes.
Murray looks as though he's just stepped off ""Ghostbusters"" and does nothing at all here to dispel that impression.
Surprisingly Goodman manages to throw off his usual comedic image and does manage some real acting in the course of the film.
Blanchett acts the pants of her fellow cast, but even her character is written unsurely. She changes from scene to scene.

This story had such great potential, and really deserved a FAR better script. Here it dissolves into about five different stories, none of which can decide on just what genre they belong to.

It's all ""Boys Own Adventure"" behind enemy lines, complete with a commandeered army vehicle allowing Clooney to look ""cool"" and make long highly-unconvincing speeches about the state of Humanity and its achievements.

The art itself is shifted by our ""rescuers"" with all the care of taking garage clean-out junk to the dump.
Michelangelo's Madonna must have arrived back as little more than a pile of marble chips after being unceremoniously dumped in mine cars and then a trailer towed over bumpy war damaged roads at high speed to escape the advancing Russians. These blokes are SUPPOSED to be respecters of art? It was probably safer in the hands of the Nazis!

I do feel a great deal of liberty has been taken with reality here...the film is preceded with one of those ""based on a true story"" prologues, which probably means nothing more than some men once recovered a piece of art stolen by the Nazis.

The soundtrack is truly abysmal. Poorly chosen tracks seem to underscore any action with the ""gung-ho"" type music you might expect in a John Wayne  film. It's hugely distracting and also adds to the confusion.
In all a complete jumble of a movie that fails on nearly all levels, if it could even decide just which level it's aiming for.
The ""star"" quality is far too much in evidence and overpowers a very thin plot line provided by the screenplay.
Saving the art treasures should be a far more serious matter than ""the magnificent seven"" tear about Europe in an army jeep.

This movie is not good.  This movie is missing most of what makes a decent movie.  The cinematography is good..ish.  Aside from that, I really couldn't tell you why you'd watch this... And Cate Blanchett does a good job.

If you are expecting something with a plot and with compelling characters overcoming some obstacle or vanquishin some foe, then you are expecting too much.  The movie almost goes out of its way to make you not care about the characters or what they do.  I feel like I should explain that.  The characters are forgettable and there is no real challenge or adversity.  I spent the whole movie expecting something to happen, but the story just meanders on.  So, having no character development,  it is a not amusing when every fifteen minutes or so, there is a scene that is trying to be the equivalent of a 'slow clap.'  Because there's nothing to clap for.

It gets worse when you realize they are using the backdrop of the Holocaust to try to add some emotional depth.  It is done so poorly done that it occurred to me that it was put into the story only because George Clooney lives in Holywood and felt like he should.

I don't know George Clooney,  but after watching this, and knowing that he wrote and directed this,  I can't help but feel that he has an intellegence well below average.  This movie was just so lacking in any intellectual stimulation that I don't know how else to convey it.

You'd be far better informed and entertained from any thing you'd find on the History channel.

If you're a World War Two history buff or someone who just likes period movies this is for you. The plot is a group of not so military worthy men are commissioned to help located and recoup art & relics that were stolen and hidden by the Nazi party. It has a little bit of a war movie feel without any gore or intense fighting but plenty to keep you on your toes. And of course, George Clooney!",1455580800,,511,3.970873786407767

5804667,5,B00DHJT4DU,"This is a remarkable film about something that should be more than a footnote in WWII chronicles.  The theft of incredibly valuable works of art from those who fled Europe or were rounded up and sent away to concentration camps was a widespread crime throughout occupied Europe during the Nazi reign of terror.  We can only guess how much was actually destroyed, but we know that a variety of these artworks have shown up in post-war Europe and America, and getting them returned to their rightful owners has proven to be a difficult and litigious pursuit.

The Allied mission of preserving, reclaiming and returning these important markers of our human evolution, heritage, and culture fell on a very courageous group of Allied men and women, mostly art professors, ""geeks"" if you will, who faced the same war-time dangers faced by every-day G.I.s on the battlefield, and this is a fine acknowledgement of their efforts and sacrifices.

This is an action-packed true story.  Prepare to shed a tear, but also to jump up and shout a time or two!",1453593600,2,1044,4.842696629213483
5804668,4,B00DHJT4DU,"The premise may or may not be loosely based on some actual events, but I enjoyed the movie for the detective work done to uncover the stolen art. The movie also shows that anyone in any capacity exposed to front line combat can become a casualty of war. I think the cast is excellent with several stars moving out of what may be perceived as their normal acting roles, and I though the script was low key but very effective. Like the cast or not, it was an entertaining take on the cost and waste of war.",1453507200,,504,4.206185567010309

While the movie moves a little slow at times, it's really not meant to be an action movie, or a comedy, or really any one particular genre, with some really amazing moments from every cast member. And, though the dialogue and presentation is very Clooney-esque  at times (rapid fire humor where each succeeding line one-ups the previous one) the movie constantly reminds us of the underlying dark undertones of the war and atrocities committed by the NAZIs and Hitler the likes of which hadn't been seen before or since.",1452211200,,691,4.8559322033898304

The more I watch this movie, the more I've come to like it. When I first heard it was a fictional account with no real-life characters, I thought it was gonna be a hokie joke. And the first time I saw it, I didn't have too much higher opinion of the flick. But the more I've read about the efforts of the 300+ staff of the MFAA divisions, I started asking myself, how else does a 2-hour movie stand a chance at telling the story than using composite characters of the MOST significant of the very significant accomplishments of the MFAA divisions?

5804705,2,B00DHJT4DU,"It's not advertised as such but there is a great mystery in this movie! The story the movie is based on is truly fascinating. How can the armies closing in on the Third Reich preserve the cultural heritage that the Nazi's had plundered from conquered lands without compromising the conduct of the war? The cast of the movie is first rate. We have a host of superb talent that have either stared or supported very successful films across a wide spectrum. And yet, in the end we are left sitting there not really following the storyline and not really caring about the characters being portrayed. So the big question is just what went so terribly wrong with this movie? I think this film should be required material for any study of films of our era, not for what it got right but for just how much of it is wrong.
I did not find the portrayal believable as history nor did I find it compelling as drama. I found I did not care about the characters as they did not seem to be authentic. Their personal stories were not developed enough to elicit any empathy. The roles portrayed did not seem to be real. I could not even dislike the Nazi art collector (supposedly Hermann Goering?) and the film did not explain why he would have wanted to collect the pieces.
The story itself is garbled up so we are left without any real appreciation of why the paintings from Belgium are so important. We are never told what it is about them that makes this effort important.

It was a good film and though not totally historically correct (There were about 300 + Monuments Men) provided an insight into the trials and tribulation of these men faced.

I'm not going to go into the plot, but as a lover of Hogan Heroes I had always heard the Hitler & Goering were art lovers and stolen a lot of art, and this was confirmed by this movie.

It was a great touch to see the special features which included interviews from living members of the Monuments squads and history about recovering the artworks.  I recommend!",1444953600,,707,4.457364341085271

The film can't decide whether it wants to take a serious look at a remarkable story and at the crimes of the Nazi art looters, or be a romance, or be a second-rate Indiana Jones film with clever quips and last-moment escapes, and it ultimately fails at all three because somewhere along the line, no one really decided what it was about.  A waste of talent, time, and money.  Mr. Clooney can do much better than this rather silly flop.",1441324800,,502,4.4945054945054945
5805018,4,B00DHJT4DU,"This is a good film, apparently based on a true story, about US arts experts racing through Western Europe near the end of World War II trying to recover priceless art looted by the Germans. And it's a little more harrowing than I pictured it. They're not just moving behind the lines to inventory and secure what the frontline troops have come across. They're out at the leading edge, trying to stop last-minute Nazi transports of stolen art and even the Hitler-ordered destruction of same in the last days of the war. destruction the fanatical SS, personally loyal to him, is willing to carry out.

World War II has been written and filmed so many times that it takes an offbeat story like this to get our attention (although I wonder, younger generations who know so little about it probably would enjoy originals or remakes of anything from ""The Sands of Iwo Jima"" to ""Twelve O'Clock High"" to ""The Longest Day"".

The story gets into ""Saving Private Ryan"" territory intellectually with the ""is it worth it to risk men's lives for this particular goal?"" question woven throughout the story. The film makes a reasonable argument that it is, or was. I knew about looted art, but I didn't realize the scope of it: tens of thousands of pieces by Picasso and Michelangelo and Rembrandt, much of it designated for a never-built Fuhrer Museum in Hitler's hometown of Linz, Austria. The story gives a lot of emphasis on the hunt for two particular stolen artworks, the Ghent Altarpiece by Hubert and Jan Van Eyck from the cathedral there, and a Madonna and Child sculpture by Michelangelo.

As inevitable with any George Clooney movie, the story can't be told without at least a little riding of liberal hobbyhorses. Early in the film the Allies are implicitly equated with the Nazis because Allied bombing has destroyed lots of beautiful and historic architecture. The movie itself can be used to dismantle this argument: the Allies did what was necessary to win the war, and, yeah, Monte Cassino got demolished in fighting for the better part of the year. But the Allies never sought to destroy historic art or culture, as the Nazis did repeatedly. A scene of SS troops using a flamethrower on big batches of priceless paintings is particularly compelling. And the Allies returned a lot of it. The art museums of America are not built on looted-liberated-and-looted-again art.

And Clooney's character (Clooney co-wrote the screenplay, so he can be held responsible) defends the Russians, who engage in identical looting, shipping off the artworks recovered from the Nazis to Russia. ""Look, they lost 20 million people . . . "", Clooney's character says. It's still the same thing; the Communists were like the Nazis in lots of ways, not just this one. The Clooneys of the world, and particularly Hollywood, might occasionally want to reflect on the additional 20 million or more Soviet citizens killed by Stalin's regime. They never make movies about that. Who? Huh? What?

I liked the portrayal of occupied and then newly-liberated France and Belgium - all those people in wartime clothes riding bicycles. Matt Damon plays  Clooney's sidekick who must win the trust of a French art curator (Cate Blanchett) now charged with collaboration because she worked under the Nazis who did the looting. She's suspicious that the Americans will do the same thing if they find the art - and Damon's character is a curator of the Metropolitan Art Museum in New York.

Bill Murray and John Goodman give fine supporting performances as other members of the arts crew. Murray's style of humor and ad libs, though, are a little too Saturday Night Live for World War II.",1441238400,,3650,4.867954911433173

5805096,3,B00DHJT4DU,"have mixed feelings with the Monuments Men.  While it contains an amazing cast of big name actors in George Clooney, Bill Murray, Bob Balaban, John Goodman, Cate Blanchett, Matt Damon, Hugh Bonneville (who I often confuse with Bill Murray) and Jean Dujardin (who I often confuse with George Clooney, heh) this movies tries to blend action/adventure with the seriousness of World War II, but for some reason it feels more like a far-fetched gimmicky Hollywood film instead of a believable attempt at gathering/retrieving hidden arts scattered around Europe in the early 40's.

Basically all these big name actors are a bunch of historians and architects, and they go out on a journey/mission together to bring back the lost arts.  However even though this is supposedly based on a true story, the tone feels way nicer and more Indiana Jones-like than it should.  Okay maybe not *quite* Indiana Jones, but walking down the same territory surely.  For a big chunk of the movie we see these guys (in particular Clooney) bring out maps of Europe and strategize ways to retrieve the hidden arts without being detected by the Nazis which turns out to involve taking trips to France and befriending soldiers and later Russia.  However the whole concept feels odd to me.  Hitler's depiction is off the mark and too tame.  The movie didn't want to touch on the seriousness of the Jewish side of the war either which it should have.  Not that I was expecting an all-out war movie, but at least something more believable and depicting the grim negative effects of the war than what we got.

The highlights seem to be whenever Bill Murray and Bob Balaban are involved, such as when they accidentally come across a German soldier in the forest which leads to a memorable scene handing the soldier a cigarette as a way of courtesy, and they all go their separate ways.  Another memorable scene with John Goodman involves a young boy shooting at him and his companion from a deserted building window.  The movie certainly has its moments, but it's the tone I have a problem with.  The tone should've been more strict/serious and less playful with the subtle touches of comedy that *clearly* didn't belong.  Plus it just nags me to no end that with all the things to discuss about World War II, having a group of men set out on a mission to save art just feels hokey to me.

5805156,3,B00DHJT4DU,"I enjoyed the book ""the Monuments Men"" tremendously, and was eager to see how George Clooney ""translated"" it to the screen. I wasn't terribly disappointed, because the book is richly detailed, and the first third (about) is the obstacles George Stout had to overcome to even get the top brass's attention about saving art, and trying to set up some sort of team/communication/process for obtaining supplies, etc. And I realize that focusing on the finding and saving of the two most important pieces of art made for a good focal point for a film-usable plot. However, the one thing that I don't understand--and which really ruined the film for me--was Clooney's treatment of the Rose Valland-James Rorimer relationship--of which there was NONE at in the book. Rose Valland was a true hero who put her life on the line every day for the four + years that the Nazis occupied Paris, keeping indispensable records. It took Rorimer quite some time to convince her that he was, indeed, there to find and return the art to its original owners. She was never imprisoned as a collaborator, NOR did she ever make any romantic overtures to Rorimer, NOR did Rorimer ever have to prove his worth as husband by refusing the advances of a lonely Parisienne. To portray her as expecting sex for her volume of precious information does a monumental disservice to a hero. If Clooney had used the half hour of contrived non-factual amour about Valland-Rorimer for more exposure about the team and its beginnings at the opening of the film, the film would have been much stronger.",1436832000,,1560,4.824626865671642

But sadly the execution was not great nor even realistic.  First off, they used Army radio sets of the time to move the plot forward as a theatrical device.  This was so the characters could communicate with each other from all over Europe like they had cell phones.  Come on!  I am a  retired Army guy myself and radios from WWII even into the 80's were lucky to reach a few miles max.  Not from Belgium into Germany.  There was very little depth to the screen play and it just jumped from scene to scene, as one or two of the cast just roamed around Europe to their hearts content.  I would suspect in reality it was a much slower paced operation.  But if you can rent it cheaper than I did at $12 its worth a watch for a couple great scenes and some memorable lines.  UPDATE:  I watched it again and this time the very good character performances started to push some of the other negative aspects into the background so I gave it another star.

There is no plan, like in Ocean's 11 or other caper/thriller/war-time action films. It just proceeds as you know it will proceed. The comic nature of the film does a disservice to the film and to the subject matter.

Excellent casting and well done.",1432425600,,331,4.5
5805372,4,B00DHJT4DU,"The Monuments Men and George Clooney as a Director
 We have to consider The Monuments Men as the serious new release for this week (all due apologies to the makers of Vampire Academy and The Lego Movie both worthy films in their own way, Im sure).  The subject of this film rather than the acting, directing or writing makes this one a must see.  We all have some notion of the history of Nazi horror during WWII.  Many of us have an idea of the grand theft of the artistic treasures of the Western World that the Nazi bigwigs and Hitler himself inflicted upon suffering Europe.  They stole with a lavish hand without compunction, without remorse and without the least consideration for ordinary human decency.  That cannot be much of a surprise to most viewers.  The scale of the crime however is intimidating.  The Monuments Men is the tale of the attempt to recover the stolen swag, a task happening simultaneously with the great battles at the conclusion of WWII.  The scholars did not achieve their goals without the ultimate price being paid by two of their very small number.  In Lone Survivor heroes die to save their team mates, in The Monuments Men heroes die to save the works of Vermeer and Picasso for the rest of us.
 In 2009 Monuments Men, the book, by Robert M. Edsel came to the attention of the world.  George Clooney wrote the screenplay, along with Grant Heslov who also co-scribed Good Night and Good Luck, about which more in a nuance.
 The three saw blade historically important film hosts an array of stars in the tradition of WWII films such as The Dirty Dozen.  Part of the joy of watching is simply to see such familiar faces on the big screen doing their best to entertain and inform us.  The down side with this technique can be, and is here, that we focus on the star rather than the character.  It takes an exceptionally powerful tale or an exceptionally powerful actor or both to pull this off, in an artistic sense.  But in a movie of such monumental importance subject wise, it is not a debilitating flaw.
 George Clooney, Matt Damon, Bill Murray, John Goodman, Hugh Bonneville (instantly recognizable from his role in Downton Abbey) and French actor Jean Dujardin (Oscar winner for a leading actor in The Artist, 2011) play the assortment of artists and intellectuals that go to the rescue of the stolen art.  All of these actors do well.  Cate Blanchett however is brilliant, submerging herself in the role of a patriotic Frenchwoman who helps the Monuments Men in their task.  She even puts on a French accent which seemed right to my ear.
 Monuments Men runs one hour and 50 minutes and has as a budget the stupendous amount of $70 million.  This may turn out to be an excessive and unrecoverable amount for the producers, but I hope not.  It carries a mild PG-13 rating.  In the opening weekend it brought in $23 million.  This represents only the North American market so far.  A film of such historical
magnitude may find a large audience in other national markets overseas.  Frank Stokes, the real life art savior and his men eventually recovered the staggering total of over five million paintings and other works of art.  Thanks guys.",1432425600,,3178,4.635062611806798

 I had felt that this was the regular ""Joe Shmoe"" average man becoming Soldiers and going on a noble but grand crusade.

5805438,1,B00DHJT4DU,"My review is limited to the movie only, so I cannot comment on the quality of the blu-ray video, sound, or extras included in this package.

I'm giving it two stars, as the mouseover says a one star is ""I hate it."" Well, I didn't hate it. Nothing went against any moral standard I have, except for the wasted story, wasted use of talent, and poor video shots. Actually, now that I think about it, I do hate it.

The story is slow, undeveloped, but at the same time overdeveloped. It explained itself to explain itself which resulted in me thinking about my new miter saw in the garage. It's a compound slider, quite cool. The movie also splits to follow different groups of the actors, which is fine. Unless it is this movie then it doesn't. You want to like the characters, but some don't have a speaking part, or play any significant role in the movie. Which brings us to the wasted talent. Hey, most of these actors I don't agree with politically, but they can act quite good. Yet none of that is displayed on screen. I walked away frustrated, really wanting to see a side story about WWII, which was unique. Maybe the source material is worth it, but as far as this movie goes, skip it. Use your new miter saw instead.",1431475200,,1222,4.378854625550661

5805475,2,B00DHJT4DU,"The difference between great movies and this movie is like the difference between Broadway and your local high school production.  The latter has its own charm and appeal, but it doesn't belong in the same category as the former.  This movie is surprisingly amateurish for a film actually produced in Hollywood.

Some, but not all, of the recognizable actors do a great job with what they are given, but the dialog and the direction are just... embarrassing...

The history behind the film is awesome but he film itself is awful.

SPOILERS BELOW: everything below will reference scenes in the movie to illustrate the point... don't read if you don't want spoilers.

The scene where John Goodman stands up in the live-fire drill and then is told that the bullets are real made me think I was watching 'Rosanne' or the even more kitchy, 'The Babe'.

The scene where the movie's characters bring an un-related-to-the-story soldier on a stretcher into an un-related-to-the-story hospital due to an un-related-to-the-story injury is so un-related-to-the-story that it simply cannot belong.

The scene where a truck stops in the middle of a field in the middle of nowhere and then winds up in the middle of a firefight is... just... inexcusable.

The scene with the 'sniper' firing from a window goes nowhere.

The scene with the cigarettes makes no sense.

The scene where dozens of workers are painstakingly cataloging art in a mine and then two main characters look in a room labeled 'storage' where nobody ever thought to look before is silly.

But most of all, at the beginning of the film, much time is allocated to setting up Viktor Stahl as THE villain who steels off in the middle of the night with a train-load of art... only to have an extremely minor and uneventful demise later in the film.",1430697600,,1797,4.836601307189542

5805569,4,B00DHJT4DU,"On the recommendation of my brother-in-law, George, I watched The Monuments Men. Actually, I just finished it while I was cooking and cleaning up our kitchen since I'm not feeling my best I was playing it slow this AM. (Both my son and I had fevers last night with killer sore throats.. But, I digress.)

Do NOT expect this to be a fast-paced movie. Rather, it documents the search for the World's great art during WWII when Hitler was rampaging across Europe grabbing it up for his grand Fuhrer Museum. Do expect an interesting storyline as the characters trek across Europe and encounter hardships when they hit the front lines and experience successes, as well as suffer losses. The main characters are not soldiers but historians, art curators, and artists who have been pulled together to form a team of art detectives. The end of the movie is particularly poignant when the lead character, played by George Clooney, is asked ""Do you think it was worth it, for a piece of art? Do you think, 30 years from now, that anyone is going to remember that (men died) for a piece of art?"" It's a question for us all as we consider cultural artifacts, particularly artwork, in the face of something like war. It would be interesting to have a high school History class watch this film and think through issues such as that, especially in our current age of consumerism and pop culture where so much is seen as disposable. But, there, that's the teacher in me. :-)

It's difficult to know what is fact and what is Hollywood fiction. Nevertheless, it is a good movie if you take into account that this actually happened. A more full interpretation of Hitler and the role art thievery played in WWII can be found in the documentary, The Rape of Europa, which I think I'm gonna have to take time and watch again. You should be able to find it streaming online.

So, the next time it rains you have a couple of shows to explore!",1428710400,,1918,4.553623188405797

5805630,2,B00DHJT4DU,"I was looking forward to this film as it boasted a fine array of top actors. Unfortunately, this is an extremely plodding and at times soporific narrative about a pack of old boys rambling around the countryside in search of Nazi loot. There are a few moments of short-lived drama and moderate potential threat, but frankly, nothing these old duffers wouldn't have had to face on a Sunday afternoon down the local boozer or a late night Safeway run.",1427587200,,449,4.69620253164557
5805631,3,B00DHJT4DU,"Sincere account of the Allied effort during World War II to recover artworks stolen by the Nazis that ultimately fails to resonate.  Director George Clooney has the minute details of this footnote in history down pat but the film falls flat because the script that he collaborated on with Grant Heslov doesn't fully flesh out the characters.  This omission reverberates  when you consider the array of talent (Matt Damon, Bill Murray, John Goodman, et al.) Clooney had  at his disposal.  It doesn't quite negate but hinders in a way the message of the importance of preserving humanity's artistic achievements that Clooney is trying to convey. I was genuinely moved by the film's closing scene of a grandfather admiring the recovered artwork with his grandson in tow some thirty years after the events portrayed in the film. The film needed more moments like that.  I can also appreciate the earnest effort that was put into this project but would recommend it at best as a dry history lesson.",1427587200,,993,4.916167664670659

Not sure whether it was supposed to come off as somewhat of a ""comedy', but it certainly had that feel to it. Not suspenseful, not intense, but in a nutshell, if Walt Disney and Hogans Heroes made a war movie, this is it! Even some of the music had somewhat of a more 'happy go lucky' tone to it, making for more of a light hearted, upbeat feeling picture. For me, thats not really something that I'm looking for in a war story, but I suppose, how intense can a movie about recovering art treasures really get? Other than a few attempts throughout the picture to create some seriousness, as in talking of the sacrifices of the two men lost on the mission, and the treasures and personal belongings taken from the Jewish peoples, I wasn't really sure how this movie was supposed to be taken by the viewer.

5805829,3,B00DHJT4DU,"After ""Saving Private Ryan,"" one should expect historical accuracy in a WW II event of such a grand scale. Sadly, it did not happen here in this weaker version of the Nazi art thefts, called ""The Monuments Men."" (whereas ""Rape of Europa"" is exciting and compelling).In the film's opening scenes you hear a 2013 verb ""tasked,"" which would have never been uttered by the greatest generation, tipping you off to a hurried and convenient good-feeling interpretation of this well-documented story that, for economic and other reasons, avoids telling the Italian war front episodes (the most compelling destruction and reason for Monuments Men).The choice of gathering The Monuments Men haphazardly like ""The Dirty Dozen,"" was another handful of blundering choices unsuitable for the severity and desperation at that time. It is as if Hollywood will not accept a war story without numbers of clowns like Billy Murray or John Goodman balancing the seriousness of the challenges of the detail. The Monuments Men were never really slackers in ill-fitting uniforms or re-enactors thrown together hurriedly, shown here to be about a dozen. They were sometimes up to 200 cultural protectors in numerous regiments and sectors. Because the heroine of this version was Rose Valland, well-depicted but relegated to a supporting role here (Kate Blanchett), the focus of the story begins in France and follows all investigatory leads into Germany, telling a smaller-scale of the actual hunt for stolen works of art and pays little attention to the scale of looting in Italy or the eastern front. The real story found in the book ""Rape of Europa""( or dvd) reveals more heroes than Rose Valland. While ""The Monuments Men"" is mildly moving overall, it was a letdown to those who know about the actual events.",1425168000,2,1787,5.123287671232877

5805836,5,B00DHJT4DU,"""The Monuments Men"" is great! This is how the story goes: Based on the true story of the greatest treasure hunt in history, The Monuments Men is an action drama focusing on an unlikely World War II platoon, tasked by FDR with going into Germany to rescue artistic masterpieces from Nazi thieves and returning them to their rightful owners. It would be an impossible mission: with the art trapped behind enemy lines, and with the German army under orders to destroy everything as the Reich fell, how could these guys - seven museum directors, curators, and art historians, all more familiar with Michelangelo than the M-1 - possibly hope to succeed? But as the Monuments Men, as they were called, found themselves in a race against time to avoid the destruction of 1000 years of culture, they would risk their lives to protect and defend mankind's greatest achievements.

The cast led by George Clooney (who also directed, produced and wrote the screenplay) (as Frank Stokes), Matt Damon (as James Granger), Bill Murray (as Richard Campbell), John Goodman (as Walter Garfield), Jean Dujardin (as Jean Claude Clermont), Bob Balaban (as Preston Savitz), Hugh Bonneville (as Donald Jeffries) & Cate Blanchett (as Claire Simone) is great. The directing by Clooney is great. The screenplay (based on the book by Robert M. Edsel & Bret Witter) by Clooney & Grant Heslov (who also produced with Clooney & also makes an appearance as a doctor in the film) is great.

The music by Alexandre Desplat (who also makes an appearance in the film as Emile) is great. The cinematography by Phedon Papamichael is great. The film editing by Stephen Mirrione is great. The casting by Jina Jay is great. The production design by Jim Bissell is great. The art direction by Helen Jarvis, Cornelia Ott & David Scheunemann is great. The set decoration by Bernhard Henrich, set dressings by Silke Bauer, Jan Dunkel, Wolfgang Hein, John Palmer, Jochen Schuetz & Yesim Zolan, set designs by Dominik Capodieci, Michael Lieb & Stephanie Rass is great. The costume design by Louise Frogley is great. The special effects coordinated by Sam Conway & Klaus Mielich & supervised by Gerd Nefzer is great. The visual effects coordinated by Steven Barham, Lara Berners, Zaira Brilhante, Steffen Hagen, Uday Joshi, Vivek Joshi, Surendra Nath, Jithendran Thottupurath, Mark Webb & James Worlidge, supervised by Asregadoo Arundi, Angela Barson, Angus Bickerton, Simon Carr, Tom Debenham, Jonathan Neill, Dominic Parker & Martin Waters are great. The stunts coordinated by Franklin Hansen & Volkhart Buff are great.

This is a great and entertaining movie that is interesting and intriguing. It is also well-done and well made, as well, too. George Clooney has directed another great film to his directorial resume, he also gives his usually solid performance, as well, too. He also leads a terrific well-casted cast of stars that include his old friends & castmates, Matt Damon, John Goodman & Cate Blanchett. This is also a World War II movie that focuses more on the historic significances of mankind instead of the carnages of war.",1424995200,,3093,5.037109375

5805916,5,B00DHJT4DU,"The Nazis stole many art pieces during the Second World War and hid them at isolated places. The intention was to make a Museum for Hitler. This film is about art scholars, historians and architects who are past their prime in life. They build a unit and volunteer to retrieve as many of the European masterpieces as they can lay their hands on. The mission takes on an urgency when they learn about the `Nero Decree' taken out by Adolf Hitler and this decree ordered the destruction of all these artworks if the Third Reich fell. These people are caught in a race against time and they risk their lives to get back some of the greatest achievements of mankind back to their rightful places.
There is an excellent background score given by Alexandre Desplat. He has turned out another brilliant score recently for `The Imitation Game'. Excellent fifth directorial venture by George Clooney. He started with Confessions of a Dangerous Mind in 2002. His last film was The Ides of March. Clooney puts in a good performance and he is very well supported by Matt Damon, Bill Murray and Cate Blanchett. Some people felt that the film is lighthearted for the subject it is covering but this very fact does not take anything from this engrossing tale even if it looks like Oceans Eleven going into the heart of the Second World War inferno.",1424304000,,1332,4.672340425531915

There is a lot of smoking in this movie which was typical of that era. I do thoroughly enjoy historical movies. If you enjoy history you will enjoy this movie.

5806102,2,B00DHJT4DU,"This is a very old-fashioned film with a wasted cast, a meandering, episodic plot (when one would expect something a little too linear) and what might be the worst soundtrack in modern memory.  This is a somber subject--saving the masterpieces of western art from the Nazis (and potentially the Russians) at a time when the blood already spilled threatens to minimize the enormity and importance of the so-called monuments men's task.  This would normally call for a soundtrack as serious as that task, one that is unobtrusive (this is a war movie after all) and appropriate for the individual scenes.

Instead we get some jolly melodies at the beginning that make us feel as if we've walked onto the set of a Judy Garland/Mickey Rooney ""let's put on a show"" film.  It reinforces the fear that Clooney has assembled a group of his best friends to co-star in a movie that is incidental to the joy of their simply being together.  These characters are identified but not defined.  Compare, for example, the individual members of an ensemble cast in something like The Guns of Navarone, where we hear backstories, see conflict and interplay and know why, precisely, Anthony Quinn had to play one role and David Niven another.  The curious casting is reinforced by the presence of star-de-jour Hugh Bonneville (who [spoiler] is quickly dispatched by the Germans).  Identified as an alcoholic, his appearance is fresh-faced and vigorous and his haircut is perfection itself, the sort of `do that would be demanded by the Earl of Grantham.  The only things we can imagine him drinking are 12 year-old Macallan, Yorkshire Gold Tea and the finest sherry and port that sterling can buy.  At the end of the film the inappropriate/inexplicable casting reaches a world-class crescendo when an aged Clooney appears--none other than his dad Nick, who for all Cincinnatians will be forever remembered as a local tv affiliate broadcaster who now does infomercials.  At least Aunt Rosemary wasn't resurrected to tip off the location of the art by standing at the entrance to a German salt mine and singing `Come Onna My House.'

Later in the film we hear music more appropriate for a Fourth of July parade and some that all veterans have heard in Army training films.  The soundtrack is so wildly inappropriate as to distort the genre and undercut any pretensions that the film might have to being serious entertainment (never mind serious art).

The language mixing is equally silly.  Sometimes the Germans speak German, sometimes English.  Cate Blanchett moves between French and English.  Compare the Franklin Schaffner Patton where the Germans all speak German with English subtitles, which adds texture to the film as well as a sense of seriousness.

Individual scenes appear that carry no rationale.  They do not advance the plot in any way, so why are they there?  Even acknowledging that the Germans are in retreat, the battlefields are largely silent, including a scene identified as `the Battle of the Bulge' where one has no sense whatsoever that the Germans were advancing with tanks, heavy artillery and thousands of individuals with small arms.  The American Army camp is more quiet than a thousand-acre cemetery at midnight.

Considering the story that Clooney (as co-author and director) has at his disposal, this is a missed opportunity for the ages.",1421884800,3,3350,5.009025270758123

5806171,3,B00DHJT4DU,"ver since The Guns of Navarone, the film industry has made good use of the retired specialist or devil-may-care criminal to do things the regular army deem impossible or impractical. This movie is no exception except this time its a small band of seven entirely ill prepared art specialists rescuing stuff from Nazi clutches.

The whole film has a very vintage feel; you could easily be watching one of the classic war films from the 60s and 70s and I assume that is an intentional washed out Technicolor homage to the genre rather than just lazy, corny dialogue & soundtrack.

The basis of the film is rooted in the true story of the Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program (MFAA) which did genuinely rescue art works and find vast hoards of art salted away by the Nazi destined for Hitlers museum project. The whole story has, however, been thoroughly Americanised (just for a change!), playing down the role of the British in founding the organisation and completely unnecessarily altering the actions of one of the key Nazis who actually defied the Nero Decree. [Thanks, as ever, to the splendid Wikipedia for the background.] The Russians are also reduced to acquisitive louts, completely downplaying their role in the war  something the Americans either don't know or don't want to admit.

Anyway, that notwithstanding, this isn't a bad little film; a safe & gentle war film to watch with the family on a wet Sunday afternoon. It has a light, comedic touch and some great acting talent, but the script doesnt really give them the opportunity to shine, the pace is a bit uneven to say the least and the French accents wander about all over the place.",1421539200,,1658,4.786713286713287
5806172,2,B00DHJT4DU,"Two wasted hours watching a disappointingly disjointed concoction of what is a remarkable story.  First of all, the music was very distracting - loud marches had no place in the movie, as did the sporadic jokes.  This movie could have been so much more if it had been told more from both the Nazi and American perspectives.  It had the potential to be exciting but that didn't happen.  Character development (except for Cate Blanchett's character) was weak.  The well-known actors such as Matt Damon, John Goodman, Bill Murray and George Clooney were also a distraction as it felt as though they were just hanging out.  Scenes were disjointed, hoping from one location to another.  Sloppy writing omitted many of the facts.  We made it through to the end, but I have to say I've seen enough of the self-absorbed, smirking George Clooney (who can't act).  Now that you've made the big marital step, George, we don't need to see your over-exposed face.  I don't recommend this movie.  It's a waste of time.

It is remarkable that such a tiny team of dedicated museum curators, historians turned into unlikely soldiers managed to rescue, recover and restore so many pieces of art sometimes just ahead of Russians bent on finding art treasures for transport to Russia as payment for their horrendous losses at Nazi hands.  The actors were so skillful that I forgot at times they were acting as they melded into an unlikely, but highly disciplined, dedicated and effective team.  That Matt Damon turned down a French curator's  offer to spend the night was believable and represented the best of gentlemen of the time as was the true shock of team member's quiet loathing of the Nazis as they contemplated the enormity of the Nazi horror when they find huge barrels filled with gold fillings from Jews who died in the camps.",1420675200,10,1208,4.9950248756218905

5806307,2,B00DHJT4DU,"I purchased this on Amazon, and had to wait too long to get it. The film is based on book by Robert M. Edsel, perhaps a bad omen. Clooney produced, directed, and wrote the screenplay for the movie, thereby proving his incompetence in 3 areas. The dialogue is embarrassingly bad, as is the choice of some cast members such as the absurd-looking Bill Murray and the silly-looking Fred Flintstone a.k.a. John Goodman. Hugh Bonneville reprises his role as an alcoholic from PBS/BBC's ""Downton Abbey."" There is nothing wrong with his performance just the dialogue; he just plays himself. He is quickly eliminated when his life is supposedly swapped for a statue of the Madonna even though it is still stolen right from under his dying nose. Inexplicably the hunk of stone is referred to as ""she.""  I had hoped that Matt Damon's intelligence would ensure a good movie. As it tuned out, he disappears for most of the movie, but when he returns, the movie improves immensely, and the last 20 minutes or so are very good. It is as if Matt usurped the malfeasant Clooney's 3 functions. The change is very obvious. What a shame that the whole movie was not up to that standard. The story is an important one and needs to be told; unfortunately a new vehicle is needed. I was shocked that there were not only 3 movie previews at the beginning, but also a commercial for Sony's shoddy products. That stuff should be listed as a choice, not force fed especially since I had bought the DVD. There was a preview for ""Pompeii,"" which looks as bad as ""M.M."" Interestingly enough, the DVD is cheaper than going to a theater or even Pay Per View, and I still have the DVD.",1420243200,,1652,4.562289562289562

5806476,5,B00DHJT4DU,"I enjoyed this movie very much.  I remember when Iraq fell and cities and the dictator's palace were being overrun.  The news commentators were discussing the destruction and looting that was going on and they were concerned about the country's museums because Iraq was formerly called ""Mesopotamia"" as in the cradle of life, the land between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers.  The news commentators were hoping that someone was going to show up to help preserve Iraq's and Mesopotamia's and humanity's history as the museums contained irreplaceable artifacts going back to the beginnings of human history.  Artifacts that could be stolen and end up in private collections, disappear forever, or be destroyed like the giant Buddhas that were destroyed by those lunatics in Afghanistan.  Fast forward a few years.  A movie comes out, based on a true story, about men (and a woman), art experts, people who cared about preserving history.  They were people who understood that art is important to a country's culture, history,  well being, self identity------important to the world's. This is a World War II story. The art that was in jeopardy was art stolen by the Nazis, from museums and from private owners. The Nazis were losing the war and were determined not to leave any of the art behind as they retreated.  They were either moving it with them, moving it into hiding places to be retrieved later or destroying it. The Monuments Men were charged with finding the hidden art pieces or getting to art pieces before they could be hidden or destroyed by the Nazis or confiscated by the advancing Russians (who would keep them instead as spoils of war.)  The mission of the Monuments Men included returning the artwork to their rightful owners. So this special squad was formed by George Clooney's character, Frank Stokes.  George Clooney headed a terrific cast that included Matt Damon, John Goodman, Bill Murray, Cate Blanchett, Hugh Bonneville, Bob Balaban and Jean DuJardin.  The acting was great.  Each portrayal was believable.  The story moved along at a pretty quick pace.  It didn't take many detours away from the main story.  The story was quite interesting and realistic.  The Army working it's way through World War II Europe was the background and was well done.  I didn't want the movie to be over so quickly (although the dvd's box says it was 118 minutes long---it seemed to go by quickly)  I'm sure there were a lot more adventures that the Monuments Men experienced that there wasn't time to go into. It's about time that these brave, dedicated people were recognized for the important job that they did.  They saved civilization!  I definitely recommend this movie and plan to watch it again, probably a few more times.  I hope there are still people out there doing this important work whenever  there is a war or crisis.  I hope people like these went into Iraq to save the antiquities!",1418860800,,2908,4.899795501022495

5806498,4,B00DHJT4DU,"This was a good movie, but it could have been better, and its basic thesis is wrong. I think it jumped too much from one event to another - not always, but frequently. When it dwelt longer on an event, the part shown was better. Similarly, there was much unstated left to our imagination. This is generally good. In fact I like ambiguities and obscurities, but I think the film would have been enhanced by more information about the history of the men and women involved, the art work, what happened to the two Nazis who were captured. It was there but it was sketchy.

What bothered me the most was the thesis of the film which was brought out clearly by President Truman's question to the leader of the monument men and by the leader's visit to a piece of art years later: Do you think that the two men who lost their lives to save art would be proud to have died so that a piece of art was saved? In essence, the question is: isn't art more important than human lives. The leader of the monument men says at one point that if you kill people, others will survive and civilization will continue, but if you destroy art, a civilization is destroyed. The film also makes its point by having the monument men's greatest goal to save a statue of the Madonna and her child.

I think life is more important than art, in fact more important than anything, even religious objects. One should not give up one's life even to save a New Testament, Quran, or Torah, even if the sacred object is a relic over a thousand years old. One should not even give up one's life to observe any religious practice. There are Jewish sages who feel that one should give up one's life rather than allow someone to force him or her to kill another, or to commit adultery, or to publically profane God in a way that hurts others. Even if one accepts that dying for these things is proper, these are acts that affect life. Not everyone agrees that one should die for these three things. Others think that one should die only for the first, when someone holds a weapon to your head and says kill him or I will kill you. Why? Because your blood, they say, is no redder than the other person's blood.

In any event, my view is that it is a good idea to send men to try and save art from the hands of Nazis, even if there is danger involved. We can and should say that the men involved were courageous. But we should not say that art is better than their lives.",1418601600,,2430,4.278260869565218

5806598,4,B00DHJT4DU,"This movie shows an alternate view of WWII, which I'm always looking for.  WWII is such a large portion of American and world history, but the smaller details are often overshadowed by the Holocaust and Hitler.  This film takes us on an adventure with a group of men - barely soldiers - who are art scholars and historians seeking to find the stolen art and artifacts that the Nazis confiscated as they marched through Europe.  It showcases several of the larger battles that they encountered along the way and highlights an completely different aspect of the war - the fight to return some of society's greatest achievements back to their rightful owners/museums.  It also sheds some light on the interesting relationship we had with the Russians during this time who, as we marched from the West, were headed toward Germany from the East hoping to locate the art and keep it for themselves.  There are a few gruesome parts that bring the frightening humanity of war close to home, so please heed the PG-13 rating.  I teach 6th grade and while I'd LOVE to show this movie to them after we finish our study of Bomb... by Steve Sheinkin, I know there are portions of it that are far too gruesome to share with some of my more fragile students.  (The Battle of the Bulge scene for one, where a haunting rendition of ""Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas"" is played over the loudspeaker at camp while you're watching scenes of injured soldiers in the med unit....)  All in all, it's an excellent film, one that I purchased for my husband (a history buff) for Christmas.

5806615,3,B00DHJT4DU,"This is a loveable, likeable film, largely because of the ensemble cast of loveable, likeable actors, from George Clooney to Matt Damon to Bill Murray to John Goodman. It's a true story, so we know it's a worthwhile tale. Much of the film is told in an upbeat breezy fashion. This does give us the sense that this is a World War II tale with a difference; but it also paints the war as something that was happening elsewhere, even as we're in the midst of it (rubble, some gunfire). It's a caper, a mystery, but so largely dependent on dumb luck that you wonder how our hapless Monuments Men ever made their way. Given the cast and the tory they're telling, we desperately want it to be a monumental tale... but somehow, it isn't.

Bill Murray and John Goodman, as comfortable as they are with edgy directors and offbeat rhythms, don't catch fire here, and at best we are lulled by the gorgeous tones of George Clooney's voice. Too bad.

The bonus features to this disk are nothing special - a 5:20 feature on the key cast talking about how the film was made, and then another 7:50 of essentially the same thing. There's also a 1:30 trailer that assembles the best scenes to a driving techno beat, some contemporary song that doesn't actually appear in the film.

Given the richness of the story, there's clearly a lot they could have done with the extras - more information about the masterpieces of European art featured in the story, or more information about the real Monuments Men. Lost opportunity...",1417651200,,1506,4.591078066914498

5806685,4,B00DHJT4DU,"Europe, the closing days of World War 2.  Nazi Germany is spiriting away many of the great artworks of western Europe for either it's ranking officers or Hitler's planned grand art museum in Linz, Austria.  Alarmed by what has happened in Florence, Italy, Lt. Frank Stokes assembles a group of six other art experts who also passionately believe that victory will mean nothing if a significant part of world culture is lost to rescue these works before they fall victim to Hitler's mad plan to destroy them if defeat becomes inevitable or Russia's claim on them as war reparations.

These are the Monuments Men.  If you ever plan to tour the art of Belgium, you have them to thank that much of what you will see has not disappeared into oblivion.

The men split up, some specifically requesting to be assigned to works to which they have a personal attachment.  Among the art especially earmarked for defense and/or rescue are the Madonna of Bruges - one of the few works by Michelangelo outside of Italy, and the Ghent Altarpiece (a.k.a. Adoration of the Mystic Lamb) by Van Eyck - one of the greatest works of the Northern Renaissance.  Their journey will be a rollercoaster of euphoric success and heartbreaking tragedy.

The movie is also a philosophical exercise.  Are these works worth lives?  We are very much left to draw our own conclusion.  Perhaps the vague response Stokes gives when asked this question near the end of the movie answers it best.

Monuments Men was not a critical darling, but I for one found it very moving.",1416960000,,1537,4.7368421052631575

5806689,3,B00DHJT4DU,"When I saw the preview for The Monuments Men, I was really excited. I've never been all that crazy about George Clooney, but I love Matt Damon, and the film is based on a little known tale from a famous historic event. Stories like this one, are often turned into some of the best films that Hollywood has to offer, and I was sure this film would be a can't miss. Clooney stars and directs this extremely large and diverse cast, which ultimately turns into it's downfall. When you have a large cast of talent, you need to be very careful about how you use them. In The Monuments Men, the cast is split up all across Europe, leading to short scenes, that jump from location to location far too quickly. When the crew is reunited towards the end, the film becomes much better, and in my opinion, this is how the story should have been told right from the beginning. The story centers around a community of art lovers, who are distraught about the Nazi's theft of historic works of art. As the war is winding down and the Nazis defeat is imminent, these men want to make sure that the worlds greatest works of art are protected, and their willing to risk their lives to do so. As I stated earlier, George Clooney stars and gives his usual performance. When Clooney first started doing movies, he was exciting and really gave audiences their moneys worth, but lately all he does is play the same character over and over again. Clooney is the mysterious, handsome stranger, who does a lot without saying much. Some people love that kind of thing, as for me, I find it to be lazy. If you just wanted to direct, there was more than enough talent to carry this film, and in fact, I would have preferred to see Bill Murray or John Goodman in larger roles. The story told in The Monuments Men is extremely interesting, but it's told in these fast paced, short scenes, that do nothing but confuse the audiences and squander the extreme amount of talent this film has to offer. Needless to say, while I thought the film was a great idea, I was far from impressed.",1416873600,,2051,4.428571428571429

5806785,4,B00DHJT4DU,"This was quite an enjoyable film, one that reminded me of older movies in a way.  Despite it being set in WWII, there wasn't a lot of fighting or gore.  Instead, the focus was on the rush to rescue as much of the great artistic heritage of Europe as possible and to find and return this art to the original owners, be it a museum or to individual collectors.  The characters are well-drawn, well-portayed by a familiar and professional cast of actors and movie very much holds your interest.  George Clooney did a good directing job with the movie and my only quibble is a couple of scenes that really didn't add much to the plot.

The movie is based on a true story of the men (American, British, French) who were given a job by the President to go into Western Europe and try and save as many paintings, sculptures, historic buildings and so on as was possible during the end days of WWII.  Set against the backdrop of the fighting during the last year of the war, this small team went out into the frontlines to try to protect and reclaim artistic masterpieces from the Nazis.  They tracked down stolen pieces and tried to stop the Nazis from burning the rest as the Allies overtook them or keep the Russians from taking the plunder for themselves as they themselves swept in from the East.  With little aid from the military forces--who were, understandably more interested in finishing off the war--they risked their lives to find where the Nazis had shipped the stolen masterpieces, with the focus more specifically on a particular famous Madonna sculpture and a painted set of Medieval panels.

As you watch the movie, you also see the men stumble across the remains of the lives that were also ""stolen"" by the Nazis and it is made clear that, despite being able to recover at least some of the artwork, sometimes there is just no one left to return it to.  That you can't bring back everything that was lost during the horrors of that war.  This draws a link between the irreplaceable lives and artwork, both precious in their own way and that were destroyed due to fear, hatred, and greed.

Bill Murray also did a great job in this movie--the night scene at the Battle of Bulge made me cry--and you will also recognize many other faces besides that of George Clooney, Matt Damon, and Cate Blanchett, especially Hugh Bonneville of ""Downton Abbey"" fame.  There are some funny moments in this movie, all too brief glimpses of some wonderful scenery, and plenty of dedication and adoration of the artistic wonders of old Europe.",1416182400,,2533,4.614699331848552

The move tells the story of tracking down paintings and artifacts stolen by the Nazis during WWII.  The men on this mission were trying to accomplish this feat while the war was still ongoing and obviously very dangerous.  In addition, they were competing with the Russians in the same quest.

On the surface THE MONUMENTS MEN takes a much lighter approach to tell its story, but underneath it all it is still a story of WWII focusing perhaps on the larger picture of why we fight. The preservation of culture, a way of life and not just living day to day are questions it poses in a very subtle way. The cast is very good and it is interesting to see this quirky bunch of art historians and the like track down paintings, sculptures and various art treasures that the Nazis had stolen, hidden with the intent of getting them all back into Germany for Hitler. Along the way they find that war is no laughing matter and in the finale the question is asked if the sacrifices made on this quest was ultimately worth the price that was paid.

5807092,1,B00DHJT4DU,A boring movie about a group of people trying to save over-valued items. Materialistic possessions are not worth a human life. Would you sacrifice a loved one for a fancy picture or a slab of rock? I would not. You can make new things but you can't bring back a life lost. silly humans,1412812800,,285,4.296296296296297

5807137,3,B00DHJT4DU,"First of all, it's a crime to make a radiant actress, Cate Blanchett, so drab and unattractive in a film. Mr. Clooney should be fined for such a felony committed against movie viewers. I applaud his attempt to make a 1960s type movie about WWII, however. The movie fails as far as acting and story is concerned. How can such a talented group of actors turn out such a weak movie? The responsibility falls on the writer and director. The action is often predictable. One scene is lifted right out of Full Metal Jacket.
Such a great topic, such a stinker of a movie.",1412380800,,564,4.4326923076923075

I am an Art teacher and this movie is such an important contribution to why it is important to protect our art through out the world. I wanted to show this to my Middle School classes, but due to the cursing and some - not much - violence - my principal said no. Understandably, but anyone who sees this movie will be changed.

5807139,5,B00DHJT4DU,"The film was a great addition to the book -- it condensed the story but kept the essential focus and was a powerful support to it.  Since this was part of my family history it was all the more meaningful.  My maternal grandfather's family emigrated to the US from Siegen, my stepfather was in the US Army and set up and operated the radio station that broadcast the Nurnberg trials, my mother and my sisters and I travelled extensively in Germany and have many friends and distant relatives there.  Our last trip down the Rhine ended at the cathedral in Bruge where we saw the lovely Michelangelo Madonna and Christ Child.

The humanity of the characters was a pleasure to see and each actor and actress was just right for his/her role.  I hope audiences will realize how much we owe to men and women who tried to save our cultural heritage along with the lives of millions of people.  It is a strong anti-war film.",1412294400,5,915,4.481927710843373

5807166,1,B00DHJT4DU,It will be a long time before I rent another movie from Amazon. I started this movie but was unable to get back to it for a couple of days. It was then that I discovered the 24 hour clause. When I used to rented DVD's at a store most of them gave 72 hours. I think if you rent a single viewing stream you should be able to view the entire movie once before having to pay again regardless of how long it takes.

The characters were much of the story--artists retrieving the art for future generations.  But if you are looking for a fast pased action movie, this may disappoint you a little.  We watched with teenaged grandsons who were expecting a lot of WW2 action and fighting scenes.  We actually watched it a second time together when their expectations were focused on the tragedy of destroying all that beautiful and historical art, and they really liked it then.

I don't know, maybe it was the previews that just made the movie look like it would be boring or something to me. Then,  before I went to watch the movie, I looked up reviews from other people.  Many people said the movie was lacking, that it had too much comedy in it and was too lighthearted, etc. etc.  Needless to say, I didn't go into watching this movie very excited.  Well, I will have to say that it's obvious that people have different tastes for sure.  I thought this movie was really good!  ""Too lighthearted"" ?  Huh?  People died, they had moments of pointing out what happened to the Jewish people, there was definitely other sad and touching moments as well.  None of which I thought were comedic in any way.  I'm not sure what the movie was ""lacking"".  I thought it was well done.  Loved the acting, loved the quick witty humor (all done in the right places), love the story of each character, loved the message the movie told, and many other wonderful things about it.  Please, don't waste your time reading all the negative reviews.  I believe this is definitely one you just need to see for yourself and not go by what others say.

5807454,3,B00DHJT4DU,George Clooney's attempt to make a 1960's style war epic about World War II wound up being The Longest Movie rather than The Longest Day. The story of the men who helped save the great works of art from destruction by the NAZIs would have worked better had it been treated as a suspense drama with a small cast rather than an epic adventure story. Many of the cast choices were ludicrous in an effort to have star power. The worst choice was Cate Blanchett attempting to portray a Parisian art archivist with a dreadful French accent. It was a promising story and deserved a better director and script.,1410307200,,602,4.532110091743119

5807496,5,B00DHJT4DU,"Movies are often about men risking their lives searching for treasure. These men risked their lives saving cultural treasures. Some them were killed doing it.

This is a very good film. Not a great one, but very good. Ignore the bad reviews, most of which were apparently written by people expecting a John Wayne movie. This story is less about fighting the war & more about why it had to be fought, to preserve everything we hold dear.

It is a story about saving history from those who would distort it or destroy it. As Clooney says at one point, we're fighting to save our culture and our way of life. WWII wasn't fought just to reclaim territory, it was fought to save Western Civilization from the fascists.

The Nazis were right-wing gangsters who tried to dominate the world and destroy what they couldn't dominate, including irreplaceable cultural and historical artifacts. Paintings by the great masters, sculptures by Michelangelo and other giants, books, monuments, church art, even church bells were looted, bombed or burned by the Nazis. In all, they stole or smashed over five million pieces of art, most of it from Jews they had murdered or enslaved. They referred to this art as ""ownerless.""

When it was clear Germany would lose the war, Hitler ordered thousands of priceless historical artifacts destroyed rather than allow them to be recovered by the Americans and returned to the countries they were stolen from. However, thanks to the Monuments Men, most of it was rescued before these orders could be carried out.

This is an important story that needs to be told. The book was better, of course; much more detailed. But the film is very well-made & entertaining, so even if you don't care about art, my guess is you won't be disappointed.",1410134400,,1762,4.821192052980132

5807561,2,B00DHJT4DU,"The Monuments Men, 2014 film

It begins by showing paintings which were removed from a church to hide them from the Germans. [War is about property, to get it or to keep it.] We see Germans marching through Paris. Goering inspects paintings. A champagne goblet is prepared for German officers. In Italy people work to save a famous wall painting from bombing. Can these works of art be saved? Can the US Army send a team of artists to Europe to save them? They will try. Men receive Draft Notices then go to Basic Training. They were selected on their knowledge of real art, to protect them from confiscation by the Germans. Are those real bullets? Some German trucks were captured with boxes of art treasures. So too a trainload of boxes sent to Siegen (and other places). This saves history and culture. Can they get ahead of the Third Army to capture this stolen art? [Note how much smoking they do.] They arrive at the front lines. There is drama. Can they save the Cathedral of Bruges?

Then its December 1944, the Battle of the Bulge. They show scenes with a song about Merry Christmas for irony. [This copies the 1963 movie The Victors.] The Russians have a Trophy Brigade to regain stolen art. They learn about the Nero Decree to destroy everything after the German Fuehrer dies. There is shooting on a country road. They capture a map that is marked. What is behind that brick wall? Claire provides information, she kept notes. [This is slow-moving at times; script or director?] They search another salt mine to find 100 tons of gold bullion! Elsewhere captured art is destroyed by the Germans. One soldier stepped on a land mine! There is a fix. They find barrels of gold teeth! They find statues, some paintings were burned. One mine had its entrance destroyed. Will the German officer talk? This area will be turned over to the Russians tomorrow. The last panel is found before they pull out. Stokes finds a statue at the last hour. The last scenes tell about the successful retrieval of other private art, over five million pieces. Many great works of art were never recovered. Will anyone remember this in thirty years? Yes, when they write a book.

Note how some of this stolen property was taken from an ally. This is a good story, not a great one. It is based on a true story, little known as it was censored for decades. The book must be better. The disappearance of that gold bullion became another unsolved mystery of WW II. [Who had the motive, means, and opportunity?] They did not receive any consideration for showing the use of tobacco products (nicotine is a mild stimulant). Is this movie worth watching?

5807581,4,B00DHJT4DU,"Having grown-up in the 1950's and 1960's, the years after WWII, I can easily feel physically nauseated by watching movies and documentaries about the atrocities of World War II, the Nazis, and the bloodbaths of the battlefields, the concentration camps, and the ruined cities.  The war was very real to our parents' generation and to us, to their children, as well.  Our fathers, in particular, suffered, with thousands of others, to win that war.  We will never forget our shock and revulsion when we fully learned to what depths civilized people can descend.

I think that one of the strengths of The Monuments Men is that it allows us to revisit a brutal, tragic time without saturating the viewer's imagination with horror.

I came away from the film with a feeling of deep gratitude to the brave men and women who fought and prevailed against a terrible foe during one of humanity's darkest hours.",1409529600,,902,4.8311688311688314

Bill Murray's few and sparse segments are brilliant and we're more than likely so because of him.
Cate Blanchett, as stunning as always, as devoted as always, as brilliant as always can not even rise above the morass of lazy cinematography, writing, and canned scenes anyone over the age of nine saw and was over the first time he or she witnessed.

5807773,2,B00DHJT4DU,"The ads for this movie were out of touch and just plain false.  The acting in this version of the THE RAPE OF EUROPA among others, by stating this is the first time this secret plan of Hitler to destroy all culture/arts not to his liking or steal same does a dis-service to those proud Europeans, [who died] and those Frenchman who felt the Art was all that was left of their heritage of their culture and what was Paris an remains Paris both before and during and after the war.  Burt Lancaster originally brought role that Damon/George Clooney attempted to portray. The ""arts"" which after we die is all that we leave behind, destroyed by Hitler and those with such greed/avarice such as Himmler and
Goebels and many others, just is poorly portrayed for the modern day audiences.  The title is a poor and inadequate portrayal; of what happened in Europe and in all likelihood is happening in Russia, and the Baghdad region [Hanging Gardens of Babylon, then considered one of the 7 wonders of the ancient world, amongst others in the Middle east including Egypt, Damascus, Carthage  and Jerusalem and Mecca] that to improperly advertise same, then not shed light on what the consequences would have been if Hitler and his goons had succeeded, is a dis-service especially to the then curator at the Louvre [called Les Petit Pous"" in the movie I believe which is one buildings of the Louvre at the
Place de la Concorde and long since formerly incorporated into the Louvre.  The acting what little there was, was and will remain unacceptable to the reality of what occurred.  The overall picture portrayed, did however portray the barbarism when the various Master's
works of art were summarily burned and or destroyed.  More of that should have been shown.  Also, given the recent discovery in Germany
in the upper floors of a apartment building, where one warped minded former SS member had hidden over 1800 works of previously lost or
destroyed works, as does the The Hermitage in St. Petersburg,Russia should have found its way into the post scripts;.  The world should know what is they are looking at in some one's home, if it truly a work of art or the product of the madness of the Germans and Russians.",1408752000,,2208,4.714285714285714

Trite, in fact. Excepting Cate Blanchett (who is very strong) and the comedic chemistry between Murray and Balaban, the acting is really only passable; and another movie featuring the buddy-duo of Clooney and Damon is just too much. They are great in movies like Oceans 11, but a serious drama is just beyond them as a pair. Further, the film was badly cut, and the sound track was distracting at best and downright silly and peppy at worst. Of course, you will be rooting for the Monument Men, but it is the real heroes you are rooting for and thankful for. The film is strongest in its use of their actual words. It is weakest when Clooney tries to do imitations of thoughtful, angst-filled inspirational speeches that are painful in their cheesy predictability.

5808552,2,B00DHJT4DU,"Not really that great of a film, which is a shame.  Great cast, the script just never really came together.  There was no chemistry and every scene felt forced.  I get the feeling maybe there is another 45 minutes on the cutting room floor somewhere showing the character development and build up to various scenes that maybe would have made for a good movie, but what we have here just isn't it.

One specific criticism - at several points, I get the impression the director was trying to emphasis how evil the Nazi's were by referencing the horrible atrocities of the war and their treatment of the Jews.  However, all that ended up doing was undercutting the importance of the movie we were watching.  In one scene, the audience is asked to feel sadness for the destruction of many great works of art - perfectly fine - but then the characters find a barrel full of gold teeth (presumably from Jewish victims), and that takes the viewer out of the moment to make them think ""Wow, destruction of art, while certainly disappointing, seems trivial compared to the destruction of human lives in this war.""

In the end, an interesting premise that could have been a great story with 'fish out of water' artists trying to make it through boot camp, and 'I didn't sign up for this' moments where they confront military dangers while trying to find lost art.  But that isn't this movie.",1407110400,,1381,4.631147540983607

5808554,2,B00DHJT4DU,"""The Monuments Men"" was an embarrassment because of the obvious plot direction, the stock portrayals of the participants, and the overall shallowness of the production.  The portrayal of the Bad Germans hasn't changed since the propaganda films of the '40's, and okay, I'm not an apologist for the Nazis, but the cinema is supposed to make some attempts at artistic creativity.  That doesn't happen here.  There is no subtleness or understatement in the disjointed portrayals of the many leitmotivs.  The sameness was an effrontery to a viewer who thought this movie might be worth a view because of the uniqueness of the subject.  Instead, the preachiness and self-righteousness verged on Are you serious? hokum.",1407110400,,713,5.219298245614035
5808585,5,B00DHJT4DU,An excellent story of what happened in Europe during the latter stages of WWII. With so much bomb/fire damage an accurate total will never be found. Acting and scene portrayals were better than average. I doubt Europe will ever recover totally.,1407110400,,244,4.975609756097561
5808586,2,B00DHJT4DU,"This movie can't decide if it's a war-buddy movie, a comedy, or a faux historical documentary with insight into yet more corners of the Nazi atrocities.  With George Clooney narrating and staring (and directing), and Bill Murray and John Goodman it's got too much goofiness.  Matt Damon has trouble doing light serious, and Cate Blanchett goes overboard on the heavy serious.  It's tedious to get going, flitting between too many coincident details and lots of assumed camaraderie between the art experts cum soldiers.

5808587,3,B00DHJT4DU,"Not as good as I expected. The effort was there from the Studios, but you can tell they were limited on budget. It feels as if it was done in a rush, and they were hoping to make a great film by putting together a great casting ensemble, that it would be a hit and make big profits. The film failed to keep my full attention from time to time, and quite frankly I couldn't wait for the movie to end. I felt I did not have to wait for the end as the storyline was very much predictable. Scenes that were supposed to be dramatic and get my eyes watery, looked fake and unnatural. These are very well known actors most of us enjoy to see them work, but I will not blame the failed attempt to make this a great movie on them, I will put the blame on the Director, Executive Producers, and supporting Studios. These actors have the skills, and you can recognize it, but not entirely. It is easy to see how ""poorly they were directed!"" I would give it a rating of only two stars, but I am giving it three just because these wonderful cast showed up to work and did not quit their contract. It takes guts!

I would normally re-sell a movie like this one to lighten the load on my collection, but I may decide to keep it indefinitely just because I like these ""Monuments of Men.""

Watch if you enjoy these actors, and enjoy conventional dramas.  The movie has a decent period look, references some gripping historical dramas, and has good pacing.  The direction, acting and cinematography are not distracting.

Don't watch if deviation from actual history bugs you, or if cliched writing bugs you.

I have also read all of the books about the Monuments Men, including the one that this movie claims to be based on. This movie is like a punch list getting all the right details, right down to the dental chair, wrung out of the photographs (the production design is often a recreation of archival images) and the personal written accounts. But the film plods totally, completely free of the verve and inventive character of the men who did this tremendous service for humanity. I was greatly disappointed that something so important could be neutered into such dullness. Never mind the Ettinger couldn't drive, and Rorimer drove his young private around himself, as a translator. And French guy never existed -- pure schmaltz. And oh yea, it is not known what happened to Raphael's Portrait of a Young Noble, which the Nazi is shown burning, but you can be certain beyond doubt the very last thing that would have been found there would be a Picasso, whose works were considered degenerate.

5809005,3,B00DHJT4DU,"I'm afraid that, much as I liked the premise of this movie, I have to side with those who feel it wasn't very well realized. It's actually something of a remake of 'The Magnificent Seven', with the Yul Brynner part played by George Clooney and the Steve McQueen part played by Matt Damon. They bring in another 5 art-lovers to help them rescue art from the Nazi thieves.

Where the film doesn't do so well is that there is no sense of continuity. To some extent this would be understandable if this were a documentary, because the voice-over could provide the links, but in a movie it simply means the film moves from scene to scene with no build-up of tension or sense of involvement. It's not helped by a limp script that leaves most of the characters with nothing memorable to say (exactly why Bill Murray is in the film I have no idea; his character says hardly anything and looks as though he has indigestion most of the time).

The only characters who are a little intriguing are Cate Blanchett's informant and Bob Balaban's enthusiastic art connoisseur, but they are only intermittently involved as the movie flips from scene to scene.

It's not a bad movie; it's fairly short and the topic is interesting. However, it falls between a true documentary and a war/suspense movie and as such left me feeling rather unsatisfied.",1406332800,,1331,4.6553191489361705

5809010,2,B00DHJT4DU,"""Monuments Men"" lacks any dramatic momentum. It seems more like a star turn for Clooney and a reason to get a group of his old buddies together. The actors, particularly John Goodman and Bill Murray, just appear to turn up for a paycheck, and even the loss of key characters lacks any real emotional punch. Clooney is far from any kind of serious actor, and despite seeming to be a quite charming and concerned citizen of the world, his movies lately have him ""behaving"" rather than ""acting."" This movie is really a time-waster.",1406332800,,528,4.688172043010753

5809090,1,B00DHJT4DU,"This film is riddled with historical errors from beginning to end.  The first scene shows the people of Milan removing rubble from around da Vinci's Last Supper and then shows George Clooney talking about how the English air raids were destroying much of European cultural heritage, insinuating that it was an English raid that almost destroyed the Last Supper when in reality it was the American bomber offensive of August 1943 which destroyed most of the church housing this mural in addition to La Scala and many other Milanese monuments.  This air offensive also destroyed the first church in Rome and killed thousands of Romans.  Two years later American bombs would destroy much of Vienna, Salzburg, Linz, Graz, and Innsbruck.  This same scene shows Clooney saying that the Germans destroyed Florence.  The movie shows a photograph of about a dozen wrecked buildings in Florence, which were blown up along with the Ponte Vecchio before the Americans arrived.  In reality, outside of American air raids on the train stations and these dozen buildings in the town center, Florence suffered very little damage during the war.  Near the end of the film the movie makers place a North German half-timbered town in the middle of the Alps (!); Austro-Bavarian architecture does not include this type of structure.  And then the film shows the Russians occupying a mountain area of Austria when in reality they did not occupy any Alpine territory.  The Russian zone included Vienna, the area north of the Danube River, and the Burgenland, none of which contain mountains.

5809137,5,B00DHJT4DU,"Great movie--the story is good, but the most fun part is all the magnificent art you get to see. Adolph Hitler, a second-rate artist, still had a good eye for art and during World War II, he wanted all of it. His army was instructed to collect as much of it as possible. Statues and paintings were stored in caves, etc. and when the tide of the war began to turn against Germany, he wanted the art destroyed rather than preserved for the ages.  George Clooney and a selected group of men were commissioned to save the art.
  However, I ordered a new DVD and the one that came was not in cellophane, so I assume it has been used.

Going into to a movie with such a stellar cast you always expect the best and this did not disappoint. If you are looking for a blood and guts WWII movie this is not for you , if you are looking for a WWII docudrama then this is the movie for you.

Was interesting to see that even though the war had ended, there were still pockets in Europe of Germans still wanting to fight so they had to be careful when entering buildings housing the art.  I guess one thing that, to me was disappointing and something that happens so much in our government is how these men put their lives on the line to do this and even fought to get it done but when they found the gold Hitler was hoarding, which helped tear down his empire, it wasn't them that got the credit but the ones in leadership in the US.  These men should be honored for their valor and bravery so if it's only through a movie that this is done then so be it.

5809387,4,B00DHJT4DU,"A masterpiece of the variety talked about in the book.  This book exposes an aspect of WWII I knew little about.  Even though the movie made it sound like the Monuments Men were in a sequential process (liberate art treasures from one town to the next going East), the book made it clear it was far more nuanced.  They had to use their expertise, their guile and their commitment to tease out the clues that led them to Europe's masterpieces.  And it wasn't just their efforts.  We learn of locals that risked their reputations, their treasures, and even their lives to liberate the great culture of Europe so savagely stolen by the Nazis.

Beautifully developed, the book introduces us to the quiet heroes that were the Monuments Men.  We not only learn their stories, but learn about them.  These kinds of people have reputations that preceded them and successes that followed them.  Their histories are represented by more than what they accomplished in the few short years of being Monuments Men.

I read the book following enjoying the movie.  The book was far, far more interesting, challenging, and satisfying.  This said by someone who, despite the critics, enjoyed the movie immensely!",1405641600,,1194,4.885572139303482

Be in awe of and grieve for the courageous and patriotic people who gave their lives to protect and preserve France's national treasures.  ""The Monuments Men"" cannot match the quality and story line of ""The Train"", but it was interesting enough to take me to ""the end"".

5809524,5,B00DHJT4DU,"There are so many things to praise this movie for, but I will focus on two:
1) The central theme about how art in many ways not only represents a culture, but *is* the culture.  Long after a given group of people are gone art is often the sole evidence that they existed - lived, loved, fought....the themes of the art reflect the lives of the people who created.  I think this could be a clarion call to examine the ""art"" we are leaving behind....if it is not reflecting something worth treasuring, then maybe we need to re-examine our culture.

2) Clooney did not cater to the lowest common denominator in this film.  No cheap laughs, no kow-towing to familiar tropes that are all too common and cheapen other films.  Without spoiling anybody there was a scene in the film where a couple characters were in a situation that seemed to be heading toward something that is done all too often in films and tv, most of the time in no way advancing the story or character development.  My husband and I looked at each other and said ""Oh NO!  Don't do that!"" and they didn't!  =)

5809550,4,B00DHJT4DU,"My husband and I just watched The Monuments Men.  This movie is based on a true story, and that is why I ordered it in the
first place.  I was pleasantly surprised by the dedication these men had to saving valuable artifacts, risking their own lives and
sadly seeing two of them die for the cause.  I do not know if every scene in the movie was held to actual facts, but one scene
made a deep impression.  When two large containers were opened in one of the mine scenes they found small pieces of gold. One
of the men stated that the gold was fillings from teeth.  That scene made a deep impression on me as I watched the faces of
the men go blank just thinking about where that gold came from. They were stunned to silence.
I have read some of the reviews by supposedly expert reviewers, both pro and con.  I am not a expert at reviewing movies, but
I know good acting when I see it and one of the reasons I chose to order this movie is because Damon and Clooney were in it.
And I was pleasantly surprised while watching the credits to see that Clooney directed this movie too.  I have yet to see a movie
where these two men portray mediocre acting.  I really don't care one way or the other whether you liked or disliked this movie and
the men who were chosen for each part.  I was drawn to it after watching a commercial on cable, which helped me decide to
finally order it.  I will be watching it again soon, because it made a impact on me, which many World War II movies have done.  Being a baby boomer adds to my curiosity about that horrific war.  There were some scenes which depicted how hatred and greed
destroyed the lives of millions of innocent people---almost totally empty apartments.  If the walls could talk what a story they would
tell. Thank you Amazon for making this movie available and for Amazon Primes free shipping.",1405382400,,1840,4.298550724637681

5809564,1,B00DHJT4DU,What a waist of money this was. You'd think with such a solid cast this would be both funny and exciting but it was neither. The music was probably the most off putting and reminiscent of cheesy 1950's war film. It lacked depth and it seems the only charters that were killed off where the only no-name actors.

The movie managed to change the names of  the five main characters in the book and give them to five strong actors and that was good because , like the book, the plot is loose, but followed each character in what he contributed to finding so much of the stolen art in wwII.

5809696,1,B00DHJT4DU,"We watched this movie last night, and there's over 2 hours I can never get back!
This movie tried to be funny, and it wasn't.  It tried to be dramatic and it wasn't.  It tried to be inspirational and it wasn't.
I'm not quite sure WHAT kind of movie it was.
It was rather ironic that these people that wanted to preserve the great masterpieces of European civilization, many of which were the most important icons of Christianity, would shout ""J---- C-----"" at every possible, although totally unnecessary moment.  It was so bogus how the director (Clooney) threw that in there.  Even the actors didn't exclaim it convincingly!
I guess they just wanted to make sure everyone knew that these guys weren't....gasp...RELIGIOUS!  That would be crazy.  They were just art critics.
Even though death was all around them...including the loss of some of their group (which was portrayed, as the rest of the movie...unconvincingly) they still were not moved by these great works that inspired generations of Europeans to drop to their knees in awe of the majesty of the Son of God...who's name they use (so uselessly) in vain.

Though some efforts are made at character development, the whole movie is relatively flat and unsatisfying. The plot meanders along, focusing on a few random scenarios more than the efforts throughout the war. I love Cate Blanchett but she was not an appropriate choice for the French contact. In fact her entire part in the movie could have been easily left out.
The movie never really reaches a climax, instead it rambles along through many little conflicts and triumphs, which are heaped so haphazardly together that the view doesn't really experience any of them.

5809791,4,B00DHJT4DU,"A fantastic (and true) story with a first-rate script and a stellar cast. There's a lot to like about this movie. Excellent performances from both Matt Damon and George Clooney. The rest of the performances seemed to fall a bit flat though, especially John Goodman's character. Bill Murray, who has pulled off some genius performances in his day, seems to be sleep walking through most of the film. Perhaps it had something to do with the limited dialogue he was given to work with, but it definitely had enough of an impact on the film to keep me from giving it five stars.

The story itself is much like a real-life Indiana Jones tale. Although you pretty much know the plot coming into the movie, it really is an interesting story and there is just enough suspense and witty dialogue to keep one's attention from scene to scene. As you can find out about in the featurette, George Cloney, as producer of the movie, really took his time in post production to get things right and seems to be a stickler for detail. This is definitely not an action movie littered with continuity errors, ridiculous CGI special effects or scenes that should have been left on the cutting room floor. It's definitely well worth the investment of your time to watch this movie.

Monuments Men gives you a great feel for the evil of the looting and what could have been lost to posterity.  The movie's main failing is that there are so many characters in the acting ensemble that the story is sort of diffused.  The acting is generally very good, but the drama would have been strengthened if only a few characters had been focused on. I agree with a sentiment which I read someplace that Monuments Men would have lent itself better to a TV miniseries than a 2 hour movie.

5809926,2,B00DHJT4DU,"George Clooney had great, rich material to work with but squandered it.  Movie was disjointed, poorly scripted, and lacked passion in the actors except for Cate Blanchett.  It does give you an overall idea of the magnitude of Hitler's theft of the great works of art, and anything else of value he could get his hands on across Europe.  I had wanted to see this movie for some time because of the subject and the number of great actors, but was very disappointed.",1404777600,,463,4.554216867469879

5809928,2,B00DHJT4DU,The movie was informative but was hard to follow the accounts of the characters. That is why I didn't care a lot for the movie and feel it was over rated about how good it was supposed to be. I also think that possibly other actors should have played the characters.,1404777600,,266,4.235294117647059

It's an important story and should have been treated as such but it wasn't.  It was just weird.  Some moments were touching but it was rushed and those smirks from Clooney and Murray, it was just annoyingly weird. Art is so important to me and I just didn't feel it was given it's due.

5810146,1,B00DHJT4DU,"Clooney. Damon. Blanchett. War. Nazis. Put it all together and you have a great film. Or so you would think.
It takes a lot for me to turn off a film but this movie was just torture. With only about 35 minutes left, I couldn't stand it and gave up.
Where to start: There were too many characters and with each one sent off on a different missions you end up not feeling for any of them.
The characters were stereotypicalno depth: Clooney was the brains of the organization, Damon the unhappily married man, Blanchett was the French woman who didn't trust Americans, Bill Murray was there for comic relief and John Goodman was there because..well, I have no idea why.
I also really didn't care if the Monument Men succeeded in their mission or not. The actors themselves seemed totally bored, just delivering their lines with no emotion.
The film was very predictable.
Also, there is no indication of the violence and brutality of the Nazis. If you didn't know better (and many young people dont), Hitler was simply nothing more than some dude who wanted to take over the world to collect art.
One scene was so awful I actually laughed. One of the Monument Men gets surprised by a Nazi who pulls on a gun on him. He is without a weapon and about to be shot by the German. Then, Bill Murray just happens to walk over and diffuses the situation byhanding the Nazi a cigarette!!! The Nazi takes the cigarette, smiles, makes a comment about John Wayne (who was largely an unknown in 1943) and lets the Americans go

The star-studded cast and its acting are brilliant, but the questions that this movie raises about the function and value of art to a culture, a people, and individual human beings are even more important. Unfortunately, many in the present-day cinema audience fail to appreciate the kind of art--art of past or distant cultures--that this team of men took upon themselves to protect, recover, and preserve, They will also fail to recognize Claire Simone's (Cate Blanchett's) inventory of the stolen art as what it was, an act of love for humanity and posterity. As a result they will also fail to ponder the questions raised. This movie will be lost on such people.  A good art history class prior to viewing may be in order for these present-day viewers.

5810310,3,B00DHJT4DU,"There are two groups of people that might want to see this kind of ""World War II"" movie.  One group would be fans of Matt Damon, or George Clooney, or Bill Murray that want an homogenized, wide range of emotion, ""good"", reasonable pleasant show typical of the past work issued by these good actors.  The second group of potential viewers seek a hard-core, battleground, historically correct ""Private Ryan""- type of war presentation that bears repeated viewings.  This DVD falls somewhere in the middle of these two groups of expectations, leaving the viewer a bit disillusioned.

I adored the scenes with him in this show, and when he says, ""Heil Hitler"" at one point; it becomes the most memorable moment to me.  Damon is pretty much always good as well.  Elizabeth Tudor, (Cate Blanchard) is always extremely good, and really improves this story with her abilities, and performance.

If you favor WWII movies, I would say to rent this, and enjoy it.  But don't expect Matt Damon to declare that he wants to ""die with the only brothers he still has.""  It ain't that kind of war movie.",1404172800,,2941,6.580310880829016

5810345,4,B00DHJT4DU,"I like this movie a lot, but then I've been interested for years in the work of Rose Valland and the rescue of, essentially, European art history from Hitler, his madness, and his thousands of Nazi pawns.  The movie attempts to take the many stories of the few Monuments Men who served in Europe, as recorded in the 2009 book of the same name by Robert M. Edsel and Bret Witter, and meld them into one cohesive story.  Scriptwriters George Clooney and Grant Heslov do this by creating new characters based on amalgams of the real-life Monuments Men, and shuffling the war experiences around between them.  Because the book is long and rich in detail, and because so many of those details were so interesting that it would be unthinkable to omit them, the movie feels jam-packed, with each of the incidents getting less time than is usual for a drama.  It is this ""rushed"" feeling that makes me give the film 4 stars instead of 5 (I'd give it 4-1/2 if it were possible).  But it works overall, not least because of the extraordinary cast, and the brilliant set design.  It was entirely believable that the film was shot in Europe at the end of WWII, and that couldn't have been easy, given how far development has progressed in 70 years.

The cast is top-notch, and almost exclusively male.  Well, OK, most American films are about men, and The Girl (pretty female under 40) is a prize, or an adjunct, or a decoration.  In this movie, most of the parts are male because in the army of the 1940s there were darn few women, hardly any at all in Europe, and of course no one thought of asking a female art historian to risk her life in Europe, even for art.  But this movie also features Cate Blanchett in the role of ""Claire Simonds"" (the Rose Valland counterpart), and does it in a way that abbreviates but does not trivialize the risks taken and Herculean efforts made by Valland in real life under the German occupation.  Well, it inserts an attempt by the fictional Simonds to seduce a married man (played by Matt Damon, so you can see why she would try), but I suppose there's an ordinance in Hollywood that you can't make a movie that doesn't include at least one sexy scene.

George Clooney is himself but underutilized as the head of the unit.  Hugh Bonneville was properly heroic in a British way, though it's hard not to think of Downton Abbey every time I see him.  John Goodman is also himself, and Damon is charming and boyish even as a middle-aged married guy.  The most memorable, though, were Bill Murray and Bob Balaban in a team turn; together they had at least four and possibly five of the best scenes in the movie, and their relationship was more developed than any other in the film (including the relationship between Damon and Blanchett).

Not everyone who likes this movie will want to read the book.  But if you like the movie, and you want to learn more about the uphill battle to save the collective memory of Western civilization, and are not afraid of reading, you will find the book interesting, at some times gripping, and altogether rewarding.",1404086400,,3073,4.548094373865699

Most people I know who had seen it said it was a good historical lesson, but not very entertaining. Although, I was a little more entertained than I thought I would be, I do have to agree. Its more interesting than it is entertaining per-say. What I think I like best about it is the cast. Bill Murray, John Goodman, Matt Damon, George Clooney, Jean Dujardin etc. all worked together so well. They are just these old artist type guys who formed a company to go out into occupied Europe to recover the art that the Nazis stole. Pretty simple plot and the movie are actually pretty simple, but there is a lot more to what actually happened. There is a show on The Military Channel called Secrets of WW2. They had a segment on The Monuments Men, which fleshed out a lot of the details of what happened. If you are a WW2 buff, I think you will enjoy this.",1403654400,,1023,4.278350515463917

What struck me though, was the lesson that much of history and our cultural and other heritage is lost in war.  ""What we don't learn about from our mistakes in history we are doomed to repeat"", to paraphrase something someone wise once said.  How can we learn if we don't have the past to study.  The fact that so much could have been destroyed by a society and army that wanted to destroy what they were about to lose even though it never had belonged to them boggles the mind. Many stories could come out of this movie and the book and I wish they would. To me this movie was like an introduction to the quest to save our heritage.",1403568000,,732,4.126760563380282

The characters are not well-developed and it becomes hard to tell (or care about) who is who. The editing adds to the confusion about what is happening, where, and with whom.  This would have been a far better movie if it had focused on one or two primary characters (perhaps one of the Monument Men and the woman of the French resistance), given us lots more back story and explication of professional identity of those characters, and then placed those characters in the settings of the war.

I am glad that I did because I enjoyed it very much.  It was a bit slow in the beginning and never became hard or gritty war movie.  Monuments Men went to Europe to find and protect art.  They were a group of artists or men connected with the art world in military uniforms.  I am glad that I watched this film because I like the point that Clooney was trying to make.  Hitler and the Nazis were not just trying to kill a lot of people but they also wanted to destroy their civilization and promote a 1000 year German empire.

It was also bothersome, from a nitpicking standpoint, that Clooney's character (I couldn't tell you any of the names of any of the characters - the actors were all basically just playing themselves) seemed to be arguing that the war was basically over already, in the winter of 1944, well prior to a successful D-Day invasion.

I knew the movie was in trouble from the start when it included Bill Murray, an actor I love, but horribly miscast. George Clooney plays the head officer in charge of recovering the art with other roles played by Matt Damon, Cate Blanchett, Bob Balaban, John Goodman, and a few others. Nothing works. It seems that Clooney tried to make something of a buddy movie with unfunny jokes and situations spread throughout. A movie of this sort would have been better taken seriously. The French  resistance woman played by Blanchett was based on a real woman. That story as the focus of the movie would have been fascinating. As it is the movie tries to come off as a serious movie interspersed with moments of comedy or what Clooney apparently thinks is amusing. It fails on all points.  When the so-called big moments of the movie arrive, it's just a huge letdown they're done so poorly. Avoid this movie at all costs.",1403395200,8,1083,4.630208333333333

Simultaneously George Clooney comes out with a true story about art conservators willing to risk their lives to rescue masterpieces from the Nazi's mishandling.  Hollywood never ceases to amaze me when its desert roses instantly bloom in the wake of the latest popular trend.  That said, the film is compelling, features a cast of lovable men, and asks a provocative question.  But perhaps the question ought to be re-phrased: who are they preserving the great art for and is it worth dying for neophytes?  Which brings me to my questions:  Was the Petit Irene really one of the works salvaged?  Did they really find a burned up Picasso?  Or did George throw in some ubiquitous masterpieces so ignorant film goers would 'get' that the art the crew was fighting over was great enough to die for?",1403395200,,926,4.779874213836478

If it weren't for the monuments men and the USA we might have never been able to view this beautiful art ever again.

5810675,1,B00DHJT4DU,"A lot of short stories, basically--  the guys go their own ways, some team up, but the writing is terrible-- good effort-- it's hard to write screenplays.  But it's not good in this film.  The short stories aren't even really complete stories-- more like sentences and paragraphs all brought together under a grander narrative that has little cohesion other than Clooney's narrative, which is super boring.  I like some of George's work-- but he often is just George with period clothes on.  So he is here.  Too many appeals to the soundtrack to add meaning to a film where you don't care a whole lot about the protaganists, there are too many protaganists, and too many different directions.  I couldn't tell what genre this film was trying to be--  period piece drama?  Comedy?  Video poem?  Felt completely disjointed from start to finish, with little substance.  Why were Germans grabbing art?  Why were Russians grabbing art?  What were the Americans' interest?  It isn't really brought together--  it's like seeing Loch Ness-- the depths, the dark intrepid waters, and then wading into a kiddie pool at Disneyland.  Felt very plastic.

Cate Blanchett is always great to watch, and there are a few funny and poignant moments, but in my opinion, there weren't enough of them to justify sitting through this film.  In college I did a fair amount of study on the Degenerate Art movement in Hitler's Germany during his cultural Volk Movement--  this movie could have been SO amazing.  SUCH an interesting subject matter.  Don't bother with this film.",1403308800,,1551,4.930232558139535

5810677,4,B00DHJT4DU,"My wife and I saw this in the theater. I found the story to be entertaining and easy enough to follow along with. There was minimal bad language and killing. They also seemed to be very little special effects. Not exactly the usual type of movie I go to, but the story of the brave men that went into enemy territory in an attempt to rescue/save priceless works of art was engaging enough. Clooney, Damon, Goodman, Murray and Blanchett did great jobs. The Blu-Ray/DVD combo includes some behind the scenes items that some my find interesting. I especially enjoyed the ""in their own words"" special feature.

I ordered a copy of this movie on DVD for my 84 year old mother. She prefers movies without all of the sex, violence and swearing.

What was the score?  Two dead out of seven which made this unit one of the most dangerous units  on either side in the first world war with the exception of the fighter pilots.

What these guys found was simply incredible and what was even more incredible was how much they got back to the Allied side.

Our favorites actors, Clooney, Damon, Murray and Balaban, all did good jobs with their parts.  The story line was fascinating to us as it opened a window on a part of World War history that we were unaware of.  Although a couple of scenes seemed slightly unnecessary, the movie as a whole was interesting and entertaining to us.  The low key interactions between the characters played by Murray and Balaban was an added gem for us.",1403136000,,590,4.679611650485437
5810732,3,B00DHJT4DU,"THE MONUMENTS MEN is getting a three-star review from me because of Amazon's very favorable pricing ($12.99US) for a BD/DVD/Digital product that offers a 4K BD. When the release of George Clooney's latest directorial effort was pushed from  a MAJOR HOLIDAY RELEASE! to the traditional dumping ground of early winter, I was quite disappointed. The early trailers showed a picture with promise. The promise is not delivered in the film.

Based in fact, THE MONUMENTS MEN follows analogs of real-life artists (who work in a range of visual arts) and art historians as they scour Europe in the waning days of WWII, attempting to recover art treasures stolen by German troops. The Nazi high command, seeing the end before them, have ordered the destruction of the artwork, in what can only be explained as an act of spite over the Allied defeat of the ""Thousand Year Reich.""

In a brief prologue, the mission is established and the film then proceeds to spend all of 15-30 seconds recruiting each character into the military. We barely get to see anddigest what these guys do in civilian life before being whisked to England and the start of strictly by-the-numbers storytelling. Two major characters perish. The death of each is telegraphed well before they expire. Matt Damon's character is separated from the troupe for most of the film so he can play out a lifeless flirtation with an art expert (Cate Blanchett) who has posed as a collaborator while working for the French Underground so she can...ah, forget it. It amounts to nothing. The film is further hobbled by Alexandre Desplat's musical score which can best be described as 'aural Xanax.' It belonged in a 50s Disney film set by the ole watering hole in deep summer. Ugh. As with ARGO, the end credits are filled with photos of the actual Monuments Men working in the environments depicted in the film. Whereas ARGO had me on the edge of my seat over an event whose outcome I knew well, THE MONUMENTS MEN had me fighting to keep my eyes open. Perhps Clooney would have better served audiences by making a documentary of the real Monuments Men, a group of heroes well past draft or fighting age who served toenrich our minds, hearts, and souls. This feature is a monument to a missed opportunity.

I end as I began: I wanted a sample of 4K home video and this was exceptionally well-priced. Otherwise, I would have passed and advise you to do likewise.",1403136000,,2409,4.755980861244019

IMO the production values were very good, and the ""look and feel"" of the era was retained.

I found the script and story line a bit cliched and unimaginative, and the casting was a bit strange (I thought Clooney was wooden and uncomfortable in his leadership role, and casting Bill Murray as a serious soldier? REALLY!?).  I never ""got into"" the characters.  Since it was a ""docudrama"", the story line may have been inhibited by an attempt to ""keep it real"".

But it was very much a disappointment due to what seemed like the director not having a good vision of how the story lines needed to flow, and the editor was left to try and make the best of things with the footage they had available to put together.

Very disjointed presentation of the various story lines.  And if you've ever seen comedian Brian Regan's ""One thing led to another..."" bit, this came to mind a couple times during the movie for us.

First the movie took the viewer to one location poring over maps, next scene would show the actors on their way ""somewhere"" to ""do something"". I was never quite clear on those kinds of pesky details. Despite 2 characters being shot & killed, I was emotionally uninvested.

 It felt like Bill Murray & Bob Balaban gave good performances but everyone else just phoned it in. George Cloney was George Clooney, Matt Damon was Matt Damon, Jon Goodman was Jon Goodman & Cate Blanchett was Cate Blanchett... not the people it was their job was to portray. Matt Damon served up his as per usual Lonely-Character-Far-From-Home-Seduced-By-Beautiful-Local he plays in all his roles. Must be in his contract. The writing tried play it cutsie-funny in too many places but without the character development, it came off as just annoying.

As soon as the characters were delineated, I said, ""Those are the two who will be killed,"" and sadly, I was right (I wanted to be wrong). An hour in I kind of shook awake and thought, ""Gosh but this is a long beginning,"" whereupon I realized that we were well into the middle of the muddle.

The surprise is not that Clooney is a good director, for this is something all cineastes know (""Good Night, Good Luck"" being one source of that knowledge).  Rather, the surprise is that this obviously patched together, labor-of-love-school-project-with-my-famous-buddies type of movie that only an above the line star like Clooney can get green lighted, actually works in spite of itself.  Comfortably pulsing with the ""Oceans Eleven""esque, winking lan we have come to expect whenever Clooney and Matt Damon are thrown together, the film carefully balances '40s era wit with a light, yet serious contemplation of the crashing calamity that war visits upon art, culture and history.  Clooney and writing/producing partner Grant Heslov take a page from the Bard's habit of setting contemporary commentary in a historical setting, as one cannot watch this film without the dunning echoes of Donald Rumsfeld's infamous ""Stuff happens"" statement in the back of one's mind.  One part sly political commentary, two parts old school movie matinee, a big part of the fun here is suspending disbelief without losing it too much, as we see the likes of John Goodman, Bob Balaban and most touchingly, Bill Murray decked out in WWII uniforms, and the entire solid cast standing and delivering.  An enjoyable, often wistful and always tasteful exercise that old John Ford himself would recognize, the spark within the gem is the always wonderful Cate Blanchett, twirlingly lovely in great 40s Parisian attire, and balancing all the wry testosterone with aplomb.

5811085,3,B00DHJT4DU,"George Clooney's retelling of an audacious plot by a group of aging art specialists to rescue stolen art from Nazi-occupied Europe is highly entertaining, so long as viewers don't take it too seriously.  With its jaunty theme music (by Alexandre Desplat), devil-may-care theme and tongue-in-cheek humor, it is a movie with its roots in classic World War II dramas such as John Sturges' THE GREAT ESCAPE (1963).  Structurally speaking, THE MONUMENTS MEN is very similar - a group of representatives of assorted nations take on the full might of the Nazi army (as well as some obstructive American and British officers) and manage to achieve their goals through a combination of cunning, luck and sheer brazenness.  THE MONUMENTS MEN is a little propagandist in tone; there is little need, for instance, for a shot at the end of the film showing the American flag, a ""present"" left for the advancing Russian army once the monuments men have rescued some stolen treasure.  Nonetheless the film's theme is highly pertinent in view of the destruction wrought to many irreplaceable art treasures in Iraq and Syria in recent years: one hopes that similar groups will be formed so as to save some of them.  The actors enjoy themselves in their roles, notably Matt Damon as James Granger, an American officer speaking incomprehensible French, and Bob Balaban and Bill Murray as a pair of perpetually warring art specialists.,  Cate Blanchett turns in an agreeable cameo as French spy - with a convincing accent.  Definitely watchable, so long as audiences don't take the subject-matter too seriously.",1402531200,,1591,5.0727969348659006

As a non American I found the references to the Russians ( the bad guys ) and the brief references to the French underground and American back slapping embarrassing.

5811146,1,B00DHJT4DU,"Only Clooney, Damon and the usual suspects in Hollywood can take a real life tale and trample it carelessly underfoot. This movie redefines lackluster and illustrates how one can produce a war movie sans the war. Even OCEAN's 11-12-&13 had more action, suspense and drama than this celluloidal zombie. I gave it a generous 30 minutes of my life and then pulled the plug and let it die, thus putting me out of its agonizing dullness. My friend saw it on a transatlantic flight home from Europe and said it was so bad the passengers were praying they'd would crash rather than watch this through.",1402444800,2,594,4.666666666666667

5811171,1,B00DHJT4DU,"I'd swear this movie was an Oceans 14, 15, etc. script retooled to cover a serious WWII topic with the tone and feel of an Indiana Jones movie.  Monuments Men missed the mark from the beginning and didn't feel right since the plot kept jumping around from a developing situation to a post-solution scene, without showing what happened in between to resolve the issue.  This really is a disaster of a movie that could have been very good had it been done right.  If you read up on the real life monuments men, you will realize this movie is only a caricature of them.

Visually, they had all the high quality WWII clothing and props you see in movies since Savings Private Ryan and Band of Brothers, but the storyline and directing are entirely misplaced.  The actors are all fine and have their own strengths, but they seem uninspired and would probably be just as entertaining to watch while they eat their lunch.  The way the story was played so lightheartedly and with a comedic undertone (but not really that funny), it ruins what could have been a great movie on a serious topic.

Here is a spoiler that kind of sums up my disappointment.  It goes something like this... At one point in the movie the Monuments Men are all in a cave where they have just found lots of the elusive stolen art after about three minutes of searching, but all the US soldiers have just left the area after having refused to help the Monuments Men in their quest.  The US Army is trying to clear out before the fast advancing Russians claim the cave (and its art) since it is in their territory, and the Red Army is already within sight of the cave before all this starts.  Keep in mind this is a lot of art, something equivalent to a warehouse full of various sizes and weights.  Cut to next scene, and suddenly there is a huge US Army convoy with all this art having been magically loaded on trucks that previously did not exist and being driven by unknown soldiers (since they and their trucks all left earlier), and racing away from the fast moving Russians that still haven't found their way to the cave they had within sight before all this happened.

Monuments Men is marketed as a WWII movie in keeping with Savings Private Ryan and Band of Brothers, but in reality it is more like some crazy dream that Danny Ocean had one night...",1402358400,,2323,4.465721040189125

5811184,2,B00DHJT4DU,"I had hoped for SO very much for this movie. And I was disappointed on nearly every point I could be disappointed on. It's the worst version of a Ocean's 11 meets Pearl Harbor meets 8th grade drama class script writing.

This was a movie so utterly confused, so vastly void of soul, so lacking connection to its source material, it's hard to understand how it was released in the form it is. There is no real plot... there's a rough concept that never fully gels. It's some of the worst writing I've seen in a movie in my lifetime. (Which is particularly sad, given the rich source it spawned from). It's effectively a randomized collection of marginally amusing, although never actually entertaining vignettes, loosely stitched together by nothing more than the fact that they're in the same movie. There is zero story arc, and even less dramatic tension. But hey, Clooney and Damon smile cutely throughout, so that makes it all OK, right?

It's an important story, with far reaching implications in how we humans consider and protect our human experience.

It's flat out tragic to see how the makers handled this subject. I love a great WWII movie, so I suffered through this movie until the end. But I don't advise you do the same.

I believe that it could have neem protrayed in a better manner. To me the movie was rushed and paused at points.

It's a weak version of Inglorious Bastards or a strong version of Hogan's Heroes. In fact, the music seemed to be pluck directly from the Hogan's Heroes show.

Feels like its just a throwback for Clooney and his buddies to have some fun with, nothing to be taken with much credibility really. Now the story had potential but it deserved more...exciting scenes and performances. This movie is just boring. I'm pretty big on history and of course WWII is the single worst war ever but it's such a tired topic. When you bring something new to the table like the story presented here which is apparently true events, you have to do something with it and make it enjoyable to watch.",1402185600,,610,4.504504504504505

Better to do that than judge it as something the director and writers never intended it to be. This is a film based on true historical events and reminds us once again the level of human depravity Nazi Germany sunk to. Hitler stole life and robbed dignity from fellow human beings and then had the audacity to steal an entire cultures Art and Heritage. The brave men and women who sacrificed all to recover and restore these priceless works of art to their rightful place are deserving of honor. if history matters to viewer, this is a film for you. It was time well spent to learn how a few brave individuals sacrificed so much so that they could retrieve priceless Historical Art that, thanks to them, have been enjoyed and appreciated by millions the world over.

5811338,4,B00DHJT4DU,"I had looked forward to seeing this movie but afterward, I felt something was missing. It was entertaining and--being fact-based--thought-provoking as one thought of all the buildings and art treasures unsaved and destroyed, both by war and the Nazis.  Nevertheless, something just wasn't there.

Perhaps it was the idea that this was a war movie in which there was little combat showed. Two of the group are killed but it's done almost undramatically.  I just can't put my finger on it but it lacked something.

On the plus side, the acting is good. Unfortunately, everything comes out as just a little two-dimensional.",1402185600,,620,5.049019607843137

I don't know how realistic the filming was--it was a complicated mission, no doubt, but it tells a story and gives honor to these men for their sacrifices to save the art treasures that still mean so much to society.  It is credit to our country for our generosity in helping others which is still true today.

5811341,3,B00DHJT4DU,"An okay movie for as uneven as it was.  Definitely not ""Saving Private Ryan"".  The basic training for the MM was not believable at  all and instead of being funny just belittled true basic training.  It seemed as if the script writer or the director couldn't decide if this was going to be  a comedy or a drama.  Although there can be humor in drama it didn't  work here.  More tension between Nazis and the French secretary character could have been a factor in creating some true tension;  but hooray for a soldier who could be loyal to his wife!

Too many so-called stars and nearly nothing to be done with them. A great big enemy and not any viable tension, just a good bit of bad behavior.",1402185600,,694,4.3515625

I would not recommend anyone torturing themselves with this movie. We watched it to end and nothing ever really happened.",1402185600,,424,4.64

Unless one has previously read the book or watched Rape of Europa, it will be difficult to understand the 'mission' of this group.  Many of the scenes depicted trivial incidents--probably to give the star-studded cast some camera time.  The movie needed to spend more time on the history of this mission.

I had read about all the art taken in the war but to actually see how much and the lengths to which it was hidden was an eye opener. Who ever thinks about that when men are dying?  It would have been awful had all the art were not recovered and ended up in Nazi hands.

It was an interesting true story of courageous men saving priceless artwork that little pipsqueak dictator wanted for his own thousand year reign of the Reich in Europe and the world, but this one hour and 59 minute story dragged badly.  I also found the camerawork and lighting poor at times and it was hard to focus in night scenes to see which actors were in the scene. Cate Blanchett was mediocre and a lesser known actress could have handled the part easily.  Frankly, it's one of George Clooney's lesser works and I don't really think that they was anything that either he or the other actors or writers could have made better.  One could see some of the special effects, like CGI, which I actually liked and found clever.  I did enjoy learning about the Michelangelo's ""Madonna of Bruges"" (something of a companion piece to the more famous Pieta) and the history of how the Germans hid the art treasures in various mines.

They're flat and dull.  All of the action in the movie takes place with other characters between scenes...so you don't actually see any of the action.  There's no point in the movie were you care at all for the Monuments men.  They're out to rescue stolen art, which we never see stolen...and we learn nothing about the art itself...save for a piece or two.  And all of the actual rescuing, as mentioned, happens off screen.  It's waste of a good cast...whom weren't even given good lines.  They say nothing moving, nothing inspirational, nothing worth quoting.

Well for one thing, too much George Clooney (I know some of you ladies think this is impossible, but how many speeches can we take?).  To many scenes where the viewer was left scratching his head and saying, ""What just happened?""  The guard duty scene which was tense and could have been dispatched with a little humor, but the scene ended with everyone walking away without an explanation why.

Another scene was the end when the Russians were advancing.  They were within earshot of our heroes, but it took them forever (too long for them) to get to the scene of the action, and our heroes were long gone.  Why the delay?

They discover a lot of stolen art in a private home where they were invited to dinner.  What happened?  The end of the scene shows them just driving away.  Did I miss something.  I don't have the patience to watch this dog again.

While the pace of the movie is a little slower than the urgency of the mission should have dictated, it does highlight a little known portion of the war effort by the Allied Forces. It also reminds us of the extent of the atrocities of Hitler's regime.

The movie doesn't flesh out most of the people involved in this recovery group very well. The two most mentioned characters are more defined, those being George Clooney and Matt Damon.

Clooney & Damon lend star power and credibility to their roles. It is difficult to believe all the purloined artwork was eventually returned to the original owners, esp when you consider modern day art ""heists"", such as the Dr. Barnes debacle, but the movie details the return of the art, and it is impressive.

Theres something almost refreshingly old-fashioned about The Monuments Men, one of those Very Important Pictures that Hollywood used to produce with such abundance in its heyday. Its one of those World War II pictures in which a motley group of strangers is recruited by the United States Army to carry out a mission behind enemy lines. Dubbed the Monuments Men, this group of art experts was assigned the task of rescuing some of the worlds greatest art masterpieces from the grasping hands of the Nazis who were busily absconding with the works with the intention of displaying them in a museum of their own after the war.

Lt. Frank Stokes, who spearheaded the mission, is portrayed by George Clooney, while the men he recruits are played by Matt Damon, Bill Murray, John Goodman, Jean Dujardin, Bib Balaban, Dimitri Leonidas and Hugh Bonneville (Downton Abbey). Cate Blanchett co-stars as a curator who is also a Resistance fighter working for the French Underground, and who is initially suspicious of the Monuments Mens motives for rounding up the treasures.

The movie is interesting enough as an unusual slice of history, I suppose, but the screenplay by Clooney and Grant Heslov, based on the book by Robert M. Edsel, never finds a way to make this true life tale come alive as drama. The characters are dull and under-developed, and, as a consequence, we find ourselves strangely uninterested in their back stories and unmoved by their fates. There is also way too much emphasis placed on the comical and the sentimental, and the movie comes replete with a gratingly frivolous score that seems woefully inappropriate to the subject at hand.

Despite the all-star cast, the movie is weighed down by over-earnest acting, with Murray and Balaban seemingly on hand mainly for the comic relief they provide.

Clooney has directed the film with hollow competence, and theres some discussion about whether or not lives should be risked for the sake of inanimate objects, no matter how valuable, but its hard to make anything particularly memorable out of a story where the artwork has more personality than the players.",1401580800,,2129,5.002824858757062

George Clooney and company go undercover to save art from Hitler. Based on a true story.

What did I think?

Even Clooneys fabled charm cant save this muddled dud of a movie. For a film about art there were surprisingly few artworks on display. Why they're so valuable is never fleshed out, either. This could be subtlety if it weren't for Clooneys adolescent speeches about the importance of culture. Sorry George, but I sided with the infuriated military men: would you want to explain to a mother that her son died for a panting?

We are left with a group of beloved actors romping through an unfunny homage to classic WWII movies.

You have George Clooney plotting difficult mission, gathering up members of his team in zany way and the montage of prework for the mission  while this might be historically accurate, it totally took me out of being interested and just have me looking for the next comparison I could make.

No justice was done depicting an honorable effort at the end of WWII that did indeed take place. For example, the scene in Cate Blanchette's apartment in Paris toward the end of the film (no spoiler alert 'cause it's a true story!):  She behaved totally out of character, which made her look ridiculous, which this proud and serious character was not intended to appear! For years as a prim and serious curator for a gallery in Paris during the Occupation, while under the nose of a German Supervisor she creates a clever system which will assist precious art to be return to the rightful owners/collectors/galleries after the Germans abscond and hide it.  She's smarter than most, carries herself with poise, purpose, dignity and a chip on her shoulder, yet after Matt Damon as American Officer comes to Paris at the end of the war and requests her Curator's information, she becomes a vixen (1940's Parisian style)and invites this man she barely knows to her Paris apt for wine and dinner and(desired by her)sex, freely hands over and explains the keys to her clever and previously well hidden system,  ""Because it's Parissssssssss!!"" yuck.

1. Certain types of movies, especially docudramas, should not be cast with well known, famous names. Their personalities detract from what were common, everyday down-to-earth people. The actors seemed more like caricatures of themselves.
2. If there was a war going on you would never know it. Seemed more like a tour of famous art collections in Hollywood.
3. The dialogue not only seemed misplaced but had that Hollywood writer speak to it; overeducated, over articulated Beverly Hills cleanliness.
4. Speaking of cleanliness did you see any dents, scratches on the vehicles let along dust? Even the uniforms had that freshly manicured look. Why is that important? Attention to detail is one indicator of authenticity.
5. Most importantly I couldn't get any emotional attachment to anything including that most important goal of saving works of art. They could have been saving truckloads of McDonald's burgers and I wouldn't have known any differently.",1401408000,31,984,5.267515923566879

I am not a fan of humor, nudity, language, etc., that is inserted out of context. Several times my heart felt the impact of what was happening.

The film is really a WWII-remake of ""Ocean's 11,"" but without any comedy, urgency, action, suspense or stakes. You keep watching the movie, waiting for something to happen, and then it ends. There are so many things this should've been: tense heist caper, rollicking war-action story, zany screwball comedy, a soaring and contemplative drama... Yet all are squandered as the actors simply relay exposition to each other in scene after scene.

The film's European locations and set design are nice, and just looking at legends like Bill Murray and John Goodman provides some amount of solace too.

5811868,3,B00DHJT4DU,"The Monuments Men 
Some films are about characters and the actions that happen to them or the actions they cause to happen.  Other films are about actions and the characters that cause them or upon whom the action is directed.  Thus MASH was about the men and women who ran a battlefield hospital and Full Metal Jacket was about the effect of the Vietnam War on every human it touched.  Both were excellent films.  Its rare to find a film that has both fully developed characters playing against some significant action.  Godzilla falls into this trap  great action but one dimensional characters.

One would expect, then that the Monuments Men would be about the men who saved the art of Western Civilization.  Youd be wrong.  One would also expect if you take all our favorite male actors and put them in a film you could have a really great film.  Again youd be wrong.  Dont get me wrong, I really enjoyed the Monuments Men.  Im just saying its not a very good film and there is no theory of film making in which a bad film cannot be an entertaining film.  Sometimes film should be just simple entertainment and in that this succeeds nicely.

I got the feeling that the writers meeting went something like this:  A scene where the priests are taking down the altar fresco.  A scene where the French admins spat in the wine glass of the German officer before serving him wine.  A boot camp scene where they make John Goodman do an obstacle course.  And after they got a bunch of scenes thought up and on paper they got a screenwriter to sew all the pieces together into a film.  So what Im saying is that the cast is excellent, the sets and costume perfectly period, though the musical score uninspired the lighting superb.  The script just wasn't better than the sum of its scenes and the direction seemed to be lacking.  And its a shame because the director, George Clooney, is one of Americas favorite human beings.  But I almost got the feeling this was, for him a love story, a very personal story somehow, and that means he may have been too much in love with the idea of this film than the film itself.
One scene lifted straight out of Indian Jones and National Treasure is the now clich scene where they're looking for treasure, enter a dark mine, turn on a light and voila gold as far as the eye can see.  That was Hitlers gold.  If you were curious as to whatever happened to Hitlers gold you would be disappointed.  Another room contained barrels full of gold nuggets.  They were the dental fillings of dead Jews.  It wouldnt have taken much to tell us what happened to all that gold and it would have made the movie just a wee tighter.  But this film is chock full of missed opportunities like that and yet it was still a truly entertaining work because each of the pieces was well thought out.

There was just nothing really holding it all together.  As such the film was neither about the monuments or the men that saved it.  That doesnt make it any less enjoyable.  And since it does reveal a bit of history of which most Americans aren't aware they should be proud of, its got great value by virtue of that alone.  Its just not a very good movie.

Damon still projects his persona best when he's in break-neck shoot 'em up contemporary action flicks, and he's very good at that.

The story is colossal, Hitler almost succeeded in causing permanent damage to European Civilization and petty narrow minded men almost let it happen.  Kudos to the real monuments men, but this film does not do them justice.  Not a bad subject at all for a film but the emotion is flat.  You ought to see the movie to see what almost happened to the soul of Western Civilization. What cultural damage was done was bad enough, but it could have been far worse.

5811975,3,B00DHJT4DU,"Although Monuments Men is a WWII film based on real events, there's definitely a lot of artistic liberties taken.  That said, it details a part of history that often gets overlooked, so that in and of itself made it a worthwhile watch. In short, Clooney's character George Stout is a museum curator in New York who is asked by the President to put together a team of art experts (the title's Monuments Men), who are to travel to Europe and rescue stolen art before it can be destroyed by the Nazis. The characters are fictionalized versions, but the premise is based on fact.

Acting-wise, there's a lot of monologues by Clooney's character, George Stout, which are probably the most memorable lines in the film.  Stout does a lot of proselytizing on the importance of art, but the speeches (particularly those towards the beginning of the film) felt a little forced and not quite earned, as it slowed the pace and didn't give the action and drama enough time to build.  The film's tone doesn't seem quite as bleak and serious as a film about WWII should, and at times felt too light--I wondered if this was intentional, as it made me as a viewer feel uncomfortable that a WWII film didn't feel uncomfortable enough.  Clooney's ""Monuments Men"" is a WWII film sort of in the same vein as Inglorious Basterds at least in its tone, but doesn't quite accomplish the storytelling Tarantino was able to pull off.  Partly at fault was the music, which was very upbeat.  But there are plenty of tragedies in the film, both on the small and large scale, that brought viewers back to the reality of what occurred.  As another side note, Cate Blanchett plays a French art expert who helps out the Monuments Men--Matt Damon's character in particular-- and also has a romance with him as well.  Blanchett's onscreen presence is commanding, but she struggles with the French accent throughout the film which was hard to get over.

My main qualm with the film was that the plot skips around a lot, and it was difficult to really follow what was happening; it sort of played out as a series of scenes that didn't quite add up to a coherent story, although it was attempted. The lack of continuity made it hard to build the tension and the characters fully, but the excellent cast did their best and kept the film entertaining.",1401235200,3,2310,4.639705882352941

The story as written for the movie is disjointed with scenes in the movie that don't even make sense as to why they're there.  The scene that goes on for several minutes with the frightened German soldier who has two of the Monuments Men at rifle point is only one example.  It serves no purpose.  The relationship of mistrust between the Matt Damon and Kate Blanchett characters is poorly written, badly acted and unbelievable.
The acting is awful.  George Clooney can't deliver a simple line without sounding like he's giving a speech, Bill Murray's part is disruptive to any flow to a scene and John Goodman is simply used in this film like a commodity because we ""like the big guy"".
I'm not a hard guy to please when it comes to movies, but the only thing ""monumental"" about this one is how it fails on all levels.",1401235200,18,901,4.50920245398773

There aren't many movies today in which marriage and family are honored, human life is held up with dignity, and where western & Christian culture is not vilified. This movie is not about saving ""art"" for the sake of ""art"" -- it is about saving what we hold dear and what makes us who we are as a people: Our history, our stories, our culture.

About the PG-13 warning about smoking and swearing; neither are attractive, yet in our politically correct world, we too easily avoid what was culturally the norm to avoid offending our senses. My kids get it because we talk to them about cultural norms. They know first hand that if we avoided people who smoke or swear, we'd have to avoid family and neighbors which would make it difficult to love and witness to them.

It depends on your perspective.  It really resonated with me.  Wars are fought to eliminate tyranny, it's true, but they are also fought to preserve a heritage.  I can't put it into words as well as they do in the movie.

I think the pacing and the pairing off of the men in the group depicts how the real soldiers must have felt---unsure, scared, and disconnected. Plus, they have to find art using their own professional contacts and rumors. Remember, this is the mid-1940's, no internet, no satellites...the story of these men recovering the art with only half-hearted support by the U.S. government is amazing.

Having done some post research only made things worse in realizing that historical fact, while sometimes present was at best an afterthought in the construction of this plot. Instead, artificially conjured intrigue that often seems ""over the top,"" is employed. That having been said, as for myself personally; put Cate Blanchett in a movie and I'm there. In most cases the same would apply for Matt Damon. George Clooney (not a personal favorite) though, provides the top performance here in a pool of lackluster collaborations. A little light comedy provided by the likes of Bill Murray and John Goodman is an additional plus. All told though, it gives you a sense of that past desperate war and the complexity of alliances and personal relationships given all of the prejudices and persecutions that were present.

It is based on a true and under told story of a group of men during WWII that in the midst of all the horror that it was, understood the importance of saving some of our culture's cornerstones while getting them back from the most murderous regime we have direct knowledge of.

Could it have been a better movie? Yes, though entertaining (really good cast) it left you wanting more. I applaud those, especially Clooney for bringing this group of volunteers story to more of the public who still underappreciates this victory for the allies.

The scene in which ""Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas"" is sung is extremely touching and moving.

If you want to watch another great movie on the subject of the dispicable Nazis attempting to steal art during WWII, watch The Train, starring Burt Lancaster.

5812277,2,B00DHJT4DU,"This movie is proof that good actors do not make a good movie.  This movie was extremely weak on story.  The characters were hastily introduced in a montage sequence and there was very little if any character development.  George Clooney's character gives a couple of what are supposed to be rousing speeches about saving art that fell flat with me.  While there was some humor in the film, the comic relief was too often offset by what seemed like forced idealism over saving artistic work.

5812279,5,B00DHJT4DU,"The Monuments Men is based on a true story, though the screenplay has veered off in terms of authenticity. Its a tale of rescue  not of human beings, but of treasure. Adolf Hitler, an art fancier, had dreams of establishing the Fuhrer Museum, a massive structure intended to exhibit art masterpieces stolen from museums and private collectors. The war is winding down, and there is danger that these masterpieces, scattered to various locations in Europe, will be either destroyed as the Allied invasion intensifies or lost forever. Intelligence has discovered that Hitler will order the destruction of this art if Germanys defeat is inevitable.

A group of art historians, museum curators and professors, most well beyond fighting age, is assigned to locate these works and make sure they are protected and returned to their rightful owners. Under the leadership of Frank Stokes (George Clooney), the team arrives in Europe and the members spread out to track down various leads.

James Granger (Matt Damon) heads for Paris, where he looks up the imprisoned Claire Simon (Cate Blanchett), believed to be a Nazi collaborator. She is suspicious of Grangers motives, fearing the art will never be returned. The other team members (Bill Murray, Hugh Bonneville, John Goodman, Jean Dujardin, Bob Balaban) pursue leads that take them to Belgium and within Germany itself, where battles are still raging. Sam Epstein (Dimitri Leonidas), an enlisted soldier who speaks German, joins them as translator.

Though The Monuments Men is a decent movie, it fails to come together on a number of levels. The original art task force consisted of 350 people from several nations, which makes sense considering the scope of the task. Films traditionally take dramatic license, but believing that six men could manage this massive undertaking is a stretch.

The tone, too, is odd. There are humorous bits sprinkled throughout, but they seem out of place because of serious life-death issues and an underlying gravitas that director Clooney brings to the picture. A speech given by his character hammers home the importance of preserving art as the history of a people.

Star power is in abundance, but none of the actors except Ms. Blanchett truly shines. Hers is a well written role, and we understand her dedication to the art, her hatred of the Nazis, and her suspicion of the art rescuers. Clooney attempts to give each of the male leads a good scene or two, but never properly exploits them.

The picture has an authentic look and feel, with the assorted military equipment, uniforms, weapons, and even a few limited battle scenes, but this is all window dressing that cant mask the movies flaws.

The film is reminiscent of such 1960s war pictures as Guns of Navarone, The Dirty Dozen, and The Great Escape, in which a small group of men must overcome overwhelming odds to accomplish a near-impossible task. With less emphasis on action and more on detective work as time runs out, The Monuments Men never achieves the excitement of a war movie, and makes ferreting out the rare masterpieces seem methodical but unimaginative.

Rated PG-13, The Monuments Men tells a story not generally known and raises the question of whether human life should be sacrificed to locate and save art, however priceless. The films point of view is that it is essential.",1401062400,,3339,5.023508137432188
5812280,2,B00DHJT4DU,"If you read the book, do not bother with the movie. In the book the real life Monument's Men were split up all over Europe with little resources other than their wits. They were never altogether in one place as a self-contained unit. I realize director's need poetic license, but if Clooney couldn't tell the story right, it should never have been told at all. Finally all the actors mailed it in and were basically playing themselves....Bill Murray the snarky wise ass, John Goodman the miscast buffoon, Clooney got all the sanctimonious lines and Damon just stood around being Damon.

Here is THE PROBLEM - The Monuments Men is a 2014 American-German war film directed by George Clooney, written and produced by Clooney and Grant Heslov, and starring Clooney. In other words it was a movie about George Clooney, written for George Clooney and directed for George Clooney. BTW somebody needs to tell George Clooney he's not Clark Gable so it would be nice if he would stop imitating him. And never to miss a opportunity to dump his liberal Hollywood politics on us American peons, he manages to zing one in now and again.

The hams - George Clooney, Matt Damon,  Bill Murray, John Goodman, Jean Dujardin, Hugh Bonneville, Cate Blanchett  - in all fairness to Hugh Bonneville he was actually acting but he gets bumped off and then we were left with a cast who was confused into thinking this was a comedy.

This movie should have been really great and it would have been had it not been so tongue in cheek, had each actor not played to each other instead of to the audience.

They have seen the art in museums but now they also know how Hitler tried to steal it and then how much of it was recovered. Seeing them sift through the gold fillings pulled from the Jewish victims of the Nazis also brings to the surface the horror inflicted on the World by the Nazis which is something we can never forget.  The actors did a great job and the vehicles, weapons and uniforms were well done too for those of us sticklers for originality.  Being retired from the USAF and having deployed twice to war zones it also lets my kids see a little of what it's all about.  Today we face the same state sponsored threats to art and the desecration of religious art site like the obliteration of the giant Buddhas of Bamiyan in Afghanistan.

2. Atrociously comical representation of Germans, including the SS. Check (If you were wondering what happened to the NAZI from Indian Jones who melted when the Arc was opened, he is back, except bolder and shorter)
3. The usual tired and boring American imperialistic and visceral references to country, flag, apple pie, baseball, dying for a cause, blah blah blah. (Not too bad for a country that didn't even join the party until 41 and no serious combat until 42) Check
4. The tired and tested French representation as a caricature: Check (best quote: ""If it wasn't for us, you'd be talking German"" says Matt Damon to the French damsel. She should have replied ""Yes and if it wasn't for us, you'd have the Union Jack on your flag.""
5. Thousands of useless extras dressed haphazardly in Uniform walking back and forth aimlessly, clearly even bored with the movie while it was being made: Check
6. The token allies who get killed in the movie and the American heroes are left unscathed: Check (How come the British and French dudes always get it first?)
7. Painfully one dimensional representation of Allied leaders, and an awful rendition of Hitler: Check. Really, who did they hire to do makeup on this movie?
8. The mandatory Hollywood ""Jewish"" character insertion and references to Holocaust throughout the movie whether it had any bearing on the topic or not: Check
9. The blond blue eyed damsel in distress risking life to fight fearlessly against the NAZIS, yet like all liberated good French women loves to throw her body at the Americans at the first possible opportunity when SPAM, Chocolate and Nylons are presented: Check

Really. If you are a run of the mill American JOE, you might like this movie.

5812404,5,B00DHJT4DU,"This movie directed by and starring George Clooney is about protecting art objects from being pilfered or destroyed by the NSDAP towards the end of WWII.

The presentation has a good selection of actors to play the various characters needed to tell the story. The pacing is a bit strange; I would not call it slow as much detail was needed to keep the story from looking like a cardboard documentary. Speaking of the selection of actors, Cate Blanchett was great as Claire Simone, the spitting French art protector.

Shades of Ayn Rand George Clooney makes one or two of those nice long rallying speeches about the virtues of protecting art at any cost. Then he vacillates about the cost after a participant or two has been dispatched.

This is one of those movies that has lots of clues and inferences mixed in to the story so you will need to watch the film a second time to pick up on the nuances that you missed while you were thinking about the ones that you saw.

All in all this movie is everything that you would expect. It's not exceptional but I doubt it could have ever been any better and I can't think of a better director for this presentation than George Clooney.",1400976000,,1178,4.490654205607477

5812448,4,B00DHJT4DU,"This movie was a disappointment, I think, because I already knew about of the story, but not all of it. Also, the character development was poor, so an audience is less engaged.  Still, the historical significance is important enough that it is worth watching just to enlighten yourself about what transpired during WWII beside the the genocide of Jews, the madness of Hitler, getting in bed with the fiend Stalin, etc. I think that this movie is one perspective of the massive effort that went into protecting works of art across war-torn Europe & Italy.

What is less conveyed in the movie is that Hitler fancied himself an artist & studied art.  He despised works by modernists like Picasso and ordered them removed and destroyed. Hildebrand Gurlitt, a real-life art dealer on assignment to the Nazis, was supposed to obtain the works that Hitler wanted destroyed.  He kept them instead & left thousands of these works to his only son, Cornelius, who hoarded them in secret in two apartments in Germany.  In keeping them, it was not proven that the art was purchased since there are few receipts (claimed they burned up). The hoard was discovered & created a worldwide furor. The heirs to Jewish owners have already made claims. Cornelius died recently & willed the entire lot to a museum. The case is ongoing, but underscores the massive task with which the Monuments Men were beset since there were other players involved in hoarding looted art aside from the uniformed Nazi troops.

So while the perspective of this movie is limited to primarily American efforts, there were other forces at play to keep & hoard purloined art & valuables that are and were unknown for decades & may never be known.  This movie depicts the altruistic motives by Roosevelt & the Monuments Men to prevent the scorched earth policy of withdrawing Nazi troops from being implemented. I think the storyline had the potential to deliver a much more engaging film, but it is still an important aspect of history so much so that I recommend watching it solely on that point.",1400889600,2,2054,4.818181818181818

As far as the storyline, I had no idea that Hitler amassed such a monumental collection of the world's masterpieces while conquering Europe. When I initially saw the trailer for the movie, I thought it would be an interesting flick of war intrigue. To my horror, about half way through I kept fiddling with the stop button on my TV wanting to escape.

I cannot put my finger on any one thing as to why this movie doesn't work. Since George Clooney and Matt Damon star in the film, maybe I was hoping for a WWII version of Oceans 11 where the gang steals back valuable artwork from the bad guys. There are great actors, but mediocre performances. Even George Clooney was a dud, like the landmine that barely sparks in one scene.

The film lacks conflict and intrigue. Perhaps it's the script that is dull or poor direction. It jumps from scene to scene. The only thing that did ruffle my feathers were the Germans stealing, stashing, and destroying the masterpieces from great artists. As the war is ending, the team of men who are lovers of art, take on the task of finding, salvaging, and returning the stolen treasures.

Of course, there are undertones of much more being destroyed than art. There is the terrible confiscation of Jewish property, even down to barrels full of gold fillings taken from the mouths of victims. It is a sobering reminder that more than art had been lost during the war, and perhaps we should care about human lives rather than a Rembrandt.

Nevertheless, it is true that our greatest achievements as human beings should be preserved. Hitler wanted to conquer more than land and human lives, he wanted to conquer and own all of the art created by master artists of centuries past. Two men gave up their lives to preserve and reclaim the artwork. The only question left for the audience to ponder is whether the price of a human life is worth the preservation of a masterpiece.",1400889600,,2139,4.5744125326370755

5812495,4,B00DHJT4DU,"Something went wrong in transforming history onto the big screen. Based on a book by Robert M. Edsel and Bret Witter and adapted for the screen by director George Clooney and Grant Heslov, this true story gets all Hallmarky despite the theme and a fine cast. The problem is that the mystery has been removed and in its place are series of actor shots paying homage to the real monuments men of history. As a result we really don't get to know about any of them and the mission becomes a game, a dangerous and courageous at times game, but a game nevertheless.

Based on the premise of Clooney's character Frank Stokes, `You can wipe out an entire generation, you can burn their homes to the ground and somehow they'll still find their way back. But if you destroy their history, you destroy their achievements and it's as if they never existed. That's what Hitler wants and that's exactly what we are fighting for' the film concerns the gathering of a groups of arts oriented men to rescue art masterpieces from Nazi thieves following WW II and return them to their owners. It is based a true story The Monuments Men is `an action drama focusing on an unlikely World War II platoon, tasked by FDR with going into Germany to rescue artistic masterpieces from Nazi thieves and returning them to their rightful owners. It would be an impossible mission: with the art trapped behind enemy lines, and with the German army under orders to destroy everything as the Reich fell, how could these guys - seven museum directors, curators, and art historians, all more familiar with Michelangelo than the M-1 - possibly hope to succeed? But as the Monuments Men, as they were called, found themselves in a race against time to avoid the destruction of 1000 years of culture, they would risk their lives to protect and defend mankind's greatest achievements.' The hoopla from Sony so states.

The cast includes George Clooney, Matt Damon, Bill Murray, John Goodman, Jean Dujardin, Bob Balaban and Hugh Bonneville as the disparate rescue squad. The best performance in the film is Cate Blanchett's well considered role as Clara Simone, the only one who seems to have an original idea in her mind. Dimitri Leonidas impresses in a small but significant role of a Jew who stays in company with the Monuments Men.

He reigns up Matt Damon, Bob Balaban, John Goodman, Bill Murray, Hugh Bonneville and Jean Dujardi, and they are all somehow involved in art history. They all become soldiers in search of German-pilfered paintings and statues. Not many in the armed Forces have an appreciation of art. If it is a choice of killing Germans in a church or saving art in that church, the art loses.

The saving grace in this film is Cate Blanchett. Playing a secretary to the German high rank. She is able to help the group looking for the art and knows where to look for it. A romance with one of the art historian soldiers seems far fetched, but, then, some romance needed to enter the fray. Clooney played his usual sauve debonair self, but it seems to be wearing thin. Maybe he should leave the writing to someone else. This was a difficult film for me, I lost interest 2/3 of the way through.

5812498,3,B00DHJT4DU,I saw this movie on Movies On Demand which was much better mainly because it was larger.

Very frustrating to watch.,1400803200,,272,4.25
5812499,2,B00DHJT4DU,"Monuments Men should have been a blockbuster, but fell pathetically far short.  I so wanted to love this movie, but I found myself cringing five minutes in.  At the end my neck hurt from checking my watch so many times.  A cinematic trainwreck, thanks to a marginal, motley cast (forgive me, Matt Damon) and gossamer plot with far too many liberties taken with historical fact.  I think the men (and/or their memories) engaged in the events that transpired nearly 70 years ago deserve far more respect than to have their story butchered by all manner of Hollywood embellishment.  This doesn't speak well its producers, of for Clloney as a director.  If a project with deep pockets and ""big"" names attached can't take a story like this and sculpt it into an intriguing, gotta-see-more-than-once masterpiece, the viewer is left with no choice but to question the talent and commitment of the filmmakers.

The subject matter - wholesale looting, be it calculated or opportunistic, of priceless art and artifacts by the Nazis spanning the spectrum of disciplines, the subsequent (attempt at) eradication of broad swaths of European cultural record during the final days of the war, and the frantic effort of the Allies to thwart Hitler's destruction and repatriate millions of pieces - is a story that has garnered surprisingly little public attention.  World War 2 is little more than a few chapters in history books (or a few pages on the web) to at least the last few generations born in this country.  The epic saga of recovery and repatriation continues to this day, and is a perfect manifestaion of the idiom ""the truth is stranger than fiction"".  What happened nearly 70 years ago is mind-numbing.  Sadly, Monuments Men did almost nothing to relate the details in a way that either compels the viewer or does justice to the magnitude of the events.

Clooney is usually a decent actor.  I have tremendous respect for the talents of Matt Damon.  Bill Murray did little to move the film forward.  And John Goodman?  Please, be real.  Throw a bowling shirt on him and give him a few slapstick lines in a film with far less cinematic potential.  Sorry Mr. Goodman, you were out of your league.

The story line is disjointed and confusing, the continuity is little more than a fuzzy patchwork that leaves the viewer thirsty for development, and the characters are entirely unsympathetic.  Should be one star, perhaps, but it's Friday before a long holiday weekend and I'm feeling generous.

If you want to see an excellent film (documentary) on the subject - one that will leave you awestruck and inspired to dig deeper - see ""The Rape of Europa"".  The streaming services have it - Netflix, Amazon, etc.",1400803200,4,2700,4.849344978165939

5812541,5,B00DHJT4DU,"I saw this movie in a theater the day it opened, and to this day I can't believe the mixed reviews and the criticisms this film received upon its theatrical release. This is a spectacular film on multiple levels and I also believe it's George Clooney's strongest effort as a director. The strongest scene? When the team encounters the hoard of gold in the Merkers mine. You don't need a degree in Modern European History as I have, to know that much of this gold was taken from those who perished in the Holocaust. Powerful, understated film making on Clooney's part. What's left unsaid is as important as what is shown.

As is the case of any movie that tries to compress a year's history into one hour and 58 minutes, liberties will have been taken with the history. It's inevitable. But it matters little here as the story is well paced and the characters, which seemed to have sufficient development, was widely criticized. If more time was spent developing the characters, the movie easily could have been three hours long and would have made it commercially unviable.

The ensemble cast works perfectly and I felt that Bill Murray especially, was a standout. It was obvious to me that this was a labor of love for all involved.

While I suspect that when Academy Award nominations are announced, this movie will be overlooked, which to me is criminal. Now that it's available on DVD, Blu-Ray and streaming offerings, rent, no buy this movie and add it to your permanent collection.

Based on the a true story of the attempts to rescue all the art that the Germans looted from all the innocent victims in WWII.  The movie has an outstanding cast including  George Clooney, Matt Damon, Cate Blanchett among others.  Blanchett to me was the notable standout as Claire Simone, the museum curator in Paris who kept records of the things the Nazi's took.

The movie does move a bit slowly and mostly avoids any war action throughout most of the movie,  by design I assume.  There are a couple scenes of action but that really isn't the main focus of the movie.  There are also some bits of humor thrown in to break up some of the slow movie parts between the desperate searches for the art.

The true story itself is interesting enough but unfortunately the pacing of the movie makes it hard to keep you interested all the way through as the long stretches of very little going on almost ruin an otherwise great story with great actors.

5812602,4,B00DHJT4DU,"We live in a throw away society, a world where everything is expendable and ready to be tossed aside once we've finished with it. Kids today seem only interested in themselves and what's going on in the present, never caring what happened before they were born. The saddest part of this is the fact that in being this way they never expose themselves to some of the greatest things in the world, everything from classic novels to pieces of art that have survived centuries. With any luck a few of them will watch THE MONUMENTS MEN and consider doing so.

George Clooney stars as Frank Stokes, a military officer in World War II who presents a case to President Roosevelt about the famous works found in museums in Europe. In this presentation he shows Roosevelt famous pieces of art that have gone missing, supposedly taken by Hitler to be put on display when he wins the war in a specially built structure. That is if he doesn't damage them first or if the allies don't damage them while fighting battles from one town to the next. Stokes request is that a special select group of men work to save these pieces of art before they are all destroyed. Given the go ahead, he assembles his team.

The team is small. There aren't that many people qualified or willing to be a part. Each has their own role to play in helping with this seemingly impossible task. Included in the group are James Granger (Matt Damon), Richard Campbell (Bill Murray), Walter Garfield (John Goodman), Jean Claude Clermont (Jean Dujardin), Preston Savitz (Bob Balaban) and Donald Jeffries (Hugh Bonneville). These are the Monuments men, the elite group that sets out to fulfill the task Stokes has set forth. Granger is sent undercover to find out as much information as he can concerning the whereabouts of artwork stolen in France. The rest are split into teams and sent searching for other various artifacts.

Using various methods they accumulate enough knowledge that they discover a pattern used in the transport of these works of art. It appears that each location on the map they point out with the clues presented there are underground mines where the art has been stored, at least in part. As the troops move forward, the team accompanies them in an attempt to fulfill their mission. Placing their lives in danger, not all will come home, but each will play his part in this truly historic mission.

This gives you the basic idea of what the movie is about. What it doesn't do is show the admiration these men had for not just the task at hand but the items they were sent to save. While some might find a Rembrandt of a museum quality piece of artwork in a foreign church boring, these men look upon each with reverence and respect. The military might see their job as unworthy of their efforts but a twist results in them finding more than they bargained for.

Based on the true story of this team the movie offers it all. There is plenty of camaraderie among the team, an affection that develops between them as they move forward. There is the awe that each one inspires with the items they find. There is humor in various moments where things can be light hearted. And there is tragedy as some fall to the enemy.

What makes this movie important though is to consider what it was they actually accomplished. To think that some of these pieces might have disappeared (which some actually did) makes their story one of success where few thought it could happen. That they were able to rescue as much as they did is an amazing feat and one that should be lauded. I found it amazing that it took this long for their story to be told.

The movie offers not just great entertainment but a piece of history that all should be made aware of. It's a film that young people should see to realize that there was a world out there before they were born and that many things they take for granted could simply have not been there if not for the efforts of people like this. Ipads, Ipods and Facebook are all great things but not near as great as what these people saved. It would be nice to know that at least a few people in the world appreciate the work that they did.

It is shocking how bad this movie is.  Utterly slow pacing, nearly no characterization, absolutely no one to care about, forced laughs, boring action scenes.

You'd think that this story would be incredibly novel and thrilling, deep and even emotional; but the movie drags on like a lecture given by someone with alzheimer's.

There are parts that blatantly stand out as ""comedic,"" viewers knowing they are SUPPOSED to be laughing, but nothing funny happens.  Just because Bill Murray rubs a guy's head?  Just because some short guy is now a private?  And the characters poke fun at each other as if they have history, relationships we are not privy to.  Why the heck would that amuse me, if you do not explain beforehand the significance of these characters' relationships!?!

What this movie did well was to put up scenes of WW2.  Given that, they should have had more extras as part of the team (instead or 6 or 7 of 400).  Instead, it felt like we had three teams of two men wandering around war-torn Europe without any sense of urgency.  Most of the danger they faced was due to their sheer incompetence as soldiers.

Perhaps he was trying to do a Band Of Brothers with the book?  The Monuments Men were a select few who were assigned to an heroic effort  to capture the art treasures the Germans stole.  The movie did not pay tribute to what really took place.  Most reviews, from professionals, also gave it a poor rating.",1400630400,6,441,4.253012048192771
5812631,3,B00DHJT4DU,"I found this movie to be very interesting.  It wasn't quite what I expected, but it was interesting nonetheless.  Without knowing a lot about the background of this movie the previews made it seem much different than it really was.  I thought I was going to watch an action-packed drama about how a group of untraditional soldiers (i.e., architects, professors, etc) fought against the Nazis to save some of the worlds most precious art collections.  As it turns out the movie took place nearing the end of the war (while the Germans were in retreat) and was much more mellow and light-humored than I had anticipated.  It didn't make it a bad moviejust not what I had expected.

Positives: it had some funny parts, had a strong cast, was based off true events, and was entertaining.

Negatives: not a great deal of action, the music was a bit much for my taste (it gave it kind of a theme park ride effect), and the tension was lacking (it didn't draw me into the story as much as I would have liked).

Overall I felt that the story was a great one that needed to be told, but I felt that there could have been improvements made to the film to deliver the films message much more effectively.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys war or history films.

People asked if it was worth it.  It was.  Look at all that would have been lost if these few brave men had not taken their tasks seriously...and look at what all extra they found -- teeth, gold boullion, etc.  They had an important job that became even more important.

5812680,3,B00DHJT4DU,"While I think the film was okay, the story behind it is quite important.  The Nazis would have held the culture and the wealth of the conquered for perpetual ransom.  Their arrogance and ignorance was enormous.  They destroyed a huge cache of irreplaceable art, either because they didn't understand it and found it offensive to their twisted ideology or they merely wanted to deprive it to the armies approaching them from all sides.  The cast was credible and turned in believable performances, but for a story of this magnitude, I thought it might have moved the audience a bit more.  It semed that Clooney's character, in the end, had as much trouble convincing the audience as he did convincing the character of FDR of the importance of the mission. The war, in general, was fought to save the best of western culture, including its freedom to choose which art it thought was worthy of saving.  The story of the tremendous loss of the lives of the people who owned that art seemed a dusty artifact when watching the film.  Maybe this was the point . . . the art seemed ultimately to be worth more than the lives of the patrons who owned and protected it.",1400544000,,1159,4.597087378640777

The book was marvelous. I cannot imagine how such an excellent story could be turned into this muddle. Stop already with comic relief and side tracking- this was serious business, the saving of cultural treasures before the Nero order could be carried out.

It was telling that character names were changed.  If I had had a Monuments Men relative and read the script I would have refused to have my heroic relative's name associated.",1400457600,,555,4.701030927835052
5812684,5,B00DHJT4DU,"I loved every second of it for many reasons. It is a lesson in the importance of art. I was quite overwhelmed by the authenticity of time. Many scenes looked like my father's war photos from that time period. There was also a bit of the feel of film of the late forties. The brilliant acting team sealed it. Bill Murray is great. George Clooney seems to be our new Clark Gable. I think that Those who depicted Nazis were very effective. A very well designed film. I viewed in 4K and am glad that I made that investment. (Had to buy rather than rent from Sony). There are so many great movies on the war. Herman Wouk's TV series is the best full telling of the story. You can view it online in High Def. now. I'll view it again for that. The Unknown War made from Soviet footage is hugely valuable. It's narrated by Burt Lancaster. It's in standard def only. I think that Herman Wouk's Caine Mutiny contributes much more to the story of gratitude owed to veterans. All of it is available from Amazon.

The ""Last Metro"" comes to mind as I write. The list is long. ""Inglorious Bastards"" is a beautiful depiction of what should have happened to Nazis. There is a famous Byelorussian artist who depicted a Nazi concentration camp in his paintings. The art emphasizes the beauty of the victims and the nazis are depicted with comic disgust. The artist did magnificent Socialist art including images of the Soviet space program, and his work became religious later in his life. Much of his work was devoted to the Soviet resistance. There is a fine museum in Minsk devoted to Mikhail Savitsky. -His whole story would make a great movie.
I'm pretty sensitive to anti-Soviet comments. The Monuments Men handled that well. They did not dump propaganda on us. We owe all of the Allied veterans our gratitude. They saved the world from fascism. America lost almost half a million, the Soviet Union lost way over 20 million, mostly in their homeland. Approximately 60 million died. Because of De-Nazification of Germany after the war, Germany is now one of the least fascist nations. However, I think we were dreaming in 1945 when we thought fascism was destroyed.

It must be a total dud!""  Particularly not a film such as The Monuments Men, with its dream-team cast of A-list stars and scene-stealing comic character actors, not to mention an interesting true story showing an often filmed conflict (the Second World War) from an unusual perspective (a team of out-of-shape, untrained collectors, historians, and scholars traveling into the line of fire to recover stolen art and protect historic buildings).  After viewing the film, though, I must say:  it is not hard to understand why the studio dodged the extra unforgiving spotlight of a year-end prestige release date because this is an unprecedented disaster which finds a thousand and one ways to fail to realize its vast potential, fail to utilize its ace cast, and otherwise frustrate and bore audiences.

One major problem is its borderline insane shifts in purpose and tone.  A great film can amuse, excite, frighten, and uplift in turn, but no shift here, always signaled by the overbearing score, is completed with grace.  One second it goes for grave tears (the characters find a container overflowing with small pieces of gold, and one among them recognizes them as Jews' gold teeth).  Five seconds later, it is again a pure and farcical caper film:  Ocean's Wartime Eleven, but without any genuine sense of danger, fun, style, or wit.  Another major flaw:  a near total absence of structure.  A few characters go here.  A few characters go there.  Maybe this one slightly bonds with this one.  This story calls out for suspense and wonder, for a sense of propulsion, but the end result is defined by heavy eyelids and so-measured-as-to-be-inert pacing.  None of the actors shine; there is definitely trouble afoot when a film has Bill Murray and John Goodman in the same room, and the pairing results in nothing memorable or even modestly playful.  Either Matt Damon's character or George Clooney's is intended as the driving hero of the piece, but it never becomes completely clear which.  Character development is close to nonexistent beyond brief references to each man's profession and perhaps whether or not he has a family at home.  There is also a self-important and groan inducing cameo in the very last scene which is almost embarrassing to endure considering the low quality of what has come before, but do not even get me started regarding this final spot of indulgent nonsense.

Yet another sin of The Monuments Men:  despite one, two, three, four...I do not know, maybe ten heavy-handed monologues/sermons regarding the importance of protecting art and preserving culture during times of crisis (Art Is the Ultimate Record of Our Very Existence, Damn It!), the film has a curious and notable disinterest in the subject, almost never pausing to truly absorb the glory of a particular painting or sculpture.  The ""monuments"" are the point, or so we are told, yet they are also incidental and presented in such a way as to go in one eye and out the other.",1399852800,13,3132,4.877126654064273

5812804,3,B00DHJT4DU,"I was really looking forward to seeing this. In fact I couldn't wait to see it on DVD so I bought it on Amazon. I figured with actors like Ron Rifkin, George Clooney that it would be a masterpiece of history and fine acting, directing, etc. Instead what you get is an hour and a half of corny jokes, sad attempts to manufacture emotional scenes and anachronisms.

In fact, the movie was almost as anachronistic as ""Flyboys"". At no time did I feel or believe it was the 1940's. No sense of old. Instead one of those movies where you see a bunch of your favorite actors play dress up, and put on costumes. Not a sense of ""being there"" like you got from the HBO Series ""Band of Brothers"". I grew up under these people, and so did Clooney, Murray, Rifkin and Goodman, so they should know better.

An example is the ""Live fire drill"" where Clooney's watching the men in supposedly basic training in a live fire drill. They're crawling in the trench, Goodman stands up while an instructor's firing a carbine over their heads and just walks out, unaware that they're firing live ammo. In reality of course they have signs everywhere warning the soldiers to not raise their heads, that it was a live fire drill. There are other examples but that's one.

There are no great scenes in the movie, no believable battle. The German's are miserably portrayed as ""evil Nazis"", sort of like in Inglorious Bastards, although granted this wasn't quite as bad as that. This wasn't a ""terrible"" movie. And there were moments I found interesting and entertaining. But not many.

If I had to do it over again I'd wait for it to come out as a rental and I would have rented it. I bought it because I assumed with the cast it couldn't possibly be a dud. I assumed wrong.

If you liked movies like ""Flyboys"" and ""Inglorious Bastards"" then you'll like this. Of course you'll probably like a cartoon at that point so that's not saying much. But if you liked ""Band of Brothers"",  and ""Saving Private Ryan"", then you probably aren't going to like this.

Rent it. Don't buy it. Its worth a rent just to see the story unfold as it is based on a true story. But if you buy it, you'll regret it. Like me.

The soundtrack was fantastic as well.
I have been over the years an avid reader concerning WWII history and did not know about the Monuments Men.
Probably the most surprising part is when Kate Blanchett invites Matt Damon to spend the night.  Who knows the last time something like that happened in a hollywood production?  The audience when I attended, anticipated by their comments, the usual, but happily the unusual happened.
Sadly, it seems that the film did not do extremely well at the box office.  Part of that could be the lack of interest of society in the value of art and culture.  Probably sounded boring to many.  The points made about the importance of art and culture in the film represents my opinion.  I hope some will catch the film at their local dollar house and on dvd.

1. The writing
2. Watching older actors go through basic training

But, what really got me was the atmosphere that the movie created.  Excuse the New criticism but the tension really got to me.  The film makers did a great job at making me feel like the mission the characters were on was worth it no matter the cost.  That art was important to the world, and worth saving.  Most of all, the missions time element felt crushing by the end. The Monument Men had to hurry the mission because the Soviets looking for all of the priceless art as well.  The story was predictable but it get 3 stars on the back of how well it was made.  So, buy, or rent, but paying full price on release day is just not worth it.",1397606400,,842,4.180124223602484
5812851,4,B00DHJT4DU,"The film is of course important for the wide popular public who does not know at all anything about that systematic looting of works of arts of any type by the Nazis. The public does not know millions of works of arts are concerned and this operation launched by Roosevelt in 1943 enabled millions of them to be recuperated, maybe not millions but a great, great number. Note Roosevelt knew about art and culture, but it is sure Truman did not know the word, let alone the ""thing.""

The film is important to show that this operation could only succeed if it was American, English and French at once since it was supposed to follow the front starting in Normandy just after D day and prevent the Nazis from doing what Hitler had ordered: destroy everything you can. Leave behind you a devastated and burnt out land. And actually we have a mistake in the film when it pretends the objective of Hitler was to destroy European culture.

In fact the objective was to take possession of all they could and put it up in a Fhrer Museum in Hitler's birth place in Austria. Hitler wanted to alienate the Europeans of their culture and force them to come humble and trembling to this museum to see what once was theirs. That was in fact even more cruel than just destroying it since it was not turning Europeans into deculturalized slaves but into zoo animals coming to see what they used to be. And when they were reduced to zoo animals then it was a lot easier to shoot them point blank but with live ammunition.

But there is also another shortcoming that is in fact ideological. The decision to destroy all those works of art was a final war measure from Hitler, but it became in the film a way not to speak of something else. The fact that millions of works of arts were plainly stolen in a way or another by plain ordinary people, like the neighbors who looted the apartment of a Jewish family that had just been arrested. Ot this Jewish family that survived in France from beginning to end by going from one hiding place to the next and paying their passage with some silverware. And we must not forget the duly paid for SNCF trains to transport everything imaginable from human deported people to treasures or ammunitions and troops.

And it also neglects the fact that a great number of works of art were saved by simple people who recuperated them in due time and hid them away like the tapestries of La Chaise Dieu to bring them back out once the war was finished, or even a long time later like the bronze sculptures of the Quinconces in Bordeaux that only reappeared in the 1980s.

The saving of the Bruges Madonna by Michel Ange and of the Ghent altarpiece just before the arrival of the Russians, is kind of cold war in spirit ahead of history, especially since this salvation was in fact possible because the local German miners had blown up the three entrances of the mine to prevent the Nazis from doing what they intended to do. Here gain the message is fuzzy. Millions of Europeans risked their life to save someone or something that was considered as valuable because the Nazis wanted them. The popular dimension is mostly ignored and reduced to anecdotic little facts, even with Claire who actually did a tremendous work to list the immensity of the spoils. Only this last case is given some prominence, but it was not possible without a very serious organization behind and under this surface.

In other words this film could have been a master piece but it only speaks of masterpieces without being one. Sorry for it. Clooney could have done a lot more and better with a little bit of research.

5812855,4,B00DHJT4DU,"I really like Saving Private Ryan - it is gritty, realistic and makes you feel like you were there, and tells a heck of a WW2 story.  I also really like this movie - it is not gritty particularly, does have a more humoristic approach at times, and tells a heck of a WW2 story.  I honestly don't understand the criticism about this movie.  It feels like a lot of people were either expecting the same thing they've seen over and over with grit, gore, and length, or frankly had a skeptical/cynical attitude from the start and immediately I-phoned in snarky reviews about how the movie didn't entertain them enough.

This movie was not a gore fest, so... it's unrealistic then?  This movie does not have each character sit down, stare at the camera and tell you some long back story that is designed to tug at your heart strings, so... the characters are not developed enough?  There are many characters in many different storylines/missions that sometimes meet back together, as is the case with any ensemble cast movie, so... the movie should have been 3 hours long with a narrator explaining to you what was going on with each scene change?

The point of the movie was about the Nazi threat to the cultural achievements over the past centuries, and how that threat was identified and combated by a group of middle-aged art professionals.  I really liked that for once we didn't have some Tarentino-type decapitations, or intestines sprawled on the ground, and cussing for the sake of cussing.  No shock value kind of stuff, which I suppose maybe made some people bored.  But this is not that kind of movie.  This movie told a valuable story based on a true story, in an older-type way, with men who you felt were leaders who led with courage.  It is another tale out of many, of lesser-known heroes overcoming adversity against Nazis.  This movie is focused more on the overall story of a broad mission like as if looking down at the entire chess board, rather than following just one piece.

Bottom-line: This was an enjoyable movie, and I do feel well-articulated a valuable point about the importance of protecting our cultural achievements in the face of evil who would either highjack that history or destroy it.  I feel like it was well-acted in part because none of the actors seemed like they were there to steal scenes, but rather play their parts more subtly and just respect the history.  You could follow the story just fine contrary to what people have said.  Not the best WW2 movie I've ever seen (thus 4 stars instead of 5), but still a good addition to any WW2 movie collection.",1396483200,113,2595,4.643326039387309

5812858,4,B00DHJT4DU,"This docudrama is based on the true story of the ""Monuments Men"" - the Monuments, Fine Arts and Archives section of the Allies during WWII.

It's a well crafted tale of the courageous activities of a small corp of largely middle aged academics, museum curators, architects and historians who volunteered to find and recover misappropriated artworks.

The story is told in a straightforward yet entertaining fashion, explaining the establishment of the group, then illustrating their activities and their successes.

There are moments of humor, and of sadness.

All of the actors are well cast, and they work together to tell a story which was largely unknown until recently.

The relationship between the Cate Blanchett and Matt Damon characters is particularly poignant.

At the end of the film, historical photographs of their activities are shown with the closing credits.

In some respects, the style of the film reminded me (in a positive way) of WWII docudramas produced in the 1950s, such as ""The Dambusters"" and ""Ice Cold in Alex"", as well as ""The Counterfeit Traitor"". There's a matter of factness about them, as well as an admiration and respect for the courage of ordinary people who are doing extraordinary things.

Well worth watching as an inspiring story of decency (the quest of the Monuments Men was to return the misappropriated works to their true owners), courage (they were doing their work while fighting was taking place around them) and vision (their wish was to retain artworks of importance to culture and civilisation).

It is a fitting tribute to the courage and vision of the Monuments Men, as well as being another example of George Clooney's talent as a film maker (director and co-writer).",1396051200,9,1721,5.074468085106383

The Monuments Men, as they were called, found themselves in a race against time to avoid the destruction of years of culture, risking their own lives to protect mankind's greatest achievements.

5812861,5,B00DHJT4DU,"This film is set circa 1943, during World War II. It describes the formation of an army unit that was created specifically to search for and recover priceless art stolen from the Jewish people by the German soldiers.
  A six man team called the Monuments Men is formed to undertake this mission. The team is led by Frank Stokes into France to begin their search. While in France the unit meets Claire Simone who is a French museum curator. She is being forced against her will to cooperate with Nazi officers like Viktor Stahl to steal priceless works of art.
  At this point in the war the Nazis are being pushed back and on their way out are looting and destroying as much as possible. The Monuments Men are able to uncover the locations of some of some of the art work on their own. They turn to Claire Simone for her assistance which she is initially reluctant to give. With her guidance the Monuments Men are able to uncover a huge cache of stolen art work in a castle and then find a map leading the group to a mine that contained thousands upon thousands of art pieces and more macabre items such as golden teeth pulled from the mouths of Nazi concentration camp victims.
  Another problem is encountered by the Monument's Men  when it is discovered they must compete with the Soviet Army as well in their searches. The Soviet Army assumes that they are entitled to the priceless art work as some sort of war reparations because of their massive number of casualties. In one of the final missions in the film a mine is found in Austria containing great numbers of the stolen pieces of art. The Monuments Men are able to sneak these pieces out right under the noses of the Soviet Army,including the priceless Madonna and Child sculpture by Michelangelo which held significant importance to the group because they lost one of their own in a failed attempt to prevent it from being stolen.

5812864,2,B00DHJT4DU,"The story behind this movie is fascinating. As Hitler tried to consolidate all of the famous works of art across Europe in Germany, a small group, The Monuments Men, was a fantastic mission to read about. The movie failed to live up to that potential. Clooney, both the star of the movie and the director, tries to make this movie Saving Private Ryan while also make this more of a comedy then it should be. In Saving Private Ryan, the conflict for the group of soldiers is whether losing lives of their own man to save one missing one is worth it, and in the Monuments Man the conflict becomes is it worth risking lives to save works of art. The answer the movie gives to that, of course, is yes. It fails to really answer WHY the answer is yes. The first death in the movie, without giving too much away, is someone you barley know in the movie and you don't really care he is dying, which is just awkward. The comedy in the movie is good, but seems out of place for a story about World War II. The acting is done very well with such an all star cast, but some of them are written so thinly that there is no room for growth, namely Claire Simone (Cate Blanchett) is such a thin part that any actress in Hollywood could have played that role. The only role that is of real significance is, of course, George Clooney. Its an entertaining hour and a half of your time, but largely forgettable afterwards.

5812865,3,B00DHJT4DU,"George Clooney regularly uses his clout as one of the most bankable movie stars to write, produce and/or direct more interesting, more challenging projects. This practice has created an impressive group of films that keeps his fans happy and eagerly anticipating his next works.

Well, 'next' is ""The Monuments Men"" about a group of men commissioned o save the world's leading artworks from Hitler's war machine and the dictator's voracious appetite to take everything the world has to offer as his own.

""Monuments"" was originally scheduled to be released last December, in prime Awards competition season, ready to compete with the Best of the Best. Them the studio abruptly changed the release date to February. Hmmmmmmm. That is NEVER a good sign. But the studio PR machine began to spin a good tale; Clooney wanted and needed more time to finish the polish, the effects on the film. It worked. It convinced me.

Now, after watching ""Monuments"", I see the correct phrase should be ""They fooled me.""

Studios do not change release dates for films they have confidence in. They don't move films out of Awards competition if it has a chance of winning an Oscar.

""Monuments"" is not a bad film, but it is a mediocre film. Given he cast and crew involved, it is also a disappointment.

Clooney, morphing into a late-career Clark Gable, plays Frank Stokes, the architect of the mission , the leader of the seven American men, beyond their prime to fight, tasked with heading to France and Germany to save thousands of artworks from Hitler in the final days of the war. He rounds the men up and they head to France. They soon split up and follow different leads about different pieces of art before meeting up again, trying to stay one step ahead of the Germans, who are trying to destroy everything in their path as they retreat, and one step ahead of the Russians, determined to sweep everything they find into the Communist machine.

Each character gets a brief introduction and each makes a reference or a joke about someone else, giving us the indication they have a history together, but the relationships are assumed, not illustrated. Then, they begin working on the plan to save artworks by splitting up. This serves to create an episodic storyline, concentrating on smaller groups and does nothing to help us get to know any of the characters in anything more than a superficial way.

Because the film doesn't really create characters, they simply 'are', we don't really get to know them. And this makes us care less about them. As the groups split up, chasing specific masterpieces, they encounter danger, but the result is surprisingly suspense free. When the danger surfaces, your attention is held but because you are waiting for something to happen, something to move you, something to cause you to sit on the edge of your seat, when this doesn't happen, you begin to lose interest.

The lack of character development is a shame because Clooney is a talented writer/director and he is a good actor. But the characters regard each other much like the cast of an ""Ocean's"" film, all jokes and kidding. In ""Monuments"", there is a definite feeling these characters are an extension of Danny Ocean and his crew pulling off another heist. This almost seems to be a sequel, or a sequel created by a less accomplished writer/director, who just assumes you know what you need to know about the characters.

It is also a shame because Clooney has rounded up a pretty terrific cast. Matt Damon plays James Granger, a restorationist enlisted to go to Paris and meet with Claire Simon (Cate Blanchett), a French woman who worked with the Germans to catalog the artwork they stole. These two characters are the centerpiece of the film and they actually have a few moments throughout to establish a relationship. Bill Murray plays Richard Campbell, an architect from Chicago, who gets paired off with Preston Savitz (Bob Balaban), a stage director. John Goodman's Walter Garfield is teamed with Jean Dujardin's Jean Claude Clermont. Hugh Bonneville plays Donald Jeffries, a disgraced British officer given a second chance with this new assignment.

The lack of suspense is particularly evident in a few scenes. Late in the film, the story becomes a game of cat and mouse; the Americans are trying to stay ahead of both the Germans and the Russians, each for their own, very different reasons. As each of the three groups begins crisscrossing Germany, we watch, but the filmmakers fail to engage us and we simply don't feel the suspense. At one point, they discover a barrel filled with gold fillings. The characters who make the discovery seem shocked when they realize what it means, but they don't feel the horror that we now know. Maybe they didn't know about the extent of the death camps. But if that is the case, why mention it at all. There is a confrontation with an SS officer, an officer who was involved in an earlier confrontation with one of the stars. But when he is confronted, there is simply nothing there, nothing to make use feel suspense or horror.

And because we don't really feel any suspense, watching the film becomes akin to watching a documentary on the History Channel. One of those documentaries filled with reenactments.

Check out John Frankenheimer's 1964 film ""The Train"" starring Burt Lancaster, Paul Scofield and Jeanne Moreau. It is a much better film depicting a very similar story.",1394582400,2,5415,4.847402597402597
5812866,4,B00DHJT4DU,"The Monuments Men is a 2014 American-German film directed by George Clooney, written and produced by Clooney and Grant Heslov, and starring Clooney, Matt Damon, Bill Murray, John Goodman, Jean Dujardin, Bob Balaban, Hugh Bonneville, and Cate Blanchett. Based on the non-fiction book, a 500 or so page tome entitled&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Monuments-Men-Allied-Heroes-Nazi-Thieves-and-the-Greatest-Treasure-Hunt-in-History/dp/1599951509/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Monuments Men: Allied Heroes, Nazi Thieves and the Greatest Treasure Hunt in History</a>&nbsp;by Robert M. Edsel, the film relates the true story of a motley group of aging art experts tasked with finding and saving pieces of art and other culturally important items before their destruction by Hitler and the Nazis during the waning days of World War II.

Originally scheduled to be released in December of 2013, the film appeared on American screens in early February 2014 several weeks before the Oscars were handed out for excellence in Hollywood movie making for the preceding year. The heroic efforts of The Monuments Men would have to wait another year to snag a nomination or two. The selection of films and performances presented for consideration from 2013 had few heroes. We had stories about a bunch of Somali pirates, a corrupt Wall Street swindler, a dysfunctional family in Oklahoma, a Texas hustler who profited from importing AIDS medications, another sad tale of slavery, and a spinster trying to sell her tales to Walt Disney.

George Clooney is to be praised for bringing the story of a few aging ""art warriors"" to the big screen.  The Monuments Men tried to preserve Europe's cultural history by volunteering to find about five million pieces of artwork stolen by the Nazis from wealthy Jews, museums, universities and churches before they were destroyed.  It's a heroic adventure, the largest treasure hunt ever conceived.  And a true story about some of the men and women from 13 countries who gave their time, talent, and effort for this worthwhile cause. Over 6,500 paintings were found at the salt mines in Altaussee, Austria. Gold bullion and 400 paintings from Berlin vaults were found in the copper mines in Merkers, Germany.  Entire valuable private collections of wealthy Frenchmen were found at Neuschwanstein Castle in Germany. Important works such as the ""Madonna of Bruges"" by Michelangelo and Van Eyck's medieval Ghent altarpiece were salvaged.

Interestingly, THE MONUMENTS MEN is not a war movie: it's Saving Mr. Rembrandt not SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. And it's not really a humor-in-the-time-of-war film like MASH nor a comedic-drama like OCEANS ELEVEN although Clooney plays a Harvard art restorer who gathers his ""buds"" for the adventure and some fun.  It's a profound bit of historical and biographical drama.  And it's about heroes.

Hollywood needs more movies about heroes.",1394582400,5,2935,5.59009009009009
5812867,4,B00DHJT4DU,"The first scene of the film is set in a church in Ghent, Belgium. Clerics are busily taking down a large paneled altarpiece which appears to be late medieval/early renaissance in its style. It's the Ghent Altarpiece, one of the most famous artworks ever forged in Europe. The panels are hastily taken down and put into a truck. Word is the Nazis are on their way to confiscate the work, possibly ordered by Adolph Hitler himself.

We often think of Nazi-Germany in terms of what they did in battle and/or to certain religious and ethnic groups in Hitler's ""Final Solution"". However, the Nazis didn't limit themselves only to the gunfire on the battlefields and the horrors of the concentration camps. Another aspect of Nazi-Germany's rape of Europe was the destruction of cultural heritage and legacy, particularly by plundering Europe's artwork from public museums and private collections. In nearly every country the Nazis overrun, they plundered museums and large private collections. It wasn't enough that they subjugated large populations to their totalitarian regime; they also stole their identities. The Monuments Men were a real-life group of ""soldiers"" assigned the daunting task of retrieving the art confiscated by the Nazis towards the end of the war. This film is about their story.

George Clooney plays Frank Stokes who outlines the importance of retrieving the lost art: ""You can wipe out an entire generation, you can burn their homes to the ground and somehow they'll still find their way back. But if you destroy their history, you destroy their achievements and it's as if they never existed. That's what Hitler wants and that's exactly what we are fighting for."" An evil power can subjugate France, but if it destroys the Louvre or Versailles, France itself becomes nearly destroyed. Save the Louvre and Versailles, France lives on.

After the Ghent Altarpiece scene and Stokes' speech, ""the Monuments Men"" rings a bit like ""Ocean's 11"", with Clooney soliciting art historians, scholars, and restorers from different parts of the United States. He puts together a small band of misfits who are either too old or too ill-equipped to be involved in the war on the front-lines. This is their way of being involved in the conflict in a significant way. Their mission: to find and retrieve the lost artwork either from public museums or private collections. The cast is a Who's Who of famous name talent in addition to Clooney: Matt Damon, Hugh Booneville, John Goodman, Bill Murray, and Bob Balaban, just to name a few.

The band breaks off into smaller groups and each has their own story. One of the most interesting is that of real-life figure Rose Valland, although they changed her name to Claire Simone in the story. She has been spying on the Nazis while they've been abducting many great artworks in Paris. In real life, she became a heroine in the cause of stopping the Nazis from their plundering. In the film, she meets James Granger (Matt Damon), who needs her help in finding the art. At first she is reticent, believing he only wants to bring the art back to US museums. In another group, there's Richard Campbell and Preston Savitz (Murray and Balaban) who are following leads into the European countryside, hoping to find some of the lost treasures. Other members go by themselves seeking to save art not yet pilfered by the Nazis, such as Donald Jeffries who goes to the church housing a Madonna and Child by Michelangelo. Eventually the groups will converge and they hit the jack-pot in a way that would make auction houses Southeby's and Christie's salivate.

Although much of the story is a bit exaggerated and doesn't always ring of true history, this is still a very enjoyable film about a subject which has had much less screen-time devoted to it than other subjects of World War II, at least in the United States. (Europe has been all too aware of the devastation of its art at the hands of the Nazis.) Aspects of ""the Monuments Men"" recall the rather idealized films of the late 1950's and early 1960's, such as ""the Great Escape"" and ""the Longest Day"". (The music soundtrack seems inspired by such films with one passage using a whistle and piccolo to intone its patriotic melody, similar to the Great Escape). Not quite a great film, but a good one.",1394064000,2,4294,4.868673050615595

It was a horrible period as far as the inhumanity to man, but an amazing generation of good guys from the U.S., Britain, Canada, and France who died heroically trying to keep the world from going to hell at the hands of a madman in Germany. I liked the heroism of these ordinary men who stood up to a monster and tried to preserve as much of the human spirit as possible through the saving of a culture. It still hurts my heart to hear men use God's name in vain no matter their circumstances, although I know that is real life and men in desperate situations speak from their pain.  And I know that our fighting men and women probably used that word quite a bit, although my own father who also fought in WWII (and is still living at age 94) taught me the difference.

5812889,2,B00DHJT4DU,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

'Monuments Men' is based on the true life team assembled during World War II, of museum directors, curators and art historians, assigned to save pieces of art before they were destroyed by the Nazis. According to the article, 'How Accurate is Monuments Men?', featured in Slate Magazine online, the original task of what was to become MFAA (Monuments, Fine Arts and Archives), was to protect historical buildings and not recover works of art. The film is only very loosely based on the true historical events so the question arises, has Mr. George Clooney successfully adapted the story to the silver screen, so that it works dramatically? The answer, unfortunately, is no.

'Monuments Men' would have worked much better as a documentary but Clooney was determined to turn this into a rip-roaring action-adventure flick with a few comic interludes. The problem of course is that there is no central antagonist throughout the film. The nature of the mission was that it occurred in different locales and at different times, hence the narrative had to be episodic in nature. So we're introduced to one villain after another--and once each one is disposed of, we move on to the next.

'Monuments Men' begins with Frank Stokes (Clooney) assembling his crackerjack team of art experts who must undergo basic training, before they're thrust into combat. It's sort of like 'The Dirty Dozen' with the characters being much more low-key and with little panache. Matt Damon as James Granger is assigned to learn as much as he can from Paris curator Claire Simone (a convincing Cate Blanchett), who kept a journal of all the art work stolen by Viktor Stahl, a Nazi official, who she was forced to work with prior to the German retreat (there is an unlikely scene where Stahl fires his pistol at Claire, as she watches trains loaded with the stolen art work, leave for Germany, from the Paris train station).

Later, team members Richard Campbell (Bill Murray) and Preston Savitz (Bob Balaban), track Stahl down who is disguised as a farmer. Murray and Balaban manage to mine a few laughs as the hapless Stahl is unable to explain away how Rothschild property markings appear on the back of all the paintings he has on the walls of the villa he's staying at. Stahl is then promptly taken into custody.

The film also covers the deaths of two team members who are killed in combat. One of the British members, Donald Jeffries, is killed at a Belgian church, as he attempts to prevent one of the Nazis from stealing the famed Michelangelo statute 'Madonna and Child' (the recovery of that particular piece along with the Van Eyck altarpiece, is the central focus of the film's narrative). A French member, Jean Claude Clermont, is also killed when he's caught in the crossfire of a battle (Clermont is an entirely fictional character as there were no French military personnel assigned to the Monuments Men team).

We shift back again to James Granger who still must convince Simone to provide information on the stolen artwork (she's miffed as she's now being held as a 'collaborator', despite her clear anti-Nazi sentiments). Granger shows her a copy of Hitler's 'Nero Decree' in which he ordered that ""all military, transportation, communications, industrial, and food supply facilities"" be destroyed. Historically, there was nothing about artwork being destroyed in the decree, but obviously, for dramatic purposes, Mr. Clooney added that in. This convinces Simone to finally help Granger and she provides him with her journal that contains all the names and original property owners of artwork stolen by the Nazis.

By including artwork in the 'Nero Decree', (as mentioned in Slate Magazine), Historian Elizabeth Campbell Karlsgodt points out that this was inserted in order to move the plot forward; the Monuments men are seen ""racing against the Germans who are set now to destroy the art if Hitler can't have it."" Karlsgodt doesn't even believe that the Monuments Men even knew about the Nero Decree during their mission: ""The systematic destruction (as seen in the film) being carried out as a result of the Nero Decree never happened,"" she says. ""Nazis destroyed art that they considered degenerate, like Cubist, Surrealist, Expressionist paintings, and we know that they burned several thousand-- at least--paintings that they thought were actually toxic to the German spirit... (But) they didn't destroy the art they valued."" (This included Germanic art, and the Ghent Altarpiece depicted in the film, which Hitler considered to be an example of ""Aryan genius."")

The rest of 'Monuments Men' feels rushed. The team uncovers the 'mother lode' of stolen artwork in a salt mine as well as gold from teeth extracted from Jews sent to the concentration camps. Later they find another mine where the Michelangelo's 'Madonna' is located. The drama is manufactured when they're forced to remove the stolen artwork (including the Madonna) just before the Soviets arrive in the occupation zone designated for them. In reality, the Monuments Men had plenty of time to remove the artwork from the cave--a matter of days and not hours, as depicted in the film.

Clooney gets his last licks in as he interrogates the Nazi colonel responsible for stealing and destroying a good deal of the pilfered artwork. In the case of both Nazis and Monuments Men alike, they're only on for a short time and there's no opportunity for the film's scenarists to develop any of the characters.

Karlsgodt feels that the film's focus on Michelangelo's 'Madonna' and the Ghent Altarpiece undermines the true significance of Hitler's plans and their connection to the Holocaust. Quoted in Slate Magazine, she remarks, ""It leaves out a really crucial aspect of this history. Hitler saw it as a key way to seize the assets of Jews. He was not only eliminating Jewish influence, he was also getting their art.""",1393718400,4,5914,5.013238289205702
5812890,2,B00DHJT4DU,"I have not seen the film and I do not intend to.  I bought and read instead ""The Monuments Men"" by Mr. Edsel and also his book, ""Saving Italy"".  These two books describe in detail the work of the Monuments men and women who were instrumental in saving the art of the major European countries.  In my opinion, no Hollywood film could come close to the description of this work.
I also highly recommend the documentary, ""The Rape of Europa"", which provides much of this effort in a very well done 2 hour film.",1393718400,4,507,4.372340425531915
5812891,1,B00DHJT4DU,"This film has the dubious honour of being the first film I've walked out on at the cinema in favour of finding something better to do with my time. So this review is based on the first 80 minutes.

Although it is curiously described as a thriller,  it had all the makings of an interesting historical drama with a good dose of humour running through it with that cast, but it doesn't hit either side.  One minute it felt like it was going in the direction of Saving Private Ryan and Schindlers List, but didn't have the gravitas or drama to pull it off, only to abruptly switch scenes which were more reminiscent of Indiana jones but without the humour or sense of adventure.  By the time you revisit the ""dramatic"" scene you've forgotten where they are, what they're doing and why you should care.  The music doesn't fit either.  It seems like it wants to be a comedy war caper for the most part, though I sympathise with the composer because the film can't decide what it wants to be. Getting your teeth stuck into a single theme for long enough to illicit any sort of appropriate response from the audience would've been impossible for the composer.

All in all it was a huge dissapointment.  I loved the potential of the cast and I loved the subject matter but it was just so confused and disjointed that in the end it was just frustrating to watch because you felt cheated at the end of every scene just to be thrust into a new one which wasn't any better.",1393459200,11,1461,4.405204460966543

Excellent dedicated ensemble cast despite a few laughs, never loses sight on the importance of the mission.  Most of the action is low key and will disappoint those looking for a shootem-up blockbuster.

5812895,4,B00DHJT4DU,"I wanted to see Monuments Men from the first time I viewed the trailer for the film. The story of finding the works of art looted by the Nazis is an appealing subject for a film and a different twist on the Second World War.

The film opens with several priests crating up the Van Eyck altarpiece in Ghent to remove it before the Nazis could take it. They failed and the priests are shot. The film switches to Frank Stokes (played by George Clooney) as he is making a proposal to President Roosevelt that a team be created to save as many cultural places and works of art from destruction. He is given permission but the overriding thought is that a work of art is not worth a human life.  Stokes assembles a team of art curators, art historians and architecture experts, visiting each one with orders for them to report for basic training. Eventually, he puts together a seven man team (Matt Damon, Bill Murray, John Goodman, Jean Dujardin, Hugh Bonneville and Bob Balaban).

In the meantime in occupied France, Claire Simone (nicely played by Cate Blanchett), a curator in the Paris Jeu de Palme, is forced to assist a Nazi officer named Viktor Stahl to process paintings for Adolf Hitlers proposed Fhrermuseum in Linz, or for the personal collections of Herman Goering. She is nearly arrested for helping her brother to make an unsuccessfully attempt to recapture some art works. Stahl has all of the paintings removed and put aboard a train to Germany as the Allies approach Paris.

Stokes team arrived in Normandy shortly after D-Day and immediately encounters opposition from a colonel when he is asked to avoid shelling a church. The team members spilt up for different missions. Donald Jeffries (Hugh Bonneville) attempts to stop the Nazis from stealing Michelangelos Madonna and Child from a Belgian cathedral by Nazi Colonel Wegner, and is killed when he tries to stop them. James Grainger (Matt Damon) goes undercover to Paris where he meets Claire, who has been put in prison as a collaborator, following the liberation of Paris. Gainger has Claire released but she never trusts him until he shows her Hitlers so-called Nero Decree that mandates the destruction of the looted art.

The film jumps from one historical event to another, so we are informed with an appropriate scene and wording of The Battle of the Bulge and the taking of the bridge at Remagen. The scenes are equally choppy and do not flow from one to the next. One wonders how the Monuments Men interacted with the army and did they always have opposition or did they receive more cooperation. Adding some additional scenes might have helped to make the film more coherent but this is such a large story that it is probably best told in a television series.  Incidentally, the film is not historically accurate in that there were dozens of members in the Monuments Men group and many more were British.  It also was formed in 1943 around the time of the Invasion of Sicily and not as a result of the shelling of Monte Cassino in 1944.

The performances from all of the cast members are good and I liked the mix of humor and drama. The  photography, principally in Germany, is beautiful. The most exciting part of the film is when they are finding the paintings at the end of the film, when the team has to clear out as much art from a cave as they can before the Russians arrive to take control of their sector.

Overall, Monuments Men is an interesting film that could be better.",1393286400,3,3459,4.655737704918033
5812896,4,B00DHJT4DU,"Saw this one in the theater last week - it was a good, enjoyable movie.  It is based on true events, so, we don't know how much is historically accurate, but. . .

As WWII is coming to an end, Clooney pushes for some way to help save the art from being destroyed in the conflicts.  Roosevelt allows him to pull together a team of men to go to the battlefront and see what they can do to preserve the art that is left.  Matt Damon, Bill Murray, John Goodman, and a few others welcome the invitation.  Although Murray and Goodman are not young whippersnappers, they hold their ground in the movie.  Cate Blanchette plays a great part as a German who is fed up with the Nazis and their thievery of the art.  Clooney runs the show, with a strong lead from Damon as the Monuments Men try to track down the thousands of hidden art pieces before the Nazis destroy them or the Russians steal them from the Nazis.

5812907,4,B00DHJT4DU,"George Clooney's ""The Monuments Men"" has received a lot of hostile reviews, which I think is totally unfair. It may not be the most exciting or cohesive World War II film ever made, but it is intelligent, superbly acted, and deeply moving in all the appropriate places.

Clooney heads the cast as Frank Stokes, an art historian who leads the effort to find paintings and sculptures stolen by the Nazis and return them to their rightful owners. The art experts he recruits are played by Matt Damon, Bill Murray, John Goodman, Jean Dujardin, Hugh Bonneville, and Bob Balaban; also in the cast is Cate Blanchett as a Parisian museum curator who provides Damon with invaluable aid at a crucial moment. None of these actors has a particularly large or colorful part, but individually and together they give ""The Monuments Men"" an impressive sheen of professionalism. Murray, Goodman, and Balaban are particularly enjoyable, all providing wry comic relief.

""The Monuments Men"" is necessarily an episodic story as the art experts split up to track different artistic treasures. Cumulatively, however, it is a moving story celebrating the achievements of civilization and the need to protect them from monsters. Some critics objected to Clooney stating those goals outright through the character of Stokes; frankly, I was cheering him. Personally, I really liked ""The Monuments Men,"" and I urge you to give it a try.",1393113600,4,1409,5.095238095238095

Other Hollywood stars got those jobs. Their job is two-fold, Find art that the Germans have stolen and to save the art from being destroyed by the allies. They are met by people who don't want to help. those that do, and those that are skeptical. The group divides up as our plot divides into subplots. The film opened up as if they were going to save the great art works of Rome, Florence, and Milan, but then limits itself to France and the Netherlands. In spite of the Indian Jones action music, I couldn't be moved as our crew discovered where art was hidden.

Yes, the evil Hitler was taking art out of the hands of private collectors and was going to place it in a public museum. In order to create an adrenalin rush our group finds a decree signed by Hitler to destroy all art should Germany fall and BTW the Russians were carefully taking the art as spoils of war.

The film had some mild moments of humor, drama, and some heartfelt scenes, most made possible by the soundtrack. The worst case scenario would be the art would all be destroyed and we would now have more engineers and less scholars on European Art History.

An interesting film that was done well, but it wasn't really a war film, action film, or a gripping drama.

Sam loves history also and knows his mother and dad lived much closer to the era of the subject matter presented than he has.

His readiness to view the film a second time confirmed it.

How does one teach respect.  The reviews offered for this film document the importance of the subject matter by their attention to the film's relation to the book, the production, the script, and so many other aspects in the making of this story.

'The Monuments Men' is a condensed version of the historical effort to safe-guard and salvage much of the greatest art housed throughout Europe endangered by World War II.  The reality is worthy of any kind of attention.

That I would attempt to get my son to see a film like this would not be surprising.  That he labored to get all of us, his family, to see the movie reflects his effort to involve those he loves in something of value.

My son is growing through the stages of his life in the here and now, cognizant that his future is embedded in the past.  He understands that not everything is cheap and frivolous.  Films like 'Monuments Men' underscore his self-worth in the knowledge that not all life is good, and neither is all art, but life can be reflected in art and sometimes the reflection is art as life.

Rightly pointed out, this isn't a smash-em up, action film, but somewhere up there on the screen sketches of life were grabbed and filmed, if only for precious moments.  Art as life.

I definitely did like the fact that it showed the brutality of the destruction, though, and the acting of Holger Handtke was great, even though his appearances were few. His portrayal of Colonel Wegner made me want to punch all of his teeth out by the end of the film.

5812911,3,B00DHJT4DU,".. hidden behind an uninspiring presentation. It really is a fantastic tale, about someone in the military echelon that realized the importance of our art heritage. At least two someones, actually, since the Third Reich, was confiscating everything they could lay hands on. Whether it was a heartfelt attempt at saving the artifacts of culture or just another, possibly petty way to thwart Hitler's ambitions hardly matters. The team of art historians felt it was worth their lives to reclaim the stolen works, and to save them from the ""If I go I'm taking them with me"" megalomaniac.

You might think that WWII movies had already mined the lode of everything dramatically interesting. I very much regret to say you might be right in that. Despite the star-studded cast, the nerds-first premise, and so much about the war and the art itself, I had trouble connecting with the drama and the characters. I like thoughtful movies, and I also like action movies - but this seemed to lack in both thought and action enough that it never generated excitement of either kind.

Watchable, but forgettable.

5812912,2,B00DHJT4DU,"After reading the rather dry book I was hopeful under Clooney's guidance the film could be really interesting with WWII as backdrop. For starters how can you show a movie about the Nazis stealing artifacts during the war yet only show a handful of nazis during the whole film and not show Adolph Hitler? We saw one scene after the other with Monument Men and allies but rarely saw any Nazis. Strange.

I had to chuckle during a midway scene in the movie because Bill Murray looked just like Hitler. Clooney missed an opportunity to cast Murray as Hitler. Several people asked why in the heck were Murray and John Goodman cast in this film? Both gave very weak performances and were miscast. Not so much their faults but rather the director for using them.

I was very excited to see the film after reading the story. I recommend reading the book via AMZN paperback than wasting $20 for the film and popcorn. Frankly we were ready to walk out of the theatre midway thru the film. One of the poorest films I've seen Clooney produce. He had a chance with WWII as the backdrop to come out with a sizzling story that was interesting.

A few of the scenes left you shaking your head like the one Bill Murray and Bob Balaban were confronted by a German soldier and Murray shared a cigarette to calm the situation. It was an awkward moment that Clooney tried to turn into a funny scene but should've been left on the cutting room floor. Another scene Bill Murray has a toothache and finds a German dentist who is excited for the monument men to meet his son. The film tries to make humor out of his dental trip but again it fails. The movie shows the Dentist's son with famous paintings hanging all over the home which is a lie. This did not happen in real life. In real life the son actually gave the monument men a map showing directions to one of the most important caves which was loaded with artwork. In return he asked if he and his family could be given safe travel out of the country. For some odd reason Clooney changed history to save time in the movie I guess but again it made for a boring film.

Good performances by Jean Dujardin and Cate Blanchett, Dimitri Leonidas. I hate to repeat myself but how can you make a WWII film about the Nazis plundering artwork yet only show a handful of German soldiers or officers in your film?

If I had to rate this movie for Clooney it would be a C for failure to develop a better plot. His acting was good but the whole movie left you feeling flat as you watched it. One of the worst WWII films I've ever seen. It was a disappointment as Clooney usually churns out thrilling films.

The 1964 film, The Train with Burt Lancaster is the original film about the Nazis moving paintings from Paris to Germany is much better film and I highly recommend watching it. Much more realistic feel of WWII than the blundering Clooney piece. John Frankenheimer directed the film. It's in black and white which makes the film more authentic.",1392422400,6,2970,4.420475319926874

You can burn their homes to the ground and somehow they'll still come back, but if you destroy their achievements and their history then it's like they never existed...that's what Hitler wants and it's the one thing we simply can't allow."" This is a true story of a group of ""soldiers"" in WWII that were tasked with recovering priceless art that the Nazi's have stolen and return them to their owners. From the beginning the mission was set up to fail but they didn't take into account the passion of the men involved. I was really looking forward to this movie because of the cast alone, but again I love movies based on true stories. Due to that I had very high expectations going in. While I can't say I was disappointed it wasn't as good as I was hoping for. The movie starts off pretty slow but picks up and by the end you are glad you watched. The fact that this is a true story really makes the story that much more powerful and gets you invested that much more into the story and the characters. Overall, this is a movie that I'm glad I saw and it was good but I think my expectations were just a little too high and because of that I didn't like it as much as I thought I would. I give this a B.",1392422400,2,1246,4.174273858921162
5812914,3,B00DHJT4DU,"We went to this movie with high hopes because, well, what movie wouldn't be awesome that has John Goodman and Bill Murray in it. I mean really. Unfortunately, Laura and I came away from this one rather disappointed.

The premise of this one can be summed up pretty simply. World War II is winding down; the Germans know they're losing so they set out to destroy as much of the world's great art as they can before they go. Only one thing stands in their way: motley bunch of aging artists. Dramatics ensue from there.

On the positive side, the film does a great job of portraying the importance of the period of history we're talking about. A thousand years of human art and culture really is on the line. Other reviewers complain about the protagonist's pontifications but this is the whole point of the film. The Nazi's weren't just out to destroy the Jews or rule the world. If they were going down they wanted to take as much of the world with them as they could no matter the price. This story is the ultimate example of ""play by my rules or I'll take my ball and go home."" So all those prolonged speeches aren't in the way of the real action of this war movie, they are in fact its only reason for being.

To the negative, as a connected narrative this movie was just hacked to bits. It could have made a meticulous and moving 6-hour mini-series but cut down to movie size the whole thing is a disconnected mess. There are, at various points, three distinct story lines but the relationships between them are unclear then suddenly they're all slammed together in a barely sensical manner. Further, the movie suffers from Hollywood over-drama just for the sake of drama. It's almost as if they tried to make an action flick out of a story that wasn't one.

In summary, sadly disappointed. Those looking for a movie about a war... won't really get one. Those looking for a moving portrayal of an important historical event won't get what they want either. The whole thing is at times sentimental but never really manages that either. It's almost as if the movie tried to be 10 things at once and never really accomplished any of them with any deftness. Quite a shame, really.

PS: It is always my endeavor to provide helpful reviews. If you find my review helpful then great! If you do not, then please leave me a comment indicating what you want to know and I'll be sure to do better next time.",1392422400,2,2400,4.470319634703197
5812915,3,B00DHJT4DU,"I was trying decide whether to see The Monuments Men in theaters, or simply wait for the Blu-ray. On the one hand, it has a tremendous cast and features some of my favorite actors, but reviews have been generally negative. I eventually chose to make up my own mind.

I'm still not sure if that was a good decision.

The movie is based on a true story, and tells the tale of how a small group of men were charged with the task of recovering artwork stolen by the Nazi's during World War II. I'm tired of stories about Nazi's, but I have a lot of respect for people who fought and still fight for our freedom. Art should be for everyone and I had not heard this story before, so I have to admit that I had high hopes for the movie.

Nobody from the talented cast dominated the story. This was a true ensemble piece with screen time being shared. We are shown a recruiting stage, a planning stage, and then the attempted execution of those plans. Unfortunately, the drama doesn't really build in an effective way. In fact, I'm not certain what the movie was trying to be. There were frequent moments of comedy, interspersed with mystery, brief action, and adventure elements. With all of these important works of art at stake, I somehow failed to be completely invested in the story.

It's hard to pinpoint why it fell flat for me. I rather enjoyed the performances of the principal actors, but I didn't feel much tension during the search, or triumph when works of art were recovered.

The closing credits showed photographs of the real heroes who were involved in the mission 70 years ago.

The most memorable character was James Granger (Matt Damon), who interacted in an important way with Parisian museum curator, Claire Simone (Cate Blanchett), to uncover vital information for the mission. Blanchett's character was based on Rose Valland.

The Monuments Men is an important and heroic story which meanders along without ever becoming riveting. I would watch it again, but I don't think I need to own it.",1392422400,4,2007,4.620786516853933

So, check out ""The Monuments Men"" by Robert M. Edsel.  Excellent book..actually based on real events.",1392336000,2,384,4.602941176470588
5812937,3,B00DHJT4DU,"There are no highs in the movie but plenty of lows. The depressing scenes were so numerous that at one point I was wondering why they didn't just bring in Ol' Yeller and shoot him.

Parts were impossible to understand - A group of old men are drafted into the army at various ranks with no rhyme or reason - I never understood why two were lieutenants, a couple were sergeants, and at least one was a private.

A young German soldier points a rifle at one of them who is out in the woods relieving himself and when another of the old men comes out and points a rifle at the young German, they all sit in the grass, smoke cigarettes, the young man says ""John Wayne"" and the two old guys walk back to their building.

The plot goes like this: A group of artistic people are gathered to save the art that the Germans have stolen. The find some and some of it is destroyed. The End.

However, the art was stolen by Hitler and his 3rd reich. Hitler was going to create a museum of his own filled with the stolen art. I won't go any further into the story since I don't believe in spoilers. The thing to keep in mind is that this is foremost a war film, Still it is not in the same category as Saving Private Ryan or Band of Brothers. Action is not a main factor in this movie, most of the weight of the movie falls on the awe-inspiring story that is told.

5812941,3,B00DHJT4DU,"Why does George Clooney have to pontificate? I'm happy just to watch him for an hour or so. He has assembled an attractive cast, collaborated on the PG-13 screenplay, and directed this piece, but sometimes....

Okay, let's talk about the film. As we all know, Adolph Hitler intended to amass the world's greatest collection of classic art for his Thousand-Year Reich; as a result he plundered museums, churches, art galleries and private collections. (Modern art, created by upstarts like Pablo Picasso and his ilk, was simply burned.) FDR tasked a group of art historians and museum curators to find the missing art, the fear being that as the Nazis lost the war, they might simply burn EVERYTHING. This fictionalized story is inspired by that directive.

If you want to see the actual MONUMENTAL task undertaken by the Allied forces (NOT just American) please check out ""The Rape of Europa,"" which is a jaw-dropping documentary drawn from newsreels, photographs and film clips. Only one scene in this drama alludes to the Allied effort to avoid bombing certain buildings as the war continued. You will never look at European art (or architecture) the same way again. Notice that Amazon has both DVDs offered side by side!

For this story, here are some of the actors we admire:
  * George Clooney (""Gravity"") is Frank Stokes, the idealistic leader of this little squad, which is comprised of men from the art world, who will recognize fine art when they see it. Each has, for one reason or another, been declared ""unfit"" for regular duty.
  * Matt Damon (""Elysium"") plays James Granger, an art professional pulled from his duties in New York City, to try and rescue priceless European art. He learned to speak (poor) French in Canada and he never forgets he has a wife and two daughters waiting for him...
  * Bill Murray (""Hyde Park on the Hudson"") is Richard Campbell, stuck with the obstacle course in basic training and an armed Nazi, later.
  * Jean Dujardin (an Oscar for ""The Artist"") is Jean Claude Clermont, recruited to help because he is French and actually CARES what happens to their art. I've only seen this actor in comic roles, so was pleasantly surprised!
  * Cate Blanchett (""Blue Jasmine"") plays Claire Simone, an employee of the Jeu de Paume, who kept meticulous records of the art that came through her museum.

I particularly liked seeing George's handsome father play Frank Stokes 30 years later when he visits Michelangelo's Madonna and Child with a grandson in Bruges. What a nice touch!",1392249600,42,2514,4.870892018779343
5812942,3,B00DHJT4DU,"Theatrical review.

George Clooney who not only directs, stars, produces and co-writes is also, apparently, the casting director.  He rounds up many of his old buddies and sets us on a journey as WW II draws to a close.  A true story, adapted from Robert Edsel and Bret Witter's book, ""The Monuments Men"" headed here by Frank Stokes (Clooney) are on a mission to save the millions of master artworks that Hitler stole from Europe.  His troop of older, out of shape art experts (Matt Damon, Bill Murray, John Goodman, Jean Dujardin, Hugh Bonneville and Bob Balaban) spread out across the continent searching for the art as Allied forces now have Hitler retreating back to Germany.

That fact alone had me scratching my head.  These guys have no transportation, little tactical support and no combat experience.  Yet Stokes breaks them up into 2 man teams and says, go boys.  The preservation of the world's greatest artworks is all on you.  The cast make the best of the situation.  One of the more interesting set ups is left a bit laboring.  Damon's character, James Granger, is dispatched alone to Paris where he finds a French clerical aid who was forced by the Nazis to catalog art taken from French museums, churches and private citizens.  Claire (Cate Blanchett), at first refuses to help believing that the Americans will just take the art back to their country.  As she queries of Granger, ""Are you here to steal our stolen art?""  It would have been more interesting if Granger's character wasn't so married with kids and was available to Claire's personal needs.

What Clooney has done is make a pretty darn good traditional Hollywood movie.  One that would have been cheered 40 or 50 years ago.  I'm reminded of a similar film in texture, with Steven Spielberg's ""War Horse"" from 2011.  Good old fashion filmmaking including modest dashes of cheese.  In spite of its shortcomings I liked the film.",1391904000,3,1907,4.812307692307693
5812943,5,B00DHJT4DU,"Absolutely the best movie I've seen in over a year if not longer. If you appreciate art and history you will love this. Its serious, poignant, funny and has a terrific cast! Well done! Brilliant film.",1391904000,4,200,4.583333333333333
5812944,4,B00DHJT4DU,"George Clooney, Cate Blamchett, Matt Damon, John Goodman - what's not to like? The fact that it's based on a true story lends tremendous weight to this tale, and gives it a real ""feel good"" atmosphere. There are elements of drama, and pieces of ""real"" acting, but the main reason to see this movie is the story itself, and what a tremendous story it is! As a matter of fact, it's really too big a story for any 2 hour movie to do it adequate justice, but it comes close enough to make it worthwhile. As I have learned subsequently, the movie actually only depicts a part of the effort to retrieve the art stolen by the Nazis, but it is more than enough to convey the obstacles faced - and surmounted - by the talented, brave, and utterly determined band of individuals, of all nationalities who risked much (and sometimes all) to ensure that humanity's greatest treasures did not end up in the dustbin of history.",1391904000,78,913,4.473053892215569
5812945,4,B00DHJT4DU,"This movie opens with the announcement that it is based on a true story.  As reported by Wikipedia, ""The Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program under the Civil Affairs and Military Government Sections of the Allied armies was established in 1943 to help protect cultural property in war areas during and after World War II. The group of about 400 service members and civilians worked with military forces to safeguard historic and cultural monuments from war damage, and as the conflict came to a close, to find and return works of art and other items of cultural importance that had been stolen by the Nazis or hidden for safekeeping.  Many of the men and women of the MFAA, also known as Monuments Men, went on to have prolific careers. Largely art historians and museum personnel, they had formative roles in the growth of many of the United States' greatest cultural institutions, including the National Gallery of Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the New York City Ballet, as well as in museums and other institutions in Europe.""

Though there appears to have been a great deal of artistic license, kudos to Clooney for being a force in bringing this monumental tale to the screen!  In the film, as explained by Carl Kozlowski of the Catholic News Agency,""an art professor named Frank Stokes [played by Clooney]... is recruited by President Franklin D. Roosevelt himself to organize a team of American art experts to recapture classic European art that was stolen by the Nazis....the two works that our heroes are most in awe of and expend the most effort towards are the altarpiece from the Cathedral at Ghent and Michelangelo's sculpture of the 'Madonna and Child.'""

One drawback of the film is that it unnecessarily wonders whether art is worth more than a human life.  The real answer is that each of us is God's work of art, which cannot be paralleled by any human work of art.",1391817600,,1900,4.795107033639144
5812946,4,B00DHJT4DU,"""The Monuments Men"" sheds dramatic light on a forgotten aspect of the Second World War. The so-called Monument Men, a group of overage art experts, entered war-torn Europe in 1944 in a race against time to keep priceless works of stolen art from being destroyed by the Nazis or scavenged by the oncoming Soviet Army.

Art expert Frank Stokes (Clooney) gets permission from the President to recruit his own team (a fine cast of Matt Damon, Bill Murray, John Goodman, Bob Balaban, Hugh Bonneville, and Jean Dujardin). They will follow the U.S. Army over the Normandy beaches into battlefield chaos. The movie becomes a treasure hunt, as the team follows a thin trail of clues to a series of hidden Nazi caches of art. As the story makes clear, they weren't able to rescue everything, nor were they immune to the fighting going on around them.

The movie has a hurried feel, as it mixes drama, humor, and tragedy in unequal proportions. It does have some great moments. Among them: Bill Murray as SGT Richard Campbell, listening to a recording of ""Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas"" at a desolate rest camp in Belgium; Matt Damon as Lt. James Granger, trying to persuade a French museum curator to share her knowledge of the missing art; Clooney as LT Stokes, interrogating an arrogant SS officer at the end of the war; and the final panic-stricken search for two key pieces of stolen art, just ahead of the Soviets. Cate Blanchet steals the movie as Claire Simone, a museum curator secretly working for the French resistance. Recommended.",1391817600,,1541,4.811320754716981
