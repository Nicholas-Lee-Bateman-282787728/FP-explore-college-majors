3891037,5,B002ARVI52,"I had no idea what this DVD was but I took a chance and ordered it anyhow.  Turns out it is a 1970 concert Joni taped in England for the BBC.  It captures Joni during that golden time right between LADIES OF THE CANYON and BLUE.  My favorite moment was during ""My Old Man"" -- which was so new Joni hadn't even written all the verses for it yet!

Here is the set list:
Chelsea Morning
Cactus Tree
My Old Man
For Free
California
Big Yellow Taxi
Both Sides Now

It is always interesting to watch vintage Joni live clips -- she always changed up her melodies and phrasing which makes it interesting.

This is a must watch for lovers of Joni!",1236556800,27,637,4.180327868852459
8360077,5,B002ARVI52,This is possibly  her first concert when she went from writing music to performing.  This had an innocence and a feeling in her performance that is priceless.,1509494400,,158,4.814814814814815
8360078,4,B002ARVI52,"Someone has commented about no track listing on the product info section. So here they are:
1. Jennifer Jupiter  2.  There Is A Mountain  3. Catch The Wind  4.  The Ordinary Family  5.  Lovely Princess (Unknown)  6.  People Call Me The Pied Piper 7. A Well-Known Has-Been  8.  Happiness Runs  9.  Colours  10. Sailing Homeward  11.  Cosmic Wheels/Maria Magenta  12.  The Pee Song  13.  Mellow Yellow

This performance was filmed in 1972, probably for the BBC since Donovan makes a joke about it, and runs for over an hour. The color and sound are very good. 'Intimate' is the best description of this acoustic concert as it's just him with a guitar and occasional mouth organ facing a friendly audience. He looks like an elf; nowadays he's more like an old Hobbit but still sings as great as ever. I know this for a fact because in 2005 I saw him in concert and with front row seats.

The songs selections offered a few surprises. #'s 4,5,6 &7 were unknown to me and pleasant. There's nice versions of 'Sailing Homeward' and 'Cosmic Wheels' but I prefer the live ones found on concerts CDs. Donovan is relaxed and charming as he sometimes explains the songs and cajoles the audience into sing-alongs. I didn't know the lovely 'Sailing Homeward"" was written for the Pied Piper film in which he starred and was filmed around the time of this concert so some of these songs are a tie-in.

Too bad there's no 'Sunshine Superman' or 'Season of the Witch' here but this isn't a greatest hits show as when I saw him. For that, order his concert filmed in 2007. Better yet, see him live if you get the chance. You won't be disappointed. Regardless, this DVD is a must for fans and a good companion piece to the recent one.",1309046400,7,1714,4.4935064935064934
8360079,5,B002ARVI52,"It is hard to say Donovan really had a peak since I have another DVD of him live 35 years later that is as good as this. These songs were still rather fresh, and since Don is doing them at a time when they were just written, I say they were peak performances. Most noteable is a solo performance of Cosmic Wheels on 12 string guitar. Most of the songs Don performs, he still does live. Seeing Donovan in his fresh faced glory, singing with his clearest voice, you get the essence of the man Donovan was. He still is that man, just a tad more grey.",1294617600,9,547,4.121495327102804
8360080,5,B002ARVI52,"Just like that old saloon singer Old blue eyes, the minstrel Donovan has been a pauper a pirate a pawn and a king. He's been up and down and over and round. A stooge, a scamp and a sage, a troubador, vagabond, Jester,steller seller of songs, a rascal. Poet,philosopher, teacher and muse. No one has had the breath and depth of so many styles and talents and joy for what he tells us of ourselfs. Bravo!",1293926400,7,402,4.302631578947368
8360081,5,B002ARVI52,"I knew when I ordered the DVD,"" Joni Mitchell An Intimate Performance, that I would be in for a wonderful experience. Being a diehard Joni Mitchell fan, I'm always on the lookout for anything Joni. I knew I had hit pay dirt before the DVD was ordered, and my first viewing of it proved that to be true. What a marvelous moment in time this DVD captures. Travel back to 1970 and join a small, BBC Television Theatre audience as they are serenaded by a young Joni Mitchell. Accompanied beautifully by her guitar, dulcimer, and piano, Joni shines on this short performance of seven of her early songs. I would recommend this DVD to any of Joni's fans, and would consider it a must for any respectable Joni Mitchell collector. Treat yourself to a bit of Joni history...I think you will be as delighted as I was with the purchase.

8360082,4,B002ARVI52,"I was going to give this a one star review ,Because when I played it on my Sony Blue Ray player
all I could get was a 16x9 image,from a 1:33 image streched

but after taking the dvd out and putting in my non-HDMI
dvd player,I got a 1:33 image(the way it was filmed)so it gets 4 stars ,

The BBC Show that iit was from is one of the best music shows ever on TV,The Cat Stevens one
is the best,but they did wonderful shows with Elton,Joni,Neil,ect",1264118400,6,445,4.045454545454546
8360083,2,B002ARVI52,"There is a serious technical fault with video encoding on the DVD, ""Joni Mitchell - An Intimate Performance"". The concert was originally recorded for BBC-TV nearly forty years ago using the standard 4:3 aspect-ratio video format of the era. This new DVD release has been encoded in anamorphic widescreen catering to viewers with modern 16:9 TVs but the producers did not preserve the old source aspect ratio. The result is a distorted picture that makes a 27 year-old Joni Mitchell look short and chubby rather than tall and slim. My video encoding software reports that the 720x480 pixel MPEG-2 source of this DVD has been squeezed down to 720x400 output pixels. Re-encoding a sample chapter at an output of 720x480 pixels without the anamorphic effect restores a normal appearance to the picture. The DVD should be recalled and remanufactured. You should not consider buying it until this issue is resolved.",1259193600,17,909,5.066666666666666
8360084,5,B002ARVI52,"I had this on DVR for last 5yrs.,from MTV. Then I lost it,what a major bummer! Thank-God for this DVD!, Talk about early,pure Joni,it's all here! WoW! I am so happy to have found this Rare concert,from BBC. Just Buy it!*You will love it!!!",1256515200,4,239,4.454545454545454
8360085,5,B002ARVI52,"Personally, I tend to gravitate towards her recent recordings.  But this!  Oh, my god!  The only bummer is that is is so brief.  Her ability to connect with the audience, herself, and her muse is beyond description.  This performance is up there with any live performance with any musician.  You feel like she's sharing her thoughts, her insight, her artistry with only you.  Stop reading this review; Just buy the damn thing!",1251072000,2,426,4.833333333333333
8360086,3,B002ARVI52,"I am Joni fan, but this video left me disappointed.  From the photo on the cover, I expected newer Joni, but this video was one of her earliest performances, before she had become really famous.  I still enjoyed it, but it was not what I expected.",1243814400,5,247,4.3478260869565215
