Every time I  let myself get out of shape again, I would go back and start with this one to gradually get myself stronger and more flexible.  Fantastic!!!!!!",1382572800,,252,4.1020408163265305
334921,5,6301536959,"The main reason I decided to go with Richard Simmons as opposed to ALL those many other fitness gurus out there is that he's been on the other side of bad health and obesity.  He is FOR REAL and very encouraging when it comes to eating right, exercising, and relating to how hard it is to live healthy and to lose weight.  His motto is always to BELIEVE IN YOURSELF and DON'T GIVE UP, one day at a time.  When we see Richard today in 2006, he is high energy, electric, and talks fast.  But in this 1994 tape, he looks less hyper, is more low key, and talks slower and softer.  He understands and comes across as very sincere in his desire to help people to get on the road to good health through nutrition and exercise.  The beginning part is basic food knowledge that everyone should know.  The exercise part seems like Richard Simmons in slow motion. And he always includes people to exercise along with him in his videos who are overweight and dealing with the Battle of the Bulge too, so I don't feel alone.  I'd rather exercise with these real folks than those skinny, shapely, muscular, model-looking aerobics instructors (most people don't look like them anyway). This tape is very inspiring and encouraging and has got to be the absolute bottom line easiest exercise video for the most out-of-shape person on the planet!",1158278400,3,1328,4.550420168067227
334922,4,6301536959,This video is great for those who do not know where to begin.  The first 15-20 minutes is a nutrition class and you meet some of richards clients who have lost a great deal of weight.  the last 40 minutes is the actual aerobic  portion.  This is a very slow aerobic video so if you have been flustered in the past on keeping up you do not have to worry.  I found the video not as advanced for me but I enjoy it because I am using it as my warm-up before I do my treadmill so I pop this video in and warm-up for 5-10 minutes then go to treadmill for my fatburning part.  Richard is not crazy in this video he is quite tame in personality.  Hope this helps!!,1146614400,4,656,3.9618320610687023
334923,5,6301536959,"If you have been a couch potatoe, this is the video to get you up and starting to move. It is very low impact. I have arthritis in both knees and hips, and this video lets me move and not be in pain. I would reccommend this to everyone. I had this tape a long time ago, and lost it when I moved. I was very happy to find it again.",1127692800,2,330,3.6619718309859155
334924,5,6301536959,I have had this video for years and have used it throughout the years to get me going.  I will have just about worn it out and will have to buy a new copy.  Great stretching exercises to get me going in the morning.  I get up early (4am)to do it - I can now follow with my eyes closed - just listening to him! Love ya Richard!,1065916800,5,326,3.764705882352941
334925,5,6301536959,i am looking for the exersice moves for this exersice program i have the cassett tape but i can't remember how to do the moves so i would love to get the moves if possable thank you,1043107200,,181,3.918918918918919
334926,5,6301536959,"This tape is excellent for beginners.  I didn't have any trouble keeping up with the moves, but it got my heartrate up.  It's not too intense, and I enjoyed doing it.  I'm not a big fan of exercise tapes, because the moves are usually difficult and I feel completely exhausted afterwards.  This tape isn't like that at all.  If you are beginning a weight loss/better health program this tape is for you!",1024185600,16,403,4.541666666666667
334927,5,6301536959,"This is a great tape for anyone who is trying to lose weight but is having trouble doing it.  The exercises are very easy to follow and you don't feel like you're ready to fall over at the end from exhaustion.  I have asthma and this is the only tape I can do because it's not straining on my lungs and it gives me a very good workout.  Even if you need to lose fifty pounds or five pounds this tape is wonderful.  No more excuses for not getting into shape, even if you have health problems.  God Bless you Richard Simmons.",970358400,47,524,4.098039215686274
7812798,5,6301536959,"This is the best full-boddy stretch video tape EVER on the market. Richard talks us through in a gentle and encouraging voice. He and only he, knows what we need.",1501459200,,162,4.433333333333334
7812799,5,6301536959,"Ordered as a gift for a friend.  She wanted a DVD edition, which does not exist.  Great beginning exercise video.",1493510400,,113,4.6
7812800,5,6301536959,"I don't care what anyone says, this tape is awesome.  My kids, who are now in their 30's remember me doing this tape when they were growing up.  They joke about it but it works.  It gets easier every time you do it and I also add 30 minutes of walking after about a month.  I've gained weight because of medicine and had lost my copy (although I almost have it memorized).  My son found the VHS on Amazon and ordered it for me.
I fast forward through the nutrition part and go straight to the workout.  I wouldn't be without it again.",1468540800,,534,4.135922330097087
7812801,5,6301536959,I love it but would really love it if you would please put it on DVD!  PLEASE!,1453766400,,78,3.588235294117647

Is it legal to have it copied at the stores that do that?<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Get-Started-Richard-Simmons-VHS/dp/6301536959/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Get Started Richard Simmons [VHS</a>]",1442275200,,302,7.6571428571428575
7812803,5,6301536959,Love this video. Just right for beginners. Wish it would come out in DVD. Almost anyone can do the exercises in this video. They are easy and low impack. You feel great after doing your daily workout. The beginning is educational. Once you watch it the next time you just want to fast forward to the work out part. This video is nothing like sweating to the oldies and other such videos that Richard Simmons has made. I love all of Richard Simmons workout videos. This is just one of my favorites for floor exercises and such.,1436140800,,526,4.43298969072165
7812804,5,6301536959,"This is one of Richard Simmons' earlier videos and it is hard to find unless you buy a used one.  I didn't pay much attention to the first part about portions and what to eat, but the actual exercises are great.  They don't seem like much at first, but if you are out of shape, this is a good video to start with, especially if you are overweight and older.  I don't even do the floor exercises these days.  Once you get used to it, add ankle or wrist weights.  It really slims down the waist and thighs.  I lost my copy, or thought I did, so ordered another one, then found the first one.  I even copied my VCR version onto a DVD for my personal use.",1432944000,,651,4.0390625
