7607120,2,B01AKUNODY,"Tina (Jessica Willis) wins a U-Tube dare and goes to a cabin in the woods with 3 other friends. Here there is a tape recorder and they break a TV as evil things happen as an homage to ""Evil Dead.""

The acting was hit and miss, i.e. the girls did better as evil characters The dialogue and scenes were mostly stolen from other films. The commentary on the film tells you where they stole obscure scenes from other films: ""Predator 2"", ""The Ring,"" ""Skeleton Key,: ""Feardotcom,"" ""Carrie"", and ""Ichi the killer."" The commentary was unprofessional as we get to listen to the rustling of a bag of chip as well as the crunching while being eaten. The rest of the time they discuss why the scene didn't work and the film they wanted to make had they been able to get the insurance for using chainsaws.( Most chainsaws don't use the blade and have their sound dubbed.)

7607121,1,B01AKUNODY,"WARNING! WARNING!  I am a hoarder, if you will, of movies!  I keep my collection at about 200 and every 2 or 3 months begin to gather them and sell them, so I can make way for new movies coming out etc!!  SO basically, I love movies!!  YESTERDAY at Walmart I saw this movie  Lake Fear and the description on the box was sooooo amazingly and excitingly magnificent, that I spent $10 on a movie, granted no known actors in it, but I've bought other movies with unknown people and they were good!!!  WARNING, DO NOT spend your money on a low, low, budget, ridiculous, no rhyme or reason movie!!  Honestly it's all chesp, red syrup blood constantly being thrown around and girls in shorts getying chopped up oh and pig masks!!  I will make believe I donated $10 to charity!!! The only brilliant person here is THE WRITER WHO WROTE THE  DESCRIPTION of the movie so amazingly captivating, that I quickly bought it! Doesn't even deserve the one star, but there's nothing lower.",1460246400,2,970,4.528735632183908

7607123,1,B01AKUNODY,The worst horror movie of the year.,1459814400,2,35,4.142857142857143
7607124,1,B01AKUNODY,"Calling the acting horrible would still be calling it acting. Bad sound quality. Silly dialogue. No explanation of how or why the ""good guy"" got there and why he didn't get possessed. Seriously, don't waste your time. It's not even campy, or anything that would make it a fun thing to watch. Funniest part, and another reviewer pointed this out, is that the ""abandoned"" cabin is clean, well maintained, and the lawn is perfectly manicured. Lol!!",1482624000,,445,4.868421052631579
7607125,1,B01AKUNODY,"Hmmm - an hour of my life that I will never get back!!! *Sigh*
Horror they say - utter jargon, I say.
Where was the HORROR? The production was poor and the characters didn't come off as good actors.
The entire story made no sense to me.
Not worth watching again!",1474848000,,262,4.1568627450980395
7607126,1,B01AKUNODY,"Wow. Just. . .ugh. This might have been the worst movie I have ever seen. It starts, and I immediately thought, ""okay, someone tricked a bunch of high school girls in Texas into doing a horror movie."" Sure enough I was right, they were in Texas. The dialogue is vile, empty and dumb. The premise is that there is a cabin at a lake in the woods (of course) and then they decide to put it in Texas. The frame where they show the cabin for the first time shows almost no trees and POWER LINES going to the cabin. It can't exactly be remote if it has power lines.
From that point one for about the next 45 minutes, it is an awful mish mash of clips and shots that I guess were left on the cutting room floor of a circus. Think the video from the ring, that makes you die seven days later except that it was way longer, kind of funny, not at all scary and made me die instantly.
Then there is some ballet style dance break with masks for some reason.
Also, this is the first and hopefully last cinematic appearance of man-bear-pig.",1473465600,4,1026,4.160804020100502

7607137,1,B01AKUNODY,"I actually fell asleep watching it. At 11am. Sitting at my desk in my office. I had a dream about running errands.

So bad that I suspect the 3 Star reviews are from people who worked on the film but have too much integrity to give it anything higher. They clearly did not have enough story material for a full-length feature resulting in a film that is ~50% over-long, drag-pace scenes and ~70% the same series of scenes cut-n-pasted over and over, none of which was coherent. If 120% seems like too much, so did the run-time! If you're familiar with the horror genre you will quickly notice how almost every scene jumps right over the line separating 'homage' and 'copy.'

Aside from the devastating script problems, the audio quality is all over and shifts from too quiet to too loud constantly, almost every shot is an overly dark extreme close-up (to avoid showing us the undressed set?), and the editing and effects (lots of quick-cuts and flickering light) are clearly being used to disorient the viewer to keep us from seeing how bad the shots are. They clearly used actual low light and shadows rather than fakey day-for-night shots for some scenes, but the reason that's clear is because you can hardly see anything and the camera's ISO is jacked up so high to compensate that their picture is full of noise.

I hope how awful this film is doesn't discourage the people who made it from trying to make a good one.",1470182400,3,1423,4.594488188976378
7607138,3,B01AKUNODY,"It started okay with the background of 4 girls who are planning slip over together in some lonely lakeside cabin. But soon after starting it became like some B grade movie. Do not expect much from this movie, it is a low budget movie with repeating plot. The acting of the four girls are also below average. If you can continue watching this till the end there are some twists and turns which make it a timepass horror movie at best. Overall a below average movie.",1469750400,,464,4.406976744186046
7607139,1,B01AKUNODY,"Absolutely horrendous mish mash of every other movie that was so much better - Evil Dead, The Grudge, The Ring..it goes on. Stupid teens go to cabin in the woods and supernatural events ensue. That about sums it up. Even the ""Ash"" guy towards the end has no real place in this and the Danse Macabre sequence is nothing short of laughable - if you get that far. The editing is enough to make you lose interest about halfway. Awful.",1469664000,2,430,4.3875
7607140,3,B01AKUNODY,"Kinda...

Quartet of friends enter abandoned cabin and soon a woman comes out of the TV set, a tape recorder plays itself and demons (or possessed people) show up.

I would rate higher but it got a bit too repetitious with lots of scenes of the girls just sitting on the floor hiding and/or looking at weird stuff and unfortunately none of it was it scary at all.

That said, the cast does well, the FX are really good and there are some beautifully shot scenes.

Recommended to fans of micro-budget Horror.",1469577600,2,507,4.478260869565218
7607141,1,B01AKUNODY,"This popped up as  a recommendation.  No Amazon reviews, but the IMBD rating made me decide to check it out.

Well, I watched this entire mess and I can say in a stereotypical cop voice ""move along, nothing to see here"".  There are the occasional bits of interest, but really there is so much more you could be watching.

Plot / spoilers

Four near college age girls head to a cabin in the woods.  They are (for the review) Blondie, Ginger, Brunette, and Furryy.  Blondie has somehow convinced her mom that she is going on a three day summer school outing.  The bimbos her way to borrow a car.  Ginger is supposed to bring the beer.  Brunette is along for the ride and has invited Furry of the cat ears and fuzzy tail.

They park near a major roadway (seen in the background) and are stopped by  small stream that they must strip out of their skimpy clothes into their underwear to cross (bad fan service).  They then make their way to an immaculate cabin with mowed lawns -- the supposed ""abandoned"" cabin.  There is a vague reference to a Youtube dare/ contest that Blondie participated in.

The movie then becomes an incoherent mess where various scenes, with no real logic, pay homage to the Evil Dead, Poltergeist, the Ring, and Blair Witch.  Suddenly the great hero Neck Beard appears -- guess he got tired of holding the I-phone and demanded to be in the movie.  More disjointed scenes follow and finally the movie stops (not ends, not finishes, just stops pretty much)

I would zero star this (if I could) except for the scenes that are clearly rip offs of other movies -- they have at least some interest and may be worth a watch for the desperate or the intoxicated.  For all else, walk away -- I have suffered this waste for you and beg you to move on.....",1468800000,4,1767,4.445482866043614
7607142,2,B01AKUNODY,"Four cute chicks decide to check out a seemingly abandoned cabin they discovered on YouTube. Once they get there they are, one by one, possessed by a malevolent unseen force which drives them insane and quickly prey on each other. And that's basically it for the plot. I was on my way to giving this movie a 1 star review until the movie hit the 45 minute mark. About at that point is when this movie starts to get ... interesting. The first half hour of Lake Fear is pretty abysmal. It's slow moving and one particular problem is the sound quality. It tends to go in and out and you have a hard time understanding what the girls are saying. About the only thing that gets you through it is the quartet wear skimpy clothes. At one point they strip down to their undies to cross a stream. There's no nudity in the movie. But things really get going when the madness begins. The girls go nuts and the flick delights in really messing them up. The make up effects are surprisingly good. A series of macabre imagery engulf the screen. From whispering voices and screams to females with long black stringy hair, J- horror style. At one point some guy enters the movie to help out out lasses. I don't know why he was there exactly. Y'know, sound quality. I have given Lake Fear an extra star for the make up and the fact that the actors were able to sell the insanity reasonably well. If you're expecting any explanation for why all this is happening forget it. None of it makes a lick of sense. All you get is a gaggle of giggling girls put through the *ahem* ringer. Which is the only selling point Lake Fear has.",1467417600,,1609,4.348837209302325

8747697,3,B01AKUNODY,"I know that a lot of people give this movie a bad review but I want people to know that it does have its moments and there are some interesting scenes. Of course, it could have been executed better but I give the people that did it credit because it was probably an early effort and considering that it is not wholly terrible. If you liked the Evil Dead movies then you should at least give this a try.",1520380800,,402,4.10126582278481
8747698,1,B01AKUNODY,"Abysmally bad. Non-existent production quality. Terrible dialog. I tried to get through the whole thing, but couldn't muster the will to do so. A halfway competent director could have put something worth watching together as cabin full of girls in the woods films are about the easiest there is to pull off.",1517875200,,307,4.923076923076923
8747699,1,B01AKUNODY,"I tried to give this one a shot, but it's a total crapfest. Too much droning music when silence would have worked better at times, and so loud it drowns out the dialogue. So much of it is dark you can't see what is happening, and when you can see you wonder what exactly IS happening. Like the trailer shows, four girls go to a cabin where strange phenomena happens almost immediately. Why? Who knows? Maybe if I stayed with it I would have found out, but I could only watch half of it before the dark scenes and loud droning just turned me off. Okay to pass on this one.",1515196800,,571,4.153153153153153

8747702,1,B01AKUNODY,"5th grade film project at best. The audio is horrendous, but, matters not as there's hardly any dialogue and you can't hear it anyhow. It's like some kid filmed this with their IPhone one evening. No discernable plot, lighting is beyond bad, acting is grade school level. Just bilge. It made little sense.
