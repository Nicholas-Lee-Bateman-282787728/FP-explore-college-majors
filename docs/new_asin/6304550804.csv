7874727,1,6304550804,"Goblin (Todd Sheets, 1993)

I have a number of deep-rooted sicknesses I can't seem to shake. I have arthritis. My gastrointestinal tract produces enough acid to eat away the state of Florida roughly every week. And I keep watching Todd Sheets movies, even though you would think, given my excoriations of Zombie Rampage (viz. the 11-19-2008 issue) and Catacombs (viz. 6-12-2010) that I would have learned my lesson. Sadly, it was not to be, and I popped in Goblin the other night. I should have known I would then proceed to get eye-raped for the next seventy-four minutes, but I can be truly thick-headed when the mood strikes me. (As I write this, I'm watching a Lamberto Bava movie. Some people never learn.)

Plot: way back in the past, a farmer raised a goblin to help him with the farm work. Instead, it killed his family. (Those darned mischievous goblins!) So he trapped it in a well out back. Fast-forward to the present, and some young-and-beautifuls have just bought the place, and brought a bunch of friends along to help them move in, one of whom thoughtfully removed the cover from the well. You know where this is going, of course, because you've seen this exact excuse for a plot at least a dozen times.

The difference between this and a much better film of its stripe is that Todd Sheets can't direct his way out of a paper bag. He also always casts his friends, who have very little acting talent, rather than trying to come up with, you know, decent actors. While this film does have a plot, which is a Sheets rarity, it gets sidetracked on a fairly regular basis, and then descends into the usual Sheets-style incoherence.

In other words, if you somehow find yourself with a copy (you bought it as part of a job lot, or you were drunk at the time, or whatever), consider the act of taking it out of its case as analogous to taking the cover off the well. You really don't want to let this beast out of its cage, for you will find yourself afflicted with nausea, vomiting, possible drowsiness, heart palpitations, depression, and even erectile dysfunction. And we won't even get into the side effects. (half)",1299542400,,2129,4.6094986807387865
7874728,4,6304550804,"I'll admit it was cheap but after awhile I kinda got freaked out by the monster. Thinking he is just around the corner. All the people die the same way, they get their guts ripped out by the goblin. Has enough gore to make the gorehounds satisfied and is very ""interested"".A woman even gets her guts pulled out of her head and ear, how extreme and weird is that. Sure it's unrealistic but it's something you don't see everyday. Don't expect anything realistic or too good, this looks like something Tod Sheets filmed with a camcorder, actually I think he did, this was what he made when he was beggining to make films , so I heard. If you are a filmmaker or just want to make something for the first time watch this film and study it oh yeah and laugh at all the cheap ""effects""! Just get the movie, it's a whole new experience , what more can I say? Either you really love it, or you really hate it, but give it a try.",997056000,2,919,4.19774011299435
