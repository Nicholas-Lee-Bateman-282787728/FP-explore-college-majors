1212764,5,B00000FELM,"This was my favorite American Experience documentary. I saw it years ago and never forgot it, so I bought it recently from Amazon to see if it still had the same effect on me. It did. A haunting and poignantportrait of our innocence in that era. The filmmakers paid great attention to detail and successfully captured the mood. This is such an engrossing film I had to give it five stars.",1202860800,29,388,4.47887323943662
1212765,5,B00000FELM,"When this film was originally broadcast on PBS in 1998, I had not heard of the 1918 Spanish Influenza.  I was shocked that I had never heard of the 1918 pandemic, given the impact it had on the 20th century.  I've now read every book I coould find that chronicles the outbreak.  Some of the historical facts in the film may be disputed in other histories, but it's a solid documentary and I highly recommend it.  It is a rivoting film.

Update:  Thinking about the impact  this had on me, I'm not sure why I docked it a star...so now adjusted accordingly.",1152057600,32,555,4.382352941176471
1212766,4,B00000FELM,"I did relatively well in high school American history and yet I never heard of this national crisis.  I guess World War I wasn't the only big deal of the 1910s.  I am glad to see that the American Experience series not only covers great names, wars, and transportational feats, but also health concerns.

I recall that Charlie Chaplin's sweetheart died in a flu epidemic in Britain, but I didn't know the problem started in the United States.  (If our revolution and our stock market crash can have global effects, I guess I should not be surprised.)  It's easy to think of the bubonic plague as the world's only human international die-off.  However, this film shows that it happened in the recent past too.  This shows that savage diseases can be spread widely, unlike the localization of Ebola or SARS.  I learned that the Titanic's sinking humbled early 20th-century modernists, but this flu outbreak must have been the same way.  Nowadays, incurable diseases are usually associated with stigmatized groups.  In contrast, this work clearly points to American soldiers, a well-respected group, as the cause of the spread.

This work proved the problem was cross-regional.  This is not example of something on the East Coast being equated with all of America.  The epidemic hit Philadelphia, but San Francisco, Nebraska, and the Dakotas as well.  This work starts with interviewees waxing nostalgic about the pre-flu period.  I thought it was offensive to think of a Jim Crow time as wonderful.  However, this work compensates by interviewing an African-American witness to the crisis and a person recalling how a Native American group was affected.

In ""Memoirs of a Geisha,"" one character says, ""The interesting thing about wars is that you never know who will survive and who will not.""  This work revealed the same is true in epidemics.  It was a bit anti-climactic how this crisis was resolved, but history doesn't usually have spectacular conclusions.  After the bubonic plague, Europeans stopped killing cats and started killing mice.  Because of AIDS, many are now practicing safer sex and cleaning drug needles.  This documentary doesn't suggest that public health changed at all due to the flu.  I'm surprised by that.

I usually don't care for scientific matters, but this work was informative and really has my wheels spinning.",1150243200,28,2341,5.052219321148825
1212767,4,B00000FELM,"I am afraid that I must disagree with the other reviewers. Comparing a video to a book is unfair. An hour video can not be expected cover the length and breadth of such a topic as well as a four hundred page book.

The movie does an excellent job of introducing the uninformed to the terrible experiences of families struck by the flu in 1918.  It puts the virus in historical context and shares sad but fascinating interviews with those that lived through it.  My students learned a great deal about this virus and the link between history and infectious disease. Viewing this video lead to many interesting discussions.  My only complaint is that the editors, obviously pressed to fit everything in,  left out the link between this virus and literature.  One of the main characters in this video is Katherine Anne Porter.  They share her experience with the virus and how she recovers only to find that the soldier boyfriend that helped her through it , has died of the flu.  Very touching but they never mention that she went on to become one of the finest American short story writers. Porter won the Pulitzer prize for literature in 1966 for her collected works. One of her stories, titled Pale Horse, Pale Rider, tells a fictional but semi-autobiographical tale of characters in 1918 and their experience with the flu.  The video quotes from this story but does not mention that Porter shared her experiences in this fine short story.  My students enjoyed the show, learned a great deal and it lead to excellent discussions.",1104451200,20,1530,4.739622641509434
1212768,2,B00000FELM,"like the other reviewers here, I found this a major disappointment. The good news is, a truly oustanding book came out this year (2004) ""The Great Influenza: The Epic Story of the Deadliest Plague in History"" by Barry will tell you all you wnat to know about this, and it will also give you some terrific history besides, that you would not ordinarily connect with disease (politics, war, the press, etc).  An older review here, written apparently before this book was published, mentioned 2 other books. Alfred Crosby's ""America's forgotten Epidemic"" is also a very good book, tho not nearly as good as Barry's. It is however shorter. Gina Kolata's book-- skip it. It has little to do with events of 1918; it's really about now-dated current scientists digging up bodies lookign for the virus. Barry gives you a far better understanding of both science and the virus.",1098403200,4,868,4.864864864864865
1212769,3,B00000FELM,"I saw this documentary when it came out on PBS several years ago.  The individual accounts of  the virus and its rapid spread were quite unsettling.  I got a good sense of the public's panic as friends and relatives started dying.  However, if you want a thorough account of the 1918 Influenza Pandemic, I would suggest reading Gina Kolata's ""Flu"" and ""The Forgotten Pandemic"" (can't remember the author--sorry).  There are other books out there as well.
Overall, I liked this documentary because it takes you back to a time when doctors and scientists were new to viruses.  Recommended.",1010275200,15,587,4.938775510204081
1212909,5,B00000FELM,Very Very good.  Used it at work for my Flu Vaccine Campaign.,1434326400,,61,4.083333333333333

1212914,5,B00000FELM,Excellent documentary on the flu pandemic of 1918; Sad but an excellent documentary,1406937600,,83,5.461538461538462
1212915,4,B00000FELM,"Probably no other historical event occurred in the United States that been forgotten in time as the plague of influenza that struck first in the U.S. and then Europe in 1918. Yet It killed around 600,000 Americans by the time the flu subsided and 30 million people around the world. It was even noted in the ""American Experience- Influenza 1918"" documentary that more Americans died during that epidemic then all the American soldiers who died in all the wars we fought during the 20th century.

Before viewing this DVD I was a little bit aware of the influenza outbreak of 1918 but the information included in this ""American Experience"" episode really brought to life just what was occurring during that time. What really helped to bring this account to life was the interviews with people (who were young children at the time) of what it was like to live during that time. Their recounting of what occurred makes watching this DVD interesting. Especially as they talk about family members coming down with the deadly influenza and even in a couple of cases themselves becoming sick from the flu. It looks at the hopelessness that doctors and government officials were going through as they tried to figure out what was causing the outbreak and how they could stop it. The documentary also looks at the hysteria that was happening in American society as they tried to do what they could to control the situation and prevent the spread of the influenza to their town.

I have read some of the reviews for this documentary saying that some of the facts may be incorrect in telling this story. That may be but as a history nerd myself I would still recommend to anyone to watch this program. Some of the facts might be wrong but the telling of human suffering and emotional strain people were going through at that time as the death count kept rising is what this documentary is all about.",1406851200,2,1887,4.697885196374623
1212916,3,B00000FELM,"As with most of the documentaries in this PBS series, it is very high quality.  I understand that it's called ""The American Experience,"" but still, it seemed really limited without at least some global context.  I presume it struck Canada and Mexico, but one would have no clue about that here.  It was called at the time ""the Spanish Flu"" because it was first reported there, but, again, no mention of that.  The interviews were the best part because of the vivid memories that those people provided.  In sum, a solid-plus work, wounded by its exclusively provincial focus.",1404691200,,574,4.816326530612245
1212917,4,B00000FELM,"A good documentary for someone interested in this, but a little slow for students.",1404691200,,82,4.928571428571429
1212918,5,B00000FELM,Incorporates many first-hand interviews with survivors.  Also includes interviews with scientific authorities on the origins and attributes of the 1918 strain.,1402185600,,159,6.571428571428571
1213016,5,B00000FELM,I used this in a 9th grade history class.  We were studying the Justinian Plague and the Black Plague and I used this to help them understand just what it was really like to be in that situation.  They were appalled that it had happened so recently and it really brought it home to them that it could happen again any time again.  Very effective.,1399939200,,346,4.292307692307692
1213017,5,B00000FELM,"Besides covering this epidemic and its effects on individuals and groups this film explores the fact that something so devastating does not exist in the national memory. I have family members who were old enough to remember it and who must have known friends and family who died, but I never heard it mentioned or discussed. This is very hard to understand. I recommend watching this film and then, if you know anyone who lived then, asking them about it.",1397520000,3,455,4.7
1213018,5,B00000FELM,"I had some misconceptions about the Great Flu Outbreak of 1918. For one thing, I thought that the disease originated in Europe and was spread in the United States after the Armistice, but it would seem as if the opposite is the case: troops had been exposed to the virus in the U.S. prior to deploying to Europe... with devastating effect. Influenza not only caused more casualties than combat deaths among Americans but also spread to the British, French and, yes, German armies.  Eventually it would spread all across Europe (as an aside, my understanding is that Russia was particularly hard-hit).

The Army camps were hit at first in the U.S., even as battles continued to rage in Europe. Then it began to infect the civilian population. Spread by airborne contact, it overwhelmed many of the government agencies meant to contain it. Medical science could do nothing, despite all the wonderful strides it had made over the recent decades.

This film is very well done, with interviews of some survivors (all of whom were children at the time) and modern scientists. Some excellent contemporary film footage and period photographs make the production very educational and entertaining as well. Also, excerpts read of some of the people who caught the disease or were involved in the desperate struggle to contain it really brings this topic to life.

I can't rate this highly enough.",1387497600,3,1386,4.961206896551724
1213019,4,B00000FELM,"This film was a real eye opener to how vulnerable we are to disease and how lucky we are to live in the 21st century. I recommend every history buff watch the film.  I wonder why I had never heard about this terrible epidemic  in history books at school.

 You will want to get your flu shot and wish everyone did.",1384128000,,314,4.098360655737705
1213020,5,B00000FELM,"The 1918 flu was a tragic moment in American history and this dvd shows that very well , how a virus and flu a microbe can kill millions of people spreading across the earth quickly worse than any war .The 1918 infuenza  is a warning what could happen with the current avian flu which is a threat now. Highly recommended dvd and interesting  documentary.",1374364800,,354,4.515625
1213021,5,B00000FELM,I had a Great Aunt that died from the Influenza of 1918 so whatever I have found about it has mean't something to me. I would Highly Recommend seeing this movie because it is really do interesting! It has quality thru out it and I would Highly Recommend it!,1364688000,,257,4.26530612244898
1213022,5,B00000FELM,"I was very pleased with this episode. The problem with documentaries such as this is time. There is a lot to be told in a short amount of time. If you want true in-depth information, then I recommend a book. However if you want a visual, and seeing people who lived through it, then this is the one you want.

This documentary interviews several living survivors, which of course were children at the time of the pandemic. They share their memories, the loss of their family and friends, as well as their pain. There are photographs of overcrowded hospitals, reminiscent of the hospital scene in Gone With the Wind.

One adult surviving victim recorded her tribulation and her writings describe the absolute pain and suffering she went through. I am a nurse and have worked for 23 years. She shared something that I had never even heard of, in all of those years. I had to look it up. I won't spoil it for you, but let's just say she went through 'hell on earth'.

I do want to make a correction though. One reviewer wrote how the second wave was not at all mentioned, in this episode. That is incorrect because it most definitely was. It's important for me to say that because I'd hate for anyone to ignore this, thinking that were true. Perhaps the reviewer saw another documentary and confused it with this one (there is no verified purchase, so that seems likely). Anyway, I just wanted to make that point.

All in all, this is a very moving, if not frightening, episode of the great American Experience series. I highly recommend it.",1360281600,2,1538,4.561594202898551
1213023,5,B00000FELM,"Influenza is still a very difficult disease to fight, due to its very nature as a viral illness. In 1918-1919 it killed more people than the massive slaughterhouse of Europe's trench warfare did for the years that proceeded it. The family legend is that my mom's dad got it when he joined the US ARMY near the end of the war (lied about his age). Happily, he survived. Not all did.",1359331200,,381,4.380281690140845
1213024,4,B00000FELM,"The documentary treated the terrifying aspects of the outbreak, but it failed to address issues of the disease after late 1918.  My grandparents died two weeks apart in late January and early February of 1919, leaving three sons and a one month old daughter and were far from being the only casualties post 1918.",1358640000,,312,4.777777777777778
1213025,5,B00000FELM,"Very  informative. Had heard about it , but didn't know that much. Video quality is great. Price was very good. That influenced my purchases.",1355616000,,141,4.875
1213102,5,B00000FELM,"The year 1918 was not good to America or the rest of the world - about 30 million died from the flu, including about 550,000 in the U.S. Both numbers exceed the deaths experienced in all wars. The 1918 flu first appeared at Ft. Riley, Kansas in March. About 100 were hospitalized the first day, and the toll rose from there. Then, almost as suddenly as it first appeared, the flu disappeared, only to reappear in Europe when the U.S. began sending soldiers there for WWI. Experts believe that the virus had mutated by then, and was more deadly.

In the U.S., soldiers carried it from base to base. Death was common within hours. War activities (parades, increased manufacturing, and the movement of troops) acerbated its spread. Quarantines were tried, only to be undermined by mailmen and other transporters. Vaccines were tried, but the flu was virus-caused, not from germs. Those aged 21 - 29 were reportedly most vulnerable.

By November the flu began fading - it had run out of susceptible victims; those still alive had also developed a resistance.",1305331200,,1054,4.81767955801105
1213103,4,B00000FELM,"From time to time the US and the world face outbreaks of disease that threaten to become pandemic before effective scientific measures and cures can be put in place.  AIDS, for instance, remains a grave health problem globally, but it appears to be under control in the developed nations.  This may lead some to forget the deadly impact of bacterial and virus-driven diseases.  ""American Experience-Influenza, 1918,"" available from Amazon, reminds us of our ever present vulnerability to the whims of biological mutations and by extension to biological warfare.  Highly recommended.",1298592000,3,582,5.433333333333334
1213104,5,B00000FELM,"This was a very interesting look into a terrible time in American history.  The history of Influenza in 1918 is literally a horror story, and this documentary gave some first hand accounts of that time.",1293753600,2,202,4.771428571428571
1213105,5,B00000FELM,"This is an incredible DVD! I had known that my grandfather died of the ""flu"" in 1918...but never realized the full impact of this! He was only 29 years old. Now, having a 29 year old son & threat of a pandemic H1H1 flu, I became interested in this mysterious & deadly pandemic of the past.
Although it is very sad & painful to watch in parts, you will be sitting on the edge of your seat watching this. It is amazing that so MANY people are no longer aware of this tragedy. It prompted me to visit my grandfather's grave. I found that his name had never been engraved on the family stone. His brother-in-law had also passed at the same time & was in an unmarked grave as well. I had their names put on the stone last October. Probably never would have been aware or prompted to do this if it weren't for this DVD. Hoping their rest is more peaceful now!

1213106,5,B00000FELM,"This documentary gives us an excellent account of the 1918 flu epidemic that came upon us quite mysteriously and always eluded the best efforts of medicine and science to cure people afflicted with it or inoculate those who were still well. The archival footage and the still photos from that era are very, very good; and the interviews with now elderly survivors of the epidemic are so well done that they truly bring this horrible nightmare to vivid life in all its grotesqueness. The story moves along at a very good pace and I was never bored; although this only lasts one hour, they always made it a very human portrayal of the problem and it never felt rushed. The script for the narrators was well written, too.

When the film starts, we see America as it was not too long after the turn of the century; we were a young nation already emerging as a world leader. Our sense of strength and invulnerability was shattered when the flu came upon us seemingly out of nowhere. The film discusses one possibility that the flu epidemic may have started with a few military soldiers in Kansas; but to this day they're not completely certain of that. What we do know is that this strain of the flu killed people who were thought to be most resistant to flu--young people in their 20s although many others, of course, got the flu and did not survive. We also see the flu as it impacted on both sides fighting the First World War in Europe (especially France) and the story is rather grim.

Of course, there's much, much more to this story but I will stop here; I don't want to spoil it for you.

The DVD comes with a link to a teacher's guide in the form of a PDF file; you can access this from a DVD-ROM drive. There's also a link to the PBS website.

Overall, this fine documentary tells the story of a horror that caused the uncontrollable deaths of hundreds of thousands of people. I recommend this for people studying American history, the history of medicine in general; and documentaries about the human experience.",1263168000,6,2018,4.52054794520548
1213107,5,B00000FELM,"This 50-minute video packs in a lot of facts about this event that keeps one wondering when another pandemic of such a caliber could strike again.

We were a developing country with a lead in science.  We had discovered the cure for polio, cholera, diphtheria.  We were sure we could fight any other diseases that came our way.

We were wrong.

This strain struck our soldiers at Fort Riley toward the end of WWI.  Soldiers were falling ill fast from this virus and doctors had no idea what was killing off our troops.  We had troops to send overseas on large, crowded troop transporters, where the air-borne virus would easily spread and infect an entire carrier in a few days.  This pandemic killed more Americans than all our wars in the 20th century and over 30 million world-wide, thanks to developing aircraft transportation used for the war effort.  Almost every family on the eastern seaboard, especially Philadelphia, was affected. People were literally dropping dead in the streets. Scientists didn't have powerful enough microscopes yet to detect this virus, and thus had no way to develop an anti-virus for this strain.  The electron-microscope had not been invented yet.

Interviews with survivors, elderly who lost family members or childhood friends, scientists are interviewed for this poignant production.  Scenes of white curtains blowing in gentle window breezes add a touch of suspense to this video; one feels how traumatic the 1918 flu strain was to everyone alive at the time.  And this video haunts your brain for days later.

So why, if this was such a traumatic event, did this event fall out of our collective conscienceness?  Because, as one scientist explains, this was so traumatic an event that people would prefer to forget about it, although it lingers in the back of everyone's mind.

Do NOT watch this video if you are feeling sick, especially if you have bronchial problems.  It may haunt you too much.",1259452800,3,1938,4.932098765432099
1213108,5,B00000FELM,Excellent film.  Real history of those terrible days both overseas and here at home.
