8703495,5,B00TZ8WK42,"By the time the first 5 minutes of this movie was over, I'd been treated to a disfigured hunchback, body builders with whacky mustaches, and a particularly good looking British woman pretending to be a local Indian girl despite looking like she thought kidneys belonged in pies doing random musical sequences that turn out to be commercials for various products that exist in the movie. It's the KMart Blue Light Special writing style applied to film but without all the pretense and lack of fun. It might be the only movie I'll ever watched that involves BMX kung fu fights in random Chinese villages after acid attacks and musical set pieces with an Aladdin meets Beauty and the Beast theme (again with the dishy Brit), which also had kung fu fights (angels and demons can't get along). All of this is in the same film!

For all the disjointed nature of everything I said above because this is Michael Bay combined with Walt Disney and Alejandro Jodorwowsky. It hangs together rather well. It makes sense (as much as it can) in film. It's actually good film making and whoever did the color correction should get a medal for having probably worked the most hours. By the end once you've gotten through some cheesiness, craziness, and genuinely out there film making, you'll probably have enjoyed yourself or at least will appreciate have seen something genuinely unique.",1426636800,,1372,4.8382978723404255
