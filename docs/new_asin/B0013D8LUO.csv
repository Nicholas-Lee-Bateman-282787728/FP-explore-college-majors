I'm with the other poster who said she only watched this due to SPF. It delivered in that regard. His acting was well-done as always, and for those who care, he's shirtless in a couple of scenes.

I think Ted Manson stole the show though as the grandfather. The scene where he's trying to get the preacher to go away is pure gold. Actually, I think it's the best scene in the whole film.

The story-line itself is...just okay...I felt like there was too much going on for one movie, and a lot of the characters don't get properly explored so that I can care about the things I'm supposed to care about. We get hints about different characters and who they are, but we only get hints until something major happens. The sister is a somewhat stereotypical rebel with her single streak of blue hair. Her boyfriend rides a motorcycle and doesn't go to church, so he must be bad news. Oh, it turns out he is. The ""certified asswiper"" Danielle is (again stereotypical) white trash struggling to take care of her baby and hold down a job. However, since she seems to care about said job so little, it's hard to feel sorry for her. Heck, she's even willing to give away her baby just so she can take her ex (Mr. Motorcycle) back, because he's not ready for children.

Then, there's the almost glacial pace the movie moves at for about the first 45 minutes. Scene transitions could have been done so much better and there are places begging for background music/noise. In addition, Emily Carpenter's acting wavers between okay and atrocious. It seems like she wrote/produced the movie and cast herself as the lead. Bad move.

Even with all of that, the biggest problem in this movie for me was that there wasn't a clear point. All movies need to have some sort of theme/point even if it's understated. Is it that cheating on your husband is okay as long as the guy is attractive with a cool car? If you think a man is attractive, stalk him and he'll totes fall for you? If you do everything wrong, some white trash woman will just show up and hand you the thing you've always wanted? The only thing that seems to show up as a message in this comes in a little line the reverend has about grace nearly at the very end of the movie...that you can find grace no matter where you are in life (in the river or on the banks). It's a beautiful sentiment, but it doesn't seem to apply to anyone but Davie and maybe her sister. Everyone else still seems properly graceless.

Speaking of Davie, I got so frustrated with her characterization, I wanted to slap her. Being sad about the miscarriages was one thing and it was justified, but the affair she starts with Clay was just... There was nothing wrong with her husband. He tells her he loves her and they seem happy. He tries to do what he can when she loses the baby. He doesn't force her to have sex. He might nudge her a little bit, but jeeze, there's nothing wrong with wanting to have sex with your wife. When she refuses, he does his best to be understanding. He puts together picnics in the living room. Even when they argue, it's not that bad. The two don't really start arguing until she starts to notice Clay, and I felt like that bit of storytelling was a bit contrived. The writing didn't start painting the husband as bad until it wanted to justify Davie's affair. The worst thing he ever says to her comes after he realizes she's kindling something with sexy neighbor boy. He says that it's hard to listen to someone's problems after 10 years of marriage. I'm sure it is. It's hard for me to listen to someone's problems after 10 weeks if it's the same crap over and over again. It might be a little insensitive, but so is lusting after another man when you're married.

Speaking of which, that's pretty much all she has with Clay early on: lust. The writing cheats and tries to say things about how he listens to her, but you never actually see that happening until long after she's essentially begun the affair. It starts with her meeting him half-naked in a bed (facilitated by grandpa) and then her watching him through the window as he jogs and takes his shirt off. Then she starts to follow him, which he totally knows about for two weeks before saying something, and that's the point they actually have a conversation.

I could go on and on about the flaws, but I'll leave it there. Anyway, even with the long rambles about the bad stuff, the movie does have some nice moments. I think it's worth a watch if you have the time and are willing to wade through the first half of it to get to the ""good stuff."" Or if you just want to see SPF shirtless a few more times. :-p",1365379200,4,4645,4.405594405594406
