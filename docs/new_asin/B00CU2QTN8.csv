8586298,5,B00CU2QTN8,"Great pacing/realism, good scripts, wonderful acting.  Mikael Persbrandt would be perfect as the next James Bond. He's got the right qualities-- haunted by his past, understated until he springs into action--at which point he becomes quite fearsome.",1524009600,,249,5.72972972972973

8586300,3,B00CU2QTN8,"Fans of Gunvald in Beck - outstanding actor and great script.  This one disappointed us.  Not fans of espionage, shoot-me-ups.  We do enjoy foreign police/crime/mysteries.  Hope he gets a better part - he's way too talented to appear in this kind of series.",1501459200,,257,4.906976744186046
8586301,5,B00CU2QTN8,"It has english subtitles. I had been going thru persbrandt withdrawal since he left beck. This is a wonderful addition to my collection. Not only is he eye candy, but just solidifies the fact that he has great range, and a great post beck career waiting for him. Well written script, and very good supporting actors",1497657600,3,315,4.642857142857143
8586302,5,B00CU2QTN8,"Any reviews stating there are no English subtitles on this DVD are incorrect.  I took a chance because the product description stated Swedish with English subtitles and that the DVD was released in March 2017.  There ARE English subtitles on both movies, and for those like us who dearly loved the Gunvald character in Beck and have been missing him, these movies will not disappoint.  Lots of action, Mikael Persbrandt plays the lead character with perfection, and WITH the English subtitles this DVD set is definitely a great purchase.  Try it.  You will be pleased.",1494374400,4,568,4.936842105263158
8586303,5,B00CU2QTN8,"Mikael Persbrandt (Det. Gunvald Larsson in BECK) stars as Commander Carl Hamilton, the Swedish spy who will do anything -- anything -- in the interest of his nation's defense. This is no flash and dazzle Bond or Bourne film; this is the real thing, the down-and-dirty, nitty gritty actions of a field operative and the memories that haunt him. This is Persbrandt's greatest performance. I watched it on MhzChoice with English subtitles and was blown away by the realism and how reflex action can have unexpected consequences for the best of us.

Carl Hamilton, a spy for a secret agency within peace-loving Swedens Military Intelligence and Security Service, is the hero of a dozen novels by Swedish investigative journalist and author Jan Guillou. Guillou, in 1973, published a series of articles exposing a Swedish secret intelligence agency. He was convicted of espionage and served a reduced sentence of 10 months. In 1976, he also exposed a CIA agent who had recruited another Swedish journalist as a spy. The CIA agent was ordered out of Sweden. In 1986, Guillou created his fictional spy, Carl Hamilton. These are not American-oriented novels, but provide another world perspective where supposed enemies, Russians or the PLO, can be your best ally. Unfortunately, only one of the Hamilton novels is available in English:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Enemy-s-Enemy/dp/0394589890/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Enemy's Enemy</a>.

8586304,1,B00CU2QTN8,How can you sell a dvd that has only Swedish or German dialogue and only German subtitles as an option? Couldn't somebody think of adding English subtitles to broaden its appeal?,1455062400,4,178,4.774193548387097

8586306,5,B00CU2QTN8,"The DVD of this film, HAS NO ENGLISH AUDIO OR SUBTITLES. But I recently watched it on Acorn TV (a great BBC/European TV/Movie streaming service available for only $5.00 a month!). Mikael Persbrandt from the ""Beck"" TV show stars as Agent Hamilton--the Swedish 007 and he is great. Hamilton doesn't have a ""license to Kill"" like 007, but that doesn't stop him from kicking butt, taking names, and killing folks for ""god & Country"". Like any good spy film, you get car chases, fistfights, gun play, and Women in distress. If you like Mikael Persbrandt--you will love this film",1433808000,8,573,4.797979797979798
