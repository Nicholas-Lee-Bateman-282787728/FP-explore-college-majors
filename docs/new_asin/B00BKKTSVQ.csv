8569981,5,B00BKKTSVQ,"Have several of the virtual Active Runs , everyone offers something different in types of runs and places always done really well and love that you can do a guided coaching option or a basic run with no coaching on the dvds.  I really love the long climb on this one it's a beautiful setting getting to the top to keep you motivated",1397174400,,332,4.26984126984127
8569982,2,B00BKKTSVQ,Some of the runs are ok and some are not that great. Could have picked some more beautiful parts of New Zealand...there are plenty! The narrator is an American who can't seem to correctly pronounce the locations!,1389312000,,212,4.756756756756757
8569983,5,B00BKKTSVQ,I am a total nature buff and fell in love with the South Island New Zealand Run dvd.  This one is actually better.  I can't see me getting bored with it.,1377043200,,153,3.903225806451613
