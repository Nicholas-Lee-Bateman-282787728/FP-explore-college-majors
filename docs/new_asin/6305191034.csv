7884847,5,6305191034,"This tape, a two parter from the first season of this show tells the story of a tight knit group of mercenaries doing black bag ops for the Pentagon. Brad Johnson stars as the leader of this group. The very beautiful Melinda Clarke is very believable as the butt kicking co-team leader. The team is sent to South America to extract the kidnapped daughter of a drug kingpin turning state's evidence. The team has been sold out and there are injuries, some serious. Finger pointing, accusations, and hard feelings almost tear the group apart. But being the top notch American fighting personnel that they are, they pull together to accomplish the mission. One hour and forty four minutes of pure adventure. Strap yourself in and enjoy this well acted, well written, excellently researched show.",1046736000,,792,4.917910447761194
