6085804,5,B00GM1X2JM,Video is very good and the entire episodes are shown.  Too bad there are some missing episodes.  This show was long overdue for a DVD release.,1390176000,,142,4.423076923076923
6085805,5,B00GM1X2JM,"I'm so happy they have finally decided to release the remaining seasons!!!!  For those critics out there who are warning people that episodes are missing....HOLD YOUR BREATH.  There is a VERY CLEAR disclaimer in the description that states there are episodes missing.  There is no need to warn since this this studio obviously isn't trying to hide anything.

I LOVED all of my sets, thats correct no spelling errors at all.

Just wanted to give a fair review...",1389225600,8,461,4.858974358974359
6085806,3,B00GM1X2JM,This appears to be inherent in all these DVD releases of this series. Episodes titles are sometimes so badly messed up grammatically and with spelling errors that it is a little difficult at times to realize what the episode really is named. I get the feeling that a bunch of grade school kids were hired for the job of writing the package descriptions.,1388188800,5,353,4.619047619047619

6085809,5,B00GM1X2JM,"Good quality in picture and sound for a show that is more than 20 years old. The only drawback is that there are 2 episodes from this season that were not included in this set, and one of them, ""Sweet, Sweet Blues"", was one of my favorites and the reason I bought this season in the first place.

6085840,3,B00GM1X2JM,"I am finding this season not to be that interesting.  The southern accents, flower dresses and focus on Bubba has gotten old.  In past seasons it seemed like the focus was on everybody in the cast.  In this season and the previous one it seems the focus was Bubba.  Bubba is built but he is not good looking enough to give him all the storylines.  The show should have given focus to all the cast, not just Bubba and the chief.  Though Hugh Oconnor sometime was the Foucault, they never explained y he didn't have a girlfriend, same for Parker and swede.  Also they didn't explain y dee and louann didn't have boyfriends.",1416268800,,621,4.442477876106195

6085848,5,B00GM1X2JM,In my opinion in the heat of the night is one of the best police shows of the last 80 and early 90s. The cast enhanced the shows quality of a small southern town. The story lines were also well written so the whole family could enjoy them. Sadly this is not the case with some television programs today.,1411516800,4,303,4.1525423728813555

You can't say that with a lot of other shows out there on DVD, so I give it 5 stars for that off the top.  Audio is also crystal clear.  I take away one star for the three missing episodes (kept out due to clearance issues).  I believe they could have found a way to work around those issues, as other shows on DVD have, but anyway, it's still worth the buy in my view, and very much so.",1390867200,,500,4.344086021505376

In  one  episode  a  man  stalks  his  ex  wife  when  he  learns  she's  going  out  with  other  guys  &  he  takes  offence  to  what  she's  doing.
I  have  had  no  problems  with  the  DVD's.  The  quality  is  excellent.  There  might  not  be  any  subtitles.  So  I  guess  as  long  as  I  never  lose  my  hearing  I'm  fine.",1529193600,,653,4.111111111111111
