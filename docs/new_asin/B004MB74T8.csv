4429599,5,B004MB74T8,How to Train your Dragon is one of my all time favorite movies and to have a little mini movie is a great way to keep the story going. I would recommend this to anyone who loves this movie.,1360800000,,189,3.871794871794872
4429600,5,B004MB74T8,My grandchildren love the Dragon series and watch them all.  I was unaware of this particular one until recently.  They watched it and wanted more.  I am really happy that cartoon network has decided to make a series on these stories cause there is something about the characters that make it fun to watch and connect to.  I find myself sitting and watching it with them and see that they have a moral and children can learn and even see themselves in the movies.  It's a great series and highly recommend it.,1348185600,,509,4.489130434782608
4429601,4,B004MB74T8,"Great buy! Highly entertaining, and it includes bonus features for the original movie too. Would definately recommend for any Dragons fans!",1325808000,5,139,5.666666666666667
4429602,2,B004MB74T8,"This straight to dvd ""sequel"" is poorly done and only about 15 minutes long. Definitely not what fans of the original were probably expecting and unless you read the information on the back of the DVD carefully---probably not what you were expecting either.

Definitely not worth your money. I'd stick to the original film.",1324857600,3,323,4.981481481481482
4429603,5,B004MB74T8,"Only 16 minutes? Actually, it's 16 1/2 minutes to the end of the credits, but it's more entertaining than many full length movies.  Plus, the extra features bring the DVD closer to an hour.

In this augmentation to the original movie, no one believes the BoneKnapper dragon exists, and they especially don't believe Gobber's stories that said dragon has singled him out for a lifetime of torment! Still, the kids dutifully go with Gobber to avenge years of destruction blamed on the legend.

With a mixture of computer animation and cartoon flashbacks, we see Gobber's story from both ends.  It's a fun tail of unspeakable treasure, frozen vikings trapped in a glacier that punch you in the face, hammerhead sharks, a hammerhead yak, a hammerhead whale, a hammerhead yak riding a hammerhead whale...making the kids doubt Gobber more with every word, until...

If you're the type where length matters, and you'd rather have long and boring than short, funny and exciting, don't bother with this DVD.  For the rest of you, I recommend it.",1323820800,10,1036,4.925287356321839
4429604,4,B004MB74T8,"While it is super short, it was super fun to watch.  I would buy it again.  My kids really enjoyed watching it, and we've watched it over and over.  It doesn't really teach any lessons like the original movie, it's just for fun. :)",1323129600,6,231,4.204545454545454
4429605,1,B004MB74T8,"It is extremely shameful that the sellers of this product are charging as much as they are, and the DVD is only 16-minutes long.  I didn't buy the DVD, but actually watched it over at a friend's house who got the DVD when he purchased the combo 2-dvd pack.  Sellers are charging for this DVD as if it was a regular made-for-TV movie and it isn't.  Don't buy this DVD online, but go someplace else like a bargain basement store for this DVD, because it is not worth getting it at regular price.",1317686400,6,493,4.279569892473118
4429606,1,B004MB74T8,"I believe this was the second dvd in the two pack of How To Train Your Dragon.  It is only 16 minutes long, it is not a new made for dvd movie, please don't be fooled like I was.  The sellers should be ashamed of themselves for not mentioning the length of this dvd and letting people know exactly what this was.",1303862400,49,312,4.016129032258065

4429609,2,B004MB74T8,"Being a dragon fan,I had to get this really short film,and I mean short I should have done more research on this but I didn't so what I wound up with was a artists rendition of a pencil drawing and some animation, the riders were there but not the dragons and it was a artists rendition of what was to come, shame on dream works for fooling us on this one. But all in all my collection is just about complete, the price for this was to say expensive so if your not a dragon fan don't waste your money.",1414886400,,501,4.02

4429620,1,B004MB74T8,"I made the mistake of ordering all 3 previous ""How to Train Your Dragon"" movies and was so disappointed. They were over shortly after they began. I thought what a rip off!!!! I won't make the same mistake again by purchasing this one. Buyer beware.",1395964800,,248,4.533333333333333

4429623,4,B004MB74T8,"This movie unfortunately does not star Toothless. The main story centers around Gobber and all the Viking kids. It is a short movie, about 20 minutes, but there are tons of extras, such as a ""quiz"" to determine the type of Viking you are and your Viking name!! Quite a bit of fun for us adults too.",1366416000,,298,4.245614035087719
4429624,4,B004MB74T8,"This is a bonus CD that came with the deluxe release of the movie.  As such, the BoneKnapper cartoon is short, but was priced accordingly so I am pleased",1365033600,,153,4.275862068965517
4429625,5,B004MB74T8,"This movie was totally worth buying. They voice cast from the original movie is back. Don't expect any dragons that you already know. Toothless, Meatlug, Stormfly, Barf, and Belch are not in it. Not counting credits it's thirteen minutes. I'm not sure why they didn't just make it a little longer and put it in the television series. I think that would've been better had they done that. I don't know why everybody is so upset about the 2D animation. I thought it was hilarious.",1363737600,2,478,4.635294117647059
4429626,4,B004MB74T8,"A fun story with keeping with the original movie, but beware it is not entirely 3d digital animation. Still enjoyable though.",1361318400,,125,5.0

8435898,5,B004MB74T8,"I bought the complete series for my grandchildren. Christmas Gifts they were Delighted.  Once you watch the 1st movie is a must to buy the complete series then watch the 2nd/ last movie.  WOW it truly filed in a lot of missing parts that are not in the 1st and 2nd/last movie.
Highly Recommend buying the complete series especially if you already own the 1st and 2nd/ last movie.  Watching them all in order was truly Amazing it filed in a lot of missing information on how and why things happen as they did.
Grandchildren and Parents including yes Mimi we had a Blast.",1484265600,,569,4.451923076923077

8435902,1,B004MB74T8,For $14.50 was not worth it....was only 18 minutes long. I have bought others and be 240 minutes long for same price. Would not recommend buying at this price,1437264000,,158,4.482758620689655
