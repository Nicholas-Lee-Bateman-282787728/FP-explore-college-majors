2259738,5,B0008KLV8W,"Yay! I'm so excited for this DVD to come out! As a true fan of FOP (""Fairly Odd Parents""), I am especially interested in this upcoming, hour-long special. It is supposidly like a longer episode of the show, only most of it is in song! I know of about 5 or 6 songs that are sung in this special, but I've only heard a rough clip of one over the internet. Apparently, Timmy gets sick of adults always ordering him around, so he wishes that kids could rule the world! His fairies have to grant his wishes, of course, so they do, and it's a perfect world... @ least, for a while. Then somehow the pixies try to take over Fairy World, I forget how. Anyway, I have only heard these things, since this episode will air in the U. S. A. a few days before this DVD comes out. But I can't wait! I think it may very well be one of the absolute best FOPs ever!!! :)",1112745600,,852,4.047337278106509
2259739,5,B0008KLV8W,"Fairly Oddparents is a success for Nick, and rightly so. It belongs to the second generation of Nick's attempts to renovate and revive cartoons. The first generation brought Rugrats, Doug, Ah! Real Monsters, and Ren and Stimpy. With the second generation came Fairly Oddparents, Invader Zim, and a few others. All of which have a unique look, witty writing, and which generally raised the bar for TV 'toons. Similar efforts were underway at Cartoon Network, Fox Kids, and Disney, and each studio has produced cartoons with production values which far exceed anything from a few decades ago.

One not very bright spot has been the effort to create longer cartoon specials and direct to video home DVDs. There are several reasons for that. One, a longer feature helps other studios fill in the space occupied by Disney cinema animation. Two, it provides material for shows like Cartoon Network's Cartoon Theater. Three, it provides a way to directly market already profitable TV shows or movies with direct to video sequels and follow-ups. Nick, for instance, refers to its cartoons as a Nick brand, and attempts to group its products under the well-known orange Nick logo in the manner that Disney does with its own name through its Buena Vista distribution division.

None of which has anything to do with this musical, except to say that it somewhat plays against type. The previous TV animation features I've seen, usually running around an hour, have all been inferior to the regular TV cartoons. Here's the exception. The reason it's an exception is because it's a musical, a lively, likeable, witty one. The songs are Pinky and the Brain smart and Disney singable. The long version is that School's Out: The Musical manages to combine everything that makes Fairly OddParents such a great cartoon, while adding musical moments that stretch, without thinning, the show. Not only that,  but the story is essentially a kid-friendly version of Aldous Huxley's SF novel, Brave New World. In short, it's a hit.",1217116800,,2008,5.005988023952096
2259740,4,B0008KLV8W,"Although it came very late and do not include portuguese language or subtitles, it is a very good show.",1184198400,,103,4.473684210526316
2259741,5,B0008KLV8W,The Pixies (Ben Stein) are hilarious in this dvd.  The kids love it.  The music is great and so is the story.  It's better than full feature movies put out by the studios.,1131753600,,171,4.121212121212121
2259742,5,B0008KLV8W,"""It also had cool musical numbers like ""Kids Just Being Kids,"" ""Flappy's Song,"" ""Adults Ruin Everything,"" ""Timmy's Song,"" ""The Pixie Rap,"" ""Where Is The Fun?,"" ""As Long As I'm Floating With You,"" ""Unfun Parentals,"" ""Let's Get Fun,"" and ""Kids Just Being Kids Reprise.""

Whoever wrote that review was wrong... well those are the songs, but not their correct names. And that might confuse some of you a bit! I'm sorry but I'm a HUGE Fairly Oddparents freak and if someone calls my two favorite songs by their wrong names I get mad. Here's an overview of all the songs (and there real names!)

Kids Just Being Kids-School's just out for the Summer and Timmy and his classmates are just being kids and destroying the town while having fun.

Flappy's Song-Flappy Bob, owner of Flappy Bob's peppy happy camp learn-a-torium is trying to convice the parents that for all their worries to end the kids should go there, so he can make money and have a kid free world.

Adults Ruin Everything-The pixies convince Timmy that adults are the cause to all his problems, and timmy tells us how everything bad is because of adults so he wishes kids could rule the world.

Pixies Rap-Just a song... really no point... explains how the pixies made a plan to take over fairy world by using flappy and timmy.

Timmy's Song-Timmy has become the president of kid world and he describes how he's going to make everything better by assigning jobs and having ""candy for breakfast and ice cream for lunch!""

Jorgen's Polka-Jorgen Von Strangle tells Cosmo and Wanda about how shocked he was to see kids had all the power, and so now he has to take all the fairies away from the kisd since they're in no need of them.

Hey Flappy Bob-Here's the song I was upset about... it is not called ""where is the fun?"" as most people believe... it's called ""Hey Flappy Bob"" and it's the best song in the whole musical! Plus it's totally addictive. Timmy tries to convice Flappy that the Pixies are using him and that flappy needs to decide whether to trust timmy or the pixies to find what fun really is. ""Who is the one? The one I can trust to tell me what's fun!?""

I'm Floating With You-Cosmo and Wanda's song about how Cosmo and Wanda met and got married etc. It also expresses how much they really love eachother. If you really want to know how they met, listen to Wanda's half of the song because Cosmo only talks about it for two lines then goes on to talk about how dumb he is.

Unfundamentals-Yet another mishap... its not called ""Unfun Parentals"" doi cuz the fairies don't really have parentals (except Cosmo.) It's an unfundamental meaning it is the opposite of fun. This song talks about how now that Flappy bob rules the world how everything is unfun and boring.

Hey Flappy Bob Reprise-This is pretty much every single song from the show (except Jorgen's song and the fairies songs) wrapped into one. It talks about how Flappy and Timmy are going to make everything fun again!

Kids Just Being Kids Reprise-Once the world is back to normal the kids have fun and become theirselves again. Too bad Flappy Bob's Learnatorium has now become Gary and Betty's Learnatorium. (you remember happy peppy gary and happy peppy betty?) Well Timmy wants to make the place fun so they end it with song!",1123372800,3,3260,4.6017241379310345
