2811952,5,B000P6R6Y2,I have been a C.K. fan since I first saw him on comedy central. I have to say this is some of his funniest material. He really doesn't hold back and doesn't allow any topic to hold him back. I can watch this over and over again and still be rolling over laughing at each bit... which is very rare for comedians these days. A MUST see... !!

They don't really hurt unless you let them) and I'd imagine that if his daughter (4 years old at the time this was filmed) listens to this set she'll spend years in therapy but aside from all that, he is hilarious and the best comedian we have.

But as we're just audience members and his personal pain and suffering in private doesn't mean a thing to us who really cares?

So I gave him a look. Twice. Just to be fair.

I was not amused. Who is this guy and how did such a boring, disjointed, disgruntled and wry human being become so successful as a comedian? Maybe he's just too highbrow for me? Maybe? Since I like the likes of Kennison, Pryor, Carlin, DeGeneres etc it's possible.

Heck! I can't even describe the guy's style - does he even have a style? Or is it just so unique that it's easily missed.

Well, as soon as I got them I put them in my laptop and watched them in one go.

I have only one word for these: meh.

I've seen Jeff Dunham, Pablo Francisco, Ricky Gervais, Ron White (and the rest of Blue Collar dudes) and others and all of them made me laugh far more than Louis C. K. Sorry, he's just not my type. I feel that he's trying too hard to shock the audience by saying things that we find ""socially unacceptable/questionable"" (some of them and to certain degree) but the fact is, his joke's are more thought-provoking than funny. As a comedian he's not so great (IMHO) but as somebody who can make you stop in your tracks and think a bit about how we usually perceive things, yes, he's good at that.

He had a sharp wit, an even sharper mind and most importantly the courage to say things that most people were too afraid to even hear.  If you are a fan of Mr. Carlin, I assure you that you will not be disappointed.  This is definitely not comedy for the faint of heart or those who are turned off easily by foul language, talk of sex or other ""sensitive"" topics.

He talks about being a middle aged, unattractive, slightly over weight, married man, and how depressing that can be. How annoying his kids are, even though he would die for them.

This DVD is a waste of money and I'm surprised that some people rated it 5 out of 5... it's simply not that funny.

His material is solid and his delivery is spot on. He doesn't jump around and over do it (I am looking at you Dane Cook) he takes his time and hits every mark. His subtle style juxtaposes perfectly against the over the top nature of his jokes.

I laughed so hard I had to pause the DVd and walk around until I could catch my breath. Hours, even days, after watching it I would think about something he said and just start laughing again. It is especially funny if you have kids.

2813544,5,B000P6R6Y2,"Louis CK is by far, my favorite comedian.  I also had the pleasure of seeing him live.  Every instance of his comedy ends up with me crying because I'm laughing so damn hard.

I might add that he's vulgar, but it's so damn funny!  He perfectly places curse words to add to the joke, not take over the joke.

If you don't buy this, you're making a mistake and you will never know what true hilarity is.",1202256000,9,401,4.1558441558441555

2813546,5,B000P6R6Y2,"Louis CK is the funniest comedian that there is.  He is rude, offensive and the best of all HONEST.  I will stop whatever it is that I am doing or go to every show when he is in town, he is that funny and witty.  There is not a funnier DVD out.",1200096000,,244,3.6538461538461537
2813547,5,B000P6R6Y2,Louis CK really blew my mind with this show. Every man out there will guaranteed nod confirmingly many times during this show when Louis talks about situasions that are all true to us. His rant about his wife is priceless! And when he discovers that he has gained weight..I laughed so hard because it's so true. Well deserved 5 stars in my book.,1197158400,,345,4.492063492063492
2813548,5,B000P6R6Y2,"This is some of the funniest stuff I've ever seen.  If you are a fan of standup, you must buy this dvd.  It's a shame Louis is not more well known.  He's truly a comedic genius.  If you are easily offended don't watch this.",1193875200,3,223,4.0

Not for the easily offended or faint of heart.  Louis C.K. tells it like it is and holds nothing back.  I love the impish look when he delivers a good punchline.  He is a modern master of blue comedy.

2813550,5,B000P6R6Y2,"I didn't even hear about Louis CK before this stand-up came out, I wanted to give him a shot. I was completely floored as to how incredibly hilarious he was. I decided to show my brother, who also never heard of him, and to make a long story short, we want to show this comedy special to as many people as we can. Everyone we have shown it to already loves it. You should do the same.",1186963200,,384,4.0
2813551,5,B000P6R6Y2,Yet again another great example of Comedic Genius by Louis C.K.  Louis covers lots of topics and keeps his flow through out the entire DVD; keeping you laughing All Night Long. Well worth the money.,1185840000,3,198,4.6571428571428575
2813552,5,B000P6R6Y2,"I was watching a clip of this earlier while drinking a soda. What a mistake. I literally spat up my soda and choked with laughter. This man is a menace and should be locked up! Seriously, very inventive material, pitch perfect delivery, and a real gift for threading themes throughout long sequences make Louis CK a sure bet. I can't imagine anyone regretting this purchase.",1184889600,17,374,4.769230769230769
