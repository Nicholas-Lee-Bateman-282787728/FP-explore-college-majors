8490590,5,B0060ODUUC,This is my grandon's favorite dvd.  It has beautiful scenery and catchy tunes. I. found myself singing along too.  We watch this dvd daily and never tire of it.  We own several other Brent Holmes dvds such as Sea Tunes and Witty Wacky Wildlife. I would also recommend the Wiggles Ukelele Baby as well.,1509321600,,301,4.537037037037037
8490591,4,B0060ODUUC,A bit more segmented and informative than others in the series. Nice photography and very friendly approach.  My grandchildren are still preschoolers,1373760000,,149,5.7727272727272725
8490592,5,B0060ODUUC,"I have to admit that my kids don't watch a lot of television or videos.  So, I'm picky about what they do watch and I try to have videos on hand that I'm comfortable with them watching and that they'll enjoy.  This DVD fits that bill.  My kids enjoy Brent Holmes' music--all of his silly songs.  They've liked the other videos that they've seen by him as well.  This DVD is his Island Tunes for Kids album with scenes from the Hawaiian Islands.  A young girl introduces each song with some information about the Hawaiian language or culture.  This video would be best for kids ages 1-6 years old, especially for toddlers and preschoolers.

What do I like best about this DVD?  The fun songs and videos of sea life and the Hawaiian Islands.  My kids enjoy it.
Is there anything I don't like?  Well, it seems a little cheesy at times to see Brent Holmes singing overlayed on the background scenes.  But, I know kids wouldn't mind it at all.  The effect is the way a lot of kids dvds are done.  So, I suppose it's really just fine.

If you're looking for a fun gift for a preschooler who likes videos and silly songs (like Laurie Berkner's DVD), then I'd definitely recommend this one.

Please note that I received a complimentary copy of this DVD for review from Brent Holmes.",1354060800,,1274,4.426724137931035
