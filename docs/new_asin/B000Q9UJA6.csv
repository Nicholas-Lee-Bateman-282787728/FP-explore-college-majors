2835054,5,B000Q9UJA6,I find this DVD interesting in its display of human systems and or defects. Our European cousins seem much more advanced in the knowledge and appreciation of the human body. If only,1355702400,,181,4.6875
2835055,5,B000Q9UJA6,"I purchased this because we missed the traveling show at the museum.  Actually, I feel it is likely as good or better than seeing it in person because of the narration.  My grandson was at the age where he was wanting to know about his body.... However... warning... the subject is a little gross as it is real bodies cut in pieces and reconstructed. Some people said they got sick at the museum and had to leave. I don't recommend it for young children unless they really want to be a doctor when they grow up.  Watch it first before you share.",1354579200,,545,4.323529411764706
2835056,5,B000Q9UJA6,"In four languages: English, French, Dutch and German. Witness the exhibition that literally gets under your skin and where nobody can remain indifferent. More than 20 million visitors worldwide have already admired them: the authentic anatomical specimens from Dr. Gunther von Hagens - uniquely beautiful and instructive. Experience a digital reunion with ""The Runner"", ""The Chess Player"", ""The Skin Man"" and other plastinates. Meet the mind behind Body Worlds, his pioneering invention, his work.",1350432000,,497,5.72972972972973
2835057,5,B000Q9UJA6,"I purchased the Body Worlds DVD for a group of medical coders to view during one of our monthly AAPC meetings, everyone seemed to enjoy it and we all learned a bit about anatomy. I would definately recommend this DVD for medical students, coders or anyone who is in the medical field and needs to know/understand anatomy.  A very good eye opener as well!",1331769600,,354,4.53125
2835058,5,B000Q9UJA6,"My wife and I attended the opening of the Body Worlds exhibit in Milwaukee, WI several years ago and were extremely impressed by not only the exhibit, but the reactions of people viewing these extraordinary displays. We have shared our impressions of the Body World Exhibition with several relatives, but unfortunately the full exhibit of Body Worlds has never been available to view in our area. Therefore, we decided to purchase this DVD as a means to supplement our discussion with friends and relatives. One of the most interesting parts of the DVD, for those who have seen the exhibit, is the background and explanation of the process.",1324425600,,640,4.935185185185185
2835059,5,B000Q9UJA6,"It shows real human organs and bodies using cadavers. They have gone through the preserving process called ""plastination"". According to its inventor, Dr. Gunther von Hagens, plastination is "" The process of extracting all bodily fluids and soluble fat from specimens, replacing them through vacuum forced impregnation with reactive resins and elastomers, and then curing them with light, heat, or certain gases, which give the specimens rigidity and permanence"".

Now, I can see human body in details, in color and sharp video. It's unique. Nobody has ever done this before. It's a must for anybody who is learning anatomy. It tremendously satisfies my curiosity.

The only downside is there is no subtitle. That's an obstacle for non-biology viewers because you don't know the scientific terms beings used by the doctors. Dr. Gunther's accent also makes it a little difficult to understand sometimes.

This DVD is one of the 3 sets of DVDs in the same series. The others are Anatomy for Beginners and Autopsy Life and Death. You can visit Dr. Gunther's page at bodyworlds dot com.",1324166400,3,1081,5.096045197740113
2835060,4,B000Q9UJA6,"we wanted to go to the human exhibit  but it hasn;t come close to where we live, so I got the dvd and its wonderful , it informative and interesting.. I felt as tho i was there. Would highly recommend this to anyone..",1271635200,3,217,4.046511627906977
2835061,4,B000Q9UJA6,"I was informed by a colleague about this video. It's great! It shows a museum of cadavers that were skinned and displayed as exhibits. The video discusses info about all 12 organ systems of the body and their functions. They even show organs that have been destroyed by drinking (liver), smoking (lungs), ect. They show a fetus in different stages of gestation, and inside the womb. They ONLY reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is that the voice over talks in one tone which makes the movie a bit boring, BUT VERY INFORMATIVE! I recommend this to any Teacher/Professor teaching General Biology, Anatomy and Physiology or any branch of Science that discusses the human body. You don't have to watch the whole video at once. You can just jump to the chapters that you are discussing. This video is phenomenal!",1252281600,16,808,4.697183098591549

2835063,4,B000Q9UJA6,I use this with my adult education class.  It is a great alternative if I am not able to take them on a field trip to the exhibit.

2835065,5,B000Q9UJA6,"No one should be ashamed of their body but so many people are.

8195246,5,B000Q9UJA6,"Bought this as a gift for my doctor, who had never gotten to see the traveling exhibition as his family would not accompany him.  He really enjoyed it, but said, of course, his family would not watch it with him.  Seeing the exhibition was a life changing event for me, and no doubt this video serves well for those who can't make it to an exhibition.  Even though I've seen the exhibition, I am going to get a DVD for myself as a refresher.",1441238400,,441,4.226190476190476
