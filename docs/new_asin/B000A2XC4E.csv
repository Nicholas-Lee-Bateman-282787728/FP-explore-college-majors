8073376,2,B000A2XC4E,"Finally after looking for this film in its original language it came up on Amazon with English subtitles which could only mean ONE Thing!!!
Quick.... add it to shopping cart and buy.
the product arrived way ahead of the suggested deadline and I tore it out of its wrapping, so excited....only to find a very badly English dubbed German movie with English subtitles??????
What the ****?
Why can't Amazon clearly explain that the movie is dubbed in English?
Is this not considered important?
I realise that there are people out there that don't like subtitles...this would be equally important for them to know too.
I purchased another dvd at the same time, expecting as advertised, the original language, and it too was dubbed in English.
This will be the last time I purchase anything through Amazon.
What a waste of time and money.
No wonder people download movies illegally.",1345334400,3,876,4.885906040268456
