8399236,5,B003L1AF1O,"This is one of my all time favorites.  I mostly listen to the CD but throw the DVD onto the flat screen every so often too.  Luciano Pavarotti (RIP) had one of the most beautiful voices to ever grace humanity.  To hear him sing songs with contemporary artists like this is moving and downright fun.  Some of the songs still give me shivers (Holy Mother, Miss Sarajevo).  I have always loved Pavarotti's voice, even though I never really listen to opera (more of an alt rock, classic rock, hip hop, rap, etc. kinda girl).  So this is the perfect blend for me.  If you like Pavarotti's voice but want a little twist, then this is the CD/DVD for you.  Happy listening!",1379376000,,665,4.43801652892562
