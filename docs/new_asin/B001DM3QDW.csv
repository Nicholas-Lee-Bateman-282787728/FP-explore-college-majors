8294059,2,B001DM3QDW,"Pasha (Paul Harris) runs the numbers racket in this unnamed Ohio city. The Italians want to take over the number racket and let the blacks have narcotics and prostitution. No dice. We see them run their business until near the end when the Italians pop up again. The film takes place in 1956 and it is a good film to play ""spot the anachronism"" and the microphone...1970's autos, LA Dodgers baseball cap, shirt, Afro. There also has Don Edmondson, a female impersonator and killer.

Available on a 50 DVD pack.

8294060,4,B001DM3QDW,"Very much in the same vain and class as Superfly, Jive Turkey is a great little film following a crime boss whose main bread and butter is the old numbers racket.  We move along several other hustles in the network as we watch a top street operator keeping his business  afloat in the middle of a gang war with the Italian mob, not to mention a city's election cycle.  That brings a lot more heat as various candidates need ink and arrests to support their tough stance on crime to voters. Never mind everybody is paid off, its just business baby! Plus, the real threat is from somewhere in his own crew.
 For a low budget '70's flick,  the story is  engaging and the production does not suffer too much from the limitations.  There are some memorable and empathetic characters and we get the feeling of a community at work here.  I enjoyed it very much.  I wasn't prepared to take the movie too seriously because of the title, but was pleasantly surprised by what I got.
3 Stars for the mainstream comparison, 5 Stars for what it is. Dig it, sucka!",1454976000,2,1049,4.421875
