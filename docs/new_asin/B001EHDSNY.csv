3554138,5,B001EHDSNY,"With the deal struck between Nickelodeon and Amazon, we finnaly have various titles being released that I thought we would never see. Thank you Amazon! Now if only you could strike the same deal with Buena Vista Home Entertainment and get titles like X-Men, Spiderman, MMPR, and Digimon in Region 1 boxsets. I would gladly pay my hard earned money for titles like that.",1222819200,,369,4.78125

8298106,5,B001EHDSNY,I like the show. But guys like drake have all the luck. Drake is like a jock in one show he said the dentist gave him $200 to show his niece a good time. Then he said he got 6 burritos free. This has never happen to me in my lifetime. All people should be treated with respect and not based on looks. I have been harassed and abused for no reason because I don't have that certain look like drake has.,1519862400,,401,3.902439024390244
