8609570,5,B001N0LET2,"I have worked with the audio version of this product for about two months.  I used it to improve my cardio fitness and endurance for my first half marathon.  I relied heavily on this and Ms. Evans first workout because of a foot injury that was healing.  I am getting in shape, but wouldn't say that I'm in great shape.  I was able to complete the half marathon with a 15 minute/mile pace.  I truly think that I was able to finish because of this workout.

The workout is challenging, but it feels great when its over :).  Ms. Evans' form ques continue to be well timed, as in her first release.  She is very encouraging, reminds you to drink water and works through from slow paced to fast paced jumps.  I always ""feel the burn"" in my thighs and buttocks.  I enjoy the music and am thankful that she has collaborated with such talented and thoughtful artists.  Her workout is loaded on my IPOD, and I've turned it on just to listen to the music.

I am looking forward to more workouts from Ms. Evans.
