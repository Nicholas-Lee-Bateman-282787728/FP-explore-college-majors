4133993,5,B003KSO3QQ,"DVD executive producer Paul Brownstein gave himself credit on this set and the earlier 50th Anniversary Sgt. Bilko collection. But where's the name of the comedic genius behind ""You'll Never Get Rich"" and ""Car 54, Where Are You?"" Nat Hiken was a major force in American radio and television comedy. His name should not be erased from one of his greatest, most enduring creations.",1280707200,7,379,4.9375
4133994,3,B003KSO3QQ,"First of all, love the series and it's great that they are going to release the entire series on DVD. But why, why, why did they omit a ""play all"" option? Just like the Honeymooners. What savings to CBS could there possibly be? This option is standard on virtually every other series and it's just crazy to not offer this option to the buyer. So it's 5 stars for the episodes, 1 star for the functionality of the DVD. I also second the commenter who is looking for Car 54 on DVD. They can't issue too soon for me.",1280620800,3,513,4.191919191919192

4133996,5,B003KSO3QQ,"I thought they would never release this show. My father and I watched it when it first came out in 1955.
We thought it was the funniest of any of the comedy shows of that era, and I still do.
This is one show all of the family can watch.
Hope they release the rest of them.",1280361600,9,273,3.807017543859649
4133997,5,B003KSO3QQ,"they pull me back in.  This is one of the funniest shows ever and Phil Silvers is excellent as Master Sgt Ernie Bilko.  And the supporting characters such as Ritzik, Doberman and Colonel Hall (as the straight man) complement Bilko nicely.  I remember staying up and watching this on WOR-TV in NYC in the late 70's and early 80's.  Some episodes came out on VHS and also the 50th Anniversary DVD release were better than nothing but nothing beats a season set, hopefully eventually leading to the complete series release.  Other shows from this era such as The Honeymooners and I Love Lucy may have more fame but this show is not only just as funny (funnier) but also wittier and more cleverly written than most from this era.",1279756800,18,725,4.589147286821706

4134009,4,B003KSO3QQ,"Sgt. Bilko was originally broadcast about the time I was old enough to remember anything about TV. The impressions this show made lasted since the 1950's.
Phil Silvers as Sgt Bilko was the consummate con artist . Everyone knew it was a con and somehow everyone went with it. His commanding officer went so far as to redesign the post for the single purpose of keeping any newly arriving recruit from crossing paths with this conniving motor pool master sergeant.
Plots can be old, hackneyed and moth eaten, yet they still come across as original. The single best 30 minutes is when Bilko, unfairly shunned for a con that, for a change he had not performed, has to out maneuver three of his fellow non-coms.  The combination of an innocent Sgt Bilko, (Bilko..Innocent?) serving out righteous if rough justice resulted in an episode that I do not think has been re-cycled and if so not with the same twists and unexpected turns. Not to make this a spoiler, this episode has classical roots, but a pure Bilko execution.
A later episode uses what may have been, 50 years ago, a fresh plot about buying an over the hill race horse. It had my wife in stiches.  The basics of this plot have been reused many times, but the Bilko writing team has this one play out with complexities not re-employed, making even this plot feel modern and original.

One small item I prefer from the old Bilko style is that portrayal of base commander Col. John T. Hall, played by Paul Ford. Col. Hall is not future General Officer Material, but neither is he a bumbling tool. Compare him With the Base Commander in McHale's Navy. One is a believable character, the other a irritating idiot. Plot wise, anyone could get the best of Captain Binghamton. Outsmarting Col. Hall takes a Master Sgt Bilko.",1396396800,3,1773,4.640127388535032

4134011,5,B003KSO3QQ,"The Phil Silver's Show in which he plays Sgt. Bilko is in my opinion one of, if not the top, comedy program to come out of the 50s and 60s era. This collection comes in super condition. It was officially produced not like the second hand ""taped off the TV"" junk that you can find elsewhere on the net. The video and audio on this collection is the best quality one can expect from a disc copied from the re-mastered 35mm film originally recorded live by CBS. The show is one of a kind and as funny as it was 57 years ago. It's clean and original comedy with a cadre of unbelievable characters. I would rate it a ten if I could. You will love characters like the one played by Joe E. Ross. All in all if you don't have it, Buy It...Now! There are other high quality Bilko collections out there and if you find one - Buy It too. One caveat is to beware of knock-offs which are copied from re-runs on networks like Comedy Central or TV Land. A dye hard Bilko fan may buy those knock-offs, but their quality is outright horrendous.",1390694400,5,1027,4.191919191919192

If you love the old clean family type of comedy shows you will love this. I laughed so hard so many time. This is my favorite show of the 50's. I have watched this more than once, and every now and then will watch a episode again. I am looking forward to the other seasons to be available.

4134016,5,B003KSO3QQ,"There once was a time when comedy on tv was acutally funny instead inane, moronic, sexist, mean-spirited, and stupid.

Bilko is pre-eminent to anyting that tv has offered in the last 40 years or so except maybe ""Malcom in the Middle"" and ""The Simpsons"".

Bilko is the ultimate BS artist, and in every show he shines through with some scheme that just comes off the top of his head invariably to make money.  Eddie Murphy must surely be one of his disciples when it comes to BS.  Bilko is the master.  Anyone wanting lessons in reverse psychology should absolutly watch these shows.

He usually starts out as a shark, but invariably turns out to be an old softy with real heart and compassion, but woe to anyone who tries to hurt his men or friends.

This set is worth every penny and more.  It's good fun and lots of laughs.",1365897600,2,824,4.446666666666666

4134020,5,B003KSO3QQ,The first season of Sgt. Bilko: The Phil Silvers Show is outstanding.  THe episodes are are all very funny and bring back great memories.  I still laugh at the shenanigans that Bilko and his men used to get up to.  The episodes are clear and a superb product.  Unfortunately the follow up seasons have not been made available and at my age and health I would dearly love the complete follow up seasons to be released soon.  It is heartening that Amazon indicate seasons two and three on their drop down menu and hopefully these will be released very soon.  Jack,1358726400,2,561,4.5049504950495045
4134021,4,B003KSO3QQ,"I enjoyed the Phil Silvers Show when it aired and it's still funny today when viewed years later on these DVDs. However, thinking back on my own experience in the Army, I'm thinking it would have been even funnier if some of the episodes included tricks played by the lower ranks to get out of work, go AWOL, etc. Reality - I never met an Army sergeant like Bilko - too artificial to be believed.",1356739200,,396,4.293333333333333

In fact, the black and white added something to the feel of the shows. Phil Silvers goes back to comedy the WWII era could relate to, yet I can still enjoy the ""fun.""  Phil was perfect as Sgt.

I was too little to understand the humor, but I remember Phil Silvers and the magic everyone felt every time he came on the screen.

Now, I'm watching the shows and I finally know what my dad and brother were raving about. What fabulous entertainment! Great writing, wonderful situations, excellent acting by all the cast, and the genius of Phil Silvers are jam-packed into every show. All the right ingredients came together at just the right time in the right place.  There was a lot of integrity, sincerity and love put into those shows--a big difference from the assembly-line stuff of today's shows.

Sgt. Bilko always knew which strings or tricks to pull to make something happen. We could sure use him now to light a fire under CBS and get them to release Season 2 in a timely manner!",1322611200,5,965,4.598837209302325

I am a 16 year old girl and most of my friends do not watch old shows, however my parents exposed me to old shows like Dick Van Dyke, I love Lucy, Get smart, Bonanza, The Waltons, little house on the prairie, and many many more. I enjoy some more then others but Sargent Bilko is one of my favorites. The speed of the show never keeps you bored and the characters are extremely personable and easy to get to love. I know that teenagers my age are always interested in 'whats next' but I am glad that my parents introduced me to 'whats old' so that I can appreciate it for its brilliance as well as its innocence, because why does everything have to be so unclean today? Watching these old shows give me a greater insight into the problems of television today and what is missing - sensitivity and dignity. All in all this is a great series and its been over a year since its release and I hope that this does not turn into another Green Acres and stop after the first season.

4134043,5,B003KSO3QQ,"This DVD release of the First Season of Sgt. Bilko (Phil Silvers Show) is for me the most welcome of the many re-issues of past TV series during 2010. To put it mildly, it is long overdue given that Sgt. Bilko remains one of the best sitcoms ever to be produced. Few TV comedies can survive the passing of over 50 years, yet Bilko remains as fresh and funny as ever. In many cases re-releases of old favourites have proved disappointing and dated - not as good as when one first watched them. Not so with Bilko. His comic genius (aided and abetted by his wonderful team) transcends time and place - in a manner that other favourites of mine from the movies like Laurel and Hardy and the Marx Brothers have done. Except that Bilko maintained the standard for over 140 episodes. Let's hope we are not kept waiting too long for the remaining three seasons.",1290297600,4,853,4.439490445859873
4134044,5,B003KSO3QQ,"The merits of Bilko are comprehensively described in many terrific reviews on Amazon so here a few personal comments:

- maybe the outstanding feature of so many is the high standard of the scripts across the whole season. There is not a dud amongst them.
- while individual shows might be funnier such as ""The Court Martial"" and ""The Twitch"", nothing can top the inventive wit and surreal cynicism of ""The Empty Store"" - pure genius.
- the episodes have been nicely packaged in 5 easily accessible DVDs.
- each DVD contains a few extras, notably a couple of commentaries which are lightwieght but affable and imformative.
- Also included is a mint edition of ""The Lucy Show"" when Phil Silvers plays an efficiency expert with all the speed and timing he applied to Bilko. It's great to see 2 peerless clowns playing off each other seemlessly.
- the prints are in mainly in excellent condition, the worst still being more than adequate.

Like so many other reviewers, I am delighted to supplement my copy of the 50th edition DVD with the full first series and at a reasonable price too.",1289952000,4,1085,4.675392670157068

Let's face it, there were NO bad episodes of this show if you love Phil Silvers' Sergeant Bilko.

Published in England in 1985 and as far as I know the only Bilko book.  Particularly interesting because it has a listing of every show, writers, air date and a plot synopsis.  Also included is a Bilko A to Z and chapters on the background to the CBS show.  Black and white program stills are scattered throughout the pages.

The book is still available at reasonable prices if you search the net and I've upload a few pages from the book.  Click 'customer images' under the DVD cover.

Best episode in the first series?  I'll go for The Court Martial (aired March 6 1956) where Zippo the chimp gets inducted.  Comedy can't get any better than this.",1285200000,9,1006,5.192546583850931
4134047,5,B003KSO3QQ,"It has been over 50 years since Sgt. Bilko was aired and it has not been in syndication for many years as well so I am astounded that CBS has not transferred this wonderful program to DVD sooner, hopefully this first season sells well and we can have the rest of the shows on DVD as well.

Check out the special features that include commentary by Alan Melvin who played Cpl. Henshaw on the show. He describes how each show was produced over 5 days with readthrough and rehearsals Mon-Thu and then filmed in front of a live audience on Friday in NYC without cue cards and teleprompters, talk about pressure.

There is also commentary by George Kennedy about his experiences on the show, he was in the Army at the time and was brought in originally as a technical consultant. After he was discharged he became an actor on the show and he credits the show and the cast members for teaching him the craft of acting. He also relates that it was Phil Silvers that caused the end of the show, Silvers quit at the height of its popularity because he was exhausted after doing 4 years of the show. You can see why with that film schedule and the fact that he had the bulk of the dialog and had to learn every script in a week along with that boundless energy he used in every show.

Also check out the Lost Audition show that is the audition of the first show that was aired ""New Recruits"", Jack Warden played Cpl. Henshaw in this show and I guess didn't get the part, Jack was a fine actor that went on to stardom despite not being on this great show. There were other tweaks as well to the cast, Paul Ford was added to the cast as Col. Hall, the show would not have been the same without Mr. Ford.

One of the best TV comedies ever, just don't understand why it took CBS so long to put it on DVD.",1285113600,5,1790,4.209912536443149
4134054,4,B003KSO3QQ,"When one watches the Phil Silvers Show,one cannot help but ask who else but Phil Silvers could ever have successfully pulled off such a brilliant characterization of one Sgt. Ernest T.Bilko?I cannot honestly think of any actor then extant who had the moxy and energy coupled with such an innate ability for ad libbing than Silvers had who could have. He was creator  Nat Hiken's first and best choice for the role.
This is the first season of ""The Phil Silvers Show"",for a short time known as ""You'll Never Get Rich"",with eps spanning from Sept. 20/55 to May 15/56. The opening credits are the syndication animated titles which show a group of soldiers walking on with the shows title card ,Bilko barking orders,the group marching off,then Doberman appearing with an upside down card only to be righted by Bilko shouting again. However the original titles,bumpers and end credits ARE included in this five single DVD set which are a delight to see. Also included are numerous commentaries,show related commercials(sponsors were the life blood of /50s TV),the so called ""lost""audition show and an ep from the /60s Lucy Show with Phil Silvers as an efficiency expert. Silvers was SO good at his character that ever after,it seemed,everyone wanted to see him playing Bilko in some way,shape or form. Just watch him in ""A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum"" and you'll see Ernest T.in full swing there,just dressed of course in Roman garb instead of combat fatigues.
The show featured a bevy of great supporting cast members,among them Harvey Lembeck as Corp. Barbella(who would soon gather another following as the aged biker in the Frankie and Annette films),stalwart and talented Allan Melvin as Corp. Henshaw,Herby Faye as Pvt. Fender,Maurice Gosfield as the slovenly Pvt. Doberman,Billy Sands as Pvt. Papparelli,Harry Clark as Sgt. Sowicki,and the irrepressible John Ford as the hard done by Colonel Hall. It has been said that Ford would often forget his lines and Silvers would,without missing a beat,say a line that would twig Ford to remembering or just say his line for him. You can see many an ad lib by Silvers but one most obvious one is in""The New Recruit"" where a monkey is inducted into the army,despite Bilko's attempts to stop it. At the court martial where Bilko is the simians counsel,his client suddenly dashes over to a corner and Bilko says something to the effect that he thinks his client is trying to contact his congressman. It's hilarious stuff and this and so many other instances are there for all to see.
Also visible are little bloopers. One quite visible one,and I'll let you try and find the ep yourself,is where Sgt. Sowicki leaves the scene by going out a doorway. The camera then switches angles and Harry Clark is quite visible standing behind the scenery watching the proceedings for quite a bit of time. Someone must have told him as he suddenly moves away.
Now this show was NOT the ratings Goliath you may have been led to believe it was. Sure it won around nine well deserved Emmys during its tenure on CBS but it never reached more than into the top 25 and that was in its second season. Mind you I do have a BIG problem with the so-called ""ratings"" system at the best of times and this concept was in its infancy in the /50s,its accuracy was dodgy at the best of times and it was/is most unrepresentative of the viewing public as a whole at ANY time.
Having said that however the shows writing I believe was much better in the first two years,especially in so far as the Bilko character goes. For the first while Bilko was certainly portrayed as the conman he would always be but at least he was shown to have the best interests of his platoon at heart. Later they(the writing staff)turned him into more of a self-centred hustler and I found that aspect of the character the least sustainable on any long term basis. Another small detail is the fact of sustaining such a high energy character on a weekly basis. It is a credit to Silvers professionalism that he was able,for the most part,to pull it off but there are times even Silvers can't overcome the poorer scripts,and the shows would fall flat;and hard. That also became more the norm than the exception as the series wore on. I think these factors,more so than the normal spin that the show went off the air because of the cost of such a large cast,are more the causes of the shows demise than any other. I thought so in 1959 and I still think so today.
Technically speaking this set has NOT been remastered and while generally speaking the eps look pretty good I must say that a good remastering from the original elements should have been on the cards for this truly iconic tv show. Paul Brownstein who put this package together( and quite a few others for various companies-kind of a gun-for-hire)got his first big break in that end with the mega packaging and transfer of the Dick Van Dyke series;which by the way were also in great need of remastering but weren't. Brownstein seems to be good at getting the extras together which fans love but for some reason he stays away from any remastering,which frankly I do not get. In this set not only are some of the prints very,very grainy and with blemishes,quite a few have been printed too close in. To see this take note at the end of each ep of just how many that you can clearly see the final year of release on(1955,1956,etc).If they are cut off partially or completely then new prints should have been made. As mentioned there are some nice extras but this doesn't make up for this lack of remastering. But then again cost is always the big concern and more often than not the consumer gets cut the most.
In conclusion despite this sets non-remastering it is still in pretty good shape(we all have seen worse)and the extras Mr. Brownstein has added are as welcome as pay day. This is the series in one of its' best years with Phil Silvers in his penultimate role as the fast talking con man sergeant of Fort Baxter,Kansas;with a heart. The laughs come at break neck speed and Silvers is well supported with a cast of great second bananas on hand to assist him. This is one of 1950's television's better shows and I'm glad to see its final release to DVD.",1283212800,34,6220,4.6442831215970966

It's great to finally see these episodes in good quality video and sound. The menues are easy to use, and the extras are fun.

4134057,5,B003KSO3QQ,"This set has English subtitles for the deaf and hearing impaired. As someone with bad hearing, I find that information vital whenever I buy a DVD these days.

Of all the TV comedies I ever saw, this one has to be the best. Not even Lucy or The Honeymooners, the two other great series from the golden age of US sitcom, came anywhere near it. Maybe it hit me at an impressionable age; maybe I missed some other great series; maybe they showed only the best episodes here (Melbourne, Australia, the early 1960s). But the pleasure that I've had from watching this long-awaited set of the first season has proven to me at least that Sgt Bilko really is the best. For anyone who wants proof of the genius of Phil Silvers, I'd suggest they try the episode where Bilko goes to bring back a Hungarian private who's gone AWOL. The story is practically non-existent and the dialogue is forgettable, but from the moment when Bilko enters the house of the celebrating Hungarians, the laughs just keep on coming. Phil Silvers was an amazing performer.

One question though. Is there anyone out there under the age of 40 who enjoys Bilko? I'd hate to think he has no young fans.",1282089600,35,1164,4.538095238095238
4134058,5,B003KSO3QQ,Thank you for putting Sgt Bilko on dvd. I didn't see it whan i was i kid because i wasn't even born yet when it aired originally. When i found out it came out on dvd i watched and enjoyed it for the first time. I would like to see more seasons come out on dvd because i really enjoyed the first season. I hope they keep coming out on dvd and i hope they don't stop coming out. And i hope they're other people out there who will buy them i don't want them to stop coming out. I hope this tv show will not be like other classic tv shows they just put out a few seasons then stop brinbing them out.,1281744000,4,595,3.806451612903226
4134059,5,B003KSO3QQ,"i was not around  when the show originally aired, i finally caught it on tv land in my mid twenties,and i fell immediatly in love with it, it is indeed one of the best comedies of all times and holds up fifty plus years later. No one can top Phil Silvers or match his comdeic wit, Steve Martin attempted to in the Sgt. Bilko movie, but only one man could really potray Bilko and that man was Phil Silvers. Lets hope the other 3 seasons quickly come out soon!!!",1281657600,4,460,4.168539325842697
4134060,5,B003KSO3QQ,"When the dvd compilation came out back in 2006, it was landmark release too long in coming.
Finally, after 4 years, the complete First Season of Bilko has finally arrived. I was a child of 8 years old when I watched the original CBS broadcasts with my dad.  Even at that early age, I knew I was watching something special.  It's one of my favorite childhood memories.  This first season of ""Bilko"" is still as fresh and hilarious as it was when I first experienced it.  It all revolves the genius of Phil Silvers, whose comedic timing and talent were a veritable force of nature.....fully displayed here in the fine transfer of the original show which was fortunately preserved on film.  The original broadcasts never looked as crisp and clear as these DVD transfers which are superb.  Hopefully, we won't have to wait another 4 years for CBS to release the other complete seasons on DVD.
I'm glad I'm still around the see these classics again.

February 18,2014:  I'm still waiting for the remaining Bilko seasons four years later. Where are they?  There is no excuse for delaying the remaining episodes, when you consider all the mediocre junk that is issued on DVD every year.  I don't care if there aren't any more ""extras""......just the release the remaining episodes.  For many of us who are waiting, time is running out.",1281139200,4,1327,4.726086956521739

I found it interesting that they had one of those big security tags on it that wraps all the way around the case. Is Bilko in such high demand that people are stealing it?

I viewed the first dvd prior to writing this review and I can tell you that the video and audio quality is perfect. It's like watching broadcast TV.

Buy it. You won't be disappointed. This is classic tv at it's finest.",1281052800,12,522,4.058252427184466

I have not bought the First Season yet (but will when I am done with this review!), but I also recall Hiken gets credit on the original title credits in the TV show intro. Anyway, an unbelievably hilarious show, equal to ""I Love Lucy"", and surpassed by none.
