He is perfectly complemented by Chad Wackerman, who seems so utterly relaxed, he never even breaks into a sweat as the rhythms flow out of him.

Amazing, unique performances.",1255564800,3,350,5.140350877192983
8134433,5,B000GTLMSY,"I can't write enough here about what Terry Bozzio is able to do behind the drum set. He is an alien when it comes to his capacity of playing the instrument. The DVD itself isn't a great super high quality production but is good enough to be appreciated for what it is - an incredible display of talent. As an example, to this day I am still trying to play what Terry played with the band Explorer's Club in 1998. Very complex, mental stuff. I don't know how he does it. Chad is also an incredible drummer, but Terry is superior. Like I said, don't expect a high budget production here, but expect out of this world performances.",1225238400,,628,4.330508474576271
