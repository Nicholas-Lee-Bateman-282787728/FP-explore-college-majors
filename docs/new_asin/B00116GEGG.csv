When I saw this dvd I was thrilled. But after seeing it I was disappointed, the matches were ok but just not what I was expecting.",1332892800,,281,3.8620689655172415
8240685,5,B00116GEGG,"I didn't think I was going to enjoy a dvd like this very much, but then I watched it and it was actually really awesome. The main video is 2 hours of the best CM Punk Matches from Full Impact Pro (FIP) as he competes in a tournament to crown the very first FIP World Champion. It's the indie scene everyone is used to, wrestling in a dimly lit room or a bar, in front of like 25-50 people.

The matches are awesome, and the lack of music and big lights and entrance videos just enhances feeling of good wrestling. He's got matches against guys like Justin Credible, Homicide, Jamie Noble, and others.

The two matches he has with Homicide are reason alone to get the dvd. The first one they compete for the FIP World Title, a match that leaves the ring and has them fighting outside (in the middle of a hurricane). And the other is a falls count anywhere match between the two that starts in the ring and ends in a strip club . . . yes a strip club.

For extras you get two 20-something minute matches against Daniel Bryan and Roderick Strong from ROH. And also a 40-minute highlight video of his matches in IWA (even some against the late great Eddie Guerrero and an unmasked Rey Mysterio).

All in all it's a great dvd if your a fan of CM Punk, FIP, or even just wrestling in general :)",1330387200,2,1288,4.223577235772358
