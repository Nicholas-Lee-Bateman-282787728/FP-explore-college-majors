I love Japanese movies, and was looking forward to seeing their ""take"" on this bizarre story - but it just didn't live up to the Korean film.  If you want to see this story done RIGHT, with amazing context and tension that pulls you in, buy the Korean version instead - you'll be happy that you saw it (especially if you like horror - the Japanese version seemed like more of a tense drama than a horror story).  Not a bad film overall - good acting and a coherent story - but disappointing after watching the Korean film of the same name.",1468454400,2,598,4.321428571428571
8275667,4,B0019X3ZOK,Very odd movie. Takes touchy subject matter for the time and culture it was made in and tries to portray it with enough comedic flare to balance it out and help the audience through it. Ends up coming off very awkward. Should be a cult classic. Some great moments. The Korean remake is much more serious and dark.,1461369600,,313,4.413793103448276
8275668,3,B0019X3ZOK,"An insurance manager gets a phone call asking him what the Shawa Life company policy is on a suicide pay out. This sends him into a tizzy. He goes to a house where he is set up to be the one who discovers the suicide victim. The company suspects fraud and is reluctant to pay out. Our agent investigates further to find a history of deaths and payouts.

The film is mildly interesting and seems to have lost something in the translation. Two hours is much too long. Film is in subtitles.

No f-bombs or sex. Some nudity +stripper. 2 1/2 stars",1415145600,2,542,4.303921568627451
8275669,3,B0019X3ZOK,"Ok, 3 stars is being generous for this two star film. The reason for it is that the acting is good but the story is poor. NOT a haunted house film but rather a crime thriller that is very slow for the first half (feel free not to pay much attention as nothing is missed). The main character works for Showa Insurance and is called in a case involving a child suicide. The stepfather is a suspect while the mother becomes withdrawn. No spoilers- More people are killed (on and off-screen) all the while the agent is trying to keep his sanity while trying to solve the case. The reference to this being a Japanese Psycho is because that is the plot basis, psychotic killer that tries to kill the agent (again and again) and is hard to kill herself. Yes, the killer is a woman and even the most obtuse will figure out the who before the hero. So a rental or pick up really cheap (under $5) and watch on a weekend afternoon if nothing else to do. Note: the film is subtitled with no dub.",1382918400,,983,4.23404255319149
