2561894,5,B000FDRQRM,This video is awesome.  This was a gift for my husband and he couldn't believe it when he opened it for Christmas.  He was thrilled that it came with the secondary disk and the Animal Chin sticker.  A must have for any fan of the Bones Brigade!,1325030400,,244,4.148936170212766
2561895,5,B000FDRQRM,"I was stocked to see that you could not only get Animal Chin on DVD, BUT, they went further and made this out of sight Special Edition! And even a free Search for Chin sticker! Seriously, if you grew up skateboarding around the time Animal Chin was the must watch video, then you must get a copy quick! Its so worth it! And I thank god for here as many stores in my area didn't even carry this masterpiece! Two thumbs up from this guy!",1244592000,4,435,4.129411764705883

2561897,5,B000FDRQRM,"I really enjoyed this DVD, seeing the original Bones Brigade today was way cool.  This DVD came with the making of Animal Chin, and seeing all that went into the making of this film was awesome.  It comes with the Bones Brigade commentary, as well as the Bones Brigade Video Showtunes.  I highly reccomend this to any fan of The Bones Brigade, and/or skater that love the whole original Powell Peralta family.",1219536000,4,409,4.652777777777778

8121322,5,B000FDRQRM,"If you know who Skate Master Tate is then make the purchase immediately.  So good to see the old Bones crew again!  The extra DVD is great and it was really nice to see Cab get his respect from the industry that he helped build.  I don't think there are the words to say how great it is to have this movie on DVD along with all of the behind the seems footage and extras that come along with it.  This movie led the way to make skateboarding videos what they are today.  George Powell, Stacy Peralta and the Brigade opened the door for future videos like Shakle Me Not, Video Days, and Yeah Right.  If this was part of your childhood growing up make the purchase and relive those days when you wished the sun would stay up just a bit longer so you could hit one last curb, try one last hip, or simply hit that one trick you have been trying for all day.",1394236800,4,853,4.077844311377246
