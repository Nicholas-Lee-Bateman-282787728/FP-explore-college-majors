5735225,5,B00CR34NQU,Great stories for children and adults. My grand daughters and enjoy the trilogy. they never seem to grow old. _,1393977600,2,111,4.6
5735226,2,B00CR34NQU,Disc 2 (Prince Caspian) does not play because it has the wrong region code.  It seems clear this is a more of a systemic problem with the boxed set.,1393459200,,148,4.103448275862069
5735227,1,B00CR34NQU,"This is due to the fact that both CDs of Prince Caspian will not play ""because of the region code""! This sucks that they would stick these unplayable disks sandwiched between 1 & 3 so I WANT MY MONEY BACK OR REPLACE THESE 2 DISKS THAT WILL NOT PLAY! If there was a zero rating, I'd have chosen that one!",1392940800,7,303,4.066666666666666
5735228,1,B00CR34NQU,"only one of three discs work without issue. one of the three doesn't work at all due to some sort of regional setting issue. we can get the third disc to work, eventually.",1390262400,11,171,4.212121212121212
5735229,2,B00CR34NQU,I can not play the second movie prince caspian due to wrong region.  They did not come with Disney codes.,1385424000,8,105,4.25
5735230,2,B00CR34NQU,"Only the 1st and 3rd movies are universal region codes. ""Prince Caspian"" is only able to play on blu-ray players programmed with the B region code. Amazon.com needs to change the way they define region codes for Blu-rays, because it is not the same as dvds.",1381017600,16,257,4.608695652173913
5735231,1,B00CR34NQU,If you do not have a DVD player that is region free...do not buy this trilogy! I learned the hard way! Very unhappy!,1378080000,18,116,4.086956521739131
5735232,5,B00CR34NQU,"For some reason, the 2nd movie was a European DVD, instead of a Blu-Ray, but I sent it to Disney, and they sent the correct Blu-Ray version to us. Everything worked out well!",1422230400,,174,4.303030303030303

5735235,1,B00CR34NQU,"There is no logical reason to sell a trilogy with varying region formats and not inform the consumer, unless the intention is fraud. That is the case with this purchase. Buyers beware, Prince Caspian is the wrong region format for players in Canada or US. Nowhere in their product description do they advise that one of the three movies is of a different region and will not work in your North American blu Ray player. This is a case of fraud and Amazon should remove this product. I had a very disappointed family member Christmas morning.",1420156800,,540,4.635416666666667

5735238,1,B00CR34NQU,"There is no valid reason to have a boxed set of blu-rays - together - with one of the discs unable to play on most USA machines.  There is no excuse for that.  It's like going to the dealership to buy a car, and putting water in the gas tank!  If a person purchases the set, that person INTENDS to watch all three discs on the same machine, in almost EVERY case.",1411430400,3,362,4.0

5735240,4,B00CR34NQU,"The product details does mention the region code as B/2 which includes Europe, Greenland, French territories, Middle East, Africa, Australia and New Zealand. Unsure why the bad review due to unable to view 1 of the discs due to region problem when it is mentioned. You can view this prior to purchasing.",1407369600,6,303,4.846153846153846
5735241,1,B00CR34NQU,We bought these as a gift for our daughter to have her own set.  We just recently decided to watch her set and found that Prince Caspian will not play due to it being in Region Code B.  WHY would you even sell a set with varying region codes!!!!!

8585229,2,B00CR34NQU,"PLEASE READ!!!!  Unfortunately, I didn't read the reviews before I purchased mine - the 2nd disc (Prince Caspian) is REGION B ONLY and cannot be played if you have a U.S. specs Blu-ray player.
