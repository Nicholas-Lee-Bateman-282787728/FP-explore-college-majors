5113687,3,B0048M6PU0,"With the success of all the fantasy action shows of the 1990s it was only inevitable that Sheena would return to the TV in the year 2000. We might not have Pan Am flights to the moon in 2001, but at least we got Gena Lee Nolin playing Sheena, jungle queen. This version was filmed in Florida and has been released on DVD by Sony.

As a jungle queen, Gena Lee Nolin is pleasing to the eyes, but is no Jamie Lee Curtis. A former Baywatch actress, she had the training to handle the physical demands of the role. I can't fault her too much, since this was her first starring TV series role. Better scripts might have helped.

Based on what I have been able to watch, the 21st century Sheena is far more supernatural than the previous ones. The origin story follows that of the original, but this time she has the power to turn into different animals as the need arises. What intrigued me the most was another aspect she possessed: the ability to turn into a feral predator (no doubt influenced by another series of the same name) and wreck holy hell with the baddies.

The Florida locations used for filming the series work very well. You can almost believe it takes place in the mythical African country of Maltaka. The other actors...oh what time is it? What I have seen of the series, the situations and scripts leave much to be desired. It's obvious to me they were trying to get another Warrior Princess series and Sheena was the raw material. Hey, we all have bills to pay.

While I'm at it I should give another plug to this excellent Sheena website. There's more Sheena contained in here than I could discuss in one post. Do check it out. The web designer has done an outstanding job.",1370995200,3,1689,4.403846153846154
5113688,2,B0048M6PU0,"Just another ""T&A"" presentation.  Sheena, herself, certainly can't act, but it is the male lead that is so annoying.
He is the constant smart-guy smirking and grinning throughout every scene and situation.  The typical J.C. Penney
male model type.  I bought this only because I am writing a song about ""Sheena"".",1370908800,,311,5.0588235294117645
5113689,1,B0048M6PU0,You sent me a movie that didn't play in my dvd player. Why we're discussing this why sare you asking such a unreasonably high price for a dvdr copy. It is a copy of a copy and it not produced from a master copy. You are asking for 40 to 45$ for it-how can you ask that much with a straight face.,1367712000,2,295,3.774193548387097
5113690,5,B0048M6PU0,"A fantastic fantasy world in a jungle environment with a gorgeous kick-butt female, an ever-reluctant military-trained hero, a doofus-acting character providing welcomed comic relief, and an above par cast of not-so-run-of the-mill jungle dwellers  hey, what's not to love? But don't dig too deep here. Simple plots make for easy viewing, with easy-on-the-eye scenery, and oh, did I mention this IS fantasy?",1366502400,6,407,5.564516129032258

5113692,5,B0048M6PU0,"This is a made to order DVD, that uses DVD-R media. Some very old DVD players might not be compatable. The episodes look very nice, just a simple menu no extras. Be sure to open it right away to check the disks. The first time I ordered I got only three disks. This is quality control problem at  the manufacturer, not Amazon's fault.",1348358400,6,334,4.301587301587301
5113693,2,B0048M6PU0,"Fun attempt by Steven Sears(and others) to revive the old Sheena in Africa story, with Gina Nolin a beautiful if not wholly convincing hero--her supporting cast is adequate, and the Florida-for-Africa photography is often quite lovely. The storylines are mostly straightforward, as they were in the original; what differs here, is Sheena's ability to morph into any non-human animal with whom she makes eye contact (her corresponding change in mass has not yet been addressed). The series is fun and visually moving, worthwhile if taken on its own terms.",1347148800,7,554,5.235955056179775
5113694,4,B0048M6PU0,"SHEENA will never look as good as network TV because it was not filmed in 35mm.  These new domestic Season 1 and 2 sets are apparently remastered, but that can only get you so far.  I purchased the Spanish DVD some time ago, and the quality was perfectly fine for a 16mm show -- certainly as good as SHEENA ever looked in syndication.  I'm sure these new sets will be even nicer (star rating based on expectations).  Update: Judging from the clip Amazon has provided, the SHEENA series is apparently being offered in a widescreen (16 x 9) format, despite the 1.33 designation in the specs.  Quality looks excellent, superior to original broadcast.  Gary G.",1339977600,7,656,4.660869565217391

5113697,5,B0048M6PU0,"I'm so glad to see these episodes now out on DVD.  Sheena was a great show and had air times been better in the US it would have lasted much longer.  Usually anything Steven Sears is part of will no doubt be entertaining and done right. Gena Lee Nolan was perfect for the part, and John Allen Nelson balanced out the lead roles as Matt Cutter, a suave but sassy adventurer.  Margo Moore is superb as Kali and there were some great guest stars as well.  One of my favorite episodes is ""The Fool Monty,"" watch it, and perhaps you can figure out why.",1420416000,,547,4.230769230769231

5113703,4,B0048M6PU0,This first season of Sheena was far better than I expected - the characters are very likable and the story lines are good. It is not a big budget series but the scenery is in a jungle location which is shot with clarity and the acting is great. I saw some of the other reviews and so had to add mine. I would give this two thumbs up. Also whomever the young lady is who acted the lead part of Sheena is very athletic and definitely does the character justice.,1405987200,6,459,4.111111111111111
5113704,5,B0048M6PU0,"Good action in this short-lived series.  I saw it on TV back in the early 2000s and enjoyed it.  Nice cast.  These DVDs are actually DVD-R discs, presumably dual-layer considering the sheer number of episodes on each disc.  The picture quality is a bit softer than one would expect from the DVD format--but still a cut above VHS.  I suspect this is because they pushed the envelope as far as squeezing so many episodes on each disc (typically most TV series on DVD limit each disc to no more than three or four episodes even on dual-layer discs).  Some action scenes have obvious ""square-like"" pixels showing.  The audio is Dolby Digital 2.0--stereo--and sounds pleasant.  Despite the picture softness and digital artifacts, the picture overall is acceptable and you will enjoy these episodes.  Sheena is a very entertaining TV series.  The DVD case and packaging is like any commercial DVD set.  Everything above also applies to Season 2.",1381104000,4,939,4.917197452229299

8522656,1,B0048M6PU0,"While advertised as being proper, pressed DVD's, in the case were junky, made-on-demand (MOD) DVD-R's.  They will not play in my computer (of course) and not even in at least one of my dedicated DVD players which is hooked to a television.  Further, it is my experience that DVD-R's last only 3-5 years before they self-destruct and cease playing in anything; overall, a *terrible* format.  Why would Sony think someone would willingly pay such a high price for what is essentially a (temporary) copy just like I could have recorded from TV myself?  I don't know why they even mess with MOD DVD-R's, as, being in the business, I assure you that unless one is making, say, less than 200 copies, pressed DVD's are far cheaper to make (and they play in *anything*, and last essentially *forever*).  Is Sony really that scared of sitting on a bit of inventory (at less than $1 per set) if the title doesn't sell?  Ridiculous.",1493078400,2,921,4.6894409937888195
