7831132,3,6302798248,"*** 1952. Written and directed by Ingmar Bergman. The wives of four brothers are waiting for them in a summer cottage. They speak about their respective marriage and explain why they've stayed with their husband in spite of the loss of their romantic ideals. In my opinion, the film suffers from the gap between dialogues very well written and a cinematic form which was then not totally domesticated by Ingmar Bergman. But I can be wrong in this matter and I was maybe not in the mood for a Bergman movie last night. I'll give SECRETS OF WOMEN another chance one of these nights. You can find at Amazon.co.uk a zone 2 DVD release of this motion picture coming from Tartan video.",1209254400,,679,4.573770491803279

7831134,4,6302798248,"Bergman films not only entertain, they challenge the viewer to figure out what the director is trying to convey. 1952's Secrets of Women is no different. Here, the master explores the nature of romance from the perspective of five women who are connected by men they know. Bergman's thesis is that women start out with a romantic ideal of what a relationship should be; however, this ideal is shattered by the reality of human nature --- infidelity, selfishness, feelings of loneliness. Although women must eventually compromise their romantic ideals, they ultimately adapt in order to hang onto all the love they can.
In stark black and white, Bergman once again invites the viewer to join him on a journey to understand the meaning of life and the human psyche. And as always, his work results in mesmerizing interactive cinema. Those who enjoy the art of directing and moviemaking will find this video intellectually stimulating. Others may only find it devoid of action. But then, they don't understand what Bergman does --- that the real action takes place within the mind of man.",1011484800,2,1085,4.967032967032967
