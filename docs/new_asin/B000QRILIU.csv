8197136,3,B000QRILIU,Very little nudity in this video compared to other videos by Rusty Nail Productions. I didn't like idea of the video person using railroad tracks as a location to film the model because it is a safety issue.,1292803200,,207,4.473684210526316
8197137,4,B000QRILIU,"For the majority of this film, the girl on the cover (Katherine) generally keeps her clothes on, but does undress a little, to show her underwear. There is a scene where she's washing a car, where she unties her bikini bottom, but simply reties it. However, she reties it so that her butt cheeks are showing a bit more.

In other words, she is playfully teasing you throughout the film. In the last 5-6 minutes, she (finally) undresses completely and poses for the camera, which pans (somewhat closely) up and down her beautiful, white-skinned body.

I took (1/2)-star away, because this film is only 45 minutes long (and I wanted to see more of Katherine).
I took another (1/2)-star away, because, eventhough she playfully teases you (which I generally found enjoyable, but at times boring), I was hoping that she would show off her body for longer amounts of time (like Jenny does, in most of her films).

Final thoughts: I was pleased with this DVD and would recommend it to people who are fans of the production company.",1268179200,7,1024,4.709497206703911
