8162395,1,B00008AOU7,"...this DVD they're selling is a bootleg/pirate DVD made in Brazil. It is NOT official. The *real* Wembley DVD will be a 2 DVD set and will be released in June.
The bootleg DVD on this page was copied off the laserdisc, so the quality is so-so, it's not the full show, etc. Please do not waste your money.
The REAL DVD will be the entire concert, with a DTS track and have loads of extra features, so do yourself a favor and wait for the official DVD.",1053129600,30,451,4.136363636363637
