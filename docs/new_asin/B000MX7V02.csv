8501044,3,B000MX7V02,"If you are a fan of reality TV shows such as COPS and/or are interested in law enforcement training methods, you might want to consider adding this DVD to your collection. That being said, do not expect this video to deliver the same quality COPS has presented viewers with over the years. SWAT: Uncensored is not nearly as action-packed as COPS is, and the parts that are narrated sound quite dull and amateurish. There are, however, many scenes that show SWAT officers in training drills, and this in itself is worth the price of the DVD. A few scenes are actually dramatizations of real situations (with fair acting and low-budget special effects), and although those scenes are well done, I was a tad disappointed by the fact that the people who made this video could not get actual footage of similar situations in real life. Perhaps COPS is to blame for this, but I would have liked to see actual SWAT interventions rather than dramatizations. For this reason, I would recommend the purchase of this DVD, but only to people who are more interested in seeing real SWAT training drills than in watching fast-paced action sequences. It might also be worthwhile to mention that the exact same product is offered under a different title:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/S-W-A-T-Behind-the-Scenes/dp/B000MRNWHE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">S.W.A.T.
