7887668,4,6305313172,"Michael Landes not only starred in this movie, he was the Producer.

As producer, Michael got a chance to reunite with two of his Lois and Clark co-stars.

Michael Landes, of course, played Jimmy Olsen. Lane Smith was Perry White, and John Shea portrayed Lex Luthor. Some of my favorite scenes with the supporting cast were when Michael Landes and Lane Smith played their scenes together.

I wish I could give the movie five stars, but there is room for improvement in the story. But I will watch it very carefully when it becomes a free Amazon Prime movie someday.",1412380800,,565,4.63
7887669,4,6305313172,"I've had a crush on Michael Landes ever since he played the love of Dorthey Jane Torklesons heart on ""The Torklesons"" when I was still in high school. Then he went on to play Jimmy Olsen on Lois & Clark, but was replaced a year later...grr...anyway I digress.
I've been a fan of Lois & Clark forever, so when I see that there's a movie with THREE major cast members from the show, I just have to have it...there's also the Michael fatuation mentioned above.
I thought the movie was very cute, and yes like the other reviewers mentioned the Bob Ross scene is classic. I still remember how a friend of mine reacted when he passed away, ""No more happy trees!""
I love how the movie showed how just ONE event in your life can affect your relationships for a very long time. Lane Smith as a psychiatrist was something I never pictured before, but he played the part very very well. I would have loved for there to have been more scenes with John Shea, but I understand why there weren't and the movie still worked for me.
I liked Hedy Burress in ""Foxfire"" and I loved her character in this. Very different from ""Foxfire"" which just shows what a dynamic actress she is.
Then there is Michael...words cannot describe how he moves me, but I can say that I think he's great in everything I've seen him in and this movie is no exception. :)",977788800,3,1329,4.362903225806452
7887670,4,6305313172,"This movie is Great! If you love the classic love stories and some comedy and a little psychology then you will love this movie.  I mean the movie is unusually good in its own way.  It has the ""old fashioned"" love  story with a twist.  A young businessman falls for a beautiful zoologist.  But the businessman can't confront his past-but when he does, you will be  suprised!  I almost fell of my chair.  This movie kept me laughing all the  way through it!  It was one of those movies that you could watch over and  over again and not get tired of it.",951696000,2,551,4.252427184466019
