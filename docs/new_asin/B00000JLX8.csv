1236826,2,B00000JLX8,"good plot, good cast...typical characters...death scenes we have seen thousands of times before...and an ending that comes too quickly..this was one of the worst slasher movies that I have ever seen....too boring...too  stupid....and not very interesting.....",949881600,,259,6.194444444444445
1236827,4,B00000JLX8,"I never would have rented this movie if I hadn't have glanced at the back cover. The name makes it sound like a cheesy low-budget slasher film. But, actually, it is a pretty decent movie with lots of originality. It has a  few setbacks, but they can easily be looked over with such a great plot.  This movie scared me more than the usual horror  flick and I think it  deserves recognition.",947289600,4,389,4.361111111111111
1236828,5,B00000JLX8,"This is a pretty good direct-to-video movie.  It's like Scream meets the Phantom of the Opera.  It has gratuitous sex and nudity, like all good slasher flicks do, and endless gory deaths.  If you are a fan of the genre,  pick this movie up.  It's nothing you haven't seen before, but it is a  worthy video (and it's pretty cheap!) to have in your collection.",935971200,3,358,4.430769230769231
1236859,4,B00000JLX8,"Ok, so, I know a lot of people have slagged off this movie (pretty much all of my mates) but personally I thought it was a good attempt. If you like movies such as Scream, Halloween and Friday the 13th - this movie is for you. Yes it is very typically a teen-slasher movie, but the storyline is interesting from the start and not as predictable as one might expect. If nothing else, this movie will keep you entertained as one may laugh hysterically as all the...actors are nicely finished off by a friendly looking clown. Not one for the faint hearted me thinks.",1023753600,,563,4.423076923076923
1236860,4,B00000JLX8,"I saw this movie in my video store, and being a fan of both recent teen horror films, and of murderous clowns, I had to see this. I watched it, and it really freaked me in a way. It's not pulse-pounding horror, but it seems almost real. The acting can get a bit HORRIBLE at times, but most of it is good, and it helps out. I know there isn't much gore in this film, unlike most new horror films, but UNLIKE new teen horrors, this has nudity. That guarantees this film to be Canadian, because in the U.S. That shouldn't be the reason why you see this film, but sadly, most male viewers will want this only for that. But in terms of fear, this film does rank right up there with ""Scream."" The clown, who you actually get to see often, is scary, and makes you shake. You care about most of the characters, and so you're sad when the get killed off. Also, seeing both Margot Kidder, who deserves a bit of a ""scream-queen"" title, and Christopher Plummer, who you're kinda suprised to see, really makes the film better, because with them, it doesn't seem as much as a teen horror as most films.
The only couple of bad things about this film is the stereotypical characters, who you care for, but aren't really unique and are there mainly for the purpose of being killed. Also, like I mentioned before, the sometimes horrendous acting by a couple of characters can get annoying FAST. And finally, the death of a certain character makes me mad, seeing how they were great to watch and didn't deserve it.
But other than those couple things, this is a good film that undoubtedly got less than it deserved. If you can find it, take a look at it. In fact, buy it. I'm sure you'll be pleased.",993600000,4,1679,4.333333333333333
1236861,5,B00000JLX8,"The Clown at Midnight is a great slasher film that isn't too gory. However, beware if your renting this to see Margot Kidder, she has a very small role unfortunately. However, the rest of the class is quite good especially the George character.
This film is full of arresting images, the clown stepping out of a bureau, and waving goodbye as a victim falls off the roof to his demise.
Though you may guess the identity of the killer early on, the film is still suspenseful with many good chase sequences.",980121600,2,504,4.549450549450549
1236862,2,B00000JLX8,"This independent Candadian film start's off promisingly enough with story and scene set-up's but fall's short of any suspense or horror through-out and is therefore dull,dull,dull particularly as it build's up to the climax  all is very predtictable. Unfortunately for it begins fine enough but never  capture's or build's upon any real tension,horror or suspense the musical  score could've added much needed tension but doesn't deliver the only good  aspect's to this less than average so-called horror flick is it's cast whom  all are fine and just manage to hold it together for any watchability or  interest though I'm unfamiliar with most of them except James Duval(Mars  Attacks!)and breifly on-screen Margot Kidder and Christopher Plummer both  whom deserved more screen-time though in a better movie also thumb's-Up to  actor's Sarah Lassez,Tatyana Ali and other's. Rent it only if you have  nothing else better to do or there's nothing new to rent at your video  store,Clown at midnight is not gory which I'm in favor of but in this case  it couldn't of hurt.",963878400,,1069,5.115606936416185
1236863,5,B00000JLX8,"This movie was almost perfect.  The acting is poor, by everyone except James Duval.  But the horror is great.  It does not seem that scary, but you will keep getting frightened more and more even though you won't know  why. I think it is because for once, you do not want the people in the  movie to die.  Usually you could take or leave the characters, but you see  that none of these people really deserve to die.  Its like the death of  Randy in Scream 2, just every character is like that.  Also there is not a  lot of gore at all, they give you just enough to make girls scream and grip  to you (literally, if the girl is afraid of clowns) but it doenst gross you  out, or over do it on the blood.  Still don't eat while you're watching it,  it's just a bad move to make.",961459200,,776,4.046357615894039
1236864,5,B00000JLX8,"i forgot to mention! you should get this movie on DVD!  That way you can pause Tatyana Ali's cleavetch shots and it would be clear!  By the way, a white girl gets naked in this movie.",955065600,,183,4.055555555555555
1236865,3,B00000JLX8,"Theater students working at an old operahouse are butchered by a man dressed as a clown who had a complicated past with one of their mothers... and killed her. Though, extremely pathetic at times, this slasher tends to  be a great deal scarier than most big-budget gorefest slashers and the lead  actress is very talented. Kidder and Plummer are great additions to the  cast.",951609600,,375,4.828125
7913228,5,B00000JLX8,"Being the evil clown fanatic that I am, I had to check out this movie. At first I wasn't too fond of it when I saw the trailer but me being the clown lover I am couldn't resist and I had to give it a watch. I'm glad I did as it turned out to be a good movie

The Clown At Midnight is about a group of 7 high school teens who have been chosen to help refurbish a decrepit opera house. Many years prior, opera singer, Lorraine Sedgewick was murdered in her dressing room by opera Pagliacci, Lorenzo Orsini. When Orsini was thought to have fled to Europe afterwards, the opera house was closed down out of fear that he would return and kill again. Now, high school students Kate, Monica, Cheryl, George, Marty, Ashley, and her boyfriend Taylor have all been chosen to reconstruct the opera house with the aid of nuisance teacher, Ms. Gibby.

Not too long after, Kate, who happens to be the deceased Lorraine's daughter, is plagued with horrible visions of her mother's murder. The more time Kate spends in the opera house, her visions begin to clearly piece together her mother's death, when she ends up discovering she's linked to the alleged clown killer. As Kate tries to solve the eerie mystery of Lorraine's death, her peers are being gruesomely killed off one by one until she's the only one left. Will Kate find the answers she's looking for or will she too suffer the same fate her mother and friends are facing?

Overall: This is a really good clown movie, despite what others may say. The clown in this movie is just downright creepy! The faces he makes when he stalks his victims are beyond creeper status. The clown is no Pennywise, but he's horrifying in his own way. The plot of the film is decently solid and takes a somewhat predictable twist nearing the end. This is a teen slasher with a lot of typical teen characters. You have your hot but stuck-up and pretentious blonde, the nerd, the gay, the borderline douchebag football player, and the interesting loner. However, because this movie was made in the 1998 and many 80s and 90s horror movies had stereotypical characters, it's forgivable. If you're looking for a creepy clown horror movie, watch Clown At Midnight!",1398384000,,2184,4.566326530612245
7913229,3,B00000JLX8,"For a description of the plot, etc., read other reviews.  Just some thoughts on this movie...

The Clown At Midnight (1999) is a Canadian teen slasher movie that takes place mainly inside an old opera house where a killer clown stalks his victims.  That's the unique part of this movie - the opera house setting.  The killer clown concept?  We've all seen it before, but some movies of this type are better than this one (such as ""It"" and ""Clownhouse"").  The killer clown reminds me of Michael Myers, only he's a clown who talks.  The death scenes are well done.  The special effects are good, as is the makeup.  The kids in this movie seem to fight back pretty well, unlike in a lot of slasher movies where kids seem to lack any ability to fight back.

Look for Margot Kidder in a supporting role.  We all know her from such movies as Black Christmas (1974), The Amityville Horror (1979), and the Superman movies.  The acting in this movie is average.  The musical score is decent.

I recommend this flick to all fans of slasher movies to see at least once.",1339459200,,1058,4.471204188481676
7913230,5,B00000JLX8,i saw this movie in 1999 when i was 11 yrs old. i didn't off into much but after 2000 came and went i loved ever since. it is scary and has a good story line. unlike most today this film is a good movie if u are into horror films. i'm not fan of any video to video horror films but this was the best i loved it.,1274832000,,311,3.5217391304347827
7913231,5,B00000JLX8,I found this movie very enjoyable to watch. I am glad that I was able to buy it. I would also like to get it on DVD.,1243036800,,116,3.3333333333333335
7913232,1,B00000JLX8,"from beginning to bloody retarded end this is diffently a cheesy slasher movie without a doubt. this has kids volunteering at an abandoned theatre which is reopened and they soon find out that one of their friends mom was murdered in the building and that same son of a (...)that killed her mother is still in there and it comes out at midnight and kills them off one by one. obviously predictable and you know who is going to die right away in order. I laughed my ass off when the clown electrocuted that (...)student in the electric chair. It just gave me the giggles it was so horrible. This natural disaster of a movie stars Christopher Plummer and Margot Kidder for some reason, maybe they were bored and didn't have anything else to do. James DuVal stars in other movie with Sarah Lassez, they co starred in the apocalyptic teen movie Nowhere. This would freak out a person if there afraid of clowns but I tell ya it's not that scary.",1098144000,,940,4.47093023255814
7913233,1,B00000JLX8,"K, so this movie was pretty weak...hello, they didn't freakin make out at the end! We were waiting for George and Kate to start gettin' freaky and the wuss just hugged her head...what's that all about? He needs to work on his game. The sex scene was definitely entertaining...talk about how you give the guy props from hitting it from the backside...and the intertwining of the sword fight was classic. Hmm, maybe I should give it 2 stars instead...",1066521600,,449,4.69620253164557
7913234,2,B00000JLX8,"Have a thing for evil clowns? Then, as the genre isn't all that prevelant, you'll probably be moved to see this thing once, anyway. But ""IT"" (first half) and ""Killer Klowns from Outer Space"" this ain't. Heck, this ain't even ""Clownhouse"".This is a Canadian production attempting to cash in on the Scream/I Know What You Did brand of teenage slashers, but it falls dreadfully flatThe characters are obnoxious and truly awful, and the acting is terrible. The story fails to take advantage of its potentially promising opera house setting, and the killer, a man in ""Pagliacci"" makeup, is a bore. The film can't seem to generate the creepiness it aspires to, and lacks what it takes to make a psychotic clown story work: sardonic wit. There is no wit here, sardonic or otherwise. And, by the way, what's with Margot Kidder and Christopher Plummer getting top billing on the video box, when they don't even appear on the cover with the rest of the cast?Come to think of it, what is the great Christopher Plummer doing here at all?This is exactly the sort of movie you would expect to find a faded, single-claim-to-fame star like Margot Kidder in, but Plummer? If his pockets were THAT empty, surely he could have found higher paying work as a Klingon or something.",1032480000,,1259,4.7534246575342465
