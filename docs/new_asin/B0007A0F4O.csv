2207281,4,B0007A0F4O,"I rented &#8220;Dead Birds&#8221; because of the cool cover box, expecting a blast of cheesy horror fun.  Well imagine my surprise that when I popped this baby in I got a completely different type of horror movie than expected.  This is not a cheesy b-horror flick, rather it's a moody, dead-serious piece of period horror that did a great job of scaring me stiff.

The movie takes place in 1863 Fairhope, Alabama.  A bank robbery by a group of confederate soldiers looking for gold ends in a bloodshed with several innocent by-standers dead and the authorities hot on their trail.  The soldiers flee the town and head into the boonies, finally stopping at an old abandoned plantation deep in the cornfields.  What seems like the perfect hiding place soon turns into a horrific sejourn for the soldiers who find themselves at the mercy of supernatural forces.

This is not a pulpy horror movie nor does it bear any resemblance to say, Hitchcock's &#8220;The Birds&#8221;.  There are no &#8220;Dead Birds&#8221; swooping down and attacking the group, rather the evils lurking within the plantation are its ghostly undead inhabitants, trapped inside its walls for decades.  Anyone expecting a fast-paced horror film might be disappointed; &#8220;Dead Birds&#8221; takes its time setting up the premise but it does such a masterful job at building up suspense and scary scenes (through music, convincing acting, well-done effects) that the slow pace can be forgiven.  This film also looks great, I loved the horse-back ventures into wilderness, the costumes, even the accents were convincing.  At no time did I not get the feeling that the action was to be taking place in 1863.

But while &#8220;Dead Birds&#8221; is a high quality horror film there are a few things missing in order to elevate it to classic or 5-star status.  For one, I found the group of characters a little hard to sympathize with.  From the start, they are presented to us as ruthless gold-digging killers who barely shed a tear at the bloodshed (including the death of a small boy) they left behind in the town.  I found myself rooting for the supernatural forces to mow them down.  Problem is, &#8220;Dead Birds&#8221; lacks villains that we can side with as they are unseen presences during the movie until near the end.  I also would have liked there to be more blood and a faster pace.  But despite these minor qualms &#8220;Dead Birds&#8221; stands as a stylish, well-made piece of horror that while probably a little bit weird for the casual viewer, is bound to please most horror enthusiasts.",1111276800,3,2570,4.923433874709977
2207282,5,B0007A0F4O,"I'm a huge fan of the horror genre, and nothing scares me. For many year's I've looked for a truly scary, under your skin type movie that leaves you jittery and sick, after many years of looking, i finally found it, Dead Birds. This movie is disturbing, creepy, atmospheric, and is perhaps the scariest movie i have ever seen. When a group of soldiers make way into a house for the night with a bundel of gold they had just stolen from a bank, they take refuge in an old abandoned house. The house has its secrets that are locked within the spirits that haunt the house, and as time wears on each character becomes more and more aware to the horrors that took place. Filled with creepy and disturbing settings, gore (there aren't many kills, but when they happen, they are strong, graphic, and very bloody) - many disturbing images, many scenes that make you jump, and an overall terrifying but yet joyful horror ride that will stay under your skin for more than one night - do not watch it at night - it will scare the daylights out of you, just as it did me.",1111017600,5,1060,4.358585858585859
2207283,4,B0007A0F4O,"When I first saw the preview for this movie I had a feeling it would proove to be interesting and I was right. It is actually one of the creepiest movies I've seen in a long time. Great sound and setting, and an a fun plot. The acting was decent and the special effects fairly convincing. It surprises me how so many truely bad movies have made it to the theaters in recent times, yet a movie such as this is passed on as simply another b-movie flick. Especially when it comes to horror movies such as Darkness or Alone In The Dark! How a movies like Darkness or Alone In The Dark made it to the any theaters at all is sad and yet a decent horror flick such as this hardly gets any notice at all.  I'm not saying this movie is for everyone, but die-hard horror fanatics should enjoy it and anyone who is in the mood for a spooky flick that is a little different should pick it up. It reminded me of Dog Soldiers, a movie that got hardly any publicity yet turned out to be one of the best horror movies of 2002.",1110931200,,1010,4.075376884422111
2207284,5,B0007A0F4O,"I LOVE horror movies and can usually watch them without hiding my eyes but this one...brrrrrr!!!  SUCH a sense of dread about it!  And the wonderful setting in an old Alabama plantation.  AND the absolutely horrific creatures!  I think this is one of the most truly original horror movies I've ever seen, directed by first-time feature film director Alex Turner and written by Simon Barrett with the unique setting of the Civil War South.  The cast is great, led by Henry Thomas (""All the Pretty Horses"", ""ET""), Patrick Fugit (""Almost Famous""), Isaiah Washington (""Ghost Ship"") and Nicki Aycox (""Jeepers Creepers II"") and the production design by Leslie Keel (""May"") is wonderful although I believe that, like the remake of ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", most of the movie was filmed in the actual plantation.  Which makes the atmosphere all the more realistic.  The cinematography is amazing as well, done by Steve Yedlin (""May"", ""Toolbox Murders"" [2005]) in a sort of sepia tone that brings the era to life.  The plot is fairly simple - a band of Confederate deserters bloodily rob a bank of it's gold and hide out in a plantation that one of the men had been told about by a former war comrade.  A storm traps them there and then the ""fun"" begins as they each start suspecting the other of things that are happening around them (sinister noises, disappearances, ghastly visions, etc.).  Claustrophobic, creepy, horrifying images, gore - it's all there for horror fans.  HIGHLY recommended!!  And VERY disturbing - DON'T look under your bed after watching this!  OR go playing in a cornfield!",1110844800,85,1590,4.932330827067669

2207380,3,B0007A0F4O,"I suffer from a plague. Whenever I see a monster or ghost movie nowadays, I always think, ""How would Geralt handle this?"" If you've never heard of The Witcher 3, you should move on to the next paragraph. You should move on to the next paragraph anyways.

The film begins with a group of robbers during the American Civil War. They rob a bank and get in a few felony murders too. Then they're on their way to Mexico with all dat phat gold. Tragically they needed to stop for the night and happen upon a house. Said house happens to be haunted. If you're wondering what nightmarish creatures inhabit this house, then check out the cover art, because that's exactly what it looks like. What proceeds is a formulaic haunted house movie, and the tropes are abundant (but keep in mind this is from 2004 after all). For example, there are flashing jump scares where the character sees for a second something horrific that's intended to scare the audience, but the character pretends everything's okay. What do I mean? Scene: a thick downpour outside the window lit up by brief flashes of lightning and thunder. A man walks to the window. A flash, and he catches the brief image of a hollow demonic face in the watery glass. He goes on, calm as as a lake in winter. Must be hallucinating. He was yawning earlier too! Must be the ole' brain fogging up. Well I don't know about you but if I saw a demonic face flashing in my f*****g window at night, I'd probably do a little more than keep on walking, no matter how tired I am. I definitely wouldn't chalk it up to sleep deprivation and keep on walking by my lonesome to the basement door, from where I had previously heard strange noises.

Now -- if you see a little girl appear out of nowhere, crying in the corner and her face hidden by a mess of long black hair -- run the fick away!

Ultimately, I give it three stars, for the unique Civil War setting (I've seen ghost-horror movies set during WWI, WWII, even the Vietnam War, but this is the first Civil War one), for the somewhat surprise ending, and for the fact that everybody at least showed up at the haunted house with guns.",1512086400,,2126,4.404580152671755

They didn't know about germs) and some of the sets--like a 1970s door at the bank--stood out like sore thumbs, but overall I found the story interesting.  It held up.

The back story of what happened in the house is a much more compelling story than the one told here where some people at stuck in an old house and then start being killed one by one like thats never been done before! Since its been done so many times previously you need to add something that gets the viewers attention beyond the obvious expectations. A western setting didn't add much nor did the cast. The creatures were good and both the opening and the ending were good but there was a lot of dullness in between.

The setting & costumes were done well where other areas of this film were not. I agree with another reviewer about the lanterns. I never say anyone light or refuel one, yet they never went out. Like electricity or batteries were operating them. I didn't see any realistic plot unless it's the (spoiler) apparitions appearing from an obviously ghastly happening in that mansion, something to do with the previous owners' family & voodoo. Over all, it held me till the end. Then the viewer sees it starts all over again.

2207431,3,B0007A0F4O,"Bizarre film. Set during the Civil War in 1863. Bank robbers hide out in a deserted antebellum home on a large plantation. Unfortunately for them, it isn't as deserted as they were led to believe, and before long, all hell breaks loose.

Some good acting and an eerie soundtrack. The effects are pretty good but redundant for the most part. Very lazy cinematography when it comes to the frequently-used lanterns. They are very obviously battery-operated bulbs, and no attempts were made for realism -- no flickering, and they provide no light/cast no shadows due to being overpowered by the ambient lighting present in all scenes but one (sorry, that's the photographer in me speaking, but I do believe that it should be obvious to most everyone after awhile).

The horror-western isn't a subgenre we see too much of, and that might be a good thing. To put it simply, it isn't easy combining the Cowboydusty all-American hero on a horse holding a sixgunwith horror imagery like ghosts, aliens, and other supernatural entities. If you're interested in seeing one of the few films that has pulled it off extremely well, you need to pick up Dead Birds. The plot is simple: a bunch of rugged outlaw bank robbers hide out in haunted house and wait for morning to come. I wouldn't be spoiling much by telling you that their sunny morning never comes. I'm a sucker for ""all-in-one-night"" type horror films. When everything's condensed to a few hours it gives a sense of claustrophobic urgency and tension to the situation.

Dead Birds is a small indie that transcends it's small budget with a strong cast, eerie atmosphere, a creepy-house-in-a-cornfield location, and an ever-present sense of dread, tension, and mystery. The movie never goes for cheese or camp. The whole affair is competently directed, well-filmed, and played with a straight face.

 Basically a gritty gang rob a bank, blow everyone away, and high-tail it through the wilderness to an old house where they plan to lay low for the night. Come dawn they hope to cross the border and be home free in Mexico with their share of the gold. Problem is, that hiding place ain't no safe zone. There's something there. Something evil waiting in the dark corners of the basement and behind the old walls, hungry to consume anyone who trespasses upon its unholy grounds. I won't tell you who or what that ""evil"" is, but it's something far worse than the badge-wearing justice our outlaws are running from. Speaking of our crew of cowboy villains, these dudes are total scumbags. I love that about Dead Birds. They're all dirty, low-down thrives with no loyalty or love beyond greed for the gold. The cast is comprised of some cool character actors like Michael Shannon (Shotgun Stories, The Iceman), Patrick Fugit (the show Outcast), Mark Boone Junior (30 Days of Night), and Isaiah Washington (Blue Caprice). All give solid performances as the rugged posse under attack by the sinister entities in the Things really start to get interesting when the evil presence provokes in-fighting, distrust, and bloody death among our thieving bunch.

 Don't be mistaken, Dead Birds is indeed a flawed film, mostly on account of some laughably bad CGI in the opening scene, and an incoherent third act. The film's slow-burning pace will undoubtedly feel like crawling tedium for some viewers. But what the flick lacks in clarity and quick pacing, it pays off with eerie atmosphere, a cool haunted house and remote cornfield location, strong performances, and an ever-present sense of dread, tension, and mystery. There's a couple jump scares that'll get you good if you're playing along and there's some decent gore peppered throughout. All the horror stuff aside though, this movie is perfectly serviceable as a Civil War-era Western flick. If any of this sounds good to you, don't pass up on itwatch it alone in the dark and late at night and you'll have a great time with it. I'm happy to have this overlooked little gem in my collection especially because it improves with repeat viewings.",1452816000,,3282,4.906306306306306

When the band of outlaws passes through the cornfield, it is as if they have left the world of the living and entered another dark dimension isolated from everything.

2207495,4,B0007A0F4O,"This is a good little horror, quite creepy and shocking, with an atmosphere of deep mystery and growing terror and despair for the ""heroes"". This review contains some limited SPOILERS.

During the War Between States (1861-65), somewhere in Alabama, a bank is robbed by a bunch of outlaws (mostly deserters from Confederate Army). The bandits ride away with two bags of gold coin and at the end of the day stop to rest at an abandoned plantation in the middle of nowhere. Night comes, and the film really begins...

This is a well thought, well made and well interpreted little horror film, which uses all the possibilities offered by the place of action. The tension builds up slowly but regularly. The ""heroes"" will finally feel more and more desperation and panic, until at one moment we start to feel real pity for them, even if they are really bad people, with innocent blood on their hands. Actors were all unknown to me, but they played well - also, lack of big names helped to not know who will make it until the final credits.

Stephen King fans will certainly appreciate the important role played by the creepy field of corn surrounding the great main residence, although just to be clear, this film is in no way related to the already legendary ""Children of the corn"" short story or its numerous (rather pathetic) adaptations on screen...

2207514,3,B0007A0F4O,"Alas, there's simply not enough meat on these bird-like bones to warrant much excitement from the horror faithful, although Mr. Turner clearly has a talent for the genre. One expects bigger and better things from this guy in the future. If Dead Birds reeks of anything, it's untapped potential, and while Turner's debut effort doesn't leave all that much of a lasting impression, there's enough here to keep the faithful psyched for the guy's next efforts.

Dead Birds opens promisingly enough, as a cadre of seriously slimy confederate soldiers stage a brutal and blood-soaked robbery. They quickly hightail it over to a grim-looking plantation mansion, and it's there that they discover some seriously infuriated undead. That's pretty much it.

Since we're presented with only six (rather one-note) characters, we're reliant on merely a half-dozen kills to keep the movie flying along. Suffice to say they don't exactly do the trick. Aside from the bank-robbery intro, the first 60-some minutes of the film consist of characters wandering through dark rooms while brandishing lanterns. Occasionally something loud will hit the ground, thereby earning a cheap jolt from the audience.

Once the nocturnal wanderings start to peter out, we're offered a few puzzle pieces as to why this plantation is so darn haunted. It has to do with lunatic dads and terrorized kids, disease-stricken moms and tortured slaves. The culmination of these clues feels like something torn from an old Twilight Zone episode, and the late-stage revelations prove to be not all that fascinating after such an airy and arduous set-up.

But don't mistake my disappointment as a straight dismissal. As a lifelong loon for all things horror-centric, I was easily able to locate a handful of components that tickled my terror bone. Impressively enough, Turner was able to wrangle himself some fine actors for his little ghost story, including Henry Thomas, Patrick Fugit and Isaiah Washington. Actors with actual talent help to elevate familiar material, and such is certainly the case here. Thomas bites into the role of hateful bastard with a noticable tenacity, while Fugit and Washington anchor the flick through its intermittent spots of slowness. The standout of the cast is Michael Shannon, who clearly enjoys amping up the evil - so we're left to enjoy his demise a whole lot more.

Turner's directorial style captures the sweaty doom and late-night claustrophobia that comes part and parcel with a simple ghost story, but he also relies too heavily on fake scares and ponderously presented flashback revelations. Further, if you have a movie with only six characters, it's perhaps not a good idea to have a few of them simply disappear from the plot for 20 minutes at a tme. ""Is that one guy dead?"" and ""Wait, what happened to the fat guy?"" are not questions one needs careening through their heads while trying to enjoy a simple horror movie.

There's nothing about Dead Birds that could accurately be described as terrible or insipid, but the end result is a concept we've seen a hundred times before, and 65 of those other movies are markedly more entertaining than this one. The old-west setting seems to exist for no reason other than to let the actors talk with a twang and wear funny hats, so one wonders why Turner and company even bothered using this time frame. And once the movie gets down to the actual goopy mayhem that the horror hounds know and love, you've already withstood about an hour of material that's quite simply not all that interesting.

""Dead Birds"" is directed with a lot more flair than it's written with, and Alex Turner could very well be an up-and-coming horror helmer to keep both eyes upon. And perhaps I was just a little too pre-psyched up for what essentially amounts to yet another predictably gothic ghost story, but the final product left me a little unenthused. Horror fans should absolutely wait around for ""Dead Birds"" and decide for themselves, because it's certainly not a terrible little movie. I expect the flick to find a small-but-vocal cult fanbase once ""Dead Birds"" hits the DVD shelves, but (unfortunately for me) I won't be among their ranks. Not too shabby for a debut effort, but not nearly unique or exciting enough to warrant my enthusiastic endorsement.",1275264000,3,4291,5.00140056022409
2207515,4,B0007A0F4O,"If you are looking for a body count and buckets of blood, look elsewhere, but if you are in the mood of a character driven film with a slow but creepy build, DEAD BIRDS will not disappoint. A band of Civil War-era thieves take refuge in a secluded farmhouse, but the sins of the past catch up with them as the men encounter a swarm of demons that have taken permanent residence in the location. The film uses a minimalist score that sends shivers down the spine as ambient sounds drone in the background while the characters search dimly lit hallways with faceless demons hiding in the shadows. The creature designs can best be described as amorphous humanoid blobs with black voids for eyes and razor sharp teeth and claws. Though the film isn't FX heavy, the scenes where we do encounter these terrors are frightening and intriguing at the same time. There are many surreal and nightmarish sequences that demand repeat viewings for the viewer to unlock the true meaning behind, while figuring out how the dead birds play into the picture. This is a solid Indie effort with high production values and a great cast, well worth seeking out for anyone that hasn't seen it yet!

Then you have to forget about the thing you saw in the middle of the cornfield. You also have to get past the distrust you have for almost everyone with you, and you also have to slip out of those pesky ""the walls are closing in on me sensations."" After all that is said and done, you have to watch out for the weird things happening outside, inside, upstairs and down, and you have to stay alive.
It really is getting harder to get paid these days.

When I first saw Dead Birds, I caught it on some late scarathon and, honestly, I almost skipped it. The name, the people; everything seemed like it was going to lead south (pardon the wordplay). Something happened, however, and the movie got, well, good. This made me go out and pick up the DVD because I wanted to see if the night was just really long, if I had been a little too much out of my element, or if I was really that impressed. And, well, I was that impressed by the movie. The DVD did it for me, making the movie that I wanted to laugh at really give me something to look forward to when I told my friends to ""check this out.""

Normally pieces set sometime other than ""now are a bother to trifle with. Not only do you have bad acting, but you have bad monsters to go along with them. Dead Birds was different, though, because it took everything about that time and made it that-much-worse. slavery, demons, hay (you know that stuff will make you sneeze); everything put you on edge when you watched it. You could tell that it was going to be that way when the first ""oddity"" popped up as our little group approached that house and saw the thing that was running toward them. Things didn't stop there, either, nor did they slow down. Through some nice twists we saw what happened in that house (and I have to say I'm glad I never lived, subletted, or even walked in the place), and other twists kept things going.
You have to love greed - it makes people do stupid things that you can understand -- to a point.

Should you watch it? Yes. you will like it and it will surprise you, bringing a nice touch of horror into your life. It feels odd to say that these days, too, because too many movies have to spend a fortune to try to make something thrilling. This simply took something terrible, threw some people into the mix, and had fun.

2207529,5,B0007A0F4O,"Normally horror movies have some flaws, and this one is no exception, but um... first of all, I have a question:

How in the WORLD did that little boy who was haunting a Japanese home in the Grunge end up in Alabama during the Civil War for THIS movie?  That little boy must travel a lot, including back in time!

I'm of course talking about that freaky little boy hiding under the bed during that one scene that freaked the woman out.

This horror movie had some incredibly graphic scenes during the beginning, such as the actual bank robbery when blood and guts were shooting all over the wall.  Exaggerated, but great fun for horror lovers.

When the cowboys who robbed the bank ended up in a gigantic creepy house surrounded by a field in the middle of nowhere on some farmland in Alabama with no entrance to the house in sight, and the distant sounds of a thunderstorm started rolling in with a gloomy picture as the cowboys got closer to the home, I KNEW this was going to be a good movie.

One thing that impressed me a lot about Dead Birds is when the cowboys were exploring the house, you could hear a quiet howling sound that eerily echoed throughout the house.  This is something those old Silent Hill video games did so extremely well- it adds *tremendous* atmosphere.

Much of the storyline focus was on protecting the gold the bank robbers had collected from the bank.  It was incredibly important for these cowboys to keep a close eye on the gold.  Since they were ALL bad guys, they couldn't even trust each other, so someone had to keep a close eye on the gold at all times.

As the other cowboys would wander off alone through the house, or even outside the house, they'd constantly hear the sounds of whispering, children talking, or some other noises, leading them to think someone was in the house with them... and there WAS someone in the house with them- demon spirits!  But they didn't know it at first.

This is just a quality horror film in my opinion.  You need atmosphere and a slow build-up to appreciate the actual suspense, and the movie delivers here.  Some of the action scenes involving the confrontations with the cowboys and the demons were a little tacky I admit, but other than that, this movie was pure awesome sauce from beginning to end.",1247961600,,2278,4.519512195121951
2207530,3,B0007A0F4O,"Just so you know, I wasn't scared by ""Dead Birds."" Perhaps slightly creeped out, but not frightened, shocked, or spooked. The film promised to be a sampling of traditional American horror just as the genre was being taken over by gory torture-porn flicks, but while it does indeed moderate its violent content, it's just not scary. Essentially, ""Dead Birds"" is a well-made DTV film that practices some tried-and-true horror methods, but this bird just failed to fly as far as I'm concerned.

The plot follows a band of 1860s bank robbers - played by Henry Thomas, Patrick Fugit, Nicki Aycox, Isaiah Washington, Michael Shannon, and Mark Boone, Jr. - as they spend a fateful night in an abandoned farmhouse, haunted by the restless memories of an atrocity long past.

As they approach the farmhouse, the group encounters and kills a large, dog-humanoid creature. They observe its carcass for about 20 seconds before moving on, and throughout the terrors of the same night, they never consider that maybe the monster had something to do with what's happening to them. I wish they were less dense, but luckily that's pretty much the only example of outright stupidity on their behalf. They're not bad characters.

The acting and production, for the most part, are pretty good. Nicki Aycox has some weak moments and Isaiah Washington doesn't do as much with his role as I had hoped, but those are minor nitpicks when considering the overall satisfactory show the cast puts on. Nothing in the movie itself is as pretty as the opening titles, but as far as cinematography, lighting, CGI, and editing goes, ""Dead Birds"" is on the upper crust of the DTV production scale.

The film boasts some creepy imagery - the flashbacks, the scarecrow, and the creature in the loft in particular - that helps set the tone, but by and by, it leads up to little more than a handful of jump scares. The ""twist"" is hardly shocking after everything the audience has seen and ultimately does little more than frustrate viewers since it doesn't do a good job of explaining everything that's happened. Watching the film multiple times might help clear up some lingering questions, but whether anyone will want to see the movie more than once is questionable.

If you're new to the horror genre and insist on seeing something modern, then ""Dead Birds"" might be a good initiator to non-gore flicks, but I highly doubt that this will do anything for veterans.",1238198400,4,2429,4.843373493975903
2207531,3,B0007A0F4O,"Deadbirds is an above average low budget horror. The low budget actually does not show at all - pretty good actors, good sets, very good effects and make-up (I've seen a lot of horror movies, and this is one of the scariest-looking monsters I've seen yet), very effective score and use of sound. Dead Birds is genuinely creepy and scary. The setting is suitably isolated by geography and weather, and the Civil War setting adds a nice twist which does actually add to the atmosphere.

Two problems I have: 1) the explanation for the goings-on is provided too abruptly and with a jarring lack of subtlety. I do believe that no holds barred horror movies still need some subtlety in order to be truly effective and to raise them up a notch, so this is a weakness in the script. Interestingly, the Making Of featurette reveals that the writer thought the original script was too oblique in its explanation - he apparently lacked the talent to find a happy medium. And 2) all of the main characters are pretty bad people - in the first 5 minutes of the movie they all participate in a bloody massacre of innocent people, so it's hard to root for them when things go bad.

Still, overall, a solid 3 or 3.5 stars. I don't know about you, but when I take a chance on movies like this I usually wind up regretting having shortened my life by 90 minutes. Contrarily, Dead Birds is well worth a rental for horror fans, and some may like it enough to buy it.",1236211200,,1447,4.43609022556391
2207532,4,B0007A0F4O,"The title really doesn't have much to do with the movie. When the characters of the movie arrive at their destination of death, one man looks down at the ground and mentions to the others that he notices a dead bird on the ground. This horror movie will catch you by surprise though with a non-dramatic title such as this one.

I am partial to certain classic eras and although I don't watch too many western movies, this one especially appealed to me. A time where people had very little possessions, this was not a time of abundance, it was a time of war, and hardship. There were no phones or electricity and your nearest neighbor lived miles away from you. I believe that in this era, when two people found love, it was an especially strong bond.

This movie has some fairly gruesome moments. However, the best part is the plot of a ghostly dwelling where a wicked man opens the spirit realm by performing ancient rituals to help bring his wife back to life. The man must make human sacrifices as a part of the ritual and starts with his servants then continues on with his children. Of course these things never go the way you plan, so evil beings are released and begin to take over the souls of the people this man has tortured and killed. They are transformed into hideous demon & animal looking creatures. The town folk notice the children missing and when the father does not tell them where his children are; they tie him up and make him a human scarecrow out in his cornfield.

The people that end up in that house during the movie are bank robbers. It doesn't seem that this is their usual profession but you can also tell that this is not their first time either. They seem to be nice enough. The group consists of one woman (Annabelle) with her boyfriend and 'man in charge' (William), the boyfriend's brother (Sam), a black man that is well-trusted (Todd), and two other men. Before the robbery, a so-called friend of the couple gives them the location of the estate and along the way they ask for directions and strangely no one else knows about this place. When they get to the house, they put the bags of gold on the table and start to investigate. The first thing they find is a book with bizarre writings and symbols; Todd tells William that it's a book of magic for bringing back the dead. Each one hears or sees something odd and they each start to disappear. Annabelle has a vision of what has actually been going on from the start given to her through an evil spirit in Sam that kills him after the vision is over.

Annabelle, William, and Todd are left in the end. Poor Todd sees the worst of it and gets the worst of it in the end. Of course, none leave alive. Now the evil beings have the gold in their possession and they do a good job in using that to lure their next houseguests.  I think it's a great horror movie from beginning to end. I left out almost all of the scary parts so you could see it for yourself!",1234656000,,2943,4.353369763205829
2207533,5,B0007A0F4O,"After reluctantly renting it, I found I really liked this movie. I must confess I'm an old school monster movie fan. I don't care much for the modern slash and slaughter school of horror. I don't think dreading the next extreme gore moment in a film is really the same as evoking true fear.
  I think the success of the modern school of Japanese horror comes from the fact that the films are genuinely spooky and create real fear. Dead Birds is a similar film in that it is really creepy and takes its time creating a mood of true fear. It is a supernatural ghost story with a near Lovecraftian twist. Actually, the film rather defies being categorized as a simple ghost story; it could also be called a dimensional crossover story similar to H.P. Lovecraft's fiction. I liked that it was not the usual predictable murder-a-minute slasher flick. No high-speed zombies sprinting about in this movie.
  For those who are looking for a little more originality in a horror film, I suggest you check out Dead Birds.",1232496000,,1010,4.625698324022347

This movie is so creepy.  I notice the other reviewers have used the same word.  This makes it different from several other horror movies, in that it does not rely on blood and guts to get under your skin.  It does it by using your mind against you.

The movie takes place in a time-period not normally picked for horror movies.  This ups the ante for a 5-star rating, just for being different.

The acting is good, adding a woman and a free black man gives a twist.  Then you have good and bad guys w/in the same group.  Excellent to watch it unfold.

'Hidden easter eggs' abound.  Watch the mirrors in backgrounds and freeze-frames on quickly opening doors.  I missed these until someone told me... and WOW!

Slowly, the viewer comes to the recognition that something else is happening besides the place being haunted and even why, and that 'something' rocks the movie on the creepiness scale.

2207536,4,B0007A0F4O,"'Dead Birds' is an interesting and unpredictable horror movie.  It's a haunted house thriller with ambivalent twists and turns and a cock-sure sturdy ambiguous ending.
It's well acted by a cast of (to me!) unknowns, has scary effects and drips with American Civil War sweaty intensity.

The characters are unsympathetic. The 'hero' kills a child in the 'Wild Bunch' style opening scene and thereby opens the obligatory can of worms without whose opening, nothing in a horror movie can happen.

'Dead Birds' is a bit like Ken Russell's 'Gothic' in a sense. A brigade of strung-out desperadoes, stranded in a stormy old mansion, trying to differentiate between what's real and what's an extension of their own particular hidden insecurities and terrors.
While Russell's film is more oblique, the dangers the protagonists face are generally harmless in a physical sense, in 'Dead birds' they're very real. And just as in'`Gothic', the building itself is the true embodiment and personification of the evil the fragile, injured souls must face head on.

It's directed by some-one called Alex Turner, hardly a name to get the gore-hounds salivating; but on this showing, some-one with something resembling honest affection and respect for the genre. He handles the action well, keeps the frenzy and hysteria in check and isn't frightened of clich or homage.
Turner throws anything and everything at his film, see's what sticks, then edits and prints. It works for him; 'Dead Birds' is spooky, bloody and suspenseful, and it's not every schlocker which can boast all three attributes.

'Dead Birds' is a good, strong beast, fattened by the spirits of Peckinpah and early Carpenter, brought to the table in perfect health, and then had it's throat slashed before your very eyes.

Definitely something to crow about......",1211587200,3,1813,5.170648464163823

2207550,4,B0007A0F4O,"One of the things the more thoughtful horror films strive for is not to make you jump, which is easy to do, but to give you a serious sense of unease and dread. On that score alone, DEAD BIRDS more than succeeds. Set in rural Alabama during the Civil War, the film centers upon a group of outlaws who steal a fortune in Confederate gold from a small town bank; they retreat to an abandoned plantation where they are trapped for the night during a terrible thunderstorm--and they slowly realize they are not alone. The film makes a terrible false start with a ridiculously violent bank shootout that features one man's head being shot off completely, but after that misstep it finds its way, particularly by the time night falls. The story is never completely clear (there's a twist at the end that is only fully explained in the director's commentary extra), but the director, Alex Turner, does a marvelous job evoking atmosphere: he is helped out immensely by the film's gorgeously eerie cinematography (by Steve Yedlin) and its disturbing and intelligent score (by Peter Lopez). The unusually strong cast, headed by Henry Thomas and Isaiah Washington, helps things out very much too, as does the house itself. It has a wonderfully creepy basement, and the high empty upper-floor hallways with faded wallpaper, glowing rosey-red under lanterns' light, is an image not easily dismissed.",1201824000,2,1386,4.927350427350428

The story was something different for a horror movie and had a lot of potential. On top of that the production design was good, the monsters were pretty eerie and the actors did a good job.

The problem is that the movie should have been tighter. It really could have used more tension. Even though the movie was atmospheric, there were too many long stretches of not much happening. The direction and editing were sort of lackluster, which is a shame.

Also, the music (while very good) never seemed to fit what was happening on the screen. For the most part, it sounded like 'generic creepy music' that was running in the background.

I was going to rate this one two stars, but really it deserves (a little) better than that. There are some problems here, but there are good points too. Should you buy it? I'd say no. Should you rent it? Go for it. There's a lot worse out there.",1201478400,,1000,4.308510638297872

2207553,2,B0007A0F4O,"The movie started out interesting and I have to admit I did enjoy watching it through.  The setup was fair but about the mid-point things just start to go onto cruise control and become typical horror movie stuff.  For me it felt like the movie started out with its own uniqueness and then that fell away later leaving this movie with nothing to set it apart.  In addition, there were are couple of convoluted scenes and plot/story holes that I felt did not get resolved.

The movie opens with a group of men (well, one woman too) stealing some bags of gold coin from a bank in some southern locale (I'm sure it said where the story was supposed to be based in the opening somewhere) killing a large number of people in the process, many of the deaths unnecessary.  Some reviewers have commented that this sequence was gruesome but I found it phony (don't worry, the special effects do get a little better).

So, after the robbery the group takes refuge in some abandoned plantation house surrounded by an eerie corn field.  The movie stops in a couple parts to tell you how they knew of this plantation and who it belonged to, but I never found that story to be fully developed.  Did the person that told them about the plantation tell them so in passing or did he expect them to eventually take refuge there? If the latter, why did he want them to go there?

Anyway, things are not as peaceful as they seem.  Soon we meet ghostly manifestations that want to do harm to our bandits but always do so off the screen so we are left with an idea what happened to them but we don't actually get to see it.  The motivation behind the ghosts threatening behavior is made known by one ghost in specific who tells one of our hapless robbers everything you had been asking yourself up to that point in a succinct and straight-forward ""I had to do it"" speech.  Hmm, OK, so there is all the mystery gone.  Now it is just a matter of killing people off and there isn't anything particularly original and scary about how that is done.  I admit the beast in the corn field both at the beginning and then end was pretty cool though.

As far as acting goes, I thought it was on par with my expectations of what it should be.  The gentleman who also starred in ""Almost Famous"" (I'm too lazy to look up his name right now) I felt especially did a fine job.

Overall, I wasn't impressed with the movie and didn't think it was the sleeper hit that much of the hype around it had led me to believe it would be.",1185926400,2,2489,4.318279569892473

There is also the subplot of the original owner who turned his children into little sneaky things with sharp teeth via cutting up his slaves.

2207569,5,B0007A0F4O,"""Dead Birds"" is a period piece haunted house story, set in the American South of 1863, with Civil War undertones. That may seem like a strange plot for a film, but, in this case it 99.9% works.

Henry Thomas has come a long way since E.T. and is almost unrecognizeable as the lead in this film, which, other than Isaiah Washington, features a slew of little known actors. A band of bank robbers, disguised as rebel soldiers holes up in an old abandoned house that they learned of from a young soldier who has since died. Trapped in this house, surrounded on all sides by a dead cornfield, they wait for dawn, while the past evil of the house slowly tries to consume them one by one....

....more than that and I'd spoil the plot. This is horror in the tradition of ""Session 9"", not the recent spate of Japanese remakes like ""The Grudge"" and ""The Ring"" and its a far cry from the latest Hollywood offerings like ""Jeepers Creepers"" and such.

The evil isn't trumped up then shoved down your throat as if you don't have a brain, and the demons are kept offscreen just enough to never become unscary. The anticipation of the scare in this film, is as big a payoff as the scare itself.

Although not perfect, since it follows tried and true ""nobody would go in there"" horror film formulas, it delivers wholeheartedly on the spookiness scale. Well worth your time..... pop it in, kill the lights and enjoy.",1161820800,6,1400,4.5

I really like psychological thrillers, and would consider this one, because they rely more on the viewers imagination rather than supply them with the images.

This film begins with civil war renegades who rob confederates of their gold, in turn killing those who were at the bank. Then, they go to hide out in a place that was recommended to them.  It happens to be an old farm house, in the middle of nowhere, presumed abandoned, but only to the naked eye.  Something is very wrong with the house.

It is set in the 1800's which made it boring for me right from the beginning. The movie is about a group of bank robbers who hide out in a abandoned house. It is more of a western type movie than horror movie. The only good part of the movie was when the ghostly images appear but their faces remind me of the rediculous face of the killer in the Scream movies.

The best part, however, is that the creepy atmosphere was masterfully done, and didn't waver during any part of the movie. Most supposed horror movies fall flat in this regard, unfortunately.

HOWEVER.

This movie was disjointed, had bad continuance between scenes and special effects and made no sense at all. (if anyone can explain this movie to me, please please feel free to).

1. Why was it called Dead Birds? There was only ONE dead bird (as far as I could see) which one poor unfortunate stepped on prior to entering the ""haunted house"". What relevance did that have to anything? I mean, I grew up in the country and have seen PLENTY of dead birds, and have been the cause of death to the odd bird here and there, and there isn't really anything nefarious about ONE DEAD BIRD - which looked dead. No fangs, no rolling beady little eyes as it reanimates itself and lunges for someone's jugular. One dead bird. Blink, and you'd miss it - i'm glad I didn't go and get some popcorn at that point or I'd have really been puzzled about what the movie name was in relation to.

2. The satanistic reanimating ritual.. Okay, the dad did some crazy slightly 'wrong' things to a bunch of slaves (which in itself is wrong obviously).. to reanimate his wife.. whom he killed. So you would THINK that he would perhaps have held off killing her if he'd have to go to all that effort sacrificing slaves (a noisy and tiring job) just to reanimate her (which obviously didn't work very well from the rest of the movie).

3. The demonic children.. Right.. so the premise (which I only deduced from watching the special features - please don't do this to yourself, you'll only witness some very drunken LA yobbos talking up a very bad movie) was that once the dad had reanimated his dead wife, that he killed, a portal was opened and his children became possessed by demons. You see these demon children wandering around in the movie looking pretty scary (YES THEY LOOK VERY SCARY AND IT'S FABULOUS.. BRAVO CREATURE PEOPLE, the only good part of this movie)

  But the demon children never actually do anything to anyone. They just go 'boo' and run away. No gnawing of achilles tendons or chewing someone's head off. So why were the outlaws scared of them? Not sure.. and neither were they really.

3. The footsteps that changed into creature feet...

Now this REALLY annoyed me, a minor complaint compaired to the mass confusion over the plot, but still.. how is it possible for a human which is going through a transformation into a demonic beast to leave BOOT footprints that then change into paw pads.. LOGICALLY the feet would have transformed into paws INSIDE the boots.

AND THE FINAL COMPLAINT..

Why did the outlaw turn into a demon thing? Were they all demon things? Why didn't we see that earlier?

God, I can't even be bothered to write anymore, the storyline is similar to something a 12 year old would put together with an 'easy but kooky' ending.. Pathetic. Don't bother seeing it unless you have to procastinate using a dvd (and the only dvd that's available is this one) because if you're not procrastinating you have an appointment to clean your toilet with a toothbrush.",1139875200,3,3155,4.56283185840708
2207591,4,B0007A0F4O,"Set in 1863 Alabama DEAD BIRDS starts promisingly, but more like a traditional although violent western movie. A platoon of Confederate soldiers have just delivered a huge amount of gold at a local bank, when a group of bandits ride into town, massacre the soldiers, bank teller and director (some good gore on display here)and make their escape on horseback. They take shelter in an abandoned plantation surrounded by large corn fields. Their plan is to hide for the night before fleeing to Mexico the next day. It goes without saying that things do not turn out as planned... When approaching the decrepit building they are attacked by a weird doglike creature. One of the bandits was shot in the bank robbery and his condition worsens.

Tensions among the group members mount and the plantation turns out to be an extremely creepy place. Soon the desperados discover that the place has a dark secret...

I won`t go into any more detail plotwise, but let me assure you that DEAD BIRDS is a very enjoyable and entertaining horror film that will have you on the edge of your seat. Admittedly, the basic premise of the movie (a group of bandits on the lam after a hold up taking shelter in an isolated building surrounded by cornfields and falling prey to a supernatural evil that lurks there) is ripped off from another horror film, the equally good 1988 SCARCECROWS. (It is however not a remake of the earlier film.) Okay, it may not be groundbreakingly inventive storywise, but this did not mar my enjoyment of DEAD BIRDS! The film is thick with creepy athmosphere, added by a good use of the location and excellent photography. The period setting works very well, and it is nice for once to not have the usual stupid teenagers, who much to my annoyance populate the vast majority of US horror films. All actors are convincing in their roles.

Particular mention must be made of the creatures, which really look cool. Nice design! With the exception of an exploding head in the shootout at the beginning of the film (which looks a bit hokey) the effects do not fail to convince. As for the gore: yes, there is a bit of it, but mostly at the beginning of the film (bloody bullet impacts, slashings, the aforementioned exploding head), so do not expect a gorefest.

There is nothing to complain about the DVD, too. The film is presented in its correct aspect ratio and looks good. Accompanying the movie are several interesting extra features:

There is a good making-of, which covers all aspects of the film from pre-production, script writing to shooting and features interviews with actors, newcomer director Alex TURNER, producers and crew. It is about half an hour long. Then there are deleted scenes with optional audio commentary by the director. Admittedly none of the scenes adds much to the finished film. There is also the theatrical trailer for DEAD BIRDS, which sells the film well, as well as trailers for ANACONDAS: THE HUNT FOR THE BLOOD ORCHID, RESIDENT EVIL: APOCALYPSE, THE GRUDGE (the US remake, not the Japanese original) and a Jean Claude VAN DAMME actioner WAKE OF DEATH.

2207592,4,B0007A0F4O,"If you're an H.P. Lovecraft fan, the books as well as the movie attempts, I think you'll enjoy this stylish, fairly original American Gothic horror film.  It's a grim mixture of Satanism, demonic possession, and mutated humanoids, all set during the Civil War, and I just can't escape the feeling the filmmakers were inspired directly, or indirectly, by Lovecraft's work.

Six brutal opportunists rob a Confederate gold shipment, killing all the innocents within the bank, and then on escaping, accidentally shoot and presumably kill a small boy.  The outlaws ride into unknown territory searching for a deserted Southern plantation they were told about by a dying Confederate soldier. Things begin on an unsettling note when a monstrous looking, hairless creature that may be a giant dog, or a wild boar, comes barreling out of the giant cornfield between them and the plantations mansion as though on the attack, and is shot dead by the leader, Matt (Henry Thomas of E.T. fame).

They reach the mansion - a huge, sprawling derelict larger than anything they, or we, have seen - just ahead of a violent storm.  With darkness upon them, and only lamp and candlelight to give comfort, they begin to experience waking and sleeping visions which tell the tale of a slave overseer who brought his dead wife back to life using an ancient book (Book of the Dead?) and grotesque forms of Satanic torture - only to find he's been had, ""They tricked me!"" - into damning himself, his wife, and his children, not to mention the hapless slaves and victims who crossed his path.

This is a grim and grizzly affair, with its fear deeply seated in the evil that men do, and the paths they take, and the grotesque changes they can undergo without even realizing it.  It will not be for everyone; this is a slow build up to the horror that ensues. And it is marred by a couple of predictable plot elements that could've been handled better.

2207596,4,B0007A0F4O,"Picture it: Alabama, 1863. A band of southerners robs a bank and high-tails it for Mexico, with an escape route that calls for a pit stop in an abandoned farmhouse. The six fugitives hole up for the night in the empty home, which turns out to be a critically bad idea. Starring Henry Thomas as William, the gang's ringleader.

Once this movie had been underway for a few minutes, a rather shocking something occurred to both me and my significant other almost simultaneously: these guys sounded southern. And by ""southern"" I don't mean, ""I took twenty hours of voice coach classes per week in order to nail down a y'all that would make anyone south of the Mason-Dixon line shoot French fries through his or her respective nose with laughter, because I'm a Damn Yankee and I'm not fooling anyone.""

What I mean is, they talked like the people who live around here do. Seriously. I was floored. You almost never hear a southern character sound like an honest-to-God southerner in the movies. Imported actors don't sound like they're from Georgia; they sound like they've had their consonants beaten out of them with a tray of cornbread.

Now my boyfriend and I knew, when we flashed that fateful Blockbuster card, that this was a low-budget movie; but we had no idea it was so low budget that the director was forced to cast actual southerners.

At any rate. So you've got six ex-Confederate banditos on the run, having recently emptied a bank in a bloody and profitable fashion. Their goal is to make it south of the border, but on the way they stop for the night at an abandoned farmhouse -- a farmhouse which, unlike some stories of this ilk -- has not been arbitrarily, mysteriously abandoned for no good reason whatsoever. Our robbers do not merely stumble across it in a streak of suicidally bad luck. No, the house and property were inherited by a friend and fellow soldier of William's, but this friend died in battle before he could claim the property.

Voila! Instant hide-out. Just add criminals.

Granted, the house has a few genre strikes against it -- but in 1863 our protagonists might not be aware of them yet, so I'm prepared to forgive them. For one thing, the only way to reach the house is through a huge cornfield; and if horror has taught us nothing, it is that corn kills. It's the crop of the damned. Just ask Stephen King, or M. Night Shyamalan. ""Grow soybeans instead,"" that's what they'll tell you.

Another bad sign of impending doom: the house features a cellar door that flat refuses to open. For those of you who may not watch a lot of horror, the ""locked cellar door"" is the mystery equivalent of ""the gun over the mantle."" By the end of that movie, some poor schmuck is going to open that door and go down there alone. Again, though, Dark Birds bucks the trend. Rather than letting the group's lone female skip downstairs in a flimsy nightie, the writers eventually send an intelligent, good-sized, well-armed black man who could shoot a fly off a crap wagon at twenty paces. And no, he doesn't die down there.

In fact, one of the more charming aspects of this film was the way that none of the characters did too much stupid -- ""Hey, what's that out there in the corn? I know it's dark, and it's raining, and there are skinless fanged dog-beasts roaming the rows, but heck, I'm going to go check it out."" This does happen a little bit as a matter of narrative necessity, but it goes down towards the end of the film and with fairly good reason. For once, we've got a horror movie that features southerners behaving like reasonable people -- not as redneck chainsaw fodder or homicidal six-toed inbreds. Will wonders never cease?

I do admit that there were a few loose ends, and that the ending left me a bit confused -- even after I'd thought about it enough to declare that I ""got it."" But overall I really liked this thing. It was genuinely suspenseful for all of its reliance on cliche, and the atmosphere was damn near perfect. The characters relate in a believable fashion, both to each other and to the encroaching threat, and the special effects were surprisingly good and sparingly used. I'm not easily impressed by indie horror, and I'm not afraid to make fun of it either -- but this one is worthy of a watch.

Good stuff.",1131494400,13,4266,4.564705882352941
2207607,4,B0007A0F4O,"Deadbirds (Alex Turner, 2004)

Alex Turner makes his feature-length debut with DeadBirds, a surprisingly slick Civil War thriller with an even more surprisingly good cast. Turner, despite having only filmed two shorts previous to this, managed to land some excellent underrated and up-and-coming actors for his ghost story, and much of the movie's strength lies in Turner's ability to let the actors do the talking for him.

Six friends-- five deserters and their leader's girlfriend-- rob a bank, then head out to an abandoned plantation house owned by the father of one's friend before heading off to Mexico with the loot. The party is already divided, and other divisions are lurking just below the surface. The plantation house is, of course, haunted, which doesn't help matters much.

The six are played by Henry Thomas (All the Pretty Horses, E. T., etc.), Nicki Aycox (Crime and Punishment in Suburbia, Over There, etc.), Isaiah Washington (Welcome to Collinwood, Grey's Anatomy, etc.), Michael Shannon (8 Mile, The Woodsman, etc.), Patrick Fugit (Saved!, White Oleander, etc.), and Mark Boone, Jr. (Batman Begins, Memento, etc.). Are you intrigued yet? You should be. You could put these six in a room, let them improvise, and come up with a decent movie (unless you got Uwe Boll to direct it). Simon Barrett (Frankenfish)'s script is nicely understated, though both he and Turner are overly guilty in the film's last half of ""let the audience see the monster way too much."" Still, the monsters here are less important than the interactions between the characters, and by the time you get around to seeing the monsters too much, it's bearable.

A solid film, well worth seeing if you're a fan of haunted house tales. *** ",1131408000,,1729,5.031468531468532
2207608,3,B0007A0F4O,"It's not a bad film, but the story isn't new at all. ""Dead Birds"" is a reduplication and not the best one.

Being a period horror film is a plus point for Dead Birds because is not common these days to some directors to set their movie is period times. The civil war it self is more enough to be scary and that are benefit for Alex Turner, the director, to spine some chills in this feature.

I'm glad recently independent horror movies have tendency to shows a strong performance, when the bib-budget flick that somehow lose the spirit of the horror it self.

Using just the right mix of suspense, atmosphere, and gore, this movie satisfied my horror palate like the taste of smooth marrow.

The movie starts when a group of confederate troublemakers decide to rob a bank and head to Mexico.  William (Henry Thomas), Sam (Patrick Fugit), Clyde (Michael Shannon), Joseph (Mark Boone Junior), and Todd (Isaiah Washington) are joined at the bank by Annabelle (Nicki Aycox), and in taking the gold, turn the bank into a bloodbath.  They ride quickly out of town, heading for an old house they believe to be in the surrounding area.  They come across an old man robbing dead deserters who tells them there is no house and no creek close by.

They find the creek and house anyway, surrounded by a dead and foreboding cornfield with no path leading through it to the manor.  The outlaws decide to spend the night before heading to Mexico in the morning.  During the night, a storm rages both outside, and inside, the old plantation home.  Things do more than go bump in the night here; they get up and invade your mind.

Everyone in the group begins to have bizarre visions, each having to do with the manor's previous residents.  Something happened to the family that lived here, and before long the renegades realize that a door has been opened that cannot be closed.  One by one they will fall victim to the manor, but just how much they are effected will not be revealed until the end.

From isolated woods to a spooky, abandoned plantation house and through withered corn field that even my wraith wouldn't walk through, the atmosphere was superbly captured and used to its best advantage in this film.

The costumes, props, and sets were superb, capturing the civil war period with chilling meticulousness.  The special effects, while not spectacular, were very effective and used in the best possible lighting.  Some of the facial effects were rather ""Grudge-Like"" (I movie I didn't like), but with use of shadow were presented much better than in The Grudge.  Also to note, that white thing that falls out of the corn field reminded me just the tiniest bit of the creatures from Lurking Fear, a classic IMHO.

Dead Birds has a strong script, great acting, and a director (Alex Turner) who cared enough about his work to bring this B movie up to an A rating.

There is a constant sense of forboding and you're never really quite sure just what is coming off - which I like. However, even though I like that - it is still necessary to fill in the blanks in a good horror mystery in order to leave the viewer satisfied. Dead Birds doesn't quite do that - almost but not quite.

Set in the time of the Civil War, a small group of thieves robs a Confederate money deposit from the bank where it is to be maintained. They take the gold they've stolen to a home they've been told will be safe haven. One of their group was told of the home by a fellow inmate in jail. As they travel there, the men and woman meet several very creepy and odd characters who make some sense in their being there.

The house turns out to be a true house of horrors. Ghosts abound and murder is on these ghosts' minds.

Where the story fails to deliver is in tying up the loose ends of why the ghosts are there to begin with. We know something horrible happened, but we don't know WHY - not really.

The ghosts are quite scary and yet just a bit too slick to fit in with the Civil War era setting.

The spooks look not too unlike the ones in The Grudge (a scary film in its own right) and I had the distinct impression I was seeing bits of not only The Grudge, but Blair Witch... and a few other horror films.

Why are some of the band distrustful of the others, but not all? That is not really explained. Apparently even Civil War era folks were stupid enough to wander off into empty rooms or out of the house when presented with some sort of a deadly predicament. (So it didn't start in the 1970's with ""Halloween""...).

If it sounds like I'm complaining a lot - yes, I guess I am - but that's because this film is leaps and bounds superior than most films of its genre. But it should be better. It should have tied up those loose ends a bit better, because the overall presentation is just plain superior to most other of its nature.

Watch it! You'll enjoy it.",1119830400,3,2112,4.146699266503667
2207630,5,B0007A0F4O,"I originally saw a preview for 'Dead Birds' a month or two before its release and thought it looked like an interesting concept.  I've always wondered why there aren't many horror flicks set during the Civil War.  It seems like such a great time period and setting for scary movies.

I rented it on its release date(then purchased it a few days later)and was not disappointed at all.  'Dead Birds' is one of the flat-out best horror flicks I've ever seen.  The plot revolves around some Confederate army deserters who rob a bank and then hide out in a deserted plantation house surrounded by a cornfield.  Obviously, as the group soon discovers, there's is something really wrong with this house.  The film is well acted, beautifully shot and edited.  It is filled many genuine scares and some seriously creepy visuals.

There is alot going on in this movie but the makers of the film do something that not alot of filmmakers do:  they don't hold your hand.  They don't explain every little thing to you.  It seems that just about the only horror films that do this are from Asia.  Most US horror flicks('Scream', 'I Know What You Did Last Summer')not only over-explain everything but suck too.  Here in 'Dead Birds' there are flashbacks and things that aren't completely explained.  I love the fact that the makers didn't feel the need to dumb down the film.  You actually have to think a little bit and come to some of your own conclusions.  Its nice to see that some filmmakers in the US are finally starting to do this.  Its also refreshing to actually have to think about a movie sometimes.

Another amazing thing is that low budget films are rarely period pieces.  But 'Dead Birds' is set during the Civil War and you never get the feeling that its not the 1870s.  Thats quite an accomplishment for a lower cost film.  And even though a good bit of the film's budget, which was around $5 million, must have been sunk into period dress and sets, it seems that nothing else was skimped on.  There are actors here you will recognize, the small amount of CGI is great...basically everything is so well done that you would think this was a $30 million dollar Hollywood production.

All in all, 'Dead Birds' is about the best horror film I've seen in years and definitely one of the best films of this year.  Its scary, intelligent, well conceived, and beautifully executed.  All I can do is thank the filmmakers for such a great movie and urge everyone else to see it.

Also, a little Did-You-Know about the film:  the filmmaker's got to use some of the set-pieces(the in-town and bank sets)from the just-wrapped film 'Big Fish'.  I'm sure this is another way that a film with such a low budget has such good production values.",1119139200,6,2728,4.613305613305613
2207631,3,B0007A0F4O,"There are far less period horror films like ""Dead Birds"" than there are futuristic ones, although the latter are often nothing more ambitious than putting Jason or Pinhead in space.  This direct to video film is set in the south in 1863, the summer that the Confederacy would suffer a pair of pivotal defeats at Gettysburg and Vicksburg.  A gang of deserters shows up in a small town and rob the bank, creating a minor bloodbath in the process.  Needing to lay low before they head for Mexico, the group heads for the Holllister place that William (Henry Thomas) heard about once upon a time in a field hospital.  However, the locals know nothing about such a place and when they find it there is no path leading to the house.  Even more unsettling, they are attacked in the cornfield around the house by a creature that looks like a skinned boar.  But we knew going to this house was a bad idea because the omnipresent eerie music makes that clear.

As you would expect with a group of good for nothings like this bunch, they cannot really trust each other with all that gold they have stolen.  But the house proves to be much more of a threat and as the characters are isolated from each other they start seeing and hearing things.  The Civil War setting ends up being a minor part of the story, with the bank robbery mattering more because it makes it clear these are not good people. The idea that the worst thing that can happen to them is that they do not get out, rather than the idea that they are not going to get out alive, appeals to me.  Having to fight with both each other and the supernatural element works well too, because we avoid some of the attempt to band together that plagues a lot of such films

The Achilles heel for ""Dead Birds"" is the music by Peter Lopez, not in the sense that there is anything wrong with the music, which is instantly recognizable as eerie horror movie music, but because director Alex Turner over uses it.  Too many times there is not a chance for the actors to carry the scene because the music is already there, relentlessly totting that weary load instead of being used to accent the horror.  It got to the point that when I heard the music I was not wondering what was about to happen, instead I was bemoaning the fact the music was back again.  Rolling your eyes during a horror film is only going to make you miss things and in the end I round down on this one because of the heavy handed use of the music.

I was wondering if ""Dead Birds"" was a remake of a Japanese horror film, not just because there are a lot of those out there now a days, but also because it feels more like a Japanese horror movie and the deleted scenes are available with Japanese subtitles.  But it turns out Simon Barrett's script is indeed an original story.  Still, despite the ""Evil Dead"" sort of setting, ""Dead Birds"" has a decidedly Japanese sensibility as a horror film, which means if you are looking for lots of blood and guts on screen as characters start dropping like flies, you are going to be disappointed on both scores.  The flashbacks were pretty good in terms of filling us in on what is happening to these future flayed corpses and emphasizes how this is much more of a psychological horror film than an attempt to turns your stomach by more direct visual means.

This movie, shot by Steve Yedlin, looks pretty good.  Obviously we are talking shoestring budget, but the production was able to shoot the opening on sets left over from ""Big Fish.""  As you would expect, the budget problems are really only noticeable when you get to the special effects, especially the early ones in the film.  The cast is pretty good for this type of film, with Patrick Fugit from ""Almost Famous,"" Nicki Aycox from ""Jeepers Creepers 2,"" Michael Shannon from ""The Woodsman,"" Mark Boone Junior from ""Memento,"" Muse Watson from ""I (Still) Know What You Did Last Summer,"" and the best of the bunch, Isaiah Washington from ""Ghost Ship,"" to go along with Thomas, who made some movie when he was a kid.  The bottom line is that this horror film is okay and has some interesting ideas running around in it, so that it is not painfully predictable.  It certainly would be nice if there were more period horror films set in America, so that we do not simply return to the European costumed horror films that were the staples of Hammer and AI when I was a lad.",1119052800,,4379,4.438202247191011
2207632,5,B0007A0F4O,"The black heart of horror no longer beats in Hollywood, as none of the major players even try to come up with original, let alone good, horror films these days.  All is not lost, however, as indie filmmakers have risen up to carry the dark banner.  Do not look askance at all of today's low-budget, direct-to-video horror offerings, for only here can you find new horror films of substance and genuine creepiness.  You would do well to start right here with Dead Birds, as director Alex Turner has given us one gem of a horror movie.

Things start off with a bang - well, several bangs, really - as a group of no-good outlaws rob an Alabama bank in 1863.  These guys are free and easy with their trigger fingers and knives, leaving a real mess of blood and gore in their wake.  It's bad enough that they slaughter innocent civilians, but they go too far when they also kill a group of Rebel soldiers trying to deposit two bags of Confederate gold.  Thus it was established that, whatever happened to them, these guys would get no sympathy from me.  I was actually a tad concerned about the gore in this early scene, though - it was effective but a tad gratuitous (does a head really explode in such a complete manner from one well-placed shot?), and I worried that the filmmaker was trying a little too hard to play up to us gorehounds.  Such concerns quickly fell by the wayside, as the rest of the film is masterfully done.

The gang (which includes a woman as well as a black man) rides off in search of a certain plantation house the leader learned about from a fellow wounded soldier, planning to bed there overnight before heading off to Mexico with their new riches.  Personally, I would have taken one look at that deserted plantation house and kept on riding, but the gang moves on in for the night.  They find respite from an approaching thunderstorm, but there will be no rest for the weary tonight.  It's pretty easy to see that this house just isn't right; heck, some unclassifiable beast runs out of the cornstalks at them before they even get close to the front door.  One by one, these hardened outlaws are given glimpses of the dark history of the place - it starts out with the usual kind of stuff (e.g., giggles, voices, creaks, etc.) but the cinematography makes it work like gangbusters.  Eventually, ghostly images appear and, more often that not, morph into frightening demonic creatures.  The CGI is rather Grudge-ish, yet it is very effective.  Of course, the key to good horror is not the ghostly manifestations, it is the atmosphere and level of suspense that precede and accompany them - and this is where Dead Birds truly excels.  If you're like me and watching this movie alone, odds are you will find yourself advising the characters on screen not to do this or to stay away from that or to simply run like the dickens (or words to that effect) on more than one occasion.  The characters, I can assure you, will not heed your advice, even as things get spookier and more dangerous as the night wears on.

Some of the movie descriptions that I saw led me to believe the characters all turn on one another - this is misleading.  Naturally, any group of outlaws hovering over two big bags of gold are going to be suspicious of one another (and there is also a touch of racial distrust for the black man thrown into the mix), but you won't see these characters act on their suspicions and become the agents of their own destruction.  The threat here is external and very, very real.

Aside from a somewhat shaky start, the actors really grow into their respective roles, and that makes the horrors all the more effective.  You may recognize Henry Thomas, the fellow playing the leader of the gang - I knew he looked familiar, but I didn't recognize him as young Elliott from E.T. until I discovered that piece of information in another review.  The female character, Nicki Aycox, looks a lot like Lisa Marie Presley, but that's neither here nor there.  I must admit, though, that the film's title, while catchy, is a bit of a puzzler, as only one oblique reference is made to dead birds during the film.

Is the movie scary?  Not necessarily.  It is, however, thoroughly creepy, and I much prefer a creepy movie over a scary one.  A good scare can be exhilarating, but it's over and done with in a hurry.  Creepiness, in contrast, works its way into your bones, where it is distilled into something that stays with you long after the original source of the creep factor is gone.  That, if you ask me, is what horror is really all about - and, I am glad to say, that is also what Dead Birds is all about.  That is exactly why I love this movie.",1118102400,94,4670,4.495260663507109

2207634,2,B0007A0F4O,"This flick never got any theatrical release here in Oz. I only found out about it through the Blockbuster website when I was looking at what movies where going to be released on DVD soon. The only one that caught my eye was ""Dead Birds"". I like horror movies and the cover got my attention, so I checked the reviews here on Amazon to see what had been said about it. So many reviews said it was the best horror movie in ages, so I couldn't wait for it to be released here.

Well, I've watched it, and I don't know what the reviews here are on about? A few said the movie is actually scary, I never got scared once? And a few said the movie didn't depend on boring you to death with long periods of silence and then a sudden loud booming sound that I consider a cheap scare that is unoriginal, and bores me every time, 'cause I know it's about to happen. However this movie DID use those elements in a way, it's just instead of it being a loud boom and nothings there, there is something there, and the sound-effect is not a boom it's a baam.

The ghosts I thought looked unoriginal. The plot had so many holes in it. Now I'm just wondering what anything had to do with anything. There a bunch of bank robbers in the old west days and they succeed in stealing the money, a kid gets shot for no reason except for the guy to mention it later on in bed to his girlfriend... but it just went no where. There where flashbacks to what had happened in the house but it didn't explain why things where still happening... there was an invisible killer killing the ghosts that tied into jack $#!%, and you never see what, or a reason to why, anything happened the way it did.

The ending was weird and made little sense. I don't scare easily, but I do enjoy watching a good horror flick, but this in my book is not one of them. I don't know what the hype about it was, it's not scary, it doesn't make sense, and not much ties in together the way it had potential to. I dunno, maybe deleted scenes showed some of the things I wondered about, but I never bothered to look at them.

I should have known the movie was not going to be any good from a review printed on the front cover of the DVD that said something about it being the best horror movie since Cabin Fever. Now that was a $#!% movie there.

2207635,4,B0007A0F4O,"With all the hoopla made over the effectiveness of this straight-to-video release, a lot was at stakes.  But rest assured, DEAD BIRDS is in fine feather indeed.  This haunted house let's-hide-over-there-overnight western is atmospheric cinema at its best.  The dread that hangs over the film outlaws is heavier than any stolen bag of coins.  First time director Alex Turner impressively succeeds in establishing this without losing any of the movie's rhythm, which deservedly spins out of control into the last half-hour.  All the actors, including E.T.'s Henry Thomas are a joy to watch, as are the visual effects.  The people behind Almost Human Inc. really went all the way to make original scary creatures, and the end-result is staggering for a small-budgeted film.  The only downside to DEAD BIRDS would be the lack of character development which makes who is who unclear.  But when a horror movie this caliber invades our rental stores, all is easily forgiven.  It can proudly give fellow straight-to-video cheapies the bird while enjoying its long run at the checkout stand.-----Martin Boucher",1116201600,2,1101,5.2102272727272725
2207636,4,B0007A0F4O,"Bought this as a previously-viewed bargain purchase and found it enjoyable. The costuming and location work were superb and the sound effects excellent (the sound of the old .44 Army Colts being cocked is dead-on). The unfolding plot is chillingly rendered and the use of flashbacks to fill in the backstory is effective. The acting is uniformly top-notch, as is the FX makeup work. The production company even gives a tip of the hat to the great H.P. Lovecraft and his Cthulu mythology in the ""bringing through from the other side"" of the demonic , and the transmutation of the protagonists into...""something else"".
When you watch a flick like this, you DO have to suspend a bit of disbelief, as story devices (aka ""artistic license"") that aren't exactly reality-based always tend to creep in. Some of these one can just ignore, but others can become irritating. For city kids the cornfield looks ""cool"". Unfortunately, if you have actually grown up in a rural environment the sight of it evokes chuckles. It is meticulously aligned, the stalks standing row upon row in neat order. And supposedly it has been so for years. Hardly. Such places overgrow rapidly, and in reality this old field would be overgrown with weeds, briars, and new growth saplings. It would hardly be pristine, with only the withered standing stalks remaining.
  And another thing, check any ""ghost site' on the net and you'll quickly discover that any old house  with a ""reputation"" MAINTAINS that reputation throughout the community, down through time (as in 112 Ocean Avenue, Amityville, Long Island). Even if only garrisoned temporarily in the area, the confederate platoon visiting the site at the movie's end would have been WARNED about it by the locals. The total lack of knowledge exhibited by the soldiers who go to enter the cornfield at the end just doesn't jibe with reality. Of course neither do the reactions of anyone who shoots one of these ""critters"". To look at it, and say ""God that thing is UGLY. Wonder what it is,"" and then go ON is preposterous. Real people would be out of there so fast the wind would pull a vacuum behind them.
  Biggest irritant, though, is in the lighting. Someone lit this household interior with low-level sepia-toned lights to throw ominous shadows on the walls and actors, and to maintain an overall weirdness to the walls and ceilings. This works to a point. If this had been a STILL photo shoot it would have been GREAT...cool as could be... but this was a MOVING picture, and when people walk off with lanterns the room they exit should not remain lit. The light nimbus  should move with the actors and the darkness close in behind them. Not here, and the brain picks this inconsistency up and says ""Whoa. No way"" when watching ""DB"". When people walk around with lanterns in this flick they almost DON'T NEED THEM, because the interior stays perpetually lit by ""something"". In some scenes the lantern light barely registers against the wall lighting.

  And the lanterns themselves scream ""fake"" at you and distract and irritate you throughout the movie because they don't function like real oil lanterns. For city kids, you may not have caught this. For anyone who has ever lived through power outages and had to use oil lamps, you know exactly what I am talking about. Real oil lamps glow warmly (and photograph the same)and their light flickers and wavers with movement (the nature of the burning wick and stirring air). THESE lanterns cast a bright, cold, intense glare that NEVER wavers, NEVER flickers. Tells you they are fakes...constructions that use roughed glass (or Lexan)
for distortion, with spray-painted ""smoking"" on the corners, a bulb on the inside, and a battery system in the lantern base. There are even scenes when the ""lanterns"" are shown fairly close up and the curve of the bulb is visible.  For me, this was an ongoing irritant and distracted from the flow of the movie.

  Such carping aside, though, ""Dead Birds"" is a pretty clever take on this genre and well worth renting and watching.

2207659,5,B0007A0F4O,"Where did one of the best horror films of 2004 come from?  NOT Hollywood.  Surprised?  Didn't think so.  Yes, Alex Turner's DEAD BIRDS is an indie film, and as any true horror fan knows, independent film production has been the lifeblood of the genre ever since the Golden Age of Hollywood horror ended in the late 1940s (or early 1950s, depending on who you ask).  Many of the bellwether films of the genre during the last 50 years or so--flicks like NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, HALLOWEEN, THE EVIL DEAD, and RE-ANIMATOR, to name just a few--are non-Hollywood films that were independently produced.  So don't let its low-budget, direct-to-video, non-studio-production status veer you away from this film.

The plot of DEAD BIRDS revolves around a gang of Confederate deserters who steal a cache of their own army's gold.  After the bloody heist, the troop plans to lie low until the heat is off, so they take refuge in an old secluded, abandoned plantation house.  And that's when the real fun begins.  Creepy things take place at the hideout--personal hauntings, spirit possessions, attacks by surreal-looking creatures, and the like--though subtly at first.  But when the preternatural cork ultimately pops, the horror elements build to a maddening crescendo.  And although the closing act ushers the viewer back to the safe, quiet daylight, the film delivers a subtle but eerie finale that makes even  gooseflesh crawl.

The film features some first-rate actors who expertly handle the spooky material.  Former child-star Henry Thomas--probably best known for his role as Elliott, the best earthly friend of E.T. THE EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL (1982)--portrays the leader of the gang of thieves, and beautiful young actress Nicki Lynn Aycox, no newcomer to the genre--she appeared in 2003's JEEPERS CREEPERS II, as well as in genre-related TV shows like CSI: CRIME SCENE INVESTIGATION and the ill-fated 2002-2003 revival of THE TWILIGHT ZONE--plays his tough-but-feminine love interest.  Rounding out the primary cast are young, talented actors Michael Shannon and Patrick Fugit, and the versatile and multitalented veteran actor Isaiah Washington.

First-time feature director Alex Turner handles the haunted-house clichs with great flair and reworks them into something that seems new and exciting.  And it should be obvious to hard-core genre fans that his subtle terror tactics and eerie special FX hearken more to contemporary Japanese horror than to American or British genre tradition, which serves to heighten the horror and the sense of the unexpected, at least for Western audiences.

Brilliant camera work and superb sound design also contribute to making this a truly frightening flick.  Indeed, the ambiance of DEAD BIRDS is as much a star of the film as are the actors.  Said atmosphere is thick enough to cut with a knife, leaving no doubt that something is very wrong at the plantation hideaway.  And the filmmakers see to it that the audience experiences every eerie aspect of the place.

Unfortunately, the film played theatrically at only a handful of horror cons and film festivals.  But the DVD release from Columbia-Tristar is a gem that should help to bring DEAD BIRDS its deserved following.  The digital transfer is crisp and rich, offering the film in anamorphic widescreen at the intended aspect ratio of 1.85:1.  Also offered is an entertaining and informative feature commentary with the director and cast, as well as a making-of featurette and some deleted scenes.

DEAD BIRDS is a must-see for anyone who enjoys a good scare flick, and true genre fans will definitely want to add the DVD to their collections.",1114041600,5,3634,5.167521367521368
2207660,5,B0007A0F4O,"I think this movie defines what horror is all about, the actors look like characters, the gore comes unexpected like it should, there are scenes that make you fall alsleep, but that's why even the greatest horror films have slow moving scenes so you  are more emmersed in the movie and wondering, what the hell just happened when the scarey parts happen. The whole movie plays itself out like an old redition off an old western classic, I mean everything is excellent, even the dialogue is great, lengendary, I mean I assumed this was some old western story, but seeing it was a modern day script I'm impressed. There are a lot of great moments, but what is the most pivotal scene is the confrontation between Michael Shannon and Isaiah Washington that's halted by Henry Thomas this to me is a pivotal moment for me in this movie because this one scene is where the characters stand out the most, especially henry thomas, in the beginning, yeah you could tell it was him getting of the horse and looking back at the kid he accidently shot, but after this one scene, I was looking at someone else, I was not looking at henry thomas anymore, henry thomas was a shadow like the darkness that first come upon the house when he struck the first match. This moment for me really displays the actors as different people. Michael Shannon, seemed immovable in his costume, he seemed like he was born in the screen play, no mindless critic could even so much as nick him he was so perfect, no one would play his role better. NO ONE!!! Henry Thomas seemed possessed by his character role there were those times when I was seeing and hearing Henry Thomas, but there were other scenes where was looking at another person at William, he also seemed immovable in his costume as well, Isaiah Washington acted like he just been back from that time period, almost more upbeat from the same uncle tom kind of talk more independent as if the accent was going in it's own direction, his redition of a blackman in that period during the civil war seemed more realer than any other african american actor I have seen playing that kind role. He should get an accademy award for best african american actor in american film. Nicki was okay, there were a couple of scenes where she seemed like she was overplaying the part just a bit, otherwise she was excellent as well. The double take with her hiding behind the bonnet was excellent, the way those two looks converged in two different scenarios was great. No nudity in this picture, why because this isn't Freddy vs Jason, or any of the other overbudgeted mindless movies that lacks the real intent to scare the audience. I think this is the kind of production that should do more horror movies. Horror and gore go together, but when one is over emphasized you lose some of that scariness. Even David Cronenberg style of directing never fails to suprise me and he uses lots of gore as well. Gore is a good tool to use, but don't leave out the old fashion scare tactics. We don't want to see good looking actors in make up, we want to see shadows on walls, hiddeious images that seem unforgotten to our minds, timeless. Even House Of Usher, as sleepy as it was could even be on par with Freddy Vs Jason. Sure all the actors look good in make-up, and it get's worn off. But Vincent Price compared to some ""hottie"" teen model swearing profusely can still spring more tears from his eyes, without the use of a single swear word. Swear words don't bring tears folks, A C T I N G, does. F & J make the actor's pay.

Lets get something out of the way. Yup, basic horror movie plot. Things jumping, stupid people doing stupid things. Hey, its a B horror movie, what are you going to expect. Although the acting is actually quite good for something that wasn't made by a big studio. Theres moments of gore that can be pretty intense if you don't like blood and guts. Although some of it reminded me of Kill Bill with its suddenly squirting tendencies. But there are really only a few moments of this over the top gore. But when its there it lets itself be noticed.

Now for what you might not expect. Its actually a period piece, set back in the days of horses and saloons. Not really sure WHAT time period its supposed to be, i think around Civil War days maybe. But you soon forget anyway.

Basic plot is a gang robs a bank, then goes to hide out in an abandoned house. Of course the house has a past and a few ghosts still lingering in the shadows. But ghosts of what exactly? I recognised the house, i KNOW i did. Maybe in Texas Chainsaw Massacre? Gah! An interesting dynamic began to happen in my brain. Did i want these people to escape this situation, or was i just wanting to see them get whats coming to them?

Second, the monsters are fracking FREAKY! The first time i saw them change into the distorted faces, GOD it freaked me out! You actually see one in the cornfield at the begining. Its like half decayed...dang i don't know but it did its job of giving me the skeevies!

The plot is loose and there really is only some vague mentions to what is going on. But theres enough if you use your brain you can piece together whats going on and why. ###Youre left without much of a sense of closure, but it sets up an interesting twist that people can debate on message boards for a good long time.###

Basically this is just a have fun movie. Get scared, think about those nasty faces when you try to go to bed that night movie. Gotta say i opened my eyes a few times to make sure there weren't any freaky contorted ghosts peering at me from beside my bed.",1112832000,3,2084,4.290076335877862

Lets get something out of the way. Yup, basic horror movie plot. Things jumping, stupid people doing stupid things. Hey, its a B horror movie, what are you going to expect. Although the acting is actually quite good for something that wasn't made by a big studio. Theres moments of gore that can be pretty intense if you don't like blood and guts. Although some of it reminded me of Kill Bill with its suddenly squirting tendencies. But there are really only a few moments of this over the top gore. But when its there it lets itself be noticed.

Yep, all the highly positive reviews here aren't an aberration. As horror movies go, this is the real deal. Yes, it's far from perfect. But with horror movies all that matters is...does it deliver with the scares, and yes it does indeed. A sign that Dead Birds is working, is that despite seeing a 'scare moment' coming far in advance, you STILL jump when it comes anyway. As with any horror movie, but this movie especially, when you watch this for the first time i advise watching this at night with all the lights off and the volume loud for the full effect.

2207672,4,B0007A0F4O,"This movie was first brought to my attention by an article in Fangoria magazine.  The article focused on the sfx in Dead Birds as apparently they're not that expensive.  They are, however, quite good.

Dead Birds is quite possibly one of the best Direct-to-Video Horror movies I've ever seen.  What starts out as an extremely gory heist/period piece quickly evolves into an eerie chiller with an oppressive sense of dread.  I typically watch all Horror movies in the dark (being that is most likely their intended viewing conditions) but at several points in this movie I was so creeped out that I turned on the lights.  That is some pretty high praise!

There are some scenes that could have used more cohesive editing, but overall this movie is great.  The cast, especially Henry Thomas and Isaiah Washington, are way above average for this type of movie.

Dead Birds has it all, Lovecraftian undertones, an unyielding sense of unease, gore, story, and actual scares.  Even the ending is excellent.  So if you like being scared and can stomach some gory nastiness seek this movie out.  A worthwhile addition to any Horror collection.",1111536000,2,1135,4.884816753926701

This is a great horror movie from start to finish. It is a captivating and chilling story of a group of bank robbers who flee to a local and abandoned farm to spend the night during a horrific storm that is brewing. From the second they arrive at the house they are aware of another otherworldly presence and is continued to be haunted by disturbing and shocking images, and gory expierences that truly dig deep beneath the skin and stay there for much longer after the movie is over. Overall this movie is truly shocking with a superb climax that overrides any other that I have seen for a VERY long time.",1111363200,2,851,4.426751592356688
2207674,4,B0007A0F4O,"Well, there's one unique thing going for this film, it's not everyday you find a horror film set during the old west, Civil War era.  This is a neat, little film, really, well-done on a very small budget to be sure.  Henry Thomas (Yes, THAT Henry Thomas of E.T. fame) leads a small band of confederate soldiers who rob a gold shipment, killing several fellow confederate soldiers and townsfolk in the process.  The band of six, including William's (Thomas) girlfriend Annabelle (Nicki Lynn Aycox), head towards an abandoned plantation to hideout.

Soon after arriving, strange things begin to happen in the big, old southern plantation home.  Strange sounds lure the various members away as they all begin to become greedy and over-protectful of the stolen gold.  Each of the members begins to encounter vengeful spectral spirits in the house as one by one they are led to their dooms.

The lone black member, Todd (Isaiah Washington) is able to read a strange book that is found and tells William it's a book of spells for raising the dead.  How HE happens to know this is never explained.  That unfortunately is one of the weak points of the film.  Things are tossed out there but never really explained at the end.  Another example is that William accidently shoots a child while robbing the gold and tells his Annabelle in a moment of remorse.  She however is sleeping and doesn't hear him and the matter is completely forgotten about later.

The plot is threadbare about the previous plantation owners attempts to use black magic by sacrificing slaves to bring his dead wife back to life and accidently releases demons that possess his children.  There's also some nonsense about how the father put the children where they couldn't get away from...up in the barn rafters...which is also never explored with any care.  They are demons and they can't get out of barn rafters????

Luckily there's enough chills to mostly make up for the plot holes.  The film is heavily influenced by recent Japanese Horrors like ""The Ring"" and ""The Grudge"" with the demonic faces of the spectral children and their jerky movements.  The plantation house is a eerie setting that lends to the dismal and unsetting atmosphere of the film.  There's definitely a few jump out of your seat moments.

A good film with some well-done chills and nice atmostphere.  One only wishes the plot had been a little tighter.",1111363200,,2393,4.830466830466831
2207675,5,B0007A0F4O,"This was a cool little flick! Saw it at Alamo drafthouse during SXSW here in Austin.

The story concerns a group of civil war soldiers who rob a shipment of gold and hole up in an abandoned plantation home for the night. The usual ""I want my share!"" mentality takes over but thankfully most of that felt secondary to the twisted, cursed history of the house and the ghosts that begin to appear and wreak havoc on them.

The actors were good and well cast. The FX was outstanding! And the music, while a bit over the top, really made you jump out of your chair, along with some truly graphic, disturbing imagery that really took me back to the good ole days of horror before cheap CGI dominated the screen.

My only complaint would be that you wanted to know a bit more about the characters. They kind of coasted on some stereotypes. But, the film was short enough that you probably won't notice until afterward when you think ""Hmm. How did they know about the gold?""  The answers to those questions were undoubtedly written and filmed, but cut for pacing.

Anyway, check it out!",1111276800,,1078,4.479591836734694
2207676,3,B0007A0F4O,"""Dead Birds"" is a movie I would have really liked to enjoy much more.  It has all the elements that should make a great horror flick: Creepy atmosphere and location, a huge abandoned house, good acting and make-up effects (especially considering what the budget seems to have been), and good sound.

  Unfortunately, the plot never really comes together as much as it should, so the film winds up feeling like a bit of a letdown.

  The movie follows a group of bank robbers in the mid-1800's who have just stolen a large amount of gold.  They are on their way to Mexico, but take shelter in a large abandoned farmhouse over night.  But (of course) the house's past soon comes back to haunt them.

  While ""Dead Birds"" fails to sufficiently answer all of the questions it raises, it IS a creepy movie.  It takes a while to get going, but once it does, it keeps the level of discomfort quite high.

  The film might draw comparisons to movie's like ""The Shining"" and recent Japanese horror films like ""Ringu"" and ""Ju-On: The Grudge"".

  The gore effects are fairly impressive, as are the creature effects, but I just wish the story was able to match the atmosphere.",1111276800,,1164,4.590243902439024
8046493,3,B0007A0F4O,"This oddity stars a lot of before-they-were-stars and aims high with a low budget to deliver a dumb but fun romp full of cheap jump scares. Enjoy.

Alabama, 1863A gang of bank robbers with little trust among them spend the night in an abandoned plantation estate. As soon as they wade through the corn fields to ensure the house is truly vacant, they encounter (and shoot) a strange, eyeless and relatively hairless monster that they pass off as some sort of animal. Shortly thereafter one of their men disappears and another has visions of a horrifying little boy in the house. So, clearly their threat is supernatural and intelligent. Naturally, they say in the house.

The plot sounds overly basicand a lot like Feast (2005) or Tales from the Crypt: Demon Knight (1995)but ends up delivering something more like a haunting than a creature feature. I actually only watched this when I learned it was one of Michael Shannons (The Shape of Water, Bug) early films. Then I noticed more familiar faces.

The cast includes Isaiah Washington (Ghost Ship), Nicki Aycox (Joy Ride 2, Jeepers Creepers II), Patrick Fugit (Gone Girl), Henry Thomas (Geralds Game, Fire in the Sky, Ouija: Origin of Evil) and Mark Boone Junior (30 Days of Night, Halloween II, Vampires).

Despite its low budget, this film is ambitious with its special effects. The opening scene depicts a rather gory bank robbery complete with blowing someones head clean off, and we see our monster up closeboth in the first 15 minutes. The gunshot and slashing wounds are almost entirely CGI (much like The Walking Dead), but at least its all on-screen. I appreciate the effort and feel it looks more than good enough to entertain.

Director (Alex Turner; Red Sands) and writer Simon Barrett (Youre Next, Blair Witch, The Guest) truly succeed on delivering a fun popcorn horror night full of jump scares (although cheap, they're fun if you know what you're getting into) and a variety of special effects. Admittedly, this $1.5 million direct-to-DVD films scares may not compare to the jumpy fun or scare-ticipation of Lights Out (2016), but it does a solid job of mixing things up. I was especially surprised (and pleasantly so, given the low budget) with the scene of the monster emerging from the womans stomachand I was so glad they went with practical effects. Additionally, however hokey, I enjoyed the scarecrow decapitation scene towards the end.

This film has earned a small cult following. You know what? I think its deserving. It aims high and features a broad cast of before-they-were-stars.

One may be annoyed that nothing about the haunting, the monsters or their form are explained. But whatever. Its dumb and fun.",1526428800,,2689,4.922737306843267
