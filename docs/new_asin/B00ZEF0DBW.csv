8719994,3,B00ZEF0DBW,"3 generations of a family have reached hard-won consensus that Esther (Ghita Norby), its matriarch, suffering from a punishing degenerative disease, will take her life at the end of a final family week end.  The story is deeply sensitive, intimate and credible. It is well-acted by an accomplished cast, and all filmmaking elements are cohesive and solid.  Each characters relationship to Esther is moving and honestly defined. As the time nears, and totally credibly, love, loss and fear intensify, resolve wavers, and ambivalence, on the part of 2 characters, comes into play.  A final plan by one feels totally wacky and unlikely, and, for me, derailed an otherwise insightful, penetrating storyline.  So, Im a bit ambivalent in my recommendation, but I still think, overall, its an important film, whose sensitive and controversial subject matter is well-delivered.",1522800000,2,869,5.367647058823529
8719995,5,B00ZEF0DBW,"Superb acting and gripping story. Family dynamics, life and death, character study... All these elements, but not ""in your face""... Subtle but also with great depth. Perfect pace too. Deeply moving and thought-provoking. Highly recommended!",1520467200,,240,5.885714285714286
