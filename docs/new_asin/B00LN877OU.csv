6492918,5,B00LN877OU,"Worth the wait!  It's good that original elements still exist on cartoons of this vintage, and the DVD set makes the most of them!",1412380800,,130,4.416666666666667
6492919,5,B00LN877OU,"6 Pre-code cartoons and 7 that the Hays Office got their hands on (running only 93 minutes). Like volume 3, there is no slipcase.

First up are the wonderful pre-code cartoons.
Stopping the Show (1932) first cartoon in the official ""Betty Boop"" series, Features a cartoon within a cartoon starring Koko The Clown & Bimbo!
Snow White (1933) featuring Cab Calloway! - wonderfully erie cartoon (previously released by A2ZCDS) *Paramount Logos have been restored on this cartoon*
Parade of the Wooden Soldiers (1934) with music by Rubinoff and his Orchestra, (previously released by A2ZCDS)
She Wronged Him Right (1934) introducing Fearless Fred in a melodrama spoof, (previously released by A2ZCDS)
Red Hot Mamma (1934), Betty sings ""Hells Bells"" in this sequel of sorts to ""Snow White"", after she goes into a cave with fire & brimstone.
There's Something About a Soldier (1934) with Fearless Fred, Betty sings ""There's Something About A Soldier"" with the shortest army dress ever. Her underwear shows with every step. The animation was already completed when the Hays Office took control as it looks pre-code.  It was withheld from release while the Color Classic below was rushed into theaters.

And then some that had to be confined by the Hays Office:
Poor Cinderella (1934, in color), A Max Fleischer Color Classic in 2-color Cinecolor. Interesting that Betty Boop is given red hair in this one. (previously released by Echobridge) *Paramount Logos have been restored on this cartoon*.  It is believed that this is the first Betty Boop cartoon in production after the Hays Office Production Code took effect.  The next cartoon was produced earlier but released after.
When My Ship Comes In (1934), Betty's garter belt still shows up on her leg, but her skirt is longer. My guess is that the animation was already completed when the Hays Office took control and the animation cells were quickly modified with a longer black dress. Watch the length of her dress shorten in the every last shot as she tosses the pot of coins in the air.
Zula Hula (1937), musical with Grampy - racial stereotypes abound in this African head-hunter episode. I guess this was O.K. by the moral minority.
Riding the Rails (1938) Oh no, its Pudgy and he is lost in the subway tunnels! Fortunately the animators forgot to draw the third rail.
The Swing School (1938) with Pudgy in one of the few musical Betty Boop cartoons that is dreadful.  Betty should have called Grampy in to brighten up this cartoon.
Pudgy the Watchman (1938), - Oh, another 'Pudgy"" cartoon. Since Pudgy is not good at catching mice, Betty hires an alley cat.  It is hard to believe that these are the same people who did ""Snow White"" five years earlier.
(Introducing) Sally Swing (1938).  - Betty discovers the school room cleaner has swing talent. The musical Hays Office releases are always still fun to watch. Betty's dress seems to have gotten very long!

Some Hays Office cartoons are strangely missing from this final entry and are not in the public domain:
""Whoops! I'm A Cowboy"" (1937)
""Honest Love & True"" (1938) - this one appears to be lost, neither Paramount, UM&M, nor NTA have it in their collections.
""Pudgy The Lost Kitten"" (1938) - this one was not on the Republic laserdisc but it does exist.
""Buzzy Boop"" (1938) - this one was not on the Republic laserdisc, but it does exist.
""Buzzy Boop At The Concert"" (1938) - this one appears to be lost, neither Paramount, UM&M, nor NTA have it in their collections.
""On With The New"" (1938)

Now if we all could convince Olive Films (who just loves to hear from us fans) that Betty Boop also appears in the pre-code TALKARTOONS series we will get an additional 16 cartoons for release!

If we get that, then lets shoot for the SCREEN SONGS that Betty Boop appears in.",1410825600,22,3777,4.804314329738059

6492923,5,B00LN877OU,"I just love Betty Boop and this selection of shorts is great!  It's great to finally have the classics ""Snow-white"" and ""Poor Cinderella"" in superb quality.  I feel like with these four blue-ray releases, I have all the shorts I needed.  I would have been devastated to be missing most of these cartoons.  Thank you Olive Films for releasing these four sets.  There are still some gems that need to be released on blu-ray.",1420588800,,422,4.648648648648648
6492924,3,B00LN877OU,"It's too bad that the last volume in the series has so many weak latter-day Betty cartoons on it, when there are still plenty of choice ones left unreleased. Only 6 are the great pre-code titles fans clamor for, and the last, SALLY SWING, is barely a Betty Boop cartoon, and is dreadful by any measure.
The jewel in the crown here is getting the only vintage Betty Boop cartoon photographed in color, POOR CINDERELLA, in the bunch. It's a real treat to those like myself, who have only seen public domain prints, to get a chance to see it sourced from studio elements. It too is arguably not one of her best, but it has a few laughs, and the novelty of seeing Betty in glorious Cinecolor makes it a must for Boop fans.
So, overall a mixed bag, but still worth it for the desirable titles in the set.",1420416000,4,799,4.298013245033113
6492925,4,B00LN877OU,"Way too many post-code cartoons, but the only thing that was really important to me was that I was finally able to get 'Snow White', perhaps the best cartoon I've ever seen.  Over the past 40 years I've been amazing friends & family w/this cartoon.  Everyone who saw it was impressed, but it a several generations copy on VHS, leaving the quality much to be desired.  Still isn't perfect, but probably the best shape we'll get to see it at this point.",1418083200,2,451,4.475609756097561

6492928,5,B00LN877OU,This rounds out the collection for me.  There are some gems here.  The picture and sound quality is on par with the others.  I doubt we'll see Betty looking better than this.,1415664000,,174,4.375
6492929,4,B00LN877OU,"Was it really necessary to round out the last third of this final disc with shorts that focused more on Pudgy than Betty?  When you consider how many Betty Boop cartoons there are that weren't used for these four volumes from Olive Films (such as BETTY IN BLUNDERLAND), that seems hard to justify.  While it's great to have these shorts on disc, it doesn't seem like the format was really taken advantage of here.  Each volume from Olive runs roughly 90 minutes, give or take a few minutes, so each of these could have included a few more shorts without sacrificing image quality.  Right from the start Olive announced this was only going to be a four-volume series, so fans knew up front we wouldn't be getting the entire run of Betty shorts...although I don't think it was ever stated why.  Probably many here recall Republic Home Video's eight-volume VHS release of BETTY BOOP: THE DEFINITIVE COLLECTION from the 1990s (which was also available on laser disc).  In addition to giving us almost the complete Max Fleischer/Betty Boop library, it also had the onscreen participation of Max's son, director Richard Fleischer (FANTASTIC VOYAGE, Disney's 20,000 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA, TORA! TORA! TORA!).  Although image quality on the Olive releases easily surpass those, it would have been nice to have had additional volumes to make this a more comprehensive collection.  And, like Volume 3, this latest entry drops the cardboard slip sleeve found on Volumes 1 and 2.  Still not sure why, since the initial idea was that the four cardboard sleeves would line up on the shelf to form a picture of Betty.  (Corporate corner cutting, perhaps?)",1412899200,11,1640,4.888086642599278
6492930,1,B00LN877OU,"Volume 1 was flaky, Volume 2 was a slight improvement, but Volume 3 was a complete collapse. To be worth having on Blu Ray would have meant restoring the films, which they did not. They allegedly had access to the master film elements. If so, they must be in terrible shape. Olive Films has been non-responsive to questions. Volumes 1 and 2 had these slip cases that would tie the entire 4 DVDs together into one attractive unit. They stopped the slip cases with Volume 3 and I understand there isn't one on Volume 4 either. This 'effort' by Olive Films is a failure. My worry is that this will only delay a better company actually restoring the Betty Boops and releasing them as a worthy collection.",1412726400,3,700,4.519685039370079
8666782,2,B00LN877OU,"This is a review for all 4 volumes in this collection, now that they're all out. Im slightly annoyed that any public domain cartoons were included, as  (most of) those have been released time and time again, and why waist precious space on this dvd that would be better served with older, pre-Hays code appearances of Betty Boop? Unless of course you're doing a complete collection. I believe that this shouldve either been exclusively copyrighted cartoons, or a complete collection. Poor Cinderella is probably the public domain Betty Boop cartoon that is included on every bargain bin dvd set, and while its nice to see it restored, I was mostly looking forward to the other cartoons that hadnt ever been released on dvd, including her Talkartoon appearances as an anthropomorphic dog. And yes, plenty of those were included, but not all, which begs the question once again why waste space on PD cartoons over the unreleased CR toons?

Why oh why cant Betty Boop get the same treatment as Popeye, Casper, or Superman? All of those characters had their entire cartoon series released on DVD, and in chronological order. Betty Boop deserves the same respect. But seeing as its now 2018 and no other effort has been made to restore these cartoons, it seems as though we may have to settle for these four volume sets from Olive Films.",1531267200,,1332,4.812227074235808

8666786,4,B00LN877OU,"The Cinecolor print of ""Poor Cinderella"" was amazing. Brighter colors than I have seen on any other version, and the ""two-color"" process gives it a surreal quality. The 3-D background models also really stand out. As a collector, I still wish Olive films had arranged these discs differently, and had been more comprehensive in what they included, but getting this one simply for ""Poor Cinderella"" was well worth it.",1481500800,,416,5.043478260869565
8666787,4,B00LN877OU,"As with Volume 3 (see my review for it), this one could also use more of those racy pre-Code Betty Boop cartoons and Talkartoon shorts. On the bright side, Snow White (1933) and Poor Cinderella (1934), both highly-acclaimed classics, are on this release with restored Paramount logos! As the only Betty Boop cartoon made in color, as well as Max Fleischer's first color cartoon (albeit done in the inexpensive Cinecolor process), Poor Cinderella looks STUNNING on Blu-Ray in HD! It kills all the other public domain copies out there! Olive Films, if you're listening, next thing on your list should be the 1941 Fleischer animated feature Mr. Bug Goes To Town, as well as the rest of the Talkartoons, pre-Code Betty Boops, and Screen Songs!",1451174400,2,739,4.92
8666788,5,B00LN877OU,"The best quality Betty Boop.

""Snow White"" is worth buying the disk by itself. This features a young Cab Calloway singing ""Saint James Infirmary"". His siren-like bending of notes is unique to the ""hi-de-ho"" man. When he sings ""Seeeeeeeeee my baby laid out on a long white table..."", it still moves me like it did the first time I heard it 40 years ago.

Also included, ""Red Hot Mama"" which was considered too risque to be broadcast on TV.  ""Stopping the Show"" is longer than the version included in earlier VHS releases. ""Poor Cinderella"" is the only attempt by the Fleischer brothers to make a color BB cartoon.

The whole ""Essential Collection"" series disks include early and later cartoons on each disk. I assume this is marketing so that each disk will have at least one ""gem"" mixed in with the later-not-so-interesting BB cartoons.

I am hoping that Olive Films will continue to transfer Betty Boop to Blu-ray!",1441756800,3,915,4.765822784810126
