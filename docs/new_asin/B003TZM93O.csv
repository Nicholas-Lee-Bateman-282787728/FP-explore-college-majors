8405558,5,B003TZM93O,"I for one give a 5 star rating to ALL of the movies issued by Classic Video Streams. These are watchable, but have not seen any ""restoration""  in the accepted sense of the word. "" Everyone would like to see all releases ""restored"" but from  a financial perspective this is not possible. Those who do restore this material often do it as a ""labor of love"" as this is a niche market. As a long time collector, and fan of this material, companies like Classic Video Streams serve this unique niche market in the best way, as their catalogs are large, so the private collector can build a decent size collection provided that the collector does not opt only for the restored releases. If they do this it is their choice but they are limiting their choices.",1358553600,,752,4.481751824817518
