5111710,5,B007VXT9SS,"This is a highly combustible father and son relationship exploration about a belligerent, grandiose thinking and angry father, Jonathan Flynn (an excellent Robert De Niro) who was never there for his child; his neglected son Nick (Paul Dano) who vacillates between trying to care about him now and totally giving up on him.  The story is based in truth and richly adapted from Nick Flynn's own Memoir, ""Another Bulls**t Night in Suck City"".  Poignantly directed by Paul Weitz, the film also gives a disturbingly atmospheric account of the homeless in America during the winter months seen through the microcosm that is Boston, an apprehensive opportunity to view this excruciatingly real part of life on the streets.

Nick has been raised by his young mother, Jody (Julianne Moore), who committed suicide when he was 22 years old.  Any scenes with Jody are seen while Nick is returning back to his memories of her.  His father had left the family much earlier and was divorced by Jody.  Nick grew up never knowing his father much at all, but for a stockpile of over one hundred letters which have kept him informed to no clear conclusion about Jonathan's life.  All he knew of his father was scribbled on some pages and saved in a box by a lonely young boy.

Jonathan was a cab driver and lost his job again. He also is sarcastic, caustic, volatile, racially bigotted, alcohol-dependent, and, arguably, at many times, a quite delusional man (I could go on without pause). He also is a self-proclaimed, ""truly great writer, storyteller, and poet"". Marked throughout by unending problematic behavior, he becomes physically abusive towards his downstairs neighbors causing his landlord to evict him.  He is now homeless. He constantly shouts his self-aggrandizing statements repeatedly; ""I am one of the 'three' great American writers"" (including himself with J.D. Salinger and also Mark Twain), ""life is gathering material"", and ""soon I shall be known"" as he speaks over and over of the masterpiece he is constantly writing.

 While aspiring to ironically become a writer himself in a semi parallelled theme, Nick takes a job at Harbor Street Inn homeless shelter. During this time a relationship is beginning to build with his co-worker, Denise (Olivia Thirlby) to try and gain some real security in his life while battling all of his inner demons. Just as things are beginning to become a bit comfortable for Nick, his father steps up to the window at the shelter and orders a room as if it were a hotel he will be residing in.  Totally shocked to see him, Nick has an overtly difficult time coping with the fact that his always absentee father is right in front of him and will be staying at his place of work disrupting the whole system there including Nick himself. Nicholas begins to lose all control... But will he regain it?

While working at the shelter a spotlight is shone to realize so much of what goes on with the plight of the homeless population. During the winter's coldest nights, the workers must go out and search the streets for the literally freezing and hungry people who need their help which Nick offers often. At one point, after Jonathan had been thrown out of the shelter due to his behavior once again, Nick finds him freezing in the cold night's weather. He brings him to his own apartment and hopefully now the two can look into Nick's life altering situations in-depth. The major painful issue on the table is his mother's suicide. The movie is really all about Nick's journey through his sad lifetime of just trying to survive without a present father, and now, without his mother also. He must learn to carry on in life with the inclusion of Jonathan again, whose manner is virtually impossible to understand or navigate through. It will be overwhelming for Nick, for sure.

De Niro and Dano make the complex performances of Jonathan and Nick in this dual character study of ""Being Flynn"" so independent of each other. The cinematography (Declan Quinn) paints a portrait of despair and hopelessness in the city and in the two men during the nighttime hours.  The scenes are quite dark in their tone with hardly any light on the subjects.  The eclectic soundtrack (Damon Gough) is mournful and tellingly moody including featured songs by 'Badly Drawn Boy'. Original music which I found simply amazing and positively worth the listen.  I found this movie a study of complete familial dysfunction, but an account of a son trying to survive his life alone without anyone he could ever fully count on.",1346457600,6,4528,4.844559585492228

5111714,5,B007VXT9SS,"Few films concerning father/son relationships have been able to produce the emotional impact of this masterfully written and directed and acted BEING FLYNN. Paul Weitz directs and adapted the 2004 memoir by Nick Flynn ""Another Bulls__t Night in Suck City: A Memoir"" and brought together a superlative cast that just may be Robert De Niro's finest hour.  Nick Flynn deserves the credit for this articulate tale of his own life:  he was born and grew up in Scituate, Massachusetts, south of Boston. His parents divorced when he was young and his mother committed suicide when he was 22. He drifted through several jobs before starting work at a homeless shelter in Boston, where at age twenty-seven, he met his estranged, homeless father for the first time. That is the core of the film.

The nature of the film works very well: we simultaneously meet Jonathan Flynn (Robert DeNiro), a man who believes he is `America's greatest writer along side Mark Twain and JD Salinger, who lives life day to day in a drunken stupor, driving taxis, acting out con games etc until he becomes homeless, and after seeking shelter from old friends he has neglected, he ends up in a homeless shelter. We also meet his estranged son Nick Flynn (Paul Dano, in a breakout performance) who is striving to discover who he is, perceiving himself as a writer but unsuccessful with relationships: Nick's mother Jody (Julianne Moore) we see only in flashbacks because she committed suicide, and his only communication with his absent father has been through letters. Also homeless, Nick moves with with two characters (Eddie Rouse and Steve Cirbus) who manage to help Nick find a job in a homeless shelter. As Nick adjusts to working at the shelter he comes into connect with a potential girlfriend Denise (Olivia Thirlby) and begins to feel as though his life has some degree of meaning.  The jolt comes when Jonathan seeks shelter in the homeless shelter where Nick works and it is this coming together of two bruised and pained people who happen to be father and son that sets in motion the resolution of the story. Both men are pitiful but both have redeeming characteristics and it is this struggling coming together that makes the film breathe.  In addition to the brilliant acting of the main characters, there are also exceptionally memorable roles by Lili Taylor, Victor Rasuk, Thomas Middleditch, Wes Studi, Chris Chalk and others.

Not only is the film pitch perfect in nearly every detail, but it also gives the viewer the opportunity to consider the plight of the homeless around us.  How many tragic stories like this are untold or never will be known? When a film can produce that degree of involvement with the audience it goes beyond simply being a film and becomes art - art makes us consider, think, and change.

5111715,5,B007VXT9SS,"Based on a true story, this remarkable involving journey of relationships between fathers and sons captures your attention immediately. One father, Robert DeNiro, trys to reach out and bond with his son that he hasn't seen for a long time. His son is still feeling the loss of his mother, and trying to enter into a romantic relationship with his girlfriend. The last thing the boy wants to see is his father. This is an emotional drama as well as a comedy. Serious moments and funny moments. One young man is hurting emotionally as his father continues to struggle. The film portrays a second chance in life, inspiration, and a step forward in faith. Great acting performance, especially with De Niro, bittersweet story,and an emotional roller-coaster ride.

5111744,4,B007VXT9SS,"I haven't read Nick Flynn's autobiographical book on which ""Being Flynn"" was based, so I'm addressing here only its effectiveness as a movie and not its adequacy or otherwise as a representation of the book.  And on its own terms as a movie, it works well.  In Paul Dano (as Nick Flynn) and Robert DeNiro  (as his delusional father, Jonathan), it is very strongly cast, and in its attention to practical circumstances of being homeless or of living and working in a homeless shelter, it has a quality of slightly heightened documentary style that seems just right for a story about two men who consider themselves writers and whose writing seems to be concerned to give shape to their lives.  When I say, ""heightened,"" I mean that we get the sleeping on grates and in the garbage piles, but these are photographed quite artfully but nonetheless effectively, and our noses, so to speak, are not rubbed in the artfulness.  Another virtue of the movie is its refusal of sentimentality.  Jonathan has been absent from Paul's life for almost two decades, and he gets in touch only when he's in dire need -- he has become homeless.  He's a self-centered, difficult, at times violent man, convinced of his genius as a writer, and not at all interested in his son's life.  When Nick tells him that he too is a writer, Jonathan's response is couched in terms of the genius that he has transmitted and not on any achievement or potential in Nick himself.  A lesser movie would set the relationship up for a climax in which mutual understanding and respect is articulated, but we get something well short of that uplift, though still moving enough.  At the center of the movie is Nick's decision to get his aimless, stoner-ish life in order by working at a shelter (run by ""the Captain,"" played by Wes Studi, whom I hadn't seen in a long time), only to have his father come to live in the shelter and behave often badly.  Nick's response, even as he tries to do his job, is to revert to drug use and aimlessness, before pulling himself together, with the encouragement of  Denise (Olivia Thirlby), a co-worker, and join an addiction support group.  Just as the relationship with his father isn't led to a sentimental conclusion, so is the sentimental ""salvation"" by Denise's love avoided, and the crowded, semi-chaotic scenes in the shelter and on the street keep our feet on the ground.

Formally, the movie uses a double voice-over technique -- we get parts of the story told by Jonathan and parts by Nick.  Nick's parts hearken back to memories of his life with his single mother (Julianne Moore, very effective); The delusional and self-centered Jonathan is focused in his present.  Nick's fear, of course, is not that he'll lose his father but that he'll turn out to be just like him.  Since the way their narratives are handled show that he ISN'T like him, we come to be concerned that nonetheless he might come to believe that he is, and that would be a kind of defeat.  Whether or not that is avoided, you'll have to watch the movie to find out.  Paul Dano is very good as a young man whose confidence comes and goes and whose belief in himself is uncertain.  DeNiro, with a less complicated character, is nonetheless absolutely convincing as a delusional, self-involved man who has damaged lives without apparently being aware of it, and who reveals both how pathetic Johnny is and how unaware of that how he appears.  The characterizations are consistent up to the very last frames.  Well worth a look.",1453766400,,3501,4.686274509803922

5111752,4,B007VXT9SS,"This is a very touching, literate film that boasts De Niro's finest performance for too many years.  Frankly, I'd written him off after Cape Fear as resting on his laurels through mostly trash that was beneath his talent.  He did nothing new in Heat, nothing new in Casino or Analyze This or That or the Focker fiascos.  But here he shines as an alcoholic father with grandiose dreams of being one of the great fiction writers.  There are layers to his work here that remind one of his finest performances, those that brought him to the limelight in the early 70s.  Poignantly there are scenes in which he drives a cab in NYC that cannot help remind one of his amazing tour de force in Taxi Driver.  There is even a scene in which the actor stares at himself in a mirror horrified at the ravages time has brought to his visage.  The rest of the cast is in fine form, especially Paul Dano as the long suffering son, but this is definitely De Niro's film.  Why he wasn't nominated for this epic role is beyond me.
PS  I should note that his performance in Silver Linings Playbook was also a return to greatness for the actor.",1440460800,,1123,4.386473429951691

5111767,3,B007VXT9SS,"The film starts out with two subplots and first person narrations. Jonathan Flynn (Robert De Niro), cab driver, ex-con fancies himself a writer. He carries with pride a rejection letter that praise his work. He has a drinking and reality problem as he proclaims his situation is to ""gather excellent material."" Everything he writes is a masterpiece or so he constantly reminds us.

His son Nick (Paul Dano) lives in the same city of Boston. He writes poetry, the type of tripe you hear at some poetry house that you think is dark and meaningful. He finds himself working at a homeless shelter, ""the last step before the morgue"" and it doesn't take much to figure out how these subplots come together. Nick is constantly re-examining his life and childhood he spent being raised by his mother (Julianne Moore), without a father.

The film was well acted. However, the message was all over the place. ""It is a long climb up and a quick step down."" was one message I got. Whatever father/son relationship message there should have been was lost with quick transitions. Nick's drug addiction was done rather quickly and meaninglessly.

There is one of those dramas indie lovers will praise, but the regular Joe will find lacks solid entertainment value.

While the autobiographical story follows the conflict between the father and son, the films flashback section tells us about Nicks loving mother Jody (Julianne Moore).

The best part of the 2012 American drama Being Flynn is Robert De Niro's strong performance. Another memorable thing is the films realistic descriptions of the shelter. Unfortunately, directed by Paul Weitz (American Pie About a Boy), the film doesn't give us much insight into the father-son relationship. Their complicated relationship could have been much more emotionally involving.

5111784,4,B007VXT9SS,"Being Flynn is a pretty realistic portrayal of the homeless, which is probably not supposed to be the main drawing point of the movie but nonetheless, it's the aspect that stuck with me the most after the movie was over.  It's about Robert De Niro not only insisting he's a talented writer, but also praising himself to the moon like he's comparable to God and that he's in the process of creating his most important work despite nobody -especially his son- not believing him.  In addition to that, in the beginning Robert's character is quite unusual in the way he's borderline psychotic and gives me the impression that he's lost his mind, which is strange because he shouldn't feel this way until *after* he's been living in the streets for a while.  Seems sort of backwards there.  However such an unpredicable personality also produces pretty surprising, funny and interesting bits of storytelling.

Meanwhile Robert hasn't seen his son in over 18 years, and when the two eventually reconnect, well for a while we go down memory lane as we see how the mother/wife (played by the always talented and beautiful Julianne Moore) lost her life as a result of a suicide.  Rather oddly however, the tone here usually feels positive and optimistic, instead of dreadful and hopeless.  This is probably unintentional and can be pretty much be explained by the actors starring in the movie.  I mean, I know Robert De Niro like millions of others since he's starred in so many films over the years, so I can sense the direction the movie is going.  His character isn't going to just die and the movie will be over.  That's not how Robert functions!  That probably explains the mostly positive tone even during the worst of circumstances.

Some things didn't really make sense to me, such as the son suddenly participating in drugs for no clear reason (unless I missed a crucial moment in the storytelling).  He didn't really have any reason to suddenly do drugs, especially after Robert basically praises him over and over insisting that he has the same writing talent because he's Robert's son, so he's a part of Robert.  You'd think if anything giving such praise would encourage his son to be a mentally happier and motivated person.  Strange how the opposite occurs.  I can only guess that the son losing his mother to suicide may be a factor in his use of drugs, which soon affects his relationship with a girl that isn't necessarily interested in a relationship but doesn't mind sleeping with men (and I KNOW what you're thinking but eh, I don't think she's trashy at all- you'll have to see her character to know what I mean.  She's actually very smart and has her priorities straight).

But yeah, seeing Robert De Niro sleeping on heating vents in the city streets just to keep warm while the snow is falling and the temperatures are falling as the winter rolls along as it gets colder and colder... you really feel for his character.  You want him to succeed.  You want him to aspire to be the great writer that he insists he is.  You want him to get out of the rut he dug himself in.  ""Memoirs of a Moron"" Robert was calling it?  haha!  Why the son never asked his own father to live with him is a huge question mark, however. Why not?  Just because he's a little bonkers?  Nah, I'd let him in my apartment room if he was MY dad.  I'd never let his life deteriorate to such an extent.

Anyway, small inconsistencies aside, and perhaps the overall tone not being as affectionate as it could have been since you don't really feel a close connection between Robert De Niro and his son like the movie writers were going for, Being Flynn is still most definitely a good movie.  I highly recommend it.  It has a good meaningful message behind it, and unfortunately the homeless parts are all too realistic.

The lives of these two disconnected men will change in ways that are unimaginable.  DeNiro's turn here is note perfect despite being buoyant.  In lesser hands you could say it was over-the-top but DeNiro plays it to perfection.  Dano's more subdued turn is appropriate for his character who is quietly simmering inside and it compliments DeNiro's largesse.  Good supporting work is offered by Julianne Moore seen in flashback as Nicholas' mother and Wes Studi as the shelter supervisor.  This film brought to mind a film DeNiro did years ago called ""This Boy's Life"" with Leonardo DiCaprio that explored a toxic father-surrogate son relationship.  If the characters DeNiro played in both films weren't so pathetic you would absolutely despise them.",1370304000,,1350,5.0633484162895925

It didn't get huge reviews nationally, but lots of films that do, I never could see why.  Is it worth paying $2.99 and spending a couple of hours to watch?  In my opinion, absolutely!

5111805,5,B007VXT9SS,"""Being Flynn"" with Paul Dano and Robert DeNiro is a film devastating in it's subtlety.  Considering the dramatic nature of Flynn's life and the unusual cast of characters that pop in and out of his memoirs (""Another Bulls*** Night In Suck City"", ""The Ticking is the Bomb"") director Paul Weitz could have gone for another music video, ""Basketball Diaries"" MTV spot on this one, but he didn't.  It is mostly believable and heart wrenching.  While I could have done without so much of the self aware ""Gen X"" 90's culture present in the film, that is part of the time period Flynn was writing in, I guess.

When Nick Flynn was a young man his mother shot herself as a result of drug use, being overworked, and also as a reaction to the abandonment of her husband, Jonathan Flynn.  His father Jonathan was (is) a grandiose, megalomaniacal liar who despite his absence continuously sent him letters about what a great writer he was, and how ""Nicholas"" must have the same gene and be destined for the same greatness.

I remember when his first collection of poems (""Some Ether"") emerged, still a standout in the vast and tiring world of Ivy League ""confessional"" poetry.  A life can be unusual and devastating and still be uninteresting if the writer isn't talented.  Though I enjoyed his poems more than memoirs, Nick Flynn is definitely talented.

Without giving away the story entirely, Nick searches for some sense of self definition by working with the homeless and thereby seeking to become less self absorbed.  One day, his father shows up.  Things go from bad to worse to bad again with a hint of redemption at the end; Nick is a real writer, his father a narcissistic jerk with just a few bricks short of a load.  Robert De Niro does some of the best acting he's done in quite awhile.  For anyone interested in Nick Flynn or those rare movies that concern writers and actually tell their story, this is a must see.",1362441600,,1916,4.633136094674557
5111806,4,B007VXT9SS,"Here is a movie I like.

5111807,5,B007VXT9SS,"This is a film that dwells in the real street level of people barely holding on. Never blaming or criticizing, it holds its' characters accountable for their own actions, even by the supporting cast of characters within the film. Within the film we see the bottom of human depths and dependancy and the frail social, public and governmental resources available to allay and defray those depths of suffering. And in almost every case they fail. What the fervent, religious and grotesquely optimistic can never fathom is the loss of all hope. The absolute and irreversible knowledge that we have done all that we can, and that even more poignant, we know it is not enough. Nick Flynns mother falls into this category. His father falls into the category of a force of nature that while irresistible is still horribly broken and unforgiving. And yet he is the one who survives and as the last scene of the film provides has made some small acquiescence to, maybe not the nature of his own flesh and blood, but to the very nature of humanity to expound, nurture and forgive. And finally to the mercurial Olivia Thirlby, who has once again put herself into another beautiful film of somewhat flawed but hopeful and redemptive human decency.",1361232000,4,1234,4.7981220657277

5111809,5,B007VXT9SS,"Brilliant, real, mesmerizing in every way.  The way a functioning person can fall into homelessness very easily is depicted here in a real way.  Riveting DeNiro & especially Paul Dano.

One reviewer said this was a severely depressing film, while that is true, it's also as uplifting as it is downy.

2 teeny things that bother me which have nothing to do with the merit of this great, Oscar-caliber film::

1)  Had a tough time buying the regal, elegant Julianne Moore as a blue-collar struggling, downtrodden waitress-bank teller.  Love her, love the film, but she will never be believable as a Boston blue-collar mom with a sad life.  Never.  She physically looks too patrician and classy to be believable in this role even though she's a wonderful actress who played the part well.

2) to reviewer Grady Harp:  memorable part by Lili Taylor?  I'm her biggest fan but seeing this for the first time last night - I waited and waited for her to come on.  Never happened, but for a walk-on which consisted of Lili uttering the following one line: ""Hi"".  and hugging a few people.  Period.  Her part must have been cut, and you, Grady, being a professional reviewer: must have received a different copy of the film than the rest of us.

But all in all, a memorable, haunting, fantastic film, which I will be purchasing right now to watch again and again.

5111826,3,B007VXT9SS,"I confess to being somewhat disappointed by this movie.  Having read the autobiography which it is based upon, I would say that it just doesn't measure up.  ""Another Bull___ Night in S*ck City"" was Nick Flynn's story, pure and simple.  ""Being Flynn"" from the beginning bounces back and forth from the separate points of view of Nick Flynn (Paul Dano) and his father Jonathan (Robert DeNiro).  This 'double narrative' perspective seems to have been done in order to drive home the film's message, which is ""like father, like son"".  That's a bit heavyhanded, in comparison to the book, and it only succeeds in jumbling the storyline and making it more confusing.

When I read the book, I never envisioned Nick Flynn as a ""slacker hero"", and Paul Dano's portrayal makes Flynn seem pretty sallow and weak.  Opposite that, you have Robert DeNiro barely refraining from scene-stealing with a blustery and largely empty performance.

I did find some solace in the recessed role of Julianne Moore as Flynn's suicidal mother... Moore delivered a very effective, measured performance.  But, overall this movie was a very underwhelming, faulty translation of a fine memoir in book form.  It panders to Generation X (score by 'Badly Drawn Boy'), leaves out a lot of stuff, like the time Flynn spent living in the harbor on a boat, and in general just deflates the book into pretty commonplace fare.",1347840000,2,1386,4.935344827586207

He berates his son and lashes out at people offering to help him with food, shelter, and clothing. Still, I was rooting for Jonathan to be everything he imagined himself to be as a writer.

8522347,5,B007VXT9SS,"This is perhaps Robert DeNiro last great leading role.  His more recent movies have been underwhelming.  All the actors do a superb job in this film.

""Being Flynn"" is based on Nickolas Flynn's account of his earlier life, a young man haunted by his mother's suicide (played in flashbacks by Julianne Moore) and the abandonment by his father, a loser trapped in a drunken delusionist's body.  Nick is brilliantly portrayed by Paul Dano; DeNiro plays the father.

Nick's father was never a part of his life until they meet again in a homeless shelter where Nick works and his father comes as a guest.  Nick tries to make sense of his father, but all he gets back is hurt, more insults, and a futuristic vision of himself if he continues with his own boozing and drug taking. Nick is thus a man with many demons.  What hurts is the father taking no responsibility as a parent.

Most of the story takes place at the homeless shelter and is dark, yet realistic. The drugs, booze and violence dominate the theme during the underlighted, chaotic scenes.  While not quite a story of redemption, Nick cleans up, moves on, goes back to school, marries, has a daughter and publishes books of poetry.  He has become the writer his own father failed at achieving.
