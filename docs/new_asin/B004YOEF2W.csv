8448674,4,B004YOEF2W,"Not a bad collection of four episodes of Buffalo Bill, Jr., which is always a fun watch if you're in a kiddie western mood. Lots of action, typical kid humor, and good views of the Vasquez Rock vistas you see in every western show of the era.",1400112000,,242,4.170212765957447
