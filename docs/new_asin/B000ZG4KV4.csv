Now comes a documentary about the Swedish pianist Roland Pntinen. The film consists of a 'Portrait' (30 mins) that shows the pianist getting ready for a concert in 2007 at the Ruhr Piano Festival and in particular working with composer Kaija Saariaho on the premire of her piece Prlude and Ballade, and 'Concert' (75 mins) of that recital, and an interview with Schmidt-Garre (an excellent and very knowledgeable interviewer; 65 mins) talking with Pntinen. There is also a 'bonus' of Pntinen playing an Ignaz Friedman piano transcription of the 'Schatz-Walzer' of Johann Strauss jr.

The concert has an eclectic program:

Couperin: Les Baricades mistrieuses
Rameau: Gavotte in A minor with 6 doubles
Busoni: Albumblatt; Elegien: Turandots Frauengemach - Die Nachtlichen; Toccata
Kaija Saariaho: Prlude - Ballade
Chopin: Ballade No. 4 in F minor
Albniz: Iberia: Rondea - Triana
Rachmaninov: Morceaux de fantaisie: Srnade
Ravel: Miroirs: Oiseaux tristes

Pntinen is a fine pianist but in my opinion is not on the same exalted level as the three pianists whose documentaries preceded his. Also, in the conversation with Schmidt-Garre his manner of speaking, although thoughtful and informative, is so slow and hesitant that it becomes a bit of a difficulty staying with it. Hence, the four star rating. But the live concert itself is really quite good and worth seeing and hearing, although I could never bring myself to particularly enjoy the Saariaho pieces.

One could only hope that Schmidt-Garre could make a documentary about Grigoriy Sokolov, surely one of the greatest pianists of our time, but Sokolov's shyness and difficult personality probably make that an impossibility. How about Stephen Hough, Mr Schmidt-Garre?
