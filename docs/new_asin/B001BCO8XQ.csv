3488881,5,B001BCO8XQ,I Love these movies! Glad to have them on one disk.,1521417600,,51,3.727272727272727
3488882,4,B001BCO8XQ,I saw this on Amazon with Roku but I didn't buy it!!...did I??,1521158400,,62,3.8461538461538463
3488883,5,B001BCO8XQ,"I like this movie very much. I never watched the TV series, but enjoyed this film on its own. Vey interesting, thought provoking, and suspenseful. Made me want to see every TV episode.",1520121600,,184,4.606060606060606
3488884,5,B001BCO8XQ,GOOD DEAL,1519776000,,9,4.0
3488885,5,B001BCO8XQ,"Fight the Future is the best of the two, with a far bigger ""movie feel"" but it helps to know the backstory which would mean watching the first 5 seasons, or at least watching the ""alien arc"" stories.  I Want To Believe is a good, solid, 2 part episode made into a movie with many great supporting actors (especially Billy Connolly).  It's basically a stand alone story so no X-files experience is needed, but the best advice I can give you is watch the entire series from start to current season.  The movies will mean a bit more and the whole series is probably the greatest, most interesting series ever made for prime time TV.",1519776000,,629,4.452173913043478
3488886,3,B001BCO8XQ,"3.5  Because I love the X-Files. The first movie - Fight the Future - played with no problems. It was a wonderful crisp picture and I enjoyed the extras.

The second movie - I Want to Believe - would not work in my blu ray player no matter how hard we tried, so points off for that.",1519171200,,282,3.9298245614035086
3488887,5,B001BCO8XQ,I started watching X Files Season 10 so I am not really familiar with the mythology but I like Mulder and Scully so iI enjoyed this movie a lot.,1518393600,,144,4.0

3488912,1,B001BCO8XQ,"Basically one long ""regular"" X-Files episode, very minimal mythology plot. They barely touch on what happened at the end of the original series. If you want more X-Files plot, you won't find it here!",1506297600,,199,4.882352941176471

3488917,4,B001BCO8XQ,"Typical X-Files stuff - a quality production with interesting plot twists, this time dealing with the supernatural. Not quite as good as the 'other' X-Files movie but close.",1500422400,,173,5.214285714285714

3488952,5,B001BCO8XQ,So many shows that have gone away that I wish wouldn't have and this is one of them. This second movie is pretty good and I really enjoyed it myself. Straight from the X-Files.,1490400000,,176,4.205882352941177
3488953,5,B001BCO8XQ,It's the X-Files!  We all want to believe...but seriously it's another good movie in the X-Files which falls in line with the X-Files franchise.  Can anyone get enough of Agent Mulder and Agent Scully?  I know I can't!,1490400000,,218,4.684210526315789

3488960,2,B001BCO8XQ,"Huge fan of the TV series.  I still remember giving my brother a hard time for watching it obsessively (and philosophizing about it) back in the day.  I didn't get into it until nearly a decade later and appreciated the characters, story-line and humor.

HOWEVER, this movie seems as if it was pushed on the actors.  Like the producers were trying to milk the original, but the actors had mentally moved on.  The dialogue doesn't flow as well, the chemistry between the actors is lacking and the drama seems contrived.  As for this particular story...it's been done before on X-files...this movie was a tactical momentum business decision.",1487462400,,639,4.925233644859813

3488964,5,B001BCO8XQ,What you would expect from X-Flies but a little more creepier. Good movie,1485734400,,73,4.6923076923076925
3488965,5,B001BCO8XQ,This is 2 disc set. Each movie and what appear to be all special features.  Great deal!,1484524800,,87,4.117647058823529
3488966,3,B001BCO8XQ,Must have been written by a committee.  It was not up to the standards of the TV series or the earlier movie.,1484179200,,109,3.9545454545454546

This isn't that X-Files, it's more-or-less the X-fails...

It's just another one of those, I watched it once, but I forgot what it was all about movies. Yeah, one of those movies that you watched, forgot about, and never watched again.

Again, if you must watch it, rent it, don't buy it.",1480204800,,379,4.5588235294117645

3488998,5,B001BCO8XQ,"Honestly? Sometimes this movie gets weird and stuff happens and you're not really sure what's going on or why what just happened happened. But let's be real. Seeing Mulder and Scully in this light is worth all of that. Seeing them together, outside of the X Files, with a house and bed and a porch. Seeing them, for even just a few minutes, being domestic, is all a lot of us have ever wanted from CC. Screw the syndicate and CSM, the heart of this show has always been their relationship.",1476835200,,489,4.384615384615385
3488999,3,B001BCO8XQ,"While the narrative is lacking in a lot of ways, it's still a great X File story... though it doesn't add very much to the lore of the world or the depth of our two main agents. Kinda feels like a wasted opportunity to have a movie seven years after the finale and not expand upon where they left off.",1476403200,,301,4.033333333333333

3489011,4,B001BCO8XQ,"Great movie.  This movie bridges the end of Season 5 and the beginning of Season 6.  I don't want to give anything away, but just know that the special effects are pretty fitting for big screen ""episode"" of the X-Files.  Think of it as a 2-parter with an amped up budget.  If you're a fan of the series, this movie won't disappoint.",1476057600,,332,4.306451612903226

3489015,3,B001BCO8XQ,"I enjoyed the movie and the production value, but honestly think that the story was lacking, It passed through hastily at times, and then dragged on in others.

3489016,1,B001BCO8XQ,"This product was a joke. I tried to play Fight the Future on my PS4, XBOX One, and PS3 and no such luck on all three devices. I thought my PS4 was going to break as the device tried to read it but couldn't. It was past two months to return, however I just wanted to express my extreme displeasure.

3489020,2,B001BCO8XQ,"I expected it to give me the closure that the series finale of season 9 failed to provide, but it didn't. It's just as confusing and open-ended as many of the other X-Files episodes. Just a monster-of-the-week ep made into a movie.",1473984000,,231,4.523809523809524
3489021,3,B001BCO8XQ,"As far as X-Files goes, this movie was a drawn out episode that didn't bring much to the table. The acting was good, but the actors couldn't save the plot. It's a very interesting concept, however, you go in with the expectation that this movie is going to involve women being impregnated with alien DNA like Scully and like the description says. This movie was just a huge let down.",1473724800,,383,4.485714285714286
3489022,5,B001BCO8XQ,This episode unfortunately didn't explain why Mulder isn't still wanted after his death sentence in the final season. Not like the star chamber is just going to forget about that...,1473638400,,181,5.066666666666666

3489035,4,B001BCO8XQ,"I can't believe I waited this long to watch this movie having been a big X-file series fan.  The new run of episodes got me motivated to catch up on this one and it was definitely something a fan of the stand alone (vs the conspiracy mythology) fans would like.  I personally liked both, but for those who weren't into the whole mythology arc would really enjoy this.  It probably also makes it better for those not familiar with the series.  I'm going with 4 stars because I don't see this as a movie the mythology fans would like very much, but I could be wrong.",1471910400,,564,4.2924528301886795
3489036,3,B001BCO8XQ,"A Llttle boring, and both main characters seemed tired and drab. LOVE the X-File series, but this was a poor attempt to rekindle the series. Nice to see the main characters again and follow their evolution, but a disappointing film.",1471737600,,232,4.825

3489040,5,B001BCO8XQ,Not the best XFiles movie but needed it to complete my entire set. It also bridges the end of season 9 and the mini series that premiere this year. I gave it five because I simply love the XFiles. It was my all time favorite series ever.,1471046400,,237,4.0638297872340425

Yes, Mulder and Scully are grown up and sad and still wonderful and great and still wonderful and awesome and I love them, but it's also not the same. The X-Files doesn't translate as well to this time period, honestly, so it's sometimes a little stilted.

The movie makes absolutely no sense. There are plot holes everywhere, and the entire premise is ridiculous and a little silly. Its really unfortunate, because no film has been made since and this franchise and collection of characters deserves better.

It just wasn't what I had hoped it would be.  Sad, really.  The silver lining to the proverbial shining star was Billy Connolly as Father Joseph Crissman.  (And what is it with Hollyweird these days that they _just have to_ hire some [c]rap star?  Do they not think there's not enough talent in Tinseltown any longer?  Well, if that's the case, then SURE... knock yourself out.  But these people who can barely put together two much less three syllable words into a sentence, that's just plain stupid.  I guess they're trying to bait the younger crowd.

As for Connolly... I've been listening to that guy since I was a young man living in Scotland.  And when I say ""listen"" I mean just that.  He was a stand up comedian with albums.  Anyway, I digress.  I Want to Believe left me scratching my noggin.  I thought I had been had, maybe it was the years.  Hell, even Scully was looking ragged.",1468540800,,1061,4.299492385786802

3489059,4,B001BCO8XQ,"Ten years after the first film and six years after the end of the series, a second film is brought up. Scully and Mulder are no longer FBI agents and dealing with the X files that must have disappeared. Yet they get mixed up in a strange story of a missing FBI agent who comes to the attention of Dr Scully in her hospital work because of some kind of psychic who pretends he sees the missing agent.

Just that level of fable and the resistance Mulder airs are quite banal and in no way surprising. Yet of course the two will get involved in this abduction or disappearance. But it will become very gross and typical of George W. Bushs paranoia about the world and Russia in particular.

The FBI agent was abducted because she was the proper genetic stuff to provide a body to the head of a man who would have been dying if he had not been hosted by a body that is worth little. No surprise of course that the head is that of a man, and the new body is that of an abducted female FBI agent. I guess in 2008 no one was particular about gender orientation any more, in spite of Proposition 8 in California.

The worst part is that this Frankenstein research was performed by some Russian doctors who experimented on dogs, transferring one head to another body and vice versa, producing mongrels of another nature.

Apart from the gruesome and out-grossing pictures, situations and ideas, this film has little to do with traditional themes in the X files. It is not even in any way paranormal since it is perfectly imaginable today, even in 2008, that such grafting techniques were possible. In the same way as the other film adapted from the series, this film is too slow in rhythm. I guess it takes some imagination to understand that the two media, TV and cinema, do not have the same logic and thus do not work the same way. For one, the screens are not the same size and the definition is till different.

3489121,5,B001BCO8XQ,"I liked the movie very much. One wonders what must have happened to Mulder and Scully after they were on run. One wonders how they have fared and if fared well, how they have been able to adjust to a low or obscure profiles from a previously much exposed profiles in FBI world and Power Circles.

Not going into details of the movie, I would just like to mention that I loved to watch the slowing down mellowing couple who talk about coming home to each other as far more important than any dark case that they have to solve. And yet, in this sanctity of quiet home, filled with independence and love, living on with the emptiness of having lost their son, the true natures of Mulder and Scully play out in full passion.

Throughout the X Files series, Mulder and Scully's characteristics have been known to their avid fans. And those fans will now again find the same traits that makes the partnership of these two work. And very interestingly without bringing Aliens or ETs into the screenplay, the essential nature of these two is brought out, its tested once again as to why these two click together and why they look for each other's support.

It is all about what they are willing to believe and uphold. Inspite of their differences, that almost threaten their togetherness, what holds them together is their compassion for human life, to relieve people from suffering, to not give up as long as they can work to have the living live in dignity as it deserves.

The compassion is not just for other people depending on them, it is also for each other even if it might not be in their best interest. For ex: Scully asking Mulder to help FBI to begin with, in hunting down the missing FBI agent. Scully could have known in advance what it might to do her if Mulder is asked to work, but she does it anyways in the better judgement of finding some work for Mulder, having Mulder obtain pardon from FBI from his previous charges. It obviously is going to help Mulder venture out of his protected territory.

In conclusion, I have to say, I liked how the ability to believe and wanting to believe are juxtaposed for Mulder and Scully. It was this mould of their temperaments that led their success in X Files and finding for themselves a successful and fulfilling partnership at work and sharing their lives.

Acting wise, Gillian Anderson brings out a lot of shades to Scully's character, a person who loves her partner Mulder for what he is and yet trying to break free of him and make sense of her own life. And while doing this, she is still able to maintain a transparent relationship with her partner. Scully's shades are more revealed than what has been scripted or brought out for Mulder. As usual there is not much conflict for him, in the way he works out details before him, but what has been nuanced nicely for him is, that he is reluctant to take up work without Scully besides him and feels deeply disappointed when Scully refuses to join him. Although his belief won't let him relent in going on alone on his investigation, he won't give up, it being his innate quality, we can start seeing his happiness sapped out of him, if Scully is not with him. Its like Mulder is really happy as a clam sitting all alone in his office in isolation, but there is no doubt how he gets excited if there was something he could with Scully involved with him. Scully on other hand does not have this kind of dependency on Mulder for her pursuit of her life's truths, but she does look for strength of belief from Mulder, the moment she is standing confronting truth out there.

(Others will disagree with me, I'm sure.) The last 1/4 of the movie was a bit ridiculous in my opinion, but still fun.

It was a switch from most of the series episodes which 80 % of them dealt with alien abduction or UFOs or monsters.
David Duchovny, Gillian Anderson and special guest star Billy Connelly as a pedophile psychic priest were superb. A real nail biting missing persons case which glued me to my seat.

I understand problems with it, i do, but as far as a movie made so long after the last season, it's pretty great.  I'm not going to fully review the movie because there are so many people doing that.

The story is almost completely standalone from the series, and only vague familiarity with the characters is needed.

Movie looks great on Blu Ray, and there's a decent amount of special features as well as an extended cut of the film.",1446854400,,418,4.791666666666667
3489209,4,B001BCO8XQ,"While I liked the series fine I am not a fan. In fact I don't know what fans wish to have revealed, when the first few episodes pretty much have everything that you need to know, other than details.

As a modest stand alone movie, I liked it fine. It captures the feel of individual X Files episodes and is grotesque enough to merit big screen status. The story gains depth with the use of the Mulder and Scully characters.
I like the catholic aspects of the movie, as the priest is shown to be tortured by his sins and seeking redemption and not merely sinful. Even if that thing doesn't really go anywhere.

I think this is a very nice update of Gordon Hessler's themes in Scream and Scream Again (1970) in addition to them being handled in Brittania Hospital and some of Hammer's Frankenstein films.
My wife could barely take it, she was crying thru the more grotesque scenes.

As long as you don't go in looking for Sci-fi you will like it fine too. Do you really need the aliens to have an X-File? No, you don't. It is very much a horror film in that grand guignol tradition.

Frankenstein is science fiction because of the corpse reanimation, not merely because of surgery or organ transplant.

In this movie we are simply showing organs and limbs being transplanted from one living being to another. This is something that is no longer science fiction, but science fact.

Sure, you can still say that it is fiction and it is using a scientific base for it, thus science fiction. Fine.
But the emphasis is not even on that.

The X Files is Science Fiction, because it presents a secret government agency that deals with occult knowledge and science, but not much of that is evident here.

The psi power and stigmata themes, though often construed as science fiction, barely come into play, if at all, as an alternate answer is provided before the end.

The use of alien technology prevalent in the series, barely comes into play.

The only obvious science fiction element is the use of the fictional animal tranquilizer, that may or may not be merely an incidental item in the transplantation of the limbs and organs.

With emphasis in a woman being graphically physically attacked and abducted, another woman being stalked and attacked, with human body parts found buried in the snow, on graphic surgery being shown on screen, with attacks by a monstrous two headed dog and with Mulder under threat of being dismembered alive via axe this is horror all the way.

Yes, it is also sci-fi in the way that Les Yeux Sans Visage, or The Incredible Two Headed Transplant are also sci-fi. Most reviewers accept that they are mostly horror, however.

The reason I describe it as horror, with specific examples which indicate which type of horror it is, is so that someone seeking the movie will know what to expect. This way the people who will be interested in this type of story will seek it out and see it and enjoy it.

If you say it is Science Fiction, especially considering on what the movie trailers led us to expect, you are giving them the wrong idea on what to expect, thus you set them up for disappointment.

The wrong people will see it.

3489240,3,B001BCO8XQ,"3 stars mean ""it's ok"" and that is exactly what this movie is....it's ok. Clearly, it should have been a made for TV movie but regardless, the movie had no real plot and was mostly just character exposition. I did enjoy seeing Mulder and Scully back together again, but the movie should have clearly had a bigger PLOT. I mean, I don't know what the writers were thinking. Why not have something to do with the so-called alien invasion that was supposed to have taken place in 2012?

Weird subject matters and a plot that  involved a gay body snatching couple who abducted people for their body parts made this an extremely bizarre film. I was hoping this film would delve more into the unexplained phenomenon like first contacts, mythical underground worlds and things like that. Instead, we get a film about black market organs and the age old controversy of whether God is real or not. I thought the X-files were well past  religious debates. I guessed wrong.",1435017600,,629,4.869158878504673

In addition, the plot is  unbalanced, with a deus ex machina,  ""saved by the calvary "" end, there's lots of ugly deaths, a sadistic feel and a meandering focus.  Photos, real ones i think, of vivesection/abuse of a dog. . Ughh.

Buried beneath the FBIs countless case files lay mysteries so strange, so impenetrable, that only two agents would ever dare confront them. FBI Special Agent Fox Mulder [David Duchovny] and FBI Special Agent Dana Scully [Gillian Anderson]. Based on the hugely popular, award-winning television phenomenon that ran for nine seasons, and in response to a worldwide demand from millions of devoted fans, these thrill-packed films take The X-Files inventive blend of paranoia, horror and suspense to a whole new level. In The X-Files: Fight The Future, Mulder and Scully risk their careers and their lives to hunt down a deadly virus that may be extra-terrestrial in origin and could ultimately destroy all mankind. Then, when a fellow agent mysteriously disappears in The X-Files: I Want To Believe, the pair enlist help from a priest with a questionable past...and a startling vision of the future. As sparks ignite between FBI Special Agent Fox Mulder and FBI Special Agent Dana Scully, paranormal realities rise up to confound their work at every turn as the quest for truth continues.

FILM FACT: ""We wanted it to be true to the TV show, for one thing. We didn't want The X-Files to become something else in the movie, just because we had a bigger budget to work with. Yet, we were also mindful that it had to be a culmination of something for the people who had been watching the show for five years, as well as an introduction of these characters and this story to people who hadn't.""  Frank Spotnitz talking about the development of The X-Files film.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: The X-Files may have been off-air for 11 years, but the fan base for the show is still strong. After originally debuting in the US in 1993, the show went on to become one of the biggest science-fiction shows of all-time following the adventures of FBI Special Agent Fox Mulder [David Duchovny] and FBI Special Agent Dana Scully [Gillian Anderson]. The show lasted for 9 seasons and produced two spin-off films with its last outing in 2008. Amazingly the show has never been released on Blu-ray and up until the past few weeks only one of the films had been.

For the shows 20th Anniversary Edition, 20th Century Fox have finally released the 1998 film The X Files: Fight The Future and re-released the 2008 sequel The X Files: I Want To Believe. The two films can be purchased individually but its the UK Limited Edition SteelBook that is likely to get a lot of fans in a big lather. Before we dig into the actual films themselves, lets talk a little bit about the packaging for the release. The Limited Edition SteelBook is a beautifully embossed presentation, but with a minimal design on the front and back featuring images of FBI Special Agent Fox Mulder and FBI Special Agent Dana Scully. The front has a border which looks pretty cool and makes the SteelBook look pretty chunky. Inside, the case is backed with a still featuring the two FBI agents which is a nice little touch.

The two films that were spun-off from the show are wildly different stories. The X Files: Fight The Future, which was the more successful of the two, acted as a standalone film between seasons 5 and 6 of the TV show. Long-time fans of the show obviously get more out of the movie as there are plenty of nods to the complex mythology of the series but the film didn't alienate first-time viewers either. The plot finds FBI Special Agent Fox Mulder and FBI Special Agent Dana Scully caught up in a government cover-up related to the mysterious black-oil that was seen several time throughout the series. After a building explodes killing several people, the agents secretly come together to prove that the explosion was part of a cover-up and try to save their jobs.

The 2008 film The X Files: I Want To Believe came some years after the end of the TV show. Instead of returning to the mythology of the show, the film was a standalone thriller with FBI Special Agent Fox Mulder and FBI Special Agent Dana Scully returning to help the FBI after a fellow agent is kidnapped. With the help of a convicted child molester Joseph ""Father Joe"" Crissman [Billy Connolly] who claims to have psychic visions, the agents are drawn into a dark and gruesome mystery. The X Files: I Want To Believe was met with mixed reactions from critics and fans upon its theatrical release. Whilst it wasn't as good as the first film, we still really enjoyed it and it was a real joy to see FBI Special Agent Fox Mulder and FBI Special Agent Dana Scully on the big screen again after all these years.

The key to The X-Files has always been the dynamic between lead actors David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson. In both of the films the two actors give superb performances giving fans the chemistry they loved in the show. Of course The X Files: Fight the Future was down between seasons but the chemistry is still there in The X Files: I Want To Believe with David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson sparking together on-screen. Fans revisiting The X Files: Fight The Future will find a lot of joy in revisiting some of the series shadier characters who pop up throughout including the Well-Manicured Man [John Neville] and of course the Cigarette Smoking Man [William B. Davis].

Blu-ray Video Quality  The X Files: Fight The Future [1998] is brought to this particular Blu-ray and it features a really nicely rendered 1080p transfer, in the film's original aspect ratio of 2.40:1. The film is extremely dark and features very few shots filmed in full sunlight. Fight the Future was filmed in accordance to the look and feel of the ""X Files"" television show, only with a significant upgrade in film stock as well as a little more forethought given to the overall composition of each scene. The film is a difficult one to pin down. To be sure, this is an excellent transfer devoid of artificial digital picture artefacts like noise or edge enhancement, but it is a rather dreary looking film. Shadow detail is excellent throughout the presentation and black levels are rock solid. Grain is clearly visible as well, albeit in a natural and non-intrusive way. Detail is, at times, lacking, but I feel that this is an intentional side effect of the dark filming conditions. Given the intended look of the film, this Blu-ray presentation accurately delivers the experience that the makers of Fight The Future had intended. It's not demo worthy, but it's accurate. Please Note: Playback Region B/2: This only applies to the PAL DVD enclosed. This will not play on most Blu-ray players sold in North America, Central America, South America, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. Learn more about Blu-ray region specifications.

Blu-ray Video Quality  The X Files: I Want To Believe [1998] on this particular Blu-ray is a faithful reproduction of the film that was shown in cinemas. The film was shot with both 35mm film as well as high definition video cameras and there are occasions where the transitions from film to video are apparent. I noticed instances of banding during several of the night-time scenes in shots where intense lights pierce through the darkness. It occurs consistently throughout the film and was also presented theatrically. So, the transfer isn't at fault in this case. On the bright side, edge enhancement and noise is non-existent. In fact, digital annoyances are never a problem in the film. Contrast is also excellent and the film displays tremendous levels of shadow detail. One other issue that is worth noting lies in the style of photography present in the film. There's a lot of handheld camera being used in the outdoor scenes of The X Files: I Want to Believe and that often gives the picture an out-of-focus appearance. There is very little depth of field to this film; the focus pullers must have had a hell of a time keeping some of the longer shots in focus while the camera panned between characters. Naturally, this isn't the fault of this Blu-ray encode, but it is worth noting for those who find such stylistic choices bothersome.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  The X Files: Fight The Future has an exceptional 5.1 DTS HD Master Audio soundtrack. The film is both very voice driven as well as action packed and this lossless track does an outstanding job of handling the highs and lows of the presentation. Dialogue is expertly rendered; even scenes with loads of background noise allow for the dialogue to come through clearly. Action scenes are exciting and create a visceral sonic experience. Helicopters race overhead while car tires squeal and the entire experience is delivered with an abundance of directional effects and nice bass extension. Mark Snow's unique score is also placed perfectly within the overall mix. It's as effective a source of drama and tension within the film as any sound effect. The X Files: Fight the Future is a huge leap in sound design over what the  ""X Files"" viewers have experienced with the show's television broadcasts. This fantastic sonic experience elevates The X Files: Fight The Future to the realm of true reference upgraded audio.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  The X Files: I Want To Believe [1998] arrives on Blu-ray with an impressive 5.1 DTS HD-Master Audio soundtrack that does an eloquent job of helping to build and sustain the film's chill-factor. Unlike its predecessor, The X Files: I Want to Believe is a mostly dialogue-driven film that values expository conversation over explosions and fireworks. There are a few scenes that cranks up the decibel levels in your home theatre set up, but they are few and far between. The majority of the film centres on the conversations, and, as such, this soundtrack was tasked with being sure that every last syllable is perfectly presented. In that respect, it succeeds wildly. As with the first film, Mark Snow's outstanding musical score is well preserved and adds its own creepy element to what transpires on screen. The X Files: I Want To Believe features a high quality audio soundtrack that, while low on the excitement factor, still maintains enough atmosphere and ambiance to effectively serve the story.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras: 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment delivers again a huge number of Blu-ray Special Features on the Blu-ray disc edition, which there pretty much something for everyone. As with The X Files: Fight The Future and I Want To Believe, I really enjoyed the picture-in-picture commentary as it offers fresh perspectives on the film from the creative team behind its creation. The X Files: I Want To Believe has a special and very unique feature that intrigued me beyond anything else on the set, however: The ""X Files Complete Interactive Timeline"" is an outstanding extra that gives the viewer the option of selecting events from the series and viewing clips that illustrate the franchise's mythology. It's a whole lot of fun to play around with and could be quite informative to those not familiar with the original ""X Files"" TV series. 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment has also included a special feature that is frequently begged for by fans of supplements: The film's isolated musical score track. It's a great track and fans of Mark Snow are going to be thrilled. What remains are a truckload of features, presented in high definition, that detail the film's production. It's all pretty sold stuff, but none of it measures up to the excellence of the Interactive Timeline. But because there is a vast amount of Extras, sadly I am not going to give individual details on the Extras. If you want to know more details, then you will have to go and look on individual internet web sites. Enjoy!

Finally, this UK Special Limited Edition SteelBook release is a must-have for fans of The X-Files. Whilst the two films may vary in quality, we love both of them and like that they each try to do something different. Hopefully this release will finally pave the way for the full series to be granted a Blu-ray release, which is something weve been waiting on for years. Theres talk at the moment of a third X-Files film with Gillian Anderson recently appealing to fans to campaign for it. The shows creator Chris Carter has promised a new film would return to the extra-terrestrial mythology and we have our fingers crossed it will happen? Unfortunately, The X Files: I Want To Believe is a bit of a let-down for us fans of the TV show, as it eschews the popular alien invasion mythology in favour of a more generic plot that doesn't help to resolve any of the unanswered questions from the show's finale. Both films have been given the golden treatment from 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment; featuring outstanding video and reference-grade audio. Supplements are also well conceived while offering solid entertainment value along with a high level of great behind the scenes information. I hope that the powers that be at 20th Century Fox will budget for a final ""X Files"" film that can tie up all the loose ends from the series. As it stands now, the show is missing its big finale. So all in all this is brilliant package and what makes this package stands out, the fact that the UK has the Special Limited Edition SteelBook, which is so beautiful to look at and to feel, especially the embossed front cover. Highly Recommended!

Come on, Chris Carter, as a huge fan I expected that this WOULD tie up loose ends.  I saw you in an interview discussing this movie, and you answered a question that a member of the audience had, which was.....does the movie explain what happened to Scully's baby....and tie up that loose end.  You response led us to believe, YES, when in fact the opposite is true!

I read a few reviews before buying this.  I Wanted to Believe, that they were wrong!  Well, they weren't, this is a horrible excuse for an X-Files movie.  I don't know what else to say.",1410307200,,714,4.438461538461539

3489355,2,B001BCO8XQ,"Xfiles fans will want to watch it no matter how many stars I give it but it was like a really long drawn out episode.  Not even a long drawn out conspiracy episode, a long drawn out filler episode.  Meh.",1406505600,,203,4.05

3489358,3,B001BCO8XQ,"As a fan of the series, I was glad to see a second movie.  For the rental price (reduced thanks to my Amazon Prime membership) it was okay.  I won't speak too much on the plot, but the film plays out like a longer episode with only one or two gruesome surprises.  It largely drops the mythology that wrapped up the series, although tries to explain some of those story elements away in a rather feeble fashion. It explores new aspects of our favorite characters, but I was not at all happy with Scully's portrayal in this film, which starts off strong but rapidly devolves to weak simpering.  All things considered, if you're looking for a decent popcorn movie starring some old favorites, rent it.  Just don't expect to be blown away.",1405641600,,735,4.537878787878788
3489359,3,B001BCO8XQ,Great to see Scully and Mulder together again but this movie is missing something. Maybe it lacked some heart and sole that made most X-files episodes and the other movie so special. Maybe it was the storyline not quite up to the level of an X-files move but its still worth watching even if not the biggest fan of the show.,1405641600,,324,4.327868852459017

3489363,5,B001BCO8XQ,"While I was disappointed with the final episode, the entire series was totally engaging.  I wanted more, more Fox and Skully!  I was so pleased with the movie, but still left wanting more......I believe!",1403136000,,203,4.9411764705882355

3489366,5,B001BCO8XQ,"Still a great tv series comes on fri night and Sunday night on the SYFy. Channel and this is one of the last of the movie genders.
If you don't buy it you can always watch it by renting it and not sure if you can watch it online @ amazon.com.
If you are a PRIME MEMBER you pay nothing.

I was entranced with this movie and I highly recommend it!!!

The fundamental strength of The X-Files was always the heartfelt relationship between Scully & Mulder. Whether the episode dealt with either a ""monster-of-the-week"" or the ""Mythology,"" we always watched because we wanted to see Scully - I mean, Scully & Mulder. The plot was always secondary to Scully... and Mulder, of course.

Well, ""I Want to Believe"" is about Scully, is about Mulder, and it's about Scully & Mulder. This film gives us a peek into their (rather complicated) relationship ten years after the show ended. Simple as that.

Plus, here's the economic reality: a ""Mythology"" movie would have been much more expensive to make. Therefore, FOX may not have greenlighted the picture at all (esp. ten years after X-Files went off the air).So we got the movie Chris Carter could get made.

It's a good movie: suspenseful, funny, intelligent, and... Scully was in it (watch for the bikini scene!). Isn't that enough?",1388448000,,1042,4.971264367816092

The whole story seemed like a hastily churned out first draft of a story, not a polished final draft.  I thought maybe the extended cut of the film might seem more cohesive, but no, it was just more of the same meandering dribble.  Silly of me to think Carter would want to try and do a great job in order to redeem himself from the horrible way he ended the X-Files series.",1384646400,,464,4.310344827586207
3489386,1,B001BCO8XQ,"Well, unless you are a cult fan of X-file, it's totally disappointing.
Story seems like that of a cheap graphic novel, the sequences of events are created such a way that any logical conclusion is hard to follow. I mean, I understand this is X-file and we have to suspend some judgments. Yet, a lot of the scenes simply don't make sense in terms of time and plausibility. The way Skully keeps trying to express her doubts with silly sentences resembling of tracks of rationality, how all good guys are saved in the end, how a guy of obviously dubious look and background let off free after apprehension at the hospital, and how the director simply skipped the necessary requirement to create a time relevant transition between those scenes and events, etc, are beyond me.
I cannot believe I wasted so much of the time. But I have to believe in the end, my watch does not lie. I did waste almost two hrs watching it. Hope you won't.",1381795200,,931,4.514792899408284

3489389,1,B001BCO8XQ,"I love the X-Files. Watched them originally and I have the four Mythology sets. Fox and Scully were a fantastic team. When I watch them again I feel like you could go back at any time and freeze frame and any scene with Gillian could be made into an iconic poster. I think her acting was poetic and David, with a Masters in English, was also poetic. The whole show and all the actors were incredibly good. That said, I could not believe (I want to Believe.); I could not believe how bad this movie was. Every plot twist and every character was a cliche. The couple of scenes where our two stars were pretending intimacy were cringe worthy. They are more like a brother and sister than lovers. They are middle age now. A better plot would have been that they were dropping their kids off at college and found a murder or mystery, not this ""Saw"" rip off. The only thing I can think of is that they were so tired of fans wanting them to get together that they thought they would make the worst movie they possible could and wash their hands with the X-Files.",1377648000,,1055,4.306532663316583

I've seen the whole series of the X-Files, including all 9 seasons, and every movie made to the unique series that I love but this movie was bad. Controversy and contradiction make for a good movie or show, but this movie was so disappointing in several aspects. No offense to Xzibit, but I would have preferred if the directors would have hired an actor of more credibility than a rapper. I don't think this was the right movie for Amanda Peet either, not trying to say she is a bad actor, just not the right taste for her. And I'm to believe that Mulder hasn't seen Scully since they had to depart away from the feds and the government at the end of the series; come on, their love for each other was too strong. The movie could have centered on something else besides weird Russian sergeants acting like Doctor Frankenstein. I give two stars out of previous respect, but I'm sad to say this movie was off track, and I will not consider it a part of the X-Files for this reason or should I say reasons.

Their combination and chemistry of these two very different people is entirely unique and is an important reason why this show skyrocketed.

I figure I better at least MENTION the actual movie.  OK, back to the ""3 disc special edition"".  I am old enough to remember All Things must Pass by George Harrison.

The have gone in different directions but have been brought together again to investigate a case about a priest & his involvement with a missing FBI Agent. The writing is still top notch & has a element of suspense. Bottom Line- yes, buy it, very good movie & i have seen where they have both X Files movie in one case",1366588800,,582,3.982905982905983
3489410,2,B001BCO8XQ,"I honestly decided to watch this film (several years after it's initial release) simply because I had the chance to listen to Mark Snow's music from the film and truly enjoyed it.  Shame that the same can't be said for the film.  The two positives: Snow's beautiful and haunting orchestral music, and the chilly realism of the winter settings (the frosty steam of breath, the crunch of snow, the frigid FBI agents poking their way across the lake, etc.)  Visuals and music were brilliant.

But the story?  It seemed like half catholic-bashing, and half-ridiculous-organ-snatching silliness with a tremendously anti-climatic ending.  And the Mulder/Scully interaction just seemed so stale.  After all this time, they just sort of semi-live together, they still don't agree on the supernatural phenomena, and Scully seems disinterested in this case throughout most of the film.  This was the best they could come up with?

I'm no Roman Catholic, but it really bothers me when all Hollywood is capable of portraying is Catholics as either molesters or insensitive prudes that don't approve of using cutting-edge stem cell research, as seen in the film.  Scully's skepticism gets tiring after awhile, although her bitterness in questioning God did seem to reflect a shade of C.S. Lewis from 'Mere Christianity', as one who was ""angry at God for not existing.""  But her interest in the sick child seemed to preoccupy her character throughout the film, leaving her as little more than just a distracting side-character as everyone else is after the body organ snatchers.

And Scully doing her research with Google?  Seriously?  I'm no medical doctor, but don't they have tomes of medical resources online that they'd go to first before just googling?  And Skinner (his role in the film just seemed unnecessary) making the remark about ""googling"" and address made me think that the search engine was included in the film not as much for it's usefulness, but instead just as a commercialism vehicle ala Zod and the Coke sign...

This was a dud.  Dry and dissatisfying, but the chilly visuals were good, and the music exceptional.  Check out the soundtrack and skip this one.",1365206400,,2166,5.053521126760564

The cinematography was fine.
The directing was fine.
The editing was fine.
The score was fine.

But Chris Carter simply isn't a good writer.

He's an idea guy. And he works better when surrounded by more talented people who can filter his good ideas from the bad ones. For pro wrestling fans, he's the ""Vince Russo of sci-fi"". When left to his own devices, Carter does hammy, slapstick, corny stuff. And it shows in this movie.

Come on, a Catholic priest who moonlights as a recovering pedophile? Scully's melodramatic digs at Father Joe? The jabs at religion were infantile (this is coming from me -- a jaded Agnostic.) Even when viewed as a non-X-Files film -- it wasn't scary. Attempts at suspense fell flat. The climax felt rushed, and awkward.

Scully's arc was long, drawn-out, and lacked any sentimental punch due to the Lifetime Movie pace of the arc, and the contrived duel between her, and the Priest with big ears.

Fox is planning a release by late 2013. This is great news and I hope other series (Seinfeld, Arrested Development) will do the same.",1352678400,,140,4.6
3489440,2,B001BCO8XQ,"The X-files was always an odd show.  There was the long running story about black-oil aliens, government conspiracy, the smoking man and the like.  And there were the one-off episodes, that generally resolved within a single show--the embedded twin in the carnival was one of the most striking.  The two X-Files movies, Fight the Future and I Want To Believe, each represent one of these different streams.  The first film, Fight the Future, took up the black-oil alien story and took it much further than the TV series ever had.  Like the TV series, though, nothing much was resolved, and Mulder and Scully are left with no proof of the horrifying government conspiracy with evil aliens that has been going on for decades.  Naturally enough, fans thought that I Want To Believe would take up that storyline, since waiting years for a film isn't really the same as being delayed a week for a one-off; and the idea that a film is more significant than a single TV episode, in length and budget.  But our expectations were dashed.  Chris Carter and his crew were more dedicated to the dichotomous nature of the series than we hoped, and so the second movie was the equivalent of a one-off, only longer.  David Duchovny explained ""I think we're going back to the 'monster of the week' type feel, where if you're not an avid fan and don't understand the mythology, you can still come to it and get the movie.""  But the strategy backfired.  Most fans seem to have been disappointed at the result--I certainly was.  Granted, the story was strange, but not particularly compelling; special effects were minimal, and the whole altogether incomprehensible and slow moving.  There's a disgraced priest who is not only a pedophile, but hey, also psychic; there are mad scientists and a disembodied head; there is snow and desolate landscapes, and of course the frission between Mulder and Scully, but it just doesn't add up to anything.  Essentially the show is misnamed; we don't want to BELIEVE, we want to KNOW, and on the X Files, that will never happen.  But I think this film has driven the stake through the heart of the whole franchise; the projected third film (reputed in an interview with Chris Carter to have gone back to the alien storyline) will probably never materialize.",1351209600,,2276,4.7851662404092075

There's plenty of mushy Mulder-Scully moments for the fans, but much of it seems forced and hurried. The plot is somewhat captivating, but many episodes of the series have been more so. Unless you are an avid X-File fan with some time on your hands, this flick isn't worth watching.",1347235200,,402,5.014925373134329
3489447,4,B001BCO8XQ,"While I will always prefer the central ""alien apocalypse"" story line of the X-Files, there were plenty of great standalone episodes.  This movie definitely has that feel, plus there is more character exploration and we get to see Scully and Mulder be closer than they ever have been.  In fact, this film plays almost like an independent film in some ways, probably mostly due to the much lower budget.  While not quite as slick and polished as ""Fight the Future"", it definitely stacks up against the ""monster of the week"" episodes in the show's history.  All in all, it makes me want to see another X-Files
movie for sure - let's hope it happens soon.",1346889600,,651,4.6347826086956525

3489450,3,B001BCO8XQ,"The first thing one needs to know about this movie is not to expect much. The second thing one might need to know is that ""I Want to Know"" is not much of a movie. If you are looking for a reunion of characters, forget it. We don't even see ""Skinner""/Mitch Pillegi until the near the end of the movie. And as for the Lone Gunmen and Cigarette Man, well they got killed off in the season. Agent Dogget and that female FBI detective that was brought in near the end of the X-Files is also an no show.

The movie deals with a pedophile priest who lives with other pedophile priests in a college dorm like setting. They are to minister to each other to fight their temptations. The priest in this movie has ridiculously long hair. He looks like a real idiot. That priest is also seeing visions of kidnapped girls and so on. So Mulder and Skully use the priest to help them find a killer. And all through this movie I kept waiting for David Duchovny to look like Mulder, but all I kept noticing was how much he had aged since I had last seen him. Mulder is living with Skully. Mulder's beard also looked completely fake and glued on. As for the plot, some Russians or something are experimenting, creating two headed dogs and two headed people. All in all it never feels like an X-File, but more like an EX-File. And who thought bringing that black guy in from ""Pimp My Ride"" as an FBI Detective was a good idea? So we get mr. Pimp My Ride detective and Amanda Peet, and the latter gets killed off in the movie. This just isn't a good movie. Sure, it was great to see David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson back together, but this movie simply doesn't work on so many levels. There is no spark, no magic, there is no chemistry or camaraderie among the characters/actors. What we have are actors going through the motions in a script that never feels at all like an X-File. I give this movie a generous three stars. The movie is very flat though.",1344988800,,1936,4.304109589041096
3489451,4,B001BCO8XQ,"I have loved the X-Files since the pilot episode. I watched the entire series and adored the first movie. The first time I watched IWTB, I was disappointed because I was expecting something else, BUT the second time I saw it, I really liked it. Once I got past the fact that this plot was not about aliens or any of the alien mythology from the show (it is really a serial killer plot with a paranormal twist), then I was thoroughly entertained. I loved seeing Mulder and Scully's life as a couple and I thought that their personalities played out in a way that was true to the series.

I saw this movie as a redemption story for all of the characters. Mulder was still on his quest to make up for the fact that he couldn't save his sister as a child, and Scully was still struggling with her issues of faith. Although these two have some turmoil and their usual conflict of personalities, in the end they still have each other. I thought that theme was very sweet and in line with all things X-Files.

The plot was strange and the logic was questionable in some areas, but it came together after a while. I also liked the introduction of the other, younger agents. My only real complaint is that Skinner really only made a cameo and did not have a major role in the movie. Beside that, I liked the film as a stand alone.",1343865600,,1321,4.301204819277109

This was a good movie it might not have done well in the theatres but as a take home movie for $10 or less Its Great. The plot breaks away from the whole alien thing which was refreshing for me since even though I love the X-Files it is soley due to the characters themselves and their relationship, I'm not a big alien person and actually thought the story lines on the X-Files that dealt with the alien conspiracy was totally off the wall and got way out of hand.

Does it match the grand scope of the first film? No. But it's not that kind of epic story. It is an intimate,  peculiar story that has a continuous theme of faith about still going forward despite doubts and fighting unyieldingly into the unknown.  Which the X-Files have always been about. I would recommend for any fans of the original show. Go in with an open mind and no expectations and you will be rewarded especially by Gillian Anderson's great and poignant performance.

We also watched Star Trek TNG and that era of 35mm telecine 4:3 crap, but I didn't know what pixels were or how low cable resolution was in the early 90's. Now that they're coming out with the blu rays I am disappointed that they didn't go back to the original film and run it through modern post-processing. FOX did certainly make enough money off of the X-Files and probably accumulated enough or close to enough fans to make it feasible to do it better than TNG did. This has been listed as coming soon for a very long time and I hope that instead of it being vaporware or cheap crap that they are taking long enough to do a proper job. It seems like it would take a while to master it properly instead of some rushjob crap like what gets done for 70's movies.",1342915200,,851,4.163636363636364

For it being the last things X-Files, it didn't have a closing either, when it comes down to what has happened to dana/moulder after leaving the fbi and where are they headed now etc(the last episode had more of a closing than this imo). However for me personally, i enjoyed it just for the sake of having another 'episode' to watch. I enjoyed the series as a whole immensely, and am just sad to watch it go. I also laughed at a previous comment about feeling sorry for the actors/characters and how demented they seemed....yet after watching this i totally agree since you can really tell they've aged.

3489457,2,B001BCO8XQ,"As a long-term fan of the TV series, I'm horribly disappointed by this movie.  It's interesting that so many of the TV episodes had a fairly average plot, but the intriguing and powerful acting from guest characters, the unique way of filming, and of course the clever dialogue and wonderful chemistry between Scully and Mulder took a story that on paper was fairly plain and made it dramatic, unique, and exciting.  In this movie, it's just the opposite.  There are still a few precious gems of Scully-Mulder interaction, but everything else is just... bad.  The new FBI agents are extremely wooden and seem to be semi-incompetent.  The acting of the priest--who needs to be compelling, to show some mental torment from his visions/feelings of these crimes and from his past, to subtly draw a complex sympathy from the viewer as a 'cursed' man both horrified by and fighting against his own nature--is instead completely flat and at times even cheesy.  This can actually be said of the entire cast--no one seemed anything but one-dimensional, giving no reason to believe that they are actual human beings, or for the viewer to care or want to know more about them.  This is not aided by the dialogue; what little amount there is seems forced and unbelievable.  Even some of the discussions between Mulder and Scully just don't seem to flow naturally, or to even make sense after everything they've experienced together--and unfortunately the acting even between them sometimes seemed forced as well.  I was happy to see Director Skinner at the end, but even his introduction and presence were poorly applied.  Sadly, all of the components to make a great 'episode' (on TV... I wouldn't say the plot was worthy of a movie) were there--they were just not manifested in any artistic, compelling or human way, and their assembly as a 'story' was disjointed. It was wonderful to see the closeness between Mulder and Scully so clearly realized (finally), and I appreciated how, as with the series, so much intimacy was conveyed by subtlety and implication.  If only those brief moments weren't wedged within the rest of this mess.  It actually reminded me of a VERY poor attempt by an imposter to make a movie LIKE the X-files... as if someone broke the series into a formula and gathered many of the right pieces, but then had no idea how to weave them together with any depth, artistry, intelligence or vision.  It's sad to see the x-files end in such a bland and disheartening way... I want to believe that this movie never actually happened.  Hopefully there will be one more someday (12-2012?) that will restore the former X-files vision and end the series in an uplifting way.",1341619200,,2677,4.842105263157895

Over the years I began to lose interest with the television show, right around the time of the release of the first movie. I don't watch many of the newer episodes, i pretty much stopped watching after david duchovny left the show. I loved this movie, I don't know why i waited so long to watch it. I guess i was a bit hesitant because, although i enjoyed the first film, i didn't think it was the best. I definitely enjoy this one quite a bit more.
I thought the plot was great, it kept me interested throughout the whole movie. I thought it was very well explained. Sure it may be a bit sappy with the relationship between mulder and scully, and the side story with scully trying to save that little boy, but i loved it.

If you never watched an X-file episode or the first movie, you would never have known the real Mulder and Scully from this movie. Where is the spunky, vivacious and confident Scully? Where is the sometimes kooky but brilliant-minded Mullder? Where is their chemistry?

So we are almost a decade later, and Mulder and Scully have been ""removed"" from the FBI for the duration. Their re-enrolment is a first surprise, but there is no wow effect following!
The movie has Scully's reluctance as a subplot, augmented by her dedication to a terminally ill young boy, with no bearing on the plot. The harsh catholic hospital ruling by a inquisition-type priest has no further bearing, other than unnerving Scully all the more.
The next subplot is the visionary father Joe, a convicted paedophile priest with a remorse. So, OK, he directs the FBI to some interesting crime spots, but that's it. Apart from getting on Scully's nerves, yeah. The actual plot involvement is pretty thin ...
It seems that some modern-time Russian Dr Frankenstein, is at work in some abandoned shed. Maybe we'll learn more in a next movie? If anyone is still interested ...
There seems to be some body parts traffic going on as well...
Ah, yes, Skinner makes an appearance, after Scully presses the FBI for someone with balls. He then takes on the role of a chauffeur and sidekick for Scully, appearing, what, for five minutes total?
Finally, there is the all-pervading dark mood oozing from Mulder and Scully being an item or not, or no longer, or maybe, or what?

It was way more gruesome than a TV show, which some may like, others may hate.  It felt more like a horror film to me with all the body parts, etc.  I had hoped for some mythology, or even a good freak show.  The writing was tired, the actors were tired, and the plot was tired.

I had to watch The X-Files every week and it was the highlight of my week. It made me feel great.

Instead of going out and ruining my life, i had the experience of 10 beautiful seasons of one of the greatest shows ever.

3489474,5,B001BCO8XQ,"i didn't watch the show religiously, so i'm not an x-phile, but i watched enough to love the series, so i'm worthy of writing a review.

never saw this in the theater, but i imagine it would have had quite an impact because of the cinematography and direction. i think it was very well made, the angles, the panorama, the classic x-files low-light, the music. and, i do love this movie enough to have bought the dvd over the weekend. now, i can re-watch the scully/mulder 'love scenes' over and over and over.

i understand how true x-philes are a little disappointed that the alien conspiracy was not touched on in this film, aside from the small reference to mulder's sister. i too, would have expected that a feature x-files film would have this story line continue, BUT, the plot still followed the x-files stand-alone episodes. i do feel, however, that they should have had a more paranormal storyline than psychic phenomena--that's so common. so, maybe it wasn't x-files enough, but it was still quite enjoyable. they did do a good job of capturing the mulder-isms like the room full of newspaper clippings, sunflower seeds, the one-liners.

david and gillian reprised their characters beautifully, they fell right back into character. one or two here said that it looked like gillian was having difficulty and it showed, based on an interview she gave stating this. i didn't see that at all. she is still definitely scully, and as beautiful as ever. mulder still has the sarcastic, jokey, charm, and scully still maintains her stubborn, skeptical, scientific viewpoint, while remaining an emotional support to mulder's beliefs. at the end of the series we all know that they are 'together', so it's only natural that they would be living together in this film--yay! the film pulled out the dynamics of their relationship sticking to the subtleties of their nuances in the series, i.e. touching hands, touching with the eyes, standing close...oh, those eye touches..., without turning into a ronchy sex fest. the bedroom scene was played beautifully. you could feel their intimacy, just like it was in the series, but this time we KNOW they're doing it! it just would have been too over the top to see them actually having sex, although i think they could have still kept to the mystery of their relationship, if we just saw mulder begin to roll on top of scully, but i digress. so, this film really showed how their relationship developed since they left the bureau, but maintains some mystery...we don't what they do when they're relaxing at home, for instance. we see their relationship more fully than ever, but it's still clearly an x-files story where we never know all the details. there's always questions.

i really, really want to see a  third x-files in time for dec. 2012 that is all about alien colonization and finding out what really happened to samantha. i also want to know what happened to william. i never understood why he was given up to a farm couple who won't have a clue on how to protect him. the aliens will find william no matter where he is, he can't be hidden on a farm, isn't this obvious?

3489475,2,B001BCO8XQ,"Not utterly terrible, but close - and likely the ultimate end of the franchise. The script is bad, the story uninspired, and the acting by the leads feels curiously tired. Indeed, there is such a lack of inertia to this X-File - a creative stagnation and a laziness of plot - that it seems no one involved had any real interest in it outside of the dream of potential remuneration (and considering the justly paltry revenue this thing took in, I'd guess that dream was quashed).

When this movie appeared, ""The X-Files"" had been off air for almost six years. It had been even longer since Agents Mulder and Scully had appeared together on a regular basis, and even longer since the leads had displayed any visible interest in their roles. Having once loved the show, I lost interest when I thought I detected the actors exhaustion (for the record, that was near season six). Even so, it would have been a nice surprise to find a well-crafted picture - for the sake of nostalgia, if nothing else. But alas, the results of this offering aren't good. Duchovny and Anderson are actors who can project a natural intelligence, but here they're saddled with a hackneyed script that provides them with laughably clichd dialogue and logical gaps galore. Worse, these guys still seem tired. Time hasn't heightened their interest, and while it's lovely to see them paired up again, I wish they'd had more energy.

I used to enjoy this show, back in the day. But then time marched on, and so did I. Occasionally I'd see the actors pop up in other venues and Id smile, thinking - ""Hey, there's so and so..."" - and then I'd move on. Then this film brought the show back from the dead, briefly rekindling my interest.

The Hollywood Reporter confirms that 'Illuminate Hollywood' has been creating new 4k HD Masters of the X-Files TV series. The original unedited camera negatives are being scanned in HD and will be re-edited back into complete shows.  Special effects will have to re-created with CGI in HD.  Cutting continuities and SD Videos of the original shows will be used as reference for editing.  The bad news is that this is the new name for the company that botched the Star Trek TNG season 2 Blu-ray with DNR & other errors. CBS cancelled their contract with them after that.

----Original review----

If the original 35mm camera film elements exist there is some hope, but like ST-TNG every episode would have to be re-edited and the special effects re-created using the original 35mm films.

The first 4 seasons of the X - Files were not produced in Hi-Definition, the original camera negatives were transfered to standard definition video and the video was edited into the final shows.  Unlike classic filmed TV shows of the 1950's, 60's & 70's where in those days the final editing was done on 35mm negatives, so a Hi-Definition transfer can be made of those old shows. From mid 1980 to 1998, the camera films were directly transfered to standard definition video for editing, no edited 35mm film master exists to make a new hi-Definition transfer.

Starting with season 5 (1997) the X-Files was produced in wide screen, but even that does not mean it was in hi-Definition as it pre-dates U.S. Hi-Definition broadcasts & standards. Hi-Definition broadcasts didn't start until October 1998, and then it was not for regular TV series. The FOX network did not start Hi-Definition broadcasts until September 2004, WAY after the X-Files was out of production.

The bottom line is that unless FOX would do a major computer enhancement to scrub out the grain of the original TV series, a Blu-ray release of the X-Files TV series would not be an improvement. And based on FOX's Blu-ray releases of their 1970's feature films, they are not investing the money.

If a TV show was produced between 1980 & 1998, don't hope for a good Blu-ray release. The Classic Star Trek will always look sharper that its sequels (except for Enterprise).

Now the two X-Files theatrical movies were edited in Hi-Definition with a 35mm master negative produced.  So that is why they are on Blu-ray.",1305849600,,2397,4.891358024691358

Some fans found this story disappointing, a filler in the X-Files mythology.  What a terrible mis-perception.  The transplantation of heads onto alternate bodies is a plot snatched right out of the annals of Classic Science Fiction.

I read it first in the Barsoomian adventures of John Carter, Warlord of Mars, by Edgar Rice Burroughs.  The episode was titled Chessmen of Mars,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Chessmen-of-Mars/dp/B000O7NHJK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Chessmen of Mars</a>&nbsp;(also available on Amazon Kindle)&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Chessmen-of-Mars-by-Edgar-Rice-Burroughs-w-Active-Table-of-Contents-and-Chapter-Navigation-KINDLE-EDITION/dp/B002KQ6VVO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Chessmen of Mars by Edgar Rice Burroughs (w/ Active Table of Contents and Chapter Navigation) [KINDLE EDITION</a>].
As a long time Burroughs fan, I'd call this imitation a sincerely gratifying contemporary flattery.

Mulder's best quote I can think of from this epic, is near the end of the film,  ""What if DON'T GIVE UP really is the answer Scully?"" [!!!]  When I saw this film at the theatre , and Dr. Scully entirely invested herself in the stem cell treatment to save the life of a 10 year old patient, I wanted to stand up and cheer.  And while Father Joe's twisted fight to save his soul and that of an Altar boy he molested (now turned body-snatching-transvestite/international-criminal-mastermind), IS a bizarre counter point in true X-Files tradition, I wouldn't miss it.

To see all those nurses and nuns, alongside of Dr Scully's fellow physicians watching her, a truly exceptional human being in wonder and hope as she arrives to carry out the impossible surgery, IS to understand how each of us needs to hope.

I loved the series, especially the running storyline with Smoking Man et al. I also enjoyed many of the stand-alone tales, into which this movie fits. But even in the extended cut I find this film to be barely as good as even the most mediocre old episodes.

One of the best things about the series was its subtlety; it gave the viewer credit for intelligence, and rarely hit us over the head with gore or violence. But not here. The occasional gruesome scenes really distracted me from the main thing on display, the rekindling of the Mulder/Scully thang.

[Spoilers] So M and S do some kissing, and are shown in bed, etc. Nice for those who waited for it, but for those of us who loved the show mainly for sharp dialogue and very crafty ideas, there's little of either here. The banter is ok but not up to snuff, and who needs to see all those hacked limbs and severed heads? Just doesn't feel like what I want from the X-Folks. Which is weird, as Carter and Spotnick did all of this. Maybe they thought they needed some sensationalism to sell tickets.

Oh well, it ain't bad, and it has some strengths such as good production values, etc, but all in all I had hoped for a lot more, and a lot less.

However, the blu-ray does have a fine set of extras, especially a history of the show with many many clips and a long, in-depth summary of every episode. It would take you many days to read and see all of that, so if you're a serious fan, you'll love that a lot, and the making-of/keeping it secret docs, commentaries, etc. It's a good package, and the film got a good transfer.

If they make another movie, I hope they resurrect the old storyline, drop the blood and guts, and get on with what made the show great: quiet intelligence.",1294185600,,1748,4.346625766871166
3489486,3,B001BCO8XQ,"This isn't a bad movie in its way. It has some suspense, some creepy moments and a nice relationship between the co-stars. The problem with it is that it simply isn't X enough. There are many shows out there into which this plot could have been transplanted and it would have worked just as well. Obviously, from the reviews, the movie pleased some fans mainly because they are interested in the relationship between Scully and Mulder. If that's your principal interest, you'll probably like this. However, for those of us who are looking for a movie with some bizarre, out-of-this-world content, there's not much to get excited about. This is a straightforward thriller dealing with the boundaries of ethical medical behavior. The psychic is thrown in presumably to make it a little more outlandish, but really he adds almost nothing to the story and could easily be replaced by another plot device. Having said that, I did enjoy the special features on the making of the body parts and the gag reel. That got it an extra star.

3489487,5,B001BCO8XQ,"Much like the first theatrical outing for Mulder and Scully, this will disappoint some for what it is not, and others for what it actually is. It is very much the type of stand-alone story which used to be squeezed between the conspiracy and mythology episodes. The problem presented by the avenue chosen by Chris Carter and Frank Spotnitz is that after so many years have passed, fans aching for what The X-Files did best will be confronted by a dreary and snowy low-key and intimate story which while excellent on its own, is not what fans had anticipated.

That being said, I do believe, however, after the initial shock, and perhaps after a second viewing, fans will embrace it for Carter's courage to once again fly in the face of the powers that be and tell an often creepy stand-alone story showing how the darkness always found Mulder and Scully, and how it was having each other to lean on which helped each keep their faith. It is almost as if this is a segue to something more on the horizon. For even within the confines of a story which does not deal in the slightest manner with any of the X-Files mythology fans have hungered for, there are portents.

Beginning with both Mulder and Scully leading very different lives than those we came to know, Carter uses the darkness to bring them back together. It is a kidnapped F.B.I. Agent and a Bureau ready to forgive Mulder for his many indiscretions if only he will help work with the psychic who may or may not be genuine which starts things rolling. Scully's need to help a young boy with an incurable disease and the relationship of our favorite F.B.I. couple, even though neither works for the Bureau anymore, gets as much screen time as the premise, which is like a creepy episode rather than a feature film.

Duchovny and Anderson are still fabulous together, perhaps even more so in a somber and low-key outing such as this. The intimacy and history of the couple is what the film is about, and how faith can be restored even amidst the darkness which always found them, and sometimes kept them apart. This really plays better as a small screen episode of the show, but because we have missed Mulder and Scully for so long, it gets an A.

There are references to Mulder's sister, the alien abduction which haunted and drove him in his quest for the truth. It is a story line we thought wrapped up. Now that is unclear. Carter did say in an interview about the film that no one ever really dies for good on the show. And though the film itself has dealt in absolutely no way at all with X-Files mythology, what should show up as a background to the closing credits? Black oil, that's what. And it ain't Texas tea. It is worth seeing if only for a very touching and tender moment between Mulder and Scully near the end. It is the kind of intimate conversation which made the show better than anything else we got to watch during its long run.

The story itself might have been better as an episode of the show, and those who ventured into theatres expecting something grandiose after all this time came away wondering if it was worth the wait. Fans of the show, however, were fans because of the relationship between Fox Mulder and Dana Scully. So if you know before popping this into your DVD player that this is that type of episode, in which the case is only an excuse to bring them back to who they were, then you'll enjoy it much more. It has much more in common with episodes such as Beyond the Sea or Irresistible, than say, Nesei and 731. If you adore Mulder and Scully, and enjoy the stand alone episodes of the show as much as the mythology arc entries, this one is excellent.",1282521600,,3652,4.461077844311378

Unlike the last X-Files movie (and most of the X-Files episodes), I Want to Believe steps away from the government conspiracy mega-plotline and instead focuses on the day-to-day lives of Mulder and Scully and the challenges they have to overcome in their personal and professional lives, set against the backdrop of a missing FBI agent and a seemingly clairvoyant pedophiliac priest.

It deserves a quality collector's edition and the DVD release just fell short.  The storage capacity of Blu Ray can be leveraged to fit the series onto a reasonable number of discs (ie, less than 60+) and would give Fox a chance to not botch the quality control (just google around a bit, of the DVDs in the collector's edition some would invariably fail out of the box as plenty of people can attest.)

If you have actually watched the X-Files series and loved it like me how have you forgotten that every single episode was not alien or arc story based? I would say atleast 40% of the series was comprised of standalone episodes.

The first X-Files movie was an arc storyline movie so it would only make sense the second would not be. I loved seeing Mulder and Scully again and I thought it was great to see them assuming their original POV during the series. Scully the skeptic and Mulder the believer. I won't put any spoilers about the movie but will only say that I'm pretty sure I understood the storyline. Unless I'm delusional and only convinced myself I did.

This movie in my opinion was not neccesarily what the fans WANTED to see but I think it was something we needed to see and imo it was a setup to give us an idea of who Scully and Mulder are now and to show them ultimately still committed to eachother so that when the 3rd and imo final movie is made they can commit all of that time to finishing this story NOT giving us backstory on what M&S have been up to the last 10 years.

But you will also find that Skinner turns up only in the last fifteen minutes (removing a much-needed dramatic tension and diversion), and that Scully has been made more edgy, rude, and suspicious. The Scully I recall from the TV series was thoughtful as well as compassionate, balanced as well as committed to reason, a sensible spar with Muldur's (at times) delusions. But this is a more shrill Scully, judgmental and at times even unpleasant. But why? It is hard to understand why she has been 'transformed' and we are not made to care.

Another thing that annoyed me, which bugged me in the series by the way, is that the plot always seems to require either Mulder or Scully getting their butt kicked and having to be rescued by the other.  The lack of imagination and ideas in Hollywood these days is astounding.  Where has all the creativity gone?",1260316800,,739,4.462686567164179

I know why some X-Files fans wanted more from this movie, but I think it was an amazing introduction and would recommend it anyone who has or has not seen the x-files!

This movie is just awesome and this coming from someone who less than a year ago had never seen x-files, but has not seen every episode out there!",1259971200,,498,3.9207920792079207
3489506,4,B001BCO8XQ,"I have been a fan of the X-Files from way back.  Loved the series and the characters . . .and yes, I own all nine seasons.  I was thrilled to see Mulder and Scully back in action in I Want To Believe (an oft used phrase in the series and the sentence written on Mulder's flying saucer poster).  I saw this in the theatre twice and own the DVD.  The story has been well-covered in the other reviews, so I won't rehash it, but I was very impressed with this entry, especially because it did not play out in such a way that ensured box office success.  It's a dark, creepy thriller that does not rely on special effects, shoot-outs, or snide one-liners.  The script is literate and thoughtful debate on faith, moral and practical applications in the medical profession, and about two people still trying to connect and understand each other, despite the fact they have known a greater intimacy than any other television couple/duo.  I loved that the film moved away from the series' alien mythology to explore the kind of story the show was famous for . . .the self-contained story with supernatural overtones.  The film never betrays the series by pretending certain events didn't happen, nor does Mulder or Scully rejoin the FBI.  It stays true to how the series ended and what became of the characters (neither are agents anymore).  As Roger Ebert observed, there are guns present, but no one is shot.  There are special effects, none spectacular or show-stopping (as in Fight the Future), but exist to serve the story powerfully.  The make-up effects at the end are a creep-out!  This is the kind of thriller Hollywood used to have the balls to make.  The film serves as a great stepping stone to re-engage Mulder and Scully in future stories, as I understand, are in the works.  Nice supporting performances from Amanda Peet and Mitch Pileggi.  I LOVED Billy Connoly as the very morally compromised priest, receiving psychic visions of the murder victims.  He was overlooked at awards time for a performance that was understated and mysterious, a lesser actor would have taken it over the top.  As a pedophile priest, he never makes excuses for his actions, but comes close to dare i say it . . .sympathy.

The X-Files I Want To Believe brings the series back to form in a way that allowed audiences to either love it or hate it.  Chris Carter did not make any compromises to his vision . . sve of course the extended version which allows for more gore than the PG-13 version as well as a few character bits(the extended is better).  Bravo to him.  And I hope this means a return to the big screen for future outings, despite the film's mediocre box office.  Watch with an open mind away from the hype and expectations.

This movie has all the ""politically correct"" eggs in one basket: anti-George Bush, anti-God, anti-Catholic, pro-stem cell research, etc. As for the big ""mystery"", why bother seeing this when you can see the same ho-hum tedium in any of the endless ""CSI -"" incarnations on TV. Nothing's more boring than medical dramas and for some reason a big chunk of this film is taken up with Scully's physician angst.

3489511,4,B001BCO8XQ,"The film itself was pretty good.  Though I sincerely hope they finish the story of the series with a third movie.

But, on a spiritual note, this was an interesting idea.

Scully, who is now working in a hospital, is contacted by the FBI in hopes that she can help them find Agent Mulder, as they need his help on a case involving a missing agent.

Enter Father Joseph Crissman, played here by the wonderful Billy Connolly (Boondock Saints, The Last Samurai). He is a disgraced former Catholic priest who left the church because he was caught performing pedophilac acts with choirboys. It seems that Father Joseph has been receiving visions from God about the whereabouts of the missing agent.

Mulder, of course, looks at this with the usual cynicism he has for so-called psychics.  Scully, who was raised Catholic, refuses to believe that God would send visions to someone who had done something so horrible and had disgraced the Church in the process.

But eventually both are convinced as to the legitimacy of Father Joseph's visions.

This was wonderfully done, especially when it is revealed that the former priest has more of a connection with this case then he realizes.",1256428800,,1178,4.825870646766169
3489512,3,B001BCO8XQ,"I am an old school X-phile. I liked the alien story-arc (even if it was played out repeatedly, like Scully always arriving seconds later after something cool happened to Mulder), but what really drew me to the series was the ""freak of the week"" (FOTW) episodes like ""Darkness Falls"" and ""Humbug"". Each one was different and exciting.

This movie is a pretty decent attempt at recapturing this concept. I'm not sure if they wanted to do a FOTW to gauge public response to a series of X-Files movies or they just wanted to dig up the series and see if it still had any life in it for a future television project. It did a great job of dragging out that old Mulder-Scully chemistry, that intellectual reparte that we all had known and loved about the original series.

While this movie DOES close some story-lines (the whereabouts of their son, what they were up to after the series ended, etc.), it opens new questions, and most certainly to X File fans: Will they finish the Alien-insurrection Story?

Main drawback: I didn't care for either Xibit or Amanda Peet's characters. It's not a shot against either as an actor, but the character writing was extremely contrived and telegraphed: you could see that they were trying to fit into the X Files story instead of just being FBI agents on an investigation. This could have been solved by one character, not two, filling in the gaps. This would have been a great place to plug in Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) and make him a central character (this would have been hugely satisfying).",1256256000,,1527,4.669144981412639

3489515,3,B001BCO8XQ,"The good news is that the government conspiracy that got so silly the last two season is gone, as is Doggett and super soldiers. The conspiracy got so mangled and convoluted that it hurt the series. In fact, if the X-files had ended with the beautiful and cathartic ""Closure"" in season 7(the last good thing Carter wrote), this movie might have been amazing. Only 3 episodes that season after closure aired were any good, and maybe 3 more the next two seasons were worth anything.

If only Mulder hadn't ""died"" which killed the series forever... That episode should have been titled Jump the Shark, but not the shameful episode that did have that name the next season.

The bad news is Chris Carter(along with the equally uneven Frank Spotnitz) wrote this. His writing output for season 8 and 9 as well as Millennium season 3 was for the most part substandard and this movie continues that tradition. Yes, he created a great series, but unlike a Matt Groening, Chris Carter doesn't know when to butt out and let real writers have at it. I think of Chris Carter somewhat like a Robert Jordan, both created a very interesting premise, and both somehow did everything they could to ruin it.

Another amazing fact to note, neither Mulder nor Scully made an appearance in the third biggest role of the series: the hospital bed. Granted, it made a cameo, but it was not the same without Mulder or Scully laying in it. Seriously, the hospital bed with one of the two major characters in it, made more appearances than the cancer man, skinner, or krycek combined.

What was the purpose of the side story with the sick boy? Is Scully working for the aliens by propping up the number of slaves? It would seem the humane thing to do would be to let him die.

It is not that this is a terrible movie, it is that it is a below average episode. While I was watching this, I couldn't help but start wishing that Darin Morgan had written the movie instead. After all, the best, most creative, most interesting, most engaging, and most applauded episodes were written by Mr. Morgan, not Chris Carter. In fact the only marginal episode Morgan wrote was the Jose Chung episode for Millennium(it wasn't bad, it just didn't fit into the much darker Millennium series). If there are going to be any more non-conspiracy movies, please enlist Morgan to write it.

If you are a fan, you probably have already watched it, but I can't imagine such a lackluster effort convincing newcomers to go back and watch the series nor even understand the issues between Mulder, Scully and the FBI. It added nothing to the series, revealed nothing new, presenting nothing interesting, so what is the point of this?

This movie is really a 2 star movie when judged as a episode, maybe 4 stars when judged against the crap Hollywood has been churning out the past few years, so it gets a three. It was nice to see Mulder and Scully together again and that is worth a star.",1254700800,,2932,4.583969465648855

It is impossible to separate this film from the show before it. This film is for fans of the show, but more importantly, fans of the characters Chris Carter created all those years ago. When it comes right down to it, this is a way for fans to re-connect with characters they love and see them off in a surprisingly positive way. While the resolution of the story itself is gloomy, it is the resolution of the characters for which this film dazzles and for which I, as a fan, am grateful for getting to see. Thanks Chris Carter.

If your coming into the X-Files for the first time, this is NOT the place to start.

If you are a casual fan looking for a re-visit, this will probably not satisfy.

If you are a solid fan of the old show and the characters within, this is definitely the way to end it.",1253836800,,886,4.255952380952381

3489519,4,B001BCO8XQ,"If you're an ""X Files"" fan, this movie will not disappoint you . . . unless you expect any of the following to be featured:

1) aliens;
2) government conspiracy;
3) Robert Patrick (a.k.a. Special Agent John Doggett);
4) tech-laden special effects;
5) a resurrected CGB Spender (the cigarette smoking man);
6) supersoldiers.

This movie plays much like a self-contained episode of ""The X Files,"" the kind where Mulder and Scully investigate strange goings-on in some part of the United States.  There's no alien conspiracy plotline or anything like that, so don't get your hopes up in that regard.  What you will get from this movie is further development of the Mulder-Scully relationship, explorations of faith in its various forms and, of course, the investigation of an unusual mystery.

Overall, an enjoyable motion-picture experience with a few issues (POSSIBLE SPOILERS):

1) The FBI knows where Dana Scully is but can't pinpoint Fox Mulder's whereabouts.  (This could be because he's hidden inside for a decade, but why not just follow Scully home and poke around, put a sonic ear on the windows of the house or something?)
2) A convicted child-molesting priest convinces the FBI he has visions and can find bodies . . . and the FBI not only believes him but gives him its full support.
3) Somewhat confusing climax that goes unexplained, but really shouldn't.  A brief discussion between Mulder and Skinner could have dispelled any confusion at the end.
4) Dana Scully performs a web search on ""stem cell therapy"" and then conducts a stem-cell operation within days of the search.  Makes it look as though she boned up on radical forms of treatment via the Internet and then performed major surgery with what she learned.
5) The FBI's need for Mulder on their case is weak.  Seems like any FBI agent worth his or her salt would have sufficed.
6) Complex surgery AND recovery in a breezy, cold warehouse.
7) What's with all the Russians?

All in all, an entertaining movie that gave this ""X Files"" fan more of what he wanted: Fox Mulder, Dana Scully, Skinner, a snowy setting and a freaky mystery to solve.",1252886400,,2113,4.841666666666667

I bought the Ultimate Phile Edition DVD (amazing extras, by the way) as well as this single disc.  The second movie, I Want To Believe, takes place ""in real time,"" 6 years after the series has ended.  Anderson and Duchovny both give outstanding performances that stay absolutely true to how these characters have developed.  Scully has grown quite a bit since the series ended, and Anderson really shines in portraying her emotional state throughout.  Long-term fans of this show will love catching up with their favorite agents; but the movie does not isolate those who are new to the series. Mark Snow's score is emotionally heartwrenching and you will want to buy the soundtrack after seeing the film.  It's important to understand that IWTB is very different from the first X-Files movie, Fight the Future.  This is not an alien or government conspiracy movie. Action and explosions are not the focus of this movie. I Want To Believe is a story about the characters, Mulder and Scully, where they've been for the past 6 years, how they've matured, and how they are affected by their past lives slowly creeping into the one they've settled into. Their story is told and driven by the plot, but the action of the plot does not become the overwhelming factor.

At it's core, this film is about hope and fighting for that hope. Do you believe? Can you believe? Do you want to? Everytime I see the film I see more than I did the time before. A scene can be interpreted in a whole new light. Meaning is hidden in layers, whereas in ""Fight the Future"", it was largely on top. So look deeper, past the darkness.

What I found was an absolutely hilarious quasi-parody - the worst Hollywood schlock I've seen in ages.  The script must have been written by a team of earnest middle-schoolers and then heavily edited by someone for whom English is only a fourth or fifth language.  The camerawork is mind-numbingly unimaginative and the acting of the two principals makes ""wooden"" seem like a term of praise in comparison.  Even the bad guys speak terrible Russian - clearly no one had bothered to ask a real Russian speaker for any guidance here.

In short, everything is wrong with this movie.  It would be a perfect and amusing parody if only someone would cut it down to about six minutes.  As it is, it drags on for a great deal too long for anyone's good.

The film is set in West Virginia, mostly in remote rural areas, during the deep winter. There's a lot of snowfall, bodies/body parts are found in frozen lakes, and a snow plow is driven by an evil dude as he commits evil deeds. Director and co-writer Chris Carter artfully makes the snow a key character, alongside Mulder (David Duchovney) and Scully (Gillian Anderson).

I knew very little about the X Files before watching this film. I watched a few television episodes a long time ago. From other reviews I have gathered that this was designed to be a ""stand-alone."" That's what it was for me.

Carter wanted to make the movie like a standalone episode, and I think he succeeded a little too well. It feels to me exactly like a decent but not especially memorable standalone episode, and the feature-length run-time does cause the story to drag from time to time. The real highlight to this movie is the character moments between Mulder and Scully, which are as good as they always were in the show, although I'm still confused about their relationship when the movie starts- were they separated for a while, or do they live together in that house?

Basically, if you look at this movie as a small little epilogue to the series, it works well enough. I can't imagine why Carter or anyone else working on the movie thought it would succeed in relaunching the X-Files into the public's consciousness and rejuvenate the franchise, but I recommend fans checking it out if you're curious what Mulder and Scully have been up to in the last six years since we saw them.",1247097600,,1117,4.608040201005025
3489531,4,B001BCO8XQ,"I had mixed feelings about this. I went in to see it seeking inspiration for my current novel-in-progress (based on the original storyline of the show) and didn't quite get what I expected. The icon of the 90's: I was six years old when the show came out, but I've been a die-hard fan since 1997, which sparked my passion for writing (I miss those years so much!). Having read a review that described the plot as more of a love story with a creepy classic thriller sub-plot, I was touched by the film as a whole; my only real disappointment was that it lacked the vibes that the show had, and it failed to tie into the original story (save for one or two references to the trial at the series finale). The plot of the psychic priest seemed very forced and I was very confused (and yet amused) by the countless subtleties to current events. As a romance and a thriller this film was a great success: the suspense was epically hair-raising, the best element being the metaphor of ""the Darkness."" As a writer I felt drawn to that, like I understood exactly what it meant. A very clever and powerful tactic for intensifying the passion between the two protagonists. The final line made me melt internally and brought me near tears: a brave statement in a beautifully flawed relationship. In that sense I walked out of the theatre with an epiphany of how to amp up the romance in my novel (again, not quite what I wanted).
As a whole, a great stand-alone tale of an epic sci-fi romance. In terms of the classic mythology of the show, however, this one falls short. The first film had a very crafty touch, being a bridge between the 5th and 6th seasons. Being twenty-one years old now I understand the story better, and I would've given this one a two thumbs up if it weren't for its lacking in ties to the show.

It is a fitting end (possibly) to one of the best Sci-Fi franchises ever. Duchovny and Anderson still have it.  They are still Mulder and Scully.  It screams of the TV show more than the original big screener did and I loved the original movie.  Sit back and enjoy this.

3489534,2,B001BCO8XQ,"Went into the movie with an open mind and sentimentality. Came away completely disappointed and saddened that this was the exit this great show has gotten. The movie seems just an excuse to have the audience see Mulder and Scully again. I did, but I wanted a story too. There was no suspense. The scenes were connected but it seemed the parts were better than the whole. A real let down since the viral marketing [phony Werewolf pictures on the internet etal], secrecy about the movie and other hype couldn't help but work against the movie. The hype now seems more of ploy to take advantage of the audience and its connection to the series, knowing the movie was far weaker than the anticipation. Didnt expect it to be the greatest movie ever, but wished it would have been at least tense. According to many interviews before it was released, this was supposed to be just the first of X-Files movies to be made. Guess that is out of the question now.",1246233600,,951,4.534883720930233
3489535,5,B001BCO8XQ,"The X-files series had a few story arcs that were bigger than life that lend themselves nicely to the giant screen: aliens taking over the earth etc.  In effect, the first movie, Fight the Future, was exactly about one of these larger than life story arcs.

This second installment was something else.  Halfway through this movie I was perplexed and asked myself, ""Why did Chris Carter make a movie about this???""  I kept watching and continously told myself that this was Chris Carter and that he was probably trying to tell us something like a Kubrick.

By the end of the movie I had figured out a few lessons that Carter was trying to share with us.  They're the same lessons that started out with the very first X-files episode:

-- THE STRUGGLE BETWEEN FAITH AND SCIENCE
-- THE BALANCE BETWEEN FRIENDSHIP AND LOVE and RELATIONSHIPS

Carter weaves things nicely to have us ask hard questions: at what point does science take us down grotesque and painful roads?
- When does ethical become unethical
- When is it better to stop trying and let God take it from there?

Additionally, the movie challenges us: people don't always live happily ever after like TV makes us think that they do.

The movie tells its story and makes its points in a decidedly X-filish way, with a splash of gore, some suspense, fighting egos at the FBI. Overall, we see Moulder and Scully and we also get to see Skinner but don't expect any of the classic standby actors like Cigarette smoking man or any others.

Overall, I have to admit that this was not my favorite X-file (this was one of the filler episodes in between the good conspiracy story arc episodes!).  It sought to give the characters too much depth - it made them too human and this came at the expense of a bigger than life plot...not to mention that it's a bit difficult to add too much dimension to Moulder and Scully.  I remember once that Gillian Anderson directed an episode of the X-files where she had to face her past where she had an affair with one of her professors - it's a deeper look at Scully character.  Although that episode was well done, to me it was an interesting excursion ...This movie reminds me solidly of that episode.....exploring the deeper relationships between Moulder and Scully and exploring more deeply the battle between Science and Faith. Don't get me wrong, the script for ""I Want to Believe"" is worthy of a movie but I would just prefer Moulder and Scully fighting to save the world from giant government super conspiracies - and just lightly sprinkling the deeper Philosophy into the script vs making the entire movie about the Philsophy set against the backdrop of what appears to be a very mundane kidnapping case (although Carter ties things up very nicely at the end and answers my question of ""What was Carter trying to tell me."")...only thing is....HE HAD ALREADY TAUGHT ME THOSE LESSONS.

It gets Five Stars because it was classic Xfiles in the tradition of the Xfiles.  I would go so far as to say that the story was worthy of an Oscar nomination for what it was trying to tell us but there is no way it would ever be considered - you have to get through the gore and all the other metaphysical stuff to get to the meat of Lessons....and there are other venues to make similar points in more digestible formats.  Definitely worth watching.  I do want to believe....AND, I though would've preferred something that involved a Conspiracy, Aliens, Cigarette Smoking Man.

Overall, I felt the first movie migth have been too much X files Action  where this movie was very much X Files Philosophy.  Maybe they can find balance at some point with these movies.",1246147200,,3644,4.627329192546584
3489536,1,B001BCO8XQ,"I was only a casual viewer of the show, and I felt the first movie was pretty good. Sadly, this movie lives up to the standard of neither.

While the original movie upped the action and spectacle far above the level of the TV show, this movie seemed tired and lacked any kind of suspense or pazzaz. So much so I was left wondering why this wasn't released as a TV movie and not a theatrical feature.

Overall, the performances were fine, but the plot would have worked better had they taken it further. As is, it belonged strictly in the filler episode category. We also have to sit through a very dull subplot involving (now Dr.)Skully's attempt at saving a terminally ill boy's life; no doubt intended to be the heart of the movie which instead serves to distract. Very little action, unrealized plot and wasted opputunity to revive a franchise with promise and milage.

I hope another movie is made, but judging by the poor box office (why did they release this a week after the Dark Knight?) and this lame duck sequal, the prospects seem grim.",1246060800,,1047,4.529100529100529
3489537,3,B001BCO8XQ,"Having spent many years watching X-Files on TV, I have to believe that there is a good maybe even great movie out there, this just wasn't it.  In fact this wasn't even that good a TV episode.  Yes it had better filming and the sets were fancier, with some better known guest stars (Amanda Peet and Billy Connolly) but nothing to make a big deal about.  NOTE: it was nice that they found a spot for Mitch Pellegi at some point.

An FBI agent has disappeared and the Agent in Charge (Amanda Peet) has called in Mulder to help find her.  Why Mulder?  Because the FBI is working with a convicted pedophile priest (Billy Connolly) who is having 'visions' about where the agent is and no one trusts him.  Gee there's a surprise.  In between looking for the agent and spending time with Fox, Scully is busy trying to save the life of a young boy who is dying from some 'rare' disease.  Go Scully.

Chris Carter has to go find something more important to do that make long versions of X-file episodes.  NOTE: when Mulder is looking for a phone number on his cell-phone, one of the names he scrolls by is ""Gillian"", very sneaky.

OK, move along nothing here to see.

3489538,4,B001BCO8XQ,"Mulder & Scully have left the FBI and are living in rural Virginia. She is a surgeon at a Cathloic Hospital and he sits in his room and clips newspaper articles about strange happenings. You know, the usual. Then an FBI Agent is kidnapped and a defroked Catholic Priest claims he has visions relating to the crime. The Bureau doesn't know how to deal with this kind of ""evidence,"" so they send The Bat Signal to Mulder. He does not want to get involved but Scully convinces him otherwise.

Without giving anything away, the story centers on belief, or faith, and  ethical choices those in the movie make on the basis of nothing more than faith. Mulder has faith in the defroked Priest and belives him. Scully does not, at least as far at the kidnapping case is concerned. But Scully does have faith that a radical new stem cell therapy can save one of her pediatric patients. The hospital's Catholic administration has faith in each person's right to life, but has no faith in the radical stem cell procedure which is the dying kids only hope. It is never made clear if the therapy involves embroynic stem cells or the other kind. In any event, the hospital wants to, in effect, sign the kid's death warrant and send him off to a hospice enviornment. The hospital has faith that such is God's will. All the while, the defrocked Priest has faith that God is communicating with him by way of these visions.

So who has the right faith? Mulder, Scully, the Priest and/or the hospital's administration? And what ethical choices should we make based on nothing other than faith? Well, you will need to watch the movie to find out what happens. But know this, the case of the kidnapped FBI Agent turns pretty creepy. The science fiction in this story is not all that far removed from the real world. And that makes it all the more fun.

And by the way, if you want the answer to the ultimate question about Mulder and Scully, the answer is yes. Like Moose & Squirrel.",1245628800,,1961,4.515492957746479
3489539,4,B001BCO8XQ,"I was never a fan of the TV show, but then again, I never watched more than a couple of episodes, ever.

With that in mind, I knew what to expect as far as an X-Files movie is concerned- more or less the same thing but featuring a mystery story dragged out for over an hour and a half to fit the time length of a film version.

I have to be honest though, I was glued to the story and wanted to see what was going to happen next.  Whether the quality of the storytelling is able to compare to that of the TV show, I can't say.  All I can add is that I was absorbed into the story enough to say that I probably should have watched the show when it was still pumping out new episodes.

3489540,4,B001BCO8XQ,"""X-Files: I Want To Believe"" certainly didn't have the wow, in-your-face, big budget flavor of most summer movies, but in its own way it was just as ambitious as a ""Mission Impossible"" or ""Star Trek"" or any other huge summer franchise extravaganza.  Why?  Because it was brave enough to be small and intimate.  Best movie ever?  Nope.  But the film, with its busy little tale of body parts, psychic phenomena, kidnapping, and faith, is involving and moving (with a few creepy scares scattered about).  And while the producers may have skimped on the number of special effects and huge action scenes, they certainly didn't skimp on beautiful photography, terrific supporting actors (Duchovny and Anderson are great, too) and overall polish. This isn't a shoddy movie.

All the DVD versions of this film allow viewers to watch a slightly longer cut of ""X-Files: I Want To Believe"" than the one seen in theaters, which clarifies a few story points and lets viewers see a couple of extra character-based scenes.  The closing credits of the longer cut also features a few hundred cast and crew photographs scattered throughout the credits (needless but harmless).  The theatrical cut is also included on the various DVD versions.

My single-disc version of the film features the two cuts of ""X-Files: I Want To Believe"" and, generously, a small handful of extra features.  I say ""generously"" because the producers could have saved all the special features for the multiple-disc versions of the film and just made the single-disc version be ""bare bones"", meaning the movie and nothing else.  But at least we single-disc purchasers get a few extra things to look at after the movie, too.

I hope that this isn't the last we'll see of Mulder and Scully, but if it is, this modest but intense little film is a perfectly honorable end to their adventures.",1245283200,,1845,4.912903225806452
3489541,1,B001BCO8XQ,"Based on the other reviews I read here, someone must have switched DVDs in the case that I bought. I definitely did not see the great movie the other reviews have raved about.
I have only written two other reviews on this site in my life: one that was very positive about  ""Bicentennial Man"" and one that was very negative about ""Artificial Intelligence"". The ""X-Files - I Want to Believe"" makes the latter look like a winner of every academy award ever presented. The only thing that reminded me of the original series was the ""I Want to Believe"" poster and pencils in the ceiling.
The sexual tension in the original series that made me a die-hard fan is gone. The subtle comedy is gone. There is little about this movie that made me reminise about the good old days of Muldar and Scully.
This is a very dark and some would say gorey movie that would be better suited if presented as a sequel to one of the thousands of CSI series that are currently flooding the airwaves.
""Chris Carter, - SHAME ON YOU.""
Watching this movie was like watching a loved one die a painful death and having that moment to remember rather than all of the happy times you could have remembered with that person.
If you would like another measuring stick: Watching this movies was as sad as the day I found out that the SCIFI channel was going to start airing ""World Championship Wrestling""

I have to say I agree with both people who hate and with those who love it. Personally I think what they should have done was have this movie tie up the loose ends from the show, i.e. Mulder and Scully being chased by the FBI and those supersoldiers. Mention how Skinner didn't get in trouble, how Scully was able to get that job at the hospitall. To much happened in the last few seasons for them not to mention any of it at all. This movie would have been a great follow up to a movie that DID explain all of the above. As far as the movie itself goes, I thought it was a good movie. Gillian Anderson stole this movie for me, her acting was amazing and the conflicts she has during the movie made for an intresting point in the plot.

3489544,2,B001BCO8XQ,"I must admit that I haven't watched THE X-FILES television series for some time. Like many series (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lost/dp/B00139YA4O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lost</a>&nbsp;included) they start getting ridiculous or lose focus of their storylines. I guess I shouldn't have been surprised that this newest theatrical release -- THE X-FILES: I WANT TO BELIEVE -- is just as insipid as the last few episodes I'd watched of the television series. And it looks more like a murder mystery than the supernatural feel that appealed to early watchers of the series.

David Duchovny (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Evolution/dp/B00005R874/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Evolution</a>) reprises his role as ex-FBI agent Fox Mulder, as does Gillian Anderson (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Last-King-of-Scotland/dp/B000NIVJF4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Last King of Scotland</a>) as Dana Scully. The ridiculousness of the premise is such that I'm having trouble typing it here. It sounds so ...pat and simple. But it's basically about a pedophile catholic Father who supposedly has visions of women who've been kidnapped recently and moved to unknown quarters. One of the kidnapped is an FBI agent and agent Whitney (Amanda Peet,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Martian-Child/dp/B00005JPT0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Martian Child</a>) wants Mulder's help to find out if this holy man (Billy Connolly,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fido/dp/B000V4UH08/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fido</a>) is the real deal or if he's jerking their chain. ""Wanting to believe"", and still aching to find his lost sister, Mulder joins up with the FBI once again and gets pulled into the terrors ...along with Scully.

By this time, we know that Scully and Mulder are hot for each other. It's old news brought back around again and given way too much easy screen time. They fall into each others' arms in lockstep fashion (no surprise there).

The storyline is simple and pretty lame. And it really has nothing to do with the supernatural or aliens or anything that we've come to expect from Chris Carter's creation. It's more in-line with Mary Shelley's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Frankenstein/dp/0743487583/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Frankenstein</a>, a sort of horror/murder-mystery ...mess.

The saddest part is the over-acting by Duchovny and Anderson. Their lines are forced and unrealistic, as are almost all the actions that dictate what they do.

I felt this film would've been better relegated to the realms of the television series than given a theatrical budget. It's weak. Really weak.",1243987200,,2838,6.785714285714286
3489545,2,B001BCO8XQ,"Given a choice on a Monday night, I chose to watch and review the theatrical cut, figuring that if Chris Carter didn't have enough clout to release the film exactly as he wanted in theatres - given all the serious money ""The X-Files"" has brought for Fox, what would be the point in a longer version? Plus I hate the trend in DVD extras and extended cuts. They demystify.

The movie? They should never have come back. Not like this. I am constantly amazed as I skip through the TV channels, just how powerful and influential the X-Files has been. This movie, script, editing and whole approach will only rarely show you what the fuss could have been about.

1) Mulder's beard. Hugely distracting - for me the movie could not begin until he was rid of that damn Yosemite Sam beard.

2) The Canadian Rockies will never ever be confused for even the highest Appalachian Hills in West Virginia.  Just set the story in Colorado, for chrissakes. Or Seattle.

3) The movie is poorly edited. Key establishing shots - sometimes disturbing ones - jump by so quickly, that you're not always sure what you're seeing. And beyond that, the cinematography is so lacking - the movie simply has none of the true visual poetry that the TV show so often had. The old show often had what I would call Spartan Gothic Futurist Glamour. Which sounds crazy until you're watching it. Outside of some atmospheric shots in the snow, this movie does not have it.

4) The plot is so tired. Chris Carter obviously loves ""Silence of the Lambs"" - there would be no Scully and X-Files without it. But he has gone back to the sadistic well of  young-women-in-annihilating-gross-peril far too often. This old plot didn't just feel like the 20th rehash of an X-Files plot, but the 200th rehash of ""Millennium"" as well.

5) Billy Connelly has yet to convince me in any movie, let alone as a memorable creep in ""The X-Files.""

6) This is such a cop-oriented movie, Robert Patrick would have been absolutely welcome for the film. And it's a true shame he's not in it.

7) Is it better than the first movie? Not even, not close. When the first movie was released, the mythology/conspiracy arc of the show was still in productive swing, and you as a viewer had a real sense that the story was Going Places. We now know that the TV story arc crashed shortly (if not simultaneously) to the movie release. But even now, the action scenes in that film are often thrilling, only one of the scenes here comes close. I'd be willing to watch ""Fight the Future"" again, but this one... never.",1243814400,,2540,4.550438596491228

This could have been a 2-part, made for TV movie, and it still would have been just okay.  Making it a full length feature film only highlights its failings.  First, the plot is pedestrian.  A better plot would have helped.  There are lots of inconsistencies too.  For example, Scully gets Mulder to commit to helping the FBI find a missing agent and then, as soon he starts helping them, wants him to stop.  We have a room full of Russian medical personnel, operating in the USA, who apparently can't understand a lick of English.  Mulder, an experienced FBI agent, lets a doctor get behind him and inject him with a tranquilizer.  Second, Duchovny and Anderson seem to be phoning it in.  Billy Connolly and Amanda Peet were the only actors who did a good job.

Instead what we get is a very small story that did not even involve any supernatural phenomenon aside from a physic priest.  The Frankenstein story was just not well thought out.  And why is Scully the skeptic again.  This issue was dealt with already in the series.  Scully convinces Mulder to assist the FBI with the case, then spends the second half of the film convincing him to drop said case.  Skinner's appearance was a complete waste as it took place at the end of the film.  Then, to add insult to injury, the last glimpse we have of these characters is them waving from a boat.

The hospital plot was a T.V. episode, the Catholic pedophile priest (yawn yawn, another Catholic priest child molester bad guy, real original) was tiresome, the Amanda Peet character lacked depth, the plot stunk, there WAS NO X FILE until the end when we see Dr. Frankenstein attaching the aforementioned gay antagonist's head to a chick's body (Frankenstein plot, how fresh!), and cheesy dialogue.

This movie lacked suspense, surprises, the usual great character chemistry, and it was drawn-out.

This movie, I am sad to say, proved that not even David Duchovny could perform a rescue.  During the final 2 seasons, whenever it would get boring, he would pop up and completly reinvigorate my love of this show.  What were they thinking?  I don't need aliens or conpiracies to rate this show highly.  I must be made to think outside of my normal thinking and I will follow.  This show was weird, predictable, and played off of the desires of viewers to go where ever Mulder/Scully went without thinking.  Sadly, I bought this on blu ray.

I think a lot of people went into it thinking it was going to be the usual X-Files storyline of looking for aliens/government conspiracies. I had read before hand about the movie and went into it  knowing that it was more a crime/mystery/suspense movie. I think it would have been too much if they had done another movie based on finding the flying saucer like the first movie. It was nice to see a change of pace and I think if a lot of people would give the movie a chance it would grow on them. All together I liked the storyline, the plots and the characters. I also think it would have done a lot better at the box office if hadn't opened around the same time as some big box office movies (The Dark Knight). I think maybe if it had opened at another time more people would have given it a chance and gone to see it. I'm definitely happy though with the DVD and I hope there will be another movie.

3489561,4,B001BCO8XQ,"Despite being a self-professed X-Phile, it actually took me a few days, to really appreciate ""The X-Files: I Want To Believe.""  There are so many simply-stated nuisances in this movie that are not only easy to miss, but easy to misconstrue and therefore label negatively.  I feel this is what has happened with some reviewers, who (except for Roger Ebert who I believe has the final word anyway) have mostly garnished this latest cinematic addition to the X-Files universe with unsavory attention.

Firstly, I don't believe critics are measuring this movie on a proper scale.  It is not an ""Incredible Hulk.""  It's not a ""Dark Knight.""  There are no huge explosions, no bigger-than-life villains, and not one CGI character.  However, the impact eye candy these mega-blockbusters provide is more than present here, only more understated, more cerebral.  In effect, IWTB is the anti of these movies.  Its quiet, intuitive moments happen ""to"" you, instead of ""at"" you.  Will you be entertained?  I should think so.  Will you be intrigued, causing you to think on this film days after you've seen it?  Absolutely.  If you are expecting, however, a nail-biting thriller or a creepy X-Files-esque mystery, you won't really find it.  There are no aliens.  There's not a conspiracy.  In fact, the only X-File here is what the human heart is actually capable of.  Yes, the creep factor is there, but the actual X-File is really only an excuse for us to drop in on the lives of our favorite paranormal investigators.

As far as the story, there are actually two deeply intertwined, parallel plots in IWTB.  As Scully makes hard decisions on behalf of a sick child, villains make unspeakable decisions on behalf of themselves.  Scully's storyline is actually my favorite, and makes me appreciate Scully as a character and Anderson as an actress even more than I did before the film.  Knowing what Scully has gone through (as a mother) will help you appreciate this even more.  And then, there's faith.  Faith is, after all, the very issue of the movie, the meaning of the title.  Salvation is also a major theme.  Scully, an on again off again Catholic since we first met her, has always struggled to reconcile God and science--what she can prove and control vs. what she can only trust in as truth, what she knows in her heart.  By the end of the film, she seems a bit more reconciled to what she knew all along.  Her struggles are not unlike Mulder's, who is constantly seeking yet never accepting the truth that is so plainly evident.  Their complicated relationship, rendered BEAUTIFULLY here by superb performances by both Anderson and Duchovny, is at the very heart of this movie.  As a couple they are both destined and doomed...engrossed in a deep, preternatural love yet constantly pulled by their respective passions.  In the end, it is a question of faith: faith in each other, faith in themselves, faith in the power of Light to overcome Darkness.  Essentially, IWTB is a story of two people coming to terms with who they were, who they are now, and who they can be together.  IWTB's unfailing message is this:  Just believe.",1238889600,,3126,4.824858757062147
3489562,5,B001BCO8XQ,"The fact that we have people writing reviews for a product that does not yet exist should tell you something Mr. Carter.

For about 5 years, every Friday night was the highlight of my week. While everyone else was going out eating and having fun, I was home watching my X-files. I had found a companion. It was pure bliss. In the beginning, not many people watched so there were not that many commercials to  interrupt the stories. But that all changed of course. Not only did the commercials get doubled and tripled, but then they moved it to Sunday and then later Monday night. Might not seem like much to non-X-filers, but the stories just worked on Friday and didn't on Sunday/Monday. Both of those days are the beginning of the week, usually major pressure days. To really enjoy the X-files, you need to have a clear head and want to forget the past weeks worries. (Or try to make sense of them) :)

I came to Amazon to buy the DVD collection because my Laserdisk player is on it's last leg. (Yes, I have at least the first 3 seasons on LD.) But when I read the reviews on the DVD collection... and then saw the possibility of a blu-ray version, I hit the pause button. I think I'll wait till the BR comes out. Fewer disks and hopefully better packaging.

So do your fans justice Fox/Chris Carter. It's time to get the blu-ray version out so we can have our Friday night fun again.

3489563,2,B001BCO8XQ,"The first X-files movie could probably be classified a near blockbuster as it was highly anticipated, had lots of action, a well-developed sprawling storyline, and pulled together multiple threads in the x-files mythology.  This 2nd installment was more like an extra-long TV episode.  This time the tension and anticipation between Mulder and Scully are long gone as we see they live and sleep together.  The antagonists are original for the series, though not for the sci-fi genre as it is a total ripoff the Frankenstein story; they are even from Europe!

Probably the worst part of the movie is Mulder's utter stupidity in chasing down the bad guys by himself at the end of the movie.  He often does this in the TV serials, and usually learns after the first mistake.  Not in this movie; he screws up once, nearly gets killed for it, and decides to do it again, and again almost gets killed.  The whole mood of the movie was depressing too.  Everything either occurred at night, in the winter, or in a hospital.  And there was zero comedy; something unusual for 2-hours of X-files.

3489567,2,B001BCO8XQ,"I have been a long time X-files fan, looking forward to the once Friday evening episodes which then moved to Sunday evening. It was the ""everyone come over to our house for Sunday dinner and X-files"" routine. And it was the perfect creepy/mysterious/conspiracy-twirled ending to any weekend. I enjoyed the 1998 Movie and just watched it the other day to serve as an appetizer to Chris Carter's newest film, ""I want to Believe"". And I still want to, but after watching his latest work, have lost faith in Carter's ability to re-capture the essence that he so ingeniously created during the episodes of the 90's.

If this were titled, ""The Intimate Bond Between Scully and Mulder"" or ""The Darkness That Binds Us"", maybe I would not be so vexed with what was lacking in this film. However, the tension that once existed between the two has been replaced with monotony. I do admit that Carter beautifully demonstrates the growth and intimacy of their relationship. But this is not supposed to be a love story. And on that note, I vividly recall Carter saying that a romance between Mulder and Scully would be the end of the X-files. He was right.

I could much better cope with this film if it were a TV episode or two. However, I found it difficult to remain engaged in a story line that was so tedious and uneventful.

I truly hope that Carter's next attempt will recapture the quintessential mysteriousness and secrecy that was so prevalent in the episodes. If his next film doesn't deliver, I fear that fans will become angry and disillusioned.",1235433600,,1544,4.711111111111111
3489568,3,B001BCO8XQ,"I watched the X Files for two reasons: I wanted to know ""the Truth"" about the alien conspiracy, and fairly early in the series I began to care about what would happen between Mulder and Scully. The series ended  ambiguously on both counts. Frustrating, but it made for a nice teaser - maybe they'll make a movie and resolve all this. Or better yet, a movie that takes us just one step closer to resolution, sets us up for a second movie.

Well, they made the movie. And the movie worked fairly well, for me, as a stand-alone story. But it's not a stand-alone story, it's a sequel. And the writers simply set aside the questions that begged to be answered. I mean, at this point, who cares about another ""monster of the week"" story? What I want to know is, will Mulder save us all by 2012? And (the romantic in me) after - what? 7 years? 8? - why is Scully still in this static, dysfunctional relationship with a reclusive, narcissistic loser?

3489571,4,B001BCO8XQ,"I completely enjoyed the 1998 ""X-Files"" with the alien theme and the cinematography was inspiring. Mulder and Scully carried their relationship well throughout that film (even though Scully was unconscious towards the end). This film plays more like an extended TV plot, albeit with some excessively grotesque and disgusting themes and visuals. An agent goes missing so a former priest `who has a sixth sense' is brought in to help solve the matter. Why the priest had to come from a colony of sex offenders is beyond me and why one of the first clues is a severed arm was unusual, but that `type' of dark theme continues. Without giving too much away, there is far less spookiness and much more creepiness than before. Some of the numerous scenes with severed limbs for ""specific"" purposes are downright nauseating. I'll stop there with that, but by the last portion of the film, one realizes that this might not be alien-like or psychic at all, which is what the ""X-Files"" has always been about for me. Scully and Mulder do have the same good chemistry that teeters back and forth and the acting (Amanda Peet is intense and Billy Connolly as the priest is convincing) is top rate, but the cinematography is elsewhere. Instead of the grand view of `awesomeness' we are used to, the scenes seem shot for the small screen. The ending is a bit too pat and satisfying to be believable, but you DO want to believe. That's why you can be assured that there is another ""X-Files"" movie in the future.",1235001600,,1493,4.680608365019012

Despite unbelievable findings from Father Joe, the ex-pedophile psychic (Billy Connoly steals the show), as soon as he comes up short one time the FBI says 'forget it.' Is this a cartoon comic, or the X-files? Amanda Peet never once lets you forget she's totally miscast as male imagination puts her in more sensual light. Her perky sexuality is suppressed to pretend she's the FBI agent in charge. You never believe her, but the movie is so listless and almost a parody, that you are kind of relieved to look into her blue eyes like a commercial that's better than the movie it's interrupting. Couldn't Peet have spent even a few hours with real police or maybe FBI? She doesn't have a clue as to command personna, or even how an agent in charge might react to a crime scene giving her dozens of fresh bodies. Amanda is never even ""in the movie"" with her character, but how do you forget those blue eyes? Every possible politically liberal tool is trotted out: the tortured logic here of stem-cell research controversy, Bush, Hoover, all FBI are morons beyond belief, Bible-believers are so hideous that they appear more agreeable to letting their son die than seeing Dr. Scully succeed.

I was thrilled when the movie came out because obviously we can't have enough of Mulder and Scully.

The movie starts off with The X Files no longer a department in the FBI, Scully is a Dr. in what seems like a hospital run by the church and Mulder is doing nothing. A disappearance case comes up so the FBI decide that Mulder should help them out and so an agent is sent to Dr. Scully asking her to convince Mulder in helping them.
Of course Scully goes ahead and convinces Mulder in joining the search for the missing agent. This is all building up well so far but what struck me as odd was that Mulder and Scully were finally an item.
The whole premise of the show was built on the sexual tension between the two and as fans we were all wanting them to be together but seeing them together actually spoiled it for me.

Also both David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson did not seem to be giving it their all. The acting was mediocre and somehow felt forced on them(maybe that's because they both wished they were doing something else yet were back to doing The X Files once again) i have no idea.
The storyline was very weak and unfolded as would any other thriller, not in the classic X Files way. Come to think of it the whole case was not really an X File per say. I did not understand how this random case pertains to Mulder's sister's disappearance, which was the reason he agreed to help the FBI.

It is an OK movie and for most people it could even be good but for a fan like me, it just did not pass The X Files standards.

3489584,2,B001BCO8XQ,"Back in the day I was an X-Files fan. Was I hardcore? No. Nothing over the top but I greatly enjoyed the show and out of it's 202 episodes, ( I think ), over the span of 9 seasons, I watched a good 180 episodes at least, maybe 190. I rarely watch the re-runs now but when they come up, it's something I've already seen, so it leads me to believe I've seen almost all of them.

I also enjoyed the ""Fight the Future"" film, directed by Rob Bowman. It was convoluted but involving, well-made and worked in the context of the show. It had texture, drama, scope and a narrative grandeur that this new X-Files film completely lacks. Not to mention that ""I Want to Believe"" is a low budget little movie. It looks and feels cheap while ""Fight the Future"" has the explosions, chases, special effects, crane shots, location photography with cities, nature, snowscapes and lots of aliens! It's a no brainer, ""Fight the Future"" is far superior filmmaking and storytelling. But before I really rip into Chris Carter's deficient new film, I want to relay the technical merits of this Blu-ray disc to all the High-Def enthusiasts out there.

The transfer is very nice. The movie takes place in the dead of winter and snow sure looks gorgeous on Blu-ray! The daytime scenes are sharp and have a life like quality to them but this is X-Files after all and we spent a great deal of time at night. The night photography picks up natural grain but overall is pleasing to the eye. There is no color oversaturization and flesh tones are normal. The film is not a spectacular visual feast but for what it is, this Blu-ray acquits itself rather nicely. A good, solid film-like look that has always suited The X-Files.

The audio is DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 but this film is not an over the top action-fest so there will be no major workout for your speakers. The extra features are substantial with a commentary from Chris Carter and co-writer Frank Spotnitz. An X-Files timeline that allows you to explore the entire X-files show in order with video clips and plot summaries. This is one for the fans indeed!

The rest of the extras include the necessary featurettes, promotional stuff, a digital copy of the movie, a gag reel and four! picture in picture features. One is Carter's video commmentary, another is a behind the scenes track, then a storyboard track and one of concept art. Basically a bunch of stuff you've never going to get around to but it's nice to know the studio went out of their way to outfit this disc and not wait for an eventual double dip.

Now I want to rip this movie a bit, so bear with me... The studio or Chris Carter or you can blame both... simply waited too long to get this turkey moving. Carter was able to obtain a budget of a mere $30 million. The first feature was a far more substantial enterprise. However, big budgets don't mean big quality, they usually mean diminishing returns, artistically speaking. So the idea is to make an X-Files film but downplay the blockbuster qualities and focus on a compelling narrative and sturdy character development of our beloved F.B.I. agents and their new supporting characters. Sounded like a good plan but too bad the filmmakers had no real story to tell. They were just mining the past with no purpose at hand other than cashing in on some nostalgia perhaps.

Take a very average to poor X-Files episode, stretch it out to nearly two hours and you'll get something approximating this dismal experience of a movie. The story as you already know does not deal with any of the alien conspiracy stuff. That's ok. But what a lifeless, plodding tale they tell here! Mulder and Scully are recruited by Amanda Peet and Xzibit, yes Xzibit, to help them with a murder investigation! Xzibit, X-Files, you gotta love it! The guy is not awful as an actor and his presence is not distracting, so whatever. Give him props for going out on a limb and doing something different. The supernatural element comes into play via a defrocked Catholic priest, ( played with screen chewing urgency by Billy Connolly ), who is experiencing visions and leads the crimefighters to try and solve the murder and abduction cases that form the narrative drive of the film. Now this priest has an ugly past. He is trying to atone for his sins. Let's see if you can guess what those are? Take the most cliched Catholic priest storyline you can think of and you've got it. Can you guess, do I have to even spell it out? Of course not.

I was really not interested in this story, it was dreadfully predictable. Here is the rational scientist/doctor Scully who is also an ardent Catholic and here is the irrational, ""I'll believe anything and everything"", except perhaps orthodox religion, former Agent Mulder. We've been fed this storyline so many times before and this time the scenario our duo is in is not in the least bit intriguing or exciting. The film is lifeless, silly, at times pretentious and pummels the legacy of The X-Files into the ground. One of the best televisions shows of the 1990s and this is what the fans get for a last hurrah? Ahhh!

Another element of the paranormal comes into play with the introduction of body snatchers who swap human heads and bodies. This ridiculous story point reminded me of those goofy Youtube videos of the disembodied dog head being experimented upon by Soviet scientists in the 1950s. These fake videos were always good for a laugh and you can't help but make the silly comparison to the story in this movie.

Before the movie opened, I became aware of the bad buzz around it and read the almost uniformly negative reviews of the film. I skipped the film in the theater but I wanted to see it on Blu-ray. Lowering my expectations, I sat down to watch this travesty and concluded that I should have just dropped my expectations completely down the well.

I know X-Files fans will have to see it but you'll just torture yourself by doing so.

I rented the movie when it became available...and ended up buying a copy because I liked it so much. I was pleasantly surprised that the Mulder/Scully relationship had matured nicely and was in a logical place, based on where the series finale left them.  The story was an acceptable Monster of the Week tale, albeit not quite up to the standard of a big-screen thriller.  Although it was implausible that Scully would have gone from being a FBI Agent/Pathologist to a Primary Care Physician/Neurosurgeon (shades of Buckaroo Banzai?), I was willing to go with it for the sake of entertainment.  It was equally implausible that the FBI would drop murder charges and a death sentence against Mulder simply because they needed his help with a case involving a psychic.  Other than Duchovny and Anderson, who seemed to slip right back into Mulder and Scully as if they have never been away, the performances were variable.  However, the movie was entertaining and, more than anything, it was good being with Mulder and Scully again.  Don't skip this one just because the series crashed and burned at the end.

I just saw The X Files: I want to believe (Bu-ray copy). And, I must say, I liked it VERY MUCH. It is all there - Mulder's old personality, Scully's action scenes saving the day, Skinner helping the ex-agents (as he always did in the past), plus the fantastic cold weather and the snow that were a landmark of the TV series. And the Blu-Ray pictures are really beautiful. I really don't understand why some people criticized this movie so much (and these bad reviews for sure had an impact on the movie's revenues). Well, all I can say: if you're an X-Files fan, give the movie a chance - it deserves it. And if you're not a fan, but you like crime movies, this is a good one.

3489589,4,B001BCO8XQ,"The X-Files TV series' untidy conclusion left fans wondering what happened.  2008's ""The X Files: I Want To Believe"" is producers Chris Carter and Frank Spotnitz' attempt to scratch that itch.  The fan base of the TV series should find the result enjoyable if not completely satisfying.

As the story opens, a female FBI agent is subjected to a brutal kidnapping.  The FBI's principal lead in the case is a disgraced pedophile priest (Billy Connally) with psychic visions of the kidnapping.  The FBI lead investigators (nicely played by Amanda Peet and Alvin ""Xzibit"" Joiner) find themselves out of their depth and seek out former agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully (David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson reprising their roles).  Scully is working as a doctor at a Catholic hospital, trying to save a young boy with a nominally terminal illness.  Mulder is living in seclusion in a rural cottage, avoiding the FBI.  The FBI offers them a clean slate if they will help.

Thus begins a bizarre case that would have been a solid ""monster of the week"" episode from the series.  Mulder and Scully wrestle with clues that defy easy explanation; the credulous Mulder and the skeptical Scully will debate their meaning while racing to stop a hideous medical experiment.  In a thrilling conclusion, Scully will call upon an old FBI friend to help rescue Mulder, whose relentless pursuit of the clues leaves him in mortal danger.

Carter and Spotnitz largely avoid X-Files conspiracy mythology while delivering the standard format of the TV series.  Most satisfying to this reviewer, they honor the nuanced relationship between Mulder and Scully, who pick up their repartee without missing a beat.  The progression of their relationship since the end of the series is revealed in an extremely well-done bedroom sequence in which Scully ponders aloud the case of her dying patient.

""The X-Files: I Want To Believe"" is highly recommended to fans of the TV series.  Newcomers may find the self-referential plot and characters difficult to follow.  Fans should enjoy seeing what amounts to a new and extended TV episode whose concluding sequence offers some hopeful closure in the best tradition of the X-Files.

The writers made a huge jump in the lives of Mulder and Scully without ever satisfactorily explaining the events between this and the end of the series. Their attempt to make the relationship problems between Mulder and Scully dramatic was ineffective at best, if not laughable. I don't know if the two actors simply lost their chemistry or whether the internal conflicts ruined the idea that they could have fulfilling life together. The plot was very non-X-Files, the psychic character that was supposed to carry the movie was completely one-dimensional, and the snowy and frigid landscape for the entire movie made it especially sleep-inducing.

Since this kind of severely limits what I can actually review, I thought I'd take this piece of amazing Amazon advice at face value and review my experience with the DVD.

Well, the case the movie came in was pretty standard DVD-case quality.  Black, plastic, about five by seven inches.  The cover art was simple yet eye-catching, and it did a good job at carrying out its purpose, which is to catch your attention in the video store and rent it or buy it.

When I put the DVD in my player, there was some initial concern because an odd noise emanated from my DVD player.  At first I thought something was wrong with the DVD, but it turned out that I had just not seated it properly when I pushed the 'Close' button.  Whew!  I thought surely I'd have to knock stars off the rating, but nope, it was my fault.

The DVD played smoothly, with no on-screen distortion, artifacts, or other assorted distractions.  Some movies I've rented recently have had something wrong with their color balance, but this one was just fine in that department.

So, in closing, about all I can say (and about all I'm allowed to say) is that the DVD was of average or maybe even a little above-average quality.  If more people took the time and care to make superior packaging like this, the world would be a better place.

On the one had it tries hard to maintain the brilliant dynamic between Mulder and Scully, the almost love affair but not quite plutonic relationship is alive and well here. The story is about an FBI agents whose gone missing and is taken by people who want to use her body in 'interesting' ways. Such a story would be right at home during the shows run on Fox, but this is just too flimsy a plot to hang a summer movie on. What happens is classic x-files and as a young fan during the 90's I instantly flashbacked to my teens watching a spooky, disturbing little yarn about psychics, the FBI, grisly murders and sexy redheads. However this ignores the sci-fi elements of the first film and thus makes this film a harder sell to non-fans. It's a hit or miss scenario for this film, either you like it or you don't. Fans will enjoy the subtle elements, while newcomers will be hard pressed to enjoy it as much. All in all, a good x-files episode does not a good movie make.",1231718400,,1021,4.350785340314136

Despite all this, there were a few lines of signature dry humor, that elicited a chuckle.  It was enjoyable to reminisce and see Mulder and Scully in action again.

The whole movie felt like a long episode that was the worst on t.v.  What is the deal with the evil version of the catholic priest anymore and I understand that some have done bad things but man is it really that dark to be a priest.  By that I mean letting children die in the movie or have them as sickos.  I noticed they were trying to step on morality lines which made me think why oh why did they do it.  Just bring in some paranormal activity and ghosts or something.  The movie was lost in its own in my little mind (sarcasm of course)  in its own agenda.  Even at the end it didn't feel like they accomplished anything with the movie.  Next time maybe they will let fans of the show write it and bring back the nostalgia.  Not a good movie to watch unless you have seen all movies except one and that turns out to be this one.

What happened to the evil government conspiracies? The Aliens? I want my science fiction! This reminded me of low budget horror flicks with depression and anxiety injected for flavor. Poor Mitch Pileggi gets randomly and inexplicably tossed in at the last half hour.

It's as if Carter got stuck in the depressive mire of Millenium, lost his bearings and stayed there. Someone called this a stand alone episode; I think it's more of a pile alone.

To spend years of the series in creating the alien conspiracy plot and not even use it is puzzling in itself.  To have the first movie in a decade as basically an extended stand-alone weekly episode makes you question what the point in the movie was.  It almost seems like they had two separate side plots with the priest and the transplant and they never really bothered to connect them well.  The topical mini-plot regarding the ethics of stem cell research is really inexcusable to have included in the movie, as was the shameless product placement.

With all of this said, it is slightly refreshing to see a movie that didn't use computer special effects as a crutch.  Good storytelling is one of the cornerstones of the original series.  I hope the disappointing reviews don't prevent them from making another film but instead encourage them to develop a script more reflective of what made this show popular.

Being an Xfiles movie, suspension of disbelief is an automatic - you don't go into an X-files movie as a skeptic by now, and if you do, what the hell are you watching it for? But the subject matter here doesn't seem big screen worthy, at least not in modern times, as it isn't very original either.

The storyline probably could have been played out as a non-Xfiles movie, but as far as the characters go, the writers assume familiarity, so a first timer will be confused as hell. I sorta skipped out on the last couple of seasons of the X-files, so some aspects of the Scully/Mulder relationship caught me by surprise. Some of the periferral characters weren't very well fleshed out and this wasn't the usual conspiracy feast that the first X-files movie and series was, which is a shame, because there is also a lack of palpable paranoia/fear that made the series so gripping. They try to lure the viewer into thinking it was...

SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!!!

.

just a movie about black market human organ snatchers, but even the most casual X-filer knows better, expects a twist, and when its revealed that they're trying to do head transplants, or body transplants if you prefer, for some dude, and its never explained how or why or given a viable motive, I was left scratching 'my' head. The so-called scientist/surgeons speak only in Russian and seem to act like nothing's out of the ordinary, as if they're surprised to find anyone objecting to the Frankensteinish proceedings. I was less than impressed with the twist - very banal and too straight forward to me. Again, the lack of conspiracy and paranoia of the original show makes this plot rather ordinary. The psychic character in this episode seem misused and underdeveloped, as his relationship to the perps is hinted at, but never really connected. They try to flesh this character out, but they fail to make him very compelling (and isn't using an Irish actor to portray an excommunicated/psychic catholic priest a tad cliche?). And of course, seasoned FBI agent Fox Mulder still acts infuriatingly stupid as he bumbles his way into trouble, needing rescuing - I hate such plot devices. There was a few moments of good drama and tension here and there, but for the most part, the main story ends anti-climactically. There was a secondary theme concerning faith that was touched upon, but only superficially explored. At least twice Scully expresses being remiss for having to peer into 'the darkness' again, and says she's tired of it. Mulder seems tired of it too, as does David Duchovny, the guy playing Mulder. Same with Gillian Anderson (Scully). Maybe they should be left alone in the future, as this case didn't really seem to warrant their presence, and their characters come acrossed as, well...tired. What woulda been more compelling would be to delve more into how the X-files have effected these characters. Duchovny looks appropriately disenfranchised with the FBI's refusal to acknowledge his work, and Gillian's Scully is downright haunted by her experiences. They both go into this episode dragging their feet. They show passion for each other, but not for what they're doing. This is where the franchise needs to explore further, and not try for the cheap creepfest. But really, this franchise should stick with TV.

I'd say that this movie might be a treat for fans of the old series, but hardly sequel inducing. When this show was in its original run, it was the creepiest, most intelligent show on TV...in its day. But for ardent fans of the show, its too predictable and uninspired in its attempts to be unpredictable...fans are too used to expecting some big, clever surprise, and you can only be so clever for so long. Its a show/movie that's seen its time come and go. I wanted to believe, but ultimately couldn't. I'm with Scully...time to put this thing to bed.",1230854400,,3949,4.785923753665689

The primary problems with the film are 1) that we don't get to see the big-budget alien abduction/government conspiracy movie that most of us were hoping for, and 2) -- this is why the movie fails as even an ""in-between episode"" -- one of the primary actors can barely act, can barely read his lines -- I believe he is, in real life, a rapper who goes by the name of Xzibit.

It's been six years since the series ended, ten years since the last motion picture, and what we get is a modern-day Frankenstein story.

This film has a lot to recommend it: Duchovny and Anderson take on the personas of Mulder and Scully as if no time had passed; the movie is beautifully filmed and acted; Amanda Peet was surprisingly good (as she often is); and Billy Connolly is surprisingly sympathetic as a pedophile priest.

The film gives a little more insight into the character's personal lives which was never seen on the show, but still left you wanting more!

The DVD is great, awesome special features which include a gag reel, an extended version of the film and a documentary on the film just to mention a few.

3489625,5,B001BCO8XQ,"While anticipation is a natural thing when a movie released over the summer, when the long-gestating and well-guarded sequel to the ""X-Files"" is nearing release, fans are sent into a frenzy and the main feeling felt all around is: it's about time. So of course interest and the want to find out what the movie was actually about goes into overdrive and leaks and fake spoilers were thrown around all over the internet so when you walked into that theater, you had no clue what you're in for. And what did they get? A small scale character-driven story focusing more on development, creepiness and intrigue. So on one hand, the bigger moments from the first film, ""Fight the Future"" has been taken down, the film came out around the time of the ""Dark Knight"" juggernaut came out and it was a story that didn't center on the alien conspiracy mythos so how's it in the end? Pretty good, I'd say.

An FBI agent is abducted and Agents Whitney and Drummy are getting nowhere even with a possible psychic named Father Joe. Racing against time and no leads to speak of, they enlist the help of former FBI Agent Fox Mulder who's gone into seclusion thanks to not only his work on the X-Files but the government sees him as dangerous and too knowledgable whereas everybody else thinks he's just nuts. Brought on as well is Agent Scully, now a medical doctor at a Catholic hospital. One's reluctant to return to their agent ways while the other just wants to find...something to believe in. But solving the case while dealing with their own issues and their beliefs is tested when Father Joe is revealed to be a convicted pedophile and former religious man yet seems to be the best help on the case.

Over the course of the 9 seasons The X-Files were in production on, episodes were usually divided into 2 camps: the mythology episodes which dealt with Cigarette Smoking Man, Samantha Mulder and the truth that the agents are trying to uncover. The other half were the so-called ""stand alones"" which were comedy episodes like ""Humbug"", creature of the week-types like ""Squeeze"" to more character-driven episodes such as ""One Breath"". The second film is more along these lines as there's no aliens or conspiracies and the tone is a lot less grander than the first film and there's a feeling that this is what made the film a slight disappointment. 6 years after the show ended and instead of a grand tour-de-force comeback, they change conventions and do something smaller and in a way I appreciate it though on the other hand, the main plot isn't really as integral or important as last time though the character journeys are so while the actual missing FBI agent story is kind of interesting, it's not really as satisfying.

However, returning to these characters after so long is very satisfying and seeing old habits that still don't die hard such as Mulder's seed eating or his strange desire to litter his ceiling with pencils is a nice see. But seeing the old faces, even old names be mentioned and neat cameos (look closely at the woman Mulder passes by in the FBI...looks similar to the photo on his door, no?) It's also a lot more smarter than most summer blockbusters and the issue of faith and science and believing in things such as giving a young child a terminal illness while a former pedophilic priest helping solve a case is dealt with certainly a lot more depth. It's kind of a movie built for the smaller screen that was released on the bigger screen so kind of a strange situation.

That said there are some things the film could've done better. While acting wise, Duchovny and Anderson still carry the chemistry and attitudes their characters have (especially Anderson who's being way too underutilized in movies lately), Xzibit is kind of one-note and Amanda Peet's character, while apparently meant to be a possible love triangle subplot or least more than just another agent that gets called in, doesn't have much development on her side either. Oh and Skinner is basically a cameo but then again so were the Lone Gunmen last time so there needed to be one other I guess.

While one can very much blame the release of the film and the massive success of Batman as well as Indiana Jones 4, Hulk and Iron Man for the relative disappointment the film did in theaters, the film does succeed if one doesn't think this is to be the explosive follow-up 6 years in the making and while it does have issues, I still was entertained by it.

maybe my hopes for this film were just too high- six years after the series ended, I was expecting a little more fireworks (i.e., supernatural elements similar to the first film).

it seemed as though Mulder and Scully didn't have enough action scenes or sequences in this film- I think it would have played better as a t.v. movie, rather than a big screen movie.  Too much dialogue between them.  The plotting was a little slow and spread-out to keep my interest.  The climax ending just didn't work for me, it felt ""forced"".

That being said, Chris Carter, David Duchovny, & Gillian Anderson are very talented people, and I think they will go on and have great movies in front of them for the future.",1230508800,,895,4.487654320987654

However, upon second viewing, I loved it and wouldn't have changed anything. It has horror and action, and of course MULDER and SCULLY. They are just as miserable and totally in love with each other as ever.

IF: You are deciding between just the regular dvd and the 3 disc special edition, then I would offer this advice: Die hard fans or newbies you want all the Scully/Mulder you can it get, it should be a no brainer. This version comes with the director's cut, which offers a bit more insight into Scully's head. PLUS the digital copy is great. The extras are pretty good and that scene with the Jeffersons on tv has no other meaning, Carter just liked them.

3489632,5,B001BCO8XQ,"I did believe.........

 The return of the X-files was at first a hard pill to swallow.  Would they be able to recapture the old magic?  Or would a new film taste bitter and old?  My total concerns were deep, considering that the original X-files came along around the time my personal entertainment choices were beginning to formed.

 As a child I was already interested in UFOs, I would feverishly consumed books on the subject,  and then along came the X-files where I could get a weekly dose of my then favorite subject.  However after five seasons and one motion picture, I lost track of the series.  Moving time slots and diving too deep into so called ""mythology"" episodes, I kind of gave up.

 Then late in 2007, I had heard that new film was being released and I quickly decided to reacquaint myself with my old friends Mulder and Scully.  I then proceeded to purchase all nine seasons of  the X-files(needless to say I had put it off far too long).  I could give a detailed review of the series, but I will save that for another day.

 Now lets get to the very heart of the matter, ""X-Files: I Want Believe""  its cold, its dark, its gloomy, and its X-files all the way.  My worst fear was that it would be similar to the crap we were feed in season nine, but it was more like season four peppered with a dash of season eight.  The fact that this was a ""stand alone"" episode of sorts does help and the fact that it keeps the mythology of the series at arms length, helps on the highest level.  In the film the series is a mere whisper, they only touch base with the only the big topics( i.e. their son).

 With no real action this film is more dialog and character driven,  it's a thinker.  The plot unfolds slowly,  the first half is more about reconnecting with old friends.  Nothing about this movie seems half-handed or sloppy, even when certain aspects of the plot get thin, someone or something is always there to pull you back in and say ""Hey, this is the X-files, just enjoy it and take our word for it"".  The only problem I had was that anyone coming in from the outside that may not know the show, may not get it.  That is the only thing the filmmakers took for granted,  for a fan its great, to everyone else its 50/50.

 In the end, I did believe and feel sorry that they decided to open the film one week after ""The Dark Knight"".  In a way ""I Want To Believe"" sounds like a battle cry that fell on deaf ears, but give the film a chance and maybe you'll believe.",1229990400,,2483,4.2709677419354835

3489635,5,B001BCO8XQ,"In fact, I was never really a fan of the show, and when the first feature outing came out, I wasn't any more a fan.  The first film dealt with all the things the X-Files fans seemed to love: the conglomerate of gray-suited men with names like ""cigarette smoking man"", sitting in well-appointed rooms saying things like, ""You're in way over your head, Mulder.""  Something to do with the mythology that I don't think ever concluded satisfyingly ... even for fans.

However ... 'I Want to Believe' is a stand alone and doesn't have to spend time explaining itself.  It brings together agents Mulder and Scully in the search for a missing FBI agent, with the help of a fallen priest that Scully regards with little more than contempt.  The familiar elements are here: the argument between the spiritual and the scientific, the unexplainable that, in the end, is either explained or left with an even bigger question mark, and the terrific chemistry between agents Mulder and Scully.  If anything, it's better ... with age and wisdom and maturity added to the supernatural mix.  And let's face it, at the end of a long hot summer of '08, it was nice to see two human beings using their intelligence to solve a crime that didn't involve defying all the laws of physics in an overtly CGI manner while wearing Kevlar or a clown face or an iron suit while explosions littered the landscape.  Those were fun movies ... but X-Files provided a thoughtful and atmospheric end to the summer season.  And now you can take it home and really appreciate the almost quiet way this movie works its spell.  It's almost not for anyone under the age of 30.  'I Want to Believe' is a throwback to movies made at least three decades ago when intelligent characters could act their age and still be very interesting.

'I Want to Believe' is a terrific piece of the X-Files puzzle.  If Chris Carter and writer Frank Spotnitz are able to make another one ... than I'm more than able to make it to the theater.  A really great 'little' movie.",1229644800,,2014,4.589385474860335

3489638,1,B001BCO8XQ,"This review WILL contain a few spoilers, but since I LOATHE THIS MOVIE I really don't care.

If you could remove the wrapper (the name) ""X-Files: I Want To Believe"" and also change JUST the names of the characters ""Mulder, Scully & Skinner"" (okay, and the actors playing them), what would be left?

The character of a creepy pedophile ex-priest, who may or may not be a psychic, in a ripoff of the film ""Jeepers Creepers.""  And ""Jeepers"" was directed by a man who was arrested on suspicion of child abuse.  He may have actually been the source of Carter & Spotnitz's ""inspiration.""

IWTB has a lot more in common with ""Frankenstein"" and ""The Silence of The Lambs"" than the X-Files franchise.

I watched the extended version of this film twice on dvd.  Once with the normal soundtrack and once with commentary.  I really wanted to know what was going through their heads when they made this thing.

The script that Carter & Spotnitz wrote contrasts loving heterosexual parents and their (of course) dying child against a child molester AND his employers who are (Surprise!) a male couple that ""got married in Massachusetts."" And if I understood the ""plot"" correctly, one of the 2 men had been molested by this same ex-priest as a child.

The film also contrasts the love of Mulder & Scully (which is enhanced with great lighting, nice scenery and orchestral music) against the relationship of the 2 gay villains who LITERALLY kidnap, imprison, & hack up their mostly female victims.  The women are imprisoned at a location with blood spattered floors and vicious dogs.

See, the women are being used for ""body parts"" to transplant into one of the gay men who is dying.

Why not have them kill puppies & steal girl scout cookies as well?  A little TOO obvious I guess.

And since these are ""gay"" men, they're (of course) using the body parts of WOMEN, because the writers needed to go after transexuals too.  Uh, no I'm sorry, it's because the women have a rare blood type and blah, blah, blah.

P-R-O-P-A-G-A-N-D-A

The ""message"" in this movie is pretty obvious.  Gay people are a THREAT and they should be feared because they kidnap, maim, mutilate, and murder women to get what they want.  They ""feed"" off society and are monsters who ""pal around"" with men who are child molestors.  It's actually the kind of ""reasoning"" that justifies hate crimes.

During the commentary track Chris Carter expresses a little concern for the animals that are used in actual research labs.  And during one DVD special feature he talks about how proud he is that they were so ""green"" in making this movie.

But I guess LGBT people didn't even warrant that level of concern from Carter & Spotnitz.  This film has a PG-13 rating and so it'll be seen by many, many children around the world.  Let 'em learn to hate (themselves or others) while they're still really young & impressionable.  Good job.

Contrast the PG-13 rating that IWTB got with the ""R"" rating that ""Ma Vie En Rose"" received.  Of course, that film does have something truly terrifying in it.... a little french boy in a dress!

Maybe I should just be happy that Carter didn't make the men cannibals, but I guess he had to save something for the next sequel.

Well, I'll just save the hundreds of dollars that I could have spent on all the X-Files movies & TV seasons.  And that seems fair.

I wonder how soon ""X-Files:  Attack of the Transexual Cannibals from Outer Space"" will be in theaters?

Note:  In video stores, this little ""gem"" should be displayed in between ""I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry"" and ""Boat Trip.""

This film is BAD on so very many levels, but as propaganda it works really well.  Congrats!

3489639,4,B001BCO8XQ,"I'm not about to pretend it's a perfect piece of filmmaking. It has flaws. The most significant of these seemed to be that the actors had a difficult time getting back into roles which hey had long ago left behind, and some of the distance was evident in this movie no matter how they tried.

The script, however, was wonderfully ambiguous, harking back to the best of the horror episodes from the series; the element of the supernatural was understated and the mood was carefully, finely  wrought. The setting - probably Canada, but on-screen a snowed-in West Virginia - was gorgeous. I was pleased there were no hints of the overriding government conspiracies the show devoted itself to; they really had no place in this movie. It wasn't that sort of film. The effects were mostly very very nice indeed, neither overdone nor used excessively. The thing it most reminds me of is, oddly enough, the feel you get from the first ""30 Days of Night"" comic book, of darkness and winter and clarity.

It was beautiful and satisfying though, both as a character study and as a mystery. As a character study it did not do what fans wanted but it did stay absolutely true to the character's natures; Scully was never someone who had an easy time dealing with the darker side to life, despite her long-term exposure to it. Mulder was always drawn to it, searching it out and dealing with it easily.

As a mystery is was nicely creepy and well-thought out, illustrating the ways that Mulder and the FBI would take divergent paths which would eventually arrive at the same place, albeit at different times. The mainstream FBI, while still shown as quite hidebound given the internal logic of the series, isn't made out to be quite as incompetent as the show generally preferred to portray it, which is a gratifying change.

All in all I liked it; I may like it more on second viewing, it seems that sort of movie.",1229385600,,1901,4.629080118694362
3489640,3,B001BCO8XQ,"Let me start by saying that I am and ALWAYS will be a HUGE fan of the X-Files.  Some of my most beloved episodes are the stand-alone stories (Masterpieces Include; IRRESISTIBLE, HUMBUG, ICE, CLYDE BRUCKMAN, HOME, PAPER HEARTS...to name just a few).  If there was one thing that I could count on the X-Files for, it was intelligent, sometime touching, sometimes funny, surprisingly poignant, but always compelling and genuinely creepy story telling with an absolutely superb cast and some pretty unforgettable monsters.  The way that this show dealt with the unexplained and the paranormal was nothing less than extraordinary. I have all 9 seasons on DVD and watch them regularly.  MULDER AND SCULLY RULE!

With that being said, when I found out that this movie would be in the tradition of the stand alone episodes, I was beyond excited!  I absolutely could not wait to see what the team would come up with for this installment!  And I just knew that whatever it was, it would totally exceed any expectation that I or any fan could possibly imagine and breathe new life into the franchise. WOOT!

The reality, unfortunately, is that this movie turned out to be quite a mis-step for the franchise.  While I will not say that this was a terrible movie, it just wasn't what the franchise needed right now.  The way I see it, this was THE opportunity for the team to re-connect with the old fans and bring in a new generation of fans by sparking their interest in the series, thereby creating a demand for more movies to be made.

While the movie did give us fans a chance to reconnect with Mulder and Scully, I highly doubt that it inspired any ""would be"" fans to go back and explore the show's great history and create an undeniable demand for more movies.  The trailers were promising, if a bit misleading, and what little promotion FOX did for this movie made it come across as some action-packed blockbuster thriller, which it was not...what it is, is  an intelligent, yet somber drama disguised as a paranormal thriller. But I suppose that had more to do with the fact that it was going up against The Dark Night, a mistake from the start.

And that brings me to my point.  This movie had the potential to be so much more, and the X-files definitely has more stories to tell..and I absolutely believe that the story of Mulder and Scully had to be told...just not now..what we needed now was a ""WERE BACK!, now be prepared to get the bejebus scared out of you!""

3489641,2,B001BCO8XQ,"The great thing that the original X-FILES possessed that practically no other TV series had (with the exceptions only of THE NIGHT STALKER, which the creation of THE X-FILES was inspired by, and TWIN PEAKS) was atmosphere, something that is practically impossible to generate on a small television screen. Its presentation of supernatural creepiness hidden beneath 1990s complacency genuinely could get under your skin on a Friday night and convince you that something was not well in the United States (the episodes generally shifted from small city or town from part of the country to another, eventually covering most of the map). The greatest disappointment of this second X-FILES movie, set something like six years after the series ended, is that it has practically no atmosphere whatsoever, even though the director and series creator Chris Carter wisely decided to eschew the series' excessively complex and convoluted ""mythology"" storyline (involving a ridiculous alien conspiracy) in favor of modeling the film after one of the much better ""stand alone"" episodes involving supernatural cases. But here the supernatural is reduced to an absolute minimum, involving a defrocked pederastic priest (Billy Connolly) helping the FBI find an agent who has been abducted by what turns out to be a killer with about the most ridiculous plan ever for the FBI agent's body.

The killer's central plan is supposed to be the source for most of the film's thrills and chills, but since so little explanation is given for it and it echoes so many hilariously bad Z-movies (even one infamously mocked on MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER 3000), it's almost impossible to take it very seriously. What we're left with instead is lots of overacting from Gillian Anderson, whose character of Scully has now become a surgeon at a Virginia hospital called Our Lady of Sorrows (subtlety is not this film's strong point) and who is tortured by having to care for a sweetfaced young boy with a rare brain disease. Anderson's great gift in the early episodes of the series was always to suggest Scully was feeling much more than the scripts possibly allowed for her, but once the writers seemed to realize this she was rarely given a director who was capable of reining her in once she got more overtly emotional material; here again she's just too much, and since her subplot is so clichd you begin to dread the scenes set back in the hospital.

3489642,5,B001BCO8XQ,"I am very happy I did not see this particular X Files movie in the theaters.  However, it was a great story, a fast moving, some times gut wrenching effects and some interesting chase scenes.  As a theater movie, maybe getting in to it with the X File fans who would have laughed at a few of the scenes.  The President Bush photo scene, well, I had to stop the video because I was laughing so much, really, just that was worth the whole experience.

This was more of a two hour view that could very well have been played as a TV movie special.  It was very well acted, although Mulder and Scully had a not again approach at times, they definately were drawn in by the possibilities.  Additionally, a good thing, some who may not be particularly early X Files fans and who may not be into mere Sci Fi aliens stuff, may be brought in by a more plausible story line.

Interestingly, there is a religion/science, religion/medicine conflict that both play through Scully, the sceptic, who has to see the possibilities that occur to her.  Here we also have a conflict between forgiveness and the lack thereof.  Without going into detail, we have a man who has visions (Billy Connolly) and who feels it is part of his redemption, where others feel he is part of the crime.  This creates an excellent story line, where you are having to make a choice yourself in your mind for the person involved.

Overall, worth the price of the DVD and to have in your library.  Again, would make a great TV movie.  Hopefully, we will have another, more true to the X Files story line for our next movie, and maybe much sooner than the last.  Frankly, ten years is really a long time between movies.",1229299200,,1677,4.420195439739413

I actually longed for it to end. First time I've ever found the director's commentary more interesting than the movie as a stand-alone. And why the tired old stereotype of a priest with an Irish accent. This one sadly lacked the scariness and dark humor of the best of the X-Files standalone monster episodes.

The repetitive, dreary quasi-relationship of Mulder and Scully serves as a background for two stories, both with catholic clergy cast as the bad guys. Scully's sick boy plot was never well developped and Mulder's main plotline was suitably dark and fuzzy. No classic X-files wierd stuff here - no aliens, unexplained phenomena or great conspiracies. Only nod to this are the questionable visions of the disgraced priest. As an X-files fan I was bored and disappointed.",1229212800,,580,4.989690721649485

I had to keep from falling asleep during most of the movie.  I cant even say it was worth the rental but it was nice to see Fox and Dana together again.

3489647,3,B001BCO8XQ,"I think that ""The X-Files: I Want to Believe"" was a terrible disappointment to most fans of X-files barely scoring three stars with this reviewer. With all the time which was wasted in negotiations and the making of this film I really didn't expect it to be any better than it was, but couldn't help going to see it when it first opened. The most amazing thing to me was that my wife and I were able to see this movie during a matinee attended by no other people and we were the only fans in the theater!  That was a first for unpopularity.

For die hard fans of The X-Files I can say that the transfer from film to DVD was excellent as were the various documentaries included which were a bit more interesting than the movie.  I could not understand what the bit was about in keeping this weak plot secret from the world wide web prior to the release and the spreading of miss-information to confuse loyal fans.

The only thing really noteworthy about this film was the very excellent props painstakingly developed to be anatomically correct.  The prop people deserve good grades for their efforts on medical anatomy. However, I don't think this level of effort for accurate props was needed for this particular production.

I think in order to retain the imagination of loyal viewers of The X-Files this film needed to showcase some brilliant variation of its original theme of an ET related government conspiracy. I guess this is the last time we will be hearing from the team of Scully and Mulder. It was gratifying to see them together again, but clearly not enough to make for a memorable film experience.

One sequence I enjoyed in at least the home version of the film (lord knows I didn't stick around long enough in the theater to see it) was an apparantly animated sequence showing from a lofty perspective a lovely bathing suited Scully and Mulder sailing off to a deserted island. At last, something many of us wanted to see and it was a special effect!",1229126400,,1966,4.552407932011332

If only the producers had thought to type the film as a quasi-religious treatment of unexplained phenomena, I would have passed on the opportunity to view this stink-burger.  As it was, I felt like I was sold a load of snake-oil and felt totally ripped-off.

The rest of this review is for the clueless producers of this Blu-Ray disk. Obviously they have learned nothing from the costly lost sales of the war with HD-DVD. People like me are not going to buy an expensive new Receiver just to play a particular movie on Blu-Ray. Especially with six audio formats to cover and perhaps more to come! I will rent this movie on DVD and wait for the audio wars to end. Since Blu-Ray has plenty of capacity, I do not see any reason why an English Dolby 5.1 soundtrack could not be included to ensure backwards compatibility.

How could Fox no longer be interested in aliens? What was his life's quest? What drove the TV show season after season? What was the central issue of the show and his life?

What happened to the aliens from all prior movies and shows? Apparently, nobody seems the least bit curious about them anymore, not even fox, perhaps because they never did exist. Apparently they have no pertinence or relevance to the FBI or to anyone else anymore.

And, when Fox is drawn back into criminal investigation it's not even because of some weird quirky criminal, let alone suspicions concerning aliens. It's just some missing FBI agent, a psychic, and Russion organ transplant surgeons.

It's like it was just some movie version of Law and Order, or at least it might as well have been. Robert Goren would have been a more interesting character for this movie than Fox Mulder.

I gave it two stars because it was nice to see Fox and Scully involved.

3489652,4,B001BCO8XQ,"Six years after the series finale of the cult hit comes the second theatrical X-Files film. The show may have ended six years ago but for those who kept with the series through the exhausted ninth season know full well that the TV show died long before the final episode. In one of the biggest television mistakes since the introduction of cousin Oliver, the producers decided that The X-Files was really about the monsters and not really about the relationship between Mulder and Scully and decided to introduce two new agents: Doggett and Reyes. Perhaps the biggest insult to fans was how the writers tried to slip these new characters into the show like they were dealing cards from the bottom of the deck, assuming the audience would be none the wiser. Mulder went on the lam, making guest appearances every now and then, and Scully became pregnant which regulated her to the role of consultant for Doggett and Reyes. The X-Files: I Want to Believe comes off as an apology of sorts for trying to move the spotlight away from the two agents we actually cared about. Interesting enough, the film is less concerned with the supernatural mystery than it is with the relationship between the two leads.

As the film opens we discover Scully once again practicing medicine like she had contemplated several times during her F.B.I. career. She now works at the Catholic hospital Our Lady of Sorrows where she is treating a young boy with an incurable brain disease. Since the series ended Scully and Mulder have moved in together and when Scully is at work Mulder remains at home still obsessing over the death of his sister, even though he knows full well she died decades ago. In the first ten minutes X-Files creator and co-scribe, Chris Carter, proves how well he knows these characters. Scully was never comfortable at the F.B.I. and always had doubts that she was doing more good working for the federal government than working in medicine. The X-Files was never her obsession, a conflict that remains central in I Want to Believe. Mulder now sports a Ted Kacsinski like beard which hints at the anti-government paranoiac that has he has always been in danger of becoming. Scully still serves as Mulder's anchor and without her one could imagine Mulder mailing letter bombs from his homemade shack in the woods. Despite the new setting one can immediately tell these are the same two characters we watched hunt monsters every week, but at the same time it's apparent that the past six years have weighed heavily on them.

Since the trial of the series finale, Mulder has become a forced recluse wanted by the F.B.I. When a self-professed psychic and ex-priest, Father Joe, turns up claiming to have visions about a recently missing F.B.I. agent one of the lead investigators decides to offer Mulder immunity in exchange for his help in either confirming or debunking Father Joe's abilities. There are many reasons to doubt Father Joe's story, the least of which is that before he was excommunicated from the church he molested over thirty boys. Of course, once on the case Mulder can't stop at just giving his professional opinion on the paranormal and begins settling into his role as an F.B.I. profiler. Scully is naturally afraid that Mulder is being pulled back into a life they both gave up long ago.

The movie takes plenty of risks, the first of which is that from the beginning Mulder and Scully are in a conjugal relationship. The obvious choice for a film like this is to fall back on the ""will they or won't they"" tension that was one of the hallmarks of the television show. Instead the movie deals with all too obvious questions about how two workaholics can live together and whether Mulder should be putting himself in danger with someone waiting for him at home. The second major risk is Scully's subplot concerning her young patient whose only chance for a cure winds up being an experimental stem-cell treatment. Naturally, this doesn't sit well with priests at the hospital.

In a film that ponders such timely subjects like God, stem-cell research, and gay marriage, perhaps the biggest taboo the film broaches is the portrayal of a sustained relationship in a Hollywood film. When an audience has become accustomed to an unrequited love between two characters it can be difficult to imagine the same two characters living with one another every day, but thanks to great performances by Gillian Anderson and David Duchovny the transition seems completely natural. The intervening years are scrawled on Duchovny's and Anderson's face, the former appears more world wearied and the latter strikes a more regal profile. As a couple they are reminiscent of that pair of slightly eccentric liberals who have strange stories about backpacking through the Ural Mountains and every time you come over offer up a different vintage wine that's just right for the occasion.

Special mention must be made of Billy Connolly's role as Father Joe. Because of his work as a comedian it's easy to underestimate Connolly's acting ability but here he perfectly nails the ambiguity of someone who may be either faking visions from God in order to weasel his way back into the church or he actually believes he is receiving these visions as a means of redemption. The presence of Father Joe carries some heavy implications. Are the visions actually from God and if they are then are they meant for redemption or punishment? What about Father Joe's pedophile urges, did they originate from the almighty?

Much like The Dark Knight, I Want to Believe uses a thriller format to delve into deeper questions. That's not to say that the film doesn't stumble in parts. It is difficult to believe that Scully is capable of organizing experimental surgery within the course of an evening's work and a quick search of the internet. In a film dealing with psychic visions you don't want the science to be the least believable part of the story. Of course, this is a small price to pay for a thriller with something to say.

Judging by the box office numbers there appears to be little chance for a third film. In a way that's all right since I Want to Believe manages to finish the story the TV show started. Not about the alien conspiracy, there are plenty of unanswered questions left over from the show, but rather about the real story: the relationship between Mulder and Scully. Now that fans of the series know the two remain together whether there's an alien invasion or not doesn't really matter, and even if this is the last X-Files story told it works perfectly as a tidy epilogue to a very, very long story.",1229040000,,6609,4.797190517998244
3489653,5,B001BCO8XQ,"If you were a fan of the series The X-Files, you will surely know that often the scariest things are what you are never shown, and ultimately, sometimes what you can never see because they are within you. This movie speaks to these fears, and at the heart of it all this time around stands Doctor Dana Scully.

X-Files fans everywhere would cheer at the thought, but that being said, if you have never seen the show, this movie still has a lot to offer if you enjoy a movie that gives you action, darkness and romance, without dumbing anything down. This movie does what a lot of other recent entertainment has neglected to do. It lets you think.

Scully, who has always tried to cling to her Catholic faith, has her trust in God challenged and the rock of the foundation of her relationship with her former FBI partner, Fox Mulder, shaken to its core.

Shot in vast, frozen landscapes, with a villian more psychopath and less alien, less paranormal than some might expect, the film plays like a good, old-fashioned, scary movie. There are plenty of 'gross' moments, but, as it has always been in the X-Files, most of it is not thrust in your face, but planted, like a seed of an idea to form in your thoughts as you sit, wide eyed and waiting, to see what happens next.

Chris Carter, creator or the X-Files, gives us here a logical look at where the couple would be at the present time, six years since we last saw them on the small screen. His attempt is well thought out and he remains steadfastly true to the characters and the X-Files universe he created. Mulder and Scully are as beautifully tragic and humanly imperfect as ever. They do not gloss over or deny their past--which would have been a great disservice to loyal fans--and David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson prove they are still capable of bringing their now famous, other-worldly connection to the table. We are treated to the smoldering looks and hints of sexuality that kept the series going all those years, but again Carter trusts us enough to know that this seed, too, grows best in the warm, dark soil of his audiences' minds and hearts.

To catch even just another glimpse of these characters is almost enough to satisfy the show's steadfast fans. Almost, because this dedicated group is known to be largely intelligent and highly opinionated. For this movie to be a success, it needed to stand alone as a story, but pay honest homage to the place and people from which it came. They had to nail it.

They did just that.

I left the movie satisfied, but wanting more. My mind was ticking. It felt like many Sunday nights, once upon a time when I'd hang on until the final ""I Made This"" that marked the end of the show's credits. (Speaking of which, if you see this movie, you'll probably want to stay until the end of the credits.)

We might never be so lucky as to get a show that nails it week after week quite as well as The X-Files did, but I dare to hope there will be more movies like this to come.",1229040000,,2980,4.445054945054945

But I felt the subplot with the sick child and the stem cell research a wee bit maudlin and slightly preachy.  Okay I get it. Stem cell research. Religious people seeking to thwart intrepid scientists who just want to heal sick kids. Can I go back to being entertained now?

The mystery- a missing FBI agent was just not much of a mystery and certainly not movie-worthy.  About the only mystery in this was the pedophile priest turned psychic. But who cares?

As usual, the end is a twist that leaves Mulder dangling while Scully can say ""I told you so."" This is true to the title, ""I Want To Believe,"" with Mulder thinking one thing, but that last-minute slap in the face to disprove his theory. Or, did it??? As with most other X-files episodes, it leaves you wondering. In this case, the psychic may or may not be real. The writer's throw all kinds of doubt at you at the last minute. Scully still doesn't believe, and Mulder won't give up that last ray of hope. Typical, and what I expected. No answers, but lots of questions. Recommended.",1228867200,,899,4.377245508982036

The premise was weak....Russians? collecting body parts to prolong life? In West Virginia???...lol.  And the only bit of supernaturalness was the chaplain's visions. Then there is the awkward sub plot of Scully and her patient that seemed really out of place with the primary story.

3489660,3,B001BCO8XQ,"Poorly promoted, and almost lost amid the shuffle of the Hollywood's major releases was this overlooked yet enjoyable return to the X-files. Although this is the second release for the franchise, it is not a sequel. But a return to the kind of story that gave me an appreciation for the series. Gone is the conspiracy theorists fodder of aliens among us, shadowy cabals in power, and government cover-ups on the highest order. In it's place is Carter's unique storytelling of that eerie world that lies in plain sight. The film returns to the show's main characters years later to find both. Haunted, numb, and weary of a world that has taken from them that what was most dear. They cling to each other, yet neither finds solace because they share loss, grief, and the shared experiences of nightmares that they both have witnessed and fought against. They exchange hollow glances and both see in each other the shells of the people they used to be. When along comes an opportunity for each to rescue another they both seize this moment to perhaps save a bit of themselves. Even it means to leave each other behind. From here two stories diverge as both try to save different individuals because they seek absolution from their personal demons. Chris Carter once again uses religion as the fulcrum for seeking truth when he intoduces a fallen priest that may or may not have the gift of clairvoyance and the key to solving a string of kidnappings. Mulder and Scully once again are divided between logic, faith, reason, and belief. What I will not tell you is the plot. In fact, I may have said too much. But what I will say is that Duchovny and Anderson are brilliant and compliment one another as the tormented pair Muldar and Scully. also talented are the supporting cast. Billy Connolly particularly stands out and conveys both the pious and profane with equal skill. If anyone missed this film's release or was too young to enjoy the original series I would invite you to enjoy the DVD and introduce yourself into Chris Carter's unique vision and style of storytelling. Where unspeakable things happen in that ordinary building off to the side, and monsters walk in the open because they appear no different as you or I. And when faith and belief grapple for supremacy when we abandon all we think we know and look for the truth.

At certain points in the movie i was wondering where they were going with the story. Then there was unnecessary CGI scenes in the movie that made the cinematography look really bad.

3489663,5,B001BCO8XQ,"This was a brilliant film.  The expectations, build-up, and pressure put upon the filmmakers; no film could've possibly lived up to that.  But 'I Want To Believe' makes a good effort.  Mulder & Scully have evolved somewhat, but I believe, in a good way, not a bad one.  I loved where their relationship had taken them, and the matters of faith and belief that the plot dealt heavily with.

But the reason for this review is to add my two cents about the quality of this as a Blu-Ray feature.  The menus and features of this film's disc (as well as it's counterpart, the previous film 'Fight The Future') are absolutely beautiful and the most complex I've ever seen.  Specifically, there is a special feature called ""The Complete X-Files Timeline"" in which you can explore completely, either by year or by season/movie, the entire history of the X-Files world.  It's a complete chronicle of the show, its characters, and its paranormal phenomena within this one disc.  The amount of information contained in there is incredible.  Some selections will drop down and play a key scene from an episode, while others will give you a picture and info about a subject.  The making-of features are also wonderful.  There are 3 different ones, one of which focuses all around the secrecy surrounding the filming of this movie.  How they kept the plot and script under wraps, steps they took to do this, security as far as internet leaks of information about it.  It's especially fun if you were a die hard fan, following this film's every step of production.  It brought back memories and let me know what the filmmakers knew about what we knew.  Another feature I absolutely loved was the gag reel.  It was about 10 minutes long (which is quite a bit of footage for a film) and many of the scenes in it were in HD, which I haven't seen with too many gag reels.

In short, this Blu-Ray is the finest I've ever owned, and it was well worth the few bucks more you pay to have all of these amazing features available to you, and all on one disc.  Chris and Frank have not only created a fine film, but a great disc for us to enjoy it on and play over and over again for years to come.  They've really given the fans what they want.

3489665,4,B001BCO8XQ,"The show was a huge phenomenon in the 90's, ""The X-Files"" was a show that delved into government conspiracies, the extraterrestrial, the supernatural and the downright creepy. The first five seasons were one of the best things to grace television in my opinion. Being an ""X-files"" fan, of course I would be rather curious as to how this new movie would pan out. The first film based on the series, ""X-Files: Fight the Future"" was tied into the series continuity--the second film, this time around is a more of a sci-fi drama aimed towards fan of the series. Chris Carter is at the helm as director of ""X-Files: I want to Believe"", and he takes aim at not aliens, ghouls and conspiracies but rather directly at religion and science.

Monica Bannon is an F.B.I. agent who disappears after a violent attack. The bureau of course takes care of its own and special agent Whitney (Amanda Peet) is assisted by a ""psychic"" named Joe who is also a former priest and a convicted pedophile. When the investigation gets to be a bit more than the usual detective work can handle, agent Whitney enlists the aid of former F.B.I. agent Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) to find her former partner Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) who specializes in the ""spooky"" cases in the past. Mulder lives as a recluse since he was stripped of his credibility and Scully is now a practicing doctor. The two are very reluctant to assists but they find themselves drawn to the mystery of father Joe (Billy Connolly)...

Now this is a review of the extended cut and since I haven't seen the theatrical release, please bear with me as I try to grapple with the film. Director Chris Carter does attempt at a fresh start as he sidesteps the temptation of making a movie with the same old stuff. The film's main premise is about religion and of course science--its abominations and advantages. Father Joe was a ""tainted"" priest looking for forgiveness and of course he is not a very credible source of information. There is a subtle commentary about redemption and the ease of hasty human judgments, the film does dawdle a little at these elements. The film also has a very provocative subject matter about the aberrations of science.

Carter uses Scully's new-found position as a practitioner of medicine to further emphasize medical science's advantages all the while focusing on its potential perversions. The film is a thematic affair, the film has some strong references to faith, religion and medical issues. ""I want to Believe.."" isn't preaching on those issues but it was very obvious that it was trying to appeal to one's skepticism and interest about those issues. The film does have a very interesting premise but I have to say the film's script was a tad unpolished and unrefined. Some elements' motivations are left to the audience's perception and does open some holes.

The film dwells on the Scully's and Mulder's reluctance to restart their former lives and the dialogue is filled with speeches that serves as exposition to the musings of the duo. While it is quite interesting to see Scully and Mulder deliver their usual discussions, it became a little too heavy-handed and the pace became a little too slow for my taste. I do understand Carter's sense of restraint; it is very difficult to awaken the characters' sense of passion and relentlessness in a 90+ minute film, that he needed to rely a little on familiarity. Carter did find the series' spirit and sense of pace but he played a little too safe and avoided taking any risks. Carter must've been concerned that he may lose control if he relied on intense scenes than character interaction. I `m not saying this as a negative comment but rather a simple observation.

""X-Files: I want to Believe"" does not offer any surprises, and it does come a little short on suspense and thrills. However, it was really fun to see Mulder and Scully scurry around amid the usual intrigue and controversy--it feels like ""old times"". The film doesn't add that much to the ""X-Files"" mythos and its execution is something we have seen before. The film does have its effective mystery and it emulated the tempo of the TV series; it does get under one`s skin in some ways. The faith and medical thing did manage to show good emotions. ""I want to Believe"" isn't as exciting an experience as I'd hoped it to be but at least I wasn't unhappy with Carter's intentions.

Recommended! [3  stars] Rounded up because of its sense of nostalgia.

A good creepy plot that keeps your interest from beginning to end. Far better than the first movie and as good as any of the TV episodes. BnB Beatles Depot,1228608000,,305,4.186440677966102

I guess my question would be is this movie just a prelude to what is to come? If so, then I think the movie did a good job and fans should be patient for better things to come. If not then I don't really know what the movie accomplished. If you were a fan of X Files I would recommend, just tame your expectations. Since I don't know what the answer to this question is yet, I will leave this review open. I can only hope, however unlikely, that Carter brings X Files back to network TV. Until then, Supernatural on the CW will in mind continue as the best Sci Fi show on tv and X Files will remain a distant memory.",1228608000,,779,3.9367088607594938
3489668,3,B001BCO8XQ,"Found the new X-files film to be pretty good.  It takes place after the series but beyond that it is a pretty stand-alone film that features our favorite paranormal sleuths, Scully and Mulder.

The landscape of a dark, blustery winter is great as it adds a tone of overall isolation to the film.  Scully and Mulder find themselves drug back out of the shadows of their new lives to face the dark that always finds them.  I didn't personally feel like the storyline involving the ""Father Joe"" character was very good...at times strong but at other times almost irrelevant.  Regardless, the mystery, intrigue and suspense are found throughout this film, and throw in the talented Amanda Peet and Xzibit as Federal Agents and you have a pretty diverse and fun supporting cast.

Still, the themes in the show are splendid as they really do center on the careers, decisions and love that Scully and Mulder have shared over the years.  As stated by others, this film was not created so much for the big screen as it was just another long, TV adaption...but don't let that scare you off, it still has all the fright and evil on ice that you can handle.",1228608000,,1145,4.610837438423645
3489669,4,B001BCO8XQ,"Stop right there if you think you're going to watch a movie with over-the-top explosions, gunshots every 10 minutes, and gratuitous special effects shots with space ships and aliens, all with overblown stakes and end-of-the-world implications. Mulder doesn't even ""crack wise"" like he used to. The X-Files: I Want to Believe is a movie for grown-ups. It is a quiet study of one of the great TV/cinema relationships of our time; a relationship that still makes you smile when you finally see them on screen again. They still crackle with chemistry even though they are long past the issues that kept you wondering if they would ever be together. Mulder and Scully are together and they go on a journey that tests their love and their faith in each other and those things for which faith was created.

The movie lacks a single explosion and, while I'm sure a gun was fired somewhere, I don't remember it. The film plays out, challenging you with moral quandaries and explicit, but never overbearing, religious questions that all struggle with at some point in their life. The phrase, ""I want to believe,"" isn't just for the supernatural or extraterrestrial; it is a phrase that defines the faithful and their daily struggles to do what they think is right.

The cast was wonderful. You never want to take your eyes off Billy Connolly as the pedophile ex-priest with psychic visions and both Xzibit and Amanda Peet are pleasant surprises. Of course, it's all about Duchovny and Anderson who still embody those characters. As they matured, so did their characters and it's reflected in the performances.

The movie is lacking in the mythology that made the X-Files famous but I'm of the thought that was no great loss. If you followed the show you know how convoluted and ridiculous it all got eventually. The X-Files: I Want to Believe is for fans who love Mulder and Scully and want to see how they've grown, as we have all grown. It's an effective thriller worthy of the X-Files and it's worth your time. The ending does lack something but you're so engrossed with the personal journeys and questions, you almost don't mind. The film has a small, independent feel, that creates a sense of intimacy and believability that was lacking in their first cinematic go-round. It's engorged with the eerie atmosphere that made the first 5 seasons of the show so interesting to look at and it's a welcome sight. Gone is a lot of the cheesiness brought on by the fantastical subject matter and the need to meet expectations. This is a quiet, grounded film. The movie has a lot of heart and it's supported on the weight of what we all really loved about the show once we all got past the fantasy: Mulder and Scully.

The X-Files defined a generation of paranoia, internet culture, and frivolous beliefs. We've all been shaken to our emotional cores since the X-Files was last on the air. We grew up. The X-Files: I Want to Believe is for us.

3489671,3,B001BCO8XQ,"Spoilers..........

This felt a lot more like a TV episode than a movie. There was nothing really earth-shattering going on, just some nasty experiments on dogs and humans, and a sidebar plot involving a corrupt priest who still receives visions and is trying to understand the nature of God.  Mulder and Scully try to understand it as well, especially since Scully is treating a very sick boy.
But back to my original point:  if you're going to make a sci fi thriller movie, make it BIG.  This was a nice little exercise in spiritual searching, but not much more.  I gave it three stars for Duchovny, Anderson, and the production design.
And gosh darn it, if you're going to bring in the talented Mitch Pileggi as Skinner, at least give him more than a minute or so of screen time!!",1228521600,,783,4.564285714285714

3489674,4,B001BCO8XQ,"An X-file: A case not solvable through normal means. In the FBI that once meant the tandem of Special Agent D. Scully and Spooky Fox Mulder but that is no longer the case. Now all you see when you look their way are two people the FBI has tried to discredit, one reclusive and somewhat ""on the run"" and the other working for Our Lady of Sorrow and trying to keep the darkness at bay, until a series of odd events hit the FBI. First an FBI agent disappears, then a priest who has fallen-from-grace sees visions, and then the ""discovery"" happens. After that, the FBI asks for help which Spooky is all-too-willing to give and which Skully is afraid will lead toward something - bad - again.

Since the beginning of the series, there have been cries for movies dealing with X-files. The first movie was met with mixed reviews (I liked it, personally, but understand if others did not) and the second is apparently doing the same. Personally, I really needed the extended edition to see everything that wanted to come out. The theatrical - yeah, but the rest - better. Other peoople still do not see this as enough and, in some ways, I see what they mean. A lot of time has passed for one thing, a lot of things have happened that are alluded to in the movie for another (I liked that myself), and sometimes listening to these people makes me think they wanted more than a movie. Listening alludes to a hope that the X-files would come back once more, a great and noble hope but one I do not see ever happening (sadly), and that viewers would once again bathe in the glory that was Rome - wait, I mean X-Files (sorry, after 9 seasons, it seemed like an empire). People also complained about the content, saying it did not have their favorite little beasties from the series, and I'm not sure I agree with that. Personally, I wanted a show by Carter that had my two main tastes, an X-File story that involved a question of some sort, and something I could say that ""I want to believe"" in. Some aspects of the priest make that problematic for some, time makes that hard for others, and the lack of gray friends gets people made as well. Still, everyone kinda knew this would happen from the beginning: there are always going to be people who do not like a new X-Files movie.

In some places I do agree that there were some unneeded areas. I really did not need so much questioning when it came to the ""what if"" with our seer, and I really didn't need to have Mulder second-questioned so much. It did have its place, however, and did not hurt the movie. The acting was also top notch (as expected) and I watched with eyes glued, trying not to miss anything, Combine this with extras like digital download, some music I was not so keen on from Xhibit, a pretty funny gag reel, explanations of prosthetics, and commentary and you have a nice little movie. How much of one - much like the series, people could never agree on what episodes they liked the most, much less what the movie should contain.
Watch it for yourself and, if you enjoy X-files, watch it with a mind awash with a want for nothing save a rare treat most of us never thought would happen (its almost an X-file, if you look at it in that right).
Enjoyable.",1228435200,,3213,4.380234505862647

(wow)  Same problem.  Since it does play in the DVD player it's a keeper.  The movie disk does well in both the computer and the dvd player.",1228435200,,406,4.128205128205129
3489676,4,B001BCO8XQ,"A lot has been made of the fact that ""The X-Files:  I Want to Believe"" is not a mytharc movie (like ""The X-Files:  Fight the Future""), but is instead in the tradtion of the standalone or ""monster-of-the-week"" episodes that made up two-thirds of the series.  And as a monster-of-the-week, the monster in question in this movie is not particularly scary.  That said, ""The X-Files"" not only had two basic formats for the show, but individual episodes also had several different dominant themes, from humor (""The Post-Modern Prometheus,"" ""Jose Chung's 'From Outer Space',"" ""Small Potatoes,"" ""How the Ghosts Stole Christmas,"" ""Bad Blood,"" etc.) to character development and backstory (""Musings of a Cigarette Smoking Man,"" ""Unusual Suspects,"" ""Travelers,"" ""Emily,"" ""all things,"" etc.) to explorations of Christian faith (""Miracle Man,"" ""Revelations,"" ""Beyond the Sea,"" ""All Souls,"" and the fantastic, Flannery O'Connoresque ""Signs and Wonders."")

A lot of people forget about the religiously-themed episodes of the show, which is a shame because they were some of the best-written and acted of the entire series.

""The X-Files:  I Want to Believe"" falls squarely into the category of the character development and religious-themed standalone episodes, which is a disappointment for those who were looking for either aliens and government conspiracies or for those who were wanting blood and guts and weird autopsies.  And it doesn't always live up to the high standards of the best of the best episodes in these genres:  the psychic psycho was done better by Brad Dourif in ""Beyond the Sea,"" the questions of what to do about a dying child were better and more deftly handled in ""Emily"" and ""All Souls.""

What it DOES do well is believeably show us what the two main characters are like when they've been deprived of their main raison d'etre (both for going on separately and for being together) for six years.  While newcomers could certainly follow the plot of ""I Want to Believe,"" this is probably not going to be nearly as interesting to someone who didn't watch the show for several seasons.

But...it's still pretty damn good, both as a movie and as a further installment in the series, and credit needs to be given to Gillian Anderson for not so much playing Scully as channeling her.  (I've seen Anderson on talk shows and in a few other roles since ""The X-Files,"" and she's neither anything like Scully nor a one-trick pony.)",1228435200,,2429,5.057644110275689

I suggest you rent it first as to me this one isn't worth owning unless you are a huge fan of the series. I bought all but the last two seasons which I didn't care for and I got the first movie since it was good. This movie isn't as much a stretch of the imagination as they track down a killer that is harvesting organs for stem cell research with the assistance of a clairvoyant pedophile. There is one Frankenstein type operation that is more like the original series. Other than that is fairly straight forward FBI case. It didn't help they waited so long for another movie, but they should have come up with a better story. If you enjoyed this catch the ""X-Files"" TV series on DVD.

3489678,3,B001BCO8XQ,"It's been 10 years since the first X-Files movie, The X-Files - Fight the Future came out and with the iconic show long since vanished from the airwaves, it came as quite a shock to hear last year that a follow-up had finally been green lighted. I was a big fan of the series and of Fight the Future, which I felt got short shrift from movie audiences at the time and should been more widely recognized for the quality production it was. But like most of us I was disappointed to hear that the new film, subtitled I Want to Believe, wouldn't focus on aliens or the global conspiracy to cover-up the presence of same but would instead be what the fans used to call a ""Monster of the Week"" episode. That is, a standalone piece that wouldn't advance the show's over-arching mythology.

Fox evidently was willing to take a shot at reviving the franchise as long as it could be made on a low budget. As a result, there are no city sized alien spacecraft, huge sets or dazzling special effects. This movie simply updates us on what's happened to Scully and Mulder in the six years since the show went off the air.

As a character study, the movie works well. Both main characters have long since abandoned the FBI and Mulder is in hiding, although it seems the FBI isn't trying very hard to find him. They're brought back into the FBI fold when a case with supernatural overtones has the investigating agents baffled. Scully at first encourages Mulder to jump back into the fight, seeing that he's wasting away hiding in her house. But she's soon reminded of all the reasons why it was so painful to work with him before; his obsessive belief in the paranormal, his still unresolved guilt over his sister's alien abduction and the darkness that inevitably descends upon their lives once he re-engages with his old mindset at the FBI.

Scully, now working as a medical doctor, herself struggles with her faith in god, evidently shaken by her experiences with Mulder and her time at the FBI. She is challenged by the case of a young boy with a fatal illness which can only be cured by a desperate and hellish experimental treatment. She is encouraged in this effort by Father Joe, a defrocked catholic priest who has psychic visions that Mulder believes can lead him to the serial killer the FBI seeks. It's very interesting to watch Mulder and Scully change roles and perspectives throughout the movie.

There are also some very nice scenes between Duchovny and Anderson, who know these characters so well that they actually do seem to be like a married couple. When Scully threatens to leave Mulder if he pursues the case and his relationship with Father Joe any further, we don't believe it and neither do the characters. It's clear in the performances that these two people have too much history together and too much left undone in their lives to leave each other. Mulder can't crack the case without Scully's scientific insights, and Sully can't save the young boy without Mulder's unyielding faith in her and in something greater than either of them. The final scenes are made up of the standard physical confrontation with evil, but for once it doesn't involve guns and a clichd shootout.

The supporting cast in generally excellent, but Amanda Peet and rapper Xzibit play roles that are essentially clones of the Monica Reyes and John Doggett characters from the last few seasons of the show, so why not just use them? It's possible that Robert Patrick and Anabeth Gish were too expensive, but it would have been a nice tie-in nonetheless. Callum Keith Rennie, who plays the ""Leoben"" Cylon on Battlestar Galactica, is generally wasted in what could have been a very creepy role.

Overall the film has a very dark, Millennium-esque look and feel to it, and I can't help thinking that the production could have used a dose of Frank Black and a more paranormal angle to liven things up. Still, it was nice to catch up with Mulder and Scully after all these years, and I suspect that was the intention all along. The story was less important than what it put the characters through.

In the end, Mulder and Scully face the reality that they can't hide from who they are and what they do any longer, and it's clear that if the film makes money there will be another sequel.

uh, anyway- My thinking is this..
without direct spoilers: the crime story had nearly no arc- FBI agent disappears, who is it?  Who knows, who cares!  Not a member of the X-Files team, which would at least get your attention, and the fact that it's a character with no background or motives should tell you where this film is going... there's NO surprises, betrayals, or flip-flops regarding what was going on, typical to an episode of the X-Files.

You see something awful happening, you think maybe there's conspiracies going on in the background or it isn't what it looks like.. nope. It's scary yet oddly motiveless bad guys muttering in russian without subtitles. Father Joe is a great character, and completely overshadowed the boring bad guys (and once or twice, everybody in the film).  West Virgina was made to look like Siberia for some reason.. they should've set the action in Colorado.  Glacial winters aren't a trademark of the Virginias.  Too much snow in the visuals, not enough Snow in the soundtrack.  Mark Snow.  Some of the background music, particularly in Father Joe's trance scenes was just Off.  Wrong mood, wrong speed.  Too quick/techno spooky.

Scully and Mulders musings about life would've made a great coda to the series without the rest of this movie.  And as usual, Gillian Anderson steals the fire in most of their scenes.. and she's aged better.

Love the show and loved Fight the Future, but Chris Carter shouldn't direct.  This is the absolute least amount of love for the fans I've seen from this group.  It's like they're saying 'we've moved on, why haven't you?'

3489688,4,B001BCO8XQ,"Here's where I stand on THE X-FILES: I was a fan of the show for the first couple of seasons when every episode was different (remember the Jersey Devil episode and the one about the deformed redneck family?) and before it got really heavy into the same continuous storyline, and I saw the first X-FILES movie a couple of times when it first came out but it's been so long that I barely remember it. So I did enjoy the show, however I wouldn't consider myself a hardcore fan and I wouldn't go so far as to say that this was a highly anticipated movie for me. So, with that out of the way...

In THE X-FILES: I WANT TO BELIEVE, Mulder (David Duchovny) is living in seclusion and Scully (Gillian Anderson) is now a doctor. They are reunited when the FBI seeks them out for help to find a fellow agent who has gone missing. Mulder and Scully, along with the help of the FBI (with the two primary agents being portrayed by Amanda Peet and rapper Xzibit) and a goofy psychic named Father Joe (portrayed by Billy Connolly), eventually find clues that lead them to something gruesome and disturbing.

Throughout the movie there is a subplot where Scully is going through an ordeal at the hospital she works at involving a sick child who she is trying to save, the child's family, and the ""powers that be"" of the hospital who refuse to offer any further treatment for the child due to the fact that he suffers from an incurable disease. For most of the FBI investigation, Scully is absent and is faced with the dilemma of going through a radical medical procedure (stem cell) which may or may not help the child but will surely cause him a lot of pain. And then there's the Father Joe character who, while somewhat annoying at first, ultimately won me over due to actor Billy Connolly's charm. Father Joe is interesting in that he has a haunting past and is judged because of it, claims that God talks to him and gives him these psychic visions, and no one believes him except for Mulder.

Overall I enjoyed this film a lot! I really had no desire to see it, and actually decided to watch it just to see Xzibit in a ""serious role"". This film surprised me and kept my interest throughout. The entire film was definitely a throwback to the first seasons of the show in which they had the whole ""Monster of the Week"" thing going on which I mentioned earlier. It's basically a standalone Sci-Fi/Thriller with elements of Horror. The chemistry between Duchovny and Anderson is awesome and it's always great to see them back together on screen. Amanda Peet and Xzibit were both pretty good in their roles. It's sort of hinted in the movie that Peet's character has a thing for Mulder, but it never really goes anywhere for reasons I can't really talk about without ruining the movie. Xzibit was more of a background guy who didn't say a whole lot, who's character had a thick exterior to contrast Peet's more easy-going demeanor. And of course Connolly was great as always.

Another thing that I loved about the movie was the Cinematography. It was filmed in Canada during the winter and the snowy scenery and photography in the film was gorgeous. There aren't really any bad things about the movie that I can really think of. The lack of a major villain was a bit disappointing, but the twist at the end more than makes up for it. Obviously I won't say what the twist is, but it most definitely treads the waters of the Horror genre. Also the film isn't really as epic as a TV show-turned-feature length film should be and seemed like it could have been a longer version of a TV episode. Other than that, it was great. Entertaining, great cast, great acting, beautiful Cinematography, great music, nostalgia, and a twist that will satisfy Horror fans. There's also a little something special during the closing credits (with two songs provided by U.N.K.L.E. including a remix of the X-FILES theme) which is kind of cheesy but is still pretty cool to watch.

I've only seen the 1-Disc Version of the DVD so far and the Extra Features are OK. It has a great Commentary track by writer/director Chris Carter and writer Frank Spotnitz. There is also a ten minute Gag Reel, which by the looks of it the cast had a blast making the film. Overall, it's a great film and I would definitely recommend it.

4 stars

EDIT: The 2-Disc Version has the same Extra Features as the 1-Disc version, but the second disc has a feature-length Documentary on the production of the movie that covers everything from the cast, to the filming, to reuniting the cast and crew, and the secrecy of the movie. It's actually really interesting when they talk about how secretive they were during the filming to the point that some of the crew didn't even KNOW they were working on the new X-FILES movie. Another thing that is brought up is how they leaked staged photos of a Werewolf prop on the set to throw people off. Includes interviews with the cast and crew and Behind-the-Scenes footage. I would recommend spending the few extra bucks to get the Special Edition as opposed to the 1-Disc. It's worth it.",1228003200,,5067,4.543263964950712

movie out on it's shelves.  The single disc pkg. pictured above contains
both the theater and directors' cuts of the movie!  This is a great bonus
for all X-Files fans.

  The movie is decent, but I was left wanting more.  Since it has been
so many years since a show/movie was seen.  Mulder is a recluse living
off by himself, reminding you of a discarded old school agent who
stepped on too many toes at the F.B.I.  A current agent reaches out to
him for help.  One of her own is missing with very little clues to go on.
A limb has been found but there is no body, a psychic may know of her
where abouts.  Is the psychic for real?  Agent Mulder is brought in to
see if he is for real.  Fox then reaches out for Agent Scully, ""Scully I
need you on this one!""

  M.D. Scully has been working at a Catholic hospital where she appears
to be working on neuro patients.  She agrees to meet w/Mulder and the
chase is on.  This turns out to be a serial killer case with a few
twists.  The ending is interesting in development, a comment on science
and research.  Mulder places himself in danger - seeking the truth.
Scully saves the day, while a former priest/psychic seeks salvation.",1228003200,,1244,4.261802575107296

Maybe that's why I had a good degree of surprise when I heard about creator Chris Carter getting things together for another X-Files film, and even more so when I learned that it would be more akin to the classic, stand-alone episodes that helped define what made the series so great to begin with.  Despite many of the negative reviews that it received, The X-Files: I Want to Believe is a worthwhile endeavor for fans of the show, and while not perfect by any means, still manages to satisfy.  The film picks up with Mulder (David Duchovny) and Scully (Gillian Anderson) apart and out of the FBI, until both are drawn back in with a case involving a former priest (Billy Connolly) who claims to have visions when an Agent goes missing under mysterious circumstances.  There's no conspiracy abound, just a plot involving some horrific science gone wrong and belief, and the film is all the better for it.  The usual cast of X-Files alums aren't present sadly, but Mitch Pileggi does return briefly as FBI director Skinner, and Amanda Peet and rapper Xzibit are on board as the FBI Agents that being Mulder and Scully into the fold.  All in all, The X-Files: I Want to Believe is an enjoyable film that is a worthwhile trip for lovers of the show, and just seeing Mulder and Scully together again makes it essential viewing alone.",1227916800,,1483,4.619771863117871

I don't know how to define the people who liked the movie and those who didn't, probably people that knew the series on a very shallow way, went to the cinemas expecting something sort of independence day and just couldn't bare the small personal CGI-less work of art they had in front.
No, the movie is not perfect but it was a sweet bold move, and just getting to see Fox and Dana together and how they managed to stick together was well worth the wait, the ticket fee and the pounding by non fans.
Let's face it, if we would've gotten a 2012 end of times alien invasion X-Files movie, all of us real fans would be complaining in a certain way that we were not able to see what happened between 9th season and 2012.
This was the logical movie to get (Provided they do a third one, PLEASE SAY YES 20th century fox!)
I don't remember seeing other TV or movie characters aging so well, being so multidimensional in their own.
I felt X-Files was the movie of the season for me, (Batman was the blockbuster of the year but that doesn't make it the best, don't get me wrong I loved Dark knight)of course I am a big X-Files fan, but I still feel non biased in my appreciation of the movie.

3489692,4,B001BCO8XQ,"""The X-Files: I Want to Believe"" travels with a lot of baggage. It is not a sequel in style, tone or plot to the previous ""X-Files (Fight the Future)"" movie from 1998. That mess (halfway through its television run) involved black alien blood, swarms of bees, and a supply of government conspiracies equaled only by the number of black helicopters chasing agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully through cornfields. It's also less a new episode of the series than it is a religious horror flick that could easily have hit theaters sometime between ""Rosemary's Baby"" and ""The Omen."" Shots are fired and villains chased. But this is still an intimate, atmospheric film where the plot hinges more on one character pressing the resume button on a printer. A later equally dramatic moment occurs when a roadside mailbox, whose numbers match those of a specific Bible verse, is opened.

Instead of hunting for aliens, the FBI has more Earth-bound crimes to be solved and hopes to lure Mulder back to duty to save the life of a missing female agent, who may be the victim of a serial killer. The bureaus' only leads are the visions of Joe Crissman, who has led them to a severed arm. But the mental images are less likely to be trusted as he's a defrocked priest and convicted pedophile. As Scully (now a staff physician at Our Lady of Sorrows) notes, it's hard to accept that God is sending lifesaving information and/or ""answering the prayers of a man who's been accused of buggering 37 altar boys.""

There are a number of unbelievable things in a saga like this (i.e., what's contained in an organ donor bag/mystery box, the subjects of top secret Russian medical experiments ). Naturally, they are the scary items that always appear in such dreadful places.

Father Joe wants to believe that his grotesque past can be the subject of redemption if he is being used by God as an extraordinary vessel to save a life. Scully wants to believe that using stem cells in a dangerous and painful surgery can save the life of Christian, her young patient with Sandhoff disease, a terminal brain condition.

The darkness continues to pull Mulder away from Scully. (What ""Spooky"" Mulder's been doing since 2002 and how his former coworker Scully locates him are the true shock of the film.) But it's the story's titular ""beliefs"" and optimism that draw all of its characters into the light.",1227312000,,2368,4.740291262135922
3489693,4,B001BCO8XQ,"Having never watched a single episode of Chris Carter's ""The X-Files"" or the 1998 feature film, I was relieved when I discovered that the newest addition to the series did not require any previous knowledge of the popular franchise. ""The X-Files: I Want to Believe"" can truly hold its own against any other crime thriller out there. Instead of building on preexisting plot points, the audience is totally submersed into a brand new story and while I am sure David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson's portrayals of agents Fox Mulder and Dana Skully are consistent with any previous work, their performances are fresh and very much alive on screen.

In a refreshing twist, the film takes place in a world not too far removed from the present day. Unlike the parallel universe that many movies situate themselves (which looks like the real world but features a never ending parade of explosions, gunfire, and high-speed car chases), Mulder and Skully's latest case is very much rooted in reality, making the events of the plot more horrifying than it would have otherwise.

The plot itself is a macabre jig-saw puzzle that had me riveted from the very first scene, which sees a withering, seemingly delusional old man named Father Joe (Bill Connolly) leading a team of FBI agents through a vast field of snow and ice. A severed human arm is found and a bizarre collection of other clues eventually take them to one of the most horrifying villains' lairs I have seen. Complicating things even further is a series of subplots concerning the disappearance of two young women, the constant involvement of the FBI, the questionable past of a conflicted pedophile who claims to have psychic abilities, the plight of one of Dana's diseased patients, and a team of Eastern European medical workers whose contributions to science are considerably less than honorable.

Compared to last year's selection of summer movies (which included the disappointing  sequels to the ""Spider-Man"", ""Shrek"", and ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" franchises), this year has proven itself to be a far more competent season. With the exception of a few, every movie I have seen these past few months have featured rich storytelling and bold characterizations as well as underlying messages that stimulate the mind and invite interesting conversation long after the credits have rolled. It's safe to say that my belief in the summer blockbuster has been restored.",1226880000,,2421,5.045
3489694,3,B001BCO8XQ,"One good news about ""The X Files: I Want to Believe,"" second feature-length film based on the TV series (1993-2002) is that Mulder and Scully are back, with their chemistry intact. Naturally David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson look older, but their characters haven't essentially changed since the last time we saw them together on TV. Mulder is still a believer of the paranormal phenomena while Scully is a skeptic who is somehow attracted to Mulder's belief and, more importantly, Mulder as a man. If you are looking forward to seeing these two beloved characters (and I believe most people would), the new film is fairly entertaining.

Bad news is, ""The X Files: I Want to Believe,"" directed by Chris Carter himself, doesn't have a story that really interests us. Billy Connolly plays a retired (and once convicted) priest who, he claims, can see things with his supernatural powers. He actually finds something that might prove his abilities and Amanda Peet's agent, together with Mulder who is called back to duty by FBI, investigates a case of another agent who is missing for more than three days. Scully, who is now working at a hospital as a doctor, rather reluctantly joins them. Everything in the story looks as if they are borrowed from somewhere else, except the two main characters.

Actually, it seems Chris Carter is more interested in showing us Mulder and Scully, focusing their relationships, than following the case of a missing agent for which they are called back again on screen. His decision is understandable - after all the original TV series worked because of their characters - but still the film which obviously needs a more compelling story also spends considerable time following the sub-plot about a patient in the hospital where Scully works. Carter's direction only slows down the pace of the film, and the slower pace only exposes the plot holes in the weak script.

Some people complain that the film doesn't have UFOs or conspiracy theories, but to me the real problem of the film is the lack of mystery and coherent storyline. I know this is not an action film, but as you know, having a more engaging story does not hurt.",1226620800,,2161,4.850948509485095

The only charateristic of the ""body"" they were working on was that he/she/it had curiously black fingernails (which the camera made a slow deliberate pan down the arm to). The CSM? Unlikely.

My favorite parts were the ones between Mulder and Scully, to see how they're relationship had progressed and to see that they are human and get older. And there are hints of Scully's desire for their child...I really hope Chris Carter will do another independent movie to answer maybe that desire for them to see their son.

3489702,2,B001BCO8XQ,"This is such a hard movie for me to review because I love X-Files so much. After nine brilliant years worth of solid episodes, we are treated to a bleak snow-covered drama about missing FBI agents, pedophile priests, and Mulder and Scully discussing their relationship over and over again like love-struck teenagers.

The plot is kind of irrelevant.  I mean really, any excuse to see Mulder and Scully again is worth the price of admission.  Problem is, I think Chris Carter and friends took that literally and slapped together a rejected script from season 4 (or 5, 6, or 7) and stretched it into a movie that couldn't possibly survive a summer release.  On a side note, I think they should have released this movie in the fall, it probably would have done better at the box office given the bleak setting and atmosphere.

Back to the film... Days after watching ""I Want To Believe"" in the theater I had to admit that I did not like it at all.  All Mulder and Scully did was yap on and on about their relationship and the return of the ""darkness,"" referring to Mulder's quest in the TV series as some horrible period they suffered through (I guess that could be argued).

There's even a subplot involving a terminally ill boy that Scully puts all her faith and effort in that I could not possibly care less about. Everything about the movie was depressing, from Mulder's isolated ""unabomber"" lifestyle, to Scully's bleak and miserable hospital. And the neverending snow! Whose idea was that?? I don't even think ""Jeremiah Johnson"" had that much snow.

If you're a die-hard fan, ""I Want To Believe"" is mandatory viewing. The plot and setting may be atrocious, but hey... we get to see Mulder and Scully again! I would have been far more entertained watching them b.s. for two hours at a coffee shop in downtown D.C. In summary, casual viewers should watch the original series.

There are 3 plots going on, Scully and Mulder's relationship, Scully trying to save a little boy, and Mulder helping the FBI to locate a missing agent kidnapped by a modern day Frankenstein. I was glad to see Skinner, I liked his part. I was disappointed to hear Amanda Peat was cast because I can't stand her, but I was pleasantly surprised, in this I actually really liked her! I think she was my favorite character. The role suited her well. She seemed to have the hots for Mulder. I am so disappointed with the direction they took her character toward the end.

I really didn't like the pedophile character. They make me nauseous. Plus the pedophile was kind of one of the good guys.???? Never in my book!
I think this episode was important because we see that they are no longer fugitives, and they are in a solid relationship. Now that we have all that out of the way, in the next movie I would like to see something about their son. Overall I think the movie should have had a better plot and way better special effects.

3489706,4,B001BCO8XQ,"The most underrated film of the summer? I think so. Maybe people were expecting aliens, i don't know, but the movie is not as nearly as bad as some make it out to be.

I got into the fantastic show only 2 years ago, so maybe it's fresher in my mind about what the X-Files is all about. It's not a CGI mess, nothing like that. It's a verbal thinking movie where you have to actually watch the film instead of waiting for high tech explosions that you see in movies like 'The Dark Knight'. It's always what X-Files was, and it's the same with this movie.

The story is not as bad as others make it out to be as well. Maybe not supernatural or paranormal(there was a physic however), but more of a freaky type of story. Also, it's about Mulder and Scully just as much. It's what the X-Files has become.. and it's really played out well. The acting from the two is great, anyone saying otherwise is wrong. Some complain that series favorites didn't show up. Well, this isn't a mythology(alien) movie.. and that's where you would see them. We did however get to see Skinner again, which was great.

The only downer about the film is that there's moments that seem slow, and this movie definately could have benefited from another month of production. Don't blame that on Chris Carter though, as FOX is the ones that wanted the movie out a week after 'The Dark Knight'.

This movie is highly underrated, and deserves more credit then people are giving it. It's about Mulder and Scully, and that's the joust of what we got. Be appreciative that they came back, because it could be the last time you see them again. I guess the only thing I can suggest is go into watching the movie not expecting much, and I think you'll be surprised. Hopefully an XF3 is made... but we'll see.

There is no trace of the X-Files ""spirit"" anywhere to be found among the tedious and downright coma inducing story line.  Gone are the charismatic characters you loved from the series and in their place you'll find robotic actors delivering their lines as if they were dragged kicking and screaming back into these roles.  You could've substituted any characters into the roles here, Mulder and Scully need not apply.  It honestly wouldn't have made a difference.  I'm not trying to be a film snob here, but I just can't help shaking my head trying to fathom why this movie needed to be created.  Why on earth bring back two of television's most iconic characters then do nothing with them that makes them who they are?

I own all of the X-files box sets as well as the first movie on DVD.  However, I cannot imagine purchasing this movie, nor do I have any desire to put myself through the agonizing boredom of watching it again just because I'm a fan.  ""I Want To Believe"" that despite a July release date-this movie was Chris Carter's April Fool's Day joke to his fans and that the real movie is still waiting somewhere on a shelf for us to enjoy.....",1222387200,,1885,4.513274336283186

The film follows FBI agents in their search for a missing agent. They are aided by a man, a priest of questionable morals, who has visions. They bring in Mulder and Scully, now a surgeon (since when?!) to help them in their investigation. If Mulder helps, all will be forgiven (a bit of a stretch since he was charged by the military for murder after all). Regardless, our favorite couple discovers a sinister plan that will make you cringe.

Amanda Peet is the FBI Agent that brings Mulder in. Her character could have been better used. Skinner makes an appearance!

The movie was sinister, evil, spooky and just plain wrong. It was great! To top is all off: Mulder and Scully. There is nothing bad we can say about their acting and their portrayals...they own these characters, they created them, and made them the memorable characters we like. The direction was excellent, with amazing long shots and beautiful photography. The great musical score was done by Mark Snow, who else would have been better for this?!

It was great just to see these two back on the screen. It's unfortunate that Fox decided to release this a week after Dark Knight came out. This movie screamed an October release date, right from the very start. I'm not going to give anyhting away, and I'm surprised that I didn't know more than I did. Don't expect the last movie, in fact don't expect much and I think you'll enjoy it more.",1222128000,,521,4.22
3489716,5,B001BCO8XQ,"Mulder and Scully are back...and that's incredibly awesome!!!
I think it was a shame this movie didn't get the attention it deserved when it was  released. I believe that the studio's poor promotion and the unfortunate date of release --THE DARK NIGHT's SUMMER-, among other external conditions didn't help it attract more viewers. But now that this fantastic 3-disc edition is here, there is no earthly excuse to not watch Mulder's and Scully's triumphal return.

Give this movie a chance if:

1)You were a fan back in the 90's --oH THOSE HAPPY DAYS!--.
2)You are sick of flat  characters who never actually grow up, grow old and /or mature.
3)You are in the mood for an intelligent little movie and you have had your share of CGI and exaggerated action sequences -that, let's face it, turn out to be a whole lot of nonsense most of the times-.
4)You want to be captivated by 2 of the most representative characters in TV history.

Give it a try, re-watch some of the tv series'episodes, get in the mood and enjoy!! Remember the Truth is out there...and we want to find it in a third movie. I waited 6 years for this one, I hope I won't be waiting that much for an XF3!!!

Note: If you watched the movie in the theatre and thought the storyline had some slight plotholes, check out the DVD edition of the film. This is REALLY the film Carter wanted to give us. Few extra scenes give a subtle but meaningful enhancement.",1222041600,,1420,4.52734375
3489717,2,B001BCO8XQ,"The first 20 minutes are curiosity provoking but the rest left me saying to myself ""So what?"".

**** SPOILER. DO NOT READ this if you HAVE NOT WATCHED the movie.

The remaining of the film is far-fetched, not suspenseful and dragging.
In North America, there's no group of people who are systematically killing others to get parts for transplants. It's because they'll be investigated by police very soon. It might happen in other countries like China where there were reports body parts of executed prisoners were collected for transplants paid by foreigners. I personally know  the relative of a person who went to China to get a transplant. He did not have time to wait for it to be done in North America. The source of the transplant organ was unknown.

Besides, the action scenes are like TV shows. There's no excitement.

The film also drags in many scenes. It seems they tried to make an one-hour TV show longer to fill up 100 minutes.

It's worth seeing once for curiosity",1221782400,,980,4.701754385964913
3489718,5,B001BCO8XQ,"Let's start with a few questions that we all ponder throughout the course of our lives:

If God is benevolent, why do people--children in particular--suffer? Can people who commit evil acts truly be redeemed? When does our faith in science and medicine reach its limits? Is faith in our loved ones always enough to keep us together?

This film is about the lifelong struggle with faith in all areas of our lives. It's about the constant battle to believe in a higher power, in those we love, in extreme possibilities, in ourselves.

The X-Files: I Want to Believe is a wonderful movie. It's beautifully filmed; the snowscapes are gorgeous. And it's quite thrilling to have a movie that isn't drowning in CGI. Mark Snow did a fantastic job on the score--buy that, too! And, honestly, it does not get any better than David and Gillian on screen together.

I saw this movie 10 times at the theater, which a lot of people find strange. But I don't see it as being any different than watching episodes of the show multiple times, which we've all done. I don't understand why all the people who watched the show didn't support this movie at the box office. Was it becaue it didn't deal with the mythology? Well, you've got slim chance of getting a mythology movie when you don't support this one. Was it because the film focuses on Mulder and Scully's relationship? This makes no sense to me because without that relationship--in all the forms it's taken through the years--there would be no X-Files. Was it because it's been six years since the show ended? I thought this would only help the movie (since the overall state of pop culture has gone steadily downhill since then), but I guess I put too much faith in other fans' loyalty.

I can only hope that all the people who didn't support this movie at the box office will buy multiple copies of the DVD to make up for it. If you only saw this once and were underwhelmed, I encourage you to give it a second chance--it only gets better with repeated viewings!

In the end, if the last image I have of Mulder and Scully is their fleeing the darkness, miles adrift from anyone else and inches away from each other...well, I can't ask for more than that.

(But, for the record, I'd pay money to watch those two clean their bathroom!)

Endless thanks to Chris Carter, Frank Spotnitz, David Duchovny, and Gillian Anderson (and the extended XF family) for this movie and everything that preceded it. I hope that this is not the end...",1221782400,,2475,4.583710407239819

Highly recommend the book for deeper insight as well, explains even better the story while you can still get a copy.  No Titanic though Siskel and Ebert gave it 3.5 of 4 stars, maybe you will like it and want to read the book, too.  Some critics say is like the TV show, is what they tried to do, yes.

The story caught me right away, and I felt like I was back in the hey-day of the X-Files again.  No, there isn't any big impressive special effects, but that is what I liked most about this one.  Its strength comes from solid acting a captivating story.  I felt it was even better than the last X-Files movie.
So, don't listen to the negative reviews by people who I think were just dissapointed that there aren't any aliens.  Also, don't pay attention to the low box-office performance.  Remember that this movie came out a week after The Dark Knight, which broke many box-office records.  Such a release date was a death sentence, because no one was going to be able to compete with Batman.  That doesn't mean The X-Files was bad, just the opposite in the fact.  All it means is that everyone preferred to go see Batman (which was also a great movie).

3489723,5,B001BCO8XQ,"I decided to wait until the second time I'd seen the movie before writing a review, because very often I'll love a movie at the first showing--especially one I've really looked forward to--then dislike it the more I see it.  I just got back from my second viewing of ""XF: IWTB"" three days after the first and love it even more.  Chris Carter knows what his ""shipper"" fans want, and he gave it to us in droves as promised.
First, let me say that the base story is the weak link; unlike the monster-of-the-week episodes this was supposed to be akin to there was no disbelief in ""it"", more disbelief in its messenger, a pedophile ex-priest played stunningly by the Scottish comedian Billy Connolly.  Also a bit on the heavy-handed side is how Scully urges Mulder to help with this case then unexpectedly does a one-eighty and wants him to quit before the victims are found one way or another.  Last but never least, the one bad actor was the rapper Xzibit, who was a wooden one-dimensional character; Amanda Peet wasn't bad but wasn't good either.  But other than those mild gripes this movie was incredibly acted and filmed.  And well worth waiting six years for, IMHO.
The movie is stunningly shot and photographed, and smoothly edited as well.  Even if the mountains of Vancouver are a bit tall to double for the softer West Virginia hills the locations were excellent and, as always, the set dressing among the best I've ever seen in TV or movies.  I think I caught most of the deliberate homages to people and names from the series, but I'll keep watching to see if I can find more.
The base story, which Carter and crew worked so hard and successfully to hide during production, deals with a psychic priest who is trying to help the FBI find a kidnapped agent.  The agent in charge (Amanda Peet) decides that she needs Mulder's help and so Scully is contacted, since she's not underground but working as a doctor in a Catholic hospital very interestingly named ""Our Lady of Sorrows"".
  When you first see Scully go to Mulder, it appears that he's hidden away in a remote house with a rickety but dangerous-looking gate, clipping odd articles out of the paper and huddling in his messy study--my first assumption was that he'd gone ""Conspiracy Theory"" for a bit.  He's wearing a beard and longer hair which I found attractive but definitely made him look a little less Mulder-ish.  But the very first thing I noticed is that the charisma between the two actors/characters was still there, they still had that same dynamic that made them so watchable in the 1990s.  The next thing I noted was the absence of the old sexual tension between them, but they were clearly together at the end of the series so I found that normal--but I immediately assumed that they were no longer together and that Scully was visiting him at his house.
Just a few scenes later you see Scully laying awake in her bed (with a comforter that has UFOs on it!) and then you hear Mulder's voice and when finally he sits up behind her I wanted to cheer and clap.  After nine years of caring about these characters, I was so happy that Carter had decided to have them be together.
But it wasn't to last.
While Mulder wants Scully to help him solve the case, she is both revolted by the pedophile priest who is the key and involved in trying to save a young patient's life that everyone else has given up on.  This causes problems in their relationship that I had a little trouble buying, but I think it was more because the whole situation between them was rushed rather than fully explained--I suspect there was some editing for time done there that would explain it better.
Mulder runs off to try and help solve the case, Scully stays to help her patient and also goes to see Father Joe, who has said something to her that she doesn't understand: ""Don't give up"".  Does he mean her patient?  On Mulder, who is admittedly being a bit of a selfish jerk at this point?  Or on the case itself?
Gillian Anderson really shines in these scenes, although she is stunning and letter-perfect from start to finish.  Her struggles are clearly shown on her face, and looks between she and Duchovny speak volumes in every scene they share.  While he is a fine actor in his own right, Anderson steals the movie from him--and everyone else for that matter, although Connolly does give her a run for her money with his anguished Fr. Joe.
It's around this time that the core plot is revealed--it's those wacky Russians swapping out body parts to keep a rich guy alive.  Boooo-ring.  I wish it'd have been the werewolf, now that would have been cool.
The final scene between Mulder and Scully after the mystery is solved is the real payoff of the movie, far more than the actual base story--and for those who don't know, don't leave until after the credits because they give us one last smile.
The music by Mark Snow is just incredible, fitting every scene perfectly, and I bought the soundtrack the moment I got home.  I particularly like the song that plays during the credits.
Last but never least, I bought the struggle between faith and science/reality without a qualm even though I'm an atheist and don't share the core beliefs of this movie at all.  It's so good to be back with these characters and the storyline is so central to their lives that it worked, and worked well for me.
As I write this, the movie is not doing well at the box office and it's looking dismal for another one, which all involved have said they want to make.  But I remember how badly the first ""Star Trek"" movie did and look how that franchise evolved; maybe we'll get lucky here.  In the meantime, I plan to see this at least once or twice more before it ends its theater run and am already looking forward to the DVD, which promises all sorts of goodies.  I want to believe, too.",1221436800,,5820,4.5224022878932315
3489724,2,B001BCO8XQ,"I am an X-phile from the very first episode. I loved everything about the show up until season 9. I was super excited about this film. Then I saw it. It was slow moving and did not make a whole lot of sense, like the FBI is just gonna call Mulder and Scully and say all is forgiven if you help find one agent. And how is Scully working under her real name---wasn't she considered an accomplice in his escape? Despite this horrific implausible bumps in the road, the story was slow paced. I had to buy the book to fill in the gaps. It was disappointing.
  While I agree, Scully and Mulder's relationship was nice to see, it was difficult when they argued and when they made references to wanting to leave each other. I don't think that's going to happen so why even introduce it. I feel that Chris Carter should give these two a real happy ending with their son(not the cheesy boat thing at the end).
  Overall, I felt the series had far superior episodes than this film. I doubt this film will convert any new fans. Shippers( and I am one)may have enjoyed this film a little better than the other fans. It wasn't so bad the second time because I had zero expectations. I will buy this video on Dec 2 because I love these characters and unhappy as this chapter is, it is now part of their story.",1221350400,,1294,4.2693877551020405

The secret of the agent's disappearance involves grisly medical experiments in the snowbound wastes of Virginia.

This film was clearly shot on a budget, but I did not miss the big CGI spectacles that we now expect from summer movies.  The focus is properly placed on the relationship between Mulder and Scully.  The theme of faith (in whatever form it may take) has been explored several times in the TV series and appears again here.  This film was not a big success, ether critically or financially, but I hope creator/director Chris Carter gets the chance to make another one.  It has been reported that he wants to shoot a story dealing with the alien invasion date of 2012 that was mentioned in the series, but I would like to see a story that leads Mulder and Scully to search for their son, William.  It would provide an intensely human story and resolve a plot thread that was not dealt with adequately in the TV series.",1221350400,,1154,4.627450980392157

The film follows FBI agents in their search for a missing agent. They are aided by a man, a priest of questionable morals, who has visions. They bring in Mulder and Scully, now a surgeon (since when?!) to help them in their investigation. If Mulder helps, all will be forgiven (a bit of a stretch since he was charged by the military for murder after all). Regardless, our favorite couple discovers a sinister plan that will make you cringe.

Amanda Peet is the FBI Agent that brings Mulder in. Her character could have been better used. Skinner makes an appearance!

The movie was sinister, evil, spooky and just plain wrong. It was great! To top is all off: Mulder and Scully. There is nothing bad we can say about their acting and their portrayals...they own these characters, they created them, and made them the memorable characters we like. The direction was excellent, with amazing long shots and beautiful photography. The great musical score was done by Mark Snow, who else would have been better for this?!

For the X-philes (fans): oh, this will be fun, sunflower seeds, ""I want to believe"" poster, pencils in the ceiling and a whole lotta Mulder and Scully talk. Priceless. Did you see Chris Carter in the scene at the hospital, sitting down?

For the X-shippers, you will be happy. Mulder and Scully, what has happened will be answered and then some.

For the non-fan: it was very easy to understand, there is not that much mythology, just some references here and there that are not necessary for the understanding of the plot.

The movie is very good, and spooky, it talks about morality, about persistence and about beliefs. The movie once again, as the entire series of the X-Files did, challenges both Mulder and Scully in their beliefs along the way of solving yet another sinister crime. There are tons of plot holes and far fetched things though. Yes, there have been better episodes. But still, a great addition to The X-Files.

3489727,5,B001BCO8XQ,"THE X-FILES: I WANT TO BELIEVE is a verbal, thinking, complex movie. It's what the X-Files was for 9 years during its TV run. Honestly, if you were expecting IRON MAN or THE DARK KNIGHT type of action, then you watched the wrong movie. There's deep messages within this movie that might have been missed. It all makes sense if you pay attention. In short: It's a thinking movie.

FOX really did a horrible job marketing this film. I doubt people to this day even knew this movie was out.. that's how bad of a job FOX did. I think the mystery they surrounded this movie with was unnecessary, because the mystery wasn't all that ""big"". The story was good though, as it's more then a ""paranormal"" type of story. Mulder and Scully are the key to this film.. without them, it would just be another scary/horror film. The ""monster"" story was good.. real life Frankenstein is basically what it's about.

3489728,5,B001BCO8XQ,"Wow, the possibility of X-Files (the complete series) on Blu-ray.  How cool is that?!  Well, let me tell you, REALLY cool.  I've been a fan of this show since it's premier (all those years ago), and have owned season's 1-7 on DVD Box Set in the past.  I can't WAIT until they release the whole series on Blu-ray.  I'll be ordering it up on that day.  :)

However, on another note, this guy here ""MJG"" is talking as if the thing is available, and not only that, he's talking as if it's going to be simply on 1 to 2 discs.  The complete series...on 1 to 2 discs.  Yeah, sure buddy, you go ahead and think that.  Considering that Season 2 of Heroes, which was only half of a season due to the writer's strike, is 4 discs in length, It is impossible that a show that has 24 episodes per season, and 9 seasons (let's see here, that's approximately 216 episodes) would fit on 1 to 2 BD's.  Heroes season 2 = 11 episodes, and yet it took up 4 discs.  And you think 216 episodes will fit on 1 to 2?  Okay, in a perfect world maybe, but ours is far from that at this present time.

Sorry to any of you reading that, but this guy here annoyed me.

At any rate, X-Files is possitively one of the greatest shows of all time (and that's NOT just an opinion) so X-Files, in all it's glory, in high def?  Well, that's going to be good solid entertainment.  However, it's sure to be just as heavy as the dvd box set, as it'll be nearly the same amount of discs, give or take a couple.",1221177600,,1468,4.076923076923077
3489729,3,B001BCO8XQ,"As an x-phila from the very beggining, I have to say that this is a cult movie addressed to devoted fans who were desperate to see Mulder and Scully again. After 6 years from the ""The Truth"" and 10 years from ""Fight the Future"", IWTB is, above all, a gift in every way, despite the controversial media reviews (and even my own). Good or bad, strong or weak, massive or independent taste, I am deeply grateful with this film and highly enthusiastic with the idea of a third one.",1221177600,,477,4.370786516853933
3489730,5,B001BCO8XQ,"It's a rare film that allows for suspense and genuine character development. The parallels between Scully's story and the main plot left me with some fairly profound notions (absolutely integral as a foil against the villains' actions-- How far do you go to save a life? How much pain to you bring to do it?), and the question of redemption sparked quite a fervent debate among the group of us at our first viewing--prompting a second one the next day.

I loved seeing the illustration of the similarities between Scully's quest and Mulder's. In every missing woman, Mulder fights to win, to right a situation he couldn't with Samantha. Scully will not give up on this young boy--in no small way fighting to assuage the guilt she continues to feel over their son, William. The beauty of this script is that it plays the complexities of emotion and motivation of A and B plots against one another.

As it was for many people, I thought the film also provided a wonderful exploration of a complex relationship that fascinated people for much of the 9 year run. They are adults in a partnership with a history that shouldn't be, and wasn't, ignored. Thank goodness they allowed these characters to develop.

3489731,3,B001BCO8XQ,"Watching this movie was like listening to one half of a phone conversation, which shouldn't have surprised me since that's what so much of the series was like. There is careful attention to detail in some respects (depicting the method by which the team of FBI agents comb the ice), yet just as much careless omission in how often we're left uninformed of motives or how anyone knows what they know, not to mention all the awkwardly inserted/scripted personal conflict (when Scully randomly starts yelling at Mulder about still trying to save his sister? wtf? it seems like half her dialogue is randomly yelling at someone). How much the plot resembled one of those dime-a-dozen serial killer investigation shows also left me guessing that Chris Carter actually didn't have any involvement in the film, until i saw the credits. With all that said though it is basically par for the course for The X-Files, so much potential that is so rarely fulfilled.",1220227200,,952,4.882716049382716
3489732,4,B001BCO8XQ,"While not a die hard, fire breathing fan of the series, I was a pretty faithful one and thoroughly enjoyed ""Fight the Future"" for all it was and wasn't.  I have been waiting for this second feature film with as much anticipation as the next.  It saddens me that it seems as if 20th Century Fox had very little faith in the project seeing as how its marketing campaign was non-existant.

""I Want to Believe"" is most definitely a stand alone story.  It is incredibly somber and visually stark.  The twist the plot takes towards the climax is truly disturbing.

As you've already read, there is no talk of black sludge or aliens or conspiracy or anything of that nature.  If anything, this movie is a very serious character examination.  We find Fox Mulder and Dana Scully in the most realistic of circumstances after all this time has passed.  Certain questions are answered through brief references or even just a glance.  We find our heroes thrown into the mix again after having been out of the fray for so much time and we are able to re-visit what we grew to love about these two so many years ago.

The plot does not need to be spoken of as it is so much more fun to experience as it unfolds.  Mark Snow once again does an eerily good job composing the score.  David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson jump back into the ring with a great willingness and spirit, but it must be said that while ""Fight the Future"" may have seemed to be Duchovny's to carry, ""I Want to Believe"" is very much Gillian Anderson's cross to bear and she does so with grace and grit and the cynical charm that we love so much.  Her performance is absolutely perfect.

Amanda Peet turns in some fine work as a fellow Agent on the case.  If I had one complaint about the film is that they should have used Peet a little more than they did.  But to be fair, she does have one of the most breathlessly suspenseful sequences in the film to carry with her.

Billy Connelly and XHibit are equally as good as a former pedophile and FBI Agent respectively.

What else can I say?  Some may be disappointed, but as another viewer pointed out, on 2nd or 3rd viewings, I think they, too, will see what a great addition this movie is to the X-Files Library.

I just hope we get another chapter!",1219968000,,2254,4.3701923076923075
3489733,5,B001BCO8XQ,"I agree wholeheartedly with Bobby Underwood's review and would like to add the following.

There are several moments which remain with you after the film has ended.  One of them is the scene where Mulder and Scully have just returned to the FBI headquarters after their long absence, just as we as the audience are returning to X-Files.  The sight of two light-hearted photos of Presidents Hoover and G.W. Bush stops them in their tracks.  Their reaction is heavily meaningful, but poker-faced, and the camera lingers.  We are apparently expected to do some work here.  Are we just supposed to be reminded of amusing anecdotes of Hoover's predilections, and Dubya's slips of the tongue?  Is this a cheap laugh, or is there a darker implication?  The camera says, ""look again.""

This is unusual for Chris Carter, who scatters his mis en scene lightly: the trading post cosily named after one of his longstanding crew; the clutter in Mulder's study recalling past episodes; the clock LED display that has moved on slightly from 10.21. So let's think again.  Hoover was the first FBI director, serving for 48 years, catching some famous federal criminals, and reducing the effects of the Ku Klux Klan.  So if we can forget about his underwear for a minute, he was the FBI's good guy, and their headquarters building is named after him.  But under Dubya, directly following 9/11, there was a change.  This is how Wikipedia describes it:

""Within months of the September 11, 2001 attacks, FBI Director Robert Mueller, who was only sworn in three days before the attacks, called for a re-engineering of FBI structure and operations. In turn, he made countering every federal crime a top priority, including the prevention of terrorism, countering foreign intelligence operations, addressing cyber security threats, other high-tech crimes, protecting civil rights, combating public corruption, organized crime, white-collar crime, and major acts of violent crime.""

Here is plenty of potential for Chris Carter, should he be granted another TV series.  Let's hope so.  But this scene is also reminding us that we and X-Files now inhabit a different world.  When X-Files started in the early '90s, the Cold War had ended, and the US audience was searching for new enemies.  X-Files kindly found lots, but kept ending up looking at its own government and national psyche.  So what has changed?  Can this film tell us?  We ""have work to do,"" as Scully hilariously says in one of the horror scenes.

And don't miss the tagged-on scene at the end of the credits.  It puts me in mind of the current joke that Jack Bauer would have escaped the Lost island in 24 hours.  And Mulder and Scully have taken fifteen years of X-Files or a couple of hours of new movie, depending on how you look at it.  There's a lot of water leading up to that scene; water in art films often implies transition.  Are we philes being greeted or waved goodbye in this scene, when everyone else has left the auditorium, except those few of us in the know?  We definitely need that new TV series to resolve this.",1219968000,,3073,4.835249042145594
3489734,5,B001BCO8XQ,"It's a crime that this movie was in and out of the theaters so quickly. It's a lovely, moody film that asks big questions about the nature of hope, faith and redemption. It's a really beautiful character study of Scully six years after the close of the series: her faith, her work, her deep, abiding love for Mulder, her desire for a normal life, her pain over all her losses, her courage in facing the darkness in spite of it all. Nothing could have made me happier. I saw the film five times in the theater and I NEVER do something like that. I'll definitely be purchasing it as soon as it's available.",1219622400,,604,4.353982300884955
3489735,4,B001BCO8XQ,"""The X-Files: I Want to Believe"" Written by Chris Carter and starring David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson.

Time has passed since the last episode. Dr. Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) no longer employed by the FBI is working on the case of a boy who has in incurable, untreatable disease. An agent from the FBI shows up at the hospital and tells Scully that he is looking for Fox Mulder. The agent tells Dana that the current warrants out for Fox and all past indiscretions will be forgotten if Fox is willing to help the FBI on a case. Apparently, a psychic has been helpful in finding body parts relevant to the case of a missing FBI agent. Since Fox and Dana had departed the FBI the X-Files division has been closed and Agent Dakota Whitney (Amanda Peet) wants someone with experience in that type of work to help in dealing with the psychic. Mulder balks at the idea at first but decides to help in the case...

""I Want to Believe"" is basically a long stand alone episode that doesn't include any of the running X-Files Mythos. No aliens and no searching for Mulder's missing sister. For any die hard fan, anything X-Files that is new will be enough to get you to view this, and for the casual fan the movie should still play fairly well but isn't likely to be described as a home run.

The Good: As a die hard fan, it is good to have something new come out. As far as the quality overall, everything is what you'd would expect from the acting down to the cinematography which is to say that if the previous movies and show were to your liking than this will be too with the inverse also being true.

The Bad: I felt like the story could have been a little stronger and the on screen chemistry between Duchovny and Anderson seems to have faded just the slightest bit.

Overall: The movie was enjoyable. If you are a fan of X-Files then go check this out!",1219449600,,1858,4.373913043478261
3489736,4,B001BCO8XQ,"Confessions first. I have been a passionate X-Files fan for a long time whilst the TV series was running. Yes I was younger then too..And it was, looking back, rather sad and confusing to know The Truth Was Still Out There and Scully-Mulder duo haven't captured it and yet the show ended.  So I kind of 'moved on' thinking there will be nothing further about the X-Files on TV.

When the film was released this year, it was a grand moment of anticipation. Since I am older now, all I wanted to know was what happened to Scully and Mulder's personal life rather than X-Files.  And the film did answer that which really made me satisfied. There are very tender and gentle, albeit subtle, moments of intimacy between the two characters which is so beautiful, full of the trust of friendship and bond of companionship. It was heartwarming really to see the two people so close which was never portrayed in the TV series.

The plot was typical. I enjoyed watching the exploration. However, I wondered if I liked some of the TV episodes better in this regard...The conspiracy is still going on and Mulder is still pained and troubled by it. And he coped with it by being a recluse.

One thing struck me as quite unsuitable. Billy Connolly and his priesthood. Was there nobody better in Hollywood to play that role? I mean, Connolly is ok as a comedian, but his acting was not. But he tried hard to play the role of a pedophile priest who is seeking salvation by his constant prayers and opening up his psychic abilities (ie see visions). I can't but think of the God reference in the film which, I would say, wasn't that obvious in the series. It was almost, at some point, that Mulder was trying to prove the existence of God rather than X-something...On the other hand, Scully was the ever-so-scientific person challenging all beliefs of Mulder but trying to negotiate her fears as well of losing Mulder again. She also faced a challenge professionally treating a dying young boy that led her to consider 'something beyond science'.

Great acting by Duchovny and Anderson. They both are older, more beautiful and 'reactive' to each other. Mulder smiles a little despite his famous deadpan style, Scully shows her longing and affection for Mulder and the grief for their lost child more spontaneously, Skinner is still there in a very interesting 'saviour role' for Mulder, and the eerie music is still cool and the darkness still feels real and magnetic. So I figured, sometimes, it's the darkness within and around us that defines our reality, destiny and our informed choices and not the unknowables. I would recommend this film only to those X-Files addicts and fanatics and followers.....those who worry about the Truth and Seeking more than just finding an easily accessible answers.",1219363200,,2784,4.765560165975104
3489737,5,B001BCO8XQ,"First off, let me admit that I am a huge X-files fan. I have all the season DVD's and first movie on DVDs. As a fan, it was really great to see X-files come back to the big screen, and even better to see David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson back as Mulder and Scully.

I give Chris Carter allot of credit for taking risk in this film. I think it was risky  bringing back the X-Files in a plot that doesn't involve UFO's. It was also risky leaving out allot of the fan favorite characters, such as the smoking man, the lone gunmen, Monica Reyes, John Doggett, etc. While it would have been great to see these characters return, I'm glad that didn't just give them brief cameo's just for the heck of it. Carter's new X-Files is a little strange with a plot that focuses on a pedophile priest with psychic powers, but it maintains it's integrity by avoiding being over glamorized.

As a fan (and yes fans will enjoy it more) I really enjoyed this movie. I thought it was incredibly intense and Carter explained well what happened to Mulder and Scully at the end of season 9. I didn't like the way season 9 ended, and but now it all makes sense.

X-files deserves allot of credit, not only as a great SCI-FI, but also as a criminal investigation series, and allot of shows have been influenced by them. I hope we see them again, but this seems like the last we will see. I'm grateful that we at least had one more.",1219276800,,1409,4.285714285714286
3489738,3,B001BCO8XQ,"The film is a good film. The plot is an interesting, dynamic and edgy. However, for X-files afficiandos, what is lacking is the deeper plots of government mistrust and corruption. Given what people have been waking upto in this new era of the 'global terrorism threat', 'weapons of mass destruction' etc. the message of X-files should still have a story to tell. However after 9/11 Gillian Anderson herself stated that the public/film studios had no such appetite for such a film. And of course many people understand the propaganda value of Fox News (Fox is the company that made the film).

So in summary, this is a good film but nothing more than that. However, if produced under a different studio there is still a story that the X-Files has to tell, perhaps in another film.",1219017600,,779,4.727941176470588
3489739,5,B001BCO8XQ,"Let's start with a few questions that we all ponder throughout the course of our lives:

If God is benevolent, why do people--children in particular--suffer? Can people who commit evil acts truly be redeemed? When does our faith in science and medicine reach its limits? Is faith in our loved ones always enough to keep us together?

This film is about the lifelong struggle with faith in all areas of our lives. It's about the constant battle to believe in a higher power, in those we love, in extreme possibilities, in ourselves.

The X-Files: I Want to Believe is a wonderful movie. It's beautifully filmed; the snowscapes are gorgeous. And it's quite thrilling to have a movie that isn't drowning in CGI. Mark Snow did a fantastic job on the score--buy that, too! And, honestly, it does not get any better than David and Gillian on screen together.

I saw this movie 10 times at the theater, which a lot of people find strange. But I don't see it as being any different than watching episodes of the show multiple times, which we've all done. I don't understand why all the people who watched the show didn't support this movie at the box office. Was it becaue it didn't deal with the mythology? Well, you've got slim chance of getting a mythology movie when you don't support this one. Was it because the film focuses on Mulder and Scully's relationship? This makes no sense to me because without that relationship--in all the forms it's taken through the years--there would be no X-Files. Was it because it's been six years since the show ended? I thought this would only help the movie (since the overall state of pop culture has gone steadily downhill since then), but I guess I put too much faith in other fans' loyalty.

I can only hope that all the people who didn't support this movie at the box office will buy multiple copies of the DVD to make up for it. If you only saw this once and were underwhelmed, I encourage you to give it a second chance--it only gets better with repeated viewings!

In the end, if the last image I have of Mulder and Scully is their fleeing the darkness, miles adrift from anyone else and inches away from each other...well, I can't ask for more than that.

(But, for the record, I'd pay money to watch those two clean their bathroom!)

Endless thanks to Chris Carter, Frank Spotnitz, David Duchovny, and Gillian Anderson (and the extended XF family) for this movie and everything that preceded it. I hope that this is not the end...",1218931200,,2475,4.583710407239819
3489740,3,B001BCO8XQ,"Seeing THE X-FILES: I WANT TO BELIEVE made me understand something that I find a little bit interesting.  When we've gotten to know characters really well (for example, over the several year life of a TV series), we don't want to see them change and grow.  We've come to like the characters JUST LIKE THEY ARE.  (I'll give you a crazy example:  if you've ever seen NIP/TUCK, you know that those two main characters have gone through absolutely the most outrageous things over the last few years.  Events that would have emotionally destroyed most people.  Yet we revel in Christian and Sean staying basically the same through all their diversity.  We want to see THOSE TWO PEOPLE going through these things...not really ""evolving"" people.)

Certainly two of the greatest characters in TV history were Fox Mulder and Dana Scully.  We loved their chemistry.  We loved their personalities.  As the series began to wind down, and Mulder became less of a presence...we lost that chemistry, and try as he might, Robert Patrick coming in as Agent Doggett could not replace the indefinable something that David Duchovny brought to his role AND brought out of Gillian Anderson in HER role.  Chemistry.  But I think more than that, the character of Scully began to change in significant ways...for example, she no longer filled the role of ""the skeptic and unbeliever.""  She had become the ""believer.""  It made rational sense that this was so...but it was unsatisfying for fans.

Now, a half-dozen years later, we get to revisit Mulder and Scully, anxious for a nice fun return to their ""old"" ways.  Witty banter, snappy dialogue, unacknowledged sexual tension.  What Chris Carter (creator of the show and writer of the movie) has done is allowed Mulder and Scully to evolve as they would in something like the ""real"" world.  This means that all the horrible, stressful events that these two have endured over the years have really taken their toll.  Scully has returned to medicine, working as a pediatric surgeon.  She carries a burden of sadness with her constantly...if you remember some of the sacrifices she had to make in the series, you know why.  Mulder, living now with Scully, has become something of a recluse in their modest but solitary country home.  There's a brief mention of him ""writing a book,"" but it mostly looks like he's still obsessively scouring the internet for ""the truth"" that's ""out there.""  The two are now openly a couple...no more unrequited love.  They are a loving couple who still have a deep sadness.  It makes total psychological sense.  It also makes for a less than exciting movie.

The basic plot revolves around a missing FBI agent, who may have been abducted and a fallen priest (Billy Connelly) who claims to have psychic abilities and also to have information on the whereabouts of the missing agent.  Naturally, there are a lot of skeptics, and the movie takes a lot of time with the mystery of whether he really has ""powers"" or whether he's actually part of the crime.  Scully, who you'll remember was a pretty devout Catholic (at least, for a TV character), is almost viscerally repelled by this man who betrayed the church in some very horrific ways.  Yet she's also drawn to him because he seems to have some insight into her psyche.  Mulder, of course, wants to follow the clues this priest leads them to...even as he begins to wonder at their source.  Serving in the roles of ""unbelievers"" are Amanda Peet and Xibit (yep, the rapper) as active FBI agents.  Eventually, the truth behind the initial crime is learned, and it's certainly a bit sordid and over-the-top...but no more so than any episode of THE X-FILES.

And there's the other problem...the movie fails to raise the stakes from the TV show.  It's not much more than an extended episode.  Carter and company have made the mistake, I believe, of thinking that the plot and themes they were presenting were either new and/or interesting.  The film builds moderate suspense, and there are some good scenes near the end.  But it is not very exciting.  Simple as that.

So far, everything sounds terrible, doesn't it.  In reality, as a long-time fan of the series, I actually still kind of liked it.  I personally enjoyed visiting the ""evolved"" Mulder and Scully.  I believed their progression, and Duchovny and especially Anderson were very good.  Most of the film, of course, is set in a cold climate, so there's lots of snow.  The whole film feels cold, sad and still.  This is not exactly a PLEASANT experience, but it is very well done and very effective.  The film offers a very nice cameo appearance near the end.  There are a few bursts of the old wry humor, which are very welcome.

If you are not a fan, I have no idea what you might think of the film.  You'd be able to follow it with little trouble, I suspect...but you'd likely be fairly bored as well.  For fans like me, it all depends on your hunger to see Mulder and Scully back in action.  If you don't mind older, wiser, sadder versions of your old favorite, then you should be okay.

The movie has been a flop.  This almost certainly means that the franchise will never be revisited.  This makes me sad (sadder than the movie did).  For a brief, tiny glimpse of hope...stay through the closing credits of the film.  You'll get about 6 seconds of extra footage that you'll still find worthwhile.",1218758400,,5360,4.739177489177489

The audience has to think and make up their own minds on what they see - whether they believe or are skeptical, about what's right or wrong and whether the main characters are flawed for believing what they believe in or if it's that very belief that pushes them forward, never giving up.

3489745,4,B001BCO8XQ,"Long a fan of the television show and the first film, I like other dedicated viewers of The X Files have, with great anticipation, looked forward to the sequel and the reunion of quirky couple Fox Mulder and Dana Scully.  With a stand alone story that could be understood by first timers, Chris Carter delivers a mystery that has chilling moments and gives us glimmers of why we loved the television series in the first place.

  Scully, now a doctor at Our Lady of Sorrows hospital, is dedicated to her patients, in paticular a young boy suffering a rare disease.  When her former employer, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, contacts her and asks her to locate her old partner, Fox Mulder, she and Mulder are drawn into a mysterious case involving the disappearance of an agent.  The Bureau's one lead is a priest (and convicted pedophile) who has visions and seems to be connected to the kidnapped victim and her captor.  Convinced Mulder can aid in the case due to his years of dealing with unexplained phenomenon, agent Dakota Whitney (Amanda Peet) hopes that the ex-agent (now forgiven his problems with the FBI) will make a break in the case.

  Chris Carter, David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson are a welcomed addition to the summer box office.  The movie, though not as action driven as other box office hits, is still a good film, though it seems to be lost among a summer season of huge hits and the unstoppable Dark Knight juggernaut.  Duchovony and Anderson fit easily into the roles that made them famous and their relationship in this film is touching, complicated and nicely acted.  Amanda Peet is a fair addition as the agent who brings the duo back together for the case and Billy Connolly gives a good performance as a priest fighting the demons within him and trying to right himself in God's eyes.  As ever, Fox remains the beleagured believer and Scully, the questioning skeptic.  Scully's faith in God is tested in both the suffering of her young patient and in dealing with a man of God who has commited such horrific crimes. Carter's story relies on the questions that has always propelled these two people into the darker recesses of humanity.

  The things, for me, that didn't work in this big screen version of the show was agent Mosley Drummy (played by rapper Xzibit).  The character was thoroughly unlikeable and simply added nothing to the story.  The story itself was good but moved slower than I expected and could have benefited from a little more action.  The unfortunate truth is that this movie came out about 5 years too late.  A lot of fans have moved on to new shows like ""Lost"" and ""Heroes"".  It seems, by the showing of poor performance at the box office, that only the diehard fans are showing up to see the film...which is a shame.  I am not sure, after the disappointing take at the box office, if we'll see more of Scully and Mulder.  Hopefully, the dvd rentals and sales will justify, at least one more movie, to sum up the story of Fox and Dana.  There is another great X File movie out there.  I want to believe THAT!",1218326400,,3070,4.6162361623616235
3489746,5,B001BCO8XQ,"It was great to have Mulder and Scully back one more time at least. The reason I say that is because Chris Carter has been quoted as saying that this one will have to prove successful to justify 20th Century Fox greenlighting a third sequel. And I don't think enough ""X-PHILES"" like my wife and I turned out for this one. And that's a shame too because this is a very well scripted and acted film. With plenty of action and humor to boot. I've read alot of reviews saying this was like an episode of the t.v. show. There's nothing wrong with that actually since it's because of this great t.v. show that we went to see the movie anyway. Because we remember how great the show was and how the mysteries unravelled slowly and that was the fun of it watching Scully and Mulder figure it all out despite being led and misled in every direction. We kept tuning in week after week. This movie has has been hacked on for being slow. Well, if slow means it took time to develop a plot. Then to some people I guess it was. I prefer to think of it as intelligently made. It presented a well thought out mystery for our favorite former F.B.I. agents to solve and just like a great episode from the series they didn't get it done in 10 minutes. With this movie we were treated to a plotline. So I guess it did play like an episode. A great episode from what was in my opinion the best show to hit television in the last 20 years. In closing let me say if you were a fan of the show, give this great film a shot, you'll like it. However if you need explosions and a ridiculously high body count. Look elsewhere.

3489747,4,B001BCO8XQ,"FBI agents Dakota Whitney (Peet) and Mosley Drummy (James) are investigating the disappearance of an FBI agent with the help of a psychic pedophile priest, Father Joe (Connelly).  Father Joe is having visions, and Whitney turns to Fox Mulder (Duchovny), who has worked with X-File cases before.  The FBI agrees to drop any charges against him for his help, and he is soon drawn in.  Dana Scully (Anderson) is less receptive to helping out, but does help out Mulder, who she has been living with for the last six years (since the TV show ended).  As they get closer to finding the agent, it becomes clear that something strange is going on.

After all this time, it is good to see Mulder and Scully back together again.  Duchovny and Anderson slip back into the characters almost effortlessly.  The movie itself shies away from the alien mythology of the TV show and focuses on a standalone story.  The movie comes feels like a long TV episode, but that is OK.  It works, and the story is bizarre enough to be interesting.  It will work for long-time fans and people who have no previous X-Files experience.

3489748,3,B001BCO8XQ,"Based on the terrible box office for the first weekend of ""The X-Files: I Want To Believe"", a lot of people have apparently lost the faith.

An FBI Agent is missing and ASAC Dakota Whitney (Amanda Peet) and her colleague Special Agent Mosley Drummy (Xzibit) have turned to a defrocked former priest Father Joseph Crissman (Billy Connolly) for help. Father Joe claims to have visions and these visions prove pretty accurate in helping with the investigation, but doubt is quickly cast on the convicted pedophile. But they still need help, so Drummy approaches Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) at the Catholic hospital where she works in pediatrics. They would like to find former agent Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and get his help; if he is able to assist, ""all will be forgotten"". Scully doesn't know where Fox is, as they don't work together anymore. That evening, she returns home and tells Mulder about the offer; Mulder has been living with Scully, secretly, off the grid for some time. Mulder is intrigued and agrees to help, but only if Scully will join them. But Scully is dealing with issues of her own and trying to decide whether she should do an experimental surgery on one of her patients; it might save the young boy's life but it could also cause him a lot of pain. In the end, they decide to help and Mulder becomes intrigued by the former priest's visions. Father Joe hopes that if he helps with this, God will look favorably upon him and forgive him his former sins. Then more young ladies begin to disappear and the hunt intensifies. Will they be able to unravel the mystery and find the missing agent?

Written by Chris Carter and Frank Spotnitz and directed by Carter, ""I Want To Believe"" is a very watch able film. It isn't the best film I have ever seen, but it is well made, to an extent, and will provide some suspense.

I was a huge fan of the television series and watched the show avidly for the first five seasons. Then, I began to lose interest. Anyone who is even remotely familiar with the series knows that the majority of the shows dealt with Mulder's preoccupation with UFOs and his feelings that his sister had been abducted. Many cases often started out as something completely unconnected and then a connection was established. And occasionally, Carter and Spotnitz would throw in a 'stand-alone' story. ""I Want To Believe"" is a stand-alone story. While I believe this is a smart move, it may also be the factor keeping many of the die-hard fans away.

It has been a number of years since the show ended and even longer since the last film. So to create a film picking up where the series left off would not be a great idea. Too much time has passed and any of those conspiracy theories Mulder often obsessed on would have to be reestablished, especially for the people who were not familiar with the series. For this reason, there is only the briefest mention of Mulder's sister and it doesn't have a connection to the story of this film.

But this is probably the only reason a large core of the fan base would come to this new X-Files film; to see Mulder and Scully pick up where they left off. Because this isn't the case, I suspect the fanbase is staying away in droves. Or perhaps, they are just more interested in newer obsessions like ""The Dark Knight"" and ""Iron Man"".

David Duchovny is one of those actors who lucks upon a role tailor made for their personality and skill as an actor. The role made Duchovny a star and he has had little success with his film career since. Duchovny is not a great actor and his lack of emotional range fits well with the obsessed, less emotional Fox Mulder. It is difficult now to imagine any other actor playing the role because it has become so associated with the actor, but Duchovny's lack of success with any film since shows the limited skill of the actor.

In ""I Want to Believe"", Duchovny and Carter loosen up Mulder a bit. He is a little softer, a little bit more jokey and still as obsessed as ever with all of the conspiracy theories, combing through newspapers and cutting out stories to hang on the walls of his office. It is also nice to see that he and Scully have hooked up and are sharing a life together. I guess after so long as professional partners together, it is difficult for them to stop addressing each other as ""Mulder"" and ""Scully"" now that they are lovers, but at least they have made that next step.

Gillian Anderson has always been the better actor and in ""I Want To Believe"" she continues to outshine. She also has her own separate story in the film, how she is going to handle the dilemma of her young patient. So, the case of the missing FBI agent comes as a distraction and she only gets involved because Mulder asks her for her help. Throughout, she is also extremely reticent to believe anything Father Joe says. He is an affront to her on two different levels; as a pedophile, he has victimized children and gone against his beliefs and the doctrine of his church. Both of these points are driven home by the fact Scully works as a pediatrician at a Catholic Hospital.

Amanda Peet plays Special Agent in Charge Dakota Whitney. When Mulder and Scully first meet her, she appears to be tough as nails and capable to lead the investigation. She was, in fact, the person who initiated contact with Mulder, believing he might be able to help. So she seems very capable, very tough. But as soon as Mulder enters the picture, she begins following him around like a little puppy dog. ""Really? What do you think we should do next?"" It almost appears as though Whitney idolizes Mulder and this sudden shift is problematic for her character. It also moves her into the background and makes her character superfluous.

Come to think of it, why does she initiate contact with Mulder in the first place? The only unusual aspect of this case is Father Joe and his premonitions. There are no mentions of UFOs, extraterrestrials, etc. So, what are Mulder's qualifications for working on the missing persons case? Because he has worked on them before? Haven't all FBI agents?

And Xzibit joins the case as Agent Drummy. He is stony faced and seems to have little tolerance for Mulder and Scully and Father Joe. He doesn't believe in Father Joe's premonitions, or in Mulder's skills and doesn't believe any of this is going to help their case.

Oh, wait. I get it. Whitey and Drummy are pretty much the same characters as Mulder and Scully, but their genders have switched. And they aren't as interesting. Whitney, the female agent ""believes"" and Drummy, the male agent, is skeptical. Subtle, Mr. Carter.

One of the reasons to make a big screen adaptation of a television series, beyond trying to extend the story and the franchise, is to take on a bigger story, something you are unable to do within the financial and time constraints of a television series. ""Believe"" takes place primarily in Virginia during the winter, making it easy for them to film in British Columbia. But it doesn't feel bigger than the TV show, except in length.

The mystery involving the missing agent and other missing women in the area becomes interesting and involving, but it ultimately begs the question, what do they want to believe it? It doesn't connect to the main conspiracy theories so prevalent in the story and doesn't really seem to cause Mulder to question anything except whether he should become involved with the FBI again.

And you must answer the question ""Should you become involved with ""The X-Files"" again?"" That is a personal question that only you (and all of the aliens who have been probing you for years) can answer.",1217808000,,7622,4.614760147601476
3489749,1,B001BCO8XQ,"We X-files addicts have been waiting for years for this long talked about film version of the legendary TV series that still plays around the world everyday. And so what did we get?

A movie so god-awful boring, colorless, badly acted and terribly scripted that it would never even be shown on the Sci-Fi Channel's roster of hideously cheesy films.  although one has to admit the Sci-Fi Channel movies at least move and try to generate some excitement.

We're treated to minute after boring, long minute of watching Scully try to save the life of a terminally ill child. Does this kid have anything to do with the so-called plot? It doesn't. Yet, we have to watch and listen to Scully argue and weep and moan about how she is determined to save the boy's life. and most of us were thinking optimistically that hey, here's the eerie part: perhaps the kid's an alien child. But no such luck.

And then we have Mulder whose voice is so incredibly monotonous (yes, even more than on the TV series)that he resembles a robot uttering his words. The most hysterical scene involving Mulder is when he just happens to discover a place where body parts are being used. He jumps into the mids of villians, waving a steel wrench, and shouts: ""Stop it!"" Of course these shadowy evil people have no intention of stopping what they're doing and jump all over him. And there are the endless car crashes which come along about every l5 minutes.

Just when I thought M. Night Shyamlan had made the worst sci-fi movie ever, THE HAPPENING, along comes this turgid abomination, hideously photographed and hideously empty of any suspense or eerie or creepy people, which forces me to say that this movie can sit right along with THE HAPPENING as the worst sci-fi movies ever made.

There's no excitement, no juicy fiends or aliens or anything psychic about this film.  It's just endless talk, talk, talk, as Scully and Mulder stop everything to argue and explain their actions to each other.

One can almost imagine X-files creator, Chris Carter, having a power lunch with M. Night and both laughing hysterically as to how they really fooled the movie goers into thinking they were in for a thrill ride. This lousy, dull, horrendous one-hour long collection of junk would never have made its way even as a one-hour TV episode.

So we are almost a decade later, and Mulder and Scully have been ""removed"" from the FBI for the duration.  Their re-enrolment is a first surprise, but there is no wow effect following!
The movie has Scully's reluctance as a subplot, augmented by her dedication to a terminally ill young boy, with no bearing on the plot. The harsh catholic hospital ruling by a inquisition-type priest has no further bearing, other than unnerving Scully all the more.
The next subplot is the visionary father Joe, a convicted paedophile priest with a remorse. So, OK, he directs the FBI to some interesting crime spots, but that's it. Apart from getting on Scully's nerves, yeah. The actual plot involvement is pretty thin ...
It seems that some modern-time Russian Dr Frankenstein, is at work in some abandoned shed. Maybe we'll learn more in a next movie? If anyone is still interested ...
There seems to be some body parts traffic going on as well...
Ah, yes, Skinner makes an appearance, after Scully presses the FBI for someone with balls. He then takes on the role of a chauffeur and sidekick for Scully, appearing, what, for five minutes total?
Finally, there is the all-pervading dark mood oozing from Mulder and Scully being an item or not, or no longer, or maybe, or what?

3489752,4,B001BCO8XQ,"In the early nineties before all of the CSIs & and their many progeny  The X-Files was the go to series for FBI profilers and serial killers partly inspired by the ""Silence of the Lambs"" with some weirdness thrown in, of course that was only a third of the stories the remaining 2 thirds were conspiratorial aliens and monster hunting in the spirit of the Night Stalker series of the 70's.  But as not to ""alienate"" those who may not have followed all the twists and turns of the 9 year run, creator Chris Carter has set-up ""I WANT TO BELIEVE"" as a stand-alone film that focuses on the FBI profiler sub-genre that the series helped to create...with a psychic just to top it off.  So any fans looking for the ""black oil"" or ""alien bounty"" hunters, you'll have to wait for the next X-Files feature film for any ""Mythology"" story ties.

As a fan I gotta say it is good to see David Duchovny's Fox ""Spooky"" Mulder and Gillian Anderson's Dr. Dana Scully as the duo comfortably fall back into the iconic sci-fi series archetypes of TRUE BELIEVER and the QUINTESSENTIAL SKEPTIC.  Their relationship has clearly deepened, the pair are no longer with the FBI, but end up aiding the FBI in their search for an abducted agent which stretching into a hunt for a serial killer, which in turn stretches into trailing an illicit organ harvesting operation with the help of a defrocked psychic ex-pedophile ex-priest and played perfectly by the great Billy Connolly. The nature of the character's background and her Catholicism lead her to suspect that he is a fraud or an accomplice, while Mulder is as quick as ever to find answers in the paranormal. People parts turn-up and Scully regrets involving Mulder as he is still motivated by guilt over the loss of his sister, a driving character point from the series very beginning, and fears his compulsion may cost them a lot more in the end.

The big screen X-Files Adventure feels right and has all the fixings of a good X-Files episode, even some climactic FBI cameos, and score by Mark Snow, the series original composer. But, does it go beyond that? Probably not, but it is more effective than
X-Files: FIGHT THE FUTURE.  I look forward to the 2012 follow-up, to focus on the Mayan ""Doomsday"" prophecy (set for 2012, and a focal point for the X-Files spin-off Millennium ).",1217462400,,2312,4.638141809290953

I wasn't sure how I felt about it on a whole until I continued to think about it.. remembering the minimalistic score, and continuing to think about the storyline and stoic determined resolve that brings characters around, through some things that they should already have moved on from, yet again.

3489754,2,B001BCO8XQ,"Movies have been very, very good in the last couple of years, and the first X-Files movie had a such tight plot embellished by all the special effects and alien conspiracy anybody could possibly want, that perhaps my expectations were too high. I thought IWTB was just awful.  It was a wimpy 'pop' when I expected a 'KABOOM'.

Dark, humorless and grotesque, this movie struggled and failed to balance a feebly predictable serial killer story with Scully and Mulder's implausibly overdeveloped relationship. (Did I mention a really dumb subplot? And the lack of any real ""X"" until the end, when Mulder provides a hurried commentary about one of the character's psychic abilities?)  The clear-eyed scientist and the dogged pursuer of the truth who used to be Scully and Mulder have been replaced by a couple of unlikeable and ineffective characters who only physically resemble their namesakes.  In the personas the IWTB moviemakers have given them, the big question was why the FBI would bother to recruit them for this case at all. (And why on earth did the FBI need Scully to find Mulder?) There were so many references to soap operaish events in Mulder and Scully's lives since the last X-Files, I had to Google to make sure I hadn't missed a movie, and there was so much angst floating around, I half expected Woody Allen to put in an appearance.  Hmmmm--now that would have been a nice twist.

The only good thing I can say about IWTB is that the cast did an absolutely splendid job of saying some of the worst dialogue in movie history with straight faces.

This movie wouldn't even have made a very good episode in the brilliantly imaginative X Files TV series.  It's too bad. I wanted to believe.",1217462400,,1703,4.72972972972973
3489755,4,B001BCO8XQ,"""The X-Files: I Want to Believe"" is a welcomed return of Mulder and Scully, who we last saw six years ago. Unlike the first film, ""I Want to Believe"" is a small film with big ideas, much like the episodes from the classic television series. Mulder and Scully investigate a man who claims to have visions sent from God, and can see the victims of apparent kidnappings. This main story is fascinating, and one that will keep fans interested.
Sadly, the film's weakness comes from a sub-plot with Scully, who now works as a doctor for a Catholic hospital. This story, where we see Scully using controversial means to help a child who is dying, is an unneeded element. Not because of the controversy, but because it slows the film down quite a bit. Other than this, the storytelling is good.
The cast does a terrific job. Dana Duchovny and Gillian Anderson are still terrific as Mulder and Scully, and to see their relationship grow even closer in this film gives it it's soul. Billy Connolly is great as Father Joe, the man who has the ""gift"" of the psychic connection with the victims. Here is a man tormented by his past deeds, trying to do some right in the world, and Connolly plays him perfectly. Amanda Peet, Xzibit and the rest of the cast give good performances as well.
Overall, this is a fine film that fans will surely enjoy. Hopefully, this is just the first of several films to come.

3489758,4,B001BCO8XQ,"With IWTB, CC & co. has brought closure to one of two arcs left dangling at the end of the series in a way that is at once unsentimental and deeply moving. This is a film clearly written for the shippers, with Scully squarely at the emotional center of the story (and GA's performance is nothing short of luminous). The Mulder-Scully relationship is one of the greatest ever written in TV history, and I think CC has taken it as far as it can go in this film without risking reducing it to sentimental superficiality.

In a very real sense, IWTB's appeal is necessarily limited: it won't possibly satisfy fans of the myth arc, and I can't imagine people with little or limited XF background can fully appreciate the richness of the Mulder and Scully characters as depicted in the film. Knowledge of their backstory is indispensable.

Some people have found the subplot of Scully's attempt to save the little boy's life superfluous and distracting, but I regard it as essential as a powerful and dramatically coherent vehicle for delivering the basic message of the film (""don't give up on your belief""). The final hospital scene in which Scully ultimately decides to go through with the operation on the boy provides, I believe, not only absolution for Father Joe's sins, but also redemption for Scully herself as her commitment to finding the truth begins to waver in the face of ever-present darkness.

When the series ended, Mulder and Scully were on the move, in the dark and full of uncertainty. In the intervening years, I have often thought about them, wondering what would have befallen these two characters in whom I have made a huge emotional investment through 7+ glorious years. When this film ended, we find Mulder and Scully again on the move, but this time in bright sunshine rowing in an azure sea towards what seems like an island paradise.

The only thing that seemed paranormal was the part about the psychic.  There is very little that is creative about the story.  It brings us nothing new.  There are so many things they could have done with this, and what they did do was just disappointing.

Also, the romance between Mulder and Scully and their dialogue was dull.  We knew we were supposed to be laughing many times, but we weren't.  There were two stories that they tried to combine without success.  It all felt thrown together in an attempt to fill the time.

I left with questions that I felt should have been answered.  Such as, did one of the main victims live?  Did a boy find success with his operations?

I got so tired of hearing Scully say she wasn't into the search anymore. How many times does she need to say it before we get it?

Amanda Peet and Xzibit don't really fit as FBI agents.

The cinematography, in an attempt to be artful, focused too closely on some things and the camera moved around too much.

On the positive side, it was good to see David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson working together again. I also liked that they brought back Walter Skinner, though he wasn't given enough to do. The snow covered locations added atmosphere and were pretty to look at.

The X-Files: I Want to Believe is worth the time of huge fans of the show, otherwise just bust out your DVDs and watch some episodes from seasons 1-6. Those are the classic stories I want to believe in.

3489762,4,B001BCO8XQ,"The X-Files: I Want to Believe was done extremely well considering it's been six years and most people have moved on with their lives. As a stand-alone movie it does fairly decently, but as a way to get reintroduced to our favorite duo of Mulder and Scully - it appeased my expectations. I was surprised about the ease with which Chris Carter can make a case for stem cell research and how he did it so fittingly set against the background of X-Files (very much like the good old days when the series dealt with our strongest fears).

For an obsessive fan of the series (I have The X-Files: The Ultimate Edition set  and have seen all episodes at least twice), who is also a Mulder-Scully shipper, the movie satisfied my curiosity of knowing that the characters are still doing quite well and fighting some of the same battles as when we last saw them.

The bottom line is that if you are a fan of the series, you will enjoy this film. If you are a fan of the Mulder/Scully dynamic, you will love this film. If you are a newbie you'll be underwhelmed by it and miss out on all the in-jokes that make going to this film worthwhile.

Word of advice: Don't forget to stay till the very end of the credits - there is a special treat there for you!",1217116800,,1243,4.299145299145299
3489763,4,B001BCO8XQ,"I know many people who have seen this latest X-Files movie are deeply unhappy with it.  And as a huge fan of the show, I can see all the reasons noted to be unhappy.

I went into the theater with fairly low expectations.  The series didn't end on a great note for me.  I felt that CC had made some huge, huge mistakes with characters and plotlines.  Far too many mistakes to be forgiven.  I went into the movie thinking he'd probably done the same here, too.

The truth is that the X-File/Mystery/MOTW storyline of the movie is weak, flat and somewhat boring.  If it had been an actual X-Files episode, I probably wouldn't replay it much.  That aside...

There was SO MUCH to cheer for about this movie.  This was a movie that almost wasn't made - something we all thought we'd never ever see!  That in itself is AMAZING.  It was about our two favourite FBI agents and where they are now in their lives.  It was quiet, beautiful, heartbreaking, subtle... face it, folks: after so many years, people change.  They age, grow up.  They find places of comfort and support.

The X-Files: I Want To Believe is a loveletter to the fans.  Most especially, it is a loveletter to those of us (myself happily included) who felt that the show was really about relationships - especially the relationship dynamic between Mulder and Scully.  And on that front, I felt that the movie did us all justice.  It was a wonderful look into their lives.  My only wish was that they had more airtime together, without some MOTW business going on in the background.  Their relationship continues to stand the test of time.

My word of advice: go see the movie.  Love it or hate it, it was made for the fans.  It deserves to be seen on the big screen.  Don't go in expecting it to be the best movie of all time, because you'll be let down for sure.  Go in expecting to see a subtle look into a relationship that's been going strong for 15 years and you will be overjoyed, as I am.

OH!  Stay until the end of the credits.  Seriously.  :)",1217030400,,2012,4.3712737127371275
3489764,5,B001BCO8XQ,"I've been a 7-year fan, and so there would be no other way to show my fanboyism by seeing this movie. And boy was it worth it. It's done more in the style of a classic episode, and it definitely works. I won't give any details of the plot, but I will say I loved it. Mulder is his usual witty self, Scully has a new persona, but still is very smart. Billy Connoly as Father Joe is one of the best performances in years. And as much as I was skeptical about Xzibit, he's actually not bad. Some parts will have you laughing (especially the ""Trademark Whistle-George Bush"" scene), some will have you crying, and you'll be on the edge of your seat the whole time. I didn't really like the ending, but I was satisfied overall, and I loved the movie a LOT. Oh, and stay through the credits for a cool little part halfway!",1217030400,,815,4.197452229299363
3489765,2,B001BCO8XQ,"This movie's terrible.

One of the movie sites rates this low -- lower than any other summer blockbuster. I love to disagree with unfavorable reviews, except here they're right.

[Spoiler alert]
There are no aliens, UFOs or ET's.  Just a really sick plot about stem cell research and transplant operations. (Remember Clockwork Orange -- a great book and a polished, distrurbing film?)

This effort is quite darn creepy but not in a ""boo! got ya"" way. Unsettling and horrific themes. Taboo subjects everywhere. (One of the main characters is a psychic defrocked priest.) Hey, anyone for frozen surgical leftovers?

Our heroes soldier on droning about this and that. Scully is now working in a Catholic hospital, where her medical decisions face a board of morality oversers, because key plot points require this.  There's a few more nasty riffs on the Catholic church I really didn't like.

Unpleasant and scary. The scares bring this up to 2 stars -- a more generous rating than most who see this will give.

By the way, I liked this movie the most of the three of us who saw it.  Just think -- this is the POSITIVE review.

This is vying for your movie dollar with the new Batman movie??  No contest. See the Batman!",1217030400,,1217,4.720379146919432

Since last we saw them together, former FBI agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully seem to have moved on with their lives - or, at least, one of them has.  For while Scully is now working as a topnotch neurosurgeon at a Catholic hospital, Mulder, still a wanted-man by the FBI, is living a hermit-like existence in a remote shack in West Virginia.  However, both are pulled back into service when an FBI agent goes missing under suspicious circumstances and it is discovered that a pedophile priest with possible psychic powers may hold the key to her whereabouts.

There's no question that it's nice to see Scully and Mulder working as a crime-fighting duo again after all this time, but ""The X Files: I Want to Believe"" turns out to be a pretty shaky vehicle for this long overdue reunion.  Written by Frank Spotnitz and series creator Chris Carter (who also directed the film), this is little more than a serviceable installment in a series that, during the 1990's, held millions of viewers in thrall to its unique combination of paranormal crime-busting and conspiracy-theory paranoia.  Unfortunately, this second movie spin-off (the first was released in 1998) emerges as a fairly mundane psychic thriller that borrows many of its elements from ""Frankenstein"" and the ""Saw"" franchise.  What's missing from the movie is that strange ability the original series had of throwing us back on our heals and really making us see the world in a new and sometimes very frightening way.  Moreover, the movie, for some reason, feels the need to paint Catholics, Russians and homosexuals in as unflattering a light as possible.

The passage of time hasn't eroded either the charm or the physical attractiveness of David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson in the roles that made them famous, and the actors alone make the movie worth seeing for diehard fans of the show.  But given all the time the writers had to dream up a knockout scenario for the stars` return, this latest (and probably last) endeavor together is sure to disappoint.",1217030400,,2027,4.88338192419825
3489768,5,B001BCO8XQ,"I thought the movie was great. It was a stand alone like Chris Carter said it would be. It almost seemed to be a pilot episode for a string of future X-File movie releases. I highly recommend this movie for an X-Files fan.

I do not recommend this movie for anyone under 30 years old. They would not understand the dynamics of the movie nor could they come close to appreciating them.  You had to be there in the 1990's watching X-Files to understand.",1217030400,,451,4.357142857142857
3489769,5,B001BCO8XQ,"One would question the validity of releasing this production in the midst of the summer blockbuster season. Then again, it really doesn't
matter. Chris Carter has given us an update on Mulder & Scully. A ""stand alone"" piece with no mythology and only a vague impression that another is on the way. Then again, this may be a tender wave goodbye. A post-mortem of sorts to give homage to a 9 season series that never gave up on originality and substance.
  Can one fully appreciate this film without previous experience? Hard to say. Probably not entirely.
  As an X-Files fan you will enjoy watching Spooky back at it again. Seeing Scully as she continues to hold in the reins while submitting undeniable. loyalty. The character amiability and dialogue are still present. The mood prevails. The production values retained.
  Let's hope the DVD release will contain the necessary Special Features to round out our satisfaction of this long awaited event.

3489770,4,B001BCO8XQ,"It was great to see them bring Mulder and Scully back (as well as giving a cameo to Skinner, one of my favorite supporting characters from the series...wish he's had more time in the story though). This movie really does play like a standalone episode from the series, and it was the best possible move Chris Carter could have made. Rather than take the ever-deepening mythos of the series and twist it further, he's moved the characters into a story that makes sense in where our agents would be today.

Mulder and Scully no longer work for the FBI, but they're called back in for one more case. To be honest, I don't think bringing Fox in on the case was necessary, but I'm just happy to see them back in action. They've changed since we saw them last fleeing from the FBI. They're more subdued, more adult, and seem to have comfortably settled into the relationship that started on the show.

The subplot involving Scully's patient at the hospital never really seemed to make sense. I understand it added tension to the storyline for her, but it didn't seem vital to the story. When you consider we've waited YEARS to see these two back in action again, every moment on screen is precious, and I feel they wasted a lot of it with Christian's stem cell subplot.

All in all, this is a movie even a non-fan could watch and still follow. There are fleeting mentions to previous cases they dealt with together, but nothing is vital to know ahead of time. I really enjoyed this movie and hope it's the beginning of a trend for more of them (just don't make us wait so long for the next one please!).",1217030400,,1597,4.462328767123288

It held my interest from the beginning to the end and my only regret is that it left me wanting more!!! I must admit that I do like the whole Alien/UFO storylines the best, but I will take what I can get. I have been waiting years for this and I was not disappointed. The X-Files is my most favorite show of all time. If you are a true X-File fan, then I think you will love this movie. And even if you are not, give it a try. I think you will be pleasantly surprised.",1217030400,,687,3.9855072463768115
3489772,5,B001BCO8XQ,"Much like the first theatrical outing for Mulder and Scully, this will disappoint some for what it is not, and others for what it actually is. It is very much the type of stand-alone story which used to be squeezed between the conspiracy and mythology episodes. The problem presented by the avenue chosen by Chris Carter and Frank Spotnitz is that after so many years have passed, fans aching for what The X-Files did best will be confronted by a dreary and snowy low-key and intimate story which while excellent on its own, is not what fans had anticipated.

That being said, I do believe, however, after the initial shock, and perhaps after a second viewing, fans will embrace it for Carter's courage to once again fly in the face of the powers that be and tell an often creepy stand-alone story showing how the darkness always found Mulder and Scully, and how it was having each other to lean on which helped each keep their faith. It is almost as if this is a segue to something more on the horizon. For even within the confines of a story which does not deal in the slightest manner with any of the X-Files mythology fans have hungered for, there are portents.

Beginning with both Mulder and Scully leading very different lives than those we came to know, Carter uses the darkness to bring them back together. It is a kidnapped F.B.I. Agent and a Bureau ready to forgive Mulder for his many indiscretions if only he will help work with the psychic who may or may not be genuine which starts things rolling. Scully's need to help a young boy with an incurable disease and the relationship of our favorite F.B.I. couple, even though neither works for the Bureau anymore, gets as much screen time as the premise, which is like a creepy episode rather than a feature film.

Duchovny and Anderson are still fabulous together, perhaps even more so in a somber and low-key outing such as this. The intimacy and history of the couple is what the film is about, and how faith can be restored even amidst the darkness which always found them, and sometimes kept them apart. This really plays better as a small screen episode of the show, but because we have missed Mulder and Scully for so long, it gets an A.

There are references to Mulder's sister, the alien abduction which haunted and drove him in his quest for the truth. It is a story line we thought wrapped up. Now that is unclear. Carter did say in an interview about the film that no one ever really dies for good on the show. And though the film itself has dealt in absolutely no way at all with X-Files mythology, what should show up as a background to the closing credits? Black oil, that's what. And it ain't Texas tea. It is worth seeing if only for a very touching and tender moment between Mulder and Scully near the end. It is the kind of intimate conversation which made the show better than anything else we got to watch during its long run.

The story itself might have been better as an episode of the show, and those who venture into theatres expecting something grandiose after all this time will certainly come away wondering if it was worth the wait. Fans of the show, however, were fans because of the relationship between Fox Mulder and Dana Scully. So if you go in knowing that this is that sort of episode, in which the case is only an excuse to bring them back to who they were, then you'll enjoy it much more. It has much more in common with ""Beyond the Sea"" or ""Irresistible"" than say, ""Nesei"" and ""731.""

See it on the big screen to show support, so we can have more, but know you'll probably enjoy it more on your set once it comes to dvd.",1216944000,,3621,4.437593984962406
3489773,4,B001BCO8XQ,"I am a fan, I would have been happy with 2 hours worth of Mulder and Scully doing absolutely nothing in the screen, as long as they were back. But, we have been given a lot more! Chris Carter has given us a thriller and a pretty good one at that.

The film follows FBI agents in their search for a missing agent. They are aided by a man, a priest of questionable morals, who has visions. They bring in Mulder and Scully, now a surgeon (since when?!) to help them in their investigation. If Mulder helps, all will be forgiven (a bit of a stretch since he was charged by the military for murder after all). Regardless, our favorite couple discovers a sinister plan that will make you cringe.

Amanda Peet is the FBI Agent that brings Mulder in. Her character could have been better used. Skinner makes an appearance!

The movie was sinister, evil, spooky and just plain wrong. It was great! To top is all off: Mulder and Scully. There is nothing bad we can say about their acting and their portrayals...they own these characters, they created them, and made them the memorable characters we like. The direction was excellent, with amazing long shots and beautiful photography. The great musical score was done by Mark Snow, who else would have been better for this?!

For the X-philes (fans): oh, this will be fun, sunflower seeds, ""I want to believe"" poster, pencils in the ceiling and a whole lotta Mulder and Scully talk. Priceless. Did you see Chris Carter in the scene at the hospital, sitting down?

For the X-shippers, you will be happy. Mulder and Scully, what has happened will be answered and then some.

For the non-fan: it was very easy to understand, there is not that much mythology, just some references here and there that are not necessary for the understanding of the plot.

The movie is very good, and spooky, it talks about morality, about persistence and about beliefs. The movie once again, as the entire series of the X-Files did, challenges both Mulder and Scully in their beliefs along the way of solving yet another sinister crime. There are tons of plot holes and far fetched things though. Yes, there have been better episodes. But still, a great addition to The X-Files.",1216944000,,2197,4.632390745501286
3489774,5,B001BCO8XQ,"""The X-Files: I Want to Believe"" surpassed everything I expected. It's not merely a cool science fiction story; it's an engrossing mystery that probes deeply into matters of faith, not necessarily in a religious context despite the fact that God and Christianity are mentioned a great deal. It's also a much richer examination of Fox Mulder and Dana Scully (David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson), both seeming more complete and compelling as characters. This is not an extension of the long-running TV series, nor is it a sequel to the first ""X-Files"" film--""I Want to Believe"" stands entirely on its own, which is a relief because it ran the risk of being bogged down by in jokes and excessive references to material that only a select few remember. Anyone unfamiliar with the series can watch this film and not feel as if they've missed out on anything.

That being said, diehard fans are sure to notice everything, not the least of which is the poster hanging in Mulder's room showing a UFO and the boldly printed slogan that doubles as the film's secondary title. This poster is surrounded by dozens of pinned-up photos and newspaper clippings, all of which display headlines that challenge rational thinking. Could these events really happen, or are they just the imaginative lies of some newspaper writer? Mulder doesn't know, but as the film's title suggests, he wants to believe. The problem is that he no longer believes in the FBI, and they certainly don't believe in him anymore, not with his previous attachments to the X-Files investigations and their outrageous theories. He now spends his days secluded in his home, technically wanted by the FBI but left alone because he's no longer a nuisance.

As it turns out, the FBI needs his help, and the only way to find him is to find Scully, now a full-time physician at a Catholic-run hospital. She reluctantly agrees to ask Mulder, and he reluctantly agrees to help the FBI. Agent Mosley Drummy (Alvin ""Xzibit"" Joiner) and ASAC Dakota Whitney (Amanda Peet) give him his briefing: A female agent has been kidnapped in the snowy town of Somerset, West Virginia, and so far, the only clues are a severed male arm and a man who claims to have had visions of her. This apparent psychic is Joseph Crissman (Billy Connolly), a registered pedophile who was formerly a priest. Naturally, no one wants to even consider that a man who molested young boys has any reliable information. This is especially true of Scully; she hates him with a passion.

Mulder, stubborn man that he is, listens to what he has to say, and that's because--you guessed it--he wants to believe. Scully refuses to play into Crissman's words, which seems to be what Mulder is doing. From her point of view, her former partner is stuck in the past, unable to let go of his long-since-dead sister. From his point of view, it has nothing to do the past--it's all about the signs he's being given, and right now, all signs point to a missing woman and a man who can lead the FBI to her. Mulder begs for Scully's support, but after years of chasing monsters and madmen in dark places, it seems she's unable to give him any.

But as the film progresses, we gradually discover that Scully is in a dark place of her own. One of her patients is a young boy with a rare brain disease, and despite her best efforts, all conventional treatments have failed. The only remaining option is a highly experimental stem cell procedure, which the hospital administration is unwilling to consider. Much like Mulder, Scully is consumed, not only with wanting to save a life, but also with wanting to believe in something that many others don't (or won't). She insists that the staff can't overlook the wishes of the primary physician, and if they have a problem with that, they should speak to someone of a higher authority. A very influential member of the staff, Father Ybarra (Adam Godley), tells Scully that he's spoken with the highest authority there is, and maybe she should do the same. But what if she already has? What if this highest authority was guiding her all along, telling her to not give up?

And could the same thing be guiding Mulder, a man who often goes out on a limb with very little to support him? If he is right about Father Crissman, then that would mean a vile man is the key to saving a woman's life. Do we commend the Devil for doing God's work? Do we praise the wicked for aiding the good?

You may have noticed that I said nothing regarding the whereabouts of the missing FBI agent. I did that on purpose--intertwined with Mulder and Scully's story is a subplot involving medical experimentation, a subplot so delightfully outrageous that I dare not spoil it for anyone. Rest assured it's about as sinister as you expect it to be, maybe more so. Director and co-writer Chris Carter skillfully builds the apprehension as the final confrontation draws near, teasing the audience with bleak winter landscapes and isolation and sudden moments of fright. But the greatness of ""The X-Files: I Want to Believe"" was achieved with more than slow buildups of tension and terrifying images; the characters are finally complete, now emotionally driven as well as professionally. Better still is a story that actually forces the audience to think, somewhat about the mysterious plot but more so about what we believe and what we want to believe. Yes, the film's title is a fitting one.",1216944000,,5407,4.740701381509033
3489775,4,B001BCO8XQ,"The film was decent. It was not mind-blowing or anything like that. It was just like a decent episode that was expanded upon. I did enjoy the revelations and how they were just presented, not rammed down our throats. I also enjoyed the story and how it at first seemed like,  (tiny spoiler hint) just simple organ theft, and then, well, go see the film.

I think for fans, fans who are not overly critical, that they will enjoy this. After all, the series, in my opinion, died out after season 7. So I thought that was it. X-Files is over. It was a pleasant surprise to see a new film and hopefully more in the future.

It did not have the sinister, deadly, earth shattering conspiracy tension that I enjoyed in the shows mythology episodes but it was true to form and did have a sense of urgency to it.

I will say more in a few days. i do not want to discuss spoilers just yet.

Rather, it was written in the standalone 'monster of the week' vein and as such I am certain it will be highly enjoyable.

3489778,5,B001BCO8XQ,"The X-Files is the definition of iconic television. In the vein of series like Star Trek, Gunsmoke and The A-Team, X-Files defined high quality television for a generation during the 1990's. Plenty of scary monsters, a complex mythology surrounding alien invasion and a well developed love story, this show had it all and set the bar for shows to come such as Smallville, Firefly, Lost, etc.

Looking back, one can clearly see the influence X-Files has had on the shows to follow it. However, none have quite the staying power of the X-Files which lasted 9 full years in prime time, a feat nearly unheard of in our current era of reality glut televison.

X-Files moved the FOX network into contention with ABC, NBC and CBS as a force to be reckoned with. Prior to X-Files, FOX was known for Married with Children, The Tracey Ullman Show, In Living Color and The Simpsons. All good shows, but with the ratings X-Files delivered in the key demographics, advertisers lined up with $$$ that FOX had not previously seen. This influx of advertising cash allowed FOX to obtain the rights to broadcast NFL games and the SuperBowl, thus changing the network TV landscape forever as FOX joined the ranks of the ""Big 3 Networks"" and moved from a bit player into the major leagues of TV.

Now FOX is seen as one of if not the major network in TV with shows like 24, Prison Break, etc. None of this would have been possible without the break out hit that was the X-Files. It deserves to be on Blu Ray. When you consider how much utter worthless junk is out on Blu Ray already and when you look at the strong sales for previous X-Files home media, it is a no-brainer that X-Files should be out on Blu Ray sooner rather than later.",1214870400,,1716,4.511254019292605

8282698,5,B001BCO8XQ,"I am not saying this because I am a huge X-Files fan but I really think both movies are excellent. It's not easy to write a plot for a movie based on a TV show and make it appealing to the fans of the show and also to the general public who may not be familiar with the show's themes. I think the producers succeeded on both accounts.

Fight the Future is a classic X-Files aliens conspiracy theory and works as a stand-alone plot although being familiar with the show will probably increase the enoyment of the viewer. I Want to Believe is suprisingly good; I feel that it has some similarities to Silence of the Lambs. An FBI agent goes missing, and they come seeking help from a former agent, none other than Mulder while at the same time engaging the help of a psychic who is having visions of the abduction. You may think of trying to catch the abductor as trying to catch Buffalo Bill. And the motive of the abductor is just as horrifying as that of Buffalo Bill. Since this is an X-Files, there is the element of psychic powers and pyschic connections between the key characters and some sci-fi elements alll of which come together quite nicely. I think it is a very well-written story full of suspense. Even the subplot about Scully's trying to save a patient's life with a drastic treatment method fits perfectly well within the construct of the plot and drives the point home.

I was surprised to see the low rating for ""I Want to Believe"" on IMDB and especially on RottenTomatoes (31% - they must be out of their minds to give such a low rating, especially when they give such high ratings to movies that are contrived cliches at best). My recommendation is don't be fooled by the low ratings and see for yourself. If you are an X-Files fan, you will definitely enjoy these movies. And even if you are not a fan, I still think you will enjoy them as someone who appreciates sci-fi and horror.",1523750400,,1903,4.418803418803419
