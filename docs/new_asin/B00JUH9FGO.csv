6390612,2,B00JUH9FGO,Very disappointed in this version downloaded from a TV set.  Guess I should have expected that since it was done in the 1950s.,1434326400,,126,4.478260869565218
6390613,5,B00JUH9FGO,"I bought a copy of this for $7 a few years ago and amazed how great it was. Big fan of Karloff and Randall so I had to have it. I can say it's
one of the best live TV productions you will find and shows how talented the entire cast was and how funny Randall and Karloff could be.
I never liked the 'movie' version with Grant and this is so much better anyway. This is a must have for Karloff or Randall fans!",1427241600,4,408,3.8117647058823527
6390614,2,B00JUH9FGO,Fun performances.  Quality of the dvd isn't great.,1425340800,,50,5.25
6390615,5,B00JUH9FGO,"This is a great show.  I have watched Raymond Massey play the part of Jonathan in the movie version and loved him, but it was a real treat to see Karloff in the role.  Also, I like Tony Randall.  It was a different take on an old favorite, perfect for Halloween.",1415232000,6,262,4.098039215686274
6390616,3,B00JUH9FGO,"Truncated version of the popular play retains some of its biggest laughs and has the delightful bonus of Boris Karloff recreating the role of Jonathan Brewster which was his Broadway debut.

The quality of the kinescope is less than optimal, but the viewer quickly adjusts and the Hallmark commercials lend a nice, nostalgic touch.",1414627200,6,331,5.12962962962963
6390617,2,B00JUH9FGO,"Very difficult to see with all of the original T.V. interference, snow, and static on the recording.",1411171200,,100,4.9411764705882355
6390618,4,B00JUH9FGO,"Randall and Karloff work together so well, even under the stress of live early TV.  Holds up well, and as fun as the Cary Grant movie of the same name.",1408752000,4,151,4.033333333333333
6390619,4,B00JUH9FGO,"A very well cast and directed television version of the classic play.  Just being able to see Karloff recreate his Jonathan is worth the price of admission.  The quality of the video is rough as it is made from a tape recording that has a handful of video dropout lines, especially towards the end, but not so much that it distracts the viewer from enjoying this production.  Because of this lack of quality of the source video, I would have given this a 3 star rating but according to amazon, 3 is just ""It's okay"" while 4 is ""I like it"".  And I definitely liked it.  This is also saying a lot because to adapt this play to its time slot, the character of Officer O'Hara -- the aspiring playwright -- was written out and that's the role I've played twice on stage and I was interested to see how he was interpreted.  I'd recommend this DVD to anyone who loves Arsenic and Old Lace and won't get too caught up on the condition of the visuals.  You also get all the commercials that accompanied the broadcast, so that's a little stroll down memory lane as well.",1407628800,14,1060,4.350253807106599
8653892,2,B00JUH9FGO,This is not my favorite version. I love the one with Cary Grant and didn't even finish watching this one,1524009600,,104,4.25
8653893,1,B00JUH9FGO,"Very low quality, had to throw it away- blurry, unwatchable.",1522713600,,60,5.1
8653894,4,B00JUH9FGO,Difficult to watch due to poor quality video.  Fun none the less.  The closest we can get to seeing Karloff in Arsenic and Old Lace on Broadway- until we have time machines.,1502755200,,173,4.375
8653895,1,B00JUH9FGO,I had not expected the print to be so poor. It is almost unwatchable.,1501891200,,69,4.0
8653896,4,B00JUH9FGO,"I bought this because I've always wanted to see Boris Karloff do the role he created on Broadway.  As it turns out I was a little disappointed in his performance. He seemed tired or ill. Maybe he was?

I still enjoyed the show though.  Tony Randall was wonderful. Although I'm a huge Cary Grant fan I think Randall did a better job with the role. He was less frenetic and had a good repartee with Karloff. The aunts were a little lackluster but I enjoyed Tom Bosley as Teddy.

The print isn't that great but considering its age I thought it was good enough. One bonus is the inclusion of the original commercials for Hallmark cards.  I enjoyed those almost as much as the show",1494892800,,676,4.376
8653897,4,B00JUH9FGO,"Mortimer Brewster (Tony Randall) is about to get married to Elaine Harper (Dody Heath.) he knew is family was a little eccentric; however, he had no idea how eccentric they could be. If the cute little Brewster sisters offer you their homemade elderberry wine, I suggest you decline or at least watch this movie first.

I seen the movie with Cary grant and Raymond Massey a gazillion times and can quote from most of the characters.

I have always wanted to see the play. The original stage production ran on Broadway for 1444 performances, from January 10 1941 to June 17 1944. As with many of the movies that are based on plays you can never tell whether the play will exceed the movie and its just a reflection or the rebalance produced as a movie adds a dimension that the play cannot.

This is as close as I can come to the play as it has not been rendered in the area that I know of.

Thereve been several recorded versions; none of them are commercially available on media with the exception of this 1962 made for TV version.
Director: George Schaefer
Writers: Robert Hartung (adaptation), Joseph Kesselring (play)

As a recorded version from the time one will have to overlook the graininess and the audio distortions from the recording. However once you get into the play all of this seems to mysteriously disappear.

My only personal problem was getting use to Tom Bosley (Happy Days} as Teddy Brewster.",1492214400,,1413,4.632
