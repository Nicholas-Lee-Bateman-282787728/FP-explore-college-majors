653315,5,6303471137,Fish hawk is a wonderful movie about an Indian who goes back his people after sobering up.  Will Sampson is the only actor who could give this role true feeling.  It is the first movie to cast an Indian to be the central character and main star.  Worth having in your home DVD movie library.,1197072000,2,291,4.254545454545455
653316,2,6303471137,I Liked this movie but it had to many stero types. Me as a Native Indian it really bugged me. There are some Native Indians who are drunks but not alot. I liked it but not the stero types.,1106006400,13,188,3.8461538461538463
653317,1,6303471137,"As a Native American, I was very displeased with the sterotyped negative image presented by the character Fish Hawk.  Once again, the portrayal of a Native American as ""a drunken Indian"" is set forth in the yet another film. The usual portrayal of Native Americans in film is that of being blood-thirsty, savage, or ignorant. Films also portray Native Americans as being noble savages, vanishing, or one-with-earth individuals. This film was no exception! Hawk Fish was raised by white people according to the narrative in the film yet at the film's end, he walks off into the setting sun fully dressed in his Indian regalia. The film was offensive.",1004313600,30,649,4.954128440366972

7847745,5,6303471137,"I've had the paperback book version of Fish Hawk for years.  Read it many times, and lent it out many times.  I liked the movie, but I prefer the book.  My friends who've read the book prefer it to the movie, but non-readers like the movie.  I think you have to be engrossed with the storey rather than compare movie vs. book.",1404172800,3,326,4.209677419354839

7847747,5,6303471137,This is a wonderful movie that shows how people can be prejudiced against others just because of their race or habits.  The little boy in the movie just sees a nice man that is very brave while other people see him as a drunk.,1307145600,7,226,4.136363636363637
