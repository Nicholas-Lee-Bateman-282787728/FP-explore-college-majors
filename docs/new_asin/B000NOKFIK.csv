2776470,4,B000NOKFIK,"WELL I PICKED UP KARIN SINCE I READ THE CHIBI VAMPIRE MANGA (UP TO 4 WITH THE 2 NOVELLAS) SO I WAS GOING INTO THIS WITH A BIT OF EXCITEMENT....AFTER ALL WE NEEDED A FUN VAMPIRE STORY (THOUGH I STILL SAY THE ORIGINAL VAMPIRE HUNTER D IS THE BEST ANIMATED VAMPIRE MOVIES OF ALL).

ALL KARIN WANTS IS TO BE A SOMEWHAT NORMAL HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT....WHICH IS A LITTLE DIFFICULT SINCE SHE BELONGS TO A FAMILY OF VAMPIRES.  BUT UNLIKE HER FAMILY (HER MOTHER, FATHER, OLDER BROTHER, AND YOUNGER SISTER (WHO IS NOT SHOWING HER VAMP SIDE JUST YET)) SHE DOES NOT SUCK BLOOD, BUT GIVES IT TO HER VICTIMS IN ORDER TO KEEP HER BLOOD LEVELS STABLE...BECAUSE IF SHE DOES NOT IT TENDS TO GIVE HER REALLY VIOLENT NOSEBLEEDS.  BECAUSE OF THIS SHE IS ACTUALLY A DAY PERSON, LOVES GARLIC, AND ENJOYS SWIMMING.  HOWEVER THIS ALL CHANGES WITH A NEW TRANSFER STUDENT JOINS HER CLASS...KENTA USUI, A YOUNG MAN WITH UNUSAL EYES.  EVERY TIME SHE GETS CLOSE TO HIM, HER BLOOD GOES INTO OVERDRIVE AND FORCES HER TO FIND A VICTIM, OR GUSH ALL OVER THE PLACE.  AND THEN THINGS GET WORSE WHEN HE CATCHES HER BITING SOMEONE AND DISCOVERS HER VAMPIRIC SECRET.  WILL SHE EVER ENJOY A NORMAL EXISTANCE?  WHAT IS THE REAL CONNECTION BETWEEN HER AND HIM?  AND WHAT IS WITH THAT DOLL BUJE (PRONUNCED BOOGIE)THAT IS ALWAYS WITH HER SISTER?

OVERALL I WAS PLEASED WITH HOW THIS SERIES IS STARTING, THE ONLY TWO STICKING POINTS WAS SLIGHT DUBBING ISSUES AND THE SLOW STORY DEVELOPMENT.  BUT THIS IS A STORY THAT ANYONE WOULD ENJOY WHO ARE LOOKING FOR A LITTLE LIGHT HUMOR AND A BIT OF ROMANCE......SEE YOU NEXT DISC.....",1180915200,,1578,4.540636042402827
2776471,5,B000NOKFIK,"Vampires, cute characters, comedy, romance, drama and action.  I too have seen the entire series via various channels on the Internet and I very much enjoyed it.  I obviously haven't heard the English voice acting, but the Japanese voice acting was perfect.  I intend to collect the series on DVD and I recommend anyone who has enjoyed series like ""Ah! My Goddess"",""Chobits"" or the romantic comedy in ""Love Hina"" check it out as well.",1179360000,,434,4.837837837837838
2776472,5,B000NOKFIK,"I absolutely love this anime. It's definitely one of my favorites and I highly recommend it. It's a classic girl meets boy story with a twist! I watched it in japanese (w/subtitles of course) last winter and fell in love with it. The characters are awesome and I thought that the plot was really interesting.

I really liked the way they portrayed the vampires and put new spins on old myths. For example, the only reason vampires don't like garlic is because their sense of smell is a lot stronger than humans. They also do not just suck blood and leave their prey for dead. Each vampire has a blood preference. Karin's older brother Ren has a preference for the blood of people who are stressed. When a vampire sucks the human's blood, they are also sucking out their preference. Therefore, in Ren's case, he sucks out their stress and the person, for a period of time after the ""attack"", will feel no stress.

The antics of Karin's family and friends will keep you laughing and Kenta and Karin's blossoming relationship will satisfy your need for a little romance. The supporting cast is hilarious especially Winner Sinclair, a vampire hunter in training, who falls for Karin (obviously she doesn't return his feelings) and fails to realize that she is a vampire. All in all, it's a great show that is definitely worth checking out.",1178150400,8,1335,4.700854700854701
2776473,5,B000NOKFIK,"I technically don't own this DVD, but I have already watched the entire series, via YOUTUBE. ^^;

But anyway...

This anime is about a young girl named Karin, who seems like a normal girl. However, she is a vampire, and has to obviously keep it secret. However, even as a vampire she isn't normal; for some reason, she has spontaneous nose bleeds that make a huge mess, which isn't normal for a vampire. She also sleeps at night and functions during the day, which is another unique trait for a vampire [she can also stand sunlight].

Her life is fine until a new boy named Usui Kenta appears into her life. He accidentally witnesses one of her horrific nose bleeds, then catches her in the act of sucking blood. It is then, he finds out she is a vampire. Good thing this brings them closer together.

This anime is VERY cute, and is one of my all time favorites. :D Go buy it  if you have the chance! If you can't, just watch it on YOUTUBE. You won't be disappointed.",1175817600,5,968,4.355555555555555
8180227,5,B000NOKFIK,"Gosh,it's awesome anime!!! I wish they could make a second season episodes!!! Sighs",1436140800,,83,5.461538461538462
8180228,4,B000NOKFIK,"Karin is the oldest daughter in a family of Vampires. She has a strange deformity. Instead of sucking blood when she gets near her a person with her preferred blood type, Karin produces blood. Mostly it gushes from her nose. She can give her extra blood to humans, and it gives them a positive experience. She meets a boy in school, Usui, who she develops a crush for. She wants to get close to him and have a relationship, but when she gets too excited around him she bleeds through her nose profusely.

This anime has a very fun and playful vibe. The characters and situations are funny and very entertaining. It's almost your typical high school romance/comedy. The Un-Vampire twist makes it quite different. My only complaint with this anime is the production quality. The animation isn't very detailed, and a little bit blurry. Especially in the character outlines. I do like the character designs and coloration though. My other issue is the bad voice acting. Most of the characters sound stoned or drunk. It takes a lot away from the series. I've listened to the English and Japanese tracks. They are both kinda bad. If you can deal with the sub par animation and bad voice acting, this series has a fun story. I have seen the prices on amazon and it's not worth it. I got it on e-bay for a whole lot cheaper. If you decide to try it out, I suggest watching it online or renting it before you buy.",1356048000,2,1404,4.5058823529411764
8180229,5,B000NOKFIK,"When I first watched this I fell in love with the opening. The puppets are hilarious as can be. The family is awesome as well. I own all the volumes, and I haven't been happier with my purchases! The story line is great. There is so much I could say about this series, but the only way for anyone to fall in love with it like I did is for them to buy it themselves. I definitely recommend this volume along with the others.",1266278400,,423,4.0476190476190474
8180230,5,B000NOKFIK,"Do you like vampires? If so, you may like this dvd. This dvd is all about a life of a vampire who is not your normal vampire. Karin (who's the main character) is a vampire who likes: garlic,  and the sun, which are normal vampires worst nightmares.
  What is there to say about this dvd? well, there is alot of comedy, romance, and oh yeah, vampires. This dvd includes extra content of the textless main theme song and it has trailers which are very intresting. I don't want to tell what the main plot line is so if you are intrested at all go and get this dvd. All I can say is it has comedy and romance in it which makes this dvd very entertaining.",1224892800,3,650,4.142857142857143
8180231,4,B000NOKFIK,"Here's a fun fact for you: Japan is the only country in the world that does not have it's own vampire folklore.  It's all imported.  As a result, the Japanese almost always have a unique, bizarre, and interesting take on vampirism, be it the immortal monster who sates his eternal boredom by crushing villagers under his heel (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vampire-Hunter-D/dp/B00004Y7JH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vampire Hunter D</a>), a dark magical girl variation (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vampire-Princess-Miyu/dp/B00005B8U6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vampire Princess Miyu</a>), or the bizarre alien invasion of ""Goke, Bodysnatcher From Hell"" (Amazon, why do you not have this DVD?). Anime in particular is rife with creative variations on our Western vampire mythology and this one takes that license further than any other.  ""Karin"" is a supernatural romantic comedy series based on the popular manga series&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Chibi-Vampire/dp/1598163221/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Chibi Vampire</a>.  That name pretty much says it all.  There's nothing frightening at all about this fanged female.  She's a shy saccharine sweetheart who hasn't yet come into her vampiric powers and can still attend high school during the day while her dysfunctional family slumbers.  It's a flawed but bold concept that falls victim to more than a few anime cliches, but mostly wins the viewer over with fresh ideas, lovable characters, and stylish comedy.

When Karin's powers manifest themselves, she discovers that she is not a true vampire at all; more like a reverse vampire, an unvampire.  She produces blood rather than needing to feed on it and if she doesn't bite a human to inject her blood into somebody, it explodes in a beautiful cascade of the red, red vino (often made to appear as a blast of pretty crimson flowers) out of her nose.  Socially awkward, much!?  I never get tired of her scream of ""IIIYEEEEEEEAAA!!!"" when it happens.  One of the more interesting aspects of the series is what the vamps call ""blood affinity"", which is to say that each nosferatu has an individual human trait that they are attracted to in the blood.  One vampire may not be able to resist the blood of liars, for instance, and when they feed on a liar, that trait will vanish from the human.  Another may prefer vanity, jealousy, or any other negative trait.  Karin is attracted to depression.  And it just so happens that the classmate she has a crush on, Kenta Usui, has a very bad home life.  So anytime she goes near him, her body goes into overdrive and her blood begins to overflow.  She finds some solace early on when she loses control and feeds on Kenta's clinically unfortunate mother, temporarily relieving herself of her excess blood problem and releasing the woman from her deep melancholy.  Karin is appalled at herself and does everything she can to find another way to deal with her problem; throwing herself in to making Kenta happy so that his sadness will not cause her blood to increase.

The coy relationship between the two leads takes up a lot of the series early on and is annoyingly cliche.  I'm tired of anime where couples are perpetually unable to touch each others' hands on accident without blushing and always seem on the verge of the first kiss that never happens (though to be fair, it's a bite in this case) sometimes for seasons on end.  Shows like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Please-Teacher/dp/B000H0MN26/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Please Teacher!</a>&nbsp;have a far more interesting dynamic where the relationships progress more like they do in real life rather than remaining in a perpetual state of naive limbo.  But thankfully, Karin has a dynamic home life to make up for the dud romance.  Her parents are a hoot, her elder brother's constant stalking of every woman he meets is amusing, and her creepy little sister with a possessed cleaver-wielding dummy always on her hand is hilarious.  Early on, an obnoxious, incompetent, overbearing vampire hunter named Winner shows up at the school and (surprise, surprise) falls madly in love with our heroine.  He's an annoying character that adds another layer of cliche and provides few laughs, but is thankfully downplayed for while.  Later in the show when Karin's grandmother, Elda, escapes from confinement (Karin's mom piled rocks on her evil mother-in-law's coffin to trap her) then the series becomes extremely entertaining and even compelling.  The final run takes a seriously dramatic turn as Winner's hardcore vamp hunter grandfather shows up to exterminate Karin's entire clan.  The final episode is mostly in black-and-white save for a lake of blood which produces a very cool effect and makes for a hell of a showdown.  While the show appears set to end on a seriously dark note, it ends up disappointing on that front.  But the incredible imagery of the climax largely makes up for the lame ending that follows.  Another season is somewhat hinted at at the end of the credits, but has yet to materialize so far.

 ""Karin"" is a fun series for someone who is looking for a little light-hearted vampire humor.  The art is extremely endearing (except for Kenta's perpetually vacant, beady-eyed expression) and there are several laugh-out-loud moments like when a curious Kenta asks Karin's mother if she'd die from a stake through the heart and she draws back, aghast and snaps back ""wouldn't anyone?"".  There's plenty of dark humor, some cool imagery, very interesting ideas, and -as I said before- some really likable characters.  It's a very different twist on the vampire genre and anybody curious should give it a shot.

3 1/2 stars rounded up for turning a well-worn genre on it's ear.",1224460800,5,5867,5.371584699453552
8180232,5,B000NOKFIK,Karin is one of my favorite animes out there. This anime is full of fun family troubles that will make you laugh all the way to the emotional teenage drama. Beside being a freaky teenage vampire the main character is this story is easy to relate to. If you're into lots of laughs and tons of fun then this anime is the right one for you!,1201737600,2,337,4.121212121212121
8180233,3,B000NOKFIK,"If you're familiar with the manga, the Karin anime's first six episodes are close to the manga storyline, introducing all new original crappy content with the seventh episode. While the manga has storylines exploring the problems of the son of a poor single mother, a woman's difficulties in a male-dominated workplace, and even a high school student living as a prostitute, the anime ignores the more PG-rated themes, and glosses over the manga's storyline. But, in return, the Karin anime has some of the finest and fun direction I've seen in an anime adaptation of a manga. Vibrant colors and ""snappy"" animation make the first six episodes a treat to watch. But, as said, with the seventh and eighth episodes, the anime introduces a non-manga character, a vampire hunter who can't stand blood. His character development is pretty flat compared to the the two main characters, and is little more than yet another cliched anime stereotype. Enjoy the first six episodes then read the manga.",1195689600,,990,5.006060606060606
8180234,5,B000NOKFIK,"For someone whos usually only a fan of anime series filled with action (violence) and maturity (the occasional adult language) this is one of my guilty little pleasures.

While most of my favorites include Neon Genesis Evangelion, Fullmetal Alchemist, Hellsing, Bleach, Afro Samurai, and Martian Successor Nadesico, this is the rare exception.

As to an actual review, think of your average schoolgirl love story. Now make the main character a vampire.  If that sounds like your thing, then go for it.",1190592000,3,501,5.160493827160494
8180235,3,B000NOKFIK,"This a wonderful series and yet another twist on the vampire myth. For those who do not like subtitles I'm afraid the English dub is net very good with some very poor audio mixing on the English track which makes the voices to loud and background sounds to soft. For those who don't mind subtitles the Japanese language track it brilliant and well worth listening to as it is much better mixed.
In all Karin is an interesting story being part love story be it an awkward one, part comedy, part school drama and part action story but if your looking for horror don't bother, the only scary thing in this series is Kenta's face (Karin's love interest)
I'd certainly recommend giving this series a try as it is certainly entertaining.
For those who insist on watching the English language track I warn you Karin's voice is rather annoying and a very similar to her best friend Maki, its just a pity such a good series has been let down by bad casting and even worse audio mixing.",1189123200,2,976,4.48876404494382
8180236,4,B000NOKFIK,"This series looked interesting, so I threw it into my NetFlix queue.  I watched the first two episodes of the dub and spent most of the time cringing.  I'm not sure who is to blame, be it the voice director or the actors themselves, but the English cast does a horrible job.  I nearly sent the series back, but then decided to first try watching the Japanese version with English subtitles.

It completely changed my view of the show, the characters had more personality and didn't sound as cliche.  Anyone who likes off-beat romance and comedy with a slight horror twist should definitely check this series out, just make certain you set the audio track to Japanese first.",1185667200,,673,4.669491525423729
