8307310,5,B001GX32HI,"I purchased this tutorial DVD for my wife who is an artist and needs high quality photos of her work. It is very informative and easy to understand. More than anything, she loves it.",1363132800,,182,4.382352941176471

8307312,5,B001GX32HI,This is a well done DVD of how to use the Nikon D 90.  I recommend all new D 90 users watch this video even before reading the manual of any books. It will speed up your learning curve,1266105600,,184,3.717948717948718
8307313,2,B001GX32HI,"Ok, but not very helpful.  It is more of an overview of the camera features.  I was hoping that interactive DVD tutorail meant that it would show you how to do something then have you do it. Or here are some examples on how to take pictures.  The D90 is a great camera but this DVD is just OK.",1236470400,,293,3.9322033898305087
8307314,4,B001GX32HI,"I learn and remember much better when I watch something being demonstrated.  Seems like I can read the instruction manual several times before absorbing what one viewing will give me.  This video was very helpful with high production values.  If you're a visual learner like me, I recommend it.",1233446400,,294,4.959183673469388
8307315,5,B001GX32HI,An excellent DVD with explanations and demonstrations of features to quickly ramp up use of the spectacular Nikon D90 camera.  Indexed/Chapters for repeating advanced features until practice makes utilization easier.  A small investment for a Big Return.,1232496000,,254,5.837837837837838
8307316,2,B001GX32HI,"The video is very generic for the most part.  It keeps saying ""your camera"" has this feature.  This indicates that they simply dub in pre-recorded sesssions from other cameras with the same features.  It's relatively short and it doesnt get into any of the nitty gritty, and how to really use all the features. I learned more by watching some free video tutorials on Youtube and reading the manual.",1231200000,,398,4.739130434782608
