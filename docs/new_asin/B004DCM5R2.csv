4332273,3,B004DCM5R2,"A drifter (Kilmer) walks into a police dept. and confesses to 6 murders...before they have happened.  The idea for this movie is very cool and I was actually excited to see a Val Kilmer movie again.  Once again though he let me down.  This is not anywhere close to the crap he has been coming out with for the last 10 years or so, this one had so much potential but never really got going.  When the drifter starts to confess to a murder someone in the police station mysteriously dies in the same manner as the confession (sounds cool right).  The problem is that this movie just felt like it was trying to get really good and never got the push it needed.  If they would have cut a half hour out of it and did it as a TV show in the vain of CSI or Detroit 187 it would have been great.  Too many flashbacks and repeating the same conversations over and over again made the movie feel flat and left me wanting more from it.  Don't get me wrong, it's not terrible but it could have been SO much better. I give it a C+.

Would I watch again? - Probebly Not",1295654400,20,1055,4.08252427184466
4332274,5,B004DCM5R2,"I personally do not understand why this movie received low ratings. I loved this movie. It is one that keeps you watching it to see what is going to happen next. Full of suspense. Val Kilmer is excellent in it and it is one of my favorites of his. I highly recommend the movie. It is one that you need to pay attention to, to know what is going on but it kept my attention from start to finish. It is kind of like Science Fiction and Suspense all in one. For example, if you like movies such as Stephen King's - Desperation, then you would like this movie too. I used Desperation as an example because it is sort of the same type of movie as this one is.",1410134400,2,654,4.038461538461538
4332275,2,B004DCM5R2,"The Traveler (Michael Oblowitz, 2010)

Not long ago (as I write this, anyway), I did a capsule review of a Glenn Ciano movie called Inkubus, with Robert Englund as the titular creature, who walks into a police station and confesses to a litany of crimes, then basically dares the cops to arrest him. Sound familiar? It probably should if you've seen The Traveler, released the year before, with Val Kilmer in the Robert Englund role. Nothing Satanic about this one, though (spoiler alert! well, kinda, if you didn't pick up on the title), but otherwise there are enough similarities between the two that more than once while I was watching this, which I saw a couple of months after Inkubus, I wondered if Ciano was familiar with Oblowitz' film; I wouldn't go so far as to call Inkubus a Traveler mockbuster, but the line's pretty thin there. The Traveler gets a slightly higher rating because Joseph Muscat, turning in his first feature screenplay, put a bit more thought into the characters; they're Chinet(TM) instead of cardboard, but still. **",1407283200,,1048,4.854748603351955

4332278,1,B004DCM5R2,"After seeing this film, I'm pretty certain we have a new front runner for the ""Worst Movie I've Seen All Year"" contest. I should have known a B-Horror movie, starring Val Kilmer, wouldn't be any good, but once again I was fooled by one of those clever bastards who write the descriptions on the back of the box. One a snowy Christmas Eve, a man walks into a Police station, to confess to crimes he hasn't yet committed. It sounded like a cool concept, when in actuality, it was nothing more than a waste of time. Where to begin? First off, this film is so painfully predictable, my dog knew what was coming next. The Traveler must have had no budget what-so-ever, because not only was the supporting cast a complete joke, but so was everything else! From the decrepit, falling apart, Police station to the twenty year old squad cars, and of course the miserable special effects, this film was pure s*** from beginning to end. As for Val Kilmer, he was about as convincing as Tyler Perry is as the new Alex Cross. Seldom have a seen a more lazy and sloppy performance, with such a complete lack of emotion and muffled lines. I really have to wonder if the other actors could smell the manure coming off of him on the set.

1. val kilmer ran out of money for burgers

3. someone had a pretty amazing idea but unfortunately delivered it to the wrong people

i only give this two stars because of kilmer. imagine this film is the vietnam scene in forrest gump. val kilmer is gump running back into the fray rescuing every scene until he gets shot in the arse and finds bubba who dies. like the twist in the end of this film. my netflix subscription is now cancelled to avoid anymore of these debacles.",1348099200,,598,4.330357142857143

4332282,1,B004DCM5R2,I'm currently watching this movie.  Its terrible for all the reasons stated in these other reviews.  I personally like my bad movies to have a sense of humor.

4332283,1,B004DCM5R2,"Val was great but the storyline, setting, and overall production was horrid. Senseless violence with no higher purpose. Had we been shown more internal mental conflicts of the character Val played it might have justified the grotesque killings. But as for the philosophical concepts portrayed it went into the idea of an eye for an eye as each bad cop got killed in a similar fashion of how they had tormented the hitchhiker accused of killing the police chiefs daughter. One gets a feeling the hitchhiker or traveler is justified in seeking revenge but in the end we find out he really did it.

4332284,3,B004DCM5R2,"`The Traveler' (2010) is a strange mixture of a variety of film genres and older, well known (and better) movies. It's a slasher, revenge, ghost story, murder mystery tale with possible allusions to a little demonic possession thrown in just for fun. The central character, aka; Mr. Nobody (Val Kilmer) shares the look and characteristics of such iconic film creations as the Crow (The Crow), Neo (Matrix) and Freddy Krueger (Nightmare On Elm St.). Oh yes, I've left somebody out. Since it's a long haired, somnambulistic Val Kilmer looking enigmatic as he recites evocative and disturbing poetry while his victims die you can't avoid but notice he's doing a less than subtle reprisal of his legendary Jim Morrison portrayal. A convoluted mixture indeed!  Watching the film the Doors song `Riders on the Storm' came to mind. Dark stormy night, a stranger steps slowly and silently out of the darkness into the Police Station with murder on his mind. It's as though the songs gone visual, no wonder Kilmer decided to take the role.

What works well in `The Traveler' is the creation of the surreal, oppressive atmosphere in which the story takes place. That, along with Kilmer himself made the film for me. On the negative side the exploration of this other dimensional-like environment was periodically violated by far too graphic violence that in my opinion interrupted the feel of the storyline, dragging it down to the level of a slasher film instead of a supernatural, psychological mystery.

Bottom line, the film has some very good moments and some very bad ones. It might be worth a viewing. Especially if you're a Val Kilmer fan.",1309651200,3,1637,4.945454545454545
4332285,2,B004DCM5R2,"This should have been good - I mean Val Kilmer, seriously!

But this horror movie starts out okay, and then quickly slides into the realm of B-movie without the fun factor of a b-movie.  Where this movie goes wrong is in it's boring, tedious pace and inane repetition.

Fifteen minutes into the movies I was already thinking to myself ""seriously guys... I get it, you don't have to show me this again"" but they did... and again and again... If the fat and excess were cut out of this film you could have had a fairly good 30 minute film.  Instead you have a bloated boring repetitious monstrosity that never really catches your attention.

Bad gore I can handle, supernatural baddies I'm cool with, abused person back from the dead to get vengeance and we're all good... but make me care at least a little.

The story - a Mr. Nobody comes in to the police station and confesses that he's killed 6 people, coincidentally there are 6 cops there.  As he tells his tales the cops die one by one.  That's really all there is to this... I mean sure there's some crap about how they beat him into a coma when they thought he had kidnapped the detectives little girl, but you'll get to see that for yourself about a hundred times if you watch the film.

BORING

4332286,2,B004DCM5R2,"""The Traveler"" starts out like a spooky paranormal mystery.  Val Kilmer's Mr. Nobody is played with an understated air, creating the sense of mystery.  The handsome Dylan Neal plays the lead Detective Alexander Black whose loss of a child has triggered the chain of events.  John Cassini does an amazing job as Deputy Jack Hawkins who gets spooked and plays the role like a raw nerve before his demise.  The husky Christopher Gauthier plays the dimwitted Desk Sgt Gulloy; one wonders how he got on the police force.  Paul McGillon has a strong supporting role as Detective Jerry Pine who has his eye on Camille Sullivan as the female deputy Jane.  Unfortunately, the screenplay doesn't hold up well with the film degenerating into meat splattered against a wall in what is basically a slasher film.  While there are good performances, the film is not memorable.  Taxi!",1303776000,,868,4.897260273972603
4332287,1,B004DCM5R2,"They clearly blew the whole budget in hiring Val Kilmer, who barely acts.  He seems like he's half asleep the entire movie.  Absolutely no emotion shown -- and not in a good, creepy way, but just boring.  He has like 13 lines in the whole movie but is onscreen plenty.  Most of the time he's whistling some sort of funeral dirge.  It's clear they put it in as many times as they could, as they did the flashback scenes.  They show a lame, grainy, unconvincing 'torture' scene about 7-8 times.  Really.

The plot is predictable at best, incoherent at worst or perhaps more accurately.  The ending makes no sense.  It also ends suddenly with no real resolution.

Another lame fact is that it is shot in some old, crumbling building for no reason other than to be vaguely creepy, and it's all old cars and stuff parked outside, for god knows what reason, as it is set in a contemporary setting.

I could go on but there's really no point.  If you were thinking of renting or buying this, DO NOT.  It is a turd, ladies and gentlemen.",1301270400,17,1029,4.404255319148936

This movie is best described as a much weaker rehash of Clint Eastwood's High Plains Drifter set in modern times.

In the first 15 minutes you have figured out the whole story, the identity of the Traveler is telegraphed much too early which kills any mystery, tension or suspense .......

4332291,2,B004DCM5R2,"Oh, Mr. Kilmer, what's with all these mediocre movies? You used to be in the really good stuff.

This movie isn't terrible. It had real potential; the problem is ""wronged man returns from the grave for vengence"" has been done before, and this movie didn't really feel like it brought anything new to the table.
There were no real surprises, except the end, and that was more of a train-going-off-the-rails than a surprise-twist. I think this movie's big problem is that it revealed the crime of the 6 cops too soon, and then kept rehashing it over and over. Maybe if they'd left the why of it all until the very last minute, dropping hints now and then, but never revealing it until the final showdown, it would have been a more compelling film.

4332292,4,B004DCM5R2,"The movie was like a Freddy or Jason film. You know who the killer is, who is going to die and why they are going to die. The film starts out with a girl, Mary Black being abducted while out in the woods skipping rope and playing with her kitty, Shining. Don't worry, if you miss this scene they will show it 3-4 more times. She manages to get out very loud screams even though the killer has his hand over her mouth.

We flash ahead 1 year later, Christmas Eve at a small town police department. Detective Alexander Black was the father of Mary and is having some family problems mainly over the death of Mary a year ago. Then at 8:14 Val Kilmer shows up as ""Mr. Nobody"" to confess to murders. Val has the eerie appearance of an old fat Jim Morrison and recites various dark lines and truisms such as ""It is the job of the police to protect the rich and persecute the poor."" He also has his own music as he whistles Mozart, which sounds a little like the opening of ""Lassie"" for you old timers.

The soundtrack is a combination of Mozart and Metal. It was good, but it really had an opportunity to make the film. We soon find out that the cops who are on duty had clubbed a drifter into a coma attempting to get him to confess to the killing of Mary Black. They show the torture scene about 6 times. The drifter (never called The Traveler, perhaps ""Drifter"" was already taken) was beaten with a shovel, baton, fist, hung, whipped, and suffocated. Oh yes and stuck with a pen.

Our Traveler is here to get revenge in a strange and supernatural way, which the police quickly figure out. As he confesses to a killing, he is actually describing how a police officer is being killed.

I found the movie to be ""Twilight Zone-like"" at times, and Kilmer, attempting to be the new thinking man's Freddy. His slow monotone speeches are reminiscent of his Morrison readings. I saw this as a film version of dark poetry with cult status potential.
