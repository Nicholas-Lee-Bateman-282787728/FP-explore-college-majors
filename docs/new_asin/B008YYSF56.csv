5195339,5,B008YYSF56,"""Superstar Sisters"" is the latest of the Angelina Ballerina DVD's.  My kids both adore Angelina so they were jumping up and down (literally) when they saw I had a new DVD for them to watch.

This one is about Angelina and her sister Polly.  It's funny because my daughter Paige is 3 and calls her 4 year old brother Reed ""sister"" so this was another good opening for me to have a conversation with them about the difference between brother and sister!  As with my kids, the siblings have a conflict when Angelina breaks Polly's favorite music box.  A great lesson is taught about love and forgiveness. There are several other sister stories, each with their own unique lesson.

I always appreciate the moral lessons and clean humor found in Angelina stories.  The one thing that can be confusing is that there is just one title on the cover (Superstar Sisters) which make it seem it is one movie.  However, it is actually several small stories. The overall plot still involves the sister in each.  I actually enjoy a bunch of smaller stories because it's easier to break their TV viewing in shorter increments.  However, it would be helpful if the menu was shown on the DVD case.

Angelina Ballerina makes a perfect stocking stuffer for the girls AND boys on your list!  Yes my son loves it just as much as my daughter!  I love anything that keeps them BOTH entertained!",1353801600,4,1370,4.6115702479338845
