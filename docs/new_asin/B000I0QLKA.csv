8143081,5,B000I0QLKA,We watched this in our homeschool as we study WWII. We really enjoyed this series very much and it explained things very simply and in chronological order. It was the first WWII documentaries we watched and it was a great foundation for all the others we are watching. I recommend it to anyone who wants to understand about WWII.,1429747200,,329,4.593220338983051
