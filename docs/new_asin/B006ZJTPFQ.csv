8506918,5,B006ZJTPFQ,"Amazing..very glad i bought this. The time frame is perfect when his song-craft and band are at their peak and the still played the early stuff. This is a gem of a chronicle of a musician with a particular voice,attitude and sense of musical history- that once gone will not be duplicated. But we'll always have Ed  Sheeran and Josh Groban  and Kid Rock  true mediocrity never dies.",1489968000,,382,4.588235294117647

8506920,5,B006ZJTPFQ,This package includes two DVDs - 1978 and 1980 concerts filmed in Germany.  I prefer the 1978 concert but both are great.  GP is a prolific song writer and continues to perform nearly 40 years later.  The concerts are great but understand that these were recorded in standard definition so format is 4:3 and appear a bit grainy by current standards.  If you are a GP and the Rumour fan you will enjoy these recordings.,1461369600,,418,4.533333333333333
8506921,5,B006ZJTPFQ,"Graham Parker & The Rumour performing ""live"" back in the late seventies and early eighties were easily one of the best touring acts I saw. Great songs, amazing band and Graham Parker's total command of the stage. This DVD features 2 very different concerts - both of the highest quality. The WDR Studio set has in my opinion the better set list but unfortunately doesn't have the crowd involvement of the Grugahalle Essen concert, but the performance is still exceptional and a true indication of how great Graham Parker & The Rumour were at their peak. I would recommend this DVD set to anybody - fan's of Graham Parker who have not heard his earlier recordings buy this DVD and see the roots of this extremely talented artist.",1453420800,,728,4.6953125

8506923,5,B006ZJTPFQ,"GP used to be a party favourite of the old gang, The Up Escalator & Squeezing Out Sparks got played to death. Bellowing out Discovering Japan with all your inebriated buddies is the stuff memories are made of.  Looking to touch bases with GP again I picked up his Live At The FTC dvd, & while I enjoyed it it left me hungry for the younger, angrier GP. And here we have him. The first concert predates the above mentioned albums, but the second concert is the one I was looking to find! All those great songs I remember coming to life again, live, straight from 1980. Good stuff... no, great stuff! It's a wonderful snapshot of GP in his prime, & this will be my go-to concert when I feel the GP urge.",1412899200,2,701,4.231343283582089

8506925,5,B006ZJTPFQ,Great quality video and audio of Graham Parker & The Rumour in their prime.  I've been a fan since the late 70's and this set is totally worth a purchase.,1358035200,5,154,4.133333333333334
8506926,5,B006ZJTPFQ,"This 2DVD set is an absolute dream for the hearty GP&tR fan. 2 concerts. 1978. 1980. Simple. The first, thank God, was GP&tR captured in early 1978 supporting their Stick to Me LP. This footage is incredible. Accompanied by a 4 piece brass section, the performance is simply jaw dropping. A/V quality is amazing for its age. The 1980 concert is the band, sans brass, supporting the Up Escalator LP.....awesome! Overall the quality of the packaging, liner notes, A/V is excellent! Well done Rockpalast for showing off one the great and most criminally underrated songwriters/bands of all time...Highly recommended!!",1351555200,15,614,5.212121212121212
