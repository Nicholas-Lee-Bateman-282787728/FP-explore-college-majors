4894182,5,B005UNI2YI,"One of my favorite indie films from last year's Sundance was Prairie Love! Daring and original, Prairie Love has a lot of potential with the allures of a Gus Van Sant movie. I loved the balance between dark humor and human melodrama (think FARGO), as well as the broad shots and the minimalistic cinematography which encompass the director's unique vision. Funny, spontaneous and positively bizarre, Praire Love is highly enjoyable!",1338940800,5,432,5.185714285714286

4894199,4,B005UNI2YI,"I enjoyed this movie more than i thought I would. the story line sounded depressing. but actually I found the acting of all the 3 main characters very good. they seemed genuine, authentic. I esp. liked the female character, and would like to see more of her, perhaps in sequel to this one, taking off where the movie ended.  it was good understated movie about love and how it can not be stolen or forced. I liked the gumption of the female character who did not stay stuck in victimhood. but also did not fall into false kindness, either. All 3 characters stayed true to their honest nature. did not really play games with each other. was understated rawness in genuineness. and the bleak environment made all the subtle aspects stand out more. There was nothing to distract really from the real story, which was the humans relating to each other.  and the bleakness of the environment showed the bleakness of the life of the drifter. who like all us just wanted love.",1405296000,,969,4.595375722543353
4894200,3,B005UNI2YI,"The grim isolation of the Great Plains would seem to represent an existential loneliness, scarcity and deprivation that freezes to the bone core of identity.  Not exactly enjoyable, but intelligently done.",1384560000,,205,5.612903225806452
4894201,4,B005UNI2YI,"If you enjoy unusual stories add this movie to your list. Well acted and well,different. Lots of snow so wear a sweater.",1379376000,,120,4.5
4894202,4,B005UNI2YI,"This movie reminds me a lot of ""Fargo"" and its many moments of jolting surprise and impromptu change. While its story or plot may initially appear to be blase - a cowboy drifter aimlessly travelling across a wide-open, snowbound prairie in a beat-up old station wagon - something suddenly happens to change all that. He picks up a hitchhiker whose car has broken down in the middle of a blizzard and, all of a sudden, that which was once a ho hum existence, now becomes a fascinating tale of love, lust and murder. As the hitchhiker shares his story about going to visit a female penpal at a local penitentiary, the drifter suddenly comes alive. As a survivor who has always lived his life on the margins of society, the wonders of sex have never been part of his lonely lifestyle. Now as he listens to the fantastic plans of his new travelling companion, his mind becomes transformed. He, too, wants to be able to have a woman in his life, and the only way he can do it is to hijack the other man's dream. This will involve acquiring critical detail about the woman waiting to be released from prison, finding a way to kill the would-be lover and, then, with his stolen identity turn up to claim his prize and enjoy the moment. Everything seems to work in his favour because he has no real identity but an assumed one. Later on, as events coalesce, the new woman of his dreams will learn the awful truth behind her new Lothario, but the power of love being what it is will stand by her man in the end as they are left to crawl through snowdrifts in an attempt to avoid the law that is closing in on them. As a backdrop to their futile efforts to escape, a church spire can be seen off in the distance, offering them the vain hope of a safe haven.",1367539200,3,1747,4.329268292682927
4894203,5,B005UNI2YI,"I lived in the North for years... you could feel the cold from your theater seats. I really loved the humor; I am so tired of all the movies out there...the same thing over and over again. Prairie Love gives ""love stories"" a fresh face. It is fun and touching. I loved every minute. I shall be watching for whatever this new writer gives us next. We can only hope he doesn't take too long.",1363305600,2,389,4.2
4894204,3,B005UNI2YI,"""Quirky"" is a term that often comes up in my reviews. There's probably a good reason for that, as I tend to lean more towards offbeat films with an oddball sense of humor. Prairie Love had promise to have all of those quirky factors that I love about films, so needless to say it was one I was eager to see.

The film takes place in the icy tundra of North Dakota. We're first introduced to a loner (Jeremy Clark), driving about the snowy roads in a beat up old station wagon, cluttered with trinkets and antique appliances and with a trailer carrying a dead deer in tow. As if that isn't a strange enough picture to imagine, our drifter happens to find a man laying in the middle of the road, near death.

Normally that last part doesn't sound like it would be funny, but when the frozen young man (Garth Blomberg) suddenly awakes in his whitey tighties and begins to spring across the ice road while his skin freezes, you realize the type of humor that is in store. As it turns out, the man that nearly froze to death was in pursuit of his prison pen pal, which he believes to be the love of his life. While the drifter saved the romantic's life, something seems off about the whole situation though.

Things take an even more awkward and humorous turn when we realize that the drifter is planning on stealing the romantic's, known as NoDak, girlfriend whom he hasn't yet met face to face. Thus plays out a series of unusual, darkly comical scenarios that build up to a very unlikely, and yes quirky, love story.

The girl (Holly Lynn Ellis) is soon revealed and keeps up with the peculiar nature of the film. She's as strange as the rest of the characters, albeit quite cute and lovable. I can't help but wonder what she did to wind up in prison. Her naivete and innocence takes her on a journey that isn't quite what she was expecting, and perhaps wasn't what the audience was expecting as well.

I mentioned I love films with a unique sense of humor. This film certainly has a lot of those characteristics. The barren landscape, North Dakotan accents, and truly bizarre characters make this picture stand out. However there were times I couldn't help but feel a little bored. Certain scenes almost felt as if they were quirky for the sake of being quirky, which to me drew away from the real appeal of the film: the characters and their story.

I suppose one could argue many of the aforementioned moments of the film I didn't particularly care for only build on the zaniness of the characters, but personally to me I just felt like they were distractions. Prairie Love is still one of the better and more unique offbeat romances I've seen recently, and the finale really made up for what I felt lacked in other places in the film.

4894205,4,B005UNI2YI,"If you'd like to take a break from predictable Hollywood movies with the usual cast of characters, you may be drawn in to Prairie Love.

Like another movie set in North Dakota (Fargo), Prairie Love depends on the stark backdrop of the landscape, in this case, desolate prairie in winter, to drive much of its plot.

Just the basics of the story: A drifter driving along a lonesome road in the middle of nowhere, dead of winter, comes across a body lying in the road in front of a pickup with the hood up.

Drifter drags the body into his pick-up, along with a small satchel, and discovers a wad of love letters inside written to a woman in prison. Eventually, the ""body"" recovers from the cold and turns out he's still alive. What's more, he was on his way to meet the girl for the very first time after a 3-year penpal relationship, when his truck broke down.

The drifter has other plans, decides he wants to meet the girl and figures she'll never know the difference.

This was a strange movie, one where you're not exactly sure what happened at the end, or what the characters were thinking. Or, for that matter, the significance of the dead deer that keeps pulling a disappearing act.",1347840000,3,1189,4.486111111111111
8486946,4,B005UNI2YI,"That's North Dakota, alright.  A few minutes in, and I could tell right away.  North Dakota has a dismal way about it.  Its lack of trees, I think.  The characters in this film represent the state, maybe with some exaggeration, but close.  Most North Dakotans know well enough not to drive an old car in the middle of winter, for example.  I'd have given it a higher rating had the characters not been so extreme.

If you want to see the state and some representation of the people who live in North Dakota, it's a good watch.  You shouldn't watch it for a pick-me-up.",1492992000,,568,4.394230769230769

8486950,2,B005UNI2YI,"The mystery about what NoDak's Girl had been in prison for was never explained.  A bleak frozenated moo bee but ""nothing unusual"" for anyone aware of the thousands of humans and animals who died in the Forty Mile Desert of dehydration and brutal sun mostly north and somewhat south of the current Naval Air Station at Fallon Nevada during the 1850's ""gold rush"" to what became California.  The Drifter's gunshot wound was most likely a ricochet from the ""Russian Roulette"" single bullet remaining in the gun he was playing cowboy with.  Unclear whether the apparent ""church"" towards which Nodak's Girl headed at the end of the movie was still running its criminal gang organizing functions or whether it had long since been abandoned.  ""Prairie Love"" was too bleak for my taste.",1476057600,,778,4.916030534351145
