8148192,4,B000IZJQQ6,good quality video not exactly what my husband was looking for but he still watches it for a general idea on how to fix some things,1393113600,,131,4.076923076923077
8148193,2,B000IZJQQ6,"While the DVD shows very well how to easily open and replace components in a carb, it fails to show how to diagnose lean conditions in 2 strokes and lean/rich in 4 strokes.  The presenter blips the throttle 6 or so times and tells us it is lean because it didn't ""take"" or rich because it felt ""fluffy"" (or some similar term).  I was very disapointed that I could not return the product since it did nothing for my understanding of diagnosis.",1227312000,4,442,4.378048780487805
8148194,2,B000IZJQQ6,"This video is informative, but it focuses on dirt bikes and ATVs with a single carburetor.  There is no material on synchronizing or tuning a multi-carb engine.",1225584000,3,160,4.925925925925926
8148195,5,B000IZJQQ6,"This is a very well put together DVD. I know motorcycles pretty well, I've worked on many since I was a teen, and although I knew many of the things already, I also learned a few things from these videos. He goes step by step into what he is doing, and explains why. Plus the benefits are that you can always stop, and go back to anything you may have missed. I highly recommended these videos!!",1213228800,2,395,4.2105263157894735
8148196,4,B000IZJQQ6,"This video is exactly what it claims to be; it shows how to rejet and tune a two stroke carb and a four stroke carb.  Its big benefit is that it shows an actual person doing the work, so you know what to expect.  Watching the video will not suddenly make you a competent mechanic, but if you know the theory and are just unsure of yourself, the video will increase your confidence that you are not going to tear anything up by disassembling your carb.

I am not sure that I can do anything now that I could not have done prior to buying the video.  However, I will say that I now have the confidence to actually do a procedure I would not have actually done prior to seeing it done here.  Prior to the video, I was not sure I wanted to take the carb apart myself, because I did not know what to expect.  Now, I see that it is no big deal, so I will do it myself.",1191974400,6,862,3.953757225433526
