7445074,5,B015NERXBQ,"My son LOVES this series, obsessively, (along with Baby Babble) since he was about a year old. He knew all his basic colors at 18 months old, started counting to 10 at 20 months, and at 21 months is starting to recognize letters. Not that it's all attributed to a TV show ;) but I really think that it's helped!!",1455580800,2,312,4.216666666666667
7445075,5,B015NERXBQ,Very good tool for my child who has speech apraxia.,1454371200,4,51,4.2
7445076,5,B015NERXBQ,A great addition to the series. My grandson loves all the videos.,1453248000,,65,4.5
7445077,5,B015NERXBQ,If I could give this 10 stars I would. My three-year-old son who is severe speech delay started watching all of the baby babble DVDs a month ago. These DVDs are like magic. They elicit speech for my son that I didn't even know was there. His speech therapists are amazed. He demands and requests baby babble every day.,1453248000,21,318,4.406779661016949
7445078,5,B015NERXBQ,"I bought the 2nd one probably about a year or so ago & we love it. My now 2yr old says the words before they come up on the screen..This is one of his favorite dvds..Im actually on here now to order 1st & 3rd dvds for Xmas..he will be very happy. Hope this helps ""Just an fyi..The screen shots are not the newest,flashiest looking, but the kids really love it & it does work in teaching them.",1449792000,,392,4.038461538461538
7445079,5,B015NERXBQ,"I b ought this for my normotypical grandchildren, who are aged 9 months and 7 months respectively  I like it VERY much. The focus is on the most common words, which are given with their signs. and they are presented clearly, slowly, and with enough repetition to make them stick.  I gather from the reviews that the three predecessors to this DVD - which nearly everybody thought was terrific for speech development in babies - made adults want to gouge their eyes out because the video presentation was so dated. This one - which only came out this year - is great!

This is an update. This has become the DVD for the daily commute to the day care center for my elder granddaughter (who is now almost 11 months old.) She has been using it on a daily basis for about a month. She could say Mama and Dada before she started using this program, but within a few days she was saying mik (for milk.) At this time she also reliably says book, dog, cat, and ball, and also signs hi / bye, more, and eat. She also clearly has grasped the idea of communication and tries to repeat words we say (including Santa and picture although not this is not consistent.) This video, along with the English as a Second Langauge version of Little Pim, (an immersion English language learning program on DVD for ages 1-5), kept her happy for a recent 9 hour trip to visit friends over her parents' Christmas break. They alternated Baby Babble in between each of the 3 DVDs in the Little Pim series. (I can also recommend Little Pim, which does engage her, although not to the same extent as Baby Babble. English is our first language, but we like this ESL program for receptive English language learning. (We will start using the Spanish version of Little Pim when the baby is solid in English, e.g. probably around ages 2-3. Nobody in the family is a native Spanish speaker, although we all have some facility with the language. )",1449187200,11,1910,4.482758620689655
7445080,5,B015NERXBQ,"Please make more!! This is the ONLY DVD set ever that actually holds the attention of a 16 month old [when we first purchased baby babble] and now we have all 4 and he is 21 months old and he mimics the movement of the mouth, the kids, and makes the noises!!

As parents, it seems cheesy and that you could make it at home with the random toys every few seconds BUT they make the sound, the word, and the letter to all correlate and your child WILL learn from it!",1505260800,,463,4.032608695652174
7445081,5,B015NERXBQ,"My two year old son wasn't communicating as much as we thought he should be, so I ordered this DVD in hopes it would help. It has worked greatly! I am very pleased and my son absolutely loves it!! He has been talking more and repeats a lot of words too!",1505001600,,253,3.980392156862745
7445082,5,B015NERXBQ,My 2 autistic boys (ages 3 and 6) absolutely love these videos. Baby Babble 1 - 3 and now this video have inspired most of the language they currently use and they still love to watch them. They are a delightful mix of odd and informative and include a little bit of sign language at the end.,1505001600,,292,4.140350877192983
7445083,5,B015NERXBQ,"Our son loves this DVD. We play it about twice a day and it has helped him so much with his speech, regardless of only being 15 months old. He has his favorite parts in where he will clap with joy and attempt to sound out the noises and words played. I highly reommend this DVD for any child",1502755200,,291,3.9491525423728815
7445084,3,B015NERXBQ,My son didn't really care for this.  He prefers baby bumblebee.  It's well done however and it's worth trying if your child has a speech delay or you just want to expand their vocabulary.,1502064000,,187,4.470588235294118
7445085,5,B015NERXBQ,The only DVD my kids (almost 2) will watch from beginning to end. Their vocabulary has grown so much from watching these DVDs.,1501718400,,126,4.521739130434782
7445086,5,B015NERXBQ,"My almost 2 year LOVES these videos. He is constantly asking for his ""ooie"" (movie). That is amazing for him because he hardly says any words. I was getting so frustrated feeling like his speech development was wayyy behind so I looked at tons of speech development videos and finally settled with Baby Babble. It took about a month of watching them but he is starting to repeat the words and associate them with stuff when he's not watching. They are pretty basic as a lot of people have said but I honestly think that was the point. These shows are tailored for the kids, not the parents. He won't even watch ""regular"" kids shows. I just went and bought 2 more from the series making 4 total now that we have. So worth the price.",1499731200,,731,4.382352941176471
7445087,5,B015NERXBQ,I put this on for my 19 month old every day. She has a speech delay and she enjoys watching it; she's even started using some of the sign language in the video.,1498176000,,160,3.878787878787879
7445088,1,B015NERXBQ,Not what I expected. Terrible for $15,1497657600,,37,4.428571428571429
7445089,1,B015NERXBQ,"The Baby Babble videos are great. My 4 year old autistic child and my 18 month old both love them. We have owned them over a year and they never get bored. Both girls have them memorized. I do have a complaint. We own the first 3 videos. When the ""new"" 100 words video came out I bought it immediately. However much of it is virtually identical to the first Baby Babble video. I am very unhappy with what I consider false advertising.  Many of the screens are absolutely identical to the older one except that the children have aged. If they would have said it was an updated version of the (very old) first edition I would not have purchased it.  The ""new"" video is much slower than the original. I have tried to get the girls to watch it and they get bored and walk away. Do not buy this video. BB 2 and BB3 are both great as is the original.",1496793600,7,844,4.140243902439025
7445090,5,B015NERXBQ,I started using these for my son when he was two and had a speech delay.  He was later diagnosed with Autism but everyone still comments on how well he makes eye contact.  He took a great interest in the therapists faces in the videos when he first started watching them and through that started looking at everyone's face.  I wish they would make autism specific videos I am sure they would be awesome.  They also taught me how to work with my son and give great ideas for things to do.  I highly recommend this series to anyone speech delay or not.,1496188800,,550,4.300970873786408
7445091,2,B015NERXBQ,"It's okay.  We purchased the second and third DVD which were far better than this one.  This one seems like a mix of 2 and 3 with the therapist's children doing most of the work.  It's not as interesting (except for the screen of butterflies, that was pretty cool) and is basically just a repeat of the others.  Save your money and don't buy this one.",1493424000,,351,4.2727272727272725
7445092,5,B015NERXBQ,My grandson LOVES it. He owns all 4 Baby Babble DVDs. Watches them every single day. I wish there were more,1492905600,,107,4.142857142857143
7445093,5,B015NERXBQ,I cannot say ENOUGH great things about the Baby Babble series. My son loves every DVD and is better at communicating with us because of them. He's more calm and focused when he tries to express his needs to us and it's all thanks to watching baby Babble once a day. It keeps his attention the entire time and he loves all the spinning toys used in the program. I will continue to buy the series as they release more!,1490832000,,416,4.2125
7445094,1,B015NERXBQ,No that great they could have done better on the items they used to teach words,1489017600,,79,4.0
7445095,3,B015NERXBQ,"Wow. What a money-making machine. I'm not a speech pathologist but have an autistic daughter and a toddler. I am educated enough having worked with speech therapists, wife who was an EI teacher and a diverse college education to know that these woman are presenting appropriate information and techniques. I cannot, however, believe that this is a good value at it's price of $15-20. This is a $10 dvd. With all of the material and other videos flying around the realm of youtube and such, this is not a good enough value at this price. For those of us who are dealing with speech delayed children, we know money is a valuable commodity as everything is expensive. The est. annual cost of raising an autistic child is $60,000 a year. Of course there will be those who exploit.

If you've seen Baby Einstein videos, this is not much different. It is very amateur production. I understand that you don't want sensory overload and it's probably two moms that have built this business but for $20 a dvd...",1488499200,,1001,4.655367231638418
7445096,1,B015NERXBQ,This was recommended by a friend.  My two year old was so bored!! There are free Leap Frog videos that she has picked up way more from.  I wouldn't watch it if it was free.  Total waste of money.,1487635200,,195,3.948717948717949
7445097,5,B015NERXBQ,Got this when my babe was 6 months. She loves it! It really grabs her attention. The music is really well done. I also like the use of baby sign and the end credits where you can get a refresher of the signs.  Also the toy list at the end is useful too if you kiddo seems to like a toy they see and you want to know where to get it. Definitely will be downloading the other ones in the future.,1486857600,,393,3.792682926829268

7445108,1,B015NERXBQ,"There's a reason this streaming video has no trailer you can watch before you buy it!!

Or maybe the baby/infant educational video industry is so lame that people think this is a good video??  But I can assure you, if this video ""helped your child learn to talk"" then you child learned to talk in spite of this video, and it was just a coincidence that they watched this.  I'm sure these two mom therapists heart was in the right place, but educating by video production is NOT something they excel at.  Here's a short list of what's wrong with it:
* Bad audio - weird electronic late 70s sound track blaring too high in the mix making hearing word sounds accurately and clearly impossible or at best very annoying.  Pretty stupid if you want the baby to hear the sounds clearly to mimic them.
* Crazy transitions - the video segments are each a few seconds long and separated by crazy 1980s transitions like paint rollers, weird wipes, and psychedelic animations which are practically seizure inducing - if not by the blinking and neon colors, then by their bad  design aesthetic.
* No real ""curriculum"" - Purely random choice of ""educational"" topics per few second segment, in no particular order with no grouping and very incomplete.  For example there might be a baby signed word ""dog"" then a wooden toy train with someone saying ""help"" then a strange plastic frog then a kid blowing at the screen - all in a few seconds.
* Odd choice of non real-world phrase mixing - saying phrases like ""ball in bug"" are weird and just specific to you if you happened to have this strange toy.
* Stream of consciousness editing - bizarre editing and juxtaposing of segments that don't belong together and are jarring video wise.
* Poor production quality
* No real repetition or clear explanation for children
* bouncing words
* bad clipart
* product placement and odd toys they used
* Other than the intro ad - the video itself didn't seem planned or well thought out from an educational point of view - it seemed like it was just geared to get approval of purchasing parents (who might only have a cursory look at the video & might think is good for babies at a glance).  Truth is, if you sit down with your child to view & analyze its teaching potential, this video seems phoned in and made somewhat randomly in a weekend by people who've never ever used video to educate kids.

It occasionally hit the mark with one or two short 5-10 sec long segments which were nice - like the counting dog segment - where it was slow, clear, sounded out nicely, no loud, annoying background music so babies could concentrate and ok graphics on a plain dark background.  But sadly these segments were rare and bookended by nutty, random transitions that detract from learning whether or not the makers of this video think they are ""keeping the attention"" of the babies with these techniques - they are so poorly done, they get in the way of any learning of words or sounds or meaning trying to be conveyed.

I totally would not have bought this if I saw even 30sec of the child segment (not the introduction where they seemingly promise the world but then deliver on none of it once the video gets going).  The fact there is no trailer or even rental of ""Baby Babble - Beginning Words"" is because they are trying to trick you into buying it.

Skip this video if you actually care about efficient learning material for your baby.  It's fine if you don't care what your baby watches or learns from and just want a video to shut them up and keep them fascinated while probably giving them ADHD...",1475712000,4,3572,4.52639751552795
7445109,5,B015NERXBQ,"Whoa, didn't anticipate how receptive my 20 month grand child would be to this DVD! She is mesmerized by it, I especially like that it isn't hyper in presentation, very calm and simple, great for deep learning.",1473811200,4,210,4.702702702702703

TV is not recommended for children under 2.) I have even had some of the kiddos with autism try to imitate some of the sounds.

7445135,5,B015NERXBQ,"I can not be a happier mom! My baby is now 17Month. I'll start from the beginning of why I purchased this and what was the outcome. At 12 months my daughter was very vocal I would point to continents on the map and she would repeat me after awhile I would just point and she would say them herself, her favorite was Asia (her face would just light up when I pointed to it) and no I'm not exaggerating! My babygirl worked hard to learn her continents. So a few months started passing and I noticed she started pointing and crying and never wanted to talk, so I was patient and tried my best to encourage her to speak, saying the object she was crying for like ""juice? Do you want juice?"" Nothing seemed to work! So out of desperation I researched speech delay which to my knowledge my child doesn't have, according to my doctor it is a stage some toddlers go through. I still decided to give this DVD a try and bought the 3 series beginning words, first words, next words. Just in a few weeks my child is talking up a storm. She knows dog, bird (although not taught in this vid), bottle, milk, so forth. She is also repeating me again. Today she banged on the chair and told her friend ""sit down!"" Clear as day! :o she says other things I can not understand at the moment but I'm so very satisfied with the outcome! A+ and 10 stars!! Spent $65 on all 3 videos and I believe it was alot more worth it than the baby Einstein DVD collect I bought for the same price. Also don't know what the other moms are talking about when they say this DVD is very cheaply made and looks like a cheap camcorder recorded this, it looks like baby Einstein videos, with similar toys and babies just more speech and interaction. It is possible they might be referring to the first series which I never purchased because I believe my daughter was a little too big for that one.

This was actually the second one I bought I started with another more simpler version. We watch both now.  It is great helps him and gives me 10 minutes to get a few things done.,1456617600,4,486,3.9690721649484537
7445139,4,B015NERXBQ,This one takes attention away from the action with its clearing the screen stuff.  The curtain calls are a bit too long in my estimation and a bit too frequent.  The first Baby Babble is what I really like!,1456617600,,206,4.256410256410256
8734059,1,B015NERXBQ,"I wish I could give this zero stars! I don't even want to waste my time typing a review, but will do so for others considering this purchasing for $20! Don't waste your money. I cannot believe the positive reviews! I will be returning this.

Anyone who would be inclined to purchase a video to encourage toddler speech would already know how to guide their child through these ultra basic words by commenting on the environment on a continual basis. Is the purpose to plop your kid in front of it, and go about your chores? I purchased this for my 18-month-old grandchild who was not at all entertained, and is way beyond this. We have a deaf person in our family and we all sign fluently, and sign with all the babies, so found the signing ridiculously limited.

The entire video consists of toys (really?), two speech professionals (totally void of personality), and several bigger kids (who add nothing to the purpose of the DVD). Toys are abstract representations of objects in the world. Why not show a real train, car, horse, etc. with their respective sounds and say the appropriate name? What is the purpose of a woman on a screen signing ""up"" or ""ball"" without context? The kids (most likely the offspring of the pathologists) are obviously feeling awkward on camera. Come on now, broaden your scope!

If you're looking for something digital, there are 100 other great choices, one being Sesame Street for free on TV that offers a well rounded exposure of many topics and provide entertainment at the same time. Or just take your kid to the store, the park, a restaurant, and let him soak up the world. That would be much more beneficial.",1535673600,,1647,4.652920962199313
8734060,5,B015NERXBQ,"Yes,  this video is support my child's speech development. Her speech therapist has noted viedo modeling works with children as it doesn't place challenging demands on a child, but still offers teaching to enhance language development,  which this video offers. Once my little one understood how to imitate,  this video has helped her to expand her sign language and speech.",1526688000,,374,5.2
8734061,5,B015NERXBQ,"Awful to watch as an adult but my 2 year old has not been wanting to try to talk and a few weeks after watching these videos every day, she is trying to say new words all the time! It really holds her attention and she enjoys watching this series. I also have a 6 month old who watches along and appears very interested.",1524441600,,320,4.015625

8734063,5,B015NERXBQ,"I ordered this back in 2015 for our daughter who had turned 2 and was pointing and comprehending, but not verbally speaking.  When I watched it the first time with her, I was thinking ""this was a waste of money"" but when the DVD finished, she said ""hi"".  Every time she watched it, she added more words to her vocabulary.  Fast forward a month later and she was a talking machine, and has not stopped since!  When we had our other kids, I had them start watching this around 6 months old and both were saying 20-30 words by age 1 and sentences by age 2!  We also purchased baby babble 2 & 3 to keep up the good progress and love them all.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND- and get it earlier rather than later!",1523491200,,695,4.18796992481203
8734064,4,B015NERXBQ,"Worth the money! At first you may think ""what did I just purchase?"" I bought this for my 30 month old since he was struggling with speech development. My son was interested for the first 3 minutes and then he walked away. However, I played the videos daily and each day he would become more interested. He loves the videos, has improved in his speech and is learning sign language. We have both videos, TM and Beginning Words.",1519948800,,426,4.4743589743589745
8734065,5,B015NERXBQ,"*******UPDATE: She is now 10.5 months old and has 20 words. I can't recommend this enough. She no longer watched this video, but she does watch Baby Babble 2 and 3 every day.*******

I don't usually write reviews, but I needed to let other mamas know about this video.  I let my daughter watch this every day right around when she turned 6 months old.  Within ONE WEEK, she was saying Mama. She is now 7.5 months old and I have purchased the set.  She has been watching all three and they all hold her attention for the entire video.  She currently says mama, dada, ball, water, baba and nana.  Maybe I just have a really smart baby, but I have to believe that these videos helped in some way.",1516665600,,693,4.292307692307692
