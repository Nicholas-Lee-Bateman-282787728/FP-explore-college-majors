8676054,5,B00N3N6F8C,really good collection of episodes!,1452729600,,35,6.2
8676055,5,B00N3N6F8C,This is a great addition to the series because Robo Knight learns the true meaning of Christmas and the value of friendship and teamwork from some children in a town in Africa.  The rangers also learn about the power of the holidays and how much Robo Knight is a part of their team as well as the joy of the holidays through Robo Knight's inexperience with it and they also learn the true meaning of Christmas just like parents do through their children.,1423353600,,454,4.469879518072289

8676059,1,B00N3N6F8C,"Don't waste your money on this. Only 1 episode of megaforce on this. If you want to buy power rangers purchase the volumes. At least you will get 4 episodes on those. Better yet wait until full seasons get released. The more you buy volumes, the more greedy ionsgate wil get. Just look what they are doing to the twilight saga. It never stops. Save your hard earned money.",1416268800,,372,4.405797101449275
8676060,3,B00N3N6F8C,"While this is an interesting and heart-warming take on a Christmas special, but it's not the best. Robo Knight gets mistaken for a big Christmas toy and is sent to Africa as he talks about the Megaforce rangers. It's a clip show like the last few Christmas specials have been. It's good, but there are much better Power Rangers Christmas specials.

Also includes (according to walmart's website):
""Team Carnival"" - Wild Force
""Spirit of Kindness"" - Jungle Fury

These bonus episodes have nothing to do with Christmas.",1411603200,2,517,4.931034482758621
8676061,1,B00N3N6F8C,"I'll only care about the Halloween and Christmas specials of Power Rangers Super Megaforce ( if they ever get made ) if they will include Legendary team morphs into Power Rangers In Space , Lightspeed Rescue , Time Force Operation Overdrive , the rest of Orions Legendary 6th ranger modes and the Super Megaforce Christmas Ranger ; not if there a bunch of flashbacks of previous episodes like this stupid DVD . However , I did like how Robo Knight help give those adorable kids in Africa a very happy Merry Christmas .",1411430400,,518,4.580645161290323
