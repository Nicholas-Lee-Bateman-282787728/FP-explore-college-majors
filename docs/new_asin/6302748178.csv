This video is a great supplement to the entire presentation - it has interviews plus clips, which definitely help children in other countries grasp the idea of why there was a civil rights movement in America, what was going on at the time. Also the video is not too long and not short, a good 45 minutes, which is about all the attention span most elementary school children have.",1392768000,,535,4.36
