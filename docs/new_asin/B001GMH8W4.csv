3616523,5,B001GMH8W4,"I have been a Transformers fan for many years, so when I saw this DVD set online, I knew I had to have it.  The episodes are well-written with plenty of action, although the CGI animation used for the Transformers could have been of better quality.  Other than that, this is a great addition to the collection of any Transformers fan.",1237248000,3,334,4.459016393442623
3616524,4,B001GMH8W4,"I have been waiting a a complete english dubbed Transformers: Energon collection and this is it, as before this DVD set was released, the only DVDs of Energon were scattered episodes. This series carries off straight from Transformers: Armada and then follows through into Transformers: Cybertron. It was a mix of CGI and anime-style cel animation. I find the CGI a bit clunky, but it's enjoyable and the storyline continues from episode to episode, rather than unrelated episodes strung together, so I would recommend this series to Transfans and children 10+.",1232841600,8,561,5.175824175824176
3616525,5,B001GMH8W4,It's about time this show came out to dvd. Energon is a grate show for that Unicron was in it way more then he was in Armada. RC came back & thanks to that we got are first RC toy. This is a grate show that had one bad thing. KICKER. Other then him this was a grate show. Let's hope Hasbro put's out R.I.D. Next.,1224115200,2,312,3.742424242424242

if you have not seen this show then i recommend you do",1403913600,,1168,4.938775510204081
8306120,4,B001GMH8W4,"Well to me this was good since i could see the whole thing instead of the one they just came out with with Shout Factory doing it which made the whole thing to Big TVs and not good for Flat screen TVs which is better, this Set is very cool,
So if you are going for the whole Season instead of this one then good luck because Shout Does not tell you all the facts,
TO me a cool show
Good luck to all,",1399593600,,399,3.761904761904762
8306121,2,B001GMH8W4,"THEY COMPLETELY forgot that autobots and decepticons can turn into vehicles, animals, and so on.  In this series, we get the morphing subject in only 2 or 3 episodes.  I recommend all transformers series except this one.  I do give them 2 thumbs up with the CGI / cell shading style, but give us a way better story.  And get Transformers prime onto DVD",1321488000,,352,4.453125
8306122,5,B001GMH8W4,"Although I have yet to watch any of the discs yet, I would likely still enjoy the series since I've seen some of the show's episodes while it was still on television.  If you are a transfan and enjoy transformers in all its forms and have the DVD sets like the original series, beast wars, or any other sets and want to complete the collection without cybertron for now, go ahead and get this set.",1319760000,,397,4.293333333333333
8306123,5,B001GMH8W4,"Great service dvd's in excellent condition, fast delivery ! The collection was well worth it my boys love it. Would definitely buy from seller again.",1314230400,,149,5.0
8306124,4,B001GMH8W4,"I've seen all but about 10 episodes or so. So far, its been a fun series to watch. I've been entertained by the Unicron storyline and can't wait to see the finale. It was tough to get through as it began to get boring, but gets better as you go. The biggest problem with this series is Kicker!!!! He is the most annoying character in Transformers history. I hate that he plays a pretty big role in the series. Its still a fun show to watch and I love many of the characters. My favorite being Omega Supreme up to this point. I recommend this series to all Transformers fans. Its not as good as Beast Wars,Beast Machines and some others, but still pretty good",1309392000,2,658,4.272
8306125,3,B001GMH8W4,"Energon, the second installment in the Unicron Trilogy, (Armada, Energon, Cybertron) proves to be a pretty interesting series. Although slower and not as ""emotional"" as Armada, its still a good cartoon to watch if you love anything Transformers. Like other reviewers will tell you, the anime style IS clunky and not very realisic. And the kids in the series can get bothersome. Armada ""grabbed"" you more, while this is just a basic version of the TF's, nothind extraordinary. The good points are that the storylines continue from show to show, and pick up exactly where they left off, so its like one long movie. Also its cool to have watched the entire trilogy, so you don't feel like youve missed anything. Arcee returns as well, and is one of the more interesting characters.",1248912000,3,778,4.857142857142857
8306126,2,B001GMH8W4,"This series might have been OK, but the character Kicker is so freaking annoying that I want to slap him everytime he opens his mouth. What's worse is that everyone in the series tolerates his near constant tantrum-like behavior. The only character that comes close to his level of annoyance is his dad, especially that idiotic laugh of his.

With the exception of Megatron (and perhaps Shockblast and Starscream as well), the Transformers themselves are not very well portrayed either.

This series is so dull that I have yet to finish it, and I bought it nearly six months ago.",1246492800,2,579,4.78
