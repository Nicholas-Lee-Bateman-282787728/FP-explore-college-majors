6822402,5,B00PV09C6M,"This is not just another cheesy teenager slasher flick ..,the cover art and name do not do it justice !
This film has an outstanding serial killer plot.... ,a young ,newly promoted cop trying to avoid getting eaten by a killer crock.
It stars the villains from some of today's best crime T.V. shows,including ; SONS OF ANARCHY,JUSTIFIED ,BATES MOTEL,and BREAKING BAD, doing a suburb job of acting as hardened detectives ,playing poker and reliving their best arrests.
The production quality was first class, the acting was great !
The suspense was so captivating the movie dose not close from story to film right up until the credits roll !
( Meaning you cant distinguish the story from the movie )
ABSOLUTELY GREAT FILM MAKING AND GREAT STORY TELLING IN THIS GENRE !***",1418256000,3,770,4.796992481203008

Just another sadistic serial killer with unlimited time and money to spend Super Gluing a cop to a wall.................................VERY hard to do, if you think about it.

He must have had to use the superior adhesive, at conservatively, $5.00 a tube, multiplied by 35 (that the killer said it took), is $175!  Damn!

I think this serial killer was just in a bad mood because he didn't have anything better to do than trying to get a man to adhere to a wall, AND it cost an arm and a leg. (Sorry)  Maybe he needs a new hobby, or could try volunteering.",1418256000,,627,4.362068965517241

6822408,5,B00PV09C6M,"Just like the headline on the cover reads: ""A Damn Good Story"".  This is an indie crime thriller with lots of suspense modeled on films such as: Saw franchise, Seven (1995), and The Collector (2009). The story revolves around a group of policemen, who like to meet for a poker.  Once at the table they tell each other stories from their work, not just ordinary stories, but rather most memorable stories that contain a lesson to be learned from.  These stories are always addressed at a new rookie officer, in this case at a guy named Jeter (Beau Mirchoff).  The entire film is composed of two parts, the part where they all sit at a table and tell each other the stories, and the part where Jeter gets kidnapped and imprisoned by a psychotic child molester who is more clever than...

The film has an interesting ending, un-Hollywood like.  I wonder if there will be a continuation to this film.",1431820800,,896,4.56875

More then once, I caught myself saying: ""The people who made this movie were a little crazy."" I also appreciated the fact that it didn't dwell on the bloody moments.

6822418,3,B00PV09C6M,"This film is actually not your standard, linear horror/thriller film. It is more a collection of short tales that come together to tell a story that kind of runs in the background as each short tale adds to the larger story. It is a fun film - no scares, a couple of thrills, but generally more a psychological thriller than a horror movie.

This film is actually quite unlike the DVD artwork, which gives the impression that you are in for a horror story featuring that spooky-looking figure).",1422057600,7,494,4.613636363636363
6822419,5,B00PV09C6M,"Stan Jeter (Beau Mirchoff) recently got promoted to detective. He is the rookie at poker night, where all the detectives sit around and tell stories. The rookie is to learn from those stories and the experience of seasoned veterans. Poker night runs as a flashback as Jeter is held captive in a basement while Amy, his slightly underage girl friend (Halston Sage) is chained in a nearby room and apparently is getting raped, although the film didn't make that clear. As Jeter experiences abuse of his captor he flashes back.

It isn't hard to figure out the flashbacks. When his mentor's tell detective stories, Jeter imagines himself as being there, which might confuse viewers. The film has some small twists and it isn't until the very end do we appreciate the genius of the film.

6822420,2,B00PV09C6M,"Numbingly mediocre crime film about tough guy cops telling stories and a serial killer who is keeping a police officer and his slightly underage girlfriend prisoner for weeks, chained up in a basement.  The poker night of the title involves a bunch of veteran police officers telling stories which are supposed to impart wisdom on the young cop who has just made detective.  That young cop is lured right after poker night by the serial killer--he's the one chained up in the basement.  The movie cuts back and forth between his memories of the stories told at poker night and his current predicament as the prisoner of a masked serial killer.

The most immediate problem with Poker Night are the stories--not one of the tales told by the veteran police officers is interesting.  One involves a detective who knows in his bones that a perp killed two fellow officers and buried the bodies.  He diligently works two years of overtime tailing his suspect but never finds a thing.  Finally his superiors pull the plug.  So he goes to a bar and buys his suspect a drink claiming it's the best day of his life because after two years of searching he found the bodies of two slain police officers nearby in the woods--then he buys the perp another drink and leaves.  Ten minutes later the perp drives out to the woods to see if the bodies he buried had been dug up--and seeing everything looking normal leaves not realizing that he had been tricked by the detective who followed him and now had what he needed--the exact location of the bodies.

The moral of this story is supposed to be to use your brain but wouldn't it have been more impressive if the detective hadn't wasted two years before tricking the suspect into revealing the location of the bodies?  The story actually makes the detective look like an idiot.  Then there's the obvious logic issue--it's very clear that the suspect has no idea whatsoever who the police detective is--if this guy was a suspect wouldn't the detective have interviewed him at some point during the investigation?  How is it possible that this guy has never once seen the cop who was obsessed with catching him for two years?  What kind of police work was this detective doing where he never interviewed his suspect?

Major logic problems surface again later--the missing police officer was lured with a phony 911 call.  The police were able to trace the call to a specific neighborhood.  The neighborhood apparently consists of a house without any neighbors for two miles--so why does it take nearly the entire movie for a detective to figure out that it might be a good idea to check out that house?

It eventually becomes clear that the recounted stories are supposed to help the imprisoned police officer figure out how to turn the tables on his captor but the relationship between what the young police officer is supposed learn from these stories and the predicament that he's in simply isn't there beyond very general bromides like never give up and use your head.

Poker Night never manages to generate much dramatic interest or suspense from the individual stories or the predicament of the imprisoned police officer and his girlfriend--the movie mostly plods along with its phony tough guy dialogue and lazy storytelling for 106 seemingly interminable minutes, finally ending with one final twist that can only be described as completely idiotic--even by the low standards set earlier in the film.

So why am I giving Poker Night two stars?  One star is for the cast which generally does a good job of selling the weak material.  I couldn't figure out which actor played the serial killer based on the IMDB list of parts but he was particularly good and deserved more screen-time.  The second star is for the fact that Poker Night looks uncommonly polished for a low budget movie--not quite stylish but in that neighborhood at least.  Those two virtues might be enough to make Poker Night an acceptable time-waster but being watchable is as good as Poker Night ever gets.",1420934400,,4015,4.7771345875542695
6822421,5,B00PV09C6M,"Great movie, worth the rent, but should be lower priced. As one review I read stated, ""Don't let the cover fool you"", and that is a very true statement here.  This is a hidden horror gem, with good acting, and AWESOME one of a kind plot.  Highly recommended to thriller/suspense/horror fans! Not at all cheesy or campy, but uses a unique scripting device to make this movie a wonderful one to watch.",1420848000,2,399,4.527777777777778
6822422,4,B00PV09C6M,"I'll be honest, I'm not exactly sure WHAT to make of this movie?  For the most part, I enjoyed it, but some other parts just didn't add up.  What I DID enjoy was the way the movie added a comedic element to the suspense.  I mean, you NEVER see the antagonist's face until the end.  When he is actively describing his role or what lead him to make the decisions he's made, he's always wearing that mask!  I enjoyed that for some reason?  The acting was top notch and there was a surprisingly large number of known actors in this film. (Though you might not know their names, you WILL recognize their faces).

The movie progresses through the stories the officers tell during their ""Poker Night"".  They all group together to ""educate"" the newest member of the team with each tale adding a critical technique that has helped them on their paths to being the best in the business.  It's almost an anthology of sorts.  I also enjoyed the way Beau Mirchoff's character, Jeter would sometimes ""take over"" the role of the protagonist during each story.

Overall, I really enjoyed the movie.  As I said, the acting was great and the stories were entertaining, however I don't believe that everything is answered or correctly described during some parts of the film and that caused some (very few) parts to be a bit confusing.

Final Verdict:  Watch it.  You won't be bored!",1420588800,2,1364,4.601659751037344

6822424,4,B00PV09C6M,"Poker Night is a modern playing out of an ancient ritual of older men initiating youths into the knowledge for surviving and for mastering a dangerous craft.

As might be expected they bond over alcohol and a game--the title captures these givens.

The youth is a lucky and smart detective just promoted; the elders are worthy veterans relating stories meant to prepare the youth.

Gifts and luck only go so far; experience is hard won since it is often learned through making painful mistakes and surviving. Such knowledge plus time is wisdom--something the young cop knows is of value.

The situation of the frame story--the separate wisdom tales exist within and relate to the frame story-- is the young police officer and a female victim have been kidnapped and are under the control of a brilliant and lucky serial killer whose cruelty rivals the similarly masked monster found in the Collect or/ion franchise, although the new monster has a sense of humor.

Within the brutality and horror of this kidnapping, the verbal brutality of poker night offers comic relief. Mockery, put downs, teasing that borders on assault go nonstop to numb the pain that goes with the job and the physical torment of ongoing torture.

These observations are as far as I need to go--enough about initiation!

What about the cast?

Just for fun a casting director dealt viewers a Seven Card Royal Straight Flush. If you have watched Justified and Breaking Bad, you'll see the familiar faces of supporting actors who impressed you already. The high card is Ron Perlman who has delightfully and masterfully played a leonine Beast, an early ancestor of man in search of fire, a likable creature from hell, and leader of a biker gang. His and the entire casts' performances are flawless.

Poker Night is remindful of Fight Club in being so primal it seems a shared personal experience rather than merely another violent movie.

It is an experience worth having.",1420070400,3,1942,4.91131498470948
6822425,5,B00PV09C6M,"Comments I heard as the credits rolled...""that was really good,"" and ""that movie got smarter and smarter as it went along...""  I agree with the sentiments.  It's easy, very early in the movie, to think that we, the viewers, will be following a well-worn track of mindless button-pushing, but this is not at all what transpires during the rest of the film.  The surprises get better, tighter, as the story progresses.  No one is good, but ""the man"" is truly bad in some ""good"" ways (and we don't talk about the ones that are smarter than we are...).

I hope Greg Francis gets the opportunity to do some more work like Poker Night.  I'll be watching.",1419292800,3,648,4.543103448275862

8689419,4,B00PV09C6M,"POKER NIGHT

I will admit here and now that the cover of the DVD is what got me to buy this movie when it came out. The one with the killer in the mask holding out cards with the joker one front and center. Also I liked cast members like Ron Perlman so I had to have it. It sat in the collection for a while until my brother, grandparents and I  decided upon it one night during an all day movie marathon. Turns out that I am very glad I bought this.

Stan Jeter is a new detective and as such he has been invited to  participate in a poker game with the veteran detectives on the force. These guys are split on the new guy and make known to him. Still regardless he is at the game and as tradition states with these guys the each tell him a story from their cases in order to teach him lessons. As it turns out after leaving the game he is kidnapped by a psychopath who also kidnapped a young woman. So now the young detective must use those lessons he learned to save not only her but himself as well.

This was a cool watch as the turns were not obvious for the most part, sure you could see some coming but others, not so much. Writers Doug Buchanan and Greg Francis who also directed did a really good job with this film. I really wish they would do more together, plus Francis also directed episodes of one of my all time favorite shows A Haunting. The performances from the entire cast is great but I really enjoyed the lead villain played by Michael Eklurd.

As normal I was disappointed that there was no commentary, would have loved one on this flick as these low budget horror  flicks are the best for those. Still it is recommended for those who like these dark detective films.",1520294400,,1690,4.1656441717791415
