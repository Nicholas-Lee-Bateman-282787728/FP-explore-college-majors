8667826,3,B00LSPOFWA,"Anna Nix (Sara Malakul Lane) kills her step father in self defense. She is sentenced to be in a nubile prison sexplotation film filled with drugs, shower scenes, a rapist warden, and girl/girl action. Oh yeah, she plays a cello.

The acting was what one would expect from an Asylum film as they used their regular stars. The dialog wasn't great, but if the object is to watch 30 year old Sara Malakul Lane undress looking like 17, then the film achieved its goal. There is no watching the film for any deep underlying message, nor would I call it a film about redemption. It is a prison girl film. Not as great as ""Chained Heat"" but meets the requirements.
