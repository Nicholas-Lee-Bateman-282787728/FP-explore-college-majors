8624518,5,B00GM78U2A,"one of the most touching stories of  how one man who loves JESUS impacts the lives of others. his commitment to serve faithfully the hurting, lost, wounded  ones made me examine my own heart motives when I do things, is it genuine care for the other person, am I willing to pay the price of telling them truth or is all about me and me looking good.",1409097600,,349,4.1940298507462686
8624519,5,B00GM78U2A,"Padre Pio Miracle Man is incredibly well done. The acting is superb; the beauty of the filming locale spectacular; the movie riveting.  It opens with Pio as a child being terrified by a satanic attack, something he would suffer throughout life.  In this regard, the movie is not recommend for viewing in the presence of young children.  In his early youth he meets a young Franciscan and from that day forward his desire is to join the order. There is the oft-observed struggle in the lives of other saints, of poor parents trying to finance study for the priesthood. His father must go to the US to earn the needed money. Pio has extremely poor health from birth to death. No laudatory adjective can overstate the films ability to depict the suffering of an individual who instead of complaining is patient, loving and caring.  His deep humility is echoed when he receives the stigmata; Pio is ashamed.  The producers underplay his numerously documented miracles to focuses on his care for souls, his restricted ministry while being under Vatican investigation and the constant skepticism by a local, bishop.  The secret Vatican documents, in their entirety, were recently published, forty years after the Saints death (The Secret Vatican Files, by Francesco Castelli, 2011, book and kindle).  The extent of Padre Pios interactions with soldiers of WW II is left out, including his appearance in the sky to prevent bombing of a suspected ammunition depot near his monastery. Eyewitness accounts of his many supernatural gifts, especially his ability to read souls in the confessional are easily accessible on the Internet.",1408579200,2,1623,5.056179775280899
