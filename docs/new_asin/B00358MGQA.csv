8436381,5,B00358MGQA,"As dancer, storyteller and producer of this DVD, I'd like to share a bit about this product for those who are curious. In this story, I offer my artistry to bring to life the dynamic character of Mary Magdalene. She is a window to the Divine - she leads us to the doorway of grief and with her we travel through death into the garden of new life. Through her deep devotion, courage and love - she opens our heart to the mystery of Jesus.

The DVD also includes supplementary material for use in small groups such as women's groups, bible studies, prayer circles, retreats, and classes:

- Artist's Introduction
- Mary Magdalene Feature
- Reflective Meditation
- Participatory Dance/Movement Workshop",1284940800,,699,4.768595041322314
