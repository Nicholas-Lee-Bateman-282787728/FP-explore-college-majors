Second, being a huge baseball fan the movie was even greater.  Third, I got an even greater treat with the romance between Costner and  Preston. I must say this was a movie my husband I both could enjoy. Sports  and romance! I can't wait till this movie comes out on video so I can watch  it once again.",952214400,9,459,4.066666666666666
61609,5,0783240473,"Shows the stuggles and joys of an incredible pitcher who's getting too old to pitch, his passion.  But also wants to start settling down and having a family.  Another great and moving baseball film done by Kevin Costner.  Amazing...",950832000,,232,4.897435897435898
61610,5,0783240473,If you love baseball this movie is for you. All of you that played the game or coached can identify with some part of the movie. The director went to extra efforts to make the baseball plot believable. The players are real  players and various scences are taken from real events (baseball hitting an  outfielder on the head a la Conseco).  Relationships in the movie are  portrayed in fashion that is agreeable. Casting is superb. Great  entertainment for the money!,950832000,10,466,4.775
61611,2,0783240473,"I was ready to watch a baseball movie and a love story broke out! Kevin, puhleeze, one genre at a time. Costner at his self serving best in both sport and love. Seems this guy can't figure out a theme for this film. If  you want lots of angst and little curve ball, this film is for you. If not,  rent ""The Natural"" still the best fictional baseball movie ever  made.",950659200,,367,4.140845070422535
61612,2,0783240473,"FOR LOVE OF THE GAME takes you inside the mind of a star baseball pitcher as he plays in what could be the last game of his career.  When I saw the picture at the movies it made me think of the book HEAT, the autobiography  of pro pitcher Dwight  Gooden.  FOR LOVE OF THE GAME and HEAT revolve  around thoughts of family and career as the man on the mound, considered  washed up by some, finds himself in what could be a no-hit game.

Gooden  had his dying father on his mind as he was getting the ball past the bats  on that day in 1996.  FOR LOVE OF THE GAME's Billy Chapel, played well by  Kevin Costner, had thoughts of his late parents.  But unfortunately, the  film puts too much emphasis on Chapel's girlfriend, who may be ending their  relationship.  Aren't girlfriend stories for teenage boys, not 30-something  adult men?  Each time FOR LOVE OF THE GAME's baseball sequences start to  engross you, it cuts to flashbacks about the woman the pitcher has loved so  much through the years that, uh, he never married her?

See FOR LOVE OF  THE GAME on free or cable TV, where Costner, supporting actor John C.  Reilly and the exciting baseball sequences (the director is Sam Raimi of  EVIL DEAD fame) make it worth a look.",950227200,,1227,4.379464285714286

61671,1,0783240473,"Review of For Love of the Game
Hot Toasty Rag, June 18, 2017

Kevin Costner plays a handsome, famous baseball pitcher who can have any woman in the world, and for absolutely no reason, he chooses Kelly Preston, a bespectacled, mousy, problem-ridden, ordinary girl. Straight out of the Every Womans Fantasy playbook, a role Costner has shouldered several times over the years. In his own words, shes a bummerthat line is my favorite part of the moviebut he just cant live without her?

At two hours and twenty minutes, For Love of the Game is far too long. I kept fast forwarding to get to the ending. Shes unlikable, hes unrealistic, the pseudo-sad piano music will drive you insane, and theres not enough baseball to make it an interesting sports movie. Then again, since it really isn't intended to be an interesting sports movie, theres altogether too much baseball, adding to the boredom that sets in as soon as Kelly Preston shows up.

Unless you're angry with someone and want to torture him by sitting him in front of this movie, theres really no reason to rent it. I know thats harsh, but Im still trying to figure out why anyone, after reading the script, agreed to make it in the first place.",1498262400,,1202,4.633802816901408

61710,5,0783240473,"If you are a baseball fan...a true baseball fan, not the commericialized baseball of today, you MUST have this movie. A story of a boy who played catch with his father who turns pro. Billy Chapel signs to a professional team as a pitcher and has great loyalty to the team (as the players use to have). The aging Billy Chapel is coming to the end of his baseball career and needs to make a decision whether to pursue his long time love of baseball, despite being traded to another team, or pursue his new love Jane. Of course, there are all kinds of twists and turns influencing his final decision. If that isn't enough, the legendary Vin Scully makes an appearance as himself broadcasting Billy Chapel's attempt to have a perfect game while having flashbacks on the mound and in the dug out of his baseball journey.

61726,5,0783240473,"I love baseball, but as a female, born in 1946, there was no chance I could have become a professional.  This movie allows me to live my dream through Billy, feel what it is like to actually be there, playing.  From 1958 I have listened to Vin Scully, the very best announcer.  The whole package, the flashbacks, the story, pulls me in and makes my day, every time I watch it.  When Billy stands on the mound, stares in at the batter and says ""it's just you and me, ugly"", I cheer.

61751,5,0783240473,"First let me say that I am a huge Kevin Costner and Major League Baseball fan, so I may be biased in liking this movie. Although the characters are somewhat stereotypical, the romance is not traditional. The plot device of having Dave Chapel, Kevin Costner's role as a major leaguer, review his entire life during the course of one day and one game is a nice use of flashback to tell the story. The producers/director went all out to make the story realistic using actual MLB announcers, umpires, and players. The ""television"" coverage of the game is even grainer than the movie which lends authenticity to the story.

Is this great drama or literature? No. But it is a nice story for a nice relaxing evening.",1477180800,2,709,4.626984126984127

61766,5,0783240473,this is probably the fifth time I've watched this movie.  Great photography.  the romance is a little soupy.  But the baseball scenes are great and a good back story on what goes on in the life of a Major League player.,1475971200,,219,4.2926829268292686
61767,5,0783240473,"Ok, I will admit up front that I love baseball and that I am very much a fan of Kevin Costner.  Having said that, there have been some really good sports movies and many will say this is not one of them but I will politely and firmly disagree.  When you come to the end of a career which I did a few years ago after 40 years being fairly good at what I did for a living, those last years bring on a lot of soul searching.

For me, as he worked through his life as he worked through the innings of the game, it was very nearly a perfect thing of beauty to see.  I love the pace of baseball, the numbers, the rivalries that go back many decades and the elegance of a game that is both simple and very complex at the same time; just like life.

He ended his career on a perfect note but even better he finally got it as his team helped him to finish what he could not do alone; he needed them and in the process he figured out what else he needed to really live his life.

It does not matter how many times I watch this movie as it always gets to me and likely always will; perhaps I am just an old romantic at heart but I really don't care as I feel better after watching this movie and I like that fact.

I know this is not much of a technical review but then again I am not a theater or movie critic.  I am simply someone who loves baseball and who likes movies that make me feel better.  If you are even roughly the same then there is a fair chance you will enjoy this movie.",1475798400,9,1476,3.877076411960133

61855,5,0783240473,"We love baseball movies in this house and this one doesn't disappoint.  Any Costner baseball movie is a winner to us.  The love story is told in flashbacks as he plays what might be his last game.  You get to see how they went from boy meets girl, to girl meets team, to boy meets family, to boy suffers a predicament and acts like a jerk to love being the deciding factor.  The relationships of Billy Chapel with his teammates is really touching as well.  You want your kids to have teammates who support each other like they do.  Superstition in baseball is so deeply rooted and fun to see.  This is a great movie that maybe isn't a family movie due to some language and innuendos but overall a great romantic/sports movie that most couples can get behind",1463529600,,757,4.402877697841727

The bulk of the film is centered upon a love affair that is almost as bad as a love affair can get; it is tedious and boring.  The 'baseball' ending is so flat that it adds to the total failure of this film.  Perhaps Costner should only approach baseball as a plot when he has something to work with.

62085,4,0783240473,"For Love of the Game is a sports drama movie that was based on the novel of the same title by Michael Shaara. The story follows the a perfect game performance of an aging star baseball pitcher as he reminisces about his career and his relationship with his on-and-off girlfriend, while pitching his final game.

The story centers on Billy Chapel,who is the star pitcher with the Detroit Tigers, standing on the mound at Yankee Stadium in his last game and throwing what is shaping up to be a perfect game with the help of his best friend and catcher, Gus Osinski. However, Billy is having a hard time keeping his mind on the game; he's come to a crossroads in both his personal and professional lives, and he isn't sure what to do or where to go. He's learned that the Tigers are about to be sold, and the new owners intend to trade him at the end of the season, and that his girlfriend Jane is planning to leave him. But guess what,something else happens.

After finishing the perfect game, Billy sits alone in his hotel room as the realization sinks in that everything he has been and done for the past 19 years is over. Despite his amazing accomplishment, he weeps not only for the loss of baseball, but for the other love of his life, Jane. The next morning, Billy goes to the airport to inquire about a flight for London. Jane has missed her flight so she could watch the end of his perfect game. Finding her there waiting for her plane, they embrace and reconcile.

The movie is clichd,contrived and predictable just like most sports movies and apparently most romantic comedies. As one well-known critic was quoted in his review of the film,""Thinking back through the movie, I cannot recall a single thing either character said that was worth hearing in its own right, apart from the requirements of the plot."" I totally agree with the said movie reviewer.

But what made the movie work is Costner and Preston's convincing professionalism and chemistry together that kept the audience involved and engaged all through out the movie.

In the end,it is still worth the view ""for love of the game"".",1432598400,,2102,4.594666666666667

62116,5,0783240473,"This is a wonderful and greatly under-appreciated movie.  Perhaps this is because they cut out the crucial scene when his long-time girl friend confronts him with the fact that he has been so safely ensconced in Baseball due to his own great talents that he has never been willing to take the ""Risks of a personal Relationship"".  This scene should have never been deleted from the movie as it explains his internal psychodynamics so clearly.  However, this scene may have been cut out precisely because it gets to the heart of the matter.  People genereally wish to really know what truly motivates the ""Hero"" in these movies, and not be left in the dark.

Kevin Costner has always been a wonderful athlete and was doing his own pitching in the movie.  His baseballs were going 85 miles per hour rather than the 95-110 miles per hour of a professional pitcher but they were curve-balls fastballs and sliders that were right over home plate. His athleticism can be seen in ""Dances With Wolves"" when, in a very memorable scene he rides his horse Cisco with his arms outstretched laterally past a line of Confederate soldiers ""Shooting at him"" (Not really, after all these are the movies).  He also does his own batting and catching in the baseball catching in ""Field Of Dreams"" and his own golfing in several over movies.

 Mr. Costner's great athleticism ans well as as his wonderful acting and the superb performances of the supporting cast in ""For Love Of The Game"" make it a solidly ""Five Star Movie"".",1429401600,6,1503,4.727969348659004

62283,5,0783240473,"A great Kevin Costner movie.  With Costner as an all star Detroit Tiger pitcher, the movie got completely inside his head; his past life, what he was thinking, what was in his heart, and his present day struggles.  The first time I saw this movie, i did not appreciate it because i thought it was too disjointed; it did not run in a straight line, but kept flashing back to his past, then back to present day.  But the second time I watched this, everything clicked, and all the flashbacks helped build the movie up to a great climax.  That being said, they did an awesome job!  If you are a Costner fan, this is a must see, whether you like baseball or not.  It is a great drama, and a great love story.  Again, you got to see what was in Kevin Costner's heart.  If you are a baseball fan, better yet, because this movie digs deep into baseball, through the eyes of Costner as a lead pitcher.  If you are a sentimental person, you may even shed some tears at the end of the movie.  The movie reminded me so much of ""The Guardian"", another movie where you were able to get inside Costner's head, and feel as he felt.  This movie is  Highly recomended.",1417910400,3,1151,4.253456221198157

Between innings he relives his life decisions regarding his relationship with the woman he loves.  The romantic angle makes this a great movie to watch with your wife or girlfriend.

62528,5,0783240473,"""For Love of the Game"" is not Bull Durham (still the best baseball movie of all time), but it's close. This is thanks to Kevin Costner's ability to live the role he plays in his ""baseball days"" (and the fact that he doesn't have to do his own stunts from the mound or behind the plate in either movie).

The story is straightforward: It's the season's end, and also nearing the end of the career of the protagonist, a pitcher who has been ""one of the best"" but is now on is last legs in the majors. Loyal to his team (and teammates, as his relationship with his catcher shows). He's one of the ""boys of summer"". He's equally not the kind of guy you'd want to be dating your daughter. But inserting the ""girls"" (the wives and girlfriends section is one of the neatest little bits of the movie) makes the movie complete, because it's so schmaltzy but gives the movie a chance to move away from the action on the field to the action in ""TVland"" where so much of baseball is consumed in the real world today.

And our hero is pitching for Detroit against the Yankees. As usual (back then), the Tigers are out of the running for the ""post season"" but still fierce and snarling against the Yankees as only a Midwesterner can appreciate. And only someone with a rich appreciation of the days back to when Frank Lary and Jim Bunning would dominate the Yankees could fully get this part. The Tigers may not have won many pennants back then, but...

From that set up on, the story gets a lot right, bad knees and all. Costner and those he works with know the importance of the relationship between the pitcher and ""his"" catcher as well as anyone who loves ""the national pass time."" And the movie also gets as well as any the fierce rivalry between a pro on the mound and the pro in the batter's box. Anyone who has taught Little League and high school players to ""pitch inside"" knows about this. And about ""That's why it's called hard ball!""

And so, as the game progresses, the audience, both in the movie and watching here at home, realizes that our protagonist has the chance to pitch the PERFECT GAME.

Out by out and inning by inning, the tension builds as only the tension can build during a no-hitter or perfect game, one of the great moments in any sport at any time in history.

Of course, because of the insertion of the romantic piece, the end of the game is not completely the end of the movie. But for those of us sentimental about baseball -- and about good baseball movies -- even this works. (For me, better than the panties scene in Bull Durham, actually). Major League players may be men ""playing a boy's game,"" but they are also men -- and not cartoon characters as some baseball movies may make them out to be.

So... I'll be watching this movie now and then with my young sons, who are now playing Little League, just as I watched one White Sox perfect game myself and discussed it with my elder son (not an adult, but who had the ""love of the game"" through high school with a city champion team in Chicago)...

And another perfect game that proved to Chicago that the ""Perfect Game"" also has to be appreciated in context.

But that's another story for two movies that haven't yet been made.",1403049600,2,3202,4.386172006745363

In the case of this ball player, you see the sacrifices in love and comfort through flashbacks.  The flashbacks are dispersed through what turns out to be his last, and possibly best major league game.  He is a pitcher at the end of his career, battling pain and fatigue to make that one last out and get that one last victory.  Though he ends up accomplishing that task, he realizes everything he lost along the way and deperately tries to get it back.

62564,3,0783240473,"FOR LOVE OF THE GAME is based on the Michael Shaara book. He also wrote&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-KILLER-ANGELS/dp/034540727X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE KILLER ANGELS</a>, the historical novel that&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/GETTYSBURG/dp/B00003CXA6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">GETTYSBURG</a>&nbsp;(1993) is adapted from.

FOR LOVE OF THE GAME is the third and final inning of Kevin Costner's baseball trilogy. The previous films are&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/BULL-DURHAM/dp/B0010YSD8Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">BULL DURHAM</a>&nbsp;(1988) and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/FIELD-OF-DREAMS/dp/078322611X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">FIELD OF DREAMS</a>&nbsp;(1989). Adding to the realism here are the ""House that Ruth Built,"" long-time Stadium announcer Bob Sheppard, plus actual MLB umpires and Yankees minor leaguers as Costner's opponents.

""For Love"" is a date movie that has romance for the ladies and a Tigers/Yankees ballgame for the guys. Here, 40-year-old pitcher Costner has lost the woman he loves because of his own inconsiderate behavior. While obsessing over this recent breakup and Preston's plans to move to London, he's called upon to pitch a season finale that may be the final game of his career.

As the innings unfold we flash back over Costner's and Preston's turbulent 5-year relationship, while on the mound in the present he's doing the near-impossible: pitching a perfect game.

Although on-field segments are well-done and tension-filled, the story is compromised by being too bifurcated. Watching this is much like channel surfing two TV stations every few minutes. It's good, but surely the weakest of the Costner diamond trio. Mildly recommended.

Legendary Detroit Tiger pitcher Billy Chapel played by Kevin Costner, who does an excellent job, always was a better baseball player than he was in his love relationship with Jane, played by Kelly Preston. Now, in this movie, pitching his last game of the season, Billy has a lot of things on his mind: A broken love relationship; possibly pitching for the last time in his entire life; and life in general. He has many things to think about with some regrets.

This day he is pitching what could be his final gsme as a Tiger and he has also learned that his girlfriend of five years is leaing for London.  So,  as he pitches to Yanke batters, he goes back over his life and the past five years.

Chappie's mind is not on the game as he throws his hardest remembering the events that have led up to this day.  This is a beautiful way to show his realization that he needs Jane (Kelly Preston),

Filmed in Yankee Stadium using professional ball players and umpires with Vin Scully announcing, lends reality as Kevin Kostner pitched every pitch.

Throw in a dysfunctional runaway daughter for a bonus (the girlfriend of Costner is a divorcee whose ex-husband apparently leads a very loose lifestyle.) Oh and did I mention that the girlfriend got knocked up at 16 to have that dysfunctional daughter?

I wanted a PG-13 baseball movie that was mostly about baseball, not mostly about dysfunctional sexual relationships. But even if my daughter was not watching - it was still a dull, trite movie with one-dimensional characters, in a totally predictable story line.",1391558400,4,959,4.575581395348837

This underrated film combines the best aspects of a sports film - the story of a long time pitcher, Billy Chapel, bringing his career to a close - and the backstory and personal stories that intertwine to lead all the various parties to the climax of the film.  The love story is somewhat contrived and predictable, yet well written.  The baseball elements are solid.  The announcing during the game is so stereotyped as to be near annoying.  So, why 5 stars?

62758,2,0783240473,"I'm sorry, but in the era of whiney women movies, this one takes the cake.. What's this lady's deal, anyways?.. What's the problem?.. Supposedly, this good looking guy, who's a gazillionaire and a world famous professional athlete really digs her.. Yes, she slept with him on the first date, but she's not a slut... But she really is a little slutty, but whatever, but somehow that's his fault, too.. She likes him, but her ethics won't allow her to pursue a relationship after she slept with him on the 1st date (which was a pure cold call, BTW, slutty), so she brushes him off.. But, then she pops up uninvited to spring training, and faalips out that he's got company?.. WTF?..

Then, lol, she blindsides him with her kid, which I guess was top secret till then(?), and he shows himself to be a good guy and takes care of everything.. And all of the sudden, it's Ozzie and Harriet?.. Meanwhile, the baseball angle, which is much more interesting loses traction while we have to trudge trough the mess of why Kelly Preston is even there?.. lol.. Well, that's an exaggeration, but you get my point..

Finally, fate intervenes, and they come face to face at the airport, and even though this poor guy, who even though he acted like an ass the one particular scene, has been a pretty good guy throughout the movie, pours his heart out to this woman, she still makes the ugly face and starts to cry and is gonna kick him to the curb, at which point, he pours his heart out again.. Then, he turns to leave and she finally let's him out of the grease..

Which is what it was!!!.. She was dropping him in the grease, and watching him fry.. Ridiculous.. Who wrote this farce?.. At the end, I wanted to strangle that woman..",1374019200,2,1717,4.479233226837061

62794,4,0783240473,"This movie is for fans of baseball (and if you are not fond of Yankee fans, even better).  Vin Scully's announcing steals the show, and whether his culminating line at the end of the game is scripted or a ""Scullyism,"" it's perfect.  This is probably my favorite baseball movie.

We get a peek into the life of a major league pitcher - from life on the road to his verbalized thoughts on the mound.  In a different twist, the final game that is the focal point, isn't a championship game.  It is just a ""throwaway"" in terms of its impact on the end-of-the-year standings.  That makes it even more realistic.  Not all of the great moments in sports occur in the 7th game of the World Series, with a play at the plate in the bottom of the 9th.

The love story is believable as the tumultuous relationship is directly hinged to Billy Chapel's (Costner) pitching career.  For me, a highlight of the dialogue occurred in the 1st 1/2-hour of the film.  Instead of being enthralled and dominated by Billy's fame and occupation, Jane (Kelly Preston) confronts it head-on.  Not too long ago, female characters were cast with secondary careers that were eclipsed by men - and that was okay.  Jane sees his career as a disadvantage from the start, and she is not about to play bat boy to Billy's pitching career - and she is okay with not getting involved.  She does not ask him to choose.  I believe it is this independence that Billy is attracted to - that Jane likes/loves him in spite of his being a baseball player, not because of it.  (Although, she confesses that she is ""always watching"" when he is pitching.)

If you go to imdb.com, you will discover a lot of factual errors (e.g. the angle of the sun in Yankee Stadium) and continuity errors (e.g. images on the DiamondVision).  Still, the suspense of the unfolding game and the questions about the romantic relationship seem to transcend those errors.  In addition, the relationship between Billy and his catcher, Gus (John C. Reilly), is a wonderful subtext to the storyline.

I recommend this film.  Enjoy!",1370995200,,2057,4.6143250688705235

62839,5,0783240473,"Loved it...and I can't always say that about a Kevin Costner film.  The poor guy gave us such a string of mediocre movies at one point that it was starting to become depressing. But then Field of Dreams (which holds a permanent place in my movie collection) kept staring at me from its spot on the shelf, reminding me not to give up hope on Kevin.  And I'm glad!

For Love of the Game is, of course, a baseball movie...and I have to admit that I am somewhat of a baseball-movie fan so I first watched it with the anticipation that I'd like it for that aspect if nothing else.  Fortunately, I liked the rest of it too.

Nearing the end of his 19th year with the Detroit Tigers, Billy Chapel (Kevin Costner) is faced with his past, present, and future, and is forced to think through them all during the final game of the season against the  NY Yankees.  The movie flips between the past and present throughout the game giving us a good background story on Billy and the love-of-his-life, Jane, played Kelly Preston.  The movie does a good job of character development...which is important since a story is only as good as its characters.  If you don't care about them, then why bother?  This is particularly true with a love story.

Kevin Costner did a job like I haven't seen since his Field of Dreams days...or perhaps he always acts this well and this was a better storyline than Waterworld or The Postman so I could really tell.  Kelly Preston (Addicted to Love, Jerry Maguire) was also excellent.  Preston is one of those actresses that every time I see her in something, I can barely tell that it's the same girl.  I think she has a real talent for totally becoming her role, which draws you in, and you either love her or hate her, depending upon who she is.  Love her in this part.

Just so you know, the film wasn't perfect.  Most of its minor flaws are overlook-able, but I did find the first 15 minutes or so didn't seem to fit as well into the rest of the movie.  It all seems fine until they give you all that background detail and you gain a better understanding of who Billy and Jane are and what their relationship has been.  In fact, if they cut those first few minutes, I'd probably be able to figure out what was going on without them.  It wasn't a particularly strong opener for what turned out to be a strong film.

Definitely a good date movie.",1359590400,,2365,4.366132723112128

I can't think of any movie that has more authentic-looking and sounding baseball. My favorite scenes are the ones that include the incomparable Vin Scully, but the scene with Billy Chapel sobbing in his room is powerful. The romantic scenes are not nearly as good, but the movie still effectively explores some issues like the emptiness of self-indulgence and the struggle that an aging athlete has in knowing when to walk away. Finally, I love Vince Gill's song at the end. ""For Love Of The Game"" is rated PG-13 for a few sexually suggestive scenes and some strong language.",1358899200,,678,5.117117117117117

62923,3,0783240473,"There are three things that make this movie worth watching for its 137 minutes: the perfect, the near-perfect, and one change that would have, maybe, transformed the plot.

First, the perfect. This is a baseball movie but a radio man steals every scene he's in. The genius who persuaded Vin Scully to play himself in this project deserves some kind of Academy Award for casting. ""Vinny,"" so beloved that we don't use a last name, is our Homer; he doesn't describe games as much as he sings them, like an opera virtuoso at top form. Listen to that remarkable voice, with its trademark cadences and literate descriptions, and you'll ask, along with generations of fans, ""This is a baseball game? It sounds more like Classical Music. Or maybe Frank Sinatra."" A savvy film editor could cut this movie down to just the game sequences, and the baseball fans would go home happy.

Which brings up the near-perfect. Baseball movies look hopelessly fake when they take to the field. Okay, the actors put on uniforms and throw the ball around but the audience, anyone who's actually seen a major league game, knows immediately that these guys are stiffs. Real ballplayers move much faster, throw much harder, and use economy of motion much better than even a gifted amateur can do. Kevin Costner (playing aging ace pitcher Billy Chapel) is reportedly pretty good on the diamond. He certainly looks good in a uniform, and he throws the ball with enough authority as to not get laughed off the field. Where the movie makes this work is the use of television.

By using a televised broadcast--on Fox, in a bit of droll product placement--and cutting from on-field action to its televised images to crowd shots at Yankee Stadium, the viewer almost doesn't notice that the players aren't the pros. And as we noted above, it makes all the difference that Vinny is doing the play-by-play. Nice work by the team of editors who worked on this thing. Also, it doesn't hurt that a crew of real big-league umpires are working the game. They add realism and probably worked cheaper than a crew of big-league ringers would have.

Finally, one thing that would have transformed the story. Costner's character is wrapping up his long career with one final game, a statement on all he's done over 19 years in the Majors. Since Billy Chapel is a pitcher, we can't get the final-at-bat homer to give us the thrill, as Redford did in The Natural. No, only a perfect game can do the job. And Billy gets it done: 27 up, 26 down. Costner, by the way, does mutter pitching tactics to himself as each hitter steps in: this guy crowds the plate, better brush him back; this guy looks confused, throw him something he doesn't expect. People who find baseball boring get a nice tutorial here on the inside game.

Wait though, we've only got 26 outs. One to go, right? Yes, a young phenom is sent to pinch hit. We've got the guy on the mound facing his last hitter while a young slugger steps in for the first at bat in his career. Classic: Age gives way to Youth; the Past becomes the Future. That would take us by surprise, right? Yes, but not this time. The batter socks one off Costner's mitt but the shortstop scoops it up and gets the batter at first by an eyelash. Age wins, and then makes it to the airport in time to reunite with his estranged girlfriend. Yes, there's a romance to keep the non-fans in the audience watching while the rest of us wait for Vinny and the game to come back on.  Just a thought: wouldn't it have been really perfect if the kid got a hit? Maybe the old guy grooves his best fastball, strength against strength, winner take all? Oh well.

In any case, at the end we're grateful. We've got Kevin Costner in another cool masculine role; he's handsome, cheerful, and wears his success lightly. We've got Kelly Preston as the girlfriend; if Helen of Troy's face launched 1000 ships, Ms. Preston's would get at least 990 under sail. And, we've got Vinny. Perfect.",1339372800,,3955,4.601418439716312

There is no chemistry between Costner and milk toast Travolta, whatever her name is. Their romance is dull. I didn't much care about what happened to anybody in this movie. The only compelling character was Costner's and everytime he got back around Ms. Boring, I didn't care what happened to him either. This movie is two hours that feel like ten.

62928,4,0783240473,"For The Love of the Game is a baseball film that highlights personal motives to play baseball, which exceed the commodity attitude that can be bestowed upon club and player resources. The story is also personal in terms of appreciating the life a player has off the field, and how this can have a profound impact on their baseball career. Some clichs are presented in this film, which nevertheless add further volume to what is a deeper baseball picture.

62929,3,0783240473,"You know, one of these days I'll see a Kevin Costner movie I actually like.  So far, he's been really underwhelming to me.

Anyway, the reason I watched For Love of the Game this afternoon is because I'm a fan of the Detroit Tigers (or as I prefer to call them, the Motor City Kitties!)

There's no clear reason why I'm a fan- ever since I fell in love with baseball back in '93 when my Philadelphia Phillies went to the World Series, it's been a sport that always fascinated me because the possibilities seem endless.  For some reason the Tigers stood out to me.  It's like they were never acknowledged, never given proper respect, and never given attention whatsoever by the baseball announcers.  This is why the '06 season when they went to the World Series meant a LOT to me.  Best year ever (well, besides the '08 World Series of course, hehe).

I can sit here and ramble useless baseball nonsense until I bore everyone to tears, so let's get to the review, shall we?

This movie sort of stinks.  According to the information, it's supposed to be a drama but in all honesty it's partially a drama, but mostly a romantic snore fest.  It drags on and ON.  It's about Kevin Costner being a Detroit Tigers pitcher and winding down in his career mostly due to an injury forcing him into constant media pressure debating an early retirement.  After witnessing a few innings of Kevin Costner pitching against the Yankees (and WOW do the Tigers ever play the Yankees quite a bit throughout the season!) the film then goes back in time to 5 years before and builds the story from *this* time period when he would meet what would become his future girlfriend/wife.  She's parked alongside the road on a busy highway with car troubles, and of course Costner plays the ladies man by pulling over and helping her out.  I hated this scene but it shows exactly what to expect for the next 1 hour and 45 minutes.

From here, the film occasionally shows Kevin Costner pitching more games, but it mostly (to my utter disappointment) switches to a NEW direction and focuses around Costner and his relationship troubles.  First of all, For Love of the Game most certainly does NOT need to be 2 hours long, especially when a good portion of it centers around Kevin Costner and his tricky girlfriend either carrying pointless conversations that never build into anything worthwhile nor accomplish anything, the two of them making out, or concerning Kevin Costner getting to know the womans daughter (that she conveniently failed to mention until halfway through).

For this reason, I highly recommend all sports fans AVOID this movie like the plague.  Seriously, you do not want to watch a movie that focuses around nonstop romance and has little to do with actual baseball.  This is the kind of movie that girls drag their boyfriends to see.  Trust me on this one.

Overall, for a romantic flick, it's alright.  More baseball would have been preferable though.  Also, one complaint.  When we actually get to see some baseball-related segments, I thought Kevin Costner frequently talking to himself while on the pitchers mound was really far fetched and annoying.

For romance lovers only.",1314835200,,3172,4.73224043715847
62956,5,0783240473,"Most movies about sports (besides ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Natural-Director-s-Cut/dp/B000MNOX94/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Natural (Director's Cut)</a>"") are usually weird, cliche and not really good story or character pieces, aside from not properly portraying the games and how the players actually think in them.

Throw that all out the window for this movie.  This movie accurately captures what it is like to be on the field.  The voice overs are very close to what my friend and myself said we  were thinking when we played in High School.  Your mind is every where.  Your ability to focus is key, which is shown very creatively cinematically in this movie.

This movie also is a great story for Kevin Costner's Character.  Lots of flash backs based that give context and depth to his current problem make for a really interesting story.  The movie is certainly a drama with lots of romance interwoven.  It is hard to describe the story without revealing much.  Much of the movie is him pitching, while flashing back to memories of his life with a girlfriend.

One thing that I loved, but also kind bother me was Vin Scully announcing.  As a Dodgers fan, there is NOTHING better than hearing Vin announce a game (Vin Scully is does the TV broadcast for the Dodgers alone and is an old-school, one man show).  He is a living legend and one of a kind.  The problem is he would never announce a Yankees Detroit Game, but is a perfect fit nonetheless for the role and type of movie this is.

Overall, a great movie, especially considering most sports movies are awkward and clich.  This one was not.  A great movie for baseball fans and movie fans.",1312416000,,1704,5.00355871886121

62958,5,0783240473,"Fictional baseball history is touchingly made by aging 'Detroit Tigers' pitcher 'Billy Chapel' (actor Kevin Costner: ""The Untouchables (1987), ""Dances with Wolves"" (1990) * Best Director * Best Picture Oscars, ""Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves"" (1991) ""Wyatt Earp""(1994)) and his catcher, 'Gus Sinsky' (actor John C.

This is not Director Sam Raimi's (""Spider-Man 3"") finest work, however it's the best baseball movie ever made (no ""baseball apparitions"" appear & no ""legends"" get personified & then glorified)... Just a simple baseball film packed-full of cheers & tears; this movie shoots from the hip (literally & figuratively) & the heart and is meant for true baseball fans to enjoy, like myself, and for families (rated PG-13) to sit-down and chew popcorn over together...
The acting's a bit sub-par, but the plot's 'spirit' takes you to where real baseball fans truly dream of; not to a haunted ""field of dreams"", but to the experience of shared sheer joy of one dream coming true... Any sports fan, actually, should be impressed by the 'sportsmanship' evoked by ""For Love of the Game""...

62960,5,0783240473,"I personally found this movie to be an excellent watch. It is about a baseball pitcher in his ending career, pitching his final game. As he plays through this game, he flashes back on memories, moments, and mostly how the love of his life has impacted him. After the feeling that he has lost everything he has ever loved because of his career ending, he realizes he loves something even more. For love of the game is a movie that can reach out and personally touch specific crowds of people. This movie gets to me because I am an athlete and know how it feels to have the game quit you.

While watching this movie the flashbacks are something I believe a majority of people can relate to. That makes this movie significant because we can all peel back our layers and compare them to Billy as he views the years. You witness struggle, love, desperation, heartbreak and a number of other emotions while viewing this movie. Hopefully the memories Billy goes through will remind you of yours, such as falling in love.

This movie can take a person back to when baseball was good, when playing the game was all that mattered. Money, the jersey you wore, none of that matters in this movie. You only played: For love of the Game.

62986,4,0783240473,"It took a while for me in watching this movie to realize the all the baseball scenes were actually from the same game, and not parts of many games. I had not read or heard of the movie before, and I wasn't actually paying close attention at the beginning.

Once I realized that the entire movie was flashbacks Kevin Costner's character was having during the course of one game that suddenly becomes a real candidate to end up as a ""perfect game"", I got more interested. Not that the baseball result drew me in, the entire idea for the movie happening in flashbacks during a game intrigued me.

The movie is indeed sappy, and contains every clich, but it works anyway. Romantic dramas are going to have a lot of clichs, there's no way to avoid it. Sports movies are going to have a lot of clichs. So when you put the two together, its a clich-fest! LOL Still, the performances are engaging and mostly come off as real. The drama at the end of the game has a body of its own. The catcher's promise near the end is something that SHOULD happen in sports, and probably doesn't very often.

Only the last couple of scenes, which happen AFTER the game, break out of the framework of the rest of the movie.

So if you don't like romances or sappy sports movies, stay away from this, you won't like it. Otherwise, its a nice film with some good lessons and a satisfying set of conclusions.",1277510400,,1381,4.3828125

Baseball scenes are somewhat realistic especially compared to many past baseball movies. Vin Scully is the game announcer and he helps make the game scenes more realistic.

That is very difficult to do when it is all you've known and loved. Facing just being a regular guy and not part of the Game and his fame is really hard to accept. Ladies: You will begin to understand him and certainly relate to her. Having someone else in your life can help ease the pain of making the decision he faces, (Kelly Preston would certainly help me, if I was him of course). When he finally realizes how special she is in his life, leaving the Game becomes a simple decision. Very good story. Very good acting.

It reminds me of ""The Natural"" starring Robert Redford which set up the movie in the first 10 minutes.  Both films are about the people we encounter in life - good people, mean people, people down on their luck, loyal people who support you to the end, friends, family, etc.  My favorite thing in the movie is the interaction between Billy (Costner) and Gus the catcher (Reilly).

Overall, a great movie about life - good times, bad times, things we cherish, things we regret. A good deed done will pay you back later (heartfelt advice to an outfielder who gets hit on the head by a fly ball who later catches a potential home run during the perfect game). A bad deed done can always be forgiven.  All that matters is that we do the right thing in the end.

Kevin Costner portrays a baseball player who in the twilight of his career.  He was once a dominating pitcher, but time has eroded some of his skills and he can sense his last stroll to the pitcher's mound is near.

Kelly Preston plays his on-again / off-again love interest after a chance meeting.  Kelly has always been beautiful, and this might be her finest performance to date.

The story is told via flashbacks while the Detroit Tiger's hurler pursues every baseball pitcher's dream:  a perfect game.  It comes on the last game of the season vs. the most storied franchise in the game (the Yankess) at perhaps the most storied stadium in all of sports (Yankee stadium).  It also is the last game of the season, and perhaps the last game of his career.

While some may find the story a bit longwinded, I thought that the film was evenly paced & told well.

63007,4,0783240473,"FOR LOVE OF THE GAME

Sam Raimi is one of my all time favorite filmmakers and I will basically buy anything that the man is involved with, luckily for me I have enjoyed all of his films. I was a bit surprised when this film first came out because it didn't really seem like his kinda thing but I knew he could pull it off. The result is a really good baseball movie that really isn't about baseball, and Mr. Raimi did a great job with it. I went to the theaters to see this at the time of it's release and walked out thinking ""that was a pretty good movie"".

Based on a novel by Michael Shaara this is the story of Billy Chapel [Costner] a baseball legend at the end of his career and the end of his love life. It is the final game of the year and all he wants is to ignore the pain in his arm and give it one last go. Add into the fact that his lover Jane Aubrey [Kelly Preston] is tired of him and is moving on. This movie is really about this man's journey to finding himself, to bad he does that while playing a career making game. Or maybe it is because of that that he is pitching a career making game. It seems that while he is on the plate thinking about his life with her he is throwing the perfect game, and doesn't even know it. Towards the end when he starts to realize it he starts to go into a slump.

Sam Raimi shows a bit of a different approach and style with his direction in this film, it is more of a conservative style. The pace is good and the film transcends between present and past easily, but the last third of the film is excellent. Screenwriter Dana Stevens did a great job adapting the book into a film although I will admit that I have not read the book. Costner is good in the role of the fading legend and seems right at home on the plate, his scenes with Preston are good as well but just don't seem big enough. Kelly Preston is great in this film and plays the emotional unstable Jane perfectly. J.K Simmons is excellent as the head coach for Costner's team but does not get enough screen time in my opinion. Still it is John C. Reilly who is my favorite in this movie, as always he is great. He plays the catcher and the guy who is helping get Billy threw, excellent performance.

The best thing about this film is by far the baseball parts, just the way it was filmed and edited was great. As for the love story it is good and well done but it just falls short of being that classic love story, not sure what a good example would be. This is far from Raimi's best movie but it is a really good one, and to be honest it may be one of the reasons he got the Spiderman job. To all those who have yet to see this I recommend it but be warned, this is not your every day average Raimi flick. Still it is a very good one, worthy of a purchase.",1239148800,,2773,4.009041591320073
63008,4,0783240473,"The acting and directing are top notch, some of the writing, misses the point, but the emotion is conveyed in incredible clarity.

63012,5,0783240473,"Costner has made about 5 or 6 good movies, and three of them are about baseball.  Bull Durham is the comedy, Field of Dreams is the spiritual, but For Love of the Game is the more realistic of the bunch.
Billy Chapel (Costner) is an aging veteran pitcher for a bad Detroit team in the twilight of his career who must decide on retirement, or accepting a trade.  The movie takes place over the course of just 1 game, with back flashes of his relationship with Jane (Kelly Preston).
The movie touches on the celebrity of athletes, and the difficulties of having a normal relationship.  I personally thought that the underlying theme was about choosing between a career or a relationship, but I'm sure it was probably deeper than that.
I have always thought that Costner was a bit of a ham who takes himself way too seriously, and while at times in this movie he tends to fall into that role,  Billy Chapel is more of an understated character, and Costner is by far at his best when he plays that kind of role.",1207526400,7,1007,4.427027027027027
63013,4,0783240473,Kevin Costner gives a very compelling performance as a baseball player at the end of his career.  He is very realistic in the role and brings thought provoking issues to light.  How do you decide to hang up your glove and leave a game that has been the most important thing in your life?  It was great that he could personally do the pitching in this movie because it would have lost a lot of the realism and credibility if they had to use someone else.,1206835200,43,453,4.244186046511628

If you like serious baseball movies (The Pride of the Yankees, The Natural, etc.), For Love of the Game will make a fine addition to your disc library.",1205193600,,439,4.602564102564102
63015,5,0783240473,"Not being a baseball fan at all, I hesitated to get this movie. I have Bull Durham, and like it the more I see it, great humor in that movie, but For Love of the Game is the best ever. It has almost made me a baseball fan. Kevin Costner does an outstanding job in this movie--he throws all the pitches and makes the catches himself--that alone is amazing to watch, to hear the wind whistle past the ball, see the rosen powder fly from the catcher's mitt--it doesn't get any better.  The camera work is outstanding, camera angles/replays/closeups, overall film techniques used to produce realism of an actual professional game, actual umpires from the league in the role of umpires, actors with experience in minor and major league play in the role of players and coaches, fan/crowd responses, etc., it's as real as it can get.

John C. Reilly is outstanding, he portrays the essence of a real friend. Kelly Preston is good, if I had a choice I would have chosen someone with more electricity and spark with Kevin but Costner makes up for the lack of spontaneous chemistry between the two. I would have bought this movie just to see the outstanding job Costner does, however, the story line is powerful; the relationship between Billy (Kevin) and Jane (Kelly)is so real depicting the ups and downs of a relationship with two flawed people and the difficutly of having a normal life and developing love interest with someone in the public eye. It just doesn't get any better, in my opinion, than For Love of the Game.

The story in For Love of the Game is the story of life--only told from the perspective of a single baseball game.  We focus on one aspect of our life--our career--and almost ride it too long and risk missing out on the most important part of our overall existence. There are flaws in this movie but only those looking for flaws can get sidetracked by that and miss one of the best movies ever.  This one is a keeper and one to be watched over and over.  I don't know which I like best, the love story or the shots of the baseball game--and this from someone who doesn't like baseball--both are intertwined so skillfully they can't be separated.  I almost want a second copy to make sure I never lose this outstanding movie.",1200355200,2,2240,4.543424317617866

63037,4,0783240473,"I usually love baseball movies, especially ones with Kevin Costner in them.  I've been pretty disappointed with Costner movies of late so I didn't rush out to catch this movie.  I would hardly consider this movie one of his best, but it didn't turn out to be so bad.

In the end, I actually liked this movie.  This is the story of Billy Chapel who is pitching what could be his last game after a stunning 19 year career as a Detroit Tiger pitcher.  As he gives it his all, he has flashbacks of the events that have happened in the previous five years of his life and realizing that he hasn't given every aspect of his life the same effort he has given this game.

In the end, the viewer will identify and care for Billy Chapel and the people in his life including his on-again, off-again girlfriend named Jane (played by Kelly Preston), Jane's daughter Heather, his loyal friend and catcher Gus (played wonderfully by John C. Riley), and many others.  This is a heart-felt drama and not so much the sport movie I thought it would be.

The acting and story are quite superb.  There is even some sprinkling of humor that had me laughing out loud (""Have you ever had your heart broken?""  ""Yes, we lost a pennant race."")  My only complaint is that, at over 2 hours, this movie just gets to be too long.  Forty minutes before the end of the movie I just wanted it to come to its conclusion.  Sam Raimi did a fantastic directing job but could have easily cut a lot of those scenes.

This is a good movie for a great range of people.  It has a tear-jerking love story, sports, humor, excellent acting, drama, and a lot of heart.  If any of those things appeal to you then check out this film.  The only thing missing is a little action, but that would have just ruined this movie.",1193097600,,1773,4.324242424242424
63038,5,0783240473,"Those were the words of ""Gus"", John C. Riley(the more i see of this guy the more i like him)is the big hearted,battle worn,FAITHFUL,TRUSTY O'l catcher in this baseball guy movie turned LOVE STORY. This is the story of Billy Chapel. A once great pitcher for the Detroit Tigers on the brink of retirement. It's a story of a man who's got the biggest decision of his life/career to make...being traded by the new owners of the ball club and keep playing but for another team other than the only team he has ever known Professionally...or retirement?...If you're a use to be athlete...this tugs at your heart, taking you back to the last time you were able to suit up and play the greatest game in the world...baseball! Billy is a man who's obviously in love with the game and is having a heck of a time letting her go. Now by using the word ""her'...i can describe both the game of baseball and Billy's ""on again,off again"" relationship with Jane Aubrey(the very Beautiful Kelly Preston), a New York Fashion magazine Editor who's more than a lil' hesitant with Costner's character's old school approach with their realtionship. Billy thinks (like i and countless other guys have) like a typical guy who takes advantage of a good thing to the point that he drives it away. Billy is old school and he isn't willing to commit to Jane, which she deperately needs him to do. Jane has been done wrong in the past more than a few times. She's a single mom of a teenage girl( played by the very CUTE Jena Malone)who's starting to challenge her mom's ways. In all ways this movie is just about life! Single parenting, being a stubborn man, relationships with friends, saying goodbye, the love of a good woman... and o'h yeah...the deepest love a man can have for the game of Baseball. The movie is set during the last game of what has been a very rough season for Billy and the Tigers. Inning by inning Billy goes through refections of his relationship with Jane and Heather(Jena's character), his career as a dominant pitching god for one team,the Detroit Tigers & everything from a career threatning injury and just plain old woman trouble. He's had a good life as a ball player but his career is coming to a close and now he has the decision of retirement or playing for another team. All the while his heart is with Jane but he is too stubborn to tell her how he really feels and just about pushes her completely away. Like a typical guy, Billy realizes and goes after her at all costs...Did i forget to mention the fact that this is all going on during a game that Billy just so happens to be pitching a perfect game in?...news of the sale of the Tigers forces Billy's hand to make a decision of retirement or trade...this triggers Billy's reflections. He realizes that's he's in love with Jane and he needs more than just ""the game"" to be complete in life. In typical Movie fashion Billy pitches the perfect game, retires, and goes after Jane. In the ending scene,Billy pours his heart to Jane at the airport in New York...he palns to chase her overseas but by chance she delays her flight to watch the game and is wrestling with her own feelings for Billy and trusting him. All in all, this is a great movie especially for the Costner buffs out there. I personally love all of Costner's baseball movies and i'd put this one at the top of my personal list! This is not a movie to rent, it's a definate buy!!! Billy Chapel is the man everybody wants to be and the man that no man wants to admit that he is...?!",1178582400,2,3502,4.464898595943838

For DVD watchers, you will be so sad that more of Billy Chapel's private life was not shown in the film as released. The deleted scenes -- his empty encounters with women, his closeness to his teammates -- make his retirement prospects all the more desperate. Something went wrong with the writing for Kelly Preston's ""Jane""; her character doesn't add up. She makes a ridiculous scene in front of a very famous hotel with fans of Chapel's all around; there is no basis for either the scene or her language and attitude in the script, it's gratuitous conflict. But the final moments of that Perfect Game make me cry every time I watch them.",1151452800,,871,4.662337662337662
63072,3,0783240473,"The baseball scenes in this movie are wonderful, the romance a little less so. The result is a solid time at bat, but not extra bases.

Costner makes you feel all the bursting athleticism, confidence, energy, and thoughts, of a great but aging pitcher in the early innings, and all his aches and pains, doubt and fatigue, as the game wears on. The actual baseball scenes are very realistic, with Costner doing his own pitching.

This film captures some of the precious little moments of baseball, such as the sizzle of a pitched ball, and the relationship between two friends, the pitcher and the catcher. Another strong point is that it captures the glowing voice of broadcaster Vin Scully, who I've listened to since I grew up a Dodger fan in New Jersey and the Dodgers were in Brooklyn. (Like another reviewer I wonder if Scully wrote his own dialogue. It sounded exactly like the way he broadcasts a real game.) The scenes of Yankee fans yelling at the TV as the broken-down pitcher neared the perfect game took me back 40 years. I yelled exactly the same things at our TV set when I watched Don Larsen pitch the last few innings of his perfect game against my Dodgers in 1956.

On the downside, someone made the decision to go over the top in the last scenes of both the baseball game and the romance. The music score, which has been wonderful and hitting all the right emotional notes until then, turns gushing and maudlin.

The film would have been more emotionally resonant and ultimately more satisfying with a quieter ending to both the baseball and the romantic storylines. For example, the deleted scenes, such as the after-the-game congratulations from the opposing players in the clubhouse, have an emotional depth to them that emphasize how much of his emotional life the pitcher is losing, and how empty even a big moment can be if there's no one to share it with.

Kudos to Costner for a terrific performance as the pitcher, John C. Reilly for his strong support as the catcher, Kelly Preston for a fine turn as Costner's on-and-off again love interest, and Jena Malone, who really shines as Preston's daughter.

To the reviewers who think the movie is too slow, you've been watching too many movies and too much TV that ignores character and story-telling and replaces it with a dozen explosions, fights, car chases, crashes, and special effects every minute, all shot by a relentlessly moving camera, and edited at an absurdly over-caffeinated staccato pace.

Slow down! If you take time to notice, there's a lot more going on in this kind of movie than in today's typical action flick.",1150156800,2,2605,4.724669603524229

The film is definitely thoughtful and entertaining.  I liked the baseball dialogue, and the symbolism in the film.  The flashbacks, which I first thought was going to be annoying worked well.  The anti-Yankee rhetoric is ok by me as well.  A perfect game against thrown against the yankees by a washed up pitcher is definitely entertaining and something to get behind.

The chemistry between Costner and Kelly Preston is a tad weak in my opinion.  It's hard to find that appeal these days that rivals the golden era of cinema.  The worse part of the film is when he is stading outside of her home in the rain (like a stalker) when she is inside entertaining a metrosexual artsy fellow.  What a loser!

My son instantly identified with Chapel's talking to himself between pitches, trying to get inside the head of the batter (What's he expecting?  Fastball or breaking ball?), hoping that his next pitch will throw the batter off balance.  And finally, Chapel's ability to completely shut out all noise and distractions (""Clear the mechanism,"" he says to himself.) was very effective.
And those are the highlights of the movie.  Unfortunately, FOR LOVE OF THE GAME is a compilation of flashbacks centering around a contrived love story that has been rehashed and recycled thousands of times.  Director Sam Raimi gives us a story about the on-again/off-again relationship between Chapel and Jane Aubrey (Kelly Preston), a magazine exec.  Chapel is unwilling to make a commitment, while Jane's pessimistic insecurity about the relationship becomes downright annoying.  Costner is so wooden in these scenes he appears to be going through the motions, while Preston whines and pines like a high school sophomore.  The final scene between the two of them, in the airport, is uncomfortable to watch.
John C. Reilly turns in an admirable performance as grisly veteran catcher Gus Sinski, and the soothing voice of Hall of Fame broadcaster Vin Scully lends wonderful credibility to the drama as Chapel makes a bid to pitch a perfect game. I only wish FOR LOVE OF THE GAME had confined itself to the action on the mound; there wasn't much action going on anywhere else.

63094,5,0783240473,"Following the shining examples of earlier characters in ""Bull Durham"" and ""Field of Dreams"", Kevin Costner has once again taken on the role of a baseball player and played it to perfection.  In this film, Costner stars as Detroit Tigers ace pitcher Billy Chapel, a 19-year veteran of the major leagues.  Chapel's hall of fame career is winding down, and his team is playing out the string of another long season.  To make matters worse, Jane, Billy's girlfriend, played superbly by Kelly Preston, has informed him that she has accepted a job offer in London.  The final bit of bad news comes from the Tigers' owner, who informs Billy that he's sold the team and Billy will probably be traded next season.  All of these things are weighing on Billy's mind as he steps on the mound at Yankee Stadium.
However, right from the beginning of the game, Billy realizes that this day is going to be special.  He has his best stuff working, and he's blowing through the Yankees like they were little leaguers. Gus, the catcher played wonderfully by J.C. Reilly, offers continuous encouragement to Billy throughout the game. One of the best moments of the film is the way Billy blocks out the noise of the crowd in his mind, and all that the viewer hears is the wooosh of the ball as it is pitched.  I got chills when this occurred.  It was extermely realistic.
During the course of the game, Billy has ""flashbacks"" to his relationship with Jane.  We get to see how they met and the evolution of their romance.  Although he hides it well, it is clear that Billy truly loves Jane, but he's afraid to admit to her that he really needs her in his life.  I thought the flashbacks were excellent.  In some films, the flashbacks tend to take away from the movie, but not in this one.  I think they were one of the better aspects of the movie.
By the time the game reaches the 7th inning, Billy asks Gus if any Yankee has reached base.  Gus says no.  Only then does Billy realize that he's in the midst of a pitcher's dream; the perfect game.  Summoning incredible courage and strength, Billy manages to complete the ultimate baseball feat.
Watching this movie was a real treat for me.  I enjoyed Costner's earlier performance in ""Field of Dreams"", but he tops it with this amazing performance.  I recommend this excellent movie to all baseball fans, and fans of good movies in general.  Its one you'll remember for a long time.",1039046400,25,2410,4.562790697674418

63114,4,0783240473,"This movie takes place almost entirely in one day, but the flashbacks in the mind of Billy Chapel (Kevin Costnar) while he is on the mound and in the dugout give it a sense of time by  spanning his life.  Billy is at a crossroads both personally and professionally.  And by the next morning he has both figured out.
While not a pure baseball movie it does offer a glimpse of what could be going on inside the head of a pitcher who is ""in the zone"" during the best game of his storied career.  He is throwing a perfect game but does not even realize it until around the sixth inning when he has to ask his catcher.  He does not realize it because his mind is elsewhere, on Jane (Kelly Preston) his on and off girlfriend of the last five years who has just told him she is going to live on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean.  She dropped this bomb only ten minutes after his boss, the owner of the Tigers, told him that the club is being sold and he will be traded to another team the next year.  What a morning it started off as.  Throughout the game while he is throwing bullets he is trying to figure out what to do about Jane and about his career.
Kelly Preston does a fine job as Jane and Jena Malone plays Jane's daughter, Heather with another good performance (although a much smaller part than some she has had).
Overall a good movie for guys and gals to watch together.  The girls will like the love story, the guys will like the baseball and the memories of how it connected them (as it does Billy) to their fathers and the sandlot games of their youth.  I liked the way the movie game full cirle to the first scene near the end to give you background on what was going on in that scene.  A movie worth watching.",1019952000,4,1723,4.159638554216867

The film is told in an interesting manner jumping from the present to the past and points in between and then back to the present.  And this happens over and over again.

Congradulations to Costner who manages to maneuver his way through the entire film without cracking a smile.  Whoops maybe when I took a bathroom break once.
Preston does deserve an award herself-a best agonizer of the year trophy.  Lots of facial distress and we don't even know her real problem until half way through the film.  Lighten up Kelly.  Lighten up Kevin. Is this acting?
The baseball scenes appeal to baseball fans.  I looked at my husband, the great Seattle Mariner fan.  He was captivated by the pitches during the big game(Detroit vs NY) and in the end he shed a tear or two.  Really.  Obviously  it works better if you love baseball.

You really don't need to be a baseball fan or even know much about the game, to enjoy this film a lot.

Ever watch a game on TV and wonder what the pitchers are thinking about when the camera shows a close-up to the pitcher's face?  This is the movie for you.  The baseball scenes alone in this movie make it worthwhile for a baseball fan to watch.  If you are not particularly interested in baseball, this might not be the movie you want to see the most.

As any baseball fan knows, the ""perfect game"" has got to be one of the most exciting feats in sports. And I think this film captures it perfectly. If I found Costner's acting in other films not as good as I would lilke, there is absolutely NOTHING WRONG with his performance here....
The eighth and ninth innings were made very dramatic and I felt like I was right there, watching an actual game! The romance was weaker than the baseball, but it did not detract from a very fun and moving experience. And Vin Scully's ""The cathedral that is Yankee Stadium belongs to a Chapel!"" -- comeon, baseball fans, admit it -- that was pretty cool!...",995328000,3,875,4.615384615384615

Three stars for ""For the Love of the Game"".  We loved the baseball (indeed, I suspect that Kevin Costner does as well) and felt that the way flashback were handled from within the context of the game itself was quite effective.
However, we were both disappointed at the development of the relationship.  My wife was completely underwhelmed by Kelly Preston's acting ability (or lack thereof), and I felt that Jane, the character she portrayed was poorly developed -- and frankly, the bits that WERE developed, I didn't like.  I found myself with no sympathy for her whatsoever.
Other pluses to the movie would include the authentic-sounding announcing by Vin Scully, and the remarkable visual and sound editing when Costner is on the mound.

Of his ""baseball"" movies this one is certainly the weakest.  I wish I had spent the money on Field of Dreams or Bull Durham, but oh well.
As far as Costner movies in general go, I'm not a big fan and this one didn't do a whole lot to improve my opinion of him.  For Love of the Game falls closer to the Waterworld/Postman end of the Costner movie spectrum then it does to the Dances with Wolves side.  But if you generally like him then I'm pretty sure that you will enjoy this movie.

Maybe he thought that because he made two baseball themed pictures that were popular and well received by critics and audiences he could fool us into enjoying another. Well, this overly long (more than two mind numbing hours), sappy, and sentimental flick was just more than one person can bear. It might have been okay, worthy of two stars, had the picture shaved off half an hour of the tale which was much more a DULL love story than it was about America's pastime. (I would prefer a film about the latter, more like The Natural with Robert Redford and Glenn Close). Kelly Preston is almost invariably annoying, and this role is no exception. Somehow the relationship between Preston and Costner's characters are not at all believable and are completely contrived. Dialogue is very... superficial and what makes it worse is its obvious aims for something more sophisticated than it was. These relationship films are a delicate sort of thing, and it takes a special skill to pull them off. Costner and Preston don't have the chemistry to make it happen, and the story is just too... sentimental. Costner's character, an aging baseball pitcher, is making what will be his last appearance in major league baseball, and while he is on the mound (and happens to achieve the grandiose no-hitter as an amazing cap to his, of course-cinematically-amazing career) he reminisces about his relationship with Preston's character. Earlier on the morning of the game, he is notified by the owner of the team that the team is changing ownership and rather than trade Costner, the owner thinks it would be a graceful time for Costner to bow out of baseball, while he is still at the top. Just after this, Billy (Costner's character) is dumped by Preston's character, Jane. Naturally this sends the middle-aged softie (yes, and in all these memories he so generously shares with us for more than two hours of out lives he shows himself to be the kind of guy we all hope to find... the guy who loves us for who we are, who loves our children from previous relationships, and someone who really needs us... which is at the heart of the relationship between Billy and Jane. She thinks he does not need her) into a middle-aged reverie... looking back on the good times, and sadly, the bad. But this is all just sugar and spice and everything nice... even the bad times are not THAT bad, and you won't feel compelled to feel anything about these people.

Costner, or Billy Chapel in the movie, comes off as a very likeable character on the team; you see him interact with teamates current or past and you see him as a very sentimental leader. The Chapel of the personal life is not so likeable. He is grouchy and not a very understanding guy; he does a lot of things that come off obnoxious. This is one of the reasons that the personal parts of his story are not so great when you watch them.

63139,5,0783240473,"It used to be that in order to get ""inside a character's head"" you had to read a book, where the author had many pages to use for character and plot development.  Most very good- excellent movies have only 90-120 minutes to do the same, and many fall flat on their faces.  They either focus too much on the game action or on insight into the characters.  Either one can lead to total boredom, depending on your taste for baseball or your taste for ""inner-man/woman"" stories.  Under Sam Raimi's direction, ""For Love of the Game"" has a unique blend of personal/relationship development, really, REALLY getting inside Billy Chapel's head, and real-time/flashback moments that give this picture its balance and appeal.  Some ""professional"" entertainment critics whose musings I follow, either for laughs or information, have called Kevin Costner's acting abilities ""wooden"", ""lackluster"", ""impersonal"", or lacking the ""human touch"".  In most cases, they are far off the evaluation mark---as far as I'm concerned.  It is so in this case.  You might as well use the words ""gushy-mushy drivel"" to sum up their writings about ""For Love....""  The relationship between pitcher (Costner) and catcher (John C. Reilly) establishes the soul of this baseball tale.  The prologue photos of Billy Chapel gives a peek at how he developed his ""love of the game"".  It's been his WHOLE life.  Catcher Gus Sinski(Reilly) knows his teammate virtually inside out and can read Chapel's mind looking through the cage-like mask.  Thus his comment late in the movie ""You're worn out.  You don't have any stuff on the ball. But WE (his team-mates) are here for you NOW"".  And so they are.  Balancing the baseball drama is a relationship one. Enter Jane Aubrey (Kelly Preston), a woman who does NOT want any one else in her life right now, especially a man whose focus seems to be on ONE thing (baseball), rather than people and what makes them tick.  Jane likes her life just the way it is right now, and wants no complications, thank you very much!  Ms. Preston's acting ability is tested over and over again as Chapel swings in and out of her life.  Both Billy and Jane wish very much not to ask or answer the question: ""Now tell me about YOU"".  A breach is made in this relationship wall by a very sneaky tactic: a very personable, extremely confused and angry teen-ager, Heather Aubrey (Jena Malone), Jane's daughter.  We finally get a peek at what we need to know to make this more than just a ""chic flick"" or ""guys game"".  Check it out for yourself.  The baseball side of the balance scale is fleshed out by rabid, in-your-face Yankee fans, and a baseball announcer whose remarks, especially when things get tight, become prosaic enough you'd think a university English major had written them.  The relationship side is given depth by incidences which reveal why neither Jane nor Billy will risk answering the question ""WHO are YOU?""  Adhering to the spirit and the letter of reviewers' agreement with Amazon.com, I can say no more, though I'm really itching to do so.  Maybe they'll let me put it this way: Recall Tom Cruise and Renee Zellweger in ""Jerry MaGuire"".  Jerry's last words were: ""You...complete me"".

As regards ""For Love of the Game"", the above comment applies to both movies and  baseball players! Old-fashioned, straight-ahead storytelling, complimented  by solid performances, extremely  convincing on-the-field action, excellent  photography and more than competent direction by Sam Raimi, make for a  resoundingly entertaining movie...even if you're not much of a baseball  fan.
Perhaps the best thing going for the film is its truly innovative  integration and balance of rapid-fire on-going game vs.  relationship  development flashback elements, allowing the viewer to ""get inside the  athlete's head"" in a way no other movie in recent memory  does.
""For Love"" thusly manages to put a signature spin on the  subjective experience of a great athlete's swan song by sharing &  highlighting the stark contrast between the external precision &  perfection of the real-world game in progress, and the turbulent, highly  personal, inner-world of the passions that drive him.
Kevin Costner,  certainly NOT the greatest actor in the world, literally shines in the  mother of all tailor made roles. Kelly Preston shows us a highly focused  intensity, in just what may be her best on screen appearance to date! John  C. Reilly, although cast as the  solid-as-a-rock-always-there-when-you-need-him-on-the-sidelines Catcher,  plays to the hilt a supporting role, in every sense of the word.
There  are moments in ""For Love"", however, that seem a touch too  maudlin, trying just a little too hard to jerk that extra tear. A few of  these melancoly scenes are drawn out to the point of making the viewer  self-conscious and put upon. These occasional excesses are easily  overlooked, however, in light of the films many strengths and its overal  highly engrossing nature.
TECHNICAL NOTE: Amazon rated picture quality of  the Widescreen DVD version a lackluster 3.5...which leads me to imagine  that either they reviewed a defective copy, or that there were problems  with early prints that were subsequently corrected, because the picture  quality I observed was among the best of my entire DVD collection !",969408000,2,2142,5.36144578313253

In fact, with more and more managers calling the game from  the dugout, the pitching calls from the catcher, well-played by Reilly, and  Costner's verbalization as to why he's accepting them or shaking them off,  may well become a thing of the past, with pitchers no longer having that  option.

The entire  movie takes place in one afternoon, as Costner stands on the pitchers mound  in the middle of Yankee Stadium. As he pitches in what could be his last  game, he begins to look back on his life in a series of flashbacks. He  begins to remember his often stormy romance with his long time ""on again,  off again"" girlfriend, played by Kelly Preston (Jerry McGuire, Jack Frost).  As the movie plays on we are given little bits of insight as to the events  the have played out between Costner and Preston. While he stands in  reflection of his life, he must pitch against the Bronx Bombers in what is  essentially a meaningless game. But as the game wears on, everyone with the  exception of Costner realizes that he is pitching a perfect game, perhaps  the rarest of pitching achievements. The drama builds at the end when you  begin to wonder if he will indeed finish the perfect game, and if he and  Preston will end up together.
Costner does a very good job of playing the  veteran pitcher (he played a veteran catcher in much the same position in  ""Bull Durham"" several years earlier) trying to come to grips with the end  of his career and the possible end of a relationship. Costner is a good fit  in an athletic role, and makes the character believable. I still think all  of his movies spend too much time in a close up of his face, but all things  considered it goes over well. Preston is very likable as his long time  girlfriend, tiring of playing second fiddle to the game, and there are  several strong supporting performances, but the voice of legendary baseball  man Vin Scully brings a feeling of true reality to the film.
I am not a  big fan of a movie told almost entirely in flashback, but once I got used  to it, I did enjoy it. It does seem to be a little disjointed at times, but  it makes its point. I liked the plot and the cast, but at times Costner  becomes too philosophical, and I could do without all the up close shots of  Kevin's face. At this point in his career, if people haven't noticed that  he's handsome they never will. That's why I gave it a four. (The DVD  picture and sound quality are very good and it does have neat little trivia  game with questions about perfect games. It also has the standard info on  the cast on director.)",966902400,3,2638,4.371134020618556
63165,5,0783240473,"People seem to either LOVE Kevin Costner, or HATE Kevin Costner.  To be right up front, I like him.  He makes movies he likes, and movies he would  like to see.  There are 2 themes running parrallel to each other in this  movie; 1. The reflections of a career during an incredible game, and 2. A  compelling love story, also reflected upon during this same game.  BOTH  keep you in 'the game'.  Kelly Preston is terrific!  Her character is very  easy to like, and is an example of very good casting.  Not overbearing, not  show stealing, not someone trying to compete for more attention than her  character needs.  Costner, like his female counterpart, is also terrific.  You can't help BUT cheer for him.  Both for the perfect game he stumbles  upon, and the girl, who has become part of his characters emotional fabric.  Not to be forgotten, is the dialogue delivered by Vin Scully, T.V.  announcer for the Los Angeles Dodgers.  He paints an incredible picture of  the game as it moves through the movie.  His dialogue is delivered better  than any actor could ever try to do.  Another example of great casting.  This movie, on DVD, offers some nice fringe benefits as well.  Deleted  scenes, interviews, and extremely nice audio if your system suports it.  The soundtrack adds alot to this movie.  The music selected is  complimentary, not a character unto itself.  It adds some great dynamics to  the story that is being told. So, is this a great sports movie, or a great  love story.  Well, I can answer this very easily.  They both fit together  so well, fans of both will enjoy this with no regret for watching a great  sports/love/Kevin Costner movie.  If you like a GOOD movie, add this to  your DVD collection.  You'll like watching this again.",966729600,2,1754,4.656765676567657
63166,5,0783240473,"Baseball movies were made to star Kevin Costner.  When it comes to casting an actor to play a baseball player, Kevin Costner is just a  ""natural.""  Okay, that was Robert Redford, but it just worked  with that last sentence.
In this film, Costner plays major-league pitcher  Billy Chapel, who was once the best in the game, but is now in the very  final stages of his career.  He is pitching for the Detroit Tigers against  the first place New York Yankees.  In the process of thinking about his  career and life, he embarks on a wild ride of pitching a perfect  game.
Costner constantly has flashbacks to important moments in his life.  Through them, we get to see him develop as a major league pitcher, and we  watch him mature as a person.  The flashbacks are really well done, and  they are mixed into the film, well, perfectly.
The acting was really good  as well.  The lead role was made for Costner, and he did an excellent job,  especially the baseball scenes.  Kelly Preston was decent as his scorned  lover who still has feelings for Chapel.  The nicest surprise of the move  was John Reilly, the catcher.  He played Costner's best friend and offered  him the support that catchers always give.  He acted exceptionally  well.
The movie had a really nice flow to it.  The camera work was  superb, and the background love story was nicely maintained.  The baseball  scenes were shot very nicely, and the addition of legendary announcer Vin  Scully was a really nice touch.  It made the game seem real.

63168,4,0783240473,"This Baseball Trilogy started in 1988, beginning with Bull Durham, with Costner playing Crash Davis, a down on his luck catcher who must play  behind the new young pitcher, ""Nuke"" LaLoosh(Tim Robbins)while  falling for the lovely Annie Savoy (Susan Sarandon).  Field Of Dreams  continued the trilogy with Costner, this time, playing Iowa farmer, Ray  Kinsella, who one day begins hearing voices in his cornfield, telling him  that if he builds a baseball field, the legendary Shoeless Joe Jackson  would come to play there.  And finally, Mr. Costner completes his baseball  trilogy with For Love Of The Game, a baseball/love story with Costner  playing Billy Chapel, a renowned and revered baseball pitcher for the  Detroit Tigers who's last game and season of his career is coming to an  end.  As we watch this game we are introduced thru flashbacks, Chapel's  past and what leads him to where he is now.  The baseball sequences are  flawless, looking just like the kind of game you'd watch on regular TV.  As  good a baseball player as Billy Chapel is, we find he is a very flawed man,  especially when it comes to finding the right person to share his personal  life with.  Enter Jane (Kelly Preston) who he meets on the side of the road  one day while she's kicking her car for breaking down.  The two decide to  meet each other whenever he's in town for a game, with no other strings  attached.  Of course things grow into more than this, especially when Jane  calls Billy to help her find her daughter who has run away from home.  As  you watch the game and in-between, view the flashbacks, you get a well  rounded character who, in his own right, is trying to do the right thing.  No one is to blame like most conventional romances, because both people  have legitimate reasons for acting the way that they do.  This is about a  man, who, at the end of his career, realizes that as important as baseball  means to him, life is very lonely if there is no one there to love and care  about the person inside.  This film has been widely criticized as being a  rip-off of Bull Durham.  But I like to look at it as Part 3 of a trilogy,  like Star Wars for example.  The first film wowed us, especially with  scenes of the players talking on the field that we wouldn't be able to hear  in real life.  The second film tugged at our hearts and our emotions for  our love of baseball itself.  And the third film sort of brings those two  pieces together (Return OF The Jedi has been said to just be a revamp of  Star Wars: A New Hope but we still love it).  If you look at it in this  manner, this film is a well made, well thought out piece of film making,  ingeniously directed by Mr. Sam Raimi. (Evil Dead 1, 2 and 3, A Simple  Plan) Included on the DVD is a Spotlight On Location featurette, giving us  some more insight on the making of the film as well as creating the  characters.  Deleted scenes, including one, used in the film, but here  showing the original profanity used by Kelly Preston.  The History Of The  Perfect Game is a nice read if you've got the time, giving background to  that most cherished game for a pitcher, plus a trivia game and the original  theatrical trailer.  While some people may still scoff, For Love Of The  Game delivers to those who still believe in the power of baseball and love.",966124800,2,3320,4.440734557595993
63169,2,0783240473,"Getting ready to watch a Kevin Costner movie is like preparing for a siege: one needs to stock up on a hefty assortment of supplies because, if there is one thing we can be sure of, it's that we are in for a very long  haul. Actually, as Costner movies go, this 138-minute film is relatively  short - though its glacial pacing makes it seem eternal anyway. For sheer,  unadulterated tedium, this movie is, at the very least, a match for  Costner's previous romantic opus, ""Message in a  Bottle.""
Directed, shockingly, by the normally astute and insightful  Sam Raimi ( a bizarre capitulation on his part to slick, empty commercial  moviemaking), ""For Love of the Game"" seems like a film caught in  a movie genre limbo. Half reverential baseball movie and half sappy  romance, it seems catered to satisfy two widely disparate audiences that  wouldn't be caught dead standing in the same line at the local cineplex.  Perhaps, this is a pitch to come up with the perfect date movie (though  ""Titanic"" beat them to it - romance and Leonardo Di Caprio for  the ladies, sinking ship and mass death for the boys).
Costner, in  another of his near-catatonic performances, portrays Billy Chapel, a  40-year old, soon to be over-the-hill pitcher for the Detroit Tigers who,  in a single day, learns that his team has been sold, he is about to be  traded to the Giants and his girlfriend of five years is leaving right that  very moment to start a new career in London. This set-up might have  resulted in an incisive study of a man caught in an age-limited career  learning to cope with the inevitable trauma of saying farewell and moving  on. Instead, the writers settle for a stale movie romance, with Chapel  standing on the mound, pitching his final game and flashing back like mad  to the happier days of ballfield triumphs and blossoming true love. The  film is ostensibly concerned with Chapel's success on the diamond but he  soon learns that even pitching a historical no-hitter and being carried  around in triumph on the shoulders of adoring team members and diehard  admirers is mere ashes without that one true love to share it with. The  screenplay, in fact, is so heavily weighted in the direction of the affair  he is having with Jane (Kelly Preston) that baseball fans are sure to feel  slighted - until the very end.
Even in the ballpark, though, the film is  a failure. Why do so many movies, including this one, treat baseball as  some sort of holy rite, some sacred mission replete with corny imagery,  nauseating pep talks and cliched, slow motion views of tear-soaked faces  amid the euphoric masses? The detrimental effect of ""Field of  Dreams"" cannot be overestimated. Just once couldn't we see a film that  treats the sport for what it is - a fun pastime, completely devoid of  sentimentality?
I will say one thing for this movie though: in  comparison to itself, it does make baseball look like a fastpaced sport!",964483200,2,2930,4.717391304347826
63170,2,0783240473,"For Love of the Game has its moments, but overall disappoints.  The love story is cliched as hell, but some will enjoy it.  The baseball scenes are good, but the players just didn't seem like major leaguers to me.  Also, I  found the announcers at the game (Vin Scully and someone else) kind of  annoying.  Their banter just didn't ring true.
Costner's performance is  marginal.  One of the central plot elements is his character's balance of  the two loves of his life--Preston's character and baseball.  Baseball has  always been the clear number one, but he finally realizes during his final  game as a player that, hey, maybe he does have room for a woman.  Convenient timing there, Kevin!
If the movie was around 1:30 long it  would have been a whole lot better.  The simple plot just didn't support a  two hour plus run time.",963446400,2,831,4.627586206896551
63181,4,0783240473,"I've always been a Costner fan, even when he has stretched my patience.  ""For the Love of the Game"" did a lot for me in bringing back fond memories of the game which I used to love when I was a kid.  Costner's sports movies  are among his most entertaining, and bringing in Vin Skully added  tremendously to the realism of this film.
Although I do agree (somewhat)  in many reviewers' disappointment concerning the relationship aspect in  this film, it still held enough interest for me that I enjoyed the film as  a whole (heck, I almost bought it hook-line-and-sinker, but then again, I  can be a real sucker).  I also liked how the love aspect of the story was  told in flashbacks as Chapel (Costner) was pitching the game of his life.  I believe that many people may actually enjoy this film who are not  baseball fans, but it sure couldn't hurt if you were.
Between 1 and 10, I  give ""For the Love of the Game"" a solid 7.  It's nice to see an actor who  is athletic enough to pull off a sports movie and make it look real.  Some  of the scenes (where people are watching the ""game"" on television, ala  Kelly Preston at the airport bar) looked 100 percent authentic.  I would  have no hesitation in viewing this film a second time, especially the dvd  version (if it puts back what was left on the cutting room floor, as one  reviewer indicated).",962323200,,1350,4.380566801619433

I thought this was a fun and involving movie that did a  good job examining the inevitable changes that occur in one's life.  Here,  we have the cliched love story plot, but it does the trick in getting that  ""change"" theme across.
Costner's character is dealing with  letting go of the things he loves; an experience that most everyone has had  at some point in life.

Kelly Preston was also impressive.  I only know her as the  helplessly awful ex-fiance of Jerry Maguire's, and I thought this role was  a wonderful departure from that.

What's aggravating is that  *For Love of the Game*  could have been great.  In fact, its design is ambitious and it has a good  story to tell, but the execution disappoints.  As is typical of films in  the  '90's, slow pacing deadens any suspense, grounds the narrative flow to  a lumbering halt, and eventually obliterates any interest in the outcome.  I have nothing against long films;  I have a LOT against slow pacing, which  is really the pestilence of moviemaking just recently.  A film can be 80  minutes long and still be slow-paced.  Directors are trying to fool us:  long pauses in dialogue are meant to convince us of deep thought;  aimlessly constructed scenes are meant to convince us of  ""realistic""  depictions of life.  Movies are not life.  They are  an art form.  Big difference.
Perhaps Mr. Raimi likes baseball, otherwise  the idea of him helming this project doesn't make any sense.  This is real  hack-work, without any evidence of the unique talent he's shown us in the  past.  (Perhaps the somber  *A Simple Plan*  was a warning.)  Rather than  focusing on the story, the director chooses to give us long close-ups of  the burnished and bland Kevin Costner and Kelly Preston.  Cliches are  favored over uniqueness.

We know there's nothing at stake for this losing team -- they've got no  shot at the playoffs -- but Billy's career is possibly over and he wants  nothing more than to WIN THIS GAME.
Kevin Costner's latest baseball  effort falls somewhere between ""Bull Durham"" and ""Field of  Dreams"" on the ""seriousness"" scale.  While not as sweepingly  romanticizing of the game of baseball as ""Field of Dreams"", this  film does treat its subject with due reverence all the same.  The baseball  scenes are extremely well done, and baseball fans should enjoy them.  Those  who do not enjoy baseball won't necessarily dislike this film, but it will  appeal more to fans of the game.
Some may criticize the love story  (although I found it quite sweet), but in any case this is not meant to be  a love story between two people, but rather between a man and his passion  for playing baseball.  And like many classic romances, the lovers -- man  and baseball -- don't always wind up living happily ever after together.  Does this mean he ""settles"" for the romance he CAN have -- with  the woman?  Of course not.  The film is all about Billy coming to grips  with the reality of his finished career, what his wants are, and what his  NEEDS are.  He is not a perfect human being -- in fact he is quite flawed  -- but in his quest for the perfect game he realizes perfection in life is  elusive.",957744000,,1597,4.505263157894737
63205,3,0783240473,"Billy Chapel (Costner), pitching what will be his last game, is so dominating in fact, that NOTHING gets to first base -- not even the romance.  That's the curious split-quality about this film.  It offers very  realistic and exciting baseball scenes, while at the same time plodingly  developing a romantic story-line through the vehicle of flashbacks while  Chapel succeeds on the mound.  An interesting cinematic twist, for sure.  Nevertheless, it fails because the romance, like a bunt foul, just doesn't  get the pulse going.
 Billy's flashbacks seem all-too intentionally  fashioned to cram in every cliche of the romance genre.  Jane is the cute  career-minded woman, but is ever-so reluctant to acknowledge any interest  in commitment.  She vacilates like crazy, then takes a chance and visits  Billy at spring training, unannounced.  You guessed it, she stumbles in on  him just as the ""other girl""  (in obligatory briefs) appears on  the staircase and asks about the hair dryer.  Likewise, he stumbles in on  one of her writing assignments to find... (well you know already). There is  the ""surprise daughter"" from a previous relationship, which by  this time the audience fully expects.  And then there's Billy's soulfully  staring into Jane's apartment window (in the rain, no less) as he sees her  dim figure move towards the ""other guy.""
 Okay, enough.  Let's  just get back to the drama of the baseball game.  This is done, mercifully,  at varioius junctures in the plot. One wonders how much more powerful a  film like this might have been if, say, Billy started the game havig to  make a momentous decision on the relationship. The flashbacks might then  have explored alternative scenarios, leaving the audience guessing until  the ""real"" decision (and outcome) is revealed at the conclusion  of the perfect game. That would have been  more like baseball -- running  the alternatives over and over in one's mind.
 Unfortunately, the movie  just drags on with the worn out ""I want her, I hope she wants me  enough to come back"" theme.

63210,5,0783240473,I love baseball and was thrilled with this movie. It deals with the thought process of baseball and its emotional side. It is more than a stereotyped film. It brings out the child that loved to play baseball in  all of us. I would highly recommend this film for the fan of baseball who  loves a romantic film. Kevin Costner gives a stellar role here. One can  tell he has a love for baseball. The acting is well done and the ending is  moving.,956620800,,443,4.238095238095238
63221,1,0783240473,"Adding to his ever-expanding list of stinkers, Kevin Costner portrays a dull, self-indulgent loser who, while throwing a predictable (and ridiculous, given some of the plays in the field) perfect game, romances an  equally vapid (and horribly portrayed) woman played by Kelly Preston. While  no chemistry exists between the two leads, that in itself is not the main  reason this film bombs. Instead, we have what should have been a rousing,  inspiring baseball yarn turned into a color-by-numbers, depressing journey  into the tragically boring ""psyche"" of Costner. After ""A  Simple Plan,"" I expected much more from Sam Raimi, yet it appears that  after a critical success, he decided it was imperative that he once again  put food on the table and strike out for a commercial triumph. That Raimi  asks the audience to care for such poorly drawn cartoons is one of the most  audacious demands in the history of cinema. And before I end this review,  let me once again state that Preston gives one of the worst performances  since the invention of sound, especially in a hospital scene that sets new  standards for stilted line deliveries. Truly awful.",956620800,8,1151,4.994736842105263

I was raised on baseball, played baseball, watched my children play baseball, and live for opening day!  In this movie was the  mystique, the drama, the fun, the excitement, and the perfection of the  game.  Kevin Costner is perfect as the aging pitcher who stands on the  brink of greatness.  As other reviews have said, he comes alive in the  game, while reflecting on what has almost eluded his grasp.
Costner's  baseball trilogy is now complete.  And perfect, just as Billy Chappel's  final game.",956275200,2,590,4.686274509803922
63223,4,0783240473,"This is an excellent baseball movie and a decent romantic entry as well.  Billy Chapel (Kevin Costner) is a veteran pitcher with an accomplished career who is headed for the Hall of Fame.  On the day we meet him he has a  lot on his mind.  He is informed that his team is being sold, he is being  traded and the love of his life is moving to England.  Add to this the pain  in his pitching arm, his impending decision on whether to retire and the  fact that winning this game is critical in determining if the Yankees go to  the playoffs, and you have a man with overloaded neurons.
The story  unfolds as an introspective retrospective.  As he is pitching this  important game, he is thinking about his childhood, his relationship with  Jane (Kelly Preston) and how he is going to get the next batter out.  He is  so preoccupied that it doesn't even dawn on him until the eighth inning  that there have been no Yankee hits and he has been pitching a perfect  game.
The flashback elements are expertly woven into the game, giving  us a genuine feeling for his distraction.  This is a fresh perspective for  a sports movie.  Instead of simply focusing on what the player is doing,  the film focuses on what he is thinking while he is doing it.  It gives us  an authentic look at how athletes get ""in the zone"", filtering out all the  noise and concentrating totally on their performance.  Those who have been  involved in athletic competition can identify with this state, although  only the best can achieve it at will.
Sam Raimi's direction on this film  was excellent.  His direction of the love story was nothing special, but he  did a superb job on the baseball scenes.  The combination of on the field  action, commentary by Vin Scully and simulated TV telecast footage was so  well done that it was impossible to differentiate it from a major league  game in progress.
The acting ranged from fair to excellent.  Kelly  Preston was very good as Jane.  She brought a full range of emotional  expression to the part, though she sometimes got a little shrill, like the  scene in the hospital where she screams out ""Is this America?  Is baseball  still the national pastime.""  Overall though, she played the part of the  torn lover very well.
Kevin Costner is no great lead actor and it is hard  to understand why he is so popular.  Perhaps it is his whiny lost boy charm  that makes women want to mother him.  In the love story, he again presented  as listless and uninspired.  But in the baseball scenes, he came alive.  In  fact, in these scenes Costner was not acting so much as acting out.  He  loves baseball and was obsessed with doing all his own baseball scenes.  He  is a top notch athlete, so he really could throw a curveball and his  fastball had plenty of pop.  His ability to portray a professional athlete  in this instance was superlative, probably due to his having played the  game scholastically.  So overall, I would have to rate his performance  here as very good.
John Reilly gets a very honorable mention as Chapel's  catcher.  He was quietly supportive and unobtrusive, the way catchers  usually are.  He portrayed intense desire in a demure and low key way  without overacting.  It was a nice performance by an actor in a supporting  role playing a baseball player in a supporting role.
I love baseball and  this was a great baseball movie so I rated it 8/10.  Anyone who enjoys  sports will probably enjoy this film.",955929600,53,3443,4.546052631578948
63224,5,0783240473,"Many times in life we fail to realize the things we have until they walk out of our life forever.  That was what happened to Costner in this movie.  He loved baseball more than anything and failed to realize what really made  him happy.  All of this changes within his nine innings of perfection.  Here he not only throws the game of his life, but also gets the love of his  life back.  All in all a great flick!",955756800,2,412,4.139240506329114
63225,5,0783240473,An outstanding combination of sports and romance that will stimulate the emotions in all but the most case-hardened.  Will satisfy the sports fans as well as the romantics.

63226,5,0783240473,"How this movie was not nominated for an academy award I will never know. This movie is not only for people who truely love the game, but Costner brings his romance for Kelly Preston and the love for the game together as  one.  Beautiful movie.",955324800,,243,4.377777777777778
63227,3,0783240473,"Kevin Costner again delivers a fine performance as an aging ballplayer at a crossroads in his life.  Unlike in Bull Durham, this time Costner plays a ""sure-fire Hall of Famer"" who may be pitching his last game in  the bigs.  Most of the story centers on this game, with Costner's character  Billy Chappel looking back through flashbacks to key moments in his life  and career.  Most of the flashbacks deal with the end of the pitcher's  romance with his girlfriend, played by Kelly Preston.  The romance itself  is lukewarm, and at times it seems the only reason these two are together  is because the script says so.  John C. Reilly does a great job as the  veteran catcher also looking at his last shot of glory.  Jena Malone and  Anthony Fultz are winners in supporting roles.  While the romance plays out  well, there should have been more attention played to the flashbacks of  other portions of the pitcher's life and career.  His parents and fellow  players are given too little time in the flashbacks, and some storylines  are left ripe on the vine.  Real baseball fans will groan at some of this  movie (if you know that Frank Robinson is fourth all-time on the career  homerun list, don't expect greatness here), but overall, the actors do a  decent job as major leaguers.  Vin Scully adds the most realism for the  real baseball fan. Overall, this movie rates high.  It loses points for  undeveloped stories, but still scores big. For all the buildup, the ending  falls a little flat.  A few may shed tears at the end of the baseball game,  but this is no ""Brian Song"", so men may not cry.  If you like  baseball movies, this is worth a watch.",955324800,,1654,4.573883161512027
63228,4,0783240473,"The framework is a major league baseball game. The memories are those of an aging pitcher, Billy Chapel, whose day is not going well at all. His team, the Detroit Tigers are out of the pennant race and expected to lie down like a dog at the behest of the New York Yankees. Moreover, the team has been sold and Chapel is expected to be traded to San Francisco when the sale is announced. His lover, Jane Aubrey, has told him that she ""can't do this anymore"" and she's headed to London and out of his life. As his catcher, Gus Osinski, told him, it's just not his day.
We're often told that baseball is like life; it meanders and goes along paths we may not expect. And so it is with Billy Chapel, who is pitching his heart out while he relives his life, especially after a chance meeting with Aubrey on a bridge over the Harlem River. Her car has broken down and Chapel stops, ostensibly to help her fix it. Jane, being the cynical New Yorker she is, waves Billy off, but he's intrigued and he prevails on Jane to let him take a look under her hood. Aubrey gets behind the wheel, turns the key; nothing happens. Chapel reaches in, jiggles a wire or two and, to his fortune, the car starts. Jane is pleased and thanks Billy who admits he didn't really do anything. Of course, in a typical New York moment, the tow truck shows up and the operator more or less demands that Aubrey let her car be towed. Chapel uses the opportunity to invite her to a game he's pitching and dinner afterwards.
Now, it might be thought that Billy Chapel is setting himself up for a groupie situation. After a night of passionate sex, that's exactly what Aubrey thinks as well and she wants no part of it. What follows is a recounting of how Billy and Jane come together and fall apart more than once.
This is an excellent baseball movie, with wonderful dramatic stretches and also lots of humor. Kevin Costner, who's done a baseball movie or two in his career, is totally believable as Billy Chapel, a character who seem somewhat modeled after Steve Carlton in that he only wants to pitch to his longtime battery-mate, Osinski (John C. Reilly). Osinski knows Chapel's abilities well and he needles and cajoles Chapel to get the most out of him, not only on the diamond, but in life as well. Vin Scully and Steve Lyons of Fox Sports appear as themselves doing the play-by-play of the game we see unfolding before our eyes. Scully's dialogue sounds as if it sprang right from his mouth, the way he normally speaks. I'd be interested in whether his dialogue was written (most likely) or ad lib.
If there's a disappointment among the entire production, it is the performance of Kelly Preston as Jane Aubrey. Aubrey, we discover along the way, has a past which would seem to explain her on-again / off-again relationship with Chapel. Not all of this is Preston's fault; some of it has to belong to screenwriter Dana Stevens who adapted a novel by Michael Shaara. The baseball scenario is near-perfection, but the treatment of the romance leaves something to be desired. Regardless, Sam Raimi's near-flawless direction of material we don't normally see him do, makes the entire film one to enjoy. It has excellent comic timing, yet marvelous dramatic sequence both surrounding the game and external to it. Basil Poledouris' original score heightened the drama and never detracted from the film.
If you like baseball, you'll love this movie. Costner, who co-produced, must bring something extra to movies about baseball because of his love of the game. This film is one of those that truly has something for everyone and almost completely pulls it off. I heartily recommend it.

63261,4,0783240473,"I admit it, I've seen dozen of movies about base-ball and I still don't quite understand the rules of the game. But, one thing is certain, it's possible to play the game of his life in one and only game : it's called  the perfect game. And Kevin Costner, in director Samuel Raimi's FOR LOVE OF  THE GAME, is on his way for it.
FOR LOVE OF THE GAME is a typical genre  movie, the hero can't be happy until he has fulfilled the dream of his  life, until he is part of america's history. With this theme, you're sure  to attract the local audience's votes. It's human.
So, the quality of the  movie depends only on the director's skill or desire to play some  variations on this common theme. For instance, until now, in my opinion,  Barry Levinson's THE NATURAL with Robert Redford is clearly the best  baseball related movie ever filmed.
After a western and a film noir,  Samuel Raimi is going to shock one more time his long-time supporters with  FOR LOVE OF THE GAME. No more hysterical travellings and zooms, not a  single gunshot, the young ""crazy horse"" director, like Kevin  CHAPEL Costner, has an eighteen years career behind him. One could say that  FOR LOVE OF THE GAME is the first adult movie of Samuel Raimi. And it is a  compliment.
Excellent compositions of Costner, Kelly Preston and Th.  Reilly. Above-average bonus features but I would have appreciated a  director's commentary.

I just saw the DVD and the deleted scenes, that can finally  be seen, make for a much more complicated and moving story.  Particularly  the subplot with his coach's wife's struggle with cancer and when his  friend on the Yankees came in to congratulate him and say goodbye. Those  were the scenes that made these characters real and took down the wall of  ""just baseball"" and made it a satisfying drama.

This is the biggest waste of talent that I've encountered in quite a while - Sam Raimi, Basil Poledouris, those  two are among the best in their professions. And what did they do? Well,  let me put it this way: They took a popular sport, took every energy out of  it (the Baseball-scenes are repeated endlessly, same style, again and  again), added some of the worst dialogue ever and put a romance at the  center of the story. That ain't so bad, but there's no chemistry between  Costner and Wright-Penn. I could go on, but you get the point. At the end,  you're happy it's over. No climax, just a needless 'happy end'.
