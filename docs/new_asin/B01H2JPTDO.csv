7772149,3,B01H2JPTDO,"The Season gets 5 stars,  but HBO and Amazon get points taken off for the delayed release.  I'm an HBO subscriber,  but I purchase the instant video for my son,  who is in a country that doesn't support HBO streaming... it would be great if he didn't have to wait to watch.

7772164,1,B01H2JPTDO,I do not recommend buying any DVD's or Blu-Rays from this seller.  We purchased Seasons 1 to 5 of Game of Thrones from Target and Best Buy and the picture clarity was fantastic.  It is apparent that Season 6 that we purchased from this seller does not seem to be an original copy.  It has ultra low video quality which affects our enjoyment of Season 6.  I am very disappointed in this purchase from this seller.,1534464000,,412,4.381578947368421

7772202,5,B01H2JPTDO,"I love everything.  I don't dislike anything.  When I first saw ads for Game of Thrones I immediately was super turned off and was sure it was ultra stupid and knew it sucked.  Somehow I wound up watching about 5 minutes of an episode and was instantly hooked.  I've since bought every season.  Every single episode/season is the bomb.  Best TV movie ever made.  Super engaging plots, music, interior and exterior settings, color, characters, suspense, eroticism and everything else are top of the heap.  I've bought entire seasons and watched 2-3 episodes a night.  Can't begin to recommend it highly enough.  I can't believe that  Season 8 isn't going to be aired until next year.  When I heard it was going to be aired this summer I got freaked out wondering how I could wait an entire year without seeing a new season.  Recently learned that it won't come out until next year (2019) and that it will only have 6 episodes.  What an immense bummer.  But I'm sure it will be more than worth it.  I'm in love with Queen Daenerys and won't be able to stand it if anything bad happens to her.",1529107200,,1090,4.512820512820513

It doesn't match up on the shelf, very disappointing. If you're not OCD, then you may not care and that's fine. But if you are a bit OCD like I am, and if you haven't yet started collecting these sets, then don't start here. Wait for the complete box set to be released.",1529107200,,414,4.1875

7772207,4,B01H2JPTDO,"The sixth season of Game of Thrones finally sees the Mother of Dragons heading toward her birthright.

We see Jon Snow come into his own. Little Finger is causing trouble as always.

Cersei has her most successful and malevolent triumphs to date, and oddly, you will find yourself rooting for her at times.

The Ironborn divide into factions, and everyone's favorite, Tyrion, rises to an appropriate and fun position.

The CGI is masterfully done, and the big battle scenes are simply amazing.

What pushes this boxed set over the top is the wonderful extras!

I loved the look behind the scenes.  It is stunning just how many people are involved in the production of Game of Thrones.

Just to close the loop, the TV Series has entirely left the GRRM book plots at this point.  There were some lingering scenes that intersected with the last published book, Dances with Dragons, and very few of the scenes and plot-lines followed the book.  So, when GRRM does finally complete the last book, it will be the conclusion to an entirely different series.

All in all, a fun romp.",1529020800,4,1075,4.725806451612903

This is just a lousy season of GoT.  It is and feels like the writing and production staff are treading water while figuring out where to go after going beyond the books.  Where episodes from the previous seasons typically were crisp and packed with story, this season . . . well . . . this season's episodes were not.  There were times when watching felt almost like a tedious chore.  Sure, they would throw the audience a bone now and then, but this season largely was little more than methadone.",1517270400,,655,4.46218487394958

7772394,5,B01H2JPTDO,"This series has been outstanding.  As a 50 year lover of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings I say this rivals those sagas and even outshines them in bringing a fantasy world to vivid life.  The production values are outstanding for a TV series.  I also like that it realistically presents the moral choices facing those who lead and those who seek to honor their sometimes conflicting obligations to family, oath and tribes.  The characters are portrayed as real people with strengths and flaws.  Their lives and destinies are precarious where even high virtue or best laid plans can not save them.  In our temporarily secure world we have forgotten that in most of human history, and most of this world, life works that way/",1510272000,2,727,4.68503937007874

7772476,5,B01H2JPTDO,"I am not writing this review for the season itself (It is my favorite by far), but rather for those of us fans that expect better packaging or special editions for our most beloved tv shows/movies. I have read plenty of complaints about the packaging getting worse and worse as the seasons progressed. I hadn't bought one since Season 3 and that was because of a couple things. It had some of the most shocking events, and THE PACKAGING (View Images)! I am not ready to jump the gun on going full Digital, much less Streaming. I like to display the cool packaging for one, but also just owning the physical media is more convenient when you don't always have the best internet connectivity. Plus, it'll never look as good as Blu-Ray HD. Anyway, that's another topic...

For Season 6, I was highly disappointed that HBO yet again didn't release a Limited Edition that was closer to what they'd provided for Season 3. However, I was relieved that there were multi store exclusives. I got my Season 6 from Best Buy because they were offering the Steelbook version at the time. So, I say to those who are yet unaware, BUY THE STEELBOOKS! The packaging so much better! It's nice and shiny, it's light but sturdy, comeswith a little collectable (Season 6 has a Iron Bank of Bravos magnet), and the inside comes with the 4 discs on 2 plastic holders that are tightly secured to the aluminum packaging. It can still be improved, but I think the steelbooks beat the standard editions most people seem to be purchasing and giving negative reviews for. So, again if you are on the fence of buying Season 6 or any other season or tv show on Blu-Ray, seek out Steelbook versions. The only version at the moment that looks the quality that the show deserves to be presented in. I really hope that these become the standard onward for Game of Thrones, and other shows.

7772477,3,B01H2JPTDO,"Don't get me wrong, the sixth season was great. This review is focused on the inferior jewel case/packaging and the less-than-interesting disc artwork. The discs are all black, as the ink was just poured on. Ugly, IMO. The case fell apart upon opening. We keep all the cases, and this one isn't great. The video quality is as expected, though.

Waaay thinner cardboard box and whereas in previous seasons each disc got it's own recessed bay these overlap each other. I know they are preparing us for a box reduction size for 7 episodes in season 7 and 6 in season 8 but really? So sad they're taking us fans for granted like this and going out all shrunk down and rushed instead of the way it should have been.

But the last few Seasons (4-7) have been much better, and the characters and constant shifts in power and payback are utterly compelling.  Excellent acting - and casting.  Nothing normal for sure!!

Sadly, a huge difference in quality I immediately noticed with this season 6. Poor quality of video, a lot of blurring in both foreground and background. Immensely noticed during a scene on disc 1 that contains subtitles in the city of Mereen, the letters are actually fuzzy. Sound quality is poor as well, goes from too loud to too soft, I have to keep remote close and continuously adjust volume. Even the packaging is of poor quality, upon arrival disc 5 had already slipped from its holder during shipping and arrived scratched. Is this a poorly made pirated DVD set?!

7772576,5,B01H2JPTDO,"++++WARNING this will contain spoilers from prior seasons, but no major giveaways from season 6+++++

This is the season where the TV show really puts its own stamp and gives its own take on the overall story.  This is due in large part because the show has now got ahead of the books, and while they were given a broad outline from George Martin on where he is taking the story and things that will happen in the subsequent books, there was no clear guide or structure from a book to work with.  It can certainly be argued that the showrunners could have used more story lines from the books that are already out to allow Martin time to have finished Winds of Winter, but honestly they did a good enough job advancing the story along without the structure of a full book that you cannot really tell a difference from the previous seasons.  And given the difficulty of locking actors into long term contracts to wait for Martin to finish the series of novels, it was always bound to get to this point.

I will not get into much detail about the season itself because even to mention episode names would give away spoilers.  But what I will say, is that some story lines are tied up (like the cliffhanger from Season 5 where Jon Snow is stabbed and left for dead, and the High Septon story), and the overall arc of the contenders for the throne finally having it out are advanced.  I think most know how the Jon Snow thing resolved itself, but for the few who managed to stay spoiler free all this time, I will not ruin it.  Needless to say, the resolution has a big effect on the season overall.  This season also sees the Bran/Three-eyed Raven story that was omitted last season pick up again.  Because of this story line, we also learn more of Ned's back-story and confirmation of the big hypothesis that was floating around online (and which was according to the commentary track was what the show's creators had to guess in order to get Martin's okay to develop the series).  Again I am sure most know what that is, but for those who do not, I will not spoil it.

For those who get the blu-ray, it looks and sounds great as usual.  The extras are pretty much the same as in prior seasons, a few featurettes (including one on the season's big battle and a behind the scenes look at the day where all three units were filming in the main studio at the same time), commentary tracks (this time, at least one on every episode and a handful have two), and the in-episode interactive guides.  The best commentary track, in my opinion, is the one from episode 9 which includes Sophie Turner.  She basically spends the whole time chewing on carrots after all the big moments and dropping f-bombs, with hilarious results.  There is definitely a lot of good stuff for those who enjoy going through all the extra material.

If you do not like the show there is nothing about this season that is likely going to change your mind about it.  It is, of course, telling one long complex story about a battle for leadership of a realm.  This season really did well in moving the overall story closer to a final resolution.  Ultimately if you love the show, and want all the extra bonus material getting the blu-ray (or DVD) is worth it..",1502064000,,3224,4.441426146010187

The production quality continues to be amazing. The battle scenes, especially the large scale battles, are what you would expect to find in a major motion picture not a tv series. Interesting branching/sometimes overlapping story lines, brilliant acting, beautiful costumes, sets, etc. But the series still has many adult situations, a lot of adult content, language, nudity, sex, gore, etc. so NOT for children. Can't pick a favorite episode in this season since we enjoyed them all. None of the negatives, (for us anyway), like in the season 2, 3 or 4 reviews. They changed how they filmed those scenes and the series is much better for it.

The four stars is because I've been paying roughly the same price for each season ($30-$35ish) one by one as they've come out, and yet this is the first one that was only the Blu-Ray.  Every other season I purchased was Blu-Ray plus digital HD.  I don't even remember having an option before, though of course I've been doing this for years now.  So buyer beware if you're looking for something that you can easily take on your travels, it seems that for that version you have to pay a little more now.

7772635,4,B01H2JPTDO,"Actually I just started watching last fall and binged watched all 6 seasons.....I wanted to know what the big deal was....I ALMOST did not get through the first season because there was SO MUCH pornography and violence...rape and slitting the horse throat really threw me over the edge. However, with that being said, I did finish it because the story is phenomenal, the sets are amazing, the costumes are breath taking....and the acting is well pretty darn good...I was disappointed with the unnecessary pornographic sex and extreme violence. The story is so great and a lot of those situations could be ""implied"" rather than camera in your face stuff. I thought HBO could have told the story without all the graphic violence and still maintained a phenomenal fantastical story.  It could have been right up there with Lord of the Rings.....Unfortunately they chose to cheapen it.  I'm still going to watch it though and have nervous breakdowns and switch it off when my daughter  walks in the room.",1500249600,,1000,4.940476190476191
7772636,3,B01H2JPTDO,"Game of drama.  Could be a great fantasy, but all the soap opera they bring in just reminds me of 'All My Children'.  Who would of guessed so many sci fi/fantasy fans are closet soap opera fans.  Same thing ruined Battlestar Galactica reboot.  Also many of the episodes are extremely boring, only to have it end with something shocking (yeah like soap).  I continue to watch because, well, dragons are awesome.

To get to the 2nd or 4th disc you have to remove the top disc which is annoying  when you just want to watch a certain disc. You have to be careful you don't scratch that top disc while removing it, as you have to slide it out a bit after popping it out from the center holder. Not the greatest box set this season.

It seems, producers came out of puff by parading fictious wittchery as a major force of the latest developments of a story so much looking as a sarcastic mirroring of a ""universal language"" world's history and ethics.

Also rotation of the Lanisters on a throne is much applaudable, this ten part sequence leaves an impression of in-between installment in demand for a further Season to sort out mess and gore dominating under-R-classification-otherwise show.

Unwittingly (?) depicting a pack of dogs savaging victims at a feudal's whistle and a seemingly independent-from-a-state goody-heralded self-appointed judging craft bloodthirsty for ""sinners"" is a fresh moviemakers' approach too radical for further commenting.",1495497600,,908,5.605839416058394

You know when you watch a show and you are just waiting....and waiting.... for that one thing you hope will happen (and usually doesn't cause it's Game of Thrones and George RR Martin feeds off of the tears of his fans lol!), well I had at least 3 moments in this season where I felt that extreme satisfaction.

2/5 Stars for the packaging, which is vastly inferior to previous seasons. You can really tell whoever designed the packaging decided to cut corners and cut costs, and the product itself suffers because of this.

If I wanted nothing but the movies I'd buy the episodes digitally. Getting them on Bluray is partially for the discs for collection. Instead of the book-like high quality fold out, they've gone with a cheap plastic 2-discs per page. It feels cheap. It looks cheap. It's pathetic next to the other seasons.

The packaging is NOT GoT quality. Very disappointed. For collectors out there, you may want to wait until a collector's set comes out in a couple years once the show is finished.",1492560000,18,730,4.777777777777778

7772822,2,B01H2JPTDO,"For the show itself, 5 stars wouldn't be enough.  I think it's extraordinary.  But I'm rating the DVD sets here.  I purchased Seasons 1-6 as the separate sets, have watched them all and I'm just shocked and frankly angry at what poor quality these are.  The picture is just awful, particularly in scenes that are dark.  Think VHS quality.  I do not exaggerate. And it's every season, though oddly enough, some episodes are worse than others.

I really don't understand this.  I have many other shows on DVD, including HBO ones, and none of them are like this.  Muddy, blotchy, artifact-laden image quality, and sometimes even skipping.  For disclaimer's sake no, it is not my player, not my TV (I've tried them on a few players and screens), and these are the legit, licensed sets.

Then there's the packaging itself.  The ""fat"" sets that fold out with a disk on each page (versus the ""stacked disk"" sets) are also crap.  The plastic disk holders have a tendency to come unglued from the cardboard backings. I've heard others mention the same issue.  Again, I have other sets with a similar design and this doesn't happen with those.  What the heck is going on with the quality control where they're making these?  GoT deserves better.

Anyway, I can't recommend buying these.  And considering some of the problems I've heard with the BluRay disks, too (and my own negative experiences with BluRay players which makes me steer clear of converting over to that format), I'm not tempted to purchase again.  I'd recommend renting the shows instead and save your money, perhaps check a local library for them.  I may, in fact, donate my sets, as I'm not sure I could stand watching them again.

P.S.  Amazon, FFS, keep the different media and edition review sections SEPARATE!",1491609600,,1772,4.778877887788779

Mine was so delicate,the thin ""sleeve"" even ripped the box slightly when separated!
Even the discs seem a bit lower quality printed faces, with barely readable and dim, not as bright colored as the past seasons!

In July, the 7th season will be starting and I will be on the hunt to purchase those episodes.  Sigh, there are only going to be 7 episodes instead of the normal 10, and season 8, the final season will only have 6 episodes.  Can you tell I'm a fan?

Also, although I thoroughly enjoyed it of course, this season really wasn't as good as the others.
Maybe that's why they chose to wrap it in crappy cheap container?

Which major characters will die this season and which ""dead"" characters return? Don't expect it all to make sense, just enjoy the most amazing locations and scenery you could ever imagine. GAME OF THRONES tops any high budget movie for its effects.

I've watched all 6 seasons and still can't name all the characters and make sense of all the battles and wars and betrayals but somehow , it just does not matter. It's the GAME OF THRONES with best cast and crew every assembled. Always be prepared for anything at anytime. Nothing and no one is sacred.

7772972,1,B01H2JPTDO,"I finally got around to watching my DVDs, and the last disk is unreadable.  I sure wish I had watched these earlier, it seems that now is too late to return them.  Is mine the only faulty pressing, or is this a common problem, I wonder?

Subsequent update: Amazon allowed me to return the originals and they shipped a replacement set.  (Thank you, Amazon).  But the replacement has the same problem as the first set.  I've read a lot of other reviews complaining about the quality of this DVD set.  Horrible.  Not happy at all.",1488067200,10,527,4.473684210526316

7772987,3,B01H2JPTDO,I was very confused because I had already watched dvd of season 5. So 6 had many of the same scenes with slight or major changes.

7773006,5,B01H2JPTDO,The show seems to be finally pulling plot lines together.  Some story lines went on long pointless detours.  Of course life can be that way sometimes so I guess thst is acceptable but it felt like a waste.  Overall obviously still liking it.,1487376000,,241,4.558139534883721

7773183,3,B01H2JPTDO,"Better than nothing, but overall the quality of the series is falling steadily starting with season 5. I will omit entirely the line of Dorne and utterly different Pr. Doran (who in book was shown as physically weak, but cautious, super smart and intelligent Ruler. It was impossible for him to be killed by such small characters as in Show. They were furious and cunning, but these qualities are obviously do not make for an obvious want of intelligence, broad perspective, cold calculation, understanding of people and situations and strategic planning).

Sansa. Why nobody asks how it was at all possible for Her to mary Bolton when her husband Tyrion was alife? ))))))))))))) This is just laughable.
She was not able to bring Noth to anybody until Tyrion was alife. Additionally I did not hear any news about dissolution of her marriage. The mere fact  that she did not sleep with Tyrion is not enough to automatically dissolve such high-profied marriage. I allow it was possible to try to start the process of dissolving, examination of Sansa proving she was virgin, etc. But in show all these ""mere formalities"" were simply ignored. It is also funny how Sansa (using the usual Sansa logic) let her army to be extinguished by Bolton leaving only Littlefinger's forces in Winterfell. (the amount of survivors from John's army is so small, that they can do nothing if Littlefinger decides to crush them). It is just superclever of her to put herself again into situation where neither she, no her kin can do a thing, while Littlefinger (most trusted man )))) ) holds everything under control. Oh, she says she distrusts him? This is nice. But she should have thought of it earlier. Uniting with Littlefinger Before the battle would leave her with Stark's strong army, and the victory would not be so costly.
Eh. I suppose, the makers of the show will merely ignore all this in future by creating some other unrealistic line of events.
Aria. Dirk in the bowels is a sure death without highly qualified and modern medicine. If they wanted to show that her brief fever was the only consequence then they should name her Wolverene from X-men.",1485820800,,2141,4.815217391304348

7773236,1,B01H2JPTDO,"Review is based on box set not on show. This is a lousy attempt of a box set compared to the rest of the seasons. HBO literally gave us half the box they normally do. I hate the stupid 3D cover it doesn't even work as a 3D piece because that specific artwork was never made to be 3D... so they spent MORE money to slap a 3D sticker on the front panel rather than just printing on the actual cardboard it looks really cheaply done. Also, the sleeve they include is half of a sleeve... they have never done that in the 5 seasons of the show so why start now. The fact that HBO is cutting corners on their biggest show this late in the game is quite simply sad and insulting to the fans who actually buy their show instead of pirating it.",1485648000,4,735,4.041095890410959
7773237,4,B01H2JPTDO,"Much as I appreciate the need to end multiple stories with something, the final season and last episode leave more to wonder about than to be satisfied.

7773250,5,B01H2JPTDO,"Season 6 of Game of Thrones is easily the best so far. Old scores get settled, new alliances are made and we finally learn how the White Walkers came to be. Season 6 now has us ready for the climax (hopefully?) of Martin's fantasy epic. Westeros is facing two invasions and the question is can the various factions survive them?

One of GoTh's strengths is that we see the world from the eyes of the mighty and from the eyes of the ordinary folk trying to survive and prosper on a day to day basis. While Cersei Lannister and her brother scheme to retain the throne, Sam and Gilly and their baby just try to find a safe place to live their lives. Also, characters that we initially disliked turn out to have more depth and decency than we first imagined, just like real people. Admit it, didn't we all hate the Hound at first? Now he's a rough and ready adventurer with his own simple code of justice that causes him to avenge villagers who were massacred by outlaws.

There are enough unresolved questions to keep Season 7 moving forward. Will Cersei and Jaime avenge their daughter's murder? Will the Mother of Dragons pillage Westeros in her quest for the throne? Will the alliance of the Wildings and Night's Watch be able to hold off the White Walkers? Will Tryion Lannister ever find happiness? Is Sansa Stark going to end up as a surrogate lover for Lord Bayliss? Will Arys keep killing people on her list? Will HBO release new merchandise for us? The list goes on.

If Season 6 has shown us anything, it is that heroic fantasy is as entertaining as any prime time soap opera could hope to be.",1485561600,,1600,4.453924914675768

7773362,3,B01H2JPTDO,"Honestly people!  It is easy to see that George R. R. Martin has left the building.  The writing is not up to par and does not do this series of books justice.  Having said that, I will follow the TV version to the end because it may be the only ending we get.  Mr. Martin did such a fabulous job with the first few books but with no new books to wrap this up I am at the mercy of the screen writers.  I hope that the success of these books turned TV series will get networks interested into looking at some other fantastic book series available such as the Wheel of Time series and others.",1485129600,,590,4.051724137931035

I do not know how people who have not read the books can follow this very, very dense story.  There are so many characters, plots, subplots, agendas, locations.  Even having read the books, it is often difficult to follow.  The HBO series has now gone beyond the story in the books, which are as yet unfinished and likely to remain so.  I guess that means we are all in the same boat as to following the tale.

I wish the DVDs were released sooner each season since they are far cheaper that subscribing to HBO which seems to have little else in which I am interested.",1484697600,,627,4.271186440677966

The packaging of this product is absolutely garbage. Earlier seasons were beautifully designed with character art and sturdy long-lasting construction. This has been reduced to cheap plastic with no art slip over the box. The discs are arranged poorly in a stacked configuration. Honestly I am surprised HBO has designed/allowed such cost-cutting measures on their most popular show.

I'd be embarrassed to put out such a poor quality product - I hope in the future they upgrade this design. These are collector's items to a lot of people (myself included) and I just don't feel like this is worth owning.",1484697600,,680,4.803418803418803

7773486,5,B01H2JPTDO,"This is the greatest thing on television, right now!  This is an epic season with so many memorable scenes and episodes.  An unbelievable story with characters that leap off the screen with the majestic performances by the actors and actresses performing them.  Bran is back in the mix, and a major player in this season, providing the audience with some past insight through his visions with the Three-Eyed-Raven.  After the dramatic ending of Season Five, we are finally privy to the fate of Jon Snow.  Tyrion again is great this season with Peter Dinklage's performance always on point.  Sansa shows her transformation into a weak girl to a strong woman.  There is also the return of quite a few characters thought to be dead, and, it would seem, the most deaths of any season to date.  Just an amazing collection of episodes with two of he most epic finales I can remember of any show.  Simply magnificent!",1484524800,,910,4.745222929936306

7773515,3,B01H2JPTDO,"I LOVE THE MOVIE!!!I I own the complete series Season#1, thru Season 6. My problem is the THE CASE SUCKS BIGTIME. For the amount of money requested to purchase the DVD, you would think the company would place the disc in a case to protect the disc. It's obvious the producer or distributor of this case was only thinking of future profits., The case started falling apart immediatly after the first opening.(the plastic disc holder separated from the outer cover). The overlay stacking of the disc is a horrible Idea which means removing the disc from the holder may cause damage to disc itself. Damaging the disc means a dedicated collector of G.O.T. would have to purchase the entire set to replace the damaged disc. The distributor should have placed these disc in a dedicated and Protected 4 disc blu-ray case (like the one I purchased to protect my disc.) instead of the cheaply made case that season six is distributed in. Making this exchange in the packaging may increase the cost of the product.but with a changed outer disc cover would protect the disc from unnecessary damaged.

Is it really possible that the dolt who thought this up is paid for his efforts? Absolutely astonishing indifference to the buyer's convenience. You can get around it, once you manage to get all of the discs out, by using small CD/DVD sleeves, available elsewhere on Amazon, for two of the discs.

7773597,2,B01H2JPTDO,"Hey guys! Let's talk about Season 6 of Game Of Thrones for a moment.

If you look through my review list, you'll see I've only reviewed one of the seasons prior to this one. That's fine, I will tell you what you need to know in one review. I hope that this guide helps you decide whether to buy this season or not.

If you're looking at this page, chances are that you're already a fan of the series and have already bought season 1-5, and chances are you're looking to buy this one as well. I strongly urge you to choose a different platform to buy this from. i know it's a hassle these days, but do not buy this online, go to the store and buy a copy, and here's why.

For whatever reason the dvds and blue-rays from every season, including the current one, have a chance of housing defective discs. Search google and you'll find that every single season has had this issue, and season 6, I'm sad to say, is no different. Every season that I've bought has had one or more discs that were problematic. Some times it would only be one or two episodes out of the entire set, some times it would be worse.  Season 3 was a nightmare, as I had to go through 3 boxes in order to find one that worked properly, the first having all but 2 episodes fail to play.

This time, it was only one episode, Battle Of The Bastards.

Now, if you go to google, you'll see that some of these issues might be fixable on your end. Either its film stuck on the disc that needs to be cleaned off, or, updating video drivers or video play back software. But, none of this has ever worked for me. Looking over the disc, there's no signs of damage, no scratches, nothing outwardly apparent that the disc is damaged or defective at all. The only way you can really tell is to sit down and watch, and about 20 minutes into the episode on my disc, the video player stops playing then goes back to the dvd's menu. I tried it a moist towlet, and wiped it with a microfiber cloth. It would still stop at the 20 minute mark, but then it would just close out of the dvd entirely.

I don't know if this issue stems from shoddy dvd imprinting, low-quality materials used in manufacturing, or what, but I've had this same issue happen on multiple platforms, across every boxset I've bought. I've had to replace every one of them multiple times before finding boxsets that actually worked. And now I have to do the same thing again.

It baffles me how HBO could continue to let this problem persist for so long considering just how much money Game Of Thrones is bringing them in, and it's frankly disappointing.

The series is a great fantasy series, equal parts realism and high fantasy. The acting and writing are top notch. I only wish that the final product (the dvd/blu-ray) was of the same quality. Buy this in stores, so that you can keep your receipt in case you find yourself with a defective set, like I did. At least then you can try your luck at another set in hopes of finding a non-defective boxset, or you can get a full-refund without having to deduct the cost of shipping it back to amazon from said refund.",1484006400,,3086,4.29776247848537

7773659,5,B01H2JPTDO,This season is excellent. I have watched all of the previous seasons and I am still enthralled. It may be my imagination but season 5 and even more so 6 seem very well/ succinctly written. The characters are sure of themselves. The primary characters are almost all giving very strong performances. This is a story with huge scope and I think there is much still to be told. dg,1483920000,,377,4.478260869565218

7773661,5,B01H2JPTDO,"Finally! Maybe we had to go through five seasons of buildup to hit a home run but, boy oh boy, after the sloth-like movement of the multiple storylines through those five seasons, Game Of Thrones takes off in season six. It also takes off way sooner as everything starts really happening from Episode Four onwards (usually, we have to get to Episode Seven or Eight before we get the real drama). Even the Wall and Winterfell storylines finally are not so depressing and dull as the darkness that surrounds Jon Snow because, thankfully, (SPOILER ALERT) Sansa Stark starts sowing her combat oats.

The extras on the DVD oddly are not as good as ones in previous seasons, but who cares really? Season Six is THAT good. Honestly, watch it On Demand vs. buying the DVDs this time around. My cable TV service had all the extras On Demand so you don't really lose out.

Just for those interested in the extras, there's a lot on the cameramen, prosthetics, the cave scene and other visual effects as well as the usual behind-the-scenes look at the big battle for that season. Plus there is a sort of doubling down on the insider looks with an episode-by-episode ""Game Revealed"" which I found a bit too samey.",1483920000,,1200,4.629107981220657

You will love Game of Thones if you like fantasy and a very intriguing story with lots of twists and turns, often unpredictable.  You need to be able to tolerate some violence and occasional sexual scenes...not for children.  My adult daughter got me started on this series.  I watched Season One, Episode One, and I was totally confused, and put the Blu Rays aside for a couple of months.  Then I went back and watched episode Two, and began to figure it out and was hooked.  So give it a try, but you need to start with Season One to be able to understand the whole story.",1483920000,,646,4.38655462184874

7773668,5,B01H2JPTDO,"The video and audio are solid, as usual. The best season of the series to be sure. Episode 5, ""The Door"" is an instant classic, and best of the series. (The final two episodes are stunning as well.) Excellence in direction, acting, pacing, and cinematography. The one fault here is, sadly the commentaries. Most of them are silly, to the point where you wonder if the actors are being contractually forced to do them. There are many questions to be asked about character and acting journeys. Questions that were not asked here (or in the previous season.) Commentaries for this show should be moderated. A passionate fan or even an actor from another show could help draw out shooting, production, and acting challenges. If left to chance, things could devolve into a giggle-fest. This is reviewed viewing for fantasy and drama, but skip the commentaries. (The ""Lord of The Rings"" extended editions show the power of great un-moderated commentaries.) A classic season, with quality to match Battlestar Galactica 1st season, and the 5th season of ""Lost.""",1483920000,5,1053,4.988636363636363

I was a bit concerned as the show's storyline has now passed the events chronicled in the books and the writers are in uncharted territory.  Glad to say there was no drop in the quality of the story, and naturally the acting, sets, and directing remain top-notch.

If you had any doubts about staying with it, be reassured it's still great.",1483920000,2,413,4.407894736842105

It's been a few years since I read the books by this writer and I remember having to wait for the publication of each one of them.  I took the entire weekend and watched all six seasons at once which I would recommend to anyone who watches this series. It truly is worth it.  I did not think they could actually stretch this thing out as long as they did and still remain true to the story but they have managed to do just that and more. Season seven?  Well, we are just going to have to wait and see just how many seasons they can milk this cow for without producing some really bad eps.  Hopefully, things will remain that are needed like camera work and production and cast quality without the storyline becoming boring or trite and predictable. Season eight and beyond? That depends on the producer's willingness to pay the price for success which will no doubt rise accordingly.  Good luck to all involved with the series and may all the fans of this epic story not be disappointed when it comes to an end.",1483833600,,1200,4.45662100456621

I applaud HBO for taking the reins of finishing the Game because as brilliant as he is, I have wondered if GRR Martin really knew how to end his meandering masterpiece. Arya's arc is fascinating, but it could also be a stand alone novel/series. Just when we thought we were released from the diabolic clutches of Joffery, RAMSAY walks in and he is worse!!!
Overall regardless of family or banner or words or temperament, those who survive adversity grow stronger.  It can only disappoint me if it becomes too predictable; I think it has drawn its worldwide audience by its sudden switchback twists and changes...

The content is excellent, special features are a little less than previous years but after 6 seasons you can only do so many interviews with cast and crew and locations.

This last season they obvioulsy  changed the company they use for packaging, there are no inserts, the paper quality is low, the dvd's are thinner, even the menu and digital media are substandard.  The show itself lacks any dialogue or interest this season, it is lacking in story and relies on effects, scenery and existing storyline, they are riding the wave and saving money. The extras do not include actors or directors perspective.  It is obvious they are just wasting time to keep us hooked until the last season. Sad. Integrity and quality is gone.

It is like thirteen year old males  were given the writing jobs this season.  One liners, excess blood and guts, special effects, no witty banter, no intricate story line or dialouge. A waste of great actors skills.",1483488000,6,905,4.806451612903226

7773787,5,B01H2JPTDO,"Before I finally started watching this series, I didn't think I'd like it because, as I've grown older (55+), my tastes have leaned more toward story lines that were plausible--basically; more young adult (or nerdy teenager) fantasy BS that I'd spend a short amount of time rolling my eyes and thinking ""oh, brother..."" before I switched to something else at least a little more believable. Man, was I surprised...then hooked; I couldn't stop watching and, in about 2 weeks time, I'd watched all 6 seasons. It was really well done and, though I wouldn't let the younger members of the family watch it (it's pretty graphic), I recommend it.",1483401600,14,639,4.871559633027523

I see the ultimate battle coming between the ice demons and the dragons, with the dragons saving humanity at some point in the future. Other than that I am losing interest in this series. The only thing worse than killing off all the heroes is bringing them back to life. GOT has also stooped to a new low in depravity. Burning a little girl at a stake at the behest of her father, as a sacrifice, in front of his wife and army was over the top in disgusting filming.

Whatever glue they used to fix the tray to the sleeve didn't hold and fell off the moment I opened it up. I actually thought maybe I had bought some Chinese knockoff or bargain version. Next time if they want to use cheap packaging just use a regular blu-ray case please.

7773896,1,B01H2JPTDO,"Don't know what happened. Pre-ordered the DVD set, and due to other circumstances could not watch til now. NONE of the discs will show scenes. Each one will go through the set up features. I do use cc, so I always am setting up on the subtitle screen. When selecting the resume play NOTHING happens. At first I thought my remote batteries were low, so I changed them. I tried a totally different disc for exercising. Works perfectly. Back to GOT: not one of the discs will play. I am returning, and it seems the seller will actually send a new set, if the packaging has been opened. Never, Ever have I had this happen. Hope the new issue is ok. I will update the review if a I receive a good copy.

Jan. 2017. Received 2nd copy to replace original purchase 11-15-16.  This set is doing EXACTLY the same thing: NOTHING is playing! The episode screen will appear, and I can run subtitles, but the movie does not play. I'm looking at a still picture of Tyrion.  Can't tell you how disappointed I am. It's a lot of trouble to return!

7773987,4,B01H2JPTDO,"This was the best season. The action sequence in the battle of the bastards was amazing. Most of the John Snow related sequences were good, some very good. There was plenty of time spent on Daenerys and Tyrion, two of my favorite characters. The John Snow sequence at the beginning of season was slow going. If it had been done well, it would have been very dramatic. Too much coverage of Aria Stark and whole waif/training sequence. I didn't care for it. It was uninteresting.  I passed right over most of it. And, it brought my rating down. I tried to critique without giving away any spoilers. Sorry, if I said too much. Overall, very good. And, it left me wanting more. I can't wait for next season.",1482710400,,703,4.4921875
7773988,3,B01H2JPTDO,"Seems to be a little slow, I think that the best way  to watch this is to binge watch it from beginning to end once the final season is over,it's a little to complex to watch occasionally Lots of characters and plot lines",1482710400,,221,4.1395348837209305

7773990,5,B01H2JPTDO,"I finally had an opportunity to witness season 6. The beginning of the end of several flaying plot threads are now coalescing and tying themselves into single lines. There is a sense of convergence upon the land of the Seven Kingdoms. Some of the leading nastier players are being sidelined, brutally eliminated(Bolton), and the long-term sufferers, but righteous are moving to the forefront and gaining stature and leadership. So, a culmination is definitely in the works for season 7.",1482710400,,486,5.1645569620253164

7773999,4,B01H2JPTDO,"I purchased this set of 5 discs a month ago.  The first 4 discs worked perfectly, but disc #5 refused to play one episode so I returned it to amazon for replacement.  I dropped 1 star only because disc #5 was obviously defective - in fact I could see it was bad just by looking at the reverse side and noting that it had variations in color reflectivity, whereas the other good discs had perfectly uniform optical reflectivity.  Too bad the maker did not just take a look at these discs during final quality-control checks. Yes, I know it is cheaper to let the customer buy a bad disc and return it, rather than pay a bunch of quality checkers to find the bad ones before shipping.  However I must praise amazon for making the return very easy and sending me a post-paid return label so I could just put it out in my mailbox for pickup and not have to spend a half-hour standing in line at the post office.",1482710400,4,906,4.280701754385965

7774047,3,B01H2JPTDO,"Clearly I'm not the only person disappointed with the packaging, but I'm honestly a little confused by it. Whenever I took off of the paper/cardboard slip cover that I assumed was supposed to be taken off (?) and then thrown away, the entire little board with the hall of faces came off as well. Is that supposed to happen, or am I just another unlucky customer with an even cheaper version of the already cheap packaging? If anyone knows the answer please tell! Without the hall of faces cover, the casing is plain white with nothing on it, so it's even more unappealing than it already was.

I've yet to have the chance to check the quality of the audio or video, but I'm sure there's no problems there. And of course the actual content of the plot is beautiful and ensnaring as always, I'm just very upset with the packaging. I expect more from the most popular show on television.",1482537600,,884,4.490683229813665

Many will call this series the epitome of its genre for a long time to come.  I have also read the books and don't find the differences significant.  I can appreciate the difficulty in translating the written word to the visual interpretation and believe it was done superbly.

7774190,5,B01H2JPTDO,"For those of you with lives, move on.  I am a ""professional"" bingewatcher, one of those insufferable aging crones who can afford to sit in front of the big screen for a week streaming movies, eating healthy, while working out on the home gym all day.  If I am going to buy the disk, I ""collect it"" after I stream it.  Instead of waiting for another two seasons to stream the entire thing, I broke tradition because it looks like this show could go on for 8 years.  It's getting to the point where I am racing my own grim reaper.

Which means of course, that as of XMAS 2016, the whole six years are available to stream.

First this has got to be the most expensive TV series made, it's motion picture quality, at $6-$10 an episode, each season is a 10 hour $80 million dollar movie and it shows.  There are Brits in leads galore, and anybody who watches British actors and scyfy fantasy knows, Brits consider this kind of fantasy real art, they throw the kitchen sink at it.  Think Hammer in the early 70's but with a budget with multi layered special effects that you only see in the theater.  And literally a cast of thousands, and I am not talking extras.  And these actors are magnificent in what they deliver, and all that much and weather, a lot real and not special effects, means the crew making this movie are busting their chops a lot of the time, and not snuggled in some lot doing green screen rear projection.  Think an 8 year series projected costing close to a billion dollars.

This is also soft porn.  My friends who'd come over to watch used to play a drinking game called ""tushee"" where they'd call out the moment somebody showed tush.  We abandoned the game on this show, for we'd be too drunk in an a few episodes to get to the end of the episode, let alone a season.  There's lots of male and female frontal nudity, and it is not always in support of the plot line.  This isn't Harry Potter kids.

Then there is the old saw about rating violence R but always rating nudity worse.  You don't have to choose here.  You get plenty of both.  Not to mention the visuals, they are spectacular, but the Foley (sound man) has a field day with squooshy sounds that indicate stabbing--they get kind of boring, the same old squoosh episode after episode.  Lots of blood and severed limbs, floating entrails, a favorite seems to be a neck wound and the victim drowning and spitting up his own blood.

For those of you with real lives, I feel badly you have to wait a week for the next season and plod through, but I shall be joining you to torture myself one show at a time season 7.

I will try not to expire before last season projected 2018.

And by that XMAS, they should have one box set to cover all eight seasons, all the kinks worked out.",1481760000,2,2756,4.317120622568093

7774216,2,B01H2JPTDO,"I have to say that I am extremely disappointed in the quality of this release. I have bought all of the first five seasons on Blu-ray (the US editions) and each one of them have been fantastic both in content and physical packaging.

This time however, the packaging used for season six is considerably cheaper and lower in quality than before. All of the earlier season box sets had some sort of booklet and/or poster included in them. This time there's no booklet nor poster. All of the earlier season box sets also had individual disc holder pages inside the Blu-ray digipack packaging whereas this time two discs are stacked on top of each other. And finally, the slipcover design is awful and impractical: previously there were always two slipcovers included. The first one was a cardboard slipcover that included basic information of the disc contents etc., which was more or less disposable and it wasn't supposed to be held on while the box set was put on shelf for display. The other slipcover was for display purposes and each one of them were beautiful. On the sixth season, both of the slipcovers are merged into one and it both looks awkward and is impractical like I stated before. This release is also not cohesive stylistically when compared to the older box sets due to the reasons I stated above. It's never good when any series' season box sets aren't coherent with each other and the design gets suddenly changed as the series progresses.

I'm not expecting this feedback to have any sort of impact, as these Blu-rays will most likely sell like hot cakes as GoT is the most popular TV show in the world (rightfully so), but I still wanted to express my disappointment with this product. The production values have obviously been considerably toned down and it is cheaply made. HBO wants to make more money, I get it, but it is still sad to see that the most popular TV show in the world gets a sub-par, cheaply made release that is inferior to the previous season box sets.

I did a few comparison photos with the season five box set to better demonstrate the difference in quality.",1481587200,57,2102,4.645161290322581

The entire GAME in GoT is to SURVIVE AND WIN.  That is what makes death scenes so riveting and powerful. Season 6 BREAKS THE RULES and inadvertently ruins the magic as a result.  I tried to watch every episode, but truthfully, I lost interest very early on.  I suspect most of the original fans have too.  It's been said that George R.R. Martin cut himself loose of the HBO series after Season 5 ended.  Watching this, his absence is all the more obvious.  GoT should have ended at Season 5, if not earlier.  Just goes to show...the series wasn't created for the love of storytelling; it was recognized as a potential Cash Cow and, believe me...HBO will milk this for all it's worth.",1481500800,2,828,4.54054054054054

I've tried to look for info on other forums but haven't seen any discussion on the picture quality lacking from scene to scene and I even exchanged my Blu-ray thinking maybe the disc was faulty but the same thing happened.

Why change a successful marketing strategy?  Apparently to save 35 cents profit per unit under an assumption I'll buy it anyway...WRONG.  I'm returning my copy.  I get that the electronics market has changed over the past several years, but it is pretty dumb to piss off your customer base by delivering an inferior product as part 6 in an 8-9 year delivery cycle.

Some horrendous things happen and as always, theres several major surprises. People continue to make mistakes for which they pay dearly for. By the end, the world of GOT looks quite different.

If you're only looking for a review of the show than I would give this a 5 star review.  This whole series is amazing.  Watch it from the beginning.

I wanted to write this review on the product alone.  I was incredibly disappointed this year with the poor quality of this DVD/Blu-Ray cover.  One of the things that makes this product worth buying is the beautiful detail that goes into the covers each year.  The fold out nicely, have great pictures, and each disc has its own section.  Season six's pack feels like an incredible rip off in comparison.  The set is much smaller and there are two discs to a section now.  It looks ridiculous next to the other seasons, and makes me regret having bought it in the first place.  It doesn't feel worth spending the money on something when it's not even nice and I can watch it on HBO Go at anytime.",1481068800,4,994,4.342391304347826

7774351,4,B01H2JPTDO,"Westeros remains engulfed by banditry and political turmoil. In King's Landing the Faith of the Seven has gained tremendous power and inflicted moral shame even on Cersei Lannister, the Queen Regent. A new age of religious dominance seems nigh in Westeros. Far across the sea, Daenerys Targaryen has disappeared from the city of Meereen, leaving Tyrion Lannister in reluctant control of a deterioating situation. For Daenerys, she once again finds herself a guest of the Dothraki and having to navigate their customs for her own advantage. But in Westeros itself the true threat comes from beyond the Wall, as the Night's King and his White Walkers march...and the only person willing to stand against them has been betrayed and murdered by his own followers.

The fifth season of Game of Thrones was its worst, saved from mediocrity by the penultimate episode Hardhome which completely raised the bar for the show in terms of dramatic power, visual effects and small-screen myth-making. For a show which, for four previous seasons, had always been an effective and satisfying slice of drama (if still running a distant second to the novels in terms of characterisation and satisfying political drama), the fifth was a major let-down, reportedly the result of the producers not knowing how many episodes they had left to tell the story and the confusion caused by adapting elements from George R.R. Martin's novels whilst also outpacing them.

The sixth season is, thankfully, vastly superior to the fifth. It is has a sense of purpose and relentlessness which has been missing for a while, as well as a willingness to seed major moments amongst almost all of the episodes rather than holding back the best for last. This isn't to say that it's all plain sailing. Arya spends too long getting beaten up on the streets of Braavos before finally doing something about it. Bran's crucial, fan theory-confirming visions are doled out excruciatingly slowly (and in a contrived manner) over the course of the whole season. Sam and Gilly have so little to do that it may have been better to have pulled a Bran and rested them for a year. For the second season in a row we're set up a very promising Brienne storyline that then goes nowhere fast. And, as thrilling as seeing Daenerys humble the Dothraki is, it's also a redundant repeat of what she already did five years ago.

The biggest and most continuous problem through the season, and one I suspect we will see going forwards, is the absence of George R.R. Martin's dialogue. Benioff and Weiss are - when on their game - effective plotters and sometimes quite clever in how they reframe the source material to work in 60-minute chunks with far fewer characters and locations to call upon, but their original dialogue is frequently clunky. With no novels left to adapt, the opportunity to use Martin's dialogue in-situ is largely gone and they have to fall back on their own material, which is much more variable. There's also major issues with portraying the passage of time (most notably Gilly's still-too-young baby, who should be a three or four-year-old by now) and characters teleporting around the map with no thought for plausibility.

But elsewhere the show does better. Extending pain and misery across eight seasons without surcease would have been rather depressing, so after the mostly dark and defeat-shrouded fifth season the sixth gives us a huge number of victories. Major storylines are closed down, most of the major villains are defeated and the ""good guys"" (or, in some cases, maybe ""least-worst bad guys"") are on the rise. Particularly interesting, especially after the claims of misogyny laid against the show in prior seasons, is how the sixth year sees women rising to power right across the board: Cersei, Daenerys, Yara Greyjoy, the Sand Snakes of Dorne, Sansa, Arya, Lady Mormont (this year's break-out character bar none) and more.

The question of whether the sixth season would spoil the final two books has also been answered by the TV show going off in a completely different direction in numerous storylines. The only areas where the show does spoil the books is by confirming fairly blatantly obvious theories (about both Jon's birth and his fate) that even GRRM doesn't strenuously deny any more. Those things that are spoiled seem to be fairly minor - such as the origin of Hodor's name - but I suspect the true spoilers will come in the next two seasons.

Although the sixth season paces major plot movements and developments over its whole length, it does spin some wheels in the latter part of the season and the season premiere is probably the weakest they've ever delivered. But other episodes are extremely strong, such as Oathbreaker, The Door and, especially, the finale.

Perhaps the most disappointing episode of the season is the penultimate one. We were promised a jaw-dropping, amazing field battle sequence and didn't entirely get what was promised. The battlefield tactics were a horrendous mess that didn't make sense, Jon Snow's military acumen is non-existent (the handy strategist who held the Wall against Mance Rayder has gone AWOL) and Sansa witholds vitally important tactical information on reinforcements for absolutely no discernible reason. Yes, seeing the end of Ramsay Bolton is highly satisfying, but the way it was reached was contrived to the point of incoherence.

Vastly superior is the season finale, easily the best they have ever done and a strong contender for best episode of the entire series. Some plot developments were predictable, but seeing one character sweep the board clean of their enemies in one swift movement and be established as the show's final human villain of consequence is immensely satisfying, especially as it is set to Ramin Djawadi's finest musical work since the first season. Bringing in new bad guys can be fun, but returning to the very first one and seeing them gain an immense amount of new power and prestige is even more satisfying. It was a delicious moment, if undermined by the fact that their enemies outnumber and outflank them on such a scale that their defeat is inevitable. But that's for next season to worry about.

But of course the killer moment of the finale was the revelation that one of the longest-held fan theories about the books, one that was discussed on nascent internet message boards as early as 1996, was true. By now it was all but certain it was true, but the scene still delivers a powerful emotional kick. Special kudos to Robert Aramayo who played the young Eddard Stark so convincingly in flashbacks. Although a ""Robet's Rebellion"" prequel series has been ruled out by George R.R. Martin (who has the rights to it and is not minded to sell them), if HBO ever do talk him around it'd be great to perhaps see Aramayo in the role again.

Overall, the sixth season of Game of Thrones executes some much-needed damage control after the problems of the fifth season to deliver a much more interesting set of stories. There are still weaknesses in worldbuilding, dialogue, characterisation and how it handles military matters, but the show has developed a renewed sense of purpose and focus as the final end of the show comes into view.",1481068800,,7216,4.936573311367381

Personally, I have not read the novels but my husband has read the entire series A Song of Ice and Fire.

7774418,4,B01H2JPTDO,"For me again I didn't think this season was quite up to the standard of the initial four seasons.  Like with Season 5, we have a lot of treading water so to speak episodes before we get to the action in the final two.  That action looked spectacular (and if your DVD set comes with the extra The War of the Bastards, you can see there was a lot of thought, time and effort put into that episode.  But before we got there really the only highlight without giving anything away was the temple scene, and the same thing was done in one of the earlier seasons, and was done better then.  Its sort of like this season knows where the storyline is going to end up in the next or season after that, and we're just stretching out the show until then.

On the plus side, at least they finally realised how stupid it was to wait so long to release season 5 on DVD that we already knew who was still around and major plot points that happened because they were already promoting this season.  Although obviously a major spoiler in the first three episodes was already out there, but that's down to selfish people giving away spoilers online, but you can't really fault whoever owns the rights to the DVDs for that.  But accolades for listening to disgruntled DVD purchaser fans and fixing the lengthy release time problem.  The major spoiler was the only real blindside of this season as well.  What made previous seasons great was stuff you never saw coming, including main characters getting killed, but  Season 6 stage, you can pretty much work out whose going to be around until the final season.  If for no other reason than to keep merchandise sales going.

I did like the town street theatre play which was making fun of recent history (ie the previous seasons of Game of Thrones), it was a nice recap and well done.  But really I don't see myself revisiting much except the final two episodes.",1480291200,,1890,4.459302325581396

There is no glue holding the top part of the plastic bluray housing inside the flimsy cardboard case. The fact that we are still charged the same price as past seasons, but are being provided with horrid quality packaging is despicable. They are definitely pocketing some extra cash this year. There is no way these blu rays will remain unscratched over the years. To whoever may be reading this: If I were you, I'd wait until they release a complete set. The packing is bound to be better than this piece of junk. So disappointed in HBO for this.",1480291200,3,650,4.564102564102564
7774427,4,B01H2JPTDO,"This is the sort of item that definitely needs two sets of stars; one for video/sound quality and one for packaging and extras quality.  For sound and video quality I would have added, if possible, an additional 3 stars as both were uniformly fantastic from beginning to end.

 For the packaging, about a 2.  As other reviewers have noted it is of very low quality.  Compared to previous releases it is the poor ugly sister indeed.  Could this be HBOs way of recouping some of the cost of the spectacular ""Battle of the Bastards"" episode?  The disc storage is ridiculous and hard to use.  The black face and small print on the discs makes it impossible to read without a bright light.  I now keep a penlight near my blu ray player.

I would have given the disc extras a 5 if the menu was not so cumbersome and non intuitive to use.  I either have a defective set of discs or am missing a step in the overly complicated menu because I have been able to watch all the extras except the episodes with commentary.  I kept trying and trying to find the right menu clicks to get to the commentary tracks but finally gave up in frustration.  It is particularly irrating because the commentaries are one of my favorite goodies after the episodes themselves.  If anyone out there can help me navigate that *&#!!% menu for the commentaries, PLEASE tell me how!!

They're pretty terrible, unless listening to people eat while talking is your thing, it's annoying and they repeat loads from last year - did you know Liam Cunningham was in Hunger? Yes, last years commentary you suggested it!!
The show itself gets 5 stars, the quality is jut amazing but if you're out for the extras, eh, good stuff but nothing exciting that they didn't already dump on YouTube, so hard to give this a huge recommendation.
Of course if it's for your collection, it's a buy. If you just want the episodes, see if there's a cheaper alternative.

I could only view the introductory scenes (which keep repeating itself) with music and nothing else on all 4 discs. There isn't any main menu or pop up menu for me to access not matter how hard I tried. I assume something has gone wrong in the production process.

For whatever reason, my pre-ordered copy of GoT S6 was defective and became a comedy of errors in trying to binge watch it; every disc skipped, badly. But I requested a replacement and I had my new, perfect copy in 2.5 days. Mind=blown. I binge-watched that to make sure it was a good copy. It was and I printed off the return label and Boom! Done. I expected such a hassle and it just wasn't. So, way to go, Amazon. Again.",1480118400,,512,4.34375
7774443,3,B01H2JPTDO,"The main reason why I wait for the physical release for Game of Thrones is due to the exceptional packaging the seasons would come in. Seasons one through five all had strong, sturdy and visually appealing packaging that felt worth the cost and wait for the physical release. This however has changed with season six for the worse. Previous seasons all had their discs in separate holders and they were easy to retrieve and put away. Season 6's packaging comes with the discs stacked, which makes it difficult to take out and put away certain discs. I would have given this season fewer stars if it wasn't due to the fact that Game of Thrones is one of the best television series to date, so I will give HBO the benefit of the doubt with hope that they will return to making much better packaging for their products. If they don't, I won't even purchase the series any longer and just watch it someplace else.",1480118400,,909,4.515151515151516
7774444,4,B01H2JPTDO,"Would have given this 5 stars but the quality of the packaging is not up to the same quality as with previous seasons' blu-ray collection box sets. I only paid about $40 for this and that seems about right. After taking off the plastic wrapping, I then proceeded to take off the ""blu-ray"" outer layer carton. When I did this, the small amount of glue holding it to the main box caused a bit of the blue paper mach to tear off of it, leaving a very visible white blotch that is an eye-sore. Also, after taking the outer carton off and putting it back on (or else there is no ""Game of Thrones"" label on the cover and no visible ""feature list"" on the back), there is no way to keep the top flap from bending up away from the main box (other than forcefully bending it down so that it kind of holds in place later on). The disc holders are kind of annoying as well, as they are two 2-layer trays and not one page per disc as with previous box sets. I am a little disappointed, but ultimately what matters are the quality of the episodes and the bonus features, which are top-notch.",1480118400,9,1077,4.207729468599034

7774450,5,B01H2JPTDO,"The beginning of Game of Thrones was filled with a so many intriguing story lines cooked on a slow simmer, which kept viewers interested in the developing and often unexpected situations which many characters found themselves. The sixth season sees the intertwining of several story lines as the series is now set for a dramatic conclusion by season 8. There are many great episodes in this season, quite possibly the greatest twist of the series in the 5th episode ""Hold the Door"" and the epic ""Battle of the Bastards"" in episode 9. My only pressuring issue with this season is the slow simmer episodes have relied on throughout the seasons has accelerated with this season. I worry the writers will rush to the end of the series, but I will give them the benefit of the doubt and hope for the best with the last two seasons coming.

It's slimmer so looks odd next yo the other five seasons. Also from what I understand there is either no dust cover, again unlike the other five seasons that had very cool plastic ones, or it was this stupid paper one that I threw away thinking is was more silly packaging. It was something kind like opening a tome when you unfurled the past seasons and there was a sleeve for the booklets, again no booklet or even a sleeve for the digital copy.

This show has everything, from twists to turns to even that little instance where you say to yourself, ""I knew that would happen"" but are amazed at ""how"" it was played out. Literally, at every episode ending, I am left standing in awe with this feeling of needing to see the next episode and having to wait for the next one has become grueling. I believe GoT may be somewhat of an addiction! Love it!  Definately for Mature audiences, but GoT fans will love having this episode in their library.

7774499,4,B01H2JPTDO,So as we all know GOT is AMAZING! I have all the seasons that have come out thus far on dvd. I am excited to add this to my collection. I have played the first 2 discs through with no flaws at all. Same Great quality as all the other seasons. The complaints though on the dvd case though are very valid. I get the feeling they were looking for cost effective but also trying something different. The box that slides on is a cool idea but I can see it easily ripping if one is not careful. I don't mind how the dvd set up is within the case but the outer cover should have been improved. But hey GOT EVERYONE!!!! Enjoy this awesome show while it lasts.,1479600000,3,651,4.054263565891473

7774501,3,B01H2JPTDO,"First off, I will say that this season was great! It was by far my favorite season. I only marked it down because of the cheap packaging.
The previous season all had consistant quality in its packaging. They had a slip cover, a pocket for the episode guide and digital codes, each disc had is own tray and behind the trays was some artwork displaying a scene from the show then on the back of the box it always had the Iron Throne.
But this time, they went CHEAP. The slip cover was paper that is only held on by a dot of glue that tore a spot off the box when I removed it. You open it to find that the discs are layered to have 2 discs per tray. There is no pocket for the documentation and on the back of the box they replaced the Iron Throne with some text saying ""I AM NO ONE""
Honestly the only thing out of all the changes that bothers me is the cheap slip cover. If they had just spent the extra money and included a clear plastic cover with the title, like they did for season 5 then I would have given this review a 5 Star Rating.",1479600000,52,1039,3.9760765550239237
7774502,5,B01H2JPTDO,This is a great series. If you have not watched prior years I would suggest you do so in order to understand all happening in this season. All of the maneuvering going on to rule from the Iron Throne continues. The Mother of Dragons once again takes on adversity and gains control to take command of all those she rules. This means elimination of foes multiple times and control of her dragons. Jon Snow once again show how to fight battles and lead the north. His family is of course doing their share even if they are not working together. It is nice to see some of the people who have made many suffer and die receive some payback. The Lanister's are very busy in many ways taking control of as much as possible. One can not out guess just what happens to so many as the Seven Kingdoms are evolving. Next season will be as interesting as this one as everything slowly falls into place.,1479600000,,888,4.355421686746988

Hell, this is the first time a complaint about an HBO release at all, they've all been great, I'm talking about Band Of Brothers, The Pacific, Rome, Deadwood, Boardwalk Empire...

And yet I am conflicted: On the one hand the plots and twists are enjoyable to watch and its nice to witness how the apparent forces of good starts to launch a comeback. On the other hand I crave an ending, some sort of conclusion.

I can appreciate HBO not wanting to slaughter the golden calf, but the trouble with never ending shows, is that they risk overstaying their welcome and Game Of Thrones has started to do so - just a bit. At least with me. I find, I have become positively american in later years: The attentionspan of a nat.

So unless HBO finds some way of ending this gracefully and soon, I suspect I won't be around for the conclusion.

But I had to remove a star because of the packaging.
This time, the packaging is awful. Instead of having one disc per ""page"", we now have two discs kind of stacked on top of one another with a shoddy glue job holding the plastic pages to the package itself. They've removed the little pocket on the inside that holds papers so when you open the season, paper falls out everywhere (they're not too important, so they'll be thrown out eventually, I'm sure). Seems as if they went the cheap route on the packaging. It's frustrating overall, but just have to deal with it. I am a fan of the actual artwork, though!",1479340800,38,730,4.367647058823529

7774551,5,B01H2JPTDO,"Season 6 of HBOs epic series is what Game of Thrones fans, and arguably A Song of Ice and Fire fans have been waiting years for.  Things don't necessarily come full circle here, but certain story-lines and rumors finally start coming to fruition.  If you have been watching or reading anything GoT related, you need to buy this. This should already be in your amazon purchases list and playing in your Blu-Ray player (or playing on a stream device).

I don't want to say that season 6 is completely perfect. It does have some missteps, such as the disappointing Dorne and underwhelming Pyke side of the storylines. However, if something weird or book errors occur, something truly epic will mitigate the scenes. The good parts of this season do outweigh the bad ones. If you don't at least gasp in suspense or cheer happily at some scenes, you are not human. This show continues to be damn good. The production crews, writers, actors, and sound design teams for this show deserve every nominated Emmy.  Like the previous season releases, there are numerous bonus features that are fun to watch like the many making of documentaries from the various filming units at different locations around the globe. As always, HBO continues to include the much loved animated history of Westeros as well. The biggest difference to this product release compared to other season sets is the actual packaging. Its a bit smaller than before and how the blu-ray disc are held, Im not a big fan of. HBO is still doesnt want to include DVD versions with their seasons, but Im over it now. Im able to stream more anyway. I was able to redeem my digital copy among two streaming services easily like before.

Regardless of how you receive your product, this is the must buy and watch TV show of the year. Season 6 of Game of Thrones makes up for the emotional roller coaster of the previous, and serves as the beginning of the end for a truly epic series.",1479254400,4,1934,4.643274853801169

7774558,2,B01H2JPTDO,"Don't get me wrong, this is an amazing show that has quality acting and writing, as well as some superb special effects. It is, without a doubt, one of the best shows in the last decade and is definitely in my top 5.

I have purchased every box set since the first season and have shopped around with each release to make sure that I picked the best looking set. When Season 2 was released, you had a choice between what slip cover was on the box set and this continued with Season 3 as well. With every release, the packaging was sturdy and each disc was housed on it's own section/page of the fold out case.

Unfortunately, this last box set feels very flimsy and the blu-rays are packed in the horrible stacked orientation. They removed the pocket that typically housed any extra bonus materials (like the UV code) and have decided to just lay them loosely inside the case. The bottom disc on each section has to be tucked in and then snapped into place, which can be difficult and frustrating to remove.

This show makes a lot of money and as a fan, I am disappointed that HBO decided to go the cheap route with this latest set. No doubt, there will be some superior complete blu-ray release when the show is finally finished, but I doubt I will spend the money to buy it again if subsequent box sets are as cheaply produced.",1479254400,25,1329,4.372469635627531

Prevoius seasons have held 1 disc per page in a well designed, snug holder filled with key art in hard carboard. This season, the plastic trays are not even glued to the cardboard backing properly. It came off with little effort when I tried to remove bits of broken plastic from behind the discs. Yes, my copys interior packaging arrived cracked and broken even though there was no outward damage which tells me that it was damaged before it even left the factory. I would've gladly paid an extra $10 to have the quality of the previous seasons so they can all sit on my movie shelf and look amazing. Instead we're given a basic and cheap holder for an otherwise praiseworthy series. HBO, read these reviews (because I'm not the only one) and learn from this. Your fans are not used to disappoint and they are not amused.",1479168000,6,1303,4.456066945606694
7774566,5,B01H2JPTDO,"As a collector, the packaging disappointed me because it is much thinner than the prior seasons, and aesthetically just doesn't match with the rest of the seasons on my bookcase. However, this was the best season of the best TV show ever created, so of course it deserves 5 stars regardless.",1479168000,2,291,4.7254901960784315
7774567,1,B01H2JPTDO,"As a collector, I am very disappointed in the changes to the packaging compared to previous seasons. The paper sleeve does not match compared to the other seasons and has ugly pictures and text like a standard blue ray movie.  It looks ugly on my shelf.  Why not be consistent with the other releases?

Plus, when I removed the outer sleve, the surprise glue tore away at the inner sleeve leaving an ugly mark in the finish.

Also, the packaging does not unfold like previous seasons to reveal all the cool artwork. Instead, it has these overlapping disc trays that hold 2 discs each and much less artwork.

The whole thing just feels cheap...

I love this show and love the season episodes. They are amazing. Would I buy it again?  Yes, but I am still quite disappointed.",1479168000,110,772,4.550724637681159

7774569,1,B01H2JPTDO,"Awful release, talk about a company that wanted to save as much money as possible and yet keep the prices the exact same. I am over upset about season 6, best buy ditched the exclusive house covers so I was forced to by the regular version, I thought I would at least get a slipcover,, WRONG! Instead I get a piece of paper that sliders off and leaves a cardboard box with a lenticular picture, that doesn't even say GAME OF THRONES ON IT. It only does on the spine. Then you pull it out of the box and what do you get? A cheaply thrown together product that has two flaps and disks piled on top of each other. I also found my disk ajar and me having to press the crappy plastic to the box since the little glue wasn't holding it together.

Bad excuse for a release DO NOT BUY, You're better off getting the stupid steelbook from best buy, which is still stupid, but better than this",1479168000,2,883,4.16374269005848

7774592,5,B01H2JPTDO,"What can I say?  I'm hooked.  But THIS IS NOT FOR KIDS.  At all.  None of these seasons are.  I don't think these are fit for under 18 years of age due to the sexual violence and sometimes perversion involved in some scenes.  They can be very emotionally damaging for young women, if you ask me.  Especially the brutal rape scenes (imagine being raped by a massive pointed iron object from behind???)  Only mature women can (barely) handle such scenes.  And to me, they don't add much to the story line.  Of course, they do make us understand the horrid depravity of the king in the story which makes us all want him to die, so.. okay.  But for goodness sakes, parents, be warned.  This is not for youngsters- unless you want to mess them up in the head.  BUT, with that warning out there, I can't help but be entranced with the rest of the storyline.  I love it.  I fast forward through the disturbing parts and enjoy the rest.  I LOVE the fantasy element that the writers/directors/animation staff/costume staff/ etc put together- they can truly take a story that might sound hokey on paper and make it realistic to a modern, sophisticated audience and make you BELIEVE it!  You truly feel that dragons CAN exist.  You soar with them through the air and you feel their hot breath as they burn the bad guys up in their evil deeds.  You cheer on Denaris as she frees the slaves and stomps down the powerful and cruel masters.  You feel her pain and loneliness as she must choose responsibility over personal gratification as all good leaders must do.  You believe the open sea is truly there, taking Arya to Braavos.  And that wall of faces!  How that makes your skin crawl!  How you dislike that Many Faced 'god' and his detestable temple.  The entire production team of this series is remarkable.  They have GIANT imaginations and tremendous talent.  How they can make rational 21st century people believe in such things is amazing.  I always hate the ending of a show and hate even more the end of a season.  I CAN'T WAIT for Season 7.  Makes me SO SAD that this is supposed to be the last one.

I love anything Thrones but this one deserves a higher number of storms, if just for The Battle of the Bastards episode which I believe won an Emmy.  Cersei Lannister sits on the throne after the literal destruction of the High Sparrow(annoyingly and wonderfully played by Jonathan Pryce).  Jaime Lannister arrives home to see his sister crowned.  Sansa and Arya Stark get their revenge in their own ways.  The final episode 'The Winds of Winter'  ends with  Daenerys Targaryen leading her armada to Kings Landing to retake her heritage from Cersei and the Dragon Throne with her three dragons flying above.  This may be significant.  Women in charge.  Women rule.",1477008000,,717,4.9411764705882355

7774707,5,B01H2JPTDO,I liked this last season the best.  Perhaps it is because I had read the series and I was always trying to think out the next episode.  This season essentially was all new.  I really like how it was playing out. The last two episodes were especially well written and directed.  In many ways this season is better than the last couple of books in the Fire and Ice Series.  The story flowed forward more quickly.  Next season should be really good also as I sense the writing is more free and less tied to the books!,1476921600,12,514,4.247422680412371

Sex, gratuitous violence, language ... etc. etc. etc.  And yet I can't stop watching it.  When I did the first 2 episodes of Season 6 I thought I wasn't as good as the previous years but I just finished episodes 8 and 9 and what endings those two had.  Episode 9 is over the top violent and I thought I was going to have to fast forward thru the battle that went on FOREVER but then I said, I won't know who survives this bloodbath ... and so glad that I watched it all.  No spoilers in this review but GREAT GREAT episode (I can see why it won the Emmy).  Now I just have one episode left until next season and I'm holding out as long as I can.

7774810,4,B01H2JPTDO,"I think the series speaks for itself - it's quite awesome! Therefore I'm rating the actual product as packaged by HBO / Amazon Video. I purchased the equivalent package last season and was very impressed. It had navigation controls for quickly forwarding or reversing through chapters. This was particularly helpful for skipping the lengthy intro (an awesome work in itself really, but after seeing it several times I preferred to skip it) by skipping that chapter (the entire chapter was the intro).  The version I purchased for Season 6 has only very basic controls that do not include chapter navigation. It's a little thing, but still bothersome.

Oh yes, and ain't they grand? Are there some that are worthy of you praise, and whom you can root for? Absolutely.

I just recently became a fan of the whole series and I've got to say. It's a pretty awesome one.

I don't think I have favorite seasons per se BUT I'm pretty sure that a favorite episode has got to be the last one of this season.
The score gave me all the feels and chills.
Combined with the amazing actors how could it not?

I can't wait for what the producers will do for next season.

Highly highly recommend getting them all and catching up if you haven't already!

7774927,5,B01H2JPTDO,"While flipping through channels one evening I stumbled onto the First Season of GOT on HBO. I initially thought it was just another series of Medieval England because the actors/actresses were speaking with British accents & there were castles. Then I watched the episode of the Stark family finding the dire wolf cubs. Dire wolves in England? Weren't they extinct? What kind of series is this? The complex plot development twisting  up to the lead character of  Stark being beheaded  looped me in to follow the series. Season 6 shows the evolution of civil war still continuing long after Ned Stark's death. You see how the noble families fight ,scheme , and lie their way toward the coveted Iron Throne throughout seasons 1-6. Season 6 has the survivors of the Stark family supposedly regain their home of Winterfell. Although there have been many major character introductions as well as radical character departures, it seems the story coalesces around those connected to House Stark rather than the obvious claimants to the Iron Throne. The finale episodes of season 6 hinting of Jon Snow's heritage, Sansa. Bran and Arya'a radical character
development bear testimony to this. Overall, a great season geared to adult viewers. Looking forward to season 7.",1474243200,,1260,5.0772946859903385

Great production values, acting, script, locations, etc. The only thing is that in the latest seasons, you can hardly see due to the lighting approach- natural lighting and since most of the action takes place at night, you can hardly see the action or the actors on the scene. I do not like this lighting approach....",1474243200,,388,4.720588235294118

I haven't read the books, I'm sure it would help the viewer to keep a tighter track of all the nuances of how characters interplay against one another.  I just don't have the time.

Since the series is getting ahead of the books, I have been a little put out. The books give you all the details and background information that make the HBO series that much more enjoyable. Now that the series is ahead of the books.. it seems that I don't enjoy the shows as much. But.. I do like them quite a bit and never am disappointed each season. This season seems to start to pull all the different strings together but yet pop up with surprises at the same time. If you are a GOT fan .. I definitely recommend you continue on with this season in your viewing.",1473033600,,740,4.21830985915493

7775188,5,B01H2JPTDO,"massive improvement over the lackluster season 5 and the going-through-the-motions of the latter half of season 4.  beric dondarrion's appearance in episode 8 was massively heartbreaking, and the season concluded with pretty much absolute definitive indication that there will be no Lady Stoneheart in the tv series.  this disappointment was mostly alleviated by the season finale which was what the show runners claimed season 4's finale would be.

some high points:
most of it.
Ramsay Bolton's battle strategy was perfect and largely realistic, using archers to devastating effect, followed by a Battle of Cannae-style envelopment.

some low points:
Arya's storyline and its ending.
Euron Greyjoy basically doing nothing.
Lack of Lady Stoneheart.
People call Septon Meribald ""Ray"" for some unknown reason.
Virtually non-existent Dornish storyline is at least acknowledged, has a bridge dropped on it, then rushes to haphazardly match up with the book version's Dornish storyline ending, minus any of the interesting or important Dornish characters like Arianne Martell, heir of Dorne, or Quentyn Martell, poor dumb kid of Dorne.
Individuals keep abusing Fast Travel system.

The low point list is only long because there were so few things to complain about, comparatively",1472688000,,1274,5.546391752577319

""Winter is here."" - show tagline.

Five EPIC Stars. ""Game of Thrones"", Season 6 is all about extending the storylines somewhat, tying up some long-running major loose ends that have gone on for entire past seasons, delivering some 'knockout' climatic scenes that are absolutely jaw-dropping, and an amazing and memorable battle, all of which set the plot landscape for Season 7. And knowing that HBO has made the decision to end the ""Game of Thrones"" story at the end of Season 8, should only make the viewers relish the entire sweep of the epic story and its accompanying visual spectacle even more.

But in the very beginning of Episode 1 of Season 6, something happens that almost upends the storyline with an unnatural occurrence. And later, at great risk to their safety, some of our favorite characters have nonetheless survived the expected carnage of GoT to live on, while others have sadly and suddenly perished. Some scores are settled in unique ways for bad and some good characters alike. The plight of the long-suffering Stark family is always a matter of main concern, as are the powerful Lannisters, the greedy Boltons, the ascendant 'dragon queen' Daenerys and her forces, and other major players, like the cagey Littlefinger. Plus the rumored matter of ""R+L=J"" is finally addressed and could affect things in unimaginable ways. In the end, its all about alliances and coming wars as ""Winter is here."" Starring Peter Dinklage, Lena Heady, Emilia Clarke, Kit Harington, Sophie Turner, Emmy-nominated Maisie Williams, Nikolaj Coster Waldau, Natalie Dormer, Iwan Rheon, Alfie Allen, Liam Cunningham, Ian McShane as guest, and many more. Created for TV by David Benioff & D.B. Weiss.

The 'extras' episodes at the end of Season 6 are short GoT vignettes: Episode 101 has the unique 'pillar of faces' with the main characters faces in the 'nooks' and their voices making pronouncements; Episode 102 shows the hardworking prosthetics team spending hours putting on the separately-designed masks and body coverings for the actors, maintaining it during shooting, carefully removing it all, and starting over early the next day; and Episode 103 has some key short scenes building up to Season 6. Highly Recommended. Five WINTRY Stars. (HBO Entertainment. Rated TV-MA, Color. HD. X-Ray. 10 episodes of 50+ minutes, each. Plus 3 short extras.)",1470960000,12,2351,5.133159268929504

7775331,4,B01H2JPTDO,"Season Five left fans on the edge with a lot of questions that Season six answers.  How could Jon Snow be dead?  What- Sansa and Theon jumped from the castle battlement?  Denarius surrounded by Darthrackie Warriors alone and in the middle of a field.  Arya was caught using a face from the Hall of Faces without permission and for her own personal business.  She was punished with blindness and death.  She watched as Jacqan Higar drank poison and then died at her feet; then she went blind.  Bran, Hodor & the girl traveling companion had just taken refuge from 'Them' in the mutant tree with the three-eyed Raven.  Cersie had made it back into the Castle from her 'Walk of Atonement'; her feet bloodied, bare naked and body covered in spittle and filth.
Season six had been out a while when I bought it and it took me about a month after that to write a review but I guess its possible that some people have yet to see it and so I won't reveal even brief highlights on the main characters. What I can say is new depth is revealed in Season six in regard to the Lord of Light High Priestess, Hodor, Sam of the Night watch, Yara, (Theon's sister), and the real parentage of Jon Snow.

Finally - a television story I can lose myself in as a sense of pure entertainment.  No alleged reality TV - to include the election nonsense.  I am not going to give away any spoilers - and shame on you for looking for them - but you must see Seasons 1-5 for 6 to make any sense at all.

6/3/17 - What are you up to Amazon & HBO?  Not that I particularly want them, but bonus views under licenses I already purchased cost more money?  Is this a process by which you can see how far you push people to pay more money to see the shows they want?  You going to split the season so you can charge more?  I am definitely feeling a little like a lab rat here and you are watching from afar - innocently - to see just how much stimuli you need to apply to get me to open my wallet further.  News flash - anymore outflow from my wallet is above my budget.  I dropped cable because costs kept going up and up.  I went to Amazon because I was sick of the ""less story-more advertising"" route that network TV keeps following.  If Amazon starts to get unmanageable in terms of cost - it's back to DVDs for me and no more money beyond my orders for you.  Release times between big screen and DVDs are going down anyways.  So whatever is going on, I'll be watching you too.",1470614400,,1379,4.055555555555555

7775442,5,B01H2JPTDO,"[WARNING: Here there be Dragons. And SPOILERS, Many Spoilers! If you haven't watched Season 6, AVERT YOUR EYES like I'm opening the Ark of the Covenant...]

After watching the first couple episodes of Game of Thrones, I was one of those bandwagon-jumpin' mofos who immediately sprinted to the bookstore, becoming an overnight ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' fanboy. After giving up genre books for literature a decade or so earlier, I owe GRRM and the HBO series for rekindling my love for fantasy and science fiction. I went through all 5 books long before season 2, but my enthusiasm for the show was undiminished, thanks to the showrunner''s brilliant adaptation of the source material and a massive budget afforded by massive popularity, allowing for the most stunning sets, costumes, and CGI of any small-screen production.

As the show kept eating its way through Martin's material, diverging further from the novels every year, it was also moving inexorably towards the Game of Thrones/A Song of Ice and Fire Singularity. I never believed the show would be permitted to push its way past the books. The story was stalled at Jon Snow's corpse, and it was inconceivable that David Benioff and D.B. Weiss would step past his well-perforated cadaver without George R.R. Martin''s next book hitting the shelves first. But then it was happening...' they were filming material that would take us far beyond the charted corners of Westeros... metaphorically speaking. I felt more excited and anxious than I had since those first amazing episodes; as season 6 was close to premiering, 'The Winds of Winter' was nowhere to be seen. I don''t know if season 6 was the best since season 1, but by the end of episode 9 -- ''The Battle of the Bastards'' -- I was yelling and cheering like an idiot,' and kind of wishing I had experienced the rest of the series the same way, with no clue what was coming next and an anxious knot in my gut. There were plenty of moments in past seasons that triggered the same thrilling anxiety, despite knowing what had to happen next (or because of it); the Red Wedding, obviously, but for me, the most dramatic scene was Tyrion's Trial by Combat in Season 4. The brutal showdown between Sir Gregor 'The Mountain Who Rides' Clegane and Oberyn 'The Red Viper' Martell is a perverse favorite, even more sickening and crazy and heart-rending than I'd envisioned it. That scene sums up everything that makes GoT so powerful and unforgettable, and I can't imagine how shocking it would of been if I hadn't known what to expect. Oberyn was GRRM's modernized version of an Errol Flynn-style Rogue: charismatic, cunning, well-read, and despite being one of the deadliest men alive with his snake-like speed and venom-coated swords, he lived every second to the fullest, drinking life up without fear of death. When he bravely took Tyrion's side to face off against the Incredible Hulk**, his real motive was to kill Clegane and avenge the brutal rape and murder of his sister and her infant child. Everything in our TV viewing experience told us Martell would defeat Clegane and exact righteous vengeance, which made his agonized dying screams so much more shocking and awful. It doesn't happen in stories, but we know it happens that way in the real world.

Though I love the detail and depth of the books, and miss the storylines that were abandoned by the showrunners -- 'Lady Stoneheart', for example, which seems to be a title transferred to Catelyn's daughter, Arya, instead; and the grim cliffhanger involving Brienne of Tarth --' the pace of the show is much quicker, without feeling abridged in any significant sense. It was also a fan-friendlier season, with predictable but cathartic payoffs that were very unlike the complex and bittersweet developments of years previous, with the heart-rending and cold-blooded character treatment that has become a GRRM trademark: Ned Stark''s execution, Jaime Lannister''s 'handicapping', Tyrion''s humiliation and disgrace after brilliantly defeating Stannis, the Red Wedding, Daenarys's' struggles with the Sons of the Harpy and the Slave-masters, et cetera. There were still some painful moments of course -- R.I.P. Hodor*, Rickon, and both Bran and Rickon's Direwolves** -- but they were obscured for once by some thoroughly satisfying victories: Ramsay Bolton having his face devoured by his own starving hounds was f@#$%^g delightful, and it was very sweet to see Arya pull the Waif''s face off and present it to Jaqen, dropping the mic and heading home... but not as sweet as the pie she serves to Lord Frey in the finale, showing off the skills she acquired serving the Many-Faced God. Daenerys was again in the ascendant, the Targaryean Goddess of Dragons and Flames. She entered the Dothraki City as a prisoner, her options limited to gang-rape, death, or joining the depressing summer-camp where the women of dead Khals waited around until finally following their lovers into horsey heaven. None of those options were appealing, so she found a fourth option: in the Great Hall, with the Khals gathered to pass judgement, she simply upended the braziers and watched them all burn, emerging from the flames naked, lightly tanned and completely triumphant, in a call-back to the end of Season 1, as she emerged from the funeral pyre of Khal Drogo like a child from the womb, her bada$$ dragon-babies in tow. Speaking of which -- seeing all three dragons set free to destroy the Slavemaster's ships, while her shiny-new Dothraki horde butchered the Sons of the Harpy -- priceless. There was also more plot-holes than usual, for the sake of setting up these big, dramatic payoffs: i.e. why the hell wouldn't Sansa mention to Jon Snow that she was bringing in the Knights of the Vale? The writers address it in the final episode, but... meh. And how could Jaime Lannister, head of the King's Guard and father of King Tommen, not have made certain he knew where the King was before marching out to shut the High Sparrow down and prevent the Queen's 'walk of shame'? He was expecting a bloody riot in King's Landing, but he doesn't bother keeping this good-natured, weak-willed boy monarch safely locked down? But I find it hard to nitpick, given the end results. One complaint that pops up is the apparent speed with which characters move across the map, especially in the finale. Arya, Varys, and even Lady Martell cross vast distances in no time. But 'no time' is the key; no timelines are given, and in a world that moves via foot, hoof and sail, it's obvious that time has been compressed, with weeks and months going between scenes for dramatic pace and effect.

After the glorious carnage of the penultimate episode, it was hard to imagine the finale surpassing it -- but that's just what happened. We witnessed pseudo-historical moments more important than WWII, as Cersei channelled the Mad King, destroying the Sept of Baelor by turning it into a small jade star of wildfire, burning everyone inside to ash, and sending the High Sparrow and his obnoxious herd into the arms of the Seven. But Queen Margaery Tyrell and her family perished as well, and Cersei's moment of bright green vengeance has an unexpected cost, fulfilling the grim prophecy revealed to her as a girl, as her good son King Tommen follows her bad son King Joffrey from the Iron Throne to the grave.

Tommen's suicide calls back to the very first episode, when Jaime pushed Brann out a high window in Winterfell. Queen Cersei, her husband and three children gone, takes the Iron Throne after using wildfire to 'burn them all'. This deliberately references the Mad King, and suggests that Jaime's disgrace as 'The King-Slayer' may be redeemed when he kills his sister and lover, The Mad Queen, this time without wearing the armor of The King's Guard. This would also fulfill the childhood prophecy revealed to her by Maggis the Frog, that she would die by the hand of a valonqar -- high Valyrian for ""little brother"" -- a term which could mean Tyrion, but Jaime as well: Cersei was born a few minutes earlier than he was, making him the 'valonqar' I'm betting on. Daenerys, meanwhile, crosses the Poison Water with her strange mix of her Dothraki horsemen and the Ironborn pirates and their Queen, as Varys secures an alliance with the new Queen of Dorne. Just as all of Westeros seems destined for female rule, Jon Snow is proclaimed King in the North -- thanks to the awesome Lady Mormont -- just as it seemed Sansa might become Lady of Winterfell. And finally, after more than a decade of speculation, 'R + L = J' is proven true, as Brann's vision allows us to follow a young Ned Stark inside the Tower of Joy, after killing Ser Arthur Dane, the Sword of the Morning. When we find Lyanna Stark inside, bleeding to death after a hard childbirth, and see her whisper in Ned's ear, asking him to care for the infant, a slow shift from the child's face to the face of Jon Snow, we know that the theories were true, and Lyanna Stark was his mother. Even for casual fans, the fact that Rhaegar Targaryen went to meet his terrible fate at the end of Robert's Rebellion, leaving his best friend and the greatest fighter in Westeros to protect a pregnant Lyanna Stark, makes it obvious that Jon Snow's father was Rhaegar Targaryen. As the Mad King's eldest son, Rhaegar was heir to the Iron Throne. As Rhaegar's only living heir, half Targaryen, half Stark, now King in the North, his claim on the Iron Throne might be the strongest.

I'm still impatiently awaiting the next book, but I'm glad the show has moved ahead of it. I didn't particularly like the idea of putting the series on hiatus and waiting for Martin, but moving ahead without him seemed like the perfect place for things to fall apart. Fortunately, the series is in good hands. Benioff is a talented novelist in his own right ('City of Thieves' is brilliant), and Martin has welcomed Benioff and Weiss into the Sanctum Sanctorum, revealing all his plots and sadistic plans. Seasons 7 and 8 are going to be f@#$%^g epic.

Footnotes:

*(Anyone who didn't recognize the Hodor/Hold the door revelation as a very GRRM-style device, still hasn't realized which character the author loosely based on himself, or a fantasy version, at any rate. His affinity for Tyrion is obvious, but the correct answer is Jorah Marmont, described in the books as a dark-complected, bearlike man with a thick, black, curly beard; a far cry from the very blond, very UN-bearlike HBO-Marmont. The clue he provides is nearly identical to the Hodor-reveal; saying it fast and slurring, a two-syllable corruption of 'Hold the door' was what remained. Say 'George R R Martin' 10 times, as fast as possible: 'Jorj-ahrahr Marton, Jor-ahrah Marmin, Jorah Marmont.')

**(It's possible that the only Stark's to survive 'The War for the Dawn' will be the characters whose Direwolves are still alive. Rob Stark lost his Direwolf and then his life at the red wedding, and Rickon followed shortly behind Shaggydog in death. Arya's Direwolf Numeria is still presumably alive and well, as is Jon's, but this might not bode well for Bran and Sansa.)

***(the original Hulk, Lou Ferrigno, was one of the first competitors in 'The World's Strongest Man' championships; the actor who portrayed The Mountain for his duel with the Red Viper -- the third actor to play the role -- was Icelandic strongman Hafr Jlus Bjrnsson, who -- like Ferrigno, has come close but has yet to win in the last 5 'World's Strongest Man' events, taking 6th in 2011, 3rd in 2012, 2013, and 2015, and a near 2nd in 2014.)",1470096000,12,11556,4.831818181818182

And even thou I could have watched some ""spoiler alerts,"" I did no such thing' This show reminds me a bit of a Chess Game. I was a little disappointed here & there bc it seemed as thou the bad guys/villians, were always gonna win & then the enemies end up working together but that is part of the intriguing storyline.
My favorite characters are: Jon Snow, whom I believe is either a Stark/Baratheon, because of King Robert being his ""real"" father & Edd Stark's sister being his ""real"" mother. But if he ends up being part Stark/Targaryen, who will get the Throne between him & Daenyrs? And that's if Rhegaer Targaryen is his & Daenyrs' father. Oh, bloody hell, this is crazy'
Will this be the ""Real"" battle of ""Game of Thrones?"" I also like Daenyrs' character & Arya's. From this point, I believe there will be a battle between the two Queens, Daenrys & Cersei, whom I can't stand!!  with Daenyrs winning & taking the Iron Throne ""BACK"" from those ""evil, perverted"" Lannisters but, again, there is Jon Snow, whom I said all along should be King!

7775485,5,B01H2JPTDO,"After being disappointed by the last season of GoTs, I can honestly say that season 6 more than makes up for it. Most of the episodes this season seemed stronger as a whole with the series slowing down a bit in the middle and then picking back up at the end of the season. I won't give away any spoliers but I will say that episodes 9 and 10 in particular were some of the best ones they have ever put out, and could be some of the best television I've ever seen...

By the time the credits roll for the last episode in this season, you really start to get the sense that this show is slowly winding down and that things are starting to reach the beginning of the end.

GoTs has always been a show that was clever, unpredictable, and provided just enough pure ""shock"" value to keep viewers wanting more. Despite the next and final 2 seasons being shorter, I think it's safe to say that we will be in for a crazy ride!

A big thanks to HBO and all the creators because this season was killer! :P

In my opinion, the final two episodes of season 6 were the best of the entire series. Includes the best battle sequence I've ever seen onscreen and the finale was downright Shakespearean.  I wish Miguel Sapochnik could direct every episode.  Can't rave enough about the soundtrack by composer Ramin Djawadi. ""Light of the Seven"" gives me goosebumps every time I hear it.

Seriously, all you one star rating people must be blind?! You somehow managed to miss the big PRE-ORDER word in orange at the top of the page,just under the description of the show? With the big box around it?  I pre-ordered as soon as the page came up weeks ago, and it always made it clear it was PRE-ORDER and that HBO would be announcing when the episodes were to be released. Still waiting as of 7-18-16 but it was not till August last year so I am enjoying re-watching the other seasons while I wait and picking up on lots of things I didn't catch the first or second time around.

OKay, on to the review!! =

SPOILER FREE REVIEW

The season is not perfect by any means but though it is uneven, there are several standout episodes that IMHO are some of the BESTin TV-5, 9 and 10 are incredible.  The director who did The Gift and Hardhome returns for 9 and 10 and they are totally different types of episodes, yet absolutely magnificent. Just give 9 or 10 all the Emmys. Superb.

The main issue with the season, IMHO, was really the author. He kept promising a new book, and failing to deliver. The showrunners were trying not to go too far ahead of the books in order to try to stay true to the author's vision. Then, when they could see the book was going to be a no-show, (and STILL IS), they just decided to make absolutely incredible TV and let rip. OMG.

After such stupendous work, I really hope the showrunners are not going to wait around for any more books and just treat it like a TV series, because it's more than a year later and there's still no sign of the new book Winds of Winter, let alone the final ""Spring"" title supposed to be completing the entire series if the author can ever manage it.

They have said there will only be 13 more episodes, but possible spin-offs, and the last 2 seasons will be shot all at once so it sounds like they are going for the goal posts without any books. Yay.

That being the case, Season 6 is a great payoff from Season 5, with a lot of bits of 3 and 4 resolved as well, which leaves us free to push forward to Season 7 and the projected Season 8. They have a lot left to do in 13 episodes, 7 for season 7 and 8 for season 8, though they are saying they are going to be longer episodes like Season 8, 9 and 10. (10 was the longest ever, and still left me eager for more).

The main characters we know and love are in good form, even Sansa, though I am still not that crazy about her. Tyrion treads water a bit at the start of the season, but there's a reason for that. Dany is continuing her story arc in a somewhat predictable form. Bran is getting more interesting-though it is jarring at times to see how 'gawkily' he has aged from the cute kid of the first season. Some fantastic guests include Max Von Sydow and Ian McShane.  I love Brinne, Bronn and Pod and only wish we could see more of them.

There are a few welcome returns of old faces, but will not spoil the joy for you.

I am sure the author will be giving feedback on the scripts to give a general idea of how this is all supposed to end in the next couple of seasons HBO has contracted for, but I hope the powers that be just keep doing what they did at the end, create a fantastic TV show rather than a book adaptation.  BTW, the special effects this year were off the charts and the music outstanding, esp % and 10. ENJOY!!",1467763200,4,3609,4.141630901287554

7775500,5,B01H2JPTDO,"Note about the DVD/BluRay release date. It's probably going to be February or March 2017, based on the pattern of the previous 5 seasons which were all released in those months. The streaming video version may come before that, but its not clear when. (Hey, I'm just the messenger. Don't hate me. I can't make them release it faster. I canceled HBO as soon as GoT ended and I want to watch it again too.) That said, there is no point in paying for it now (July 2016) on instant video because you're not going to be able to actually watch it for probably 9 months.

As for the show....

Things get real in Season 6. With only 2 short seasons remaining after season 6 (Both seasons 7 and 8 are reported to be under 10 episodes each) the scattered storylines are starting to come together into one grand story. Don't worry, I'm not going to give away any details here about who wins and who loses in this season. There might be mild spoilers for here for people who haven't seen the first 5 seasons, but if you haven't see Season 1 - 5 yet you should be no where near this listing for season 6 because you will be so incredibly confused by what's going on that your brain might explode. .

Like every other season, some people win. Some people lose. A lot of people die. If you've watch the previous 5 seasons you'll know that's not a spoiler. That's practically a tagline for the series.

The story line through season 6 was starting to get really fractured, going in 100 different directions. Season 6 starts to reign them all back in to one main storyline regarding who ultimately gains lasting power over the Seven Kingdoms, which has been the main story arc of the entire series. It's just getting more focused now. (Largely because 90% of the original competitors for the Iron throne has killed each other prior to season 6)

Season 6 also hits you with a lot of surprises that you will not see coming. A lot of times when an epic series like this starts to move towards a final resolution there will be a buffer season that sets up major plot points but isn't all that entertaining in the process. That is not the case here. Season 6 may be the best season so far. There are at least 2 episodes that are EASILY in the top 5 of the entire series. And there is one plot reveal that qualifies as the best absolute game changer for the direction of the story. (Don't worry. I'm not even going to hint about what it is or when it happens. Just know that at some point in season 6 your mind will be blown.)

Also, without going into detail so as to not spoil anything for people who haven't watched yet....apparently a Lannister always COLLECTS on their debts, too. Shame.........shame........

Visually the series continues to be stunning. The production value is just insane on this show. The costumes. The set designs. It's all incredible.

The story, both the overall story and the individual smaller storylines, continue to be very entertaining with so much detail packed into them that you feel a part of the show.

But the real joy of the series, and in Season 6 more than any other in my opinion, is the character development. Early in the series there were clearly defined good guys and bad guys. Ned Stark was a good guy, pure to his core. Cersei Lannister was an evil Queen, as black hearted as could be. Everyone fell into those defined roles early on. As the show progressed you see more moral grey area and internal conflict in the characters. But in season 6 they take that to a new level. You see new sides of characters showing their internal struggles and that gives them so much more depth. The character development is what really pushes season 6 to the top of the pile for me. You still have absolute bad guys. But most everyone else is dealing with some kind of moral struggle and it's just amazingly good writing.

Hand in hand with the great character development is great acting for those characters. The best writing in the world is useless if you don't have actors who can sell the parts. Game of Thrones does not have that problem. Not only are the individual actors amazing, but they've all been working together now for multiple seasons so there is more chemistry between them. The actors play off of one another better because they've been working together for so long. It all makes the entire show more immersive and believable. (As believable as a show with fire breathing dragons can be anyway)",1467676800,146,4426,4.493781094527363

With it's usual level of graphic-violence, scenes of nudity (though perhaps fewer than previous series) and strong language
the story of betrayal and scheming along with it's usual level of twists and turns continues in style....
'Sansa' (Sophie Turner) and 'Theon' (Alfie Allen) have escaped the clutches of the sadistic ruler of Winterfell 'Ramsey Bolton'
(Iwan Rheon) but need the help of 'Brienne' ( Gwendoline Christie) and her page 'Pod' to complete their flight...
'Sansa' wants to journey to the wall to seek help from her half-brother 'Jon Snow' (Kit Harington) (unaware of the treachery
that had befallen him) to overthrow 'Ramsey' and reclaim their ancestral home.
'Theron' intends to return to Iron Islands to rejoin his house.
'Jon Snow' had been killed because he'd shown compassion to the sworn enemies of the Black Watch 'The Wildings' those
closest and loyal to their commander seek help from 'Mellsandre' (Carice Van Houten) to raise the dark power of 'The Lord of
Light' to bring 'Jon Snow' back from the dead, should such a power be unleashed ?
Kings Landing remains in disarray with the religious fanatics 'The Sparrows' holding sway, still having the Queen 'Margaery'
and her brother 'Loras' held to account for their sins.
'Cersei' (Lena Headley ) who had suffered at their hands and had been humiliated with the walk of atonement coupled with
High-Sparrow' (Johnathan Pryce) insisting on a further trial, surely she is plotting her revenge.
Meanwhile 'Mother of Dragons' 'Daenerys' (Emilia Clarke) held captive by the 'Khals' will prove too hot to handle for their leaders.
Back at 'Meereen' 'Tyrion' (Peter Dinklage) who is carving out a new beginning try's to hold things together awaiting 'Daenerys' return.
Meanwhile at Braavos 'Ayra Stark' (Maisie Williams) now lives on the streets, blind and a beggar, she will have to rekindle her identity
and prove herself before her sight is returned to her.
Whilst 'Bran Stark' (Isaac Hempstead Wright) who has lived within the security of the cave of the children of the forest with his two
companions still has visions of past, present and future, during an unaccompanied vision he will unwittingly bring death and destruction
upon the sancuary, the disabled 'Bran' barely escaping with his life.
Meanwhile those seeking to take back Winterfell will have difficulty in raising an army large enough to defeat 'Ramsey Bolton' however
because of the threats made against them, they will march on to face overwhelming numbers regardless of consequence.
With intrigue and complications at Kings Landing, Meereen under siege upon 'Daenerys's' return, followers of 'Jon Snow' preparing for
battle, the stage is set....
Will the 'Stark' siblings that had been scattered to the four corners of the kingdom reunite ?......will the 'Lannister's' regain control of
Kings Landing ?.....the plot thickens, but will all questions be answered ?
With the Dragons surely now full grown and the Fleet assembled along with the threat of the White-Walkers looming series seven looks set to
be another 'cracker'
As always several story-lines run alongside each other throughout the series (10 episodes never seeming enough)
The early part of the series tidies-up the story lines from season five
The battle scenes are the equal of the best big-screen 'medieval' offerings down the years in my opinion.
As is always the case there are several stand-out surprises along the way, though, as is often the case, some intended to be so were well-documented
before the series was screened.
(As i have always done, i recorded the first 9 episodes before starting to watch the series rather than having to wait a week
to see what happens next, finishing up viewing the final two episodes after recording the 10th, of course the trick is, avoiding
the gossip and write-ups before watching the complete series)
The story going way beyond the books written by the author 'George R.R.Martin' (Be interesting to learn what direction his
story does indeed go)
This remains a must-watch series.....as brilliant as ever,

THE REVIEW WRITTEN TO HIGHLIGHT THE CHARACTERS RATHER THAN PLOT OUTLINE (ALTERNATIVE READ THOUGH
MANY THOUGHTS ARE AS ABOVE)
The much followed fantasy drama continues -
The ten short episodes passing by oh too quickly (I recorded the series watched it over 3/4 evenings, don't like waiting a
whole week to see what happens next)
With it's usual level of graphic-violence, scenes of nudity (though perhaps fewer than previous series) and strong language
the story of betrayal and scheming along with it's usual level of twists and turns continues in style....
We follow the fortunes of the likes of -
'Mother of Dragons' - 'Daenerys' (Emilia Clarke) who we left in the last series surrounded and captured by 'Dothraki' and
taken to 'Khal Moro' ....one just knows she'll prove too hot to handle by it's leaders.
At 'Meereen' 'Tyrion' (Peter Dinklage) who after years of disrespect by his peers at 'Kings Landing' has seemingly finally found
his place in life in the service of 'Daenerys' ..with the help of others try's to hold things together awaiting the return of 'The
Mother of Dragons'
At Kings Landing where the religious fanatics 'The Sparrow's' appear to hold sway and continue to hold members of the Royal
Household to account, surely 'Cersei' (Lena Headley) who had been humiliated by having to do the walk of atonement and
yet still has to face a further trial by order of 'High Sparrow' (Johnathan Pryce) is plotting revenge.
The surviving 'Stark' siblings had been scattered by events to the four corners of the Kingdom -
'Sansa' (Sophie Turner) who with 'Theon' (Alfie Allen) escaped the clutches of the sadistic and controlling 'Ramsey Bolton' (Iwan
Rheon) master at 'Winterfell'  -  will seek their own destiny, 'Theon' will try to return to his 'House' at 'Iron Islands' and 'Sansa'
will seek the help of 'Jon Snow' (Kit Harington) (not aware of the treachery that had befallen him) to raise and army to reclaim
'Winterfell' and exact revenge on the evil 'Ramsey Bolton' that had abused her.
'At 'Braavos' - 'Arya Stark' (Maisie Williams) who had been left blind will have to prove herself if sight is to be returned to her, by
accepting to be no-one
She had exiled herself in effect but still despite what has happened to her craves revenge for the death of her Mother and elder
Brother who had met a violent end.
'Bran Stark' (Isaac Hempstead) who had be rendered disabled after a fall from a tower at Winterfell has for the past years
with his companions lived with 'The Children of the Forest' in their cave, 'Bran' still has visions of the past, present and future...
he will at some point have to determine where his future lies.
What of younger brother 'Rickon Stark' (Art Parkinson) who has been held by 'Lord Umber' all this time ??
We also follow the fortunes of 'Samwell' (John Bradley) who with his 'charge' 'Gilly' and her child had been told by 'Jon Snow'
to leave the wall before the wars to come and find a home and a future for themselves.
....when returning to Kings Landing after a mission 'Jaimie Lannister' ( Nicolaj Coster- Waldau) will find things to have changed
considerably upon his return.
The battle scenes are in my view the equal of any sword-wielding presentations we've seen on the silver-screen down the years
As is always the case there are several stand-out surprises along the way, though, as is often the case, some intended to be so were
well-documented before the series was indeed screened.
The story going way beyond the books written by the author 'George R.R.Martin' (Be interesting to learn what direction his
story does indeed go)
Another compelling series has come to a close with a frustrating 12 months to wait for the seventh......
Much yet to come....with 'Daenerys' with her now fully grown Dragons and her vast army about to invade 'Westeros' and it's
seven kingdoms can the 'Lannister's' hang on, if not, who will really claim 'The Iron Throne'  ??
There is also the threat of the 'White-Walkers' still to come, but, who will stop them ?
Will the surviving 'Stark's' come together finally ?

7775521,5,B01H2JPTDO,"The season, overall, was fantastic and well-rounded. There were a few minor ""the writers should've rethought that"" moments, but they never threw the show off its course for me. But...those last two episodes...lets talk about those last two episodes. They set the bar so high for this show and TV in general. Never have I been so intensely honed in on my TV in my entire life. Extremely cinematic, poignant, emotional, riveting, all in one. Can't wait for season 7.",1467244800,43,464,4.8125

7775523,5,B01H2JPTDO,"I am glad that Amazon gets it when they get it. I am glad that HBO sells it to them. I was trying to avoid the spoilers also but what I ended up doing is watching them on You Tube as most of the scenes were complete even if they were broken up. So its kind of like I watched a condensed version of the saga. Now I can sit down and watch it in detail and notice more about what's going on. I wasn't even interested in The Big Bang Theory, or Game of Thrones at all and just started watching them both last year. I love that I can watch an episode a day and not have to wait a week to see what is going on. TY Amazon for carrying this. I have actually been working on a computer Game that is inspired from this show.",1467158400,51,714,3.7986577181208054

Refuse to pay the Iron Price (bundle o' channels) to the cable company to have HBO just so I can watch GoT when it comes out. I can wait.

7775526,5,B01H2JPTDO,Yup it is a pre order just like it says in the description . It would be nice to know of when the release date is but still rating it high because the season is good and not rating it based off of others ability to read descriptions before they purchase it.

7775527,5,B01H2JPTDO,"Can't wait! But I have to, since it CLEARLY and REPEATEDLY says this is a pre-order. I really don't understand those who rate this one star simply because they didn't pay attention to what they were buying. Oh well. This is a fantastic show and I'm assuming--as with the previous seasons--that HD will be worth the price. The series is stunning and deserves HD; treat yourself!",1467158400,6,377,4.7272727272727275

Episode 9 has the best medieval battle iv'e ever seen, no offense towards the movies Troy or The Last Samurai but it makes those battles seem amateur but that's just one man's opinion.",1467072000,32,387,4.464788732394366

7775541,1,B01H2JPTDO,"I found this show on another streaming network, after unsuccessfully watching it on this website.  But, I digress. While I thoroughly enjoy Game of Thrones usually, lately my ability to appreciate the show has been ruined by my inability to watch via my recent purchase, as well as my comments and ratings about the show being previously disproved.  Therefore, I no longer enjoy this show, and would like to post about my lack of enjoyment on this website, which I feel should alter the way in which they advertise purchase for a show.  The show's characters don't appear as effective to me, and the story-line is just well. How can I say this? I feel there isn't enough excitement! After all, I wasn't able to view this product that I had purchased! I also dislike the title of the show now, because it's not much of a ""game"" if you can't watch it!  Hopefully one day soon, I can write a better review of this show for this website. Thank you.  P.S. Some people don't know what ""pre-order"" means.  Especially if they've never ""pre-ordered"" anything. I am not a retail expert and assumed pre-order to be an order involving streaming of episodes released prior to a store-available DVD version.",1466985600,4,1193,4.684210526315789
