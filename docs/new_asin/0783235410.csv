66287,2,0783235410,"Don't waste your time on this movie.
There are some good actors here, but they didn't have anything good to work with, and so they did their best.
I love Steven Rea.

SPOILERS..

Annette Benning plays psychic.
She sees little girls get kidnapped, but she gets the psychic clues much too late to save anyone.

She sees clues on the kidnapping of a little girl, and, too late, she realizes that it is actually her own little girl who gets kidnapped and killed.

It is never explained how the little girls are killed, they are just found dead somehow.

It really bothered me that Annette and her husband didn't seem to mourn their own little girl.
They did some screaming when she first was found dead, but that was all.

Annette has visions of her husband and dog getting killed, but again, it is too late, and they are both murdered.
She does not appear to mourn them.  She is too focused on her visions.

She even has visions of her own death, and, at the end, she also dies.

The movie started out really interesting.
I love psychic movies.
But after her own little girl is killed, the movie takes a turn, and it just becomes ridiculous.
The story went out of control, so that the kidnapper was able to read Annette just like she could read him.
The kidnapper leads Annette right to him, where he was holding another little girl hostage.

I didn't find anything scary about this movie.
The movie tried to be scary and tried to make the kidnapper look really sick and twisted and nuts, but it was just too ridiculous.
The psychic images were really good at the beginning, until the story began focusing on apples and water.

It was never explained how and why Annette and the kidnapper could read each other.
It was loosely explained that the kidnapper wanted a family because he was abused and abandoned by his parents, so he kidnaps little girls to be his family, and then kills them, but it is not explained how or exactly why he kills them.

Little girls die.
Annette dies, her little girl dies, her dog dies, her husband dies.
Two men who innocently pick up hitchhikers (first the kidnapper and then Annette) both die.
The last kidnapped girl and the kidnapper survive.
Annette's maid survives, but she was obviously left without a job now that the entire household was murdered.
The psychiatrist and the mental hospital do not seem to get into trouble for not doing their jobs, by letting both the kidnapper and Annette escape and by not protecting them and everyone else.

I thought that it was strange and funny and ridiculous that the kidnapper's name was Vivian, and yes, he was a man.
How can a man be named Vivian?
And why wouldn't he give himself some kind of a nickname with a name like that?

I actually laughed at the end, which was clearly supposed to be sick and scary, but instead, was, again, ridiculous.

The talent of Steven Rea, as the psychiatrist, was wasted.
And a lot of apples were wasted.",1438560000,,2917,4.519011406844107

The plot was so good that I really would have liked it a little longer to have more info on the town and the event it refers to and more about how that motivated characters.

One of the reasons it was great, that beside my peaked interest in the town and thinking about similar town fates, I didn't carry the scary parts with me for days.  It might have done so if the story was true.( The whole 1965 story about the town fate WAS true, but it was just used as the plot setting& motivation-no actual thriller events)  It was satisfying as a thriller done in a complete way, accomplishing exactly what it set out to do.

After that she goes certifiably insane because crazy killer is communicating with her through her dreams.  She breaks out of an insane asylum but not in time to save her husband, pilot (Aidan Quinn).  Dated, histrionic, great cast but in their early years and the material is very mediocre.

This was a very surprising film because I really like Annette Benning and Robert Downey, Jr. - normally!

The story was disjointed and the script was predictable but the acting was ""surprising"" at best. Benning was not convincing in her role however she definitely had moments. RDJ was as strange as possible in a role that was scripted one half psycho and one half psycho on steroids. This was one of his early films so that accounts for something I suppose but the script he had to deal with was a huge hinderance for an actor who could have done much more.

Ah, the production - over the top to say it mildly. Any pretense of elegant tension was quickly dissipated by the gore associated with RDJ's actions. I mean, come on folks, having Adian Quinn's face eaten off by a starving dog (his dog I might observe), is reaching to once again, put it mildly. By-the-by, Quinn's role/script was even more off-putting than Benning or RDJ.

66516,2,0783235410,"In 1999, there was this guy who went completely off the rails.  He was a squatter, did drugs, and was a nightmare for everyone around him.  It's amazing how art can imitate life.

Well, luckily for us, Robert Downey Jr. turned his life around, while not so much can be said about the character named Vivian that he played in this film.  Vivian is surely a psycho, but the question is, how could any sane real-life actor want to play this character after taking a peek at the screenplay?  Or even want to be involved in such an ill-fated project?

And this goes for Annette Bening, who's done some very nice work over her career.  It even applies to Aidan Quinn, an actor that I believe hasn't quite gotten enough credit over the years.  I think that, while you surely can't bucket him into that ""great"" actor category, he surely is only a notch or so below that.  He was really good in ""Stakeout,"" but I also really liked him in ""Benny and Joon.""  And he's kind of got that ""everyman quality"" that people can relate to, even though most likely most women find him to be attractive.

With regards to this film, the screenplay is absolutely nonsensical.  I was laughing most of the time, which surely is a bad sign.  This was supposed to be either horror, or some psychological thriller, right?  Well, it was horrifying, call it more of a nightmare that never seemed to end.  And it's running time was only 98 minutes, but it sure seemed much longer than that to me.  After I had wasted a half hour or so of my time, I decided to stick it out.  Well, as a smart guy once said to me, ""Don't throw good money after bad.""  Wish I'd listen, even though this was on ""free"" TV.

Thinking about the question, ""Why did the actors even want to be involved in this ill-fated project?"" I did come up with a theory.  It was 1999 and a recession was just on the horizon.  The DotCom bubble was about to burst, and money was going to be tight.  Well, both the Robert Downey Jr. and Annette Bening characters were supposed to be psychic, so maybe they realized in advance that they'd need the work and the money.  But if this theory is right, then how did Mr. Quinn get sucked in?",1367625600,3,2163,4.339152119700748

I don't know why some people gave this a bad review because most gave their reason that this film was ""unbelievable.""  Movies are suppose to be entertaining, and not necessarily always  believable.  If I wanted to only watch films that were believable, I would watch documentaries and other non-fiction movies.

I found this movie very suspenseful and it kept my interest right up to the end. At times you could not help but feel sorry for Robert Downey Jr. because of they way he was abused as a child and later how he was treated in the mental institution--made you understand why he became mentally ill. Mr. Downey really played his part and was a very believable villain.

If nothing else this film makes you aware of how we need desperately to protect children and prevent child abuse--then just maybe we would not have so many mentally ill adults walking around later in life and committing violent  crimes. And last but not least, we need to make sure there are some types of laws and rules are in place that would make sure that the mentally ill got the right kind of treatments instead of treatments that are more or less is just more abuse--such as shock treatments.

In addition to that, the woman who plays lead characters spends WAY too much time screaming her head off and never acting normal even for a *second* so the entire film ended up giving me a headache.

I understand she'd freak out during one scene involving her daughter by a lake, but for the most part, she was extremely hard to deal with thanks entirely to her nonstop screaming.  It was completely out of control to an annoying extent.

Sometimes I just don't get what the writers are going for, and this *extremely* confusing storyline is a perfect example of ""I don't get it"" that I've ever seen.  You just don't know what's going on half the time... no no, make that 25% of the time.  It's all a big bundle of confusion and it never really stops being confusing either.

But nobody believes her being able to foresee the killer's next steps, as she could with her own daughter. In addition, the nervous breakdown she suffers gets her into a mental facility after a suicide attempt. And here, locked away in a padded cell, she dreams of her husband being murdered. This movie is a taut, edge-of-your-seat complex thriller. Sure, it may be a bit unrealistic, but as far as storytelling, directing and acting, it's a very good movie.

And through the whole thing there was that wonderful tension you get from a good suspense movie, I spent most of the movie leaning forward, waiting for what might happen next.

It's not a perfect movie, of course, not by a long shot.  There are some scenes that are awkwardly abrupt or disjointed, and the ending is far more predictable and uninteresting than the rest of the film.  And it's certainly the type of movie that requires some willing suspension of disbelief.  If the idea of psychic connection seems ridiculous to you, I'd steer you away from this one.

The two are drawn together in fatalistic fashion, while Claire's mind disintegrates, and her family is obliterated. Sound like fun? I first saw this gruesome little chiller back in '99.

66572,3,0783235410,"I caught this movie on the LMN tv station so I don't know if they took anything out.  It's typical of the movies they show on LMN.

The basic idea is pretty good.  Someone who can invade another person's mind and control their dreams.  But the invader can not only control Claire's dreams but also show her the past and the future.

The invader is someone who escaped from a mental institution.  Claire ends up in the same hospital and then eventually relives exactly what that guy did 25 years earlier.

This was all caused by that bad guy so he could eventually meet up with Claire and start a new family since his original family life wasn't that great.

I guess how much you will enjoy this movie depends on how much you are willing to let your imagination run wild and ignore the utter impossibility that something like this could ever happen.  Since we know it could never happen the only thing left to enjoy is the story and the acting.

The movie has an atmosphere of dreariness and despair.  It seems like the weather is overcast every day.  Many of the scenes are set in an insane asylum and an old cider mill which somehow still has apples in it although it seems to have been shut down for many years.

The ending is at least consistent with the rest of the morbid story.

66598,2,0783235410,"Movie: *1/2  DVD Quality: ****  DVD Extras: ***

Don't be fooled by the pedigrees of the distinguished cast and crew members; ""In Dreams"" is without doubt THE career low for director/screenwriter Neil Jordan as well as actors Annette Bening, Aidan Quinn, Stephen Rea, and even Robert Downey, Jr. (who's made a handful of turkeys throughout his rollercoaster career).  The film aspires to be a psychological mystery-suspense-thriller in the vein of ""Psycho"" and ""The Silence of the Lambs"", but is completely undone by a cut-and-paste script filled with unlikeable and unbelievable characters; uninspired direction; shallow performances; choppy editing; and a grossly ineffective musical score.  Only one scene in the movie is played convincingly, and that's the one in which Annette Bening finally begins to go over the edge mentally; pitching her voice in a lower tone and undergoing swift changes of emotion, Bening gives a brief and tantalizing glimpse of what she might have been able to achieve with a similar character in a better movie.  Unfortunately, that one scene does not make the chore of sitting through the other 97 minutes of pretention and tedium worthwhile.

In terms of technical quality, the DVD presentation of this bomb is more than acceptable.  Picture quality is clear and sharp; the sound is a bit fuzzy in one or two spots, but that may have been the intent of the filmmakers - I was so bored and so eager for the movie to be over that I didn't stop to replay the bits of dialogue in question.  The DVD extras are so-so: thumbnail cast and crew Biographies that mention much better movies; several lackluster screens filled with ""Production Notes""; and finally, the Theatrical Trailer, which is probably the best thing on the disc because it's short and features quick flashes of the film's visual highlights.  ""In Dreams"" is not recommended viewing, even for those viewers who enjoy bad movies for their camp value.",1105142400,2,1941,5.0375
66599,3,0783235410,"Note the going used price for this movie: 14 cents. According to imdb.com IN DREAMS cost $30M to make, and so far has reaped $11.9M. What does this mean? This film will appeal to lovers of the psychics-who-predict-murders genre.

Personally, I love movies that involve precognition. But, where this film goes wrong, is in the assumption that we don't already know this genre. So many of the situations here are cliche. Example (warning, partial spoilers here) no one takes Claire's visions seriously, until someone dies, and even then, she's locked up and can't communicate appropriately or in time to prevent the next tragedy. While you may argue that this formula fits the genre, the characters I just don't buy.

There's a dream interpreter, who doesn't interpret dreams. He just sits and listens, nodding his head without comment. This is very disturbing stuff that Claire is telling, and all the doctor can offer is thorazine!

And this serial killer Claire has a psychic connection to. Are we supposed to empathize with him or not. She's more concerned about him, at times, than her own family. And then, she hates him, and then feels apathetic towards him, and then sympathizes with him and then- (the over-the-top end sequence they should've cut from the film.) How am I supposed to feel about this freak - this kidnapper of children. The movie shows what a tough life he had - and then you're supposed to hate him. What?

Good things about this movie: The film starts off with a great premise - an idea (involving the making of a dam) which could have been the subject of a movie in and of itself. The photography is excellent. Sound design and editing is good - the pacing is such that - it smooths out any rough spots in the story.

Bad things: the acting, and the script (or should i say, the lack of believability in any of these characters). The overall story is decent. Fun. But standard thriller. But I get no sense, whatsoever, that Annette Bening is the mother of Katie Sagona. Nor do I get the feeling that Aidan Quinn is Bening's husband. Why? All the dialogue is too cleanly spoken. All too perfect. And not real.

These are NOT candid moments here, of a family slowly being torn apart - due to Claire's nightmare visions. No.

There is a scene designed to make you feel the strong love between mother and daughter. (shot beautifully against the afternoon sun by a lake) Claire [Annette Bening] and Rebecca [Katie Sagona] recite lines from SNOW WHITE to each other. How poignant. It was intended to be. But, it plays like two strangers hired to be nice to each other in front of a camera.

Sagona notes in one scene that her goldfish died, and it now resides in the freezer. The line is delivered with no emotion. You get the feeling there never was a goldfish, nor did she ever care about it - whether it was in the bowl or in the freezer.

Granted, I'm being harsh on a child actor here, and that's not fair. However, ALL the scenes play as if they were well-photographed footage of actors reciting words. Words with no meaning behind them. The only scenes that play tolerably well are the ones without talking.

I like Bening as an actress - but in this film, she's forced to act hysterical, again, and again, and again - and so much of it seems unmotivated, or covers up the lack of a character. It's as if director Neil Jordan gave Bening little or nothing to work with - (like: 'you are grieving during this scene') and she had to do the best she could - concocting something from obvious voids in the script.

The movie is too clean. Too expensive. One feels it came out of a glossy magazine. There's no grit to it. The actors involved in this production looks too well-fed, and too well-paid to have any appreciation of the horrors a clairvoyant person could experience in such a devastating situation. There's no empathy. And as a result, it's very difficult to empathize with any of the characters in this pulp story.",1092873600,5,3948,4.59375

From the opening credits - where a ghost town becomes submerged as a reservoir to the jump-out-of-your-seat ending, this one is a real keeper.

Had it not bothered with as linear a storyline and just followed the dream-logic plotlines it may have been hailed as a David Lynch-like fairy tale nightmare; add more violence and it could be a Dario Argento film.  But instead we have something by Neil Jordan, who gives this film more wonder and magic (albeit dark) than anyone else could.  I think it's a great film.  See, it's called In Dreams, not In Logic.  Its surreality is its strength, staying visually spectacular at all times and boosted by an absolutely great performance by Annette Bening.  I think the plot contrivances are almost subversive; OF COURSE there are moments of coincidence because that's what happens in dreams.  Moments of opportunity or clarity (claire-ity?) arrive for our heroine and she takes them in stride.  The film's general feel is continuously reinforced by the eerie flooded dream village in the reservoir, and the fairy tale orchard.  This is a Grim tale alright, but its beautiful, trippy and saturated in atmosphere.  Killer ending too, closing a disturbingly satisfying thriller by a masterful director.  Highly recommended for those who like to dream.",1078358400,11,1246,5.029268292682927
66602,5,0783235410,"The fabrics from which dreams are woven can be horrendous, and more catastrophic still when the visions return to the fertile grounds of your mind night after chaotic night. This point is made even more pronouncedly when the dreams happen to be about things that are occurring or are going to happen, especially when they teeter on the edge of insanity, or, as is the case with Claire, on areas that hit close to home. For several nights now she has been seeing visions of an apple orchard and a figure leading a little girl through it, leading her to believe that the child in her mind might well be a little girl that has gone missing. So, with an outstretched mentality, her mind goes searching, looking for something which she can clamp onto. Unfortunately for her, the mirror sometimes has a darker side, one that can peer into the mind that dreams visions, and that hands that can effectively whittle away many of the pieces that lead a person toward happiness, security, and the warmth that we like to call home.
In dreams had some beautiful depictions within it, capturing the aura of a town floating beneath waters unleashed by river diversion, showing a person in the first few minutes that it had a surreal feeling to it and that there was the ability to seem frightfully eerie running laps through its veins. This was further accented by the visions that were seen throughout the film, those of children and a past foretold in the shadows of a nursery rhyme wearing a shroud of insane speech and garble imagery, keeping its viewer enmeshed in the tale that was being portrayed upon the screen. It also seemed to have a storyline going for it that was interesting until the final chase that is inevitable begins to ensue, dragging on for a time before leading toward a vindictive ending that leaves everyone shattered as sprawling in the dust and that makes up for the duration of the run. This was an interesting ride, too, because getting a handle on what exactly is going to happen is a bit hard until alter in the movie, and then its all apples from there.
Combine this with the acting, which was done beautifully, the fact that the movie was something containing portions that entranced me within their bleakness, and the madness in the eyes of a Downey seems somewhat believable int he role, and you have something that is worth watching and that does the book its based on, Doll Eyes, a fair amount of justice. It'll make you question all the delightful dreams that manifest within your mind!",1045008000,23,2510,4.642696629213483
66603,3,0783235410,"What is so surprising about In Dreams is that so many talented people got lured into it. This has to be another case where a lot went wrong between a promising script and the finished product. The renowned producer Robert Evans once remarked that the biggest problem with movies today is that too many are made by a committee, rather than by individuals. Perhaps that is the problem here.
Annette Bening plays Claire Cooper, who lives in an ordinary town, but who has an extraordinary gift. She is psychic. This is not something she wants in her life, but she is unable to escape it. She has recurrent nightmares about a young boy who, tied to his bed, tries frantically to escape when water begins to fill his room. At the same time, a series of murders begins to occur in the town. She knows her dream is somehow related to them.
There are the usual elements of such fare. No one believes her. Her husband is convinced that it's really mental illness. The audience is given enough clues to know that she isn't a fake. There are scenes that make us jump. At times the tension builds, especially in the eerie underwater sequences.
Several great movies, such as Rosemary's Baby and The Exorcist, have been made from premises as absurd as this. After all, the best pictures cause us to get so caught up in them that we temporarily lay aside reason and logic. In Dreams tries hard, but it's rarely able to do that.
I think the main problem is that, unlike the movies I mentioned, there is not a whole lot to make us care that much about Claire. It isn't the acting. Bening is professional and convincing, as is Robert Downey, Jr. as the strange Vivian Thompson. Scenes which would bond us to her emotionally are absent. It is always convenient to blame the director. Respected director Neil Jordon certainly hit a career low point here. In this case, I think he didn't have enough to work with. Like a chef, a director can't whip up something delectable if he hasn't the right ingredients.
In Dreams makes a decent ""popcorn"" movie. It is simply not up to the standards of the people who worked on it. All of them will recover and go on to bigger things. If the production was run by a committee, I'm sure it's disbanded.",1016841600,5,2217,4.503722084367245

Stephen Rea - I swear to God his performance was so wooden, I doubt he even bent at the knees as he crossed the screen. The Cinematography is lovely, especially the underwater town (I'm a diver) but the story really goes awry, the characters show little concern for the plot, and Robert Downey. Jr plays Psycho like Bob Dylan, sans Guitar.  The finale is straight out of a soap opera (did they run out of film, couldn't afford a less hammy performance?)

66629,5,0783235410,"I'm a die hard Robert Downey, Jr. fan, so I typically rent any movie that he's in.  I got ""In Dreams"" expecting a run of the mill, Scream-esque horror movie.  What I got was the best thriller I've seen since Halloween H20.
In a movie that brilliantly revolves around a type of Snow White theme involving apples, Annette Bening plays Claire Cooper, a woman haunted by clairvoyant dreams.
When a gender shifting killer (Robert Downey, Jr.) invades Claire's dreams, his plans are conveyed to her and wreak havoc on her life and family.
Claire slowly goes insane as the killer, Vivian Thompson, feeds her clues to his next killings bit by bit.  She slowly uncovers Vivian's terrifying story in a sequence of coincidental events.
The most chilling aspects of the movie are the least obvious, such as the haunting peace of the underwater town, the Northfield Reservoir, and the cleverly frightening insertions of the Andrews Sisters' song ""Don't Sit Under The Apple Tree"".  Also, Vivian's ""nursery rhyme"" is one that's been staying with me for a while, proving how good and genuinely scary this movie really is.",980553600,8,1105,4.893048128342246
66630,5,0783235410,"Perhaps one of the most evocative thrillers ever created for film, ""In Dreams"" is one of the most visually and psychologically stunning films that has ever come to the silver screen. It isn't very often that I can say this about a film and mean every word of it; even the best of movies have their flaws. Personally, I found this one to be quite flawless. The story and actors work together in every way possible to make the movie flow at a steady pace, and in the end, everything that is supposed to make sense does.
Annette Bening is Claire Cooper, wife of an airline pilot, mother of a little girl, and illustrator of childrens books. The family lives in a town that sits near a reservoir, which covers a ghost town that was abandoned in order for the reservoir to be built. Claire is beginning to have strange dreams as soon as the film begins, one being a little girl who is led into an orchard-like place full of apples by a long-haired individual. Soon after, her daughter is abducted from a school play, causing Claire to realize that the dreams she is having are visions of the future, believing that the killer is channeling them into her mind in order for her to find him. After they find the body of her daughter, Claire runs her car off the dam, ultimately surviving the fall and going into a coma for six months. During this period, she has visions of an orchard filled with apples, nursery rhymes written in blood on a wall, and a small boy tied to a bed in a room slowly filling with water. Going home from the hospital proves to be a bad decision, and after much mayhem, she is put into a mental institution, where she begins having dreams about the death of her husband. As the dreams keep coming, people keep thinking that she is crazy, until she finally escapes to find herself face-to-face with the killer himself, who has a dangerous surprise for her.
Little can be said to denounce the film; it simply is that good. What really keeps it moving are the macabre images of decay and death the pervade throughout the entire movie, keeping in touch with the sinister environment that is necessary for the movie's story. The images of the haunting dreams are the most significant, and these scenes are shot with poor color clarity and slightly soft-edged images to complete the sense of surrealism. The underwater photography used in filming the reservoir sequences is stupendous, and quite frightening as well. Moviegoers expect to see a sunken ship or marine vessel underneath the surface of water, but to see a town completely covered with water is a whole new ball game, a game that seems to have won. There is not an over-abundance of blood or gore in the film; scenes include a second-long shot of a dog eating a corpse, a man wearing sunglasses being stabbed in the eye, and a woman with slit wrists that hardly bleed.
The story is based on the novel ""Doll's Eyes,"" written by Bari Wood, and screenwriters Bruce Robinson and Neil Jordan, who also directed the piece, have done a masterful job in bringing to the story a sense of overwhelming suspense and uncertainty. The truly magnificent aspect of the story is that everything that happens in the beginning and middle will all be tied back together in the end, making for a very satisfying and involving thriller.
The performances by the actors also make the movie enjoyable. This is, without a doubt, the best of Annette Bening's films, encompassing even her performance in American Beauty. This is clearly her movie, as she will be the centrifuge for all that goes on throughout the entire experience. Robert Downey, Jr. is a perfect psychotic, his long, dirty hair and sensational eyes pierce right into the subconscious of those who see him act in this movie, the element that creates the upset in Claire's life. Aidan Quinn is a convincing husband, though I did not particularly care for the way in which the character of the husband is portrayed; he could've been a little more sensitive to his wife's feelings. Stephen Rea plays the doctor who refuses to give up on Claire, and he does a good job in carrying us with him in his quest for the truth, even if that quest picks up later than is needed.
Under the glorious direction of Neil Jordan, ""In Dreams"" is a perfect and almost sparkling example of terrific thriller-making. It may well be said that this is the best movie I have ever seen in a long time, simply for the fact that it is solid entertainment that never stops moving, even if its audiences cannot keep up.",977270400,9,4504,4.589330024813896
66631,5,0783235410,"Add Annette Benning to that long list of performances that didn't get nominated for, let alone, win an Oscar.  Annette is simply stunning in this Neil Jordan thriller that got lost in 1998 and did not receive the acclaim it should have.
""In Dreams,"" based on the book ""Doll's Eyes"" by Bari Wood, is a haunting, and sometime disturbing, film.  Annette plays a woman who has been haunted by strange dreams all of her life, sharing the life of a serial killer, played quite convincingly by Robert Downey, Jr.  Aidan Quinn plays her husband, and in a delightful but short role, Pamela Payton-Wright shines as Benning's sanitorium roommate, Ethel.
The film abounds in delicious imagery, focusing on apples and Snow White.  The terror mounts subtly, and is quite chilling.  When Annette learns the fate of her daughter, Rebecca, she gives one of the most effective expressions of grief captured on film.  Later, when she is being questioned by psychiatrist Stephen Rea, she blows you away with her attempt to be in control, when she obviously is not.  A totally stunning tour de force for Annette.
Her performance alone makes this a five-star movie, although I would have appreciated a more detailed explanation for why her character shares this psychic link with Downey.  Also, her relationship with her husband is not totally fleshed out.  And how did Downey's character survive living in an abandoned orchard?  Those questions' resolutions would have made this an absolutely perfect five stars.  But, nonetheless, ""In Dreams"" is the kind of thriller that stays with you even after the credits have finished.
Also, kudos to Jordan for his use of songs in the movie.  ""If,"" ""Ebb Tide,"" ""Don't Sit Under the Apple Tree,"" and Roy Orbison's title theme, are haunting and sure beats the rock crap we have to put up with most of today's movies.

This is probably the  best character I have ever seen Annette Benning fill. The story line is,  while unpredictable and not very ""realistic"" (for most skeptics  of the paranormal), new, original, amd exciting. All of the characters were  so odd (especially the disturbed young boy who almost drowned to death,  Vivian... who grows up to be a murderer). This movie deals with a lot of  serious topics, but only touches on them briefly. I think the director was,  in part, saying that insanity can result from some of the things he touched  upon in the movie, although the plot isn't meant to carry a message, but  tell a story. The hidden connection between child abuse and insanity should  be clear to anyone who ponders the hidden meaning of movies.
The story  itself is about a middle-aged woman who begins to have frightening dreams  about children being led to an apple orchard, and killed. These dreams  begin to appear as altered views of reality, when the woman's own young  daughter is abducted from a school play one night, and murdered. From this  point on, she seems to develop a haunting connection to the murderer,  albeit everyone believes that, at first, it is just the stress of her  murdered daughter propelling these ""delusions"". After awhile, all  of the people in her life begin to question her sanity, and she is locked  up in a mental institution. However, the dreams continue...",948412800,4,1654,4.881294964028777
