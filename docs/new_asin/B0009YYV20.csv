2343326,1,B0009YYV20,"Was VERY disappointed in this film when I saw it in the theater.  I was excited about the bands, because I LOVE most of the bands featured here, but the way it was filmed, I could not even get into the concert footage.  So grainy and amateurishly filmed...And the sound was so bad, I was shocked.  :(  I do not object to the basic idea of the film, but it just needed to be more interestingly presented with a genuine story with characters that we care about that just happened to have both elements(sex and music) in it.  ZZZ...So what about the ""real"" sex.  It's TEDIOUS because it's real.  It made me feel very detached while watching it.  I agree with the other reviews above, get either a porno film or the music bands' DVDs, or watch their music videos.  It would be better.",1133481600,13,780,4.361111111111111
2343327,1,B0009YYV20,"This was an extremely DULL film. Yes, the sex is real but whoopee. The characters are neither likeable nor engaging, the relationship between the two leads never progresses beyond the physical and even the musical performances leave a lot to be desired, since the sound and cinematography are so amateurish that you can't even appreciate or enjoy them properly. If you are hankering to watch people snort coke and watch concerts, then go home to have S&M-lite sex, or oral sex, or masturbate, then this movie might hold some appeal for you, so have fun with it.  But be warned: the actress in the movie is so hideously thin that watching her shirtless is almost as painful as watching Christian Bale in ""The Machinist"".  Since when were ribcages sensual?  That is just one of many reasons the sex scenes fail to make this movie enticing and instead actually make the film harder to watch.

This film could bring up interesting questions about the difference between pornography and art, but mostly it just made me want to leave the theater. If you watch it looking to get aroused, I suggest you find yourself some free porn on the internet instead -- it's faster, more effective and far more entertaining! ;-)",1132876800,26,1209,4.770334928229665
2343328,4,B0009YYV20,"I liked the sex. better that a lot of porn I have seen on the internet and cd's. However, the music was awful. Are those bands real?

Generally the camera work was interesting. I liked the way each scene was kept short and had a point that is different from other scenes.

I would have given this movie 5 stars...but the music brings it down to 4 stars.",1131580800,13,353,4.176470588235294
2343329,1,B0009YYV20,"Apart from the music and (to some extent) the sex, this film is incredibly boring. Ok, maybe it does deserve some attention because of the explicit sex scenes, but if that's what you want to see you might as well buy some quality porn. Anyway, even these ""hot"" moments tend to be rather tedious in the long run. The music is ok, but doesn't justify buying the DVD - buy the actual music instead. The acting itself isn't worth mentioning. There are to many endless scenes of Nothingness. Given that there was no script I have to say I'm not surprised. Ridiculous. Stay away.",1130544000,16,573,4.519230769230769
2343330,1,B0009YYV20,"This is a movie for the sexually liberated, media-articulate contemporary individual who doesn't baulk at the sight of sex. The relationship of the film's two protagonists is portrayed in austere and non-manipulative terms. It does not insult an intelligent youthful modern audience: the sex scenes are candid and very real, and we don't get heaps of sharp dialogue from two people pontificating over the nature of sex and relationships. This film simply shows the intense but ephemeral bond of two people united by physical attraction.

At least that's what I would have said if this film was any good. In fact I find it utterly insulting that anyone would think that I want to watch two bland characters going to concerts then having sex. That's it, that's the whole film! Wow, I'm blown away by its starkness and simplicity! No I'm not; I'm incredibly bored and a little bit angry. Oh look they're having sex again and it's quite graphic - how interesting and refreshing in its honesty. No, not really - unless perhaps you're a young dandy pretending to be intelligent and who hasn't come to terms with the brute facts of existence. Oh look, the two dullards have been to another gig and now they're having sex - again! Please, please stop! Can't we watch them playing Monopoly for a change?

Traditionally, objectors to this sort of film airily claim that it is boring. This is the acceptable unshockable-sophisticate alternative to condemnation on moral grounds. Well, this film was both immoral and boring: I object to this film on the grounds that it is morally wrong to produce such a boring film: it was made by people who have horribly confused interesting and clever with boring and erm, boring. The only way this film could have been better was if it was called '2 Songs' and its content and structure were amended accordingly. For a far more enjoyable and insightful film on relationships try 'One Fine Day'.",1130457600,32,1921,4.835866261398176
2343331,5,B0009YYV20,"Starting off with British guy Matt in Antartica, surveying the land, the movie is a flashback to his fling with an American girl named Lisa (Margo Stilley, who looks like a taller, learner Maggie Gyllenhaal). The two go to a great concert, have sex, go to a great concert, have sex, rinse, repeat 7 more times. Amazingly, even though you're only seeing the sex, you're seeing the reality of a relationship and able to see the emotions and feelings of both people from beginning to end. It's an interesting note to all those movies out there who try to show everything BUT the sex...maybe you're missing the real point.

Of course what really makes the movie a must-watch is the performances. One of a kind concert footage from some of my personal favorite bands, Franz Ferdinand, Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, The Von Bondies, Super Furry Animals and Primal Scream. If you're a fan of these bands, its like getting a bonus DVD of footage.

Be warned, the sex is real. No faking, no CGI. But it doesn't really feel like porn, least not to me. Winterbottom shots it the film on digital video, probably the best way to capture all the concerts. The film's a solid 65 minutes, just the perfect amount of time to course the relationship of two people in lust.",1128038400,37,1253,4.614349775784754

2343343,4,B0009YYV20,"Well, I would like to begin with talking a bit about the director Michael Winterbottom. I first saw his movie <JUDE> and madly in love with that.
Not just because there was Kate Winslet but there is this dark aura that makes his move beautiful and so not not to love.

And then I came to the point that it is not easy to buy his movies in Korea or US since he is working in England and the dvds are quite expensive- I usually buy them under 10$. (9.99$).
I only watched <IN THIS WORLD> a documentary of his.
And this is his third movie.

It is about this couple having sex life pushing to the limit. They love each other in a sexual way and they sines so bright from the beginning that I felt that it won't last long. That made me sad.
It was not all pornographic or erotic after all for me.
The mood the sad music made this movie already what it will be like.
Although they go to this concert like everyday which is a rock concert, their whole life is full of intensive sex and the director shows them all.

And finally the girlfriend who is originally came from the US tells the boyfrind that she is leaving to the US, the last day when they have sex, the director even shows us the actual penetration shot I think using the body double.

So what does the director wanted to show?
I think it's about a couple who shied too bright that cannot last long.
If you see the movie <BLADE RUNNER> the creator of the cyborg says to the cybor that if you shine too bright, you cannot last long.
This couple is the same.
This couple does have sex like as if they will kill each other.
They feel the spot everyday I don't even know how.

The lady even tells the boyfriend that her bosoms are so flat and she looks like a tomboy which she don't like it at all. But as seeing her body she is having a perfect shape.
The man has a decent body and doesn't look ugly.
They could have lived forever happy.

But it was the woman's choice to depart to her country.
Maybe she knew that this relationship couldn't last forever.

This movie was sad to me because from the beginning I kind of felt that they won't last long.",1464220800,,2102,4.137254901960785

2343353,5,B0009YYV20,"As a Christian, I mistaken thought this was about a church choir group.

Well, it is not. There are some very un-Christian-like things that go on in this film. There's nudity and graphic sex and a short man with a very very large ""thing"" that squirts a milky substance all over his stomach after this woman uses her mouth on it.  I did not understand why she would do that. Not Christian like!

Now, my husband is a pastor, and he and I would like to have an active life in the bedroom (with the lights off of course), but he's too frequently on the road spreading the good news with his God-based all-male review/dance team. They're called ""God's Plowing Seeds"" and they try to plant the Good News in non-Christians wherever they can.

Frankly, it seems like he spends too much time with them. There's this one member of the team and his name is Parker and I don't know what his problem is but we do NOT get along. And he's always calling and texting my husband very late into the night and my husband will just disappear for days and come home and I'll be all like ""where were you for three days?"" And he'll be all like, ""I was at Parker's. He's having a God crisis!"" And what can I say to that?

2343366,1,B0009YYV20,"Is it art? Or is it pornography? It certainly is not obscene. Many years ago in college I worked part time nights clerking in an adult bookstore to help pay my bills. I've seen a lot of porn. This is porn, masquerading as an art film. The story line is weak. The film rides (no pun intended) on the sex scenes. The actors and the director say they wanted to see if they could push the envelope so to speak and substitute real sex acts for the usual simulated ones shown on TV and in film. Turns out they could. One is left to ask, ""So what?""

But you can only listen to so much rock music and see the same two people having sex so many times before you simply must hit the fast forward key. You do not need to be a good actor to have sex on film. You just have to have the courage (or lack of personal self esteem) to do it. The sex scenes actually might have been better if they had been directed by a professional porno director instead of the amateur in the field who did this.

I should tell you there is little you will not see and often in close up. His tongue as he performs oral sex on her. His erect penis, her love making with some sort of toy. Anal sex performed on her. And near the end, she graphically fellates him to an orgasm that she aims at his stomach. (The scene is so badly edited to get to the ""shot"" you can see the cuts.) The players rejected two requests from the director according to later interviews. He declined to engage in any sex with a man. (Something about his male ego I suppose.) And she declined to actually consume his bodily fluids in, as they say in the porn industry, the ""money shot."" It seems that they each had some limits after all.

Oh, it's interesting in the sense it's a voyeur's delight. But if you are looking for erotic stimulation you'd be better off just getting a real porno movie that caters to your specific tastes and be done with it. In the end they did get their general certificate in Britain. The censors basically said it was vulgar but not obscene and that I agree with. But the only clips you can find on the internet from this abomination are on the usual hard core sites. No one cares about the rest of the film.

In typical fashion, Mr. O'Brien went right on with his career. After all, society views him through the lens of a double standard, since he is clearly the stud. He was about 31 when he made this film and Ms. Stilley 21. She had never acted in film before. And therein lies a sad tale.

The director had agreed to keep her real name confidential.. Of course it wasn't long before her real name was public and she was bombarded with humiliating demands for interviews. Then reporters showed up on her parent's door step in South Carolina. Unfortunately they thought she was in Milan modeling clothing. They had no idea she was not only Unclothed, but performing various real sex acts on film with a man she had never met until she took the part. In short, she was used. While she has had some roles over the ensuing years, her career has never really amounted to much. In best double standard fashion, she's the one who bears the stigma such as there may be, as the unknown girl who did O'Brien on film.

In the end, they all proved what they set out to. That you could film real sex scenes and still be able to market the film. And one and all agreed that they had pushed the limits while remaining very professional. As Mr. O'Brien said, ""It's just sex."" He's right. And pretty dull sex at that.",1427155200,4,3476,4.243202416918429

2343382,4,B0009YYV20,"If you're looking into this movie, then chances are you are a film buff. I'm sure you've seen all the mainstream flicks (at least most of the good ones) and now you're searching the fringes of the movieverse to find something new and obscure. Well 9 SONGS fits that category fairly well. And if you're familiar with films, then I'm sure you've seen the Paul Thomas Anderson classic Boogie Nights. If not, go back to your watch list. I really think you overlooked one! But in that movie, Burt Reynolds is a pornography director who dreams of making porn with a story so good that it will excite people's minds as well as their loins! And if his character had existed and were still making films to this day, I'm sure that 9 Songs would have closely resembled what he'd be directing now. 9 Songs contains graphic nudity and real sex actually performed by the two lead actors. The only difference between this and actual porn is the way its shot. Its photographed in a way that's very pleasing cinematography-wise (and not like a shaky Mini-DV clip you find on pornhub.com). Its filmed with careful attention to details and resembles a lot of early 2000's movies like City Of God (only with much more genitals). However this movie isn't perfect. The story is very simple, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but when the filmmakers find the need to splice in elements of a concert film that doesn't really push the story forward at all, it starts to get a little annoying after a while. You get the feeling that the only reason they were included at all was to give the movie its barely feature length running time. I just found myself fast forwarding through most of those parts. But it is what it is; a pretty well shot flick with plenty of good sex, a story simple enough not to get in the way of their good sex, and misplaced music videos that interrupt all the good sex they could be having! So if you like to watch porn, but the little cinematographer inside your brain keeps complaining about the way they're shot, then 9 Songs is just for you",1393113600,,2048,4.508064516129032

 The film is simply a love story between two people who meet one summer in London: one is an American woman drifting through London and the other a handsome young lad who works on ice glaciers. Their love is short, yet so real as is shown in the explicit love scenes which are real. Is this is porn film? By no means, but it is a love story that shows the emotions that connect two humans and we as an audience are along for the ride to see what true love is about.

 The story is strong, the performances brilliant and the film is only 67 minutes in length, something I wish could have been extended.

 There are interviews with the main actors and music from the groups who do the songs in the film.

2343408,4,B0009YYV20,"A film about four of my favorite subjects: sex, drugs, rock 'n' roll, and Antarctica, not necessarily in that order. What I find most to like about ""9 Songs"" is its down-to-earth honesty and almost total lack of pretense. The story of a sexual relationship between two refreshingly normal human beings is framed by concert footage with emphasis on the shared experience of the audiences, and brief glimpses of the remote Antarctic ice fields, perhaps the loneliest, most isolated places on the planet. The simple mundanity of these lovers' lives comes as a big breath of fresh air after so many over-blown pretentious artsy-fartsy, supposedly ""erotic"" films about emotionally damaged people (""Wild Orchid,"" ""Lie With Me,"" ""In the Realm of the Senses,"" ""Romance"" to name but a few). While the sex here is extremely explicit, it's hardly adventursome or kinky and definitely NOT pornographic. This is erotica (yes, there's a big difference). These are real people with names, feelings, emotions and normal-sized body parts, imperfect and unenhanced, making love the way real people make love, sometimes passionate and ferocious, more often warm, gentle and unhurried. So, if you're a humorless prude uncomfortable with intensely sexual subject matter, you have my profound sympathy along with the advice to avoid this film. (Also, please stop trying to ""write"" your priggish, ignorant semi-literate screeds in the form of ""reviews"" of films you should have had the good sense not to rent or buy in the first place.) If, on the other hand, you like honest portrayals of real people sharing moments of celebratory intimacy, some decent contemporary ""underground"" rock, and subtle unobtrusive art, I highly recommend this picture.",1342742400,2,1725,5.276363636363636

2343410,3,B0009YYV20,"The introduction of explicit and realistic treated eroticism into art cinema (And perhaps some day into more mainstream cinema is much to be desired.  9 Songs is another movie in this direction.  A couple meet at a concert and the movie documents the progress of their relationship through a series of conversations and sex scenes alternating with attendance at rock concerts where 9 cutting edge rock bands perform (It's almost worth it for the music alone).  As it becomes apparent that their relationship will not last the sex scenes become more explicit as if to suggest some attempt at compensation for the declining connection on the emotional level, the inevitability of separation, or perhaps to suggest that the physical dimension is increasingly all that really works for them.  The sex scenes are erotic with out being forced or overblown and acted with sensitivity and authenticity.  However, it must be admitted that the story seems underdeveloped and schematic and one wishes that Winterbottom had found a way to amplify his theme a little more inventively.

2343411,3,B0009YYV20,"One of my favorite TV shows, ""Rescue Me"" has an opening theme song that I had never heard before.  A little research shows the song is called ""C'mon, C'mon"" by The Von Bondies, an American rock band formed in 1997.  They also appear in this short, 70 minute movie.  Here's the premise:  Two 20-somethings, an American woman (Margo Stilley, ""How to Lose Friends and Alienate People"") visiting England and a British glacial scientist (Kieren O'Brien, ""Goal!""), somehow meet (at a rock concert I think) and hook up back at his place.  They go to another concert, then back to his place for...yep, sex.  Now that's about it.

There are shots of Antarctica spliced in once and a while as our dude compares the icy continent with relationships in a voice over.  What of course, makes this film different is that the sex is...real.  No, I'm not kidding.  Now it's not the hard core ""Vivid Production"" type sex, nor is it SkinaMax, soft core sex, but real romantic bedroom sex.  Unfortunately the rock concerts are shot a mile away,  I guess to show it from our character's perspective.  This certainly doesn't help the rock bands, most of which are well known (Franz Ferdinand anyone).

Back to the bedroom.  While our couple enjoy each other, clearly, it's all physical.  Certainly the young American, while smittin with the Brit, isn't in it for the long haul.  The movie is kind of cold, yet pretty realistic and certainly doesn't pull any punches in the bedroom.

In case anyone cares the film is in Blu ray with a 1080p resolution and a 1.85:1 aspect ratio.  While a step up from DVD it isn't by much.  I suspect that wasn't a big concern to the producers.  It is clear enough however to decern the American's efforts at shaving her lower regions and the Englishman's circumcisional (is that a word?) status.

2343417,2,B0009YYV20,"9 Songs was released a few years ago and is infamous for being a rare major motion picture in which all of the sex is real instead of simulated. I rented it a couple of days ago from Netflix. A female American student is in England attending college where she meets a male English scientist at an indie rock concert and has sex with him after the show. They begin a relationship in which they go to an indie rock concert, have sex, go to another indie rock concert, and have more sex. Over and over until they break up when she has to go back to America. The sex itself was supposed to tell the story of their relationship, and I guess it did.

These indie rock bands  (9 real bands who were apparently thrilled to be featured in the movie) are all so incredibly boring and in my opinion not at all masters of their respective instruments. The sex, although explicit and real, was too artistic and shadowy to be very exciting. Also I didn't think the ""actors"" (if you can call going to concerts, having sex, and improvising bad dialogue ""acting"") were very good-looking. As I have already said there was no plot and the characters were uninteresting. You combine crappy music with boring sex, and I was somehow falling asleep while watching one of the most sexually explicit movies ever made. I ejected the DVD after watching little more than half of the movie. I had no interest in finishing this boring piece of garbage. I sealed it in the Netflix return envelope and mailed it the next morning.

2343428,3,B0009YYV20,"watched this the other night, and wanted to just say a few things.  I liked it.  It wasn't the greatest, deepest movie I have ever seen.  Did not have much of a story, guy who has a isolating job goes to London to see some rock bands and meets a young free-spirited girl, who he ends up having a sexual fling with that lasts about a month.  Another reviewer said they were so unattractive.  I am not sure why anyone would comment about their attractiveness, but I thought they were alright.  There is a lot of sex in this movie, and nothing to imagine here, everything is pretty much out there for all to see, so if that bothers you, then you might not enjoy this movie.

I know a lot of people did not like the movie and felt it had no point and was boring.  I did not think it was boring.  If you could accept it for what it is (just a snippet of time in the life of this guy and one relationship he had with a girl he met in London), then I think you might be able to enjoy it more.

Some people complained about the quality of the music; it was alright.  If you want a little more indepth about the bands, they have a little more detail on them in the special features section of the movie, which I thought was good.

 I was interested in how this couple interacted when they first met and first  became intimate, and how this progressed (or regressed) by the end.

There is an energy you can feel, if you go to these kinds of shows (I saw the Libertines in NY a few years back) that is interesting, and I did feel that here also during the shows in the movie.

 So, to sum it all up, if you can just let it flow, and not have any pre-conceived notions about what this movie should be, and you enjoy live rock band music and that whole energy and vibe, then I believe you can enjoy watching this movie.",1286150400,7,1806,4.070821529745042

Hence if you are looking for a love STORY, skip this film.  Rather it's a portrait (viewed after the fact) of a brief passionate relationship between a glaciologist and an American drifter.  The whole movie consists of a series of flashbacks covering sex, a little in the way of drugs, and a lot of music, mostly rock and roll.  At the same time the movie has a tenderness and artistry that well exceeded my expectations.  This is not a porno flick (despite the real sex acts on film).

Although the acting is very good, what makes the movie come alive and touch the viewer is the camera-work and editing.  The flashbacks of the sex scenes are brief, like recollections in real life, and they are interspersed with other memories and music, and the occasional flash to the present, where Matt is working in Antarctica.  The music (including a haunting piano solo commissioned for a different film but reused here to great effect) lends a set of additional contrasts which add depth to the movie.

As a note about the music.  The nine rock concerts contrast with the Michael Nyman piano pieces, particularly ""Debbie"" (originally written for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wonderland/dp/B000056N2Z/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wonderland</a>).

Nyman's music adds a great deal of tenderness and humanity to what might otherwise be just a steamy set of sex scenes.

2343431,5,B0009YYV20,"Anytime I come across a unique film I'd like to see, I'd add it to my list of ""Movies to Watch,"" aka ""Movies I'll Probably Never See."" However, with an impulsive grab at a Netflix free trial, I decided to knock a few off of this list, and one of them was 9 Songs.
The basis of the film is two young lovers, constantly engaged in acts of sex with interludes of live rock music.
With this description, I'm sure you're either turned completely off or on, so let me elaborate.
The title 9 Songs represents the nine songs that play in the movie (and I do give the director props for choosing these bands.) The ""set"" consists of the following:
* Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, ""Whatever Happened to My Rock and Roll""
* The Von Bondies, ""C'mon, C'mon""""
* Elbow, ""Fallen Angel""
* Primal Scream, ""Movin' On Up""
* Dandy Warhols, ""You Were the Last High""
* Super Furry Animals, ""Slow Life""
* Franz Ferdinand, ""Jacqueline""
* Michael Nyman, ""Debbie""
* Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, ""Love Burns""
In between each song is the love-making of actors Kieran O'Brien and Margo Stilley. And this isn't just jack-rabbit humping or waist-up action; this film shows it ALL.
Full frontal nudity, masturbation, use of a vibrator, oral sex, genital fondling, vaginal sex, bondage and graphic ejaculation all take place in this film without skipping a beat. (Perhaps accounting for The Guardian naming it the most sexually explicit mainstream film to date.)
Due to the rarity of unsimulated sex in film, many have written this off as a porno, but I beg to differ.
Yes, the movie shows a lot of sex, but it's the realest sex you could ever witness on film. The female character is not your typical blonde bombshell with breast implants, shoving a penis between her boobs while making googly eyes at the camera. The male character doesn't just stare at the ceiling and say ""suck it"" while the camera zooms in on his penis.
In the same sense, scenes in this movie are not like what you see in Hollywood either in terms of sex. Sure, both characters are getting turned on, but they are not just panting sweatily in a constant position until the scene ends.
This movie is real for the obvious reason that these two people were actually having intercourse on film. But more so, it shows how different sex can be from one time to the next, and how while the act can certainly be raw an animalistic, it can also be amazingly sensual and full of tantric ecstacy when you really can see the other person.
It wasn't clear how long in the movie the two characters had been dating. Yet typically in relationships, people think having this kind of mind-blowing sex is impossible unless you are with someone for a very long time. Truth is, everyone is capable of feeling this sort of bliss with another human being, if only they let go of their inhibitions and learn to explore the body. You'll notice that both characters in the film focus mainly on pleasuring the other, while also freely showing the other what turns them on. I feel too many people in our society ""hook up,"" and than assume for the worst, or are afraid to completely let go.
The characters in the film may have had a short-lived romance, but it was one of such intensity that they'll never forget it.
In this way, I think the director did an excellent job of portraying the stages two people go through sexually, from getting to know one another's bodies and being fun and kinky, to helping each other achieve maximum arousal and seeing the person's spirit and body as one.
Winterbottom also portrayed today's typical rock concert extremely accurately in terms of how the audience reacts to a band, and I felt this was a brilliant example of how something like a rock concert can bring two strangers together and lead to a completely different out-of-body experience.",1270512000,8,3791,4.6177777777777775

I needed this film to provoke and awaken me. It did not. It felt like I was just looking at your average sexual relationship between 2 people who have barely experienced anything. tying one up and getting a lap dance from a women does not make a sex life cutting edge. mixing sexual adventure and sexual awaking with emotional & psychological warfare would have made the film really stand out and really mean something.just my little opinion.",1262217600,,817,4.311688311688312

They involve two people whom I would probably like if I knew them, they don't go in for arrogant or slutty behaviour and their lovemaking is not impossibly prolonged or athletic. And of course, it's not simulated. It may seem odd to praise a film entirely on the sex it contains but, given the paucity of similar erotica elsewhere, I find this one outstanding. I suppose one could rip the disc and edit out the concerts, though that would further dilute the sketchy story line that exists in the uncut version.",1258502400,3,674,4.532786885245901
2343436,1,B0009YYV20,"If Michael Winterbottom's 9 SONGS sounds interesting, trust me, it isn't.

There are apparently two selling points for this film. The secondary one is that it has ""exclusive"" live performances of nine songs by various artists including The Von Bondies and The Dandy Warhols. These performances, however, are shot with artless camera work and bad sound, and are worse than many amateur bootleg concert videos you can find on YouTube.

The primary selling point is that in this movie, the actors playing the young couple in love actually have sex. And it's shown in graphic detail. Quite graphic at times. Which means, I suppose, that it's a porn flick, in spite of its indie pretensions at examining the fluctuations of a romantic/sexual relationship, but it's a curiously passionless and unstimulating variety of porn at best.

Winterbottom's characters are unlikeable, which is allowable, but also uninteresting, which isn't. Watching them relate, in all ways, makes human relationships actually look off-putting.

There is little story here, and what there is is bookended around the song videos. It's as if the writer/director had so little story he decided to use the songs as filler material. The result, at 71 minutes, is one of the subjectively longest damn movies I've ever seen.

Every few minutes I clicked up the onscreen display to see how much time was left. It always seemed far too much, even at only three or so minutes remaining. At one point, I realized I'd actually picked up a book and started reading without thinking about it. That has never happened to me during any movie before. It was like my brain was seeking to bandage a wound in its stimulation.

Consider yourself warned. 9 Songs, in spite of its dull sexuality (I started to write carnality, but there's nothing truly carnal about it), is a complete bore. Watching a toaster will probably arouse you more.

I feel like my head's been wrapped in plaster. Time to go find something to awaken my senses again, because I think they gave up on me while watching this thing.",1252627200,6,2050,4.907514450867052

2343441,4,B0009YYV20,"This is a beautiful impressionistic film about an affair, as remembered by a scientist while flying over Antarctica.  He is remembering what will certainly be the great passion of his youth, the discovery of a perfect sex partner with whom he has nothing in common but their grinding, momentary love.  It is a fleeting, strictly limited merging, that is graphically portrayed (what the film will be remembered for, no doubt).

The film is less a story than a series of moments that flit in and out of his memory, ending abruptly and without much resolution.  It is more poetry than novel.  I don't know if, as some reviewers claim, it is portraying something deeper than nostalgic sex, but the images have great power.

Hopefully everyone experiences this kind of excitement and longing.  It is not meant to last, however painful it feels with the incredible ecstasies and imagined emotional highs before the horrible realization that you are building a fantasy together.  One can spend years feeling anger at the disillusionment that follows as well as fight its image of perfection when one enters a more mature relationship that entails compromise.  The young scientist seems to be at peace with it, so much as that is possible.

This movie is great at portraying that moment in youth, when the patterns in your life do not feel set but there for the making and discovery.  While I did not relate to the music in the film - after all, I am of the age when rock and roll was in its golden age - it adds mood to the film.

I'm glad somebody told me, because I thought it was just about an American nympho who hooks up with a somewhat naive Brit and uses him for sex, sex and more sex. When he hasn't the time, energy or inclination, she pleasures herself in as many ways as possible. One wonders why the character played beautifully by Kieron O'Brien, didn't think it strange that, in all the time they were together, he never meets any of her friends and doesn't know where she lives. I would have thought that for most people this would start alarm bells clanging, but not him. He falls madly in love with her, whilst she obviously has no interest in any form of relationship...just wants him for his more tham ample appendage! I found the 'ice' scenes somewhat confusing (although very beautiful) and in parts it reminded me of the scene in Women in Love where Oliver Reed wanders off into the snow to die. I wondered if perhaps that was what Kieron O'Brien was doing...although I  thought, 'don't waste your emotions on that stupid female'. Okay, bottom line...a beautiful piece of nostalgia with the songs; Kieron O'Brien...a great choice as he's not the stereo-typical, handsome male lead (great body though); Margo Stilley...I didn't think she was attractive enough or had sufficient 'charisma' to so totally hook anyone.

2343446,3,B0009YYV20,"9 Songs (Michael Winterbottom, 2004)

The first thing I have to do in this review is confess that after the third horrible music-video segment of the movie, I started fast forwarding through the concert footage. It somehow never occurred to me, as people were marketing this movie to me as ""literate porn"", that I should take the name of the movie seriously, and that fully half its length would be performances by some of the worst bands to come out of Britain in the past twenty years. (Really, people listen to Franz Ferdinand and enjoy it?) This, I watched over a third of the movie's sixty-seven-minute running time on fast-forward. But, on the other hand, it means that only about half of the movie's sixty-seven-minute running time is actually focused on anything that might be a plot, character development, etc. When it comes right down to it, it's a short film that grew into feature length thanks to the inclusion of the concert footage. I'm sure that were I to sit down and actually pay attention to the nine songs in question, they'd probably provide me with some sort of godawful musical roadmap of the relationship between the two characters whose relationship is chronicled here. After all, that's the kind of thing that Winterbottom so dearly loves, that sort of unsubtle symbolism. After all, when your main character is a glaciologist, and he's flying over the antarctic when we first meet him, if you're not taking that as a sign that the relationship in question will not end well, then perhaps you need to see a few more Michael Winterbottom films.

The basic plot of the movie, if you can call it a plot, is a depiction of the year-long relationship between Matt (Winterbottom regular Kieran O'Brien), the glaciologist mentioned before, and Lisa (Margot Stilley, recently of How to Lose Friends and Alienate People), a college exchange student. Basically, they have sex, go to a bad concert, engage in two brief conversations (and/or engage in one brief conversation and take drugs). Repeat nine times.

I will applaud Winterbottom for actually making a ""literate porn"" movie; the sex is very much a part of the storyline and never comes off as gratuitous, and both Stilley and O'Brien are good enough actors that the relationship seems genuine from beginning to end. On the other hand, one wag at IMDB said that this is just a notch above the ""porn dramas"" of the seventies (back when porn movies still had plot, character, etc.), and I agree with that assessment, though I don't necessarily attach the same derogatory meaning to it as does he. Where Winterbottom gets that notch is in keeping to this same storyline, keeping us with these same two actors, both of whom are obviously very good at what they do, and not making it boring (or as boring as most porn films, anyway). Perhaps that's the reason behind the concert footage--when compared to bad British drug-pop bands, the sex is positively enchanting.

Many have remarked on the complete lack of character development here, but I'm not so sure a lot of critics didn't miss the point here; it seems to me the characters are shown in such a narrow window that the only character development we have a chance to see is in the purview of the relationship. Again, this is right in keeping with Winterbottom's sense of overbearing symbolism, and I'm quite sure it was by design. As such, we're supposed to take away from the movie that these people are their relationship, which depending on how you take it is either a shocking condemnation of the humanity of these characters or a (surprisingly) subtle dig at the porn industry. I'd like to believe it's the latter, but again, the former seems right in keeping with that Winterbottom sense of symbolism.

I don't want to make it sound like I despise all of Winterbottom's movies, or for that matter that I despised this Winterbottom movie in particular. Had I seen it on the big screen and not had a fast-forward button, to be sure, I'd probably be giving it a much harsher review. May I reiterate again how absolutely horrid the music in this movie is? (Why on earth is anyone still listening to Primal Scream, for the love of pete?) But these two characters are, if not sympathetic, at least flawed in ways that most audience members should be able to identify with, which should allow for at least some empathy. And they may be unlikable, but they're not bad people, really; we can root for them. As the characters, so the film.

This movie has no story.  This movie has no characters really, simply songs and sex.

This movie could've worked had there been an actual script, character development, and some cinematography.  There was none of that.

The concert scenes were uninteresting.  The sex scenes were cold and yet the audience is supposed to believe that Matt actually loves Lisa.  There's no emotion between the two, no sense of attachment, no feeling that they even like each other.

Many people argue that this movie isn't porn but I completely disagree.  I think the director had a vision that was good in his head but failed on screen.

With more sex (and much better cinematography) than late night HBO, Showtime and even `Skinemax,' 9 Songs is a hardcore art film with little in the way of plot or story and lots of hot, raw, steamy sex.

An official selection of film festivals around the world, I've been wanting to see 9 Songs since I missed it at Sundance. Having heard a lot about it, I had high hopes and was expecting to see a great story of love, set to the soundtrack of nine songs- the length of the movie. Having seen it, I can't say that I regret it, but the film itself didn't exactly knock me out of my boots.

Sociologically 9 Songs is very interesting. That someone (Michael Winterbottom) would make a film with actors engaging in graphic, real sex is certainly a statement on the time and society we live in and it's definitely not all bad. In fact, it was kind of interesting. The story- a man and woman's short (but very passionate) romance- was less enthralling and indeed parts of the film are confusing until (or unless) you watch the extras, explaining what the Antarctic has to do with a love affair in England.

Gloriously shot, the filming and camera work is beautiful, and the characters themselves are interesting; the actors did their job well. There's just little to hold the story together, save for the sex and concert footage dividing the film.

SPECIAL FEATURES

The special features- especially the interviews with the actors and director- bring the film together and raise the interest level greatly. Sharing why he made the movie and explaining some of the details left a bit vague in the film, Michael Winterbottom talks about the sex, the reaction, and the process of casting and filming 9 Songs. Both Kieran O'Brian and Margo Stilley also discuss their feelings on filming the largely unscripted film, dealing with the sex and its repercussions on their careers, and their experiences making the film.

Winterbottom also discusses the use of footage from live concert performances, as well as the bands' (and their respective management) relation to finding out that their music was being used in a sexually explicit film. The special features also include an option to watch a Concert Performance Only track, the Original Trailer and a featurette on the Bands from 9 Songs.",1221696000,2,2431,4.748815165876778

Why then does it cut to him in his short-term fling with an American girlfriend? Why are full rock and roll songs sandwiched between these sex scenes?

There's no cohesive story arc, but a plot isn't necessary. I watched it in chunks - they were like miniature movies, a little memory slice about a man's expedition to Antarctica, some scratchy Brit rock with bad acoustics (guy takes his girlfriend to concerts), and then he takes her home and does progressively sexual things with her.

This film does show full nudity for both sexes, sexual intercourse with penetration, very light BDSM such as handcuffs. But even then I wouldn't classify it as pornography per se. Another review calls it ""arthouse porn."" I think what makes it less pornographic is the fact that there's comfort and affection and cuddling involved.",1207699200,2,993,4.8698224852071

We don't have any compelling reason to care about either of them. I guess this is considered an art film because the lighting is bad, it especially gets bad during the explicit sex scenes. The story consists of having sex intermixed with rock concert scenes. Somewhere in there they insert a few minutes of some kind of documentary with clips of Antarctica.

The main problem I had was not caring about the characters. We get no real sense of them -- why do they even like each other? What is the attraction besides being physically nice to look at? Without any sense of that, watching them have sex never rises above the level of spectacle -- it's interesting insofar as there is some novelty in watching people actually have sex without the self-conscious and moronic trappings of standard-issue porn -- but I never felt moved or connected.

In this world the director used amature actors, I hear in Road to Guantanimo he did the same.  I can only asume that in 9 songs he used the same format because these two planks cant possibly be professional actors.

Much has been said in the reviews about the reliance on sex to underline the story and to be honest doesn't sex underpin much of our lives?

I like the fact that the sex is less overt at the start of the film; though it is happening we get only glimpses and teasing rather than a full on show (a likeness to those first exploratory forays with a new lover?), however as the couple relax further into their relationship the sex becomes more selfish and frank. By the final act of the film, as the relationship begins to fail, the sex is at it's most explicit (shown in sun drenched hues, lazy and slow - often the indicator of romance in films), but in this case the realty of boredom and routine.

I enjoyed the film though, like most, I found some of the sex shocking. But it made me think and, it certainly felt like a real place and not some cinematic creation.",1180915200,8,969,4.284153005464481

2343477,3,B0009YYV20,"I'm not sure there is much to say here.  Simply put, Michael Winterbottom has entered the world of pornography, at least partially.  Here, he has definitely made a very dirty film with very little else to say.  I'm not saying it offends me. Perhaps Winterbottom's 9 Songs comes off this way because it is about a relationship founded on and maintained by its sex.  We see Matt, a guy who does some work in Antarctica, meet Lisa, an American student.  Their relationship seems to be based predominantly on two things; a common bond with music and a common bond in enjoying sexual intercourse.  There is seemingly very little attachment beyond that and then the relationship ends when Lisa returns to the states.

The explicit sex scenes are intertwined with footage of rock bands including the Von Bondies, the Dandy Warhols and Franz Ferdinand, just to name a few.  I was tempted to praise the film for combining elements that are pornographic with a compelling story and somehow attempt to not be gratuitous.  I don't know whether to call the graphic scenes honest or exploitative, but I suppose they serve some purpose within the context of the story.  It definitely seems empty and bleak in their final scene together.  9 Songs portrays sex far colder and realistic than porn does.

I'm not sure that means it should qualify as good movie, but it certainly seems like an honest attempt to be original and bring elements like this into mainstream cinema, for better or worse.  The performances have been praised by some as daring but I have to say, any acting was pretty much a non-factor here.  I assume the performances are muted intentionally but they are either done so because the relationship portrayed is a bleak and selfish one or because the acting chops were just no there.  It really doesn't matter why because either way it conveniently and perhaps unwittingly works for the benefit of the film.  It is a glimpse into the very private lives of too people only associated by their lust.",1178755200,11,1999,4.767441860465116

It is a movie that captures people seeking connection, seeking warmth, and ultimately failing.  My eyes were moist when they said goodbye.

I truly celebrate art that isn't afraid to express the world through an adult's eyes, unbridled.  That said, this film contains sex between the lead characters, and it's all very sensual.  The story itself is rather bare, few lines, mostly told through the visuals of the couples' interaction and the lyrics of the nine songs.  It gave an interesting and sometimes painful look into the daily life of relationships.  Real bodies adorned these sheets.  Both the leads were attractive people but they were far from the caricatures we are inundated with in most sexually iconic films.  The realism of their bodies, passion, problems, and interaction carried the film.  The direction seemed sparse, as most of the dialogue was improvised, though I'm sure that careful attention to subtler details is what brought it all together.  The songs selected were for the most part familiar, playing out the role of narrator despite the male lead's infrequent injections of perspective.  In short, I liked this film.  I wasn't dazzled or left emotionally altered, except that I felt some deep satisfaction simply walking away from a film knowing that it was made for adults about sex.  Nobody was raped.  Nobody cheated (without consent, anyway).  Nobody suffered ill consequences as a result of having and expressing a healthy libido.  Apparently that's a tall order in Hollywood.

The movie was realistic in everyway (not just the sex) and earthy. The acting by the two actors was really something to behold and so was the cinematography.""

""It should be pointed out that the writer, producer, director of 9 Songs, felt there was a double standard regarding reading material vs film. He thought, since many erotic and even mainstream stories are extremely graphic, why can't mainstream movies also depict graphic sex. In comparison to the present day trend of filthy degrading pornographic films, 9 songs must seem extremely tame. Still, it is a big leap forward in sexuality from the average boring, poorly done soft-core movie.  Therefore, I'm going against the grain, and giving the movie 4 stars.""",1156032000,193,3163,4.568141592920354
2343493,4,B0009YYV20,"I liked this film. I bought the DVD because of its notoriety but with full awareness of the generally dismal reviews it received. It turned out to be a surprisingly sweet little film. Not much of a plot and not really a love story as such. It's more an experimental art film touching on memory - specifically the bittersweet memory of a lost love. A young Englishman remembers the short summer fling he had with a bright, vivacious, and beautiful 21-year old American girl. He obviously thought more of their summer tryst than she did. And when she leaves for home at the end of summer, he is devastated. He takes refuge in his work as a glaciologist, fleeing to the barren wastes of Antarctica. But if this film depicts what he thought of their relationship, it does beg the question, just how deep were his feelings towards her? If the only things you can recall of a relationship are the bouts of sex and rock concerts, that doesn't really say much for the relationship.

This film has been endlessly compared to porn by various critics, even by the official reviewer here on Amazon. I find the comparison rather unfair. Yes, it has explicit sex scenes which would not be out of place in a porn video. But that does not make it porn. Sex is a natural part of a relationship and a natural part of life. The film depicts it as such without apology and without shame. When the relationship is over, this young man thinks back and concentrates only on the sex because that, sadly but truthfully, was what was most important to him, much as he would like to believe otherwise.

The sex is hot. And more importantly, believable. Not the overblown silliness of porn. For people who have yet to see the film, make no mistake, everything is explicitly shown here, not lingering voyeuristically like in true porn but matter-of-factly like in a documentary. You see the couple engage in fellatio, cunnilingus and vaginal sex. And in a rare departure for a mainstream movie, you see the male partner ejaculate during fellatio. There are also 2 scenes where the young lovers experiment with mild bondage; blindfolds and tying down to the bed during sex. The actors are unknowns but they play their parts very well. Kieran O'Brien (Matt) looks like your average young London guy. Margo Stilley (Lisa) was in real life an American based in the UK and she is seriously cute.

I am not a fan of contemporary British rock music, so I endured the songs more than enjoyed them. But the believabilty of the intimate moments more than made up for it. The 9 songs recorded during 9 live concerts, act as chapter breaks between the bouts of sex.

The film was shot on Digital Video and is presented in its original 1.85:1 aspect ratio (enhanced for widescreen TV). Picture quality is fair considering the source material. Colours are strong and natural. Black levels are fine. Sharpness is satisfactory. Sound is available in both DTS 5.1, Dolby Digital 5.1 and Dolby 2.0. The sound is fair although rather lacking in Oomph for a rock concert, even when I did allow it get up to normal levels. I spent most of the time muting the volume during the rock concerts and boosting it to hear the dialogue. Optional Spanish subtitles are provided. There are about 30 minutes worth of interviews, 15 mins with Margo Stilley and about 7 mins each with Kieran O'Brien and director Michael Winterbottom. There are 5 separate music videos from the bands, The Dandy Warhols (Smoke it / The Last High), The Von Bondies (C'mon, C'mon) and Elbow (Intro-Meet the Band / Forget Myself). The film itself is playable as a concert only version, shorn of all the sex. I'm not sure who would want that but the option is there.

2343495,2,B0009YYV20,"Supposedly a film about 'modern love', ""9 Songs"" is the story of an empty relationship between an American student and a British scientist. Sadly, I was turned off already half-way through the movie.

One of the reasons was its music. I really can't stand these unoriginal hype-rock bands, like The Von Blondies, a blatant Cramps rip-off. The exception here is Primal Scream, with their uplifting contribution ""Movin' On Up"". The director might have used ""Movin"" to pontuate the ""love"" that Matt & Lisa felt for each other, though I suspect the song is actually about XTC & the ""Summer of Love 1988"" culture.

Aside the aformentioned bands, the sex scenes are pontuated with the poignant music of Michael Nyman. Which is totally odd. Nyman's ""dreamy"" music has absolutely no relation with the kind of sex the couple makes. There's no love there, no intimacy, no nothing. Is it purposeful irony, or is the director trying to tell us that, yes, there's love in that? I don't know.

And what about Lisa & and that dildo scene, where Matt just stands aside, watching? Pathetic. And sad.

Even their drug of choice is telling: coke. Coke is the most individualistic of all drugs, perfect for people who try to cover their shallowness by just talking too much - ironically, about nothing. Like Lisa (Margo Stilley).

Yes, director Michael Winterbottom might have intended this movie to be 'a comment on love today'. There's even some interesting metaphors, like the glacier scenes as an analogy of how Matt felt emotionally with Lisa. But ultimately, ""9 Songs"" doesn't satisfy too much. And most of the rock bands on the soundtrack suck.",1153958400,4,1631,4.894927536231884

2343498,2,B0009YYV20,"When the interlocutor of this movie comments, as he flies over Antarctica, that it is ""beautiful"" he sounds utterly unconvincing.  Neither he nor his partner are good actors, and that is a weakness in this film.

Their year long affair is viewed in retrospect as a series of sexual plays interspersed with live performances by up and coming British rockbands (the Nine Songs of the title).

It is certainly not pornography, though it is a sexy film.  Nor do I think it is art, because it addresses nothing, challenges nothing, explores nothing.

Quite honestly, it is like a home made video throughout.  And in that regard it has a voyeuristic attraction.  You feel that you are looking in on the private lives of two people.

It is not a great love story.  I don't even think it is a love story.  It is just a year of sex with someone else, and some loud concerts.

The coke snorting is gratuitous and unnesscessary.  It is nice to see someone use a condom in a sex movie, and it spoils nothing.  The cooking scenes are cursory and devoid of sensuality.

There was probably a good film in here, if anyone bothered to look for it.  There could be a theme about the transitory nature of love once the sex is removed, or a comment on how love must develop during the sexual exploration phase, or the relationship will die the moment the sex is removed.

There are potential themes here, and had they been explored it could have been an art movie, and one with a potential to outlive the hype of the sex.  But sadly, this film will only ever be remembered for the controversy of the real sex scenes.",1151884800,12,1596,4.467128027681661
2343499,5,B0009YYV20,"Some might consider this movie prurient, while to others it will seem sweetly nostalgic. Anyone who is looking at this review will already know that 9 Songs is famed for its full-on sex scenes. Some, however, will not be aware that it really is about the nature of memory and the waking-up to ordinary life's intangible fleeting beauty.

The main character is a British glaciologist through whose eyes, metaphorically, one ""remembers"" a relationship a lovely, egotistical, careless, charming, and crazy woman, not unlike the young women young men meet from time to time and with whom men try (unsuccessfully) to have a temporally enduring relationship.

Matt (Kieran O'Brien) is an ugly-handsome winsome working-class bloke made good in Tony Blair's New Britain. Lisa (Margot Stilley)is an American, obviously from what is called a ""good family"", curvaceously slim, statuesque (about two inches taller  than Matt), educated, and unserious about both her relationship with Matt and her job. As for her ""job"", though we don't see much of it at all, it's obviously just a time-marking ""playing about with typewriters and latchkeys and calling it work"", as EM Forster called the occupations of upper middle class twenty-somethings who receive regular checks from the family back home. She a good-looking 21 year old American woman in London with time on her hands, and a liking for men.

Glaciology is a key thematic element in 9 Songs. Antarctica is a metaphor for one's memory. The snow laid down in the center of the continent becomes ice, trapping bubbles of air inside it. Those bubbles are the continent's ""memory"" of the weather on a certain day, a certain year. As more and more ice is laid down at the center, the earlier deposits move inecluctably toward the sea, there to be ""calved"" become bergs, and finally melt, leaving no trace behind.

Apart from Antarctica, there's not a lot more than performances by bands like the Dandy Warhols, Super Furry Animals, and so forth. Nine songs sung in really fun-looking London venues, to be exact, and, of course, the famous scenes of the couple making love. The lovemaking is more inferred than depicted ofttimes, but taken as a whole one would doubt that there is even a square centimetre of the protagonists' anatomies that is not unmistakably displayed in all its glory for all the world to see in this movie. The sex, for the most part, has a quality of warmly relational authenticity that anyone could recognize as very distinct from exploitative porn. As a result, the viewer seldom feels terribly voyeuristic, but rather the director seeks for the viewer to experience a reflective nostalgia, redolent of times past - which is, of course, a function of memory.

HOWEVER, the title of the film does not, I think, refer merely to the ""songs"" sung by the bands. My own theory is that the auteur, Michael Winterbottom, is alluding to the Chinese 13th century Yuan Dynasty cycle of poems, The Nine Songs, which is in many respects about the Shamanic quest. ""Similar to the traditional shaman of Siberia, Central Asia and the Arctic, the wu enters into a trance state in performing ceremonies. However, unlike his northern counterparts, the Chinese shaman enters into a fleeting love relationship with the God (or Goddess)."" [taken from Zekeriyah's excellent review of the book of the same name on this site]

You see, this film is not only about memory, and what a guy remembers about a relationship with a woman he has loved (which guys being who they are, is mostly the perceived high points, like going to shows and making love), but 9 Songs also seems to be an extended metaphor for the Shamanic quest, which in the end requires union with the mysterious Beloved other, the mythological dakini, who both enlivens and kills her lover simultaneously and then simply disappears into the sky, and leaves behind (there's that word, memory, again) as her gift a precious, elusive realization of the ugly-beautiful reality of things-as-they-are.

With that in mind, see this movie. It's not really about sex.",1151366400,168,4057,4.9734513274336285
2343500,1,B0009YYV20,"If there's one thing I hate it's erotica that tries to make itself sound more controversial than it really is.  Yes the sex scenes are very graphic but they're over far too quickly and just not depicted very well in comparison to say Basic Instinct or Halle Berry in Monster's Ball... I know it's supposed to be a portrayal of ""real couples"" and the type of intimacy that you'd see in a real life bedroom but quite frankly I found the scenes rather boring in comparison to other films.  Furthermore while the male lead would probably be a wonderful bit of eye candy to female viewers (which is great as far as I'm concerned, it goes without saying that women should be treated to that kind of thing too not just men!) the female lead actress is not attractive at all, average face and far, far too slender... I think this is a deliberate effort on the filmaker's part - at one point the character asks her lover ""Do I look like a boy?"" - but the movie completely fails in it's attempt to make her appear erotic... I truly regret this purchase and will be trying to sell it again online to at least recoup some of the money I wasted on it.",1150761600,9,1138,4.313084112149533
2343501,5,B0009YYV20,"This unusual film has gotten so very little press--at least where I live--that if I wasn't a slave to Amazon.com, I wouldn't even have known it existed.

First, before anything else, this is not a film for kids or for those who find explicit, adult content offensive. It is unrated because the sex is real, not acting. Hence why edgy director, Michael Winterbottom, had to cast unknowns as Matt and Lisa, the lead characters.

Second, if you enjoy really good alternative rock music (and don't mind the adult content) you will love this film. With delicious live performances seen nowhere else from bands like The Dandy Warhols, Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, and Primal Scream, the music is damned good.

The premise of this film is a love story. Unlike 9 1/2 Weeks before it, 9 Songs is the everyman/everywoman unfolding of a romantic relationship, the stages it goes through, the way it ends, set against the backdrop of 9 live concerts attended by the couple.

The story's core, revealed by Matt, who is a scientist studying Antarctica, is that of what a relationship feels like from the inside out. While we see bold, stark glimpses of this forbidding continent, we hear Matt telling us that the wide open, endless ice of Antarctica inspires both claustrophobia and agoraphobia simultaneously, ""like being in bed with someone else."" That comment struck me like a bucket of ice water with it's unrelenting truth.

It has been suggested that Winterbottom is using sex as a storytelling device. This is true, but not the whole truth. Men and women will never change and though the explicit scenes may shock you, it is the man-woman dynamic at the heart of this film. The ways we communicate, or don't. The ways in which we meet. The manner that we use to walk away.

You can literally feel Lisa's sense of being trapped by the increasing intimacy--and accompanying responsibility of not willfully hurting her lover--when in a drug-induced mania, she tells Matt that sometimes when he kisses her, she wants to bite his lip hard, to draw blood. You can see what these words mean by his reaction. . .and his continued reactions to her increasing level of cruelty toward him. Petty, childishly making fun of him when least appropriate.

This is certainly not a film for everyone. However, if you enjoy indie films, edgy, dark and challenging concepts, 9 Songs will impress you. And, whether you like it or not, it will make you think about relationships; how they are created and how they are disassembled.

For me, I was stunned to silence by the elegance of the unpolished look at ""love,"" warts and all.",1150156800,21,2601,4.803131991051454

The sex scenes are not pornographic, but they are very erotic and exciting to watch.  This movie definately breaks new ground in many ways.  Unlike most hollywood flicks, this love story doesn't need to revolve around some silly, unrealisitc comedy or drama to capture your attention.  In fact, this one feels more genuine because it feels like reality... which isn't always clever and doesn't need to star Julia Roberts, Meg Ryan, or Tom Hanks to be worth watching.

What makes this film different is that the sexual desire is palpable.  It must also be the first time that ejaculation has been allowed to be shown in the non-porn movie industry.  I would not rate this as great cinema, but for a short highly charged bit of pure Eros it can't be beaten!",1145404800,19,701,4.410852713178294
2343504,4,B0009YYV20,"As far as this movie goes, it is what it is, and what the movie is about is the sexual relationship between a couple.  Therefore, I won't be too critical of either the acting or the story itself, because that was not what I was expecting when I saw this movie.  After initially stumbling across this movie while leaving a movie theater, I assumed that this movie must have had explicit sex given that the movie wasn't rated (a tactic studios use when they fear their movies might get the dreaded ""NC-17"" rating, a rating that would keep their movie out of certain theaters and markets).  As expected, the movie has sex scenes, but I was very surprised (and pleased) in the level of sex that was performed.

This movie, whose two lead actors were involved in an actual relationship in real life, leaves very little to the imagination, showing acts such as copulation, fellatio (including orgasm), maturbation, bondage and other methods of sex.  However, in spite of all the sex, the movie was tastefully done and shouldn't be classified as ""porn.""  When watching it, I felt as though I was a ""Peeping Tom"" seeing a real relationship transpire before my eyes.  I wouldn't be surprised if couples watch this film to get them in the mood for sex.

As far as the music (concert footage between each scene) was concerned (which I fast-forwarded past) was okay.  I guess the director used the music to compensate for the lack of a story.  However, I have to make an exception for Michael Nyman for his piece ""Nadia,"" a somber composition performed at an appropiate time in the movie.  The piece was beautifully performed and set the tone for the remainder of the movie.

Even though the movie itself was pretty good, the DVD doesn't perform well.  At first, when I initially rented it, I encountered many technical glitches while playing the DVD.  I assumed that it was just this particular DVD, but I discovered the same problems in another DVD that I purchased.  These problems are the following:
1) To get the disc to play the movie, you have to hit the ""Menu"" button on your DVD's remote control as soon as the DVD player begins to play the disc.  Otherwise, the player will not play the disc, citing a ""disc error.""
2) Once the main menu is displayed, you must select ""scene selection"" and then select the first scene to play the movie.  If you select ""play movie,"" you will get a disc error.
3) In the ""special features"" menu, only the ""9 Songs: The Music"" and ""Photo Gallery"" features are accessible.  All the other ""special features"" don't work, meaning that you'll get a disc error when attempting to play them (On my DVD player, I cleared the ""disc error"" by pressing the ""menu"" button on my remote control).

Overall, the DVD is pretty good, once you get past the DVD's flaws.  However, don't expect great thespian performaces.  After all, it is what it is.",1145145600,12,2861,4.625742574257425
2343505,2,B0009YYV20,"Most of us will watch this because we heard there was real sex in it. And the director doesn't leave any doubt as to whether it was real or not. Rumors of spur-of-the-moment real movie sex are part of Hollywood lore (as was the case with The Postman Always Rings Twice and Wild Orchid). Here, there's no doubt about it: yep, they're really getting busy! No body doubles or simulations, it's the real deal. That said, there's not much else going on in this movie. The concert scenes are dull and take up far too much screen time, and the dialogue stops just when it starts to get interesting. Of the film's 70 minutes, I'd say there's 35 minutes of real content, much like another sexually explicit recent film, The Brown Bunny. A message to directors: if you are going to have explicit sex, also make the movie have a point. 9 Songs has only the thinnest of plots. What little does happen is not explained very well. Why is the girl going back to America at the end? Was she cheating on her boyfriend all the time? That might explain why she never let him come back to her place (a detail that is only given to us at the end). Answering these questions might have made for a longer and more interesting movie. Hollywood somehow can't bridge the gap between making a movie about sex and making a movie about people who are having sex. If you want explicit sex, I suggest you rent some porn. If you want a movie that is interesting, rent a recent title like Capote or Munich or something else that is a real challenge. If you are renting this, it's for the sex scenes. And they're more of a downer than porn, which, for all its histrionics, usually lets its participants have a really good time, without a gray, English voiceover.",1145145600,7,1728,4.420062695924765

What will the film be remembered for though?  The sex of course, which is certainly every bit as explicit as you've heard.

Apart from a few amusing snippets of dialogue, I didn't particularly warm to the characters though. Matt is pretty dull and doesn't come over as intellectual enough to convince as a scientist, whereas Lisa is selfish, concerned primarily with her own pleasure.

Michael Nyman's piano piece was good (but irritatinly truncated). So what is there after the shock value of the sex?  Not a huge amount.

I expect viewers will buy this out of curiosity. Watch it once then cast it to the back of a drawer.

Sure it breaks new ground, and in that respect it has a certain importance, but it's no masterpiece.

Problem is the concert footage feels like a different film and has nothing to do with the relationship - so you watch it for the music, or you watch it for the sex, but not for both.  And the sex scenes, which are refreshingly honest due to them not being simulated, seem to go nowhere.  You know how drama has a beginning, middle and end?  How scenes in movies have a beginning middle and end?  well, all the sex scenes only seem to have a middle - nothing really gets resolved and you don't really get a feeling for the relationship.  They had a really great opportunity to make this a very interesting movie using sex to punctuate a deteriorating relationship, yet the movie missed it - so we just see these improved scenes and some light sex and a totally unbelievable sequence where the guy is supposed to be a climatologist in the antarctic.

The 2 stars(the ONLY stars)of the film are both attractive and likable and even though the sex is explicit it's not drawn out forever porno style and doesn't feature endless crude closeups.

I call this  a romantic movie about two people joined by their love of music, and the bands used in the movie are amazing. The songs become the soundtrack of their relationship. As far as the sex scenes, they are intense and just about every other scene involves some sort of physical encounter. They didn't make me feel as though I was watching a cheap porno, however, but more that it was a normal part of any relationship. I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys great cinematography, live music, or examinations of real relationships.",1134950400,16,898,4.577639751552795
2343522,3,B0009YYV20,"i gotta say that i give the director of the film credit for trying to come up with a piece of work that FULLY explores intimacy ALL THE WAY. But this film falls short particularly on the emotional level. The physical level it's all there but something is missing otherwise. I didn't feel anything for the characters to be honest after i finished viewing the film. You could tell the guy falls more deeply for the girl but you don't walk away truly touched by the story. At least i didn't.

All in all it was a good effort but unfortunately it falls short. Imagine what this film could've been.

oh and the guy well...he's nice. ;)",1134864000,7,630,4.3760683760683765

They both show complete beautiful satisfying sex with real genitalia. Great concerts. Great concept. Anarctica is perfect for cooling down after viewing. La Strada used to be my favorite movie.

8070619,4,B0009YYV20,"The film 9 Songs revolves around the love between an American college student named Lisa and a British glaciologist named Matt, played by actors Margo Stilley and Kieran OBrien. Premiering at Cannes, 9 Songs received both praise and criticism. The many unsimulated scenes of intimacy between Matt and Lisa caused The Guardian to declare 9 Songs the most explicit mainstream film in the United Kingdom. It received an X rating in Australia. The film is also notable for its footage of concert performances by nine (hence the title) bands, including Franz Ferdinand, The Dandy Warhols, and Black Rebel Motorcycle Club.",1503446400,,616,5.17
