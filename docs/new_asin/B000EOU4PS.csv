8112352,5,B000EOU4PS,"These DVDs take you through JP II's pontificate.  The footage is real; it is from photos and films taken for TV and for the news.  You see the real people involved, instead of actors.  I had not idea how many conflicts JP II was involved in and how much of a positive force he was in the world.  At the end of the DVD's I felt like I was watching Jesus Christ himself.  JP II was a phenomenal peace maker.  I think that the general public wasn't aware of most of it; I know I wasn't.  I am very glad that I made the purchase.",1361577600,3,525,3.942857142857143

She watched the 5 DVDs in less than 3 days, she knows a lot of the Pope life but she told me that learned a lot of new details about him.

So was a great choiche!",1209081600,10,235,3.5
8112354,5,B000EOU4PS,"I am very satisfied with the 5 disc set on John Paul II from the vatican television center.  It is over 5 hours in length on 5 dvd's.  It breaks the papal term up into segments which make for easy discontinuous viewing.

There is a lot of content in this video set.  I learned numerous new things about the pope that I had not learned in several other Papal documentaries and biographies.

Did you know that he traveled only 7 days in all of 1994?

You also get to see numerous interviews with the media on board the papal aircraft which really highlight the pope's personality.

The narration is in the queen's English so it feels like your watching a European newscast.

This set will not dissappoint anyone wanting to get a glimpse of Pope written from the point of view of the vatican itself.  It has a great international focus and tone. Clearly this pope touched many people all over the world. He stood by them in suffering and championed their rights and social justice.  Totus Tuus.  Be not afraid.",1175904000,22,1007,4.50828729281768
