7943870,1,B00005LC5X,"Flooding? Flooding with crap.  Every other line was a cliche.  The puppets in Team America were better actors.  We watched the special features afterward because it left us feeling like we hadn't even watched a movie, there was nothing to it.  There was a funny out-take in the special features that was more worthwhile than watching the movie, so if you make the mistake of renting this, just watch the special features and save yourself 85 minutes!",1120089600,,450,4.805194805194805
