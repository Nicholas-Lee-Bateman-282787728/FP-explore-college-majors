6658123,5,B00NJ344FC,"Haven't watched all the movies yet.  but, quality on a few of the movies is less that desired...  but they were filmed in the 1930s.

UPDATE:  I've had a chance to watch a few more episodes and found them to be of better quality.  SO, I've upped the star rating to FIVE!",1427068800,12,270,4.115384615384615
6658124,5,B00NJ344FC,"there is nothing wrong with the picture longs you adjust the HD to 4.3 aspect ratio,because if you try to watch 1080 it will stretch the picture,it will not be pertect but its ok,the protuct is good enough for me,i bought the of these from him-lone wolf-boston blackie- the saint-falcon ,go for it",1424131200,7,297,4.622641509433962

6658128,4,B00NJ344FC,"While the movies themselves are fun to watch, especially the Warren Williams ones, the DVD transfer quality themselves are only good as they look like they were duplicated from tape, plus the company logo appears at the bottom right of the screen on occasion as if you were watching a movie channel. On the plus side they did include a bonus DVD of another series. If you're expecting a studio quality DVD this isn't it but since these are rare and the price is good it still is worth the watch.",1419638400,22,495,4.450549450549451

6658133,5,B00NJ344FC,"This vendor does a great job presenting these hard to find films.  They do offer a disclaimer about quality, as they are working with a wide variety of source quality, but most of the films on this look far better than VHS.  at least 12 of these are reasonable dvd quality, and as these titles are super hard to find, it's totally worth the price.",1468713600,3,347,4.323076923076923

6658151,3,B00NJ344FC,"My copy seemed about 30x duped,-- maybe on a postage-stamp style screen it might seem tolerable . Clearly a labor of love for whomever made it, this is still not exactly the way to go if you want to enjoy anything remotely like a crisp image. I regret saying this, as I'm a true mystery and WW fan. I bear no ill will to the company though, and didn't return mine. As I say, labors of love must go rewarded.",1439164800,,407,4.1
6658152,2,B00NJ344FC,"The good
Warren William as the ex-jewel thief, the Lone Wolf (9 of the 15 films).
Enjoyable plot lines that mix light crime drama with comedic bits reminiscent of Hitchcocks To Catch a Thief.
The bad
Video quality that looks like it was transferred from a VHS tape master.  They are at best soft focus, have too much contrast.  The worst of them are so distorted that it overwhelms anything positive in the story.
Of the 15 films in this collection, I think 7 are of relatively decent quality. They are: LW Spy Hunt, LW Strikes, LW Meets a Lady, LW Keeps a Date, Counter Espionage, Passport to Suez, and LW and His Lady.
These are the worst of the films and due to their very poor image and audio quality, are unwatchable:  LW Returns, LW in Paris, Secrets of the LW, One Dangerous Night, and LW in Mexico.
These were B movie, serial productions that never had the budget to produce the visual impact of the studios major films.  The source material used for mastering these DVDs may very well be the best available.  If better ones exist, I hope the Lone Wolf movies that star Warren William will be made available to the public.  I would be a lot of fun.",1438819200,13,1156,4.403755868544601
6658153,2,B00NJ344FC,"While the movies are acceptable if you ignore the blooming (poor contrast control) the idea that the companies url pops up on the screen during playback is not acceptable.

This is the sign of a cut rate outfit and I will make a point of never purchasing their DVD's again.

Edit  08/12/15

Some of the movies such as One Dangerous Night have a dark logo mark that is not only quite big but also stays on the screen for the entire length of the movie. It wouldn't be bad except they put it up high enough to disrupt parts of the movie.

This might be acceptable for over the air broadcasts but not on movies you 'pay' for.",1437955200,25,622,4.237288135593221
6658154,5,B00NJ344FC,Item as described. Fast delivery. Very pleased.,1437523200,,47,5.857142857142857
6658155,4,B00NJ344FC,"The first two the film quality was not very good, rest were above average. The person playing the Lone Wolf kept changing, but they were all very fine actors. Warren Williams was very good in part and played in most. The storylines were great, though be aware it is always predicated that he has to prove he was not the thief.",1437264000,6,326,4.360655737704918
6658156,3,B00NJ344FC,"I am a great fan of all of the early whodunnits, Charlie Chan, Mr Moto, The Thin Man, The Saint, etc, so I ordered this set and was really looking forward to watching them. I watched the first two, The Lone Wolf Returns and The Lone Wolf in Paris and I have to say that the video quality was terrible. Basically unwatchable. While I realize that these were made in 1935 and 1938, I have several old British and American movies of that time where the both the sound and the video and more than acceptable. I have to say that it seems to me to be a complete waste of time putting films of this poor quality onto DVD. Please at least try to do some restoration. These old movies are worth it. We don't want to lose them. I eventually decided to watch them all in reverse order, and The Lone Wolf in Paris was great. Ron Randell did a great job. Also guys, kill the ONESMDIA logo in the bottom corner of the screen. It's unnecessary.",1434240000,5,929,4.195530726256983
6658157,5,B00NJ344FC,"The Lone Wolf is a reformed jewel thief turned private detective.
Basically a rip-off of The Saint, but great fun nonetheless.
Five actors played the Lone Wolf in fifteen Hollywood films between 1935 and 1947, all produced by Columbia Pictures:

1935 Melvyn Douglas = The Lone Wolf Returns
1938 Francis Lederer = The Lone Wolf in Paris
1939 Warren William = The Lone Wolf Spy Hunt
1940 Warren William = The Lone Wolf Strikes
1940 Warren William = The Lone Wolf Meets a Lady
1941 Warren William = The Lone Wolf Keeps a Date
1941 Warren William = The Lone Wolf Takes a Chance
1941 Warren William = Secrets of the Lone Wolf
1942 Warren William = Counter-Espionage
1943 Warren William = One Dangerous Night
1943 Warren William = Passport to Suez
1946 Gerald Mohr = The Notorious Lone Wolf
1947 Gerald Mohr = The Lone Wolf in Mexico
1947 Gerald Mohr = The Lone Wolf in London
1949 Ron Randell = The Lone Wolf and His Lady

Nine of the fifteen featured the remarkable Warren William as The Lone Wolf.
He's one of my all-time favorite actors, but I'll admit that he is an acquired taste.
Warren William had a remarkable face -
He looked like Satan - which should have stereotyped him as a screen villain, but his personality and sense of humor overcame this obvious handicap.
He is devilish fun to watch
Warren William also played private eyes Philo Vance (twice - in the OnesMedia and Warner Archive collections)
and Perry Mason (four films in the Warner Archive).
See the GUIDE TO B-MOVIE DETECTIVES ON DVD at the end of this review.

Adorable British actor Eric Blore played Jamison, the Lone Wolf's butler, in eleven of the movies, starting with ""The Lone Wolf Strikes"" and ending with ""The Lone Wolf in London"".

OnesMedia has produced the only available collection of all fifteen Lone Wolf movies, and is selling them at a very nice price.
Eight DVDs in a CD-size plastic clamshell case with soft plastic sleeves (the same packaging this company uses for CDs of old radio shows).
Picture quality ranges from OK to pretty good, but OnesMedia did a heroic job of cleaning up the sound.
No subtitles, but I wasn't expecting any at this price.
These are DVD-Rs, but I had no problem playing them.
Finally, THERE IS NO COMPETITION.
------------------------------------------------------------------

GUIDE TO B-MOVIE DETECTIVES ON DVD
A-Movies had bigger budgets and stars, and were top-billed in a double-feature.
B-Movies occupied the bottom of the program.
Some of the longer-lasting series started out as A-Movies, but ended up as B-Movies (Philo Vance began at Paramount and ended up at PRC)

PART ONE: REFORMED CRIMINALS TURNED PRIVATE EYE
- Boston Blackie, the Lone Wolf and the Saint are reformed jewel thieves. Still viewed with suspicion by the police.
- The Falcon has a shady past (never quite explained).
- Arsene Lupin is an unreformed jewel thief who sometimes helps the police if it serves his ends.
- The Crime Doctor used to be an Organized Crime Boss. He never actually reformed, but was conked over the head and woke up with amnesia.

PHILIP MARLOWE / SAM SPADE
These two detectives were the most famous Private Eyes of all time, but they don't really belong on this list.
They were A-Movie detectives all the way:
- 1931 The Maltese Falcon: Ricardo Cortez as Sam Spade
- 1936 Satan Met a Lady: Warren William as Sam Spade - adapted from 'The Maltese Falcon' by Dashiell Hammett
- 1941 The Maltese Falcon: Humphrey Bogart as Sam Spade
- 1944 Murder, My Sweet: Dick Powell as Philip Marlowe - adapted from 'Farewell, My Lovely' by Raymond Chandler
- 1946 The Big Sleep: Humphrey Bogart as Philip Marlowe.
- 1947 Lady in the Lake: Robert Montgomery as Philip Marlowe.
- 1947 The Brasher Doubloon: George Montgomery as Philip Marlowe - adapted from 'The High Window"" by Raymond Chandler

But two Philip Marlowe novels were adapted as B-Movies for other detectives:
- 1942 Time to Kill (Lloyd Nolan as Michael Shayne) - adaptated from 'The High Window' by Raymond Chandler
- 1942 The Falcon Takes Over (George Sanders as The Falcon)) - adapted from 'Farewell My Lovely' by Raymond Chandler

The Good: Absolutely wonderful to have a complete set of the classic ""gentleman thief"" movie series The Lone Wolf. Sometimes sappy, sometimes snappy, always a pleasure to watch.

The Bad: The video quality leaves a lot to be desired. Granted, this may be one of the only places you can pick up most of these films, but most of them are video transfers from VHS (and show it).
