This movie is so bad that it's actually really funny.  It is still funny even if you're sober, but I recommend not being sober to watch it anyway.  Incidentally, Jack DeRieux is a really cool guy and taught high school theater in California for a *long* time before retiring.",1106524800,,414,4.407894736842105
7823735,2,6302280834,"The Plot: ""The frozen bodies at a cryogenic lab are revived after lightening strikes and turned into weird-looking zombies. "" Yeah so pretty much you could tell it was gonna be REALLY STUPID. Not as bad as 13th Child, Ghost Rig, Dark Universe, or Jack-O but the difference between this film and those, it that this one is cheezy so you can laugh at it. It's basically about this cryogenic lab that has many frozen customers already inside little capsules. One night during a power-outage and while it's raining two security guards decide to bring the capsules out in the open. As expected, they get struck by lightening and then become the undead, which end up looking more like green space aliens than anything else, and believe me they'll have you on the floor laughing. Rent if you want a good cheezy movie to laugh at.",1065657600,2,822,4.636986301369863
