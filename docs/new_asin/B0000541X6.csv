The acting is strong, the stories stronger and the visuals truly out of this world. I have both the UK version (couldn't wait) and the US version. Clean, crisp pictures and sound. Since this is a tv show, the commerical breaks are a little out of place but only slightly annoying. Start with this and you'll be hooked for life.",981504000,2,466,4.626506024096385

Two very cool episodes, interesting commentary, a behind-the-scenes look at the creation of the show, plus a detailed profile of Ben Browder (aka John Crichton) all add up to one of the coolest DVD's in my collection. This is the way TV shows should be on DVD and I look forward to the rest of the collection!",981417600,2,393,4.472222222222222
1392830,5,B0000541X6,"I have the entire first series on DVD (its been available for much of 2000 - try amazon.co.uk if you are able to view region 2) and it is incredibly addictive.  Perhaps the most original and exciting sci-fi series ever, I'd venture to say.  The lavish production puts many Hollywood movies to shame.  Comparing it with one of its contemporary series, Andromeda, Farscape has that look of 'no expense spared on wardrobe and sets', while a recent Andromeda episode, er, put some silver paint on the aliens' faces and that was it!  I vote Farscape way head of any TV sci-fi you're likely to see, and on DVD the full Dolby experience is awesome.  Also the humour is very dry at times, which just adds to the enjoyment.  This one is well worth your hard-earned cash, believe me.",980208000,13,773,4.565217391304348

WOW!The picture quality is also excellent & is meant for TV's with more than 500 lines of resolution. This Dvd has some cute extras. On disc one there are somewonderful interviews that show just how much work & sweat is put into Farscape. On disc 2 you can finally see the actorwho plays Dargo without make up. Make sure when you view both DVD's you have a home theatre. If you don't have one get one. This DVD is worth the wait for fans of the show. You may also pick up the Farscape music CD to satisfy your cravings. This DVD also contains screensavers & web links. The only difference on the UK version is the packaging. So enjoy.

1392832,5,B0000541X6,We have just finished the second series of Farscape over in the UK and it is getting better and better by the episode. It combines puppetry and CGI and has very good storylines. This is I think one of the best Sci-Fi series on TV for a long time. The DVD adds Dolby Digital 5.1 to the mix to add some extra atsmosphere to the normal TV broadcasts.,977443200,,347,4.117647058823529
1392833,5,B0000541X6,"The SCI FI channel has been dependent on classic (and not so classic) series of old for some time. Now, it has several of the choicest series not just on cable, but on television in general. FARSCAPE, along with THE INVISIBLE MAN, LEXX, and FIRST WAVE, is one of the most original shows for science fiction fans and for fans of great television in general. From the excellent animatronics from Jim Henson's Creature Shop to the stunning acting from the principal players like Claudia Black and Ben Browder, this show breaks the old rules of space opera and makes new ones for the next generation to inspire for. I will be ready to add this series to my collection the minute I get my DVD player. This ain't your daddy's STAR TREK, and I'm glad it ain't.",977011200,6,753,4.5036496350364965

This DVD also includes extended scenes not shown on the Sci-Fi channel broadcasts.  The company releasing Farscape on DVD, ADV Films, has a reputation for late releases and it's unfortunate that Farscape is not being released on a season by season basis but hopefully all the extra special features will make up for it.  It's unknown whether or not Farscape was filmed in the 1:85 aspect ratio for HDTV, but the DVD has the full frame version.",976838400,2,600,4.796116504854369
1392835,4,B0000541X6,"This is the premiere episode into the new series on the SciFi channel. We see an astronaut jettison into a new era of scifi and into another galaxy far far away. Some have said this is a rehash of Buck Rogers,BULL! The only thing this show and that one is the fact that there both astronauts and from earth and thats it. This show has colorfull characters literally and three dimensional,instead of the same old rubberstamp of aliens. This show blends humans and animatronics that blend well together and after you've seen the rest of the series you look at them as real-life characters. Jim Henson company has done an excellent job of creating these wonderfull characters. The premiere episode sets up who and why these characters came to be with one another and become one dysfuntional family. The special effects is done by the same people who gave us the Matrix and once you get into the series you become hooked. So come along on a ride with Moya (name of the ship, a living ship)and join in on the adventures with John, Aeryn Sun, Zhaan,D'Argo,Pilot and Rygel. If you don't get the scifi channel and you love scifi I highly recommend getting the channel you'll be glad you did.",974332800,16,1183,4.611374407582939
1392837,4,B0000541X6,"""Farscape"" is one of my favorite TV shows, and it certainly got off to a strong start with the episode ""Pilot.""  The series has a terrific cast, with Ben Browder, Claudia Black, Virginia Hey, and Anthony Simcoe sharing the spotlight with creatures constructed by Jim Henson's company.  The writing is sharp and there is plenty of conflict to drive the story; the characters are all escaped prisoners with their own agendas.  One of the pleasures of watching these early episodes is watching how they gradually build trust and anticipating the addition of the many interesting characters that will be added to the show later to keep things from getting too comfortable.

""Farscape"" deserved a two-hour premiere, but the cast and crew do an excellent job of constructing a lean, efficient story to introduce the Farscape universe within the one-hour format.  ""I, E.T."" is a pretty middling episode as far as this show goes, but it does provide an interesting twist on the idea of the visitor from space.",1093132800,,1001,4.934523809523809
1392838,4,B0000541X6,"A wormhole--something unproven--not anymore it isn't.  Astronaut John Crichton quickly realizes this when he's sucked down one, and spit out into the middle of an intergalactic space battle between escaping prisoners and the Peacekeepers.  John's module incidentally collides with a Peacekeeper Prowler, whcih turns out to be Bialar Crais' brother, who becomes John's enemy for the rest of season one.  The first episode quickly introduces the characters, and puts a slight emphasis on how that character is going to act through the series.  The premiere definitely should of been made into a two hour to allow for more characterization and more time to do everything.
  The second episode I still wonder why it is episode one.  Not much of anything happens in it.  There's good acting, and Rygel gets a chunk out of Aeryn's arm.  Wasn't a bad episode compared to most series, but for farscape, it's below average.
  The DVD features are descent, with footage not seen in the U.S. and with commentarys on both of the episodes.  A great collection.",1064361600,2,1047,5.023255813953488
1392839,5,B0000541X6,"The pilot episode of Farscape lets us know these stories take place in the Uncharted Territories. But starting with the episodes featured on this disc, we see that these uncharted territories include the souls of Moya and her crew.
""Back and Back and Back to the Future"" pierces the gruff exterior of D'Argo as a mysterious femme fatale named Natala ensnares the warrior's heart. Unfortunately, Crichton starts having visions of himself with Natala which become progressively more disasterous. Not only do we start to see more of D'Argo's vulnerablility, but we're also treated to a well-designed, time-travelling head trip.
 ""Thank God It's Friday, Again"" has D'Argo on an alien world, but after just three days the gang finds he has traded his soldier's weapons for a famer's tools. Though he seems blissfully content with his new life, things start to spiral out of control with Zhaan slipping into the same blind happiness as D'Argo, an apparent attempt on Rygel's life, Crichton's abduction by a rebel force, and the slow realization that this paradise is intimately linked to one of the galaxy's greatest threats. This is one of Farscape's best episodes, not only for it's wonderful visual appeal, but also for the way it expands our understanding of the characters. A wistful D'Argo confides in Zhaan that this experience echoes some of his long-held dreams. Aeryn reaches beyond her Peacekeeper-imposed blinders as she and Pilot must work together, not in military maneuvers, but in the more cerebral world of science as she struggles to find out what has happened to Rygel. And to top it all of, we have Angie Milliken's beautifully disturbing portrayal as the planet's ruler, Volmay. (Plus the infamous ""She gives me a woody"" line.)
Each episode offers a commentary: The first, featuring Ben Browder and director Rowan Woods, draws attention to the directorial choices made such as camera angles and set design. The second features Anthony Simcoe and series creator Rockne O'Bannon and gives a glimpse into the Australian influences on Farscape. The character profile features Pa'u Zotoh Zhaan, which seems odd as these two episodes spend a lot of time on D'Argo, but you won't catch me complaining. The Delvian has always been a favorite of mine and it was interesting to hear Virginia Hey's take on the character she embodies. (And embodies is the word: during the interview she completely forgot she was wearing prosthetics at the time!) Zhaan's still gallery has some beautiful shots, though the posing in a few seem overly dramatic. The conceptual drawings are fascinating, though it would have been nice to have some captions. It took a while to realize that some of the aliens depicted were actually Tavleks featured in ""Throne for a Loss"" from the _previous_ disc.
As O'Bannon explains, each of the characters starts off as a standard sci-fi stereotype. The beauty of Farscape is that it then leaves those cliches behind, delving into these wonderfully realized characters.",1058832000,,2991,5.091649694501018
1392840,5,B0000541X6,"Farscape is one of the most fascinating shows (not just sci-fi) to grace the airwaves. It's a shame that the series was cancelled, but the DVD's will leave a wonderful legacy.
Pilots are akward for any show since, in the span of an hour, they must introduce the main characters and their relationships to each other as well as create the environment in which they live. Science fiction pilots have the added burden of establishing where in the universe (and when in time) the stories occur, showing how technology has advanced (or in some cases retreated), sketching out new cultures and basically setting forth what are the new rules. ""Pilot"" does an admirable job all around. Not only do we become familiar with all six major characters (seven if you include Moya), but it also sets up the wonderful paradox that makes the series so compelling in the first season: namely that each character has his/her own agenda but they must work together to survive. This definitely ain't Star Trek. ""I, E.T."" is a neat bit of storytelling in that it turns a cliched story on its head: this time we are the invading aliens. Not a major story, but still enjoyable in the way it evokes a sense of wonder.
Both episodes feature commentaries and while they are both enlightening into the way Farscape first came into being, Claudia Black's and Anthony Simcoe's banter during I, E.T. is definitely the more fun of the two (would love to see them at a con!) Two featurettes are offered. First is a ""behind-the-scenes"" documentary, which acts more as a primer for the uninitiated than a behind the scenes, though there is a fascinating segment on the process used to make D'Argo's costume (Plus seeing Anthony out of make-up. Yikes!). The second featurette is less a ""Video Profile"" of John Crichton and more Ben Browder's persepective on the series as a whole, which is more interesting anyways. Of the two still galleries, I prefer the Conceptual Drawings which include some early ideas of Peacekeeper weapons and Pilot's den over the Crichton Gallery, as many of those pictures are either a) taken from the DVD covers, b) awash in a garish red light, or c) both. Any complaints I may have, though, are small and pale beside the strengths of the rest of the disc.",1057536000,2,2248,4.737244897959184
1392841,5,B0000541X6,"Farscape has cool special effects, good actors who play great characters, action, humor, amazing stories and everything you could want in a science fiction triller.
This DVD has the first two epsiodes AND lots of extras, including drawings, weblinks, commentary, actor profile on Ben Browder and a 'making of' documentary.
The only problem that pops up with the DVDs is I noticed by the fourth one many of the extras are gone, like the commentaries, and I also realized that to get the first season, 22 episodes, you need to get 11 DVDs.  That seems like a lot of DVDs or, should I say, few episodes per the DVD.  Most series on TV put four to five episodes per DVD, which means with Farscape you end up spending a lot more and end up taking up a lot of space for one show.
If I had the money or space it would be worth it.  But for right now I think I will focus on other shows.  It is just a case of a great show but bad packaging.  Try to get it used.",1055030400,,954,4.163043478260869
1392842,5,B0000541X6,"After finding himself [pulled through] through a wormhole and thrust into the depths of space that neither he nor any human before him had envisioned, Astronaut John Crichton finds himself confronted with Worlds beyond comprehension. In what seems like mere moments he finds himself aboard a living vessel named Moya with a group of escaped convicts trying desperately to outrun a race called the Peacekeepers and their leader whose brother Crichton accidentally caused to perish. In order to escape these forces, the crew of Moya are forced to head into the Uncharted Territories, knowing that they will be followed but that at least the pull of the Peacekeepers isn't a strong as it is elsewhere. Yes, space isn't what it seems.
In these two episodes from the first season, we find D'Argo, a creature from a warrior race with tendrils sprouting from both the top of his head and his chin, as our focal point.
In the first piece, ""Back and Back and Back to the Future,"" the crew of Moya decide to rescue a couple of aliens from their ship that seems to be disintegrating. One of those on board, a female, seems to have some strange allure over both Crichton and D'Argo, putting D'Argo at odds with the human and jealous of what the other members of the crew think. Added to this is the fact that Crichton starts to have flashes of the future, and it seems that this future contains elements that don't seem to lead anywhere but demise.
To me, this episode was a worthwhile one that had some hidden portions within the plot and that played with the mind of the ever-maddening human as he tries to cope with the oddities of space. Its also interesting to see how he thinks he can change things like so many others would only to see that lead to an even worse fate over and over again, making him wonder if he's simply going mad, if things can be changed if he's not, and why he had to end up with such an unwelcome gift in the first place.
In the next episode, ""Thank God Its Friday - Again,"" D'Argo finds himself possessed by something called Hyper Rage, making him aggressive toward any male he sees as a challenge to him, and Crichton finds himself hiding for three days until, at last, D'Argo decides to leave Moya and head for the planet Sykar. When the crew decides to go in search of him, they find him at peace within himself and the society he's found there, happy with the lifestyle of hard work and partying that this allows. Other problems soon begin to manifest as Rygel's bodily fluids become explosive for some reason and Zhaan seems to be overcome by whatever is influencing D'Argo.
This is also an episode I found rather enjoyable because a few things happen here that explain the ways that some societies fuel other ones, and the way that oppression can be elation depending on how its presented. It also places Crichton in some precarious situations when it comes to staying alive, and shows the duality of some of the crew and the bonds that begin to form between some of them; even the ex-Peacekeeper and the Pilot that once despised all their kind.
For anyone that hasn't looked into Farscape yet, I would suggest going back to the Premiere DVD, watching it, and allowing yourself be hooked by the storyline and the characters being developed therein. The dialogue is of the greatest of qualities and only gets better as the show progresses, the individuals that are chasing and the people fleeing are all interesting and the events of today create the rippling effects of tomorrow, plus there is a point to everything taking place. The creative team that developed it should be commended and recommended highly, at least in this viewer's book.",1048118400,,3665,4.64
1392843,4,B0000541X6,"I am a ""Farscape"" neophyte working their way through Season 1 and it seems clear to me that Volume 3 is where this science fiction series starts clicking as the characters start to emerge with some complexity and the stories fit this point in the saga.  The common denominator here is that human John Crichton (Ben Browder) gets to save the day to the relief, if not the surprise, of his new crewmates.
""Back and Back and Back to the Future"" is, as the title suggests, a time travel tale in which Crichton becomes unstuck in time.  The fun here is decoding when Crichton has flashed forward and when he is back in the present, and, of course, his attempts to convince the others that he is telling the truth and not gone insane.  This is the best episode of the series so far, not only because there it is well thought out but also because there are some key moments regarding character interaction and revelation.
""Thank God It's Friday..Again"" is too reminiscent of the ""Star Trek"" episode where Spock gets pollinated and is happy for a while to really be a standout episode.  However, there is a standout performance by a guest star as the leader of the shiny happy people.  Once again, the best parts of the episode have to do with the character interaction, particularly between Aeryn (Claudia Black) and Rygel (Jonathan Hardy) as well as Zhaan (Virginia Hey) and D'Argo (Anthony Simcoe).
One of the things that is most commendable about ""Farscape"" is that these DVDs are extremely fan friendly.  All of the episodes (so far) offer commentary tracks by a rotating pair of cast and crewmembers.  This time around it is actor Browder and director Rowan Woods on ""Back and Back and Back to the Future"" and actor Simcoe and series creator Rockne S. O'Bannon on ""Thank God It's Friday...Again.""  Having the tag team commentary works well and the talk is usually about the series and the characters overall as well as the individual characters.
There is also a video profile of a ""Farscape"" character on each disc and this time around it is the turn of Virginia Hey and Pa'u Zotoh Zhaan, the most fascinating alien of the current media generation.  Then there is the fact that there is deleted footage that was not broadcast in North America, which is meaningless to me because I do not know what it was I did not see the first time around when I did not see it in the first place.",1043280000,,2380,4.581176470588235
1392844,4,B0000541X6,"In my continuing quest to catch up with all the shows I have managed to miss in the past couple of years I am now working my way through Season 1 of ""Farscape.""  This first DVD offers up the first two episodes, including the pilot, ""Premiere.""  Basically, creator Rockne S. O'Bannon takes the old Buck Rodgers in the 25th Century idea and gives it a few significant twists.  As we are reminded each week in the title sequence, Commander John Crichton (Ben Browder) is sent through a wormhole during an experimental test flight into a galaxy far, far away where he ends up on Moya, a living spaceship with aliens on it.
The aliens in question are escaped prisoners fleeing from the fascist Peacekeepers.  Of course, as far as they are concerned, it is Crichton that is the alien.  Because of one of those accidents that tend to happen when a spacecraft is hurtled through a wormhole into a galaxy far, far away, Crichton is also a fugitive from the Peacekeepers, as is one of their number, Officer Aeryn Sun (Claudia Black).  When you toss into this mix the hulking warrior D'Argo (Anthony Simcoe), the bombastic Rygel (Henson puppet voiced by Jonathan Hardy), and the exotic blue skinned priestess Zhaan (Virginia Hey), you have the potential for extended interpersonal conflict in each and every episode.  These crewmates might not kill each other, but they are not averse to punching each other out.  The pilot episode is certainly functional in terms of laying out the possibilities, but obviously what is going to make this series is how well future episodes work off of these premises.  At this point it is clearly the aliens that are more interesting to us than Crichton's situation, but it is clear as soon as you see her that Zhaan is going to be a fascinating character.
""I, E.T."" is a great idea for an episode considering Crichton's plight, but having it be the second episode in the series is way too early as far as I am concerned.  With all of his science fiction/pop culture references, there should be an episode where Crichton realizes he is in caught in a classic science fiction film plot.  However, flipping his own first contact experience from ""Premiere"" is something I would have saved for the second half of the season and not the second episode.  Having it this early makes the story lose a lot of its potential poignancy.  Besides, at this point we are really more interested in learning more about Zhaan and D'Argo than in the fact that Crichton wants to go home.
I especially appreciated the involvement of the cast and crew in doing commentary tracks on (apparently) all of the episodes on these DVDs.  Having two people talking per episode works well, as they engage in dialogue and talk about not just the particular episode but the characters and the series overall.  My only serious complaint about the DVDs of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" have been the approach of letting each writer comment on one show per season.  My current line of thought is that cast and crew commentary on all episodes is as fan friendly as a cult television show can get.  There is also a video profile for the character of John Crichton and a 22-minute documentary on the making of the series, along with an image gallery, conceptual gallery, and web-links.  As I said, this is a high end fan friendly DVD.",1042070400,,3315,4.686206896551724
1392845,5,B0000541X6,"""Back and Back and Back to the Future"" is an episode where Crichton is able to experience the future, then return back to the present when things go wrong (like he gets killed).  As he corrects certain things, he is able to move forward in the present.  The story of this episode has been seen before, but it is enjoyable all the same.
The second episode here is ""Thank God It's Friday, Again"".  This episode takes place on a planet where every day is a work day, every night is a huge party with the promise that tomorrow is a rest day.  However, when tomorrow becomes today, the cycle is repeated.  The people are slaves to a plant which they cultivate.  The plant works like a narcotic on most of the people.  Some are able to resist and others with the help of a worm implanted in them can resist as well.  Crichton is given such a worm and soon learns the secret of the plant and this planet.  The plant is used by the Peacekeepers as it fuels their energy weapons and the planet is a giant storage facility for them.

Also, usually when I see a skinny woman getting the upper-hand on a man I turn the channel because I don't believe it, but Erin, who was once a peace-keeper but is now a good guy, is believable as being ""tough"".

1392848,4,B0000541X6,"I gave this DVD 4-stars, but that's only because the disc contains just 2 episodes.  As with just about all TV series DVD presentations, it's under-utilized, to collect greater revenues, I can only conclude.  The storage capacity of the DVD is so great, there's really no fair reason for not including more of the series on each DVD.  (This is a fair grievance with most film DVD's as well.  A double-sided, dual-layer DVD can hold up to 8 hours of high-quality video, or 30 hours of VHS quality video.  I've seen very few double-sided DVD's, most giving up capacity for artwork. !?!)
That issue aside, the Farscape episodes are great.  I don't believe I ever saw the beginning of the series on the air, so it was great to be taken back to the start.  The series is one of the most inventive and engaging Sci-Fi sagas I've ever been sucked into.

It's a great mix of fabulous storytelling, and great character development which a lot of sci-fi shows lack these days. Don't mistake Farscape for another sci-fi quicky, it really does need time to develop the ongoing story, and one does tend to relate, and really enjoy the mirage of characters.
 Premiere was a great start to a great new series. It did a fantastic job introducting the witty, and colorful characters. It even included a bit of action. All in all, a worthy episode.
 I,E.T. This episode wasn't all that good. It lacked a solid story, and the plot it did provide was poor. If it weren't for the side story taking place in Moya, I would've really disliked the episode, but hey,it's Farscape!",1019433600,4,785,4.681159420289855
1392850,4,B0000541X6,"After hearing/reading so much about Farscape, I am ready to make a purchase. However, there seems to be two different version of the series and I am wondering which version to buy.
On Amazon.com (usa), the director is credited as Andrew Prowse. On Amazon.co.uk (uk), the director(s) are Ian Watson and Tony Tilse. I looked at IMDB and the site credit it to Andrew Prowse.
To complicate the matter, the discs are produced by different companies (Contender Entertainment Group for UK and A.D. Vision for USA).
Then they are of different running time. The USA version runs 100 minutes and the UK version runs 250 minutes! The UK version contains 2 discs per release and the US version contains only 1 disc per release. While I understand this could be the single layer/dual layer issue, the total number of episodes of the UK version seems a lot more than the US version as well.
The series is in differnt sequence too. According to the UK site, the disc(s) of the first series contain 4 episodes (Premiere, Throne for a Loss- both on disc 1, Back and Back and Back to the Future and I, E.T. are on disc 2). The US version has 2 episodes (Premiere and I, E.T.). The rest of the series are all mixed up as well.
Back and Back and Back to the Future can be found on Farscape #3 and Throne for a Loss can be found on Farscape #2 of the US version. Why do the UK version of the discs runs a typical 100 minutes more then the US version?
I am totally confused by the two versions and I don't know which one I should purchase. I suspect the show has no specific sequence so either version is OK...",1016323200,3,1588,4.35016835016835
1392851,4,B0000541X6,"Much better than any new ""Enterprise"" episode, Farscape was a pleasant surprise. The graphics beat anything Paramount has done with the Star Trek Universe, and the storylines are nowhere near as cheesy (as Enterprise only). I prefer a good Deep Space Nine or TNG to Farscape (and some Voyagers), but all in all, I'm glad to own all of these. They're nice new stories, and the rip-offs from other sci-fi is kept to a minimum. Also, weird things happen that would never happen in a Star Trek. Like Rygel farting helium, or peeing from a foot-bridge to demonstrate his urine's explosive powers when he eats certain foods. The peacekeeper chick is hot too, and she has an awesome six-pack. It's not really more like Star Wars or Star Trek, it's just Farscape, and it ain't bad! Check out a ""best of"" pack at Blockbuster for rental if your not sure.",1016064000,4,844,4.633333333333334
1392852,4,B0000541X6,"For those who are fans of the FARSCAPE series, the release of the DVDs is a blessing of its own, even if my one complaint about them is that their release is very, very slow.  However, the quality of the DVDs continues to be very high, and this more than makes up for the slowness of the release schedule.
""Back and Back and Back to the Future"" offers an episode in which the arrival of scientist Verell and his assistant, Matala, on Moya brings with it an intriguing mystery as Crichton suffers from 'time flashes' that lead to worse and worse results every time he changes the future.  The story has an unusual, FARSCAPE twist to time travel, and the strength of the episode lies in the developing relationships between the various characters.  The extra footage found in this episode sheds some light on a few things, and goes to show what North American television commercials deem as footage not worthy of airing, yet it has some importance to the episode.  A commentary version of the episode by Ben Browder and director Rowan Woods makes for intereresting viewing, and sheds a lot of light on how episodic television is made.
  The second episode, ""Thank God It's Friday, Again"", is one in which our heroes travel down to the planet Sykar to find D'Argo, who left the ship in a Luxan hyper rage some three days prior.  What they find is a planet strangely at peace, D'Argo not wanting to return to Moya but happy to be harvesting tannot root from the ground, and a culture that seems to be living in a drug-induced blissfulness.  Add to that Rygel's body fluids becoming explosive, and the story takes some interesting twists, with the neat revelation towards the end.  This is a fine episode, that shows a softer side to at least three of the characters (D'Argo, Zhaan, and Aeryn), and has some interesting aspects of morality to it.  The extra footage in this one has some good scenes but there's nothing here that makes this episode worth the wait for the DVD.  On the other hand, the commentary version with Rockne S. O'Bannon and Anthony Simcoe is a delight to watch, and sheds a good deal of light into the thinking that went into the story and into some of the aspects of how Anth chose to play D'Argo in this episode and some of the other acting aspects of the story.  Well worth the price of the DVD.
This DVD is a bit more of a mixed bag, but when one adds the profile on Zhaan and Virginia Hey (who is never seen out of makeup in the Profile section), it's a worthwhile addition to the collection of FARSCAPE DVDs to this point.",1015286400,,2546,4.487012987012987

What's even nicer is that the episodes are being DVDed in the right sequence, so one can watch them properly.  The first two episodes of the series, ""Premiere"" and ""I, ET"", were both good shows when they aired on tv, but the addition of the footage not aired in North America (especially from ""Premiere"") made the price of this DVD worth it.  The commentary versions of both episodes was quite enlightening, as was the character/actor profiles that were included on the DVD.

The illustrious esthetics and good storylines will keep you wanting more.  I have only rated this a 4 (four) due to the poor options and operations of the DVD.  It starts out with advertisements, which you shouldn't need to be forced to watch on a DVD that you purchase.  If you put on pause, the sound synchronization is lost until you play around with the fast-forward or back.  The price seems steep for only two episodes.  I also found other glitches in the menu operations.  It would be nice to have a better menu, where you do not have to hunt for the episode that you want to watch.

I was glad to see this DVD released with the initial episode so I could find out how all the characters got together.  I understand that the DVD has additional footage not seen on tv. I especially liked the additional features such as the audio commentaries prov ided by the stars.
Farscape is a great series with amazing characters and great actors.  In some ways I think it is better than any of the Star Trek series.  I hope that eventually all of the episodes will be available on DVD. It appears that will happen although slowly.  This DVD is well worth the money for any sci-fi aficionado.",1003968000,3,661,4.576271186440678

I got lots of laughs as Ben Browder stumbled over and through the Aussie idioms getting at least one of them totally wrong with comic results.  A must have for any 'Scaper' or scifi fan.,1003881600,2,341,4.265625
1392869,4,B0000541X6,"Farscape is a series that goes far out on a limb to maintain the illusion of an alien universe and avoid the cliches of television sci-fi by depicting every other race as human with something on their foreheads. The characters can be funny without ever crossing that line into sillyness, and real enough that it can be a little heavy without being too melodramatic.
The premiere episode does a good job of introducing the universe, the characters we'll follow in it, and the premise of their main conflicts. One of the pleasures of the show is that the status quo will shift significantlt over time, but the premiere goes a long way ot making these developments accessable, so if you're curious about the show, it will help to start at the beginning.
The biggest knock I have against the DVD they couldn't have helped; the second episode just happens to be one of those rare, weak episodes of the series. I, ET may seem a little cheesy compared to the pilot episode because it lacks the ship battles, cosmic scale and (to some extent) humor of the usual episodes but the point of it is to show that the one transplanted human in the 'alien' in the show. It's a good idea, but played better in later episodes.
People who have watched the show may wonder if the sound, picture quality and extra scenes are worth the price of admission for 're-runs'. I'd say 'no' if those were the only benefits. I really enjoyed these, the visual special effects are better, and the sound is crisp, but by themselves these were maybe an extra 10-20% goose to the overall experience. The deleted scenes are nice, but blink and you'll miss 'em.
The overwhelming argument for the familiar fan to get the DVD of these particular 're-runs' are the overlaid audio commentary tracks. It may sound technical and uninviting, but these are fun and I came away appreciating the show on a level that I hadn't really considered before. With the tracks here and on Farscape 2 you'll get a much fuller picture of the craft and consideration the cast and crew put into making this weekly spectacle. It's not like those cheesy infomercial 'making of ...' documentaries, or the director-after-his-third-scotch mumbling over all the dialogue like the tired intellectual that he is. No, on these DVDs you will be entertained by friendly performers and writers laughing about what they tried to do with a scene and candidly exposing the little magician's tricks about how they came about it. If you don't like the initial show this may not interest you so much, but any regular viewer should have these early Farscape DVDs that let everyone in behind the curtain.",1000944000,13,2624,4.718954248366013
1392870,5,B0000541X6,"These two episodes introduce the viewer to the most quintessential science fiction show since the ORIGINAL 'Star Trek'!  Unlike that show--which may have been state-of-the-art in the mid-60's but whose sets look pathetically low-budget to today's Industrial Light and Magic overdosed fan--""Farscape"" pushes the envelope to new and glorious heights in every respect: from cool special effects, to phenomenal makeup and masks, to innovative animated and 'Muppet' characters that make Star Wars' Cantina crew look tame!  Add to this intriguing human-esque characters portrayed by actors of a caliber no longer seen in American television or movies (actors with the ability to convey, with heart-rending conviction, a myriad of emotions with a single glance or gesture) throw in some stunning sets, and you have a production that is unmatchable.

The audio effects are now more on par with the show's incredible video effects. It is so much better to experience Farscape all over again in full Dolby Digital. I've been an advid watcher since the original preimer episode on SCIFI, and I must say they did an excelent job on the DVD release! This disc is a must buy, especialy if you have a Dolby Digital home theather setup and appreciate excellent sci-fi. I plan to purchase the entire series. My only complaint is that I wish ADV would release season box sets instead of two episodes at a time. ADV, take a hint from the X-Files and Stargate SG-1 which both are being sold in season box sets.

1392872,5,B0000541X6,"I'm a sci-fi nut, have been since I was a kid. I actually remember the premier of the original Star Trek. I've seen a heck of a lot of self proclaimed ""stunning"" television debuts in my day. But the Premier of Farscape is a very rare gem. I can't name even five feature length big budget sci-fi films made in the last ten years that can keep up with the premier of this television series. When you look at just who was involved in this it becomes clear why this premier is as good as it is.
The writing: Rockne S. O'Bannon is an old hand at writing intelligent, witty, sci-fi. He's written for Amazing Stories, The Twilight Zone (8 eps), Alien Nation, he created SeaQuest, the guy has been around. This might just be his masterpiece. With the premier of Farscape his writing took a jump up into a whole new league. The characters are truly unique, the dialog is possibly some of the best I've yet to see on the tube or silver screen, the pace is unmatched, and the plot tight, believable, consistent, and at times hilarious. This is possibly the most well written premier I've ever seen for any TV series.
The direction: The name Andrew Prowse is very well known in Australia as one of the leading film editors trusted by some of the best directors in the business. Now with his step into the big chair himself he shows just how much he learned. His direction in this premier is nothing shy of brilliant.
The Cast: Sci-fi is a rarity down under in the land of Oz. So when the casting call went out for Farscape it literally drew in every top actor in the biz down there and the quality clearly shines. All of them are top notch A-list people with dramatic credits that make you wonder if ""Tinsel Town"" will ever match Sydney for quality sci-fi again.
The Production Values: With most TV shows the Production Designer will have 6 to 8 weeks to develop the sets and props used. Ricky Eyres spent 7 whole MONTHS. And it shows. The level of detail and thought put into the sets and props is simply mind blowing.
This is one you'll want to own and keep. Few feature length sci-fi's are half this good, and ten years from now you'll be asking why they don't make shows like FARSCAPE any more.",993772800,8,2186,4.3734643734643734
1392873,5,B0000541X6,"Movie Summary: American astronaut John Crichton is testing his own theory in a small one man space craft when he is sucked into a wormhole and out of the universe he knows. He finds himself in the middle of a space battle between what turns out to be a prison ship and the galactic police who are called the peacekeepers. John's tiny craft is pulled into the prison ship and he himself becomes a prison of the prisoners. John is forced to use his wits in order to survive in a completely alien universe.
My Opinion:  I had heard a lot of buzz about Farscape, but nothing specific. I was reserved having been disappointed by more than a few SciFi shows in the past. I'm pleased to say that I was very happy with what I found. Even though the ""worm hole into another universe"" theme has been used many times, FarScape does a great job with it. The characters are intelligent, and well thought out. The first two episodes had good plots which is not a given with today's shows. John Crichton is a very likeable and strong main character. I'm looking forward to where Volume 2 of FarScape will take me.
DVD Quality:  Standard 1.33:1 because it is a TV show. Extras include a ""Making of"" and an ""actor profile"" for Ben Browder. It would be nice to have more than two episodes per DVD.
What You Should Do:  See it! If you are any kind of SciFi fan you are going to want to own this one.",992822400,,1380,4.3
1392874,2,B0000541X6,"I've recently started watching the show on the sci-fi channel and instantly got hooked. The cast, characters and special effects is everything you could ever want in a weekly sci-fi epic. I bought the first two DVD released by ADV to catch up on the story since we're well into season 3 now. Then I found out that ADV is releasing only 2 episodes per month. I will have to wait approx. 7 more months to view season 1. >:-(
Then there is the cost of ($) per episode that discouraged me even further. I ended up buying Farscape region 2 DVD's from the UK for about ($) for the entire season 1 and I'm mid-way through season 2 now. :-) It's a bit expensive but I did save ($) and the wait, well worth it.
I had to switch the region code on my DVD-rom drive on my computer so I can view it. NO BIG DEAL but do your homework if you go this route.
Hopefully ADV and Jim Henson Co. will get the hint and start thinking about the fans and not about maximizing profits on nickel and dime DVD sales. I wanted to view the entire season and I would have preferred it to be in region 1 coding. Oh, well I lost patience and ADV lost my money. Too bad for ADV.",992131200,8,1145,4.048458149779735

This DVD continues to build on the outstanding storytelling begun in Farscape #1 and continued in Farscape #2.  The first episode in this disk contains the best handling of a ""time sense"" plot that I have ever seen.  Occasionally a plot element is silly, but this series consistently delivers the goods on edgy, unusual storylines.  The ensemble cast, almost entirely made up of people you've never heard of, meshes wonderfully.  They play well off each other and create a believable story about Moya, a living ship, and her crew.

In ""Thank God It's Friday Again,"" Farscape demonstrates it can do Star Trek, only better.  There's nothing more to recommend this tape than any of the others in the series so far -- and no less.

1392894,4,B0000541X6,"The start of the premiere episode had me a bit scared I'd spent my money on a dud of a DVD. The feel of the first few minutes is cold and rocky. You know something will happen to this guy and for a long moment I wondered if I would care about the outcome. After this bit of visual prologue, once you get to Moya and her crew, it's all systems go! It's a lush visual enviroment worthy of feature films and this guy named John becomes the only thing you can predict. Sort of! He let's loose some one liners that just crack me up. The episode becomes more than a shoot-em-up space-escapees-on-the-run flick in the last scene with John having to reconnect with the human race by taping a message to his father.
I, E.T. continues this bend with a great ""ode to The Twilight Zone"" feel. ""One being's salt is another's gold"" sort of message. D'Argo and Sun have a great time making fun of humans and human technology. Who saves the day? John, of course. It just takes him a little extra time. Again, charm of the ep is at the end when we leave the planet. ""For every discovery there is sadness, too."" This brought back the feeling I was left with for many Twilight Zone shows, so this is a wonderful successor for the new millenium.

1392897,5,B0000541X6,"I didn't really get into Farscape until I saw the trailer for it on another DVD from ADV. I quickly got the DVD and it was worth it. This first of many DVD's contains the first two 50 minute episodes. The first one is basically how John got on Moya and has some nice battle scenes as well as making contact on Blade Runner esque planet. It introduces most of the main characters in the first season such as Aeryn, D'Argo, Rygel, Zhann and the ever popular Pilot. The second episode is I, ET. The reason for this name is that John meets another speices of aliens who think he's an alien (odd), but the best part of this episode is how Rygel and Zhann try to disarm a tracking device on Moya. The main reason I love Farscape is for Pilot. Pilot is my favorite character of the whole show! DVD extras includes a documentary on Farscape with all the cast, crew and puppeteers. Even more, there is another video featuring Ben Browder talking about his character in the show. The DVD also gives image gallery of Ben Browder and conceptual art of the ship and Pilot. Audio preference is very good giving you a choice of English 2.0, 5.1 and commentary which changes every episode. In other words, the first episode has commentary with Ben Browder and Brian Henson while episode 2 will feature commentary by Claudia Black and Anthony Simcoe. The commentary prooves to be very amusing at times giving reference to some of the stage sets and also gives the american audiance a better understanding of the show. The menus are fair. The main screen features a slighty tilted screen, the extras menu has a slower version of the opening in the back, audio select has a nice full screen of the part where Moya crashes into a bog which is really just a 6 second sequence thats played over and over and the scene selection is overall well done. One thing people might dislike is the fact that every menu has the same music (the opening music). One last thing worth mentioning is the English subtitles which are pretty small but you should be able to read them. Overall, a great DVD that is easily a must-see for anyone.",984873600,12,2102,4.4765625

So, naturally, I was quite excited when I learned that it would be making its DVD debut. :)  The ""Premier"" is such a great ep - interesting establishment of characters and setting - that it still makes me laugh. Crichton is an instantly lovable character and the introductions to the others' will pique the interest of any sci-fi native.  ""I, E.T."" reminds me of Star Trek TNG, the glory days of yore and all that jazz. It gives a thought-provoking spin on close encounters and learning about alien life through the eyes of our very own confused ""alien"" Crichton. It's a little hokey, but layered underneath the somewhat predictable humor is a deep message that teaches us even more about the unlikely crew of Moya.

1392901,4,B0000541X6,"These two episodes, ""Back and Back and Back to the Future"" and ""Thank God It's Friday, Again"" are excellent episodes that demonstrate the many strengths of FARSCAPE. Both episodes feature great performances and effects and in each the writing is superb.  The first episode takes the familiar science fiction premise of a character forced to repeat events and gives it a fresh new spin of desperation as Crichton tries to escape his predicament and save his friends. Browder's performance makes you feel his increasing frustration and makes the situation seem that much  more intense. There are some other very subtle character nuances and revelations that bear careful watching, especially in the case of D'argo. Events are foreshadowed that will not become obvious til much later in the series. The second episode is an example of another classic FARSCAPE trick, taking a seemingly innocuous situation and twisting it into something strange and troublesome. In this episode, the crew finds that all is not as it appears to be on a pastoral paradise planet. The episode features some wonderful comedic moments thanks to Rygel's bodily functions and some terrifying and painful moments at Crichton's expense. But it is the actions and reactions of D'argo, Zhan and Aeryn that really bear watching. What they say and fail to say speaks volumes about their feelings and their futures.  No one in this show is ever truly who they appear to be and these two episodes begin the process of unlocking these complex puzzles. Watch as an intricate puzzle is created before your eyes.",983836800,8,1573,5.065637065637065
1392902,5,B0000541X6,"Back and Back and Back to the Future is one of the best early Farscape episodes.  Crichton, due to a temporal fluke, is getting ""flashforewards,"" which allow him experience the future, and it isn't pretty.  Two visitors split the crew's loyalties, and of course have hidden agendas.  In a future flash, Crichton sees what's going on, and tries to stop it, getting killed in the process!  Luckily, he gets another shot or two in the present (and future) :-).  Excellent Episode.
Thank God It's Friday, Again puts the crew on a planet where everybody's happy all the time, and they're coming to take me away ha ha!  The planet's inhabitants are forced to farm (and eat) a strange plant with druggy qualities (although they do get to party on Fridays.)  Nobody wants to leave this happy happy place, but somebody had better do something before they think happy happy thoughts forever!  (And did I mention there's a conspiracy involved?...) Overall, a decent episode. Obviously, DVD is the ultimate way to watch Farscape.  The effects and quality are incredible!  Enjoy!",983750400,6,1066,4.905027932960894
1392903,5,B0000541X6,"Back & Back & Back to The Future-Moya rescues two Ilanic scientists from their disintegrating space craft, but their transport pod exposes Crichton to a mysterious force that jolts him back & forth in time. One of the pair the sensuous Matala, sets out to seduce & divert D'Argo. But Crichton realizes that his moments in the future have allowed him to glimpse what Matala is really like, & he tries to change his Actions in the present to avert a potential disaster. An episode worth seeing. Thank God It's Friday...Again-During an excursion to the planet Sykar, D'Argo finds a new life, Harvesting Tannot root just like the other drone inhabitants of the planet. The rest of the crew try to convince D'Argo to return to the ship. After all he is a wanted fugitive by the peacekeepers,Rygel ingests large quantities of Tannot, & he soon discovers an unwanted side effect...Meanwhile, Crichton works hard to free both D'Argo & Zhann from the effect of the root before the pretty Sykarian leader enslaves them all & takes over the ship....Great stories & Great effects. I enjoyed Thank God It's Friday....Again. It reminds me about the many religous cults in our own backyard. You'll also enjoy the video profile of Zhaan. A worthy effort. So Enjoy!",983491200,7,1248,4.836448598130841

1392906,5,B0000541X6,"Finally!  Farscape on DVD, I've been living in a house without cable, therefore I haven't seen this series until now, I've alway heard great things about it, but never the chance to watch it (especially the great interviews with the stars of the show on scifi.ign.com.)  Thanks to ADV Films I didn't have to wait too long to get my hands on it, and the great thing about it is that there is a commentary with each episode, it was great hearing Browder, Simcoe and Black having so much fun telling their experiences on the set and explaning how everything began, these stars felt very real and down to earth to me, and I can't wait for the future release of the other episodes.  If you are remotely a fan of science fiction or long running shows like Star Trek, do yourself a favor and pick up Farscape!",982022400,3,802,4.405405405405405

7930661,4,B0000541X6,"In ""Back and Back...,"" Crichton (Ben Browder) and company rescue a scientist and his assistant from their imploding spacecraft.  In the process, Crichton begins to suffer from time flashes wherein he experiences the future, thereby becoming aware that the mysterious assistant has a deadly secret.  There is a lot of good characterization here and a tantalizing hint at D'Argo's (Anthony Simcoe) past.  I like the way that so many Farscape episodes turn on Crichton's disarming manner of just leveling with other characters and telling them the truth rather than contriving unlikely deceptions to resolve plot points.

""Thank God..."" is another good D'Argo episode.  This time he has inexplicably decided to settle down and live as a field worker on an agrarian planet.  Suspecting that something is not quite right, Crichton and the others investigate, finding that the planet has an unsettling connection to an old enemy.

I love this show.  As good as these episodes are, there is much better to come.",1096675200,,1004,5.154320987654321
