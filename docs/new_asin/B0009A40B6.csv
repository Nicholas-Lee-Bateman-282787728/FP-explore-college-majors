8058857,3,B0009A40B6,"Poor Carlos, honestly, he has it tough. He just got his girlfriend pregnant, marries her and is about to be a father. He is also starting a new job, and of course, his father in law hates him. Oh, did I forget to mention that a woman in his office (Ninel Conde) is literally throwing herself at him.

The movie is good, not earth shattering, but entertaining enough. Carlos, who keeps hearing from friends and co-workers that everyman gets 7 women and a homosexual (just in case), has to deal with deciding whether he is happy, morals and whether to remain faithful. His wife is just a spoiled brat! She has to deal with the fact that she cannot live in the same style as she lived with her parents. Ninel Conde is good as the co-worker just throwing herself at Carlos. The movie attempts to have a deep message but it somehow feels very superficial.",1213056000,,850,4.448717948717949
8058858,3,B0009A40B6,"7 mujeres, un homosexual y Carlos is a misleading title, one that would indicate the possibility of a racy sexploitation movie about seven women and a homosexual involved with a guy named Carlos. This rather bland little film written and directed by Rene Bueno is anything but that. Though well photographed and cast the film never rises much above a TV novella, and for those who love the daytime soaps, then this is sure to please.

Carlos (Mauricio Ochmann) narrates the story and informs us that he has had only one love since childhood - Camila (Adriana Fonseca), a girl whose family has high hopes for their daughter.  When Camila and Carlos discover Camila is pregnant at 18 the couple decide to marry, much to the disappointment of Camila's father.  But marry they do, and the fun-loving relationship becomes married life with all its consequences:  Camila begins revamping Carlos' way of dressing and acting, Carlos quits school to get a job with an ad agency 9nstead of working for Camila's father at a more lucrative position.

At Carlos' office it is de rigueur for married men to have mistresses, as is so embarrassingly pointed out when Carlos is tricked into opening the door of his boss (Luis Felipe Tovar) en flagrante with his secretary (Veronica Segura).  Also working in the office as 'office decor' is a vampy buxom girl (Ninel Conde) who informs Carlos that he needs to have an affair with her...in order to succeed in the man's world.  The slogan ""Every man gets 7 women and 1 homosexual"" is repeatedly used by the office staff, making the real world one that not only condones but glorifies infidelity.

How this temptation is dealt with by Carlos and influences his marriage is the gist of this film.  Pretty squeaky-clean.  Though there are no deep moments to salvage a superficial script the movie survives on the merits of some of the cast members.  It is a bit of saccharine fluff, but an OK film for an easy  evening.  In Spanish with English subtitles.  Grady Harp, December 05",1134432000,7,2008,4.765895953757226
8058859,3,B0009A40B6,"This straight-to-video Mexican-American production is about as formulaic as a movie can be, but that doesn't mean you can't enjoy it. On the whole, the film is aimed at Hispanic audiences with traditional family values, and American viewers may be a bit put off by its heavy-handedness. The story centers around a 21-year old newlywed, who has married his girlfriend on account of an unexpected pregnancy. They aren't really ready for the challenges of marriage, but Carlos really wants to make it work. The couple exchanges vows, set up a nest and Carlos takes a job.

Then everything starts to misfire. The couple are bedeviled with money problems, beautiful women start hitting on Carlos, and to top it all off, Carlos' father-in-law really detests him. Suddenly it looks as though the married life might be too much for the young couple, and things start to fall apart. Maybe Carlos and Camila made a mistake. Maybe they should split ways and let Carlos be a weekend daddy.

That dilemma forms the crux of this film from first-time director Rene Bueno. Though the film isn't high art, and though it isn't nearly as quirky or offbeat as the title suggests, it still has plenty of charm. The acting is respectable, the characters fairly well drawn, and the cinematography is nice and colorful. Clocking in at around 90 minutes or so, it isn't too much of a time investment either. It moves well enough to keep you from getting bored, and that's more than we can say for a lot of movies out there.",1119744000,6,1498,4.735632183908046
