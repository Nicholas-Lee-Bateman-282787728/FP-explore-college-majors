4496915,4,B004XQO8OG,"The documentary begins well, but takes a slight dip in engagement and interest about 15 minutes into the film. But once the cases' personal struggles are profiled, the film picks back up in a riveting manner. These are a variety of profiles, from the poignant wanna-be's, to someone who made it big. It's a great documentary for those with an interest in puppetry and/or ventriloquism. I also appreciated how Terry Fator, who skyrocketed to success, didn't let fame go to his head, kept it real, remembered his humble beginnings, and acknowledged the dues he had to pay.",1313193600,,570,4.88659793814433

DON'T GIVE UP AND DON'T GIVE IN TO ALL THE NAYSAYERS!...  these are  everyday people  who are passionate about their dreams. Everyone can relate  to this as they go through trials and tribulations and their own personal struggles.

A few of them achieved their dreams, others are still in the process, No one in this movie has given up hope. Well done.!",1312848000,,448,4.469135802469136
4496917,5,B004XQO8OG,"It is very rare to see a documentary which captures all of special moments in such a respectful way but does still allow us to see the ""unique"" world of vents.  The characters selections could not have been better if there was a casting call for the parts.  To experience their ups and downs at all levels of the career and life path was a memorable journey.  This film really allows us to see Terry Fator when he was struggling, married to his first wife, and was not a big Vegas headliner as he is now.  To hear him speak about his father lets you realize it does not matter how sucessful u are at your job, we all still have dissappoitments. All of the characters in someway experience their own difficulties and we are lucky enough to be there to see them all unfold.  A DONT MISS FILM FOR ANY ONE WHO ENJOYS PEOPLE, LIFE EXPERIENCES, GOOD HUMOR, PASSION, AND MOST OF ALL WANT TO PEEK INTO THE VENT WORLD AND THEIR SPECIAL VENT FAMILY.",1312243200,3,939,4.3125
4496918,5,B004XQO8OG,"I saw this film at it's Atlanta premiere and absolutely loved it.  A really touching look at a group of people most might consider misfits, but what you realize by the end is they are no different from anyone else trying to find their place in the world.  To be cliche - it made me laugh and it made me cry.  By the end you feel like great friends and champions of the primary people and want to know more about their story.",1312243200,11,424,4.0843373493975905
4496919,5,B004XQO8OG,"I was one of those folks lucky enough to attend a showing of Dumbstruck when it premiered in Washington, D.C.!  Needless to say, I loved it, and as soon as Amazon offered it on DVD, purchased a copy to show to my friends who hadn't seen it.  I thought the Directors did a masterful job in portraying the lives of the characters who made up the cast, as well as their families, and circumstances that brought them to the pinnacle of their careers as performers.  Well done!",1312156800,,472,4.402298850574713
4496920,5,B004XQO8OG,Dumbstruck is a fabulous documentary.  You will love the stories of the five ventriloquists featured.  Many of my friends have also seen this film and really enjoyed it.  I heard that it won awards at festivals across the country including the Audience Choice Award from the Friars Club in New York.,1312070400,2,299,4.823529411764706
4496921,5,B004XQO8OG,"This film was great and held my full attention for the entire duration of the film.  I actually have seen the movie a few times and it nevers gets boring!  I agree with the comment in that this is NOT a film about Terry Fator, it is better than that.  It is a film about 5 ventriloquists who vary from amateur to professional and young to old!  It follows these 5 people as they try and perfect their ventriloquist acts and perform for various audiences.  It dives into their personal lives and struggles that come along with this choice of profession as well.  There is a lot of compassion in this film and I highly recommend it to everyone!  5 stars!!!",1311724800,18,654,4.355371900826446
4496922,5,B004XQO8OG,"Dumbstruck is a truly intriguing film depicting the struggles of many and successes of few that come with the life of a ventriloquist.  The $100M man, Terry Fator, has clearly paved the way for the vents of the world but interestingly enough he doesn't seem to be the most talented in some eyes.  This film follows the lives of some very different ventriloquists where paths connect and stories evolve.  We enjoyed watching the film and we have recommended it to many of our friends who have enjoyed it as well.",1311638400,,511,4.655555555555556
4496923,1,B004XQO8OG,"I am beyond disappointed as this was representated to me by Amazon as a Terry Fator fan.  I feel the same way as the previous customer.  Just a few mere minutes of Terry Fator was not enough.  I knew Terry was going to release a new DVD and thought this was it.  I will never trust Amazon's recommemdations again.  Disappointment, frustation, and upset that I paid so much for what more accurately should have been a documentary and shown as a training tool for upcoming ventriloquists (I know the spelling is wrong so please don't come after me for that.  Save your anger for the DVD which richly deserves it.)",1311379200,2,611,4.509090909090909
4496924,2,B004XQO8OG,I was very disappointed in this DVD.  This is the first time I have purchased something that didn't already have a review and I won't do that again.  Except for the parts featuring Terry Fator (which is really why I bought this DVD) this is very BORING!  It features the struggles of Ventriloquists 'trying to make it' and their sad stories.  It is obvious Terry Fator is one-in-a-million in this field.  Again very disappointed in this DVD--I wonder how much I will get for it selling it to Half-price books?,1311292800,11,509,4.611111111111111
4496945,3,B004XQO8OG,"While the film was certainly engaging and did a lovely job following the different trajectories of its subjects, I felt that it was a bit lacking in depth overall. I would've enjoyed the film more if they had chosen to focus on only 3 people, since it would've given more time to learn about what made each of these individuals want to become ventriloquists and how their lives informed their art. It felt a bit unbalanced because there were many people of focus, but they gave Terry the most air time - even though he was the biggest outlier of the bunch given the enormity of his success. A worthy watch though, nonetheless.",1471219200,,626,4.548672566371682

I would return it if I could but where as I opened it and played it I guess I am stuck with it.  Next time I will be more careful when purchasing a DVD,1434585600,2,329,3.7246376811594204

But fhat was i n a more innocent time and today, in the 21st century, young people and adults who attempt to perform with puppets create major family dilemmas.  The reactions of former beauty pagent winner Kim's dimwit mother (who can forget her holding up her hands and twisting her miserable fingers) mocking her daughter's joy and passion?  And the cycle riding faux macho father of young Dylan lamenting about his son and his joy and passion with what can only be described as hatred and contempt.  The Terry Fator revelation of a mean spirited and jealous father who derided and demeaned his extraordinarily talented son even in success.  How many Fators out there were prevented from following their dream by mentally damaged parents?

4497063,4,B004XQO8OG,"Did you know that Fort Mitchell, Kentucky is the ""Ventriloquism Capital of the World?  No?  This fine American city hosts an annual ventriloquism convention where the hopes and dreams of talented -- and decidedly quirky -- contenders vie for the title of best -- and perhaps a Vegas contract.

Like young magicians, the art of ""throwing"" one's voice requires an obsession in which ventriloquism becomes a way of life.

Mark Goffman's fascinating and wildly entertaining film documents the quest of five driven ""vents"" to literally, effortlessly and invisibly, put words in someone -- er, something -- else's mouth. Our group includes: Dylan, a shy, middle-schooler; Kim, a former Miss Ohio; Dan, a cruise ship performer; Wilma, a six-foot-five family oddball; and Terry, a former winner on TV's ""America's Got Talent.""

SPOILER ALERT.  What's most amazing is the payoff: Terry Tator is awarded a 100 million dollar Las Vegas contract to become the most successful ventriloquist in history!  Yes, you read that right, $100,000,000.00!

Here's the American dream writ large and a reminder that anything is possible if you can speak up -- and keep your mouth shut at the same time.

What they experience from family and the paths they explore in their dream of working full time in their field. A 13 yr old school kid, a Beauty Pagent retiree doing over 300 presentations a year in schools, a full time Cruise Ship entertainer, a puppet ministry entertainer, and a competitor on America's Got Talent share their dreams and aspirations over the course of a year.
