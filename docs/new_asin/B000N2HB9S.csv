8174146,5,B000N2HB9S,"This workout is perfect for those days when you don't have time to do a full workout.  It covers all of the main muscle groups, and is challenging, even though it's only about 25 minutes long!",1233878400,4,192,4.333333333333333
8174147,5,B000N2HB9S,"I am not a college student, but I am a 38-year-old stay-at-home mom with little time to spare.  This workout fits in great with my lifestyle.  It's a 26-minute workout that gets the job done. Works all major muscle groups using your own body weight. No weights, balls, or elastic bands. You can even do it in bare feet (which I do)! The exercises are not difficult to learn. They consist of:  lunges, push ups, tricep dips, glutes, abs, and back exercises. Stretching is also incorporated into the exercises. As with all toning or strength training, if something is too difficult, you only do what you can and slowly build up.  That's how you get stronger and more fit.  I highly recommend all Joel Harper dvds.",1220313600,10,711,4.611111111111111

8174149,4,B000N2HB9S,"I bought this work out because I have limited space, for that it was perfect.  However at age 60, I found it a little to difficult and passed it on to a friend that is 30 something. She loves it.",1179100800,8,195,3.875
