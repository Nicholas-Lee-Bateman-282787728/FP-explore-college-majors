8309210,4,B001HNN9W0,I watched this movie a while ago and taped it onto a VHS.  I do hope that A Valentine Carol can be re-released on a USA Formated DVD.  I would love to add it to my movie library.,1297728000,,178,3.6578947368421053
8309211,3,B001HNN9W0,"I love Emma Caufield as Anya/Anyanka on Buffy The Vampire Slayer.  In this move she portrays Ebeneezer Scrooge whe it comes to match making.  She casts aside several wonderful men in search of the ""perfect"" man....the tradgedy is that she doesn't know the definition of perfect...she only thinks she knows.  Her dead friend Marley returns to guide her through her past, present and future.  I don't reccomend this if you're looking for a romantic movie, or an action movie, or a drama....or a comedy....or a documentary.  If you like Emma Caufield then rent it, if you can find it.",1250640000,,581,4.828282828282828
