3984488,5,B002TCRQ6S,I thought this was a great video with great information and computer animations.  I've seen many PBS/NOVA documentaries and this is the only one that I considered buying.  I don't understand some of the negative reviews here.  They material is presented with the science and doesn't try too hard to entertain (although it does).,1292025600,5,328,5.037037037037037

3984490,5,B002TCRQ6S,"So much has been learned since the days of Professor's Leakey's investigation of human origins, and this series of films takes us on a journey back 4 million years to the earliest forms of primates that walked on two legs.  According to the series, there were quite a few different species of such early hominids  - close to the missing link - until 1.5 million years ago when rapid climate fluctuations required the primates to adapt or die..and that meant ""bigger brains.""

For anyone interested in paleoanthropology - this series is a MUST SEE.  It provides new information since the considerably older ""In Search of Human Origins"" series on Nova.  Highly recommended.",1283990400,4,671,4.955357142857143
3984491,1,B002TCRQ6S,"I have to admit, I only made it about 2/3 of the way through episode #1, but to be honest, it was terrible.  I suppose if you are a fifth grade science teacher trying to keep your class quiet for an hour it might be OK, but:

1) they had about 30 seconds of animated ape/human that they reused a half a dozen times or more (especially annoying was a quick shot of the ape/human's legs as it jumped down out of a tree and started walking).

2) lots of teasers about questions they would ""answer"" later in the show, but two thirds of the way through I got tired of waiting for some substance.

3) lots of ""drama"" about the guy who found the skull of a 3-year-old similar to Lucy, but darn few facts, and darn little about how we became human.

I guess they originally had one show and the executive producers ordered them to make it into three episodes, so we get a lot of fluff and hype.  Really disappointing for a Nova documentary.

The BBC documentary on Charles Darwin is head and shoulders better than this.",1278806400,30,1011,4.261780104712042
3984492,4,B002TCRQ6S,"This three part documentary series should not be missed if you're interested in human origins.  It covers all of the phases of the human evolutionary model starting with the australopithocines moving through the neadertal and ending with us (homo sapiens).  The narration, supportive evidence and the music fits perfectly into the film.  It covers quite a lot of detail about the fosil finds but at the same time is not difficult to understand without having a background in anthropology.  The only thing I would change about this documentary is some of the animations of the early hominids.  It kept repeating a particular sequence of a young hominid walking up to an older one and making a little sound as if he was begging for food.  It was rather annoying to me.  On the other hand, I think the only reason they put that in there is to keep some peoples attention, otherwise some would just get bored and stop watching.",1277078400,2,923,4.73125
3984493,4,B002TCRQ6S,"NOVA does a great job of explaining to its audience how Homo Sapiens ultimately became the ""winner-take-all"" hominoid species.  On location photography, interviews with renowned experts, and computer-generated animation allow viewers to better understand how Homo Sapiens became the final (read current) outcome of a long evolution spread over millions of years.  Viewers should not be surprised that this investigation of our ancestors will be the subject of an updated documentary.  For example, the researchers of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology recently revised their initial conclusions that there was no interbreeding at all between Homo Sapiens and Homo Neanderthalis based on their further study of their respective ADN.  In summary, NOVA makes a noteworthy contribution to vulgarizing the science of evolutionary anthropology to the attention of a wide audience.",1275350400,19,894,5.801526717557252

3984517,3,B002TCRQ6S,"""Becoming Human"" was nicely produced.  The photography, interviews and animations were largely on point.

My ears perked up though when I noticed that major funding came from one of the Koch oil magnates.  Sure enough, the series minimized the importance of today's climate change, equating it with climate fluctuations of a few thousand years during the period when human brains became much larger.  Today's warming is happening over decades, not thousands of years, and at an unprecedented rate.  Further, when video clips extolled human control of the Earth, there was one shot of solar panels but many shots of oil rigs and cooling towers.

I have noticed in other media that conservatives tend to maximize the difference between humans and the other animals, and they did so here.  One interviewee stated, and the narrator repeated, that there is no evidence that humans and Neanderthals interbred.  Apparently that guy's study found nothing, but many other respected DNA analysts have concluded that modern humans outside Africa have from 1-4% Neanderthal DNA.

Further, they repeatedly showed an animation of an early human gazing lovingly at her companion and stated that no other animals have those pro-social feelings.  They ignore the many scientists like Frans de Waal and Jane Goodall, whose studies have demonstrated that monkeys and other great apes, both in captivity and in the wild, have strong social connections and often display empathy toward their fellows.

This is not the only Koch-funded program in which I have noticed political leanings.  It is too bad that even science is now corrupted by politically-motivated misinformation.",1483401600,18,1656,5.302681992337165

3984566,1,B002TCRQ6S,"I have a love of anthropology and archeology. I watch every documentary, read every book and article, and talk to every person who specializes in human evolution that I can. The way that this documentary is edited, written, and presented, though entertaining had many mistakes in it, most of them had to do with Neanderthals. For starts after the scientific team finished making the DNA of the Neanderthal the team found out that modern humans have 2-6% shared markers that didn't exist before modern human traveled to Europe. Another point: there is extremely strong evidence that Neanderthals had language. We have several fossils of the hyoid bone. Without this bone speech would be impossible for any and all humans. Though this bone isn't unique to the homo-family it is a key to speech other than the FOXP2 gene, and Burcha's area in the brain. All of these Neanderthals had.

I also find the opening line of ""Human: without a doubt the smartest animal on earth."" To be rather small minded. Yes, we have created, built, and imagined many things, but we can not say that we are more intelligent than any animal that can think. Birds, mice, dolphins, cats, dogs, even cockroaches and gold fish can salve problems and work out puzzles. This is new age propaganda painting humans as the pinnacle perfection of nature. I'm sorry, but with all the world's problems created by us we are not.

If it matters: it had a large contribution by David H. Koch. I am glad he's giving his money to something good, but knowing the Koch politics, I feel like his people made sure that some of the facts and information was tampered with.",1468800000,3,1625,4.738515901060071

3984574,4,B002TCRQ6S,"I did enjoy this, but it wasn't what I was expecting. It's more about showing the longevity of human evolution, dating bipedal primate like species back further than previously thought, and about prehistoric migration. I thought it was going to be more about direct natural factors that influenced specific evolutionary changes.

That stuff is covered to a smaller extent, but it's mostly glancing over various theories without exploring any of them in depth. (For example it goes into talking about different possible reasons that early primates started walking upright but didn't talk about which theories seem to be better supported or why)

This was interesting, but not quite the way I had hoped.

One thing I didn't like even a little bit was the first episode that repeatedly talked about our dissension from apes. I don't understand how a documentary on the evolutionary process can say the phrase 'descend from apes' as there is no accepted evolutionary theory that suggests such a thing. In the same segments it even talks about how modern apes and modern humans share common ancestors (which is correct) and it's trying to make the point that those common ancestors were ape like creatures.

So the makers of this do know what they are talking about  but they don't articulate it well at times. When you say 'descended from apes' in that exact language you sound like someone who's only read the Origin of Species and ignores the following century of research on evolution. That's more a fault of the writing of the narrator's script than of the actual information presented in the rest of the series. But still.",1465948800,,1623,4.930402930402931

I know many of you went to college and the professors were probably a lot like mine. Anti God, in fact we had to stomp on the Bible to show our disrespect and listen to our professors tell us what crap it is and pretty much wanted us to believe only in he, the professor as if he was god. I am not a religious person but I am not a person that will tolerate someone cramming theories down my throat when the evidence and the facts show the bible to be a trust worthy source time after time.

3984610,4,B002TCRQ6S,"Extremely well done -- with one major reservation.  Episode One persuasively argues that climate variability drove the evolution of humans, as smarter creatures had an advantage in fluctuating conditions.  Excellent.  But then the narrator, Graham Townsley, applies that to the present: ""We are creatures of climate change.""  That is an absurd extrapolation:early human history didn't involve sustaining a global population of over ten billion at the turn of the next century, at the same time as the melting of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet could raise sea levels more than a dozen feet and flood many coastal cities, making billions homeless.  It's downright reckless and dishonest to view such a catastrophe -- for which we are responsible and which we could still prevent -- with complacency.  This series was sponsored by Exxon-Mobil and David H. Koch.

3984636,2,B002TCRQ6S,"The information of the programs was somewhat accurate and consistent [I'll express my problems with information later in the review] with what I have learned from other documentaries as well as my classes and textbooks (I'm an anthropology major). My primary problem with this nova series is that it depicts human evolution through the theory of progress. They describe it as if modern humans are some perfect pinnacle of evolution, as if we are better than what came before. For all we know our species could go extinct in the next few decades because of nuclear war (or something of the like) and other hominids would have survived for a longer period than we did.

I know this idea of depicting our evolution as ""progress"" wasn't intentional, but through the format and vocabulary used it makes it very easy to view it that way.

Also there are a few pieces of information mentioned which are either very controversial or inaccurate. They make it sound as if Modern homo sapiens are the only ones who used ocher for decoration and who used shells for ornamentation. Many anthropologists believe neandertals may have also done this in some locations. Also, they say that Neandertals ate mostly meat from large game, when site along the coast of the Mediterranean have shown data suggesting that some may have eaten seafood.

I also wish they had spent a little more time discussing the neandertal genome. I am fairly certain that it is pretty widely accepted now that somewhere from around 1-4% of the dna of nonafrican individuals comes from the neandertal genome (which got there through interbreeding).

I wouldn't suggest this series to anyone who doesn't already have a background in this field. The knowledge is presented in a misleading way and overall I was disappointed with it as a whole.",1455408000,,1800,4.891803278688524

3984689,5,B002TCRQ6S,"Naturally, some of this is out of date with theories and evidence today, such as the claim that humans wiped out Neanderthals entirely with no evidence of interbreeding (we now know that all populations out of Africa have 2-4% Neanderthal or Denisovan DNA). But putting that aside, these three shows are stellar at explaining the path from our common ancestor with chimpanzees to our species today. It's important to understand where we've been to truly understand where we are going. We are still evolving today so knowing the mechanisms that act as catalysts for increasingly adaptive lifestyles is important.  I am in college now and will be transferring to obtain a Bachelor's in Science for Biology with a minor in Anthropology so this is a topic near and dear to my heart.

3984714,5,B002TCRQ6S,"My sister gave me an Amazon Fire for Christmas. It's cool to be able to lie in bed at night with this small tablet-like device and watch movies and a ton of other things with a simple Wi-Fi connection through your DSL box.

I love these science and nature shows anyway, and this one is very good, indeed. Nova, National Geographic, and The American Experience, are all completely outstanding.

I mentioned using my DSL phone box for Wi-Fi purposes. It occurs to me that many of you may be as unaware of how useful this is, as I was.
Real quick, here's the essence of it:

If you have internet service you likely use a DSL modem from your phone company, or a cable modem from your television provider.
The cable from the box to your computer is called an Ethernet connection. Wi-Fi is the ""radio version"" of this Ethernet cable.

Almost all of these boxes now provide Wi-Fi service for free. Look at your box and see if it mentions Wi-Fi. Usually, you will find an address
called the SSID under the box (or just phone your provider). When you hook up a device that uses Wi-Fi, such as a printer or laptop, all of the other boxes in your neighborhood will show as a list, like radio stations. Find your SSID and click it. You will then be asked for your access key. You get this from your phone or cable service. It will typically be about 14 characters long and look something like: a264Kn8749j32v.
You must type it exactly as given, capitals and lower case letters. Once connected, your device remembers the key phrase and you won't have to give it again.

Amazon will want me to remind you that you can now download their programming  to any smart phone for viewing. Since Wi-Fi access in your home is free, you don't use up expensive ""data plan minutes"" , as you do with say 4G phone access.

If you have a suitable device, smartphone, laptop, or tablet, I urge you to check out your Wi-Fi option. There's a ton of cool stuff waiting for your discovery. Including of course, Nova",1429401600,,1981,4.440771349862259

I welcomed the opportunity to break after each episode and give a little serious thought to what I had just seen, which in turn prepared me for what came next. If you are interested in evolution, or have any of those often provocative questions on the subject, such as what about the ""missing link"", do yourself a favor and at least give it a look. All you need to bring with you is an open mind, and prepare to be both entertained and informed as I was.",1402358400,,745,4.405797101449275

3984839,4,B002TCRQ6S,Becoming Human is a good visual depiction of early humans using animation and interweaving live apes in the setting of east Africa where anthropologists think modern man may have originated. It also shows maps depicting the direction of travel and time periods when they first left Africa. Bones and skeletons of Homo Erectus and Australopithecus are used as proof of the time period of human evolution. Neanderthals are discussed and their interaction with modern man. It is the standard accepted theory of human evolution; however there are other theories and evidence that is not shown that Neanderthal never lived in Africa. This production tells the older view that Neanderthal was an earlier group that left Africa before the later group that they think became modern man. So the question is still not resolved where Neanderthal did originate. Most important it could not account for the accelerated development of the human brain because science has not been able to do that either.,1391731200,,989,5.149068322981367

3984849,5,B002TCRQ6S,"My background is chemical eng. I like reading the cradle of civilisation, astronomy, physics, archaeology, palaeontology, biology, anthropology, electronics. I've ever seen UFO by my eyes 3 times last year, 2013, (all appeared in the sky. Other people in the area watched it also. I've 2 eye witnesses on the 2nd watched) but I also do believe God existence as I find God's wonderful creation in me & other creations too. How wonderful is my mind & body work. From the lower cast (viruses) - highest (human/ alien) until the mighty universe (galaxies, quasars, dark matter, BLACK HOLES, etc) nothing is created by chance/ coincidentally. Even until subatomic particles bcs scientists found regularities & they can formulate it (nuclear energy, particle elementary science). I can understand some scientists anti/ battle against religion and vise versa bcs they see each other in different angle.

Scientists see anything based on 100% evidence & logic way of thinking while religion(s) is made for human moral guidance only bcs in the past/ ancient time human were still wild/ sadistic. Sometimes religion could explain something but admits miracles. It also admits God(s) who created this life/ Someone who is(are) higher thn us while Budha doesn't believe in God but in reincarnation. Hwvr, correct/ true religion is teaching us about moral/ do good things for humanity. So scientists & religion they see something at different angle bcs they both are created/ exist for a specific job.

Science without religion is like human can understand how material works/ created until subatomic level (elementary particles) but they don't believe tht stones form SOS sign in a desert means someone is in danger. They thought those are created naturally. While religion without science is like our world was created only around 6,000 yrs ago (bible says 1 day on earth is 1,000 yrs in heaven) but many geological evidences indicating/ prove much much older (some billion yrs).

I do believe in evolution/ diversity  theories bcs God commanded to multiply/ full fill earth in the early creation. All creations from viruses-human are equipped wth adaptive capabilities to changing / hostile envinroments. Elvis/ M Jackson could soon be forgotten after several generations but all creations, especially human being, are the legend. It's not a simple task to keep exist & even becomes more versatile/ intelligence  frm a very simple life form in the early creation until now. Some billions yrs already and all creatures are still keep adapting themselves for new environments (eg. climate change).  So both should fulfil each other.",1389052800,,2620,5.226190476190476

3984858,3,B002TCRQ6S,"Good series overall.  Lots of good narration and animation, as well as the interesting patterns of migration of early humans throughout the world.  The later bits about climate change and adaptability, I'm sure were added or amplified at the sponsor's request...  since, it demonstrated that dramatic climate change has happened before, and that as a result - humans not only survived, but improved.  The take-away message is that even though climate change is dramatic, we will find a way to adapt and thrive.  And this is something a lot of scientists would disagree with, because it doesn't talk about human-induced climate change.  It talks about long-term changes over tens of thousands of years.  Not 50 or 100.  So while there's a lot of good science in this series, the end is a bit misleading and disingenuous.  Look at who sponsored it and take it with a large grain of salt.

3984868,3,B002TCRQ6S,"This was a great three-hour series on human evolution. It explored the archeology, genetics, and science behind our understanding of the hominids and early humans.

HOWEVER, if you watch the video I'm sure you'll notice that the first two contributors thanked for the production of Becoming Human are Exxon Mobile and Daniel Koch. You'll also notice that the series mentions numerous times that human evolution was driven in big part by changes in climate--and by extension, humans have nothing to worry about regarding the future of the planet's climate as we can adapt. The message was repeated blatantly. See the connection?

There's a huge agenda being pushed here by the oil industry! The Koch brothers are the same people behind the nationwide anti-global-warming campaign. The fact that the misinformation spread in this video was presented in the name of public broadcasting--and science!--is outrageous. These guys are also behind the production of Nova's aptly named, ""Energy: the Big Gamble,"" which is about the risks of green energy.

All in all, this was an informative series about human evolution that was tainted by vested interests from the oil industry.",1374796800,10,1171,5.251336898395722
3984869,4,B002TCRQ6S,"As the headlines states, this was interesting and informative.  I thought there were a couple places where the limits of science and truth vs. beliefs and hunches were stretched.  All in all it was interesting but I think we have a long long way to go before (if ever) we uncover the full truth of where we came from and how we got here.  This is definitely not for those who believe in that wacko concept of creationalism.",1374796800,,423,4.397435897435898

3984876,5,B002TCRQ6S,a very informative film. What amazes me is how long it takes scientists to find and clean fossils. Simply great.,1370908800,,112,4.65
3984877,5,B002TCRQ6S,This film seems like a companion film to Human Family Tree. DNA was used to show our (homo sapien) connection to Lucy (found in Africa) and the two skeleton ( one found off the coast of China and the other one in Europe) that came before her and our connection to all three skeletons. it gave one something to think about. The film is well done.,1369440000,,345,4.242424242424242

3984887,5,B002TCRQ6S,"This series by Nova is just excellent. The three segments are well put together, informative, very up to date as of 2009, and accurate. One of the best paleoanthropology videos I've seen.",1360368000,,187,4.875
3984888,5,B002TCRQ6S,"I don't think I realized when I bought this, that it contained three interrelated parts to the documentary. They all focus on slightly different parts of the study of human evolution, starting with the oldest hominids and ending with modern humans, neanderthals and homo erectus. My one complaint is that while all the parts are seperate, at first they look identical as they start out with the exact same introduction. When I started the second part at first I was afraid that the titles were just oddly placed chapter titles and that I was rewatching something that I had already seen. This was not the case, and was perhaps something that would only be noticed when watching all three sections back to back.  Overall though I really enjoyed this series. Nova always does an excellent job of keeping the science correct, and yet simplified for the general public to understand. This show does an excellent job of explaining many current theories about hominid evolution and busting the myth of the knuckle dragging neanderthal and missing links.",1358208000,,1047,4.948863636363637
3984889,5,B002TCRQ6S,"Fascinating stuff, extremely well edited and fast paced, science at its best, recommend to anyone who loves documentaries.

3984891,5,B002TCRQ6S,"Fantastic! This is a must see for everyone of all ages. If you ever wanted to know about our human origins, then you will find this documentary one of the best yet.",1351296000,,164,4.15625
3984892,1,B002TCRQ6S,"This is a very poorly written and produced program; I was extremely disappointed in ""Nova"" for sponsoring this program.

The archaeological finds were interesting to see, but the many of the hypotheses drawn from them were presented as ""fact,"" instead of ""theory.""  The interviews with some of the scientists appeared to have been heavily edited.

The CGI effects are laughable and repeated ad nauseum.  The program could have been only one episode if these sequences had been omitted.  The reasoning and conclusions were sophomoric and illogical to anyone who has ever taken a course in any science.  At one point, one hominid is described as successful due to larger body size and heavier muscling, while this same reasoning is used to explain why the Neanderthals became extinct.  Incidentally, the term ""Neanderthal"" is consistently mispronounced.

The final message we are to take away from this program is that our adaptation to climate change is the force which has formed modern human beings, so climate change will be good for us in the long run.  Sorry, I'm not buying this propaganda.  It is probably not coincidental that this series was sponsored by Exxon Mobile.

In case you were wondering, I teach college biology.",1345680000,18,1230,5.069651741293533
3984893,5,B002TCRQ6S,"While a tad outdated, at the time this series was made much of the information was up-to-date and they are careful NOT to state that anything is the final answer.  Interesting, detailed, a tad slow and sometimes filled with drama, it also has a lot of humor.  Maybe did tell me a tad too much about lice than I ever wanted to know but very well done.
Now, it was three episodes, so there is some overlap of information and, yes, they do use the computer graphics cut-scenes alot. But they assume you are watching this over a few weeks - and they just didn't change it for the DVDs.
In the end, I can't take any points away as I enjoyed it, even with all the tiny flaws.  Which are just that, tiny.  I would suggest watching this along with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Discovering-Ardi/dp/B00316DDU4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Discovering Ardi</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ice-World/dp/B002KLQ31M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ice World</a>.",1328572800,7,1042,5.973154362416107
3984894,4,B002TCRQ6S,"I use this series to introduce both what we know about the somewhat winding roads of human evolution but also the processes by which we study human evolution to a college Evolution class (I think it is more than clear enough to use with younger students, however). I especially like the segment on Homo floresiensis, which emphasizes that we continue to discover and wrestle with mysterious species and what they tell us about the arc of evolution. I emphasize multidisciplinary thinking in my classes and this series makes it clear that what we know about human evolution comes from a variety of fields, from classic paleontologists digging bones in Africa to cultural anthropologists making inferences from ancient burial sites to molecular geneticists extracting ancient DNA from Neanderthals. Along those lines, they present a very nice introduction to molecular clocks that they use throughout the three videos. As with any video of this nature, there is a bit more story-telling than I wish there were - particularly the story about Turkana boy that strays quite far from the narrative about the evidence - but overall, it represents the best and most up-to-date and modern understanding of human origins available at this point in time.",1322179200,6,1243,5.12807881773399

It focuses on the specific scientific procedures and techniques from the fields of Anthropology, Archaeology, and Paleontology that have been utilized in the enduring search for a greater understanding of the evolution of humans from their hominid predecessors. It provides an introductory overview of the anatomical, cognitive, and adaptive changes which have facilitated this transition, during the remarkable development of the present-day human being, that has transpired over millions of years.
