2421239,5,B000BKDNX0,"I am not a professional reviewer.  I have seen the ""Elizabeth R"" series on Masterpiece Theatre and also the most recent ""Elizabeth"" with Cate Blanchett.  They were both excellent in their way and genre.  Robert Hardy played the Earl of Leceister in the original ""Elizabeth R"" and Thomas Hardy plays the same role in ""The Virgin Queen"".  I don't think they are related.  I did not expect to like this series.  Now I LOVE it.  First of all, Elizabeth was barely 25 years old when she ascended the throne.  And she knew Robert Dudley as a child.  He was proclaimed one of the handsomest men in England.  When you watch this movie you realize that for all her great intelligence and advanced book learning, she was a young and impressionable woman.  Watch them dance in front of the Archduke's ambassador in part one.  The music and the way they look at one another, it pulls your heart.  Imagine spending the formative years of your life under threat of a perpetual death sentence only to become not only FREE but top of the heap so to speak.  Watch when they come to tell her she is Queen.  The music and the look on her face.  When she runs to the tree outside of Hatfield house.  The music alone makes this series memorable.  See this as a slice of true life.  When I was 25 years old my aunt called me a ""kid"".  When I see photos of that time, I realize what she meant now. Her court at her accession were a very young group of people.  Sadly she outlived most of peers and was later surrounded by those who did not know her as a young and vibrant queen.  Enjoy this series.  And this actress does a fantastic older queen as well.  Especially when she ""forgives that fart"" of one of her courtiers in her old age.  What really happened was he bowed to her at one point and a massive FART slipped out.  He left the country and traveled for SEVEN years.  When he returned and was presented again at court one of the first things she said was ""I had forgot that fart"".

Watch it!",1133827200,25,1976,4.310626702997276
2421240,4,B000BKDNX0,"I always like the PBS Masterpiece Theatre series because they make sure that they do a good job with their movies. I'm not someone who likes movies made for tv because most of them are pretty poor, but not those by PBS, and I loved this movie. I think that it depicted Queen Elizabeth I, pretty well.

The movie starts with Elizabeth being locked up in the tower with her two friends, Kat and Lettice. Elizabeth's sister Queen Mary I sees her as a threat but doesn't want to execute her and locks her up in the tower. Elizabeth of course is worried for her future but when her sister dies of a tumor, then she is elected to be queen. Thus begins the reign of the Virgin Queen and the Elizabethan era, her affair with the married Robert Dudley and her desire to remain single and not be ruled over by a man. Its difficult to pin down Elizabeth because she isn't a one dimensional character, she was a most complex person.

She had a temper, liked to swear, and other such things. She wasn't perfect, history tells us this and the PBS series depicts that. Anne-Marie Duff does a wonderful job as Queen Elizabeth I and she looks so much like her. Tom Hardy is quite sexy as Robert Dudley, but I was quite confused because he wore an earring and gentlemen back in the day didn't wear them. I would give this movie five stars but I got a little confused about politics towards the second half of the movie.

Anyhow, the whole cast did a fantastic job with their characters. The costumes are gorgeous and the sets are wonderful as well, I've never seen the Cate Blanchett movie because its rated R and I don't want to see any gruesome things and thus this is a perfect movie to learn about Elizabeth and what she was all about.",1133568000,5,1721,4.338509316770186
2421241,3,B000BKDNX0,"I watched this recently on PBS with high hopes of learning more about England's Gloriana, Elizabeth I. Instead what I got was a cocquettish performance by Anne-Marie Duff who choses to portray Elizabeth as a shrewish brat who seems to be thinking with her groin instead of her head. The film focuses on her relationships with Robert Dudley and with Dudley's stepson, Robert Devereaux. This Elizabeth flirts, and screams in tantrums, but shows little of the diplomacy and finesse that the real Elizabeth had. While it's certainly a very pretty film to look at in terms of costume and settings, the portrayals of Elizabeth by Glenda Jackson (still the best!), Cate Blanchett and Bette Davis still are far better than this trivial tripe.",1133395200,9,734,4.975609756097561
2421242,4,B000BKDNX0,"Overall, I thought this is one of the better Elizabeth films. True, its no ""Elizabeth R"" but that mini-series was able to do so much more because of its length. Duff really looks like Elizabeth and I liked that they did play off of the queen's vanity and insecurities about her body. I teach British Literature to undergraduates and I'm hoping this film will help give them a little more understanding of the era. Yes, its been modernized. Yes, its portrayal of Amy Robsart's death irked me. Yes, ""Elizabeth R"" is better. But in a classroom with students who maybe saw the Cate Blancett film, I think it will be useful.

Just as a film, it is beautiful, well acted and engaging. The sound track is particularly effective.",1133395200,43,721,4.6328125
2421243,3,B000BKDNX0,"Tudor enthusiasts, such as myself, will obviously make comparisons of this series to the Holy Grail of Elizabeth portrayals - that being Glenda Jackson in the 1970's Masterpiece Theatre mini-series ""Elizabeth R"".  Anne Marie Duff is no  Glenda Jackson.  I think she made for a more subdued Elizabeth, especially in part I of this mini-series.  ""Elizabeth R"" is also a much longer mini-series (9 hours) so it delves more deeply into historical occurrences.

I was constantly distracted by Duff's middle-class English accent, but I am a purist - just call me stuffy.  Fortunately, most people will not notice this, especially in the United States.  One favorable factor for Duff is that I happen to think she resembles Elizabeth more than any other actress that has ever portrayed the Queen.  If you look at the famous unfinished miniature of Elizabeth by Isaac Oliver, a portrait that experts regard as a very authentic likeness, Anne Marie Duff is a dead-on resemblance (which is probably a major factor in her obtaining this part).

As for the acting, much of the language has been modernized and not as true to the authentic speeches and quotes from the Queen. ""Elizabeth R"" is more authentic in this regard.  The costumes and sets were probably the major stars of this film.  I did admire the fact that they didn't throw her in bed with Robert Dudley (Elizabeth's great love) as they do in my most portrayals.  Also, most speculative occurrences, like how Amy Robsart died (suicide, accident or murder)  or Mary, Queen of Scott's coded letters of treason, are given artistic license;  the script writers freely provide their own version of what actually happened, ignoring historical fact.

In conclusion, I think it did a fine job showing the Queen to be the strong and brave woman devoted to her Kingdom and people that she undoubtedly was. This is an admirable presentation, and a far better and more authentic portrayal than Shekkar Kapur's disaster ""Elizabeth"" with Cate Blanchett.  Although loved by many, Kapur's ""Elizabeth"" is widely regarded as historical garbage and detested by most Tudor enthusiasts.",1133308800,11,2115,5.0344827586206895
2421244,5,B000BKDNX0,"This is a very interesting programme, produced in Britain and originally shown on the PBS series, Masterpiece Theatre.

This miniseries was directed by Coky Giedroyc, a veteran of television productions in Britain, including another royal-themed miniseries, 'William and Mary', in 2003.  Giedroyc brings an interesting modern twist to the series - rather than filming things in majestic, sweeping camera pans with classical music as a background, and rather than having the dialogue (and acting) be in a stilted, falsely formal style, Giedroyc incorporates modern music with medieval and Celtic flavouring to it (both of which have experienced a renaissance of sorts in the past decade), and the situations are decidedly modern without being out of place in their own times.

This presents the life of Elizabeth from her young adulthood under Queen Mary, as a supposed participant in intrigues against the Catholic Queen, through to her death after serving decades on the throne of England as the Virgin Queen, the queen who never married.  In fact, the miniseries plays a tantalising game with Elizabeth's virginity, showing her desires (as well as those around her) without ever giving up the game of 'was she or wasn't she?'  Anne-Marie Duff  plays the part of Elizabeth, and does a remarkably able job for such a complex figure.  Duff won the Irish Television award and was nominated for the BAFTA award for best actress in a television drama in another series, 'Shameless', last year.

Duff is joined by Tom Hardy, who plays the role of Robert Dudley, the favourite of Queen Elizabeth.  Dudley is also an extraordinarily complex role, as he played several sides in the political struggles during Elizabeth's early reign, and was part of a family well experienced in regal intrigue - Robert Dudley's family had tried to manage the reign of Elizabeth's brother Edward, engineer the accession of Lady Jane Grey (placing Guildford Dudley on the throne with her), and is sometimes referred to as 'the uncrowned kings of England'.  In fact, perhaps the most stunning single scene in this miniseries is after Elizabeth has elevated Robert Dudley to the earldom of Leicester, and during her illness, he sits upon the throne as the protector of the realm.  Hardy is well suited to this role, and plays it with skill.

The sets are appropriate to their time period, neither too ornate nor too medieval; the costumes also have a touch of modernity to them, but are still primarily of the period.  The situations presented give good insight into the overall pattern of Elizabeth's reign and some of the principal concerns during that time period, although to compress such a long reign into such a short time frame as a four-hour miniseries by necessity means that the history has had to be selectively chosen.  Elizabeth faced problems from without and within, many of which were far more complex and pressing than her marriage issue.  In the end, Elizabeth made the right decision for the time, if not for the future.

This is a great production for television, and holds up well against other major productions featuring the Virgin Queen Elizabeth of a few years ago.",1132444800,163,3163,5.019120458891013
2421255,5,B000BKDNX0,"A two-part episode that left me weeping. Anne-Marie Duff's brilliant depiction of the virgin queen was deeply moving. Thank you to the editors who composed the flashback overlays with Dudley's (Tom Brady (awesome) memory, and the narrator's silky voice, and especially the Medieval Baebes soundtrack which floated throughout the entirety of this artistic depiction.

2421270,2,B000BKDNX0,"Not as good as I had hoped.  Elizabeth's portrayer may have been cast for her resemblance to the queen rather than her skill.  She plays the intense scenes with appropriate vigor, but the lighter scenes bring odd, painful smiles and an empty jauntiness.  The story line is disjointed, especially as the reign wears on, but what else can be done with such a span of time?  Overall, I don't recommend this version.",1494979200,3,412,4.680555555555555

2421281,5,B000BKDNX0,"I think the actress who plays Elizabeth I is the best compared to the others - Anne-Marie Duff brings a grounded spirit to the late and great queen's personality that historians have remarked in their personality assessments of the actual queen. Also, I have watched this many times along with other movies about Elizabeth I - think this is the best one by far.

2421447,3,B000BKDNX0,"Masterpiece Theatre's 2-part ""Elizabeth I - The Virgin Queen"" has a lot going for it. Enough, in fact, that it generally succeeds as an engaging historical drama. Anne-Marie Duff gives a laudable lead performance as the titular monarch, supported by an able cast which includes the likes of Joanne Whalley, Tara Fitzgerald and Emilia Fox even in relatively brief roles. The emphasis is on Elizabeth as a flesh-and-blood woman, and the key close relationships of her reign  first and foremost her decades-long untenable passion for Robert Dudley, played by Tom Hardy, whose unaffected studliness fills the bill nicely.

The film is blemished by the distractions of a few minor details (e.g., the graying fake moustache affixed to Hardy late in the action, which appears to have been procured at the 99-cent store) and one not-minor one: the cinematography. Credited to the curiously surnamed David Odd, the camera's proximity to its subjects suggests that perhaps Mr. Odd took a conceptual intention to make an ""intimate"" film far too literally. For relatively contained interior scenes the strategy works well enough, even if it does lead to the odd curious bit of visual framing. The full shortcomings of the ""nothing-wider-than-a-two-shot"" choice are most glaring in scenes with any appreciable amount of physical action, e.g., a duel with swords, a tennis match, an insurrection in the streets, etc. In such sequences the camera jostles dizzyingly about, and no momentary focus on an individual is without a quick cut. If the intention was to position the viewer ""right in the middle of the action,"" no mind was paid that cinematically, a little of that effect goes a long way. More than a little of it simply leaves the viewer wondering what the hell is going on, and why he or she can't get a good look at it.

If you watch ""The Virgin Queen,"" do so for the performance of Anne-Marie Duff. She achieves a fully-realized dramatic portrait of an Elizabeth whose 40-year reign was a continuous struggle to assert and maintain political authority, at the cost of any chance of romantic fulfillment. If your desire is a historical epic on a scale larger than one individual, though, you would be best advised to look elsewhere.",1460332800,9,2227,4.997304582210242
2421448,5,B000BKDNX0,"Ann-Marie Duff is an excellent Elizabeth I.  She played a younger and older Elizabeth I, I like the fact that she looked younger and then with makeup she was made to look older. There was more emotion in this version of Elizabeth I I just loved it.",1459987200,,248,4.276595744680851
2421449,5,B000BKDNX0,Masterpiece Theater is one of my absolute favorite programs. I am an Anglophile at heart and a history lover.

2421478,5,B000BKDNX0,"The story of Good Queen Bess has been produced more times than I can remember, her non affair with Robert Dudley  Her battles with Mary Queen of Scots which led to the  Scots Queens execution. He decision not to marry and to carry the weight of the realm on her shoulders and her patronage of Dudley's step son The Duke of Essex. Which led to an ill conceived attempt to take the crown from her have been well documented cinematicaly. What makes this production stand out are the performances of Anne Marie Duff ( Late of Shameless) and Tom Hardy ( Legends, Mad Max) There's is an awkward chemistry as she keeps him at bay sexually, while allowing him to dream of a place in her bed. She is mercurial with her affections and banishes him almost in every scene, yet her reliance on him for emotional support continues to grow. Hardy's Dudley is himself a man of moods melancholy and entitled being just a few. Duff gives Elizabeth a solid self reliance as it becomes apparent she will have to fight tooth and nail to be considered 'more than a mere woman'. The production is beautifully staged and the ensemble surrounding the leads give excellent support . In the second part we see an older Elizabeth who in later life no longer commands the respect of her courtiers. Illustrated by two giggling ladies in waiting who go through her personal effects and openly mock her slightly mad dancing. The loss of Dudley and her oldest adviser Henry Cecil, bring her to this low point. She is humiliated in her chamber by Essex. And we see a rapid decline in her health. Duff makes the transition from young to old with the help of incredible make up and she carries the older Bess with a weariness that 40 years on the throne have bestowed on her. All in all a very satisfying viewing experience",1457481600,17,1787,4.512345679012346

If you are familiar with Elizabeth and those close to her at court, you will recognize the main players, but if not, it takes a while to figure out who's who, or why they matter.",1456617600,,432,4.684210526315789

2421512,5,B000BKDNX0,"Monarchy, of course, is inferior egovernment, but as for that, Elizabethh the First of England stands out as the greatest autocrat. Extremely educated, highly intelligent, spirited, musical, talented, shrewd, and dedicated and loyal to her loved people, England, and peace.
She did not seek to control people's religion, and she insisted on a 'balanced budget' as it were. She had the good setnse to suround herself with competent and trustworthy advisors of the caliber of Wiliam Cecil and Francis Walsingham. She inspired greatness in the likes of writers Ben Jonson and William Shakespeare, a sailor in the person of Francis Drake, who served her well most especially in England's defense against the invading Spanish Armada in 1588. Elizabeth traveled to the coast to stand before her troops during that siege. She spoke thusly: ""I know I have the body of a weak and feeble woman, but I have the heart and stomach of a king, and of a king of England too.""

This is a story that bears telling over and over again, and I applaud that effort.",1455580800,,1043,4.859550561797753

The reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 was the makeup. In the middle of the series the time jumps ahead 10 years which in my estimation Elizabeth wouldn't have been that old, but when we next see her they have made her not only look ancient but also look like a monster. The makeup person for this series should have been fired. It was without a doubt the worst I have ever seen. So bad that it distracted from the story for me.",1453766400,,602,4.153846153846154

I would give this negative stars as well if possible. If the sound track had at least been not so loud, I could have possibly overlooked it a bit, considering the marketing to a very broad audience and could have watched more (at least to knit socks), but as it was, it simply induced an immediate tension headache. I tried watching it twice and still only got through about 25 minutes. No third try, I will look for something else.",1451865600,,556,4.355769230769231
2421577,3,B000BKDNX0,"Anne-Marie Duff and Tom Hardy both give excellent performances, but the effect is spoiled somewhat by the insane camera work and musical score. Even for a BBC production, the camera work on this miniseries is awful. It looks like it was shot on an unsteady handheld camcorder with digital zoom. The shots are always held close to the actors faces, with their hands or other actors' noses haphazardly intruding in the frame. After a few hours of this, I really wished I could see the rest of them, because I felt like it really cut off their gestures as part of their performance. The soundtrack is twinkly post-rock guitar music. I have no idea why. It's terrible.
Other than that, the costumes and sets are great. I give the production huge credit for not putting Tom Hardy in some terrible wig like he's been forced to wear in almost every other period piece he's in. The focus on vanity and repressed sexual desire as a main driving force in Elizabeth's reign got a little old after a while. Couldn't the writers have found at least some drama in the way such an extraordinary woman dealt with the political struggles of her time?",1451779200,2,1133,4.6138613861386135

2421652,5,B000BKDNX0,"A wonderful production that emphasizes Queen Elizabeth's personal/private far more than her political, social or cultural achievements as  monarch.
Terrific music score that adds a certain contemporaneity to the entire production. Superb acting all around, particularly by the young actress who portrayed the queen.  One of her detractors referred to her in her old age as a ""dying carcass"" (or something like that); and the superb make-up work that showed the toll of her many years in the second half of the production, made that description and honest, if not charitable, one!",1445558400,,579,5.282608695652174

2421689,3,B000BKDNX0,"Interesting story. Well done. I enjoy seeing how people lived and worked. It would have helped to have a little background at the start to understand the situation between Elizibeth and Mary. Plus, more infformation on what and why things were happening would help. Someone with a stong background in Enland's monarchy would be able to make sense of the story quickly, but those of us with less knowledge had to struggle a bit.

2421924,5,B000BKDNX0,"Complex story played wonderfully by Ms. Duff.  One is left with the impression of Elizabeth I as a very formidable and effective courtier and leader, while also having vulnerabilities.  Interesting to see the background vignettes of the Queen's subjects engaged in mock theater mimicking the Queen's actions.  I might have liked to see more of the other famous contemporaries (Drake, Shakespeare, Marlowe, etc.) for added historical reference, but the staging of the long record of Elizabeth's life requires much editing to fit into a few hours of video.",1435968000,,554,5.2727272727272725

2421929,2,B000BKDNX0,ultradramatizing the infatuation over ran the principle issues and the phases of the political / religious intrigue & machinations were left out.......at least up to the point where I left the film out of embarrassment for the actors who deserved better.,1435449600,,254,5.219512195121951

2421933,5,B000BKDNX0,"This is clearly the best rendering of the relationship between Elizabeth and Dudley ever made.  The mini-series is lush in production values and the acting is superb. As we know, Anne-Marie Duff and Tom Hardy went on to become two of the best actors we have performing today. Don't miss this. It's an exceptional Masterpiece Classic.",1435276800,,333,4.946428571428571
2421939,5,B000BKDNX0,"I really enjoyed this movie. It shows the down side of being born into royalty during that time period. Elizabeth 1 was surely a very strong woman She was quick to trust her own mind to make the best choices for England.  After watching this movie I would rather be a peasant in that era than a member of the royal family. Royals had to live much like a wild animal in the jungle, always alert to danger everywhere around them. There were very few people they could trust and even those people could change sides very quickly.",1435276800,,526,4.36734693877551

2421945,4,B000BKDNX0,"Liked it, also liked the Elizabeth starting Helen Mirren.  The one with Helen Mirren was a little easier to follow.  I wished I had more information about the Tutors, as the background information is valuable in watching these movies.

I also enjoyed the series about Henry VIII and The White Queen.",1434672000,,299,4.823529411764706

2421947,4,B000BKDNX0,"You cannot condense the life of one of the greatest rulers of England into a short series.  Having said that, the series gives us a taste of Elizabeth's reign.  Elizabeth is enigmatic, virtuous and flirtatious.  She is a woman, ruler and despot, at times.  She hates, loves and must strike a balance to ensure that her kingdom survives and flourishes.

2422020,4,B000BKDNX0,"IMO, in this 2-episode program, Elizabeth is portrayed more realistically than in most versions. Its major shortcoming is that it attempted to show her entire life from just before becoming queen to her death in a short 3.8 hours. Doesn't work. Elizabeth I presided over one of the most prosperous eras England has ever had, and probably because of the limited amount of time, none of that was mentioned.

Note: If, like me, you have lost much of your hearing above 4000 Hz, you will not like several places where the music comes thru louder than the words, so it's difficult to hear what the characters are saying. I don't know why producers/directors feel they MUST play music in scenes that need none.",1433721600,,704,4.723577235772358

The makeup got worse and worse as they made the actors/actresses look older, so at the end it was not visually engaging because seeing the make up distracted me from the rest of the story line.",1432857600,,385,4.175675675675675

2422075,3,B000BKDNX0,"Great acting and costumes, but at times I found the way the film was put together tedious. There was too much emphasis on the music, which was often repetitive. Also, even though I felt at first pausing on and drawing out the emotional impact on the characters was creative, over time I felt it was really tedious and found myself skipping through the movie to get past these scenes.  Though Elizabeth was played beautifully, the script focused mainly on the emotional highs and lows of Elizabeth's life, especially in regards to her clandestine romantic relationship. Though you go the sense that she was a powerful person it seemed to convey that she was that way primarily because she remained a virgin and refused to be dominated by a man.  The strategic nature of her mind, her courage, her will, her ability to navigate gigantic sized crises in her country were all downplayed.  These were the very things that made her great.  I was sad to see the script minimize these things.  I much preferred the HBO version with Helen Mirren as Elizabeth.  A great actress given a much better script to work with.",1431129600,,1108,4.715025906735751

This version of Elizabeth I rule on the throne of England was well acted though some license was taken with historical facts.  I really liked Anne-Marie Duff''s portrayal of Elizabeth - she brought lightness (Elizabeth was only 25 when she became queen) but she was, by all historical accounts, a wonderful prince.  I, personally, feel Elizabeth was a better ruler than her father, Henry VIII.",1431043200,,520,4.7555555555555555

2422115,4,B000BKDNX0,"An extremely well done version of the ""Elizabeth"" saga, despite being 10 years old.  I wasn't too familiar with Anne-Marie Duff, but she was outstanding in the E. role; in fact, I'd rate her performance above Cate Blanchett's more recent interpretation.  Two small negatives; the plot is a bit hard to follow unless one really knows specific historic details about the era, and Tom Hardy's casting as E.'s paramour (he looks like a college student for most of the pic).",1429574400,,469,4.85

The only problem with this DVD is that when it plays in the dvd player, it's stretched out so they look ""fatter"". It bothers me so much! Forget trying to ""zoom"" the image, it may fix the image proportion but  it makes the quality horrible. I'm not sure why they couldn't have just put smaller black bars on the top & bottom. It's obvious this movie was not meant to play on 16x9 TVs. Such a shame because its a GREAT movie.",1429488000,,529,4.29

Additionally, the acting was awful. Or perhaps a combination of direction and screenplay. There were public arguments of things which would be considered secret. The queen's personality was just mean and nasty - smug, lascivious. I didn't like any of the characters.

The STARZ mini series was much better. The Cate Blanchett portrayal is much better. A rerun of  Lassie would be much better.",1429142400,5,601,4.546296296296297

The cast was not the problem, a lot of really good actors from other HBO and BBC series were part of this so I had great expectations. The sound was bad, and cheapened the whole production.

2422224,5,B000BKDNX0,"While there are other excellent films about the life of Elizabeth I, they all seem to fall prey to the temptation of a formulaic approach to depicting her political maneuverings, romances and the treacherous pitfalls of life at court in general.

the make-up dept. mercifully was instructed not to making everybody look like they just just stepped through the Red Door at Elizabeth Arden, which can be a lot of fun but it's simply not realistic; ditto for the costume designers and the jewelry fabricators.

the director and cast of gifted actors raise the bar for their peers with their impressive talents and abilities to weave the threads of this docu-drama with a deftness and subtlety that is simply obliterated from more recent period costume dramas.
the actors gracefully fence with their dialogue like rapiers and the consequences of their aspirations and maneuverings reveal a wealth of unspoken deceits and other political machinations worthy of any political thriller of our own times.

The soundtrack is a wonder.",1425427200,,1025,5.125748502994012

2422287,4,B000BKDNX0,"I am writing this review as someone who enjoys history but is not an expert in the subject.  I have a fascination for period pieces which leads me to watch most films of various eras- I like to compare them to one another and see the various perspectives.  That, more than history books, helps me to understand the complexities of what actually happened and who ended up 'writing history'.  As we all know, whomever wrote the history books got to tell only their viewpoint.  What actually happened may never be known to anyone but those who actually lived during those years.  I liked this film because it didn't over glamorize Elizabeth's beauty- neither did it over glamorize Mary, Queen of Scotts, for that matter.  I also liked that it showed more of her history than her ascension to the throne.  Most movies seem to focus on only her youth.  I didn't realize that Dudley continued to be a close advisor to her in her later reign.  Or, is that creative license?  I found it interesting how they interpreted her as using Dudley's affection as a way to keep her suitors at arms distance and found him to be a threat once he became single- I had never heard that interpretation before.  I had also not heard that she might have supported Robert Devereux which such high favor because she might have thought him to be the son of Robert Dudley.  That was interesting.  On a humorous note, I found the tooth pulling scene to be hilarious.  In any case, I found the make up, costumes, set and overall filmmaking to be of the highest quality and truly enjoyed this movie throughout.  I was completely horrified by Elizabeth's teeth as an older woman and can only hope that it was not as bad as all that.  I hope that was not a bow to English stereotypes.  So why only four stars and not five?  I don't know.  I reserve five stars for those movies that take me to the next level in emotion.  This one, for all its great quality, didn't do that.  I enjoyed it, but it didn't move me.  Thus, the four stars.",1418947200,,2001,4.43956043956044

2422319,4,B000BKDNX0,"Yet another look at one of the most significant periods in history.  As we all know, history repeats itself, though clearly in different settings.  Elizabeth the First was instrumental in establishing Western Europe and began the creation of an empire that lasted to a large degree until Elizabeth the 2nd.  This particular version varies a bit, but is as exciting as, say, Cate Blanchett in the same role.  This Elizabeth comes closest the Betty Davis role.  I would guess that this Elizabeth is most like the actual Elizabeth.  She conveys the depth of her character through her face and one feels her authority through her words and actions.  As with all directors, the drama is more important than actual history as it is written.

2422335,5,B000BKDNX0,"Stupendous acting both by Duff as Elizabeth and Hardy as Robert Dudley.  Stunning performances and a quite nice change in the usual soundtrack score for a history piece.  It's odd how most motion picture arts lovers here in the US only know Tom Hardy by Bane in the latest Batman.  Tom Hardy has a quite impressive list of credits done.  It seems to me one in Europe would know of him far more than here in the US,  I don't know how distribution works in the movies.  Nonetheless, he's one of the most stunning actors I've ever seen and I've been watching for 62 years.  His details and 'small movements' like his eyes in any scene tell a whole story themselves.  These kinds of very important but small details can't be in the script nor does it seem any director micromanages his film.  The actor's artistry and mind invent them sometimes as they go I hear ... Robert De Niro being one superfamous example of this. I hope to goodness Tom Hardy can handle the fame.  Bronson, a low budget film was a 'nobody knows it movie' but I think it's strongly headed to be a cult classic.  Excellence in art still lives.  A scene in the Virgin Queen shows a dance with Elizabeth and Robby ... that scene would stand up anywhere for all time in Hollywood scenes.  I don't say the best ... silly term ... but the kissing of his own hand in lining up beside her and then her following the gesture for herself and the three throws of her into the air, the man gradually leaving her down.  I'm a guy and that was one beautifully romantic depiction of Elizabeth's and Robby's love.  Tom Hardy played in Warrior.  Stunning.  Tough, tough, tough guy.  For some of you who are interested in this man's breadth of acting go to YouTube and through his name and 'The Reckoning' look at the 'beautiful' woman in that 60 second scene.  Tom Hardy, doing a woman with long black hair and mascara is BEAUTIFUL !  The guy who does Bane in this scene and another movie is BEAUTIFUL as a woman.  I was timid as a man to admit that given my personal orientation in human relations.  He transforms ... almost literally.  It seems impossible but Tom Hardy can do it and would hold rank with anybody in the 20th century.  He's young, so we'll need to see.  Sir Lawrence Olivier with very little make-up playing the Nazi hunter Lieberman in 'The Boys from Brazil' and the infamous Dr. Mengele with Dustin Hoffman in 'Marathon Man'.  Hardy could do this as well.  We're in the rare air now.",1416441600,,2455,4.421875

The depiction holds true to recorded history in most all aspects of Elizabeth's reign, closing w/her death following 45 years on the English throne. Her reign was one of the most successful of the English ruling royalty and she was beloved of her subjects, having earned the sobriquet, Good Queen Bess.

2422402,4,B000BKDNX0,"I enjoyed this historical series of a true Queen. For me watching this had me in tears. Why? Because of a sense of such sadness for Elizabeth taking on such a Big part in history. Which had so much loss for her at such a young tender age of 25 yrs old. The way the movie depicts certain things about her life was really hurtful to see such hatefulness and misunderstandings towards the Queen from people who clearly sees her as a person not suitable to be the Queen.  I was very surprised by how long she held out with the grief of loosing her two most loyal men in her life. Her childhood love who her kingdom forbid her to marry and her most trusted right hand. I believe Elizabeth was the way she was because of fear of letting her people down as well as fear of how they may see her. That is why she chose the path of not marrying as that of intimacy issues with being with a man. She didn't see herself as beautiful. The one flaw that most of us have is not liking who we are and how we look. Although this appeared to be some what truth Queen Elizabeth held her own as a woman,a leader,a friend and that of a Queen. She was a Queen who loved her people and put them first and that is why she chose not to marry in my opinion. She chose the love for her country over the love of her life. Which says to me that this she was the rightful heir to the thrown. Not because of birth,But because of great strength and sacrifice on her part. She put the need of the country and what the country needed above her own. She to me was a True Queen!!",1410566400,,1543,4.026058631921824

Food for thought for anyone interested in this reign,and that time. There were even a few new facts I learned. All in all - well worth the multi- hour binge watch.",1409788800,,408,4.927536231884058
2422409,4,B000BKDNX0,Nice interpretation of Eliz I character/personality.  Dramatization of historical record is well done and while there is some condensing of the time line and some embellishment the story is not diminished.  Elizabeth was extravagant with her clothing - wish there was more lavish clothing to look at.,1409097600,,300,5.361702127659575

2422456,4,B000BKDNX0,"This was better than I expected and got better as it went along.  The production quality was very high.  Make up is extraordinary. They don't ""Hollywoodize"" the older Elizabeth I.  This film covered events like Queen Elizabeth I being close to death when she had smallpox, that she didn't have any hair later in life and that she had bad teeth. It was far more historically acurate in that regard than the Cate Blanchett, Helen Mirren or even Judi Dench portrayals of her.  All the characters are well played.  I would recommend this version for students.",1404864000,,555,4.739583333333333

2422468,4,B000BKDNX0,Wonderful.  I was a bit confused about mary at the beginning of the movie thinking she was mary queen of scots.  I knew she was beheaded and didn't die in her bed.  The story did not track with what I knew.  Guess it's back to the history books for me.,1402876800,,252,3.98
2422469,4,B000BKDNX0,This first season was a great depiction of the era providing details and dramas of the people and the politics on a day to day basis. Anyone that has read the many historical fictions written about this era would enjoy watching this,1402790400,,232,4.5476190476190474

2422483,5,B000BKDNX0,The acting was superb and the sets were authentic and lavish.  I absolutely loved Tom Hardy as Robert Dudley.  He magically transforms into his characters.....Anne-Marie Duffy was good- very believable as Elizabeth.  Thoroughly enjoyed this!,1399852800,,241,5.828571428571428

2422496,4,B000BKDNX0,"Masterpiece Theater has done a very good job of portraying the princess to Queen Elizabeth. The one thing that did not come across as clearly as the movies with Cate Blanchett  is how truly fierce and incredibly intelligent the Queen was. The focus was clearly on her adoration of ""Robin""and then his son. Everyone is curious about those relationships and we will never really know what went on between the Queen and the men she loved. Still, I enjoyed watching this portrayal of her life and times.",1397952000,,499,4.735632183908046

Excellent performances from Anne-Marie Duff as the Virgin Queen and Tom Hardy (yes Bain himself) as her life long unrequited love- the Earl of Leicester.

2422514,5,B000BKDNX0,"This drama based on the life of Elizabeth I focuses on her liaison with Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, and his stepson Robert, Earl of Essex. Though not precisely historical, the miniseries is attractively filmed, and the lead Anne-Marie Duff plays Elizabeth to the hilt, from young princess to aging and sour-faced queen. The famous speech at Tilbury seems to be a requisite of any life of Elizabeth, and it's here, on the eve of her victory over the Spanish Armada (mostly helped by a titanic storm) but the military intrigues are often off-screen. It's the intrigue to keep her or get her off the throne that takes center stage.

Tom Hardy plays an excellent Robert Dudley and he's aged from beautiful youth to tired middle-aged or almost-middle aged man well by some terrific make up artistry. The costuming is equally beautiful, often focusing on the jewels rather than the ""twenty pounds of gorgeousness"" as I heard someone once describe Tudor costume.

The music is a mix of chanting by Bulgarian women's choirs (that sound is unmistakable and haunting), new compositions by Martin Phipps and Latin chanting by the Mediaeval Baebes. It's stunning music, sad that the soundtrack is not available except at ridiculous asking prices. It really adds to the drama. While not ""Elizabeth R"" with Glenda Jackson, it's well worth seeing and quite enjoyable.",1396137600,,1358,5.004424778761062

The actors, the costumes, the sets are all more true to a realistic Tudor court than one sees in Hollywood extravaganzas.

It showed how cautious and truly educated she was before she made decisions that might engage her people in war. The Oueen was her own person; obviously,  a true daughter of Anne Bolyen and King Henry the VIII. Her mother, Anne Boylen, chose to be beheaded rather than divorced so her daughter may sit on the throne of England. Anne-Marie Duff was true to  character.",1394064000,,596,4.701923076923077

While some freedom with details is apparent - details regarding Elizabeth's relationship with both Robbies, as example - I think it helps to make a good story, and to fill out the character that is Elizabeth.  It was refreshing to not see a true beauty in the role of Queen, as so many other productions would've done.  I think the truly best affect of the miniseries was to drive me to reread details on the ruling of Elizabeth I, as well as the history leading up to her time as Queen.  There is some truly stunning history surrounding the Tudors, and I wish Masterpiece would do a detailed series for all of it.  As it is, I'm afraid anyone truly looking for the natural ""more"" associated with this version of Elizabeth will stumble across the Showtime series - fine for entertainment, but not much else.",1392249600,,918,4.506024096385542

This sleeper is an exception to the rule.

Incredible acting and intelligent editing make this series a riveting, entertaining version of Elizabeth I's life.

If you enjoy history and a very non-Hollywood take on a vital piece of English history, I recommend. This series is highly focused on Elizabeth's and Robert Dudley's much speculated relationship. But it's not ooey-gooey love story. It's the reality of choosy duty over desire - which can get pretty ugly.

My only critique is a highly repetitive banshee-sounding chorus any time drama ensues. But watch it (you'll see what I mean and overlook it ... maybe).",1391990400,,765,4.953125

2422617,4,B000BKDNX0,The story is familiar to me already. I was most interested in how differently masterpiece would treat this story from past productions. I was impressed with the costuming and details of the day to day living of the times. I thought Masterpiece did a good job showing how the young Elizabeth had to deal with her personal desires versus the responsibilities of being Queen in a country that was still in religious turmoil. I will watch more episodes.,1391904000,,449,4.769230769230769

2422676,4,B000BKDNX0,"Elizabeth I - The Virgin Queen is the first cinematic (or literary) account of Queen Bess's life that convinced me I should care about her.  I've never liked her.  Admired her accomplishments, her confidence, her intelligence, her savvy and street-smarts, maybe, but...like her?  No.  And yet, here, in an entirely un-retouched portrait of the woman, I finally found a human being I could understand and...maybe not quite like, but certainly care about and root for.  Plus, the film is just so darn well done.  I just couldn't bear to finish watching it, and I'll tell you why, but first...

This film has an authentic period sensibility that succeeds at rendering the characters humanly sympathetic to a modern audience, without resorting to anachronisms to do so.  Costumes, settings, language, situations, and the values of the characters are all in keeping with their time and place.  This Elizabeth biopic is more than satisfying from a historical angle.

From a purely story point of view, this telling of the Virgin Queen's life is as full of hooks as a blackberry bramble.  Almost from the first shot, you see characters' motives and goals on a collision-course with their circumstances and with other characters.  In short order the writing, directing, and performances create characters whose collisions are going to matter to you.  Maybe even a lot.

And that's the problem with Really Good Historical Cinema, and why I didn't finish watching Masterpiece's : Elizabeth I.  Having read a great deal of English history, I know exactly how each of these characters' stories turned out, and no matter how hard I hoped, the story wouldn't change, because it's history: -------'s life was still going to end messily, and -------'s romance was going to lead to his downfall, etc.  I just couldn't bear to watch, once this film had got its hooks in me and made me care about them as people.  Doesn't mean you shouldn't, though!",1389139200,,1930,4.98125
2422677,5,B000BKDNX0,I really enjoyed this video and would dearly love to see more movies in this genre offered with my prime account. I generally use my kindle to do a ton of reading but this video reminded me why I upgraded to the Kindle Fire HD as the picture and sound were wonderful. And I can watch anywhere in the house and not have to compete for the TV with my husband during basketball season.,1389139200,,382,4.175675675675675
2422678,2,B000BKDNX0,"(Queen) Elizabeth l is a truly wretched movie. This version of Queen Elizabeth had no intelligence, no beauty, no good wit, no skill with diplomacy nor administration. She was ugly, wretched, led around by her lusts and too afraid to give into them. What an appalling performance and a wretched script. I am sorry I watched it. The actress was immature and temperamental and it showed plainly throughout her performance.
2 stars.",1389139200,,429,4.972222222222222

2422680,5,B000BKDNX0,"Really enjoyed my first video streaming from Amazon.  Much better than watching football game.  Since I had just read the book Elizabeth I, by Alison Weir I was very interested in how they would handle certain of the episodes in this film.  It is a big story to tell and we all since school days have known a lot about Elizabeth the producers did a great job following the facts.  The costumes and back ground are beautiful a feast for the eyes.  I would highly recommend this production to my friends.",1389052800,,502,4.472527472527473

2422684,4,B000BKDNX0,"I am always amazed by how many times ""they"" keep making the same story.  Probably cause there are people like me who will watch this stuff endlessly!  Nevertheless, this is an excellent rendition of the story...with realistic, believable portrayals of the characters.  I prefer this version to the Hollywood one with Cate Blanchett.  Although she is a beautiful and talented actress, it was all just a little too ""clean"", and I didn't feel that the complicated relationship between her and Dudley (and later on with his son), was well explained in that version.  It is much clearer and easier to understand in this one, although I did feel the second half of the second episode was a bit rushed.  Overall, I highly recommend it if you are at all interested in this kind of historical drama.",1388966400,,790,4.772058823529412

2422688,5,B000BKDNX0,"I saw this when it first appeared, years ago on BBC, and it affected me so deeply that I remembered it vividly. But seeing it again was even better.

2422692,4,B000BKDNX0,A good movie. Some good base of some historical truth.  I found it to be good as far as a movie for many.  I would have loved more historic truth because it is an amazing story that does not need any theatrical editing. Though I believe that would make for a very long movie. I recommend this to any who are looking for a tale of romance and the demands for a Queen.,1388793600,,366,4.0

2422694,4,B000BKDNX0,It was so riveting I had trouble pausing to get things done I needed to do.  I also thought it brought some information that I had not previously known about Elizabeth.  I enjoyed the strength with which Ann-Marie Duff portrayed Elizabeth as well - and I totally understand why she never married.  How creative she must have been to hold her council off for all those years...,1388793600,,376,4.582089552238806
2422695,4,B000BKDNX0,"We seen so much about QEI but this series took a new look at Her emotions.

2422697,5,B000BKDNX0,"I very much enjoyed this film, and though it was definitely on a par with Elizabeth The Golden Age, but with a very different focus.
The narrative traces Elizabeth's imprisonment by her sister Mary, Mary's death and her enthronement, through her tempestuous relationship with Robert Dudley (played consummately by Tom Hardy, portrayed as a very self-centered and arrogant man) and the emergence of Mary Queen of Scots as a rival, though unlike The Golden Age, where Mary plays a large role, in this version she is never actually shown, only discussed. A lot of the events are portrayed in discussion or letters as is the death of Dudley and the defeat of the Spanish Armada, though a stirring recreation of Elizabeth's speech to the troops at Tilbury is a highlight of the film. The film does well in it's use of real quotes together with more modern usage of conversation. Great costumes and scenery

The death of Amy Robsart (Emila Fox) , Dudley's wife is portrayed as s suicide, though one that Dudley reacts callously to and the Elizabeth's rivalry with Lettice Knollys (Sienna Gillory) is part of the focus.
The last part deals with Elizabeth devotion to the young Robert Devereaux (Hans Mattheson) , Earlf of Essex, and frames Essex plot against Elizabeth as being intigated by his mother Lettice.
Anne Marie Duff portrays Elizabeth quite expertly. Effortlessly playing the role of a young Elizabeth through to her aging and death. Elizabeth is revealed as wise, strong, devoted to her country and people, at times capricious and ruthless when necessary. Her anguish at being forced to sign the death warrant of Mary Queen of Scots is revealed in a dream of herself being executed in Mary's place. Quite a lot of her life  is revealed in this film in dreams, such as her desire for Robin Dudleywhere she dreams of making love to him. Great speech near the end before her court summing up her feeling about her life and reign.",1388620800,2,1931,4.813253012048193

I adore Tom Hardy anyway, since seeing him on BBC playing Heathcliff, when he was younger...That rugged, crooked lil teeth..i got u babe grin..oh my......Anne-Marie Duff...well, in this she WAS ELIZABETH...u believed her..SHE AGED IN EVERY WAY REALISTICALLY...U felt the desire, conflict,secrets,pressure of her life. I was amazed i had missed this version !!!!!For a change, and u know what i mean, if u luv period pieces...u could actually follow everyones NAME..their title...what part they played in her life...without needing a degree in History.  You will adore this version...Anne-Marie was better than, and im sorry, but Cate Blanchett, Helen Mirren,That other famous British chic from the 70's, oh u know.~~~You'll spot a few very young actors in there,who are well known now...script was believable for the times, the sexual tension was string tight, the poverty level was chilling, the opulence sickening...every actor was awesome in this, or maybe its just my tastes..find out!..watch it...and i hope she ""KISSED HIM<KISSED HIM<KISSED HIM!!for ""GOLLY"" sake....yup.
P.S.~ then view the Historys channel special on the secrets of her life...speculation or fact,some of both?They pose questions such as: Was she a man?(her build)..a hermaphrodite(real reason she didn't marry)..did servants switch her when very young(to avoid Henrys wrath~there goes ur head)because of fatal illness?Experts weigh in. Fascinating stuff...akin to Pope Joan theories. ..

However, I can watch anything of the Tudors at anytime. I mean, after all, of British history, we all know who lived and for how long and how they died. The devil is in the details and I found the details of this presentation to be rewarding, educational and immensely enjoyable! I especially enjoyed watching it on Amazon Prime Video, because I could pause it and check out lifelines, facts and additional details on Wikipedia. There are many things to recommend this version, not the least of which is Anne-Marie Duff, who is astonishingly good and consistent in her portrayal, and is supported by a stellar cast, set-designs and great dialog. I might buy it, but given the technology available now I know I can watch it again online. As an aside, if they ever make a movie about Bette Davis, it will be a crime to have any actress BUT Anne-Marie Duff play her!",1388188800,2,1040,4.596774193548387

The aging of Elizabeth (and the rest of the characters, too) was phenominal.  The effects were realistic and complete, not just a few fake-looking wrinkles on the face and gray hair.  Details like wrinkly, sagging bodies were not ignored.  This might be a strange thing to point out, but it really does lend to the authenticity of the scenes and was noticably well done.",1387497600,,522,4.7555555555555555

2422732,5,B000BKDNX0,"It was a very interesting and exciting movie which I could not put down.  The strength and courage that ""Elizabeth"" portrayed was outstanding and her loyalty to England was unquestioned.  She gave up the love of her life to be the best queen possible.

Despite my strenuous attempts to achieve a 4 : 3 aspect ratio either on my SONY wide screen LCD display or newer SONY Blu Ray player, I could not find a way to do it.  As a result, the video images seem stretched horizontally, making actors' faces seem too wide, etc.  This is mildly disorienting and can be difficult to watch after awhile.",1385251200,,533,4.408163265306122

2422788,5,B000BKDNX0,"Good, mostly accurate portrayal (much telescoped, as necessary) of Elizabeth's life with some insight into her character.
The fact she was so accomplished a linguist was neatly emphasized.",1384473600,,188,5.75

2422790,4,B000BKDNX0,"Well done from another point of view.  The one thing about history is that there are so many interpretations.  This one is probably very close to the truth. Well acted, beautiful costumes, gorgeous cinematography.",1384387200,,213,5.235294117647059
2422791,5,B000BKDNX0,Absolutely incredible.  This version of historical society kept me wishing there was more.  Brava and Bravo to an outstanding cast.,1384387200,,131,5.5
2422792,4,B000BKDNX0,"I am an unapologetic Anglophile, and I really enjoyed this version of Elizabeth the First's life.  The lead actress is perfectly suited for the role - she resembles the Virgin Queen and her acting is top drawer.  I had never noticed Tom Hardy before even though I have the movie Inception on DVD, which he is in.  He was great as Robert Dudley: very convincing in his loyalty to the Queen as well as in his physical presence. The film seems pretty factual until after Dudley dies, when my interest petered out a bit, they decided to include his sons in imagined settings and interactions which I didn't find as interesting as the first 3/4 of the mini series.  After the sinking of the Spanish Armada, the following years of English peace and the Queen's old age aren't that riveting.",1384300800,,784,4.578571428571428

2422794,5,B000BKDNX0,"Part 2 was outstanding and showed the complexities of Elizabeth and her reign in an intriguing way. It was well acted and well produced. Part 1 was four stars; it showed Elizabeth as a bit insecure in her youth, facing grave danger fans the heir to Mary Tudor and as a Protestant princess. Elizabeth I is a fascinating historical figure.

Elizabeth R, the PBS series, is also an outstanding production. Great History & entertainment !",1383696000,,434,4.786666666666667
2422795,4,B000BKDNX0,"I think the show is pretty good. Well cast, and acted. If you like historical fiction, you will enjoy this depiction of the Elizabeth 1, the second Tudor Queen to rule in her own right. Her sister Mary ruled before and while she married her Spanish King, but died without issue. In a time when most felt women royals duty was to fill the royal nursery, Elizabeth proved that she could rule and run the country on her own.",1383609600,,421,4.341772151898734

2422797,5,B000BKDNX0,"Elizabeth the Golden Age pales in comparison to this film, making me wonder how well this version would have fared as a theatrical release in the States. The actors, music, costumes, everything, work together seamlessly to sweep me up into that world. I'm not an expert in the details about Elizabeth's reign or this era, but I do know Virgin Queen is much more accurate than Golden Age, a movie that seems to have borrowed some ideas from this one, details that weren't historical but were creative choices. I even wondered whether Kapur's second Elizabeth film was influenced by this film. The estimated budget for VQ was $6 mill, a far cry from the $55 mill expense of Golden Age, which focuses on an imagined romance between Elizabeth and Sir Walter Raleigh, and the threat of the Spanish Armada. In response to the few negative reviews of this film: We could nitpick every anachronistic mistake, but film is an art, and most of us willingly suspend our disbelief so we can enjoy being transported to another time. (When we want all the precise historical details, we'll pick up a book, so please keep your self-aggrandizing criticism of historical inaccuracies to yourself!)",1383436800,,1179,4.870646766169155

2422799,5,B000BKDNX0,Anne-Marie Duff was incredible in this! Her character was complicated in every aspect and she depicted this without flaw. She made me see the strength it took to be Queen in that era and do it practically on her own. It was a constant fight yet she gained the love of her people while having a weakness for the ones she loved in her life. Absolutely loved both parts to this mini series...the costumes were excellent also.,1383436800,,422,4.4935064935064934

JUST wonderful The aging was magnificent Hurrah to make up & hair!!! Also the small pox scene BRAVO!!!",1383091200,,331,4.824561403508772
2422819,5,B000BKDNX0,I LOVED The Tudors and was looking for a similar video. This certainly fit the bill. The story of Henry's daughter is a compelling one. I spent an enjoyable afternoon watching it.,1383091200,,179,4.625
2422820,4,B000BKDNX0,"Well played by the actors. Makes the subject more realistic and human. Watched Elizabeth grow from a princess to a queen with a focus on the human side of that transformation. Most projects on the subject show a polished woman from childhood to adulthood. I don't know to many people that can be that sure of them selves without having a crystal ball. This miniseries seemed to focus more on the part that was human, making the queen more relatable. The uncertainties and the personal struggles with inheriting so much power in a time when your sex was considered to week to handle it. Well played.",1383091200,,598,4.650943396226415

How she survives, puts together a team of advisors, and deals with both foreign and domestic threats is covered via a compelling script, with great actors in every role.  Her loyalty to a childhood friend, the Earl of Leicester, is well explained:  His father and older brother both supported Henry VIII and his Protestant son, losing their lives either in battle or after being imprisoned by Mary in the Tower.  Elizabeth pardons Leicester, giving him key responsibilities and gradually increasing his wealth and power over time.

2422888,3,B000BKDNX0,"There have been so many better efforts made to portray the life of QEI that I recommend this one without enthusiasm. The politics of England and Europe are mostly ignored. Instead, this series focuses on a few personal relationships that the queen had in her lifetime. The editing is choppy and I was dismayed to see one scene begin with the caption, ""37 years later"" -- wha? As if nothing happened during those 37 years. :) Oh well. It was not a bad performance in the title role and I did appreciate the honesty and balance of the part as written. Very human.

GOOD:
Great acting
Great costumes
Good casting
Wonderful sets
Amazing makeup aging the actors - way better than ""The Tudors"" ever managed

BAD:
BORING as all Hell
Part 1 says nothing about politics and just follows Elizabeth I's personal life
Part 2  nothing happens and then the Earl of Essex shows us what a bi-polar earl back then would do...it's still boring
It says nothing about her rule, and the only 2 scenes about politics come not from reality, but are ripped off from the big ""Elizabeth"" movie

In short, if you care about history, skip. If you kinda care about history and like drama, see the movie ""Elizabeth."" Just skip this one, it's 4 hours of your life you'll never get back.

Still, hats off to the actors and the crew who did the best they could with this tripe. The writers should be beaten with wood reeds until they promise to never write anything again. PBS should be shamed for buying this up and broadcasting it.",1379376000,11,1033,4.502673796791444

When her older half-sister, the English Queen, finally dies, Elizabeth's world turns upside-down when she suddenly finds herself the new ""Queen of England""!  Can she put aside her distrust of even her closest advisors to accept any offer of marriage, or will she forever remain ""the Virgin Queen of England""?  The second half of this movie is much easier to follow for those viewers who have no background in the many 'Wives of Henry VIII'. You see the dangerous world faced by Henry's two daughters after their father, King Henry VIII, and their younger brother, Edward, the Prince of Wales, are both dead. What King Henry married 8 times to avoid finally has come to pass, an England ruled by ""Queens"", not a King!

It tells the same story as its HBO and Hollywood counterparts but there is something amazingly seductive about Tom Hardy as Leicester and Joanne Whalley is adorable at first, morphing into the miserable Queen at the end.

I thoroughly enjoyed it. Quality is comparable to its counterparts as well as Downton Abbey and Pride and Prejudice.

Costuming is spot on. Acting wonderful. The only flaw I would state is the ending 1/4 of the movie seems a bit rushed or jumpy.
Don't let the title keep you from watching as it almost did me.  I thought a little more time spent on creative thinking and they might have come up with something more enticing.

2422939,4,B000BKDNX0,"I'm not an Elizabethan expert or anything, but I think this is decently accurate. It's also very well done in many aspects. The only thing I can complain about is that whoever did the make-up for the old Elizabeth made her very ugly - I don't know if the real one was, but the one in the movie is quite unpleasant to look at. Anyway, this is a great show and I highly recommend if you like drama or are particularly interested in the ""virgin queen.""",1377734400,,449,4.232558139534884

2422952,5,B000BKDNX0,"This telling of the life of Elizabeth I from young woman to the end of her reign and death is one of the most vibrant versions I have seen. This Elizabeth is intelligent, cunning, and charismatic, but also vain, love-struck, and petulant. Paula Milne wrote an exceptional screenplay for this production.

As a young woman who is basically held as a prisoner by her sister, Queen Mary, she is well aware of the court intrigues that she must navigate or risk death. She must pretend that she is loyal to her sister and that she embraces her views that Catholicism should be the one religion for England. But in her heart is still a protestant, but sees that religious freedom for her people is more important than punishment. She is also a young woman with desires and a lust for living.  Her love of Robert Dudley, a childhood friend, seems almost obsessive, but the scene of them riding together on the horse after she's ascended the throne is one of a carefree, laughing young Elizabeth -- you feel her joy and love.

As queen, you realize she is her father's daughter because this Elizabeth is a strong leader and brooks no challenge to her authority and lets them know she is a woman, but a determined and extremely capable ruler and politician. It is her weakness as a woman craving love from Robert Dudley and then Robert Devereaux that makes her more vulnerable. She cares for her people in war and shows her willingness to be amongst them, and that makes her popular with her people. She is first and foremost a queen.

At the end of her life you feel as if you have really seen a truly great queen, but you also are left wondering could her life have been different as you remember the young, laughing Elizabeth and see the ravaged body and mind of Elizabeth on her deathbed.

Anne-Marie Duff was the perfect actress for this version of Elizabeth I. Her Elizabeth is complex and you find yourself awed by her intelligence and strength, but frustrated by her emotional neediness. The entire cast brought a realism to their parts that made it easy to become involved. The production design was wonderful. And Coky Giedroyc direction was fantastic -- his choices were perfect.

I cannot say enough about how much I enjoyed the music. Martin Phipps has turned your expectations on your ear as he combines what feels like music from that time, but then turns our expectations around as he uses Latin lyrics in ""Miseria Nomine"" as Elizabeth eyes Robert Dudley, uses the poetry of Elizabeth I in ""The Virgin Queen"" to show her musings, or some songs in Bulgarian, ""Remember Me"" when Elizabeth is fading. The Mediaeval Baebes provide some truly wonderful vocals that underscore the beauty of the music and the feeling that this story of Elizabeth is more contemporary than not.

I have seen it several times and I highly recommend it.",1377561600,5,2834,4.667334669338677
2422953,5,B000BKDNX0,"Not much to add to what has already been written. Superb casting. Finally, a Dudley as beautiful as legend tells it, whatever the reality.

The intent is for loosely historical based entertainment with a love story, power struggles, awesome costumes and one of the sexiest men alive (I'm winking at you Mr. Hardy). Acting was actually decent. This is one of the first films I saw TH in years ago and knew he was going to rise above.

The soundtrack could be annoying most of the time but tolerable. Beautiful costume, lighting, editing...at least from the perspective of someone not in the industry.

2422990,5,B000BKDNX0,"How many Elizabeths have we been offered so far? Very few are memorable and Masterpiece Theater has proved the best by far.  Glenda Jackson was La Stupenda as Elizabeth in a series allowed to run long enough to approximate the true story and towers over all others. And now we have another Masterpiece production giving us a more intimate version of the life and reign of a woman who still fascinates us, particularly her relationship with Robert Dudley, her childhood playmate and friend who also shared the experience of terror and threat of imminent execution, and who was said to be the handsomest man in all England.  All this is believably played out by Anne-Marie Duff and Tom Hardy to this viewer's delight.

With the exception of the wonderful Helen Mirren who deservedly won best actress for her Elizabeth I in the very fine HBO production, all other Elizabeths pale and fade away.  Cate Blanchet is a beautiful and brilliant actress but she could not save, for me at least, the over-acclaimed versions of Elizabeth and Elizabeth-The Golden Age despite gorgeous cinematography and production values. The story line was ridiculous and historically unworthy--Anjou a drag queen? Lettice Knolles was not murdered by a poisoned gown, she actually married Robert Dudley and, I believe, outlived him!  And Walsingham, who did pursue and achieve the conviction of Mary Stuart,  a hands-on regicide?

So at last we have a version of this intriguing woman in an exciting story worthy of falling in love with, both the factual characters and the oh, so attractive actors. I love showing this movie to my friends and family and have watched it many times just for myself.",1373760000,,1670,4.942857142857143
2422991,5,B000BKDNX0,"Although I liked the version with cate blanchet, this version was far superior and, I feel, more historically accurate.  The acting was believable and I was totally immersed in the queen's quandary of not being able to truly have the one man she loved. If one does not cry when the queen collapses over the loss of her love, a heart of steel must beat within.  I wholly felt the emotions and  struggled along with the queen during her tough decision making.
  I love watching these productions with little known actors who transcend the traditional Hollywood glitz.  Substance, not fluff.",1372204800,,588,4.83
2422992,2,B000BKDNX0,"Much has been said already by other reviewers about the score.  Agree with those who think the music is distracting and inappropriate to the story, with one exception.  Listen closely - the lyrics are actually the text of Elizabeth's parting letter to her ""Frog,"" the French duke she did not marry due to anti-French sentiment among her people. It is and was a magnificent letter, providing insight to the monarch herself, whose personality I think at times bordered on schizoid.

Much better had Duff herself spoken the lines.  Duff is the second good thing about the film, in that she actually physically resembles the famous portraits of Elizabeth I.  Further, she can convincingly switch from sweetness to rage in a royal heartbeat, as the monarch Duff portrays was purported to do.  Indeed, Duff's assured performance rescues an otherwise abyssmally-miscast film.",1370649600,6,868,5.164285714285715

2423009,3,B000BKDNX0,"I want to preface by disclosing that I've only seen the 1st part of this, and I know there are 3 more segments.  I'm just not sure I want to watch 4 1/2 more hours of Elizabeth I behaving like some sort of deranged woman/child.  Maybe that is what they were going for, but it really doesn't endear me to Elizabeth.  I get that she was under a lot of pressure, and people were more reserved in the 1600s, but do they honestly have to rage about like daytime soap characters ... dragging all their personal issues into the hallways of the palace instead of talking about them calmly like adults?  Is that really how royalty and courtiers behaved in the Tudor era?  Ms. Duff's unblinking stares and bizarre angry smiling were sort of off-putting as well.  They made Elizabeth seem a tad psychotic.

He is sort of despicable for the way he neglected his wife, but I found the Robert Dudley character more sympathetic than Elizabeth.  He is supposedly her closest bosom pal and she strings him along, refuses him right and left, sends him off to marry her possibly murderous cousin, and then gets angry and jealous when he finds love and companionship with one of her ladies in waiting.  Maybe that was against some rule?  I don't know.  It just all seemed childishly malicious to me.

I think that Elizabeth could have been presented more sympathetically by downplaying her capricious mood swings a bit, and perhaps lowering her voice when she has 'discussions' in the hallways.

I didn't mind the historical inaccuracies ... this isn't a documentary.  Although, I don't really see why they needed to have Amy Dudley commit suicide, when in reality she supposedly died due to an accidental fall - how does this change advance the narrative?  It just makes Robert Dudley seem callous.",1349222400,,1779,4.693548387096774

Music: I loved the female choir. It really captured the general emotion and lured you into the moment. Sometimes the music was a bit modern which, for some, can be problematic. But, I loved the soundtrack and downloaded it on Itunes. So good!

Casting: Anne-Marie Duff and Tom Hardy have great chemistry. Tom is obviously extremely attractive, and was clearly cast in the role base on that. But he does a great job at capturing Dudley and the many sides to his personality: politically driven, romantic, sensual, luring, calculated...etc. I would like to see more of him in period pieces. Anne-Marie is not what I would say to be absolutely perfect for this role, but she does do a great job. I simply don't think she was able to capture the authoritative side of Elizabeth. She tries, but it comes across a bit more like a whiny, petulant child, than a powerful woman. She does, however, capture the emotional, feminine side extremely well. The way she looks is perfect for the role. I loved Queen Mary and wished she had more of a role in the film.

2423014,5,B000BKDNX0,"Now, I don't know the real Elizabeth I and nor do critics who don't like this production.  But to me, I thought Anne-Marie Duff's performance was quite amazing.  The question is, was this the correct portrayal?  In this production, Elizabeth seemed more of real person than some haughty character you see in films.  It showed her flaws, rawness and scenes where it was not overdone with a grandiose sense she was this all mighty powerful goddess where she would strike you down.  She was a queen, a real person.  The scene where E I came out to her subjects on her horse was quite amazing, moving but again not ""Hollywoodized"" like in films.  I've always thought that portraying a real person seemed entertaining in that Hollywood way but you think was that really the real person?  I often think if you met the person they probably aren't that exciting in real life.  I much prefer the real nature the real character of the real person and the actual sense of what happened then - this is not Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter this is real life person in real situations that happened.  This portrayal seemed just that.  Plus, here is another thing to consider why this seemed more accurate.  With all the tribulations she had gone through in her early years of her life I would think this caused her to be ""wild"" and not so calm and cool.  Also she was Henry the VIII's daughter.  Henry VIII had quite the temperament and wildness about him so it would make sense E I would also have at least some of that.  Lastly, this is the 1500's.  I think people in Britain in those days were on edge under the circumstances.  It's not a time to be looking good and casual.  As to her looks, Anne Marie's I think is closer to the real person at least closer than Cate Blanchett and Helen Mirren.  Elizabeth I was not a Hollywood actress, folks!!  I thoroughly loved it and frankly was quite surprised by the soundtrack and camera techniques.  The use of the handheld felt you're there.",1308268800,,1976,4.49438202247191

Worse still, it plays fast and loose with a lot of historical points and people.  Ann-Marie Duff is not convincing as Elizabeth I.  She lacks the strength that Glenda Jackson and Cate Blanchett brought to the part.  Tom Hardy as Robert Dudley looks like a sultry modern bad boy, totally out of period.  The music is atrocious, blaring and modern, and it destroys what little sense of atmosphere and period the art design manages to create.  I am amazed that so many reviewers thought highly of this farrago.  Glenda Jackson's series, ""Elizabeth R,"" may have been done, comparatively, on a shoestring, but it makes Elizabeth and her milieu come to life and is miles ahead of this turkey.  If you must see an updated version of ER's life, get the one with Blanchett.

2423021,5,B000BKDNX0,"In the past 5 years or so I've watched close to 8 to 10 films about Elizabeth I. I've always been fascinated by the Tudors & their tumultuous times. Like other history fans, I have my favorite characters--and villains. Fortunately, Elizabeth is on the favorites list (AND Mary, Queen of Scots--figure that one out.). After watching a number of extremely brilliant women actors in the role, I thought it was getting a bit ridiculous to see an English Queen running around telling just about everybody, ""I'm a Virgin, I'm a Virgin, I'm a Virgin!"" Good grief--shades of The Material Girl! Well, of course there was a good reason for that. I think most historians agree that Elizabeth skillfully allied her political reputation to the high level of adoration the people of the period (even Protestants) felt for the Blessed Virgin Mary. Then there's the practical reality that being virgo intacta was vital to be a player in the European monarchial marriage game. This too Elizabeth played to her advantage. By keeping kings & countries waiting & guessing on her next move, Elizabeth felt relatively safe and--perhaps more importantly, on the strictly personal level--garnered her the verbal romantic attention she seemed to obsessively crave.

Coky Giedroyc, director of this production stated, ""Elizabeth had...a real pathological fear of intimacy. Her father (Henry VIII) represented everything male, and once you get close to a man you get killed..."" She also had her mother's fate to reflect on. Even a naughty queen can lose her head--especially if her hubby was good ol' Henry (a Tudor definitely NOT on my favorites list--but his cast-off wife Katherine of Aragon is.) Elizabeth was considered an ""enlightened"" queen, even an intellectual (in an age when it was considered very suspicious for a woman to have ideas of her own.) Nonetheless, she was a child of her violent time, and was not adverse to employing torture & deception in her struggle to keep her throne. Still, she was better than most of her contemporaries and she clearly possessed a highly tuned conscience.

I'd never seen Anne-Marie Duff before. Hers is not the tall, killer blonde type; but rather she is short, elfin, with flowing, strawberry blonde hair (at least in this film.) And she possess an inner charm, a real charisma and intellectual radiance. She is perfect for the role of Elizabeth. She appears to effortless generate regal majesty, and that is as much matter of personal character as it is of acting skill.

There are three scenes from the film that stand in my mind.

The first was the opening (a good omen of enjoyment to come.) A teenage Elizabeth has been banished to The Tower by her bitter, paranoid half-sister, Mary. She is talking with ladies-in-waiting, when they hear soldiers approaching. They scramble to set a scene of humble piety by hiding things & ""straightening up."" One of the ladies tosses a rosary like a football to Elizabeth, who catches it in mid-air.

The second scene is not far from the first. Mary has died & Elizabeth becomes the new Queen. She is in a triumphal procession weaving through the streets London. Here Anne-Marie Duff is at her most radiant, showering the people with her gratitude & basking in the love they had for her. It's ironic that the common folk loved Elizabeth almost in proportion to how much they hated her mother (Anne Boleyn.) In a similar sort of twist, the people disliked Queen Mary (Tudor) as much as they loved her mother, the divorced Queen Katherine

The third scene is near the end of the picture. Elizabeth is old & near the end of her days. She is standing at the end of a large outdoor court while her new, very young ladies-in-waiting stand at the opposite end surreptitiously watching her. Elizabeth is so caught up thinking about the past that she seems unaware of their critical stare. In her mind she hears a song  from her bygone youth, and begins to rather awkwardly--and feebly--dance to the tune. To the maids she's an object of ridicule & they parody her movements in a dance they find hopeless old fashioned. It is a poignant scene reflecting the relentless nature of time & the cruel honesty of youth--and it reminds us that, in the end, Elizabeth was a vulnerable human being too.

Another aspect I appreciate about this ""Elizabeth,"" is that it was mercifully brief & fairly neutral in the depiction of the rivalry between Elizabeth Tudor & her cousin, Mary Queen of Scots. British films have almost invariably portrayed Mary Stuart as either an idiot, or a sex-driven demon out to bring the Inquisition into England. Neither is true, but there's little doubt that had Mary ascended to the English crown, it would have been a full-blown disaster for all concerned.

The supporting cast & essential production values are of the highest quality. A special nod to the music (see CD review below) and costumes (people, including men, really knew how to dress in those days!)

First off, I found the use of language to be intelligent, not like the Hollywood Elizabeth that seems to lack true English wit.  I am caught up every time I watch this with the casting, scenery, and costumes, which in turn merely embellishs the script.  Some reviewers mentioned that this production left out Queen Elizabeth's other accomplishments by focusing on her relationships.  Quite the contrary, I found it just as intriguing due the fact that it showed the human side upon which every leader or monarch has had to endure.  This film showed the ""frail feminine side and the body politic"" Queen Elizabeth struggled so hard to balance, a difficult feat for anyone.  It is mentioned in the history books that as she got older she suffered terrible headaches likely due to immense stress. I see there is nothing wrong with highlighting this part of her life, if so however accurate or inaccurate it is nothing but captivating performances, strong content, and true human emotion.

Tom Hardy's performance in this film has made me a fan of his and will continue to look for other works of his.  His character as the Earl of Leicester seamlessly transitions from a young suitor to an older, wiser man faithfully standing by the queen's side until the day of his death.  Duff's performance of the Queen encapsulated her joy's, frustrations, struggles, love and loss spot on.  The end of the film was the pinnacle, as was Elizabeth's life, I actually held my own breath as if it were my own life reflecting upon.

You will not be disappointed.  It is not often for me to be so taken in with a movie that I forget I am watching a film on a 15"" laptop.",1204243200,10,1830,4.509090909090909

I found the modernized soundtrack and fast-cut video editing to be distracting and offputting. Many of the characters frankly looked too ""modern"" to be believable, particularly Tom Hardy who would have been more suited to a street gang film.

I am an older viewer, so this may very well have affected my response to the film, which seemed geared to a more youthful audience.

Production values, of course, were high and lent the film a sumptious air but it ended up being little more than eye candy.

The middle, however, was dragged down by dwelling too much on her relationships with Leicester and her various suitors, making her seem very bland and uninteresting.

My favorite part of the production was the last hour or so, portraying her as an aging woman trying to keep up the fantasy of the invincible queen.  Particularly moving is a scene when one of her young favorites bursts in on her unexpectedly in her private rooms, where she is completely devoid of her usual finery and poise and appears very vulnerable and frail.

2423034,5,B000BKDNX0,"This is exciting and spellbinding pageantry at its best.  The 230 minutes long series was produced together by PPS and BBC and it explores the very long 44 year reign of queen Elizabeth I.

 Once she is queen, young Elizabeth Tudor, as champion of the protestant faith, succeeds in breaking with the catholic church/Rome which still had her strong claws in England at that time. She is very successful in outwitting  and dealing with many intrigues and political enemies at court. Her utmost aim is to be a good stewart to her people and rule over a peaceful and prospering country. This thought motivates her peaceful foreign policy, in contrast to the expansionist attempts of other nations at the time. She steadfastly refuses all offers of marriage and instead is 'married to England' . Ultimately, she affords England the Golden Age.

 Main focus during her long reign centers on the periods with her two favorites, Sir Roberf Dudley, Earl of Leicester, in her youth, and with Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, when she is way past her prime. Essex is the stepson of Sir 'Robbie' Dudley, and  strangely enough resembles him in this movie too To what extend the portrayal of the Earl of Essex ist historically correct, I do not know. I  have seen him protrayed as ambitious, proud and strongminded, but never as despicable as this one.

 Custumes are great, make-up and wigs also,  settings are wonderful and believable and there are small realistic tidbits, such as when the queen has a molar extracted, or her teeth get yellow and worn with age, or when, after her death, they find the alteration, she had made to her ring, to include a picture of her mother Anne Boleyn, which I found touching, as she had been referred to as ""the bastard queen"" more than once. Not believable is, that she remained a virgin, considering the many romps she managed to have with Dudley.........she was a great old gal as well as a young one.......",1175299200,11,1938,4.738095238095238

I thought Ann Marie Duff and Tom Hardy were excellent, as was the supporting cast.  The production moved quickly, the costumes

were wonderful and the locations gave a genuine ""feel"" to the time and subject matter being presented. If I have any real criticism, it is that -as with most historical movies -  a bit of license was taken with

accuracy, which I presume is done to ""move"" the action along and

intensify the characterizations.  While this really annoys me, it seems to be the norm with this genre.  Once I got past the inaccurracies. I

The rest of the cast is equally as good, though Joanne Whalley is too pretty to play Queen Mary.

Though this program has a modern twist (music, language, etc), I thought it pretty true to all the biographies I have read about The Virgin Queen. Be warned though, it does draw some conclusions on events that may or may not have been - Amy Dudley's death, for instance. There's no proof it was suicide.

2423039,5,B000BKDNX0,"I've read many books about the life and times of Queen Elizabeth I and I felt that this film rang true to me in many ways!  The Tudors were a strong and intelligent family. Being a daughter of Henry VIII would have been a tough position for anyone to be in. Elizabeth had to be a perceptive and intelligent survivor to have had such a successful reign as Queen of England.

This film begins with a young Princess Elizabeth locked in the Tower of London by her half sister Queen Mary. I liked the beginning very much because it shows the possibility of what the relationship between the two sisters might have been like. Elizabeth afraid and not knowing what would happen to her or if she would even live.  Her sister Queen Mary, unloved and a pawn for both England and Spain.

Then suddenly Queen Mary dies and Elizabeth is now Queen Elizabeth.  A position she was educated for but never thought to attain.  This time she rules and learns how to run her court.  At first, she is unsure of herself and leaning heavily on her advisors, but eventually honing her own skills and trying to chose her advisors with care. She faces a nation divided by religion and a court full of intrigue. She was also skirting the issue of marriage which she was very much afraid of.  She became know as the ""virgin queen.""  How difficult was that in a male dominated world?  She was surrounded by several men who attempted to seduce her and was possibly in love with Robert Dudley who already had a wife.

Then the other Queen Mary comes into play.the charming Queen of Scotland, Mary Stuart who also had a claim to the English throne. A cousin queen for Elizabeth to fear, but possibly the only other person alive who could understand her situation.  Unfortunately the two queens never met which is sad, because they were related and shared a huge place in history. I've often wondered if Queen Elizabeth regretted putting her cousin to death.

Anne-Marie Duff did an extraordinary job in her starring performance as Queen Elizabeth. She took the character from a young and fearful princess to a strong and powerful Queen of England.

to some pretty critical aspects of Elizabeth I's reign.  Aside from that it is pretty well done.  And to those who gripe about Ann-Marie Duff's ""middle class"" accent, I say, get over yourselves.

If you are really concerned about authenticity, you should know that, 1) the accent of the Elizabethan Britons resembled the accent of the American south much more than the upper class or even lower class or middle class British accents of today and 2) at that time there was no universal ""upper class"" accent, all accents were regional with little or no class distinction inherent in them. It took the establishment of the British ""public schools"" for the current ""posh"" accent to come into use. If you don't believe me, go look it up.",1170720000,4,806,4.695035460992908
2423041,4,B000BKDNX0,"This 2005 BBC miniseries ""The Virgin Queen"" follows the life of Queen Elizabeth I (Anne-Marie Duff) from her confinement by half-sister Queen Mary on suspicion of treason, through Elizabeth's ascendancy to the throne of England at age 25, to the end of her 44-year reign as England's never-married ""virgin queen"". The aesthetic is generally dark, as most of the film takes places in dimly lit, unwelcoming interiors that contrast with the Queen's dazzling wardrobe. ""The Virgin Queen"" is more historically accurate than the 1998 feature film ""Elizabeth"" that starred Cate Blanchett, but this production places more emphasis on Queen Elizabeth's personal life than on her political accomplishments. Particular attention is paid to her resistance to marriage in the face of many suitors, her affectionate relationship with Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester (Tom Hardy), and with her ill-fated protg Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex (Hans Matheson) late in life.

American and British audiences will undoubtedly view ""The Virgin Queen"" differently and quarrel with different points. I presume that Brits will be more rigorous with historical accuracy, the interpretation of the Queen Elizabeth's personality, and inconsistencies in the accents. Americans are more likely to simply have trouble following the events, because the film skips large periods of time. If viewers are not familiar with the history, they will have no idea how much time has actually passed. Mary Queen of Scots was confined for 18 years, but, if you didn't know that, you might get the impression that it was only a few months. The make-up department runs away with the show as it progresses. They did a spectacular job of aging the actors. I've never seen such realistic and thorough aging make-up before.

I thought it was wise of the film makers to skip over the part where she was supposedly torn over whether to execute Mary Queen of Scots. That just wastes film.

Anne-Marie Duff gives a energetic and far ranging performance as Elizabeth supported by a properly charismatic Tom Hardy as Robert Dudley. As for the puerile complaints of a few of the reviewers who are obsessed with trifles pay them no mind, for this is a rich and entertaining story with sharp dialogue.

2423046,2,B000BKDNX0,"Filming the story of Gloriana is a virtual guarantee of success for a production studio, from Warner Brothers to BBC. The Virgin Queen still retains her power to enthrall, intrigue and mystify these 500 years after she came to the throne. She was perhaps England's last true absolute monarch, and certainly one of its greatest, if not most famous.

Since the advent of film, she has been one of the most coveted roles to play. Indeed, few monarchs have been so closely chronicled, save perhaps her own father, Henry VIII, and Victoria.

She has been portrayed by some of the most brilliant actresses: Sarah Bernhardt, Bette Davis, Judi Dench, Judith Anderson, Miranda Richardson, Flora Robson, Cate Blanchett, Helen Mirren, even Quentin Crisp, and most famously, and importantly, Glenda Jackson.

And it must be said without doubt that Glenda Jackson's ""Elizabeth R"" is the defining portrait-- the most accomplished, historically accurate, and masterfully acted. Glenda Jackson is Elizabeth I reincarnate; there is simply none better, and likely never will be.

So now we have Anne-Marie Duff in the red wig for 230 Masterpiece Theatre minutes. Perhaps for the sake of revisionists, we are offered a far less imperious monarch, one who is both reactive (the real one was) and passive (the real one was not). Duff is an odd choice. No beauty like Cate Blanchett, but Elizabeth was known for vanity, not beauty. Duff's Elizabeth, with quivering lip and watercolor behavior, seems filmed underwater, and make for an undesirable monarch-- certainly not the Gloriana of myth or fact. Where is her famous wit, her coy manipulations, her strong moral fiber, her intense devotion to state and loyal courtiers? Left with Glenda Jackson, I suppose. This Elizabeth is a simpering, love-struck maiden or a crass, 60-something hag (and only then do we see bits of fire in the performance). Hag works; crass manages; simpering loses the whole impact.

A suavely elegant, very attractive and distinctly healthy Queen Mary I opens Elizabeth's story (no Catharine Parr, no Thomas Seymour, no childhood) but is quickly dispatched. Just as well, for she's thoroughly ill-cast--Mary was none of those things. (Far better was the wonderful Kathy Burke in the Blanchett version, though she was a bit of a Protestant caricature). Daphne Slater in the Jackson series was far more appealing, and perfectly written.

Elizabeth's transition from prisoner to crown is possibly the greatest story of her long life. No part of her history defines and creates her personality more than these years-- the abuse by Seymour, imprisonment, exile, and finally her accession. Unfortunately, much of this key period is sped through. The fatal flaw in the series is the decision to cast Elizabeth mooning incessantly over Robert Dudley, later Earl of Leicester, here played by a childish, petulant Tom Hardy. There is no chemistry here; he is pretty, but vacant. Glenda Jackson's Dudley, Robert Hardy (no relation that I know of), is a bit of a fop, but he knows his place in court and Elizabeth's heart. Their chemistry is clear. This version of Dudley is a bit ridiculous-- how he would claim the Queen's heart for more than 30 years is a mystery in this performance. So is most of the casting (what's with the acrobat?)

An egregious error in this production is the portrayal of suicide by Dudley's long-suffering wife Amy Robsart, whose death at 26 in 1560 remains to this day a mystery. More time should have been spent on the wooing of Elizabeth by the French Duc d'Alencon, who very nearly came to be her husband (again, the 1971 Glenda Jackson version handles this segment masterfully).

All too soon and without sufficient explanation, we become immersed in the historically key, decades-long battle of wills and imprisonment of the impetuous Mary, Queen of Scots-- Elizabeth's 2nd cousin, granddaughter of Henry VIII's older sister Margaret, whose claim to the English throne made her a rallying point of Catholics, and a very real threat to Elizabeth (it was Mary's son James who succeeded Elizabeth in 1603, founding the ill-fated House of Stuart).

Far more attention should have been paid to the case for and subsequent execution of Mary, Queen of Scots, which was Elizabeth's darkest hour-- forever bloodying her saintly propaganda. Likewise, more attention should have been given to Walshingham, Elizabeth's master of subversion, although William Cecil, Lord Burghley, is given fair due.

The decisive Armada happens much too quickly, lessening its impact and giving far too much time to be spent on the stormy relationship of Elizabeth and Robert Devereaux, Earl of Essex, portrayed by Hans Matheson, who is cast and directed as a bad-tempered, bipolar ""Mama's Boy"" (a very strange Oedipal twist here) whose hair, look and even attire speak far more to 2005 than 1585. The entire second half of the production is brought down by this admittedly strange relationship, here given a basketful of psychological issues left to the viewer to consider unraveling. The casting is awful, the acting mediocre, the personality baffling. This Essex is a wreck-- blame the revisionist director.

Two significant annoyances: Elizabeth's (Duff's) accent isn't simply London middle-class, which would be fine, but stands in stark contrast to everyone else's appropriate English diction and clarity. She comes off as a guttersnipe. And worse of all-- distracting to the utmost-- is the incessant soundtrack that dominates--and not pleasantly-- the action and plot of the movie. The sheer volume of it is horrendous, to say nothing of the attempts at mixing courtly historical period music with Essex's electric guitar.

My suggestion here is to rent this one, watch it as long as you can, and then return to Davis, Blanchett, Jackson, or even Dench. Overall, a disappointment. Were it not for 95% historical accuracy and enjoyable period costumes-- plus the decent acting (most of the problems are the director's fault, don't blame the actors), it would have earned one star. But this Queen is no legend, and this cast is horrendous. An inglorious Gloriana.",1151107200,141,6118,5.137688442211055
2423047,4,B000BKDNX0,"This production has a lot going for it.  Anne-Marie Duff makes a great Elizabeth, and she is supported by an equally talented cast.  The sets, lighting, costuming and direction are good, and the makeup artists did a terrific job of aging Duff as the movie progressed.  I occasionally found the music too much; it sometimes seemed loud and overwhelmed the action, but overall I enjoyed it.

The catch is that the concept of the movie works better in theory than it does in practice.  The Virgin Queen, as the title indicates, focuses on Elizabeth's personal relationships, most specifically her love interests.  To an extent, limiting the program makes sense; Elizabeth was about 69 at her death, and ascended to the throne at 25.  However, over all, Elizabeth's relationships were unusually embarrassing and sad, and to focus on them to the near-exclusion of the other events in her life leaves us with little more than a gossipy, costumed soap opera.  While the events depicted are factual--except where artistic license is used to explain murky aspects--Elizabeth often comes of as a bit trite, and the real queen, for all of her capriciousness, was anything but trite. She saw her kingdom through massive changes, left it stronger than she found it, and was so influential that her reign is still considered a golden age.

There are some genuinely touching moments, and the production is of good quality.  This is a worthwhile purchase, so long as you understand that the focus is very limited.",1149811200,168,1497,4.952

But this is not a film for viewers who don't want to hear a Queen Mary with a strong New York accent, see a bunch of people playing Elizabethan roles with decidedly modern movements and speech patterns, and hear rock-y modern music in the background.",1149379200,15,288,4.254545454545455
2423049,5,B000BKDNX0,"I am endlessly fascinated by anything Tudor, and as far as movies on this subject go, this is the best thing available.  It has everything we expect of a Masterpiece Theater production, as far as costumes, sets, and historical accuracy.  This however also has a fantastic dramatic quality. The way things are shot and the way the music is used throughout is stellar, and the entire thing has a very modern feel to it. These are historical figures that we are all familiar with, but they are made very human and relatable here.

Ann Marie Duff is excellent in the role.  I have seen her in several other films and this is her best work. I especially enjoy her in the second half as the aging queen.  It is heartbreaking to see the young members of the court mocking her and being disrespectful to the woman who has given her entire life to thier country. An example of this is when her young ladies in waiting break into her jewel box where she keeps the only things private to her; a portrait of Kat Ashley, and Dudley's last letter.  They also make fun of her dancing: the same dance we see earlier in the film as the popular new dance at court. Ann Marie Duff portrays this complex time of the queens life wonderfully; she is moving.  Another beautiful part is when Elizabeth learns that her sister is dead and she will be queen.  The look on her face as she runs across the field is of pure relief.  She is not as happy about actually becoming queen as she is that her life is less threatened now, and she will be a prisoner no more. The irony is that she is the most powerful woman in the country yet her life is the most strictly governed of all.  Her life is not her own.

I love the music which I think helped to keep the whole thing fresh. I was also happy to see that a makeup artist was finally able to age an actor successfully without making her look like plastic.  If you have enjoyed the Phillippa Gregory books on the Tudors, or the Cate Blanchett movie about Elizabeth, this film will be quite pleasing. It brings the former to life, and expands on the latter.  If you like The Virgin Queen, you might also like The Last King which chronicles the reign of Charles II and also stars Ann Marie Duff.",1146009600,9,2213,4.316425120772947
2423050,3,B000BKDNX0,"The costumes were sumptuous, there was more thoughtfulness to keeping historial accuracy, but I have to say that the acting was average. Although I thought Anne Marie Duff looked more like the real Elizabeth I than other portrayals of the queen, her middle class English accent was annoying and unlike what I imagine Elizabeth I really sounded like with her upper class London accent. I actually enjoyed Tom Hardy's portrayal of the seductive ""Sweet Robin"" more than Anne Marie Duff's portrayal. Her acting was too forced, did not have enough power, and again, the accent was bothersome. My favorite part was the very end, when they discover a hidden compartment in her ring (the real ring resides in a private collection today).

My question is this? When is the woman who was born to play Queen Elizabeth I ever going to do so? If you don't know who I mean, it should be Tilda Swinton. I would give anything to see Tilda Swinton play this part. She is a supreme actor as well as a British aristocrat. She also has the most uncanny resemblence to Elizabeth with her long face and nose, and red hair. For those of who that recently saw Narnia, you will know what I mean.

Until Tilda Swinton plays Elizabeth, Glenda Jackson will always claim the definitive portrayal of Elizabeth I. That record has stood more than 30 years among true Tudor enthusiasts.",1145923200,8,1353,4.70464135021097
2423051,5,B000BKDNX0,"As a fan of Queen Elizabeth I, I make it a point to get my hands on every movie, miniseries, program, book, etc that will give me a better insight into this amazing woman.  I can honestly say that Masterpiece Theatre's production of The Virgin Queen is by far the very best I have ever seen.  Elizabeth defined an era and is(in the opinion of this reviewer) one of the stronger female role models in history.  Anne Marie Duff's portrayal was exquisite yet very real because she showed us a passionate, forceful, flawed and misunderstood Queen.  Bravo!",1143590400,5,551,4.649484536082475

2423053,4,B000BKDNX0,"I watched this for the 1st time right after watching the wonderful Glenda Jackson's ""Elizabeth R"". The stories are the same as one would expect from well documented historical dramas.

But these two productions are much different in their flavors. This is a much more human drama. The characters seem more real and are frankly more appealing than in the older drama. The characters in ""Elizabeth R"" speak as if their words were all scripted by a playwrite, which of course they were. Those in ""Elizabeth I - The Virgin Queen"" speak and act as real people do... even princes.

My main complaint of this production was the music, which I found shrill and annoying, adding little to the drama. As is so commen these days the music is much too loud relative to the dialogue. One got tired of adjusting the volume.",1143590400,3,809,4.65034965034965
2423054,5,B000BKDNX0,"BBC drama almost always features some of the best acting, writing, design, and cinematography you're likely to find anywhere.  Now Coky Giedroyc's ""Elizabeth I: The Virgin Queen"" is certainly the best of all the Queen Elizabeth biopics.

Of course, each Elizabeth film's success has always rested on the head of it's leading lady, and the extraordinary Anne-Marie Duff, who has previously played supporting roles in THE MAGDALENE SISTERS and THE WAY WE LIVE NOW, makes the role her own within minutes.  (Great) prosthetics aside, her transformation from youthful radiance to hard-edged seniority is remarkable.

It's true that Duff has an edge over her predecessors; unlike Judi Dench in SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE or Cate Blanchett in ELIZABETH, Duff is given more of the Queen's life to portray, and unlike Glenda Jackson in ELIZABETH R, she isn't saddled with a dry script and a bare-bones production design.  All of those actors gave deservedly lauded performances, and Duff matches them scene-for-scene.  This film is also far more historically accurate than Blanchett's film.

The supporting cast seamlessly blends into the story, including dreamy Tom Hardy and Hans Matheson as the Dudley and Devereux lads, and long-missed (at least in America) Joanne Whalley as Queen Mary.  The swirling score by Martin Phipps is icing on a towering cake.",1142726400,4,1341,5.262910798122066

2423056,5,B000BKDNX0,"I truly enjoyed this movie.  Beautiful production.  Based on what I have read, the movie is rather historically accurate and very entertaining to watch.  The liberties taken with Elizabeth's character only serve to make her more interesting as a female monarch.  The only thing I found bothersome was some of the music(the choir of girls singing throughout both part 1 and 2).",1141084800,,376,5.016129032258065
2423057,5,B000BKDNX0,"This was one of the best descriptions of Elizabeth I mixing the fictional with the fact and adding it to one continuous story line. The costumes were period down to the color. The setting was strong and language now ever neither wavering from the time nor hard to fallow. The music was innovative and interesting; nevertheless I think for making this film a classic for the future standing I am afraid the music will date it because of the electric guitar. Although interweave of the Renaissance children rhymes of Elizabeth I and the stories was interesting. However what I have wrote will not stop me for getting the CD when it comes out and add to my collection. The music was similar to the artist ""Dead can Dance"" and ""Hedningarna"" mixing to time periods together to a harmonious point.",1138579200,2,791,4.697841726618705

Now when I am reading books on Elizabeth and her court, I still picture the individuals as they were portrayed in this series.  The actors really inhabited their characters and did a fabulous job making them appear great and at the same time as fragile humans.  It's all very wonderful in the first part and all downfall and sadness in the final part.  As someone who has never really warmed to Elizabeth I, this series thawed my cold heart and made me appreciate her in ways that I had not previously.

Would that the real Robert Dudley had the smoldering charisma of Tom Hardy, the history of England might have been somewhat different. The Elizabethan Era brought to life. I love this 2 part series.
