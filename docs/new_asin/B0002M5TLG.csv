It had a smooth, tender theme that sounded a little bit like the music from Around the World in 80 Days(1956). The animation looked a bit like Rocky and Bullwinkle. However, the quality of the animation got better when it merged with Hanna-Barbera.
The English dubbed version of The Cantinflas Show was known as ""Amigo and Friends Starring Cantinflas"". In the Spanish language version, it sounds like Cantinflas is dubbing over his cartoon counterpart. The Cantinflas Show does try to be more than mindless fluff. It has an educational feel. Cantinflas travels throught time and space to teach us about electricity, crude oil, music, literature, the mail system, Atlantis, John Logie Baird inventing television, etc. Cantinflas' humor is also in the cartoons. He'll stare at two nubile, pretty girls as they play sports on the beach or he'll ask some Egyptian Princess if she likes soap operas! This is a forgotten cartoon from the 1970's. I found some episodes on budget DVD's. In the 1990's, The New Kids on the Block had their own cartoon on the ABC Network. Kids will probably enjoy Spongebob Squarepants, The Simpsons, and Scooby Doo more than this cartoon, but The Cantinflas Show offers some food for thought.",1358812800,,1340,5.04054054054054

These cartoons are wonderful for children because they will learn the history behind them as well as the moral meaning of life. I recommend it for everybody!!!!",1109980800,,294,4.673076923076923
