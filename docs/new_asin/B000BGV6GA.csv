The good news is that the print quality is actually pretty good on these DVDs, and the movies range from decent to good. They're presented in a drive-in double feature format with an ancient cartoon in the middle.

Note that despite what's written on the box, Chills does not include a Magic Mummy cartoon. Instead, it's Mechanical Man (1932), featuring Oswald the Lucky Rabbit.

These are all public domain titles, so you can probably surf around and find them. But for pretty good prints presented in a friendly way, this isn't that bad if you can get it cheap.",1329350400,,1449,7.7696969696969695
