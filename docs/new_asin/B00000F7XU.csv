7907970,3,B00000F7XU,"Dark Obsession was hard to watch because it is not a movie that leaves you with a sense of satisfaction. We watch many movies with loathsome characters, but most get their just desserts, or at least some measure of retribution. That's not the case with the central character here, a philandering and bullying British aristocrat played by Gabriel Byrne. Granted, he is a good actor, but boy did I hate him!
Consumed by jealous lust for his wife and suspecting her of infidelity, he runs her over with his car, or so he thinks. Turns out he killed someone else. Byrne's friends become complicit in his crime by covering it up for him. One of them has a conscience that eventually gets the better of him, but will justice be done?
Amanda Donohoe is good as Byrne's longsuffering wife. This must have been in the middle of her LA Law days. She is adept at playing both innocent beauties and scheming she-devils (a la Lair of the White Worm).
Also look out for a young Sadie Frost as Byrne's sister. She looks much curvier here than she did in Bram Stoker's Dracula.",1060128000,2,1061,4.53125
