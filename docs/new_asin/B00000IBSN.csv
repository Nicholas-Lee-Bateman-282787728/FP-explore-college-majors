The connecting thread  here is that ""the other woman"" who most of the potential financiers are  boffing - is one and the same bimbo!

It would have been better if The guy from the original Batman movie wasn't the lead actor. The women should have been more strikingly beautiful than they were, in order for the viewer to believe they were gorgeous enough to be girlfriends of high-powered businessmen willing to put up millions to get them into films. They were the most unbelievable part of the whole movie, and their acting seemed like it was amateur night at the local high school. Danny Aiello is one of my favorites, but he was only mediocre in this, at best. His character had no bite, and wasted Aiello's abilities.",1464566400,,678,4.754237288135593

1219623,1,B00000IBSN,"""Mistress"": A Flap Review: A genre comic portrayal of films and the Real Hollywood. By Flap
Ugh. Double Ugh, ugh. I cannot in all honesty write a single word which won't give loose on this film before it gets permanently pulled.

\What I Liked:  Seriously, one really cannot be cruely upset with  guys who want to tango on other guy's laminate floors, and slither away.
  To a point, let's discuss lack of articulation.  I abhor many of the stereotypical lanqua de dia (or, Doc) wordes, I simply cain't find enugh of those suckas to make all that happen. So: Cut short for brevity only, Nuthin'.  moore,  period. Nuthin'.  I felt like I was sitting in a creek in the deep south, where bodies disappear, and gators are never seen until too- lat
Simply, there isn't one area I feel could be changed and/or helped. There just isn't enough story to fill in blank video screen. Better luck next time.
What I Did Not Like: Everything. All the drizzle, the frigid airs (NOT just the breeze!), the glam, the gold, the sparkly, fabulous night-play sort of toys- then what is a person to do?  Just enjoy. One could lose it all in a heartbeat.
I always stand by my reviews, but in this case maybe I can draw some slack. This is, too bad to say, just a no-talent, no quality, no entertainment film. Makes it
NO Good. Bank on it.",1464134400,,1316,4.445833333333334

1219626,3,B00000IBSN,"As I was viewing this, I'd wonder why I bothered and then I remembered it has a great cast and must be good or they'd all have never agreed to do it.  It's a charmingly weird farce with a truly weird author driving the plot.  But in the end, it's a good look at the resilient nature of the human soul and how deep inside, no matter how strange the circumstances, we just never can let go of  something in which we passionately believe.

Whoever doesn't see himself there...well then should go get a life..what spices life is the failures you have in the way....I enjoy this movie every time I see it....there are marvelous scenes that if you pay attention they will make you smile/cry..for instance they get together is that sleazy restaurant...and at time they're short paying the bill...""hey you're one dollar short..."" ha ha ha!! or when the old car is heating up...my good, and when they're trying to get the contract...OMG I laugh and I cry...I bet most of the projects in man's life are pretty much like this...great great film!!!",1343347200,,1218,5.064676616915423
1219667,4,B00000IBSN,"Having a minor fan-crush on the actress Laurie Metcalf, I scanned Amazon for some projects which may have eluded my entertainment radar. ""Mistress"" turned up.

Noticing all the big names, I expected something of an ""all-star"" cast deal: a great Friday night date flick which brings a few laughs and a look at the watch (and a yawn).

Within about ten minutes I could see - on this DVD - that something cool was heating up and I got engaged. The story is nothing new, about a last chance for a talented writer and his old, depressing script (which nonetheless) is very credible and provides a catharsis of sorts.

Another last chancer is the once respected movie Producer, Martin Landau, who sees a success (but is unwilling, or unable, to adjust to the new movie industry - his attire - and his 'stache are as outdated as his approach).

He connects with seasoned ""money men"" (DeNiro, Wallach, Aiello) who got what it takes. Each one also has a decadent association with a wild ""mistress"" (who also has a chance, like the writer, to rescue a ""career"").

Brilliant behind the scenes negotiations in all the right restaurants, the dialogue flows smoothly; the screenplay is a gem (though I found alot of superfulous soap-opera in the winding down.

Another Amazon reviewer mentioned Metcalf's performance and it is a wonder. A truly great actress, who to my knowledge, never sustained in great post-Roseanne projects. Her range is astounding.

DeNiro's ""power lunch"" with his potential partners, to me, is one of the best scenes he's ever done. Ever bit as memorable as his best work in Goodfellas or Casino. Although, following that terrific bit...he is rarely seen and seems less involved. (By the way, ""in real life"", it could be said he was a real ""money man"" for this movie! - one of five Producers).

I was not thrilled with the ending; or some of the stereotyping with the female cast.

Regarding that ""suprise"" ending (which I will not divulge) see if you agree that a better choice would be for Robert Wuhl to piece together the original failed project - which wrought the ever-changing new script!

(Interesting that Danny Aiello made a picture, which came out in '93, The Pickle, which has some of these elements).",1324857600,,2223,4.780678851174935
1219668,4,B00000IBSN,"We really don't need another film from Hollywood about Hollywood, but whether we want it or not, Hollywood cranks these films out by the hundreds, so at least this film, ""Mistress"" (1992) is better than the average gruel we are served. Which isn`t to say that at various times a really good film about ""the biz"" isn't actually produced (e.g.,  ""Sunset Blvd"", ""Swimming with the Sharks""), but generally speaking, these types of films are dreadful (e.g., ""Shrink"", ""The Last Tycoon"").

The current film stars Robert Wuhl as a screenwriter, with Martin Landau as the executive producer, and brief cameos from Robert DeNiro, Danny Aiello and Eli Wallach as prospective producers who have girlfriends (Sheryl Lee Ralph, Jean Smart, Tuesday Knight) who will need to be put into the film. Laurie Metcalf appears as Wuhl's girlfriend. There are very brief cameos from Christopher Walken and Ernest Borgnine.

The acting in this film is great, although special recognition has to go to Martin Landau and Laurie Metcalf. Landau often gives excellent performances, and this is one of them. Metcalf's acting track record is spotty, but in this film I thought she did her very best work.

The film is written and directed by Barry Primus. Primus is primarily an actor: he wrote only 2 films of which this was the first, and directed only 2 films of which this was the second. Robert DeNiro served as one of 5 producers and this is the first film under his Tribeca label.

If the film has any problem it is the inability to decide whether or not it is a satire, comedy, or drama. The main theme is satire, but at times it slips into comedy and then, sharply juxtaposed, we have drama (e.g., the scene between Wuhl and Metcalf). Nonetheless, the problem of the artist and the integrity of the work is preserved despite these changes in mood. I particularly like the parallel themes -  Wuhl's past life (and the incident with Walken), the topic of his script, and the realities of getting a film made.

If you have any interest in how Hollywood works, or more specifically, how a script becomes a film, this is a movie you will enjoy watching. Otherwise it is probably too focused for the general audience.",1293753600,2,2190,4.762532981530343
1219669,4,B00000IBSN,"Marvin Landisman (Robert Wuhl) has just about given up his tinseltown dreams when he gets a call about a script he wrote lo those many years ago. Jack Roth (Martin Landau) is interested in mounting a production of The Darkness and the Light and wonders if he'll meet some investors for lunch to pitch the idea? Before he can even get his people to call Jack's people Marvin is back in the game. There is only one catch: all the investors have girlfriends that want juicy roles in the production. And does the artist have to commit suicide?

Marvin vows that he won't compromise his artistic integrity, but soon he is in too deep, and his integrity has flown out the window. But is this Faustian bargain enough? Will the film ever be made? Stay tuned for the exciting conclusion.

For this kind of self referential Hollywood extravaganza, you have to wonder about the story behind the story. How did this film itself get made, and are there any parallels with the saga of The Darkness and the Light? It turns out there are. Actor Barry Primus wrote the script and tried to get it produced for years until finally his friend Robert De Niro agreed to back him, and play a part. De Niro plays Evan M. Wright, an astute business man whose mistress is the only one of the bunch who actually can act. Beverly (Sheryl Lee Ralph) is a force of nature, and it is obvious that she has talent to spare. Looking at Sheryl Lee Ralph's sparse resume, though, she was never given the opportunity to prove it to the world. She was however, the lead in the original Broadway production of Dreamgirls.

-----------------------
Jack: So when do we all get to meet your fabulous friend Beverly?
Evan: I'll give you her number. I'm not seen with her in public. My wife wouldn't like it.
===========================

Robert De Niro nails the know-it-all businessman--a personality type he is no doubt very familiar with. Christopher Walken has a small but pivotal role as troubled actor Warren Zell, no doubt the prototype for the Artist in The Darkness and The Light.

Robert Wuhl is best known for being in Batman--and at one point he compares his film's projected budget with Batman III's, an inside joke. He does an adequate job as Marvin Landisman but it's an uphill climb because the script he defends so passionately seems so weak. It actually could use a few jokes and could afford to lose the heavy handed ending. More Lightness and a little less dark!

Bottom Line is that Mistress is a good parody of the foibles of Hollywood but its weakness is that one suspects that The Darkness and The Light is just not that good of a script, and it is hard to get worked up over whether or not it ever gets made. Mistress is a much better script. I wonder if that one ever was made into a movie?

1219670,4,B00000IBSN,"Absolutely on a par with Altman's 'The Player' and the perfect companion piece to 'Living In Oblivion', 'Mistress' is a darkly comic delight from start to finish.

To begin with, the performances alone are worth the price of the DVD and then some. I mean, what a cast! (Even Christopher Walken appears in a memorable cameo.) And all give uniformly superb performances. But Martin Landau stands out, even in this array of top-notch portrayals. He clearly deserved another Oscar nod for his remarkable work in this, which I put right up there with 'Crimes And Misdemeanors' and 'Ed Wood'.

Barry Primus' terrific screenplay (co-written with J.F. Lawton) and his incisive, unobtrusive direction are bang on target, creating a squirmingly honest -- and often hilarious -- portrait of the seedy underbelly of Hollywood's independent film scene. Seldom has artistic desperation and compromise seemed so funny or so mercilessly accurate.

Also, the musical score by Galt Macdermot (of 'Hair' fame), and the cinematography by Sven Kirsten are absolutely first-rate.

As I mentioned up front, 'Mistress' would be the perfect companion piece to 'Living In Oblivion' (with marvelous performances by Steve Buscemi and Catherine Keener) and would be the ideal first half of a double-bill. 'Mistress' is the definitive statement on the sometimes sordid and always frustrating process of trying to get an independent film financed and into pre-production. 'Living In Oblivion' is the perfect statement on what often happens when that miracle sometimes occurs and a low-budget indie actually gets made.

'Mistress' is also refreshing in that all the female roles are given the same depth as the male characters and add up to what is simply one of the best ensemble casts I've ever seen in a comedy-drama.

Enjoy!

NOTE: In retrospect I'd like to have given this film five stars but can't seem to find a way of ammending the customer star-rating in the editing mode.",1224547200,5,1949,5.14873417721519
1219671,3,B00000IBSN,"As sly takes on the monumental effort it takes to hack it in  shark-infested Hollywood, films like 'The Player' or 'The Muse' come to mind. 'Mistress' starts with a similar sardonic view of big league moviemaking, it's even funny in parts, but it fizzles and pops into a run-on potpourri of the Artist's mean, mean plight.

A once-sparkling director from NY is strutting his way in LA making culinary videos. His dream script, about a painter who commits suicide in defense of artistic integrity, looks promising. But bit by painful bit, compromise by disillusioning compromise, he sees investors degenerate it into ludicrous pulp. And so forth.

Let me cut to the chase that the film did not: our protagonist soon realizes, surprise surprise, that a movie production is often about everything but the movie itself; loan sharks looking for the swift buck, mistresses and their shiny upkeep, quid pro quos, ulterior agendas.

Despite convincing performances the movie reeks of conflicting impulses of comedy and drama. The ambiguous title should have been a give away. Some truly provocative moments perk you up, then wilt into sappy cliches.

Folks with an above-average interest in cinema could probably sit this film out on a lazy afternoon, if only for cameos from Robert DeNiro, but it's far from the variety one recommends without reservations.",1117929600,6,1349,5.113636363636363
1219672,5,B00000IBSN,"If you want an insider's perpsective on the movie biz, two films that were released in 1992 give a view of the top and the bottom of the Hollywood food chain. ""The Player"" is a delightful black comedy about the top rung, the major studio insider who has the power to say ""yes"" just twelve times a year and green-light a big-budget movie (trouble ensues when he murders a particularly troublesome screenwriter). The opposite end of the food chain is lampooned in ""Mistress,"" where we get an insider's view of trying to get an independent film financed. Filmmaking is the most expensive of hobbies, and compromises must be made. Two writers and a washed-up producer get three businessmen on the hook as possible backers, but each has a mistress, who needs a part... It's a delightful exploration of how far can one compromise artistic integrity just to get a story in front of the cameras. Martin Landau is a delight as the has-been producer, and Robert Wuhl is wonderful as the  bemused screenwriter whose vision is rewritten into exploitative shlock.
