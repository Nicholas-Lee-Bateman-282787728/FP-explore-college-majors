8530763,5,B008V1NHSW,"Virginia Broitman has created a wonderful series of clicker training DVDs.  The ""Bow Wow"" series will give you a clear example of perfect timing, how to shape behaviors and build behavior chains and put them reliably on cue.  This DVD will help you understand how to shape behaviors from scratch using successive approximations to gain amazing results.  These videos are a MUST HAVE for your dog training library and are a great resource for training any kind of animal!  - Carol Byrnes, CPDT-KA",1355011200,,495,4.927710843373494

Plus Virginia Broitman is a very beautiful woman.,1346112000,,255,4.818181818181818
