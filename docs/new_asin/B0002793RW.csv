2064653,3,B0002793RW,"A perfect case study of how a studio/producer can ruin a novel and interesting idea and slowly turn it into a ridiculous parody of itself.

Season 1 is not bad.  Try to remember that it was made in the mid-90's, and that the CGI effects were incredible for that time.  What I liked most about Season 1 is that unlike most offerings of Sci-Fi (especially Gene Roddenberry) Earth Final Conflict Season 1 had a multi-layered story with decent touches of ambiguity.  So much Sci-Fi (especially at the time of this series creation) was straight forward, cut-and-dried.  They type where you always knew who the 'good guys' were, and the moral premise was easily recognizable.  Not so much on this show in Season 1.  Is Da'an on 'our' side?  And what exactly is 'our' side in the first place?  Do the ends justify the means?

If you're reading my review, and maybe you are wondering ""Where are the other seasons?"" - don't.  Just don't go there.  After Season 1 this show just started to take a big dive, right as it was gaining traction and momentum.  Season 2 was watchable, but it just started to get silly in the main plot elements and character motivations.  If you're truly hard core, have nothing better to do with your life, and can literally watch *anything* - then go find a DVD box set.  But don't say I didn't warn you.  Amazon likes to make a profit - and they obviously would be providing the other seasons if they thought it would provide them with satisfied customers.

Trust the immortal words of our mutual good buddy Spock - ""After a time, you may find that *having* is no so pleasing a thing after all, as *wanting*.  It is not logical, but it is often true.""",1516320000,21,1671,4.495016611295681
2064654,1,B0002793RW,"I have been watching Earth:Final conflict on Amazon Prime.  The premise has the potential to be a good sci-fi show. Being a fan of Star Trek, Star Wars, and similar sci-fi shows of good caliber, I was hopeful this Roddenberry show would also be a winner. The bad points, while too numerous to mention, take away any hope of that happening. The main hero, cant act period. His happy, excited, sad, angry, and scared emotions are all identical. His voice is a monotone with no inflection at all as though he is reading a boring textbook. He makes the other mediocre actors look like oscar winners. The alien ( supposedly asexual, neither female or male) looks like a large female suffering from alopecia and wearing Frankenstein lift shoes. Her hand and arm movements mimic a ballerina performing in swan lake, not in any meaningful way, and are so ridiculous it would be laughable except its not funny and this isn't a comedy.  Getting through the first 20 minutes was an ordeal that made me regret the time wasted. I kept watching hoping it would get better. It didn't and now I have wasted two hours better spent getting a root canal and far less painful to endure. Please save yourself and forgo this garbage.",1516147200,13,1211,4.654205607476635

2064662,5,B0002793RW,"I loved the original Battlestar Galactica, Star Trek: TNG, Star Trek: Voyager, Star Trek Deep Space 9, and V. My all-time favorite sci-fi show was in fact Earth The Final Conflict. I remember watching it once and having no clue what was going on so I stopped watching it. Then when I was cramming for my college finals, typing up papers, and playing EverQuest (not all at the same time), I use to catch Earth The Final Conflict late at night. Since there was nothing on, I kept watching it until the show really got me.

Basically the movie is about an alien species called the Taelons who are a highly developed species. The Taelons who are considered the leaders are commonly called the Collective. We are to believe that they come in peace as the opeing credits and the narrator suggest. But as you watch each episode, like V, the aliens seems to have alternative motives. Each continent on earth has a group of Taelons in which humans called protectors act like the secret service to protect the aliens. In turn the protectors are assigned a companion (a Taelon) who they follow and protect. Out come 2 Taelons on North America called Da'an and Zo'or. Zo'or doesn't like humans and likes to use them as ginea pigs (experimenting on them). Da'an seems like the nicer of the Taelons and has sympathy for the humans and is generally good (alhtough he has shown some evilness). Zo'or is played magnificently by Anita LaSelva, and Da'an is played by Leni Parker. Both unknowns in the film industry but both were great actresses. Yes actresses even though the 2 aliens were males.
Besides the aliens, Agent Sanduval (Von FLores) who is a member of the FBI seems to have bats in his attic (his wife was mudered by the Taelons but he isn't sure as well as other things). Renee Palmer played by Jane Heitmeyer is a companion protector and a member of the resistance. We are also introduced to Capt. Liam Kincaid in the later seasons who becomes Da'an's protector and the leader of the resistance. The resistance battle the Taelons and show humankind what the Taelons REAL purpose on earth is.

Im going madly insane because season 1 and 2 aren't available either on DVD or VHS. I have seaosns 3-5 which are the only seasons available. Yes in season's 3-5 all questions are answered and unfortunately EFC gets boring real fast after seaons 4. Many people feel that Season fall started the downfall of this show. Gene Roddenberry had a real winner in this action packed sci-fi thriller. Every episode had you wondering, questioning, and longing for more. You also are wondering who are the Jeridians? Will we ever see them? Are they the enemy of my enemy which makes them my friend?
The pilot which is this VHS tape introduces you to the Taelons, the protectors, and the resistance. At first you meet William Boone who has a lot of questions himself. He quickly leaves the show (rumored to be fired)but it definately replaced by a solid actor played by Robert Leeshock (Cpt. Liam Kincaid). Kincaid is actually half Taelon half human. This is a great sci-fi series and I was sad to see it go downhill after season 4. What is strange, puzzling, and just plain horrible is that seasons 3-5 were released but not 1 and 2. The pilot was great and is a mus have-----if it ever becomes available again.

<Update>
FInally! The first season is available on DVD. What insanity it was causing since I owned seasons 3,4,5 before season 1!",1194307200,10,3419,4.638613861386139

2064665,1,B0002793RW,"I really wanted to like this show, remembering it a little bit from back in the late '90s. The first few episodes had good writing and dialog worthy of viewers' concentration. However, after watching some 16 episodes from the first season I started to remember what I disliked about this show: the dialog reverted to very predictable good guy/bad guy rap; the technobabble was hideous; the plot lines were barely distinguishable from bad acid trips. Even Lisa Howard's giant hooters could not save this mess. <cough>

Not recommended. Highly not recommended.",1518825600,,558,5.131868131868132
2064666,5,B0002793RW,"I never got to see this while it was on Primetime TV guess I was too busy those days and didn't watch a lot of TV. The acting and set production where excellent for its time. It has a few flaws in the writing especially in season 5. As an all-around sci-fi by Gene Roddenberry it's certainly an excellent representation of his ideals. Leni Parker was excellent and it is too bad we don't see more of her in other movies!
The series has lots of bit parts by famous actors and early parts by actors who would become famous.
The CGI was excellent as well for its time.  It was definitely better to binge watch the series as opposed to having watched it weekly on primetime TV.
Lots of subplots that they follow through with. Which is unusual for most shows these days i.e. LOST!",1518393600,,775,4.308219178082192
2064667,5,B0002793RW,"This was a pretty good series despite some of the major arcs not being too cohesive.  At the end of season 4 it seems the only way the writers could solve all the problems they created within the story line was to completely change it.  I can understand why it only went to season 5, the writers destroyed their fan base.  I could only guess that someone left or got fired.  All in all worth the watch though.  Would be an amazing series for Amazon or Netflix to do a revamp on.",1518307200,,478,4.1521739130434785

You can watch an episode one week, it's gone the next, back again for a couple of weeks then gone again--and repeat.. All you get is an oblique statement about agreements not allowing the show to be currently purchased, as if Amazon is powerless and has nothing to do with the situation. We are not going to get the Prime comic-whatever channel to watch this show--especially not after the ridiculous games someone seems to be playing with it.

8023128,4,B0002793RW,"What a tragedy, this was perhaps the crowning jewel of Gene Roddenberry's small screen career, even better than Star Trek. The mysteries were involving, the characters were unique, and the plot in season 1 was fascinating and multi-faceted. In the right hands and directions, please Amazon redo this show as a modern remake, it can be a wonderful and awe inspiring piece of Sci-Fi.

What happened was a lot of budget cuts, bad casting choices in later seasons after old cast left, and poor scripts after season 3, leading to the worst offender in season 5. What should of have been the best Sci-Fi series of the 21st century was left in tatters.

I give this 4 stars for what it was in its first season and even lesser extent 2nd-3rd season, but more too for its untapped potential.

Most of us Sci-Fi fans with a knowledge to this shows background knows that in the 1960's/70's Gene Roddenberry pitched this idea to several studios, including the studio that would eventually make V, which has a similar concept. There's been a good deal of historical debate on whether the idea of V was Gene's or not, but Earth Final Conflict was its own unique creation, in some ways surpassing V in its understanding of humanity and even more so in our technological drive.",1522022400,,1261,4.671171171171171
8023129,4,B0002793RW,"I have no doubt that had Gene Roddenberry been alive to produce this show, it would have met my expectations.  Unfortunately, unlike GR's other enterprises, the acting in E:FC was hit and miss -- some of which was great, but much of which was awful.  I personally thought most of the alien characters were acted very well; it was the human characters that generally sucked.  There are also a lot of plot holes and other ridiculous aspects, like characters making really stupid choices, the writing at times being as poor as Star Wars.  The series starts out weak, as most do, and gained its stride around season three.  Season four wasn't quite as good, but had its moments.  Season five was half filler, and half terrible.  The ending was an interesting way to wrap it all up.

That all said, I still consider the series worth the watch.  Its most redeeming quality is that his wife apparently did her best to preserve, with good success, the philosophy that can generally be found in GR's visionary contributions to TV and film -- that of positivity, tolerance, and unity.  And so, within this series as with his other works, GR's spirit can be found embedded throughout, reminding us that of humanity -- and indeed all life in the cosmos -- is interconnected, and that evil can only ever delay the strident effort of the good.",1521936000,3,1329,4.665236051502146
8023130,4,B0002793RW,"If you like realism in your sci-fi, please look elsewhere. This show has a blatant disregard for being consistent within its own universe. That said, it is usually very good and fun to watch, if you don't think too hard about it. And I do mean about any part of it, because I cant think of one single fact about E:FC that makes consistent sense throughout the show.

But enjoy! And maybe skip season 5. It does get better after season 1 - some of the episodes match the quality of the best sci-fi I have ever seen. I just want to strangle the writers sometimes because it is so inconsistent.",1521244800,,591,4.324324324324325

More melodrama than drama with actors playing over the top and casting drawn from the Really Bad Actors Guild.  (Think John Davidson and David Hasselhoff).  The writing - don't even go there.  By the second season the writers are already grasping at alternate dimensions and parallel universes.  Somewhere, in the far reaches of the universe Roddenberry is screaming, ""Stop!!
