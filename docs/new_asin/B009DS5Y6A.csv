5321162,1,B009DS5Y6A,How sad and disappointing MM has become w/the dull and boring new Barnaby. The new shows r so uninteresting that I can not appreciate the great writing. I will no longer be awaiting my midsomer Mysteries. I feel like I lost a good friend.,1352678400,20,238,4.431818181818182
5321163,5,B009DS5Y6A,"In the U.K., these four mysteries were originally part of a season with four previous episodes, released here as ""Set 21."" Thankfully, these four stories return to the offbeat, humorous alternative universe that Midsomer fans crave. What could be more enticing than pints of bubbly cider with DCI John Barnaby (Neil Dudgeon) and DI Ben Jones (Jason Hughes)? But beware, in Midomer County, even Beltane celebrations are treacherous. Children dance around a Maypole, whilst fat sausages roast under the refreshments tent, and the cider is not all it seems. Midsomer is a remarkably deadly place, a deceptively delicious chocolate box filled poisoned confections. Generations of loyal inhabitants risk life and limb to live in Midsomer's bucolic hills and dales. Thankfully, DCI John Barnaby is as gifted at detection as his cousin Tom. The Barnaby line is rooted in Midsomer's earth, they are dependable in never being surprised by bizarre occurrences. Nothing flummoxes or gobsmacks a true Barnaby. The excellent actor Neil Dudgeon enriches Midsomer with his wry nuance. And Jason Hughes is intrepid as Detective Inspector Ben Jones, his humor adds another level of complexity to the series. Coziness in the U.K. has a macabre stain; like a lace doily blotched with tea, darkness lurks at the edges. In Midsomer County's dangerous environs, denizens inflict and suffer numerous creative malaises.

The U.K. boasts numerous fine (and often underrated) actors. While you impatiently wait for more ""Midsomer,"" you may want to catch Neil Dudgeon in an unforgettable performance in a superb story in episode 3 of the first season of the BAFTA Award winning series&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Street-Complete-Collection/dp/B005N8KP3Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Street Complete Collection</a>. Neil Dudgeon plays Brian Peterson, a teacher accused of being a flasher. Ultimately, who is the betrayer? His wife claims she has never known him, perhaps it is the other way around. As Brian Peterson gazes out of a taxi window passing street after fogbound street, you understand that each street is full of stories, each person's life with it's moments of mystery. Be aware that&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Street/dp/B005N8KP3Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Street</a>&nbsp;is gritty, rough, and harrowing, quite unlike Midsomer!

As to these four eagerly anticipated episodes of ""Midsomer,"" each story is 90 minutes long, and subtitles are provided. Further episodes have been created since this offering, but their U.S. release is a long slog away. Some impatient Midsomer fans resort to purchasing via the U.K., to play on Region-free DVD players.

The Sleeper Under The Hill
Midsomer fans know that under the cheery, bucolic surface of Midsomer's green hills and dales, a darkly pagan heart fiercely lurks; this helps explain the untoward death-toll. On Crowcall Farm, Alex Preston wants to plow Gorse Meadow. But local New Dawn Druids desire free access to the Meadow, since it contains the sacred stone Crowcall Circle. In a typically gruesome Midsomer death, Preston is found disemboweled on the central stone of the sacred circle. The farmer's wife is too glamorous, and indulges in a dalliance with her fencing-master. A poacher is accused of malfeasance, whilst lay-lines and archaeological artifacts come into play. Barnaby and Jones must unearth local village gossip and history to solve the mystery.

The Night of The Stag
Watch out! It's another pagan holiday in Midsomer County, where moonshiner investigators have it hard. Why ruin a vat of cider with a corpse? Answer: this is Midsomer, after all! And poor DCI John Barnaby gets quite sick on the unsavoury stuff. His dog Sykes is not impressed. During Beltane celebrations, an investigator of illegally produced alcohol is found dead in cider-vat. Barnaby and Jones believe the whole community is somehow involved. Families go so far back that they call one orchard-owner ""French"" because his ancestors only came over with William the Conqueror. The unsavory murder may be related to the revival of an old, pagan Midsomer traditions, while guest-star Warren Clarke does a memorable turn in a deer-skull. Beware horns in Midsomer!

Sacred Trust
After a chapel's lovely stained-glass window is broken, a nun is found murdered in Midsomer Priory, a secluded community in a lovely edifice that houses the nuns of the Order of Saint Mathilde. The murder forces the nuns to permit the outside world access into their world; enter our intrepid detectives Barnaby and Jones. They discover that the community is vulnerable to relinquishing ownership, and their priest is no help. The Priory is subject to a Deed of Trust that only allows the Order to remain living there only as long as there is a viable community. If the Order fractures, the ownership reverts to the original benefactor's heirs. Beneath the calm face of the Priory, Barnaby and Jones must untangle a skein of motives, while the Order's ancient silver goes missing, and teenagers run amiss.

A Rare Bird
Beware the power of the tweet. The president of the local Ornithological Society, Patrick Morgan, is a brittle bloke, myopic about birds, distracted by binoculars, and his delicate Russian ballerina of a wife is preggers. Without much assistance from said ornithologist. So he suspects every man in Midsomer-in-the-Marsh of impregnating her. The rare Blue Crested Hoopoe has made a controversial appearance in the village, setting birders against one another. DCI Barnaby annoys his dog, and his wife, with his surprising lack of map-skills in the woods. Death looms like a loon-call on a lake, and Patrick is lured to his demise. Barnaby and Jones face frustrations whilst investigating Midsomer-in-the-Marsh's binocular-weaponed world of bird watching.

Neil Dudgeon with his snobbish, smirking, arrogant, and smug manner is not a patch on the ""old"" Barnaby - charming, kind, intelligent,and  a true gentleman. The whole thing is tedious. They brought the dog in to make it cute, but really... Such a wooden performance from the ""new"" Barnaby and his wife - no dog in the world would compensate for it. As for the new pathologist instead of quirky, clever, eccentric Bullard... Why? She brings nothing in.

5321290,2,B009DS5Y6A,"The ingredients of this once great series remain, but the the dish has grown cold and gelid-- mainly because of the writing, I think.  I found the Rare Bird episode particularly distasteful because I love birds.  It presents birders as loonies and creeps, and it shows them watching North American birds (wood warblers-- yellow rumped, Lucy's, black-throated blue, redstart,  which don't occur in Europe) in England!  I couldn't figure out if this was just a sample of the writers' general ignorance and indifference to the details of the story, if it was meant to show what complete morons the birders were, or if it was just some kind of weird in-joke. ""Yellow-rumped warbler-- haw haw."" England has lots of beautiful birds, why not give them credit? There used to be real characters in the series-- now they are  stereotypes-- in The Rare Bird--""goofy birdwatcher,"" ""frustrated spinster,"" lovely Russian ballerina,"" ""he-man bad boy,"" ""crusty farmer,""  ""arrogant doctor,"" ""mad musician"" etc. Even Barnaby and Jones have become stereotypes-- they behave like Joe Friday and his sidekick in the 1950s American show Dragnet-- trudging around bullying everybody.",1432339200,,1160,5.2771739130434785

5321294,5,B009DS5Y6A,great show,1430697600,,10,4.5
5321295,1,B009DS5Y6A,"I am confused why there are so many positive reviews of this?  Is it that people do not want to let it go when it's time has come or they are hoping that things would get better?

This would cover 21, 22 & 23 for me since they are all the same.  Never would I have thought that I would have to keep pausing since Midsomer was so bad.  It appears we kept the Barnaby and Midsomer name and capitalized on that.  This is clearly the ""Barnaby"" show.  There is no resemblance to the old Midsomer show whatsoever.  Watching Barnaby and his wife is really uncomfortable, they are both passive aggressive and borderline abusive and insulting to each other.  Jones was still treated like an idiot even though Barnaby really could not figure out how to adjust to Midsomer without him.  It is no wonder why that actor quit as well as the doctor, what actor wants to play the same dimwit without ever having a chance for that character to grow.  Once the regulars start leaving that is never a good sign.

Seemingly and for the most part, one of the reasons many watched was to see the stately homes and beautiful scenery, those are few and far between since close to half are shot in the precinct.  Where old Barnaby and Jones did many scenes together, all of these are mostly filmed apart with Barnaby getting most of the airtime.  It shows very little of the ""partner"" as the old one did.

When you watch the commentary Dudgeon was the only one of the two who did not compliment Hughes but Hughes and most everyone else kept saying how ""lovely, funny, kind"" etc., everyone is and I was waiting for some kumbaya moment.

Barnaby and his wife whose name I really don't know since they rarely use it are more like cardboard, cutout, one dimensional characters.  I don't know if anyone noticed but even the dog is more like a little robot with no personality and every time the wife goes to pick up or walk near the dog the dog bolts.  That dog is a really good actor since how do you force a terrier to have no personality?  I have seen Dudgeon in other shows and did not realize it was him but he was as bad an actor in those as this.  He is monotone in almost everything, both are cold and have no emotional investment.  At least Nettles was quirky and had some funny moments and the energy between him and Jones worked.  I am also not a fan of how the stories are going which, odd to say are getting gory and dark which you really did not see to this extent and the dark you rarely, if ever saw.

I think it is fine for people who want to hold on and just cannot let go of what was one of the greatest, most looked forward to shows but the time has come.  Instead of going out with a bang on top, they are slowly sinking into the mire and muck, trying to do shows that reflect some of the more current story lines in other shows.  The quaint and quirky Midsomer is a thing of the past.  Take away the theme music as they did in some of the new ones, it is just another cop show.  If the stories on the British websites and papers are saying the show is going to end there is really good reason and cannot argue with it.

When and if the new Barnaby DVD's come out on Netflix, I will pass on purchasing them.",1429574400,8,3198,4.2

So what's the story Amazon, why are these not the UK version?? Also sets are numbered differently in the UK, can we get our act together and  get the proper amount of viewing pleasure here in the states and not wait 2 years or so to have these released??  Very disappointing to realized I have

5321412,1,B009DS5Y6A,"I have enjoyed this series so much that I decided to give it a chance even after the departure of the main character, Inspector Tom Barnaby, played by John Nettles. Unfortunately, It was  the chemistry of those specific actors, as much as the story lines, that made this show so wonderful. For the time that an episode lasted you could almost feel that you were part of Midsomer itself. The new Inspector, John Barnaby, played by Neil Dudgeon just doesn't have the same charm. His character comes across as more supercilious than likable. I also very much miss Barry Jackson who played George Bullard, the pathologist. His interactions with the Inspector were always a treat to watch. I would have enjoyed seeing him do more rather than have him eliminated from the production. ( For the sake of political correctness he was eliminated and replaced by a young woman to add ""diversity"".)
 If you were a fan of the series starring John Nettles, you may settle for this newer version. But for me, the new incarnation doesn't cut it. Sadly, I will no longer look forward to ordering the newest release.",1402704000,11,1098,4.7434554973821985

5321464,5,B009DS5Y6A,"While earlier episodes starring Neil Dudgeon, the new Barnaby in Midsomer, tended towards a darker tone, Set 22 of MIDSOMER MURDERS returns to a lighter touch. Of course there are still plenty of lovely means of dispatching victims at hand to keep fans happy. These, along with those curious eccentricities (The Night of the Stag) that define the very essence of Englishness, are the steak and kidney pie of the show, without which MIDSOMER MURDERS would rapidly waste away.

Perhaps such familiarities are even more important now that we have eased into the Dudgeon era of the show. Be that as it may, the return to Englands murder capitol that is precipitated by each new set is fun, relaxing and enjoyable.

The first episode, The Sleeper under the Hill, is average MIDSOMER, but the disc also contains a very charming extended interview with Neil Dudgeon, and another with Jason Hughes. While hes not John Nettles (who is?) Dudgeon is a very charming man in his own right and his riff on the MIDSOMER theme music is quite delightful.

Lest anyone think the writing is becoming lax need look no further than The Night of the Stag for a reference (including a direct quote attributed to King Henry II) to the murder of Thomas Becket in Canterbury Cathedral in 1170. This is not only clever, it is subtle and the allusion is left only for those who catch itno explanation is offered. Touches such as this show the creative minds behind MIDSOMER MURDERS recognize the intelligence of their audience.

In the sets third episode, A Sacred Trust, some steps are taken (inadvertently, perhaps) to portray people of faith a little more respectfully. The episode features a handful of nuns who, eccentric though some of them may be, are shown to be real, intelligent people. This is a welcome change to the shows propensity for making anyone who expresses a certain spiritual perspective (specifically Christianity) automatically the villain.

And why shouldnt MIDSOMER MURDERS acknowledge this foible? The show clearly aims to please, never losing sight (as some of the grittier police shows do) that audiences wish to be entertained. That is why we enjoy such touches as Barnabys interaction with his dog, Sykes. Its fun.

The best surprise of set 22, however, is the last episode, A Rare Bird. It is exceptional, with some of the best direction Ive ever seen in a MIDSOMER MURDERS episode. Some very clever camera effects are on hand, though they always serve the story and never seem superfluous. Of these segments, the ballet flashback is particularly effective. This episode is a return to the very best this show has to offer.

MIDSOMER MURDERS is a perennial favourite world-wide, not just in the UK. There are even Midsomer tours for fans of the show to indulge their guilty pleasure. When a television show becomes a tourist industry that is the time to really take stock. As it stands today, MIDSOMER MURDERS still has plenty of life in it. That says a lot about the quality of the creative artists and the traditional tastes of its (significantly large) audience.

The series is still in production, and there are almost a dozen episodes already broadcast in the UK that haven't yet been released in North America. That is good news indeed!",1397433600,,3246,4.867753623188406

5321509,2,B009DS5Y6A,"I finally decided to give an opinion after watching series 22 &23.  The ""charm"" of Midsomer Murders was the ""charm"" of the English village and now with the departure of John Nettles and other cast members, the ""charm"" has also departed.

The banter between the characters of John Barnaby and Ben Jones doesn't work, they don't have chemistry.  Jason Hughes is a  little to old to be playing the buffoon to the smiling psychologist Barnaby.  Its always difficult to follow in someone's shoes (especially Nettles) and make the part your own, but Dudgeon hasn't done it yet.

With the departure of original cast members and little or no village characters or eccentrics to provide village gossip, ""Jonesy"" now  knows everything in all the villages.  He also kicks in doors while Barnaby turns his back and also slams suspects against walls.  Very charming.  This action can be found on other numerous shows although I must admit, the murders on Midsomer were indeed some of the most gruesome and grizzly seen on TV but done with class, dialogue and great acting.

The village is just about gone, only to be seen with one village manor house usually side by side a modern house, gone are the village streets and shops replaced with council housing, punks and now the Causton police station is located in modern building. The only interesting new character is Sykes the dog and he doesn't have any lines.  Once shows are changed for change sake they lose what made them good/great to begin with, their uniqueness.  They then become ordinary as all the other in your face shows.

I must be content with re-watching the original series with John Nettles.  Brian True-May should just let Midsomer Murders slide into the setting sun.",1389139200,2,1724,4.836177474402731

This show is internationally loved and watched. It will never be the same show , as now all of it's main characters are gone. Speaking of season 15. where dci jones moves on too.  But he's still in this set.  Which aired back in 2011. The show gets more quirky in the last four of the season , which is this set. but let's be honest , the show is a old favorite and it's best years are behind it. But it can still provide us with quirky tales of murder. And this set is by far better than the last. But that's because the new detective is finally making it his own. And that makes the last set seem correct. As one would expect a new detective to settle in and then make this new turf his. And that's what is happening. which means that those who complain about last season too loudly , miss the point of character development. But , this is a easier watch for sure. THe stag night episode is wacky for sure. The abbey murder episode is more straight mystery, but it runs smoothly.  I liked the last set too. but it's never going to be the show that it was back in 97-2009. That's ok though, as it is still a good and quirky show that will continue on for at laast several years. And we fans will continue to enjoy it. after all the other quirky detective shows are all off the air pretty much. Blue murder, rosmary and tyne, jpmnathon creek. all of them could have had longer runs but the brits never made enough eps. At least we can say this show gave  us what we wanted and then some.",1383955200,,1759,4.045977011494253
5321545,4,B009DS5Y6A,Neil Dudgeon does an ample job replacing John Nettles in the series. Though his relationship with police partner Jason Hughes bespeaks of a little actors rivalry which is equally comedic and off putting. So I'm not surprised at Hughes replacement in later segments. Being a devoted Anglophile I love a good mystery show and will continue to follow the program. The DVD was at a sale price and well worth the money.,1383523200,,414,4.763888888888889

5321548,5,B009DS5Y6A,"In Season 22 of my much beloved ""Midsomer Murders""  I found  the acting of Neil Dudgeon, as the British Detective Chief Inspector  John Barnaby to have more of a ""serious outlook "" on the solving of the  splendidly sinister four (4) stories (about 1 hour and one half each)in this season.  He is a wonderfully astute detective and with very keen perceptions well able to find out who""done it""?  Gone is the wry sense of humor of Detective Tom Barnaby as played by John Needles.  However, John's Detective Partner Ben Jones, as fabulously acted by Jason Hughes ((I am sooooo glad that he is still in the series) supplies loads of humor--I adore him!

As a very long-time fan of ""Midsomer Murders"", I really enjoyed Season 22 with its mysteries involving modern-day  Druids, ancient English traditions, scary nuns and a bird competition filled with very eccentric ""bird watchers""  that are willing to  commit murder--with all of the tales greatly acted, written and directed.

Fear not, readers, the methods of dispatching the deceased are still as intriguing (who would have thought a murder victim would have been killed by using an apple harvesting machine) and the motives still as convoluted.  John Barnaby and his wife (clearly a high flying school administrator) are childless but have a great rapport and discussing his cases with his wife often gives him ideas or hints which lead to a solution.  The scenery is still magnificent as evil and murder thrive in Midsomer County's stately homes, mansions, businesses against the backdrop of history and beautiful scenery.

They work very well together. The series is so much better, (we own every available Tom Barnaby set), no more DCI Tom putting half the village under ""house arrest"" because of his petty jealousies. Tom Barnaby would invariably hound the hell out of those who would be the next victim! I was wondering if the producer of Midsomer ever realized what a Nazi-ish type of policing he was portraying throughout the series. I suppose those who loved DCI Tom would have a problem with a more relaxed, intelligent approach to the part. I really get absorbed in the plot now because I know I won't have my intelligence insulted with ridiculous demands by a truly stupid man (Tom Barnaby) in a good suit. But, phew!, enough about the old guard! The new blood has finally come down to earth and the show is actually an interesting mystery.

His so called romantic scenes with his wife are stilted which may be because she is constantly ignoring him and doing her school work.  Worst of all is his relationship with Sargeant Jones - he comes across as taking delight in ridiculing him.  I'm so sorry that Jason Hughes is leaving the show, but don't blame him.

5321666,2,B009DS5Y6A,"I have been an avid and devout fan of Midsomer Murders from its first airing.  I have re-watched every episode.  Suffice it to say, I was heartbroken when John Nettles as DCI Tom Barnaby left the show. I was doubtful that the series could carry on without him.  Still, trying to be optimistic; I held out hope that I could learn to enjoy the series with Neil Dudgeon as DCI John Barnaby.  I like Neil Dudgeon. I saw him in The Mrs. Bradley Mysteries and thought he was charming.

My opinion and this review is definitely slanted by my love and enjoyment of the original.  I have tried to judge the ""new"" show on its own merits and it does have one, which I'll mention when I've finished ranting.  I can't do an unbiased review.  I can't help but compare.  I am in mourning for the original.

My grief is fresh as I just barely finished this latest installment.  The first four episodes without John Nettles were an incredible disappointment but I wanted to be fair; giving new DCI John Barnaby and DS Ben Jones some time to gel.  Sadly, in my opinion, these four episodes show no improvement over the previous four. In fact, I found them to be worse. As of this writing, I am not looking forward to the next set and don't think I'll watch it.

My biggest complaint has to be the appearance of contempt for the existing department, lead by Tom Barnaby, specifically his long-time sergeant, Ben Jones, and pathologist, Dr. George Bullard (who left the show in the first installment of the ""new"" MSM,) displayed by DCI John Barnaby.  This was confusing to me because John and Tom are cousins and Tom was no slouch!  Why the contempt? In addition, Jones and Bullard were also exceptional at their respective jobs.  Why did the writers do this?  There was no need to make John out to be the savior of a sinking ship! Of course he's going to do things his way, but why this, arrogance and smugness?

I hate what has been done to DS Ben Jones played by Jason Hughes.  Before writing this review I watched again every episode since Jones, then a PC, joined the show in House in the Woods.  He began as a bright lad who caught the attention of DCI Tom Barnaby and was elevated to DC to work alongside Barnaby. I watched him grow as a detective and he earned his sergeant rank in This Year's Model.  The writing played up a rapport between Barnaby and Jones that was often comical but always respectful.  I enjoyed this aspect of MSM with all of Barnaby's sergeants over the seasons.

I guess I have taken, what I see as an affront to Jones, personally.  Silly, I suppose, for a grown-up to do regarding a television program, but nonetheless here I sit whining and wailing.  If I drank, I might be crying into a pint of bitter or a G&T.  Ben's character has taken a beating, and I don't think it was necessary in order to show that DCI John Barnaby is a good detective.  Jones's fun and often funny interactions with Tom Barnaby and other supporting cast members left when the cast left but couldn't something along the same line be emulated? I lay my disapproval, disappointment, and crankiness directly at the feet of whomever is responsible for making this ""new"" MSM what it is! It is not Dudgeon's fault, in fact he plays his part as DCI John Barnaby brilliantly.

I smile when I think back over some of the funnier scenes with Jones, the look on his face in Country Matters when it sinks in just what is going on at the culinary school, riding stables, and shooting center.  Then there is his floundering around for the right way to describe a rather lurid depiction of an ""orgy"" and coming up with, ""loin-instigated"" in The Animal Within. Or the time, in The Black Book, his obvious discomfort looking at an intimate nude painting and said, ""Nice rods,"" referring to some split cane fishing rods hanging adjacent to the painting. Now, he seems to be an inept joke.

I read that Hughes has left the show.  I haven't verified the truth of this, and if it is true; I don't know the circumstances surrounding his leaving, but if it was by his own choosing, I don't blame him.  I hope he's moving on to something as good or better than his role of Ben Jones alongside John Nettles as Tom Barnaby.  Hughes's leaving will complete the mass exodus from the original MSM. So, the series I loved is no more. Farewell to: John Nettles as the incomparable DCI Tom Barnaby, Jane Wymark as Tom's wife Joyce, Laura Howard as their daughter Cully, Kirsty Dillon as DC Gail Stephens, Barry Jackson as Dr. George Bullard, and now Jason Hughes.

I guess it is too late to suggest that perhaps a smarter route to have taken was in making DCI John Barnaby a spin-off such as Inspector Lewis from the Morse series.  Maybe that would have been a better choice straight out of the box?

I won't go into detail about each episode since Nettles left (eight, as of this writing Aug. 2013) but I just have to mention Night of the Stag in this set.  I have enjoyed many of the previous fanciful and far-fetched plot premises of the past, but Night of the Stag went too far.  Way, way, way too far!  I think I watched the entire ninety minutes with my mouth open in stunned shock.  I kept looking over at my husband and as we exchanged looks of disgust; I heard myself saying things like, ""Oh, my gosh! They've got to be joking!!! This is a nightmarish dream sequence, right? Someone's going to wake up and it will all be over, right? What in the world?"" As the final scene of this episode came to an end, I was certain that Jones, Barnaby, or both were going to be killed and thus would end not only the nightmare of this terrible episode but what was for me, the nightmare of this set.

When reading this review please keep in mind that I am in mourning.

Oh, the one thing I found enjoyable about this new MSM? I love the dog, Sykes. Good boy!",1376265600,46,5812,4.408622305529522
5321667,5,B009DS5Y6A,"I'm a fan who's collected all of the ""Midsomer Murders"" sets as they've come out. This Set 22 (out of 22 so far) has 4 episodes which range from classic Midsomer Murders (great plots with a hint of strangeness) to downright odd.
The ""Midsomer Murders"" characters are based on the original mystery novels by Caroline Graham. The best, both in books and TV show episodes, is the very first of both, ""The Killings at Badger's Drift"". It set the tone with perfect plotting and strong characters, including an eerie mother-son duo who made your skin crawl.

1.  ""The Sleeper Under the Hill"" (episode 86) Evan Jago and his faithful dog are out in the woods, poaching (the squeal of the caught rabbit is maybe unneeded verisimilitude). Evan sees crows circling over a meadow and goes to investigate. In the middle of the meadow, there is an ancient stone circle, smaller than Stonehenge but still impressive. What really captures Evan's attention, though, is a man's body lying on it's back, draped over the small bloodstone (like an alter stone) in the middle. The man is quite dead and crows are pecking at him.
Barnaby and Jones investigate. The body is that of Alex Preston, who owned the land and had put up barbed wire fence to keep everyone, including the local druids, away from the circle. But the druids are dedicated to peace, aren't they? There must be another reason for Preston's death.
Though I enjoyed it, ""The Sleeper Under the Hill"" veers a little into gothic B-movie plotting. Written by David Lawrence (Harsent). The town is Midsomer Mow.

2.  ""The Night of the Stag"" (episode 87) It's dark and a man in a suit and tie runs for his life through an orchard. Faceless men with dogs chase him. He stumbles down a hillock, wrenching his ankle, and is surrounded. Before the dazed man has time to think, a huge machine off to the side fires up, floodlights blinding as it approaches him with a terrible roar.
The next scene is jolting, because from the night horror we go straight into cheerful country music and daylight at the Midsomer Abbas May Fair. Jones and Barnaby are in town passing out fliers, seeking information on a missing man, Peter Slim. Yes, it's the man we saw being chased. It turns out he was a revenue agent, what we'd call an I.R.S. agent. This is a village known for it's hard cider, and Jones and Barnaby partake. Barnaby's sweet cider goes down smoothly, but then his stomach start lurching. He's not the only one throwing up before the beekeeper shouts to the cider mill owner, ""French! Your barrel's bad. The sweet! It's ratty.""
Eee-uu, rats drowning in the cider vat? But it's worse than that. The mill owner finds Slim's body in his vat.
There's more side-plots and convolutions than you can shake a stick at, and you can bet that a Midsomer murder isn't about something as simple as tax avoidance. However, the plot of ""The Night of the Stag"" devolves into poor melodrama and from there I just got annoyed. There's good acting, but it's lost in the goofy storyline.
Screen play by Nicholas Martin. The towns are Midsomer Abbas and Midsomer Herne.

3.  ""A Sacred Trust"" (episode 88) Added danger always makes it better, right? A young couple is making whoopie on the wooded grounds of a priory, when someone in a nun's habit, face hidden, stands over them waving her arms. The startled kids run off half-dressed, and when they circle back, the boy's trousers are gone. In retaliation, the next night, the boy and four friends scale the priory walls, and throw bottles through the stained glass windows of the priory church. He's not very nice, this young man. Probably someone has taught him well how to be a bully.
DS Jones tries to investigate the window smashing, but prioress Mother Julian will not let him in. Jones asks, ""Don't you want us to catch whoever did it?""
She replies, ""We'd rather pray for them.""
Unfortunately, she has to change her mind about letting the police in. There's only four sisters left in Midsomer Priory. And the next night, one of them is strangled while checking on the henhouse. That leaves only three nuns left, and their chaplain, the young priest, Duncan Hendred, gives Barnaby and Jones a very interesting interview: ""The original nuns of the priory were French aristocrats, Inspector, and the present lot regard themselves as their heirs. Whatever was going on, they'd put up a show in front of the servants. Which is, essentially, how they see me.""
This is an interesting episode, and I found that watching it a second time allowed me to better ponder the sins & vices shown. How about pride? If the roof needs fixing, and you refuse to sell heirlooms to fix it, are you being prideful or are you honoring your traditions?  Even nuns can disagree on this.  Screenplay by Rachel Cuperman and Sally Griffiths. The town is Midsomer Vertue.

4.  ""A Rare Bird"" (episode 89) Someone is spying on a couple in a mansion. A long-distance microphone tied to a fence picks up their conversation inside the house. A camera with a long distance lens takes photos through the windows. And so the spy hears the overjoyed wife tell her husband that she's pregnant. And the husband howls, ""Who's is it?""
Then we are plopped into the middle of a birding feud. It is serious stuff. Ralph Ford has claimed he sighted a Blue-Crested Hoopoe, an endangered species native to Uganda and seldom seen in England. As a ""mega"" sighting, he would get 10 points and win the annual List Competition for the Midsomer-in-the-Marsh Ornithological Society. The points are denied him, though, by Patrick Morgan - who we've already met as the angry husband. When Morgan's body turns up, caught in a birder's net and drowned in the lake, there are suspects and motives to choose from.
For fun, I googled ""blue-crested hoopoe"" and found birdforum(.)net. Reading their take on Midsomer Murders birds was fun to read. Here's just one comment on the ""A Rare Bird"" episode: ""It was hilarious; apart from the netted Greenfinch and the fictitious 'Blue-crowned Hoopoe' every bird mentioned was North American... Yellow-rumped Warbler, Black-throated Blue Warbler, Meadowlark and Sage Sparrow... forget the Scillies and Fair Isle, clearly Midsomer is the place to go birding! Seriously though it is shocking the writers couldn't do five minutes research to find what birds would be seen in typical British countryside.""
Screenplay by Steve Trafford. The town is Midsomer-in-the-Marsh.

Bonus Feature: The bonus feature is on disc 1, titled ""Midsomer Murders in Conversation"" (35 minutes). This consists of clips from the show and interviews recorded while they were filming series 14 (the English series 14, which equals the U.S. DVD Sets 21 & 22).  Commentators include Neil Dudgeon (plays DCI John Barnaby), Jason Hughes (plays DS Ben Jones), Jim Parker (composer for ""Midsomer Murders since the beginning), James Moss (director photography), Paul Bennett (2nd assistant director), James Nash (location manager), Lou Hooper (3rd assistant director), Jeff Hudson (unit driver), Andy Bailey (gaffer), Martin Cox (best boy), Liam Ryan (boom operator), Mark Soar (location caterer), Colin Skeaping (stunt coordinator) and Colin Stephens (facilities).
This was an enjoyable extra, with Dudgeon (a natural story-teller) and Hughes talking about their very early experiences with acting.
Hughes made an interesting comment on the Midsomer Murders musical theme, that hadn't occurred to me before: ""What I find very interesting about the tune is that you can't hum it. You have to make up a silly sound to do dooddly-diddly-do.""  That is so true! Parker mentions that the haunting tune is played on a theramin.

All episodes and the bonus feature have English subtitles available.

5321669,1,B009DS5Y6A,"Neil Dudgeon just does not cut it. His arrogant and condescending version of the main character is similar to Roy Marsden failure to portray the main character Adam Dalgliesh. There is no chemistry with the wife and even the dog failed to save Neil this time. Interesting enough, the new Coroner seems to bring some potential future to the relations. The Stag just brings shame to the rural side of England and their police organization. That crossed the line so well established in the earlier version of Barnaby: No weapons and a little out of shape but still believable. Midsommer should be praying there is no terrorist in your area. I am quite surprised the British did not formally complain for this episode.
I watched some of the interviews. Jason should leave. He needs to show character and just leave. He has great potential but I feel he settles for a lousy character. He would be a perfect sidekick in Inspector Lewis type of series. The episode with John Nettles where he infiltrated a cult was his greatest performance and provided a glimpse of what Jason Hughes can do.
Now, what is it with main actors like Warren Clarke and Kevin Whately that need to go outside of a well establish dimension of their persona in their own series. No question they play well evil characters; they are good actors after all. But why ruin their image? Maybe they still need more money.",1375920000,5,1382,4.691358024691358

5321683,1,B009DS5Y6A,"While I don't dislike Neil Dudgeon, his character of John Barnaby just doesn't mesh well with Ben Jones which is probably why Jason Hughes is leaving the show. There are just too many old faces missing that makes this show changed to the worse not better. I do prefer John's wife and dog to Joyce and Cully, however that will not keep me buying these sets and when Jason departs so will I as they have already started filming without him and have cast a new face.

The mysteries were inferior to previous Midsomer's and The Night of the Stag was one of the worst episodes ever. I will never re-watch this episode as the ending was over the top - where were the police? With that amount of time death would have been imminent for DCI Barnaby. It didn't matter who was guilty or innocent in this episode as I had lost interest some time before the ending occurred.

Sacred Trust was one of the better episodes and I did enjoy it as it was more of the old Midsomer even though it was a bit sad.

One has to wonder if Midsomer has ""jumped the shark""?",1374278400,36,1046,4.2727272727272725
5321684,5,B009DS5Y6A,"It's back to the basics. Guest stars in stellar settings with multiple murders for Barnaby and DS Jones to solve. Neil Dudgeon seems to have come into his own with the lead of this crime mystery series. Jason Hughes adds the assistant elements needed to make this as inviting as the1997 series beginning. Fiona Dolman is stepping up with her own important thread as Barnaby's wife; and Tamzin Malleson is now a regular as the important Dr. Wilding, forensics. The humor and personal relationships have returned as sub-plots, like, and just as good as, days of old.

The Sleeper Under the Hill
Midsomer farmer Preston is disemboweled as a stone circle sacrifice in a mini-Stonehenge-like setting. Poacher Evan discovered the body and an obvious suspect but locals high priest Druids are also suggested, as is lovely Mrs Preston (Claudia Harrison- `Murphy's Law'). A suspect then killed. A great pub scene with fiddle--all too brief. A 3rd murder; Midsomer tradition that lives on.

The Night of the Stag
A missing revenue man is the last thing this boot-leg beer community wants. He dead in a (hard) cider vat. And gives Barnaby and Jones a case to solve and the town drinks on. Star Warren Clarke plays Samuel Quested, a local; and ciderman Anthony Devereau is played by Patrick Ryecart (King's Speech, Nancherrow, Coming Home). More to this cider tale than just a body.

Sacred Trust
Mother Julian (Joanna David (Pride and Prejudice) wants no investigation into the chapel's vandalized stained glass window. A murder forces the issue and opens the priory doors where secrets lurk inside.

A Rare Bird
Reminiscent of the film ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Big-Year/dp/B004LWZWBU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Big Year</a>"" (2011) released just prior to this 2012 episode. If you like this episode, you'll like the film, and vice-versa. Patrick Morgan (Alexander Hanson) loves birds but questions his wife Nina (Genevieve O'Reilly). Who impregnated her? A rival birder? A Hoopoe bird sighting sets the bird watching locals in frenzy. The call of the wild is a call to murder, and Barnaby must find his way in the woods. Birder Ralph (James Dreyfus- `Notting Hill'); a local ladies'-man (Paul Nicholls- `The Passion' playing Judas); & a feuding neighbor (Tony Haygarth- `Emerdale') all provide star suspects.

5321687,5,B009DS5Y6A,"this show does something particularly british.  while america has always been known for its noir like mysteries and resulting film noir, the british have always excelled at making one comfortable, cozy and serene, sipping tea in a beautiful garden, and THEN unleashing murder and mayhem onto that scene.  this is so british that no other country even tries copying it as a genre.  this show exemplifies what is best in this genre and best of all puts satire, farce and humor over the whole rendition.  two veteran actors play the detectives to perfection.

case in point: one of the episodes turns on a custom from centuries past when the gene pool got too inbred in these villages.  thus, there would be a stag night when the men would go to another village to have a night with the women there to inject new life into the gene pool.  our intrepid detectives have to solve a case where this practice still occurs and the lead villain wears a stag head--it is an image you will never forget!

another episode involves a convent and another image which will stay with you always is detective ben jones dressed up like a nun to solve a murder at the convent.

5321694,3,B009DS5Y6A,"Sorry I've seen all the Midsommer; in fact all the Acorn Mystery Series.  Watched the evolution of all these works... This new set is so predictable and so I'm interested in these new Midsommer episodes.  A little campy in the beginning as well as we should have guessed; everyone turns out to be incompetent except the new DCI, whose brilliance seemed a little mediocre.  Too many socialist and anti-religious sentiments inset into the dialogue as messaging and propaganda as well from all these BBC Mystery movies anymore...

I can check them off one by one I've seen so many. It looses me; though I would rather it didn't... I'm interested in story and depth and not socialist manipulations during my down time and all the childish prejudicial imagery.  The messaging has always been pointed as evidenced in the character interpretations.  Yes, there's another religious wacko; another gay this or that; another voter message or silly anti-Free Market or anti-business big bad meany bullying the poor little sad and childlike protester trying to save the planet from the big bad Corporation! See! See! all with subtlety. Forget about good relationships, families with values; Ah! lets make them all Academic and put a new spin on it!  So predictable.

In the new Midsommer changes, it was a tough transition from John nettles, and I do appreciate that.  So far, I'm not sure I really want to take valuable time away to see any more of these.  The first set was disappointing. Don't know if it will get any better; but both my wife and I were unimpressed, and for us we felt we were thru with it.  Maybe it will grow,  I don't know.

8540462,5,B009DS5Y6A,"Verdict in.  Different.... but great.  Recently  got  sets 22-25 .  Set 20 was a somewhat weird ""goodby"".  Set 21 was a unusual as an introduction and disturbing, but  the new 22 - on series is more modern but still original and entertaining.  While sets 1-19 are all about a retro village environment and close family relationships with murder mysteries,  Sets 22 - on seem to have graduated to a more modern family situation.  Neil Dudgeon is excellent as John Barnaby and Fiona Dolman is magnificent as a modern ""Mrs Barnaby"".  The excitement is back, but not the same.... maybe better.  Even the family dog has serious character.  I look forward to future releases.",1491177600,2,669,4.814159292035399
