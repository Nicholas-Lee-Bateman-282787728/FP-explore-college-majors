7899233,4,630587087X,"Volume 26 in the ""Twilight Zone"" DVD series include some very good episodes and in particular one classic one. Anyone, whether your are a fan of the show or someone just discovering the series, will enjoy these stories submitted for your approval.

The DVD starts off with ""Big Tall Wish"". Rod Serling in his younger days did some boxing including while he was in the service. He was somewhat good at it too until he lost a boxing match that convinced him to hang up the gloves for good. Boxing however would prove to inspire him in later life as a writer especially with his brilliant teleplay ""Requiem For A Heavyweight"". During the run of the ""Twilight Zone"" series Serling would include a couple of episodes dealing with boxing. One was ""Steel"", a very good story starring Lee Marvin. The other one is on this disc, ""Big Tall Wish"". It is the story about a boxer, played by Ivan Dixon later of ""Hogan's Heros"" fame, and a young boy who more then a fan of this boxer but admires him. The young boy wants nothing more then to see his hero win in the ring. In fact he knows his hero will win and tells him so before he heads off to the arena for the fight. By the way, the boy also believes in magic too. The boxer is in for a bad night in the ring. He takes a beating until his opponent finally knocks him down for the count. The young boy is watching on the TV as this is happening. All at once the young boy wishes his hero had won instead. Next thing the boxer knows his opponent is on the canvas out cold while his hand is being held in the air. He can't understand what just happened. Last thing he remembers is going down from a punch and being counted out. Later when the young boy tells his hero how he wished that he won the match instead the boxer doesn't believe the boy. What happens next? Well you will have to watch it yourself to find out. This however is a great episode that you will get caught up in as you watch what happens next in the story.

""Showdown with Rance McGrew"" is one of those TZ episodes that is of a comedic tone to it. Rance, played by Larry Blyden, is one of those cowboy TV stars. He knows nothing of roping and riding or the proper way of using a six shooter but he is the star of one of the most popular TV shows. Rance IS vain and pampered as the star of the show. But one problem for Rance apparently is his show is watched in the ""Twilight Zone"" because next thing he knows he is face to face with THE Jesse James, played by Arch Johnson. Jesse takes exception to how Rance portrays cowboys on his show and challenges him to a duel. Rance is about to find out what a real cowboy is like. That is if he can survive the experience. Not a bad episode all in all.

Barry Morse stars in the next episode ""A Piano in the House"". In it Morse plays a film critic named Fitzgerald Fortune. He is a cynic who likes to belittle people and expose their weaknesses. He comes across a player piano in a shop that he discovers makes whoever is at the piano reveal their true selves. He delights in this buys it and brings it home. During a party he plans several of the guests suddenly find themselves revealing things about them that is embarrassing. Fortune delights in this until the proverbial tables are turned on him.

The last story on this disc is I think one of the true classics from the series, ""Night Call"". It stars Gladys Cooper as an invalid woman who finds she is starting to get phone calls in the middle of the night. At first it is an annoyance night after night with the phone ringing. But then it starts to become frightening as she hears someone speaking on the other end. She becomes frightened and tells her caretaker what is going on. During this too it is revealed how she ended up a wheelchair and that plays a factor to this chilling story. Finally she contacts the phone company to see if they can trace where the calls are coming from. They do but not before she finally has the courage to speak to whoever it is that keeps calling her in the middle of the night telling the person to leave her alone. The consequences of that will haunt her the rest of her life. Gladys Cooper is excellent in this episode and her performance is one of the things that makes this on of the classic episodes from the TZ. ""Night Call"" would definitely be on my top ten list of all time favorite ""Twilight Zone"" episodes.

If you are a fan of TZ and don't have this volume then you need to get it to add to your video collection. If you have never seen the ""Twilight Zone"" before this would be an excellent volume to get to help introduce you to the Zone.",1422403200,,4595,4.2229806598407285
7899234,5,630587087X,"""Night Call"" is one of my all time favorite episodes from the Twilight Zone. It was directed by Jacques Tourneau and written by Richard Matheson and is definitely a very memorable, spooky tale and actually frightening when I think back on it. Directer Tourneau is the master at this sort of genre. He directed the original CAT PEOPLE, I WALKED WITH A ZOMBIE and CURSE OF THE DEMON. An old woman receiving phone calls in the dead of night over and over again and the way it is filmed is rather frightening in the hands of Jacques Tourneau. You can feel the fear, the anxiety, the loneliness and the intimacy of these unknown moments tearing away at the soul. Elva Keene played by Gladys Cooper is the lonely old woman confined to a wheelchair and as the night calls continue she learns that they are coming from beyond the grave. There is fear, desolation and hope and something very spine tingling and chilling about ""Night Call"" and the impression it leaves upon the viewer. ""Night Call"" is from the Fifth Season and I saw it when it first aired. I still get a chill in my bones whenever I watch it.

""The Big Tall Wish"" from the First Season is a moving and touching episode written by Rod Serling and directed by Ron Winston. The incomparable Ivan Dixon plays Bolie Jackson, a washed-up boxer who by accident breaks the knuckles of his hand right before the night of his big comeback fight. Bolie is knocked to the canvas and beaten or is he? A little boy named Henry (Steven Perry), the son of Bolie's girl fiend has made a big tall wish. There is a lot to come away with in this episode of dreams and reality and the power of faith.

I have come to like ""Showdown with Rance McGrew"" through the years. This is a comic episode from the Third Season written by Rod Serling and directed by C. Nyby. Larry Blyden is great as a spoiled cowboy actor who ends up facing a real desperado. It is great to see so many of the character actors from way back when.

""A Piano in the House"" with Barry Morse and Joan Hackett is a brilliant episode strong on characters and performances. A ""A Piano in the House"" which first aired on February 16, 1962 shows the cruelty that lies beneath the surface of some people. Barry Morse is at his best as he uses a player piano to make his guests reveal their innermost feelings and desires in a most vicious fashion. The late Joan Hackett is very good as she underplays her role as his abused wife. Earl Hamner, Jr. wrote a brilliant and memorable script for this episode as he chose a different tune to reveal each character as it was played on the piano. ""A Piano in the House"" was directed by David Greene.",1421193600,,2640,4.394683026584867

These are the episodes in this collection...

The Big Tall Wish (Episode 27 - April 8,1960): An over-the-hill prize fighter (Ivan Dixon) gets a boost from a little boy who's a big fan with a very rare gift in a disillusioned world...an unswerving belief in magic.

Showdown with Rance McGrew (Episode 85 - February 2, 1962): TV cowboy star Rance McGrew (Larry Blyden) finds himself in a real Old West saloon where Jesse James (Arch Johnson) challenges him to a showdown over TV's negative depiction of outlaws.

A Piano in the House (Episode 87 - February 16, 1962): Fitzgerald Fortune, a cynical critic (Barry Morse), uses a magical player piano to disclose his party guests' hidden selves. He delights in the game, but not when the tables are turned.

Night Call (Episode 139 - February 7, 1964): Lonely, confined to a wheelchair, Elva Keene (Gladys Cooper) starts to get numerous phone calls. Terrified, she screams the words that will doom her.",1393200000,,1001,4.830409356725146
7899236,5,630587087X,The series is my favorite. Everything came as expected. No problems. I will order from them again with my Twilight Zone purchases.,1360368000,,130,4.954545454545454
7899237,3,630587087X,"Out of the four episodes, I really liked two(2) of them. That is ""Night Call"" & ""A Piano in the House."" Both of these stories I felt had an element of relatiblity to them, then the other two. I didn't feel ""showdown with the Rance McGrew"" really addressed how one would imagine the annoyance of the false protrayal of the men of the Wild West in history  would be handled that well. To lightly done. In ""The Big Tall Wish"" the acting was well done, but something in the way the story was put together seem to be missing. The ending was somewhat of a disappointment too.(anyway, that's my take on it).",1340755200,,600,4.357142857142857
7899238,5,630587087X,"This DVD has one of my all time favorites on it, and the other three shows were terrific too, I love ""A Piano in the House"", but my favorite is the one with the old lady who keeps getting the mysterious and scary phone calls, this DVD was in great condition and came in a very timely manner",1322438400,,290,4.017241379310345
7899239,5,630587087X,"THE TWILIGHT ZONE VOL. 26 contains four winners.  A PIANO IN THE HOUSE is one of my all-time-great eternal favorites from the T.Z. series.  NIGHT CALL is also extremely clever, and it features an ironic ending that combines two ironies (it is a double ironic ending).  NIGHT CALL is a ghost story that features a telephone with the same telephone number as used in the movie, GHOSTBUSTERS.  I have enjoyed watching THE BIG TALL WISH every year for the past several years.  SHOWDOWN WITH RANCE McGREW is also pleasant to watch, and it has a pleasant ironic ending.  But SHOWDOWN is not quite the majestic work-of-art of the other three stories on this disc.  In my review, I quote some of the dialogue early in the stories and, in this way, I avoid giving away any of the endings.

ACTORS.  In PIANO IN THE HOUSE, we find Barry Morse (plays theater critic, Fitzgerald Fortune), Cyril Delevanti (1889-1975) (plays an elderly and delightfully wrinkled butler), Philip Coolidge (grouchy owner of an antique shop), and Joan Hackett (lovely young wife of Fitzgerald Fortune).  Philip Coolidge is one of the ""ugly-man"" actors in the Twilight Zone series.  The other ugly-man is Mr. Everett Sloane who stars in T.Z. episode, THE FEVER (story about a gambling machine).  Ugly-man Philip Coolidge also appeared in INHERIT THE WIND and in NORTH BY NORTHWEST.

NIGHT CALL stars Gladys Cooper (1888-1971).  She also starred in MY FAIR LADY (1964), co-starring Audrey Hepburn and Rex Harrison.  Wikipedia informs us that Gladys Cooper often played characters that were, ""disapproving, aristocratic society woman.""  In NIGHT CALL, she plays a character who is disapproving, controlling, and demanding.

THE BIG TALL WISH stars Ivan Dixon (1931-2008) as a boxer named ""Bolie.""  Walter Burke (1908-1984) plays the lockerroom assistant.  His face resembles that of Willem Dafoe.  Kim Hamilton (1932-2013) is a hottie who plays the landlady in Bolie's apartment building, and the mother of her young son.  The son has a major role in this story but he (Steven Perry) seems not to have continued with any acting career (too bad).  This is one of Rod Serling's two boxing story.  His other boxing story is the very, very, very, very, very excellent REQUIEM FOR A HEAVYWEIGHT starring Anthony Quinn, Jackie Gleason, Mickey Rooney, Julie Harris (love interest), Madame Spivy as ""Ma Greenie,"" and Cassius Clay (cameo appearance).  Please note that the videotape version has the complete movie, but the DVD has been uniformly criticized for having too much stuff cut out.

SHOWDOWN WITH RANCE McGREW.  As I mentioned above, I am refraining from describing any aspect of this story, mainly because I've written too much about the other stories.

PIANO IN THE HOUSE. Morse enters an antique shop, cluttered with junky antiques.  He is dressed impeccably and wears a formal hat.  ""Hello, is anyone there?  Hello,"" he exclaims.  ""Is anyone there?""  Then we see the store owner, busy on a ladder adjusting a Greek mask used for dramatic productions.  ""How do you do, I'm Fitzgerald Fortune . . . the theater critic,"" says Barry Morse. (When he says the words, the theater critic, he uses a very ominous tone of voice.)  The owner replies, ""So what?""  ""Isn't rudeness something of a handicap in your line of work,"" asks Barry Morse.  ""What's that to you, hmm"""" snaps the owner.  ""When I saw the sign TREASURES UNLIMITED,"" I stepped through that door fully expecting to encounter a sentimental old biddy in an ostrich-plumed hat and a moth-eaten feathered boa . . . instead to my sincere delight, I discovered a misanthrope,"" exclaims Barry Morse.  The owner (still in his usual foul mood) retorts, ""I've got work to do, what are you looking for?""  ""I'm looking for a present for my wife's birthday.  My wife an an absurd notion that she would like to learn to play the piano.  She doesn't have a trace of talent.  Do you have one of those old pianos that plays itself?""  Then, the owner lifts the cloth cover from an old player piano.  The piano starts to play a jolly ballad.  In an instant, the personality of the grumpy shop owner changes for the better, and he becomes sentimental, and he breathily gushes, ""You must be a man of great personal magnetism to attract a wife so young . . . youth and wisdom, hand in hand . . . and for her birthday you're giving her the gift of music . . . oh, how touching . . . you are taking our young bride out tonight . . . some quiet nook, where you can get together in the midst of the great world, looking into each others' eyes.""

Barry Morse is taken aback by the owner's transformation, and asks, ""Has it occurred to you that you are extraordinarily susceptible to the power of music?""  ""Isn't everybody,"" dreamily replies the owner (note that the piano is still playing).  ""Well, to some degree yes,"" replies Barry Morse.  The piano roll is completed and the music stops.  ""You gong to stand around all day taking up my time,"" snaps the arrogant shop owner (his personality reverting to its previous form).  Then, Barry Morse asks, ""Tell me, are you sentimental about anything besides birthdays?""  But the shop owner, back to his arrogant self, replies, ""Birthdays?!?!?  They're a waste of time and money.""  Fitzgerald Fortune (played by Barry Morse) then leaves the shop, and mutters, ""Strange.""  (This could very well be the only time in the entire Twilight Zone series that one of the characters remarks that the goings on are strange or weird or irrational).

Back in the mansion of Fitzgerald Fortune, the delightful Cyrus Delevanti (the butler) makes his entrance, and Barry Morse puts a music roll into the player piano, and witnesses how it changes his personality.  After that, Fitzgerald Fortune puts a different music roll into the player piano, and tests how it changes the personality of guest at the birthday party, namely that of a character named, ""Marge Moore.""  The acting and the script are beyond excellent, and many viewers will be astonished and impressed at the stunningly accurate depiction of ""the human condition,"" as set forth in this Twilight Zone story.

NIGHT CALL.  Begins with sound of wind and repeated gashing of lightning and rumblings of thunder.  First, we see an empty wheelchair in the old lady's bedroom, and then we see the wrinkled old lady, tossing and turning in bed late at night.  The phone rings.  ""Hello,"" answers the old lady.  ""I didn't hear, the thunder, hello, who's on the line please,"" continues the old lady.  The old lady tosses and turns.  A minute later, the phone rings again.  ""Hello, hello,"" she exclaims, but only static comes out of the phone.  The wheelchair plays a major role in this story, and its significance is not revealed until the end, when the old lady relates the story of an automobile accident that left her crippled.

The next scene takes place in the morning, and the storm is gone.  A fat middle-aged woman arrives at the old lady's house.  She is the old lady's nurse, who plays cards with the old lady and drives her on errands, when errands are needed. The old lady is on the phone, complaining to the phone company and asking if the storm had damaged the phone connection.  ""Nobody cares if I live or die . . . nobody knows what it is like to be alone,"" complains the old lady.  Then the phone rings (the old lady and the nurse are both near the phone).  The old lady answers, and there is static, but this time the static is less random.  ""Margaret, come here quickly,"" orders the old lady to her nurse.  The phone rings again, and this time we hear the sound of a moans from a man.  The old lady is driven into a panic by the moaning sounds.  And then, the man calling says, ""Hello, hello, hello,"" with a weak whimpering tone of voice.

""So far as she's concerned, I'm just a nervous old biddy falling prey to my imagination,"" complains the old lady to her nurse, referring to the employee at the phone company.  The old lady is torn between the urge to block the phone calls, by leaving the headset off the hook, and by continuing to answer the calls, in an attempt to mitigate her gnawing loneliness.  She refers to the man on the phone as, ""the terrible man who keeps calling me.""  A closeup of the phone shows the number:  KL5-2368 (in case any viewers of this Twilight Zone episode wish to call the old lady).  Please note that the same telephone number was used in the movie GHOSTBUSTERS (who yuh gonna call?). In other words, it is remarkable that both ghost stories (NIGHT CALL and GHOSTBUSTERS) use the same telephone number.  Apparently, the writers of Ghostbusters intended to pay homage to Night Call.  Then again, later at night, the phone rings and the old lady answers, and the man says, ""I want to talk to you.""  The old lady is frightened and she screams, ""LEAVE ME ALONE.""  The story continues to unfold, and the viewer is treated to a double ironic-ending.  The ending is a tear-jerker, so be sure to have a hanky nearby.

BIG TALL WISH.  Starts with a billboard sign reading: St. Nicholas Areana.  Bolie Jackson versus Consiglio.  General admission $11.26.  Reserved $11.75.  Ringside $13.00.  We see Bolie in his apartment, looking in the bedroom mirror and counting the scars on his face.  A 6-year old boy is nearby, and he is son of the landlady.  He chews gum and wears boxing gloves.  ""A fighter don't need a scrapbook . . . knows what he's done, where he's fought, you read it on his face, he's got his whole story cut into his flesh,"" says Bolie explaining his boxing career to the boy.  Then he explains about his fights and the resulting scars, ""St. Louis 1949 . . . Syracuse, New York . . . Italian boy, the first time I got my nose broken twice in one fight . . . Miami, Florida . . . he did this with his laces . . . there I go, running down the street trying to catch the bus to glory.""  The topic of this Twilight Zone episode is Bolie's boxing match.  The fight begins 12 minutes into the story.  This is a feel-good Twilight Zone episode.  Children play major parts in other of the Twilight Zone episodes.  The best of these are ONE FOR THE ANGELS, KICK THE CAN and LIVING DOLL.  Other great episodes with children include CAESAR AND ME and WALKING DISTANCE.",1207094400,,10196,4.662738496071829

All four episodes are strong and good, and there's something for everyone. For the fun-lovers, there's ""Rance McGrew"" - a light-hearted TZ episode that's really funny in certain parts. For the child in all of us, there's ""The Big Tall Wish"", which tells us to never stop believing in the magic. For the more serious-minded traditional TZ lovers, there's two excellent episodes in ""Piano in the House"" and ""Night Call"" - both excellent in every way! While most TZ dvds suffer from a slow episode or two thrown in with a few strong ones, this dvd has nothing but goodies on here. A great one to start your collection with!",1048464000,7,753,4.385714285714286

7899242,5,630587087X,"Although I write this under one particular DVD in the series, these comments apply to each and every one of the DVD releases.
Twilight Zone? On DVD? In Black and White? What were they thinking of?
They were  thinking of me and others just like me who loved this classic old science  fiction program and longed to have the entire collection in a compact,  guaranteed to last collection.
Although the entire set is not yet  released (they are up to volume 31 at the moment), I'm sure it will be --  not many more episodes are left to do and the sales appear to be  good.
This show is the 1950's anthology that started it all. Began as an  experiment in the late 50's by Rod Serling, it has become a classic and is  still enjoyable 40 years later.
The DVD collection is crisp and clear  both for audio and video, and thankfully still in the original black and  white. Each DVD features three or four of the original uncut television  programs plus a history of the Twilight Zone and a short bio on Rod.  Treasures and More Treasures of the TZ also include an interview by Mike  Wallace (quality of this is only so-so due to technology of the time) and  the orgininal marketing trailer made by Rod to sell his brain child to  potential sponsers.
The series itself is being released in what seems to  be no particular order (talking about the episodes here), with each DVD  containing either four 1/2-hour shows or 2 1/2-hour episodes and one of the  fourth season hour-long programs. This collection also includes the  installments which were not syndicated and are almost impossible to find on  broadcast television.
This is a 'must have' for anyone who enjoyed the  program while growing up -- or for anyone of any age who appreciates a good  SF show. Naturally some episodes are better than others, but most will  agree that the overall quality of the series clearly stands out.
Take one  for a test drive -- then order them all. You'll be glad you did.
