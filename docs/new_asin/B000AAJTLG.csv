8359133,5,B000AAJTLG,"LOST is an epic 120 episode television series about some people being shipwrecked on an island.

The director is JJ Abrams, director of the newest STAR TREK movies as well, he will again be sitting at the helm as he has signed on to be the director of STAR WARS episode 7.
The movie is brilliantly filmed and the cinematography is perfect. There are memorable scenes and the show is presented with rich landscapes and tropical scenery.
Essentially the shows cover the two hours of the pilot episode, subdivided into two episodes. There is a creature that hunts them, a beast that resembles the big blue monster in MONSTERS INC. Essentially it is a cross between a prehistoric giant sloth and a ferocious polar bear.
The video also features Dominic Monaghan who was Merry in Lord of the Rings. Merry and Pippin the two hobbits who were sort of like like Beavis and Butt-head.
This movie is a good travel companion. It is a good movie to watch while you are on a plane flight. Well, maybe not. It is probably a movie that is best viewed at home or else on a ground based vehicle like a bus or a skytrain.",1371600000,,1102,4.455445544554456
