Also, it covers each incidents happens in each Grand Prix.  They don't miss any of them.  The bad thing about F1 2003 review is because it is a bit too short.  So, if you want to watch a F1 review, watch this instead of F1 2003, I guarantee this is the best F1 review.",1108339200,,405,4.075949367088608
2194413,5,B0006SSQ8Y,"I also own the 2003 F1 Review, so I will compare this to that one. I loved the 2003 dvd, but it could have been better. I think that this 2004 dvd really came through for me. It has everything that I wanted that wasn't on the 2003 dvd. There are new camera angles and more explanation of exactly whats going on. So you don't have to be a huge F1 fan to understand whats happening. But there are some terms used that a new fan might not get at first but as you watch more you'll catch up. This dvd is just bigger and better than the 2003 dvd. You get to ride along with Jensen Button for one lap and you can watch his RPMs hit almost 19,000! Of course the main attraction here is Michael Schumacher and he doesn't dissappoint as he takes the competition to school almost every race. Its just so much fun to watch these cars rip around the tracks. I used to be a casual NASCAR fan but after watching this dvd I just can't stand to watch boring,lame oval racing. This dvd is awesome and if you are a F1 fan you need this dvd. If I could afford it I would buy it for you. It really is ashame that F1 doesn't get more coverage in the USA. These cars are so high tech that its almost insane. And the sound! I could write a book about how crazy F1 cars sound. Everything is here and this dvd does not dissapoint. I would give it 6 stars if I could.",1108252800,3,1341,3.9888475836431225
8042991,5,B0006SSQ8Y,THIS DVD IS A GOOD RECAP OF THE 2004 SEASON.  The F1 recaps get better with each passing year (more info on each dvd).  For those of you who are new to F1 and want to see Ferrari at their best this is the season to get!,1375142400,,219,3.6382978723404253
8042992,5,B0006SSQ8Y,Bought it as a present for my boyfriend. Delivery was fast and the CD was in perfect condition. It played perfectly in our blu-ray player.,1359158400,,138,4.56
8042993,4,B0006SSQ8Y,"I've only been a Formula 1 fan since late 2006 (drawn in by the Schumacher - Alonso battle, and totally hooked since), so I've been watching these season review DVDs to get caught up on background, etc., as well as passing the winter off-season without experiencing total withdrawal symptoms.

By 2008 standards, the features are a little lacking ... you can play thru start to finish or play the individual races. Inexplicably, the video of the fastest qualifying lap doesn't play when you show the event, you have to play them separately.

Content wise, whether you were/are a Michael Schumacher fan or hater his domination of the 2004 season is awesome. This is when he won his 7th and final World Championship.",1201219200,,714,4.844262295081967
8042994,5,B0006SSQ8Y,"After being utterly disappointed with the quality of this year's 2006 season review, I will have to settle on the idea that the 04 disc is still the best.
The video compression is nearly exceptional considering the length of the film on only one disc.
The sound is just as it should be:  loud!  The cars launching from the start line and the pits is terrific as the engine strains against the rev limiter.  The deafening sound on the pit straights is accurately reproduced as well.
Also, Formula One reaches a sort of ""peak"" for this era during 2004.  The engine development pushes ever higher, with the 3.0 liter V-10s delivering over 950 bhp at over 18,500 rpm, and installed in a 1300 pound car that includes the driver.  Bridgestone and Michelin are all about making the absolute fastest, stickiest tire possible.  In fact, most standing lap records are held by the Formula One Ferrari of '04.
This would be a great disc to introduce to a new fan as it is sure to impress.  It is a great year in which the engineers really trounce the rule-makers and produce a devastatingly fast and dangerous car.
WhitestarDVD, producer of this disc, was dropped after 2005.  They did a great job on this review and it is a shame they were dropped.",1190764800,,1237,4.5656108597285066
8042995,5,B0006SSQ8Y,"Okay F1 Executives. Let's look back to this 2004 review and marvel at how CLEAR and SHARP the video quality is. Now go watch your latest 2006 edition, or just pour hot molten lava into your eye sockets! Little blurry isn't it?",1180051200,,226,4.404761904761905
8042996,4,B0006SSQ8Y,"Im big Schumacher fan and this season was so great for Ferrari. They made all records!! Picture is good, commentary is nice. What I only marking litle minus is digital 5.1 sound missing.",1168387200,,186,4.666666666666667
8042997,4,B0006SSQ8Y,"My first Formula One Review DVD. I bought it mostly for the on board pole position laps that unfortunately can not be played all together but have to be selected one by one. Other than that, the whole review was done nicely. A must have for any Formula One fan.",1143504000,2,261,4.24
8042998,5,B0006SSQ8Y,"I have not seen the previous ""year in review"" DVD's, however this one met all expectations as a critical F1 fan.  The pole sitter's, uninterupted, in-car qualifying lap footage for each track is awesome.  The only thing missing was telemetry graphics (tach & speed readings).  I thought each event was thoroghly reviewed and the footage was clear.  Second to last year of the V-10 era.  This is F1 history.  Next up: 2005 year-in-review!",1141862400,,437,4.917808219178082

THERE IS NO-ONE LIKE HIM, SOME DAY I HOPE I WILL SEE HIM AND TELL HIM HOW MARVELLOUS HE IS. IM WRITING A BOOK ON THIS GREAT SPORTING ICON AND TO ME HE HAS GIVEN ME INSPIRATION TO WRITE IT, NO OTHER FORMULA 1 DRIVER I KNOW OF HAS GIVEN ME THIS. I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THANK YOU SO MUCH MICHAEL.",1117497600,2,496,4.02020202020202
8043000,5,B0006SSQ8Y,"This dvd is a great record of the 2004 F1 season and is even better than the excellent 2003 review DVD, continuing in the tradition of the seasonal reviews released on video for the past 20+ years. If you have the 2003 DVD get this, if not I also recommend the 2003 DVD.

It captures all the major action throughout the season and the great racing that occurred throughout the field. Although Ferrari walked over the opposition there was still lots of good racing and that is all covered here; From Trulli's maiden win in Monaco to Raikkonen's crushing win at Spa. The footage is all of excellent quality and shows incidents that weren't always shown during the TV broadcasts, such as DC and Barrichello colliding during the Japanese GP. In addition to the season review there is the option of watching each race separately with the complete footage of every pole position. The only complaint would be a lack of interactivity, however it's far superior to the previously released 2000 season, which lacked the ability to play the complete season.

Overall a great DVD, top quality, and is recommended for anyone with an interest in F1 and/or motor racing.",1114300800,5,1155,4.77
