8378327,3,B002R2FE28,"Perhaps a riveting piece for its time but it didn't stand up well to time. Much too long but an interesting insight into the British legal process and the distinctions they make in murder and how the punishments vary. It could easily have been shortened by a half hour and though they want you to believe these boys are around 16-years old and tough guys it just doesnt stand the test of time. As always, follow the money. Worth a watch and it was back in the day that I could still watch a British movie and understand what was being said without Closed Captions much different than todays films.",1510358400,,597,4.4363636363636365
8378328,5,B002R2FE28,I saw this on TV circa 1966 as a small kid and it made a real impression. Periodically I'd look for a DVD of it and finally got one (ordered it from Britain) a couple of years ago. Glad to see it on Amazon Prime and I just finished enjoying it. I can only echo the very well written reviews above.,1507334400,2,297,3.8852459016393444
8378329,5,B002R2FE28,"Extremely well done. Taught drama, well written and well acted. Makes its point without reverting to the smug, preachy, tone of so many more recent films and dramas. Gripping to the end.",1505952000,2,186,4.84375
8378330,5,B002R2FE28,"So far all the reviews here are 5 stars... with good reason.  Everything about this film is well done: the direction, the acting, and especially the writing.",1505520000,2,157,4.814814814814815
8378331,5,B002R2FE28,"This is a film I had never heard of but took a punt at a local bootfair and ended up with a boxful of DVDs from Renown. I'm gradually going through them and so far, each one has been a black and white extravaganza, remastered to the highest quality.

A superb court room drama takes place after four teenagers are arrested when a night-watchman at a garage is found murdered and cash is taken. In 1962, things were very different to what it is now as the defence counsel fights to prevent the accused from the ultimate punishment, arguing that murder for passion is treated more lenient than murder for gain. The trial itself is a white knuckle ride of claim and counter claim.

Under cross examination, both suspects and witnesses give different accounts of the events leading up to the crime. With the clever use of two different cameras to give the story from both the prosecution and defence perspective, it will keep you guessing right up until the superb twist at the end. The prosecution witnesses all view the defendants as 'that sort' and label them as Teddy Boys. First impressions don't count for much when one witness claims a character called by the defence is indeed 'that sort' but turns out to be a priest. Have they just instilled doubt into the jury? Meanwhile the defendants come across as nice boys all with good jobs who happen to be on a night out.

Robert Morley is brilliant as the defence counsel and Richard Todd (on his way down the acting ladder) is a laid back prosecutor who thinks it's in the bag. The first 15 minutes of this, for the time, surprisingly lengthy film, is merely scene setting and it's not until Morley gets the disinterested accused in a room that the film takes a stunning turn. All stalwarts of British cinema at the time, most of the witnesses, defendants and court room staff might not be people you can put a name too but you'll certainly know their faces. As a sop to encourage a teenage audience, singer Jess Conrad is one of those in the dock, as is Dudley Sutton and Ronald Lacey. All were supposed to be teenagers but Sutton was actually 29 at the time and Lacey 27. As another concession to the younger market, The Shadows perform the incidental music.

Social melodrama at its best.",1465430400,3,2242,4.555831265508685

8378333,5,B002R2FE28,"This is a neglected gem of British cinema from the early 1960s. It tells the story, through flashbacks, of the trial of four teenagers who are charged with committing murder in the course of a robbery.

The film gives us a glimpse of working class London in 1962, and it raises social issues such as: inter-generational conflict; stereotyping; social class; and the inflexibility of the law. It also shows how the same events can be perceived and described differently by different people.

But most of all the film is an intriguing courtroom drama. Are ""The Boys"" guilty or not guilty?

Phil Webster.
