8027458,5,B0002F6AMK,Rene Harrop ties beautiful flies that match the hatch where ever mayflies are food for trout. This is a repeat buy in a way since my first copy was vhs. I love the emerger patterns. When trout are bulging on the surface and I see my Harrop pattern coming down the lane and then its gone. Man what a thrill,1520380800,,305,4.1
8027459,1,B0002F6AMK,"Both, the initial purchase and the replacement were mislabeled. The cover claims to be about the life cycle of the Caddis but the contents show how to tie May Flies. Very annoying to have to return to the post office twice to return the same error. I rated it one star because the program wouldn't allow me to comment without rating it. If it were possible I would rate it a MOON [but not of the celestial variety!]. Incidentally, the contents on tying May Flies is very helpful (but I already had that video).",1284163200,,510,4.4361702127659575
