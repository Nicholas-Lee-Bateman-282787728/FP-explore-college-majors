8416601,5,B00008RGZJ,"In high school, I was a BMXer and huge fan of the Road Fools series. When I found out they were doing an episode in my home town, I about lost it. The video is entertaining, well done, and a bit inappropriate at times: perfect for a high schooler. I originally bought this as a VHS. A few years ago, my nostalgia set in and I purchased the DVD for my collection. Although my interest has shifted away from the sport of BMXing, the video is still just as entertaining.

The team makes stops in several of the major cities in Wisconsin, as well as the big skate parks. The tricks are big, the team line up is sound. If you like BMX/Skate videos, you'll enjoy this one a lot.",1352419200,,672,4.1692307692307695
