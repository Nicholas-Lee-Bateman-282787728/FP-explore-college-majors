To be cherished as an ""I'll always remember that movie"" for our kids. Now a days it's hard to find nearly anything that we feel is o.k. for our children to watch and are thankful for all of Mr. Eastman's documentaries, but especially this one!",1379030400,,361,4.484848484848484
3136546,4,B0015054F0,"Good trip down memory lane, back when being an outdoorsman with a camera was the exception to the rule. Nowadays, any human with 2 braincells that touch think they can produce a video. Eastman was the consummate hunter, naturalist and entertainer with his films. I remember seeing this one on a Saturday matinee. I was totally inspired by it.",1361318400,2,342,4.813559322033898

3136548,5,B0015054F0,"The title says it all.  This film is a great collection of footage from times gone by and how things once were.
Great show!!!!",1327881600,,126,4.25
3136549,4,B0015054F0,"Ah yes.  This movie captures the days when a fellow could have his teenage son shoot a massive mountain ram just for the horns and feel proud about it.

Cut down 25 or 30 standing lakeside trees and pride yourself on improving the land for camp.

Catch a dozen or more gigantic 40+"" pike and feed them to the dogs.  ""Catch and release?  What's that?"" might ask the 1960's outdoorsman.  ...and catching large greylings so abundant ""you can catch 50 in an hour if you want""

Seeing an enormous bull moose up close was apparently so common that Mr. Eastman commented that ""bull moose are so ugly they look like they've been hit by a big truck of ugly""

It is almost comical to hear Mr. Eastman lament about how wildlife is disappearing in most of North America, then BANG!! ""Oh Boy, ya got one! Ain't she a Beaute!""

It was neat to see the few remaining natives eating beaver with gusto.  Fire roasted beaver almost looks good, but unseasoned stinky beaver is best had by watching it on film.  Hunger, of course, being the best seasoning of all.  The making of the rawhide boat by the natives was also a very good documentary.

It was also interesting to see the native wife stretching beaver hides on hand made stretchers.  Mr. Eastman mentioned that beaver skins back in 1968 had a value of $40 which which in today's dollars equates to about $400.  Today, a beaver pelt is worth maybe $10.00 if you are lucky enough to find a buyer.

I thought it was also nostalgic to see Mr. Eastman's family living in a huge canvas tent in the wilderness.  I wonder what he would have thought about today's McMansion nylon tents at Walmart for $100.

This movie is as much a documentary of the abundant wilderness of yesteryear as it is a reminder of the attitudes and culture of the 1960's outdoorsmen.  Both have changed and it is fun to see the way it was.",1323388800,3,1845,4.4375

8256801,5,B0015054F0,"First saw this in the mid 90's on VHS. To be able to see it again now on DVD in 2016 was a JOY! If you love the vintage outdoor experience of the classic films as much as I do you will love this. High, Wild & Free is an Outdoor Adventure in a late 50's early 60's time capsule. It takes you back to a time and place that is purer, more idealistic, more romantic than the junk ""Outdoor/hunting/fishing"" videos of Today. Gordon Eastman takes you along on a wonderful ride; truly emphasizing the majesty of nature. Its awesome and no....I don't even know these people. It's just that good. There is really nothing on the market like it. It's a full length movie. It was shown in theaters when it first came out in the early 60's.",1463097600,,726,4.23021582733813

8256803,5,B0015054F0,"Just a fantastic look into the recent past, I thoroughly enjoy this movie!  It can also be found on the American version of Netflix (where I originally found it), but I live in Canada and cannot get it.",1446595200,,202,4.315789473684211

8256805,4,B0015054F0,"I watched this with my Dad when I was 13 yrs old (49 years ago) and I've never forgotten it. I remembered the name and thought of it often in the intervening years. I was very excited to find it on Amazon. It was, indeed, the same movie we had seen so long ago. I remembered the great grizzly that paced the outer edge of the camp, the dogs being frantic with his presence...the old indian, the child sleeping on thousands of dollars of beaver pelts, and making the moosehide canoe. Sadly, it suffered a deletion of one of the most extraordinary outdoor video scenes I had ever seen and was part of the basis of my ordering this. The scene was of a fantastic rainbow that came all the way to the ground only a short distance ahead of them. The father filmed as his 2 boys walked into the rainbow that was so bright as they walked through, they actually faded nearly from sight and they continued behind it until they went over the edge of the rocky crest of the hill and were gone, leaving the view of the intense rainbow still meeting the ground where they had been. It was a photographic ""pot of gold"" that I have never seen since. This is still an enjoyable film and a person without that memory of it would probably like it, but it may be priced a bit high at $24.00, as there are lots of beautiful outdoor films available when you don't have that memory attached to one.",1426377600,,1375,4.272030651340996
8256806,5,B0015054F0,"I am looking for another movie similar to this one. I am not sure it was a Gordon Eastman movie or not but it was done the same way as High, Wild and Free. It is the story of a man that spends one year in the North Country. He goes up and scouts a camp site out the previous year, cuts some trees down to age and returns the following spring to build his home out of those trees. It is just himself and a dog I believe. Once a month or so a supply delivery is made by boat if I can remember correctly.

Any idea what this movie is?",1417651200,,531,3.7410714285714284

8256809,1,B0015054F0,this movie was made around the place where I grew up and I know a lot of the people who acted in the movie it is a really good movie.,1379116800,,133,3.466666666666667
