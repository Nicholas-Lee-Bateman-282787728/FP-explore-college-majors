8518833,3,B007K7ICBK,wonderful story but approach too linear.  every detail is covered.  no original artistic tapestry.  decent acting but could have been better told in half the time.,1382227200,2,163,5.1923076923076925
8518834,5,B007K7ICBK,"If you do not know the film, the title perhaps sends the wrong signals.  It is not a war film.  Great story of family survival told with great resource and imagination and a lot of humor - despite the life and death struggle.",1377302400,3,225,4.209302325581396
8518835,4,B007K7ICBK,"I was recently browsing the foreign movie section of my local library here in Cincinnati and fell upon this movie. I knew this has come out in Europe in 2011, but didn't realize it is now available on DVD here in the US, and I immediately snapped it up. Boy, am I glad I did.

""Declaration of War"" (2011 release from France; 100 min.) bring the real life story of a young couple, Juliette (played by Valrie Donzelli who also directed and co-wrote the movie) and Romeo (plyed by Jrmie Elkam, the other co-writer of the movie). When they first meet and find out each other's names, Juliette exclaims ""is this a joke?"", to which Romeo responds ""no, but maybe we'll have a doomed future ahead of us"". How little he knew! Eventually, they have a son, Adam, and from the start it's an incredible challenge to raise Adam, who seemingly cries non-stop, has trouble keeping foods down, etc. The young couple starts visiting doctor after doctor with little Adam, and eventually they learn the bad news: Adam has a large brain tumor, and everyone is just devastated at the news. At that point we are about 45 min. into the movie. Will young Adam be able to overcome the brain tumor? Are Romeo and Juliette headed for a doomed future? To tell you more of the plot would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to find out for yourself.

Several comments: this movie was a huge commercial success last year in France and several other markets in Europe, and it really surprised me that it didn't get released in US theatres (at least they didn't make the same mistake with a similar-themed French movie ""The Untouchables"" earlier this year). If you wonder about the title of the movie, it is of course meant to convey the fact that the couple declared ""war"" on their son's brain tumor, but the literal explanation is that at one point we hear a news report about Bagdad being bombed and Juliette comments that ""war has been declared"". Kudos to the real-life couple of Valrie Donzelli and Jrmie Elkam, who bring their ordeal to the screen with love and (com)passion. This movie reminded me more than once of ""The Untouchables"". If you are in the mood for a quality foreign movie, I can almost guarantee that you will enjoy this one.",1356825600,,2225,4.5879396984924625
8518836,5,B007K7ICBK,"Very good movie: from a difficult topic, this movie makes a story with love, humor and teaching. Very impressive when you know it is a true story.",1347926400,,146,4.444444444444445
8518837,5,B007K7ICBK,"Embodying the best traits of French film (and every reason I consider it superior to all other film), `Declaration of War' is an astounding feat in modern filmmaking.  Inspired by the actual events surrounding the film's stars (who also wrote and directed this film), `Declaration of War' is a beautifully sincere portrait of one family's strength in the face of the most adverse of circumstances.

On the outset of the film, Juliette spots Romeo (yes, their names) from across the room at a party and they find instant attraction.  They delve into a speedy relationship depicted in flashy scenes of them kissing and running and hugging and smiling and then BAM they have a baby.  Life is wonderful and they are happy and in love and so excited and then reality hits in the form of a brain tumor that threatens the life of their young son.

`Declaration of War' is one of those films that offers a complete package, and few films really do that with such pitch-perfect ferocity.  Not only is this a deeply moving experience, one layered with genuine emotion whether it be pain or joy, but this film is lathered with style that helps elevate every scene.  From the sequences layered in musicality that add a choreographed jovial quality to the humorous theatricality of the family depictions and the playful repartee between Romeo and Juliette, `Declaration of War' oozes with style that feels genuine and necessary to progression of film.  But that style never overwhelms or takes the place of the film's obvious substance.  This is, above all else, the story of a family's struggle to understand and then ultimately cope with tragic circumstances.  Both Valerie Donzelli and Jeremie Elkaim deliver truly beautiful performances as Romeo and Juliette, most likely drawing from their own struggle in a way that makes for a stunningly intimate treat.

One of the best films I've seen this decade; without a doubt!",1340150400,,1910,4.919003115264798
8518838,5,B007K7ICBK,"This was the very first film that I saw at the Sundance Film Festival this year (2012). Let me just say that even though every film I saw there, with the exception of one, was beautifully filmed, edited, and composed, ""Declaration of War"" stood out far above the rest. I saw a dozen films during the festival, and even though this was not a competition film at Sundance, it was by far the best film I saw at the festival, beating out a lot of heavy competition!

At the time that I saw this at Sundance, my wife was more than seven months pregnant, and I was anxiously awaiting the birth of my first child. The depth of emotion explored in this film is beyond any other film which shows the struggles of parenthood. All I could think of the entire time was what I would do in their situation. If my then unborn daughter had to suffer the same trials that Adam went through at such a young age. It was emotionally draining, yet completely fulfilling at the same time.

Now that my daughter is here, I have an even deeper love and appreciation of this film. It has helped me to live each day as though it could be our last together. To enjoy the small moments together. Now that I have experienced the deep love that only a parent can feel, I feel that I have become more connected with the characters.

Full of comedic relief, this film is perfectly crafted in every way, allowing its audience to become enveloped in the rich and heartbreaking drama. Well worth the 101 minutes to watch!",1338595200,4,1486,4.3768115942028984
