7368319,4,B013P0WZSG,I picked this up at a local store as it was the same price as Amazon and I didn't have  to pay for shipping. Anyway the Making of the Mob is well done docudrama on the beginnings of how the Mod started in New York.  If follows Lucky Luciano's and his crew from the early 1900's up to the late 50's. While the drama takes place Ray Liotta talks over scenes filling in details. The acting and production is  good for such a piece. I really enjoyed it. If you like The Men Who Built America then you will probably like this as it is done by the same people. I gave this only 4 out of 5 stars cause the extra features are so short. Each is maybe a few minutes long which was a little disappointing to say the least. Not a deal breaker but you don't get much from them. But if you're interested in how the Mob came to be this is a great entertaining introduction to that world.,1445299200,,872,4.028901734104046

7368408,3,B013P0WZSG,"Even though you learn a lot about how the Mob was made in the USA, I felt something was missing to make this series more entertaining than it was.  Maybe it was the cheesy acting or the over use of CGI blood splatter.  But, there are some interesting stories and facts that you learn about the MOB.  The major problem about this series is that it's just way too long also.  But, if you are interested in MOB documentaries, give this a look but don't spend a lot of money for this series.  There are better and shorter ones out there.",1449100800,,533,4.237623762376238

7368411,5,B013P0WZSG,"Since the classic gangster movie, as well asWesterns, are my favorite film genres, I was looking forward to seeing AMCs docudrama, THE MAKING OF THE MOB: NEW YORK, and, for the most part, I was not disappointed.

Narrated by Ray Liotta, with a cast of talented unknown actors playing Charles Lucky Luciano, Meyer Lansky,  Benjamin Bugsy Siegel, Frank Costello and other legendary mobsters, this rather violent eight-part, one-hour series is totally engrossing, as it relates the saga of the beginnings and rise of the American Mafia from the start of the last century up into the 1960s.

Sprinkled throughout the series are interviews with the likes NYC Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, descendants of both Meyer Lansky and prosecutor Thomas Dewey, Mob attorney Oscar Goodman, actors Chazz Palminteri,  Joe Mantegna, singer Frankie Valli, and various other actors, as well as authors and historians.

Particularly during the beginning of the 1900s through the 1930s, the series delivers an excellent recreation of time and place, but then (I assume) budget considerations forced the producers to cut back in certain areas, such as make-up (e.g. the characters never age), costuming (e.g. characters wear the same clothes for decades) and other areas (e.g. scenes from earlier episodes are repeated in later episodes).  The overall series sticks pretty much to the facts, though there are some minor errors (e.g. the details about Arnold Rothstiens assassination are not quite accurate).

Nevertheless, the AMC series is entertaining and informative, revealing many facts that were new to a gangster history buff like me.

Extras on the two-disc DVD from Anchor Bay Entertainment include additional scenes, plus six brief featurettes that reveal some fascinating details about the Mob that were not in the actual series.
