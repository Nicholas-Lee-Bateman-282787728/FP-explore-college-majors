6230365,4,B00HW3EZZE,"this was a pretty great film, actually. sure, it has its flaws. but its merit outshine them completely. i was happily surprised, especially after reading some reviews. if you liked Amelie, Waitress, Eagle vs. Shark, etc., then i'm betting that this will probably be your sugared doughnut.",1393718400,71,288,5.148936170212766
6230366,4,B00HW3EZZE,"Jay (Scott Speedman) likes to drink, gamble, speed, smoke, and go to strip clubs. Unfortunately, even with an MBA he isn't much good at it. On parole, he lands a gig mopping floors at a mental institution. He also has outstanding gambling debts. His family has money as he goes to New Orleans (from LA) to his brother's wedding. Pressed for a date, he opts to take with him newly escaped mental patient Daisy (Evan Rachel Wood). She is child like and honest. She will say anything to anyone and needs to be protected, the type of girl guys easily fall in love with. She doesn't like shoes.

This is another quirky romantic comedy.  We have entered a downward spiral where each romantic comedy has to be odder than the previous one, regardless how inane the ending or impossible the situation or how awkward they make us feel while trying to make us feel good.

Evan Rachel Wood was delightful in her role, although her scripted character was not convincingly real. Jay is a guy whose character is difficult to connect with, oh poor little rich kid.

The film makes for a good rental for lovers of quirky romantic comedies. 3 1/2 stars

No sex or nudity, although there are some strip joint scenes, they are in bikinis. I don't recall any F-bombs although rated PG-13 for ""brief strong language.""  I may have missed it.",1393718400,55,1318,4.587234042553192
6230367,2,B00HW3EZZE,"Underwhelming English language remake of a hit German language romantic comedy.  A ne'er do well with gambling debts who works in a mental institution as part of his probation saves a beautiful and odd young woman who has recently been committed--in the German version it was from a suicide attempt but in this version it's from the attentions of a perv orderly.  In both versions she follows him out of the hospital without his knowledge and he ends up taking her to his brother's wedding where he plans to ask his wealthy dad for money to pay off those debts.

The original movie allowed some time for the characters to get to know each other a little before he makes the decision to pass her off as his girlfriend in front of his family.  The American version doesn't seem to want to waste any time setting up the characters so it jumps almost immediately into the wedding subplot, which makes it seem all the more contrived and idiotic.

Some critics have dismissed Barefoot as one of those the crazy people are saner than the rest of us movies but that's a complete misreading of the material.  Daisy isn't crazy--she's a (slightly) more real world version of the character Amy Adams played in Enchanted--a complete innocent encountering our world for the first time.  Evan Rachel wood is charming and sweet as Daisy and nearly saves the movie.  Unfortunately there are two very big problems.

One is the male lead, Scott Speedman.  He's supposed to be playing a charming rogue but mostly comes across as an unlikable jerk.  Romantic comedies ultimately rise and fall on the chemistry of their leads but Evan Rachel Wood and Scott Speedman have no chemistry whatsoever, which makes it hard to root for them as a couple.  The other big problem is one of tone.  The original German Barefoot was an urban fairy tale that believed in the trans-formative power of love--by the end of the movie the lead characters end up saving each other through the power of the love each has for the other.  The English language version, on the other hand, is directed with a flat and literal tone that makes it feel more sitcom than fairy tale.  If you ever wondered what New Girl would be like if it starred Evan Rachel Wood instead of Zooey Deschanel Barefoot gives you a pretty good idea.

If you can find it and don't mind subtitles I would highly recommend the original German language version of Barefoot.  This one not so much, but if you like romantic comedies a lot you will probably find this one cute enough to be more than watchable.",1393632000,108,2532,4.628635346756152
6230368,5,B00HW3EZZE,This was a great movie!  You watched the characters change and by the end I was rooting for them and didn't want the story to end. Great acting by all!!!  Awesome storyline!,1393545600,2,173,4.375
6230369,5,B00HW3EZZE,"not knowing what to expect. I  thought I'd take a chance and watch it. I was not disappointed. I'd recommend this to anyone who enjoys just a good, simple, romantic movie.

The movie starts out slow and builds momentum.  the story line is fluid and developed very well. It's a comedy, embarrassing and cute funny.

 all things considered, I liked the movie. I found it heart-warming. I didn't over analyze it or read too much into it. I just accepted it for what it is and enjoyed it over all.",1393459200,4,493,4.433333333333334

i thought the movie has good actors and the ""plot"" was a fun twist of events. the only thing i didn't like was how it seemed the guy had no actual goals. For someone who was extremely sheltered, OF COURSE they'd understand her naiive-ness
to the comments of 'women being sexualized': first off there were 3 scenes overall in the movie where there was a woman not dressed (beginning scene and 2 strip club scenes), and it was the main character's reaction in only 1 of them. and no sexual ACTS in the movie at all, so I'm not sure where they think it is in the movie..and yes, i'm female.",1531612800,2,829,4.253164556962025

6230716,5,B00HW3EZZE,"This is a charming film.  Jay, a floor washer, on parole, thwarts a sexual attack on Daisy, an inmate, in a mental institution.  When he leaves, she follows him.  He tries to convince her to go back, but to no avail.  He then decides to take her back home as his date to his brother's wedding.  Daisy is naive and totally unaware of the ways of the world.  She also is barefoot.  She claims that shoes hurt her feet.

Jay's parents are wealthy and live in a mansion which, at first, overwhelms Daisy. She does, however, put on a convincing performance as Jay's girlfriend claiming that Jay has a lot of great deals that he is pursuing, which his parents are greatly interested in learning more about. When the truth is revealed about Jay and Daisy to his parents, Jay steals his father's prize trailer and takes off on a joy ride throughout the land with Daisy.  Daisy's love for Jay increases with each mile they drive.

This a heartwarming, charming story.  Evan Rachel Wood is superb as Daisy.  And Scott Spiedman is outstanding as Jay.  The supporting cast is excellent.",1528761600,7,1074,4.560209424083769

A cute story about a couple of down-on-their-luck people who meet, he tries to use the her as a front in order to get money from his father, but ends up actually caring for her.

He also is deep in debt to bad men and desperate to find a date for his bother's wedding. We witness him soliciting strippers for this purpose. He is kind of a jerk.  But you still get the feeling Jay is a good guy because he seems at home with the mentally ill. One day while mopping he witnesses a new patient Daisy Kensington being admitted and warns her to be careful of the other residents.  Grateful Daisy follows him out -- making things hard for Jay because he shouldn't have left the door open.  Daisy is very different. She doesn't seem to know anything about the world and is very nieve'. He decides to take her to his brother's wedding. Of course, his family is rich. Everyone is kind to Daisy and she admits to Jay that she ""killed"" her mother.  She tells him how for her whole life she was her mother's caretaker and her mother was abusive to her.  Obviously Jay is taken aback and also his heart goes out to her.  After things go bad at the wedding, the two go on a road trip until they are eventually captured by the authorities. During the trip Jay learns that Daisy isn't necessarily mentally ill and is likely just suffering from PTSD.  And happy ending ensues.",1527465600,,1344,4.3694779116465865

Light-hearted overall and sweet with some real life drama just enough to make a story without bogging you down in it. Her child-like nature and natural beauty is so alluring to so many men and here you understand why that is since you like her yourself so much.

There are many reviews telling the story, but they leave out the music from Nick Drake at the end. Nick Drake was a beautiful (mentally troubled) musician who took his own life, but I digress.

6230852,3,B00HW3EZZE,"This movie is actually a remake of a German movie of the same name and with the same main ideas.

As such, it is serio-comic in that it makes comic uses of the situation (a girl who, having been raised in isolation ended up institutionalized) meeting a man whose wealthy, uptight family considers him a manipulative misfit. The theme of the story is obviously one of how they heal and transform one another, each making the other whole. If that's a spoiler for you, you need to get out more.

The movie's ""serious"" aspect is, of course, the unreality of the situations they get into many of which have no good or pleasant real-world resolutions but, being a comedy and not, say, a crime-drama, it all works out in the end.

It isn't the smartest movie ever made nor is it the best, nor the best-acted but it's a good thing to watch with a friend of the opposite sex on a rainy afternooneven a friend you're married to.

That's my review.",1484784000,,937,4.430232558139535

6233127,1,B00HW3EZZE,"This movie is a great example of why I quit going to the movie theater.  I don't even know why I watched all of it.

Barefoot is like any generic romantic comedy, except that it isn't funny.  Maybe it was meant to be a drama.  Spoiler alert from here.

Unlikely boy meets unlikely girl. They go through stuff, fall in love, live happily every after.  Scott Speedman plays an irredeemable jerk. Evan Rachel Wood plays an abused girl/woman who has been committed to a mental hospital.  Most of the movie, he's taking advantage of her.  It was pretty ick.

I also found it hard to suspend disbelief.  He's broke, and suddenly he has money.  He is wanted, but he uses his credit card all over the place.  Wow, no one in 2014 could ever find a way to trace that.  He steals a rare RV, yet he outruns the police and they never get caught.",1461888000,2,832,4.290322580645161

6233509,5,B00HW3EZZE,"I didn't knew that this was a remake of the German film and honestly I don't care that much.
The reason I chose this film was because of the main actress Evan Rachel Wood who was in the movies like <Thirteen><Upside of Anger>. I saw those movies and instantly fall in love with her.
I was so surprised how much she's been changed in this movie. Maybe her divorcement, maybe bacause she is aged now and becuase she needed to look younger for the roll. She was in this thick makeup and her face looked swell.
Anyway, all that things were covered with her beautiful acting. She acted like one of those Disney charactor, innocent woman just came out from the cartoon who knows nothing about the real world. It is because she never been in school and her mother kept her at home. According to her she is even a virgin. She never even met a man who can love.
When she saw her mother's death and cann't help her from dying, she thought that she killed her and the institution guy misunderstood her and puts her in a mental hospital where she meets Scott Speedman who has problem and he serves at the hospital working as a cleaner at the mental hospital for his misbehavior and there he meets Rachel.
He sees that Rachel is a bit childish and maybe he can use her. He asks her to pretend her to act as his girlfriend while bringing her to his house.
Scott Speedman actually is from a wealthy family and his parents mistrust him since he makes all kinds of bad things. Borrowing mob money and all.
So they go together to his parent's home. They become really close.
This is the point where we cannot but to fall in love with Evan Rachel Wood all over again. She was so pure, cute natural beauty.
On the other side, Scott Speedman was good and charming as well, but he was kind of inside the shadow becuase of Evan. Scott if I may describe, is Bradley Cooper kind of clone guy.
Anyway truely a good actor competes with her talent, not with her face or body. She did just that.
Her smile, her expression, her way of talking, makes me love her.
The ending was a ver happy one and make us all feel very good.
If you want some movie that make your evening just feel so good, I think this is a hidden little movie you should grab.
I am so sad that this movie didn't make audiences' attention that much.
Evan Rachel Wood is now 29 and I honestly don't know why she married so early with Jamie Bell.
Hope she will regain her fame soon.",1458345600,,2418,4.258695652173913

6235076,5,B00HW3EZZE,"this movie captures something that so many people are aware of everyday but not really focused on.....everyone is on some level, a candidate to be considered crazy! so everyones crazy but nobody really cares, all that really matters is wether or not you're productive, because if you're productive you're a genius no matter what, or excentric, but if you're not productive, then you're unstable of unable to function or incapable of something else, basically if they think you don't work properly according to whats important to everyone else, then clearly you must be broken somehow..........i just clung to the beauty of the fact that she wasn't truly crazy, just a mystery to everyone and scared of everything, and curious due to being so sheltered, like a newborn, new to the world, she pretty much was......and the man, of course hes just a screw up to everyone, but he too was a mystery, had  to be, considering no one knew what he really felt when he did the things he did.....and what did they do about not understanding him or having a written confession, what people everywhere always do of course, they made up their own mind about him and passed it off as answers, the same as starting a lie and spreading a rumor, only difference is productive people were doing it........im sure this is not what the intended main message of the movie was, ultimately i see a lot of real life unfortunate circumstances in which a random link in love occurs, much the same as real love does in fact happen, and to me this movie is a way to keep hold of hope, because life wouldnt matter at all without love, and even in the darkest of times and most unlikely moments, love can really still happen for literally anyone, anywhere, it can start by a dumpster where you throw away your shoes at a truck stop because that bathroom was so much worse than you expected and you really don't want that smell in the car, and you just happen to catch someone looking at you funny while you get barefoot, n just cant help but notice that those are the most hypnotic eyes youve ever seen, and both of you absolutely cannot leave that spot without heading in the same direction with one excuse or another to start a conversation.......so this movie is hope and miracles and of course LOVE",1451952000,8,2270,4.604938271604938

He begins as a thoroughly independent, non-committed guy whose world involves a strip-club and being a janitor at a psychiatric hospital in Los Angeles.  She is a patient in the hospital, having spent her entire life as a prisoner in her home, kept by her psychotic mother, whom she thinks she has killed.  Completely delightful, she follows him out of the hospital, barefoot, and appeals to his better nature to stay with him. He needs someone to pose as his girlfriend when he attends his brother's wedding, and to get money from his wealthy father to pay overdue gambling debts.  Afterwards, he tries to dump her a couple of times, but by this time he cares for her and cannot.  Viewers need a little suspension of disbelief in relation to the plot, but Evan Rachel Wood makes this a delightful film.",1449100800,2,946,4.703030303030303

From a Man who didn't give women a time of day to a man who grew and learned how to treat a women.  Rachel Wood's character grew as well from a very sheltered life to a young lady figuring out her place in this world.  And the Romance blossomed between them because they 'grew up' together.

Boy was I in for a shock when with each scene I became more and more attached to the idea of ""what's going to happen next""! Even though I wasn't on the edge of my seat the characters somehow really make me care about their individual situations in life. I was able to easily empathize with the two main characters. I think the emotions and situations explored in this movie are quite authentic. There was a simplistic ease that truly captured me. After it was over I knew I had to write a review. If only in my own way to continue in the moment of the movie somehow. If you're looking for a movie about flawed people looking for a way out only to bump accidentally into what could be a better future within their grasp then give this one a try!

It would be nice if life did end up as this movie ended.",1446249600,,242,4.878048780487805
6235774,4,B00HW3EZZE,"Well acted, but there are some flaws in the writing.  Most of those can be easily overlooked, but the one that I had trouble getting around was the movement of Scott Speedman's character from careless playboy to a guy truly in love with a mental patient.  For Even Rachel Wood's character the transition was flawlessly written, and beautifully acted.  Scott Speedman acts all the key moments wonderfully, but for the last half of the film the viewer is still left wondering how Speedman's character got from the last scene focused on his feelings to the current scene.

Overall, this was a good movie, with subtle, but unmistakable jabs at the state of our ""Me me me"" society, which I appreciated.  This movie is enjoyable on a number of levels, providing a nice couple hours of entertainment for a wide range of viewers.",1446249600,,821,4.753521126760563

I really like the male lead in this, a really good, likeable cross between Hugh Jackman, and a touch of Seth Green.  The female lead did an excellent job; her role wasn't an easy one to portray with belief.  She didn't over or under do it.  A great script, a great plot, and a love story at that.

spot on). The complex character growth is natural and relatable. The
directing, soundtrack, musical score, writing, & the plot as a whole
made me leave the movie feeling the emotion of love.

I just happened on this movie while at home sick. Though it
is not a complex movie, it does not need to be in order for most people
to relate to one, some, or all of the characters. This movie touched on
most emotions. Throughout the movie I laughed out loud, cried, was
angry, tense, disappointed, stimulated, & relieved. A sign of a well
scripted movie (in my humble opinion).

This is the feel good movie that you seek out to watch that will make
your day better. It is a well rounded romantic comedy! The Perfect date
night movie for those that believe their love is a little crazy; whilst
the world's view of it is crazier",1445990400,,887,4.503105590062112

Evan Rachel Wood's character is a child-like, naive woman who had a schizophrenic mother who never let her leave the house, so she is doe-eyed and simple, experiencing much of the world for the first time in a humorous and sometimes awkward, and other times uncertain and scary world. She was amusing and at points, a sympathetic character. The love story that the movie turned into has been done to death a million times, and it could have become something much more interesting and deep if it had avoided that trite and cliched direction.",1442275200,,778,4.770370370370371

SPOILERS.

A young woman, Daisy, is committed to a mental hospital. The doctors ""assume"" that she is schizophrenic ""or something"" and give her pills, but they don't bother to really find out what may be wrong with her. It comes out at the end that her mother was the schizophrenic one, who heard voices, and raised her in isolation, but taught her to read and play Scrabble and watch TV. Daisy believed that she killed her mother, but her mother just died in her sleep. What kind of doctors could not figure this out immediately? The guy, Jay, was able to figure it out after talking to her for a few minutes. If Jay did not tip the doctors off to the truth, Daisy could have been committed for life.  Are you kidding me?

Jay has a filthy rich family who has disowned him. Although he has an MBA, he is working as a janitor, mopping floors in a mental institution while on probation. He owes forty thousand dollars to the mob, who threaten to kill him if they don't get their money, and yet they just leave him alone.

Daisy simply walks out of the mental institution. Again, are you kidding me? Jay runs off with her, takes her on a plane when she has no ID, and they go to a wedding, an amusement park, diners, drive around in a stolen vehicle, all with no money, and eventually (by the time that you no longer care) get caught. At one point, Jay almost abandons Daisy in an airport, leaving her sitting alone for hours without shoes, not knowing where she is or what to do and confused and frightened, and they call that love. At another point, Jay lies down on railroad tracks so that he can get committed to the mental institution just to see Daisy again (and how can he expect to be taken to the same institution on the same floor with the same doctors, and yet he does) and this is supposed to be humor.

There is an abrupt happy ending, and I was left wondering how I watched this whole mess without falling asleep.",1442016000,5,1998,4.328877005347594

6237122,4,B00HW3EZZE,"I'm not one for ""romantic"" movies, but this Rom-Com has EASILY become one of my favorite movies! I watched it 3 times in just as many days. Finding love in a mental institution is not an oft presented preface, so I loved that about it. I took a star away because of some oversights between writing and editing, however they weren't so big that they'd ruin the movie. I don't want to throw out any spoilers, so I can't state what those flubs are. They should be easy to spot in the movie when you watch it. All in all, a lighthearted, albeit initially DYSFUNCTIONAL love story, with mostly subtle humor, (as opposed to the slapstick or crude humor that we're used to in recent movies of this genre.) It's a film reminiscent of ""Splash"", (with Tom Hanks & Daryl Hannah): charming and covertly innocent...with just the right touch of dirt bag. After all, it's NOT a Disney cartoon.

6237253,2,B00HW3EZZE,"I could not swallow:
 - an almost whimsical approach to child abuse
 - the wisdom and sweetness of a character who was raised without ever seeing, let alone experiencing, either
 - the instantaneous turn around in the father of the main character merely because the mother said he had also been reckless in his youth (really!?! had he also frequented strip bars, dated exotic dancers, owed a loan shark thousands of dollars due to bad gambling debts, tried to bilk his father out of the money to pay off his debts with a fake money making scheme, stolen a vehicle, etc.?  And all of this is immediately forgiven without the two even discussing it?
 - a mental health professional who forgives all - including taking a committed patient out of the hospital on a road trip, providing alhohol and dope to other patients, etc. all in the name of love

I could go on, but this is enough to give you the flavor of the movie.

6237295,5,B00HW3EZZE,"This movie was a great little hidden gem that had comedy, drama and romance. A story of a young man lost trying to find his way, misunderstood by his family and meets a young girl misunderstood by people as she is admitted into a psychiatric facility. Scott Speedman is a great actor and this character compliments him very well. I love quirky little hidden finds that don't get a lot of promotion and become all time favorites of mine.

6237330,3,B00HW3EZZE,The movie has a sweet theme. The reason I only gave it 3 stars is it had a strip club in the beginning. The young woman in this flick has been isolated from society for her entire life. The first intro to life influences her in what I think should be skipped if a teen or preteen should watch this movie. I hope this review helps with parental guidance.,1438214400,,353,4.130434782608695

In both movies, people with supposedly more insight into life project their perceptions onto the characters in turmoil.  Ironically, how you perceive them yourself will also reveal your outlook on life.  More recent cousin is ""Our Idiot Brother""--if you can relate, then you know whether you belong with this family (of flicks).

6237506,3,B00HW3EZZE,"I like short movies, but it's when I watch movies like this, I realize why some movies become 2+ hour features. This movie moved quickly but was lacking in explanation and depth.

Spoilers below:

Jay, a largely unlikeable character, finds himself in debt to people in unsavory places and risks his probation because of dumb decisions. He has a job as a janitor in a psychiatric hospital that he has to keep or he'll automatically violate his probation. His debtors discover that he has a wealthy family and suggest that he use them to cover his debts. Fortunately, Jay's brother will soon be getting married, and Jay seizes this opportunity to ask for money. One of the many flaws in his plan is that he told his mother that he has a girlfriend, a nurse, that doesn't exist.

Enter Daisy, a new patient at the psychiatric hospital. Raised in isolation by a schizophrenic mother, Daisy appears odd but relatively social. She follows Jay out of the hospital and he takes her as his date to the wedding. Some things go well and others don't, until things fall apart when Daisy has a panic attack at the wedding.

Jay and Daisy head back towards the hospital, and despite efforts to leave Daisy behind, Jay cannot. They crash the RV that they stole from Jay's dad, and ultimately Jay is arrested, but it becomes clear that the pair is meant to be together. Jay's dad breaks down and bails him out of jail and after some other key events, Jay and Daisy (who is not crazy after all) leave the hospital to be together.

Back to the review:

I enjoyed watching this movie but I found some scenes moved too quickly, while others dragged. The fact that nobody questioned Daisy until after some time with Jay's family was questionable, as she was clearly acting strangely. And the fact that Jay's debtor was able to find him when he was in the institution was questionable as well, even with the situation proposed by the movie.

I did enjoy watching this but was left feeling somewhat unfulfilled - did Daisy and Jay make it work? Did Jay get a new job? Was he able to stay out of jail? How would Daisy assimilate herself into the world? And how did they get on a plane - did Daisy really have the ID needed for that? I was left wanting more along the way and by way of resolution.

The acting was good - my friends said that Scott Speedman came off as a poor man's Bradley Cooper - although I wanted something more from Evan Rachel Wood, as she came off more shallow than I feel like Daisy should have.

If you have some time, watch this movie. It's definitely more drama than comedy, but it was enjoyable and not stressful, and I don't regret watching it in the least.",1436659200,5,2661,4.458847736625515

6237564,1,B00HW3EZZE,They could hold the camera still and the scenes were well framed and properly lit but they needed some kind of script or idea of what kind of story they were trying to tell. When they had a joke it would look like a feeble attempt at a comedy. When they ran out of jokes it appeared they were trying to make some kind of drama. When that didn't work they would try to come up with a joke or cliche drive-across-Texas-in-a-camper or a-tired-dumb-traffic-cop scenes that had no relevance to where ever it was they were going. Don't judges the actors [they were consistently flat and unbelievable] because neither Evan Rachel Wood nor Scott Speedman had nothing to work with.,1436400000,,672,4.608333333333333

6237693,3,B00HW3EZZE,"For a film that barely made $11,000 at the box office, Barefoot is a sometimes sweet, almost feel good movie with a low chemistry mix of Evan Rachel Wood and erstwhile teen heartthrob Scott Speedman,  who though mutually damaged, embark on an odyssey to and from his brother's gilded southern wedding in New Orleans. The only catch is that Wood has been sprung from a mental hospital in Los Angeles and Speedman, though a black sheep heir of a very wealthy family in the Big Easy,  is escaping the wrath of some very unsavory loan sharks in the City of Angels. Throughout the film their banter is alternately forced and at times genuinely touching but the story itself and the countless plot holes that it needs to navigate make whatever redemption is to be had, trivial and small.

While Wood has made a career out of playing the otherworldly misanthrope, her take on Daisy veers from Sissy Spacek's weirdly out-casted Carrie to Isla Fisher's clingy psycho girlfriend in Wedding Crashers -  sometimes from line to line indicating a lack of proper direction or character focus. On the other hand, Speedman for all his overflowing charm is there to play protector and interpreter of the outside world much in the manner of Tom Cruise's turn in Rain Man - it's occasionally fun to watch but it never quite clicks. And, we won't even wade into how these two very WANTED  ""fugitives"" easily elude the authorities and hide in plain sight as they drive a one-of-a-kind vintage motor home through the southwest. It was also a shame to see the very talented Treat Williams and Kate Burton so thoroughly wasted as stick-figure southern patricians trying to give it a go as Speedman's parents. Special notice should be given to the always wonderful JK Simmons as the grousing and obnoxious hospital psychologist.

Make no mistake this is a very mediocre film that has a few things going for it, two earnest, hardworking leads and a sometimes poignant script that keeps you from bailing out halfway through.",1434585600,,1996,4.80466472303207

The main characters acting as a naive girl, isn't stellar, which is irritating, however the rest of the cast does an ok job. All of the acting feels like script reading, but there are a few moments, especially by the mom, the movie feels more engaging.

I can't tell if it's just bad acting, a bad story, or bad directing - either way it falls apart and comes off ridiculously stupid. There are some cringe worthy parts, like Wood's slipping back and forth between acting like a child complete with a baby voice and a grown woman. I know that she's supposed to be not all there, but being emotionally disturbed doesn't account for an annoying baby voice.

6238198,4,B00HW3EZZE,"Okay Barefoot is a chick flick. And I am a sucker for romantic comedies, especially good ones. And of the good ones Barefoot is without a doubt to be considered a member. In case this review appears somewhere readers may see it, and is read  I will not say anything about the story.

Barefoot represents, who I think, is the main character, Daisy, who rarely wears shoes.  I say think Daisy is the main character  because the male counter part, Jason, might be considered the main character. Yet I view his as a supporting role. Nonetheless, that being the case the story moves along by the activities of an ensemble of two. They complement each other. In a way this movie could be viewed as a buddy-road-trip movie.

Evan Rachel Wood has lifted her character from the written page and has made Daisy her own. Jason, her male counter part, Scott Speedman, demonstrates so much understanding and gentleness toward her. Because of that his character is endearing in spite of his being responsibility-challenged -- guess that would be irresponsible. Speedman performs his character well. So with both actress and actor performing well it makes for a good story.

 The ending suggests all will be well for these two. In an unexpected way Dasiy and Jason are soul-mates. And as luck would have it, or as fate would have it, they encountered each other so as to be together and each is the better person because they are together.",1430956800,2,1424,4.717741935483871

6238232,4,B00HW3EZZE,"Surprisingly great.  It started badly, but they had to set up his terrible character so that we could grow to love him as he changed.  Evan Rachel Wood was beautiful from the start - inside and out.  Very touching movie.  Sure, the ending was unrealistic, but aren't most romantic comedies?  I'd definitely recommend this movie.

This is one of the films where you can still get in touch with and be reminded of the innocent/childish/wild side of the inner self; the nature that we were born with but has been oppressed/hidden due to the adulthood responsibilities and social pressures.

6238371,5,B00HW3EZZE,"I don't really write reviews on movies, though I used to write them on books. But, that's neither here nor there. I watched this movie just because the trailer intrigued me. And I'm incredibly glad that I did. It made me smile and warmed me up. The tagline says it all: They're The Perfect Mismatch.

Redemption. Sometimes a person just needs someone else to show them the way. Jay... is a jerk and a loser. Everything he does is for Jay. Period. As the movie started I wondered how he would or could be totally redeemed. He's a schemer, but there are parts of him that are truly kind... even if that kindness isn't your everyday, typical, expected type of kindess. In one single moment he does something extraordinary for Daisy, and she basically follows him home like a lost puppy. And from that moment on she starts changing his life in ways that are not typical, but somehow, they just work.

I loved Daisy. She's a pure soul who got dealt a raw hand, and yet she finds wonder in everyday things most of us take for granted. Evan Rachel Wood was amazing in her portrayal of Daisy. It's not easy to pull off as complicated a character as Daisy, but not only did she, but she... charmed me.

This isn't your typical Romance. There are moments that are incredibly poignant and moments where you can't help but laugh or smile because of some completely unexpected comment made that almost startles the laugh out of you. Definitely worth the watch. Going on my list of favorite chick flicks to make The Hubs watch with me... he has a sly sense of humor too.",1429747200,,1556,4.471830985915493

Evan Rachel Wood was superb in her role as the naive mental patient.  Very believable.  One couldn't help but hope they could make the relationship work long term.  The contrast between a guy who had everything and turned away from it, and a girl who had nothing and didn't know of anything better was stark, and what they learned from each other was the core of the story.",1429142400,,687,4.2384615384615385

There was nothing new about the story of the rich rebel falling for an unlikely person who doesn't fit the stereotype, except she is exactly the stereotype for people who don't...fit...the...stereotype.

The movie just feels like the same movie told five thousand times by Hollywood already, and it is getting old!  The characters' attraction and development simply don't make sense, and we didn't care enough to watch the actors try and force their way through a predictable script again.  It felt like Benny and Joon with a few minor tweaks that simply didn't work.

In the movie's defense, we didn't finish watching it, since the first hour was so painful that we shut it off.  It's possible that the story, acting and script turned around at the end.  Unfortunately, the movie wasn't interesting enough to sit through the last half of the film...",1428105600,,952,5.031847133757962

6238698,3,B00HW3EZZE,"This fillm had a lot of problems with the situation it sets up in terms of Scott Speedman's character, a certified loser with too many marks against him to make it plausible for him to be a reasonable match for the adorable mental patient he somewhat inadvertently hooks up with. it doesn't help that Evan Rachel Wood's character, the said mental patient, isn't what anyone, even herself, thinks she is. Nothing about that gels in any particular way, and the ending leaves you wondering if the scriptwriter just didn't want to deal with the several hundred details that make it  impossible.

All that aside, I enjoyed this movie. Wood and Speedman work some small miracles with their interaction, which often had me believing this was a better film than it really was. As long as I didn't dwell on the implausibilities, I had fun. Gotta give it three stars for that.",1427500800,,866,4.728476821192053

So many things should either be completely omitted or expanded on, yet it never happens, and the movie just keeps lazily breezing along seeming completely unaware of the its surroundings. I picture an uncoordinated bear happily rolling through the woods destroying all in its path. One thing after another unfolds that would so obviously not happen in real life yet the story blows past those moments as if nothing happened at all. It simply requires you imagine and fill in huge gaps of illogical plot sequences and character traits to make the events seem possible yet unnecessary to get any further into.

6239199,3,B00HW3EZZE,"For a really good review, see the one posted by Joe Smart.  The concept of the movie is that a girl in a mental institution escapes and ends up with an orderly from that institution as he travels to a family wedding to ask for money to pay off his gambling debts.  Although the girl acts ""weird"" (goes barefoot) according to modern day standards, she brings a sense of sanity to the craziness going on around her. The only one who seems to have a problem with any of her behaviors is the orderly with whom she is traveling. It may not be as good as some romantic comedies, but I would watch it again.",1425945600,,600,4.208695652173913

It says ""rom-com"" in the reviews/summary, but I didn't experience comedy, more a story of working through selfishness, pride, and self perceived importance.  From the head physician at the mental health facility to the male lead and his strained parental relationship.

It is a romantic, beautifully told story that is very well crafted, perfect casting, sensitive but not overly sentimental and at the same time offers wacky laugh out loud humor. One of the best films I've seen about mismatched couples who change each other's lives for the better. I especially recommend to fans of romantic comedy.

6239466,4,B00HW3EZZE,"This film really surprised me.  It failed most of my criteria for choosing an entertaining flick from among the slush pile.  But they say you shouldn't judge a book by its cover or a film by its tagline (I mean really?  ""They're the perfect mismatch,"" give me a break.)  But, my wife and I wanted something comical and this had the genre ""comedy"" in its description, so we gave it a shot.  We were not disappointed.

The acting was reasonably good and the storyline engaging.  We found ourselves invested in the characters.  There were no preachy overtones and a reasonable amount of conflict.  As a result it kept our interest from start to finish and we found ourselves smiling at the end (I won't spoil it.)  So, yes, this earns our thumbs up.

I noticed that the production company was called ""Barefoot,"" so I'm thinking this is the breakout film for the company or director or both.  If so, I think that it is an excellent start and I hope they continue.  On IMDB it looks like Andrew Fleming, the director, has three other films to his credit, none of them blockbusters.  I saw ""The Craft,"" it was nothing to write home about.  Barefoot is much better.  He was the consulting producer of some episodes of the TV series ""Grosse Pointe"" which didn't last long.

All in all, I think most people looking for a romantic comedy who watch this film will not feel like they wasted their time, and if Mr. Fleming makes more like it, you may be happy that you saw it.",1425254400,,1463,4.460377358490566

Perhaps the best thing (for an in-ambitious movie such as this) is that the storyline keeps moving...with the exception of the Bus Stop scene, nothing is dragged out (ala SNL) for effect. Wood is radiant in her role and Speedman doesn't screw up. Kill two hours, good enough.

He's a rich kid who has failed to measure up to the family standards.  Although we are supposed to believe that he's really a good guy underneath it all, he consistently shows a complete lack of judgment throughout the film.  He has failed because he's quite immature. While she has been committed to a mental hospital, we are supposed to believe that the Rachael Wood character is just very nave because she has lived an isolated and dysfunctional life with a mentally ill mother, whom she supposedly has killed.  Really???  She's really a princess just waiting for her prince to break the spell?!?  I just cannot suspend my disbelief long enough to swallow this shallow tale.",1425081600,,825,4.767605633802817

What you end up with, though, is less humor and silliness than the traditional rom-com ... and more to think about. The characters are on the run from themselves and, in the end, find each other.

6240279,3,B00HW3EZZE,"but you can't. This sort of film has been done before. ""Benny and June"" and ""Rainman"" come to mind quickly, but they were much better movies. This one has its heart in the right place but it misses by a long shot.

Here's the scoop. Jay Wheeler (Scott Speedman) is a ne'er-do-well living in L.A. He's from a rich Louisiana family but here he is, on probation, mopping floors in a psychiatric hospital, running from a lone shark, and bedding pretty much any pretty girl he can get his hands on. A young girl (Evan Rachel Wood) is admitted into the hospital as a possible psycho or schizophrenic. He saves her one night from being raped by a guard and, through a small series of events, ends up taking her to Louisiana for his brother's wedding. The road is long and winding.

This is Stephen Zotnowski's first script and it shows. He just doesn't have the chops to pull this story off. It needed to be much more clever. There are any number of times the two runaways find themselves in a dicey situation and the way they get out of them is just not to be believed. And, as much as Speedman tries to pass her off as his girlfriend to family and others, it just doesn't work. Anyone should see at a glance that she's not all there. You know where this is headed and Zotnowski doles out small tidbits of information to change what we know about the characters but it seems too pat. They are building blocks which pave the way to their being able to have a normal life together.

I like Speedman. He has a good camera face and is a decent enough actor. I haven't seen Wood a lot but she couldn't pull this off. The character was not well written enough for her to find the center. Treat Williams is Okay as Speedman's dad but there isn't enough for him to chew on. J.K. Simmons is Okay as well but there isn't anything here you haven't seen him do before. The music score was pretty good and dusted with some nifty indy type tunes.

This doesn't hurt to watch but it will make you long for similar films that were done much better.",1422921600,4,2026,4.309711286089239

Characters are better, more charming (even with the hassle of reading subtitles), the story (to me) is more real.  I really liked the German version, but this one is just a disappointment.

Sadly, to me, this movie is typical Hollywood taking a swing at an idea that they didn't come up with, and kinda ""phoning in"" the effort. Think of ""Dance with Me""; if you've seen the American version AND the Japanese version, you'll know what I mean.
The story is essentially the same as the German version, but the details that change the flavor of the movie to ""American"" are:
The main character got fired from a strip club for giving some guy a lap dance (ooo-kay, that sounds reasonable)
The main character is a high-stakes gambler who racked up a bunch of gambling debts, (so now we have porn and gambling)
The main character assaults the Bookie's collector-thug (now it's porn, high stakes gambling, tough guy)
The main character is on probation (tough guy, gambling, porn, crime)
...one cliche after another.

Definitely see the German version ,but don't waste your time on this (American) version

Son of wealthy father, who is sort of a prick, is the black sheep in the family...even though he has a masters in business!  Got into trouble and on probation...but we don't know what for. Has a job as a janitor in a mental institution. Owes a loan shark some money.

Sees young girl brought into mental institution. Then sees one of the slime orderlies in her room at night making unwanted advances and punches him and leaves. Girl follows. Says she wants to go with him. Doesn't like institution.

His brother is getting married, and he has lied to father saying his life is good and he has girlfriend. Father then challenges this not believing him, saying to come to wedding with girlfriend. So when nutty girl wants to go with him, he says..OK.

As they go, she seems very kind, smart, and innocent...having been raised by schizophrenic mother, and kept from social situations.
She catches up fast. They start to like each other. His family likes her because she is frank, and nice.

He is in trouble, they think he took her from institution. Cops catch him and her. He convinces doctor that she is not nuts. They get together and go off happily.",1405814400,,1248,4.675799086757991

6240381,4,B00HW3EZZE,"Barefoot is basically, a self-centred guy grows a conscience and actually starts to care about someone else type movie. Similar in a way to the fake father character and his journey in We're the Millers.  That someone else is Daisy, a woman in her mid-twenties/thirties I guess who up to a few days before, when she asked her postman what she should do with her mother's corpse, had lived a life of isolation from the rest of the world, where her mother had told her all kinds of nonsense, such as driving a car will get you pregnant.  The postman conversation has ended up with her now being in a mental institution where our self centred guy is working mopping the floor as part of his parole terms.  She knows of him simply as Mop Man.  However when he's clocking off one day he overhears someone claiming to be a doctor obviously about to rape her and violently intervenes. She follows him out the door.

Mop Man or Jay (played by Scott Speedman) has problems of his own, he's in debt to loan sharks and needs to con his rich family at his brother's wedding into giving him enough money to pay the debt.  He had planned on hiring a stripper to pretend to be a nurse he met at work to help with that plan. But being an unlikeable guy, (although we have seen glimpse of him caring about the patients and treating them as friends at the institute,) even the strippers don't want a thing to do with him. So his only solution is to try and pass Daisy off as the nurse.

Barefoot is a feel good film that keeps you glued simply as Daisy is such a likeable character (superbly acted by Evan Rachel Wood). She has a very childlike innocence about her, is eager to please and cares so much about those she comes in contact with, such as a little girl dropping flowers.  You care about her as the events proceed and sort of want to protect her yourself.  There are huge plot holes in the film, such as police seeming not to have CB radios (or even their own mobile phones) to radio other officers.  But because you care so much about the Daisy character, you sort of let those slide and not get in the way of the journey. Speedman does a pretty good job in his role too.

If this film had been a bit more successful I think the old restored campervan (RV) would have become a classic movie vehicle as well.",1404172800,,2300,4.300925925925926
6240382,5,B00HW3EZZE,"Barefoot starring Scott Speedman and Evan Rachel Wood is a quirky and sweet drama. I've had a huge crush on Scott Speedman since his days on late '90s drama, Felicity. He's easy on the eyes, his voice is whisper soft, and he's highly underrated! In Barefoot, he stars as Jay, a janitor at a psychiatric hospital who's also a troublemaker. Jay comes from a wealthy family but he's not the most responsible man and he acts without thinking. While working, he meets Daisy played by Evan Rachel Wood. Daisy is a new patient at the hospital and Jay forms an unexpected bond with her but there's a catch. Jay is looking for a date so he can attend his brother's wedding in New Orleans and he's running out of women he might possibly take to ""show off"" in front of his family, and that's when he decides to take Daisy along and she pretends to be a nurse he's currently dating. Along the way, we learn the truth about Daisy. About why she ended up at that hospital and so on and so forth. And who knew Evan had killer, comedic timing!? She's very funny as Daisy, all wide-eyed and innocent but with enough spunk to pull off the amazing one-liners. I also thought Speedman and Wood have wonderful chemistry together especially during the carnival scene. This film is beautifully directed by Andrew Fleming. I've seen some of his other films and he's a great, gifted director. I highly recommend this sweet coming-of-age, indie flick. Enjoy! Oh, in case you were wondering why this film is called Barefoot, Daisy looks to walk around barefoot - she hates wearing shoes. Silly girl.",1404000000,,1572,4.597864768683274
6240383,3,B00HW3EZZE,"Trigger Warning(s): Mental Illness depictions

Despite not reviewing a lot of Evan Rachel Wood productions, I must say that I am quite the fan of hers. If just because each of her characters have an interesting angle to them. For while some of her movies certainly are boring, she presents herself as a sort of silver lining. With this film though, she plays a character which has the persona of a troubled Disney princess who meets her would-be prince who is far from a knight in shining armor. Leading to the question: is this another one of those films in which she is the silver lining, or is the film good as a whole?

Characters & Story

The films primary focus is on Jay (Scott Speedman) who is the eldest son of a rich southern family. Now, despite Jays MBA education, and his privileged upbringing, it seems all he has ever been was the rebel without a cause. So, to distance himself from his last major blemish on the family name, he moves out west and ends up getting in trouble with not just the law, but also the mob. But with his younger brother getting married, and Jay trying to seem like he has his life put together, there is a need to show that he has even began the process of settling down. Enter Daisy (Evan Rachel Wood) who is a new mental patient at the hospital Jay works at. They mutually take advantage of each other and somehow find love between putting up a ruse and trying to deal with the police in pursuit of both of them.

Praise

As usual, Wood presents herself as a highlight and presents Daisy as this kooky, but likeable, character who despite being rather simple does have some complexity. For while she does have this Disney princess persona, because she was sheltered all her life, abused by her mother, and pretty much is a weirdo, at the same time you can see her grow as she interacts with Jay. And through him she starts discovering, bit by bit, what it means to love someone, and deal with challenges that come with someone being your whole world while you are simply a part of theirs.

And the story as a whole, while certainly not the best, it does keep things interesting. Something which leads Speedman to deserve some praise for while perhaps not the most charismatic, he plays a decent enough love interest to Wood to at least make their relationship something of interest for the film.

Criticism

With all that said though, I really do feel that me being a fan of Wood was the sole thing that kept me interested in this movie. For one, Jays whole backstory really feels underdeveloped. Be it his issues with the mob, why he is on probation, and I also felt like there should have been more to his issues with his dad than lost money. Then, even with Wood, there is sort of a double-edged sword to her character. For while I like the whole Disney princess persona, at the same time it does make you wonder, based off characters Wood has played in the past, why would she play someone like this? For while Daisy arguably can be complex, on face value she comes off so simple it sort of amazes you that she is even capable of half of what Jay asks of her. And honestly, as cute as her ditzy ways can come off, at the same time I can imagine Woods performance possibly leading to some rolling their eyes.

Overall: TV Viewing

As I watched this I thought I would label this as Worth Seeing. However, as I wrote the review and really thought about the weak aspects of the film, I felt the need to downgrade it. After all, with Woods performance being the highlight, but not one which has universal appeal, it makes this hard to recommend as worth seeing. So, because of that, I think this is simply a TV Viewing type movie. For while I liked Daisy, the underdeveloped background of Jay does put a hamper on things, as well as Daisy perhaps being too simple.",1403827200,,3805,4.415121255349501
