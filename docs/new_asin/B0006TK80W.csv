8644002,5,B0006TK80W,"Though I've watched this movie from a Christian Station I can honestly say: I give this the highest rating possible.
And I would highly recommend this movie even though it seems to be only on VHS and not on DVD.
And I can also recommend the main actress in the lead role; Michelle Trachtenberg to give an admiral role in the story.
Enjoy this movie from Amazon, the only place I've been able to, find it.",1517097600,,404,4.328947368421052
