7897168,3,6305907625,"There's some nice animation here, all of the same style, and some very imaginative pieces. The style is quite basic, though well done, and only a few works really made me think. Nice for a rainy day, maybe, and generally kid-safe, but there's a lot of competition for space on my finite shelves and this isn't the strongest competitor.

7897169,4,6305907625,"If you remember the Maxicat cartoons from the PBS series ""International Animation Festival"" from the mid-1970s, you will be pleased to know that five of those cartoons are included on this DVD.  The other cartoons aren't bad either, if you like the ""Zagreb style"" of animation, which is so refreshingly different from the American cartoons you may have grown up with.  (up with which you may have grown?)  I just wish the running time was longer.",1251849600,,446,4.842105263157895
