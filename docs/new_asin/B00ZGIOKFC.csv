8720102,5,B00ZGIOKFC,"I love these videos.
The City Mouse and the Country MOuse go on adventures and share what they see and learn. They meet famous inventors and artists, visit historically important areas, experience history and have a great adventure in each show.

We watched these with my young children and they learned a lot. I was then able to remind them of the show when we started studying history in our homeschool and that gave them a chance to remember what they already knew.

The characters are mice and this show is directed to young children. However, the mice do not talk down in this show, but rather educate and explain. The language and the show is gentle and kind and generally a great show.",1478736000,2,692,4.57258064516129

8720104,5,B00ZGIOKFC,"I like this cartoon, it has to be one of the best cartoons you could watch as a kid. It's got everything, mystery, adventure, action, history, seeing Alexander and Emily travel all over the world to visit family members while going on adventures together, you would see what the world was like all over from over one hundred years ago and what it was like back than. It's like going back in time without a time machine and without going back in time. I like how this cartoon has so much history, it's like traveling the world without leaving home. I'd recommend this cartoon to any kids.",1455235200,,587,4.4953271028037385
