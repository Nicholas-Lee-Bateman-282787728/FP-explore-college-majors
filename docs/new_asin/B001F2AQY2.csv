The music CD that comes along with it is a little tedious to just listen to, but if you're dancing along, I can see how it would be great. The DVDs are fun to watch, but hard for me to follow along. This isn't really beginner level, although I had the impression it was.",1353888000,,345,3.942857142857143
8300612,5,B001F2AQY2,I really like this video a lot!  I am a 49 year old Zumba instructor and have many dance fitness videos.  This is definitely one of the better ones.  Vanessa has a lovely personality and is a great instructor.  Her directions are easy to follow and you'll be doing the samba in no time!  My only complaint is that the video goes by too quickly.  I almost wish that there were more dances included.,1250553600,3,397,4.297297297297297
