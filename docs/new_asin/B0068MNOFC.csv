4978600,5,B0068MNOFC,"Bought this DVD instead of helicopter tickets before our trip to Kaua'i - the camera work is PHENOMENAL - well worth the price.  We'd have loved more Hawaiian music, but what they offered was great and we thought the narration, especially from the various park rangers was really nice.  If we had a complaint we were sad that they did not show the Kalaupapa side of Moloka'i or even mention it - but there is so much to Hawai'i and it's hard to expect it all to fit on one DVD.  If you love the 808, miss ""home,"" or just want to be absorbed in the beauty of the Islands, this is the DVD for you.  Splurge on the blue ray -- it's worth it!",1333238400,7,638,4.08
4978601,5,B0068MNOFC,"I saw this program on PBS and am now purchasing it.  A wonderful film.  I lived on Oahu for 6 years and am in Hawaii in my head every day.  The program shares the aloha spirit of love, respect, care for nature, and beautiful music.  I enjoyed the narration by biologists, geologists, rangers etc.  Actually, I only saw the end, so I'm looking forward to seeing the entire program.  I can even see in the program the continued development of embracing the native culture, which was almost eradicated by Christian missionaries (that's island politics) in the use of the Hawaiian language on a broader basis.  I'll be purchasing the sound track also and albums by the musicians.  I'm breathing easier and moving at a slower pace just by enjoying this dvd.  No ka Oi.  Aloha nui.",1333152000,6,775,4.632352941176471
4978602,2,B0068MNOFC,The scenery was very nice but the choice of music and narration did not live up to expectations (the series Visions of Greece and Italy set the standard in this type of fly over travel experience). Thought the best part was at the end when they show the women performing a traditonal dance and that was cut short.,1332633600,,313,4.413793103448276
4978603,5,B0068MNOFC,The quality of the aerial photography in this DVD is high and watching it is the next best thing to actually taking a helicopter flight.

4978643,1,B0068MNOFC,After 10 minutes I had to turn it off or throw up.  Nice visuals but really bad soundtrack consisting of unpleasant Hawaiian music and really insipid remarks about how Hawaii is 'perfect' endlessly repeated..  Yuk. I returned it.,1468195200,,229,5.0

4978655,5,B0068MNOFC,"My father is born-and-raised Honolulu and has been living outside Hawaii for a decade. When he saw a re-run of this on TV, he entered nostalgia for weeks after so I got this for him as a surprise. He loved it! While most (if not all) of the footage-type is available on YouTube, getting a compilation of such clips on disc is perfect for someone like my non-tech loving father who wants to do what he knows and just sit back and narrate the who, what, where, when, and whys of every location to anyone willing to listen. Also decently priced and arrived on time.",1465689600,5,562,4.3619047619047615

4978678,2,B0068MNOFC,"Purchased for husband who has visited Hawaii often.  He was disappointed because the producers seemed to leave out a lot of what makes Hawaii an attraction.

Most of the views are from helicopter, and while it was a little disappointing to me that it did not offer options to switch to an all-music feature (much talking throughout, but very interesting and educational) and that it felt a little short, it was definitely a pleasing video that exhibits a lot of what it seen in Hawaii from a mostly bird's-eye view.",1426118400,,523,4.758241758241758

4978765,4,B0068MNOFC,"It looks great and sounds good! A very good introduction from the air of the major islands of Hawaii.

Image quality (*****). The video really does look very, very good -- first class aerial visuals -- excellent cinematography. Occasional terrestrial and underwater scenes, while not in keeping with the title, are brief. 1080i.

Audio quality (***). The two channel audio is pleasant and clear. A 5.1 mix would be welcome but is not present. I wish there were multiple audio tracks as the narration could be wearing on repeated viewings. And while I appreciate the talking heads, their inclusion limits alternate audio tracks. Alternate tracks of traditional and/or contemporary Hawaiian music (Raiatea Helm, IZ, or other great Hawaiian favorites) -- sans narration, would be a welcome addition. Also, a closed caption option would be beneficial for the hearing impaired.

Length. I wish it were longer. Its brief 55 minutes does not outstay its welcome. And good luck trying to read the closing credits!

Extras. An interesting six minute perspective from the film's helicopter pilot. That's it. Period.

Packaging. Just to be picky. The cover does not need that yellow box in the upper left. And the ""In High Definition"" tagline looks superfluous (Blu-ray is synonymous with HD and DVD is less than HD) and stuck on (just looks tacky). Taking out those two items would make for a cleaner, more attractive look. This is a combo pack --  a BD and an unneeded DVD. Once you see the Blu-ray, the DVD is a coaster.",1417392000,,1512,4.933070866141732

I have to say that I was disappointed with the video quality of the $25 video of our own Blue Hawaiian Helicopter Tour. The custom video isn't high-definition. This ""Over Hawai'i"" video, on the other hand, is extraordinary, a visual treat.",1397174400,,520,4.371134020618556

4978818,5,B0068MNOFC,"This DVD is a beautiful landscape of the marvelous colors of all of Hawaii's fantastic islands.  The views and photography are absolutely breathtaking, taken from a helicopter and surpass anything anyone can see on the ground. You will explore the Big Island, Maui, Lanai, Molokai, Oahu, and Kauai individually as you hover over craters, landscapes, parks, valleys, mountain ranges, rain forests and seascapes.  Along the way, beautiful Hawaiian music plays adding to the enjoyment of the DVD.  Your journey is about an hour long but full of delightful vistas and will make you want to rush to your computer to book a trip to these glorious islands.  I recommend it highly for historic, geographic, great photography and general information on the Hawaiian Islands.",1378080000,9,765,5.195121951219512

4978821,5,B0068MNOFC,"I've been to every Hawaiian island except Lanai--multiple times.  I've traipsed around on all sorts of hiking trails and I thought I had a good idea of the way these islands looked.  But there's a lot more to be seen--even if an ultralight aircraft is required.  We get to see valleys that you just can't get to without some serious effort.  The biggest surprise to me was Molokai.  The coastal areas of that small island feel much more tame than its neighbors.  But from the air the interior is a whole other experience.  I must give credit to the producers for not allowing the colors to be over-hyped.  If you've never been to the islands, there's no better way to see them.  If you've already been, you'll be booking a return flight as soon as the BluRay comes out of the player.",1377216000,5,783,4.457746478873239

It's our new goal to get back every 3-4 years....would live there if I could afford it.  For now, visits will have to do.  The DVD captures the best of all the islands....just incredible.

4978829,3,B0068MNOFC,A fairly ordinary attempt on publicising Hawaii as a travel destination. As a travalog it fails miserably. I would not have bought it had I have been able to view it first.,1370822400,2,172,4.40625
4978830,5,B0068MNOFC,"This was also a great DVD on seeing the Hawaiian Islands.

We thoroughly enjoyed it.",1370563200,2,255,4.183673469387755
4978831,3,B0068MNOFC,"The aerial footage is beautiful, but the commentary and captions are distracting and give it the feel of a Hawaiian tourism promotion video.  Even the music leaves a lot to be desired.  I wish the captions were smaller and relegated to the corner, or that there was an option to turn them off altogether.  Overall, the price was reasonable and the helicopter footage is really nice, so it's a keeper for me.",1370390400,3,407,4.625

4978838,1,B0068MNOFC,lots of views of the islands that can only be seen by flying over.  really not worth the money did not overfly the big resorts  I feel most people watch this type of film so they can say that is where I was,1364947200,,206,3.7674418604651163

4978846,1,B0068MNOFC,We were so disappointed in this overview of Hawaii.  They showed the same landscape type on all four islands.  Poor,1360627200,,115,4.7
4978847,3,B0068MNOFC,"I was excited to watch this disc after catching of few minutes of the Tv version. Unfortunately when projected onto a super large screen the video deficiencies are more apparent. I also did not care for any of the music. I do not want to see a person strumming and singing crappy Hawaiin music when I watch a nature video. I only want to see nature. Overall it had some nice shots but I wish it was $5 instead of $15. I also bought over Alaska (for $5) and can say I liked that better overall than this production. Not bad, but please keep your expectations low as this in nowhere near the quality of the Planet Earth, Life, or Frozen Planet series.",1360281600,5,649,4.284552845528455

4978851,5,B0068MNOFC,"Considering the amount of video a Blu-Ray disc can accommodate, I wonder why the producers chose to only include an hour of material. Having been a bush pilot in norther Canada in my younger years I've always enjoyed the main perk of the job - the view from the front office. This DVD offers a similar experience. As the helicopter pilot in the video remarks - people who have lived in Hawaii all their lives don't know what's further back there in the valley at the end of the road. The music & narrative contribute to the seductively hypnotic sway and fro of the aerial photography and beckons one back to the islands. Great product - I wish the spell was longer cast.",1357603200,3,670,4.455284552845528

4978857,3,B0068MNOFC,"My other half and I planning to go to Hawaii in the near future and was excited to see it finally arrive in the mail. Literally when they say Over Hawaii, that is what this film is all about. It takes you to places mainly only seen by air. It will have you definitely want to take a helicopter ride.",1349049600,,299,4.0

...It has some of the finest aerial videography of the islands I have ever seen, and goes into some really nice details about different aspects of the history and unusual topographical features of the islands.

4978866,1,B0068MNOFC,"WOW... this was not what I had expected at all on a video about Hawaii.  It's broken down into chapters for each particular Island, and they use the same verbage to explain each Island.  By the time you get to the last two...you will find yourself fast forwarding.  You can only look at the weather station and the base of volcano's so long. I have seen quite a few Hawaii DVD's and decided to buy this because of the Blu Ray filming.
 The Helicopter tour that they supposedly use for filming is NOTHING like the actual Helicopter tour that you would go on if there on vacation.  Whomever they used for the background music needs to take some lessons.

Watch the PBS one (for free) on Hawaii, if you really want an entertaining video. Another really good free one is the State of Hawaii by the Aerial America series on the Smithsonian Channel.",1338076800,9,843,4.477124183006536

4978870,4,B0068MNOFC,While not complete and somewhat disappointing on certain islands there is enough to justify the price tag.
