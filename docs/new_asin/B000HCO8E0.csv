8138542,4,B000HCO8E0,"Peach DVD has a good reputation for entertainment and this DVD delivers as promised.  The premise of the title suggests that you'll be overwhelmed by a multitude of large-breasted women.  For my money, this wasn't always the case with the girls involved in this video, but it still didn't turn out at all bad.  I'm a huge Akira Lane fan and she was my favorite, but there was another girl in here by the name of Sophia that wasn't too shabby either.  Very nicely done.",1323648000,,468,4.470588235294118
8138543,4,B000HCO8E0,"The title of this dvd suggests an emphasis on large breasts.  Peach has produced a few dvds featuring all natural breasts.  This isn't one of them.  Full frontal and rear exposures generally are good, though Peach has done somewhat better with the latter in other dvds.  One plus is the near absence of tattos and the body piercings I dislike.  (See below.)  Generally, with Peach you know what you usually get and don't get.  All told, this is a pretty good effort.  If you generally enjoy Peach dvds, you should like this one.

Personal preferences:  I very much prefer normal breasts to fake ones.  (I really don't mind breast implants that have a semblance of normality to them, though I prefer real breasts to fake.  I really dislike the circular and flattish kind that I find grotesque.)  I don't care for a lot of tattoos.  In terms of body piercings, I rather like navel piercings, considering them decorative.  However, I consider tongue, nipple, clitoral and labial piercings to constitute self-mutilation and find them grotesque.  I consider the best Penthouse dvds to be the gold standard in soft core.  Peach comes in second followed by Playboy and Vivid.",1252713600,5,1168,4.847715736040609
