1. Daffney's Not So Great Escape

2. Willie's Best Friend

3. Day of the Juniors

4. Dr. Strangesnork's Bomb

5. Who's Who

6. The Silly Snork

7. Battle of the Gadgets

8. Little Lord Occy

I wish Hanna-Barbera would release Snorks by season rather than creating a survey of episodes. The transfer of the episodes are decent but can be a little fuzzy.",1164931200,,416,4.44
