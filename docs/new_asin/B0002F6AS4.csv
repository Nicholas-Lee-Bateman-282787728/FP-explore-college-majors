8027550,1,B0002F6AS4,"As a fan of Sybil Danning's erotic presence in films such as Blue Beard, Julie Darling and Playing with Fire, I decided to give French Pussycat a purchase, especially as the only review posted here on Amazon at the time was extremely positive.
 Now I feel I must add my own view as there are yet more glowingly positive opinions of this movie.
 Sorry, but this inept flick has all the erotic charge of a rotting sex toy. Miss Danning is to my taste just not alluring in this picture, but she's not alone. The picture quality is poor, but the real disappointment is the overall lack of sexiness on show, due to a lack of artistry, primarily from the director, production and lighting personnel.
 I'm stunned that the other reviews here seem to rate French Pussycat 5 stars as if it were a classic of erotic cinema, I could not agree less. Even the awful Howling 2 features a sexier Sybil than the one on display here.
I have reviewed two better examples of erotica on DVD, here at Amazon, take a look at my reviews for Images in a Convent and Red Nights of the Gestapo and decide if I know what I'm writing about, before you decide to buy this less than chic cheapie.",1239840000,3,1166,4.364055299539171
8027551,5,B0002F6AS4,"Sybil Danning, one of the best looking women ever born, stars in this European sex comedy.

Basically the plot evolves around a girl who takes a bet that she can get a philandering sex-advice columnist to propose marriage to her.  She takes a job as his maid/housekeeper and proceeds to flirt with him as the most outrageous tease of all time.  While all the other women, and there are a few, are throwing themselves at him in a quest to be his current crumpet, Sybil lets him get as far a groping privaleges, but no further, tormenting him endlessly.  On those rare occassions when she is wearing clothing, she (Sybil) still manages to be half-naked.  Her poor victim remains dazed and confused through most of the movie.

It is basically an excuse for young women to run around with little or no clothing, but it does have a plot, and, although it is no cinematic masterpiece, it is well enough done to be genuinely funny and engaging.  Even the bad dubbing doesn't hurt too much.",1166486400,18,982,4.577142857142857
