2653760,3,B000I8OMDU,"First let me state that I am an Atheist. I watched this movie with my wife, who is trying very hard to convert me. This movie didn't do it (nor would anything else for that matter).

The acting in it is on par with a 'B' movie, but doable. As far as just a movie, it was ok. They really didn't try to go too far out on a limb on justifying god, or Jesus.

I have to be honest though, the parts of the movie where my wife cried, I was laughing (internally, didn't want to upset her). The movie skips all over the place, and at some points is really disconnected.

The real laughable moment is at the end when his father somehow comes to the conclusion that God does exist because he witnesses the Northern Lights.

My wife said that she thought the story was based on real events, so we waited to the end of the movie to see if this was true. (I highly doubted this.) Well, the end came, and sure enough, fiction. Not surprised at all.

Anyway, I guess if you're a Christian, you would enjoy the film. If not, you might get a laugh or two. But probably not.",1191196800,3,1056,4.082125603864735

2653763,5,B000I8OMDU,"As another reviewer stated, the lead actor was also the film's director and producer and he did a fine, fine job. And yes, it's true that this was a low-budget Christian movie, but...

It was also very well done and well acted and completely engaging. And, unlike some of the other Christian flicks I've seen (such as the ""Left Behind"" movie), you don't have to check your intellect at the door to immerse yourself in the movie.

It's a nice blending of quantum physics and metaphysics and the things of God. (And lead character ""Gene"" offered the best explanation of ten dimensions that I've ever seen on screen.) The religious message was certainly present but it didn't hit you over the head repeatedly with a 20-pound sledge hammer, as some of this genre like to do.

On a different note, it was also an interesting keyhole peek at what can happen when grief takes over and runs away with our lives. And, it also presented a realistic portrayal of our judicial systems' clumsy and inept handling of elder case issues. Ick.

And best of all, there was no foul language, no violence, pornography, or exploding cars. Perhaps that's the reason this well-written, small-budget flick hasn't sold a kajillion copies.",1177027200,25,1213,4.7894736842105265
2653764,4,B000I8OMDU,"Director/writer/producer/editor David de Vos stars in this film about Doug, a man with a failing flight school business and a stressed out marriage, who one day gets a call telling him that his biological father, who he has never known, wants to see him. The State authorities say the father is not competent and should be institutionalized, but Doug decides a different fate for him.  The film centers on this relationship, and it is often touching, and will be appreciated by anyone who has taken care of an elderly parent.

Victor Lundin is excellent as Gene, the eccentric father, whose house looks a little like the shack in ""A Beautiful Mind."" Also good is Frances Black as Abby, Doug's wife, and they have a good script to work with, that is often thought provoking.  ""The Theory of Everything"" is a 2006 very low budget production that holds its own and is always entertaining. It has Christian themes but no one will ever be able to say it is ""preachy,"" and shows that Mr. de Vos has a lot of talent in many areas.

His nearest relatives inherit responsibilty for him, knowing nothing about him and even less about science. The young family's lives are completely disturbed and disrupted.  When he is unable to continue to care for himself because of his health and mental disease,  there is intervention.  The question is.........is he really ill, or insane?  Is his ""work"" trash to be thrown out or genious ahead of his time?  Who do you call to find out???  I found the film touching,  The questions are never really answered, but at least someone made an attempt to explain ""everything"".  Maybe Hawkins was not the first, just the first to be recognized because of his relatively normal personality and being in the right place at the right time.  Is there genius that has been missed?

2653827,3,B000I8OMDU,"THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING revolves around a young man named Doug (David de Vos) and the relationship that grows between himself and a man named Gene (Victor Lundin). Doug is a pilot and the owner of a flight school. His school is doing well, but some delayed payments threaten to destroy his thriving business. He has been spending so much time at work that his wife Abby (Frances Black) feels neglected and spends most of her time eating junk food and watching soap operas. A few weeks for Christmas, Doug receives a telephone call informing him that his biological father wants to contact him. He agrees to meet the man whose real name is Eugene Holland. Gene was a former award-winning scientist who became a hermit after the death of his wife, Doug's birth mother. Gene has been spending the past thirty years working on a ""theory of everything"", a theory that unites all the mathematical and physical theories of the universe. Gene is very close to succeeding, but he needs help. Unbeknownst to Doug, Gene is dying and his request for help is his attempt to finish his masterwork before he dies. The movie attempts to show how close Gene is to finishing his work by displaying Doug using Gene's mathematical and scientific theories to economics to win money from new financial supporters for his flight school. Gene misses his deceases wife dearly and feels that if he can decode the theory of everything, he will be able to open a doorway to heaven itself where he longs to see his wife. Doug is a Christian who thinks that what Gene is missing is faith in Jesus and lovingly tells him so. In the meantime, Doug's half-sister threatens to ruin everything by having Gene committed for mental instability.

Though it's not initially apparent, THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING is a Christian movie. What that means is that a sermon (though not one in church) is contained in part of the movie and there is a ""come to Jesus"" moment where a character makes a declaration of faith. This isn't a bad thing, but viewers should be aware of it. Those moments are handled more believably in THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING than they usually are in Christian movies. The ""sermon"" isn't very preachy and the character's conversion is one that actually seems natural.

David de Vos does a good job as Doug. He also directed, wrote, and co-produced the movie. Victor Lundin gives the best performance in the movie. I enjoyed watching the scenes he was involved in the most.

I understand the confines of low budget, independent filmmaking. However, even taking that into consideration there are some obvious flaws to THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING. The story is actually fairly good, but the way the story is told isn't. There are gaps in the movie that wouldn't have been so awkward with a little more explanation. For instance, Doug was an adopted child but the word ""adopted"" is never really mentioned, it's hinted at but never spoken. There are other parts of the movie that don't make much sense. The biggest being the reappearance of Doug's half-sister. Towards the beginning of the movie she agrees to give up any responsibility or relationship she has with Gene. Then she suddenly reappears in a dramatic fashion towards the end of movie where her husband batters Doug's daughter in the presence of a couple of police officers. Conflict is essential for any good story, but it should be conflict that actually makes sense. In all honesty, her reappearance was unnecessary and the story would be smoother and more coherent without it.

The other major flaw of THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING was the cinematography. During most of the major conversations in the movie, some of the smaller ones, and many of the movie's key moments the camera revolves around the characters over and over and over. The technique is supposed to give the viewer a sense of omniscience, but it is overused in the movie and made me dizzy at times.

Despite these flaws, THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING is a movie that many will enjoy. It's a movie with a strong message that has no sex, foul language, and minimal violence so families will probably enjoy watching this together. It's also not as preachy as most Christian movies. With a decent script and good acting from the movie's leads, I wanted to really enjoy THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING, but I only found it ho-hum. The gaps and nonsensical moments of the storytelling grated on me and I found the oft-used circular use of the camera to be annoying. Personally, I think the movie is a good effort, but one that doesn't meet its potential.",1296000000,4,4532,4.738910012674271
2653828,1,B000I8OMDU,"*possible spoilers* :-P
This movie ranks up there with all of the other movies that individual little groups think they can produce and pull off but can't.  The story isn't smooth at all and moves in so many different directions.  The husband is adopted, but they don't come right out and tell you, they leave it for you to guess.  You see his adoptive parents once in the beginning of the movie, but never again.  Aren't they at least a little bit concerned about the biological father contacting their son?  The wife is shown constantly watching soap operas to the husbands disgust, but they never discuss her addiction to them.  The husband and wife fight constantly with hugely over exaggerated fight scenes and screaming. (think Fireproof)  There is a wicked step sister but nobody does anything to challenge her fight to parental custody or liquidating the old man's assets.  The old man constantly shows up in his front yard holding a gun and shooting at whoever is in his yard.  The whole story is about this old man who is living in a warped reality and thinks he can prove scientifically that God exists.  So during the entire movie there are equations rattled off at speeds so fast you can't even figure what he is talking about.  None of it makes any sense.  I don't know why people have rated this movie so high.  It is one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time.  And I wish I would have known it was a cheap low budget film written and directed by the actor who stars as the husband himself!  It was boring, slow and not worth the money!  To the person who said there was no violence, uhm hello, there was the old man shooting at everyone in his front yard~ and not just once, but also there were numerous instances of the family arguing and yelling!  A terrible movie by Christian standards!",1277596800,11,1815,4.484756097560975
2653829,4,B000I8OMDU,"The Theory of Everything"" is a wonderful Christian film.  The film is inspiring, heartwarming and though-provoking that by the end of the film, you will in no doubt feel touched by it's powerful message.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""The Theory of Everything"" is featured in 1:78:1 Anamorphic Widescreen.  Picture quality looks slightly compressed as you will notice some compression artifacts and for a 2005 film, the PQ doesn't look as clear as I would have hoped.  There is a fine layer of grain which is fine but for the most part, picture quality for the film is good.

Audio is presented in Dolby Digital English and also Spanish and Portuguese Stereo. Dialogue is clear and can be heard clearly through the front channel speakers. For those with a modern home theater receiver and setup will probably want to have audio settings on stereo on all channels for a more immersive soundtrack but overall, audio is clear.

Subtitles are in English, English SDH, Spanish and Portuguese.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""The Theory of Everything"" comes with no special features but trailers. I wish there was audio commentary or some sort of special features, especially to know how David de Vos was inspired to write this script and also the inclusion of the science behind the film for the character of Dr. Eugene Holland.

JUDGMENT CALL:

I was very pleased with ""The Theory of Everything"".  I found it to be quite heartwarming and inspiring.

I was surprised to see find out that David de Vos, producer, writer and director and also playing the main lead but also to find out that de Vos also has experience producing and writing for Hollywood specials for popular TV shows such as ""Beverly Hills 90210' and ""The O.C."" and as an actor, his main roles were extras in films such as ""Pearl Harbor"", ""Posers"" and ""The Island"".  But what de Vos was able to create was a magical film that will definitely touch the hearts of many people who have question if God was real and using science to justify if Heaven truly exists. A storyline focusing on the scientific and religious aspect could have been complex but overall, it was well-done (granted, I am not knowledgeable about the scientific things that Dr. Holland speaks of but I'm leaving it up to de Vos that he did research that aspect for the film).

Victor Lundin did a tremendous job playing the part of Dr. Eugene Holland and seeing his character so full of energy and eccentric as a scientist but also this crotchety man who goes gun crazy if anyone nears his property.  But most of all, the viewer witnessing this man who was provided with this intellectual talent and his fear that he is losing it due to his brain disease.

As for the film as a whole, acting for the film was not exactly spectacular but I am assuming that with the multiple roles that de Vos took part in the film, that the film was more than likely created with a very low budget (unfortunately, I was not able to find out how much the film actually cost).  But I suppose when it comes down to the more emotionally driven and more important scenes, that is where the talent of the film actually do shine.

The film is not rated, so for those who plan to watch the film with their family and children, there was one or two scenes that did catch my attention and probably a scene that I wasn't expecting for a Christian film was  when the Holloway family are trying to protect Gene from the authorities and Doug's step sister Delilah went after his estate.

The scene features de Vos's daughter Amanda trying to protect her grandfather and in the process, Delilah's friend slapping her in the face and seeing the daughter fall to the ground. With so much noise and seeing Doug nearly lose it and the crying baby and personally, I felt the scene was surprising but it made the film much more real.  So, I'm glad that David de Vos didn't sugarcoat the scene.  Also, it's important to note that Dr. Holland is one of those crotchety neighbors who will shoot anyone who comes near his property with a shotgun and in the beginning, he does try to shoot warning shots at Doug.  I can understand if those two scenes may be upsetting to parents but if you plan to watch this film with the kids, its important to at least parents know that those scenes are in the film.

But ""The Theory of Everything"" is an enlightening and enjoyable family film.  From the challenges that exists within families (especially during these economic times where parents tend to focus so much in providing financially for the family and not enough time with them) and if one can keep the faith, they can overcome those challenges.  I thought it was absolutely cool how the family aspect of the film was handled and how the Holloway family reached out to Gene and within their time together, making sure they spent quality time even though they don't have much time due to his degenerative brain disease.

The DVD for ""The Theory of Everything"" was originally released by Triumph Marketing back in 2007 and this 2010 re-release from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment doesn't feature anything else new but the trailers and perhaps the additional languages and subtitles.  So, if you are looking for a version that includes Spanish and Portuguese language (and subtitles), then this DVD re-release is for you!

If there was one major disappointment that I had towards this new DVD release was the lack of any special features.  This is one of those films that you wish there was some sort of audio commentary included.  I would have loved to hear how David de Vos came up with the story, the challenges he had to undergo by taking on the multiple roles as producer, director, writer and playing the main character of the film, directing the confrontation (between Delilah and her father) segment of the film, him working with the various talent and discussion about the ending scene as well.

Overall, ""The Theory of Everything"" is a wonderful Christian film.  The storyline is not too banal nor is religion forced down the viewer's throat.  Also, I have to say that among the Christian films that I have seen thus far, ""The Theory of Everything"" is among the more enjoyable ones that I have seen.

I found the ""The Theory of Everything"" to be quite inspiring, heartwarming and though-provoking and by the end of the film, you will in no doubt feel touched by it's powerful message. Definitely recommended!",1264464000,3,6375,4.6708407871198565
2653830,4,B000I8OMDU,"This is a very interesting movie about a physicist, who is reaching the end stages of his life, trying to finish the proof of everything.  The movie brings out a lot of scientific facts which are very fascinating (especially to a Math major like me!) and really  makes one think about the universe and God and creation.  The actor portraying the physicist did an excellent job of his role.  What makes the film lack substance is the more or less deflating ending and the lead character being so flat.  The movie gave him several close-ups of his face in an attempt to show his emotions but his face never changed all throughout the entire film.  He always seems to be in a perpetual smile.  So, bear in mind that it is an independent film, and so not as well done as Hollywood films.  But at the same time, dwelling on a more interesting topic than found in typical Hollywood shows.",1214870400,2,882,4.46875
2653831,4,B000I8OMDU,"Insightful Christian movie that inspires one to think about God, dimensional thought, relationships and our place in the expansive universe. Although the production is low budget- this fictional story is quite good. It contains a charming illustation of the beauty and complexity of creation and a non-confrontational salvation message.
 ""The Theory of Everything"" mentions string theory and explained it in a way that even my 10 yr. old could understand. This movie stimulated her so much that it was all she asked for as a Christmas gift.",1199664000,5,540,5.206896551724138
