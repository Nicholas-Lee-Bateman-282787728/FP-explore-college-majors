2383955,5,B000AARKYY,"The Winx Club Vol. 2, all I can really say at this time, and til it is released is, I am so happy and so looking foward to this! The Winx Club Magic always continues with this Vol. 2 and I am sure the others are on the way as well, I also would love to see vol. 3 and vol. 4 and so forth come out as soon as Vol. 1 to Vol. 2 came out as well.

 The Winx Club Magic is really impressive, and I like alot of other fans love it and say to the creators, please always keep these Volumes comming.

2384076,4,B000AARKYY,"Me and my niece enjoy watching this series together.  The only down side was that I thought this was the Nickelodeon dubbed version and it was actually the Rainbow/4Kids version.  Don't get me wrong it was still entertaining to watch and I recommend this series very much but the difference in voices is somewhat disconcerting when you have to try and explain it to a child.  My other complaint would be that you spend fourteen dollars per volume to make up the series and in the end you end up paying more than the cost for the other seasons.  I also wish that this came in closed captioning.  I am hard of hearing and having to play it at extremely loud volume and stopping to play back parts that I didn't catch are nerve racking.  Just about everything comes in Closed caption so what does this not??
I was pleasantly surprised to get my order processed and shipped out to me so fast!!  Faster than is usual with Amazon.

2384083,5,B000AARKYY,I received an advance copy of this set and it's spectacular and is reasons.  I can tell you having only gotten to see a few episodes of the series total that the show itself is  entertaining.,1356393600,3,191,4.277777777777778
2384084,5,B000AARKYY,My granddaughter who is 5 years old downloaded this series of videos and she will watch them over and over.  We have 4 series on my Kindle Fire and she never gets bored watching them.  It takes a lot to hold her attention and these cute videos do.,1349827200,8,247,4.125
2384085,4,B000AARKYY,There's not much more that can be said about the Winx Club except that it isn't just for tweens.  My granddaughter has been watching this since she was 4 years old and I've enjoyed it with her.  Much better than the Bratz.  We (my granddaughter & I) own all of the Winx Club either on DVD or on Video on Demand and will continue to purchase them.  We are also buying the Winx Club books.  Enjoy!,1348272000,8,395,4.144736842105263

2384088,5,B000AARKYY,"My 9 and 12 year old girls watch these episodes over and over again.  It's like ""Harry Potter"" for girls except it's ""good fairies"" battling ""bad witches"".  Other than the skimpy costumes the characters wear sometimes, I have nothing bad to say.  I've watched a few episodes and they have some good lessons to teach.",1168732800,7,316,4.709090909090909
2384089,5,B000AARKYY,"Winx Club is the best show ever!!! This 2nd DVD continues the adventures of the Winx girls, learning about their powers and saving the day from the witches! Winx Club is about friendship and girl power! It's got heroes, fairies, witches, magic, and more! A wonderful storyline, this fabulous show from Italy has got fans all over the world!!! I may be an adult, but I know what high quality is, and Winx Club has won my heart! I find myself relating to the characters, having unique qualities with each, sharing and caring for one another, cheering in each episode, and enjoying a truly work of art. Winx Club is great for all ages and I seriously and highly recommend it for all!",1132358400,29,680,4.536585365853658

The best way I can describe it is Sailor Moon + Harry Potter = Winx. Vol. 2 is a follow-up to volume 1. Without a doubt, the 4kids version is the best dub (especially with Flora and Bloom.) I already want to see volume 3!",1507680000,,348,4.208955223880597

I'm a little upset that all the stories, all the seasons used to be free with Prime.  Now only one or two episodes are free and all the others have a cost.  Even my five year old ""hated kindle"" for doing that to ""her Winx.""  But the show is wonderful entertainment for my daughter.",1436745600,,406,4.207792207792208
