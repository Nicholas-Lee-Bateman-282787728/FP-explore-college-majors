8521344,4,B007RKFXXU,Nicely handled B noir melodrama from Arch Oboler. Daring in its way.,1426032000,2,68,4.75
8521345,5,B007RKFXXU,"The marvelous Arch Oboler of LIGHTS OUT fame practically put this whole piece together himself for MGM in 1945, based on a play of his, and the results are a wonderfully quickly paced little B horror-thriller about a woman with a most bizarre split personality.  Phyllis Thaxter, Edmund Gwenn, and Stephen (nee Horace) McNally all turn in fine performances here and convey the complexities of the situation nicely.  I highly recommend this to all who love good psychological horror films.  Enjoy!!",1420588800,4,497,5.111111111111111
