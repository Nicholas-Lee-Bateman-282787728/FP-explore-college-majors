8319035,4,B001LNON4Y,"Not bad early 60's West German-made, English-dubbed mystery thriller.  A mysterious cloaked ""black abbot"" lurks the grounds of a country house, killing trespassers on the lookout for a hidden treasure.  The credits are in color.  The quality of the DVD-R is very good and the picture and black and white photography is excellent, though the picture is framed by black bands all around.  Recommended for fans of the genre.",1481932800,,421,5.057971014492754
8319036,2,B001LNON4Y,A predictable Edgar Wallace mystery. Lame comic relief. Nice photography. Indistinguishable from all the other films in this series.,1467849600,,132,6.0

8319038,4,B001LNON4Y,"There are a whole series of German films from the early 60's that all seem to feature similar cast members, and they're all based on the stories of Edgar Wallace.  I don't know why I seem to be drawn to these things, but the more of them I see, the more of them I'd LIKE to see.

There are several actors that turn up in these films again & again, one being a very young Klaus Kinski, the other being Joachim Fuchsberger.  Also Charles Regnier, and as the usual prissy but goofy assistant, Eddi Arent.  (think Barney Fife meets Felix Unger).

The story is a fairly typical one of greed, treachery, murder, and general evil-doing, this time with a mysterious hooded figure lurking about the estate of a man who is somewhat troubled in the mental health area.  There have been rumors for years of a hidden treasure SOMEWHERE on that estate but is it true?  Well, some people certainly seem to think so & have been busily seeking it while engaging in all manner of treachery and deceit along the way.

The DVD has a BEAUTIFUL widescreen presentation, and is an excellent print, which made me VERY happy as I'd just watched another film I purchased from Sinister Cinema that was rather poor quality, so I was releived that this one was so well done.  I would seek out others in this series, definitely.

4 out of 5.",1248220800,11,1311,4.447698744769874
