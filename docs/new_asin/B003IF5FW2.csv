Attach a leather leash to a properly fit prong collar (safer than choke chain or a flat collar which can crush a dog's windpipe)after the collar has been placed on the dog, say ""Down"" while gently pop-pop-popping down and forward with the leash while pressing down gently on the dog's mid back.  The dog goes to the floor and is patted and praised.  Repeat. The end.

If this method works for you, pick up a copy of the Monk's of New Skete or a Koehler book.  They're a bunch cheaper and teach much more than ""down"".",1318464000,,563,4.375

For others, it may take a few days, but I've yet to see a technique for teaching a dog to hold a down-stay that works faster.",1277078400,,265,4.115384615384615
