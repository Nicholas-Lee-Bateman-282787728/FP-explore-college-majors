2470378,5,B000CR76UI,"love this program just wish the dvds where not so expensive so I could buy the other series but being retired

makes it hard to buy them,as  its a great show and really enjoy them",1163030400,,179,4.085714285714285
2470379,5,B000CR76UI,I really miss watching this series. You cant go wrong buying any Frost episode. If you love this series maybe you would also be interested in Cracker too(not the horrible American version),1156809600,2,188,4.90625
2470380,5,B000CR76UI,"I did not like Frost at first as seen on PBS, but when I started seeing the DVD from # 1 on, I got to know an actor that I have seen before but would have never realised that he was Pop Larkin in Darling Buds of May. David Jason has that vaudville driven acting ability to transfer from the medium into your life. You must see the next show or else. The problem I see is the interuption in the series. There are some missing years. I can see him age in paralell to myself, but still young enough to father a daughter. Will he stop the Frost series? I Hope not. I interviewed Colin Dexter in 1994, the Morse creator, and he said that he had to kill Morse off. There were many reasons for this. I don't believe the writers would kill Frost, I believe he will overwork himself to death.",1154217600,3,783,4.090909090909091
2470381,5,B000CR76UI,"I think you could arguably say that I have seen every Frost episode, at least those on DVD.  I envy those in the UK that have been able to see all of the episodes that don't make it to distribution!

The English do the murder/mystery genre like none other!  Unlike the lame series' Hollywood churns out that's full of nothing but slamming doors, car chases, and shootouts, with gratuitous sex and/or violence to overwhelm the least bit of allegory present in the morally and creatively bankrupt scripts that only Hollywood would pass as entertainment.

Frost's hard edge, with surprising interludes of humanity, to his own detriment at times, keep the long-running story line fresh.  Frost is human---he makes mistakes, he forgets personal plans because he's so married to his job, and loves to rebel against the imperially dictated administrivia that gets in the way of doing the real work.

The last episode could well be the death knell for Frost---though I can only hope not.  It would be fun to see Frost struggle in middle management as a DCI, straddling the line between Inspector and being in league with Hornrim Harry!

Let's hope for an 11th & 12th season.",1152662400,8,1166,4.824120603015075
2470382,5,B000CR76UI,"I love Frost, and its not just because it almost sounds like Frog. ""Frost"" is a great crime series, which, in stark contrast to almost every mainstream American detective show, refuses to glamorize either criminals or the people who pursue them. Rather than wrapping up every crime into nice black and white labels or a tidy little paradox, ""Frost"" leaves the viewer with a sobering sense for the dissonances and crises that afflict every the body politic. But what I love most is the wondering dismal grey Denton atmosphere. I can almost imagine I'm back in the swamp!",1151452800,3,569,4.816326530612245
2470383,5,B000CR76UI,"Again, David Jason and his detective, Jack Frost, get 5 stars hands down.  These two seasons are as well-written, as well-conceived as the former eight seansons. He's not a very conventional detective which makes him vulnerable, humerous and challenging to his superiors who seem to have a soft spot for a man who gets his man.  I haven't found a detective I like as well and Jason plays him to the hilt.  He always seems to have very entertaining sergeants along with him, sometimes to one-up him and other times to show him they have the stuff to get along with him.  I would recommend watching the other seasons first as this  one has continuations, but anyway you watch them, do it!!",1151452800,2,687,4.598360655737705
2470384,5,B000CR76UI,"I have been watching the ""A Touch of Frost"" series for years.  I am a great fan of this Murder/mystery series and I can certainly comprehend why it is so popular in Great Britain. David Jason has been playing the role of Detective Inspector Jack Frost for many years and he is very believable and wonderful as the un orthodox, non politically correct,  witty, crumpled, short of patience and curmudgeon like (but with a very good and extremely honorable heart) detective Jack Frost.  Viewing seasons nine and ten was like putting on a favorite flannel pair of pajamas (on a cold winter night) and enjoying the comfort.  I knew that I would be very well entertained by the script and by the acting and as expected, I was indeed well entertained.  This is really a splendid murder/mystery/detective series with Seasons 9 and 10 continuing the very fine tradition.

Although the above might give one the impression that ""A Touch of Frost"" is sleep inducing, it is NOT!  This 3-dvd disc 4 episode release of seasons 9 and 10 is anything but sleep inducing; it contains some exciting well written stories.  Frost has a new partner and a new love interest.  Both of the new characters add some ""spice"" and some ""new life"" to the series.  In addition, for once, he and his boss seem to be ""on the same side' of police matters.  Frost supervisor, inspector Mullet appears to have accepted that Frost is a damn good detective even though his methods could be thought of as unorthodox and a tad ""heavy handed""-when he is on the scent of solving a murder there ain't no stopping him.  The aforesaid is very evident in the two part story in Season 9  ""Mistaken Identity"" which is a ""nail biting"" episode.

If you want to see a great detective series or you just want to continue a love affair, as I did, with ""A Touch of Frost"" you can't go wrong buying Seasons 9 and 10 of ""A Touch of Frost"" Contained therein are two GREAT seasons!!",1146441600,22,1922,4.549418604651163
2470385,5,B000CR76UI,"If you are reading a review of A Touch of Frost Seasons 9 & 10, I believe it is safe to say that you are familiar with the character of Detective Inspector Jack Frost, played once again by the delightful Sir David Jason.  Since I am married to an expat, there are a few dates that we have marked on the calendar: our Anniversary, Guy Fawkes Night (For Her), the Boston Tea Party (For Me) and the DVD-pre order's of anything involving A Touch of Frost or David Jason.  No sooner did Seasons 9 & 10 arrive did I have to guess what would be on the TV the next three nights.

Packed onto 3 DVD's are a total of 4 episodes, including a two parter which covers Season 9.  Jason continues to play Jack Frost effortlessly.  Frost's curmudgeonly, passionate and sometimes improper methods continue to lead Frost to success.  For those familiar with the series, it is interesting to note that Frost's supervisor, Mullet, has finally realized that Frost is more of an asset than a hindrance.  The internal strife between conformity and non-conformity that has been played as a subplot by Frost and Mullet through the years has been shifted to a Frost/Mullet versus outside police management story.  It is nice to see that the storyline change to reflect the dynamics between these two characters.

The strongest episode is Hidden Truth.  Followed by Mistaken Identity and Close Encounters.  One reason I have always enjoyed British crime shows is because the procedures and methods are somewhat alien to US viewers.  This difference, at least to me, allows for a greater suspension of disbelief.  I can not stand to watch CSI: Albuquerque or any of its 24 manifestations.  I do enjoy Frost.  Of course, a review written by someone on the other side of the pond might have the exact opposite reaction and tend to think that Frost is ""rubbish""!

One thing Frost used to stay away from was the blathering CSI doublespeak which permeates every episode of this aforementioned title.  You know it when you hear it...two forensic specialists explaining to each other ad nauseam about a scientific fact they both already know but feel the need to state anyway. Guy 1: ""Hey, Blood"".  Guy 2: ""You know blood type is determined by the presence of antigens on the surface of red blood cells"". Guy 1 {Nods in Agreement}.  This popped up a couple times more than usual, but for Frost's sake, I will let it slide.

Seasons 9 & 10 are presented in anamorphic widescreen with a fairly nice transfer considering the PAL to NSTC conversion.  Don't look for any extras, which would be nice someday, but do look for David Jason's brother making a reappearance as Trigg.  I know we are a couple years behind the UK on Frost titles, so I can guarantee there is at least one more Season looking for a spot on our shelf.",1146355200,34,2784,4.627291242362525
2470386,3,B000CR76UI,"It truly depends if you're a avowed anglophile or just looking for  entertaining detective yarns with English accents.  I know David Jason as the hero, Del Boy, in ""Only Fools and Horses"", the longest running and best loved English sitcom about the misadventures of two huckster but lovable project dwellers and their grand dad.  So, it was hard to make the switch watching David as a municipal detective.  Plots were predictable, supporting characters mildly entertaining, lacked the indigenious English plot  quirkiness in many other programs and, if you've seen Michael Kitchen in ""Foyle's War"" well, you will be disappointed, I am sorry to say. But, to fill an evening with plausible and gentle mysteries, then ""A Touch of Frost"" will melt you nicely for the evening.  I watched two episodes and the DVD was off to the second hand shop.",1396656000,,840,4.964285714285714
2470387,5,B000CR76UI,It was delivered quickly.  My husband and I really like these English mysteries. They don't have a lot of cussing or dirty words like some American mysteries do. They do have some comedy parts. Frost is one of the best actors in this part.,1394323200,,239,4.431818181818182
2470388,5,B000CR76UI,"It's one of the great UK detective shows out there.
He's chippy, irreverent and very good at what he does.",1386892800,,106,4.35
2470389,4,B000CR76UI,"If you like larger than life heros, who go about saving the world and have the president of the USA owing a favor, combined this with a group of agents who don't follow the norm you will really like this series",1381449600,,210,4.146341463414634
2470390,5,B000CR76UI,"I am a big fan of British detective shows,  especially the Agatha Christie mysteries.  I did not think I would like any other shows as well but A Touch of Frost is equally good and entertaining.",1372723200,,194,4.361111111111111
2470391,4,B000CR76UI,"no car chases,,no gun battles,,no kung-fu fighting,,, just an excellent ""brit""  who dun it.

the only thing you have to be careful with,, is the british seasons,, some are 100 minutes ( 1 episode )  some are 600 minutes,, same price,,, totally unfair.",1370995200,,251,4.790697674418604
2470392,5,B000CR76UI,"He's such a good actor.  Stories were fun, yet serious.  My sister is now checking the series out on computer",1369094400,,109,4.4
2470393,5,B000CR76UI,"The following applies to all 15 series of A Touch of Frost
1) Why:  Frost has little violence, and lots of wit.  Subtle humor and along the series it builds up characters with their virtues and their failures.  It has always a humane side to the stories, poor people, sad people, ambitious people, deeply unhappy people.  Kindness and noble lives where you least expect them.  And evil lives where only goodness and success is overtly displayed.  All this kaleidoscope of human existences, trying to survive in a world that they often don't understand.  Even the bad characters  are shown in their human light.
2).Compare with others:  I enjoy English police whodunit's, all of them. Poirot, Marple, Morse, Lewis, Maigret, Foyle.  Most of them share the features I described above.  I've known this series since it was first broadcast in England, where I used to live.
3)  Attributes: described in my first paragraph.",1363046400,,917,4.9605263157894735
2470394,5,B000CR76UI,I have not seen these particular seasons 9 & 10 of A Touch Of Frost(I bought them) but I hope to collect all the seasons of Frost. I 1st enjoyed these by renting them from my library and saw the 1st couple of seasons and was immediately hooked. This is a gritty crime drama from the 90's in England. The English seem to make better mystery and crime dramas then we here in the USA do. Frost is the exact detective I love to watch. I hope they will make more series like this. Please bring down the prices of this series so those of us who love these can purchase all of them.,1360627200,,575,4.052631578947368
2470395,5,B000CR76UI,"I saw it so long ago that I've forgotten why I thought it was so good, but I do know that it did not disappoint me.",1359244800,,115,3.4615384615384617
2470396,5,B000CR76UI,"This is one of the best British series.  David Jason is marvellous as Detective Frost, the whole cast is great.  Very believable, good plots, some humor adds to the beauty of this series.  David Jason proved what a top class actor he is moving from the comedy of Del Boy in Only Fools and Horses, one of the British classic comedy series..to become a first class serious actor in Frost.  This dvd with series 9 and 10 carries on the great tradition, I thoroughly recommend watching Frost from series 1 right through, the viewer will not be disappointed.  Only one thing to warn about.  Don't watch it on an empty stomach !!  He tends to eat all the great British classic foods, fish and chips, bacon 'butties' British breakfast, Indian curries...by the time I've finished watching I'm hungry and longing for those foods !!!",1358208000,,823,4.673611111111111
2470397,5,B000CR76UI,First time review... great character ... If you enjoy Brit police work Frost is your man. No nonsense kind of guy that always cost him in the end.,1313798400,,146,4.25
2470398,5,B000CR76UI,"This set contains three discs with four superbly acted and well-told tales:
  Mistaken Identity
  Hidden Truths
  Close Encounters
  Held in Trust
 Each episode, except for the first is 90 minutes long. The first is in two parts, is the entire 9th season, and is 2  hours long. This is a well-deserved award-wining series. David Jason plays Detective Inspector Jack Frost, a curmudgeon, with dry wit. Frost generally has conflicts with his boss, who complains, among many other things, about Frost's failure to do the ""necessary"" paperwork.

 The stories usually have three major plots, one of which is about Frost, such as a new love interest in the first episode and he losing his winning lottery ticket in the second. Examples of the two crimes in each episode are the two in Close Encounters. Frost needs to solve a series of burglaries and a murder at a quarry. The first is complicated by a seven year old boy of a divorced couple going missing. The second by a witness to the murder who is autistic and who thinks he saw aliens commit the murder. The stories are easy to follow and filled with dry humor.",1313280000,,1111,4.670103092783505
2470399,5,B000CR76UI,"Once again I come back to Detective Inspector Jack Frost. With the exception of Season 15 (the final season), set to be released in a few weeks, I own every one. Certainly ""Frost"" richly deserves membership in the upper strata of Britain's greatest TV detectives along side Morse, Barnaby, Tenison, and Foyle. Like the redoubtable Jane Tenison, Jack Frost works in a more urban and gritty environment, rubbing elbows with England's most ill-tempered and tatty criminals. There is much to like about our man Frost. He is compassionate, down to earth, forgetful and seemingly unlucky in the romance department. A copper for the common man. A hero, to be sure, but a reluctant one. He has been known to breach protocol now and then, much to the chagrin of ""Horn-Rimmed Harry"", the ever officious Superintendant Mullett, Frost's boss. I have seen every episode thus far, and not one of them disappoints. (Sir) David Jason flawlessly portrays the forthright, no-nonsense Frost with a comic flair, hearkening back to Jason's roots as a comic actor. It seems most English police dramas are fairly riddled with Great Britain's finest character actors. This series is no exception.",1290470400,,1172,5.077720207253886

2470402,5,B000CR76UI,"A real treat for Frost fans, and would-be Frost fans. The stories zip with plenty of twists in the plot and unexpected endings that you realize you should have seen coming. David Jason is of course superb, but so are the complete cast. Although it is one of a series, and of course I recommend the entire series, the stories are stand-alone so it does not matter if you see them out of order.",1231718400,,392,4.3108108108108105
2470403,5,B000CR76UI,"Inspector Frost is a proven winner in Seasons 9 and 10. His immediate  bureaucratic supervisor and detail man Mr. Mullet is an effective counter balance to Frost's bull dog determination and full speed ahead intensity.  These two make a great pair for this superb, long running British  police detective series.",1221782400,,311,5.18
2470404,5,B000CR76UI,"A hard look at crime fighting in modern England away from London...The best of English tenacity with aging veteran policeman..Against the political correctness, sluggishness of govenment, etc DCI Frost wins.
