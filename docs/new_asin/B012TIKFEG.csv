7358372,5,B012TIKFEG,"I have watched the movies in this series enough with my 3-year-old son, that I can actually sing 99% of the songs! If you are looking for movies that are age appropriate for toddlers and teach great life lessons with very light ""scary"" parts - then this series is for you! They are family oriented and kindness driven. It's nice to put a movie on for your child and not have to worry about it! (Mommy break of the day!)",1465776000,4,419,4.25

7358374,2,B012TIKFEG,"I've noticed that a lot of the five-star reviews on these land before time movies is from people who loved it when they were a kid and are just happy to have found them on DVD. Although I was born in the early 80s, I never watched these growing up so this is a nostalgia free review for people who are just looking for good videos for their children. I let my kids watch a few of these just because my little boy likes dinosaurs (we fast forward thru the intros which always give a lesson on evolution), but they are not my favorite because a lot of bad behavior is modeled, especially by Cera the Triceratops. For example in the great valley adventure, she almost gets her friends killed by bullying them into disobeying their parents and going somewhere they aren't allowed to go. But instead of realizing her mistake & being sorry she rounds up the kids and tries to stir up anti-grownups feelings in them and tries to get them to rebel against their parents. Of course in the end the kids realize their mistakes, but I don't think little kids will always hold onto what they're watching and then tie it in with the moral at the end. I prefer cartoons where no negative behavior is modeled at all, such as Curious George and Paw Patrol.",1464825600,3,1239,4.391304347826087

But my nostalgia is strong with these movies and they are fine for playing nose in the background when doing other things or if future children need to be entertained.
There are 2 discs. GreatVallyAdventure and TheGreatGiving are on the same 2014 disc. (Single sided, thank goodness!)
