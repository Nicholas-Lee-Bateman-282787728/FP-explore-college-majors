6612947,3,B00N83X378,"The reason I watch bad movies is for ones like this which had those moments. When there is nothing that sounds interesting a bad movie can be the answer. Sometimes it takes a lot of previews and 5 minutes of this or that but occasionally you find one that has just odd enough story, passable acting and those B.S. moments that make you roll out of your chair. To me this was one of those and if you don't have fun with it oh well.",1428624000,3,430,4.070588235294117
6612948,3,B00N83X378,"80% low level cliche is balanced out by 20% bat-guano bonkers to form something worth a try. Nothing demonstrates this uneveness better than the cast. One of the most blatantly sterotyped black female characters to come along in recent memory, but a take on Jack the Ripper that's the first of it's kind I remember seeing. Marion Kopf is honestly disturbing as Jeffrey Dahmer- if IMDB is telling me true that it's his only film role, someone needs to find this guy more work stat! But then we have a discount Casper Von Dien hero and a primary antagonist so lacking in charisma that I honestly forgot about him through the second act.",1426896000,4,634,4.619469026548672
6612949,4,B00N83X378,Low budget fun. Don't expect an masterpiece. Go into it expecting campy fun and you might enjoy !!!,1425859200,3,99,4.555555555555555
6612950,3,B00N83X378,"Very fun concept.  Real life serial killers brought back to reap havoc on hapless victims of a bus breakdown.  Really needed more gore.  Fun watch, though.  Ending was abrupt.  Very popcorn, watch once, throw away after.  Get it cheap, you'll have fun.",1421193600,6,252,4.880952380952381

6612952,4,B00N83X378,"If you enjoy low budget horror films, this is the one for you. Cool concept -- the acting is up and down. The fight scenes are entertaining and a few twist keep this entertaining. At a quick 1 hr 20 mins the movie flies by.",1416009600,5,223,3.977777777777778
6612953,4,B00N83X378,I liked it.  Good action some scares and really funny.,1415836800,2,54,4.4
6612954,3,B00N83X378,"During the opening credits of (The Butchers) aka (Death Factory) we are treated to a montage of newspaper clippings and photographs of Albert Fish,John Wayne Gacy,Ed Gein,Jeffrey Dahmer and other notorious serial killers.

A bus load of people get stranded and walk to the only place within walking distance which just happens to be ""The Death Factory"" a Serial killer museum. In this museum there is a vial of each of the killers blood and other twisted things.

Enter the people from the bus, some demonic rituals and all kinds of craziness ensues. The story was clever but could have been executed much better seeing as the actors playing the resurrected serial killers were nothing like the characters they were portraying in stature, girth or attitude.

It was fun at times due to some cheese here and there and a character named Auntie Mae,a no nonsense pleasantly plump, African American woman with an ""I wish you would"" attitude played by Mara Hall whom had me laughing quite a few times.

There wasn't a lot of gore especially for a film entitled (The Butchers) and what gore there was ,was very low budget friendly! You know the type,retractable knives..quick camera cut aways...showing a knife going in then panning down to see some kind of raw meat or homemade guts on the ground..etc.

The acting was surprisingly good by most of the actors so that wasn't a downfall. If it was suppose to be scary it was a huge fail, but if it was suppose to just be somewhat entertaining they accomplished that!",1415664000,13,1509,4.766283524904215

6612958,2,B00N83X378,"Very good comedy. I found myself laughing at scenes, over jumping and getting actually scared from the scene. Very good for younger teenagers minus the nudity. I also found the characters very predictable and stereotypical. Really? Did the black woman really have to talk about fried chicken?",1441843200,,292,5.23404255319149

6612971,3,B00N83X378,"The Butchers is not a deep, witty, horror story. The film stays pretty straight horror, leaning toward a comedy edge. The real sell is the blood and gore which for a low budget film gives good gore. The highlight of this one is the killers themselves. On screen, as they clash with one another and the victims, the story becomes really entertaining. The Butcher may not appeal to all horror fans, mostly because of the simple story, cheap thrills and gimmicks, plus some of the effects fall short when it comes to being effective. However, for what it is, this is a fun, entertaining indie horror worthy of a once over. There is a lot things that are disappointing, but there are also some moments that really shine.",1431475200,,716,4.6015625

6612978,4,B00N83X378,"Low budget but who cares!! The movie starts out slow and I finally understood what it was about by the middle. I really liked the movie and the acting wasn't bad at all! I have seen worse!! Good special effects through the movie. And again, I have seen worse!! I gave it 4 stars because of how slow the movie was in the beginning. Other than that, I stayed in my chair and did NOT miss anything! I would watch this movie again!",1430092800,,427,4.156626506024097
6612979,2,B00N83X378,"I would have rated this higher if there were not so many ugly people kissing in the movie. Completely took away from the storyline. The characters fit every cliche that matched their race. If the director had a bigger budget and the ability to make smoother scene transitions while not wanting to jerk off every other scene with girls kissing, it might have been a 4 or 5 star movie. Lastly, the part of Jack The Ripper was completely trash... he turned into a freak lesbian girl??? That was NOT anything like The Ripper. Good storyline; terrible follow through, riding every single modern shock value wave and racist idealism until the very last scene.",1429747200,,653,4.7368421052631575
6612980,4,B00N83X378,"This is one of those low budget jobs that actually works. Its quirky in some places, humorous, and violent. You don't take it seriously because of the humor, but it is still a horror movie and people do get killed, gruesomely. I like the concept. Various serial killers are brought back from the dead. There is one man who enters the town that is basically a tourist attraction with various shops set up for each of the serial killers. He was going to use the Book of the Dead to bring them to life. Instead some punk dude uses the book sarcastically to the amusement of his punk girlfriend. Then they have sex. While they are going at it the ritual takes hold and each unit that was set up for the serial killers comes to life with that serial killer. Nice twist on Jack the Ripper. You'll see. Funny. The killer from The Town That Dreaded Sundown was there as well. There is a heavy set black woman who steals the comedy portion of the movie with her tough as nails attitude and take no crap philosophy. She refers to that killer from Sundown as a KKK member. Whitey! Overall I really enjoyed this movie. No thinking required. No character development or worrying about the storyline or anything like that. Its just good old fashioned entertainment without the muss and fuss of a thinking persons movie. Just enjoy it for what it is, fun and funny.",1429574400,2,1350,4.469635627530365
6612981,2,B00N83X378,"Another loser in the Halloween/Friday the 13th clones. Don't waste time watching this. No scares, no anticipation. Just let down after let down.

6612983,3,B00N83X378,"I liked the abandon town that was used to create a roadside ""Museum of Death"" attraction of serial killers, it created a creepy atmosphere. Gotta give this credit for a somewhat original idea. There is some cheese here for sure but I didn't stop watching like most Prime horror films.",1428969600,,284,4.7
6612984,4,B00N83X378,"Fun B-Movie. Full of stereotypical characters, but at least they weren't interchangeable like in many others like it.

8676534,4,B00N83X378,"Well, finally we have proof that low budget doesn't mean awful. This is an interesting idea and it is a good movie. I would honestly watch it only once but still I was paying attention and having some fun at the same time. The performances overall were not too bad and actually we got some pretty good ones. The story is about a bus load of people breaking down in the middle of nowhere and find an abandoned town where someone is trying to resurrect 6 of history's most notorious killers. I did enjoy it and I do recommend it is you are looking for something a bit different and not bad either.",1479340800,,595,4.274336283185841
