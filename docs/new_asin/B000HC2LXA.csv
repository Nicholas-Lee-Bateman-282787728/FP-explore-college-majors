2634091,4,B000HC2LXA,"This is a fun game that works on DVD players as well as the TV. The instructions are simple and brief and the game moves quickly. I used it with two players, but one player can use it to play too. The questions range from music in the 50's to present day. After about two dozen games some of the questions repeat, and the music is not by the original artists. That is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. You must be into music and know some trivia to enjoy the game.",1204070400,2,466,3.9157894736842107
8138392,4,B000HC2LXA,"This game is fun and great for all ages (or anyone who's over 10 and knows about older music, anyway). The on-disc instructions leave much to be desired, and questions begin to repeat after a few plays, but the game is, all in all, a satisfactory music trivia DVD.

To play, you start by choosing a decade (we played 70's, 80's, 90's/00's, or random, which has questions from each decade), then a player gets control of the remote for one round. A question appears (either ""name the song that's playing,"" ""these are the opening lyrics to what song?"" or ""identify this artist"" from a blurry picture), and if you select the correct answer, you get three more questions about that artist. Some of the questions are super-easy (""Which three are the Bee-Gees brothers?"") or obscure (""This artist appeared in what underground band years before breaking out?""), but there are plenty of questions that are challenging yet answerable. The scoring is built in, too, so that you don't have to mess with pen & paper.

Also, they don't use actual songs - instead, they use karaoke versions, so in a couple of songs, they were tricky to answer. As for the artists whose music is used, there are questions about artists like: the Bee Gees and Glenn Campbell in the 70's game; Carly Simon, the B-52's, and A-ha when you play the 80's; and P!nk, Matchbox 20, Macy Gray, Kelly Rowland, and NSYNC when you play the 90's/'00s game.

I would recommend this game to people who know a lot about music of a given decade, and maybe to a group who wants a party game, but not for people who are unfamiliar with or only casual fans of music of the past.",1457308800,,1626,4.561643835616438
8138393,1,B000HC2LXA,It has no actual music. It sounds like the way the original ring tones sound. I was expecting actual music not distorted beats. Makes the game boring and lame,1428969600,,158,4.482758620689655
8138394,5,B000HC2LXA,works well on pc as well as dvd....gotta be fast tho ;-),1419724800,,56,3.75
8138395,1,B000HC2LXA,"this  did not work properly at all. totally disappointing product .  very clunky to use, very few songs.do not buy",1403654400,,114,4.65
8138396,2,B000HC2LXA,This was just too slow of a game.  I eneded up giving it away as it could not keep the interest of my guests at a party I used this at.,1361232000,,135,3.3548387096774195
8138397,1,B000HC2LXA,"As I live in Africa sometimes we wait 3 months for things to arrive by boat.
We thought that this would be a fun past time but after much anticapation we inserted the disc into the DVD and nothing happened, it wouldn't play and yes it was the right zone and the right system but it was just a dud
A complete waste of money and time
A real disappointment",1344816000,,353,4.057142857142857
8138398,2,B000HC2LXA,"Thought it would be more challenging, but it's not. Very easy. And it repeated questions over and over. So it wasn't really worth the money, in my opinion. I'd pay $5 for it, but not more. Really disappointed. Fun for the first 10 minutes. After that it got old.",1294790400,,262,4.36734693877551
8138399,2,B000HC2LXA,This game is fun the first time but beyond that not worth the price. The song list is short and you can go through it all in a hour or less.,1292544000,,140,3.5483870967741935
8138400,5,B000HC2LXA,"I got this game a couple of years back and fell in love with it. Most of the song intros sound like the actual hit versions, to me anyway. You must be quick, the faster you lock in your answer, the better your score will be. I play this game on my PS2 using those controllers to lock in my answers. The game is quick, maybe too quick for some. But you can always start another game when you finish.

I like the fact that it features multiple decades and a solo option. I keep trying to better my time. A great game for those fans of rock and pop music.",1255996800,,552,3.972972972972973
8138401,2,B000HC2LXA,I bought this game for my nephew as a Christmas gift and we took it on a ski trip for everyone to play.  All of us were disappointed in the format in that each team plays for a lengthy stretch of time while the other team just sits.  Plus the music seemed like studio or elevator remixes with other intro music all around it making it difficult/inaccurate to guess the answers.  There were a dozen of us playing and we all much prefer the Shout About games ~ they need to do a vol. 3 for music.,1230508800,,494,4.072164948453608
