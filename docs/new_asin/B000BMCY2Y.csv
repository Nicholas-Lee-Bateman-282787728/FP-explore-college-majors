2423782,3,B000BMCY2Y,"I saw this movie many years ago and recently bought it on DVD. The movie is still as entertaining as ever but the movie was not remastered at all before being transfered to DVD.

There is a lot of 'noise' in the picture but even with that it is still a movie worth seeing.

When Hollywood remakes so many old movies why can't they pick something worthy of it such as this classic.

You may want to wait till after April 15th to see this though for obvious reasons.",1144281600,6,464,4.191011235955056
2423783,5,B000BMCY2Y,I loved this movie when it came out.  I'd like to know why it isn't out on DVD when a lot of utter drek is.,1119484800,2,107,3.28
2423784,5,B000BMCY2Y,"This is an interesting look at how the IRS has run away from the constitution that they are sworn to protect.  In this movie the IRS just lashes out at people because they MIGHT have something, and of course the IRS Court (which exists) rules for the IRS.",1085961600,5,255,4.3125
2423785,4,B000BMCY2Y,"Harry's War gets very little attention. This is unfortunate because it is entertaining and informative.
This film brings many real facts about the IRS to light. They do have their own special courts and are prone to abusing their authority. The Congressional hearings during the mid 90's showed that this film was not far off in depicting IRS abuse.
While the actual declaration of war and standoff in this movie are fictional, there are similarities between this and the Waco and Ruby Ridge standoffs. Of course, those standoffs were over different issues and involved people who attracted governmental attention for their extremist views.
Harry is different. He is a regular guy who gets driven to taking extreme actions because of the heavy-handed tactics of the IRS. This war of Harry's is a bit over the top, but that's what makes a film more fun than documentaries. Harry's speech at the end reaffirms his levelheaded nature to the world, and the IRS ends up looking bad before all.
As a piece of cinematography, this film is average. The acting, sets, editing, and soundtrack are all OK. One thing that makes this film special is that it dares to disparage one of the most powerful agencies in the US government. How many places in the world are there where you can get away with that? Also, this film ridicules notions of benevolent philosopher kings running government. Films like Dave and The American President focus on personalities- so long as nice caring people have power, all will be well. Harry's War avoids this kind of `Camelot' mythologization of government. One way to sum up Harry's war would be ""power corrupts, absolute power corrupts absolutely"".",1059782400,31,1671,4.950177935943061
2423786,3,B000BMCY2Y,"I was excited when the movie was finally re-released.  I had to watch it twice to figure out what was wrong.  Several chunks were hacked out leaving logical gaps in the action.  It's only 98 minutes, why the editing?  There was nothing objectionable with the original ----- Why?",1014768000,6,278,4.729166666666667
2423787,3,B000BMCY2Y,"This Very Poor Copy is Like Watching on a 1970's TV. Sad to see a wonderfully fun movie with such a poignant and timely message about IRS Oppression shown is such a terrible format. The VHS Tape I had many years ago had better video quality than this and I won't even go into the simply awful audio quality. I suppose that I shouldn't have expected a movie with a story like this to have been run through any kind of digital restoration for redistribution.

Even through the wavy lines, blurred picture and terrible audio the frustratingly realistic story of IRS and Government Oppression comes through clear as a bell and is as relevant in today's America as it was . This Movie should be required viewing for every American Student and Citizen",1452470400,,745,4.601503759398496
2423788,4,B000BMCY2Y,"Edward Herrmann, in his earlier years as an actor, gives a fine and believable performance as a Harry Johnson a young father separated from his wife and children. Even in his adult life Harry is his ""Auntie's"" little ""Buttons"" so when she has trouble with the tax collectors in her twilight years, she contacts ""Buttons"" to straighten things out. This is a is low-budget film, but excellent none-the-less and so relevant decades later, to the robotic, over-regulated government toadies that push pencils and wield their rubber-stamps like the knights of old mastered the sword. However, knights had honor. These power-hungry, small minded civil service monkeys have power without honor nor conscience. They are portrayed quite realistically and yet comically in Harry's War. A bit of trivia (and something that adds to the movie in more recent viewings) Harry's War was filmed in Saint George, Utah, the backdrop for many westerns. When I first saw this show in 1982, I had no idea this town existed. Eight years later my parents retired there and while driving around, an elderly friend pointed out where the actual scenes and explosions were filmed. The foundation of the house in the movie was still there. More than thirty years later, there are residences all over that hill. I wonder if any of these new people realize a movie was filmed in their back yards.",1449014400,,1364,4.960698689956332
2423789,5,B000BMCY2Y,"This movie tells the truth about the IRS, and how the tax is totally voluntary.  I saw it in the movie theater when it first came out, a long time age.  When the movie ended, the entire audience in the theater gave it a standing applause.",1447632000,,238,4.1521739130434785
2423790,2,B000BMCY2Y,This movie was a bit of a stretch. It had a little too much violence to be real funny. The bias against the IRS a lot of us can agree to but the methods used to combat this agency were a bit strange. Why Harry's wife came back to him was because the script writer thought that would be cute and not because it made any sense.,1446681600,,325,3.8656716417910446
2423791,4,B000BMCY2Y,"Entertaining.  Throughout space and time, the IRS continues to abuse us.",1445558400,,72,5.545454545454546
2423792,5,B000BMCY2Y,An old classic that is as funny and relevant now as it was years ago.,1441238400,,69,3.6666666666666665
2423793,5,B000BMCY2Y,"I saw this movie years ago and had to have it on dvd.
This movie is a great family movie, in my honest opinion!
I do not want to spoil this movie for anyone so my synopsis will be only a couple of lines.
It involves an older lady, a middle aged man with wife and children and the I.R.S.
The movie does an excellent job building the characters on screen.
There is NO foul language!  The story line may be above really young children.
I believe this movie will give Christian and Patriotic families a few chuckles.
The only thing about this movie is how frightening it can be when compared to recent events!",1437177600,,605,4.260869565217392
2423794,4,B000BMCY2Y,"I saw this as a teenager.  My memory is that it was a bit better.  Still, it is a funny, fantasy guaranteed to delight anyone who buys it.  In other words, if you're interested enough to consider, you will like it.  Besides. David Ogden Stiers plays the bad guy . . . and ""Major Charles Emerson Winchester"" gets his in the end.",1433462400,,327,4.225806451612903

2423799,2,B000BMCY2Y,"As believable as Gilligan's Island and every bit as well-acted, Harry's War managed to take the kernel of a great story and reduce it to the farcical. Geraldine Page plays a ridiculous character who gets crosswise with the IRS. Her old friend (Herrmann) visits her and things go immediately downhill. While a solid message keeps attempting to take hold of the movie, the ludicrous, cartoon-like IRS agents, Army personnel, and press corps keep dragging the story back into absurdity. Harry's speech at the end is great--and even more germane nowadays--but you have to endure 1:45 of cringe-worthy, low-grade situation comedy stupidity to hear it. Save your money and time.",1420243200,,672,5.174311926605505
2423800,5,B000BMCY2Y,This is an unbelievable story about the IRS.  Only bits and pieces of the corruption in our government and this organization have barely scratched the surface.  A real eye opener!,1419724800,,179,4.933333333333334

2423839,5,B000BMCY2Y,"Harry's War is an excellent, old movie which hits a modern theme.  Arrogant government, independent staff and a lack of concern for the public.  It stretches things in places, but makes the point.  As a grandfather I find this to be one of my favorites.  And, it is without nudity or profanity.  This is another good Amazon product.",1308096000,,332,4.655172413793103
2423840,5,B000BMCY2Y,"This movie has an interesting history. I first saw it in the early 80s on HBO but in later years, it simply disappeared. I went to a video rental place and they tried to look it up in their master catalog and it just wasn't there. I always thought it very suspicious that a great movie with top name stars just ceased to exist for over twenty years. I always figured the IRS threatened to audit the owners or something, but who knows?

The ending of the movie turned out to be eerily similar to later events in Waco, TX.

Anyway, it's a great, family-oriented movie. I give it five stars.",1304640000,,588,4.288288288288288
2423841,5,B000BMCY2Y,We were so happy to find this film.  We had seen it 20 years ago and it is a good story with a definite lesson to hear.  I hope many others will be able to watch it also.  Excellent service from the vendor.,1250294400,,206,3.744186046511628
2423842,5,B000BMCY2Y,"I had been looking for the movie ""Harry's War"" for some time. A lot of places either never heard of it or no longer carried it.  I always enjoyed the movie as would any sensible tax payer.  I hope more people will find out about the movie and watch it.  It was funny but I feel it had a hidden message.  I doubt if Hollywood would have the guts to make a movie like that ever again, especially in these times.",1243814400,,409,4.012345679012346
2423843,5,B000BMCY2Y,"It's been years since I first saw this movie.  You'll find this is a great movie, suitable for viewing by the whole family.

Set in an earlier time (1986), when mailmen still walked the streets delivering mail to neighbors they knew as friends, Harry's War tells the tale of mild mannered postman Harry Johnson (Edward Hermann) who takes his two children on vacation to visit aging aunt Beverly (Geraldine Paige) in the town where he grew up.

Aunt Beverly is a grandmotherly type who is generous to a fault, but is refusing to buckle under what she considers onerous tax bills and harassment from the IRS.  She tells Harry she wants him to take everything she owns because, if he doesn't take it all, the IRS will.  Harry agrees to help Aunt Beverly and packs up his home belongings and moves to Aunt Beverly's mission - an old home on a military parts junk yard.

Background IRS meetings and conversations clearly describe an adversarial relationship is brewing, supported by bureaucrats looking for advancement in the IRS, confusing IRS rules and regulations, etc.  Harry's meetings with the IRS are increasingly frustrating, an IRS spy is found having dinner with the mission, and Harry's bank account is seized.  Then to IRS tax court, blatant IRS injustice, and Aunt Beverly's collapse in court.  And so the tale begins.

I don't want to give away the whole plot, but you will find it's an hilarious romp through Harry's attempt to regain his property by declaring war on the IRS... on live television.  Well worth the viewing.  Rumor has it that the IRS banned this movie years ago, so I'm personally glad to see it available again on DVD.

The vision of Harry driving through town in an army half-track still burns clearly in my mind.  Great movie!",1241481600,5,1756,4.752475247524752
