Finally a film that deals with people just being people and not labels. The cast is excellent  esp. Anderson and Tilly. This is a group of friends who will stick by you  no matter what and isn't that what we all want out of life!",949190400,7,353,4.5
1057574,5,6305680175,Mitchell Anderson leads a great ensemble cast in this story of a gay man who after a second hate crime leaves his colorful cast of friends to find himself.  While Mitchell is wonderful it's the rest of the cast including  Jennifer Tilly and Lorie Petty who STEAL the show.  The speech given by  Lorie's girlfriend in the movie was one of the most heartfelt scenes I've  ever witnessed in a movie.  It's worth the price of the DVD itself.  At  it's heart it's a comedy with dramatic elements.  Definitely a must have.,948931200,22,516,4.521739130434782

1057666,5,6305680175,"Relax...Its Just Sex follows a group of friends as they deal with some serious problems while training to find contentment and happiness in their own lives. During the first 30 minutes or so, we are introduced to the group, comprised of two gay male couples, a lesbian couple, a straight couple, a single (involuntarily) gay male, and a woman who has left a 9 year lesbian relationship to a heterosexual one.

Tara, well played by Jennifer Tilly, is a slightly hyper, but adorable to watch woman trying to have a baby and deal with her boyfriend Gus who is constantly claiming he is leaving any minute to explore the world. She seems to be the center of the group who connected the other's.  Her beau's gay brother Javi (beautifully done by Eddie Garcia) has recently been diagnosed with HIV. Mitchell Anderson's Vincey, one of Tara's best friends, is dealing with the ""joys"" of being single, such as his new potential, Buzz, falling for Javi instead. Diego and Dwight are fun to watch as a Christian gay couple. Serena Scott Thomas plays Megan, who dumps her lesbian lover, Sarina, for said lover's male cousin. Sarina, done by Cynda Williams, turns to the very butch lesbian Robin, who is played perfectly by Lori Petty. Paul Winfield makes a cameo or two as an outrageous friend of Vincey's who is gay and effeminate.

The acting in this film was awesome and this movie did a wonderful job of presenting a variety of romantic and platonic relationships as just that - relationships.  The sex scenes were tasteful done and erotic, but they also didn't shy away from them.

One of the things I liked best about this movie was it's subtlety. On the surface, it's basically a movie about normal people with some tragic and major events occurring. But it also has several interesting views and ideas introduced that sometimes get lost in the film's ""normality"" during that first viewing. Buzz's controversial statements on AIDS and HIV, for example, could provide for interesting debates among friends. The gay-bashing incident will probably have viewers pondering the lines of right and wrong and what is ""too far"" when getting revenge.

All in all, I highly recommend this movie.",1351036800,,2179,4.844086021505376

I don't think they could have done a better job of this film. Cast works well together, Storyline, a classic idea, but ingeniously put together, and the comedy side of the film plays well with the over-all story!

If only most gay films were like this one, I would be purchasing the lot. I realize how many positive reviews there are for this film, but i REALLY wanted to voice my oppinions on this. This one's WELL worth the money.",1312070400,,612,4.267241379310345
1057669,2,6305680175,"Looks like I am the only person who is ready to throw the movie away.  I found it somewhat disgusting, rarely amusing although attempts were made to generate laughs, with a group of crazy characters preoccupied with sex.
It starts out showing two ladies hugging passionately & then two men holding like bosom buddies. Jennifer Tilly is excellent. She wants to have children. Her bi-sexual friend gets it up in the kitchen. There are lots of interactions between men and women focusing largely on sex, even though other things go on in their lives. One shot shows two lesbians sharing it, two men coupled getting themselves off, a mixed couple intwined and lots of confusion. They might have been relaxing. I fell asleep. Perhaps the picture is good on DVD. The film was made by an
independent small firm, altered to meet video ratings. If UR, the bare end results wouldn't differ much.  I missed most of thee nuances other
reviewers express.  For those intrigued by homo & bi-sexual love scenes or who enjoy crude comedy, this film would be excellent. Avoid the VHS.",1215388800,,1066,4.782608695652174

1057671,5,6305680175,"This is one of my favorite movies ever. It's hillaroius with lots of heart. It's one of those films where you acually laugh and cry during it. All of the actors ( Jennifer Tilly, Mitchel Anderson, Lori Petty, ""T.C"", Cynda Williams, and Serena Scott Thomas in particualar) turn in great performances. The movie is about a group of friends ( who just happen to mostly be gay and lesbian) try to deal with life, death, and hard ships. I f you want more indepth descrption of it go to the other dvd edition's reviews. But I deffinetly recomend you buy this edition. Other then a great movie there is a witty, funny commentary track by Lori Petty, Jennifer Tilly and the producer Steven Wolf. I was laughing out loud with some stories and comments they had about the making of the film and there experiences in sundance. Plus I believe the two of them were the standouts of the cast so it was even more enjoyable. There are also some deleted scenes and some bloopers ( very scarce) but better then nothing. Overall it's a very good dvd and I'd buy it anyway just for the greatness of the movie. For movie with a 250,000 budget ( seriously) it deserves top honorr.

1057672,5,6305680175,"What a pleasant surprise!  Honestly, I have had the feeling for many years that a move like ""Relax, It's just Sex"" would never be made here in America.  This movie is about a group of very intriguing good friends comprising of both gay and straight characters where, for once being gay is NOT the problem.  It is not a ""coming out"" or a ""is he or is she gay?"" film; everyone is very comfortable with his or her sexuality to the point that they are able to be very supportive of each other no matter what is going on in a particular person's life at any particular moment.

There are many very funny moments intermingled with ""real life"" serious situations, which are dealt with--including love, HIV infection, commitments, a miss-carriage, and a ""gay bashing"".  The ""gay bashing"" for me, really hit home.  For once, in this movie, the ""victim"" had opportunity to get immediate revenge and did so to the shock and horror of his friends who had problems dealing with his anger and his execution of revenge on one of the bashers.  (In all honestly if given the opportunity to get revenge on a ""gay bashing"" punk, I think that I would take advantage of that opportunity as the character, in the film, did!)
All of the actors in the film are great with Jennifer Tilly giving, to me, an Oscar winning performance-she's hysterically funny at one moment and ""heart breaking"" the next moment.  I just wish I had a group of friends as portrayed in this movie.
If you are into good films, buy this DVD",1087171200,10,1490,4.5335820895522385
1057673,5,6305680175,"I ran into this movie while channel-surfing on TV.  The introduction drew me in -- I couldn't figure out what they were doing with the people on a rotating stage in black and white and the corny 60's sounding announcer -- then suddenly the storyline went full-throttle into what could be some modern-day relationships in America.  The movie not only focussed on intimate relationships between lovers but the strong bond between friends.  I laughed and cried, was shocked and amazed, and thoroughly immersed throughout the entire movie.  I saw the movie a few more times on cable, then have rented it a few times to show other friends who have never heard of it.  Everyone loves it so I'm going to add it to my DVD collection to save having to rent it again!  I highly recommend it to anyone who has an open mind, who loves great dialogue, and who actually enjoys a good story in their movie.",1075334400,,891,4.572327044025157
1057674,3,6305680175,This movie definetly had a different plot then all the other gay films out there. A Gay man takes revenge on what the straights have been doing to him..

1057715,5,6305680175,"Admittedly, the title of this movie caught my attention first.  I figured it would be either something stupidly amusing, or ridiculously fictional. I was pleasantly proven wrong.  Through the course of the movie I found myself hurting for Vincey, yet with a strange sense of justification in what he did.  I cried for Tara, first for losing Gus, then for losing .. well, I won't ruin it for you.  I was crying happy-tears for Serena and Robin.  Never liked Megan anyway.  Buzz just grew on you; you couldn't help it.  Javi is like the little brother you wish you had.
This movie is one of the best times I've ever had watching TV.  It covered every emotion know to humanity, but fluidly, while still being incredibly believable.  It showed the positive, wonderful parts of homosexuality, yet didn't make it seem like one big party.  The relationships were real, and heartfelt, but the arguments weren't exagerated or overdone.  I relate very closely to Tara, the ""fag hag,"" so by the end of the movie I found myself yearning for more information on what happened to all the wonderful characters that I grew to know and love.  This is definately a movie that will quickly be purchased, but that will not-so-quickly be replaced.  A true gem for anyone who has friends ...",1048118400,,1269,4.713636363636364

1057719,3,6305680175,"RELAX... IT'S JUST SEX

(USA - 1997)

Aspect ratio: 1.85:1
Theatrical soundtrack: Dolby Stereo SR

The lives and loves of a group of friends - mostly gay, some straight - are placed under the microscope in writer-director P.J. Castellaneta's LA-based production, a dialogue-heavy comedy-drama which unfolds like a theatre-piece and is largely energized by a top-notch cast of formerly B-list players, deservedly elevated to lead status.

Adopting several points-of-view throughout, the movie opens on unlucky-in-love Mitchell Anderson (one-time regular on TV's ""Doogie Howser, M.D."") and his friendship with sharp-tongued Jennifer Tilly (BOUND, BRIDE OF CHUCKY, etc.) who's desperate to have a baby with her reluctant boyfriend (Timothy Paul Perez), whose brother (Eddie Garcia) has just been diagnosed with HIV. Garcia's illness brings the core group of characters together, including Cynda Williams and Serena Scott Thomas (Kristin's sister) as long-term lovers whose relationship is on the slide (""We haven't had good sex since Martina won Wimbledon!""), and Anderson's would-be boyfriend (T.C. Carson), an artist and radical thinker whose contentious views on the AIDS crisis allows Castellaneta to engage in a controversial debate about the relationship between HIV and AIDS and the effectiveness of current medical remedies; some viewers may want to hear more of these theories, while others will likely applaud Tilly when she advises Carson to: ""Shut the [bleep] up!"" It's lively stuff, and the characters are likeable and engaging. But the group's complacency is irrevocably shattered by a horrific encounter with gay-bashers midway through the movie, an event which concludes in a wholly unexpected (but no less sickening) manner, and which causes the entire group to re-evaluate their priorities and expectations, leading to a bittersweet conclusion.

Opening with a tongue-in-cheek introduction which pokes fun at straight viewers for their well-known aversion to gay themes in mainstream entertainment, the movie - which won the Audience Award at the Austin Gay and Lesbian Film Festival in 1998 - segues immediately into a joyous sex session between Anderson and a curiously uncredited super-hunk, which sets the tone for much of what follows. Overall, the movie offers a sweet but superficial examination of the gulf between sex and love, and demonstrates how a broad range of 'divided' communities - men/women, gay/straight, black/white - experience the same problems as every other community, without distinction.

Tilly dominates proceedings as an earth-mother figure whose love for her friends is matched only by her devotion to the man in her life, while Anderson makes a startlingly convincing transition from down-on-his-luck loser to born-again militant after life deals him a particularly unpleasant blow. Other cast members are superb - including Lori Petty (the eponymous TANK GIRL) and Joe Dallesandro-lookalike Billy Wirth (a model-turned-actor who recently branched out into directing) - and there are hilarious cameos from veterans Susan Tyrrell and Seymour Cassel (horrified that their erstwhile lesbian daughter [Scott Thomas] has suddenly taken up with a...a MAN!!) and Paul Winfield as an outrageous seen-it-all-before queen who takes Anderson under his wing during a moment of crisis.

The film derives most of its strength from the quality of the performances and dialogue, and while the production is clearly more technically polished than Castellaneta's previous micro-budgeted offering (TOGETHER ALONE [1991]), it's marred by Lon Magdich's slightly ragged-looking cinematography, possibly due to the director's use of cheap film stock.",1017273600,9,3672,5.689781021897811

J. Tilly's performance is outstanding in this movie that dared to put gays and straights in one storyline as friends and not adversaries!
