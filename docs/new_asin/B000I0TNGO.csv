8143108,2,B000I0TNGO,"Brilliant film however, most Asian DVDs are highly censored. Good example right here: The VHS copy of 'The Accompanist' is 111 minutes. This DVD is 102 minutes. For future reference, check and compare running times with American releases before buying Asian copies...",1475539200,,267,5.380952380952381
8143109,5,B000I0TNGO,"Five stars 10 times over... incredible film and amazing music, fantastic acting. This film haunted me for years since I saw it upon release 22 years ago and I found it. Music alone is worth the price, I also ordered the music CD.  If you like classical music this will be a treat, singing is angelic.
Music of Mozart, Schuman  and Berlioz.... the thing of beauty to behold.",1436400000,,373,4.470588235294118
8143110,5,B000I0TNGO,"If you know some amount of French and have an understanding of either WWII history or the music world that is enough to make
this film part of your collection. It is beautifully done. I don't happen to know much history. I know some French and a good deal about the classical music world, especially singers. So, you can judge if you would like it. Kind of depressing ending, but the film is about more than that. Very expressive, but not overdone acting.

I don't believe there are any subtitles to this film in any language.",1384732800,,526,4.479166666666667
