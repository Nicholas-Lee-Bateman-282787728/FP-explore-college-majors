2254288,5,B0007Z9QX0,"Im am SO excited for this DVD! I have been pushing for this for sometime now, and I think it's an awesome move on part by DISNEY!

2254291,1,B0007Z9QX0,Think twice before purchasing this DVD for your child. I was very surprised to see them talking about alternative lifestyles on this DVD. I had to discuss issues with my children that they otherwise weren't ready for! Thanks a lot Mickey!,1180224000,,238,4.829268292682927
2254292,2,B0007Z9QX0,"Can anyone tell me what songs are on this DVD that were actually shot on the show. For instance The pilot show for ""The New MMC"" in which they did ""Got No Shame"" by Brother Cane or perhaps When they did ""Little Miss Can't Be Wrong by the Spin Doctors? Any help here would be grately appeciated.

Thanks",1165622400,,302,4.206896551724138
2254293,1,B0007Z9QX0,"uhmmm first of all, why is it just about three of them??? there's kerry russel , and Jc chasez on there also that's kind of wrong....the only talent on there is christina and the other two can't sing...but they can sure dance...wow wut a skill.",1147651200,2,244,4.444444444444445
2254294,3,B0007Z9QX0,"This DVD is really great, not only you can see the best moments from Britney, Justin & Christina, but you can also enjoy some of the old episodes of the Mickey Mouse Club!",1124236800,,171,4.212121212121212
2254295,3,B0007Z9QX0,"This DVD is good to buy if you were a fan of the show like I was. If you are buying it to see the best of the mentioned artists at work you will be disappointed. There are four shows that only show a little of Brit, Justin and Christina at work. What you do see is a 2-3 min feature of the three in three diff episodes. Like what they do daily at their homes and for fun at that time. I'm angry also over the fact that JC Chasez isn't featured. Still it is nice to watch the show that I used to love. I only wish that they would come out with the complete show like the old one did.",1123718400,3,582,3.7398373983739837
2254296,1,B0007Z9QX0,"I thought this DVD was going to be highlights from only them and their featured skits.  I was completely disappointed to find out it was episodes involving everyone.  Granted I used to watch MMC everyday so it was nice, but not when you are expecting something completely different.  I don't think I saw a skit without Jimmy Fallon on his best of SNL DVD.",1122422400,3,355,4.515625
2254297,3,B0007Z9QX0,"Yes everyone. You will be disappointed, and I highly recommend you rent this and not buy it. As stated in other reviews, there is one performance of Britney and Justin singing ""I Feel For You"" and one performance of Christina singing ""I Have Nothing"". They are barely in any skits, and we get hometown profiles of them, which is nothing exciting. However, I would recommend watching this DVD to see some of the other talented mouseketeers. Keri Russell appears in one of the better skits, and also showcases her dancing in 2 numbers. Jc Chasez and Ryan Gosling are also part of the series, but not shown as much. Disney should be releasing full seasons on DVD, and if you're going to say the best of Britney, Justin, and Christina, they should have put all of their performances/skits on the dvd, not full episodes where they are barely in it. They also should have included JC and Keri Russell in the title. It's a little disrespectful to them, when they were clearly just as talented.",1121990400,26,986,4.64
2254298,1,B0007Z9QX0,"From a big JT, Brit, and X-tina fan:  This DVD is soooo disappointing.  The DVD is comprised of whole episodes of MMC- and very little of the episodes has Britney, Justin, or Christina featured.  There is only one song where Brit and Justin sing (a duet), and only one where Christina sings.  Other than that, all they basically show are lame ""hometown profiles"" which last about 60 seconds each.  You get better content from a ""Behind the Music"" or ""Driven"" episode.  There's even some really heavy stuff about teens committing suicide that has absolutely NOTHING to do with Britney, Justin, or Christina.  Lame, lame, lame, and disappointing.  I think the total on-screen time of real content is about 12 minutes.  Save your money!",1121644800,7,733,4.894308943089431
2254299,2,B0007Z9QX0,"Four epsidoes from JUST season 6?  I agree with most of these reviews in that Disney is just trying to jump on the Britney, Justin and Christina bandwagon.  This is such a disappointment to those who watched, worked on, and truly loved the show.  The real highlights of MMC were the other talented cast members, who were not featured.  Dedicated fans know that Britney, Justin and Christina were never the most popular 'teers--why create a DVD just around them?

On the plus side, this DVD features two of the better Season 6 skits--Generation Gap Shoppping and Everybody's a Winner (none of which include Brit, Justin or Christina).  And, it has some good shots of 'teer siblings and friends like Trace, Jamie Lynn, Laura Lynn and Rachael (if this is interesting to anyone).

This DVD will flop, and it deserves to.  Disney needs to get their act together and create something that would embrace what the show really was--or not do anything at all.",1121299200,2,949,4.779141104294479
2254300,3,B0007Z9QX0,"I have watched it. It was a real blast from the past. However, I wish that they would just start with Season #1, and released the season as a boxed set.

Instead of dance number and skits, they have 4 complete episodes from Season #6. I thought that the segment on Teen Suicide and Depression was a little bit of a downer, and there should have been a parental warning, because it does deal with discussions of drug abuse, and homosexuality.

If they were going to do a highlight of just Christina, Britney and Justin, it would have been more fun to just have THEM signing and dancing, and not FULL episodes.

I think that this DVD is about 7 or 8 years too late.

If Disney does release the DVDs as full seasons, I would purchase those, but no more ""best of"" DVDs for us.",1121126400,3,772,4.267123287671233
2254301,1,B0007Z9QX0,"I loved the New Mickey Mouse Club from season 1, even as new episodes were showing while I was still in high school.  I was very excited to see that Disney was releasing this, even if it were only  a few episodes based around three of the many talented kids on the show.  The fond memories I have that revolve around this show...However, the four episodes on this DVD did not highlight the talent of Christina, Britney and Justin or the rest of the cast for that matter.  All the musical numbers (except one) were prerecorded from the MMC concert. The skits were not some of the best, but Keri Russel fans will probably get a kick out of seeing her in many of the episodes.  I hope people who buy this DVD don't judge the entire show on these four episodes.",1121126400,10,757,4.302816901408451
2254302,4,B0007Z9QX0,"This show ran for about six to seven seasons.  In those seasons, plenty of people came and went, all of whom were amazingly talented.  Britney, Justin and Christina were only on there for the last two seasons.  I beleive that some poeple who have never seen the show before are going to be surprised to watch it and find that besides Christina, who had an amazing voice, Justin and Britney were pretty average.  WHat I hope happens is that the tiny glimpse of the rest of the cast members will stir enough curiousity that the seasons will be released indivdually.  And, lastly, while Britney and the other two are super famous, it's a pain to see Keri Russell, Ryan Gosling and JC Chasezs completely left out.  As a matter of fact, those of us who watched the show back then, remember a time when the screaming girls were screaming for JC and Keri, two of the most popular cast members on the show.",1120435200,,898,4.478527607361963
2254303,5,B0007Z9QX0,"Who cares about the whole season?  Christina was the best part of that show, my only wish is that they made copies without Brit., she really is nasty.  LONG LIVE XTINA!",1120003200,4,168,4.387096774193548
2254304,2,B0007Z9QX0,"Where is the whole series?  From Season 1 to Season 7.  I feel gypped.  I want my MMC!!!  Give me the whole thing from Brandy Brown & Jason Minor, to Tony Lucca, JC Chasez, Ilana Miller, Keri Russell, to Britney and Justin!",1117411200,8,223,4.238095238095238
2254305,3,B0007Z9QX0,"Hey, Disney!  I'm sure fans of this version of the show will be thrilled to have this DVD, but what about those of us who fondly remember the 1977 ""New Mickey Mouse Club"", now visible only every few years or so on Vault Disney.  This colorful, well-produced, dazzlingly choreographed and designed version of the NMMC boasted an energetic, super-talented cast as well, including future ""Facts of Life""-ers Lisa Whelchel and Julie Piekarski.  WHY Has Disney passed this terrific show by?  Those of us in our late 30's and early 40's have disposable income, too!  Bring on the Disco Mice!",1115510400,7,585,4.8686868686868685
2254306,1,B0007Z9QX0,"Those who like this version of the show are in error. The show from the '50's would be much better for you and I know what you need. You need to purchase ""The Walt Disney Treasures The Mickey Mouse Club"". It's the first full week, the week of October 3, 1955,  of the one hour shows.  The '50's ""Mickey Mouse Club"" mouseketeers had talented kids on it,some professional and some not. However, whether they were professionals or not, you'd not be able to notice because they acted like regular kids. Walt wanted talented kids who would just be kids on the show. Sure, when they sang and dance they did so in front of a camera, but they never seemed to play  to the camera. The kids who were mouseketeers ranged in age from about eight to about 14. All of them were very talented yet, even the ones who were professional, didn't act professional. They just acted like average kids from the '50's. Even as they were performing, they were, of course, in front of the camera, however, never played up to the camera. They were just having fun with their talent. There was a LOT of innocense on the original show including the featuring of Walt Disney cartoons. I don't believe that the ""MMC"" ever had cartoons with Donald Duck, Mickey Mouse, etc. In fact, before ""The Mousecartoon"" for the day one or several of the mouseketeers would stand on stage, in front of the Mickey Mouse Treasure Mine and sing a song to inform the kids watching that it was now time for the mousecartoon. Then they would turn around, say several words, a shelf within the Mickey Mouse treasure mine would open and one of the mouseketeers would reach inside and read from a slip of paper what the mousecartoon for the day was. The ""MMC"" just didn't have the look of innocense as the original ""Mickey Mouse Club"" had. Also, why no Mouseketeer ears? Was the show ashamed of the ears? The closeing of the original show was where many of the mouseketeers would be on risers and very reverently sing ""The Mickey Mouse Club Alma Mater"". That's where the audience is told how much that their liked. The host Jimmie Dodd, would always tell the audience that. If a Kid hadn't been given that positive input all day long or all week long (I believe that the ""MMC"" was only on one day per week), he or she would be told that they are liked. Good positive input. There are so very many reasons why the original show was far better than the ""MMC"".  There are so very many reasons that made the original show far superior and seem far more innocent than the ""MMC"". Honestly, it would have been far FAR better for the viewing audience if the original show from the '50's were shown during the same time slot and time period that the ""MMC"" was on the air.  All would have been much better off, including you. I doubt that Walt Disney would have approved of the ""MMC"". For that reason alone, along with the various reasons that I mentioned above, to enjoy this show now is an error and to have enjoyed this show in the past was an  error. I'm saddened that The Walt Disney Company is releasing it on DVD. Does anyone at all care about what Walt Disney would think when something is released?",1114732800,5,3143,4.438474870017331
2254307,2,B0007Z9QX0,"Being a true MMC fan from season 1 to the end I'm very disappointed! I would rather have all the episodes instead of skits highlighting just THREE MMC'ers (who were only in the last two seasons mind you). I think if they would want to produce a product, produce one that is worth it! Or, if you want to feature the stars of the 90's MMC why not also include Golden Award winner Keri Russell, fellow NSYNCer JC Chasez, actor Dale Godboldo, and ""The Party"" members?? To me it's a tease, and not what the MMC fans truley want. That's just my opinion though, and you can take it for what its worth.",1114300800,15,594,4.265486725663717
2254308,3,B0007Z9QX0,"It seems like a huge marketing stunt to make a DVD totally devoted to these three mouseketeers and not create complete season DVD's from this run of the Mickey Mouse Club.  Britney, Justin, and Christina were only mouseketeers in '93 and '94 and there is still a tremendous fan base of people who watched the show from '89-'94 and who would like to see more than just these three spotlighted.  I wish that Disney was releasing an ""entire first season,"" all the way up through an ""entire 6th season"" in '94 for the people who just want to see the most famous 'teer alumni.  I am sure that this DVD will make them more money, but it seems to discount the other fabulous talent that made the show what it was.  I hope that eventually entire season DVD's are released from the MMC.  It was a fabulous part of a lot of our childhoods.  They just don't make shows like this anymore!  :)",1112486400,42,880,4.361963190184049

8054620,3,B0007Z9QX0,"As an MMC fan, I was so pleased to find this - but feel no effort was put into making this dvd. It was not edited out in anyway, so 4x you watched the theme song, 4x the closing credits etc.  It was basically approx 4 full length episodes, which featured segments on Brittney, Justin & Christina in their home towns.  Other than that, it was DEFINITELY NOT A BEST OF- as the rest of the dvd hardly showed them.  It ran random segments not even featuring mousekeeters, when there was plenty of footage to chose from (which could have highlighted what it was sold as)
P.S. Don't know why it says Tiffini Hale (under the name of the dvd) as she wasn't in this at all.
