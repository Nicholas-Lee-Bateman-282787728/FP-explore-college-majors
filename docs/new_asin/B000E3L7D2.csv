8105124,4,B000E3L7D2,"Finally we find out the true overall connection between Gram and Vestimona! No flashback, but its great to finally hear their total backstory and what a fight during the explanation! I was real worried that we would never get a good explanation of their past, and then to top it off they give us a kiss...nice! Not nice...Vestimonas decision to ""clear things up"" instead of going  with Gram. Hopefully it will make the ending better with another reunion. Although their has been a lot of heart in all the previous volumes, Volume 5 by far pulled the strings the tightest, leading us into the final volume. Will Yagami be back in the final volume? I sure hope so. His departure was odd to me in the whole scheme of things and that odd bit of writing was the only reason I didn't give this volume 5 stars. I think he will come back but if he doesnt, then I think it would have been better if he had given his life for the crew as the decoy. At least he would have gone out with a bang and a way fitting to his backround as a former soldier. Anyway, these things considered along with the great action and fun, had me really liking this volume. Im not sure how this series is going to end, but it sure had a nice head of steam charging into the final volume.",1171411200,,1255,4.2510460251046025
