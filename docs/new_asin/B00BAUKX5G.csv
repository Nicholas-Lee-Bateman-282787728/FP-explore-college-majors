8564953,2,B00BAUKX5G,"Mr. Messano (WAS) a really good musician singer song writer in his day. Unfortunately for a few musicians, Bob has been playing just average as of late and something has happened to his vocals to the point he should really leave that up to someone else. Not trying to be mean but when it hurts to listen to then it's time for a change. Sadly he has allowed his head to expand to a larger size then his audience and therefore he has begun to fade away. Last we saw of Bob Messano he was telling stories of tormented relationships on stage while few bar patrons either drank more or just left. Bob, it's time to call it quits and leave folks with the memories of the good ol days and not the sad lonely man we see today. Peace",1400544000,,724,4.178571428571429
