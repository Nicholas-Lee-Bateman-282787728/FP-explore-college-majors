8706682,5,B00UGQTERI,"This is my all time favorite Disney movie and this particular edition has some bonus features that include some deleted and extended scenes that really were fantastic to see and in my opinion worth the extra money. The movie has a little bit of history, animation, live action, magic and is great for the whole family. I have loved this movie since I was a child and it still has great themes and story that are timeless. The movie is just under 2 hours in length and stars Angela Lansbury (Murder She Wrote) and David Tomlinson (Mr. Banks from Mary Poppins) and several adorable young children. Will keep you on your toes and laughing a lot. If you have an old bed with knobs your kids and grand kids will be playing with them after this movie.",1472428800,,745,4.445255474452555
