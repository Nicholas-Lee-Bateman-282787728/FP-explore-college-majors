3666472,2,B001KMB772,"I went into this one expecting..nothing.  I usually will watch a Bai Ling film, and then ask myself why, surely it is not for the obligatory [...] shots..surely.  This one was a bit better than most anything else she has done in a ""star"" capacity.  The computer generated effects though obvious where not that bad, and the action sequences where fun and well shot.  Bai Ling has not yet reached the level of 'actress' yet, but does pull off about 75% of this flick pretty well.  Unfortunately her talent, or lack there of does show through in enough scenes to reinforce the rumors of her inabilities.  Costuming was a hoot. Bai Ling spent most of the film running around looking like an stand in double for Tomb Raider, and I thought the colorful make up detracted from the character.
All in all this was not a complete stinker...but it did fall to pieces in the last fifteen minutes...it was still entertaining.",1234224000,,912,4.633540372670807

The Good Things
*Video and sound quality are not bad.
*Includes some extras; commentaries, some featurettes, and trailers.
*The movie has some very slick special effects.  They're not ""LOTR"" quality or anything, but they are very vivid and imaginative, without taking total dominance over the film.
*Production design is good.  Some of the settings are impressive.  Costumes are cool.
*Photography is not bad.
*Story is not bad, but seems a bit long and convoluted.
*Characters are not bad; acting is good.

The Bad Things
*Nothing particuarly deep or complex.
*Not for the squeamish; contains bloody violence, sex, and nudity.

If you're looking for a relatively mindless sci-fi flick with cool (but not very well-detailed) special effects and sex appeal, then this movie should prove to be somewhat satisfying.  It's generally like a cross between ""Barb Wire"" and ""Immortal."" It has decent quality and a number of bonus features.  But, unless you're a sci-fi or Bai Ling fan, you might want to rent this first; I'm sure it's not for everybody.",1233273600,,1071,5.0397727272727275
3666474,3,B001KMB772,"There has been a lot of comic book to film adaptations for the past several years. Being a film based on a comic book called ""DNA Hacker Chronicles"" and a joint international effort between Asian and Western filmmakers, of course I was immediately drawn to ""The Gene Generation"". Why not? My expectations were very low and it stars sexy Chinese actress Bai Ling and the director is the comic book's creator; Pearry Teo--so how bad can it really get? I like Bai Ling and I like science fiction, so I decided to give it a shot.

In a post-apocalyptic future, science has created a device that can easily manipulate human D.N.A.--this device can either heal or cause abominations. When a group of profiteers/extremists intends to use the device as a weapon, Christian (Alec Newman) decides to steal the device to keep it from being used by the wrong people. Meanwhile, Michelle (Bai Ling), a beautiful assassin who works for the authorities to kill DNA hackers is pulled into her family's drama when her brother Jackie (Parry Shen) runs afoul of gambling debts and some hackers whose modus operandi is to mess with a victim's DNA. No matter how hard Michelle attempts to steer her brother from trouble, it just finds him and he always relies on her to bail him out. However, this time, Jackie may have gone too far as he crosses Michelle's own employers. Can Michelle save him and herself one last time?

I have very mixed feelings about this film. It has very attractive visuals, the CGI EFX looks like they came straight from an Xbox 360 and CGI fan boys will be somewhat satisfied. The film looks very cool, the CGI generated set designs are very moody and atmospheric. The costumes and characters looked like they came straight from a ""cyberfunk"" anime feature. There is one villain who looks like a ""Sephiroth"" (from Final Fantasy 7) rip-off and Michelle is so alluringly sexy but at the same time, looks very lethal. The story's main premise isn't really that bad, it has elements of corruption, social class, greed, love and family. There are also some creative elements--a typewriter is retooled to work as a computer, the ghettos have a filthy yet advanced look. (I loved the flying Chinese-inspired ships) and well, there is even splattering blood and some gore, not to mention, sex and nudity.

Ok, so I basically named most of the cool stuff I look for in a sci-fi film, but the problems of the film begin with its very uneven direction. Some plot elements seemed a little too rushed, it felt like Pearry Teo was in over his head trying to fit all the elements of the comic into one 96 minute film. Sequences seem to jump around at times, and lacks the necessary groundwork. All the elements seem really cool but the screenplay by Zhang Pingli and Keith Collea was inconsistent. The script is also a little dry and too obligatory.

As for the action sequences, some looked quite cool, while others were mediocre. There is a very cool scene when Michelle was surrounded by gunmen, and the way she dispatches her attackers was seemingly inspired by ""Gun-Kata"". (From Equilibrium and Ultraviolet). It was rather obvious that most of the film's budget went to the visually cool set designs and costumes that the fight scenes were sacrificed; some fights looked better than others though. The need for multiple angles and perspective camerawork is definitely needed to make the action hard-hitting and exciting--a low budget did hurt this needed practice. But to Bai Ling's credit, it did look like she did most of her own stunts. There is a lot of cool posturing that complements its cool visuals.

The acting for the most part is full of human angst. I don't think I saw anyone else smile aside from Bai Ling after she had sex with Alec Newman's character Christian. Bai Ling has a magnetic presence, at times she looks trashy yet but still remains so alluringly seductive that her nude scenes are definitely one of the film's saving grace. Her costumes and make up give her character a lot of personality, and I have to say, her lethal sexy character is enough to keep me glued to my seat. The supporting cast does a very mediocre job, given with the little factors they were given to work with. Parry Shen acts with the same style as with his other flicks and Faye Dunaway has a special guest appearance as the villainous Josephine.

Overall, ""the Gene Generation"" has all the elements sci-fi aficionados would look for; great visuals, a very sexy and cool heroine, sex and nudity, blood and violence, a decent premise but sadly it didn't do much with everything it had pitched in. The film is very superficial, and could have done a lot better with a more experienced director or as an anime series. I do appreciate that the filmmakers seemed to have their hearts in the right place. Sadly, after all is said and done, the lasting impression it leaves is just how seductively sexy Bai Ling really is--the rest is forgettable. Bai Ling's raw sexual appeal may well be enough to take this film out of the unwatchable list.

Recommended ONLY to Bai Ling fanboys and a Rental for everybody else.

3666475,5,B001KMB772,"A stark cyber-punk movie that blows multi-million dollar boring period pieces away with it's incredible harsh cold beauty.

Anyone who has played Fallout 3 will understand how the harsh, cold and ugly can be amazingly beautiful.  This movie was shot LONG before FO 3 ever released a screenshot.  FYI - it looks NOTHING like FO 3 - just has the same abilty to find beauty where most would never even look.

A deep finely crafted plot with actors working far above their capacity.  Bai Ling becomes a top-notch actor in the role of Michelle.  She is a duel-edged sword.  A cold-blooded Assasin but also the protagonist you can't help but identify with.

Special FX and CGI make the movie look like it cost about 100 times more than it did.  Truly spectacular and were it a bigger movie it should at least been nominated for cinematography and would have easily won Special FX.

Sound track - well it's to die for.  I was dancing in the aisle at the end of the movie when the credits rolled to CombiChrist's 'Red'

All of the mastery of this movie can be credited to the young director who had already picked up many Independent film critic awards before the ripe old age of 25.

Bai Ling's  performance shows such compassionate angst... such cold blooded indifference to being a semi sanctioned ""hitman"", (not to mention that odd but eerily attractive make-up) that it again, haunts me. I like the romance that develops in such a backward way...that is she is the ""tough-guy"" that eventually allows vulnerability to allow  emotional attraction to give-in to suppressed passion. Some unexplained fate that happened to the parents of the heroin and her reckless younger brother is at once a bond and a point of contention but the two siblings obviously love  each other, however not enough to overcome impulsiveness on her brother's part and her emotional concern for him. (Spoiler?) Then we have this killer, whose only regret after a hit, is that she has to shower off the blood... who weeps with authentic despair over her brother's habitual foolishness. In the end we look over a Blade Runner landscape (literally and figuratively) that calls us back to experience it again and some inexplicable time in the future, again.

3666491,1,B001KMB772,"I decided to watch this on a whim when I saw that Alec Newman - who was serviceable in the Dune miniseries on Sci-Fi - was in it.  Big mistake on my part.

First, let me describe what little the movie gets right:

Alec Newman actually does a decent job with what he's given.  The dialogue is stilted, and the entire movie's premise is given via his voiceover in the first few minutes, but he does just enough to make it all not-quite-horrible.  His portrayal of exiled DNA scientist Christian is passable.  He manages to convey just enough earnestness and desperation to make me want to see more of him.  Unfortunately, despite getting a starring credit, he only shares a couple of scenes with Bai Ling's assassin Michelle.

Another positive surprise was the character Jackie, portrayed by Parry Shen.  He was very convincing playing Michelle's immature, screw-up brother.

And that's about it.  The flaws are numerous and simply overwhelm the few positives.

Most glaring, to me, is the complete lack of coherence with the plot.  DNA hacking itself is only mentioned in passing, and its mechanics are never really explained.  Transcoders - the movie's mcguffin - somehow magically damage the people using them, by turning them into writhing tentacle monsters.  None of this is sufficiently explained, and, unfortunately, the DNA hacking premise is largely swept away after the opening monologue.

Instead of a movie that smartly explores what it would mean to actually tinker with the fabric of humanity, we're given a post-apocalyptic story of a loser (Jackie) gambling too much and running afoul of a loanshark, leaving his sister (Michelle) to clean up after him.  It's all just a waste of time, as it follows a predictable course and barely touches on the sci-fi premise.  The bulk of this movie could have taken place in any modern metropolis and it would have been the same.

Visually, the film is a mess.  The special effects are on par with Hercules: The Legendary Journeys, which is just embarrassing for a film created in 2007.  Everything screams bad CG, from the inexplicable Viking/Chinese inspired airships, to the cityscape, to glass cracking and blood splurting.  And it's not just that the effects are bad, but the designs are horrid as well.

Mounds of trash litter the streets for no real reason.  The airships and city walls all strive to look organic, which seems counter-intuitive to me given this society's supposed paranoia about clean DNA.  In any event, there's never a sense of culture presented here.  Bai Ling's Michelle looks stereotypically cyberpunk, while the Hayden's lair looks decidedly steampunk.  Disparate looks and visual themes are mashed together haphazardly, leaving me to believe that the only barrier to inclusion was whether something looked cool or not, rather than if it fit with the story.

The end result is that the movie never feels like it exists in a plausible place.  It's very obvious that everything happens in a handful of sets, none of which feel like they belong in a realistic city.  Time wasted on Jackie's attempts to outwit the loanshark could have been better spent hashing out the environment.

Other reviews mentioned Blade Runner, which is laughable.  Blade Runner never forgot its premise.  There's no Roy Batty here, no exploration into what humanity *is*, no duality between protagonist and villain.  Instead, we're left with a muddled mess of a movie, which is only confident in telling the base story of a gambling addict screwing up one time too many in the most cliche manner possible.",1368835200,,3561,4.969543147208122

The weak plot, characters & cast, script and CGI never added up to anything due to the rookie writer/director who failed to create a believable alternative cyberpunk world.  Has-been actress Faye Dunaway is onscreen for probably less than thirty seconds -- most of the time she is merely voice over for a CGI DNA mutation doing Oogie Boogie. The only thing to see out of morbid curiousity is the notorious bad girl Bai Ling for her usual antics and nudity. Her ""love interest"" with the DNA engineer isn't believable.  Her sisterly concern for her worthless kid brother is also laughable.  The actors who portrayed these two men in her life were a couple of the worst  I've ever seen.

In a post-apocalyptic future, DNA hackers are stealing other people's DNA in order to escape their ravaged planet. Provided you're rich and disease free (hence the hacking), you can buy passage on a spaceship headed for parts unknown where the conditions are more hospitable. If you're not a hacker, you're most likely an assassin hired by corporations to take out the hackers. Michelle (Ling) is such a person. She's damn good at what she does and for good reason: she's trying to raise enough money to buy her and her ne'er-do-well brother Jackie (Perry Shen) 2 tickets out of this hellhole. Things go according to plan until Jackie, a compulsive gambler, loses $150,000 to a creepy mobster. With the mobster's goons coming to collect, a desperate Jackie robs his and Michelle's next door neighbor in order to make a quick buck. What he doesn't realize is that the neighbor, a scientist, used to work for the corporation that caused everything to go to hell. They're not only looking for him, but for a bracelet he designed capable of restoring the head doctor (Oscar winner Faye Dunaway) back to health. Well, Jackie finds it and without revealing anything else, I'll just say that everyone - Michelle, the scientist, the mobster, Michelle's bosses, the evil corporation - want to get their hands on the bracelet and use it for their own means. It should go without saying that a bloody battle ensues at the end of which only one person will be left standing holding the bracelet.

It's that last film that has haunted Dunaway her whole career. So ashamed of it is she, she refuses to talk about it in any interviews. Well, how is she going to live with herself after appearing in this as - I kid you not - a skeleton covered in slimy worms for nearly the whole film? Surely, she realizes Joan Crawford ended her career by appearing in a string of crappy horror B-movies. Thanks to this movie the Crawford Curse will continue to haunt her. On a much lighter note, let's talk about Bai Ling. There's something about her that really sticks out to me. She's gorgeous, her heavy accent is sexy and she always wears skimpy, low-cut clothing. Her costumes for this film are no different as she runs around in a skin-tight leather outfit. She's the main reason a lot of people will see this movie, but she's not enough. It's too bad that her first leading role had to be in something like this since, like Shen, she deserves better too. Oh well, at least on the commentary track they get the props they deserve from director Pearry Teo. All 3 sound like they at least had some fun making the movie. I doubt audiences will feel the same.",1291420800,4,5413,6.475138121546961
3666500,2,B001KMB772,"This science fiction movie has a good idea but the plot and characters are poorly developed. The trailer made the movie appear to be a spin-off of blade runner or 5th element. It's not. It's a bland disappointment. The legend Faye Dunaway comes out in the movie for less than 5 minutes. When she does come out she is covered in CGI snakes. Somewhere along the way she turned into a snake mutant. And it is really grotesque to look at. The other problem is that several reviewers stated the only redeeming aspect of the movie was the CGI effects and cinematography. That is far from the truth. This movie is not like 5th element, Blade Runner,Dune, Blade, Underworld, The Breed, or even Hitchhikers guide to the galaxy. This movie is like watching an X-box video game for two hours. And that is really sad considering the best science fiction movies were made in the 80s prior to the invention of X-box. You would think that by the new millennium the special effects would have improved. The acting is bland but not horrible. You will feel as if you are watching a made for TV movie. I suggest you rent this for as little money as possible before you purchase. I doubt you will like it. And I can hardly even recommend this movie to science fiction followers.

3666501,3,B001KMB772,"Gene Generation is a good effort at a B-budget cyberpunk flick and being a fan of a genre I can appreciate that.

The set and scenery design is excellent and remains convincing also when filmed up close, which is rare. The art direction and especially the ""moldy tech"" feel is excellent and gives the film character. I really liked the character of Jackie, an antithesis to the normally superhuman characters found in this genre. Unfortunately the script feels like it was pieced together from three different versions. There are problems with continuity and things working differently from how they were explained before. While there are definite highlights in the dialogue and actor scenes, it is not enough to fix the disjointed feel of the story. As for actors, the main star Bai Ling is also the weakest link in the cast. Compared to even most of the side characters, her performance is stiff and shallow. She was clearly chosen for her looks (which are beyond reproach).

All in all, I give them a star for good effort, a star for art direction and set design and finally a third star for the script that while broken, still manages to rise above the average of this genre, largely due to ingenious use of character confrontations. If the story had made sense or the acting would have been more consistently good, I'd have easily given it one more star. In the stinking cesspool of B-scifi films, this is definitely one of the better ones. Then again, I am easy to please.

Note that the picture quality is surprisingly poor for a DVD-release. I wreaks havoc with the darker scenes, especially when showing someone's face up close.",1271980800,,1637,4.757042253521127

The CGI was pretty good and Bai Ling wasn't as bad as usual in this sci-fi action wanna be.  The spurting blood scenes looked like they were produced as a high school project, the story was uninteresting, the characters were not likable enough to make you care.

I found this listing purely to warn others. By any possible use of any human standard, or alien standard, this movie was awful.

The plot was laughable, the characters were absolutely sophomoric, and the special effects were primitive. It was so boring to watch that we turned it off halfway through and wished we had done so a lot sooner.

It was so bad, even beer didn't help. Bai Ling tried but it was hopeless. Do not buy, rent, or watch this movie. You will waste your money.",1248566400,3,903,4.319526627218935

Look out for the club scene with Combichrist. The video for ""Get  your body beat"" is included on the DVD. It's righteous!

If you relate to Mr. Ellenwood, this movie isn't for you. For the rest of us . . . Get a tub of popcorn ready and dim the lights.  Lighten up and enjoy The Gene Generation.

Its problem lies where all films problems lie and that's with the script. It's absolutely inane, absurd and makes virtually no sense at all even within the world it attempts to create. The actors seem to be working hard with what they are given but there's only so much they can accomplish with this tripe. Bai Ling does her best--meaning she fills out her sexy costume and strips down for a couple of nude scenes, and Parry Shen (best known for his brilliant performance in BETTER LUCK TOMORROW) gives his all trying to make his role of the troublesome younger brother interesting. In the end however, everyone is defeated by Singaporean director Pearry Teo's adaptation of his own comic book. You'd think that with this much control over the end product Teo would have been able to produce more than this confused and confusing flick that serves only to make the viewer wish they were watching BLADERUNNER.",1245196800,7,1114,4.6313131313131315
3666508,3,B001KMB772,"GENE GENERATION is an average film that valiantly strains to be more than average, but sadly it fails.

I was trapped by this movie in the first half hour or so. It was mesmerizing, the story was developing slowly, but I was just hooked. The characters were great, unfolding a story of a troubled relationship between a woman and her little brother who just couldn't get out of bad habits and being in the wrong place at the wrong time. The whole DNA hacking main plot wasn't opened up yet, entirely, but I was waiting with anticipation.

And it fell. Right on its face. I didn't feel like anything opened up, and the ending just didn't set off the spark that the beginning had promised. My hopes were dashed, while my excitement had already wandered off some thirty or forty minutes prior anyway.

On top of that, the whole premise of the film, this crazy DNA Hacking concept, wasn't explored to anywhere near the potential such an idea could have been. It was glazed over quickly, pushed to the side to highlight our protaganist's Michelle's dilemmas. And yeah, she's a good character acted out wonderfully by Bai Ling, but I didn't decide to watch this film because of either of those things -- my curiosity was piqued by this whole DNA HACKER / DNA ASSASSIN deal. I feel a little cheated.

The imagery and style was done well, but by the end I wasn't wowed. It was like Bladerunner meets all the 90s cyberpunk films it inspired plus a digital media arts students profile work slammed together. Maybe I'm being a little harsh because of my disappointment in the film fizzling out, but unfortunately I don't feel inspired to re-watch it again anytime soon to decide which it is.

That being said, I would watch it again for the characters and the acting, just not anytime soon. Definitely worth the rental, more than well worth adding to your collection if you're like me and enjoy piling up DVDs of varying quality for the fun of it.",1244678400,7,1936,4.583815028901734
3666509,3,B001KMB772,"You know you're in trouble when you hear such scientific exposition as ""genetic manipulation"". With such broad stroke terms, anything is possible. For instance, a device that makes DNA Hacking so easy that even your mom could use it. Or worse, it could end up in the wrong hands -- your dad. And they might create the worst of all possible abominations -- a brother with a gambling habit. And then they'll die and leave you to look after your brother.

Michelle is a DNA Hacking assassin whose name is not nearly as interesting as her war paint and outfit. Her day job is ridding a post-apocalyptic world of DNA Hackers. Her night job is keeping her idiot brother out of trouble. With their parents dead, Michelle has her work cut out for her.

Gene Generation would have made for a great Sci-Fi channel release. For TV, it's production values would have been considered top-notch. As a feature film, however, it feels like a B-movie that got a pay raise. The cinematography and art direction are the highlight of this movie. That, and Bai Ling, who I must admit made it easy for me to keep my eyes on the screen. There are a few director's tricks that jump out. For instance, watch the freeze-frame scene of Bai Ling kicking a guy into a window. Everything comes to a halt except the window which slowly cracks and shatters. Sweet.

But all in all, the acting is cariciaturish, and the story not terribly interesting.  But thanks to Bai Ling it's an easy watch, so who am I to complain?",1243987200,4,1487,4.537313432835821

1)Get a big cauldron.  2)Drop in copies of Blade Runner, Laura Croft, and some of the miniatures from 'Krull'.  Mix haphazardly.  3)throw in pointless (gratuitious) nude scenes then simmer in a dank, dark place for two hours. You now have the equivalent of Gene Generation.

While the idea behind the movie shows some minor promise, the constant sub-plots and generic fight scenes throw the whole film off center.  Even the obvious physical talents of Bai Ling don't save this film, despite her best efforts. The special effects supporting the film's pseudo-science are second-rate; it looks like a ball of worms or tentacles attached themselves to the actors.

This is a B-movie, and a poor example at that. If not for the driving music score and the sheer beauty of Bai Ling, it wouldn't even rate that high.

It doesn't look like it was made to fit into the Academy, and that's well enough -- not every film needs to cater to the Academy.

This film is a brave work, imminently watchable (by adults, namely. Notice the rating). It's definitely a likable work, which could be regarded as being pretty rare, in it genre. For all the challenges of the work, it's never obnoxious.

It is no mystery why it was delayed for 2 years and then straight to DVD...and good luck to the director in getting any work in Hollywood with this shiner on your resume. The CG is a strange combination of painful and hilarious.
