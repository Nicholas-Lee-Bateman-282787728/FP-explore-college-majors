818490,4,6304258984,"Sure, the plot is so full of holes that you could run a freight train through 'em, but who cares?  Once this roller coaster gets going, it doesn't stop for anything.  Excellent performances from absolutely  everyone, especially Cage, Harris, and of course, Connery.  Highly  entertaining, even if this is the 500th time we've seen psychotic Marines  destroying everything in sight.",912729600,,381,5.266666666666667
818491,5,6304258984,"This is my favorite Action movie of all time. Connery is great as always.  Cage plays a reluctant hero who really comes across as reluctant. You can  tell he doesn't want the job he is forced in to. There is also sympathy for  Ed Harris's character. I found myself hoping that he would succeed in  getting his demands. Great action sequences, great dialog, Just GREAT!!  END",906681600,,374,4.606060606060606

818563,3,6304258984,This is a good action movie.  Ed Harris plays a pretty good villain.  He takes over Alcatraz Island and threatens to blow up San Francisco.  Sean Connery was enjoying a rather productive phase of his career in this.  And Nicolas Cage plays  an agent trying to stop the terrorists.  It has plenty of action.  There are a few things that you cant really think bout.  In the movie if you do it doesn't really make sense.  But other wise it is  still a very good movie.,1516233600,,465,4.3023255813953485

818569,5,6304258984,"Very good.  Goes over some basics that some accordion players would know, but since accordion is, how you say, not as popular as it once was, lotsa viewers would gain something from watching the basic overview of the instrument.  After that, the video is quite useful as far as using it in a rock and/or blues context.",1514246400,,318,4.56140350877193

819334,4,6304258984,"""The Rock"" is Michael Bay's masterpiece. It's the story of a decorated Army General who decides to take hostages and commandeer the island of Alcatraz. He uses chemical weapons to force the American government to give money to honor dead soldiers who have died and not been given respect. A team is cobbled together quickly to stop him, including a former Alcatraz inmate (Sean Connery, who breathes life into the movie) and chemical weapons expert Nicolas Cage (a very annoying character.)

The acting is great, from Ed Harris as the villain, to David Morse as his second in command. Among the good guys is FBI agent William Forsythe and NAVY seal Michael Biehn. The director, Bay, has assembled a group of pros, led by Connery, to take you on an action thrill ride.",1480896000,,767,4.7669172932330826

819518,4,6304258984,"Michael bay is an action movie God! This film is an incredible ride that casted certain actors to play to their strengths, which is why it's an 'action classic'. Ed Harris plays a scrupulously hearted Brigadier General, USMC. He's had enough of the Americans in the pentagon ignoring the Americans in the trenches. Watching on for more than three decades while his men are being essentially disavowed for doing what they were ordered to do. Francis Hummel has tried in vain for years to bring attention to the matter in political forums. He's done being ignored. The rest of the story falls into place around this; General Hummel's Last stand. It's no ""Saving Private Ryan"" but you want an action flick with more action than drama I'd reccomend the Rock every time...it's a mixture of die hard, under siege and bad boys.

819716,4,6304258984,"Great action movie that wears out its welcome a little. Sean Connery is awesome, Harris starts wooden but warms up, and while I'm not a fan of Nicholas Cage, he is good here. Michael Bay's directing is slick and keeps things moving, and the music score, while maybe not quite as good as the soundtrack for the first Bad Boys, has some great tunes and impact. The story is maybe not the greatest, but all the actors commit (especially William Forsythe) and as long as you don't stop to think about it, it's fine.

All of the above starts to blur together after the fifth (or sixth, or seventh) big action set-piece, though. A great movie to watch for kicks, or to scratch the action movie itch.

Bonus points for The Rock not being filled with CGI garbage.",1468800000,,755,4.463768115942029

At least I remembered it being so good. Ladies and Gentlemen, the world has changed a lot since this movie came out. Terrorism is a lot more scary in real life and there is no such thing as a clear-cut happy ending. This movie still holds up well. Love the snarky dialogue, the ridiculously extravagant car chase, outrageously stereotypical bit-part characters with attitude and the overall....nineties-ness of it all.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: The Rock is the summer blockbuster film of 1996's and the one and only first ""traditional"" action film that beat Mission Impossible's swiss-cheese-like storyline hands down. There's some wry and tongue in cheek humour, especially from Sean Connery in his heyday as James Bond amidst all the wreckage from car chases and missile strikes, and a few of the characters are allowed to break through their stereotypical boundaries. Not surprisingly, the energy level is high, and there's plenty of action, ranking this film alongside Broken Arrow and Executive Decision among the year's best high-adrenaline offerings.

Here, it's that a group of ex-Marines have stolen 15 VX gas rockets and are threatening to launch a lethal strike on the San Francisco Bay area if their demands aren't met. Led by war hero and living legend, Brigadier General Frank Hummel [Ed Harris], the crack platoon has holed up on Alcatraz, where they're holding 81 civilians hostage. The U.S. Government responds by sending a troop of Navy SEALs on a secret raid, using the labyrinth of tunnels beneath the island as their entranceway. Their guide is the only man ever to escape from the legendary Alcatraz prison: ex-SAS operative, John Mason [Sean Connery]. But also tagging along reluctantly in the party is FBI agent Stanley Goodspeed [Nicolas Cage], an admitted ""chemical superfreak"" who has the knowledge and experience to defuse the 15 VX gas rockets.

All of the cast are first rate and Nicolas Cage, doesn't really excel as an action hero, but he's a good enough performer to forge a likable character. Ed Harris portrays a surprisingly sympathetic bad guy. Unlike most villains in this sort of action packed film, Hummel isn't greedy or mad, just plain angry. He's championing a cause, in where he states, ""this isn't about terrorism, it's about justice,"" and feels that drastic action is the only way to get people to listen to him. The other good actors are David Morse, who is Hummel's right-hand man. John Spencer portrays the FBI director, Michael Biehn is the SEAL team leader, and Vanessa Marcil is Goodspeed's pregnant fiance, who has been placed out of harm's way, for her own safety.

But the real standout tour de force is, of course, is Sean Connery, Enter Connery as John Patrick Mason, a former British intelligence agent (shades of James Bond) who has been imprisoned for 30 years without a trial for stealing the private files of J. Edgar Hoover. John escaped from Alcatraz in 1962, for just long enough to father a daughter before his recapture. Like the general's beloved covert who is a total natural in the film and of course having lost none of his charisma with age, the veteran actor puts to use his mastery of mixing humour and action. Just like James Bond, Mason does all his shooting and battling with tongue in cheek. Along the way, he develops a nice rapport with Goodspeed, and of course you get chemistry with these two actors clicking together in the best ""buddy movie"" fashion.

The Rock' has a brilliant running time that really makes you savoir all of the characters in the film and any shorter time would have been a mistake and in doing so it gives you lots of scope to get under the skin of the character-building material of the actors and of course the script benefiting from getting to know the actors characters. The Rock represents the ultimate loud, fast-paced night's worth of entertainment of roller-coaster excitement. There are all the expected shoot-outs, explosions, and death-defying stunts. Director Michael Bay of Bad Boys doesn't break new ground, but he displays his command of the genre by keeping the familiar from becoming boring.

The humour and the heart come in watching Sean Connery and Nicolas Cage go at each other and form a relationship while ducking bullets and bombs on Alcatraz. ""I drive a Volvo  a beige one,"" says Stanley, using his nerd status as an excuse for being a klutz commando. Stanley wants John to cut him some slack for doing his best. ""Losers always whine about their best,"" says the impatient John, who wants to let it rip with full out, no excuses and makes mayhem, especially with Don Simpson films, it's surely no accident. The Rock' has two protagonists, one a dangerously skittering comet, the other a grounded realist trying to hold course are Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer in a nutshell.

Producers Jerry Bruckheimer and the late Don Simpson have a highly-successful resume that includes Top Gun and Crimson Tide. The Rock will add more lustre and excitement to that reputation. Since Twister and Mission Impossible and have definitely lost all of their tremendous momentum, to be totally tedious and boring at the same time, and The Rock is poised to storm past them all. With Sean Connery, Nicolas Cage, Ed Harris, and a host of awesome action sequences, this is the kind of breath-stealing all year round entertainment that audiences crave for and you will not be disappointed. The Rock is a fitting wild-ride finale for the team of Simpson and Bruckheimer. It's a popcorn-movie deluxe. The Rock is exhausting in its own right and that's just one of several convincing reasons to see purchase this awesome Blu-ray disc.

Blu-ray Video Quality  This Blu-ray edition of 'The Rock' blows its standard inferior NTSC DVD counterparts out of the water 100%, especially The Criterion Collection DVD. With a stunning awesome 1080p encoded image, that will knock you for six. Equally stunning is the magnificent 2.35:1 aspect ratio that makes the screen come alive, and shows of the action pack film to its full potential. The Colours are very alive and rich and the skin tones remain nicely graduated regardless of a scene's lighting, especially with the dark scenes in the underground tunnels of Alcatraz. Better still, is the impeccable details, with sharp textures, crisp on-screen text, and crystal clear background elements throughout most of the film. I can inform any fan of this film that the picture quality will please fans 100% and will easily impress quite a few newcomers along the way.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  'The Rock' features two stunning audio tracks, which consist of a 5.1 Dolby Digital and a totally awesome aggressive LPCM 5.1 Surround track (48 kHz/16-Bit/4.6 Mbps) that does a totally awesome excellent job in handling the film's dense soundscape, and especially when you view scenes like in downtown San Francisco or in the underground tunnels of Alcatraz, and you'll notice a complete 360 degree sound field that involves you in what is going on in the film, especially when you experience some action going on or when the rockets are fired, this where the real soundscape comes alive, creating a real sense of movement and space. But what also helps to create a total ambiance in sound and vision is the wonderful powerful music score composed by Hans Zimmer.

Special Feature: The Rock World Premire on Alcatraz [1996] [480i] [1.33:1] [1:54] This special documentary sees all people involved with the film arriving on the Island of Alcatraz to view The Rock for the first time and you get to see all the difficult logistics of getting all the equipment onto the island to show the film to all the assembled guests. Contributors include Dick Cook [President of Buena Vista Pictures Distribution and Marketing]; Bob Gault [Director of Walt Disney Attractions and Entertainment Special Projects Operations]; Kevin Rosenberg [Chief Projection Engineer] and Brian ONeal [General Superintendent of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area] [Courtesy of Film Trailers Channel].

Special Feature: Navy Seals On The Range [1996] [1080i] [1.33:1] [5:54] This first video special shows a group of current and former SEALs conducting firearms training at a Gunsight-type school. The opening title of this particular segment says: ""Ex-Navy SEAL Harry Humphries' company, Global Studies Group, Inc., employs former and active Navy SEALs to instruct novices and professionals in proper gun handling. He invited us to tape a typical class on 18th December, 1996"". There are also interviews with two active SEALs who were in The Rock film.

Special Feature: Hollywood Humphries & Teague [1996] [1080i] [1.33:1] [8:17] In this second follow up video special we again meet Harry Humphries and actor Marshall R. Teague demonstrating typical Hollywood screw ups with guns, especially relating to typical gangster-style shooting, entering rooms, etc., in films, compared with the proper way to handle firearms. What we see is different aspects of how to use the gun properly and each section is entitled with The Gangster pull; The Wyatt Earp pull; Entering a room; Running with the weapon and Drawing from the belt. Overall, there's nothing earth-shattering in the features. But what is refreshing to see something like this on anything that comes out of Hollywood.

Special Feature: The Dive Sequence [1996] [480i] [1.33:1] [7:45] With this particular documentary, we get lots of explanations on how they did all the underwater sequences in The Rock film, especially with the Navy SEALs arriving at the Island of Alcatraz. You also get to see the making of small models that will eventually get used in some trick photography. You also eventually get to see the marionette puppets in action, plus you see how they add on the bubbles effects that you see in the actual film. Narrated by Hoyt Yeatman [Senior Visual Effects Supervisor at Dream Quest Images].

Special Feature: Action Effects: Movie Magic [1996] [480i] [1.33:1] [7:55] This a Documentary Series from The Discovery Channel dealing with every aspect of special effects in films, from low-budget make-up to multi-million-dollar computer-generated graphics. The clear presentation includes descriptions of the creation and technical problems of the effects, and interviews with effects technicians, directors, stars and other crew. Each episode deals with one topic, effect or technician, concentrating on one or more current or recent films. With this particular documentary, we go behind-the-scenes, looking at the making of The Rock [1996]. But especially we get contributions from the likes of Michael Bay [Director]; Hoyt Yeatman [Visual Effects Supervisor]; Rae Griffith [Visual Effects Producer]; Dan DeLeeuw [Digital Effects Supervisor] and John Murrah [3-D Artist]. Narrated by Neil Ross.

Special Feature: Outtakes [1996] [480i] [1.33:1] [8:50] What you get to view is eight separate mistakes in filming. Be warned, as you will see Ed Harris appear in most of the outtakes, and at times you see him really lose his temper and sure knows how to use a few expletives.

Special Feature: Secrets of Alcatraz [1992] [480i] [1.33:1] [14:38] With our Host Doug McConnell we get a History documentary and tour of the famed prison from its days as a military fort to its use by Native American protesters in the 1970's and includes interviews with former inmates and families of prison officials who lived on the island. We find out that the first humans to make some foundation were the Aboriginal people in the San Francisco Bay. Then the Spaniards 200 years later discovered Alcatraz in 1775. The in the 1850s was a totally different place, especially in California with the Gold Rush. Then the State of California decided it needed a lighthouse in the San Francisco bay, because of all the fishermen and their boats in the area. The in 1852 the army built the fortress that eventually got turned into a prison and life was very grip for the inmates. But in 1933 the army closed it down, because it was too expensive to run, but then in1934 it was designated as an official prison. But of course it became notorious for the famous escapees in 1962, who were Frank Lee Morris and the Anglian Brothers, which was of course immortalised in the Clint Eastwood film Escape From Alcatraz. Then in 1963 the Attorney General Robert Kennedy closed it down, as it was not fit for humans, but in a cold November morning in 1969, a group of Native American Indians occupied the island, but 9 months later they were all evacuated of the island, because someone daughter was killed. At that point the documentary ends abruptly, but despite this, it is quite a nice little documentary and you learn a lot about the history of the Island of Alcatraz.

Special Feature: Jerry Bruckheimer Interview [1996] [480i] [1.33:1] [16:06] here we get to hear intimate details about Jerry Bruckheimers life and ambitions. Jerry talks about his early years when he was a child and when he got hold of a camera, he was very keen on photography. But once he started going to Saturday Morning Pictures, he was hooked on films in general and was determined to get a foot hold into the film industry. His first memories of going to the cinema that influenced him a great deal later in life and the films he specifically mentions are Mr. Roberts; Doctor Zhivago; Lawrence of Arabia and Bridge On The River Kwai, which he classes as his favourite film. He feels films should match the visuals, with the combination of a good story, and that is why jerry admired the director David Lean and that is what Jerry tries to do with all his films. He mentions all the films that started his career, which includes American Gigolo [1980]; Flashdance [1983] and of course Top Gun [1986] which he tells he had a lot of support from the military. His next project was The Rock [1996] and was eager to bring in Sean Connery, who he felt gave a pivotal aspect to the film. He also talks about the difficult logistics of bringing all the equipment to the Island of Alcatraz, where they had 10 miles worth of electrical cable and lots of trailer helicoptered in for all the actors and staff, and he tells us the weather was so unpredictable, and there was lot of hold ups. This is quite a nice little intimate special interview and to actually get to hear Jerry Bruckheimer was great, especially hearing all of his views and intimate aspect of his life and well worth a view.

Blu-ray Promotional Advert [2012] [1080p] [2.35:1] This is to promote certain Blu-ray Titles, which includes Gone in 60 Seconds; Flightplan; Pearl Harbor; The Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy and Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl + Blu-Scape. They inform us that it is Beyond High Definition. Please Note: When the Blu-ray disc loads up, the Promotional Advert automatically plays and you cannot go straight to the Menu or play the film.

Finally, 'The Rock' is a totally awesome entertaining action packed film that really prioritises the characters and story which combines totally a rarity in action films these days. This Blu-ray edition of the film features a remarkable stunning 1080p video transfer, an awesome booming 5.1 LPCM Surround audio track, and a nice collection of supplements ported from The Criterion Collection NTSC DVD. So to totally honest and blunt, toss your inferior NTSC DVD copy and pick this awesome Blu-ray disc up post haste, as it will satisfy all your hopes and desires in an action film that will make you feel exhausted by the time the credits roll up the screen.

It starts with basic explanations of what an accordion is, and how it works and what to look for in a new accordion purchase.

821578,4,6304258984,"THE ROCK is an exciting actioner directed by Michael Bay about a renegade general (Harris) and his select group of Marines who, from their base at the former Alcatraz prison, threaten San Francisco with chemically armed warheads.

Connery is a former British secret agent (really?) teamed up with wussy government chemical specialist Cage, who grows some 'nads during their battle against the mad dog Marine commander.

A definitely recommended popcorn-chomper.

San Francisco is taken hostage when a General  takes control of Alcatraz Island as he threatens to launch missiles, loaded with deadly poisoned gas. An FBI chemical weapons expert and a Federal prisoner are the only two men, who have the skills to defuse the lethal situation, as time begins to run out. Ed Harris plays the General, the chemical weapons expert is Nicolas Cage, and the prisoner is Sean Connery. The suspense is intense throughout, with non-stop explosive action. This is a must-see thrill ride for all those who enjoy thrillers, packed with action, and nail-biting tension. Visual and Sound Effects are incredible.

821766,4,6304258984,"Yes, there was a time when Michael Bay made movies that actually had a plot to go with the explosions, and some, like The Rock, were terrific. I had never seen The Rock from beginning to end, having just caught glimpses of it on TV, but watching it in it's entirety proved what I'd long suspected, it was a great film. A Marine General, upset that his lost soldiers never received the compensation they deserved for their secret missions, takes control of Alcatraz island, and aims chemical weapons at San Francisco. The FBI is at a lost as to what to do and decide to go with an unconventional idea to try and stop the general. A team of Navy seals prepare to take the island back, lead by the only man to ever escape from Alcatraz, now in his sixties, and a chemical weapons specialist who has never been in combat. Sean Connery stars and even though he was nearing the end of his illustrious career, he gives a truly great performance, that reminds us of just how great his movies were. Connery was the premiere action star, in a time before special effects had been computerized. He really gives an old school attitude and feeling to the film, which helps The Rock stand out from it's competition. Connery is paired with Nicholas Cage who is always terrific, especially when he's playing some type of law enforcer. Cage adds humor, unintentionally, with his inexperience, and winds up doing some pretty amazing things. While I don't like to mention specific scenes in a film, I'd be remiss not to mention the incredible chase scene Cage has through the streets of San Francisco, in the beginning of the film. It was reminiscent of the great car chases of the Lethal Weapon series, and really stood out to me. The Rock is a terrific story, featuring a cast in which old school and the younger generation collide, and to top it all off, it has that Michael Bay spin and over reliance on special effects. It's a terrific action film which sadly is rarely seen anymore in the world of computer generated effects and muscle headed action stars.",1402185600,3,2043,4.584699453551913
821767,4,6304258984,"Michael Bay's early entry in his career still proves to be his best. The Rock is an absolute, ridiculous blast from start to finish, with great turns by Nic Cage, Sean Connery and a whole bunch of familiar faces rounding the film out. It's a movie that is utterly ridiculous and knows it, which makes it all the more entertaining. Still, the film has plenty about it to admire. The action set pieces are top notch and the story itself is engrossing, with Connery playing an ex-SAS agent who is also one of the only people to have ever escaped from Alcatraz. He is recruited to help Nic Cage's character and a SEAL team break into Alcatraz to stop Ed Harris, playing a disillusioned general who has taken over the island as his home base, and prevent the launch of several missiles worth of VX gas into San Fran.

The video on this Blu Ray is good but not great. I noticed some breakup in certain night time scenes and slight areas of bad digitization. Certain scenes look awesome but this isn't one of the better transfers I've seen. It's not bad but it's simply not pristine.

The audio is where this disc really shines though. The bass on this lossless 5.1 mix is ridiculous and the track in general feels busy and alive throughout the entire film. It's mixed really loud, so prepare to piss your neighbors and sleeping family members off if you're playing this somewhat late at night. If you want a demo disc for audio purposes, The Rock is an easy candidate.

Extras are just about the same as the Criterion DVD, with plenty of interesting features carried over. Some of it is fluff but the bit with the real life Seal team members debunking movie myths was interesting.

I totally recommend this Blu Ray with the only caveat being that the picture isn't what I was hoping for. This is still one of the best action films of the last twenty years and a fun ride that still holds up as Bay's best film to date.",1401926400,4,1912,4.438746438746438

The story, though highly improbable, has the kind of movie reality you can really get involved with.  The actors, Connery, Harris and Cage are superb as is the great supporting cast.  The action is non ending, keeps you on the edge of your seat and never disappoints.  The sets, the locations and the cinematography are stunning.  The necessary violence is kept to a minimum and the underlying theme of patriotism, though misguided in its' underlying theme, still comes through in a positive way.  Sean Connery has a place in cinema history that few leading men or action heroes can match.

Yes, there were special effects, but there was also genuine acting (an oxymoron, I know) and real scenery...I mean, this film was mostly shot on the actual Alcatraz Island out in California...so a few things about the place were made up...it's called ""creative liberties"".  Anyway, the unlikely pairing of Sean Connery and Nicholas Cage proved sound once Cage's character mellowed out from the ""Gee Wiz"" type of nerd he came into this film as (talk about elavating your character).  I thought the nerdy persona was over-emphasized in the beginning and was glad to see it go...I first began liking Mr. Cage in this film when he explained what the poison gas stolen by the bad guys could do.  Ed Harris was great as their opposite and the writing made him into a compelling and somewhat sympathetic villain.  John Spencer was wonderfully dispikible as the scheming FBI Director and Sean Connery seemed to agree with me as he hung the man over a hotel balcony, probably intending to drop him to his death...this was also actually shot out in San Fransisco...no CGI...people actually called 9-1-1 about it because they didn't realize that a movie was being filmed.  Overall, this was a great film with great casting, great directing, great editing, and most importantly, a great plot.  It's an action film that so many action films today should try to live up to.

Besides that, Harry Gregson-Williams has a perfect fitting score. It contributes to the immersion of the film and is enjoyable to listen to the soundtrack on its own.

Ed Harris is always enjoyable, and his role in The Rock is no exception.

Sean Connery has a slightly different character than usual, though some have said this movie could just be about Bond after being imprisoned for 30 years. How could one ask for more than that?

Nicholas Cage is the same great character actor that he mastered during the nineties.

Overall, this is a great nineties action film with more contentment than the usual, boring, guy action flicks from that time. There's a great, traditional ""action film"" sense of humor about it.

822234,2,6304258984,"So...

For the longest time I had never seen ""The Rock."" I kept on hearing from various people that it was a great action movie to watch and that the soundtrack was awesome, blah blah blah. Obviously, seeing it finally become available on Amazon I decided to give it a go in order to see what all the fuss was about.

Let's just say this, if I had watched this movie back when it came out without knowing it was a Michael Bay film, I probably would have liked it as a kid. After all, I did like Armageddon, though I'd be hesitant to watch it again now. Finally seeing The Rock was not worth the wait, so let's get into why you shouldn't be tempted to see this again either.

1.) Nicholas Cage is his usual crazy self and over acts the role as is typical Nick Cage fashion. This is not normally a problem, but when he's supposed to be an FBI guy that knows dangerous chemicals. It's hard to take him seriously when he acts all non nonchalant about his role.

2.) The typical racist joke is in there. Why did we need to see the scene of a black guy in the trolley going ""Oh lord, Oh Jesus!"" It didn't make any sense, and the way the scene was shot, everyone on that trolley should have been dead.

3.) I love military aircraft and seeing them fly into action. But the way they were used in this movie was lackluster and disappointing. It made me realize that the director definitely has a fancy for the military, but fails to make it look awesome.

4.) Ed Harris' motives were understandable, but the scheme was stupid. I couldn't believe that a general would threaten to attack the U.S. with nerve gas missiles, and though he didn't want to in the end, the whole plan just didn't make sense. How was it supposed to work in the first place?

5.) The action and the set pieces are boring and formulaic. Basically take anything you've seen from Bad Boys, Bad Boys II, Transformers 1,2,3, Pearl Harbor, and you basically have this movie. It's very one note and not very interesting.

I could go on and on, the bottom line is that this movie is: A.) Not worth revisiting if you're feeling nostalgic B.) Not worth your time if you're watching it for the first time. (Unless you like Michael Bay movies, and that's OK, I like some too.)",1374278400,,2228,4.313397129186603

822384,4,6304258984,"It goes without saying that Michael Bay is one of the most infamous filmmakers working today. But did you know he actually made a genuinely good--or at least likable movie--at one point in time? In comes his second directorial effort, and his follow-up to Bad Boys. It makes for a fun popcorn flick, and it's actually not completely brainless. Just...somewhat brainless. Then again, I'd rather watch a braindead action film than a braindead comedy, or for that matter, a braindead drama.

First honors goes to Quentin Tarantino who was uncredited for the story idea behind The Rock. I say story idea because if I never said Tarantino had any involvment in the film, you never would have guessed. The script bares little resemblance to anything Tarantino-related, save, possibly, in the characterizations of two of our leading men: Sean Connery, who plays a former convict of Alcatraz (and whose backstory refers strongly to Connery's days as James Bond), and Nicolas Cage as an FBI scientist who uses rather amusing euphanisms in place of profanity (the most infamous one being Zeus's Bu2+h01e). And indeed, they both play their roles rather well, as does Ed Harris as a Vietnam War Hero who, in the midst of a vendetta against the Government that wronged the men that died under his command, has a delusional lapse of judgment and assembles a team of incredibly violent mercenaries to hold the entire city of San Francisco hostage with the threat of dispensing an incredibly lethal gas from Alcatraz, effectively wiping out the entire population. He is shown the err of his ways, redirects one of the remaining missiles into the Pacific Ocean, and dies attempting to disassemble his team.

And while it bares very little resemblance to a Tarantino script, it definitely bares resemblance to a Michael Bay film--only filtered to remove most of the vulgarity and include a bit more thought and care into the characters themselves. That means no racist stereotypes; no annoying ultra liberal parents, and no Shia LaBeouf in the middle of a kittencalendarkittencalenderkittencalender mental breakdown that otherwise made a complete fool out of himself. And hey? Plenty of fun action set pieces all around that still hold up today.

Where I must draw the line, however, is in the script. It was clear this was Michael Bay's favorite project and he was constantly trying to recapture the plot and the charm of this picture in the Transformers movies--and to a lesser extent, Armageddon. The thing is, however, that aside from the fact that he essentially tired this plot thread to death, one must really question quite a few scenes present in the film and the logic behind them. For example, why are all the military experts so utterly incompetent in this picture? Why did Ed Harris and his men have the entire infiltration squadron--sent in by their superiors in the CIA and FBI into what was obviously a deathtrap--killed save for Cage and Connery, and then simply through the remaining two in the cells? And aren't pilots trained to not fire their missiles until they were commanded to do so? Clearly, Michael Bay wanted to end the movie with a massive explosion that should have killed Cage (and yet he still managed to use as a plot device to fool the FBI and CIA directors into thinking that Connery was vaporized by the explosion...imbeciles).

Truth is, the film is the smartest script Michael Bay had ever directed--and perhaps the smartest he will ever direct. But it's still a Michael Bay film. I enjoyed it. You might not. Take it for what you will. A 5 out of 10 for those who simply can't check their brain at the door. A 7 out of 10 for those who can--at least for this picture.  I'm in the latter category, and that means that translates to a 4 out of 5.",1360972800,,3765,4.821981424148607

822391,5,6304258984,"This transfer of 'The Rock' on to Blu Ray shows what a company can do if they put their minds to it.  Too many older films like this one are simply reformatted to fit Blu Ray rather than worked on to either remaster or just improve the transfer.  While I don't provide plot summaries or my opinions on acting, just a review of the transfer, the Rock has a loaded cast full of well known actors like Ed Harris, Nick Cage(when he was still doing quality movies, Sean Connery, Michael Biegn, and a host of those well known character actors whose names you often can't recall.

The video transfer to Blu Ray is really very good.  Early in the movie the colors appear a touch soft and desaturated, however, my thinking is that this is deliberate as the skies are cloudy and the island dismal and dreary, thus the colors fit the environment.  In the city scenes you have a much greater brightness for the colors to shine through and, in some scenes, pop.  I could detect no artifacting, aliasing or banding anywhere within  the Blu Ray transfer tho there might be the slightest hint of grain on the rear office walls within the penitentiary.  You really have to look closely for it tho so I wouldn't pay any mind to it.  Even in the dark scenes there is a great deal of depth and detail.

The PCM uncompressed 3/2.1 audio is the star of the film's transfer with excellent use of the discreet channels for panning and movement.  In the bathroom scene, when Ed Harris first calls for his solders to stop firing the dialogue comes from behind you.  Other than foley fx, it is not often that you hear dialogue coming from the rears even on some of the best transfers.  I had to play the scene again to make sure I was hearing it correctly it so surprised me.  Hope you have a good processor and sound system as the audio presents a very balanced leveling from the music score to the various foley fx.  My only complaint was my realization that the music score during the car chase in San Francisco was either dated or corny, I haven't decided which but I have seen this film many times on Standard Def DVD and never really realized that until I saw it on Blu Ray.

While I wouldn't say that this is the disc to use as a Demo disc, it does show off your system and how good a blu ray can be when compared to its Standard Def counterpart.

There are also many extras detailing the underwater scenes, some funny outtakes including Ed Harris getting angry at blowing his lines on the phone and plenty more.  There is a short history of Alcatraz, as well as a few shorts on what type of shooting we see in the movies as opposed to how they should be correctly done if you were in the military or on a police force.  The only negative is that there are a full 7 previews of other films which come on as soon as you insert the disc.  Previews of other films takes up valuable disc space which calls for more compression to the film itself.  It is the one feature I hate to see on any DvD, Blu Ray or not.

Other than that, this is a great transfer and well worth the purchase or upgrade if you already have it on Standard Def as I do.
All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.
Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.

822392,4,6304258984,"That headliner line is not about the film - it is one of the funnier lines spoken by Nicholas Cage in this knockout movie. Almost twenty year old, this film - THE ROCK - remains one of the most entertaining and powerfully performed and produced action films in cinema history.  Re-examining It today finds it still as fresh as ever - a film that keeps you on the edge of your seat with a solid story (David Weisberg, Douglas Cook, and Mark Rosner) and pitch perfect direction from Michael Bay.  Yes, there are many special effects (pyrotechnics, underwater fighting, the recreation of the bowels of Alcatraz, etc), a dialogue that allows the intervention of comic relief in a situation that seems impossible to find humor, and some very fine performances by a huge cast of actors.  It is an `escape movie', both for the audience and for the story.

Dr. Stanley Goodspeed (Nicholas Cage, in one of his better roles), who lives in Washington D.C., is a biochemist who works for the FBI. Soon after his fianc&eacute;e Carla Pestalozzi (Vanessa Marcil) announces that she is pregnant, Stanley gets a call from FBI director James Womack (John Spencer). Womack tells Goodspeed that San Francisco's Alcatraz Island has been taken hostage, along with 81 tourists, by marine General Francis Xavier Hummel (Ed Harris) who, for years, has been protesting the government's refusal to pay benefits to families of war veterans who died during covert military operations. The death of his wife Barbara Hummel on March 9, 1995 drove General Hummel over the edge, and now he's holding hostages in order to get his point across. Goodspeed is needed because General Hummel has stolen some VX gas warheads and has announced that he will launch them onto San Francisco unless his demands are met. Goodspeed knows how to disarm the bombs, but he needs someone who knows Alcatraz well enough to get him inside and that someone is a former Alcatraz escapee James Patrick Mason (Sean Connery).  The wise and experienced Mason and the nerdy brainy but intimidated Goodspeed make an odd couple but head to Alcatraz in an attempt to foil Hummel's terrorist scheme.

The large supportive cast is populated with such actors as David Morse, William Forsythe, Bokeem Woodbine, Danny Nucci, Claire Forlani, Jim Caviezel, John Enos III, Richard Conti, Raymond Cruz and Philip Baker Hall. It is a bit long but never fails to keep your interest.  A good old-fashioned Hollywood blockbuster action flick! Grady Harp, September 12",1346630400,,2492,4.947368421052632

His men and a few other Marine volunteers have captured a tour group on Alcatraz Island and are threatening to launch the missiles against the city of San Francisco if their demands are not met.

The government puts together a SEAL team to go into the prison to rescue the civilians and reacquire the missiles.

822472,2,6304258984,"""I make movies for 15-year-old boys? What a crime!"" -Michael Bay

You know what, Mike? I was 15 when I saw this movie back in the summer of 1996 and I wasn't too impressed, so maybe you ought to take back that ludicrous comment. As a matter of fact I went to see it twice (June and July 1996), just to make sure my judgement was honest and correct.

Since debuting with Bad Boys in 1995, Bay has averaged about one movie every two years. But I think that it's quite sad and pathetic that in 16 years and nine movies he has not matured as a filmmaker in the slightest. If anything he's regressed.

The Rock has characters with just a touch more depth than we're used to in Bay films. It's not necessarily a big story but he seems to stretch it out over two hours with heinously over-cut action scenes and extraneous sub-plotting.

General Francis Xavier Hummel (Ed Harris) takes over Alcatraz with some poisonous gas rockets and aims them at San Francisco with the intention of vaporising everyone unless the families of each member of his dead team is paid $1,000,000. A nerdy and heavily bored FBI agent, named Stanley Goodspeed (Nicolas Cage), is called to San Francisco from Washington to observe and instruct the inevitable SEAL operation to overthrow the Marines on Alcatraz. But wait, there's more. Alcatraz is a maze of twisted metal and broken walls. They won't stand a chance without someone who has knowledge of how to break out. Or break in.

And so enters the philosophizing and lanky-haired John Patrick Mason (Sean Connery) at about 45 minutes into the movie. He's been in jail for 30 years and doesn't appear to be annoyed at having to work for the very people who have held him without trial for so long. There is an utterly pointless and indulgent car chase before he actually gets down to business.

Once on the island, the SEALS, as predicted, are crap and get killed instantly. So, basically, Hummel wants to honor his fallen comrades by killing more American soldiers. How absurd, but not much in this film makes sense. Plus these SEALS have thoroughly extensive training and, in real life, there is NO WAY they'd end up being so useless.

Goodspeed and Mason are not a great pairing. I don't know what the deal is with Nic Cage, when he's good he's great, but more often than not he's so unbelievably awful I wonder how he manages to get work. Goodspeed isn't very appealling. He's annoying, not funny, and little of his dialogue sounds natural coming from his mouth. When he tries to be tough, he just seems ridiculous. Mason is just an old James Bond. Hell, he's even a British Secret Agent. The role was written with Connery in mind, so don't expect anything but his elite brand of OAP smart-ass cool.

Coherent editing is not this movie's strength. In fact, coherence is hardly something one would associate with The Rock. There are so many distractions and superfluous plot points that the only way Bay can compensate is to turn every scene into a epileptic blur. The target audience is familiar with this kind of film-making anyway, and it has sadly become the accepted norm for action movies.

The Rock is inferior and less engaging than a similar movie that came out the month before its release. Executive Decision attempts the same theme and an identical form of tension. In 135 minutes, it wastes no time on sub-plotting, develops far more likable characters and is way more exciting.

Exec Dec is played straight. The Rock is played to look cool and hip. It's not. And apart from Zimmer's entertaining score, there's not much to recommend. This rock could have skipped along the surface, but merely sinks to the bottom under its over-written, over-wrought, over-directed weight.

Oh, and if Mason is supposed to have a major beef with Womack then perhaps they should have cast someone older than John Spencer who would have been 19/20-years-old when his character first crossed Mason.

The Blu Ray looks great in 2.35:1 1080p with LCPM 5.1 sound. A fair amount of extras are included.",1312156800,3,4018,4.691761363636363

822560,4,6304258984,"The Rock(released June/96) stars a younger Nicolas Cage,Sean Connery and Ed Harris. Cage can't outdo screen vet Connery nor Ed Harris,but he manages to at least keep up and the results are an intense but pleasing drama that plays itself out on the island of Alcatraz off San Francisco.
The story involves one FBI agent/chemical specialist Stanley Goodspeed(Cage).He is called to come to San Francisco because a disgruntled military general by the name of Hummel(Harris) has taken over the ex prison and is threatening to fire missiles loaded with a deadly chemical into the heart of the city if the government doesn't agree to a ransom. They also must pay off the families of past military operatives that were never compensated because of the secrecy of their missions. In order to gain a foothold onto and into the Rock,the government enlists the help of a notorious ex-SAS man John Mason(Connery).He is the only man to have successfully escaped the prison when it was opened and he supposedly knows the best way in undetected.
Once in Goodspeed is assigned directly with Mason and told to never leave his side. The clock is ticking down and a military team along with Goodspeed and Mason manage to gain entry,but not undetected. Most of the team is slaughtered in an impossible fire fight and that leaves Mason and Goodspeed to do the job on their own.
Hummel is totally flummoxed by the incident and his rancor gets worse. At one point he finally fires one of the missles but at the last minute he changes its course to fall into the water. It is here we find out that he was bluffing to make a grander point but some of the men he leads aren't of the same point of view. They take over the operation and attempt to fire a rocket into the city,but they are foiled by Mason and Goodspeed. When a jet fires on the island it sends Goodspeed flying into the water. This gives him the excuse he needs to tell the authroities that Mason was killed in the incident. The film ends with Goodspeed going to a certain church pew in a certain Kansas Church to obtain microfilm that Mason stashed there that contains many,many classified state secrets.
With a very enjoyable story line and a great cast,this film moves along very well. The only slow parts are Cages charcater set up at the beginning but once Connery and Harris hit the screen,the movie heats up right away. Harris is excellent as the intense General Hummel and Connery plays his character with his usual deft touch. Honourable mentions go out to David Morse as Major Baxter and the highly under rated Tony Todd as Captain Darrow. Todd always plays with a burning intensity I never get tired of seeing.
Techncially this release is over 13 years old now and is showing its age but the picture still looks pretty crisp and clear and it is in its 2:35:1 a/r. The only feature is the trailer.
This early Michael Bay film,done between two of his other better films Bad Boys and Armegeddon,sure has what it takes in the drama department. With two of the screens better actors Ed Harris and Sir Sean Connery on board,it's no wonder this film is a winner. You can't go wrong with those two and Cage does an admirable job trying to keep up to them.

The theme is a typical ""disaster-waiting-to happen"" one.  Ed Harris and a group of disgruntled marines, take over Alcatraz, imprisoning tourists in cells and threatening to destroy the world with biological weapons if they do not get a huge amount of money from the government.  Nicolas Cage is cast as the meek chemical weapons expert who is brought in to counter the threat.  And Sean Connery, in an truly excellent performance, is cast as a an intelligence expert who has been in prison for 30 years and who is the only person who ever made a successful escape from Alcatraz.  There's a little humor here as Connery changes from a long-haired wild looking man in a prison uniform to a sophisticated man-about-town with a secret wish to connect with the grown daughter he fathered and has never met.  Put this all together and bring on the special effects and this is a fast-paced predictable flick that does well at the box office.

is actually much simpler to play than most people

Armageddon was a horrendous piece of donkey dung, everything that's wrong with Hollywood was detailed in that schlock!  The Rock is a slightly different proposition, it's entertaining and never tries to be anything but! The story is thin and the dialogue is typically bad at times. The action is excellent and Sean Connery makes the movie work!  The direction is very Mtv, the editing is silly at times - what's with the quick cuts? Why can't I enjoy the compositions? Pathetic! But still, the pace is consistent.  The acting is okay, Connery's presence elevates the material. Ed Harris is always dependable and Cage is pretty funny as Goodspeed.  The music is very patriotic and but fun.  Overall, entertaining, switch your brain off! After this, Bay descended into familiar MTV garbage!",1219968000,,891,4.953020134228188
822778,4,6304258984,"This is a story of 2 men who come together from completely different backgrounds, where they meet in San Francisco - a city where anything's possible. Goodspeed, played by the ever lovable Nicholas Cage, is a doctor who knows a lot about chemicals - he's always talking about those chemicals, it's just his *thing*. His girlfriend is pregnant - and at the beginning of the film they plan to marry - but unforeseen circumstances bring him to the West Coast. Mason on the other hand, played by a stern and tough Sean Connery, is an old rugged man who is locked in his room reading books and philosophizing about life. ""In another life,"" Mason admits in one scene, ""I wish I were a poet or a farmer.""

Against all likelihood, the men are united on a mission ""to save a city"", as one character puts it. After a number of transforming events, Goodspeed's intellectual prowess and his knowledge about chemicals uniquely compliments Mason's rougher edges. And despite Mason's shortcommings, he's very good at acting on instinct, a quality that Goodspeed lacks. It's an unlikely couple to say the least, but the 2 actors definitely have great chemistry.

They first meet in the streets of San Francisco in a dazzling scene that can only be described as riveting and heart-pounding. They roam through those streets as if they owned the city, and in their own particularly ways, they seem to wreak havoc wherever they go.

The plot begins to pick up when Goodspeed's job eventually takes him to a remote relatively isolated island off of the city's coast, where he is asked scour the island for those chemicals that he knows so much about, which are being used by some macho guys in their big rockets that they're flaunting at everyone. Despite being hesitant at first, Mason eventually decides to join Goodspeed on the island, where the two experience mishaps and mayhem wherever they go. Sparks and explosions light up as Goodspeed and Mason find out that they're not so different afterall. All the while, through a number of plot developments and twists, their excursions take them through underground hidden passageways and abandoned buildings and lighthouses, even SCUBA diving underwater - all in search of those chemicals that Goodspeed is so determined to find.

The screen lights up as they cross paths with other characters who have also situated themselves on the island - these include tourists, generals, and even a group of specially trained Marines.

There's a bittersweet happiness at the end, when the two characters must part. Mason needs to return to his life of annomity back in SF Bay where he also has an estranged daughter, while Goodspeed reunites with his fiance. Although nonetheless the guys have experienced intense life-changing events that will likely forever change their lives. Heart-thomping action, betrayal, loyalty, deceit, poetry, disguise, lots of action and lots of male-bonding, somehow they've all made it into this rather energetic film.",1218844800,,2969,5.002024291497976
822779,5,6304258984,"This movie is absolutely amazing from beginning to end. Ed Harris and his fellow troopers are demanding  the government to pay each of the familiy members that died during desert storm, 1 million dollars because they were not given any money at all and not even a proper burial.  There's a catch though obviously that he will lauch V-Ex Poisen gas into The San Francisco Bay area if the demands are not met.  Harris also locks up people during a tour at Alcetraz. Here we enter Nicolas Cage who plays a biochemist/chemical weapons specialist who  they need to dismantle the weapons that are filled with the deadly gas that Harris has put up.  Enter Sean Connery who was a prisoner at Alcatraz and the only one who managed to escape. They need him unfortunately because he knows the insides and outside of the place so well among other areas he managed to escape from and can help Cage through The Rock. The humor beginns when Cage and Connery first meet. This is what makes the movie even better. The chemistry between them is so funny and the acting especially by Cage and Harris and Connery  is brilliant as well.  Add in the great action, an exciting high tension movie some great humor by all the actors makes for a highly  entertaining film you will enjoy.

822781,4,6304258984,"This is a fine, in many ways typical, Hollywood action movie, that without its fine cast wouldn't have been half the movie it is. What makes the film work so well is the performance of Sean Connery as an SAS soldier whos been kept under lock and key by the US as he had discovered the truth about JFK and numerous other US follies. In the Winter of his career (age 66 when this was made) Connery still had that magical screen presence that only a few actors are blessed with.

Pushing him close though, is a fine performance by Ed Harris as the rogue General who steals a nummber of VX missiles armed with a deadly nerve agent. Connery is the only man who knows how to get into Alcatraz (which the General has taken over) and is released to help the military and Nicholas Cage, a chemical weapons expert, get the missiles back.

This was a fantastic film to see at the cinema. I have docked it a star for a few too many over the top moments. On the small screen it does lose a little of its flash and dash, but overall though this is still a hugely entertaining film.",1216425600,,1067,4.2254901960784315

822783,4,6304258984,"I've always been a fan of this movie, the Rock.  Michael Bay catches a lot of flak about his Hollywood-esque action movies, but you can't find anyone that knows action better than him.  This movie proved his abilities and put him on the map as an action director.  The scenes are beautiful.  Wonderful, colorful shots followed by more wonderful shots.  The cast is full of great actors too like Sean Connery, Ed Harris, and Michael Beihn.

The disc itself is a great testament to HD media.  Very clear picture, especially for a movie 12-13 years old.  The audio will blow you away.  Extremely crisp and LOUD.  It's also packed full of extras, although some are really quite useless.  Most extras are in standard def too.

I paid $15 for this movie.  Being one of my all-time favorite action flicks, I think the purchase was well worth it with a combination of great visuals, extremely entertaining cast, and a healthy dose of in-your-face-action coupled with it being all presented in HD.  You literally get a lot of bang for your buck.  ;)  Don't knock Michael Bay until you see this action classic.",1213574400,2,1100,4.680628272251309

FBI chemical warfare agent Stanley Goodspeed (Nicolas Cage) now must join up with former criminal Mason (Sean Connery) to rescue the hostages and stop the madmen from threatening the city.

Explosive and action packed thriller which is Michael Bay's crowning achievement besides ""Transformers"" delivers all the thrills and chills that anyone needs. Jerry Bruckheimer and the late Don Simpson lavishly produced this movie and Michael Bay was just perfect to do this movie, the movie does co-star Tony Todd (""Candyman) and Michael Biehn.

There is a little grain in some scenes but overall this is a great improvement over the Standard Def version. Michael Bay, in my opinion, is not a great Director and I bristled at his comments during the HD vs Blu-ray war. His recent ""Transformers"" left me cold when it arrived in the theatres and I didn't even finish that and went into another theatre (thank god for multiplexes). The Connery-Cage duo really clicks and Ed Harris is excellent in the role as the misguided warrior. This was the last film for the Simpson-Buckheimer team since Simpson died of a drug overdose shortly after completing this film. Connery in his action mode is still ageless and Cage offers a great comical counterpoint to him in their scenes together.  Also the under-rated Michael Biehn is fine in his brief appearance as the Marine sworn to bring Harris & Co under his command. The rest of the supporting cast is also excellent such as the late John Spencer, Stuart Wilson as a general, David Morse as Harris second in command and Phillip Baker Hall as an old buddy of Connery's who has a secret.

They obviously did it for the money, because it's not a particularly good film. But then, if the money for this project went to finance DVD's like Berlin Alexanderplatz, then I'm OK with that.

As for the film itself, a friend of mine recently called me in the middle of the night upset and irritated.  Thinking he was in jail or in some sort of trouble, but it wasn't like that at all.  He had just watched Michael Bay's film of the Transformers, and he said to me ""I want to kill Michael Bay"".  There are a lot of people in the world who despise Michael Bay, and with good reason.  This film is a good example of why.  The man cuts every 2 or 3 seconds, giving one a massive headache and eye strain. The dialogue here is laughable, as many of the character motivations. Connery has suppposedly been kept in isolation for 20 years or so, yet seems perfectly normal when released into the world.  When Connery and Cage's platoon initially meets Harris's band of thugs, the leader of Connery and Cage's platoon goes off on Harris, despite being surrounded by Harris's men (needless to say, they all get killed except Cage and Connery).  The acting is incredibly melodramatic, sometimes hilariously so.  The film is an immense piece of garbage, but it's better than Bay's Armageddon.  Bay's films are emblematic of what's wrong with Hollywood. Bad dialogue, crappy acting, implausible scripts, overwrought direction, etc., etc.. He must be stopped!

For the record, I have friends who worked at Criterion, and they said that Michael was not the typical Hollywood prick. He treated everyone at Criterion pretty well. It don't make his film any better, though....",1191024000,3,1790,4.720257234726688

823034,5,6304258984,"It is the age old question.  The first time I ever saw this on a friend's DVD shelf, I though that it must be some old 1930s noir movie titled ""The Rock"", but no, it was Michael Bay's action movie.

And I love me some Criterion collection, though I have to wonder why they put out The Rock and yet have long neglected Orson Welles' films.

In any case, the reason this movie deserves Criterion status is that it's probably one of the best action movies ever made.  If you are looking for slam-bang, hammy acting, bullets everywhere, bad puns, buddy-cop drama, pseudo-governmental double-crossing, well, this is about as good as it gets.  Whether or not it's you cup of tea is a different issue.  But you just have to read Ebert's review to see why this movie is so damn good.

823035,3,6304258984,"This is probably Michael Bay's second best film, behind the original 'Bad Boys' (the sequel to which is surely one of the very worst pieces of ""cinema"" I've ever had the displeasure of seeing). The reason 'The Rock' falls behind his debut is obvious: Bay can't, to my mind, produce any sort of convincing dramatic effect; what little emotion the movie does evoke comes courtesy of the outstanding cast -- primarily Cage, Connery, and (by far the most of the bunch) Ed Harris. 'Bad Boys', on the other hand, was much more suited to Bay's ludicrous, a.d.h.d mentality; it was bogus, but never strove to be anything more -- and it was fun, and funny.

The concept of 'The Rock' is intriguing and unique, but the problem that reveals itself fairly quickly is that Bay uses it as a catalyst to throw in action scenes around every corner. I personally don't have a problem so much with the sequences themselves being ridiculous. The car chase scene, for example, in which Cage just happens to handle a ferarri (or lamborghini -- not really sure) like a professional driver of whatever sort, making his way through a circus-esque obstacle course of insane proportions, is beyond unrealistic. But hey, Bay's sense of speed and excitement, alongside Hans Zimmers' adrenalized score, provide for good, stupid fun. It's that, following this scene, the action just does not stop, and it's usually far less creative and ambitious. It's just quarrel after quarrel, gun fight after gun fight, and though Bay employs neat tricks here and there that make him a unique director, most of it ends up becoming monotonous and stale.

I don't even know if the film deserves three stars, because it's so hokey and implausible, but, it must be said, 'The Rock' was one of my very favorite movies back in high-school. Bay was also one of my favorite directors at that point, in contrast to my general spite towards the man at the current place in time -- times have changed; it doesn't help that every film proceeding 'The Rock' has been fairly atrocious, either. But the fact remains the man has incredible talent at establishing a particular visual mood and is able to conduct a sequence of shots that provide a rousing, flashy response. The final standoff in the film, as well as the climactic scene of Cage injecting the holy needle into his heart as jets prepare to blow-up the island, is, in its own way, exhillirating and awesomely impressive. But you know what? 'Armageddon' has sequences as such laced with brilliance too, but in the end it doesn't matter much when the overall film is such a turd. 'The Rock' isn't a turd, but it's not one of the greater action flicks out there -- not by a long shot. To my 14 year old self it might be, but to my more evolved, rational brain, it ain't I'm afraid.",1168819200,2,2782,4.6755102040816325

Highly recommended.",1158710400,2,363,4.609375
823038,5,6304258984,"As an inmate of The Rock for a good number of years, Sean Connery's fictional character knows the place all too well which was also home to thousands of real life convicts for decades.  The Rock of course is the colorful name for Alcatraz Prison sitting high on a rocky island in San Francisco bay.  Now a national landmark and tourist attraction, Alcatraz has been the focus of the public's fascination for years and The Rock wasn't the first movie set in the humongous penitentiary.  But it's arguably the most exciting one and certainly it's the most expensively produced.  The Rock serves as high gloss, high octane entertainment which works as a thunderous action packed popcorn movie, but also as an indictment of America's treatment of war veterans and ""enemies of the state"".  In many ways, the issues in the film couldn't be more topical.  We still have a major military presence in Iraq and our treatment of veterans and enemies is coming under fire with the Abu Gharab debacle and the like, along with the less than shocking revelation of the existence of ""secret prisons"" where American intelligence agents detain, debrief and interrogate enemy operatives.  The controversy has boiled over and now has political leaders discussing a major overhaul of the way in which the USA fights wars.  Is it at the expense of basic human rights?  Is the Geneva convention regarding such issues being violated or just being misinterpreted?  Director Michael Bay's movie never tries to answer any questions, but they always loom large in the background as the intriguing story unfolds.

Maybe I should say four stories:  Nicholas Cage and Connery share protagonist duties equally while Ed Harris shines as the sympathetic antagonist as they collide against the backdrop of terrorism and mass kidnapping fueled by desperate mercenary mindsets.  The screenplay skillfully balances the three men's fascinating lives and each story could easily hold a film on its own.  Cage plays Goodspeed, a scientist first and federal agent second.  He's a biochemical weapon's expert whose education and chemical expertise both eclipse his necessity for carrying an FBI badge and using a firearm.  He's not quite a geek, but he's no Elliot Ness.  There's more than an element of Fox Mulder in him - the brainy, paranormal expert of X-Files fame.  But while Mulder never could get the family thing together, Cage's girlfriend is pregnant and they're on the verge of marriage.  When Goodspeed is ordered into action after a group of ex US soldiers steal several missiles armed with deadly VX gas, Goodspeed must leave his girlfriend immediately after she gives him the good news about her impending stork visit.

Ed Harris plays a highly decorated war veteran whose outrage at the manner in which the US handled his men's deaths and how their families were treated has brought him into the darkest of decisions and perhaps over into insanity.  He leads the mercenary group who steals the VX missiles and then proceeds to take an Alcatraz tour group hostage to ransom the US government of millions of dollars.  His motive so he says his financial restitution to the family's soldiers who died under his watch and weren't treated fairly by the country they helped to protect.  It's a difficult role and one which could be played too broadly.  Harris makes the character into a true human being, never a two dimensional villain.  His character is torn between his high moralistic value regarding his fallen subordinates and the savage terrorist action he has masterminded.  The conflict tears him up and Harris plays up all the emotions like the master thespian he always shows us.

Sean Connery plays a kind of older Bond without benefit of gee whiz gadgets or a license to kill - but kill he does.  Even at his age, his larger than life presence and demeanor make you firmly believe he could snap your neck with little effort and do it gracefully and with class.  Most of Connery's scenes are with Cage and their chemistry definitely works.  Connery's character is beyond bitter for is treatment at being hidden away in a federal prison after being an inmate of Alcatraz years before.  He's still treated as a dangerous enemy of the state even now and his quietly controlled anger at his situation explodes at just the right moments.  After a promise of release and clearing his name, he agrees to help.  He's really the only one left alive or willing to aid the strike force assembled to free the civilians now inmates themselves of Alcatraz.

The supporting cast is stellar and includes Michael Biehn and David Morse, both consistently solid and always more than watchable.  Morse especially brings a quiet sadness to his roles and this one is no different.  He's loyal to his commander, yet almost as torn as Harris over the sticky moral implications of their actions.  Biehn a veteran of James Cameron actioners like The Terminator, Aliens and The Abyss plays the military leader of the strike force which Cage and Connery must assist in freeing the hostages and dealing with Harris and his soldiers.

The Rock's visual FX are a mix of old and new.  It was filmed during the time of Hollywood's greater reliance of digitally produced opticals.  The result was so well conceived and executed that a special episode of the cable series MOVIE MAGIC was devoted entirely to the film.  In one of the stirring finale scenes, Nicholas Cage is slumped over barely able to stand while framed overhead by two high powered air force jets as they streak across the sky  At the time. it surprised viewers to learn the aircraft were created totally by artists in a computer.  It gave a clear glimpse into today's movie world which relies almost exclusively on computer generated images for more expensive FX demands or ones nearly impossible to achieve through other means.  There are 3 versions of the rock on DVD a bare bones movie only, a studio special edition release and then there's The Criterion Collection version.  Criterion treats the movie to an excellent 2 disc set complete with informative audio commentary and the aforementioned Movie Magic episode.

The Rock is definitely more of thinking man's action movie.  It moves along at an electric pace, never fails to deliver the thrills and it's 2 hours and 15 mins running time never lags.  But where some action thrillers merely offer up snappily executed set pieces with little story or character, The Rock embraces its plot and characters.  The motivations behind them are believable and genuinely performed.  Michael Bay would go on to give us Armageddon and Pearl Harbor and most recently The Island.  He's a director whose popular tastes and sensibilities don't always translate well with audience and critics.  With The Rock however, it's safe to say he's successful in pleasing most any viewer or critic alike.",1154736000,4,6850,4.922473867595818

823040,3,6304258984,"From what I've seen, the Criterion label is reserved exclusively for groundbreaking and historically incredible films.

""The Rock"" isn't one of those (though I heard somewhere that a possible justification that Michael Bay will have a place in movie history years from now).

But it is an entertaining ride of an action flick. It's definetely better than your standard action movie. The car chase scene is one of my favorites and city of San Francisco looks great.

There's no point in rehashing the plot summary. It's given above but I will say a few things about how the studio went about this release.

I have the original release and it's just terrible. In fact, it's worth one star because it's a lousy non anamophic release. It's a got a good DD 5.1 track, but a DTS certainly wouldn't hurt for this. Several films were released like this (especially a few early ones by Touchstone and Hollywood). Two other good action/suspense /thrillers released that way are ""Crimson Tide"" and ""Enemy of the State"", both being re-released as 'extended editions' in the next few days.

Looking at it one way, it wasn't a particularly bad idea on the part of the studio at the time. After all, practically no one had a widescreen television at the time (and few still have one now) but it's catching on as more people buy HDTVs.

In the end I'd rather give this a 2 1/2 star rating, but I'll be generous and give it a whole extra star. This film isn't Criterion ""worthy"", but it's entertaining and the bonus disc has a huge amount of extras. I just wish they released a decent edition of this film by itself with a DTS track and anamorphic transfer for a much cheaper price. I'm not convinced this is worth paying anywhere near what it's asking for unless you either completely love this film (I like it's soundtrack and would buy it if it included that by itself) or don't mind shelling out money for a good but, not extraordinary piece of work.",1146873600,5,1937,4.6

The Rock, plainly based on the world's fate or San Francsico for that matter, it just about a bunch of guys trying to evade the green rocks from exploding and causing mass chaos and nucleur reactivity.

I admire Nicolas Cage and Sean Connery because their acting can sometimes be of higher class (Adaptation, From Russia with Love), but acting in a thriller with the worst storyline of the 90s changed my mind of watching big names in summer action blockbusters.

823198,5,6304258984,"Working with members of the Armed Forces, I see the very sort of thing Harris' character tried to fight all the time; being neglected and forgotten.  However, politics aside The Rock is an incredible movie with a true lesson to be learned for all your political science guy's out there.

The story was very compelling with Ed Harris playing the 'bad guy,' a disgruntled veteran legend sick and tired of seeing his fallen soldier's lives neglected by their own government.  Harris takes matter into his own hands and an incident ensues, que FBI ""chemical freak"" Stanley Goodspeed (Cage) and ex-SAS operative John Mason (Connery) to assist a Navy SEALS team in rescueing hostages on Alcatraz, hence the title.  You sympathize with Harris in his struggle for justice, however, you cannot condone his actions, especially as his own men take action into their own hands.

There are no real plot twists other than the past of Connery's character, however, what Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer miss in plot twists, they make up in special effects and action sequences.  I think the car chase in San Francisco is one of the best I've seen in the 90s and the gun fights on Alcatraz are quite a testiment to the stunt actors and coordinators of the movie.

The acting is pretty good, Cage does his spiel as a nerdy FBI agent that is extremely inexperienced and Connery as the bad boy from England, kinda like Bond on a serious testosterone booster and Harris does a good job as the emotionally disturbed Marine Recon general.  There are other great actors in The Rock like Michael Biehn, who did not get a good enough role if you ask me, everyone kills him off in almost every movie he's in.

The music is incredible, Hans Zimmer really did it well in this one as he did in Crimson Tide.  I listen to the soundtrack before every competition I go to just to psych me up, so check out the soundtrack too.

But overall, I think the real big thing is the lesson; do not forget or neglect the fallen.  Their memories should never be forgotten nor neglected regardless of political affiliation.

Overal, I'd give this a 4.8, the only downside is the sound editing.  Many times, I could hear Michael Bay yell ""cuuuut!"" in his annoying voice... oops on behalf the sound team.  Sounds great on my surround sound though.",1112572800,,2302,4.663366336633663

823201,4,6304258984,"The Rock is an extraordinary action film with pure adrenaline pumping in its veins as lethal VX gas threatens to kill hundreds of thousand in the San Francisco bay area.  This will lead into a high speed nitroglycerine race against time where a group of highly trained marines led by Brigadier General Francis X. Hummel (Ed Harris) decides to turn into a terrorist.  Hummel invades Alcatraz and takes tourists' hostage as he plans to shoot rockets with lethal VX gas into the city of San Francisco, unless the United States answers his demands.  The United States answers by sending a group of Navy SEALS led by Commander Anderson (Michael Biehn) and two oddities, a geriatric ex-SAS operative and a tense chemist.

The real weapons against the Hummel are the former SAS soldier, John Mason (Sean Connery), and the chemist, Dr. Stanley Goodspeed (Nicolas Cage).  Mason has been locked away in secret in a United States prison for the last three decades, one of these prisons used to be Alcatraz from which Mason also escaped.  Goodspeed is a laid-back chemist that works for the FBI's chemistry unit that has never been outside of a laboratory, which makes him more of a hazard than an asset as they enter the undergrounds of Alcatraz.

Michael Bay brings the audience a film full of daunting stunts, explosions, and shoot outs.  The special effects are a big part of this carnival of sound and color which is tied together neatly with a decent story.  The story is well balanced with good actors and well developed characters.  For example, the evil Hummel is not just a bad guy as he also has a deeper moral value, which fuels his anger that drives him to this madness.  Goodspeed is obsessed about vinyl records and his wife just got pregnant.

823204,5,6304258984,"The Rock is a great masterpeice that takes place on Alcatraz Island, next to San Francisco. A number of ex marines, led by Frank Hummel, played by Ed Harris, have taken control of 80 plus hostages on Alcatraz Island and threaten to launch guided missles armed with poison gas. Not only does the homeland security want to save as many hostages as possible, but each rocket can kill up to 75,000 people each.

Since all the wardens and guards have been dead for some time now the only person the good guys can turn to is the only man who secretly escaped Alcatraz years ago. That man would be John Mason, played by the great Sean Connery, who was locked away to be forgotten after learning all the white house's dirty little secrets of the past half century.

After several detours, an escape and a car chase, Mason agrees to work with the fake promise of freedom. He teams up with a nerdy chemical weapons specialist, played by Nicholas Cage, and a group of Navy Seals. Once inside the rock everything goes wrong and in the end only Mason and Goodspeed [Cage] are left alive to try and save San Francisco.

This movie is off the page from beginning to end, which is really hard to do nowadays, and the music is just awesome. Connery, Cage, and Ed Harris [who plays the marine general] all shine in their own moments throughout the entire movie. The action scenes are great, lots of deaf-defying maneuvers, which occur on the top of a lighthouse, and below the island itself on an abandoned coal mining track.

The marines even turn on each other at the end which leads to the shocking conclusion at the very end, if you haven't seen it yet I won't ruin it. Connery is the one who really shines and proves it in an absolutely breathtaking scene when he rolls under a buring furnace to unlock a door from the other side.

This is truly a masterpeice to suspension and action. Lots of other small characters help out to support the main actors and the ending is truly great. This is a must have for any fan of great action and great acting.",1094428800,,2036,4.447721179624665

His ravishing acting literally gave the required dosis of reflexive , inquiring and chess mate mind who will allow him as the effective antihero to win his particular challenge and personal when he must face the master and commander leader of this renegade corp of soldiers who decided to menace San Francisco if their demands are not satisfied. They are looking for the late recognizement and economic benefits for the family of those soldiers who fell in the war .
The film is hyperkinetic ; the action scenes are loaded of high tension thanks to a credible script it keeps your interest till the end .
Even the formal considerations are a question of fairness , the main reason who led these soldiers to act by themselves will vanish progressively , looking for the action instead the dramatic nucleus .

823206,4,6304258984,"The Michael Bay - Jerry Bruckheimer formula, like that for the James Bond films, is pretty well set: lots of stuff blowing up, lots of bodies flying through the air, a cast dominated by strong male leads, women are very secondary, a very dramatic music score, lots of foul language and a very right of center political outlook (the military are always the heroes and anyone who questions the heroes' judgment are pansies or some other leftwing radical type). However, the James Bond films always had a sly sense of humor about themselves. Bond might save the American Space program, Fort Knox, Miami and the planet Earth, but there was always an underlying message: This is just for fun folks. The Bay-Bruckheimer films, however, have the delusion that they're actually fighting the battles depicted on screen. There's a lot of overwrought music, emotional scenes between the characters and slow motion closups of the hero(es) walking or running towards their battle with evil. The Rock, in this way, is no different. A team of marines, led by General Frank Hummell (Ed Harris) and disgusted with the way the U.S. Government has neglected the families of those soldiers killed in illegal missions abroad, has taken 81 hostages on Alcatraz, threatening to lauch nerve gas rockets into San Francisco unless reparations are paid to those soldiers' survivors. Heavy, heavy stuff.
However, injected into this serious mix is none other than the best James Bond himself -- Sean Connery. Even in the more serious early Bonds, Connery always managed to convey to the audience that they were supposed to have fun during these films. Bruckheimer and Bay do their best to elevate what is essentially Saturday morning action serial material into Wagnerian opera. But there is Connery, putting all the action into perspective by not taking anyting too seriously and grounding the material by recognizing what it really is: sheer entertainment.
Bay, Bruckheimer and company keep trying to push the fact that Ed Harris' desperate General Hummell is a man of honor, a real hero, etc., etc. Anyone who questions his judgment, like the hapless, simpering Presidential Chief of Staff at the first briefing scene, is shot down as a liberal wimp who would never make the sacrifices that Harris' character made for America and should shut up before one of the real men in the room shoot him (I wonder what George McGovern, Daniel Inouye and other liberals who fought for and were decorated for fighting for their country think of this kind of portrayal). Never mind that the General threatens to kill thousands of San Franciscans with nerve gas. Bay-Bruckheimer have stacked the deck by having the great Ed Harris play General Hummell, giving the character an inherent integrity that can't help but make him sympathetic. Fox News isn't this slanted.
In walks Connery who, in his big confrontation scene with Harris, gets right to the heart of the matter in a few lines. He correctly says that he doesn't see how ""you cherish the memory of the dead by killing another million"" and sums up Hummell's actions as ""an act of lunacy."" In one fell swoop, Connery slaps the collective message of the film across the face and shows that terrorism is terrorism, no matter if it's done by decorated U.S. soldiers with a legitimate gripe against the government. It's fairly certain that Connery, an executive producer of the film, purposely torpedoed Bay-Bruckheimer's testosterone toned view of the world.
In The Rock, Connery proves, once again, that an actor with a strong enough presence and a large amount of talent doesn't need to scream and shout to give a great performance. Nicholas Cage, Connery's co-star, bellows and shouts like he's on fire most of the film (""How, in Zeus' BUTTHOLE did you get out of your cell?!?!?!?!?!?"" -- god, give it a rest, Nick!). Cage certainly isn't alone -- the rest of the cast buys into Bay-Bruckheimer's ""this film is the most important thing you'll ever watch"" mentality. However, Sean Connery, with his charm, wit and grace, throws a bucket of cold water over the entire proceedings and reminds everyone that the film is what it is and nothing more: a technically superb action film that exists merely to entertain ... period.
A final note: Criterion has always produced the finest quality DVD's loaded with many, many interesting extras. Most of the films Criterion has released are classics: Notorious, Roshamon, Ikiru, Yojimbo, Charade, Rebecca, etc. I enjoyed The Rock, but why did Criterion deem it good enough to rank with the other films they've released on DVD?

823314,4,6304258984,"Okay, perhaps I am being very hasty with making that proclamation, since I'll admit I haven't seen any other Michael Bay film other than this one and ARMAGEDDON. Still, I cannot imagine that this much-maligned director has made a better action movie than this one. ARMAGEDDON was an ugly, bloated, flagrantly manipulative piece of action drivel. THE ROCK, on the other hand, may be just as manipulative, but I'll pick this very good pure action flick over ARMAGEDDON any day.
What's good about this particular action movie? Unlike ARMAGEDDON, THE ROCK doesn't attempt to be something more than good action entertainment. There are no synethetic emotions and all that nauseatingly insistent patriotism that seriously marred ARAMGEDDON, despite the fact that the antagonist of this movie is a former general who is looking for restitution for families of soldiers who died in combat under his command. THE ROCK is purely what it is, an action flick. As it turns out, it is a very skillful one at that, with convincing performances from all three leads (Sean Connery, Nicholas Cage, and Ed Harris) and exciting action scenes all around.
As for the plot, no, it is not particularly fresh (with elements borrowed from DIE HARD and even PULP FICTION), but the script adds some interesting elements to the equation, particularly with Ed Harris' General Hummel, who all throughout shows significant sympathetic human dimensions that make him stand out from the usual one-dimensional snarling villain. I liked those touches, as well as the twist at the end, in which the villains of the story seem to shift. It is with that twist that THE ROCK truly does stand apart from the action-movie crowd.

The cinematography is topflight, as is the direction, and it will keep you interested until the end, as a good yarn should.

I would rate it as an easy five stars except for the message the story-line pushes: that the government has stiffed our combat soldiers and treated them with anonimity, and when they are killed refused to treat their survivors fairly.  This is simply not even remotely true, and for me it almost ruined an otherwise good story.  It was the supposed motivation for the heavy, very well played by Ed Harris (who played John Glenn in The Right Stuff), to lead a terror attack on his own country--a man whom, in the story had won the Congressional Medal of Honor (In my years in the service I met only one such man).  In the story the other military men simpathized with him.  So unlikely an event that it almost made me vomit. I know of what I speak.  I was retired for service-connected disability, and have been very will treated by my grateful nation.

The writer also took the usual jabs at J. Edgar Hoover, one of the Hollywood left's favorite targets, and finally insinuated in the conspiracy theory of JFK's death with the clear implication that the government was involved, as well as an allusion to the Roswell 'flying saucer' secrecy conspiracy wherein the U.S. Air Force was supposed to have captured alien spacemen and kept it secret--another kook favorite.

This is a fine film, well acted and produced.  Forgive me if I dwell overmuch on the leftist propaganda aspects which are, after all, typical fodder from Hollywood.  But I get very tired of story lines that always, always make our government the bad guy, all in the name of entertainment, and contribute to that image among people who know no better.

It WAS good entertainment.  I'm probably just too politically inclined to give an objective view.

823397,3,6304258984,"The last decade of family entertainment has produced few men's films.  ""The Rock"" is a notable exception, a man's film that addresses the issue of domestic terrorism.
A disgruntled Marine General and his men attack a military weapons depot and steal rockets with chemical warheads.  The General's team seizes Alcatraz and 81 hostages, then threatens to fire the rockets into the City of San Francisco if a monetary ransom is not paid.  The Government assembles a counterterrorism team that includes Navy Seals, an FBI chemical weapons laboratory expert (played by Nicolas Cage), and the only man who knows how to break *into* Alcatraz (played by Sean Connery).
""The Rock"" provides an interesting view of military Special Operations in an impressive setting.  The General's team controls the schedule; plus they have advance planning, ample weapons, good communications, and the element of surprise.  The Government's counterterrorism team *reacts*: the Navy Seal team is trained and ready to fight, but Nicolas Cage's chemical weapons expert is a scholar rather than a warrior, and Sean Connery's character (a British agent who learned too much) has been imprisoned for thirty years without a trial.  Nicolas Cage's character reluctantly agrees to join the Navy Seal team -- it is his job.  Sean Connery's character reluctantly agrees to join the Navy Seal team -- it temporarily gets him out of prison.  The General's team attempts to follow their methodical plan.  The counterterrorism team attempts to disrupt that plan.  Each disruption reduces the General's team's threat at the cost of unmanaged bloodshed.
The United States currently is at war, and The Department of Homeland Security is concentrating on countering foreign terrorist activity.  In a postwar downsized (stagflating?) United States domestic economy, The Department of Homeland Security probably will be forced to reexamine the threat represented by domestic terrorists using stolen military ordinance.",1049846400,5,1973,5.457236842105263

Nicolas Cage does a great job as Stanley Goodspeed, and any action movie with Sean Connery should be strong as well.  Highly recommended.",1035417600,,510,4.5

823504,5,6304258984,"This is a great movie.  I'd recommend the movie to any lover of Sean Connery, Nick Cage, Ed Harris, or action movies.  Any type of movie for that matter. Sean Connery seems made for this role, a bitter British agent improsoned for life without trial.  His cynisism and great quips make this movie a joy to watch.  He constantly will snap back to Nick Cage with a wonderful little quote, my favorite being ""Loser's whine about doing their best..... Nick Cage also gives a great performance, and he seems almost made for the role as a reluctant chemical engeneer thrust into an environment he doesn't understand with a man he doesn't trust or know.  The movie plays Cage off of Connery, and the result is great dialouge mixed with awesome action sequences.  Ed Harris plays the angered general who doesn't want his men, killed in top secret missions with him, to have their families go uncompinsated.  You get a great view at his inner torments of wanting his goals to be completed, however, he doesn't want to be responsible for the deaths of many people in San Fransisco.  The movie's action and acting is superb, and it is one of my favorite movies.  I'd definatly recommend it.",1032825600,,1179,4.657004830917875

823506,4,6304258984,"The words ""Jerry Bruckhemier production"" make me cringe, since that typically equates to unexciting action movies that follow a ""race against the clock"" formula and lots and lots of comic relief humor that doesn't work. Even though The Rock follows the formula to a T, yep, it works, and I'm not even sure how. All I know is that I was too enthralled to give a damn about things like plot holes, character development (which the film actually has a decent amount of), and predictability.
The plot goes like this: General Hummel (Ed Harris) is a highly decorated military man upset that the men that died under his command received no medals, their families given no compensation, and not even proper burials. So, he and nineteen highly trained soldiers steal several rounds worth of deadly VX gas, hole up in Alcatraz, complete with rockets to launch the poisonous substance into the general vicinity in San Francisco. Once informed of Hummel's demands (83 million dollars in one day), the FBI brings in top chemical expert Stanley Goodspeed (Nicolas Cage) and former Alcatraz prisoner and British Spy, John Mason (Sean Connery) to help the Navy Seals break in and defuse the situation. Things don't go according to plan, and Goodspeed and Mason are left alone to battle Hummel's men and keep the rockets from launching.
Infamous director Michael Bay, known for his hyperkinetic editing, displays his speedy style prominently, which is definitely a problem, but for the most part, the action sequences are very tense and exciting (bolstered by Hans Zimmer's blistering score). Cage and Connery are both likeable, enough that we certainly want them to get out of the situation alive and unharmed, which adds some good suspense to the proceedings. Ed Harris brings a bit of depth into his ""villain"" role, making him more sympathetic than hissable (that should be saved for the men under his command). Place in some big laughs, and we've got a jolly good crowdpleaser that, despite a hell of a lot of silly and stupid moments, comes across as first-rate entertainment.

The trick is not to give the audience a breather to catch the seams. That and to really overdo the premise. The bad guys are the coverts' kind of covert, led with square-jawed nobility by Ed Harris (straight man to Connery's dry cracks and Cage's tomfoolery), whose renegade Marines hijack Alcatraz and train rockets, laced with ultra lethal chemical bath drops, on San Francisco. Who you gonna call? Try ex-SAS man Connery (stealer of every known secret of the US government and a prison break specialist so good he's been behind bars for 30 years) and not-up-to-it FBI guy Cage (chemo swot and Beatles freak). What the film does lack in novelty, it makes up for with fast-paced action, cool cars, some great set pieces and big noisy things exploding. Dumb, fun action. The DVD extras are great too.",1020470400,,994,4.887573964497041
823510,5,6304258984,"The Rock Dvd was the first disc I bought when I finally purchased a DVD player 4 years ago. It was my favorite movie at that time and it still remains so. Unfortunately the disc didn't include ANY extras at all and the picture transfer and sound quality were below average. Last year,when I heard that The Rock was getting a Criterion release it so much deserved,this was one of the best DVD news I ever got.
General Hummel (Ed Harris)is highly frustrated because many soldiers under his command died in secret operations and they didn't get the treatment they deserved from the government. Hummel is determined to change that,and when all else fails, with the help of ex-marines,he seizes control of Alcatraz Prison,which is now a tourist attraction,and threatens to launch chemical weapons on San Fransisco unless his demands are met. The government decides to infiltrate the island with marines,and they also need the help of FBI biochemist Stanley Goodspeed (Nicolas Cage),who is more of a science man than an action man. However,nobody knows much about Alcatraz's infrastructure and the maze of tunnels below the rock,and the only person who owns that kind of information is the only person who has ever been able to escape from there,John Mason (Sean Connery),a man who has been held in prison for many years without trial,and we don't know why. Goodspeed,Mason and the marines team up to enter the rock,neutralize the chemical weapons and release the hostages. As the movie progresses,we also learn more about Mason,his past,why he was in prison and who he is.
The Rock is one of the best action movies ever,if not the best. The primary reason is I think the presence of 3 great actors,who take their characters seriously,which sets the movie apart from the competition. Ed Harris plays General Hummel beautifully,we can never be sure whether he will actually ""do it"",Sean Connery is Sean Connery as usual and Mason character will remind many people of another character Connery is so famous for,and finally Nic Cage,in maybe his first great action movie,portays an original and often funny character. Director Michael Bay's fast cutting techniques and visual stylization is a nice fit for this kind of film,although many people don't take him as a serious director. The script seems composed of parts from many other movies we have seen before,but still,The Rock somehow manages to be interesting. The original score by Hans Zimmer is genuinely magnicifent and is one of the other reasons why the Rock is sensational.
The Dvd extras are a handful and I don't think you will be disappointed. There is a commentary by Michael Bay,Cage,producer Bruckheimer and Ed Harris. It is a bit dull and I wish it included Connery as well. The other extras are special effect analysis,the history of Alcatraz,world premiere and some outtakes and deleted extended scenes. What sets the criterion edition apart from the previous version is the anomorphic digital transfer,and the picture&sound quality. If you want the Rock as a part of your collection,Criterion edition is the right one for you.
If you are into action movies,I can not think of a reason why you shouldn't like The Rock. And even if you already own the previous dvd edition,you definitely should consider buying this one too..",1018569600,,3285,5.007312614259598
823511,5,6304258984,"One word to describe it ""Great!"" Ed Harris stars as General Frank Hummel who seizes control of Alcatraz. Only chemical specialist Goodspeed(Nicolas Cage) and a trained killer(Sean Connery) have what it takes to defuse the rockets and stop the bad guys.

823512,5,6304258984,"Jerry Bruckheimer might have made some bad movies in the last couple of years (Armageddon and Pearl Harbor, I'm looking at you!), but he and Don Simpson, along with director Michael Bay, teamed for one of the best action movies I've ever seen.
Nicolas Cage is simply outstanding as Stanley Goodspeed, the FBI agent who is thrown into the hostage situation.  Rather than play the role like your typical action hero, Cage chose to make Goodspeed an Everyman.  While it's a little cliche, I haven't seen it done much better than in The Rock.  He reacts the way most people would to his first dive, his first dead body, etc.
Ed Harris is also excellent as General Hummel, who is not the typical bad guy.  He really is more of a tragic figure and comes across that way on screen.  Hummel doesn't want to kill people, but he knows it's the best way to get what he wants.
But the best part of this movie is the chemistry between Cage and Sean Connery.  Up until the very end, you never know whether he and Connery are really on the same team.  But the interplay between the two is spectacular.  From the car chase to the final moments on Alcatraz, the two go back and forth like they were married.  They might seem like they hate each other, but you can see the mutual respect building.
The action scenes are also incredible, helped in part by the outstanding soundtrack.  The adrenaline runs high as Connery tears up San Francisco in a humvee, a massive gunfight takes place in the shower room of Alcatraz, and Goodspeed tries to disarm the rockets before the Air Force bombs the prison.
The extras in the Criterion Collection aren't great, although there are some really interesting ones.  The piece on Hollywood gunplay is really cool.  Otherwise, the other extras include footage from the premier and the trailers, which probably could have been fit on one DVD.  But the movie more than makes up for the lack of extras.
Overall, I highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves action.  The sharp script and outstanding action sequences make a great movie.",1015286400,5,2054,4.607142857142857

The sound is excellent, and the movie is a pleasure to hear, but the image is not as good, in some scenes one can look that it is a little bit grainy, I don't know what happened in the restoration process, but it certainly came short.
About the bonus material, they're just good. And one thing this edition lacks of is spanish subtitles, why is that important? Well, there's an important spanish-speaking community in the US and a growing one in Canada that would appreciate that! (and that goes for most of the Region 1 coded DVD's) and there are no criterion edition DVD's in Region 4 format.

823626,4,6304258984,"In Michael Bay's action film ""The Rock,"" a disgruntled retired Marine general takes hold of top secret biological weapons in an attack on the United States government's ignorance of its fallen soldiers. If this sounds contrived to you, trust me, you're in the right territory. Almost every aspect of this film is bogus, unbelievable in its logic, but here's the good part: it never really matters.
With producer Jerry Bruckheimer and director Bay at the helm of the project, ""The Rock"" whips its ludicrous story into shape with the very adept use of special effects, a witty and serviceable script, and a trio of lead actors who bring it all to life with a combination of zest, charm, and supercharged intensity. It's got the guts, the ammo, and the brains to make us forget about its story holes and pay attention to the thrill of everything going on before our eyes, and man, it never stops moving.
The action begins when U.S. Marine general Frank Hummel (Ed Harris) uses his military status to penetrate a high-security armory and lift dangerous biochemical warfare missiles. Once in possession of the weapons and a crew of devoted Marines, Hummel makes his way to Alcatraz, where he takes a group of eighty-one tourists hostage in a revenge plot against the American government for their refusal to grant compensation to the families of his men who died in Operation Desert Storm. His terms: a delivery of $100 million to be divided among the families of those who lost loved ones, or the missiles are to be launched into the heart of San Francisco.
Hummel's knowledge of military intelligence is baffling to the FBI, who agree to his order for compensation while secretly devising a plan of catching the band of Marines offguard. To do this, they call in Dr. Stanley Goodspeed (Nicolas Cage), an expert in biochemical weapons whose main objective is to diffuse the missiles on the island. Leading the team of soldiers is convict John Mason (Sean Connery), whose imprisonment and escape from Alcatraz decades before is vital to their successful entry into the now-defunct facility.
Mind you, this is not one of the most intelligent thrillers ever made; there are illogical occurrences and events that are not to be believed as realistic. Hummel's ease in attaining his arsenal is one such point: if these missiles are as dangerous as everyone keeps saying, then the security surrounding them would be triple the amount of what the movie portrays. Also unclear is the way in which Hummel and his men bring their weapons to the island, and it's also very unlikely that a trio of helicopters could land on the island without so much as a questioning eye from civilians of San Francisco, who are never made aware of the threat that awaits them.
These elements aside, this is a movie that is jam-packed with action, one of the finer examples of a thriller in years. Any inhibitions (and they are few) give way to tense sequences of explosions, exchanges of gunfire, and the race-against-time factor as the deadline begins to reach its completion. Bay knows just how to work his audience into a frenzy of suspense, with tightly-knit scenes of incredible energy and pacing that keeps the movie at a feverpitch. He keeps these scenes coming one after another while also working them into the sequence of events, so that they have a purpose rather than just being there for show.
The terrific casting of Cage against type and Connery in one of his best modern roles is another one of the movie's assets, to say nothing of the brilliant performance handed in by Harris. Harris is able to portray Hummel as more than just a one-dimensional character; as the time draws closer to the launching of the missiles, we can see him becoming more frantic and unstable. Cage is supremely funny as Goodspeed, who has no knowledge of combat; when crossed with Connery's performance as Mason, who is a self-proclaimed escape artist, the result is some of the wittiest and sharpest humor in an action movie to date.
""The Rock"" isn't stellar moviemaking, but its grand entertainment with a very nice touch from its cast and crew. The acting zeal adds greatly to the softening of what could have become a serious, and seriously boring, action film, while the scenes of action themselves are charged with incredible energy that results in nothing less than sheer excitement.",1010880000,,4351,4.849462365591398

The film The Rock is about a retired army veteran (Ed Harris) who wants compensation for a group of soldiers who weren't even acknowledeged after loosing their life in the line of war.

Now San Fransisco's only hope is with an man (Sean Connery) who is still doing life in prison after he escaped Alcatrez, and his help is needed to sneak into the prison and with the help of a nuclear scientist (Nicholas Cage), they must take out the nuclear missiles.

A real edge-of-the-seat action thriller full of great images and astonishing sound.
But the DVD release surely could be a higher quality stuff in terms of including a couple of more extras than the simple trailer.
Perhaps an interview to the actors or the director, backstage videos, or something like that. Action movies are particularly apt for enhancing them with that kind of extras, because the watcher always wants to know how this or that scene was footed. And of course the director's comments are always welcome.
I've got several early- and mid-80s action and suspense movies that include those cinema-fans most wanted features. Strangely this late-90s release lacks them.
In fact, after you watched to the movie a couple of times at the cinema, perhaps another two or three times at home, there's no further interest in the movie itself. But backstage videos or any kind of add-ons you could not see in cinemas surely can show you a different aproach to the subject.

Get this beast of a DVD for sound quality, but also if you're a Sean Connery, Ed Harris or Nicholas Cage fan.
Cheers to another great Criterion release!

This DVD edition of The Rock has a really mind blowing, sharp picture and audio transfer. I thought I was back in the cinema watching this movie again, it's that vivid. The Rock boasts fine performances from Nicolas Cage and Sean Connery.

MY REVIEW:
""This is one of my top favorite movies!  THE ROCK is one of the coolest action movies around! Film making team MICHAEL BAY and JERRY BRUCKHEIMER make the best movies including: ARMAGEDDON and PEARL HARBOR!  Nicolas Cage is awesome, and is hilarious as well as Sean Connery!  This movie deserved BEST PICTURE in '96 at the Academy Awards!  BOTTOM LINE: This movie is superb!  It is a non-stop action packed thrill ride of sheer adventure- one of the biggest actioners ever made- if you liked Nicolas Cage in GONE IN 60 SECONDS, FACE/OFF and CON AIR, and if you liked SEAN CONNERY as James Bond- then you will love THE ROCK- especially if you're a big-time action fan!  See this movie ASAP!  It is awesome""- MJV & the Movies",992044800,2,1139,4.746192893401015

823799,5,6304258984,"This DVD is superb! The transfer is brilliant, the extra's are amazing, and the film is one of the best action movies ever made! The Film: The plot of the movie is as follows. A Marine General (Ed Harris) steals some chemical weapons and takes the old prison of Alcatraz as his base of operations. He trains the weapons on San Fransisco, and tells the government that he wants money to be given to the families of the Marines killed under his command. The government turns to an FBI chemical specialist (Nicolas Cage), an imprisoned ex-SAS soldier (Sean Connery) and a team of Navy SEALs (led by Michael Biehn) to get rid of the threat. Needless to say, there are a lot of explosions and gun battles during the course of the assault on Alcatraz.
The Extras: The extras on this edition are brilliant! The best feature is The Do's and Don'ts of HollyWood Gunplay, hosted by Harry Humphries and Marshall Teague (he plays one of the SEALs in the movie). It shows some of the mistakes made in films during gun sequences, and how dangerous these can be. Other extras include a brilliant documentary about the prison itself, and some great info about the special effects in the movie.

Who's to save the day? A FBI chemical ""super freak"" with no combat experience (Nicholas Cage) and a retired British Intelligence Agent (Sean Connery) who was a prisoner in Alcatraz. Both must use their wits in order to survive the wrath of the General and the trigger-happy Marines who are loyal to him. Pretty excellent movie from the stealing of the missiles, to the chase in San Francisco and to the fact when Stanley Goodspeed and John Mason find out that they must fight to the end in order to save San Francisco, Alcatraz, and their own lives. Why is it that this movie is good? It has all the elements of an action movie.
One star for gripping story. One star for excellent sound and visuals. One star for action other than huge gunfights like the Matrix or aerial situations such as Air Force One. One star for a different type of hero: A scared chemical expert and an aged man who still got his combat skills! One star for the ending (I won't tell you. You'll have to see it!)

823882,5,6304258984,"Never a dull moment in this is a great action flick.  This may be the best of its genre in a long, long time.  Jerry Bruckheimer has outdone himself.  The movie opens with the two great scenes, including the well planned (and almost perfectly implemented) break in at an Army arsenal and the disarming of a terrorist bomb by Cage at work.  The action does not let up until the final climactic struggles.
Great casting, with Sean Connery as a political prisoner (and former member of the British elite Special Air Service, the only man alive to break out of Alcatraz).  Add Nicholas Cage as  FBI agent (and self-described biochemical ""super freak"", who of course is grossly overmatched among these hard guys.  Their foil is Ed Harris, who is great  as a highly decorated military officer, disillusioned by the betrayal of his men during Desert Storm, and his cadre of soldiers.  The supporting roles include David Morse, John McGinley and Greg Collins as his loyal soldiers, and John Spencer as a less than honorable FBI director  They are all joined at Alcatraz prison, taken over by Harris and his men.  They hold a few hostages (irrelevant to the story), along with rockets filled with deadly poison gas. Unless the government pays the big bucks, they will unleash their deadly toxins. Only a sixty year old Connery can get them onto the Rock, with the support of a  group of Navy Seals and fighter planes to save the day.
Of course, they do.

The Rock is a film that is full of special effects and features some of the best actors around ta the moment.  The Rock stars Sean Connery and Nicholas Cage who have to team up on Alcatraz to help stop someone unleashing a missile on the centre of America.  Sean Connery was formaly a prisoner in Alcatraz and the only one ever to escape which is why he teams up with Nicholas cage as he knows the prison inside out.

The Rock is about a General played by actor (Ed Harris) who's fed up with the United States congress not allowing soldiers who've died in battle have propper funds for their families and burial when their bodies could not be recovered during and after the wars. He takes his team of rogue Marines to a Military Installation, steals a dozen or so VX poison gas rockets, but not before losing a man. He then, captures a tourism class that is viewing Alkatraz Prison, also known as the Rock. Once the U.S are informed of this, they recruit Special Agent Stanley Goodspeed played by actor (Nicholas Cage) whom is expecting a child with his girlfriend. In order to enter the Rock, they need an expert. Enter John Mason played by actor (Sean Connery) who happens to be an ex-British SAS operative who's stole microfilm from FBI Dir.

I unfortunatly own the normal edition because the Criterion Collection wasn't out yet.  Believe me if it was I would have bought it.  I have to assume the Criterion collection is unbelievably amazing.  A whole second DVD of extra stuff.  I also own Gladiator on DVD and I really appreciate the second disk.
I will quickly discribe the story to you.  A US general gone mad[gen. Hummel (ED HARRIS)] takes over Alcatraz(or the rock)threatening to launch a battery of very dangerous gas rockets into the heart of San Francisco. The US government decides to send in a SWAT team of Navy Seals.  Along with the Navy Seals the government sends chemical weapons specialist Stanley Goodspeed(Nicholas Cage) and the only person to successfully escape Alcatraz, John Mason(Sean Connery).  The SWAT team enters the rock and all members are brutally killed in a major battle, except Goodspeed and Mason.  It is now up to them to defeat a platoon-full of elite marines before the entire San Francisco population is inhialated.
The Rock is a truly superb movie and will be enjoyed by all.  It has a great story,cast & crew, dialogue and action scenes.  Stanley Goodspeed's fiance is really hot!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",988070400,2,1377,5.04424778761062

It has a good story (never mind some of the plot holes this is a movie!), tons of action and great shots that make it look very slick.
The DVD presented by those generous folks at Criterion is pretty good.  The video transfer is exceptionally good with only a few artefacts here and there.  The sound comes in DTS and Dolby Digital and both are loud and make full use of the surrounds. The score by Hans Zimmer just roars into action.
The special features are extensive with a commentary and several interesting documentaries.  It is a pretty extensive (not more so than Armageddon) 2 disc set with a very interesting commentary on disc 1.  The Hollywood Gunplay feature is one of the more interesting ones that deserve a mention

823968,4,6304258984,"A whiteknuckle thriller and a true triumph of style over substance, Michael Bay's 'The Rock' would be wholly unbelievable were it not for the fact that it never slows down to give it's audience time to think. From one frame to the next, it moves quickly and brutally. Gun fights and explosions act as punctuation marks for every scene. For sheer 'bang-for-your-buck' entertainment, you can do no better. Producer Jerry Bruckheimer has this genre of film so nailed down, it's impossible to deny the sheer power of this film. Add to it four great performances by Nicolas Cage, Ed Harris, Michael Biehn, and the always amazing Sean Connery and you have a movie so thrilling you may just have to reupholster your easy chair after hitting EJECT. The story revolves around retired Marine Ed Harris who kidnaps a bunch of tourists and sets up base on the deserted prison island Alcatraz. He demands restitution to the families of his fellow Marines who have died during covert operations. If his demands are not met, he will launch rockets containing a deadly (to say the least) chemical agent on San Francisco. Nicolas Cage is a skilled FBI scientist, trained in chemical warfare and Michael Biehn is the leader of the Marine group who will attempt to break into Alcatraz and stop Harris's plan. The FBI will use Sean Connery to help them break into Alcatraz (as he is the only man ever to break out of The Rock). The problem there is that Connery is a British spy who has been unrightfully imprisioned for the past 30 years and has quite the chip on his shoulder about it. 'The Rock' speeds it's way from here to there, never taking the time to do any real character development or plot analysis (aside from Harris' character, no one in the film really seems that well layered), and that is decidely a good thing. The action sequences in the film are truly amazing, including a car chase through the busy streets of San Francisco and a massive gun fight between the 'good' and the 'bad' marines. The film is also laced with more one-liners then your average TV-sitcom, sparking the films 'quiet times' with a great amount of personality and wit. This is certainly not a stupid film by any means, even though some of the plot devices are trite and predictability hangs over the outcome. But for 136 minutes we are riveted and thrilled. This is a wild roller-coaster ride that you will not be sorry for getting on. The special 2-disc Criterion set is loaded with extras, verything from interviews and making-of featurettes, and the film's transfer is gorgeous. A great way to enjoy the film and a nice addition to any action film fan's collection.",986256000,3,2640,4.704103671706264

Sean Connery does a great job as the old spy who's unjustly imprisoned after all these years.  This movie is not about substance.  It is purely designed for style.

So if you're looking to show off your DVD player and sound system, this isn't a bad choice.  Plus the whole second disc of extras are really cool.

So if you don't have a dts surround system you might as well keep your old copy of the Rock. All of the other feature are just plain boring, especially for such an exciting movie. The commentary is really bad. All of the voice-overs are recorded separately. Sometimes they'll get cut off before finishing the point they were trying to make. You'll also wonder if they are even watching the movie sometimes. The Jerry Bruckheimer ""interview"" is also pretty dull. It's just him talking to a microphone about his film career. Also the outtakes can't make up for the lack of deleted scenes.  So the movie has to stand up on its own, which it does.

823972,5,6304258984,"Hey, Darth-Jeyl here, about to review the Rock-CC (Criterion Collection).
 When I first saw the Rock back in 1996, it immediately became one of my favorite action movies of that year. It was for me, so rare to see an action film that was so focused on its story, character development, and at the same time be very entertaining. The story was good, the characters believable, the acting was solid, the soundtrack was powerful, and the directing was excellent. When the film was introduced to DVD for the first time in 1997, it left a lot to be desired. The DVD transfer for the film came straight from the Laser Disc version, and was non-anamorphic (Not enhanced for widescreen TV's). The DVD was also featureless, carrying only the teaser trailer for the film. The only good thing about the DVD was it's 5.1 Dolby Digital surround track. Four years later, when I heard about a Criterion version of the film coming out to DVD, I had low hopes. Why? Let me explain. This is the second time Michael Bay has released one of his films from Criterion. The first movie he launched from Criterion was Armageddon. Though the DVD featured a lot of extras, a 5.1 Dolby surround, and a new digital transfer, the video wasn't Anamorphic. That was a big disappointment, since the other DVD version of the film wasn't anamorphic either. So, when I heard that Michael Bay was re-releasing the Rock as a 2 disc Criterion edition, I thought it was going to be like the Armageddon Criterion Edition. Now that I got the DVD, let's move on to the full review.
Story: When a highly decorated, retired Marine General (Ed Harris) and his army seize a stockpile of chemical weapons, and take over Alcatraz (aka The Rock), he demands Restitution to the families of the soldiers that died in covert operations. If the payment is refused, he will launch the chemical weapons at the heart of San Francisco. As the Pentagon debates on how to handle the situation, they decide to send an elite Navy Seal team to go into Alcatraz, disarm the weapons, and take the island. Since the power of the chemical weapons is extreme, they bring in an FBI Chemical Expert, Stanley Goodspeed(Nicolas Cage) to help them with the disarmament. The problem, how do you get into Alcatraz? Since all known experts on the island are dead, they bring in a former Alcatraz prisoner John Mason(Sean Connery) who once escaped Alcatraz, to assist the team on getting in. Thanks to Mason's knowledge, the team makes it into the island undetected. However, after walking in to an unsuspected trap, everyone on the team except Mason and Goodspeed are killed. Now, it's up to a chemical freak who has never seen combat, and a former prisoner who hasn't seen combat for over 30 years, to carry out the mission alone. Their problem? They've got 20 professionally trained killer marines on the hunt for them, 15 deadly chemical weapons to defuse, the entire population of San Francisco to save, and only 15 hours to complete the mission.
Disc 1-The Movie: The Rock on Disc 1, is presented in it's original aspect ratio 2.35:1 in an anamorphic transfer. Which means it's ENHANCED! Not only that, but it's also got a new digital transfer that looks absolutely gorgeous. There are hardly any signs of grain, the colors look very solid, and the letterbox framing is very accurate. This is one of the best transfers Criterion has ever released for a film. For the audio side, we get 4 audio tracks. A Dolby Digital and DTS 5.1 surround sound tracks, a 2.0 Dolby surround, and a Commentary Track. To sum up the audio for ya, if you have a 5.1 Dolby or DTS setup, it will destroy your home. From the beginning of the film, the surround sound action is nearly constant. If you want to see what the audio is really made of, go to chapter 11(Car Chase), and crank up the audio. The Commentary track for The Rock features Director Michael Bay, producer Jerry Bruckheimer, actors Nicolas cage and Ed Harris, and technical advisor (and ex-Navy SEAL) Harry Humphries. Please keep in mind that this is not a group commentary. This is one of those commentaries where each participant recorded their portion separately and were than edited together. I know a lot of people who despise these types of tracks, but for this particular one, it really works. Each participant has something very useful to say about almost every scene in the movie. If you really want to know a lot more about the Rock, check out this track, it's actually the best part of the whole set in my opinion.
Disc 2-The Features: For the second disc, we get an average amount of features that are common on almost every 2 disc set. There is a lengthy interview with Jerry Bruckhimer that I found quite nice, an analysis of the dive sequence which is really cool(All those swimmers were puppets!), a movie magic episode on the film's special effects, a really nice documentary about the dos and don'ts of Hollywood gunplay, a documentary on Alcatraz itself which covers almost every aspect of the island's history, promotional material such as trailers, TV spots, and The Rock world premiere on the Alcatraz island itself, and a bunch of story boards and production drawings.
Final Comments: Well, this disc was a pleasure to get. I can finally watch the Rock as it was originally intended on my 16x9 television. I'm glad Criterion did all the right stuff with this DVD.
Goods: Great movie, good acting, Excellent Transfer, Great sound, wonderful commentary track, nice extras, and ENHANCED!
Bads: Though the second disc has many extras, some of them have almost nothing to do with the movie. Many people might find some of the extras pointless.

823973,4,6304258984,"A great all round action film, which has me SHOUTING AT THE TV, everytime!  From my hatred of the evil marine pair, and enthusiasm towards the SAS operative, the film succeeds in driving emotion from me!
With a unbelievable cast, from the Veterans Connery and Harris to the talented supporting cast, with the likes of David Mason, the film is one exciting moment after the next.  Some may be screaming at me for not mentioning Cage in the line-up above, but to be frank I felt that this was yet another of his performances that left me wanting to shout ""PLEASE GO TO AN ACTING CLASS!""  He is unconvincing and at times, just annoying... (as you can tell I'm not a fan)... however for me Connery carries the film with ease, and Cage is lost very easily amonst the acting giants.  With my most favourite scene as Connery and Harris' confrontal, it's a pure genius of a script which is carried through with fantastic deliverance and rapport between the actors.
Harris is a joy to watch, and he draws my attention in every scene, even when the action was far away from him.  His portrayal of the torn Brigadier-General, is what I will always remember him for.
Are the Marines truly terrorists, or patriots as they claim... Each one is driven by different ideals, whether leadership, justice, revenge, loyalty, greed, or even pure viciousness, and it's that blend that makes them and the story unpredictible.
After watching the film I am filled with such pride to be British, which is thanks completely to Sir Sean's character and performance... it is so refreshing to see a modern American film where we are in fact not the badies, but instead cruial to the plot's closure and 'happy ending'.  Although he is in fact a criminal and spy, he is a lovable rogue... and Connery draws on elements of his Bond career and characterisation extremely effectively to support his part in the film!
The film is definately NOT to be missed, especailly if you are either a Connery, Harris, or Cage fan, you shall not be disappointed.

Video: The video is very good, just like most criterion DVD's.

Extra's: There are enough extra's on the disc, they are not that good but the ""Movie Magic"" is very cool. To be honest I expected a little more from the extra's. But this is not a reason not to add this title to your collection.

823975,3,6304258984,"Any time there is a Criterion Collection release it is cause for some joy.  Criterion discs are almost without fail full of tons of bonus goodies that you can't find anywhere else, save the odd laserdisc collecter's set.  But the unfortunate side is that Criterion gives the royal treatment to some lackluster films, like ""Armaggedon"" and ""The Rock"".  If you liked ""The Rock"" you will have plenty to celebrate here -- anamorphic presentation, 5.1 stereo, etc, etc.  And it will give your home theater system a real workout.  I really didn't like this movie much, but I gotta admit -- this DVD sounds GREAT!!  But the biggest problem is with the movie itself.  It sinks under its own weight.  The action sequences certainly are visually and aurally impressive, but too little attention was paid to intelligent dialogue and scriptfare.  But that is of little interest to producer Jerry Bruckheimer, or so I assume.
Is ""The Rock - Criterion Collection"" worth owning?  Probably not, if you value having some dignity and taste in your home DVD library.  Is it worth renting for all the extras and killer sound?  Heck yeah!!  It is good for some dumb fun, but don't dignify this kind of moviemaking by making it a best-seller in the home DVD market.  Rent it, enjoy it (allowing for the dumb parts), and forget it.  There will be another dumb Michael Bay/Jerry Bruckheimer action-fest along soon enough.

824018,2,6304258984,"How is it that this director of summer shoot-'em-up blockbuster fare has managed to have not one, but TWO of his films (the other being ""Armageddon - Criterion Collection"") accepted into the exclusive Criterion family, a label typically reserved for ""important classic and contemporary films""?
Granted, ""The Rock"" was enjoyable.  With cheesy dialogue like ""I'll take pleasure in guttin' you, boy!"" and ""I drive a Volvo--a beige one"", what's not to like?  And, rest assured, Criterion will make this one look gorgeous.  All those explosions in downtown San Francisco, not to mention Sean Connery's fiery dive through the furnace once on the Rock will look fantastic, especially after you've adjusted your TV's color settings with the color bars Criterion will most certainly include on the DVD.
You'll thrill to the car chases in San Francisco, as Sean Connery pilots a stolen Humvee with reckless abandon!  You'll gasp as Nicolas Cage, who does a masterful job of playing Nicolas Cage, narrowly escapes a doomed Ferrari F355 from a hurtling, derailed streetcar!  You'll shudder as Ed Harris' mercenaries gun down an entire Seal team in the Alcatraz shower room (all except, that is, Sean and Nicolas, who then manage to overtake a battalion of money-hungry assassins by distracting them with lines like, ""Hi, my name's Stanley Goodspeed.  Glass or plastic?"")!
Yeah, this will be fantastic.  Meticulous lines recreated in Criterion-perfect subtitles.  They may even feature foreign subtitles, thereby making ""The Rock"" an international masterpiece.  Probably some deleted scenes....that means more cheesy dialogue!  And audio?  Guaranteed!  Nothing but the best.  The problem is, unfortunately, that you've seen it all before.  If not, you probably saw it the following summer, only it was called ""Con Air"".
I suppose Criterion, in their efforts to represent all genres of the film spectrum, must not overlook the high-budget summer blockbuster.  In this regard, ""The Rock"" satisfies, even if the material is recycled and touched up with new, stupendous dialogue.  Any film purist will appreciate the care which Criterion will apply to this print, as they apply to every other movie under their discriminating title.  For some people, that's enough.
There you go--I've defeated my own argument.  Put me down for a copy.  Kudos to Michael Bay and his boys for doing it again.",983491200,6,2373,5.263297872340425

It has all your typical elements of a Hollywood, cash cow, cookie cutter movie; former good guy gone wacky for what seems to him an honorable cause, hostages, a seemlessly planned terrorist attack, looks like there's no hope when the trained anti-terrorists get killed, average joe blow saves the day driven by the thought of his pregnant girlfriend.  However, it thankfully skips the atypical action acting element of Arnold, Sylvester, and John Claude and is replaced with a humorous Cage, believeable Harris, and sexy Connery.
Admittedly, it has some great action sequences, though I thought the San Fran car chase seen had it's cheesey moments.

824026,4,6304258984,"[Subtract a star if your plots must be plausible.]
Stanley Goodspeed (Nicolas Cage) -- what is this, a James Bond movie? -- is a chemical and  biological expert for the FBI. This is a guy who admits that he likes his  job and it shows. When he's thrown into a perilous situation, he gets off  on finding a way out. He's about to get off BIG TIME.
General Francis X.  Hummel (Ed Harris) has had enough. He's led Marines in highly covert  operations. His men have given their lives for their country and now their  country disavows(!) their actions and discards their families. Gen. Harris  has tried in vain to get the government to listen. Now, he's gonna make  them listen.
Hummel has assembled a crack team of commandos. First, he  and his team break into a military chemical facility and steal a form of  nerve gas called VX. This is pretty bad stuff. When one of his team jostled  and drops one of the pellets, he gets sealed in the vault and we get to  watch his skin boil and melt while he begs to be let out.
When we next  see Hummel and his comrades, they're taking the tour of Alcatraz Island in  San Francisco Bay. Before you know it, Hummel is letting the park ranger  know that the tour is over. He lets the Government know that he wants  reparations or there's gonna be lots of skin boiling in San  Francisco.
Enter John Patrick Mason (Sean Connery) -- maybe it IS a James  Bond movie. Mason is a federal prisoner. We soon learn that Mason had  actually escaped from Alcatraz even though it was generally thought that  Alcatraz was inescapable. It becomes Mason's job to lead Goodspeed and a  team of Navy SEALS onto Alcatraz and free the tourist hostages and save San  Francisco's citizens.
The Rock is not only an action movie, but it's  funny as well. You'll love the relationship between Cage and Connery. Also,  what about the mysterious (and hostile) relationship between Mason and an  FBI special agent (John Spencer)? What does the agent know about Mason that  he doesn't want any one else to know. The Rock works in so many wacko  conspiracy theories about the Government that you'll enjoy figuring out  which ones they left out.
The Rock is a great summer diversion. Despite  some goofy scenarios, the relationship of Mason and Goodspeed will carry  the day. Plus, there's TONS of action in this movie. It's nearly non-stop,  especially when Mason and the FBI nearly destroy San Francisco on their  own.
Spend a few bucks and enjoy. I recommend it!

But instead the made him a loser, who happens to  win.  I say that because you could tell he wasn't a tough guy.  Nicolas  Cage was a bit of a wimp in this 1.  Which was very entertaining to watch.  I loved his character!  Sean Connery is very true to the role of John  Mason.  There was a lota chemistry amounst the characters, especially  between Cage & Connery.  They played off each other very well.  Don't  get me wrong, the rest of the cast does an extremly great job.  This is a  movie I'd definitly recommend to everyone!",966988800,,842,4.11875
824126,5,6304258984,"First off we have Nicolas Cage, Sean Connery, and Ed Harris starring in this action movie.  Nicolas Cage is a ""chemical super-freak"" who  is directed to go to ""The Rock"" (Alcatraz) and difuse rockets  armed with VX gas that could take out the whole city of San Francisco.  Sean Connery is an ex-spy from Great Britain who has been held in our  prison system for almost 30 years because he stole microphones and film  that gave him the knowledge of the actual Kennedy assasination and some  other of our secrets and was never charged.  He has been chosen to lead  Cage and Navy Seals into The Rock through the underground drainage system,  because, well, he is the only man to escape!  Ed Harris is a decorated  veteran of the armed forces who was sick of seeing his soldiers die in  Vietnam and the Persian Gulf and not get the proper burial a fallen soldier  deserved.  He stole rockets containing the VX gas and threatens to launch  them at San Francisco if the boys back in D.C. do not meet his demands of  transferring money from various secret accounts so that the families of  these men receive the benefits they have never gotten and the soldiers who  are helping him will get paid and move to non-extradition treaty country so  they will face no charges.
What this all adds up to is a great action  flick.  Bruckheimer & Simpson deliver the best movie they have ever put  out (Simpsom passed in the making of the film, god rest his soul) arguably.  The on-screen chemistry between Nicolas and Sean is awesome and offer some  of the best one liners in movie history.  Ed Harris gives a great  performance and plays a great role!  If you have not seen this movie you  are missing perhaps one of the best action films made.  There is some  cheesiness and idiosincricies, but they are small and do not stand out.  As  Nicolas Cage's character Stanley Goodspeed said, Let's cut the chit-chat  A-Hole, buy this movie and watch it over and over again.",965692800,,1952,4.546242774566474

824128,5,6304258984,"""The Rock"" is yet another great Bruckenheimer movie, perhaps his best (although that is debatable because of ""Crimson Tide"" would give it a run for its money).
""The Rock"" features top notch  actors, something that is usually lacking in action flicks.  Instead of  lunchbox actors like Keanu Reeves, we get Ed Harris, Nicholas Cage and Sean  Connery.  The scenes in which Connery & Harris appear together are  almost electric - both have such an authoritative screen presence.  Micheal  Biehn once again plays a Seal, although this time it is a much better role  than the one he was given in that rather silly movie called ""Navy  Seals.""
One of the things I liked best about this movie is its  depiction of Special Forces.  I hate it when Hollywood makes elite fighting  groups (such as Navy Seals, Green Berets, Ninjas, etc.) look like a bunch  of incompetent buffoons.  ""The Rock"" features one of the most  favorable portayals of Marine Recon and Navy Seals that I have ever seen.
Now, to dispel some of the criticism of the movie that I have read.  Is  some of this movie unbelievable?  Of course it is.  It's an action movie.  It's not meant to be taken too seriously.  It is entertaining and delivers  on its promise of non-stop action.  You have everything from Marine Recon  vs. Navy Seals to a good  car chase which involves a Ferrari to an Air  Force air-strike, + a whole lotta neat stuff getting blown up.  It is also  about as plausible as action movies get.

Not quite on the level of  ""Face/Off"" (one of the absolute best action flicks I've seen),  but still not bad.

Cage, Connery and a SEAL  team try to penetrate the prison and defeat Harris' troops.
""The  Rock"" is a real triumph of a good story and great acting. Nicholas  Cage, Sean Connery and Ed Harris are all great in their roles. Connery in  particular has what it takes to be a star. I particularly enjoyed the scene  where he taunts Harris into showing his true colors by quoting Oscar Wilde.  Cage, Connery and Harris save the movie from the director.
And Bay is a  lousy director- his cut of the Humvee sequence gives you a throbing  headache, and his over-directs his actors. Fortunately this is a script  even he couldn't mess up.

824312,1,6304258984,"A Criterion edition of THIS? Michael Bay's ""The Rock"" (1996) ranks among the worst blockbusters produced by a major Hollywood studio. With bombastic Bay at the helm, you get the usual choppy editing, botched action sequences and dispirited tone. Sean Connery, Nicolas Cage and Ed Harris go through the motions for a big paycheck. The result is cinematic junk food  all schlock and no style.",935020800,4,390,5.0

824443,5,6304258984,"The rock starring Nicholas cage, Sean Connery and Ed harris is a modern day classic with all the characteristics of what makes a film great. Cage plays an FBI chemical weapons specialist selected to join the elite Navy  Seals team in a bid to overthrow a group of mercanaries and neutralize the  threat of a battery of VX poison gas rockets being fired upon the  unsuspecting citizens of San Fransisco. Connery however plays the part of an  ex SAS agent imprisoned by the US government for his knowledge of the  corrupt goings on in the Whitehouse. The only man ever to escape from  Alcatraz now comes back to haunt the Government that took thirty years of  his life being the only man alive to know how to get into the once feared  penitentiary. He Plays a vital part of this fantastic movie showing every  bit of skill acquired throughout his distinguished career and not once  showing his age. I rate this as a classic action film and recommend it to  everyone. the great acting, plot and music score are all well within the  confines what anyone would expect from any Don Simpson and Jerry  Bruckheimer production. i end this with a quote from the movie by ED harris  , if you have any doubts about seeing this film ""i hope this elevates  your thinking""",923443200,4,1257,4.549107142857143

And Cage plays his usual role.  A little psyco.  Ed  Harris is also excellant.  If your an action movie fan, buy this movie.  Also, look for Desperate Measures, Air Force One, Con Air, and Face/Off.",922924800,,365,4.409090909090909
