646622,5,6303450830,"We loved it and laughed all the way through it. I hope a real coach

doesn't have to go through all the antics that Fred MacMurray went

through.  You have to like Fred MacMurray to really appreciate

this movie.  I guess what made us laugh most were the teens.  Our

daughter was the same way. I wasn't sure either of us would live

through those times.",1142640000,8,354,4.257575757575758
646623,5,6303450830,"This is a warm and amusing film that rates high as a film you can enjoy with the entire family. Mary Loos and Richard Sale had a hand in the screenplay and once again a young Natalie Wood shows how talented she was as a child star. The versatile Fred MacMurray and Maureen O'Hara have a warm domestic husband and wife feel and Betty Lynn is very good as their oldest daughter, who as neighbor Jim Backus explains: ""Feels like Lana Turner on the inside, but looks like Connie Cooper on the outside.""

College football coach George Cooper (MacMurray) has led State U to a perfect record. But all losses and no wins makes dad a bit cranky! Natalie Wood is just terrific as his youngest daughter Ellen, a very smart tomboy handfull with a vocabulary well beyond her years. She calls her dad ""Coach,"" but his oldest barely calls him anything, as her self consciousness over her appearance and lack of interest from the male of the species has left her an emotional mess.

Her dad doesn't quite know what to do so, of course, does exactly the wrong thing in talking his neighbor Jim Backus into pretending to be an interested boy giving her a call. This naturally backfires and makes everything worse when Backus, her little sis Ellen and just about everyone else sends over a boy posing as the smitten college man!

Connie proceeds in melodramatic fashion to write a story for the rag, True Confessions, about a young girl whose seemingly ordinary life hides her secret identity as a bubble dancer! While causing her beleaguered dad some embarrassment, it may just get her the attention she needs, and her dad a lock on the best high school player in the country.

This is a warm family film with some nice touches and situations all parents can identify with. Thelma Ritter has some nice moments as the Cooper's maid,  always betting against Coach's team, and cleaning up! There is a little something for everyone here, with Natalie Wood a particular standout as the memorable Ellen. She received the child of the year award shortly after this film's release. A great pick for a family night with some popcorn and milk duds.",1113782400,24,2120,4.642666666666667

646768,5,6303450830,"This is a favorite of mine. I have the vhs version of this film. I am excited to see it on DVD. It is such a cute feel good movie. Fred macmurray plays a football coach for a losing college team. He is on the verge of being fired. On top of that he has a teenage daughter, Connie who is desperate for a boyfriend. It funny the muck of things become when there are 3 people pretending to be Joe birch. Natalie wood plays the little sister. So cute. I recommend to anyone who likes old classic movies.",1362960000,2,499,4.05050505050505

646770,4,6303450830,"A football coach (Fred MacMurray) at a small local college is in danger of losing his job because of the disastrous team losses. Meanwhile, on the home front he must deal with family issues including a teenage daughter (Betty Lynn, THE ANDY GRIFFITH SHOW) with an inferiority complex when it comes to the male sex. The title is a misnomer, the film isn't really about football at all. It's the kind of domestic comedy churned out with regularity by Hollywood until TV sitcoms like FATHER KNOWS BEST and LEAVE IT TO BEAVER took the genre over. As such, it's surprisingly amusing and well done. MacMurray is quite amiable in what looks like a run through for the countless Disney roles he would do in the 60s as well as his own TV sitcom, MY THREE SONS. Similarly, Maureen O'Hara (only 29 here but already playing the mother of a grown daughter) is doing the kind of age appropriate roles she would take on in the early 60s like THE PARENT TRAP and MR. HOBBS TAKES A VACATION. Directed by John M. Stahl (LEAVE HER TO HEAVEN). With Thelma Ritter as the requisite wisecracking family maid, Natalie Wood (adorable as the younger precocious daughter), Jim Backus, Rudy Vallee and Richard Tyler.

The Fox DVD from Spain is a very nice looking B&W transfer in its original 1.33 aspect ratio with both English language and Spanish language tracks with optional Spanish subtitles.",1335916800,4,1370,4.708333333333333
646771,5,6303450830,Fred MacMurray at his comedic best.  Maureen O'Hara plays his wife - but it is Fred's movie from start to finish.,1238976000,,113,4.380952380952381
646772,4,6303450830,"Here's another classic movie in which I enjoyed the corny expressions of the day. Usually I hear those most notably in the early 1930s films but there is lot of it here, too, many of them coming from little Natalie Wood.

Betty Lynn, playing older sister ""Connie"" to young ""Ellen"" (Wood), also is good in her kooky role. Fred MacMurray and Maureen O'Hara play the parents, ""George and Elizabeth Cooper."" This really isn't a football story, despite the title. It's a screwball family-type comedy, many of which I never cared for me, but this has good charm and humor. MacMurray is his normal likable self, as when he played in the early Disney films such as ""The Absent Minded Professor.""

Since MacMurray plays a football coach, there is some gridiron storyline in here, and it's unique because of the different-kind of ending regarding his team.

This movie has a neat twist at the end of it, too. Not well-known, with me being only the fourth reviewer here, this a fun family movie that isn't getting its due. Maybe if they put it out on DVD, more people would notice.",1234396800,6,1070,4.650793650793651
