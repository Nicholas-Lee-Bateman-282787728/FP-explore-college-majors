2759959,5,B000N6UHKO,The video  will be a great help for things to do in exercise class at an Assisted Living where the residents are mainly wheelchair bound.,1370822400,6,137,4.48
2759960,5,B000N6UHKO,"This is a great workout for anyone wishing to improve the strength of their core muscles. It's true that it is not a high impact workout, however it is wonderful for stretching and toning muscle groups that are sometimes missed in other workouts. If you are looking a routine that will improve your abs, back, hips and neck, I recomend this video.",1338422400,5,347,4.612903225806452
2759961,3,B000N6UHKO,"I am a beginning student of bellydance and own several videos.  I really wanted to like this video because I thought it was a great idea. However, for me, the audio quality and lack of variety in the belly dance moves did not justify the high price of the dvd.

There is no disc menu so that you can choose individual ""movements"" to focus on.  The sound had a muffled quality which was exacerbated by the overly loud, driving beat of the music.

While the instructor has a great smile and upbeat personality, I felt her cueing and how-to instructions were not clear.  There were very few verbal how-to instructions or descriptions for many of the movements - it was more ""watch me and follow"". Transitions  between movements were not announced so it was hard to follow.  .

Hip lift, tiptoe step-touch, tiptoe step-kick, tiptoe step-circle, arm wave, neck roll - there is so much more to belly dance than this.

If you want to smile, wave a scarf or cane and wiggle in your chair to loud Middle Eastern music, this dvd is for you. If you sincerely want to learn belly dance moves that are adapted to the chair, look else where.",1332028800,6,1127,4.485294117647059
2759962,5,B000N6UHKO,this is a great dvd for exercise that is different and fun.  It is a very graceful type of dance that is very benefical.,1286236800,,120,4.0
2759963,4,B000N6UHKO,"When I saw this video I said to myself, ""Yeah right! This workout is NOT going to be a quality workout!"" I couldn't have been more WRONG!! This is an excellent workout for anyone...not just for people who cannot stand or for people who may be disabled in some way (like myself).
I really love this DVD because it offers a great workout and it works all of your muscle groups. The only thing I wish it had more of is leg exercises. That is why I only gave it four stars.
I had no idea that you can do this from a chair. The instructor is super sweet and encouraging.
Some people may find the music to be a little loud and repetitive, but I had no problem with it. Also, some movements are a bit complex. I had done bellydance before I got sick and I understand how to do certain movements. The instructor doesn't really explain how to perform certain moves, but you sort of understand after some practice. :) Don't be discouraged! It is still a great workout even if you don't do the moves exactly right. Most of us are not professional bellydancers!
You need a scarf and a cane or some kind of long stick to do some exercises on this DVD. Although sometimes, I actually do it without the props and it works out just fine.
I honestly did not have high expectations for this video, but like I said earlier, I was really wrong.
This DVD is great for everyone, but especially for those who are limited in some way. It's really important to be active and to keep your body moving no matter who you are but some people find it more difficult. That doesn't mean that we can't try to be as healthy as we can.:)
I would recommend this video to anyone.

Thanks for reading. This is just my opinion. :)",1279929600,11,1691,4.251552795031056
2759964,3,B000N6UHKO,This product is fine if you can use your legs. There is an upper body part but it is short and a lot of leg work is included. Not good if you are in a wheelchair and paralyzed like me.,1257379200,15,184,3.625
2759965,5,B000N6UHKO,"I recently had knee surgery.  I am unable to tolerate much load bearing on my left leg until I have my partial knee replacement in May.  This is a challenging, quicker pace workout that is fun.  The only complaint that I would have is that there is no instructions on the dvd for needed props with video use: use of cane or broom pole, scarf that is longer and fluid.  I bought all the available titles for Chair Aerobics; there is a
Chair Aerobics club online with better price deals for buying more than 1 video.",1238544000,15,514,4.322916666666667
2759966,5,B000N6UHKO,"I purchased this DVD, along with several others in the Chair Aerobics for Everyone series, for my mother and me. At 87, my mom is no longer as active as she used to be, but put this DVD in and she is ready to go! This is a ""challenging-as-you-want-it-to-be"" workout that is fun and easy for all fitness levels.  Don't let the chair fool you. This is a great workout for those with limited space that really works the core and shoulders.  Just ask my mom.",1231632000,14,454,4.267441860465116
2759967,2,B000N6UHKO,I found this workout very light and a minimal workout. If you want to burn calories I would recommend Chair Boxing or Chair Salsa instead of this dvd.,1212451200,5,150,4.392857142857143
2759968,5,B000N6UHKO,"To me, all workout videos are a bit silly but I really enjoy this one. I have a broken foot and am limited in the types of exercise I can do. I wanted something fun to workout with and this is it!",1203984000,11,196,3.6904761904761907
8175443,5,B000N6UHKO,"I take a Beginners belly dance class every other week. This is great for me to practice and strengthen my core during the week at work. I didn't have a problem with the lack of leg work. In my belly dancing class, we are taught to practice the hip shimmy every chance that we get. I simply added the shimmy between moves and pauses. This is great! Thanks! Belly dancing has opened me up completely. I feel pretty and confident when dancing and the workout is amazing. This is an excellent filler between my classes and sitting idly at work.",1498780800,,540,4.41

8175446,3,B000N6UHKO,I got this for care center use.  The moves are too fast and some moves are not for people in wheelchairs.  This is better suited for a healthy person working at a desk not someone with limited mobility.,1476057600,,202,4.2894736842105265

8175448,1,B000N6UHKO,"I am a serious runner with a broken ankle and an almost knee-length cast. I have had to restructure my training regimen in accordance with my new limitations, so I turned to this series seeking some cardiovascular work that I could do at home. To say that this workout didn't cut it would be an understatement. This doesn't even deserve to be called a workout. It was bad enough that the warm up had me bored to tears, but I gave it a chance feeling sure that it would pick up some momentum after that part was over. Didn't happen. More than 10 minutes into the workout, I had done nothing other than transition at a snail's pace from one cutesy pose to another. Fed up, I actually paused my fitness tracker so that I could browse through the video to see if it was ever going to give my body some kind of challenge. Nope. Unwilling to cutesy poo for nearly 40 minutes with no training effect to show for it, I aborted this and did ""Chair Salsa"" (which I have also reviewed).

If you are recovering from spinal surgery, a coma, or quadriplegia, this workout might improve your conditioning. Or if you're a cadaver, it might get your heart pumping. For anything beyond that, this is worthless. Once I finished ""Salsa,"" the first thing I did after showering and lunching, was contact Amazon to get a refund for this. Honestly, it was that bad.",1436659200,,1341,4.451219512195122
8175449,4,B000N6UHKO,"Does not seem like I am exercising, but I get a very good workout in the chair. It makes me feel feminine and graceful all while working out. I love it.",1431043200,,152,3.935483870967742
8175450,3,B000N6UHKO,"Not the best in the series, the women is just not as energetic as the gentle in the other videos. This is mostly arms not much legs.  I've done belly dancing and this is so so. But it is fun and I really like the use of props, a scarf and a cane.",1414540800,3,246,3.641509433962264
8175451,2,B000N6UHKO,"Not what I expected for a belly dance video
, but at least useful for some cardio one in a while for variety.",1400198400,2,109,3.782608695652174
8175452,3,B000N6UHKO,OK.  But she does the same movements over and over and there is hardly any workout for your legs.  Other videos have more leg work.,1396137600,2,131,4.2
