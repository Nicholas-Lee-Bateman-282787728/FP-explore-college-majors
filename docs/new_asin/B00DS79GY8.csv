DVD Review ~*Veggie Tales Merry Larry and the True Light of Christmas*~, 2013
Giving a gift card for a new winter coat
Letting the True Light of Christmas shine through
Helping those who don't have it so good

Veggie Tales finds that not all that glitters is what is important at Spring Valley Mall. They are decorating the empty mall to get shoppers into the Christmas shopping with sparkling lights and music.

A learning experience and a good message. Helping others and hearing the True Christmas Story. As the Spring Valley Mall waits for the king of the mall to come and check out their decorations, he says they have got it with the focus on The King of Them All!

Christmas lights make things bright, but there's more than one way to shine at Christmas. Discuss how your family can give the love God gave to you. Larry sings a ""Not-so-Silly"" song, Wrapped Myself Up for Christmas. Think of ways to give yourself your time, your care, your talentsto others. As Acts 20:35 says, ""It is more blessed to give than to receive."" Can you find a way to help the community all year long?

Have the biggest and brightest Christmas ever! Free downloads, game and activities at veggietales.com/merrylarry ~ check either veggietales.com/occ or samaritanspurse.org/what-we-do/operation-christmas-child/ for your family to fill An Operation Christmas Child shoebox to be sent to a child in need. Jesus said in John 13:34, ""Love one another, just as I have loved you."" Those near and dear to you would love cookies or a homemade card. Remember service members in need of remembrance by those they serve. For a thoughtful mail-order gift, focusonthefamily.com/merrylarry sharing of Clubhouse Jr. magazine for 3 to 7-year-olds shows how to serve others, and has fun activities, educational puzzles, and creatively told Bible stories.

Two examples this True Light of Christmas brought to me is a sweet neighbor family bring their little children to our home to bring their homemade cookies and sing a Christmas song to us each year. That is a highlight of receiving their sharing at Christmas for us. One year, I told the older little boy there was something under the tree for them. He reached in and took one of his mommy's cookies where I had placed them under the tree by their presents we had for them. The other fond memory is one blustery winter on the East coast and my son wanted to shovel the walkway for an older woman across the street near us. She kept shooing him away ~ shouting she didn't have money to pay him. He came home twice in tears. I knocked on her door to tell her he wanted to do this for her and not for money. He happy was allowed to shovel her walk and came home with home-baked cookies she had made just for him. What a double-blessing gift to her to not fall on the ice, and to have a wonderful cookie smell in her little home.

May each of you be blessed each day of the year and enjoy your very own Veggie Tales Merry Larry and the True Light of Christmas, featuring Si Robertson from Duck Commander as ""Silas"" the Narrator.

5852363,5,B00DS79GY8,"What can I say about Veggie Tales?  They are all wonderful with a great message for little ones.  This one, narrated by Si, is especially good.  Si does an amazing job and my grandchildren love this Christmas theme.  I find myself watching it with them and enjoying it each time.  My grandchildren never tire of watching these.

Great job as usual.",1384473600,,348,4.622950819672131
5852364,5,B00DS79GY8,"The kids loved this Veggie Tales special.  We own quite a few Veggie Tale DVDS, and this one lives up to the quality and entertainment value of previous specials.  Highly recommend for anyone!",1384300800,5,192,4.787878787878788
5852365,5,B00DS79GY8,"When I saw this had Uncle Si on it we just had to order.  I'm not sorry, it's adorable!  Yes, I know it's only November but as soon as it came in we started watching it and all the kids love it.",1383523200,,194,3.5952380952380953
5852366,5,B00DS79GY8,"This is the best Christmas movie that Veggie Tales has made. It has such a good message about what Christmas is really about. It shows that we should be giving instead of wanting and that Rudolph, Santa Clause, the Christmas tree, Christmas lights, etc. are all nice things that add to the joy of Christmas but it is not what makes this season so joyous! Great must have if you have young kids.
I love that Si from Duck Dynasty is the narrator of this story, believe it or not he is an awesome narrator!",1383264000,8,503,4.3052631578947365
5852367,5,B00DS79GY8,My girls are super excited to watch another Christmas Veggie Tales movie. This is great and it is definitely on our must watch Christmas list ever year.,1383091200,,152,4.666666666666667
5852368,5,B00DS79GY8,"My older niece and nephew grew up on Veggie Tales so it has always had a special place in my heart. It's fun to relive it all over again with my own kids and Veggie Tales Merry Larry and the True Light of Christmas was the perfect DVD to share with them!

Even thought it's barely fall, everyone seems to be getting in the Christmas Spirit earlier each year, myself included! This DVD made me want it to be Christmas tomorrow!

I have seen many Veggie Tales DVD's over the past 20 years and I like how it has changed with the times. It's funny to see it taking place in a mall with all the modern features including cops on their scooters. The colors grow more vibrant and the stories appropriate for the times, even though the message is always the same.

It's hard for kids to remember the true meaning of Christmas with the focus being on Santa and getting gifts but Larry and friends helped to remind my kids what it really is about. And me too for that matter!

The bright colors, honest characters and special meaning of Veggie Tales Merry Larry and the True Light of Christmas make it the perfect family dvd to get your little ones in the true spirit of Christmas!",1382400000,14,1171,4.333333333333333

5852381,3,B00DS79GY8,"I love Christmas.  I have way too much Christmas music; and I collect Hallmark Christmas ornaments.  Still, there is such a thing as too much Christmas, and Merry Larry and the True Light of Christmas proves it.

Ironically enough, it's not the story I'm talking about (although the plot involves over decorating).  I'm actually referring to the fact that this is the latest in I don't know how many Christmas shows that VeggieTales has done.  While the message is still good, I feel like they've run out of Christmas shows to do.  After all, last year was the first in several we hadn't gotten a new Christmas story from them.  No body does Christmas shows every year.  These must be some of their better sellers to keep cranking them out.

This particular story revolves around a mall.  Every year, Larry and the French Peas play elves in the mall who record what all the kids want for Christmas.  It's a job that Larry takes very seriously.

However, the Spring Valley Mall has been losing sales, and in an attempt to increase shoppers, the mall has hired Bob the Tomato and Mr. Lunt to come in and decorate it.  They are going all out, and it is going to look spectacular.  But Larry hears part of a story from a little girl who is trying to help someone.  Will he be able to track her down and help?

Now don't misunderstand me - there is nothing wrong with this story by itself.  The reminder of the need to share God's love, a love He demonstrated at Christmas, is great.  We should always be reminded to share with others.

However, it just doesn't have that Christmas spark.  Honestly, I'd rather see this message is a regular story for the series.  And I'd rather see more regular stories for the show period.

Speaking of sparks, this one certainly doesn't have the warmth and humor of the earlier ones.  Since Phil Vischer took a less active role in the series, it hasn't been a good, and this is a perfect example.  Kids will still certainly enjoy it, but it doesn't have the same appeal to adults.

Even the silly song, ""Wrapped Myself Up for Christmas,"" isn't as funny as the premise promises.

Then there's Si Robertson's cameo as the narrator of the story.  I know this isn't the first time they've done stunt casting for voices in the series, but I'm not a fan of Duck Dynasty, so this one felt superfluous to me.

I realize I'm sounding very harsh, and this disc truly isn't that horrid.  The story is entertaining, and computer animation is good, and the voice talent is still great.  I certainly can't argue with the moral of the story.  I just really really wish they'd stop with the idea that they need to release a new Christmas story every fall.

So if you have kids who love VeggieTales, go ahead and get Merry Larry and the True Light of Christmas.  But adult fans like me won't need to rush out to add this to their collection.",1434067200,,2855,4.47093023255814

5852420,5,B00DS79GY8,"Another Christmas story?! Why not? There is always room for another way to celebrate the beginning of the Greatest Story Ever Told. My children and I enjoyed this VT as we have the many that have preceded it.  The characters continue to entertain.  And the narrator of the story just cracks us up.  After we watched the movie we learned that the voice was that of one of the Duck Dynasty family members. Duck Dynasty is not something with which we are familiar, but the voicing was entertaining all the same.  I think what I like most about many of the VT, this one included, is the overall innocence that comes across, usually through Larry's character.  The simplicity of the message, and the example of Merry Larry, is that love just doesn't have to be hard or complicated or overly orchestrated.  It's just something you do!",1393200000,3,828,4.636986301369863

This is a movie that lets us human's know how we can get all ""wrapped"" up into the commercial side of Christmas when that has nothing to do with the TRUE meaning of Christmas.
