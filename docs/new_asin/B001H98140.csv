8308163,5,B001H98140,This is a powerful documentary on James Fraser. It really emphasizes the power of prayer and the need for it in our Christian walks for missionaries. Probably the best documentary I have found on a missionary. You are not getting a blockbuster movie but more like a history channel documentary. I was greatly encouraged by it.,1312502400,3,326,4.839285714285714

""What a story!  I love books and read like a mad man.  But something about putting James O. Fraser's story on film and relating it in audio-visual form makes it amazingly powerful - more impactful (to me, at least) than print. I was encouraged to see/hear that he, like all of us, experienced difficult times, questioned his call, wondered at the lack of fruit....

"". . . A pastor was so struck by the film that he mandated it to be viewed at his regular church staff meeting - a very unusual thing for him to do as senior pastor. So over 20 staff members from a major UK church watched the film."" - N
