8442560,4,B004V2FUE4,"Jaal is a decent action movie (maybe not the best but alright, or average), although a lot more action would have really been better. Sunny Deol rocks in action, and he does not even roar in this movie. This movie has a major twist, and the thrills that follow and end with a brilliant train climax save the film. I love seeing Sunny terminating the terrorists as a true patriot. Basically, this is a good 2nd half action movie, as the action comes late. There are a couple of big surprises in this movie (Watch this film with an open mind, and you will come to know the real story here). Anyways, this is a good time pass. Enjoy!
