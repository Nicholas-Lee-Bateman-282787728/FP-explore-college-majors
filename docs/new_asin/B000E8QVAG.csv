2510076,5,B000E8QVAG,"If you have any interest in Bernard Shaw this is a must package.

The plays presented here are well acted and directed. As a collection they present a wonderful overview of Shaw's developement as a playwright and thinker. Although not a bomb in hand revolutionary Shaws was presenter of words and ideas. Thesew presenments help to make him the father of the modern English drama. These plays are little gems filled with wit, insight and hold up quit well on this age of shock for shock sake.",1153440000,16,491,4.64367816091954
2510077,5,B000E8QVAG,"With the 150th anniversary of George Bernard Shaw's birth fast approaching (July 26), BBC Warner celebrates the Irish playwright by collecting together ten of his most famous and representative plays, produced by the BBC during the 1970's and 80's with some of the finest British actors of the age, and making them available on six DVDs which also feature documentaries on his life and works.  With a total run time of over 11 hours, this collection also represents an excellent bargain at $7 per disc or approximately $3.76 per hour.  Where else can you find entertainment at this level of writing, acting, directing, and producing for even twice the price?

The only caveat may be the lack of a live theatre audience.  I'm assuming most people watching these DVDs are alive, but will probably not watch them in a theatre with others.  The absence of this live theatre audience, especially one schooled in the particular genres popular to theatregoers of Shaw's time, may prove somewhat alienating for some, especially as the dialogue and plot recall a more literary era with social conventions that are no longer conventional.  We still produce Shaw, however, because his irony, wit and verbal agility were never ends unto themselves, even if they sweetened his less-palatable moral truths.  Shaw the playwright was never far removed from Shaw the polemicist, and we would honor him best on this anniversary by remembering this.",1148860800,116,1430,5.059574468085106

2510079,5,B000E8QVAG,"I must confess I have as yet watched only three of the six discs.  These are superior productions, well cast, well designed and well directed.  The picture and sound quality reflect the time; there are moments when characters walk to the rear of the stage and the microphone doesn't follow them.  The sublime production of Arms and the Man alone makes this money well spent.",1425772800,,374,4.723076923076923
2510080,5,B000E8QVAG,Loved it.,1423785600,,9,4.0
2510081,5,B000E8QVAG,Good to have a decent selection of Shaw plays with a consistently good cast and production values.,1423094400,,98,4.823529411764706
2510082,4,B000E8QVAG,"Watched Pygmalion, so far.  Boy did they use most of Shaw's dialogue in making My Fair Lady.  Interesting story but dated in terms of male-female relationships.",1420329600,,160,5.115384615384615
2510083,4,B000E8QVAG,"Arms and the Man, The Millionairess, and Devil's Disciple are excellent. The others are of mixed quality.",1420243200,,105,5.235294117647059
2510084,1,B000E8QVAG,"I have mixed feelings about this set: on the one hand it's delightful entertainment, on the other hand I just discovered something very annoying.  I wanted to check the length of one of the supplemental plays (specifically the length of Man of Destiny on Arms and the Man).  It wouldn't let me because of some lame-brained copy protection scheme.
As far as I'm concerned copy protection is just a way to annoy honest customers while slowing down hackers for perhaps 15 seconds.  I'm sure that if I were cleverer I could download the right software to enable me to play it (I've got a Lenovo Thinkpad with a Samsung DVD reader, nothing at all exotic.  Since the hackers are going to crack it anyway, why bother?
Copy protection is so 20th century, esp. the belief that it will protect anything.
Since I've enjoyed this set on my TV, I'd rate the artistic merit about 4.7.  I'd also give it about 0 for stupidity.  So 1* is a reasonable average.",1417737600,2,943,4.550295857988166
2510085,5,B000E8QVAG,"And check out ""The Devil's Disciple,"" which is a bonus play. This set has some of the very finest Shaw plays ever taped!",1415836800,,120,4.260869565217392
2510086,5,B000E8QVAG,"I find that I had greatly underestimated Shaw, Stunned by Ibsen, and enchanted by Chekhov, I ranked Shaw somewhere with Oscar Wilde as an entertaining dramatist. However, the Shaw collection revealed to me another achievement, and I realised that he was a worthy contemporary of Marx and Engels on the level of their social criticism, with no disrespect to Oscar Wilde, who had other dimensions.
These plays are great theatre, Living in a country where the European tradition of theatre is unknown, it has been a wondrous opportunity to view these classics of a great tradition. But it is the iconoclasm of Shaw's vision that I appreciate most. The society in which I live is even more rigidly structured than that known to Shaw. To even hint a criticism of society in which he revels would land me in prison for the rest of my life! Shaw is relevant today as he was when he wrote these magnificent plays",1410652800,7,904,4.6918238993710695
2510087,1,B000E8QVAG,"British productions are usually better than this.  I bought this set because it had The Devil's Disciple, which I had seen on t.v. and wanted for my library.  I couldn't watch this version and tried watching another movie in the set but couldn't watch it.  I would not purchase again.",1409011200,,284,4.64
2510088,5,B000E8QVAG,"""The Devil's Disciple"" alone here, starring Patrick Stewart, Ian Richardson, Elizabeth Spriggs and Michael Gwilym, is worth the whole set. But you get Dame Maggie Smith in her gorgeous youth, along with Tom Baker and Charles Gray: A rarely done gem. Heartbreak House stars Sir John Gielgud as the eccentric Captain Shotover, a true delight. There are 10 productions in all, and this set is a bargain for Shaw fans.",1396915200,7,414,4.928571428571429
2510089,3,B000E8QVAG,Now we don't get to see Shaw on stage anymore these are valuable reminders of whyhe is the second most highly regarded playwright in English. Fine actors give fine performances but theatre only really works in the theatre. And at least some idiot hasn't attempted to reset them in outer space or Nazi Germany. They are performed in their original Victorian England context.,1393545600,4,373,4.936507936507937
2510090,4,B000E8QVAG,"This collection is a valuable record of a time when the BBC actually committed themselves to classic dramas without resorting to the usual heritage film cliches of stately homes, carriages pulling away from the front driveways, grimy streets and lots of extras in the background.  Rather they concentrated on producing revivals of classic dramas that were character-focused, with functional sets and costumes, with close-ups and two-shots used as the basic narrative devices.  Shot on videotape, these productions demand a considerable degree of concentration - they might seem boring and slow-moving to viewers accustomed to more fast-paced kinds of production - but they present Shaw's dramas in plain, straightforward fashion.  THE SHAW COLLECTION provides valuable evidence of the BBC's commitment to public service broadcasting - designed to educate and inform as well as entertain - which seems to have got lost over the years as the Corporation have gone (often fruitlessly) in search of high ratings.",1384819200,3,1008,5.490322580645161
2510091,5,B000E8QVAG,"This set of videos containing G.B. Shaw's plays was in very good condition.  I received this item quickly.  There were some additional videos included.

The only regret I have that the famous play  ""The Importance of Being Earnest"" was not included.",1376956800,,249,5.0
2510092,5,B000E8QVAG,"Best presentation of Shaw's great plays I have ever seen!  Most highly recommended.  Good actors, excellent interpretation of the plays, very entertaining.  Highly recommended.",1372118400,2,176,6.25
2510093,4,B000E8QVAG,"If you like Shaw, you will definitley enjoy this collection of fine actors portraying his lesser known plays as well as a few popular ones.  This is old but worth your while.",1357257600,2,174,4.4375
2510094,3,B000E8QVAG,Brand new as stated and received very quickly.  Have not watched all of them but the one's I did the quality was not very good.,1356220800,,127,4.08
2510095,4,B000E8QVAG,"This is a good collection of plays by George Bernard Shaw, including Pygmalion, Arms and the Man, and Heartbreak House. But one important G.B.S. play is missing from this collection. How can you have a collection of plays by Shaw and not include Major Barbara!!!!!?????",1292976000,5,269,5.0
2510096,5,B000E8QVAG,THese are BBC productions from the 1970's and 1980's. They are follow the scripts of the original plays to the letter.  The acting is first rate.  They use a theatrical form with the action taking place on one set for each act.  as a big fan of GBS these are a wonderful addition to my library. They are bargain priced to boot. My only regret is that more GBS is not available.,1291507200,12,377,4.208333333333333
2510097,4,B000E8QVAG,"I've just watched this whole set, and really (REALLY) enjoyed some of these, and could have done without others. Some of these are gems - Maggie Smith really chews up the scenery in ""The Millionaress"" and Penelope Wilton is great in ""Mrs. Warren's Profession."" Lyn Redgrave is charming as Eliza Doolittle, Simon Callow is riveting in ""A Man of Destiny"" and the dramatization of ""The Portrait of Dorian Gray"" is powerfully homoerotic, considering it was done in 1976! I also found Helena Bonham Carter fascinating in ""Arms and the Man"" and was interested to see ""The Devils' Disciple,"" a play I'd never heard of, set in colonial New Hampshire.

There are a couple stinkers, ""Heartbreak House,"" in particular. Instead of dialog, we get a two-hour series of pronouncements. Shaw is showing off, and so are the actors - it's like going back in time to the Old Vic, what with the rolled r's and clunky ""outdoor"" scenery. The same can be said for ""The Apple Cart."" Yuck. Androcles and the Lion is also pretty painful.

These are all evocative of those old Masterpiece Theaters, and it's fun to identify actors you've seen in other shows and movies. There's never been a shortage of really brilliant talent in England. Too bad the production values are so iffy; film for outdoors shots, videotape for inside shots - so bad that when they light a match the camera doesn't know what to do - like an old kinescope. But if you can overlook the thump-thump of wood whenever people are walking on ""stone"" or ""grass"" and focus on the wonderful lines and nuanced performances, you'll really enjoy this set!<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Shaw-Collection-Pygmalion-The-Millionairess-Arms-and-the-Man-The-Devil-s-Disciple-Mrs-Warren-s-Profession-Heartbreak-House/dp/B000E8QVAG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Shaw Collection (Pygmalion / The Millionairess / Arms and the Man / The Devil's Disciple / Mrs. Warren's Profession / Heartbreak House)</a>",1290988800,26,1972,5.548172757475083
2510098,5,B000E8QVAG,"I suppose some reviewers have a specific sense of how a play, or a Bernard Shaw play, should be presented.  But if you wish to compare these plays, not just with theatrical presentations, but with quality entertainment in general, there can be no better way to spend your time and money. Myself, I don't bother with TV, and I manage to like about one current movie per year. I have a broad appreciation of quality movies; I deeply appreciate Aeschylus, Shakespeare, Milton, Keats, Robert Smith, etc.; and I have found nothing more delightful than these presentations of Arms and the Man, The Millionairess, The Devil's Disciple, Pygmalion, and You Never Can Tell - quite enough to rate the whole collection a five-star must-have, for anyone but perhaps those with the most specialized theatrical interest.",1263772800,9,805,5.007462686567164
2510099,2,B000E8QVAG,"These appear to be made-for-telly movies from the 1970s. The results are mixed. I found ""The Devil's Disciple"" to be the best of the lot, thanks to a lively pace and good casting. ""Heartbreak House,"" at the other extreme, is nearly incomprehensible. Lynn Redgrave's Eliza Doolittle is a pleasant surprise. The rest are pretty dull.",1261872000,8,331,5.036363636363636
2510100,5,B000E8QVAG,"These are movies with multiple camera angles and lush sets.  The people speak with ordinary voices, not like those in a stage production.

There are twelve separate programs on the six DVDs.  I am giving the five star because two of them are first rate, Pygmalion and The Millionairess.  They stand the test of time unlike many other of his plays that satirize situations of 100+ years ago and no longer exist today.  The others are from so-so to terrible.  Shaw gets poorer as his story goes back in time and to other countries.",1222473600,8,529,4.574468085106383
2510101,4,B000E8QVAG,"I love Shaw's plays, but with a few exceptions they don't translate well to the screen.  If you're interested in Shaw's ideas and the plays themselves, then you will be quite pleased.  If you are looking for a greater sense of place and reality, as most people do with today's movies, you might feel something lacking.",1219622400,11,318,4.660714285714286

This collection offers a simply great Devil's Disciple and Arms and the Man plus a Heartbreak House to die for.  Mrs. Warren's Profession is good, and I have not yet seen The Millionairess or Pygmalion, but I imagine that they, too, are quite up to snuff.  If you love Shaw, this is a must for your library.
