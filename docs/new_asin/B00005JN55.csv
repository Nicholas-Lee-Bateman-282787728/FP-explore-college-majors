When we received it, we checked the back before opening, and it stated that the download code may not be valid after 12/30/16.  Having already experienced this with a previous movie we purchased last year, I arranged to exchange it for another copy, hoping that a new one would have a valid download code.  We just received the replacement a couple of days ago and this one too has an expired digital code.  We have tried to find a way to contact Amazon directly so we can try to resolve the issue but have been unable to find anyway to do so.

1597650,4,B00005JN55,"This movie is as ridiculous as you would likely imagine if you've seen Spongebob. If you're a Spongebob Sqarepants fan, you'll probably be quoting this and singing the songs for weeks (or years) after viewing. As silly as it is, it's pretty fun to watch with the family. Our boys are 17 and 15 and we watched a lot of Spongebob back in the day (it was actually pretty funny and had some great jokes in the earlier seasons.) Our 15 year old asked for it for Christmas but it's been hard to find locally. This was at a great price and free shipping.

If you're not a Spongebob Squarepants fan or you're not buying it for a Spongebob Squarepants fan, I'm not even sure why you're considering it and you should probably move along.",1481846400,3,727,4.385185185185185

1597802,5,B00005JN55,My daughters and I have loved this movie since the day we saw it in the theaters. In my opinion it was the hightlight of the TV show.

  i think the the movie should have been rated PG for RUDE HUMOR AND MILD LANGUAGE instead of mild crude humor

MILD LANGUAGE- 1 use of damn but it is used as damning there is also 1 use of freaking but it is usedin a song jackass is also used briefly

CRUDE HUMOR-there are two scenes where animated buttocks are seen
  patrick tells a mermaid that she is "" hot ""  striptease music is heard briefly patrick is seen urinating
  uses of butt  two characters get drunk on icecream",1460937600,,579,4.229357798165138

You know kids and repetition... they will literally watch the same cartoon a million times and not get sick of it, but usually I am ready to rip my hair out after hearing the same episode of something for the 20th time.  However, I have to say that this movie is really cute, and has pretty decent entertainment value even for adults without being over-the-top innappropriate like a lot of movies/cartoons that try to appeal to both kids and parents.  I know my daughter will get a lot of enjoyment out of this movie, and I will have some guaranteed and much needed ""mommy time"" once on a while!  :-)",1407456000,6,792,4.331081081081081

1598774,5,B00005JN55,"It's not every day that a great television show is made even better by a movie adaptation.  This is a rare exception.  After all, you first need a television show that was already great on its own.  Spongebob Squarepants accomplished that as it invited us to witness the trials and triumphs of the citizens of bikini bottom (how'd anyone come up with that name?), mainly a little, square, yellow dude named Spongebob Squarepants.  Then, once the show was great and staying great, this movie adaptation came along.  And for me...my expectations were knocked right out of the park.  A show known for its individual episodes of approximately eleven minutes in length went above and beyond in succeeding to bring us a full-blown, big-screen adventure that retained everything we know and love about the series.  After King Neptune, the ruler of the undersea world or something like that, loses his crown to a mysterious thief and is led by some evidence to blame and condemn Mr. Krabs, Spongebob's boss at the fast-food restaurant ""The Krusty Krab"", our hero and his friend, a starfish named Patrick, set out prove the money-hungry Mr. Krabs' innocence by traveling to Shell City, where the crown is now located.  Along the way, they must deal with thugs, strange and dangerous undersea creatures, and hired hit man sent to prevent them from accomplishing their goal.  It's all that, plus the appearance of some life-action pirates/fans and a few other cameos, that give us as much, if not more, excitement that Spongebob Squarepants has provided for many years...actually, this movie saved the show from being canceled and rightly so.  The one, and I really mean ""one"", downside is that Sandy, the squirrel who has relocated from her home state of Texas to an undersea dome, is noticeably absent.  Oh well...at least she'll be in the sequel.  My only hope is that this sequel, due in theaters in 2015 if I'm not mistaken, is as good as this film, even if that's a tall order.  The filmmakers only have themselves to blame for that as they set the bar so high with their efforts in the first Spongebob film.  Enjoy.",1403049600,5,2111,4.811634349030471

1599025,5,B00005JN55,"I'll admit it, I'm a SpongeBob fan. This is one of the craziest creatures ever to come out of the deep blue sea. Here however, is a fairly coherent story. SpongeBob and Squidward are both up for a promotion to be the new manager for the Krusty Krabb 2, a brand new restaurant their boss has built.. SpongeBob is devastated, however when he doesn't get the job, even though he feels that he is rightfully due because of his work record, all because his boss thinks he's a kid. So he and Patrick end up tying one on at the Goofy Goober Ice cream Palace in order to drown his sorrows. In the meantime, Plankton, their evil little competitor, has come up with his very last plan to get the Krabby Patty formula, and steals Neptune's crown. The next morning, SpongeBob arrives hung over to work, to discover his boss, Mister Krabb, begging for his life before an enraged King Neptune who is threatening to fry him on the spot if his crown is not returned. SpongeBob gallantly offers to get the crown back in return for his boss' life. Neptune reluctantly agrees after his daughter Mindy convinces him and he and Patrick set off. Plankton, at last, finds himself free, takes the formula and begins his next step in enslaving all Bikini Bottom to his will and sends a cruel assassin named Dennis after SpongeBob and Patrick. On the way, they meet thugs and monsters and meet up with Dennis, who is crushed underfoot by the Monster guardian Cyclops who takes Pat and SpongeBob back to Shell City, his lair, in order to kill and make knickknacks out of them. They escape and when they lose the bags of winds that Mindy gave them to get home, they are rescued by an unlikely man, David Hasselhof, who swims with them back to Bikini Bottom. On the way, though, they are once again accosted by Dennis, who wasn't as dead as they thought and they finally win their fight with him and return the crown--only to find their problems were not over, for now, they have to defeat Plankton, who has enslaved all of Bikini Bottom, along with King Neptune and rescue their friends from his devilish plot.

The movie was funny at times and we had some laughs, but I can't give it a positive review because there was some really weird stuff in it. For instance, they have a scene where Patrick (the cartoon starfish character) is butt naked, with a flag squeezed in between his butt cheeks. They had a long close up of this and it was just really weird and not appropriate for kids. They had a scene where Patrick said he WORSHIPS the goofy goober man by wearing special underwear. I get that they are trying to be funny but it disturbed me and my wife just a little bit with these subtle occult jokes. Do children understand what worship is? Does this teach them to worship people instead of God? There were other various scenes that were a little off, such as when Patrick tells the mermaid woman that she is hot and asks her if she wants to see him takes his pants off to show her his underwear. I'm not saying this movie is terrible, it was funny at times and we did laugh, but we personally felt uncomfortable (from a Christian standpoint) with some the scenes in the movie.",1377820800,2,1148,4.369158878504673

I have watched it with him and I think it is funny. It does have some mild rude humor, but I don't consider it to be anything serious, If your child already watch spongebob then it is nothing too far from what is played on tv programs.

Sponge Bob sets off on an epic journey with his mildly retarded friend Patrick to retrieve King Neptune's bald-spot-covering crown from Shell City. His motivation also comes from the fact that his perpetual curmudgeon boss, Mr. Crabs, is frozen and wrongfully accused of stealing the crown.

1599403,4,B00005JN55,"***This review may contain spoilers.***

  Gosh darn it, what is it about this nutty, off-the-wall, maritime cartoon phenomenon that makes it so enduringly popular?  I mean, it's full of nasty, selfish, greedy, dull-witted and hostile characters.  It has gruesome close-ups and numerous continuity errors.  It's hyperactive and unfocused.  I think I have the answer - it's SpongeBob SquarePants himself.  Duh, you say?  Well, think about it!  Even though he's a hypersensitive, annoying, meddling, gullible. nave guy, he's also a kid -  nice, friendly, good-hearted, hard-working, resourceful kid who faces his often callous, uncaring environment with never-say-die optimism - an inspiration to all us rat racers and 9-to-5ers.

  ""The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie"" (hereafter SSM) recognizes this childish goodness, and puts it to a ""mythological"" test.  SpongeBob is unfairly passed over for a restaurant management position by his crapulous boss Mr. Krabs in favor of the antisocial, apathetic, but ""mature"" Squidward.  Along with his nearly mindless starfish companion Patrick, he messily buries his depression in endless Goofy Goober sundaes.  Worse, King Neptune freezes Mr. Krabs because the microscopic but devious Plankton (the true thief) frames him for the theft of his baldness-hiding crown.  With the king distracted, Plankton along with his computerized ""wife"" Karen enslaves all of Bikini Bottom with mind-control helmets.  Despite his despair, SpongeBob's loyalty to Mr. Krabs and the community triumph and he, along with Patrick, agree to retrieve the crown, which is ensconced in the unknown land of ""Shell City"".  Can these Goofy Goober kids do it?

  With sly cleverness, SSM incorporates all the elements of its production into a sort of Greek mythological tale along the lines of ""Jason and the Golden Fleece"" and more saliently, ""The Odyssey"".  SpongeBob and Patrick, like Odysseus, must encounter many dangers, obstacles, and monsters before getting the crown back.  The only difference is, besides ""conventional sea monsters"", they must resist an angler fish with a ""grandma"" lure, hillbilly roadstop diners, and the persistent, vicious Dennis, Plankton's henchman sent to thwart the duo.  Our duo does despair and cry, and are on the verge of giving up.  King Neptune's sympathetic mermaid daughter Mindy gives them fake seaweed mustaches to boost their manhood.  The duo perseveres, but is captured by a ""Cyclops"" (a person in a seadiving, weighted suit), and imprisoned in Shell City (a beach souvenir shop) for dissection.  The crown is there, but can the dessicated SpongeBob and Patrick free themselves, get the crown, avoid Dennis, get back home, and save Bikini Bottom from the ruthless Plankton?  Tears, souvenirs brought to life, and Mr. Hunky Baywatch himself David Hasselhoff may play a part.

  As I said in the title, SSM is a nice guy's rite of passage.  However, even though he ultimately proves his, er, manliness (spongeworthiness), the most reassuring thing about the movie is that SpongeBob will never lose his most vital asset, his Pollyanna child's heart (or whatever a sponge has for a heart).  Still, he'll have that managerial position, thank you!",1342742400,,3196,5.413793103448276

The original SpongeBob Movie can now be seen in full HD, (and in Digital HD) including its hysterical Teaser commercial, on Blu-ray disc. This is a combo pack since you can see the Blu-ray disc at home and the DVD wherever you want, and Digital HD for mobile devices, too. The ""Blu"" disc has some bonuses not seen on VHS OR DVD. There's a second SpongeBob Movie now out, and it's only fitting that this movie's a Blu-ray combo pack in 2015, and a 3D combo pack. The first one was meant to conclude the whole shebang, but SpongeBob's universal appeal & popularity extended the show to at least 9 seasons & 2 theatrical movies; it's THAT good. Sponge Out of Water is a prequel to this movie, just to let everyone know. Since the Blu-ray disc is in HD, you should still keep an eye out for a picture of Popeye the Sailor inside The Krusty Krab 2 somewhere in the movie! His own theatrical shorts used to be made by Paramount at one time, now owned by the WB & in the Public Domain. SpongeBob has become the first Nicktoon in history to be released on Blu-ray disc, even if the movie, or the next one, isn't in the show's production order. Who knows if Nick will decide to release the series on Blu-ray disc? No other Nick TV show, animated or otherwise, has ever gone that far, besides the airbending spin-off, The Legend of Korra. Enjoy this newly-reissued (and revised for a Digital HD code) combo pack, since this movie isn't part of the First 100 Episodes DVD set.",1336521600,,1522,4.400709219858156

1599476,5,B00005JN55,"The Spongebob Squarepants Movie staring Spongebob Squarepants and Patrick Star is an exciting and thrilling animation loaded with action and adventure. This movie shows many different personalities of our favorite yellow sea sponge. He changes from a goofy goober and a knucklehead McSpazatron, to a heroic manly man with the fate of bikini bottom in his small, yellow hands. This movie is action packed and includes an amazing soundtrack and is a must see for the whole family.
 We begin with the second most important day of Spongebob's life, the grand opening of the Krusty Krab 2. Spongebob and his fellow companion Patrick Star, who is a big, pink starfish that is a little on the not smart side, are already celebrating by singing the best song ever, the theme song to their favorite ice cream parlor Goofy Goobers, because they already believe Spongebob will become the manager of the Krusty Krab 2. Unfortunately Spongebob's boss, Mr. Krabs, gives the job to Spongebob's neighbor and coworker, Squidward Tentacles because he believes Spongebob is just a kid. Spongebob really wanted that job so now he must find a way to prove the Mr. Krabs that he is not a kid and he deserves to be manager.
 Only one person isn't happy with the opening of the Krusty Krab 2, Plankton. Plankton who is the owner of the failed restaurant the Chum Bucket, which is across the street from the Krusty Krab, has made many failed attempts at stealing Mr. Krabs's formula for his delicious sandwich, the Krabby Patty. He only has one more devious plan to steal the formula, Plan Z. Plan Z involves stealing King Neptune's crown then framing Mr. Krabs. After stealing the crown Plankton sends it to Shell City, a place where no fish has returned from. Things are looking good for Plankton. Mr. Krabs is to be executed, thus allowing Plankton to steal the formula but one thing stands in his way. Spongebob and Patrick have six days to go to Shell City, get the crown, and save the town and Mr. Krabs.
 On their quest to save Mr. Krabs and prove that they are men, Spongebob and Patrick encounter many difficulties. First they must get past a deep, dark, deadly, and dangerous trench filled with terrifying monsters. Then they face a killer assassin hired by Plankton to squash them like bugs. But he is not the worst of their troubles. Finally as the reach Shell City they are confronted by a gigantic Cyclops and find them selves in a life threatening situation.
 The Spongebob Squarepants movie may be the most action packed animated movie ever. It includes many battles with ferocious monsters, deadly assassins, evil dictators, and a monstrous Cyclops. This movie also includes unlicensed children driving a sandwich. Also, Any movie with David Hasselhoff must be terrific. Another great thing about this movie is the soundtrack. It all begins with a great performance of the Spongebob theme song by a ship of pirates. A climax in the movie is when Spongebob and Patrick sing a song about becoming men as they get past the trench. The movie ends with a wonderful performance of the Goofy Goober Rock song which Spongebob sings and plays guitar for. Overall, the Spongebob Squarepants Movie is the best animated film of all time so you must go see it now.",1319414400,2,3243,4.785714285714286

Then, it turns out that Spongebob and his hapless and clueless best friend Patrick are the only ones who can save Bikini Bottom from disaster, and prove their manliness (and musical chops) along the way.

The Spongebob Squarepants television show is hit or miss.  Sometimes it's insane funny, and other times feels more like generic silliness.  When it's on, though, it's on, and there's nothing more clever or funny in daytime cartoon television.  Here, in its first and only big screen version, it runs on all four cylinders, hitting just the right mix of surreal and silly.  My son just put it on last night and I saw it with him for the umpteenth time since we saw it in the theaters, and, as always, it was funny as ever.  You could say that this film ""gets"" that what's funniest about Spongebob is the way it depicts the world of adulthood as it might appear to children - and Spongebob at least manages to fall into both camps - he doesn't live at home, and manages to hold down a steady job as a highly skilled and somewhat professional fry cook, and yet his best friend is at best infantile, and he himself does not act like a grownup. Highly recommended for lovers of the television series, but even if you've never seen the show it's very funny, absurd and over the top silly, and much more clever than most of the more mainstream blockbuster animation flicks.",1280620800,3,1748,4.559105431309904

1599644,4,B00005JN55,"Ask almost any kid (or more than a few college students) who lives in a pineapple under the sea, and the answer will be the same--SpongeBob Squarepants, the titular hero of this wild adventure through the ocean depths. Facing the dangers of Plankton, King Neptune, bikers, hitmen, cyclops, and Hasselhoff, Spongebob and his BFF Patrick must tread all these dangers to save the future of Bikini Bottom and the Krusty Krab.

The film's brightest moments are its most bizarre, like Patrick and Spongebob's bubble dance in a tough guy bar bathroom, the duo's musical montage through a dark ravine filled with all sorts hideous monsters, and their faceoff against a hitman onboard the SS Hasselhoff. At times the gags are fast and furious, but at times one is left feeling that they were stretching a few scenes out to justify the cost of making them.

The animation and art throughout the film are greatly improved while still maintaining the style and feel from the television series, a difficult feat to achieve. The new backgrounds and character designs are gorgeous, and if there was 3d done on the project, it didn't show.

The new characters are memorable, but their line reads don't have the same magic that the regular cast has. Neptune's daughter, voiced by Scarlett Johansson, feels flat and doesn't seem to really interact with the primary cast until the film nears its end. However, these new characters come at a cost. As is often the case with animated films, the secondary characters are largely MIA throughout the film. Fans of Mr. Krabs, Sandy Cheeks, or even Squidward will largely be disappointed.

The ending descends into the depths of the bizarre. What started as a beautiful buddy adventure pic falls into the utterly outlandish, including the obligatory Spongebob rock sequence and more than a few disturbing (but G-rated) up close shots of David Hasselhoff. The theme of the film, that kids are important, is repeated more and more as the film nears its end. While a bit over the top, it's a positive message for kids and helps to move the plot forward.

The video on the DVD, presented in the original widescreen format, is clean and the sound is acceptable. There are a few featurettes on the disc, but nothing that spectacular or memorable. While fans might pine for a more full-featured special edition, the disc has comparable special features as though available on the TV series discs.

Despite the film's shortcomings, it was still a fast and enjoyable 90 minute ride. Fans of the series will love it, and those with children will find the film surprisingly enjoyable. It stands admirably well as a companion to the original two or three seasons of the series.",1199232000,2,2689,4.87308533916849

It s a film knowing that the people seeing it are stoners and people not looking for the next Disney celebrity voiced Oscar fest but a film to space out at and simple enjoy.

1599749,4,B00005JN55,"With these days, the younger audiences all ove the cartoons that Nickelodeon has brought ou to the world. Although cartoons like Jimmy Neutron and Rugrats have all been brought into the movie theaters as well, the distinction of most animated film is that they really don't don't all the time deliver. For Spongebob Squarepants, he has truly been one of the actual few who has not only delivered under the guise of animation, but as a icon that both kids and adults could watch together and just laugh to their hearts content. But, with a full-length film out, can Spongebob really deliver out the laughs.

The Spongebob Squarepants Movie, is a humorous movie that is appealing to Spongebob fans of all kinds. The story reflects on Mr. Krabs opening up another Krusty Krab restaurant, where he names Squidward as the new manager, to Spongebob's dissapointment, and rejection because he is told that he is too much of a kid. With that time, Plankton, Mr. Krabs rival, conducts his plan Z, and steals a sacred crown from King Neptune. With tht chaos, Spongebob and his friend Patrick head down to Shell City to reclaim the crown and bring it back to the king and his daughter, Mindy. The movie is funny an side-spliting for most, but there is one big disadvantage with the film, it is too short. I just wish that there just could've been more added on to the plot. The movie was delightful though, as much as I enjoyed it by recently watching it when it debuted on the Nickelodeon channel last night.

All in all, if you're a die hard Spngebob fan, you'll definitely want to enjoy this hilarious film, but for others who don't have cable, they'll just consider this as a rental. The Spongebob Squarepants Movie is a great delight for all.

The movie was pretty funny, my kids sure enjoyed it more than me. Dennis(the one Plankton hired to take out Spongebob and Patrick) was by far my favorite character. Tough and ruthless, he added a good counterpart to the craziness that is Spongebob and Patrick. Sort of reminiscent of the Tattletale Strangler ony edgier.

The underwater world of SpongeBob is lovingly created with wit, charm, sass, and not just a little societal tongue-in-cheek.  SpongeBob himself is a remarkably engaging little fellow, at once credulous and simple and immature, yet pure and innocent and impossible not to adore, once the action gets going and you see the goodness in his spongey little heart.  Likewise for Patrick, the lobotomized starfish.

Plankton steals the show, however, as the maniacal microbe with visions of ocean-wide domination.  Displaying perhaps animation's worst case of Short Man Syndrome, Plankton had me laughing out loud at several points in the film, and my hat is off to the voice actor who brought Plankton to life.  Not since Mike Meyers' Doctor Evil have I found myself enjoying a villain this much.  All hail Plankton!

Those seeking a super-complex plot, are liable to be disappointed.  But plot isn't the point.  As I would learn when I eventually began watching the series on television, the movie is simply the universe of SpongeBob writ large, bigger and bolder, with a better soundtrack, and (of course) David Hasselhoff!

Kudos to Hasselhoff for proving that he's not afraid to laugh at himself.  And kudos to veteran screen actor Jeffrey Tambor for voicing King Neptune. (""Ballld!  Balllld!!!"")  In fact, a number of familiar faces and voice inhabit this show, which was an unexpected delight, and gave it a level of authority and authenticity that I did not expect.

If you want a family-friendly all-around-fun romp of a movie, I would highly recommend this.  As both a stand-alone film, and a primer/introduction to the series, I had to give this one five stars.",1154304000,7,1918,4.996845425867508

I had watched the start of the movie at one of my friends house and i loved they idea of a square piece of sponge with square pants.

Spongebob is not a piece of bathroom sponge but a piece of sea sponge found in the pacific so don't go thinking you can wash your hands with him...

Squidward is an octopus with only six legs (weird isn't it?)

Plankton is of course a cell of plankton and it crazed on the idea of ruling the world.

And patrick is spongebobs loyal and trustworthy friend.

These characters live in a world called Bikini Bottom based under the sea.

The base line story is about SpongeBob and Patrick going on a quest to the ""FORBIDDEN Shell City"" where spongebob and patrick must find King Neptunes crown or the framed mr Krabs will die! (i would tell you why but that would be giving too much away!)

The movie is one of the most funniest movies i have watched, drawn by the laughter coming out of the room my family decided they wanted to watch..

The whole of my family were in tears of laughter! the movie has some very nice features such as riding the ""hasselholf"". I feel the movie is for certain types of humour because whilst my family were in laughter i brought a friend round to watch and he just sat there and didn't laugh at any of the jokes even some of the most funniest parts he just sat there i ask him why and he just said it was not funny to the slightest point.

Now my review of the movie:

Now the movie i didn't like too much it can't be compared with the show, this film only showed a very irritating spongebob with ""nonsense jokes"", the story well i don't wanna to talk about it,the voice acting was fair, good actors like Alec Baldwin and one my favorite actress ""Scarlett Johanson"" put they voice to the chacters and what is wrong with that? their chacters only  have six lines in the whole movie,the visuals are exactly like the show, the directing was fairly-decent. Note: I don't wanna offend any fan of spongebob in fact i'm a fan from this show but i diskliked the movie and thats was only my opinion.

1599755,4,B00005JN55,"Having watched this with my child & company at the theater (and then at least 10 times at home), I can't escape putting a review here.  All of the familiar slapstick absurdities of Spongebob are here.  The joys of Bikini Bottom (yes, that's the name of the town!) are present as well.  Mr. Krab's Krusty Krab fast-food joint (where Spongebob works as fry cook), Spongebob's bosom best buddy Patrick Star (as in starfish, 'though I've yet to see a pink one in nature), the square, schadenfreude-laden Squidward (cashier at the Krusty Krab).

Others have mentioned it and I can't deny--it's difficult to take a 30 minute show broken down into two segments and weave a cohesive plot over an hour.  This film manages to make fair go of it, keeping the laughs flowing with new material, situations and an actual (*gasp*) plot.  There are new characters, especially the pride-filled King Neptune and his thoughtful daughter Mindy...but then again, Spongebob afficianados will remember the phrase uttered by Spongebob on many an occasion, ""By Neptune's Crown!"".  This movie gives some life to that phrase, as the plot revolves around a dastardly plot by Plankton to steal Neptune's crown and Rule The Undersea!  He's apparently moved on from coveting merely the Krabby Patty secret sauce by now.

Positive messages about teamwork, friendship, not giving up, setting goals and then achieving them.  Not too scary for the wee-wee ones--even scary put-ons end with a chuckle.  Two thumbs up for me, this is a funny family film grown-ups with a quirky sense of humor will enjoy watching with their little ones.  At least the first 11 times!",1144886400,6,1629,4.948529411764706
1599756,3,B00005JN55,"The Spongebob movie is basically a long version of the cartoon and as such suffers from stretching out material designed for a 15 slice to an hour and a half.

Even so the writing is still the same fine stuff that we are used to, the characters are funny, and the movie isn't afraid to make fun of itself ""I paid $[..] for this!?""

It is an entertaining choice for the kids and the older ones will have it's share of smiles.  I thought the butt jokes were a bit overdone but that's ok.  My major complaint is I can't get that stupid ""Goofy Goober"" song out of my head.  This can be a real problem when you're 42.

1599817,3,B00005JN55,"I'm 23 and have been a Spongebob fan since day one, and I was actually excited when this movie was released. But the film proved to be just a little disappointing. The movie starts off great, but like a lot of movies, begins to loose steam after a while. It really does feel like an episode off of TV that they have stretched to movie length. The sad thing is that there are episodes of Spongebob that are funnier and more entertaining than this movie. How long can a search for a king's crown last before it gets repetitive and a little dull? I would recommend this film to younger fans, the older fans may not find the plot suspenseful enough to actually keep interest. Spongebob is better as a 15-minute an episode show on Nickelodeon.",1144108800,2,738,4.4338235294117645
1599818,5,B00005JN55,"Let me say that I have always been a big kid. Cartoons are some of my favorite movies. The Emperor's New Groove is the standard to which I hold all animation up to.

Well, today I watched Spongebob Square Pants the Movie and I have to say that it was just great. From the dialog, witty and surprisingly smart (many things that your children won't get will have you rolling), to the flow of the plot. It follows Spongebob as he looses the manger job to the new Krusty Krab to Squidward. In the aftermath, Plankton, Krusty Krabs fast-food rival (despite never having one customer) devises a plan to put the Krusty Krab out of business. I won't ruin it for you. I'll just say it involves stealing the kings crown and blaming it on the owner of the Krusty Krab. Needless to say, it is up to Spongebob and his trusty pal to journey to the Forbidden Shell City to recover it. Along the way they run into, among others: redneck gas station attendents, underwater carjackers, legions of nasty crevas dwelling monsters, Dennis (Plankton's hitman), a mysterious giant cyclops and David Hasselhoffe (doing a spot on impersonation of himself on baywatch- the part spotlighting his pectoral muscles was the best!).

Never once did I realize what the Shell city was! Maybe I'm an idiot...ok I am an idiot but, this twist was truly a surprise to me and if you can guess then you're a better man than I.

Also

To heck with the musical ending of The Forty Year Old Virgin! Be gone with you pathetic excuse for an exit song, What About Marry? And don't even go there Shrek or Shrek Two.

As I watched the finally of Spongebob all past in-movie musical break-downs were wiped from my mind, leaving only Twisted Sisters refrain burned into my brain. Awesome; the only word fit to be associated with a flying Spongebob wielding a two handled flaming electrified guitar, nay, ax! Shooting bolts of lightning from its heads. Destroying the evil mind control buckets from the heads of Bikini Bottom's citizenry. Althewhile, ""I wanna rock!"" blasting from his lungs- stopping only for the most hellacious guitar solo this side of Pink Floyd.

In the immortal words of Spongebob's nemesis, Plankton, as he watched in dismay, ""I cannot resist him! His chops are to righteous!""

My only caveat is that Spongebob, after all his soul searching, still takes the managers job. Is he trying to say that after all that it still makes him feel good to ""manage"" others?

Perhaps I'm being to hard on him; maybe he was only excited to full-fill his dream and ultimate wish. However, the film doesn't show the forty year old Spongebob working 80 hours a week mopping up after jerk-offs and their kids while his wife is at home cheating on him with the neighbor.",1143331200,2,2723,4.634854771784233

1599820,5,B00005JN55,"SpongeBob SquarePants is a brilliant, clever TV show and should be regarded as such.  In these respects, this movie is no different from the TV series.
The plot involves Mr. Krabs opening up another restaurant called ""The Krusty Krab 2"", and SpongeBob expects to be appointed manager of said restaurant, since he's such a good employee.  Unfortunately, Squidward is elected manager because, according to Mr. Krabs, SpongeBob is just a kid, and so therefore he's not the right choice for the job.  This breaks SpongeBob's heart, obviously.

Meanwhile, Plankton, who is as always up to no good, conducts another diabolical scheme to get the Krabby Patty secret formula.  He breaks into the palace of King Neptune, a merman who rules the sea with an iron fist, and steals King Neptune's crown.  Plankton then proceeds to pin the crime on Mr. Krabs.
King Neptune is of course incensed about this, because (1) the crown is a symbol of his kinglike authority and (2) it covers his bald spot.  So he goes to set Mr. Krabs on fire.  SpongeBob is determined to save Mr. Krabs and also prove that he's not just a kid, so he offers to go and retrieve Neptune's crown, which is now in the forbidden Shell City.  King Neptune is of course skeptical, to say the least, about SpongeBob's offer, because he, too, thinks SpongeBob is just a kid.  However, Neptune's daughter Mindy, who is much more compassionate than her father, convinces him to accept SpongeBob's offer, granting Mr. Krabs a six-day reprieve.  So SpongeBob and Patrick go off on a quest to save the day.
Unfortunately, King Neptune decides that Mr. Krabs should stay frozen in ice until the time of his sentence, so Plankton takes this opportunity to sneak in and get the Krabby Patty formula.  And as if that wasn't bad enough, he also sends a hit man named Dennis after SpongeBob and Patrick, and he also puts all of Bikini Bottom under his mind control.

This is one of the best movies I've ever seen, to say the least.  The voice acting is really well done, the writing is exceptionally clever, and the animation is also really good.
After watching it, I found it a little hard to believe that so many people had ugly things to say about it.
My personal favorite parts included the beginning, with the live-action pirates going to the movies and singing the SpongeBob SquarePants theme song.
This scene is also entertaining if you view it using the French language track (""Bob L'Eponge Carre!"").
I also liked where SpongeBob steps on Plankton and then tries to scrape him off his shoe; Mr. Lawrence (Plankton's voice actor) is really good at screaming.  In fact, he's really good, period, but being really good at screaming gets extra points in my book.
There is also this one part where Neptune's baldness is exposed in the Krusty Krab, causing the crowd to scream in terror (""BALD!!! BALD!!! BALD!!! BALD!!!"" ""MY EYES!!"").  You really just have to see it to get the full effect.
And then there is this part where David Hasselhoff has an unexpected live-action cameo.  This is also something you have to see in order to get the full effect.

In conclusion, contrary to practically every other review you're likely to see, this movie is great, and I highly recommend getting it.  It's well worth seeing again and again.",1142121600,3,3275,4.734154929577465

The worst thing the producers could do was to include real people and stupid effects that make you laugh in the movie.

1599894,4,B00005JN55,"There are 3 reviewers on amazon.com who all work at Blockbuster in Oregon, we all close alot together including a 4th customer service rep who is not a reviewer, EVERY SINGLE NIGHT that the 4 of us are somehow lumped together this movie is put on. Any one of us could be having an awfull night and this gets played and BOOM! things just got a little better (but only a little, remember we do work at Blockbuster)

Anyway, this has got to be one of the most fun, silly, hilarious, movies out there. It's only 85 minutes, so ya never get bored, the actors who do the voices are incredible, and one huge surprise, the soundtrack is excellent. I downloaded every song and all 4 of us play it constantly. We also are quoting lines from it all the time.....Such as when Plankton proclaims he is ""going to take over the world"" to which Spongebob answers ""well good luck with that"" and off he goes to work, priceless.

But believe it or not, Spongebob is not the best character in this, Patrick Starr is my main pink dude, whether he is singing and dancing to the Goofy Goober theme song, or insisting he is not a kid but still needs a toy with his kids meal, or even having a knee slapping contest with spongebob (ya go spongebob). Be sure and watch his facial expressions closely, those alone will bring you to tears, specially when he is gushing over the mermaid he has a crush on.

The supporting characters are just as important and hilarious. Alec Baldwin is just perfect as Dennis, a bounty hunter hired by Plankton to exterminate Spongebob and Patrick, also, Jeffrey Tambor is King Neptune, who just happens to have a slight ""thinning"" problem. Scarlett Johannsen is Mindy, Neptune's daughter, and she is great in a scene where she fools the boys into thinking they are men. Plankton, Squidword, and Mr. Krabbs also have smaller roles, but still contribute

There are a  couple of funny moments like when SpongeBob Gets Drunk from eating too many Goofy Goober Sundaes, and the fish at the County Line, But I didn't think that those things or really anything in the movie was too funny(no offence). Also, SpongeBob drives a hamburger to their destination, which is pretty cool, but come on, A sponge driving a hamburger? Puh! Also, there was no humor in the movie, which made double the dissapointment for me.",1131926400,,689,4.741666666666666
1599896,5,B00005JN55,"Once upon a cable network, there was a born a fantastic little animated program. A hilarious, original, and bizarre show about a flamboyant sponge who lives under the sea, flips burgers at an aquatic fast-food joint, blows bubbles, and embarks on wacky misadventures with his best friend Patrick (a starfish), despite the grumpiness of his next-door neighbor, Squidward, who is also his co-worker. This show was ""Spongebob Squarepants"".

Well, needless to say, I've been a big fan of Spongebob since the beginning. When I heard there was going to be a film based on this wonderful show, I wasn't quite sure how to feel. A part of me rejoiced over the very idea of feature-length Spongebob, yet another part of me was very much worried that this would turn out to be another run-of-the-mill kids movie full of fart jokes and supposedly ""funny"" scenes where the characters suddenly start dancing to some Britney Spears song.

Well, as you probably noticed from my rating, my hopes were more than satisfied.

The film is every bit as hysterical as the very best episodes of the television show, featuring some of the most random, bizarre, and completely ridiculous humor ever put on film, and it probably helps that this always made for my favorites episodes of Spongebob.

The film finds Spongebob and Patrick embarking on an epic journey to recover the malevolent King Neptune's (the ruler of Bikini Bottom, the town where Spongebob resides) crown, which the evil Plankton stole and framed Mr. Krabs (Spongebob's boss) for. Along the way, they encounter rough thugs, monsters, a contract killer sent to stop them, and a deep-sea diver out to turn them into ""humorous dioramas"".

The film showcases slightly sharper animation than the show, dead-on comic timing, and plenty of completely ludicrous and absurd situations, including a particularly memorable sequence in which Spongebob and Patrick ride ""The (David) Hasselhoff"" out to sea. The music in the end credits is actually quite impressive, as well, featuring Ween, The Flaming Lips, and Wilco.

The film's only flaw are the tedious and unfunny, yet thankfully seldom, live-action sequences. The aforementioned Hasselhoff scene being an exception, of course.

But those segments aside, ""The Spongebob Squarepants Movie"" is a hilarious celebration of the off-beat and actually turns out being a little bit epic.

1599928,5,B00005JN55,"This is how I first got into the whole SpongeBob thing. I was taken to see the movie when it went into cinemas and I was floored. It was incredible! After that, I got more into SpongeBob the more I watched it. And now that it's on DVD, I am going to rent it as often as possible, if I can't buy it. To me, this is the greatest movie ever made. I mean that. It is so funny, cool, mind-numbingly insane, that I can't watch it enough. I would say that I have definitely yearned to watch it more than any other DVD I own. I just like SpongeBob. He's a cute little guy. When I'm down, the aspect of going down to a pineapple under the sea is perfect!
But enough of the mushy stuff. The synopsis. *To myself: Stay on track please.*

So here's the thing. SpongeBob has always dreamed to be the manager of the Krusty Krab, Bikini Bottom's best day time eatery, instead of just a fry cook. And today, March 7th (or 8th), that dream is finally gonna come true! Because Mr Krabs, long time manager and cheapskate krab, is opening a Krusty Krab 2 right next door to the original! (For money purposes.) But SpongeBob, at the opening ceremony, has his dreams slashed repeatedly, for it is his introvert cashier co-worker Squidward Tentacles that gets the promotion. (To find out why I called him introvert as opposed to ""grumpy"", see Absorbing SpongeBob.) And all because SpongeBob is just a ""kid"".
Poor SpongeBob. But there is still hope! For whilst he's suffering a nervous breakdown in Goofy Gooper's Ice Cream Party Boat (I'm A Goopy Gooper, Yeah!), Mr Krab's arch rival Plankton (owner of the Chum Bucket) attempts his last, greatest plan to get the secret formula for the Krabby Patty. Plan Z. And what is Plan Z? To steal the crown of deep-sea king King Neptune and frame Mr Krabs!!!
But though still resenting Mr Krabs for turning him down for the managerial promotion, when plucky SpongeBob finds out, he volunteers to get the crown back from forbidden place Shell City. And after encouragement from his daughter Mindy and a bit of tampering from SpongeBob's best goober mate Patrick (not the smartest bulb on the Easter Pumpkin, if you get me), King Neptune finally lets them go, but warns that if they don't come back with the crown in 6 days, he gets to ""splatter this crab all over the walls!""
And so begins a brilliant animation cross live action adventure. I won't say anymore in fear of giving it away. Will SpongeBob survive? After getting his hands on the formula, what else does Plankton have in mind? And what will Squidward make of what's in store? (Besides ""all hail Pla----""
Oops! That nearly let the cat outta the bag.) Watch SpongeBob SquarePants The Movie to find out!
All I will say in conclusion is, I think SpongeBob speaks for himself, and all of us, when he sings ""I'm a Goofy Goober!!!!!!!!""",1125964800,,2809,4.518664047151277
1599929,3,B00005JN55,"In ten-minute segments, SpongeBob Squarepants is perfectly entertaining in a vaudeville-meets-Bullwinkle manner, supremely silly and maddeningly clever at the same time. As a full-length feature clocking in at ninety minutes, this 2004 movie had my attention wandering despite the plethora of animated special effects. The main problem is the scope of the plot...it just keeps going on and on without a driving structure. In the TV series, a major part of the fun was how SpongeBob faced mundane dilemmas such as proving to Sandy (the Texas-twanged squirrel in the dive suit) the superiority of sea creatures over their land counterparts or driving his next-door neighbor and Krusty Krab co-worker, the octopi curmudgeon Squidward Tentacles, up the wall.

Unfortunately neither Sandy nor Squidward play large parts in the movie, and instead we are presented an elaborate coming-of-age film with obligatory guest appearances by the likes of Alec Baldwin, Scarlett Johansson and even an age-defiant David Hasselhoff who plays a superhero version of himself. A bright yellow kitchen sponge who lives in a pineapple in Bikini Bottom, SpongeBob hangs out with his best friend Patrick, a Krabby patty-bellied, slow-minded (though not slow-witted) pink starfish. SpongeBob's dream is to become the manager of the new Krusty Krab II, which is conveniently opening next door to the original one.

Meanwhile, there is a nasty plankton who wants to steal the secret recipe for Krusty Krab's burgers for his own place, the unfortunately named Chum Bucket. He hatches an elaborately devious plan to steal King Neptune's crown from his bald head and then frames SpongeBob's boss Mr. Krabs for the crime. The king freezes Krabs as punishment and gives SpongeBob six days to recover the crown from Shell City before Krabs is turned into dinner. This is just the set-up, and the bulk of the movie has Patrick accompanying SpongeBob on a hair-raising journey where all sorts of creepy creatures block their path, including an evil terminator-type named Dennis. Naturally, Neptune's beautiful daughter Mindy provides moral if rather ineffectual support. In the meantime, Plankton turns everyone into mindless drones back home.

At heart, it's about how SpongeBob and Patrick want to be ""men"" and treated with respect. Its derivative ""Wizard of Oz"" structure has a lot of discomforting turns along the way. While funny in parts, the whole of the movie starts to feel elephantine and somewhat sadistic, though the concept of Shell City is one of the smarter plot devices. Hasselhoff's appearance in full Baywatch glory is rather surreal, but it does provide an amusing if overly contrived twist, as does the use of a Twisted Sister song to liberate the people (or more accurately, the sealife) of Bikini Bottom. The vocal performances are fine - Tom Kenny as SpongeBob and Bill Fagerbakke as Patrick with special kudos to Jeffrey Tambor for his vainglorious Neptune and Baldwin as the oily Dennis. The only high profile disappointment is Johansson who does not offer much personality as Mindy.

There are several special features with the DVD package, including the standard making-of featurette. But the other short films are even more worthwhile since they are designed to increase viewer interest in the preservation of the oceans. One is ""The Case of the SpongeBob"", produced by Jean-Michel Cousteau's Ocean's Futures Society, which shows an array of sea creatures in their natural habitats with voiceover commentary by Cousteau; and the other is ""Saving the Surf"", produced by the Surfrider Foundation, which addresses the effect of pollution on coastal waters. Like Pixar's ""The Incredibles"", there are also animated storyboards to show deleted scenes.",1125792000,3,3737,5.296795952782462

The creator Steven Hillenburg is a genius, and knows how to get someone laughing!!! Spongebob is a cartoon, which will have both kids and parents in uproars of laughter!!!

 Yes, there may be some people out their that may think Spongebob, is corny and stupid, the reason they say this is because they don't know how to have fun, so don't listen to them!!! The only reason I gave this a 4 star rating, is because some of the comedy in this movie was a little wierd(example: David Hasselhoff, come on how about a bay watch girl instead) and dense, but along with some flat out hilarious parts, and some real eye candy!!! I've also noticed how they had some parts and lines from some movies and tv shows, which was a plus!!! The regular Spongebob TV show is plainly better material!!!

 I was slightly dissapointed, and knew it could have been better,.... it was most likely rushed under pressure, but heck the movie still is great and is a must have for hardcore spongebob fans!!! I myself would perfer buying, the season box set, which would also be a just as good, if not better buy!!!

 The story, goes like this; Plakton is desparate to find a way to steal the Krabby Patty secret formula, he finds the forgotten plan z, and immediately puts his plan into action!!! Meanwhile, Mr. Krabs is opening the brand new Krusty Krab 2 and is planing to name the new manager at the big Grand Opening cermony!!! Spongebob, is very confident that he will win, and wants the job very badly!!!

 Well, in the end he ends up not getting the promotion!!! In a chain of events, Plakton frames Mr. Krabs, for stealing King Neptune's crown and is frozen solid!!! Spongebob and Patrick must team up and go to the forbidden ""Shell City"" to find the crown, well they also have a little help from Princess Mindy(Scarlett Johanson)of course!!!

 On this journey, Spongebob and Patrick must risk their lives and must be willing to become men as they square off against dangerous under sea bikers, a whole lot of monsters, and a bounty hunter(Alec Baldwin)!!! Heck, they even get a little help from David Hasselhoff!!! They must stop Plankton and save Bikini Bottom!!!

The premise of the film has Plankton scheming to steal the recipe for krabby patties from Eugene Crabs. He does this by framing Mr. Crabs for a crime he didn't commit which was stealing the crown from King Neptune. In order to save Mr. Crabs from a horrible fate, Spongebob and Patrick quickly goes on a road trip to find the missing crown which they are given only six days to find and bring back. During the journey, Spongebob has a self-discovery moment about himself and becomes more aware of himself.

Although the film wasn't as laugh out loud funny as the tv series, I still enjoyed the film for what it is. Some of the funniest moments involved Patrick Star. I loved seeing him wearing fishnet stockings and stiletto high heels. I also had to laugh when he parachuted into the grand opening ceremony with his boxer shorts and wearing absolutely nothing but his birthday suit. I was relieved to see that Sandy Squirrel was not given any screen time since I always found her annoying. The musical in the last five minutes of the film was not terribly interesting nor entertaining. I thought that was pretty pointless making the ending rather disappointing.

The various guest appearances were great. I even thought David Hasselhoff was funny and I can't stand the guy. Scarlett Johanssen's appearance as Mindy the mermaid was pretty memorable but brief. I loved Jeffrey Tambor as King Neptune. He was so over the top. Even Alec Baldwin was good as the hired hitman Dennis.

1600046,5,B00005JN55,"As a 40-something animation freak who still thinks Looney Tunes are the greatest, I somehow ignored SpongeBob SquarePants until I got my hands on this movie. Now, I think these just might be the greatest cartoon characters since Bugs, Daffy and company. The movie's different from the TV cartoons, as I'd learn after seeing a few of the latter, but the whole package is unique, colorful, imaginative and laugh-out-loud funny. Unlike the wacky sketches that make up the TV version, the movie brings SpongeBob and Patrick (Squidward's relatively quiet here) out of Bikini Bottom and on the road to someplace called ""Shell City"", where no sea creature ever gets out alive. They have to recover King Neptune's crown, which the evil Plankton has stolen- and pinned the blame on a now-frozen Mr. Krabs.

  See SpongeBob cry his eyes out and get drunk on ice cream cocktails! See Plankton put Chum Buckets on everyone's head and electrocute them into zombies! See Shell City- a beach knick-knack shop- and watch what happens when a crying SpongeBob lets his tears hit the light bulbs (fantastic sequence)! These and more imaginative bits make up the fast-moving adventure (although, as some have noted, the rock n'roll climax is a bit lame), an expanded- not weakened- take on the original TV cartoon concept. Even David Hasselhoff, who swims the boys back home, looks like he's really enjoying himself instead of playing the surfing pretty boy.

  All the regular characters and voice cast are joined by pompous, balding Jeffrey Tambor as pompous, balding mer-man King Neptune; the gifted young Scarlett Johansson as his kindly crown princess daughter, Mindy the Mermaid; a growling Alec Baldwin as the biker hit-man Dennis; and, as noted, David Hasselhoff in both human and 15-foot model form. They're all introduced, along with creator/director Stephen Hillenberg, on one of several featurettes included; my favorite voices are Tom Kenny (SpongeBob) among regulars and Johansson among the guests.

  There's one great extra here, which is also a reminder that Hillenberg is also a trained oceanographer. He's part of a film with none other than Jean-Michel Cousteau, who initially asks (in his thick Gallic accent) ""we have a new species of sponge called- Bob Square Pants?"" (Too funny?) Then, Cousteau shows off the real aquatic counterparts to the animated characters. It's a treat to see genuine sponges, squids, sea stars (not ""starfish"", thank you), and even the rare frog fish (that's the thing which almost devours SpongeBob and Patrick after offering them a phony ice cream cone). If you haven't seen a Cousteau film in a while- or if you're a kid and have never seen one- you'll get a kick out of this.

  ""The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie"" is the real ""Life Aquatic"", and a lot funnier- and less pretentious- than that pompous Bill Murray vehicle. Now, I'm ready to plunge into the TV/DVD compilations!",1121472000,3,2907,5.058577405857741

The movie is about two friends who go and save the King's crown on their own because they were forced and tricked by the evil Plankton. I am a huge spongebob fan and I watched the movie several times and it turned out to be really good.

The makers of spongebob wanted to make this movie really funny. When that happens the jokes turn out to be dumb, and that's exactly what happened in this movie. The jokes got a little weird and dumb, and it wasn't really funny after all. Normally, if the show is funny, the movie will be even more. But it didn't really happen here. I think any spongebob show is funnier than watching this movie. The jokes in the movie are okay.

1600094,3,B00005JN55,"I can understand the average review being a 4/5 since you should be lenient considering it's a cartoon movie. However, if it were to stand on its own, I would probably give it a 1/5.

There are basically three main problems I have with the movie: Unoriginal, plot is a horrible ripoff of Odyssey, and worst of all, Squidward is missing from the main plot.

By unoriginal, I mean it lacks any unique humor and instead bases the whole comedy aspect on randomness with a touch of the typical Spongebob humor. In addition, all the jokes are horribly lame. For example, at one point in the movie, Plankton comments on how lucky he is to have Karen as his wife, she retorts with she never agreed to the marriage. Aside from that, though, the usual Spongebob plot holes which you could easily ignore on the show becomes overbearing in the movie.

As for the plot being a bad ripoff of the Odyssey, well, that's obvious. There was NOTHING in their journey. The most dangerous situation they faced was at Shell City. In the other parts, they passed incredibly easily. They literally had helped from the things that were supposed to make their journey dangerous and epic.

The last and worst problem is immediately noticeable when Squidward refuses to join Spongebob and Patrick on their journey. Patrick is incredibly funny, but his random acts of stupidity simply does not hold a candle to Squidward's stoicism. He's the best freaking character in the whole show! Without him, I wouldn't even watch the show! I couldn't believe the creators of the movie decided to leave him out! They must have been on some type of hallucinogen to think that the movie would be better without him.

Finally, this is a small problem, but it's a problem that occurs frequently and eventually ruins the movie too. The creator cops out far too often. By ""cop out"", I mean they take the easy way out. Rather than thinking up unique approaches, they take the easy path and be unimaginative. For example, in one situation where Spongebob and Patrick faced danger, instead of imaginatively thinking an approach to how Spongebob and Patrick may get out unharmed. The creators decides that the duo entrances the danger and the danger helps them escape. THAT is horrible! The same problem occur at the end too! Instead of thinking up something unique, the creators employs the worst ending ever!

Overall, you may want to see this movie if you're a huge fan, but if you're not, then I wouldn't recommend it at all.",1118793600,,2479,4.713625866050808
1600155,4,B00005JN55,"I've been curious about the whole SpongeBob SquarePants phenomenon (as in what the heck is SpongeBob SquarePants?) for awhile now, so I decided to watch the movie.  I went into this thing knowing nothing whatsoever about SpongeBob SquarePants - I have never seen the TV show, and I could never even remember the name (Spongepants Squarebob?).  Yes, I was a complete SpongeBob SquarePants virgin.

SpongeBob is seemingly a sponge and he does have square pants, so the name apparently isn't some kind of secret code that only children understand - that's good.  He lives underneath the sea, where he works as a fry cook at Krabby Patties and pals around with a starfish named, appropriately enough, Patrick Starfish.  He's all excited because he expects to be named the new manager at Krabby Patties 2.  Someone else gets the job, though, causing SpongeBob to drown his sorrows in tons of ice cream.  The boss thinks he's just a kid, and he wants to be an adult.  Meanwhile, the evil Plankton (who looks like a green pepper to me), who has been trying to get the Krabby Patties secret recipe for ages, puts his Plan Z in motion, stealing the beloved crown of King Neptune and blaming the theft on Mr. Krabs.  Even though his boss is not SpongeBob's favorite person right now, SpongeBob alone comes forth to defend Mr. Krabs, swearing that he (and Patrick) will go to Shell City and get the stolen crown.  Fortunately, Neptune's daughter Missy believes in them when no one else does, and off they go.

Yes, SpongeBob and Patrick undertake the dangerous journey in order to prove that they are men, not boys - and they face many life-threatening obstacles on their way.  It's going to take more than Missy's psychological ""mermaid magic"" to get the boys through this one; it's going to take - shudder - David Hasselhoff.  Most kids won't understand the irony of this, not knowing that David Hasselhoff, Mr. Baywatch himself, nearly drowned once while filming his show, but we adults can chuckle at the sight of Hasselhoff making like a speedboat across the ocean waves.

It's a funny movie, but it seems obvious to me that the movie is a result of and not an explanation for the SpongeBob phenomenon.  I didn't see anything in the movie itself that would explain the humongous appeal of these characters.  Of course, most movies of this type are only poor reflections of the TV shows that inspired them.  It's certainly family-friendly entertainment, even though some adults won't understand what the heck the youngsters find so uproariously funny about the whole thing.  I enjoyed the movie, but I don't expect you'll see me wearing any SpongeBob SquarePants paraphernalia any time soon.  SpongeBob seems to speak to kids rather than most adults, and I say let the kids have their fun and join in a little bit if and when you can.",1117584000,,2827,4.767967145790554

1600194,2,B00005JN55,"Whoever is buying this type of DVD read below the full facts on the fullscreen edition, the following is obviously true.

Conversions from movies that attempt to fit as 'fullscreen editions' and people thinking on buying the fullscreen version won't know a little bit of picture they're missing from their television screen which happenes to fullscreen television sizes. I own the widescreen version of the SpongeBob SquarePants Movie, considering me a SpongeBob fan myself and this movie feels like another SpongeBob episode is combined with it, you probably figured that out already!

Before you add this DVD to your cart, I would prefer the widescreen edition, because you will get the full picture of the movie just like you see it wide in the cinema, creating a brilliant outstanding picture, and you could even see extra areas that may be cut off from your fullscreen television screen. Experienced DVD fanatics like me would know everything about this, and you should too with your other collections of Digital Versatile Discs.

Because it's still the SpongeBob SquarePants Movie that I expect it to be, I'm giving this kind a very sad two stars because fullscreen editions aren't crash hot mostly all the good time, and at least there is the movie you get what you really pay for.

If you don't believe my opinion then you would rather learning on DVD screen resolutions - don't waste your money by testing this out. You'll be sorry. Oh by the way, who cares if you don't have a widescreen television? Get it anyway!

1600196,5,B00005JN55,"To begin, I LOVED THIS MOVIE.  I don't know if it was the adult themed story, the classic lines that you could find yourself repeating as if it was a cult classic, or the simplistic nature of the story, but I simply fell in love with this wacky piece of cinema.  SpongeBob is not your typical hero, and his friend Patrick, doesn't seem to fit the mold of your typical ""best-friend role"".  I found myself laughing at this film because of the messages that it taught and how I guy like me, stuck in the retail world, could easily identify with the trauma that SpongeBob was experiencing.  Also, this film was flat out hysterical.  I wasn't expecting anything except for kids humor when I first watched it, but after the final credits rolled I was impressed by how adult oriented the humor truly was.  The comic timing was perfect, the music resonated perfectly in my ear, and I can honestly say that from the opening pirate credits to the final jump in the air, this film was the rawest form of cinematic perfection and the BEST film I have seen this 2005 year (so far).

I know you are probably thinking, ""Andy, you watch a lot of movies, why did you like this one so much?"" and I really don't have a straightforward answer to that question.  Perhaps it is the repetitive nature of the films that I am currently watching that had me running towards the arms of this SpongeBob movie, or maybe because comedies are not quite the caliber of humor as they once were (resorting to restroom humor and sex instead of actual ""funny"" comedy), or maybe it was because it told a story that I could relate to, but whatever the case may be this film ranks among the best.  I have seen this movie about 20+ times already and cannot wait to see it again.  It is one of those films where I catch something new each time, I still laugh at most of the scenes (the bar scene is my personal favorite), and I get that aura of excitement everytime I place the DVD in the player.  This film is like my unquenchable drug of choice.

SpongeBob is one of those heroes that I can, and I think most in the retail/working sector of the world, relate to.  He works hard, he wants promotion, and continues to live his life as his heart allows ... like a kid.  Isn't that what we all desire?  I know that is a crucial element to my life to ensure that I stay true to those and myself around me.  Also, it has always been a dream of mine to have a seaweed mustache, and this film promotes the use of this green apparatus.  I don't want to sound repetitive, but I cannot wait to add this film to my DVD collection.  It provided, and still provides, at least an hour and a half of pure, uncut, humor that will leave some great songs in your mind and this new found respect in your heart.  Who hasn't walked into your office one day just singing, ""I'm ready, promotion.  I'm ready, promotion"".  Or better yet, ended the day singing, ""I'm ready, depression.  I'm ready, depression.""  HA, this has me nearly falling out of my seat as I type this now.

The heart, humor, and childlike feeling for this hero will have children falling over to see this film (though where I work most children are not huge fans of this film ... they say that television program is better), and if it is watched by an embarrassed adult, you will be surprised on how much you could probably relate to this film.  We are all ""goofy goobers"" inside, and sometimes it takes a film such as this to pull it out of us.  We all wish that we could break out into song whenever possible or even spend an evening at a bar enjoying round after round of ice cream treats.

Overall, I loved this movie.  Well, actually, I more than loved it, I thought it was one of the best films that I have seen this year.  So many times we watch movies that get too caught up in themselves.  They are too serious or too violent or too goofy for what they set out to be, and it was an honest delight to finally find something that was just what it was.  SpongeBob is my new hero and I have already found myself watching the television programs whenever possible.  You have a new fan SpongeBob ... I hope that you will always remain the ""goofy goober"" that I fell in love with!!

Some how seeing Patrick in a pair of net stockings and high heels sort of ruins the image of cool to dearly sad way of getting a laugh, if someone finds that funny.

About 30 minutes in, we looked at each other, shrugged, and turned it off. Neither an Oscar-winning drama or this swashbuckling extravaganza could hold our attention.

But I'll tell you what did.

Spongebob Squarepants. Or, as my son has been calling him, ""Punjab Scorpion"". Hey, that kind of sounds like a pro wrestler: ""And now ladies and gentlemen, facing The Rock for the first time, the Raja of Ripped, the Sultan of Sting, the Nabob of Nasty! The Punjab Scorpion!

Ahem. Right. Anyway, Spongebob rocks. I picked up the movie for my son on a whim, not really knowing what to expect. Spongebob is said to have a certain crossover appeal to adults, but his draw isn't in the refined humor of Pixar, with grown-up jokes slipped in amid the kiddie fare. Spongebob is simply so joyously ridiculous that it ends up being charming, even to adults.

Spongebob is also not glossy and cuddly like Nemo or whomever. Spongebob is a sponge. He has buck teeth and freckles. He wears athletic socks with what appear to be orthopedic shoes.

Sometimes the movie is pretty gross. In one alarming scene, a character's eyes melt out (to be magically restored in the next instant). In another instance, Spongebob and a friend take turn blasting tears out of their eyes into the other's mouth. In one hilarious sequence, Spongebob gets smashed on about half a dozen mega ice cream sundaes. The next morning, he looks like yesterday's bait.

Oh, and David Hasselhoff makes a cameo near the end that some people found creepy but that struck me as utterly hilarious. It was probably a little of both, but makes the movie well worth sticking through. Later, when Spongebob confronts the bad guy, he runs through a list of his accomplishments, including the boast: ""I rode the Hasselhoff!""

The movie ends with an unexpectedly funny '80s-style rock video, with Spongebob cranking out some guitar licks as he saves the day. It's actually a catchy little number that is convincing in its over-the-top guitar god riffing.

I got the feeling Spongebob really came from the heart of his creator. You watch some of these kids' shows, like the Teletubbies or whatever, and sometimes they just seem to be trying too hard. ""C'mon kids, isn't this great?!? We have big cuddly colorful androgynous things bouncing across your screen!"" It seems so manufactured. But somehow, with his retro 2-D animation, squeaky voice, red tie and brown pants, Spongebob Squarepants is just real.",1111363200,5,2603,4.873303167420814

When you are a little older you seem to really appreciate the hilarity put into Spongebob & Patrick's characters.

Also, when Patrick asked Mindy if she wanted to see his underwear, this was a little disturbing for me. The repeated use of the term ""bubble blowing baby"" was not something I really want my son to hear.

1600334,2,B00005JN55,"Designed for the kid at heart, this movie is an animated feature film starring the man who lives under the sea, Spongebob Squarepants. In this movie, Spongebob volunteers to travel to Shell City to retrieve the missing crown of King Neptune. The king has falsely accused Mr. Krab- Songebob's boss where he works- of steeling the crown and has threatened to execute him immediately if Spongebob doesn't find the real thief of his prized possession.

This movie is aimed at the younger crowd, ages one to eight. As far as cartoon movies go, this one doesn't rank very high on my critically acclaimed list. The reason is that the movie is mostly stupid with very few laughs. I realize this is a kid's film, but there are other animated feature films with many more laughs and something for everyone in the family to enjoy. With this movie, the only ones laughing are gong to be those under eight years of age.

Even when this movie isn't attempting to be funny, it is still pretty lame. Most every scene is predictable, including the ending, which you already know about ten minutes into the film. The singing scenes are also pretty weak, especially the song ""Now That We're Men"", sung by Spongebob and his friend Patrick, the starfish. The lyrics of this song are silly and even juveniles will roll their eyes when they listen to it. The only good song in this movie comes near the end when Spongebob starts to sing a heavy metal- type tune. It's not something you expect, and it is at least mildly amusing.

David Hasselhoff makes a cameo appearance in this film and, once again, his part is rather silly and forgettable. And that sums up my feelings toward this movie very well. Youngsters will enjoy it very much, but it will put adults and teenagers to sleep with its goofiness, lack of good humor, and complete predictability.",1110931200,,1829,4.656346749226006

Of course my sons think the movie is great and they would give it a much higher rating, but my biggest complaint and the reason for only 3 stars is that the movie was just too long and the laughs were forced- a 30 minute cartoon is the perfect length for SpongeBob, 87 minutes is really pushing it. The movie did have some funny scenes in it, but it also had some parts I thought were just dumb- ie, the David Hasslehoff scenes were amusing for just a second or two and then they quickly became annoying to me. Also, I didn't really like the voice of Princess Mindy- it wasn't animated enough for a SpongeBob cartoon character, and was kind of bland and boring.

It was fairly clever, but I'm getting tired of this sort of shtick, where B-list celebs do campy, self-referential turns. Also, the ""star"" voices are pretty disapponting. Alec Baldwin isn't bad, but Jeffrey Tambor is merely loud, and Scarlett Johansson doesn't even really do a voice. It really made me appreciate the regulars.

The movie is pretty funny, and the special features are worth watching if only to see the actors behind the voices, particularly Mr. Lawrence.",1110758400,2,539,5.125

All right, all right.  What's so bad about this movie?  Really.  Sure, it's got some crude bits but to me those are some of the funnies parts.  And there is nothing wrong with Sandy having one line.  She's not that important of a character, anyway.  Do you see her often in the show?  I do agree that Squidward needed a bit more screentime.  I think he's quite funny.  I love the TV show, and I loved this movie when I viewed it in the theater on opening night.  The ending is most definately the funniest part of this little flick.

And for those who think he is homosexual...

You've got to be kidding me.  He's supposed to be childlike, not homosexual.  And what's so bad about homosexuality anyway?  I have friends who are homosexuals.  So, all of you overly obsessive Christians can go shove it.  I'm a Christian, too but it's not right to bash homosexuality or the people that practice it.  Sorry for the rant, but things like that do make me a bit mad.

From the beginning this movie took every little joke too far.  There would be something funny, but then they would keep going untill the joke was dead.

Also there was a great deal of violence which I find that no child could find humourous.  The impressions on the character's faces were very scary and disturbing at times.  Like when the time Patrick's face was melting.

Also the amount of them talking about executing Mr. Krabs and other people.  The idea of enslaving the entire world with buckets and Plankton's crazed laugh really made it into a horror film.

There was a lot of crude humor and images, such as Patrick dressed up in fishnet stockings.

In conclusion they made this movie loud and scary, to hide the fact that it wasn't funny.

Do yourselves a favor, if you are a real spongebob fan, don't view this movie.  It is NOTHING like the TV series, you will regret watching it.",1110585600,4,1072,4.469072164948454

1600392,5,B00005JN55,"When I heard that the creators of Spongebob Squarepants were going to attempt a full-length motion picture, I was a bit skeptical.  But after watching the movie I am a believer.  They managed to take the half-hour television series to the big screen with complete success.

The show starts off with Spongebob expecting to become the manager of the new Krusty Krab II.  But when Mr. Krabs decides to make Squidward the new manager, Spongebob is told by his boss that he is just a kid and not ready for the responsibilities of being a manager.  And that sets the ball rolling.

Plankton has one last plan (in the Z-file) to try and steal the Krabby Pattie secret recipe.  I don't want to give the plot away, so I won't tell you if his devious plan succeeds or not.  But what I will tell you is that the movie has some very funny parts, some very well-thought-out parts, and the same charm found in the television series.  It was entertaining from beginning to end.

Spongebob and Patrick are hilarious together, and it was great to see them set out on a seemingly impossible adventure where they had to confront sea monsters, tough desperadoes, ice-creme hangovers, rejection, a giant ditch, bubble haters, a car-jacker, and a dimwitted and bald King Neptune.

Rent or buy this movie right away, grab the family and sit down to a total delight.  Watch out for the pirates though!

SpongeBob is a pretty good animated movie.  The opening sequence is original and funny.  For some reason, it wasn't quite as funny as the TV show is, but it was still pretty good.  I missed SpongeBob's squirelly girlfriend, but other than that I enjoyed every minute.

Best part: when Spongebob and Patrick dry up on land.  Almost brings a tear to your eye!  Worst part:  Seeing David Hasselhoff's leg hair.  Ugh!

1600394,4,B00005JN55,"With a swashbuckling beginning, ""The Spongebob Squarepants Movie"" leaves the uninitiated a little edgy.  Once Spongebob hits the screen, however, the newbies and us old fans settle in for a wonderful little nautical treat that is worthy of multiple viewings.  The plot is rather simple, and not very new.  Plankton is after the beloved and highly guarded secret recipe for Krabby Patties.....again.  He decides to frame Mr. Krabbs for stealing King Neptune's crown.  This results in Mr. Krabbs being taken into custody, or chilled.  Spongebob and his idiot friend, Patrick Starfish, decide they will go to Shell City and recover the crown in order to prove Mr. Krabbs' innocence.  What follows is typical, yet hilarious, Spongebob humor.

Some won't understand, others will refuse to understand it.  That's okay with me, because I enjoyed the entire film.  If you love Spongebob, expect the same silly fun that he's always been known to produce.  My daughter and myself have watched this film numerous times, and we'll probably watch for quite some time.  It is definitely worthy of purchase.

You have to admit that, with questions about his sexuality afoot as of late, Spongebob has managed to keep his icon status in check.  Hopefully he'll be around for a long time to come.",1110153600,2,1278,5.023809523809524

1600419,4,B00005JN55,"First off, I took my 5 and 7-year-old daughters to see this. Of course, being a 39-year-old kid at heart, I love Spongebob as well and I had to go see this in the theatres.

It was excellent and this DVD is just as great. To make a long story short, Spongebob and Patrick have to go and find Neptune's crown, which was stolen by the nefarious Plankton and sold to someone who lives in a place called Shell City.

The overall story follows Spongebob and Patrick's journey which proves one thing: even though Spongebob and Patrick are kids at heart and everyone looks at them that way, they prove that even with a child's inner soul, a person can overcome various obstacles and prove their worth. It's basically a coming-of-age for Spongebob and Patrick.

In this case, Spongebob and Patrick show that they can make it to Shell City and recover the crown. On the way, they have to endure torture from a ""biker bar"" by not singing the ""Goofy Goober"" song which would make anybody with a child's soul break out in song (well, in the movie at least!) as well as enduring a giant frog fish that tempts them with an old lady selling ice cream. They also have to contend with Dennis, a bounty hunter hired by Plankton to take our heros out, as well as the dreaded Cyclops.

The movie is hilarious and has so many jokes for the adult and child in all of us and none of it is really so bad that it isn't appropriate for kids.

The special features have interviews with the creator, Stephen Hillenburg, as well as the people who provide the voices. It was amazing to see who did the voices of everyone. I was surprised by the amount of star talent that provide the voices to the TV series and the movie. For example:

Clancy Brown - Victor Kruger/The Kurgan from the first Highlander movie does Mr. Krabs

Bill Fagerbakke - He does the voice of Patrick Star. He played Tom Cullen in the TV miniseries The Stand, and played Michael 'Dauber' Dybinski on the TV Series Coach.

Alec Baldwin does the voice of Dennis, the bounty hunter

The special features on the disc include a 20-minute featurette interviewing Stephen Hillenburg and many of the voice talents. It  goes over how Mr. Hillenburg came about creating Spongebob when he was scuba diving one day.

There are a few other special features, including one where Hillenburg talks with Jean Michel Cousteau on life in the sea and the different forms of life that Hillenburg used as characters in Spongebob. It's funny and informative that even kids should enjoy it, learning about the sea life that is prevalant in our world and how it needs to be saved.

Overall, this movie is enjoyable. At times, it's not as funny as the TV series, but it's still enjoyable to watch and have a good time.",1109808000,,2733,4.498989898989899
1600420,4,B00005JN55,"The controversy over SpongeBob's sexual orientation has been quite absorbing but nowhere near as involving as this very funny movie based on the popular TV series on Nickelodeon. Just in case you've been living under a rock for the last five years, SpongeBob, Patrick, Sandy, Mr. Krabs and all the residents of Bikini Bottom have become the most hip (and funny) half hour this side of ""The Simpsons"". More importantly, it's a program that almost all family members can watch without becoming offended (well, except for those folks wondering about SpongeBob's sexuality). It's a fun way to spend an hour and a half with the kids. After losing a treasured promotion to manage the Krusty Krab 2 restaurant because he's just a kid, SpongeBob is the only person who can stop Plankton from taking over Bikini Bottom. Plankton resorts to Plan Z (having used every other plan in the alphabet) to frame Mr. Krabs for the theft of King Neptune's crown. The diminutive Plankton hopes to discover the secret to the Krabby Patty and ultimately rule the undersea world!  Meanwhile, Spongebob and his dim witted friend Patrick must travel to the dreaded Shell City to recover the King's crown and stop Plankton before it's too late.

Featuring a marvelous cast of guest voices including Jeffrey Tambor (""Arrested Development""), Scarlet Johansson (""Lost in Translation""), Clancy Brown (""The Shawshank Redemption""), Alec Baldwin and, of all people, David Hasselhoff, the film may lack the sparkle of the best episodes of the series but it more than makes up for this shortcoming with a number of witty gags. Kids will enjoy the antics of SpongeBob and Patrick while adult males will empathize King Neptune's attempts to hide his bald spot with his crown (he's desperate enough to resort to Hair in a Can at one point although that doesn't quite work out as planned) and envy David Hasselhoff as he uses his pecs to launch the duo back into the sea. There's also a serious message as Mindy the King's daughter encourages SpongeBob and Patrick to be kids and be OK with it.

Featuring a great transfer with bright and vivid colors, Bikini Bottom has never looked so, well, animated. A very sharp transfer with few digital artifacts to distract viewers from the absurd images, ""Spongebob"" looks better than any sponge has a right to. The 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround mix is used to good and sometimes very comic effect.

The 20 minute animatic segment gives viewers a peak into all the preparation work that went into producing the movie. Director Hillenburg's comments provide interesting and sometimes funny insights into the challenge of producing a movie much less a TV series as funny as this. The behind-the-scenes featurette is both charming and quite funny with a glimpse into everything from creating the absurd story at the heart of this film to the hilarious recording sessions featuring the voice cast. There's also a featurette The ""THQ"" game demo is actually quite fun but doesn't really provide that much of a taste as to what the game could do. The Case of Sponge ""Bob""  features Jean-Michel Cousteau in a tongue-in-cheek short documentary. We see an informative and fun discussion of real sponges with undersea footage narrated by Cousteau with writer/director Hillenburg. ""Saving the Surf"" features Chad Nelsen, Matt McClain and Steve Pezman founders of the Surfrider Foundation discussing the importance of keeping our environment clean and the impact of our pollution on the ocean and our beaches. The teaser trailer for ""Submarine"" features footage of ""Das Boot"", ""U571"" and ""The Hunt for Red October"" intercut with footage created for the cartoon trailer for ""The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie"". There's also previews for other Paramount family friendly titles as well.

A funny visit with the denizens of the deep, ""The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie"" will keep you and the kids entertained. The film doesn't pander to kids and has just the right level of slapstick humor to keep adults entertained as well. Although it does have a serious message at its core, the film is a lot of fun.",1109721600,19,4082,4.995588235294117
1600491,4,B00005JN55,"It seems that the creative people behind Spongebob Squarepants created the feature length film instead of creating a seasons worth of cartoons. I would have preferred the season. There are far more laughs in each of the season one and two DVD collections than in this 80 minute film. In fact through the entire film I only laughed out loud twice.

The Nickelodeon cartoons are more geared towards throwing out rapid jokes for ten minutes whereas the film takes a slower more methodical pace. As the voice actor of Spongebob said the film is more of a road trip. It's about Spongebob's growth as he travels to Shell City to find and return Neptune's crown. In the end Spongebob gains the confidence to become a, uh, laser wielding rock star?!?

Ok, the opening is slow the ending is weak but I still enjoyed the film enough to buy it the first day it came out. If you're a Spongebob fan you'll likely enjoy the film, just don't set your expectations too high or you may find yourself disappointed.",1109721600,5,996,4.589887640449438
1600492,5,B00005JN55,"I LOVE Spongebob Squarepants, but even I will admit that every so often they make an episode that doesn't quite measure up to the show's usual quality. And judging by past cartoon movies, I had the feeling that this one would be basically lame, unfunny, and uncreative, with one mediocre joke after another like a couple of episodes strung together...and not something you'd want to watch again. I'm glad to say my preconceptions were totally wrong and blown out of the water--pardon the pun--by the actual film itself!

Spoilers here, so beware. It began with a pirate crew sailing their ship, partying joyfully on their way to see the Spongebob movie. The film itself had a pleasingly coherent, original plot, not the rehashed and tediously assembled excuse for a plot I expected it to have. Mindy was a rather cute mermaid (but the best part of her was Patrick drooling over her and saying, ""She's perdy, Spongebob!"" and ""You're hot!"") King Neptune was not the same god Neptune from the series, but I suppose that was intentional. (Maybe the god should have been labeled as Poseidon or something?) Anyway, I found myself and my brother getting far more laughs out of this movie than I thought we would. The Goofy Goober song, the Thug Tug, the frogfish with a luring tongue shaped like an old lady selling ice cream, the Shell City giftshop in which the dried-out sealife is revived by Spongebob and Patrick, the heroes, and avenges themselves on the evil diver, the ride back to Bikini Bottom on David Hasselhoff...it all adds up to a very pleasing film. Sandy has perhaps the most disappointingly small role. Squidward, Mr. Krabbs, and of course the plan Z-enacting Plankton and his computer wife Karen make their appearances and are at nothing less than their best.

Spongebob's movie has some truly great moments and lines in it; many of the best expressions I've ever seen on the characters' faces were used here, and many of the jokes are genuinely hilarious. Yes, most of the humor is pretty silly and childish, but that is part of the charm (and the meaning) of the film.

In the great tradition of wonderful undersea films of late like ""Finding Nemo"" and ""Shark Tale,"" this movie carries its message about respecting ocean life and the DVD special features include a fantastic featurette with Jean-Michel Cousteau and Stephen Hillenburg (as well as most of the voice actors.) You'll find out things you didn't know (Squidward's an octopus, man) and hear from the people who made the show. This movie is a fine and surprising example of how Nickelodeon can really make a good cartoon into a good film if they actually have a great idea to begin with and they give it their all.",1109635200,4,2688,4.763948497854077

I really hoped to enjoy this film when I heard that it was coming out. I have been a big fan of the show nearly since it started, and there was no doubt I was going to see this.

November 19th came, and it was time for the movie. My friend and I went with his little brother and sister. We watched the film with high expectations (not always a good thing, I know), and we all loved it! The characters were great, the humor from the show is more present than most of the new episodes, and it is a flat-out great movie for the fans.

Many people have complained that the humor is a little too grown-up for the kids, and is considerably crude at times. Obviously they must not watch the show, considering the humor is as blatantly obvious in the show as it is in the movie. Some of the jokes in the film, I highly doubt little kids would understand, anyways.

This film was definitely an enjoyment for me, from start to finish. It had great moments of humor, both crude and clean, and even had some bit parts that were sad (wait until the 'Shell City' scene).

I heard a bunch of complaints that the plot didn't have the charisma of the TV episodes and wasn't fast-paced enough. I can't imagine how much more excitement could have been packed into this film, though. If the movie didn't have some absurdity, all the characters would be tied too heavily to the main plot and not able to experience their antics that are the essence of Spongebob Squarepants (such as hilarious obstacles and sporadic musical numbers). The wacky ending captivated kids' attention and made moviegoers over 18 burst into gales of laughter.

You can tell that every show worker had so much fun creating this film. The characters' facial expressions look even more over-the-top than on the show, and the voice acting of Tom Kenny, Bill Fagerbakke, and many others is perfect. Plus, David Hasselhoff was a real sport to do that cameo. The backgrounds and scenery are beautifully done (under the art direction of Mr. Nick Jennings, I assume).

So Neptune tries to kill Krabs but then he sends Spongebob and Patrick on a mission to get it or else Mr. Krabs gets it if they don't make the deadline. Planton sends a assassin named Dennis, voiced by Alec Baldwin, whos hot on their trail. Spongebob and Patrick go on a journey to Shell City where the crown is. Yes, we all know its nothing like the TV Show but hey, its a kids movie and Spongebob is a kooky character. I have a brother and sister so Spongebob is a regular thing to them..so Im not ashamed of liking Spongebob..he's cool in my book. Jeffrey Tambor voices King Neptune and Scarlett Johanssen voices Neptune's daughter. Also starring David Hasselhoff as himself...just wrong. If you stay till the end of the credits it zooms back to the pirates in the thearte and the usher girl is asking them to leave..funny",1106870400,2,2069,4.702479338842975
1600542,4,B00005JN55,"""The SpongeBob Sqarepants Movie"" is an incredibly cute and funny film with some hilarious inside jokes and a message that is not preachy, a rare find for a kids movie. The big problem with ""SpongeBob"" is that the plot is way too generic. It feels used and dirty, like it's been used a few too many times before finally coming to this movie. I believe that it would have worked much better without a plot. Just like the TV show. I always thought of the television series as the underwater, animated ""Seinfeld"". I liked the down moments were the plot was not being referenced alot more than the plot driven moments. There is one other quibble that I have about this film. It is that Sandy (the squirrel), and Gary (the cat-snail), are hardly in it. Sandy is seen once in the middle, saying something that is intelligible. But that is it for the bad things that I have to say about this otherwise hilarious and thoughtful movie. The things people are saying is that this movie makes SpongeBob look gay, and that he is promoting an alternative life style. Wait a minute! He is not a homosexual! I don't know were people get that, from his voice or the way he acts, but that is incredibly stereotypical. What are people ging to say next? Mr. Incredible promotes steroid use? I think that if the Christian's are picking on this movie, a KIDS film, they should at least acknowledge the gratuitous violence in ""The Passion Of The Christ"". The prime audience of this film may be off just a bit. Although it is marketed as a kids movie, it may be more for adults, as some of the humor is a bit more sophisticated. As it may not be as sophisticated as, say, ""Sideways"" or ""The Life Aquatic"" (both great, by the by), this movie has more references to older movies and TV shows (I dare you to look for the lone ranger parody, and the KISS comics parody towards the end), and less fart and vomit humor. None, actually, except for the opening scene. I enjoyed the subtelties and the sophisticated humor, but the stuff that goes over kids heads causes fidgets and mad adults in the seat behind or in front of them. The kids that go to this movie should be mature and old enough not to kick seats. Right there it makes you wih that the movie was called ""Seed Of SpongeBob"".

The plot revolves around one SpongeBob Sqarepants (expertely voiced by Tom Kenny) and his friend Patrick. SpongeBob works at the Krusty Krab, and hopes to be named manager of the Krusty Krab 2. However, he is beaten out b Sqidward Tentacles (Rodger Bumpass). All torn up, SB and Patrick get drunk off of Gooberberry Sunrises at the duos' favorite establishment, the Goofy Goober Ice Cream Shop. Meanwhile, Plankton, the evil little green guy, is plotting to take over Bikini Bottom, the creatures city of residence, and to open an establishment of his inferior version of the Krusty Krab, the Chum Bucket, all over the city. In order to do this, he steals King Neptune's crown. His daughter Mindy (Scarlett Johannson), helps SB and Patrick go and retrieve it. All the while, they are chased by a series of dangerous things, most notably a hitman nmaed Dennis (Alec Baldwin), whom has been hired by Plankton to kill the pair. I guess that it is important to say that King Neptune accused Mr. Krabs of stealing his crown, and gives the two five days to get it back and prove Krabs innocent, or Mr. Krabs will be executed.

So that's it in terms of plot and execution (no pun intended). The rest is all a series of vignettes puncuated by a plot point every several minutes. But this is a truly wonderful and fairly original movie. Go into it with an open min, and enjoy it for what it is.

1600585,3,B00005JN55,"I took my two children (girls 5 & 7) to see this movie today.  The 5 year old loved it.  The 7 year old and I couldn't wait to get out of the theatre.  My observation is that if you already love SpongeBob, Patrick, et al., you are likely to enjoy the movie.  Otherwise, this film is not likely to appeal to you.

I doubt that this movie will win many new fans for SpongeBob.  There were only a handfull of people in the theatre - at a matinee during winter break.  The plot was not enticing, and the characters have one or two ""tricks"" that become tiresome quickly.  The cast of characters, who may be fine in small doses for the casual fan, drove me crazy after a few scenes.

One cute aspect were the scenes in which the cartoon characters ""interact"" with real people.  Those actually caught my attention.

So, if you feel confident that you really like Bob and crew, this movie may be a good choice for you.  Otherwise, approach with caution.",1104105600,,945,4.306818181818182
1600586,3,B00005JN55,"I have to admit being more than a little disappointed by the SpongeBob Squarepants Movie. Having been a big fan of the series, it took me a bit to figure out what was ""wrong"" with the movie. The idea raised by others that the movie is less ""dense"" than the TV show is part of it, but I think it also had to do with the tone of the movie, which, for whatever reason, was darker and more plot-driven than the series ever was. Personally, I would have liked to have seen the movie go in exactly the opposite direction--less plot, more zany. The decision to, in essence, limit the story to SpongeBob and Patrick was probably the single biggest flaw--it made for a more coherent (relatively speaking!) story, but it limited the wackiness. Squidward's presence as a foil for SpongeBob was sorely missed--you sort of need the ""adult,"" cynical presence around to counterbalance SpongeBob's optimism and manic energy. Still, there were a few laugh-out-loud moments, and the kids seemed to like it OK. A fair effort overall, but surely not equal to even an average episode of the TV series.",1103673600,,1080,4.659685863874346

1600615,3,B00005JN55,"There are a few nearly hysterical lines in Spongebob Squarepants, ""Spongebob, she's hot."" being about the best (just wait until it's in context, you'll get it.)Unfortunately there's about two other laugh out loud moments in 88minutes, the rest is just nautical nonsense.

The film opens episodically with very little sense of direction or plot. The scenes are trying to set up an emotional center, Spongebob being upset about not being promoted to manager of the Krusty Krab 2, wanting to be a man not a boy (a theme explored in the show when Spongebob had a lipstick kiss from his grandma.)Unfortunately Spongebob is way to shallow here to really gain any ground developmentally.

When Planktin steals King Triton's Crown and frames Mr. Krabs for it (should have been hysterical, but was so predictable not even the kids giggled) Krabs is left frozen solid and Spongebob with six days (rather than two weeks, thank you Patrick)to recover it from the Cyclops of Shell City.

From there the movie drags into a long, unsatisfying journey to the ass of David Hasslehoff (a wasted cameo, too disgusting and grotesque to be funny and I like disgusting and grotesque -- see, Evil Dead --) There's also a hit man, sent by Plankton, to stop them as uses chum buckets to enslave the Bikini Bottom dwellers.

Key Characters, Sandy, Mrs. Puff, Squidward are mostly left out of the film (what a shame, Sandy would have added a lot to the little quest portion of the movie.) And wasted, dismally, is Scarlet Johansson as Tritons daughter (""wow, you're pretty..."") What's truly lacking is any real attempt from Spongebob to do anything he doesn't have to. The entire journey is one of desperation and dumb luck but not played to either laughs or drama (remember how Shrek, Monsters Inc, The Incredibles do both???)

So lacking in plot, character depth and humor does the film at leas boast some great hand drawn animation for the big screen? No. This is just an 88min episode that looks no better than the TV Show. Nick has really dropped the ball since Rugrats and Jimmy Neutron, Thornberries, Rugrats go Wild and Spongebob are all unimaginative cookie cutter films lacking anything you can't get from the regular show.

There's a reason to go to the movies, a reason to want to see characters normally in 15 minute plots get an hour and a half, but Spongebob Squarepants leaves out most of them. In the end it will breeze over you and other than some really nasty CGI work on Hasslehoff you'll leave not feeling queasy, but you won't bring anything positive with you either, just an idea that it was, well, okay.",1102896000,,2600,4.766666666666667
1600616,1,B00005JN55,"As with every Nick movie from 2002 onwards, this movie is rated PG. However, some countries, like the U.K. for example, has a G equivalent. Come on! We hardly get to see G rated movie in theaters anymore! There are lots of PG movies for families that are innocent and don't deserve a high rating. Maybe it's just a filthy trick for the MPAA to encourage children to read a book or play a sport? B***S**T! I like movies, and kids like movies. I don't it when parents worry. Please, MPAA? Let our country's children see a stinkin' movie, will ya?",1102809600,3,544,4.396039603960396
1600617,5,B00005JN55,"I can remember as a youngster sitting around the TV with mom and dad and watching ""our shows"" together, like the Carol Burnett show, in the 1970s.  Now that I'm a daddy myself, ""SpongeBob SquarePants"" provides the same common experience, although sometimes it's hard to swallow your dinner while laughing so hard we all spew food particles around the room.

We were thrilled to find out the movie was coming out.  That explains why there have been no new episodes on TV for so long; they've been busy elsewhere.  And it works!  Despite a couple of negative reviews I see here, any sponge fan would have to be in a truly bum mood to not enjoy this flick.  The problems in translating a small-screen show to the big screen are usually that the characters are overly stretched, the story doesn't ring true to what we're used to, or the filmmakers don't have a clue how to turn from the short format to a 90-minute story.  I'm pleased to say that none of these things are a problem here, and that the whole thing holds up beautifully in the theater.

The story, as you've probably heard by now, involves Plankton's latest attempt to take over the world.  The big news for fans is that he finally gets Mr. Krabs' recipe for Krabby Patties!  Guest star Jeffrey Tambor (King Neptune) unwittingly allows Plankton access to the secret recipe when he believes Mr. Krabs has stolen his crown, freezes him until SpongeBob and Patrick can get the crown back, and while the Krusty Krab is shut down the little megalomaniac sneaks in and steals the recipe, making the Chum Bucket a success at long last.  What happens then, and to SpongeBob & Patrick on their journey, is what the story revolves around, and it's every bit as good as any episode of the show I've seen, and I think I've seen them all at least once (many of them two or even three times).  Hey, this is the 21st Century version of the Looney Tunes, they're that good and that much worth rewatching.

Funny?  Check.  45-year-old dad, 41-year-old mom, and 7-year-old daughter laughed almost nonstop from beginning to end.  This little guy is my hero:  He's irrepressibly cheery, loves to serve his fellow creatures, is remarkably thankful for his thankless job in the fast food industry, and refuses to see the bad side of people.  If more of us humans were as naive as this glorious little sponge, the world truly would be a better place.  Well, at least a much funnier place.  Now it'll be interesting to see if the story turns in the film are made part of the story lines in the TV show when new episodes come along!",1102723200,11,2567,4.55119825708061
1600618,5,B00005JN55,"My 10 year old daughter and I loved this movie so much we saw it twice. We're big Spongbob fans, though. I thought the whole movie was cute and funny.

It would have been nice to see more of some of the other characters(Sandy, Gary, Mrs. Puff), but I guess they didn't really fit into the story. Maybe next time.",1102377600,2,312,4.2
1600619,2,B00005JN55,"Maybe two stars is too low, I kind of averaged out what my three year old thought of it and what I thought of it.

I took my above forementioned three year old, actually she's three and a half and quite ahead of her years, but that's going off the subject so never mind, I took her and her nine year old cousin to the theater to see this, and they both liked it.

Now my daughter likes movies, perhaps more than most her age, and her tastes range from the standard Disney classics to Spider Man to some of the LOTR (I won't let her watch the really scary parts) and even some odd ball stuff like the battle sequence in the Incredible Flop, I mean Hulk, movie.  Anyway, back to the subject at hand, I don't have television at my house, I think it's a tool of satan, personally, but my ex likes cable so my child was, at some point in time, exposed to Sponge Bob.

When I first found out, I sort of cringed, I mean, I figured there had to be something mentally wrong with someone that would create a cartoon character out of a sponge, but, who am I to say what peoples tastes are?  So my kid likes this Sponge Bob dude, okay, worse things could happen.

I'd never really watched the cartoon before going to see this flick, except for a few minutes here and there, so I was hoping maybe I'd figure out the draw.  I didn't really, except to maybe theorize that the extremely loud and obnoxious dialogue and the extremely loud and obnoxious drawing style of the cartoons is such a stimulus to kids that they just can't help themselves.

In one scene in this flick, the character Patrick is dancing around in fish net stockings.  He is supposed to be a kid, or at least, just a young man, so I guess the humor here is supposed to be aimed at adults, but for me, I just found it stupid.

The movie Team America was truly funny and filled with adult humor, it wasn't aimed at kids, it was rated R, etc.  This flick entertains kids because they don't care what's going on, don't care what the stupid jokes are and just get so engaged in the loudness of it all they eat it up like candy, okay, but I didn't care for it at all, but, on the other hand, I had a nice evening out with two beautiful young ladies and, that, in itself, is priceless, so heck, just because I thought it was dumb movie doesn't mean I'm not recommending it, I'm just saying, you'd better be going for someone else's pleasure, unless you like really stupid humor.",1102118400,,2426,4.218142548596112
1600620,5,B00005JN55,"The criticisms I've found here seem to mostly be attacking the simple and often stupid humor; the ""grown up"" jokes; and the lack of any really cinematic scale here.  And while these criticisms are mostly pretty legitimate, I think if you're focusing on these you're missing the point.  Steve Hillenburg made a stupendously stupid movie because that's exactly what he wanted to do, and that's what Spongebob is all about.  The lesson which Spongebob and Patrick come to at the end is the same one presented to the audience.  It's okay for Spongebob and Patrick to be kids because that's who they are, and they can't change that with seaweed mustaches.  At the same time it's okay for us to be kids along with them and enjoy all of their idiotic antics because that's a part of us as well.  If you're just taking your kids, well, I don't think you're approaching the film right.  They'll probably enjoy it (though a lot of the humor will evade them), but the simple fact is that the movie is meant to make adults into kids.

For Spongebob veterans, I should warn that the film seems to meander a lot more than any of the episodes, inasmuch as the story is for the most part pretty unfocused.  The animation is also worth noting, since it seems to be a step BACK from the clean, bright look of the later episodes and instead a return to the milder (and, to me, more charming) look of the earlier ones.  Fans of Rocko will be happy to find a sequence very reminiscient of Filburt's bachelor party.

In any case, I enjoyed the film immensely.  It's really admirable to me what the Spongebob crew has managed to do; and if all you can do is compare it to other animated films, well, you're missing the point.  Spongebob is a piece of childhood for those of us who are still children inside.",1101600000,6,1784,4.469135802469136
1600621,4,B00005JN55,"Okay, maybe my hopes were a bit high, but I thought Spongebob was going to be one of those rare feature-length NickToons that I'd actually love.  While it beats ""Jimmy Neutron"" or something like ""RugRats"" or ""Wild Thornberrys"", it's still hard to banich the idea that plagues all of those movies - that they didn't exactly develop a movie-length plot to go with the script.  I liked ""SpongeBob"", but the movie gets more mileage out of his charm than the fact that it's a movie, and even my kids were visibly disappointed (my 7 year old insisting she saw the funniest parts on internet trailers).

The story - Spongebob gets a nasty surprise when he's NOT picked to manage the new Krusty Krab opened up by his boss, the money-hungry Mr. Krab.  In the hopping sea-scape of ""Bikini Bottom"", where life is care-free, Spongebob wants nothing more than to prove he's man enough to run Krab's new restaurant (located conveniently next door to the old one).  Unfortunately, Plankton - Krab's nemesis - has a plan to steal the formula to the ""Krabby Patty"", Krab's secret recipe, as part of his larger plan of world domination.  Though embittered at Krab for not getting the top job, will Spongebob put it aside and save Krab's restaurant?  Worse, as part of his evil plan, Plankton frames Krab for stealing the crown of King Neptune.  The King is sensitive about his crown, both because it is a symbol of his power and because it covers a nasty bald spot.  Persuaded by his spunky daughter Mindy (Scarlet Johanson), the enraged Kind gives Spongebob and his trusty if dim friend Patrick 10 days to find the crown (Patrick bargains it down to 6).  Along the way, Patrick and Spongebob share many adventures, and learn to find their inner strength as they battle biker-fish, hatchet fish (bearing ice-cream sundaes), an assasin fish sent by Plankton and the compulsion to dance like a baby whenever somebody plays the ""Goofy Goober"" song.

Like I said, it was fun, but no laugh riot - not even for my 7 and 5 year old.  Neither knew who David Hasselhoff was (though I appreciated the joke); My normally brave 5 year old had to be taken out at one scene (the ice-cream bearing hatchet fish scared him to tears).  he was okay for the rest of the flick, but everybody came out feeling as if they missed something.",1101513600,6,2299,4.6330049261083746
1600622,4,B00005JN55,"I saw this movie earlier tonight with a friend, and both of us being fans on the show, we expected the same silly, slapstick humor that so often gived us the giggles. Well, we went to the latest showing (10:35), so there was only my friend and I and maybe three other groups of two people in the theater, so I'd say about 8-10 total. So the movie starts in the above sea world, which as fans who watch the show will know isn't cartoon-y (only BELOW the sea is cartoon), and we see a bunch of pirates singing an altered version of the theme song. This whole scene was kinda hokey (even for Spongebob) and pretty unfunny, but then we finally go underwater, thus go into the cartooniness. It's still pretty bland, that is until Patrick comes in about 10 minutes into the film. After that, the movie just seemed to be more entertaining. Patrick makes everything better.

Anyway, the story is of Planton, still jealous of Mr. Krabs and his Krusty Krabs resturant making all that money tha could be his, finding out he had a Plan Z after all (if you wanna get it, go see the movie). This plan is to steal King Neptune's crown and frame Mr. Krabs, which would anger Neptune, causing him to come after Krabs, an if Planton's lucky, kill him, giving Planton leeway to break into the Krusty Krab and steal the resturant's Krabby Patty secret formula. Well, he does steal Neptune's crown, so Neptune comes to Mr. Krabs and is just about to kill him, that is, before Spongebob interferes. It turns out Planton hide Neptune's crown in a far away forbidden place, a place with monsters and a evil fish eating cyclops. Neptune agrees to give Spongebob and Patrick 6 days to find his crown, and if they don't, Krabs will die. A rather silly plot when you think about it...but you're in Bikini Bottom now.

This movie, for the most part, is pretty entertaining, for kids and adults. I'm 14, and my friend and I both enjoyed it very much. There's the humor for the kids, then there's the humor for the adults (not explicit humor or anything like that though), and then there's just the humor that anyone can like. There were several parts where my friend and I were on the verge of tears...it's just a hilarious movie. Patrick of course gives the most laughs, with his odd facial expressions and constant stupidity.

I don't recommend this movie to people without much of a sense of humor...you won't like it. This humor is completely childish and offbeat. But if you like silly stuff, you'll absolutely love this movie, no matter how old you are. And the battle scene between Spongebob, Patrick and the bounty hunter Dennis on the back of a swimming David Hasselhoff is a must see.",1101513600,5,2664,4.522821576763485
1600673,5,B00005JN55,"Before I start this reveiw, DO NOT see this movie if you  aren't the type of person who likes kooky and offbeat humor. This  movie is not for you. If you are a fan of the show, like comedy, in the mood for a laugh, or just  don't want to be bothered with a plot, this movie is for you.

The movie keeps the same type of humor found in the show, though with less of  the adult jokes. Just the same, the jokes are funny, and you will definnetly laugh at least once at this movie. Patrick is the source of most of the humor in the movie.

In the movie, Plankton frames Mr. Krabs for stealing King Neptunes crown. Neptune is going to exucute Mr. Krabs, but Spongebob makes him an offer. If he and Patrick can get the crown back in six days, he will spare Krabs. So  off the two go in the Patty Wagon, to Shell City to retrieve the crown. In their absence, Plankto hires a hitman Dennis (Alec Baldwin) to kill the dou with his giant spiked boot. With everyone out of the way, Plankton steals the kraby ptty formula, and put in acton his PLAN Z to take over Bikini Bottom.

The movie has plenty of stars and new characters such as Dennis, Mindy (Neptune's daughter voiced by Scarlett Johansen) and Neptune (Jeffrey Tambor)and David Hasslehoff, as himself.

1600674,4,B00005JN55,"I've only seen a few episodes of ""Spongebob Squarepants,"" but that didn't stop me from seeing the movie. This is one of those movies that you just can't hate, because it's so harmless, and Spongebob is just so likeable. It's not the greatest animated movie ever, but it has it's funny moments, and is very enjoyable. This is a good movie. It's done with the traditional hand-drawn animation, like ""Home on the Range,"" and ""Brother Bear."" I do like computer generated image alot better, but this is the original, and Spongebob isn't that kind of cartoon, like ""Jimmy Neutron."" The movie is always for children though, because there are some PG-13 rated jokes for the adults, but Spongebob is such an innocent character, that just his laugh will make you smile. Some of the supporting characters are more A-List actors. You got Alec Baldwin as Dennis, Scarlet Johannson as Mindy, and Jeffroy Tambor as King Neptune, and I love how they included real life scenes in the movie. In the beginning, pirates find a chest that contain tickets to ""The Spongebob Squarepants Movie,"" so it's a movie within a movie siutation. Every now and then we see the pirates watching the movie, laughing at the funny scenes, and crying at the sad. There is also an appearance by David Hassolhof, who starred in ""Baywatch"" and now he is just always poking fun at himself. I don't know how many times I've seen the slow-motion running, ala ""Baywatch,"" and this time it's nice to see an actual star of the show making fun of it. I did feel bad for him during the scene where he squeezes Spongebob through his pectoral muscles to rocket him back underwater. That was just kind of mean.

The movie is about Spongebob Squarepants, and talking sponge that lives in a pineapple under the sea. His neighbor, and fellow co-worker, is Squidward, and his star-fish friend Patrick is anything by smart. Him and Squidward work for Mr. Eugene Krab at the Krusty Krab. It't a fast food restaurant that is famous for the Krabby Patty. Spongebob believes that he will be promoted from fry cook to manager at the new opening of the Krusty Krab 2. When he picks Squidward, Spongebob is angry at him, and him and Patrick go eating ice cream all night that leaves them hung over the new day. Across the street from the Krusty Krab is the Chum Bucket, run by the tiny Plankton, who wants to steal the Krabby Patty recipe, so he could sell them. He has gone through plans A-Y, and they have all failed, so now it's time to resort to. . .Plan Z! He steals King Neptunes famed crown, and then write a note saying that Krab took it. King Neptune freezes Krab, and Spongebob and Patrick go on a journey to get the crown back, and they only have six days, but Plankton does get the recipe. King Neptunes kind-hearted daughter Mindy is always trying to convince her father to give them more time, but Neptune doesn't listen. He even wears a bag over his head to cover the bald spot that his crown usually covered. Plankton finds out that Spongebob and Patrick are trying to get the crown back, so he hires Dennis, a cowboy like killer with blades on his boots, and Spongebob and Patrick go on their quest to save Mr. Krabs and get the crown back.

When I went to see the movie, these four adults were having their own listen coversation throughout the entire movie, and I was guessing that their kids were up front. At one part, one of them said that this was a sick cartoon, and I could see what they mean. There is one scene where Patrick has long legs and fishnet stockings on, during a mock music video. They get a bag of wind in one scene, and towards the end Patrick says that he's got the bag, and he turns around, and there is a bulge in his pants, but he has the bag of wind in his hand, and of course the David Hassalhof pec joke. The movie does go for some jokes for the adults, but they really do go to the extreme sometimes. There was another scene where Spongebob and Patrick are under a real intense, hot light and they dry out. I think it's hilarious that they used a real sponge, and a real star as them dried out, but I didn't find it funny when the adults next to me were joking, hoping that he was dead, and the movie was over. Don't let the fact that this is a kids show ruin the movie, because it's anything but sometimes. After all, Spongebob has many adult fans, and college kid fans, and he's universal. ""The Spongebob Squarepants Movie"" is a fun way to spend an hour and a half of your time, but I don't see it winning an Oscar next year. If you want to see a more developed animated movie, see ""The Polar Express,"" or ""The Incredibles,"" both five star movies and computer generated image, but if you want to see something to laugh, have fun, and escape for an hour and a half, see ""The Spongebob Squarepants Movie."" It's too harmless to dislike.

ENJOY!

The premise is this: Plankton steals King Neptune's crown and frames Mr. Crabs for the robbery, Spongebob (whose recently been passed over for a promotion by Crabs) and Patrick decide to travel to Shell City to get back the King's crown before Mr. Crabs is fried. The entire Goofy Goober scene is hilarious with Patrick and Spongebob getting ""drunk"" on ice cream sundaes. The part in the tough-guy bar is also really funny when the locals are trying to figure out who blew a bubble. There are a number of guest voices and appearances including Alec Baldwin (Dennis) and David Hasselhoff. The end of the film is great with Spongebob rocking out to a ""Twisted Sister"" like song and saving the day. The only thing that was somewhat amiss was the lack of Squidward throughout the film. Anyway, for Spongebob fans this is an absolute must-see and a good introduction to non-fans alike. Highly Recommended.",1101254400,,999,4.882352941176471
1600736,4,B00005JN55,"SpongeBob finally hits the big screen in this highly enjoyable story.  When SpongeBob is passed over for a promotion to manager of the Krusty Krab II, things start to go bad for the gang.  When King Neptune's crown disappears, and Mr. Krabs is framed all looks dark for Bikini Bottom.  Everyone's favorite sponge, SpongeBob SquarePants (Kenny) must embark upon a quest to find King Neptune's crown, save Mr. Krabs, and defeat Plankton's evil plan for world domination.  That sounds like a lot of work for a simple sponge, but he is aided by his sidekick, Patrick Star (Fagerbakke).

If you like the television show, you will not be disappointed by this big screen adventure.  SpongeBob comes to life with bright, vivid colors and a story that will provide laughs for both children and adults alike.  There is a mix of animation and live action sequences, and they work well together and fit the story perfectly.  ""The SpongeBob SquarePants"" is as good as any animated movie currently in theaters, and is well worth checking out.",1101254400,2,1028,4.867816091954023
1600737,3,B00005JN55,"Since the Rugrats movie debuted to much critical praise and several oscar nominations it was no surprise that Nickelodeon had struck gold. Their very own nick toons had become real competition to the Disney money machine. Children could fall in love with a television cartoon show and than beg their parents to take them to see it, or else. Unfortunately Rugrats seem to be the only real hit Nickelodeon had up their sleeves. Hey Arnold and the Wild Thornberry's were met with yawns, angry yawns. Where or where would their next hit come from? Little did they know, it would come from inside a pineapple under the sea.

The Spongebob Squarepants movie is the kind of movie that is wasted on kids. I saw it in a theatre with my girlfriend, surrounded by children. There were many moments where she and I were the only ones laughing out loud. Many of the real jokes simple went over the children's heads. The insanity of this cute cartoon was clearly missed by the parents of these kids. Where o' where were all these supposed college/stoner/goth fans I had heard so much about? Where ever they were I was clearly on my own in this theatre. Yet what a grand ol' time it was. The movie was exactly the kind of bafoonery I was expecting.

Spongebob and Patrick get drunk on ice cream and wake up with hang overs. They have a bubble party in a dirty club bathroom. They ride a giant crabby patty on their way to rescue king neptunes crown. They continue to sing a irritatingly funny Goofy Goober song through the movie. I don't know about you, but nothing is funnier or cooler than a climax that takes place entirely on the hairy back of David Hasselhoff.

Was this a perfect film? No. Where was Patchy the Pirate from the TV Show? Why didn't Sandy the Squirrel get ANY lines or screen time? Was she not paid enough nuts? Who knows but I wish they had been part of this major movie event. Two dimensional animation is still alive and well, and I'm happy that Hollywood can take notice thanks to this film's success. Spongebob is just down right loveable. He's optimistic, he's naive, he's oblivious to all the horror this world has to offer. When Plankton tells Spongebob of his plan to destroy Bikini Bottom with his WMD's. Spongebob smiles, wishes him luck, and continues on his way. Patrick, his even dumber best friend, is the yin to spongebob's yin. Unfortunately they are each missing a yang. These two best buddies make a brilliant comedic duo. Hopefully we can see them in more action/buddy pictures. If Rush Hour 3 needs two new stars, I will highly recommend these guys.

Go to the movies and have yourself a healthy good time. Laugh, smile, and pretend for one moment that we don't live in a messed up world. Even if for just 90 short minutes.

1600738,5,B00005JN55,"When I first saw the previews to the SpongeBob movie, I knew that it was going to be hilarious, and sure enough, it was more than just hilarious. This movie isn't just a extended cartoon, it's a whole nother SpongeBob SquarePants experience.

The storyline is in-depth and filled with the typical SpongeBob humor. The story: When Mr. Krabs opens up his new restaurant, The Krusty Krab 2, SpongeBob just can't wait to become the new manager. But instead of appointing SpongBob the new manager, Mr. Krabs appoints Squidward instead because he thinks that SpongeBob isn't mature enough to take on the job. But it's up to SpongeBob to save Mr. Krabs from King Neptune's wrath since Mr. Krabs has been wrongfully accused of stealing his crown. So he and Patrick set off on a dangerous journey to Shell City, where Neptune's crown is.

Go see this movie today, you will definitely get your money's worth.

1600739,4,B00005JN55,"this is a decent movie. I mean, the movie is ok, but if you haven't seen the show, you wouldn't know what is going on. I have watched the show avidly over the past 5 years it has been on tv and it is a damn good show because it has a offbeat sense of humor like predesscors before it, Ren and Stimpy and Rocko's Modern Life. It all starts off when Plankton steals the crown of King Neptune, He freezes Mr. Krabs because He thinks he did it but Spongebob says he didn't and sets off on a mission with the dimwitted star Patrick. They meet Neptune's daughter along the way and she helps them have the courage to be men instead of boys. I thought the movie was pretty funny but had some empty spaces where I was just chuckling and there were some not funny parts at all. I liked it, but with my friends, it was a other story. They thought it was weird. The general audience was Teenagers and kids with parents. This movie was good but not as good  as it was advertised.",1100908800,4,966,4.111111111111111
1600740,4,B00005JN55,"Relentlessly optimistic, drunk and defeated, man-child, sponge-man -- this movie  has it all.  Most of the parents in the audience didn't get it.  But I've been an outspoken SpongeBob fan for years.  Hell, I'll bet I like the television show even more than my children do -- and they like it a lot.

It's hard to describe this film, at least in a way that will do it justice.  Is it great?  In it's own twisted, surreal way, sure.  It's littered with double entendres, to be sure, and a few nautical butt cheeks, too.  I suppose the studio insisted on the latter.  The bottom line is that we need SpongeBob, maybe more than we ever did.  His good cheer in the face of disaster is downright inspirational.  Plus, he can blow bubbles with the best of them.

The evil villain, Plankton, speaks for all of us when he says, ""His chops are too righteous!""",1100908800,88,849,4.435064935064935
1600741,1,B00005JN55,"The Nickelodeon money machine has struck again.  By taking Spongebob off TV and making him a movie, Nickelodeon has done a disservice to those of us who have enjoyed Spongebob over the years.  This movie is ridiculous.  A story that would normally be given 11 minutes has been stretched into well over an hour of boredom.  None of the characters were further fleshed out and the jokes were few and far between.

Plankton has stolen Neptune's crown and pinned it on Mr. Krabbs.  It's Spongebob and Patrick to the rescue.  You would think some of the peripheral characters, like Sandy and Squidward would get more screen time, but no.  Just dull.  The worst episode is better than this movie.  Nick was just trying to get the Spongebob name on a marquee so they could cash in.",1100908800,10,774,4.625

1600801,4,B00005JN55,"After reading some negative reviews for this film, I was pleasantly surprised at how funny (with a touch of demented) this movie was.  When I see reviews stating things like ""Worst animated film of 2004"" I have to wonder if they were either a) a fan of the show and or b) at the same movie I was at.  Also to the reviewer who said ""I'd rather watch a 24/7 marathon of the Teletubbies""...I'd say, I dare ya!  I will say that I probably could've went my whole life without seeing Patrick in fishnet stockings, not to mention his bare necessities!

Spongebob the movie seemed like a 99 minute episode.  It has all the same goofy, zany, and downright strange humor of the half hour you watch on TV.  I thought that outside characters like Dennis (Alec Baldwin) and the real life David Hasslehoff would be dumb and they were, but in a good way.  I noticed in the audience tonight (opening night) there were mostly parents with their children, but there were also some couples like my 28 year old self who actually got my girlfriend to go with me (is that love or what?!).  I heard adults laughing more than kids many times.  I think that's Spongebob's appeal though, it's fun for kids, but some adults (especially fans of Ren & Stimpy or Beavis & Butthead) can crack up too.  I would go into the plot but...ok I will...

Spongebob and Patrick set out to find the crown of King Neptune, so he can thaw out Mr. Krabs who Neptune thinks stole it...still with me?  Good. So SB and ""Pat"" jump in their Krabby Patty mobile (complete with pickles for wheels) and embark on their quest.  Along the way they get help from Neptune's daughter Mindy who gives them a magic ""bag of wind"" and turns them into men by strategically placing seaweed on their faces as moustaches.  Meanwhile Plankton is up to no good and the evil Dennis is after SB & Patrick.  Luckily David Hasslehoff is there to save the day.  Makes sense to me!  I have to say that I couldn't help but laugh at the review complaining about the way SB & Patrick ate tons of ice cream sundaes and acted like they were drunk and had hangovers.  I thought it was hilarious and they weren't drinking, that's why it was funny.  To sum up, one review I read said that ""if you're a fan of the show you'll get what you paid for"".  Simply put, I agree.  Anyway, it's ""lemon scented""!",1100822400,15,2320,4.373831775700935

The scene could have easily been played with stomachaches.

Also, the movie features Patrick in black fishnet hose and stiletto heels- I kid you not!

My sons, fans of SpongeBob on TV, rarely laughed and pronounced it 'sorta OK'.  We all wished we'd seen someting else.  The story was contrived and not even clever.

Although it is true that the humor is less dense than in the TV show and some of the funny characters that liven up the TV show have little screen time in the film, Spongebob and Patrick are onscreen most of the time and up to their usual silliness. Adults and kids alike did laugh out loud during the film, and overall it was an enjoyable experience. Of course, like the TV show, some jokes were operating on different levels for kids and adults, which has always been one of the main assets of Spongebob. The film was not as great as the best of the TV episodes, but fun and entertaining nevertheless. Unlike some reviewers, we did not feel that we had wasted our time or been cheated and the 90 minutes passed quickly most of the time.
