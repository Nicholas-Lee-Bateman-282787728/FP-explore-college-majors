3566612,5,B001FB4VZI,"From the first pan of the Pie Hole, I was hooked.  The elegant visuals of this series are unparalleled in television.  I cannot think of another TV show in my decades of watching that has such a signature look; you could see stills and know immediately 'this has to be a Pushing Daisies set'.  When you add the clever repartee and endearing plot line and phenomenal acting, you get a show that is truly singular in its ability to delight.  I've never bought a season of any TV show, but I bought Pushing Daisies, and I'll wait eagerly for the release of Season 2.  The annoying part of this is that everyone I show it to gets hooked, only to be crestfallen to find that it was cancelled.  Oh, well, there's always The Bachelor.  Ugh, the networks are really striving for irrelevance, aren't they?!",1232323200,6,797,4.493055555555555
3566613,5,B001FB4VZI,"PUSHING DAISIES is no longer a part of the ABC schedule. [Update:  There are now rumors that ABC is finally going to show the remaining DAISIES episodes in late May or early June.  I have not heard whether the season finale will feature the original planned episode or the reedited one that will be included on the DVDs.]

Even though Amazon often makes it possible to review shows before the season has ended, I make it a personal policy to never write a review until the season has ended.  I'm making an exception for Season Two of PUSHING DAISIES simply because we don't know when or if ABC will air the final three episodes.  There is talk that they might show the last three episodes in a single night, but possibly as late as sometime during the summer of 2009.  Possibly not at all.

Time was when ABC was one of my favorite networks.  Along with NBC, I watched more of their series than any other network.  CBS has not had any shows that have interested me in a couple of decades and has become the network most opposed to Quality Television (a technical term for shows with specific qualities, none of which are possessed by CBS's entire schedule).  FOX has done some interesting shows, but such a huge percentage of them have been cancelled (though admittedly in the years before Kevin Reilly became head of programming -- so far in his two years FOX has a much better track record and it might even become my new favorite network, especially if they keep DOLLHOUSE and TERMINATOR: THE SARAH CONNOR CHRONICLES, my two favorite FOX series, going past this spring).  The CW apart from GOSSIP GIRL has yet to develop a single show that even remotely interests me, though the old WB series SMALLVILLE is a decent show that I've watched for years (and which is experiencing an unexpected resurgence in its 8th season, which will hopefully carry over with its now confirmed 9th season).  But ABC is not a station I look to with much hope.  I will admit that this could change if they eventually greenlight the series FABLES, based on Bill Willingham's great comic series about fairy tale characters living in New York in a neighborhood called Fabletown (though ironically, the target audience for the show would probably be fans of PUSHING DAISIES).  But even if FABLES turns out to be as great as it has the potential to be, I won't easily forget the anger I am feeling over PUSHING DAISIES.  Even as FOX has developed (and then not cancelled) several new interesting shows, I still an angered over FIREFLY, WONDERFALLS, DARK ANGEL, as well as several other series.

Canceling PUSHING DAISIES has almost overnight made me hate ABC more than I once did FOX.  The ratings were not good and it was an expensive show to make, but it was one of the greatest glories in the history of television.  It wasn't a show with universal appeal. Some people of good taste felt the pace was too intense (the only show ever made on TV with more words per minute was probably THE GILMORE GIRLS).  Some didn't like the narrator (though Jim Dale's narration for me was one of the glories of the show).  Some objected to the persistent fantastical tone, though for me it was one of the greatest TV fantasies ever.  I delighted in the neverceasing wordplay, the show's love of the English language (the only two shows I know that evinced as much love of the language as PUSHING DAISIES were THE GILMORE GIRLS and BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER).  And we had a group of characters I came to care about more and more.  Although I'm a serious student of television and have an almost embarrassing shows that I follow, PUSHING DAISIES was different.  I thought of Mondays as being only two days before the next PUSHING DAISIES.  And when Wednesday came around I had this thrill of anticipation, not unlike a small kid looking forward to a birthday party.  Something new and special was able to enter the landscape of my imagination.

I'm not very worried about the future of the cast members.  All of the performers have had success before and will again.  Kristin Chenoweth has already landed one of the leads in a new David Kelly show dealing with (what else?) a law firm.  Creator and executive producer Bryan Fuller has returned to HEROES, which NBC hopes he can breathe some life into the moribund and perhaps terminally ill series.  Anna Friel has some movies in the can and will probably return to England where she'll find a string of projects to work on.  Lee Pace will be in demand and Chi McBride is never going to be out of work for very long.  Eileen Greene and Swoozie Kurtz will both find new jobs, either on TV or on the stage.  But the extraordinary alchemy that resulted from their collaboration is gone.  I know that ultimately TV is a bottom line business.  But when a show is this extraordinary, doesn't any TV network have a moral responsibility to keep it alive.

It would be nice if perhaps the federal government could help by providing tax breaks to each network for keeping a couple of ratings-challenged shows alive simply because they are too good to let die.  Surely it isn't in the best interest of the American people or the human race to let a show like PUSHING DAISIES go away when it was producing television as good as we've ever seen in the history of the medium.  DAISIES was not merely good TV; it was exemplary TV, stretching the possibilities of what you can do much as other series did like BUFFY, THE SOPRANOS, and BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, or as MAD MEN is right now.  The only thing that benefits by this show going away is the ABC bottom line.  But how to measure the intense bitterness that they have created?  For PUSHING DAISIES was not a show that its fans took casually.  It was appointment television, viewing around which fans designed their evening.

Trying to look past my anger and my grief, I am profoundly grateful to Bryan Fuller and Barry Sonnenfeld (the latter was instrumental in not only directing several of the episodes, but creating the Shooting Bible that explained to other directors how to reproduce the unique PUSHING DAISIES look) for having created something so extraordinary.  I'm delighted that we at least got 22 episodes that are among the most physically beautiful in the history of TV.  While we did not get the conclusion of the stories, we did get a vivid introduction into their unique world.  I've watched some episodes 7 or 8 times.  I'm sure that I will watch both seasons again and again in the years to come.

Bryan Fuller has pledged to continue the series in one way or another.  He has hopes of a made for TV movie to bring the story to a close.  If he is unable to make a movie, he has apparently been in talks with DC Comics to continue PUSHING DAISIES as a comic series.  (Ever since Joss Whedon continued BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER by continuing Season 8 in a new form, other TV creators have followed form.  Rob Thomas has hopes of continuing VERONICA MARS at some point when he isn't so busy creating multiple new shows.  Rockne O'Bannon wrote a story for a new brief FARSCAPE comic series.)  My hope is that by ""DC"" he really meant their highly distinguished imprint Vertigo, the most prestigious label in comics.  I'm delighted that Bryan Fuller wants to keep faith with the show's fans and show us where he wanted to stories to go.

And there is so much we want to know!  Although some of this might be answered by the three unbroadcast episodes (which if ABC manages to get out of showing would certainly be contained in the DVD set), there are huge unanswered questions.  First and foremost, will Chuck and Ned ever find a way to touch?  Will Olive learn about Ned's secret gift and how will she respond?  Will Lily and Vivian learn that Chuck is alive again?  Will Emerson locate his long lost daughter (the wonderful Gina Torres was cast as Emerson's ex-wife, but I don't know if her episodes were ever filmed)?  What was the secret of the three watches?  What will happen with Chuck's dad?  And what about Ned's Dad?  And precisely where did Ned get his remarkable gift and what is its larger significance?  A made for TV movie would answer some of these.  But I hope that in addition to the movie Fuller will indeed create a comic.  I want answers.

But nothing is going to replace the huge loss the show creates.  I am a huge collector of TV shows on DVD.  I have a large and rich and very high quality collection.  When I moved last August I arranged my TV DVD box sets on shelves, leaving room for future additions.  Right between my box sets for THE PRISONER and SLINGS AND ARROWS I left a fair amount of empty space for what I was certain was going eventually be 4 or 5 or 6 seasons of PUSHING DAISIES.  Now I'll need only a fraction of the space.",1231545600,154,8724,4.541319666880205
3566614,5,B001FB4VZI,"I accidentally happened upon this television series and was instantly hooked.  Even after I transfered overseas I purchased the entire first season I was so in love with the series.  The characters, themes, set, and, well, just everything about it make it hard to resist, much like a guilty pleasure.  There is tons of wonderful cinematography, witty quips, and thoughtful acting.  The whole concept behind the show itself it simply clever.  Once you start watching you find there are so many different and unique dynamics betweeen all the characters, amusing and heart warming alike.  Plus, each episode's ""mystery"" is always so creative and funny you can't help but be tickled.  I think its a total shame ABC is cutting this cute show from tv.  Highly recommend watching.  I, myself, have shared the first season with several friends as well as with my family all to positive reviews.  After watching this show it is hard to walk away with out the ""feel goods.""",1230336000,37,963,4.888888888888889

3566616,5,B001FB4VZI,"PUSHING DAISIES is a treasure.  One of the most brilliant, beautiful, exhilirating series in the history of TV.

And ABC cancelled it.

Television 101.  If you have a brilliant show, it has the potential of becoming a hit.  If you have garbage, you have zilch.  Few shows have ever been as critically acclaimed as PUSHING DAISIES.  It made the highly exclusive America Film Institute's list of the ten best shows on TV.  It got more Emmy nominations than any other show on network television.  Every major TV critic in America raved over it.  There are numerous examples in the history of TV of similarly critical favorites that managed to build an audience and become hits.  But ABC took the cowardly path and cancelled one of the best shows in the history of TV.

As people discover this show either in downloads or on DVD, they will be incredulous that such a work of genius was cancelled.  There has never been a show with such brilliant set design and art direction.  Each episode of the series is stunning to look at.  The lone consolation following its demise is that each episode is so perfect, so exquisite that it is worth 2 or 3 episodes of any other show.  What is most astonishing about PUSHING DAISIES cancellation is the overall weakness of the ABC schedule.  Perhaps the weakest of the major three networks, it is struggling to pull together a decent schedule.  Why does it make sense to cancel your best series?  True, the viewership was down from its amazing Season One, but it isn't as if ABC has anything decent to put in its place.  With this decision ABC moves solidly into last place in the chase for quality not just among the Big Three, but the Big Four.  Indeed, once LOST has finished its run next year, it is a dilemma why anyone would turn to ABC for anything.

Enough about the stupidity of ABC.  PUSHING DAISIES is magical.  It is lovely beyond imagining and had it been given sufficient opportunity would have told one of the most magical love stories ever.  Ned has a gift.  Anything dead thing that he touches comes alive again.  If untouched within sixty seconds, something roughly equivalent will die in its place.  If Ned touches it again, that thing will be dead again, forever.  The story revolves around Ned's childhood sweetheart Chuck.  After she is murdered, Ned touches her, and unable to touch her again within the requisite sixty seconds, she is alive again, as long as he never touches her again.  PUSHING DAISIES largely revolves around this wonderfully poignant love dilemma.  Chuck and Ned are in love, yet they can never touch.

What makes PUSHING DAISIES so brilliant apart from this central classic puzzle is . . . well, everything.  The dialogue is as brilliant as any show in the history of TV, including BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER and THE GILMORE GIRLS.  Visually the show has no rival in the history of TV.  The overarching narrative, which has only gotten underway as it has been cancelled, is intriguing and leaves you dying to know what happens next.  The acting is wonderful, with a deep and extraordinarily gifted cast, with multiple Broadway stars.  There is not a weak link in the entire cast and everyone adds tremendously to the show.  Anna Friel and Lee Pace are marvelous as Chuck and Ned, while Chi McBride steals nearly every scene he is in as Ned's detective partner Emerson Cod.  The great Kristin Chenoweth, one of the great Broadway musical stars of her generation, finally found a non-stage vehicle for her enormous talent as waitress Olive Snook.  Swoosie Kurtz and Ellen Greene are extraordinary as The Darling Mermaid Darlings, whom Chuck believes are her two aunts (she is only half right).  The show is bolstered by a string of brilliant guest stars, not to mention famed acting teacher Sy Richardson, who has a recurring role as the Coroner.  As essential as any of these is the brilliant narration of Jim Dale, perhaps best known for his reading on audiotape of the Harry Potter novels.  This is the most brilliant narration on any show ever on television.

Although it looks like ABC is doggedly determined to persist in its idiotic decision to cancel its best series, there is a tiny bit of hope that there will be eventual resolution to the narrative.  Bryan Fuller, the creator of the show, has indicated that he hopes to make a movie (either direct-to-DVD or for TV) to wrap up the story.  Failing that, he has talked to DC Comics about continuing the series in comic form (a la BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER Season 8, which has been so successful on Dark Horse Comics).  I assume that the comic would actually appear on the Vertigo label, which is the most prestigious line of adult oriented comics anywhere.  But it is an indictment of the television industry that a show this could was not kept alive.  Frankly, any goodwill that I had towards ABC has been destroyed.  Except for finishing watching LOST, I plan on pretty much skipping any new ABC series.  If a network won't stick by its best shows, why should viewers stick with it?",1228780800,8,5017,4.6819221967963385
3566617,4,B001FB4VZI,"This episode came to us the same week that the heartbreaking news of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pushing-Daisies/dp/B000YAA2SQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pushing Daisies</a>&nbsp;cancellation by ABC  was announced.  Hopefully they will re-consider by the vast numbers of people who buy this episode!

Anyway, this episode brings lots of fun info about the family history of Chuck & Ned, as well as some fun stage magic antics by a very different Fred Willard.  Willard eschews his usual character to play a snide but loving magician who has a problem with murdered assistants.  Willard is great, as is Kerri Kenney (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Reno-911/dp/B0001XAODE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Reno 911</a>&nbsp;as his long suffering, and not too happy about it, assistant.

This episode is also notable for being the first time in the series where Chuck is made to look sexy, and also for Emmerson Cod's hilarious deconstruction of stage magic.  Ned also has some great lines trying to look tough when confronting the murderer; his facade is shattered almost instantly as his true bravado shines through.",1227225600,,1194,6.333333333333333
3566618,5,B001FB4VZI,"Pushing Daisies is a show known for its whimsical narration, heavily CGI-enhanced visuals and charming humor.  What is less well known to those outside the regular viewers of the show are its other qualities, the more subtle ones that don't play as well during commercial breaks but do keep you coming back for more and more.

Quick summary:  Main character Olive Snook has been cloistered in a nunnery for several episodes, but she returns to the main setting to retrieve her co-stars for a mystery involving the alleged suicide of a fellow nun.  Much hilarity and many unexpected revelations ensue.

This particular episode is a perfect example.  Sure, all the usual things are there; murder mystery, philosophical musings about death, silly and madcap comedy from the main quartet of characters.  But this episode is in my opinion the finest example of the show's great strengths in nuanced acting, beautiful cinematography and amazing writing.

First off, this episode is a great showcase for Lee Pace's many talents as Ned, the Pie-maker who can bring the dead back to life.  Pace shows a great gift for comedic understatement, most notably in his barely contained enthusiasm for a particular dish of food that he has a chance to savor.  His wordless reaction to Chuck's ""hooker-wig"" conveys more than any joke ever could.  But his real show-off is a heart-to-heart that he has with Olive near the end of the episode, in which Pace handles a soul-revealing monologue without betraying anything about his character.  It should be noted that Kristen Chenowith also shines in that scene, with a wonderful bit of acting during a long-pull in as her character's heart breaks all over the place, she picks it back up and tries to move on, all in an almost motionless performance.

For a show that is known for is fantastic visuals (that is, fantastic in the ""not real"" sense, not just the ""superlative"" sense), the excellence of the everyday cinematography is often overlooked.  This episode in particular is beautiful in every single scene, but especially in the scene shot in the convent.  The use of firelight, candles, and reflected light from religious icons lend it a very warm look that is given a slight painterly quality from the exaggerated colors.  Just a treat for the eyes.

Finally, the writing.  The heart-to-heart between Olive & Ned is the most mature and touching statement of friendship and non-romantic affection that I have ever seen in TV, movies or any other realm of fiction.  The characters have a bit of a history, but that is not necessary to appreciate the scene, as the dialogue makes it plainly clear:  she loves him, he loves someone else, what to do?  What is unusual in this show as a whole is that they have not simply eliminated the ""third wheel"" from the relationship.  She is not an object of any attraction for Ned, but she continues to pine for him.  Not normally a very interesting character, but this exploration of how a friendship can be maintained and even deepen in the face of declared but not reciprocated romance is exceptionally well played out here.  I challenge you, dear reader, to think of how many times in television a man has apologized to a woman for being cavalier with her feelings, when the man is NOT trying to win her back romantically.

All that, and the depiction of religion in this episode, and the series as a whole, is respectful, playful and intelligent.  Religious conventions are needled with a bit of loving humor, but never is anyone ridiculed or vilified for having sincere beliefs.  In fact, even the non-religious characters acknowledge the positive power of religion in their lives.",1224547200,6,3658,4.877022653721683

3566755,5,B001FB4VZI,"I can sing praises about Pushing Daisies. It is my favourite TV shows of all time so I will be biased but from the narrator's voice to the concept, this TV show has very little flaw. It is essentially a detective story without the suspense and the colours in the series are always so vibrant. It is a love story, as it was told in the first 10 minutes of the first episode and it is very bittersweet.

I could gush all about this series but you really have to watch the first episode and see whether or not you like it. Articulating my excitement, love and wonder for this series could take forever. It is unfortunate that it ended in season 2, but I don't think it hung in a cliffhanger as bad as other series.",1444176000,,711,4.189781021897811

3566812,5,B001FB4VZI,"This is by far my favorite show that I have ever seen. The main storyline about the lives of Ned, Chuck, Olive, and Emerson is original and intelligent, and it balances the humorous and the sympathetic very well. The characters are loveable, funny, and adorably imperfect, and they are brilliantly acted by some superb actors. The chemistry (romantic or otherwise) between Ned and the other main characters is spot on to me. Additionally, the episodic storylines of various death investigations are ingenious and hilarious. The situations border on the absurd but in the best way possible as part of the over-the-top, fairy-tale presentation of the show. Visually, the show is interesting and often unexpected.

The show deserved every one of the seven Emmy Awards it got (in addition to the other awards), and the ratings and cancellation seem to be more a reflection of the American public's desire for unoriginal, clichd, unintelligent crime dramas and hospital dramas and celebrity dance-offs than a reflection on the brilliance of Pushing Daisies.",1431043200,3,1052,5.224852071005917

It's very funny in a bizarre, quirky sort of way; if you like Mel Brooks and Gene Wilder, you will love this series.  Pay attention to the language, for the writer slips adult humor in.  When the adult content is blatant, for the  most part the kids won't catch it; one of my daughters said, ""Sometimes when you and dad laugh, I don't understand.""  You will enjoy this series:  it is incredibly innovative.  The acting and the script are great!  We really wish the show had not been cancelled.",1426550400,,648,4.325

3566885,5,B001FB4VZI,"I love this show. It's sweet, quirkily, suspenseful, well-written and acted. The only problem is it was cancelled too soon. Lee Pace is great, and Chi McBride's character cracks me up. (""A truckload of mimes just arrived, and they're not talking."")",1417392000,,248,5.073170731707317
3566886,5,B001FB4VZI,"So, Ned has this power: With one touch he can bring something - or someone - dead back to life.
Cool.
But there are a few catches.
First of all, if the formerly dead something or someone stays alive for more than 60 seconds something or someone else must die.
Not so cool but understandable. I mean the universe must, after all, stay in some sort of balance.
Secondly, once he has brought it or them back to life Ned can never touch it or them again.
If he does, it or they die.
This time, forever.
Welcome to the second - and last - season of 'Pushing Daisies,' an absolutely delightful, Emmy winning comedy that died all too soon for its many fans.
The series revolves around Ned and his unique ability, his formerly dead girlfriend Charlotte Charles - who goes by the nickname  'Chuck' - and a tight ensemble cast of friends and relatives headed by the wonderful Kristin Chenoweth and veteran character actor Chi McBride.
Chenoweth plays Olive Snook, who works at Ned's restaurant. She's had a longtime crush on her boss, who makes the best pies in the city, but Ned only has eyes for Chuck. This leads to some hilarious situations and some that are downright poignant as, in this second season, she is forced to come to grips with that fact.
McBride, meanwhile, plays private detective Emerson Cod, one of the very few people who know of Ned's special ability. Ned, in fact, helps Cod out on cases by reanimating dead people and asking them who, in fact, killed them. The answers aren't always clear, as you can imagine, since he only has 60 seconds at a time to explain to them that they're dead and then ask them his question.
Anna Friel plays Chuck, who was murdered while on a cruise in the South Pacific. Ned has reanimated her but, of course, can't touch her again. This makes for some very intriguing scenes between the two of them and leads to more than one complication in what is already a very complicated relationship.
Three things make this series really stand out, in my opinion.
First: the dialogue is an amazing mix of film noir and elegance and is often spoken at a rapid pace - not too rapid, but just fast enough to add a certain amount of humor to the words.
Second: Chenoweth steals virtually every scene she is in and that's saying something because Lee Pace, who plays Ned, Friel and McBride are very fine actors who can certainly hold their own in just about any scene.
Finally: Series creator Bryan Fuller's comic genius is evident in every scene. His characters are appealing, the plots are grounded (despite their often-fantastic nature) and he knows how to inject just the right amount of poignancy into his writing, thereby turning what could have been slapstick into something much finer, much rarer.
Shame on the corporate types for canceling this wonderful series before its time was due.",1416873600,5,2824,4.614314115308151

From the sets to the costumes, and even the exterior compositions, colors are vivid and chosen meaningfully in every single scene of every single episode. The dialog sparkles with wit, humor and irony. The characters are sharply drawn and incredibly unique. The actors are exceptional, especially Chi McBride (Emerson Cod) and Kristen Chenoweth (Olive Snook), who frequently steal the show. Lee Pace (Ned) and Anna Friel (Chuck) have astonishing chemistry and are uniquely able to carry a very unconventional love story.

The stories tend to be a tad repetitive but all lead to the ultimate series conclusion that gets tied up, perhaps a bit too quickly, at the end of the last episode.  The visual color exaggeration, which I have only seen once before in Ugly Betty, lends a cartoon-like quality to the show and allows the viewer to suspend disbelief while enjoying the visual spectacle.

The central relationship is somewhat endearing although it was getting a bit tired by the end so it is probably good that the series ended.  The side stories and peripheral characters were all very well written and played.

3567056,5,B001FB4VZI,"Great show, totally unique, fun and entertaining.  One of the most innovative and creative shows to come along in a long time.  Of course they cancelled it.  What else would you do with such a great show?",1401926400,,204,4.45945945945946
3567057,4,B001FB4VZI,I watched the whole thing in about a week with the girlfriend. It was a good show. Glad it didn't go on for longer. Too many good shows turn bad after a while.,1401753600,,159,3.8484848484848486
3567058,5,B001FB4VZI,Such a wonderful and entertaining show. I wish I would have discovered it while it was on air. I watched both seasons over the past couple days and would really like to see where the characters go next! So sad it was only two seasons. It's a new favorite.,1401667200,,255,4.224489795918367
3567079,5,B001FB4VZI,I really wish I had discovered Pushing Daisies while it was still a regular series. This is an excellent series that did not get enough time :(,1401667200,,143,4.333333333333333

3567081,5,B001FB4VZI,"This is a quirky, fun show. If you have enjoyed Bryan Fuller's other work (Dead Like Me, etc.), you will probably enjoy this as well. Nice combination of solving a mystery (usually a murder) and character development.  Incredible ensemble.",1401408000,,239,5.128205128205129
3567082,5,B001FB4VZI,I am sooo sad that they cancelled the show.... Lee is SO good in this. The story is interesting and I liked the way they lay out the story line. Lee definitely deserves more leading roles in movies and shows like this one. He is a very skillful actor.,1401321600,,251,4.142857142857143

3567084,5,B001FB4VZI,I was so shocked when this series ended. It was a joy to look forward to each week.  The writing was magical and you had to pay attention to get all the nuggets of smart writing.,1401321600,,178,3.9444444444444446
3567085,4,B001FB4VZI,"I loved the first season of the show. I thought it was one of the best shows I had ever seen. The second season left me unfulfilled, though. The lighting, costumes, and storylines were spot on until about halfway through the second season. Things began to get too heavy, and the show lost some of it's whimsical charm that made it so great to lose yourself in. By the next to last episode I wasn't sure I would want to see the next season. But the way it ended! Why was it not renewed?!? The ending alone was enough for this to be 4 stars instead of 5.
If you want to enjoy a lighthearted, so over the top it's great, show, I highly recommend Pushing Daisies. I loved it, and will probably watch it again. Don't say I didn't warn you about how it ends, though.",1401321600,3,760,4.1768707482993195

3567123,5,B001FB4VZI,I love this show.  The characters they created interact so well and are well developed.  I wish there was so much more.  I would love for the writers to make a movie to tie all the loose ends since this season ended too soon.  This show is much better than a lot of other shows that are on TV now.,1400630400,,297,3.9

3567126,5,B001FB4VZI,Really enjoyed the second season.  I'm very sad that this program was cancelled.  Chi McBride (Emerson Cod) and Kristen Chenoweth (Olive Snook) are very funny and Lee Pace (Ned) is just a joy to watch.  I can't believe he and King Thranduil of the Hobbit are the same actor - love them both!,1400025600,,291,4.452830188679245
3567127,4,B001FB4VZI,"This is the little show that could have been something great, but of course it was before it's time. For having only two seasons the show rapped pretty well. The series finale was better than most shows (insert How I Met Your Mother Joke here) and it really left it open for more to happen so hopefully they will turn it into a movie or maybe even revive it.",1399939200,,358,4.202898550724638

3567172,5,B001FB4VZI,"This is a really well written, thoughtful show. It's too bad that it didn't last longer. All of Bryan Fuller's shows are intelligent and the acting is always top notch (Dead like Me and Hannibal) but they don't seem to last. Good for a binge watch",1399420800,,247,4.391304347826087
3567173,5,B001FB4VZI,I never watched this series when it first aired. Just discovered it for myself last week and I just adore it!  The writing is very witty and the bright retro sets and costumes are fabulous.,1399420800,,189,4.4

3567177,5,B001FB4VZI,Excellent writing. Enjoyed the actors. After the strike I could never find when it was on next. I am still upset that it was cancelled.,1399075200,,135,4.44
3567178,5,B001FB4VZI,"If you have made it past season 1 already, this season is still great. I'm sad that it got canceled because of the writers strike. If after watching this season you still want more, like I do, pay attention to social media.

3567222,5,B001FB4VZI,The show was cancelled way too soon. Hopefully it gets resurrected by Netflix or someone else. The four main characters grew into their roles rapidly and are magic together. Kristin Chenoweth is absolutely delicious. The scenery and green screen imagery are enchanting. I hesitated getting involved with the series because it was so short but I guess it's better to have love and lost than never......,1398556800,,401,5.090909090909091

3567229,5,B001FB4VZI,I love the two seasons of Pushing Daisies. Rumor is that they may have a movie or a musical in the works!  I would love that so the story would be resolved between Ned and Chuck.,1397865600,,178,3.9444444444444446

3567269,5,B001FB4VZI,"Sure, this show is pretty much unlike anything you've seen before, but it's light, humorous, and vibrant.  It's chick flick-ish, but it's a whimsical murder mystery.  Fun!",1396828800,,171,5.296296296296297
3567270,4,B001FB4VZI,"I love this quirky series. I am upset that it did not get continued past the second season, but the first two seasons are very worth the watch. The subject matter may come across as very dark, but the humorous presentation and execution of potentially traumatizing scenarios is glorious! It brings a sense of humor into something that we have no control over, our own mortality.",1396828800,,378,4.742424242424242

3567302,4,B001FB4VZI,I think this was a really inventive and fun show. I can understand why it only lasted two seasons. Definitely worth the time invested for the existing two seasons!

Lee Pace as the pie maker is completely charming and I can't believe this is the same actor who plays Thranduil in The Hobbit, or Roy Walker in The Fall, or Calpernia Addams in Soldier's Girl.  This man is a chameleon!

The cast is an eclectic mix of loveable, quirky souls who bring such life and fun to the story lines, which are written with hilarious and hauntingly touching flair.  This show is such an extraordinary treasure, and I am saddened that it ended so soon. If you are looking for a light-hearted escape, this is the one!",1396396800,,446,4.717948717948718

The only bad thing about this series is that it only ran for two seasons. I really wish there was more. Didn't get enough. The last episode tries admirably to wrap things up. Still feels bittersweet.

3567770,5,B001FB4VZI,"The second season starts off a little awkward (though the spoof of ""The Sound of Music"" is quite enjoyable), but quickly regains its footing and you're roaring along happily when *BAM!* you realize you've hit the last episode.  :(  The writers give you hints about how the loose ends of the series will wrap up, but there isn't time to do much more than say things like, ""And when Emerson Cod heard the knock at his door, he knew his wish of <spoiler I'll not mention> had finally come true.""  So, you get an answer for some of the characters' dilemmas that have been running through the series, but its not enough of an answer for you to think, ""Ah, they wrapped that up well, and they couldn't have gone any farther with the characters.""  They essentially told you there were answers, showed you some of the answers, but left out enough details that you're wishing there were more episodes or a reunion movie or something (maybe a pop up book) to finish out the story.",1391126400,,970,4.494318181818182

3567917,5,B001FB4VZI,"I love this show because the acting is superb and the sets and costumes are like eye candy on Christmas morning!! The main story line is creative and nothing like any other. The essence of  being in a children's story book dream in combination with the sleuthing... and the character story lines that are creative and witty with twists of laughter and depth carry viewers away. When my teen daughter and I watch this show we laugh, we gasp, we ahh and oo over the sets, and then laugh some more- sure perfection. Plus, come on- how beautiful is it to look at Lee Pace..and then to hear Kristin Chenoweth treat us to a song now and then?",1389657600,,636,4.389830508474576

3568106,5,B001FB4VZI,"This show has all the elements that viewers seek, suspense, comedy, romanticism and a classic fairytale that ended too soon. This show barely has two full seasons, but it still has the ability to encapsulate audiences via wonderfully written  lines and relatable characters. Pushing Daisies will always be my all time favorite shows that centers around a concept of love unforeseen by the media, which makes this show ultimately unique! Love this show from every aspect the premise, characters, music, and filmography! This is a 5 star piece of art!",1388707200,,549,5.1

Soon I'm afraid we'll be stuck with all ""reality"" tv!  Everything was stellar:  the premise (a guy has the strange ability to bring back the dead with a touch--but if he ever touches that entity again it will be dead forever.  Now he's brought his soulmate back, and although they love each other, they can never touch), the production quality (this show has a really artistic look to it), the talent (the narrator is the great Jim Dale, and all the cast is extremely talented, including Kristin Chenoweth!), etc.  Anyway, if you like unique, creative television, this is a favorite in our house.  Also, appropriate for all except the smallest children who might be bothered by the fact that there are a lot of corpses on this show.",1386115200,5,874,4.7105263157894735

3568161,5,B001FB4VZI,"This series is the crown jewel of the 'magical realism' movement. There is not a single frame of it that isn't beautiful and whimsical. The acting is spot on from the entire cast, and Lee Pace continues to mesmerize. There's just really not much more to say, except that no matter how many times I watch it, I am always saddened by the fact that there are only two seasons. This is one that should have gone ten. :)",1385683200,2,415,4.265822784810126
3568162,5,B001FB4VZI,"Pushing Daisies was a deeply underrated show. Lee Pace is charming and awkward as the piemaker (Ned), who can tough dead things alive... but just once, as once he touches them a second time, they're dead forever (when you watch, you'll note that my wording is almost directly from the script, since they repeat the premise in the opening narration just about every episode and I just recently marathon watched the whole series so it's stuck in my head). Anna Friel is sharp and easy to fall in love with as the piemaker's childhood love (Chuck) who died and he touched to life, and kept her that way.

The show is, mostly, a serial, and while there are a couple of overarching plotlines, many episodes can be watched without watching everything that came before it (although I really recommend watching the whole series from start to finish). What's truly impressive is how much you will root for this unlikely couple. They can't touch, not to hold hands or even peck, lest she end up dead again, forever. The tension and warmth between them is impressive, especially considering how short a run this show got.

Plus, you get the INCOMPARABLE Chi McBride and Kristin Chenoweth as the piemaker's friends, with Swoozie Kurtz and Ellen Green (one of those faces you absolutely know but can't quite place....) as Chuck's reclusive and boozy aunts. You get surrealism and arguably effective special effect. It's warmhearted and surprising and Chuck's wardrobe is impeccable (if you're into that kind of thing). Highly recommended.",1384819200,2,1525,4.929961089494164
3568223,5,B001FB4VZI,"Cute show!  I have been watching with my 17 year old daughter and we both love it.  Interesting concept (bringing people back from the dead for one minute to help solve their own murder.  My only complaint is that every time I see ""Vivian Charles"" I hear the song ""Suddenly Seymour"" from Little Shop of Horrors in my brain  :)

3568539,4,B001FB4VZI,"I think mostly due to the truncated first season, the second season suffered a decline in quality. It was still an excellent show canceled too soon, but the pace felt too rushed. And the number of subplots got a little overwhelming, especially considering there were only thirteen episodes. So many people from the characters' pasts showed up all at once. I do like that they made an effort to give it a proper ending. Obviously, that also was a bit hurried. But, given the circumstances, that can be understood. As in the first season, the actors were great. Emerson and Olive got a bit more development, which I certainly appreciated. I still found the Olive mooning over Ned storyline a bit tiresome, but it did seem to be winding up by the end. Having read some of the creator's ideas about how he would have continued the series, I actually think I'm a little relieved that the show ended when it did. I was just starting to not like it quite as much. This way I can remember it fondly, instead of as a show that used to be good in the beginning and now just needs to be put out of its misery.",1377216000,,1098,4.387254901960785

It kind of plays out a bit like Psych mixed with Buffy the Vampire Slayer or Angel, mixed with a third old-timey crime drama (sounds boring, but trust me--I'm from the internet). I would definitely recommend this along with some of my other favorites from similar genres: (if you like any of these you will likely *like* the others) Dead Like Me (show), Reaper (show), Lo (movie), and my favorite of all time, Wristcutters: A Love Story (movie).

3568748,5,B001FB4VZI,"Strangely enough... it works! The rich, technicolor imagery is a shocking but pleasant contrast to the fact that they are bringing the dead back to life for 60 seconds. Its sad and funny at the same time, while offering the viewer a wonderfully entertaining jaunt through a storybook town with a dark secret. Murder and nefarious plots abound as our heroes try to sort out  the complications of Romance, Business, and Family issues.

The episodes are served up bedtime story style, complete with a soothing, 'Dr. Seuss'-esque narration. This is a must see show for those looking to escape the normal, cookie-cutter style programming prevalent in today's TV. My only regret is that it was canceled far too soon.",1374364800,,710,4.957983193277311
3568889,5,B001FB4VZI,The premise was unique and with so many imaginative characters it never became hum-drum. The narrator's exposition woven throughout was a nice touch threading the scenes together. The sets and settings were imaginative and unique to the point of somtimes overshadowing the acting. In case it doesn't show I really enjoyed the show. As I said it's sweet and clever.,1374364800,,364,5.083333333333333

3568897,5,B001FB4VZI,So much plot development occurs in the second season of Pushing Daisies.  We have really enjoyed it so far-only a few more episodes to go before we're through it.,1373500800,,162,4.586206896551724
3568898,5,B001FB4VZI,Dark subject matter couched in a fairy tale... how could you go wrong with that.  I thoroughly enjoy this show.,1373414400,,111,4.55

3568950,4,B001FB4VZI,"too bad the network didn't like this quirky and fun show. so far season 1 was a bit better than the first couple episodes from season 2, but over all this show should be highly recommended to anyone who enjoys a good show. it has comedy and fun stories, along with a completely original story telling style.",1373241600,,307,4.4035087719298245
3568951,4,B001FB4VZI,"The show uses a lot CG to enhance the enviornments that some people may find distracting at first but is a unique style that you'll soon get used to. The main character's superpower to resurrect the dead with a single touch has good limitations on it so the power can't be overly exploited for convenience, and watching him rush to question the dead about their killers in the sixty seconds he has before he needs to zap them back to being dead is funny. The characters are really likable, each unique, and it's interesting for the main character to have a girlfriend he can't even touch without her zapping back to death. For a show about solving murders it's very light hearted and maintains the feel of a fairy tale. Overall I'd recommend giving this show a watch.",1373155200,,767,4.565217391304348
3568952,5,B001FB4VZI,"The style, stories, characters and concepts are just wonderful. You can expect more of the same from the first season, except with some budget improvements; CGI, bigger more elaborate sets, of course more costumes. However, this season deviated quite a bit from the who dun it, to more of character and overarching story plots. And unfortunately it was not finished as the show was canceled.
The only complaint you can really have with this season is, simply, not enough of it.",1372982400,,477,4.901234567901234

3568956,5,B001FB4VZI,"Just like Firefly, Dead Like Me, and Jericho, I discovered Pushing Daisies years after they had gone off the air.  PD is unlike the others in that it is hard to pin it down to any one genre.  Crime drama, romantic comedy, zombie comedy?  Take your pick.
Brilliant cast, brilliant sets, brilliant wardrobes; it had a look unlike anything else on tv I've ever seen.  Writing was tight, surprise guest stars, and a short, concise series wrap-up that left some sense of satisfaction.",1372550400,,479,4.734939759036145

I really adored all of the characters, and the cast brought them to life brilliantly. Lee Pace (Ned) has become one of my favorite actors, and I was very impressed by Chi McBride's performance as Emerson Cod. The sets and costumes were gorgeous as well, being unlike anything else I have seen on TV over the years, and the dialogue was funny and a pleasure to listen too. It's a shame this show was cancelled so soon. I would have loved at least another season to help bring the story to an adequate close. If a movie is ever made I will definitely be seeing it!

From Wiki--Touted as a ""forensic fairy tale"", the series is known for its unique visual style, quirky characters, and fast-paced dialogue, often employing wordplay, metaphor, and double entendre.

It portrays such a fun, unique world that really pulls the viewer in. Yet another brilliant, critically acclaimed and award winning creation from Bryan Fuller that got cut ridiculously short.

Lee Pace as Ned is perfection, and Kristin Chenoweth at times simply steals the show as the lovestriken Olive. Anna Friel as Chuck endears the audience. Awesome show. Watch it.",1366329600,,363,4.777777777777778

You get drawn into the stories  which (thankfully) have a beginning and an ending while the main characters have ongoing plots. I never knew it was on television. Must not have been advertised enough. I came across it because the title was intriguing, and now I have sadly finished watching the whole series.",1365811200,,450,4.756410256410256

It is full of clean, unique humor following the antics of the piemaker and his true love, whom he can never touch.  The artistry of the writing, acting, and visuals are a banquet in this entertainment-starved world of reality TV and the like.  (I cry to think two seasons are all that are available.)

Bright colors, rapid fire dialog, endearing characters who will occasionally have you shaking your head but loving them all the same.  Recommend starting at the beginning, with season one, and just letting yourself go with the flow.  For the Hobbit fans out there, there is the added bonus of Lee Pace in the lead (Thranduil from Hobbit), and a guest appearance in season 2 of Graham McTavish (Dwalin from the Hobbit).

3569462,5,B001FB4VZI,Love this series.  So well done and beautifully filmed and written.  Love Kristen Chenoweth and all the other actors.  I really wish this show had lasted beyond the second season.  It needed at least one more season to tie up all the loose ends.,1361491200,,245,4.5

3569526,5,B001FB4VZI,"The premise is refreshing and original, the cast is an absolute delight, the screenplay is fast and witty, and the hi-jinks in every episode are great fun to watch. The second season of Pushing Daisies shows a much more confident and adventurous production. It is just unfortunate that the show was affected by the writer's strike in the early 2000's, losing most of its momentum from the first season and ultimately getting canceled after its second season and wrapping up the loose ends sloppily.",1361145600,,498,4.940476190476191

3569530,4,B001FB4VZI,"Pushing Daisies had its own look and style and was unlike anything else on television that I ever saw. The premise was science fictional, but the cast and situations were inventive and a joy to watch. It was cancelled at about the time of the TV writers' strike and never came back, which was a pity. Another ho-hum cop show replaced it, I guess",1360540800,,345,4.40625

3569623,5,B001FB4VZI,"No, this season doesn't disappoint; all the characters you've grown to love are back again in more convoluted situations.  The sad part is that the series was not picked up for Season 3, so the ending seems a jumble of odd conclusions in an attempt to tie up loose ends.  Still worth the watch!",1354665600,,294,4.425925925925926

Pushing Daisies does have a wonderful Series Finale that leaves viewers with a happy heart and the characters just as they should be which was nice-no wondering ""what happened to...""",1345420800,,351,4.770491803278689
3569671,5,B001FB4VZI,"Pushing Daisies is a charming, imaginative and stylized comedy that is cleverly scripted and perfectly cast. There is not a weak link in this ensemble and the level of excellence and attention to detail in the sets and costumes is remarkable for an American network show. Of course that made it expensive to produce and networks want market share with as little overhead as possible. Hence this  show joined the scrap heap of other great, but cancelled shows such as Better Off Ted and GCB. Sad really. But what can we expect really? We're talking about free American network TV.

Still..at least we have these two seasons..here..to remind us what TV should and could be..and then there's always cable and HBO.",1344816000,,710,4.859504132231405
3569672,5,B001FB4VZI,"I thoroughly enjoyed this episode!  Ned and the gang investigate the murder of a magician while Ned and Charlotte each delve deeper into the secrets of their own pasts and their connections with their birth parents.

The gang's antics in the magic hall have it all...stopping just short of pulling a mask off an old man shaking his fist and saying, ""And if it wasn't for those meddling kids, I would've got away with it!""

Good stuff!",1342310400,,434,4.6103896103896105
3569673,5,B001FB4VZI,"When I watched the first episode, I immediatedly thought, ""no way.""  However, I kept coming back for more because the idea of the plot intrigued me. A lonely young man, Ned, has the curse/gift of bringing people/things back to life, but if that person or thing remains living for more than one minute, someone or something else dies. I applaud the makers for portraying real humanity into every episode...what person wouldn't bring back their loved ones if they could and then struggle morally with that decision, whether good or bad?  I found myself needing to watch every episode of this short series because I absolutely fell in love with the characters, who by the way, were perfect for their perspective parts.  I also loved that at the beginning of every episode, the narrator always brought the audience into the plot for the current show...at first, I thought, ""enough"", but found that after I began watching, I needed him. Quirky, whimsical and good ole fashioned funny, this is a good series for people who like humane humour with a bit of horror/supernatural.",1339200000,,1070,4.900552486187845
3569674,5,B001FB4VZI,"I watch a lot of TV shows, but none have quite struck me like Pushing Daises has. The story is about a pie-maker who has the fantastical ability to touch people and bring them back to life. However, there is a catch. He can only bring them back for one minute, and if they are alive for any longer, someone else must die to even the score between life and death. Emerson Cod, a money-loving large black man who brings an air of reality and much humor to show, is a private detective who teams up with the pie-maker to solve murders. Because the pie-maker can bring people back to life momentarily, he can ask them for clues on their murder. The murder victims are not gruesome and are shown in very clever, almost animated, fashions. Their deaths are never depressing, as the plot unfolds somewhat like a play, you keep a distance from their lives and a closeness with the lives of the main characters instead. Now, the murder-mystery-solving scenes comprise only a portion of the plot, as there is also the added twist that once the pie-maker touches a dead thing to bring it back to life, he can never touch it again or it will die, forever. The complication in this occurs when he finds himself waking his childhood crush, ""Chuck,"" and fails to touch her again within one minute. They fall in love, but must avoid contact at all costs. Olive, the adorable and musically talented Kristin Chenoweth, is madly in love with the pie-maker, and knows nothing of his powers. If you can imagine, seeing a relationship like that between the pie-maker and Chuck causes much confusion from an outside perspective. The filming is wonderful and makes every scene ""pop."" There's never a dull moment. It is masterfully creative and very artistic. Its makers utilized each character to their fullest degree, they are multi-dimensional, themed, and each display their individual acting talents. There is much more to say and see, but don't take it from me! I absolutely LOVE this TV show and highly recommend that you at least give it a try!! You will be impressed, amused, inspired, and hooked!",1338940800,,2081,4.688524590163935

3569766,5,B001FB4VZI,"Another wonderful show killed by greed. People aren't watching much TV anymore because of the greed of TV executives. WAY TOO MANY COMMERCIALS. When you take a show no matter how wonderful it is and load it up with tones of commercials, there's no point in watching. People watch TV so they can loose themselves in a wonderful story but if it is interrupted every few minutes by commercials you CAN'T get involved in the story.

When Ned touches a dead thing once, it becomes alive again. Touch a dead thing twice, dead forever. Keep a dead thing alive for more than a minute, something else has to die.

The storyline is a creative and fun twist on the usual detective show with unusual murders and rampant quirkiness that is taken in stride.  Some of my favorite episodes are in this season.  The characters are the kind you love, strange and loveable and so accessible.

I am please the makers that be managed to wrap up the character-based storylines began in the first season, leading to a pleasing conclusion, so as long as one can accept what episodes there are, there is only happiness to be gleaned from this.

I loved every episode. Visually the show was stunning, brightly colored and everyone was dressed in a very 40's or 50's style (especially the main girl).

 Pushing daisies's revolves around Ned aka the pie maker, who is born with the gift of bringing something that has died back to life, but there is a catch. If whatever he has brought back is alive for 1 minute something of ""equal value"" must die. Ned works with a private detective to solve murders and other mysterious deaths by bringing the dead back to life and basically just asking who killed 'em. Until one day the mysterious death they are investigating is that of Chuck (who is a girl), Ned's long lost love.

This show should not have been cancelled, it was amazing, intriguing and absolutely lovely.

3569885,5,B001FB4VZI,"Pushing Daisies is a very delightful, offbeat, light hearted comedy about death! A very stylistically and thematically original TV series with a unique premise about a young boy who at an early age discovers he has the unique ability to bring dead things back to life by touch. There is a catch though - if he touches something a second time it goes back to being dead forever. Unfortunately, with his power comes still another catch - if he leaves the reanimated person or thing alive more than a minute, something or someone else nearby dies

The boy grows up practically an orphan; after the death of his mother (whom he brings back, but when she touches him to tuck him into bed, she dies again) he is sent to a boarding school for boys.

As a man, he tries to remember his deceased mother's nurturing by becoming a pie-baker. He learns of the death of the one great love in his life, his childhood sweetheart, whom he touches and brings back from the dead. Unfortunately, when he re-animated his mother during his childhood, His allowing her to remain alive past the one minute limit caused the nearby childhood sweetheart's dad to die. This is the terrible secret that he must carry in his romance with his now reanimated sweetheart. Another irony is that though the two people love each other dearly, they can never touch, or she will dies again.

A private investigator sees his re-animation abilities, and they form a partnership; solving murders where there is a reward by re-animating the deceased for a minute to ask who killed them, and collecting the reward.

It is a shame that this series was pulled after only two seasons. It is incredibly original, very engaging, and with very florid scenes that burst with color. An instant classic!",1311984000,,1752,4.697068403908795

3569890,4,B001FB4VZI,"This is a very good show. The dialogue is fast and funny, the visuals are amazing, and the storyline is just weird enough to keep you entertained. It's not really one of those shows that you ""relate"" to; it's too fantastic and out-of-this-world for regular people. But that's what makes the show great - it's not supposed to be ordinary. It strives for extraordinary and far surpasses.

And even though the show was canceled, the makers still did a damn fine job with the last episode. It gives closure to the big storylines while still leaving roads open so the characters and the universe can live on in our imagination.

My one criticism was the character of Chuck. The writers didn't have to, but they basically made her into the Manic Pixie Dream Girl (look up the term on Wikipedia if you don't already know what it means.) Chuck's main purpose is to brighten Ned's dreary life - in fact, that's her ONLY purpose, because she's not even supposed to be alive! So, that's what the writers did. Instead of creating a three-dimensional female character, they inserted a trope. I suppose that was easier, and in a way, it fits the over-the-top style of the show. Kristen Chenoweth's character (Olive) is much more developed and unique than Chuck's, yet she is cast as a Supporting Actress - hell, her character was so well-rounded and so liked that she won an Emmy Award for it! So, that's my one criticism of Pushing Daisies. No television show is perfect, and it's still an excellent show that I would recommend to anyone.",1304640000,5,1525,4.66542750929368

It is the end of the show which disappoints. Pushing Daisies was Magical Realism on television, like a light-hearted Isabelle Allende book rendered in bright colorful images and dialog. For two seasons, this show gave us amusing stories of murder and mayhem that nonetheless did not flinch away from the very real relationship issues and tragedy of losing someone one loves. It was akin to a Samuel Beckett play wherein you find yourself laughing at the events and dialog but then when it is all over you realize that there was some deep emotion and drama which is equally satisfying but in a much more cathartic way.
  As with the Season 1 collection, this collection comes in a cleverly designed package which evokes and suits the contours of this show. The performances in this show are top notch and Kristin Chenoweth once again reminds us of how simply divine she is.

It's a shame it was too good to stay on the air longer.

But this disc is actually pretty bad.  I mean, the transfer is good; the show still shows its strengths.  But how can your only menu option be 'Play all'?  So if you want to watch the fifth episode, you need to 'chapter skip' around 30 times.  That's just absurdly bad.

Still, there is no better disc; your only option is file sharing sites.  So buy it and watch the show; you'll feel better for having seen it.",1263945600,,657,4.150793650793651
3570176,5,B001FB4VZI,Pushing Daisies was such a brilliant and wonderful show. Its unique and witty cases tied in with its great dialouge and stories made this show so great. These are the reasons why I can't believe this show was cancelled. Pushind Daiies brought something to the nightly lineup that no other show could. It had such an interesting concept that kept me tuning in every Wednsday. At least we get the entire second season on DVD. A great purchase I'll never regret.,1263340800,,459,4.679012345679013

If you enjoy very original writing and humor please pick up both Season 1 & 2 of Pushing Daisies as you will want to re-watch them over and over.

3570179,4,B001FB4VZI,"Pushing Daisies was one of the best TV series of the decade. It was fresh, original and a universe unique to itself. The second season was involving, challenging and dazzling.

Why is it no longer being aired by ABC? Because none of the people who keep claiming they want something fresh, original and unique on TV bothered to watch it.

For those of us who did, at least we have the DVDs - which could've used a few comementary tracks instead of just the few pitiful featurettes we got [the series gets five stars by itself, but the DVD actually loses one for its insuffuciency of extra content - better not to have had any extra material than the paltry lot we got] to play for those who never saw the show [and to keep the piemaker and the dead girl in out hearts].",1261612800,,768,4.326388888888889

3570181,3,B001FB4VZI,"Most of the reviews here are a gigantic outpouring of support for a show that did indeed get cut way too soon. However, I don't feel that just because there's disappointment over a show being cut that it warrants labels of ""best show ever"" or anything like that. I respect that someone may have this opinion and truly love this show that much, but I suspect that the average person is not going to fall in love quite to that degree.

I watched every episode of Pushing Daisies that aired, and what drew me to it was the amazing artistic visuals and unique main storyline. However, the crime-solving plots for many of the episodes were just weak, and sometimes embarrassingly juvenile. There were moments when I felt more like I was watching an episode of Scooby Doo than a serious adult drama. The show is trying to be lighthearted and give viewers something unique, but it was often hard to take it seriously at all even when there should have been a genuinely emotional moment. This show makes you suspend your disbelief for way more than it needs to, and that caused me to have an emotional disconnect to the characters much of the time. That's not to say the entire show is a failure, because it's not at all. I just want to make sure people understand its shortcomings.

That all being said, you truly won't find anything quite like Pushing Daisies. It's worth a watch even just for the beautiful artistic visuals. It should have been allowed to finish and at least resolve the major plotlines - that's for sure. It's a disgrace when networks cut shows mid-season. I don't think they take it seriously enough how much they can offend the viewerbase for shows that get cut. Even a show with low ratings is probably being watched by quite a lot of people, and everyone's been snubbed at some point by a failed show. I'll never forgive Fox for their treatment of Firefly, for example.

I recommend this show if you want something unusual and lighthearted, but don't get it just because of the promise that it's the best show ever created or anything like that.",1259798400,22,2062,4.582655826558265

Unfortunately, this is the last season as the show was cancelled.  I thought the end was appropriate and actually enjoyed it quite a bit, however I do know people that would disagree.

The cast continues its amazing work, and I find myself having a new favorite character after every episode.  Kristen Chenoweth deserves a little extra praise for her vocal talents which are on display occassionally throughout the series.  My personal favorite song was ""Birdhouse in Your Soul,"" a They Might Be Giants favorite of mine.

If you haven't seen this show, it is absolutely a must see.  It is a very refreshing change of pace from typical mainstream television programming.

3570215,5,B001FB4VZI,"After watching the first few episodes of TV, I thought to myself, this can't last! This is clever writing, quick and humorous patter,  for what is an original concept for television. The characters are likable and the production values are more of what you might see on a feature film budget. This show is too good to be on TV.

Sadly, it was indeed cancelled. Pushing Daisies could have gone on for another season at least. Bless the producers and writers for trying to wrap up the show in the last episode, but its obvious they were being rushed to wind things up in just a few minutes. It would have been much more satisfying to be able to give the show the time it needed or a TV movie to resolve things in a civilized fashion.

All the cast put in wonderful comedic performances, but of note to me was Kristin Chenoweth as Olive Snook. Her character was crack-you-up funny one second and heartbreaking the next.

Be that as it may, we now have the final season on DVD and are able to enjoy, any time we want, what I'm sure will become a cult classic.",1257379200,,1055,4.340101522842639

If it seems too creative and doesn't deal with ""real life"" issues, then you can bet it is going to get the cut. We all know how ""REAL"" Grey's Anatomy and Desperate Housewives are so I can understand why they have been kept around.
Pushing Daisies was one of those shows that comes along once in a while and you are just so excited for it because it is so promising and so unique. Adventurous storylines and a cast that fits together so well. Each episode was like a chapter out of a fairy tale.

3570255,5,B001FB4VZI,"e sigh. Okay so I love this series. A Lot. Its my favorite series ever. Ever. It features witty dialogue, beautiful aesthetics, great and beautiful actors and actresses, and interesting stories. The second season is a continuation of the first season(and really the two should be viewed together and form a fairly lengthy and somewhat open story. There's only one storyline that doesn't get any resolution but otherwise its a great series. I'd argue the best.
so why Le sigh? That is for this box set. Aesthetically, the box is fantastic. a little thinner than the previous box set, but its inventive packaging which is Unbelievably awesome, is smartly designed like the first season box. But then lets open it up. Okay, it looks and sounds great. this is fantastic. The aspect ratio is slightly different from season one, which I'm not entirely certain why, but whatever we love the show. Its great lets not nitpick that. They've outdone themselves technologically from the first season box set(where they fit 9 episodes on 3 blu ray disks) here they did 13 episodes on 2 disks. A clear improvement in their usage of the technology.
But now comes the real debbie downer of the box set. The extras. Yes they are interesting. The first feature which is advertised on the box and the menu as a sort of tribute to Creator Bryan Fuller is in fact more of a season retrospective clocking in somewhere between 20 and 30 minutes total. Alright, that's acceptable. we still have three other bonus features....ten minutes later....that's it? forty minutes of extras for the entire season? No deleted scenes. no commentaries. Where are the commentaries Bryan? I know you can do them, you did half of wonderfalls with commentaries, so where are they? grrrrr. I HIGHLY recommend this series to everyone.
If you don't know the premise, find some way to watch the pilot episode. The premise of the series is that first episode and it plays out so beautifully that a summary will almost detract from your enjoyment of that first episode, which could have stood on its own without a series.",1252713600,,2074,4.828651685393258

As with the S1 the extra features are rather minimal. There are only 3 items - each is less than an hour long and are OK but I wish they would of had more footage of the cast and direction and maybe some commentary. The footage of Brian Fuller is pretty limited.

I know this show did not garner the ratings that the network wanted but it deserved to have a little icing on its final cake.

The packaging is a little better than S1 but not by much.

Really this set is mainly to get the episodes for posterity. If you can satisfied by that which I am then this set is a must purchase.",1250121600,,789,4.006369426751593

3570317,3,B001FB4VZI,"When I first saw the pilot, I thought the show was visually striking, humorous, and most importantly, original. This feeling continued for the rest of the season, which was unfortunately cut off due to the writer's strike. I eventually gave the season 5 stars and named it one of the best shows on today. Then, 6 months later, the show came back, and for the first 4 or 5 episodes, it continued this streak. That is until the quirk the show had bottled was run dry and instead the show tried to hard with its wacky storylines and characters. Add to that some romantic subplots, daddy issues, and other messy writing, and the show quickly outgrew its welcome.

Again, the show was not cancelled prematurely, but it just ran its course way too quickly. Not the fault of ABC, but the fault of the writers and the creator. It's not enough that the show was so out of whack it didn't appeal to a mainstream audience, but by losing the quirk, they lost me and a lot of other fans of the show. Hopefully, the cast will find success in the future because they did a great job, but because of the end, I will probably forget this show sooner than it deserves.",1249430400,11,1150,4.39906103286385

Each episode must be watched carefully, and maybe even rewatched just to catch all of the witty dialog or visual details.

Yeah, there really is no way to describe it....you'll just have to watch a few episodes.  Honestly, I wasn't so upset that the canceled it because the network would have probably ruined the show somehow by the 3rd or 4th season, and I really didn't want to see it fall from grace.

The box set has 2-3 episodes that weren't aired, but the finale was already aired on network TV, so don't expect additional closure to the story lines.  They are turning it into a comic of some sort btw.",1248652800,,772,4.260273972602739

3570322,5,B001FB4VZI,"This is a show that doesn't look like it should work on paper.  Ned (Lee Pace) is a pie maker who also happens to have a gift.  With one touch, he can bring the dead back to life.  But a second touch kills them forever.  While he owns a pie restaurant that he runs with the help of Olive (Kristin Chenoweth), he moonlights helping private investigator Emerson Cod (Chi McBride) solve murders by interviewing the murder victims.  In the first season, Ned kept one such victim alive.  He just couldn't let childhood sweetheart Charlotte ""Chuck"" Charles (Anna Friel) stay dead.  But she has to keep her life secret from Aunts Vivian and Lily (Ellen Green and Swoosie Kurtz).

Yes, the set up takes a little bit to explain.  But once you buy into the premise, it works.  Every week, the crew takes on a new murder investigation in such locations as a circus or with magicians.  Heck, they even get thee to a nunnery.  They solve the murder of a modern day Robin Hood.  And there's a synchronized swimmer killed by a shark.

But each week also involves ongoing stories about the character's lives.  As the season opens, Olive knows a secret about Chuck's mother.  As things progress, Emerson hunts for his missing daughter, Ned finds some long lost relatives, and Chuck and Olive become roommates.

All this leaves out my all time favorite episode of the show.  ""The Legend of Merle McQuoddy"" makes so many references and jokes to the Disney film Pete's Dragon a fan of that movie must watch it.  Adding to the fun, Jim Dale, one of the stars of that movie, is the narrator of this series.

Honestly, I can't rave about this show enough.  It is whimsical and fun.  Each week's mystery plays perfectly into the on going storylines.  The acting is perfect.  The dialogue is fast and clever, leaving you hanging on every word.  And it looks amazing.  This show was made for HD.  Trust me, this is the way to watch it.

Unfortunately, the ratings for the show were poor, so the 13 episodes here represent the final episodes of the show.  Because of how the show was canceled, the producers weren't given enough time to wrap everything up.  Having said that, the final episode has a nice coda that left me very satisfied.  Now, if only I knew how some of the dangling plots played out.

If you missed this show, correct that now.  Get both this and the first season.  Before you know it, you'll be hooked on this quirky, intelligent, and fun show.",1248134400,7,2437,4.539170506912442
3570323,5,B001FB4VZI,"Pushing Daisies was one of the most innovative, original, funny and beautiful show I've seen. In just nine episodes, I fell in love with the Pie Hole and the stories that happenned there. After hearing that the show was cancelled after its second season I was mad as hell. I like a lot of ABC shows like Ugly Betty, Desperate Housewives and Grey's Anatomy but Pushing Daisies had something different that made it unique.

Is unfortunate how such a good show has to go so soon. ABC didn't care if it won 3 emmys in 2008. For them, it was about the ratings. Even though, I think they made the wrong decision because everybody knows that a show usually need some time to stick around and they should had given this one more time. Great shows like Cheers and Seinfeld didn't were popular in their beginnings, actually, Cheers was almost cancelled after the second season but now, this shows remained as one of the best of all time.

I was thrilled to see that Pushing Daisies received 5 emmy nominations in the 2009 Emmys that will be broadcast on Sunday September 20. In the various categories that is nominated, the lovable Kristin Chenoweth is again nominated in the best supporting actress in a comedy series category. I hope Pushing Daisies will win some if not all of the nominations, so they can proof ABC that they cancelled the wrong show.

You will not be disappointed: this is one of the best series to hit the air in a very long time.  It does live up to all the hype.

Bryan Fuller, creator of Pushing Daisies, is a television genius.  He is a master of creative storytelling, finding fun, quirky ways to introduce audiences to some of the most intriguing and fantastic characters TV has seen in a long time.

Unfortunately, reality TV seems to be on a conquest to dominate more and more airtime, as it's a cheaper alternative for studios to high-production-quality shows.  And the public seems to be more than happily along for the ride.  It's really too bad, because smart, funny, extraordinary shows like this (ie, Pushing Daisies,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Arrested-Development/dp/B000JJ3Y78/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Arrested Development</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Chuck/dp/B000VWC9YW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Chuck</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wonderfalls/dp/B0006GAO18/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wonderfalls</a>) will appear less and less often.

I own the first season (and I'm not a TV program buyer, per se) and I've pre-ordered the second. If you've never seen the program, buy it - you will not be disappointed...well...you WILL be disappointed that ABC made the mindboggling decision to cancel this gem (in the truest sense of the word), but buy it anyway, it is so worth it!

Superb cast, fun snappy dialogue, great narration, brilliant set, it was a feast for your eyes and balm to your weary soul every Wednesday.

The story is well written. Its about Ned a man with a gift. A gift that can bring dead people to life! When he touches the dead they have only 60 seconds for that person to live. If that passes another person within the vicinity will take its place. Once he touches them again it dies permanently! He revive his childhood sweetheart giving her a second chance a new lease on life. Despite their desire to have physical contact with each other they could not.
Narrative is very comparative to Doctor Sues.

3570431,5,B001FB4VZI,"Like many others who have written a review on Pushing Daisies, I feel it is a magical show that only comes around on TV once in a blue moon. I still have withdrawals for not having seen any new episodes since the show got cancelled. And everytime I think of the show, I feel utter bitterness towards ABC for cancelling it so prematurely. It is a show that does not have mass-appeal, but given time and proper advertisement, I believe anyone would grow quite fond of it.

I had watched the Pushing Daisies Season 1 DVD set and watched the extras. I forgot who it was that was speaking about the show, but something he said really clicked. I knew I loved the show and not quite sure. And I knew some folks watched a few episodes and it did not appeal to them. In the Pushing Daisies Season 1 extras, the show was described as a modern-day fairytale. That appealed to me subconsciously because in today's world problems and constant crisis, we all need a fairytale to escape into. I believe those folks who did not instantly take a liking/loving to Pushing Daisies did not expect to see a modern-day fairytale, so was rather putoff by Ned's gifts of or the strange physics of the Pushing Daisies universe. But if ABC had properly marketed the show as a type of modern-day fairytale where all beliefs should be temporarily suspended, I think the ratings would have been much higher and the show's cancellation would not have happened so prematurely.

Anyway, this is my 1st review and I tend to avoid writing reviews even though Amazon constantly sends me email to do so over the years. So you can understand how strongly I feel about Pushing Daisies for me to break that cycle.

Here's hoping that the Pushing Daisies DVD Season 2 set goes out with a helluva bang by providing us fans with an awesome ending and wrapping up some loose ends!",1241568000,7,1837,4.52710843373494

Pushing Daisies, however, was too good to wait for.  I saw the previews and simply lost the self discipline needed to look away.  I watched the shows, I bought them on itunes, and I absolutely loved them.  When the writers strike began I was terrified that the show would be cancelled and incredibly relieved when it wasn't.  Apparently, I relaxed too soon.  I would like to buy this season as well, but I don't know if I can stomach the thought of the people who cancelled this show receiving any of my money.  I'll probably buy it used.

3570526,4,B001FB4VZI,"Bryan Fuller brings us a colorful world of magic, mystery and play on words. Pushing Daisies has achieved that fine balance of tongue-in-cheek playfulness with touching drama.

Although admittedly, Season 2 did not have a strong start, it can still be said to be some of the best that was ever on television. It is unfortunate that so few saw it. Some say that ABC did not advertise it enough, this is certainly true. Some say the Writer's Strike cut it down in its prime.

Many of these may have been a factor but the truth of the matter is, it just didn't have the attention to detail put into each second of script like season 1 did.

Perhaps the producers were pressured. Perhaps their budget had run short. But whatever it was, it was clear that the creativity behind this show would not survive the must-have-ratings-we-only-care-about-the-bottom-line mentality of Network TV.

I am truly sad to see this show go and am looking forward to seeing the last three episodes that were never aired. I think it is a sign that television is no longer -- or perhaps never was -- an avenue for creative artistic expression but rather, just a [...] tube.

Hopefully, it will die out as the internet replaces it.",1238976000,10,1206,4.643192488262911

3570530,5,B001FB4VZI,"PUSHING DAISIES is no longer a part of the ABC schedule.

Even though Amazon often makes it possible to review shows before the season has ended, I make it a personal policy to never write a review until the season has ended. I'm making an exception for Season Two of PUSHING DAISIES simply because we don't know when or if ABC will air the final three episodes. There is talk that they might show the last three episodes in a single night, but possibly as late as sometime during the summer of 2009. Possibly not at all.

Time was when ABC was one of my favorite networks. Along with NBC, I watched more of their series than any other network. CBS has not had any shows that have interested me in a couple of decades and has become the network most opposed to Quality Television (a technical term for shows with specific qualities, none of which are possessed by CBS's entire schedule). FOX has done some interesting shows, but such a huge percentage of them have been cancelled (though admittedly in the years before Kevin Reilly became head of programming -- so far in his two years FOX has a much better track record and it might even become my new favorite network, especially if they keep DOLLHOUSE and TERMINATOR: THE SARAH CONNOR CHRONICLES, my two favorite FOX series, going past this spring). The CW apart from GOSSIP GIRL has yet to develop a single show that even remotely interests me, though the old WB series SMALLVILLE is a decent show that I've watched for years (and which is experiencing an unexpected resurgence in its 8th season, which will hopefully carry over with its now confirmed 9th season). But ABC is not a station I look to with much hope. I will admit that this could change if they eventually greenlight the series FABLES, based on Bill Willingham's great comic series about fairy tale characters living in New York in a neighborhood called Fabletown (though ironically, the target audience for the show would probably be fans of PUSHING DAISIES). But even if FABLES turns out to be as great as it has the potential to be, I won't easily forget the anger I am feeling over PUSHING DAISIES. Even as FOX has developed (and then not cancelled) several new interesting shows, I still an angered over FIREFLY, WONDERFALLS, DARK ANGEL, as well as several other series.

Canceling PUSHING DAISIES has almost overnight made me hate ABC more than I once did FOX. The ratings were not good and it was an expensive show to make, but it was one of the greatest glories in the history of television. It wasn't a show with universal appeal. Some people of good taste felt the pace was too intense (the only show ever made on TV with more words per minute was probably THE GILMORE GIRLS). Some didn't like the narrator (though Jim Dale's narration for me was one of the glories of the show). Some objected to the persistent fantastical tone, though for me it was one of the greatest TV fantasies ever. I delighted in the neverceasing wordplay, the show's love of the English language (the only two shows I know that evinced as much love of the language as PUSHING DAISIES were THE GILMORE GIRLS and BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER). And we had a group of characters I came to care about more and more. Although I'm a serious student of television and have an almost embarrassing shows that I follow, PUSHING DAISIES was different. I thought of Mondays as being only two days before the next PUSHING DAISIES. And when Wednesday came around I had this thrill of anticipation, not unlike a small kid looking forward to a birthday party. Something new and special was able to enter the landscape of my imagination.

I'm not very worried about the future of the cast members. All of the performers have had success before and will again. Kristin Chenoweth has already landed one of the leads in a new David Kelly show dealing with (what else?) a law firm. Creator and executive producer Bryan Fuller has returned to HEROES, which NBC hopes he can breathe some life into the moribund and perhaps terminally ill series. Anna Friel has some movies in the can and will probably return to England where she'll find a string of projects to work on. Lee Pace will be in demand and Chi McBride is never going to be out of work for very long. Eileen Greene and Swoozie Kurtz will both find new jobs, either on TV or on the stage. But the extraordinary alchemy that resulted from their collaboration is gone. I know that ultimately TV is a bottom line business. But when a show is this extraordinary, doesn't any TV network have a moral responsibility to keep it alive.

It would be nice if perhaps the federal government could help by providing tax breaks to each network for keeping a couple of ratings-challenged shows alive simply because they are too good to let die. Surely it isn't in the best interest of the American people or the human race to let a show like PUSHING DAISIES go away when it was producing television as good as we've ever seen in the history of the medium. DAISIES was not merely good TV; it was exemplary TV, stretching the possibilities of what you can do much as other series did like BUFFY, THE SOPRANOS, and BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, or as MAD MEN is right now. The only thing that benefits by this show going away is the ABC bottom line. But how to measure the intense bitterness that they have created? For PUSHING DAISIES was not a show that its fans took casually. It was appointment television, viewing around which fans designed their evening.

Trying to look past my anger and my grief, I am profoundly grateful to Bryan Fuller and Barry Sonnenfeld (the latter was instrumental in not only directing several of the episodes, but creating the Shooting Bible that explained to other directors how to reproduce the unique PUSHING DAISIES look) for having created something so extraordinary. I'm delighted that we at least got 22 episodes that are among the most physically beautiful in the history of TV. While we did not get the conclusion of the stories, we did get a vivid introduction into their unique world. I've watched some episodes 7 or 8 times. I'm sure that I will watch both seasons again and again in the years to come.

Bryan Fuller has pledged to continue the series in one way or another. He has hopes of a made for TV movie to bring the story to a close. If he is unable to make a movie, he has apparently been in talks with DC Comics to continue PUSHING DAISIES as a comic series. (Ever since Joss Whedon continued BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER by continuing Season 8 in a new form, other TV creators have followed form. Rob Thomas has hopes of continuing VERONICA MARS at some point when he isn't so busy creating multiple new shows. Rockne O'Bannon wrote a story for a new brief FARSCAPE comic series.) My hope is that by ""DC"" he really meant their highly distinguished imprint Vertigo, the most prestigious label in comics. I'm delighted that Bryan Fuller wants to keep faith with the show's fans and show us where he wanted to stories to go.

And there is so much we want to know! Although some of this might be answered by the three unbroadcast episodes (which if ABC manages to get out of showing would certainly be contained in the DVD set), there are huge unanswered questions. First and foremost, will Chuck and Ned ever find a way to touch? Will Olive learn about Ned's secret gift and how will she respond? Will Lily and Vivian learn that Chuck is alive again? Will Emerson locate his long lost daughter (the wonderful Gina Torres was cast as Emerson's ex-wife, but I don't know if her episodes were ever filmed)? What was the secret of the three watches? What will happen with Chuck's dad? And what about Ned's Dad? And precisely where did Ned get his remarkable gift and what is its larger significance? A made for TV movie would answer some of these. But I hope that in addition to the movie Fuller will indeed create a comic. I want answers.

But nothing is going to replace the huge loss the show creates. I am a huge collector of TV shows on DVD. I have a large and rich and very high quality collection. When I moved last August I arranged my TV DVD box sets on shelves, leaving room for future additions. Right between my box sets for THE PRISONER and SLINGS AND ARROWS I left a fair amount of empty space for what I was certain was going eventually be 4 or 5 or 6 seasons of PUSHING DAISIES. Now I'll need only a fraction of the space.",1236470400,80,8395,4.539630118890357
