The movie is like 1 hour long, so the stories are like 20 minutes.  The indian  story *****, the raft ****** but was better than the other two, and the  hitchiker story was very dumb and boring.

Save your money and buy that one TRUST ME! This one has been overly brightened, the skin tones have been changed and it doesnt look natural! (like the way I remember seeing it). This is supposed to be a dark movie and its definitely way too bright and tweaked. A perfect example of a movie that didn't need to be upgraded for the second time onto blu-ray. The first release looked great. WHY?!!!! Lol. You can only make an older movie look so good and now they're messing with the original picture to improve quality... makes no sense to me... like I said, buy the image entertainment one.

647712,3,6303422020,"I loved George Romeros CREEPSHOW. I was a fan from the first moment I laid eyes on the trailer. When it was released I was working as a theater manager showing the film and I would pop in to watch moments from the film when time provided. To this day I consider it a classic. Had it not been for the success of the film we might never have seen anthology shows like TALES FROM THE CRYPT, MONSTER or Romeros own TALES FROM THE DARKSIDE come about. When I heard back then that CREEPSHOW 2 was being made I was ecstatic. The end result left much to be desired though.

Once more were presented with tales to frighten straight from the comic book pages of Creepshow, a homage to the horror fueled comics of the fifties. A wrap around story involving a young boy who loves the comic and is tormented by bullies keeps the film moving. Add to that the Creep in the film, this time portrayed by effects artists Tom Savini rather than an animated dummy.

The first story has us in a small town out west gasping its last dying breath. General store owners Ray and Martha Spruce (George Kennedy and Dorothy Lamour) provide a helping hand to those in need in the way of store credit even though they could easily retire and live comfortable on their own. When a criminal Indian from the nearby reservation and his gang rob the store killing the pair it seems justice will not be served. But then they never counted on the wooden Indian standing out front.

The second story is perhaps the best here, based on Stephen Kings novella THE RAFT. Two young couples are headed out to the local lake with the intent of swimming out one last time to the floating raft in the middle despite the chilly temps of the water. Fueled by beer and false bravado they swim out completely ignorant of the large patch of something floating on top of the water. That is until they see it engulf a bird floating on top. When one of the girls is taken from the raft and eaten by this glob a standoff follows. The only way to get help is for one of them to reach the shore. But how will they avoid the creature?

The final story here is about a woman having an affair who plows down a hitch-hiker on her way home. If she reports it or takes the man to the hospital shell have to explain why she was driving where the accident occurred. Rather than do so she drives off hoping someone else will find him. Except that he continues to pop up, more battered and bloody with each appearance, always saying Thanks for the ride, lady. Will she ever be free of this damaged image?

The film ends with an animated piece featuring the aforementioned story of the young boy pursued by bullies on his bicycle. So how does the film hold up? It doesnt come close to the original. That could be in large part because the film went from a high profile studio like Warner Brothers to the low budget line New Horizons, Roger Cormans company. It could be because Romero was no longer directing or that King and Romero weren't on set daily to discuss the script they had written. In any case while a decent movie it placed side by side with the original leaves it lacking.

And yet there is a legion of fans out there who love this one as well. For them the news that the film was being released on blu-ray by Arrow Video was a Godsend. Now they could have it in a pristine format to enjoy over and over again. And, being an Arrow release, you knew that the extras would be better than most and that the version offered would indeed be the best ever found. The film is presented here in a 2k digital restoration with original stereo audio. Other extras include audio commentary from director Michael Gornick moderated by Perry Martin, a new interview with Daniel Beer, a new interview with Tom Wright, and interview with Romero, and interview with Savini, a featurette with make-up effects artists Howard Berger and Greg Nicotero, a featurette on Rick Baker, behind the scenes footage, trailers and TV spots and a reversible sleeve featuring newly commissioned artwork by Mike Saputo.

Fans have already been buying this one up like crazy with special editions that include a collectors booklet fetching top dollar. Im glad that this version now exists but I doubt Ill watch it over and over again. It is worth watching once and fans will delight that they can have this version on their shelves now.",1500163200,,4344,4.43609022556391

647714,5,6303422020,"STEPHEN KING  GEORGE ROMERO  CREEPSHOW 2  1987

The film was even funnier because they haD mixed up the audios ON THE dvd and they have Castilian twice and French once but no English. At least I could not find it. So I watched it in Castilian with English subtitles. I must say the language then gives a density to the Monstrous Creep that is really striking in all meanings of the word.

There is nothing new of course in these stories that we have read, probably several times. The three stories are definitely amazing. The first one, Old Chief Woodnhead seems to imply there is among the older Indian generation some decency that the younger generation cannot understand, nor respect, but the ghosts of the dead can come back to bring justice, though a death for a death is not giving life back to the victims of the greed of the younger generation that is going to Hollywood as is well known. They have always dreamed of meeting John Wayne on one of his Indian killing spree. At least they had the intention to go.

The second story, the Raft, is once again about young people, two couples who decide to go wild on marijuana and on some forlorn and forgotten paths where signs are overgrown with shrubs and trees and are no longer visible. Vain they are and uninformed they remain and they dare do what is advised not to do on the sign they haven't seen. They end up eaten up by some aquatic monster. Yam! Yam! Says the monster. It only takes one overexcited young man to lead the four of them into the water and to their death. Young people have always been what they used to be and what they will be. Boys will be boys and girls the same.

The third story, The Hitchhiker, is a phenomenally funny story, more than frightening. A white rich lady on her way back from an afternoon with a gigolo (by the way rather cheap) gets berserk at the idea that she will be discovered by her husband because he said he was going to arrive home at 11.30 and she cant make it by that time. Find an explanation if you can. She thus has a problem with a black hitchhiker she turned into a ghost and the ghost haunts her all the way and at the end finally gets even with her. The details are absolutely appetizing. You will be ready for a second helping after licking your fingers clean of the blood of the dead man. Dont forget crime and horror are like pizza, the second slice is always better than the first.

Enjoy your petits fours and canap&eacute;s, and wash them down with some Bloody Mary.

647912,5,6303422020,"Anyone that reads my site knows I love anthology films (I feel like Ive opened with that line before) and Creepshow 2 is one anthology Ive always loved. Yes, it may not be as great as the first one, the film still holds a special place in my heart, as evident by the review I did for it already on here. Because Ive already reviewed the movie before, Ill include a few quotes to give you the gist of the film, but the primary focus today will be on the Arrow Video Blu-ray release.

Arrow Video has given fans two versions to choose from on Blu-ray: one, a limited edition with an exclusive comic included of an undeveloped story, and the other, a regular, but still very sweet edition. The review will be on the regular version.

MOVIE REVIEW

For ease of reading, here are some highlights from my older Creepshow 2 Movie Review.

""Creepshow 2, might not live up to the greatness of the first, but it does spin a nice yarn with three separate stories.""

""Old Chief Woodnhead story dragged a little and the action comes late. Also, its the tamest and least bloody of all the stories in the movie.""

""The Raft features some great gore and even a dash of nudity at a completely inappropriate time. Also, the ending is something youll remember forever. This one definitely ranks second best out of three, with the awful, awful acting bringing the score slightly down (only slightly though, cause the acting is so awful, its awesome).""

""What follows is a terrifying joyride, that ends with a great surprise. The Hitchhiker features some great special effects and an even better catchphrase that will stick with you for a long time. If you get one thing out of this story, it will be the haunting (yet funny) saying of the hitchhiker, Thanks for the ride, lady.""

""Creepshow 2, its full of bad, yet awesome acting, great gore, a dash of nudity and fun twists, which like I said before, is the perfect example of an 80s horror film""

BLU-RAY OPINION

Creepshow 2 has been on Blu-ray before, one version by Sony and a UK edition by 88 Films. However, when checking out caps-a-holic, you can clearly see that the Arrow Video edition is the best one. The video transfer has been cleaned up, colours pop wonderfully, and the audio comes through clear. The transfer is a bit wider than the other editions, which does give us a few weird instances of garbage on the left-hand side of the screen, but nothing that will distract you from enjoying the release.

As for special features, you have some fun interviews with Daniel Beer, who discusses his time on shooting The Raft segment. If you thought they looked cold, they were a lot colder, and Beer was suffering from hypothermia because of it. There is also have an interview with the Hitchhiker, Tom Wright and a quick interview with Tom Savini, who looks like he doesnt give a shit. For special effects fans, you have an enjoyable interview with Howard Berger and Greg Nicotero. Rounding the features out are behind the scenes footage, audio commentary with director Michael Gornick and trailers/TV spots.

VERDICT

Creepshow 2 Blu-ray from Arrow Video is a must own for the fans. The film has never looked better and the special features included are highly enjoyable to check out. Pick up the Creepshow 2 Blu-ray today!

647916,5,6303422020,"Creepshow 2 is in many ways underrated while it's not on par with the Original it's still a solid follow up
I've always loved this film (Had almost every home video version of it) Except the Laserdisc which was distributed under Image Entertainment
One of the biggest let downs during the rise of the HD Format  Is the lack of any or very few blu-ray's by either
Image Entertainment and Anchor Bay/Starz

Image was a pioneer in HQ Special Editions on Laserdisc then the dvd format
Early AnchorBay was ambitious during VHS then DVD
But, neither company has really put much into the HD format
The only must own Image blu-ray is
Caligula: The Imperial Edition (That BR has a massive laundry list of worth wild extras)
But, as of late the Image BR Special Edition is now out of print

Image did release Creepshow 2 on blu-ray and it's average at best
In hindsight it was a cheap catalog title
Then Arrow Video  acquired the rights
and took the time and money to actually
Give the film a 2K print restoration
The results a super impressive
Collector's Edition of Creepshow 2
No matter which Arrow Video version you chose you'll come out a winner!
Just don't over spend on the Limited Collector's Edition (The only ""exclusives"" are the Red cardboard case and a mini Creepshow 2 comic book ""Pinfall"" which was one of the stories that was pulled due to budgetary reasons)
These two small items don't  make the limited edition worth the super expensive Scalper's asking price
The regular version by Arrow has all the same worth wild extras
some of the extras are ported over from the Divimax Edition dvd from Anchor Bay (That dvd is 12 years old)
the previous AnchorBay extras include:
Audio Commentary features Perry Martin hosting director Mike Gornick. ****Awesome commentary track****
**My Friend Rick,
*****Nightmares in Foam Rubber
***Trailers and TV Spot,
****Behind the Scenes
**Original Screenplay is available as BD-ROM content

Brand New Arrow Exclusives
*****Exclusively restored in 2K resolution for this release by Arrow Films and is presented in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1.85:1
This transfer is fantastic
I doubt it'll ever look this good in my lifetime
I doubt see Creepshow 2 being put out on a Ultra 4K disc anytime soon that's for sure
***3 different audio options
Mono,
 Stereo 2.0
DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1

****Screenplay for a Sequel w/ George A. Romero.
****Tales from the Creep  w/ Tom Savini ,
****Poncho's Last Ride  w/Daniel Beer  (Randy)  from  The Raft
****The Road to Dover  w/  Tom Wright  aka The Hitchhiker
It's a shame they couldn't get anyone from Old Chief Wooden Head to do a interview

Truth be told the ""Limited Version"" is without a doubt the worst limited edition Arrow Video has put  out
It's not worth the insane asking price Scalpers are selling it for
Just save your money and get the collector's edition

This collector's edition is a true must own to add to any collection while it would've been nice to get a second audio commentary track by some of the actors or Romero himself
The legit print restoration is a huge selling point
If you haven't seen this film since the VHS era you'll be blown away
If you seen the previous blu-ray this will make you extremely happy
Creepshow 2 Finally gets much needed respect with a full blown Collector's Edition/Special Edition

The Old Chief bit is dumb, but The Raft; a cross between The Blob, Jaws and Stephen Kings Cujo; is interesting enough. It has four college partiers stranded in a lake, on a raft, at the mercy of killer slime. The best story is the final one, about a woman who accidentally kills a Hitchhiker on her way home from having sex with someone other than her husband. Its the one tale that is truly creepy.

648101,4,6303422020,"Creepshow 2 is a horror anthology comprised of three supernatural tales. In the first, Old Chief Woodnhead, a cigar-store Indian gets bloody revenge on the rednecks who killed the gentle couple who took care of him and the store he stood in front of for many years. In the second story, The Raft, four college students learn a deadly lesson about reading signs when they head to a remote lake to smoke dope and go for a swim. In the final episode, The Hitchhiker, a philandering wife hits a hitcher and speeds off only to hit him again and again as she travels further down the road.

A sequel to 1982s Creepshow, this film contains stories by Stephen King and a screenplay by George A. Romero (Night of the Living Dead). The stories are linked together by animated sequences of a young comic book reader, and the Creep, courtesy of special effects master Tom Savini, returns to introduce the segments.

Unfortunately, this collection of tales pales in comparison to the original. They never really create the kind of terror and visceral creepiness King is famous for in his short stories. The Raft, for instance, is truly frightening in print. On screen, however, much is lost and the special effects are disappointing.

The Hitchhiker is extremely violent, but not especially scary. The idea of a creepy hitchhiker has been incorporated far more successfully in a 1960 Twilight Zone episode and the Lucille Fletcher radio play on which it was based.

Old Chief Woodnhead is notable for the presence of Dorothy Lamour, who hadnt made a feature film in over 20 years. Famous for the Bing Crosby/Bob Hope Road pictures of the 1940s, she plays Martha Spruce who, along with husband Ray (George Kennedy), becomes a victim of violence.

Bonus features on the newly restored Blu-ray release include audio commentary with director Michael Gornick; new interviews with actors Daniel Beer and Tom Wright; interviews with screenwriter George A. Romero and actor and make-up artist Tom Savini; archive featurette on the special effects of Creepshow 2; behind-the-scenes footage; image gallery; trailers and TV spots; and reversible sleeve featuring original and newly commissioned artwork.",1481932800,,2179,5.041666666666667

648106,3,6303422020,"A near perfect highlight reel of Stephen King's storytelling skills and George Romero's homegrown horror approach, Creepshow was definitely a hard act to follow.  Perhaps that why both men pulled back a bit from the sequel produced five years later, Creepshow 2 (1987), with Romero adapting three lesser King tales and passing off directing duties to his longtime cinematographer, Michael Gornick.  The film can't help but suffer by comparison, so it's best to stack it up against Romero's other horror anthology series, Tales from the Darkside, which beat HBO's Tales from the Crypt to the punch by a good seven years, mining the same E.C. Comics aesthetic of ghastly goings-on with a darkly humorous moral lesson.

With fewer stories and a cast of virtual unknowns, Creepshow 2 feels much more like a small screen production; and from that perspective, it's a fairly successful one.  Old Chief Wood'nhead is a golem-type revenge story with a cigar-store Indian coming to life to avenge the death of his longtime owner, played by a cuddly George Kennedy.  The Raft finds a quartet of horny teens trapped on a frigid lake by a ravenous floating oil slick.  And The Hitchhiker follows a cheating wife who gets her comeuppance after fleeing from the scene of a particularly bloody hit-and-run.  Animated cut scenes featuring The Creep, a carbon copy of horror comic hosts from decades past, bracket each story.

Without Romero's steady hand at the helm, and lacking the original's stellar cast of recognizable old Hollywood faces, the onus falls more than ever on King's stories.  And, unfortunately, only The Raft delivers what audiences probably expected, with its unique aquatic blob monster dissolving each victim in gruesome fashion.  The other two bookends simply fall flat, failing to deliver anything worthy of the big screen.  From the opening gag - with make-up legend Tom Savini poorly disguised as a live action Creep delivering a new edition of the Creepshow comic - there's a cut-rate feel to the sequel that only intermittently achieves feature film quality.  Even the extended animation segments, a nice idea to build off the original, fail to impress.

As usual, Romero has a great feel for King's regional dialogue and quirky characterization, and his script isn't really to blame; it's director Michael Gornick, whose bland set-ups and unpolished effects photography mute the lush colorful palate of the original.  Since Creepshow 2 was shooting at the same time as Romero's TV series, it's no surprise that the majority of the film would feel more comfortable on a Zenith.

In that respect, the movie played much better on home video, turning up as a special edition from Anchor Bay over 10 years ago.  But Arrow Video, as they're prone to do, goes overboard with extras and a newly remastered 2K transfer that has the film looking better than ever!  A few of the old supplements pop up - including the audio commentary with Gornick, an entertaining effects featurette with Howard Berger and Greg Nicotero - along with two new interviews with actors Tom Wright and Daniel Beer and two archival sit-downs with Romero and Savini.  A nice image gallery and collection of trailers go along with new artwork and liner notes by Michael Blyth.",1480464000,,3254,5.027932960893855

No. But it does have some great special effects, fun cameos (look for Stephen King as a truck driver in the 3rd story) , and is most of all very entertaining.",1470700800,3,571,4.607843137254902

""The Raft"" is alrigfht, but there's the out of place sequence when one of the survivors begins to sexually molest the other survivor.

648871,3,6303422020,"First of all, I rarely get scared from watching 'scary' movies. I've seen many such as 'The Conjuring' or 'The Ring', etc and most movies like that just don't do much for me. This film as well as its predecessor fits in a category of just a fun little movie..not really meant to scare at all. I didn't purchase this film to be scared, I just purchased it as an amusing film and that is what it was for the most part. 'Creepshow 2' is similar to the first film except for it only has three tales. The first story 'Ole Chief Woodenhead' was about a wooden Indian statue taking vengeance for the death of a sweet couple by the hands of some punks. George Kennedy was great in this role. I really did feel sorry for them because things like that do happen in real life ( a poor defenseless person being brutally killed by some punks who have nothing better to do with their lives than causing murder for no reason). So it was the most 'emotional' of the three. My favorite was the second tale called 'The Raft', a Stephen King story that I read earlier in his book 'Skeleton Crew'. I enjoyed it because it was, in my opinion, the best story and also well done and faithful to the original story. However, near the end there was some very unnecessary nudity, but that's the way it was written. The final story, 'The Hitchhiker' was a story of an adulterous woman (played by Lois Chiles) who hits a hitchhiker on the way home and drives away. Of course, the dead hitchhiker haunts her for a ride. This reminded me of a Twilight Zone episode of the same name. Of course, unlike the Twilight Zone episode, this was a gory story. I was disappointed in only having three stories and a short 'cartoon' story where, once again, some punks are picking on a defenseless kid, but it was still entertaining. It's worth having the sequel to the first movie. If you liked the first one, you will probably enjoy this one also.",1414368000,2,1907,4.374647887323944

Although they are based on more of King's short stories and adapted into a screenplay by Romero, this second collection is headed by George Romero collaborator Michael Gornick, director of photography for DAY OF THE DEAD, DAWN OF THE DEAD, and the original CREEPSHOW. Their work in the past unfortunately hasn't rubbed off well on Gornick, who turns out a routine shocker that would have been better suited for television. In the first story, three would-be thieves are stopped by a vengeful wooden Indian in ""Old Chief Wood'nhead."" Four friends face off against a carnivorous oil slick when they board ""The Raft."" Finally, a woman pays for deadly her hit-and-run accident when the corpse of ""The Hitchhiker"" returns to torment her! The first and third tales are, again, routine revenge stories with a splash of blood and a touch of the supernatural. Outside of character actor George Kennedy, the performances are rather goofy in ""Old Chief Wood'nhead,"" with moderate effects used to bring the Chief to life. ""The Raft"" tends to be the most memorable, a veritable BLOB on a budget that offers several surprising moments. ""The Hitchhiker"" is, by far, the most horrific of the three, mainly thanks to the gruesome costume designs by Greg Nicotero and Howard Berger. While it is nowhere near as witty and fun as the original, CREEPSHOW 2 is still a worthwhile sequel for genre fans.

649148,4,6303422020,"Young Billy is eager to pick up the latest issue of the horror anthology comic book, ""Creepshow"", before anyone else in town, and we go along with him for the ride, which also includes an encounter with some bullies and a pit stop to pick up a special delivery ordered from the pages of the comic itself! That's the framing story the Creepshow Creep frequently interrupts to tell 3 new tales of  terror from horror legends Stephen King and George Romero in this 1987 sequel to the 1982 horror classic!

Maybe ""new"" isn't the perfect term for these stories. They were actually selected from among the rejects of the first Creepshow. The first story is about a general store's wooden Indian chief who avenges the elderly couple he loves when they are done a terrible wrong. The second is about a group of college students who head out to a secluded lake to swim and get wasted on a raft for the day, unaware of a mysterious creature that lurks in, or rather ON the water. Finally, when an adulteress accidentally runs down a hitchhiker on her way home from her gigolo's place, she decides to avoid exposure (and possible jail time) by leaving the scene. This doesn't sit well with the mangled hitchhiker, who absolutely refuses to die without teaching her a well-earned lesson.

Yeah, these stories may be leftovers, but they aren't bad, and like the first, if you're a fan of Amicus horror anthologies, you'll appreciate this film just as much. It certainly is not as good as the original film, and there are far fewer stories this time around, but it doesn't fail to entertain. ""Old Chief Wood'nhead"" has some very entertaining moments and some noteworthy cast members, even if it's not very scary (in my opinion). There's some debate over which of the other two stories are the highlight of the film, but my money definitely goes to ""The Raft."" ""The Hitchhiker"" is probably my least favorite here. I just don't find it that interesting. It might feel the most like an Amicus tale, but not necessarily one of their real winners. ""The Raft"" has some cheese to it, and the creature may just be a rip-off of ""The Blob"", but this story still manages to be creepy enough to work, and the visuals of the death scenes are unforgettable! Then, there's the wraparound story about Billy, the Creep, and Billy's trip into town. This starts out in live-action (Tom Savini in heavy make-up as the Creep!), but quickly turns into a consistently animated storyline. However, the animation isn't necessarily great. Then again, considering the tight budget of this whole film, I suppose it's pretty good, ha. And, Billy's story is still lots of fun, even if the animation (mainly due to the quality), adds to the general feel of this installment as being, I don't know, a bit more kiddie than the first film (no, I am not at all the type to view animation as being strictly for kids; again, it's largely because of the quality and general style of those sections, not the fact that they are animated; the animation in the first film was very creepy, as I recall).

Over all, Creepshow 2 is a fun film to watch, though inferior to its predecessor in many ways. Considering the limitations of this installment though, it does pretty well for itself. I definitely can recommend it to the horror anthology fan. The DVD from Anchor Bay is pretty awesome too! Far better than the release for the original film! It actually comes with bonus features, and good ones! There's a director commentary, two trailers, still galleries, the script on DVD-ROM, and a very nice featurettes on the effects team that brought Creepshow 2 to the screen. Definitely a nice inclusion in a horror film collection, especially for those like myself who really love horror anthology films! And, as a bonus, besides having some great, E.C. Comics inspired cover art, the DVD also comes with an informative insert within the case that includes the great Creepshow 2 Poster art, too, which I assume you could slide into the outer area of the case if you want that to be your cover.

Finally, I'll add that there IS a Creepshow 3, but it's not made by the original filmmakers and is generally considered your standard, direct to video schlock of the lowest quality. I can't confirm this though, as I haven't seen it, though I remember seeing bits of it one time online somwhere. If you just can't get satisfied with ONE sequel though, Tom Savini recommends ""Tales from the Darkside: The Movie"", which some folks have said is the TRUE Creepshow 3. It's definitely one I recommend too and intend to review very soon. In the meantime, enjoy Creepshow 1 and 2!",1354147200,,4607,4.68974042027194

Now one thing most everyone can agree on out of the 3 stories (what happend to 5 stories???) the raft is the stand out here. It's worth the price of admission alone and worth a 4 star if it wasn't for the other 2. And that's not to say the first and third story are bad. They're really good stories honestly, just not executed well. I mean the actors they had in them were good but they have a sort of a take one, good, now print feeling. Basically just a little sloppy and rushed to make a quick buck off the popularity of the first movie.

This is a really great popcorn flick. Why it gets a hard time I don't know, it's a fun movie to watch now as it was back when I was a kid seeing this for the first time. Just remember this isn't Titanic. Gather around the tube, have a few brews with friends and throw your own MST3K comments at this flick and have fun. This is what this movie is all about.

The budget shortfalls really show in the film's main antagonists. The original creepshow featured  scary Zombies, a human plant, and a ferocious looking ape-like beast who jumps out of a crate and eats people.

The best that Creepshow 2 can come up with is a floating tarpaulin in a lake that melts peoples' skin off their bones.

649353,4,6303422020,"Masters of Horror Stephen King and George A. Romero return to deliver more comic book style thrills in ""Creepshow 2."" With original ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Creepshow/dp/0790744295/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Creepshow</a>"" cinematographer Michael Gornick stepping in as director, the film is not only slimmer on content (three stories instead of five) but on budget and star-power as well. That doesn't mean that horror fans aren't in for a heaping serving of campy carnage candy, though. In tradition with the original, ""Creepshow"" is hellbent on making its viewers laugh and squirm in their seats simultaneously.

While Gornick is no George A. Romero, he certainly brings a touch of style to the film that serves it well. Animated segments aside, the look and tone of the original is carried over into its sequel, with some surprisingly flashy moments that make one wonder why the director fell off the face of the Earth (you know, aside from the fact that this flick flopped). The script, penned by Romero, has its ups and downs, with some stories being more effective and more competent than others. Variety, however, is the key to the film's success. If one thing can be said about this affair, it is that it never bores and it certainly goes by quickly enough. In fact, some would say the fun ends far too early.

The three stories are a mixed bag of creepy and goofy, with the first concerning a wooden Indian propped outside of a small-town general store. When local punks rob its kindly owners, the statue comes to life seeking revenge. This bit is rather slow moving and sets the movie off on the wrong foot. Although not terrible by any means, it is in sharp contrast to the two that follow. Next up, we follow a foursome of guys and gals going for a swim in a secluded lake. Soon they find themselves being feasted upon by what can only be described as an oil slick surrounded by a Hefty bag. Of the three, this is probably the strongest, with some genuinely creepy moments and terrific special effects. Then, to wrap things up, we find a woman of questionable morals being stalked on the highway by a drifter she accidentally hit. While his insistence on thanking her for the ride makes him seem harmless enough, the woman quickly slips into madness as she tries to rid herself of the passenger to no avail. This is the one segment most likely to induce a few unintentional chuckles for its ridiculously over-the-top premise and execution.

Overall, there's a noticeable drop in quality from the first, but the sense of dread and humor is still intact. ""Creepshow 2"" is certainly a worthy sequel with a few moments of brilliance that may have panned out better in feature length films. ""The Raft,"" in particular, would have been a great 80's teen monster movie in the vein of the remake of ""The Blob"" that would roll into theaters a year later. Taken for what it is, though, this sequel is like a bag of Halloween candy -- some hits, some misses, but certainly worth the time regardless.",1283817600,,3046,4.865125240847784

...O.K., it's not so scary that you'll stay up at night, but the three tales included are creepy in their own fun little way.

Each story plays like a full movie, and guess what? That means three times the fun and terror...

The first of these tales, ""Ol Chief Woodenhead"", is a perfect way to start the movie, it being the best of the trio. An old shopkeeper living in a town that has long since died still remains loyal to his store, along with his life-size model of an Indian Chief, despite his wife's protests to sell the place. He refuses, the store has kept money in his pockets; he can't give it up now. Besides, he has ties with the town and its Indian tribe living in the outskirts, they owe him some money. The local Indian Chief soon shows up, and he comes bearing the tribe's greatest and most prized possessions, for the old shop owner to keep for now, until the tribe has collected enough money to pay him in cash. After much arguing, the shopkeeper reluctantly agrees to take it, therefore honoring the tribe. But trouble soon follows, as three robbers, one of them even one of the tribe, steal the treasures. They make off literally like bandits, and each goes quickly back to their homes to get ready to leave to Hollywood with their money. But they're not going anywhere if `Ol Chief Woodenhead can stop it...Coming to life and stepping off the porch he stood on for all those years, he grips his axe and gets ready to do what needs to be done..Not scary, but great story-telling! Grade: A

The next tale, ""The Raft"" pits spring-breakers against a man-eating oil slick, and you have to wonder which one came up with the idea, SK or GR. The teens, in college, park their car by an isolated lake, and, seeing a lone raft in the middle of the lake, decide to hop in and swim to it. But one of them sees something in the lake (the oil slick) drag down a duck, and ""eat"" it. Fearful, they start to get scared. And that's when the first one dies. The slick, which is very hungry, (I don't think the duck filled it up) wraps around her leg (the first one to die) and pulls her off the raft, dragging her under. Did I mention that the slick can ""move"" around the lake, following food? The only problem I had with this one was that the oil slick looked pretty fake at times, and the whole plot got kind of cheesy at times too. Still, creepy and well thought out. Grade: A-

The last tale, ""The Hitch-Hiker"" just falls short of the par that the first two were on. A woman driving down the streets of lonely `ol Maine has thought on other things, like coming up with an excuse for being late coming home, (she's having an affair, and forgot the time to come home to her husband, who's never late coming home) hits a hitch-hiker, killing him. After seeing the damage, (to the hitch-hiker and her fancy expensive car) she decides to just drive away, or, do a hit-and-run. But the hitchhiker, who's still dead, has other plans for her...But the plan for this tale just isn't as great as the first two tales. I think the story isn't as good as the first two, (a lack of imagination for Stephen King? That's a first!!!) and in the end it just didn't click. It was still pretty good though, and the ending makes it worthwhile. Grade: B-

To put the cherry on the top, all of this is wrapped around an animated tale of a boy and his comic. The art looks great, and in the end the whole movie is great, with minor flaws, mostly in the special effects department; the acting was good, for the most part. An excellent nod to the eighties, and plain out horror in general.",1237593600,,5485,5.691086691086691
649358,2,6303422020,"What made the first&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Creepshow/dp/0790744295/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Creepshow</a>&nbsp;good was how nicely it encapsulated the spirit of the comic book, right down to the cheesy, brightly colored panels.  The tales were short, you followed along as the wind turned the pages, and the acting was actually pretty good.

And then they made this thing.

King wrote the stories and Romero adapted them for the screen, but other than that and the title, this thing is about as far from the first as you can get.  Gone is the comic book feel.  Instead they've introduced a connective wrap-around cartoon that would've worked better if it'd just been live action.  Also, an annoying character called The Creep introduces and signs off on each segment.  The Creep is a pointless, campy version of The Cryptkeeper (from HBO's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tales-from-the-Crypt/dp/B0009ETCOW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tales from the Crypt</a>), and The Cryptkeeper was already campy enough.  Now picture him poorly animated and with a chin like an old man's, well, never mind.

The tales here are longer (bad call) and there are fewer of them (equally bad call).  Here's the rundown:

OLD CHIEF WOODENHEAD - Horrible exposition that is slathered on long after the audience gets it already.  A kindly store owner and his wife are beset upon by no-good-niks who trash the place, steal some valuable Native American trinkets, and then do other bad things.  Not only does this clip broadcast its ending from the first scene, but it takes its sweet time getting there, and then doesn't even show you the stuff that would normally make it creepy.

THE RAFT - Really cool idea (about four kids who are trapped on a raft by sinister goo) is ruined by atrocious acting and some super silly writing.  Creeped me out when I watched it as a kid, but after leaving the theatre, all I could remember was the gratuitous boob shot.

THE HITCH-HIKER - A woman hits a hitchhiker during a minor cigarette mishap and flees the scene of the crime.  ""Can you live with this?"" she asks herself during her interminable and unbelievable dialogue with herself.  Apparantly not.  Good effects, but -- like the first segment -- predictable and dull.

Stupid host.  Stupid execution.  Stupid all around.  Skip this thing and rewatch the first.",1235001600,,2427,5.413333333333333
649359,5,6303422020,I cannot say as much on Creepshow 2 as i did on the original but it is still a good pickup if you like a B movie. The best story in this one is where we all remember when the kids are trying to escape that Oil slick in the pond...,1233187200,,230,3.5294117647058822
649440,4,6303422020,"I think Creepshow is one of the best and most fun horror films of all time, so naturally Creepshow 2 was gonna have a hard time living up to it.  It doesn't help matters that the powerhouse writing/directing team of Stephen King and George Romero isn't here.  Well, sort of.  Romero takes writing duties(based on Stephen King stories) and the directing is left to Romero's DP, Michael Gornick.  It only has 3 stories instead of 5 and seems to be missing that tongue in cheek touch of the first film.
But I still love the movie!  The first story is about a cigar store wooden Indian that comes to life for some Charles Bronson-esque revenge when some hoodlums rob the general store and kill the owner, played by George Kennedy(""Be sure...Breath Assure!"") and his wife.  The second story comes from King's short story collection, Skeleton Crew.  It's about two couples that drive out to a lake in October to swim out to a wooden raft in the middle of the lake.  Why?  I've never been quite sure.  You practically get cold watching them.  Once on the raft they are attacked by a round, black water creature that looks like a garbage bag half submerged in the water.  Like The Blob, it's hungry and eats anyone it can grab, or whoever gets too close to it.  The third story has a snooty, rich Lois Chiles hitting a hitchhiker on the highway.  She flees the scene, but the dead dude simply isn't gonna leave her alone, and she engages in a war/chase with the zombie-like hitchhiker.
Like the first film, these three stories are supposed to be from a comic book, but they are linked together by animated sequences involving Billy(the boy with the Creepshow comic in the first film) being harassed by bullies and getting his revenge.  Also in the animated sequences is ""The Creep"", a kind of Cryptkeeper character who introduces the stories.  This animation is the cause of some of the criticism of this movie.  I don't mind it terribly, but it is kinda unnecessary and seems there only to pad out running time.  If you ask me, the three stories are all rather solid.  A lot of folks don't particularly care for the first story, but in the immortal words of Meatloaf, ""Two out of three ain't bad"".  I actually like that first story very much.  ""The Raft"" is a great little tale that could have even made it into the first film.  Though it changes King's story a bit, it keeps the spirit of the story for sure(the Blob/garbage bag monster in the story had swirling colors in it's body that had a hypnotic, druglike effect on those who looked at it.  There was some sex and a different ending as well.  But the ending was anticlimactic for a film.  The movie's ending was great.).  The Hitchhiker segment is also quite strong and had the quirkiness of some of the stories in the first film like Father's Day and Something To Tide You Over.
Creepshow is one tough act to top, but Creepshow 2 ends up being a very entertaining film regardless.",1232755200,,2932,4.537142857142857
649441,3,6303422020,"Creepshow was a howling horror classic.  With a great set of stories, and fun twists in the story lines.  The animation in this second film set the bar much lower than the first.  It is only the first let down among the many revealed in the stories told.  These stories could be considered the story lines rejected for the first film.  All of them are below the standard of the first.  If you are looking for an equal to the first Creepshow you will be disappointed.  If you expect less it may be entertaining to see... once.  I have seen loads of crap DVD's so it still gets 3 stars.",1227312000,,584,4.245454545454545

649444,5,6303422020,"In a small town in Main, a young boy named Billy eagerly awaits for his copy of his favorite comic book ""Creepshow"". The Creep (Played by Tom Savini and voiced by Joe Silver) arrives with his truck as he magically gives him his comic and tells the viewer three ghastly stories. The first story ""Chief Wooden'head"" tells a modern supernatural western tale of revenge as two kind elderly store owners (George Kennedy and Dorothy Lamour) are offered a great deal by a rich Native American man which can promise them a good future, unfortunately three crooks murdered them as the store's wooden Indian comes to life for revenge. The second tale ""The Raft"" is about four horny college students looking for some sexual fun at a lake soon discovers that a mysterious man-eating oil-like goo terrorizes them on a lake of blood. Finally ""The Hitchiker"" deals with a a cheating rich wife (Lois Chiles) driving her way home from scoring with a gigolo accidently hits an innocent hitcher on the road and his spirit won't stay dead until he wants revenge.

Exciting sequel to the excellent 1982 cult classic from George A. Romero and Stephen King only this time Romero is writer with three stories that were originally intended for the first movie but never made the final draft. ""The Raft"" is the most intense and creepiest of the stories since it's based on a Stephen King short story as it's a nifty one with the idea of being trapped on a raft in the middle of a lake with a hungry blob like on ""The Blob (1958)"" wanting to eat you. ""Chief Wooden'Head"" is good but predictable with it's not-too realistic wooden indian but the kills are good and ""The Hitchiker"" is the best story of them all including with that memorable line the hitcher says ""Thanks For The Ride Lady"". Sure some of the animated wraparound story parts are cheesy but this movie is a solid sequel to a true horror classic that is worth watching.

It stars George Kennedy, Dorothy Lamour, Holt McCallany and Don Harvey.

It is considered an even better movie than the first according to some horror fans. I, personally, thought it was on par with the first film.

If you like anthology horror, eighties gems, Stephen King, George Romero, and enjoy the classic EC comics or the HBO Tales From The Crypt which were inspired and adapted from the EC comics, then youll like or even love this collection. It contains 3 strange tales: classic honor and revenge story featuring an animated cigar store indian that makes everything right in the end(Chief Woodenhead), rebellious teens who pay for their lack of attention and recklessness - complete with stereotypical drug use, a little full frontal nudity, and a monster that could be the grandson of blob (The Raft), and a cheating wife who accidentally runs over a hitchhiker, picking up his revengeful soul in the process and paying for her sins(The Hitchhiker).

If your standards are over the moon, don't bother with this title. Youll find no olive branches or film festival awards on the cover. What you will find is an hour and a half romp through a peculiar slice of american film making.

The film consists of three short stories;

""Chief WoodNHead"" A story about a shop owners wooden Indian that comes to life for the evening to exact revenge. (Probably my favorite one)

""The Raft"" A story involving some kids who decide to take a swim out to a raft in the middle of the lake only to find a man eating substance stands in their way.

""The Hitchhiker"" A story of an unfaithful wife who runs down a hitchhiker and finds that she can't quite get rid of him.

I would definately recommend checking out Creepshow 2 if you haven't already. It's really a classic horror flick.",1192147200,,868,4.142857142857143

Well, it still holds up today. Some other reviews panned the Creep vol. 2 because ""it wasn't scary and the acting is bad."" Um, guys? It's an 80's horror movie. If the acting wasn't horrible enough to make the movie laughable, Sid wouldn't touch it with a pink turkey baster. Don't take us wrong, we still thought it was very very good and even a little creepy to the point where you would say to yourself, ""Man, that would be not cool"" when watching this movie. But, let's face it, even for the most avid horror fans you don't actually get scared by these movies. And if you do, chances are you have some serious issues and will grow up like Eclipse kissing pictures of girls in magazines. So, let's all relax on the fact that this movie wasn't SCARY. It was highly entertaining and extremely creative. I mean, a cigar store Indian comes to life and scalps some dude. And if you don't love the guy who says, ""I feel the need the need for weed,"" you shouldn't ever be reading one of Sid the Elf's reviews.

Creepshow was definitely not the typical horror movie. It has 3 stories that were roughly 30 minutes with not a wasted second. We greatly prefer this to a killer stalking his victims for an hour then spending the next 30-60 minutes finishing them off. We've already established these movies couldn't possibly scare anyone, so wouldn't you opt for something a little creepy and highly entertaining than a Freddy/Jason/Halloween ripoff every time out of the gate?

649522,3,6303422020,"""Creepshow 2"" **1/2 out of ****
""Creepshow"" was a classic horror film because of it's originality and teaming of Stephen King and George A. Romero creating a feel of the 1950's EC horror comics. ""Creepshow 2"" is definitely not a classic, but it manages to carry a little bit (but not enough) of that feeling. The stories aren't as well constructed or concieved, but that doesn't mean they're not enjoyable.
""Ol' Chief Woodenhead"" **1/2 out of ****
Starring George Kennedy; A kindly old couple who own a general store are robbed and murdered by three thieves, but the Indian statue outside their store comes to life and seeks revenge. A standard revenge story made better by the presence of George Kennedy.
""The Raft"" ***1/2 out of ****
The best of the three stories! Two couples are trapped on a raft on a secluded lake being stalked by a man-eating oil slick-like creature (kind of like the love child of Jaws and The Blob) in the water. It's terrorfying and creative with a great twist ending.
""The Hitch-Hiker"" *** out of ****
Starring Lois Chiles with an appearance by Stephen King as a truck driver; The second best story here. A cheating wife is on her way home from a late night session with her lover when she hits a hitch-hiker in the road. She decides to make it a hit and run, though as she drives further away, she wrestles with her conscience about it aloud. Would she get away with it? Is the man dead or alive? Should she turn herself in? Then her conscience begins to haunt her in the form of the dead hitcher who keeps coming back saying ""Thanks for the ride, lady!"" It is chilling at first but becomes a bit redundant and predicatable.
The big problem with ""Creepshow 2"" is it's too shot at only three stories instead of five. Also ""Creepshow 2"" might have been better if it were directed by George A. Romero as the original.

Other lesser-known films from the 1980s that got some really cool special feats on their DVD disks are: CAT'S EYE, CHOPPING MALL, CHEERLEADER CAMP, THE STUFF, DOLLS, SOCIETY, ROCK & RULE, FIRE & ICE and TIME RIDER.

I do have a few disapointments with this movie, both of which have to do with the fact that they were working on a limited budget back when they made this movie. The first is, as most know, the fact that this film has only three tales, while the first had five. The other thing is that the first film had lots of comic book touches throughout, such as pages turning across the screen, narritive captions shown on screen, weird comic book lighting in the backrounds at certain climative parts, even scenes shown in seperate panels at certain moments. Well, this film has none of that, the stories are just shown in the same way you'd show a regular movie.

Still, the stories are great for what they are. I'd say they're as good as the ones shown in the first film, and I'm glad to own this disk. The stories are:

OLD CHEIF WOODENHEAD: Three young punks in a decrepit desert town rob and kill two elderly store owners, only to have their wooden cigar indean come to life and exact revenge. The fact that it's the wooden indean that avenges the couple and not the people themselves who come back from the dead, as would normally be the case in this type of story, earns this tale at least a few originality points.

THE RAFT: Based on an earlier Stephen King story found in the Skeleton Crew short story collection. Four college students spend a day on a raft in the middle of a remote lake, only to find themselves preyed upon by a black blob lurking in the water that likes human flesh and can slip through the cracks between the boards. In my opinion the best of the three.

THE HITCHHIKER: The story that is probably the most like the classic E.C. comic horror tales. A woman driving home late at night accidentally runs over a hitchhiker. Unfortunately for her, the guy comes back and wants revenge, and she can never seem to get away from him no matter how far she drives. It's like this one episode of THE TWILIGHT ZONE turned pure horror as opposed to subtle suspense.

649528,1,6303422020,"The portmanteau or anthology film whilst having the potential to be utilised by all cinematic genres, has found its place in modern cinema within the horror genre. Perhaps it is the genres success within the realm of short stories, or perhaps less positively the fact the horror relies less on character development and more on spectacle. Early examples include Paul Leni's expressionistic ""Waxworks"" from 1924, but possibly the most successful still remains Ealing Studio's ""Dead of Night,"" which when released in 1945 addressed post-war anxiety and themes of time and memory. For many years British cinema was most associated with the form thanks to the efforts of Amicus Studios, who churned out several such films between 1964 and 1974. However these simplistic morality tales, whilst based on the exaggerations of E.C. Comics lacked the visual punch to support the black humour.

Inevitably American cinema was to get in on the act when the bottom fell out of the British film industry. The first ""Creepshow"" film was a beautifully and highly stylised effort which placed major emphasis on recreating the visual dynamics of E.C. Comics. Romero and his team succeeded so well in fact that only recent adaptations of Frank Miller's graphic novels comes anywhere near to ""Creepshow."" The use of colours, economical direction and histrionic performances by engaging veteran actors papered over the obvious shortcomings of the dialogue.

Unfortunately ""Creepshow 2"", which is directed by Michael Gornick in a state of what can only be described as catatonia fails on almost every level where the first succeeded. The first two stories are miserable and moody and lack humour, which means that the poetic justice meted out at the finale of each, is curiously flat. However the second story, entitled ""The Raft"" and the only one directly based on a Stephen King short story does have an exciting climax, but one has to wade through dire acting and irritating characters to get there. The third story ""The Hitchhiker"" is the most ridiculous and absurd of the three, but works the best. It is the only one that comes anywhere near to the E.C. Comics mentality and the original ""Creepshow"" in terms of excess and exaggeration. The bridging narrative is crudely animated and dull like the rest of the film. The film is not entirely devoid of interest though, but the flat and dreary television film look ultimately undoes any lasting interest.",1150848000,2,2437,5.09

649676,3,6303422020,"Although CREEPSHOW 2 has the Stephen King/George Romero connection, it doesn't quite have the flair and fun of its predecessor, nor as talented a cast.  King's stories are adapted by Romero, but Romero didn't direct, so these three tales don't have the finesse one would have expected.

The first one revolves around a bunch of nasty youths who rob a kindly storekeeper and his wife, and then kill them.  The storefront wooden indian takes revenge, but it's all pretty lame and George Kennedy and Dorothy Lamour are virtually wasted.

The second story, ""The Raft"" has some moments of suspense and tension, but the cast are virtual unknowns and can't carry it as well as more seasoned actors.

The final segment features Lois Chiles as a lawyer's wife who on the way home from a dalliance with a male prostitute hits and kills a hitchhiker and tries to get away before she's caught.  Of course, the hitchhiker keeps popping up, and she keeps killing him, and you know where it will all end.

Although mildly entertaining, CREEPSHOW 2 pales in comparison to its progenitor and one wonders how it would have turned out if Romero had directed and a more potent cast in place.",1121731200,,1171,4.738916256157635

649678,3,6303422020,"Although I liked Creepshow okay, I thought the film's pace was weighed down by a couple of long boring stories that really to me, just seemed like filler to make the film longer. The reason I like Creepshow 2 just a tad more was that it was short, only 3 stories long, and more to the point. Per capita, Creepshow 2 did better because it only had one story that wasn't that great, while Creepshow had two, and those two dragged down the orginial Creepshow a lot more than the last story did in Creepshow 2.

Creepshow 2 includes three stories, ""Old Chief Woodenhead,"" ""The Raft,"" and ""The Hitchhiker."" I realled liked the first two stories, especially ""The Raft"" which I have just now decided is my favorite Creepshow segment ever. If only had the last story, ""The Hitchhiker"" had been better, this would have been a four star film. I just found the last story too repititious as far as the storyline went because the dead hitcher just coming back again and again and said ""thanks for the ride"" like 20 times.

Creepshow 2 isn't as bad as many make it out to be, and the second story, entitled ""The Raft"", is worth checking this out for alone.  The film suffers without Romero's energetic directing, something which made the first film so great, but it has plenty of great gore effects (supervised by makeup maestro Tom Savini) which horror fans will eat up.  This Divimax edition DVD is yet another excellent release from Anchor Bay, with the film looking and sounding better than ever and with a few nice extras including a commentary, a documentary, and trailers.  The only glaring question about this release is, why Creepshow 2?  The first film, which can currently be found on a bare bones disc from Warner Bros. (Creepshow 2 can also be found as the same) deserves this kind of release, but horror fans know Anchor Bay for having a reputation of giving great treatments to underrated and classic horror films like Near Dark and the Hills Have Eyes, so maybe if you consider Creepshow 2 in the same category, that could serve as an explanation.  Now, maybe we'll get a bonus packed treatment of the first film.",1105574400,,1274,4.794520547945205
649681,5,6303422020,"Three stories of terror introduced by the Creep (in animation form) who appears to have the same sense of macabre humor as the Crypt Keeper from Tales from the Crypt. The stories even begin the same way as match shots from comic-book to film. The first story is called 'Old Chief Woodenhead'. George Kennedy stars as an old convenience store owner who is robbed and killed by a bunch of 80's punks. His Indian statue comes alive and avenges his death. This story is probably the least entertaining and takes a while to get going.

Story number 2 is called 'The Raft' focuses on 4 teenagers out to have a good time at a secluded lake. But a huge sludge monster is out to eat them all up. This is probably the best story as it is very fast-paced and engaging.

The last, and longest story is 'The Hitchhiker' in which a rich, cheater (Lois Chiles) runs over the titular character and is haunted by his corpse all the way home until she loses her mind. This is quite a cool story with some interesting direction. Stephen King has a cameo as a trucker. Tom Savini (seriously) appears as the live action Creep and the beginning and end of the movie.

As part of Anchor Bay's Divimax series the image and sound of Creepshow 2 is top-notch. The 1.85:1 anamorphic picture is surprisingly beautiful and free of anything remotely resembling dirt, artifacts or pixalization. Black levels and fleshtones are suspiciously natural and color fidelity is superb. One wonders how such and old, and little seen, film can look so good. And although the soundtrack is remastered from plain and simple Mono it is still an above average presentation when compared to modern sound mixes. The sound is clear and crisp and is free of hiss or distortion. Kudos to Anchor Bay on this transfer.

For extras we get a commentary from director Michael Gornick, a documentary called 'Nightmares in Foam Rubber' about the creation of the make-up effects (rather boring), two trailers, a photo gallery with shots of behind the scenes activity and the script is in PDF form when inserted into a DVD-ROM drive. Nice menus too.

A must have for horror fans and Steven King affectionados. Even if you haven't seen the first film (like me) this is still a must have and a definite keeper. Very few people are likely to feel shortchanged after watching this movie.",1102550400,,2324,4.658536585365853

Romero about his next Dead film and he was asked what he wants to do after Land of the Dead his replied was ""I like to do another Creepshow movie"" I guess Stephen King will be getting a phone call from an old friend any day now? If Creepshow 3 does happen what King short story's will be in the new movie if it happens?

As for the Creepshow 2,I always found it to be a good 80's movie full of dumb people,like the Indian teenage punk who thought he could get into movies because of his hair! and how many people would go swimming in a lake see a duck getting attacked and killed by something in the water and would not turn there butts right around and head right back to land! I would of. And that girl in the Hitchiker,what a dumb lady,she's cheating on her husband,she wakes up in her lovers bed to see the alarm clock blanking she panicks,gets in her car and trys to think of a lie she can give to her husband about where she's been""Lady it's so simple just tell him you could not sleep so you went for a car ride!""

649683,1,6303422020,"Please note: the 1-star rating I gave to this film is based on the actual DVD product, not the movie itself.

 Released by Top Ten New Media Production Limited, this DVD is your typical cheapo bargain bin atrocity. Do NOT confuse this with the Anchor Bay release, which I haven't yet watched but is most definitely of better quality. And as I'm writing this review, AB is planning a special edition release to come out in the Fall (along with CHILDREN OF THE CORN).

 The image quality of this DVD is God-awful; even worse than the VHS or TV prints I've seen. Everything looks foggy, blurry or scratchy, and to make matters even worse, it's PAN and SCANNED. There are 4 chapter stops and no extras. Face it, you KNOW a DVD is of poor quality when it spells ""Start Movie"" ""Strat Movie"" on the menu screen. Skip this and wait for the special edition release.

 As for the film itself, it's OK. It's a really uneven film and doesn't feel anything like the original. It's not funny, not scary and, frankly, kind of boring. That said and done, I think it's better to grade each segment seperately.

 ""Old Chief Wood'n Head""

 This is the middling segment of the 3. The first half is really boring, but once the Indian statue starts stalking, it picks up a bit.

 ""The Raft""

 Easily the best of the stories. It's quite gory and nasty and is the only tale that comes close to capturing the essence of the EC comic books it's based on.

 ""The Hitchhiker""

 Maybe it was because it was late at night but this segment almost put me to sleep. Lois Chiles was fun but it had no meat whatsoever, just her being terrorized over and over again.

 All in all, skip this trashy release and go for the Anchor Bay DVD. It's a decent movie that I recommend only to those who like B horror flicks from the 80's.",1091491200,4,1791,4.36969696969697

649718,4,6303422020,"The MOVIE
Taking a different direction than it's 1982 predecessor, this fairly standard, but fondly remembered horror compilation makes up for it's lack of frights with pure entertainment. Lacking much of the E.C. Comics style of the first movie (except for the rather poor animated intermissions) initially takes away some of the charm, but it saves the best for last.
""Ol' Chief WoodenHead"", unanimously agreed to be the weakest of the three stories on offer, is almost saved by a charming yet sad performance by George Kennedy. This is a typical revenge story with not a single interesting or unpredictable twist. Most of the violence takes place off camera, and it is actually a bit of chore to sit through.
""The Raft"" is one of the foremost guilty pleasures in horror. Four friends are stalked by a man(and duck)-eating blob in an off-limits lake. Who will survive? Those familiar with these sorts of moral tales will hardly be surprised by the ending, but will not be any less amused with it's abrupt simplicity.
In ""The Hitchhiker"" an annoying, unfaithful woman gets her just desserts, though at the expense of an innocent life. By the end of this story I am always a little bored, probably because the colorful, perfectly-lengthed ""The Raft"" precedes it, but it is still my favourite. In my opinion it features the most interesting gore effects, and will always be remembered for the hitchhikers immortal, extremely quotable single line of dialogue.
The DVD
As for the DVD itself - this is no special edition, but it's as much as we can expect from a movie such as this. Frankly, we should be grateful it is on DVD at all, and has not been forgotten in the dusty vaults of VHS where it probably belongs. Surprisingly, the widescreen enhanced transfer on offer is extremely clear and mostly scratch-free for a movie of it's age and budget.
The mono sound track on offer is not so impressive, but once again, it could be a lot worse. A movie such as this does not need a 5.1 mix; there are very few opportunities for surround usage - the whole thing is basically dialogue with occasional music to suit the mood.
The extras are basically non-existent, with only a trailer and photo gallery, but at the price this DVD is going at, nobody is really in a position to complain.",1073952000,2,2278,4.711779448621554
649719,3,6303422020,"Although Stephen King (who authored the source stories and appears briefly in an episode) and George A. Romero (who wrote the script) are hyped in the advertising, neither contributed much to this latter day sequel (made five years after Creepshow did modest business in theaters and on video), and it shows.  Three stories and a wrap around (instead of five) are offered. Old Chief Woodenhead has an old school cigar store Indian going on a vengeful rampage, The Raft is a variant of The Blob, and the whole thing is almost saved by The Hitchiker, where a hit and run driver is menaced by the unstoppable spectre of the man she swatted with her car (it was this story that Romero had to fall back on if the They're Creeping Up On You episode in Creepshow 1 had proved to be unfilmmable).  Each story (save for the last one) is a passable tale of the macabre far better suited to Laurel's then running Tales from the Darkside television program.  Romero's longtime cinematographer Michael Gornick directed this after cutting his teeth on said TV show, and it shows.  The stories seemed paced with commercial breaks in mind.  While not a complete failure, it is far removed from the fun of the first movie.",1073260800,,1205,4.665094339622642
649720,3,6303422020,"I was a little disappointed in this sequel to the first Creepshow movie.  In the first movie, there was around five segments, while here we only get three.  If it were three really great stories, I could let it slide, but that's not the case.  The first story, titled Old Chief Woodenhead, stars George Kennedy as an owner of a general store in a town that has seen better days.  His wife thinks it's time to close the store and retire, but George feels a sort of obligation to the town that's supported him and his family over the years, and feels he needs to give a little back.  The title of the story refers to a wooden Indian in front of the store, which comes to life and exacts revenge on the gang of punks after they rob and kill George and his wife.  Pretty standard stuff, not really scary, and no real surprises.

The next story is called The Raft and is easily the best of the three.  It's about four high school kids that go swimming in a lake with a raft.  The swimming season is over, but the raft hasn't been removed from the lake, so they are getting in one last swim.  While on the raft, they encounter a strange, gooey blob like mass floating in the water.  They also discover the hard way that it has an appetite.  There are some fairly gory scenes in this short, along with some nudity.  The ending is quite good, and almost make up for the lameness of the other two stories.

The third story is the weakest of the bunch.  The HitchHiker involves a woman driving home from an extramarital affair, and she accidentally hits and kills a hitchhiker.  She has a moment of indecision, but then flees the scene.  Along the way home, she does wrestle with what happened, try to justify to herself leaving the scene of the accident, when the hitch-hiker starts appearing on the road even though she knows that couldn't be possible.  She starts to lose it, and begins to attack the man with her car.  This goes on for awhile, and the shocking ending isn't really all that shocking.  I just thought this was a really poor story to end the movie on.  One thing I found kind of funny was no matter how mess up the hitchhiker got, he would always repeat the same line, ""Thanks for the ride, lady.""  I found myself saying that to friends for awhile.  Also, watch for Stephen King with a small role as a truck driver in this segment.

There is a story interspersed between three stories, like in the first movie.  It involves a boy, some bullies, and a man eating Venus flytrap.  The segments are mostly animated, and it's sort of fun.

As I stated in the beginning, I think we were a little short changed on this movie.  Two lame segments and one good one do not make a great movie.  The first Creepshow was much more fun, and had a much more comic book feel, which reminded me of the great EC comics of the past.  There was a little of that here, but not enough.  And something else I noticed was there were a lot more recognizable actors in the first movie than in this movie.  I bought this DVD as I am sort of a completist, and I really like the second story, but interested viewers would probably be better served purchasing the first and renting this one.

649721,3,6303422020,"Not nearly as good as its chilling precursor, a collection of short horror films based on the works of Stephen King, this sequel contains about half as many ""terror tales"" as the original and as a result, seems to come up short.
CREEPSHOW 2 is not an awful movie by any means as it tells three stories (and also features a short cartoon) presented as a take on the old EC comic series.
The first story is a simple revenge tale featuring a Native American statue that exacts vengeance on a group of hoodlums who murder an antique store owner and his wife. The story is by-the-numbers but is presented pretty well. Our second tale finds a group of oversexed pot-smoking teen swimmers trying to get away from some type of man-eating human waste in the pond. This one is pretty creepy with some ""stay out of the water"" horror mixed with some humor. The last one plays on that classic concept of the sinner trying to cover up their mistakes but not being able to bury them properly as a cheating housewife runs down a hitchiker who just won't stay dead.
If you enjoyed the first film, this is pretty much more of the same. Unfortunately, where the first film was a gripping collaboration between horror masters, Stephen King and George Romero that had fun playing with the many common phobias in American culture, this sequel just feels like a bunch of old Tales From The Crypt re-runs played one after another. Not a bad movie if you're looking for a few good scares.",1058745600,3,1463,4.524528301886792
649722,4,6303422020,"I liked this movie for many reasons.  One, the first one was terrifyingly scary (I was 8 when I first saw it).  Two, it was written by horror master Stephen King.  The first story, ""Old Chief Woodenhead,"" about a cigar store Indian who avenges the murders of his kindly shop owners, was creepy enough.  Only really scary if you are easily creeped out or if you watch it at night with the lights off.  The second story, ""The Raft,"" about four college students who go to a secluded lake and unwittingly become sitting ducks to a carnivorous oil slick-like blob was particularly scary.  My second favorite out of the three stories in the movie.  The last of the three and by far the simplist and most scariest was ""The Hitchkiker.""  About a cheating wife driving home from a rendevous with her lover and runs down some poor guy. She flees the scene only to be haunted by his undead spirit.  Makeup effects by master Tom Savini were awesome.  The complaints I have about the movie are minor ones.  Why were there only three stories instead of five like in the first one?  Also, what was up with the animated wraparound story?  Yes, the first
""Creepshow"" featured animated in-betweens before and after each story, but it did not have any cartoonish interaction between characters in its prologue or epilogue.  Also the score wasn't  nearly as scary as it was in the first movie.  The fillmmakers should have tried to get the same composer to return as well as director George A. Romero.  The DVD doesn't have that many special features on it.  The trailer and a behind-the-scenes photo gallery montage are about it.  I would have liked to at least have a commentary by the director if not a couple of the cast members.  Last but not least, when will there be a ""Creepshow 3""?  It's never too late for another sequel.  Hello, Hollywood is sequel-crazy these days.  Now is the time to strike.

649784,4,6303422020,"While the first CREEPSHOW was deliciously delightful and was a fright-fest in and of itself, the same cannot be said of CREEPSHOW 2. While still it's three stories are fun and entertaining, and even scary at times, it lacks the punch that the first CREEPSHOW really gave us with its five stories. And I think that's where the main problem lies with CREEPSHOW 2...while running about 90 minutes, something still is amiss.
""Ol' Chief Woodenhead""-This first of the three tales gets things going on an interesting note. It's a tale of revenge done by the Indian statue guarding a little convenience store in the middle of a desolate town. After the owners (played nicely by Dorothy Lamour and George Kennedy) are murdered by a couple of robbers, ""Ol' Chief Woodenhead"" has his revenge and kills all three of them. An interesting and entertaining first short tale, but not a less-terrifying one either...just quietly terrifying in its own merits.
""The Raft""-This short tale is a little more livelier than the first, and kind of reminds you of ""The Blob"" with the murderous oil slick in a lake that terrorizes four friends who go for a swim in. One by one, the oil blob envelops them, until by tale's end, none are left (you know they weren't about to let Randy get away...he came so close). I'll tell you one thing--Laverne is a very cute girl...too bad the oil slick got her! Terrifying yes; quirky and kind of funny a little too.
""The Hitchhiker""-Actually, this one is very entertaining and offers chills despite being a little bit silly. I think Lois Chiles is just tasty as Annie, the hooker/cheating wife who finds out that when you hit someone who just wants a ride, no matter how many times you try to hit them or outrun them, they'll catch up with you in the end. This is a delightful tale and brings CREEPSHOW 2 to a nice conclusion...not discounting, of course, the short and brief Billy segment with the giant Venus fly-traps.
Overall, though, CREEPSHOW 2 would've been much better if there were two more stories. While it lacks the strength and scares of the first CREEPSHOW, it still manages to entertain based on its own scares, charms, and that is enough to make CREEPSHOW 2 a pretty good sequel.",1040515200,,2206,4.702842377260982

The Raft has got to be one of the few genious moments in horror movie history since it just gets under you skin and never goes away.  As for the other stories, well, let's break it down like this:
First Story: ""Old Chief Woodenhead""-sensible plot, decent effects with the exception of the cheesy looking guy in a rubber/wooden suit-lol.  This is more of a garden variety slasher flick sporting a Native-American vibe.  Myself being Indian, I find it slightly offensive but thankfully the story offs the bad guys effectively.
Second Story: ""The Raft""-as said before, simply brilliant in it's execution and quite simply a definitive moment in horror cinema.  I wish I had seen this in the theatre!  What is so brilliant about this is that these kids in the movie are smoking ""something"" and no one really asks the question, did they just drown from being stoned or did a blob thing really eat them up?  I was waiting for a sign at the end to say: ""Only use 100 percent pure folks-not all flowers have the same effect!""  LOL.
Third Story: ""The Hitchhiker""-standard Hollywood horror fare.  Nothing really new here except for the fact of the adultress who is haunted by something she's done wrong.  The actors play this story rather well.  I guess it would be pretty creepy being chased by a bloody ghost in a dirty yellow rainslicker....hmmmm....sounds like a movie I remember seeing ""last summer.""

The wooden Indian tale that starts this movie comic book probably sums up all the themes that EC comics tried to beat us over the head with: If you are bad, bad things will happen to you.  Hence, thugs kill sweet storekeep, wooden Indian gores thugs.  They only got what was coming to them. Story Two, ""The Raft"" is all-out cool.

I am a big Tom Savini fan.  He is actually a pretty good actor, especially considering he gained fame as a makeup artist.  Tom appears as ""The Creep"" in the wrap-around story.  Unfortunately it doesn't carry any chills and they should have kept the Creep from the first movie.  Also the animation is pretty bad.
""Old Chief Wooden Head"" is the first story presented and despite another great George Kennedy performance, this episode just doesn't deliver.  You know what is going to happen from the first time you see Kennedy talking to the wooden indian.
""The Raft"" is the reason this gets 4 stars.  Despite my opinion that Creepshow was better as a whole than Creepshow 2, ""The Raft"" is by far the scariest story in EITHER movie.  I read the story this was based upon before I saw the movie and thought it would make a great story for ""Tales from the Darkside"" or another TV horror anthology.  I'm glad they waited and put it in a film.  Four teens are stuck out on a raft in a lake in early Autumn.  Along comes a floating black glob of gunk that can dissolve flesh and seems to be guided by an intellegence.  Where did it come from? Who knows? Who cares?? It's extremely creepy!
""The Hitchhiker"" is a little better than ""Chief Wooden Head"", but not by much.  A lady accidently hits a hitchhiker, killing him.  She drives off frantically and you can kind of guess what happens from there.  The ending was especially poor.  It's like they didn't know how to end it, so they just gave up.
So, watch this for ""The Raft"", but get Creepshow if you want a more rounded out movie.  If this movie was called ""The Raft"" and only contained that story, it'd get 5 stars from me.",986342400,3,1787,4.382978723404255

This ""sequel"" is anything BUT true to the original, and owes more to ""Friday the 13th"" sophomoric cinematic sensibilities than anything remotely redeemable horrifically.  C2 does to C1 what ""Aliens"" (Cameron's unsubtle sequel) did to Ridley Scott's artful, original ""Alien,"" or what Hollywood's ""Point of No Return"" did to France's ""La Femme Nikita.""

As bad or worse as C2 is than even something as atrocious as ""Exorcist 2"" (hard to imagine anything much worse than this shy of ""Plan 9 from...""), I came away from the cinema feeling much less certain of the continuing genius of even horror master mavin effects magician himself, Tom Savini.  Which isn't really fair to blame Savini for any of this dreck.  Nobody could've probably saved C2.  It rightfully belongs where it began no doubt, strewn on the editing room floor, rather than in the hands of you the buyer.

649881,4,6303422020,"""Creepshow 2"" is a set of three mini series of silly and yet funny stories. First, my personal favourite, being ""The Raft"" is about four teenagers going swimming out in a lake. There is an oil slick in the water, and it is after them. I found ""the raft"" to be funny, silly, disgusting and scarey all at the same time. I don't know how people can actually use their great minds to think of the strange things in life. But ""The Raft"" is a must see episode and it is the first in the ""Creepshow 2"" video.
Secondly, is ""The Indian"". I must admit this was my least favourite as it didn't have a real scarey theme to it. It is about two owners of a shop, in a real desserted town, business is doing very badly. They own an antique shop, in it is a big indian statue. Visitors come along and meet the business owners and kill them. The Indian comes to life and seeks revenge. A below average mini series of the ""creepshow 2"" video. This is why I gave the ""Creepshow 2"" video a rating of four stars.
Thirdly, is ""the Fireman"", this one had me laughing cause it was very silly. It has a woman driving around at night, and she accidentally runs a fireman over, she feels bad about it, but speeds off nonetheless. The fireman becomes a living dead and will stop at nothing to ruin this ladies night. You have got to watch this one to figure it out. A Big Laugh, and creepy as well.
All in all, I give ""creepshow 2"" 4 stars. It is great, I highly recommend anyones viewing. It will have you laughing, scared, and really get you thinking. Thinking what would I do in that situation.

""The Raft"" is the best story of the lot.  A gelatinous ""thing"" attacks four helpless teenagers stranded on a raft anchored in a lake in the middle of nowhere.  Kind of ""Jaws"" meets ""The Blob"" this is insanely creepy and alone makes the video purchase worthwhile.  The special effects are great and the fear factor high as you watch the teens gradually realize there is no escape.
""The Hitchhiker"" has two things going for it, lots of blood and Stephen King as a potty mouthed truck driver.  The constant reappearance of the dead hitchhiker was somewhat confusing and not properly explained, but it's a movie so I'll let it slide.  There's a good helping of car-on-pedestrian carnage that's a great way to gross out a squeamish friend.

I  expected more of the same with Creepshow II, but was disappointed. The  movie contains three shorts as compared to five in the first release - and  the quality is not the same. There's more gore -- but a lot of blood and  gore do not (inof itself) a good movie make.
Additionally, these stories  were more mundane and usual than the ones in the first film. By far the  best was ""The Raft"". The last one about the hitchhiker is an  overdone theme, originally from a Twilight Zone episode, which has appeared  in many anotholgies since. Hey guys, let's do something different! Lots of  other b&w pulp horror shorts are available.
Well, I can't really  recommend this one whole-heartily, though I will probably buy it when it is  available on DVD (because I DID enjoy the first release and I tend to  complete collections). Folks who enjoy the genre will probably want it to  fill out their libraries. Just be aware that there are better titles  available for the money.

649934,2,6303422020,"I fell in love with Creepshow 1. The last two tales were brilliant,loaded with gore galore,terrific scares and great monsters. I was rather excited when I heard about the sequel,Creepshow 2. The poster looked really cool and  the stories sounded  great. I was extremely disappointed after it ended. The  stories were way too short and there were only three,whereas the first had  five tales that were very long. The plots were rather dumb. The first tale  with the living indian statue was good,but
the plot of the last two were  flat. The acting was wooden too. For the most part,the characters were  cardboard cutouts. The Creep,indian,elderly storeowners and the demented  hitchhiker  were decent,but the rest of the characters were as stiff as  bricks. The best tale is by far The Raft,but even that was cheesy. The  monster was laughable,though the deaths were very cool. The film is quite  gory and pretty scary,but it's just boring and too slow to be  entertaining. No where near the brilliance of the original. The reason for  the two star rating? The use of gore was good (not as good as the first),  the special F/X were decent and Tom Savini gave an excellent performance as  the Creep. Those things,of course,can't make a movie. Just stick with the  original. Rated R for gory horror violence,strong language and brief nudity.",958089600,3,1338,4.901785714285714

649936,5,6303422020,"Yesssss, they don't make 'em like this too often. This movie is truly bone-chilling! I love all 3 stories on here, the best one is definitely The Raft, followed by The Hitchhiker, and last but not least The Indian story.  Rent this baby, or better let, just buy the freakin' tape, watch it super  duper late, and sit back and embrace True horror! This one is alot better  than the 1st one. The Raft story alone is worth buying, have the pleasure  of viewing this enormous-grotesque looking blue blob that floats in the  water, and is in desperate need of some fresh blood! The 4 scared teens  have to escape this death trap somehow... Some other movies worth checking  out are... Necronomicon:Book of The Dead, Bodybags.

649937,3,6303422020,"I have two main complaints with this movie.  The first is the length.  It's simply too short.  The three stories could have been more elaborate, or they could have added one or two additional stories.  The second  complaint is about the third story.  I'm glad the Hitchiker was short, it  was a sad attempt at comedy or just deserts for an adulterer.  Old Chief  Wooden Head and the Raft were entertaining.  The Raft was pretty scary, it  shows the damage a slick can do.  Like what an oil slick does to wildlife,  but worse.",950832000,,525,4.457446808510638
649938,3,6303422020,"Still the same as the first, but this time the stories are being told by an ugly dungeon keeper or something, and there are only three stories instead of five. But at least each one of these stories topped any of the  stories from the first. These stories have better plots and are far more  entertaining and easier to watch than the first. Still not all that good,  but good enough.",946857600,,383,4.366197183098592

Beautiful case with freshly drawn images plastered throughout the book that comes with, (all done in the classic comic book art style that is the series staple), brand new interviews from some of the cast including the actors, a detailed documentary by Greg Nicotero & Howard Burger on SFX & the legends themselves, George Romero & Tom Savini shed some light on the interesting production & journey of the crew behind the scenes in making the Creepshow 2 project happen. It seriously is the only way to watch this awesome classic on Blu-Ray. The case alone warrants a purchase!!",1522627200,,640,4.8807339449541285
