8440120,4,B004SQPQTW,"My kindergarten students enjoy it. If it were them, they would score it a 5 star. The reason I score it as a 4 star is because there are some movements that have to be mitigated like jumping around like a certain animal. Those kinds of movements are hard to manage in a classroom with 20+ students.",1486598400,,298,4.245614035087719

8440127,4,B004SQPQTW,"Teacher Review: This video works well in my kindergarten classroom. The breathing exercises are awesome!  Students love seeing their numbers on the screen!  My one problem with this video is transition time between poses. Lots of educational tide bits are shared between poses causing children to become unfocused. I solved this problem myself with requiring mountain pose during the transition, keeping children focused! This is the only number Yoga DVD I have found or own. We do this video one time a week.",1415750400,2,509,5.120481927710843

8440129,4,B004SQPQTW,They don't count some of the numbers in sequence with the moves and change the rythm of the counting sometimes but we love this disk. I got winded doing it with the children.,1397001600,,174,4.303030303030303
