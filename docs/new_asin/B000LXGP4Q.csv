2716055,5,B000LXGP4Q,"Have you hit a plateau in your attempt to find fitness?  Do you want to find a bit of adventure to add to your dance routine?  This DVD by Meera will invigorate your fitness routine and add a dash of Indian spice into your life.  I am a participant in many forms of Asian folk and Middle Eastern folk dances, with a well established performing career.  I am familiar with dancing to fast-paced drum solos, complicated choreography, and difficult rhythms, but even beginners will find the Dances of India DVD series enjoyable and exotic.  I am so excited to add yet another layer of dance depth to my repetoire.

I have found that this Instructional Dance DVD is a great way to revamp the dull and boring cardio workouts, and is full of intriguing dance moves and postures, and the Oriental decor of the set really enlivens the imagination.  The Instructor gives a great demo of the moves, slowly at first and then gets you up to tempo with the music.

My only unfavorable comment is that I feel the instructor/producer should have allowed for a longer warm up and cool down time, but that is easily remedied at home by doing a few extra stretches before and after the ones provided.

2716056,4,B000LXGP4Q,"My motivation for buying this DVD was to find a fun workout. I love the dance scenes in Bollywood movies as well as the music videos for Indian Pop music. This dance video with Meera is a great introduction to the commonly seen dance steps from the movies and it's also a good workout. I should point out I'm a dance beginner and not in very good shape. A seasoned dancer may find this DVD too easy. Meera explains everything clearly with ample demonstrations. The camera shows her whole body. There are no crazy zooms or angles.

Since I've been using this video the last month or so my grace and balance have improved, as well as some shrinkage of my butt (yay!). It was a fun way to exercise so I'll certainly be getting more of Meera's videos soon.",1177372800,39,752,4.371428571428571

8164782,5,B000LXGP4Q,"This dvd is too cute the moves are simple yet elegant, and very eclectic yet professional I would recommend this to anyone looking for another form of dance. Thumbs up!!!",1329177600,,170,4.7
8164783,5,B000LXGP4Q,"I was looking for something a little different from my normal routine of bellydance fitness DVDs.  So I gave this one a try.  And I am so, so very pleased.

I liked Meera's sweet smile and personality.  It's obvious she finds this type of dance a joy.  After the first combination, I was grinning ear to ear.  Not many programs got me to do that!

The dance steps were fun and very bouncy, just as I've seen in the few Bollywood movies I've seen.  It was positively joyful.  The warm up and cool down sections were very good, she included some very good leg stretches.  Which I find is important in any dance fitness video, since you move around so much.  And move around you do!  It gave me a good sweat and made me feel great.

This was definitely a good addition to my fitness routine.  Bollywood dancing is such fun, I can't believe I went so long without something like this!",1302134400,,880,4.319018404907975
8164784,5,B000LXGP4Q,"I really enjoy this DVD. Being a former professional dancer I need quality in regards to rhythm, choreography and teaching. This DVD has it all! I can enjoy it over and over. The instructor is beautiful and it's easy to follow.",1269734400,,227,4.560975609756097
8164785,5,B000LXGP4Q,"Good for beginners to intermediate, for dance instruction and workout.

I like how she demostrates/practices each move slowly, then does it fast, then combines the individual moves together into a dance sequence. She does a good job cueing the next move.

This ""Bollydance"" video has a variety of cute moves, with lots of arm/hand gestures. There are many feminine moves so I would not recommend this for men.",1262995200,,409,5.0
8164786,4,B000LXGP4Q,"Wow, Im surprised that everyone is saying this was so easy. I have taken maybe three Bollywood instructions, and have been Bellydancing for nearly three years at an inter-mmediate student level. I found this to be very difficult but I am actually trying to learn Bollywood not just work out. In the beginning she zips through the finger position(Moudras) so quickly and Im not at all familiar with them. Immediately you are supposed to be layering these finger positions onto your moves in a very precise way at a very high speed. I like this DVD but it is challenging for a bollywood beginner",1249603200,3,593,4.711538461538462
8164787,5,B000LXGP4Q,"I'm a belly dancer, and I wanted to put together a choreography incorporating Indian moves. This DVD was perfect for my purposes, as it introduced a nice handful of simple but interesting dance steps that easily fit into any choreography. Meera is super cute and explains things quite well, and there are no crazy camera angles or jump cuts during the workout. The only downside I can see is that the workout is fairly short and not that cardio-intensive - but that may not be a problem, depending on your needs. Also, there is a performance video by Meera in full costume, but it is annoyingly jumpy and put together from several different performances, so it's useless for those of us trying to see technique or extended combinations. It's more ""music video"" style and doesn't show Meera's full body or continuous movements -- everything's cut up into short glimpses with the music overlaid, so it's not even the music she's probably dancing to.

But all in all, great instructional video. You'll be doing the Heart of Bombay in no time!",1238371200,5,1039,4.772222222222222
8164788,3,B000LXGP4Q,"The few moves that she shows are repeated enough to really get them down, but the music is very repetitive and gets annoying.  The DVD needs 1) More combos!!!! (The ALI DVD I bought has about 14 interesting combos in it and sets a heck of a standard) and 2)Better music selection.

Also, the performance segment didn't show any of the moves she taught and had quite a few that I would love to have learned instead.  It's frustrating to see a performance that has completely different moves- it makes you feel as though you are far, far from performing, even in casual settings.

I do think the moves she showed were easyily broken down, but for the cost, it wasn't what it should have been.",1200787200,23,690,4.4523809523809526
8164789,5,B000LXGP4Q,"I love this exercise video! I really like Meera! Unlike some exercise instructors, her personality and voice aren't annoying at all. Everything is explained thoroughly. She gives you time to learn the move plus, it's a dvd so you can always go back. Even if you're not coordinated you can take it slow. Pause and try to get it right. Just think, you're still exercising even if you're just practicing one move to get it right. I always use a mirror with exercise to make sure I'm doing the move correctly.

I had my first child almost 10 months ago and I'm still trying to find time for exercise. So, I'm quite out of shape. However, I don't always get to finish, I still feel a burn when I do this video. I really want to collect her other 3 videos. I saw a preview of them on this particular dvd. They all look excellent!!",1195948800,13,824,4.316129032258065
8164790,4,B000LXGP4Q,"The moves in this DVD are well explained and gracefully executed.  I feel like I am learning actual Bollywood moves.  The filming and set are professional quality.

I find though that my heart rate is not elevated much (except during one move called the Heart of Bombay).  Compared to aerobic dance, Celtic dance, and pop dance, this DVD has a much slower pace.  Despite that, the DVD will improve your overall posture and movements since all the motions require control, grace, and involve muscles in the whole body.

My only regrets are that just a handful of moves were demonstrated and that the background music was a bit bland and repetitive.  I do plan to buy more of Meera's DVDs in the future.",1192752000,10,701,4.650406504065041
