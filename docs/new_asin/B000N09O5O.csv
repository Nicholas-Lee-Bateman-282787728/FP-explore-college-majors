2752369,5,B000N09O5O,"""Juicy Meats"" is another great ""Good Eats"" collection, with Alton Brown delving into the world of true carnivores. These episodes include ""Pork Fiction,"" ""Steak Your Claim,"" and ""A Bird in the Pan."" Alton is in fine form explaining the ins and outs of meat preparation here, and if I had to choose, ""Steak Your Claim"" is probably my favorite episode of the bunch (the included ""Pan-Seared Rib Eye"" recipe is hard to beat,) while I probably learned the most from ""A Bird in the Pan."" The set comes with a leaflet with one recipe from each show for those who want to try to duplicate Alton's mastery at home. (Good luck!)

The ""Good Eats"" series has taught me more than any other show about food and how cooking actually works, and ""Juicy Meats"" is no exception to the rule. For those interested in meat, this is a DVD not to be missed!",1421539200,2,834,4.4868421052631575

Purchased as a gift for my brother in-law.
He loved it and all DVDs worked.
Watched some episodes with him, better than I thought!",1388793600,,150,4.392857142857143
2752372,5,B000N09O5O,"We love Alton!  I think we will end up watching this DVD more than once, because Alton gives you a ton of info and good tips, not to mention new ideas.  My husband is fired up to cook the chicken in this episode all by himself and ya' gotta love that.",1295222400,2,251,3.9019607843137254

8173723,5,B000N09O5O,"I have always been a fan of Alton Brown and Good Eats, and have yet to see an episode that wasn't both entertaining and educational. ""More Juicy Meats"" contains three episodes for carnivores dealing with roasts and lamb. The episodes, ""Family Roast"", ""A Chuck For Chuck"", and ""Grill Seekers"" are all fascinating, and the enclosed recipe booklet deals with one recipe per show. Of the three episodes my favorite is ""A Chuck For Chuck"" which deals with a modestly complex but delicious method of preparing pot roast. I don't particularly like to eat lamb, but still found the show's presentation of and recipe for ""Silence of the Leg O' Lamb"" interesting and useful.

This is a great series; I particularly like it for its educational benefits, but the quirky teaching methodology and humor makes it the single best cooking show I have ever seen. Highly recommended!",1473465600,,864,4.917808219178082

8173725,5,B000N09O5O,"As a dedicated Alton Brown and Good Eats fan, I can honestly say there has never been an episode I didn't enjoy, but these three shows for carnivores are particularly insightful. My favorite of the bunch is ""Raising the Steaks"" which deals with beef preparation. Although I no longer eat much beef, the recipes for skirt steak and sirloin steak are extremely tempting. ""Q"" is all about pulled pork, and I do love everything about barbeque: this episode is probably the most educational of the three, as it covers topics such as brining Boston butt to perfection. The enclosed recipe booklet is especially helpful if you want to prepare these on your own (watch the episode first). Finally ""The Man Food Show"" highlights ""Mini Man Burgers"" and corn dogs. The corn dog recipe is the most challenging of the bunch to do correctly, and honestly I don't like corn dogs enough to put the effort into it.

Regardless of your desire to make any of these recipes, these are three very educational episodes of Good Eats, and I recommend this set highly!",1473465600,,1043,4.730769230769231
8173726,5,B000N09O5O,"""Good Eats"" goes whole hog in this 3-episode DVD, ""Juicy Meats 3"". Featuring the episodes ""Ham I Am"", ""Chops"", and ""Sausage: A Beautiful Grind"", this is not a disc for vegetarians. I am not a particular fan of chops, so I watched that episode as educational entertainment, but the other two episodes were great and more practical. ""Ham I Am"" is perhaps the definitive cooking show on ham, while ""Sausage: A Beautiful Grind"" was fascinating. Included are bonus ""Ask Alton"" segments where viewer questions are addressed (don't skip them, they are highly informative) and a recipe booklet with featured preparations for these three shows. I recommend ""City Ham"" and ""Italian Sausage"" in particular.

Learning about cooking is an absolute joy with Alton Brown and I highly recommend these episodes of ""Good Eats"".",1452211200,,809,5.128787878787879
8173727,5,B000N09O5O,"In ""Fruit Fest"" Alton Brown gets into apples, strawberries, and bananas in a big way. These are all great episodes using quintessential fruits central to American cuisine. Of the recipes he details here one of my favorites is ""It's a Wonderful Waldorf"" from ""Apple Family Values"", where he discusses variations on the ubiquitous Waldorf Salad: though I don't care for some of his additions to the classic dish (like red onion and curry powder, both of which I like, just not here), I appreciate his opening up the recipe with an emphasis on balance. From ""Strawberry Sky"" the recipe for ""Strawberry Pudding"" was my favorite of the bunch, and used the most interesting preparation techniques, while ""Top Banana"" yielded tips for perfect fried plantains. All these and several other recipes are printed in the handy mini-recipe booklet included with the DVD, but I recommend watching the episodes first to see how it's done.

Alton Brown is a great teacher, and ""Fruit Fest"" is a particularly fruitful (sorry) DVD, as these foods are such basic and healthy staples that everyone could use some ideas about how to get more of them into their diets. Like other ""Good Eats"" DVDs, I highly recommend ""Fruit Fest"".",1438905600,,1207,4.945812807881773
8173728,5,B000N09O5O,"Alton Brown is back with another fun and educational triple dose of ""Good Eats,"" this time all about soup. Mastering basic soup-making is a vital skill for any cook, and here Alton discusses several variations on the theme. I especially loved ""Pressure"" which features an explanation about how to use pressure cookers for soups (and other things) with ""AB's Beefy Broth"" being the showcase recipe presented. ""True Brew IV: Take Stock"" is an excellent primer on making chicken stock, while ""Soup's On"" goes to town on old fashioned vegetable soup. There is a bonus mini recipe booklet enclosed to help you recreate these concoctions and more, but do yourself a favor and watch the episodes first for best results.

This is another great ""Good Eats"" DVD from Alton Brown, and cooks everywhere will love it.",1434153600,,804,4.955555555555556
