810079,5,630415674X,"From the opening strains of music, I was sucked in hook, line and sinker! This movie is absolutely BRILLIANT! Alan Rickman's award-winning portryal of Rasputin, the monk who is accredited with the collapse of the Russian Empire was a tour de force. Rickman fills the screen with his charasmatic presence, but never once as himself - only delivering an absolutely correct depiction of Rasputin  (or at least, the Rasputin described in books), right down to the manic way in which Rasputin spoke, his lustful ways, his unkepmpt manner, the way in which he treated women, himself, those in power. I loved it! I have yet to watch this movie and think, ""This is Alan Rickman playing Rasputin"" - every time, I get sucked into the character, Rasputin, instead.
However, it wasn't just Alan Rickman who made this movie - Ian McKellam was incredible as Nicholas II, not only looking eerily like him, but again, mimicking the real Nicholas II in mannerisms and in the way he interacted with those around him. It is just plain spooky. Personally, I think he should have got an emmy as well. To top it off, the cinematography and music were just about the most perfect match creating a wonderful atmopshere which just whisks you away from the real world for 90 minutes.
Although this movie set me off on a spree of learning about Rasputin, Nicholas, Alexandra, and the collapse of the Russian Empire, which does introduce a whole lot of plot errors, this film is still an absolute joy to watch just because of the powerful acting delivered by all the cast and the wonderful manner in which the story unfolds. Recommend this film to ANYONE - whether interested in Russian history or not, because if you can't be bothered with the history, then just relax in the fairy tale.",970444800,25,1760,4.732899022801303

810178,5,630415674X,"This is a beautifully depicted film. Yes, it is based on fact, but I am sure than no movie can really accurately described what really went on in the lives of the Romanovs. However, as a movie, its really brilliant. Its utterly mesmerizing, and it really is all thanks to Alan Rickman. He is utter perfection in this. His portrayal of the infamous Rasputin is genius and almost creepy. The likeness is undeniable.

810179,3,630415674X,"The opening titles allege that this movie is based on fact. Well, yes, it is - sort of - but it could only at best be described as a strait-jacketed version, stripped down to the bare bones. No meat on this baby! Good acting, especially from Alan Rickman in the title role but SO MANY real-life characters missing and so many incidents leap-frogged over. The story of the meddlesome monk whose powers to heal the haemophiliac tsarevich disastrously influenced the decision-making of Nicholas and Alexandra is monumental in its tragedy but alas, this version cannot even be accorded the Reader's Digest seal of respectable abridgement. One gets the feeling that this may very well have been intended as a more fully-fleshed version of events but all the juices and flavors have been drained out to accommodate the lowest common denominator in viewership. This is a runaway train with no stops for the viewer to absorb the historical scenery. So much background information is missing. So little explanation is given for the sequence of events that brought about the fall of the Romanovs. And was Rasputin really a mind-reader??? Gimme a break! Even though Rasputin is the focus of the movie the story is that of the Romanov family and they deserve a much deeper and sympathetic evaluation than this Cliff Notes special. An abysmally wasted opportunity that merely skims the surface of things and insults the viewer's intelligence.",1197417600,4,1429,5.008403361344538

810181,5,630415674X,"Alan Rickman continues to amaze me with the diversity and depth he brings to every role he plays. His Rasputin just leapt out at you, even in moments when he was being serious & contemplative. He so richly deserved all the accolades that were awarded to him for his performance. He played so many facets, there were times you wanted to strangle him, and other times when you felt completely sympathetic to him, and wondered if he truly was a Holy Man who just became a pawn in the power struggle of the time. I also have to give kudos to both Greta Scacchi & Ian McKellen for their performances as the doomed Tsar & Tsarina, bursting with hope and happiness as Alexei is ""cured"", and falling into the pit of despair as their world crumbles around them.

Greta Sacchi was miscast as Alexandra, she didn't have the acting talent or the physical resemblance needed.  The locations were great and it is worth renting the film to see them.

810185,5,630415674X,"The story of the last Romanovs starts from Siberia 1991: their bones are found and the boy, Alexei, introduces: ""This is my mother, this is my family..."" Then a leap back to 1880's and to a boy, who seems to read minds. 20 years later he - Rasputin - is doing hard labour in Siberia, until Virgin Mary appears to him. Very swiftly the plot takes us to St. Petersburg, where Rasputin convinces others of his mission. The boy, Alexei, narrates, how he came to heal him and was their only friend, no matter what people said about him later. The monk, who looks like a madman, knows about Alexei's illness, although it has been a state secret, and by speaking about sailing he takes the pain away, into himself, as it seems. A hypnotist, a fraud, a madman, a magical healer?
Rasputin convinces the Tzarina and later the Tzar of his abilities, so he has a place in court, although he is a very embarrassing man, uneducated, unpredictable and too fond of wine and gypsy prostitutes. Behind the scenes Russian people suffer, the First world war (predicted by Rasputin) is started and the last minutes of the Romanov family are at hand. Everything is told very economically, nothing too much and yet everything you need to know, with authentic film material cut into the story.
The film is a feast for the eyes and mind, even though some historical facts aren't exact. Anyway, this isn't a documentary. As a story it works like a dream, the actors are unbelievably good - so it really feels unfair to start talking about Rickman and not others. So I'm just saying: they are all wonderful. But the movie is called ""Rasputin"".
I've recently looked up films of Alan Rickman, partly because some of them are hard to find, but mostly because his way of acting is simply addictive. I think I finally know, why. It's a kind of pornography - of human soul. (Which is an embarrassing discovery, porn really isn't my cup of tea...)  His Rasputin isn't just a calculating monk, who sees an opportunity to get a comfortable life, wine and women and power over people, but a man, who lives from moment to moment, uneducated, without manners, sensual, in some ways stupid and in some ways clever. At times you see a strong, manipulative, hypnotic monk who makes you believe in God and Virgin Mary and seems to be able to look into your soul, at times there is child-like sincerity and vulnerability. He believes he has a mission, but it also gives him pain, he sees things but doesn't see, how his conduct affects the falling empire. ""I didn't choose to be holy!"" he says like a weak human being, who has been trusted with a burden, that is much too heavy. Strong, vulnerable, wise, fallable, loving, selfish... Is this the real Rasputin? Very possibly. Human beings are just as mixed and as capable of being both angelic and devilish as Rickman shows - in this and other movies.
Oh yes, I felt great pity for Rasputin, though I wouldn't want him living in my house. And I'm glad I don't know Rickman in person, he seems to know too well, what we people are like. Who wants her mind to be x-rayed? Even by Rickman (who is, I admit, in his own way, enchanting)?
Watch this movie, if you want to understand history, people or acting. Look at these actors and actresses, they don't act, they are the characters. Rickman is just the best example of how to become someone else than one really is, whether it is Rasputin, Mesmer or other things he's done. Watch this!",1062115200,35,3439,4.546774193548387
810234,5,630415674X,"I know zilch about the Russian history and have viewed no other film on this subject, therefore, I can make no educated comparisons to either reality or other entertainment offerings.
As a connoisseur of the movies, I can categorically state that from the moment I saw the eyes of Tamas Toth (the young Rasputin), until I was treated to the presence of Alan Rickman (the adult Rasputin), through the closing credits I was transported to another world entirely.
No other young actor could have been better cast to make you believe were seeing through those amazing eyes into the mind of a young Alan Rickman.  Definitely no other actor could have given the performance of a lifetime as did Rickman in portraying the earthy, maniacal, confused, yet hypnotic, charming, and persuasive character of Grigori Rasputin.  Charisma and sexuality ooze out of every nuance of this worldly man of God.  You never once question that a princess or even a Tsarina would let this unkempt, rough, vulgar, unwashed commoner touch her soft, delicate, royal skin.  In fact, you wonder instead how she could show such restraint and resist touching him for even a moment while in his presence.  This movie contains what I consider one of the screen's all-time best film kisses.
There is more to the film than all that of course.  Historically correct or not, there is an intriguing, entertaining story of Russian Royalty, love, betrayal, war, religious fervor, and much more.
The actors portraying the Romanov family were excellent, particularly young Freddie Findlay (Alexei, heir to the throne).  The palace settings and outdoor locations were lavish beyond description.  The gorgeous music perfectly meshed with film.
There are not enough adjectives, nor enough awards, to describe or honor the acting talents of Alan Rickman, particularly in this film.  He became Rasputin in a manner that caused me to completely forget I was watching an actor, and still always be aware this was the work of a SUPERB actor.
Never a big fan of historical drama, I have to thank Alan Rickman for his wide choice of roles.  As a fan I have exposed myself to many genres they I may have never otherwise viewed in an effort to catch every wonderful moment of Rickman captured on film.  Not one film or performance has failed to entertain and amaze; certainly this is one of his best.
If you haven't seen the film, you deserve to watch it soon.  If you are an Alan Rickman fan and you haven't seen 'Rasputin' - shame on you!",1057968000,46,2485,4.834905660377358

7864923,4,630415674X,"Grigori Rasputin  infamous Russian holy man and historical enigma  has had his tale told in film many times, though too often through the lens of grotesque embellishment. While HBOs 1996 production is not a perfect film and had no hope of accurately framing the mans life in 135 minutes, it is one of the most sober-minded of biographies on Rasputin and reigns as one of the best all-around features of its infamous subject. Though the film deals alternatively pleasing and disappointing plot features in a tit-for-tat manner, it boasts great production values and excellent casting, making for a very satisfying experience that I am surprised never saw a theatrical release.

The story: Driven by a sense of destiny, a Siberian peasant with apparent supernatural talents (Alan Rickman,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Harry-Potter/dp/B005OCFGTO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Harry Potter</a>&nbsp;series) works his way into the Russian royal family and influences the downfall of an empire.

Alan Rickman *is* Rasputin. Lionel Barrymore and Christopher Lee have nothing on Rickman, who channels Rasputins extremes with grace and nuance suggesting a genuine understanding of the character. Admittedly, Rickmans most memorable scenes include a lot of caterwauling and grandiose dialogue, but look no further than the quieter scenes to see the sincere and insecure side of Rasputin come to life. Rickman even replicates the curious manner of speech reported of the character, demonstrating an attention to historical detail prevalent throughout the film (more on that soon). As good as Rickman is, hes matched by Ian McKellan (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lord-of-the-Rings-Trilogy/dp/B0026L7H20/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lord of the Rings Trilogy</a>) who is perfect for the regal role of Tsar Nicholas II. Greta Scacchi (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Player/dp/0780618564/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Player</a>) as Tsarina Alexandra and young Freddie Findlay (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Feast-at-Midnight/dp/B0007LFPQG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Feast at Midnight</a>) as Tsarevitch Alexei are likewise strong, but are at the disadvantage of slightly weaker roles.

Nevertheless, I appreciate that the film focuses so much on Alexei, who is the lynchpin of the Rasputin tale but tends to be only fleetingly analyzed in both movies and history books. This film is anchored on the relationship Rasputin had with Alexei and Alexandra, and the result is a pleasantly emotional character dynamic. Its even easier to invest in thanks to the realistic detail. I am not sure whether the movie was actually filmed in and around the actual Winter Palace, but the sets are convincingly beautiful. And though the movie takes some historical liberties, the abundance of accurate details suggest that the filmmakers did indeed do their homework: the inclusion of often-overlooked figures such as Bishop Hermogen and Derevenko the sailor-nanny is one thing, but the filmmakers go out of their way to highlight tidbits such as the fact that Nicholas II abdicated on a train and that Rasputin played with the cabinet in Prince Yusupovs basement before he was assassinated. Im impressed.

I am a little less impressed with the foreground of the movie. I don't mind that not every facet of the real story is depicted (I still hope for a miniseries to attempt this), but I wish that the films take was not quite so one-sided and ambiguous. The movie makes hardly any mention of Rasputins colossal influence on matters of state, choosing instead to explain the public hatred of him by his sexual scandals. And while it was about time that Alexandra was judged favorably by any medium, its disappointing that theres no hint of the alienating behavior that her adoration for Rasputin invoked. If anything, the movie is *too* friendly to Rasputin and the Romanovs, depicting the former as a horny weirdo and the latter as gullible victims. The picture is what it is, but Im certain it would have been more interesting if its subjects had been a little less pristine.

Nevertheless, as aforementioned, I am convinced that this is the best Rasputin biography produced to date. Time will tell whether the upcoming Leonardo DiCaprio production or others dethrone it, but for those who are tired of the overdone horror films based on the story, this VHS tape is worth tracking down for now.",1441670400,,4545,5.764530551415797

This film has a mystical eeriness which captures the essence of the legend of Rasputin. Despite its title, this film appears to pass no judgement on the man, but rather paints a very human character.",1401148800,,467,4.85

He managed to make a name for himself with mesmerizing techniques and made his way up to the Tzar house where he had sex with all wemen in heat including the Tzarin herself who was convinced the well being of her sick son depended on this Jesuit disguised as Khlyst. Unfortunately you may have very little chance to see this movie today since the Catholic church has recently managed censure all movie criticizing the church.,1360713600,,501,4.640449438202247
