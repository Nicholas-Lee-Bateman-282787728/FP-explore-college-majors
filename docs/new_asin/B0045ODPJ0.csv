8743875,5,B0045ODPJ0,Great video..5 minute increments of different excersize routines that keeps me interested and motivated! The cardio boxing is great. I can feel the difference in my arms and also feel like I might  be able to give someone a good right hook if I was in a threatening situation!,1374451200,3,276,4.63265306122449

8743877,3,B0045ODPJ0,"I needed a low impact cardio video and I got it (I received fast shipping and the DVD was packaged well). Andrea Metcalf does a great job introducing beginners to cardio; If you are out of shape and just need something to slowly get you started, this is the perfect DVD. Each exercise segment is in 5 minute increments, and there are a total of 10 exercises to choose from. The great thing about this DVD is that you can work through all of the exercises from the warm-up to the cool down (50 + minutes) or customize your work-out by picking the 5 minute increments that you prefer.
The reason why I gave this DVD only three stars is because some of the exercises are hit and miss. The warm-up, cool down, higher impact cardio, and kick boxing routines are awesome, but the corny aerobic dance routines are absolutely horrific. In between each kick-boxing routine or higher impact cardio routine there is an extremely corny dance cardio routine. The dance cardio routines are horrible, words cannot describe just how bad they are. Despite the horrible dance cardio routines, I still would recommend this DVD to a friend to add to their workout collection.",1348617600,2,1155,4.666666666666667
