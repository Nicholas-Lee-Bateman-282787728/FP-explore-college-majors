5859842,5,B00DVPMZ0Y,"This is a sadly underrated classic film starring my all-time favorite the great Richard Burton and Rex Harrison.
This film has been buried for years although it was ahead of its time upon its release.
The acting is what is expected from two great actors, and the plot moves swiftly with a highly intelligent and entertaining screenplay.

It's about an odd couple (Burton & Harrison) who share the same house and barber shop. The humor rises from their contradicted personalities and points of view, yet they share genuine compassion for each other.
It is not openly discussing homosexuality but rather subtly hinting at the topic given the era of the film's release.
It is a feel-good movie about friendship, compassion , and appreciating those who love and care about us no matter what.",1380672000,13,787,4.917293233082707
5859843,5,B00DVPMZ0Y,"Two great actors playing highly unlikely roles giving insight into a rather questioning life style.

The dialogue is quite witty and for the most part hilarious.",1380412800,6,161,5.1923076923076925
5859844,1,B00DVPMZ0Y,only looked at about half of it;  just not into 'old queens' bickering about silly stuff.  got it because richard burton and rex harrison are such fine actors; maybe it was better  on the stage.  WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!,1377907200,2,218,4.657894736842105
5859845,2,B00DVPMZ0Y,"Move is not full screen, black shadow box.  Probably would be more helpful if you understood the Queen's English as here in the U.S.A. we are not familiar with all their word meanings.  I was VERY DISAPPOINTED as I expected these two great actors to be very funny in this film as I had been told, but the movie seemed to just drag and go on and on and on to an abrupt and senseless ending.  Before considering buying this movie, you might want to check the critics' reviews and abide by them as I didn't!!!",1411344000,2,506,4.25
5859846,1,B00DVPMZ0Y,This production has two gay characters that are totally pathetic in situations that ware horrible.  The writing and acting seems to be totally geared toward painting gays as sick and disgusting people.,1407283200,,201,5.28125
5859847,3,B00DVPMZ0Y,"With all the MOD videos available, why does Fox cheat us out of the correct aspect ratio or 16:9 videos?
Warner Archive, Sony Select, Universal Vault, most of MGM Limited give us the correct aspect ratio, most enchanced to 16:9 screens. Why does Fox give us Pan and Scan  or widescreen 4:3 versions? It is a disgrace!
Staircase would have been more involving if it were 16:9, but it isn't.",1399766400,7,389,4.557142857142857
5859848,5,B00DVPMZ0Y,"Two great actors in a realistic and moving film. The master is very good.
The DVD is non-anamorphic letterbox. A must see.",1396483200,2,122,4.590909090909091
5859849,2,B00DVPMZ0Y,"I felt like this movie could not make up its mind.  Is it funny?  Is it a drama?  Is it supposed to be sending a message?  If so, what is it?  Wow.  I have always wanted to see this movie and now that I have, I wish I hadn't seen it.  It depressed me to the point where I did not care to watch another movie for a long while after.  It left a bad taste in my mouth.  The performances were ok, for what the actors had to work with.  I really don't recommend this movie at all unless you are Rex Harrison and Richard Burton fans, which I am and that is the reason I bought it.  I will watch it further down the road and see if my opinion changes, but right now, it will just remain a bitter memory.",1394928000,2,696,3.797202797202797
5859850,5,B00DVPMZ0Y,"This movie is like a gay version of  ""Whose Afraid of Virginia Wolf"" (without the surprise ending). The two men in ""Staircase"" bicker, snap, and insult one another. However, on some weird level they care for each other...and that about sums up the entire movie! You never see the daughter, or find out what happens in court, but you certainly hear a lot of clever insults!
The movie is interesting to watch if you like a lot of verbal drama, and if you are fans of either Rex Harrison, and or Richard Burton. Today's audience members do not fully understand how shocking it was to see these two (in real life very women oriented) actors, playing gay lovers....""for heavens sake, Burton was twice married to Elizabeth Taylor in real life!""
The dialogue is interesting to listen to, and the insults, at times, can be gems. However, there are times when the movie can drag on, and or be politically incorrect for todays generation. However, please keep in mind, in those days gays in movies were often depicted (as wrong as it was) as people who couldn't live with being gay, and would often commit suicide by the end of a film. In fact, this movie, ""Staircase"", pocks fun at that clich type of ending when Harrison believed Burton tried to kill himself...only later to find out it was one of Burton's fanting spells. I especially thought it was funny how Harrison cried out ""don't leave me Harry"", only to slap Burton in the face and say, ""bad Harry bad,"" when Burton began to breath again.
Now a days there is too little dialogue in films, and what there is, can often be predicted. This film, ""Staircase"" is nothing but dialogue, and it's fun to watch. Also, it does not have a sad ending (unlike the ""Children's Hour"", or even ""Broke Back Mountain""). SPOILER ALERT In fact, in the end, Harrison insults Burton, but when reaching the street corner he cries for Burton (scared of his trial), and the two men walk off together.",1388016000,3,1925,4.612244897959184
5859851,4,B00DVPMZ0Y,WONDERFUL PERFORMANCES BY TWO AMAZING ACTORS AT THE TOP OF THEIR GAME...TOTALLY DIFFERENT TO ANY PREVIOUS ROLES...VERY POIGNANTAND INVOLVING FILM,1386633600,,145,6.3
5859852,2,B00DVPMZ0Y,"Don't let the cheery cover on the DVD box mislead you. I would have expected Rex Harrison and Richard Burton to do a much better job with this material. The story becomes almost a laughable ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf"" gone amuck. Over the top performances by both actors are uncomfortable to watch. Save your money, unless you have an interest in how these relationships are represented in the cinema of that time. So unpleasant, I disposed of the DVD.",1385164800,,457,4.725
5859853,5,B00DVPMZ0Y,"I remember years ago Siskel and Ebert did a special about the portrayal of gays on film up to that time.  ""Staircase"" was given a cursory mention and generally they dismissed the film as being rife with stereotype.  Maltin's movie guide called the film a curio that doesn't stand up for today's more sophisticated viewers.  I hadn't thought about the film until a fellow co-worker and film buff told me it was one of her favorite films.  This took me aback because myself and her are on opposite sides of the political spectrum and I thought she wouldn't take kindly to a film perceived to be insensitive.  Having now seen the film I can say it has stood the test of time and misunderstood at the time of its release in 1969.  Based on a stage play by Charles Dyer the film concerns a couple who are partners in business and bed.  Charlie(Rex Harrison) is flamboyant and Harry(Richard Burton) is melancholic.  They bicker and backbite like any couple in a long term relationship.  Their relationship is at a crossroads with Charlie awaiting a visit from his estranged adult daughter and a court date for public lewdness.  Harry, with his head wrapped in a bandage, frets over his hair loss and cares for his bedridden mother who constantly inquires as to why he never married.  Both Harrison and Burton are outstanding and have definite chemistry.  This is tricky material and handled sensitively by its makers and I think would be appreciated by a modern audience.",1382832000,17,1465,4.724409448818897
5859854,3,B00DVPMZ0Y,"This film received a lot of bad reviews when it was released and until now it has been unavailable on DVD.  It's not a great movie, maybe not even a good one.  But if you can deal with the stagy, artificial sounding dialogue and the claustrophobic atmosphere in much of the film, it's worth the effort.  It presents a touching, sad and sometimes funny glimpse into the difficulties associated with growing old in an indifferent world. It also gives us a genuine sense of what it must have been like to be gay at a time when sexual liberation was only for heterosexuals. The film works because of the talent of the two great leading actors.  Harrison and Burton inhabit their characters and make us see them as fully realized, complex people full of virtues and flaws, somehow annoying and likable at the same time. I doubt that less talented actors could have pulled this off.  I've been surprised at how this film has lingered in the back of my mind.  As I said, it's certainly no masterpiece, but when I think of it I feel compassion for those who are marginalized for being different or ignored simply because they are no longer young.",1380844800,11,1138,4.553921568627451

8598418,5,B00DVPMZ0Y,"I saw this movie when it first came out.  I thought at the time that it was one of the best movies I'd ever seen.  And when it became available on VHS tape, I bought it and have watched it periodically over the years (yes I still have my VHS equipment with plenty of redundancy in case of breakdowns, plus boxes of blank tapes for recording).  I'm about to order the DVD and look forward to enjoying it again in that format (probably struck from a tape).  There's something so magic about a film that you just know shouldn't have ever gotten made.  It's like a little guilty pleasure where you know you're getting by with something you shouldn't be allowed to see.  Great acting, great direction, brilliant interior camera work and lighting, great nasty old bed-ridden mother yelling out ""sodomite!""

8598422,2,B00DVPMZ0Y,"Stanley Donen made some great screen achievements like ""Charade"" and ""Arabesque"" and even ""Singing in the Rain,"" but later he made some pretty awful movies with great stars in rather tawdry films like the ""Lucky Lady"" blockbuster with Liza Minnelli, Burt Reynolds and Gene Hackman (1976) and in 1969 he directed this misfire, ""Staircase"" starring Rex Harrison and Richard Burton as aging homosexual hairdressers in the film version of Charles Dyer's play.  It is well photographed by the great Christopher Challis, but the music by Dudley Moore is totally forgettable, and the hideous drag queens at the films opening who sing the title song, do not do anything for the gay sensibility.  Avril Angers has a bit part as a neighbor and Cathleen Nesbit must surely regret, and, if not, really should regret playing the part of the mother.  It is a most unflattering and sad last look at her.  Harrison comes off the better and Burton has had a track record of appearing in some pretty awful roles for a continued string without Liz, perhaps not being any good since ""The Spy Who Came In From the Cold"" in 1965.  The real question about this movie is why it was made in the first place because it only makes people feel sorry for gay characters and the whole thing comes off as undignified.  Cinema Archives.

8598423,5,B00DVPMZ0Y,"Richard Burton and Rex Harrison play a gay couple who own a barber shop and they do an unbelieveably great job, which is a tribute to their acting. They are truly acting greats and this movie confirms it. They convince you that they really are a gay couple who have the same problems any couple has, the same kinds of arguments, etc. The movie takes place over a period of one night, the night before one of them is about to go on trial for propositioning a police officer. They discuss their past, both the good and the bad, and their possible future if he goes to jail. Now I admit that many professional critics poo-poohed this 1969 movie as trite and phony when compared to the original stage play at the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1966 but, as I didn't see the original stage play it doesn't matter to me one little bit what they thought. I'm glad I added it to my collection.",1423440000,4,883,4.357575757575757
