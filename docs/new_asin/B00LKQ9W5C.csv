8666333,5,B00LKQ9W5C,"Ordered for a friend cause she wanted ""Flashdance"" on dvd..  Personally, I think ""Fame"" is a much better movie...doesn't it rather go w/out saying?  Irene Cara & Brono rock out while Jennifer Beal's does none of her own dancing.  Keeping the ""Fame"" dvd - she can have the ""Flashdance"" one.  Excuse me, but ""Fame"" has Howard Stein in it...",1475107200,,338,4.677966101694915
