8586739,4,B00CVB6XHA,It's a little shlocky but OK. Most of these situations would not be realistic in ANY point in time.,1512345600,,99,4.2631578947368425

8586741,4,B00CVB6XHA,"MGM pairing of Robert Taylor's {RT}  matinee  idol profile with Wallace Beery's {WB} pug ugly mug would seem to be the casting  of ""The Odd Couple"".  But  together they blend well in  their respective acting styles and personnas  in  how they play against each other in  this lively and entertaining  period melodrama.

 Blake Cantrell {RT} is a feckless  Maryland plantation  owner who goes bankrupt and loses his plantation,  his self respect and winds up in jail as a  drunkard. Captain ""Boss Starkey {WB} runs a stagecoach / freight line for Ms. Susan Griffith {Florence Rice} battling  opponents, the railroad {who wants to buy  Griffith out} all the while somebody is making  tidy rakeoff""s on the side by  smuggling contraband slaves without Starkeys and Griffith's knowledge.

Cantrell and Starkey, always at loggerheads now become ""master and servant"" as Starkey buys Cantrell's  jail term to both use and humilliate him as an indentured servant working as a teamster taking  care of  horses and hauling freight. But Starkey mis-calculates because Cantrell finds out about  the illegal smuggling operation and from here the film goes into overdrive with skullduggery,  redemption, brawls,  murder and an ""unholy' reconciliation  with some surprising and unexpected plot twists.

Realistic Fisti-cuffs and Brawls  regularily puncutate  the scenario with two {2} between RT and WB being espiscally well  played.  Woody Van Dyke a top rank  MGM director keeps  the film smartly  moving and there is an outstanding supporting  cast including Charles Bickford, Barton Maclane and Charley Grapevine  who provide sterling support -  espiscally C.Bickford.

This is a nice film  with Taylor and  Beery giving excellent performances  with good production values and  plenty of ""a fighin and a feudin"".
 I give this film between 4 and 4 1/2 star rating - Recommended",1445817600,,1865,5.279310344827586

8586743,4,B00CVB6XHA,"The subject matter of the film is the rivalry between the Stage Coach lines
on the National Road, and the new fangled railroads. This takes place
at Cumberland, Maryland, where the B&O railroad and the National Road
came together. (Actually, a few years later, the C&O Canal as well.",1424131200,,283,4.795918367346939
8586744,4,B00CVB6XHA,Entertaining western with a couple of good fight scenes between the principals. Both Beery and Taylor are terrific. The trailer is included and is hilarious because it shows so many scenes that are not in the final print.,1386720000,,221,4.842105263157895
