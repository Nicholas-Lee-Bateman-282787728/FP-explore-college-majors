This video shows how powerful our hopes can be on influencing our beliefs.  Thousands of believers in facilitated communication have watched this video without effect on their belief in FC.  Like Dr. Biklin in the video, they contest the validity of the studies, the methods, environments, and biases of the testing, without questioning the same of themelves.

To be fair to Biklin, the interviews occurred relatively early in the life of FC, and his position on validation has moderated, somewhat.  Standards are far more rigorous now, and we have seen that FC does provide a viable and valid method of communication for a small number of people ... and that is no small thing. (Anyone acting as a facilitator who sincerely wants to know the extent of their influence on the outcomes, simply has to close their eyes for a short time during the process) To reject FC absolutely, or accept it absolutely, is the same enslavement.

As someone who embraced FC for a few months before having to deal with the ramifications of a number of allegations of sexual abuse (truly brutal, horrific depictions of cruelty and evil), the work of Dr. Shane and a few others, was a godsend. This was at least a year before this video aired on Frontline, but the few written accounts I could find questioning FC's validity were enough for the police to focus their investigations on the phyiscal evidence (or, rather, the total absence of it), and the the glaring discrepencies of the testimony.

Biklin, by all accounts, is a kind and decent man, who has always only wished and worked for the betterment of the appalling lives we've imposed on people with disabilities. How terrible it must have been for him when the cracks first appeared, and he glimpsed the realizations of Pandora.

In the darkest parts of each of our failures is a pasage to our liberation.  The greater the failure, in scope or renown, the greater the promise of our deliverance.  To unequivocally accept and acknowedge failure is the light which reveals the passage.

The last line in this video, of accepting people for who they are, rather than who we want them to be, is the truest.
