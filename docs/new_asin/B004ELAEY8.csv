8427194,5,B004ELAEY8,"This was one of my favorite shows, even though I was twenty-something when it first aired.  One of my favorite aspects of this show is how we get to travel around the world with Eliza and her family, experiencing different cultures, customs and sometimes languages.  I think I'd have loved this show even without the fascinating 'talking to animals' thing.

This is a great series for getting people interested in other parts of our world.  I also deeply appreciate the way it makes you care about animals/the environment, not in a preachy sort of way, but YOU care because ELIZA and her family care, to the point of being willing to risk their lives.

There is also an awesome movie you absolutely cannot miss out on-it's a whole lot less expensive than the series, and is a good starting point if you want to try a bit of the series before jumping in the water.  You won't be sorry!",1306800000,2,884,4.528301886792453
8427195,5,B004ELAEY8,"I am a huge fan of the Wild Thornberries and I wish that Nickelodeon did not take this off of the air. Now that Amazon.com has released the box sets, I am buying them. I purchased season 2 first because I have a Netflix subscription which has season 1 on it (and only season 1). I looked up on the internet using Google for which season did it show Eliza Thornberry (the main character) receiving her powers to ""talk"" to animals. That episode is titled ""Gift of Gab"" and it is on Season 3. Well, the internet told me season 2 had Gift of Gab, so I purchased Season 2 thinking it had Gift of Gab. It does not. Season 2 contains these episodes:

Disc 1

-Rebel Without a Trunk
-Pal Joey
-Rain Dance
-Darwin Plays the Palace

Disc 2

-Stick your Neck Out
-No Laughing Matter
-Chimp off the old Block
-Koality and Kuantity

Disc 3

-Chew if by Sea
-Clash of the Teutons
-You Ain't Seen Nothin', Yeti
-On the Right Track

(In a seperate box)

Disc 4

-Polar Opposites
-Two's Company
-Show Me the Bunny
-Reef Grief

Disc 5

-Thornberry Island
-Dances with Dingos
-Tanper-Proof Seal
-You Otter Know
-Have Yourself a Thornberry Little Christmas

Yes, it comes in one package, but the five DVD's are spilt up. I do not know why Nickelodeon decided to do that, but they did. Now, here are the specifications of the DVD's for you:

1999/COLOR/493 MIN/NOT RATED/ANIMATED/FULL SCREEN

I hope that I was a help to you. I am a fan of the actor Tim Curry who does the voice of Nigel Thornberry (the father). He also does a voice on The Adventures of Captain Planet which I also did a review for (he is the computer MAL). So, go have fun with Eliza Thornberry and add this to your Thornberry collection today!",1306195200,4,1692,4.364217252396166
