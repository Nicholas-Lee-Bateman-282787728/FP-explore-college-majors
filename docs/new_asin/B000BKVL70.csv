I gave this item 5 stars because I did not have any problems, the product was what I had read and hopped for.",1361577600,,171,4.0588235294117645
8088402,3,B000BKVL70,"I wish there would have been a caveat, I bought this for my middle school students, but it talks about(and describes) human sacrifice, cannibalism, and flaying. It's very informative but not what I needed.",1240358400,4,205,5.0588235294117645
8088403,2,B000BKVL70,This is more of an introduction than the whole story. It's obviously a one hour show without the commercials. 90% of it is not about The Aztec Empire but instead of how the Spanish took over the Aztecs. Better to wait and see if it's repeated on the History channel.,1208649600,14,266,4.34
8088404,4,B000BKVL70,"Very solid historical perspective of the Aztecs. The DVD gives a very broad understanding of a very complex and detailed civilization that is hard to cover in just an hour. Interesting perspectives from a number of different scholars the DVD gives a beginning to end broad sweep of the Aztec empire. Excellent for people/students that are just starting out, and studying the Aztec Empire.",1168473600,22,388,5.078125
8088405,4,B000BKVL70,"I usually hate cheesy historical reenactments.  However, I loved seeing the gorgeous feathered headdresses, colorful chest pieces, and full loincloths of the Aztecs.  To be honest, I saw few women being reenacted and that may be a bit problematic.  Still, the reenactments helped add a dimension to the ornate and simplistic paintings done of the past empire.

This documentary has interviews from both American and Mexican scholars, it's not one-sided.  The work ends by saying Aztec treasures are still being found.  I love having that hope that more may be to come.

The documentary was top-focused, meaning the Aztec gods and kings took precedence.  I once saw a painting of an Aztec scene which implied that they had clowns.  What about those people?  Did the Aztecs put boards on their children's head to make them pointy like the Mayas did?  What happened in Aztec marketplaces?  The film covers Moctezuma and his death.  However, according to Stephen Murray's book ""Latin American Homosexualities,"" Moctezuma may have been captured by the Spanish by being seduced by a blond, Spanish male youth.  That doesn't come up in this work.  Malinche, the Native woman that may have helped the Spanish, is brought up here.  However, the contempt that some modern Mexicans and Mexican Americans hold for her is not brought up.

In a different documentary by the History Channel on the Incas, it said the Incas predicted their downfall in 1519 by a foreign force.  Here too they bring up that prediction with the Aztec.  This seems like too much of a coincidence.  I wonder if this is something that imperialist cultures have made up or hype in order to excuses the ravages of imperialism or colonialism.

This work probably just skimmed the surface of the Aztecs.  However, for a persont that knows little of that culture, this was an informative work.",1158883200,25,1850,4.957654723127036
