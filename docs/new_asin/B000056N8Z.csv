1398543,4,B000056N8Z,"Backstage brings a great insight in the business of music, relationship between talent, labels and overall presentation and performance delivery. It does not have full performances as the movie is based on what really happens Backstage but it provides an inside look to the lives of the artist as they continue on their tour. The movie depicts the reality behind the monotonous performances and hard reality from the performance and business point of view.

This movie is great for someone trying to find out more about the business and if this extreme lifestyle is what you really want. Collaborations between labels, Roc-A-Fella, Wu-Tang, Desert Storm, Def Jam, has to be extremely tight and tensions and overall weight of the tour take full effect as the tour goes on.",1275696000,,771,5.0234375
1398544,4,B000056N8Z,"This Dvd is a classic I purchased this unit about 8years ago and is still good. Classic: Dmx,Ja Rule,Jay-z and More! This Dvd is 9.9 out of 10 is a must have 100%",1215993600,,162,3.9393939393939394
1398545,5,B000056N8Z,"What an absolutely fantastic film is all I can say - and WOW.

This movie is far superior to the Up in Smoke tour DVD which offered very little insight into the real mind-set of the rappers featured there (such as Dre, Snoop and Eminem). Where that movie was content to show the performances BackStage offers the viewers much more.

DMX is allowed time to shine and comes across very well - especially given the controversy that is oft associated with him and his music.

Jay-Z remains quite mysterious throughout and the partnership of Redman/Methodman is not focused on enough - However it is great to see Redman interviewed as he is a truly unrecognised genius within the rap world.

Relatively new rappers such as Memph Bleek, Ja Rule and Beanie Segiel are given time to shine and also come across very well - the scene where an interviewer asks why they like to watch gangster movies on their tour bus is excellent; especially when Good Will Hunting is revealed as their most recent viewing pleasure!!

But this movie really succeeds as a documentary on Damon Dash (charismatic CEO of Roc-a-fella records) who is given plenty of screen time and interviews - This is one man not to be messed with as his vehement dissing of DefJam's attempt to over-shadow Roc-a-fella throughout the tour shows.

All in all an excellent documentary - Highly recommended for fans of both rap and also documentaries as a genre.",1206403200,,1412,4.742857142857143
1398546,5,B000056N8Z,"This is a great movie that loves behind-the-scene action. YOu will learn more about some of your favorite artists and see their take on everyday tasks and discussions as human beings, not just as celebrities.",1194825600,,208,4.9714285714285715
1398547,4,B000056N8Z,"DMX is sick and Meth and Red were awsome too. It was crazy seein Methodman and Redman perform flyin though the sky kickin off their Timbs. Pain in tha ass was some funnt sh*t too doin his Tony Montana Impression Eatin a sandwich. This DVD is worth watchin, peace",1107475200,,262,4.36734693877551
1398548,4,B000056N8Z,"They needed to extend the length of this DVD. Despite the title i thought it would have more concert footage. Its fustrating when one of your favourite songs begins and is then cut off, and believe me with the rappers featured on this DVD its rather frequent. DMX is by far the most entertaining because what he says is most interesting and at times relevant. Its good to see how Ja acts in a interview senario. he seems very on point. Method Man and Redman are themselves, entertaing and so high they could kiss tha sky as always. This DVD was a must for my collection beacuse of the all-star cast. If u respect the people mentioned above i recommend u buy this DVD. Definatly blunt somkin material.",1027382400,5,700,4.4765625
1398549,4,B000056N8Z,"THIS IS A DOCUMENTARY TYPE MOVIE FOR TRUE HIP-HOP FANS.  I RANK IT AS GOOD, I THINK IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER IF MORE OF THE ACTUAL CONCERT WERE FEATURED.  IT WAS REAL,YOU GET TO SEE THE PERFORMERS AWAY FROM THE STAGE... SOME OF THE PERSONALITIES BEGIN TO SHINE THROUGH THEIR ONSTAGE PERSONAS, (THE BRAINS AND THE BRAWN)...",982800000,,323,4.551724137931035
1398550,4,B000056N8Z,"I purchased this DVD because I was interested in seeing what actually goes on at a concert from the viewpoint of the artist.  I didn't get a chance to see the concert so I also wanted to see if they were going to show a few performances as well.  Overall, this is a good DVD but if you are not a Rocafella fan or if you do not like the artists that were featured in this concert, then you will not like the DVD.  If you are a hip hop fan like I am, you will enjoy the artist profiles on Jay Z, DMX, Ja Rule, Memphis Bleek, Beanie Sigel, Amil and even DJ Clue.  You get to see what actually goes on with the tour buses, groupies and with the artists that have to spend nearly 3 weeks with each other on various tour stops.  You get to see a few freestyles from the artists as well.  Overall, this was an excellent documentary of what goes on at a hip hop concert.  The only thing about the DVD that I wish there was more of, was actual concert photage.  Redman & Method Man show up with ""How High"", Redman & Busta Rhymes perform most of ""Da Goodness"" and DMX and Jay Z give excerpts of their songs but nothing in it's entirety.  If you like hip hop as much as I do, this is the DVD for you.",982627200,4,1189,3.9414225941422596
