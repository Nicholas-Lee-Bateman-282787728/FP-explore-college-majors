8288187,1,B001CLUI3A,"If you want to watch a couple guys catching fish, turn on the TV and watch a fishing show.  This is not really much of a teaching DVD as an advertisement for a number of Berkley products. Time after time they lay an assortment of Gulp baits or splash a screen between scenes for Fireline or some other Berkley product.

I live in Wisconsin and fish on the Mississippi River. Very little of the DVD was dedicated to fishing for river walleye. I don't know how to fish for them and am no closer to knowing after buying and watching this DVD.

When I read the title and description of the DVD, I was hoping for detailed tactics for finding fish, rigging baits and a discussion of the proper ways to present baits to catch walleye. Instead, it's just some guys catching fish. In fairness, there is some discussion and tips given but the devil is in the details. If you're new to walleye fishing and hoping for someone to teach you, this DVD isn't it.  Save the money and put it in a cookie jar for a trip to Manitoba or a fund to pay a fishing guide.",1341273600,3,1046,4.241206030150754
