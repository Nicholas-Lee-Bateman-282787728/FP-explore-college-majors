2316365,5,B0009S4IM4,Well being an 80s kid I couldn't help but fall in love with the Dukes. This is one of the shows that was pure family entertainment. Too much of what is on today is either inappropriate or reality garbage. The dukes are pure escapism. Yes it's stretches credulity at times but if your hour is filled with fun laughter and family love then it is all worth it. It also had a great supporting cast with James best Sorrell Booke and of course Denver Pyle. So I give it four stars for fun and the fifth star for sentimental reasons.,1398470400,,526,4.27

2316492,5,B0009S4IM4,"One Amazon reviewer wrote that Season Four was the best of the Seven, and so, my first DVD set was well-chosen. Got to admit, though, the deciding factor was the ""Miss Tri-Counties"" episode I remembered (and which could be seen as a signature show - Catherine Bach was surely the number one attraction - and this episode was a showcase for her).
The show had ""everything"": action (including the best stunts ever performed on TV and probably in most movies); romance, comedy (funny, dialogue with outrageous sight gags that the Keystone Cops wouldn't dream of), light drama;  situations which built and built until the final unraveling, usually in the last minute or so of the show.
You think you have a handle on the plot, then all of a sudden...a bump in the road. A character doing some *uncharacteristic*.
There is a poignancy to the stories, even when some sporadic silliness creeps in. (Plus, the uncomfortable ""Confederate"" references).
Uncle Jesse, Daisy, Luke, and Bo live on little money...and alot of ""country smarts"". Criminal-minded people with clean hearts and alot of generosity. Their ""past"" machinations often come in handy while they have to decoy and distract the incredibly corrupt Boss Hogg and his fumbling right hand hand man, Sheriff Roscoe P. Coltrane, incidentally his Brother-In-Law. And, interestingly enough, Uncle Jesse's best friend! (Story goes that they shared a moonshining partnership which permanently bonds them...when the chips are down, they stand up for each other).
""Smokey And The Bandit"" must be cited as a big part of the inspiration for the show, not to take a single frame away from the series.",1229731200,,1639,5.07037037037037
2316493,3,B0009S4IM4,"This 1981-82 Season of the DUKES OF HAZZARD was probably the last strongest season throughout the Dukes whole 7-year run on CBS for various reasons.

Because for starters; the DUKES OF HAZZARD's 4th Season was the last season with Bo and Luke Duke before they of course got abruptly replaced by their cousins Coy and Vance Duke(Byron Cherry, Chris Mayer)still letting us mourn the loss of Deputy Enos Strate(Sonny Shroyer)especially since this was the last real season with Deputy Cletus Hogg(Rick Hurst) and the only real full season without Enos & with Cletus, since Cletus was abruptly dropped from the show in the 5th Season of the DUKES OF HAZZARD when Cletus's predecessor(Enos) returned to the show and to Hazzard County to get his old job back as Sheriff Rosco's fellow deputy since Sonnys short-lived spin-off series ENOS faltered after only one season leading its cancellation in the Summer of 1981 while this show temporarily left us mourning the loss of Bo & Luke in the Fall of 1982, especially since most people wanted Enos back on the DUKES OF HAZZARD, but didn't really care for Cletus along with the fact that the 4th Season was the only season when Enos didn't come out at all, but most people obviously preferred Enos to Cletus, especially since Cletus was obviously an even bigger doofus than Enos ever was.

For another; this was the last season when the General Lee was still the hottest car on Friday nights, since the Dukes Fourth Season had been the year before KNIGHT RIDER came out and became the hottest car on Friday nights, since KNIGHT RIDER joined the Friday night line-up on NBC in the Autumn of 1982 when the DUKES OF HAZZARD started it's Fifth Season with the new Dukes on CBS's Friday night line-up that same year, which nearly caused KNIGHT RIDER to K.O. the DUKES OF HAZZARD in the process, since the Knight 2000 had obviously outclassed the General Lee big time, since KITT was more astonishing and a lot flashier than the General Lee ever was, especially since the Knight 2000 on KNIGHT RIDER was the car everybody wanted back then, unlike the General Lee, especially since KNIGHT RIDER nearly tarnished THE DUKES OF HAZZARD during KNIGHT RIDER's First Season on NBC all the way from the Fall of 1982 thru the Summer of 1983, which was of course before KNIGHT RIDER was moved to Sundays back in August of 1983.

Additionally, this 1981-82 Season of the Dukes takes me all the way back to memory lane to the recession we had back in 1981-1982 when Ronald Reagan was our president and when CBS had moved the DUKES OF HAZZARD from 9PM to 8PM when the INCREDIBLE HULK was abruptly cancelled in November of 1981, which contributed to the Dukes taking over the Hulk's 8PM time-slot on CBS's Friday night line-up.

In addition, the Dukes Fourth Season also takes me back to memory lane when CBS's motto was ""Reach For The Stars on CBS"", which was CBS's motto from the Fall of 1981 thru the Summer of 1982.

Another reason why I like the Dukes 4th Season so much is because it had some interesting episodes like ""Double Dukes"", ""The 10-Million Dollar Sheriff"", ""Goodbye General Lee"", etc., plus the DUKES OF HAZZARD's 1981-82 Season had some pretty interesting guest stars in it too like
*Country Western singer(Mickey Gilley) doing a cameo appearance in ""The Sound Of Music Hazzard Style"" episode

*Steve Williams in the ""Dukes In Danger"" episode before his Capt. Fuller days on 21 JUMPSTREET

*William Smith in ""The Ten Million Dollar Sheriff"" episode

*Tim O'Connor in the ""Bad Day In Hazzard"" episode after his co-starring days as Dr. Huer on BUCK ROGERS

*Laurette Spang in ""The Fugitive"" episode after her co-starring days on BATTLESTAR GALACTICA

This DUKES OF HAZZARD 4th Season DVD also has an interesting bonus feature with John Schneider(Bo), Tom Wopat(Luke), Catherine Bach(Daisy), and producer(Gy Waldron) explaining to us how they all got hired to do this show and also shows all 5 of the '69 Dodge Chargers that they used for the General Lee to do the stunts on the DUKES OF HAZZARD, since the cars would sometimes even break in half doing a stunt when they landed kind of like the KITT Trans Ams did on KNIGHT RIDER sometimes when they'd do a stunt, which was why Glen Larson would have them use 4 Trans-Ams for the Knight 2000 on that show, which was also the same strategy and technique that Glen Larson had them use for Colt Seavers(Lee  Majors) GMC Sierra Grande pick up on THE FALL GUY, since the axle on the trucks would even break sometimes during a major stunt.

So I recommend this DUKES OF HAZZARD DVD to anyone who was a major Dukes fan and to whoever watched the DUKES OF HAZZARD religiously every Friday night on CBS's Friday back in the early 1980's.",1217289600,4,4712,4.705097087378641

I only hope that the two reunion movies will also be released on DVD very soon,because I just can't get enough of ""The Dukes of Hazzard"".

A tip for all people who loves the show as much as I do:If you really are a fan of the original TV show ""The Dukes of Hazzard"" than go and watch John 'Bo Duke` Schneider`s new movie ""Collier & Co - Hot Pursuit"" which is currently running in a couple of cinemas for only a short time. It's not called ""The Dukes"" but it has humour,an awesome '69 Dodge Charger,really hot car stuff,brain and heart and it's entertainment at its best.

2316506,5,B0009S4IM4,"What goes up must come down. Regardless of Bo and Luke's departure following this season, season 5 would've been somewhat of a downward spiral. Anyhow, this was the absolute peak in terms of slapstick, characters perfecting their roles, etc. The episode of ""Million Dollar Sheriff Coltrane"" is my favorite episode of all time. I was in elementary school 25 years ago watching the 81'-82' season on friday nights and I still stand firm on this season being the best of all 7. Even the ""villains"" were the most convincing of all the seasons even though you knew the boys would prevail at the end. Some of the 4 seasons have episodes you watch for friday night nostalgia once more on dvd and then bypass, however, I can't think of one ""filler/subpar"" episode in season 4. Season 2 had several clunkers w/o Rosco and season 3 had a couple ""below standard"" shows as well. For new fans out there...buy season 1 first for character evolution and familiarity...then, jump to season 4 for the BEST overall episodes.

By the last episode of this season the charecters are all that they ever will be or could be. The conversation between Roscoe and Boss when they are stuffing stolen cerdit cards in the door of Roscoe's patrol car says it all.

2316548,4,B0009S4IM4,"First, to all who write this, I am a HUGE Dukes fan. I have loved the show for so long. Now that the show has come out on DVD, I am very happy. As of this writing, I am roughly half way through the 4th season. To me, this seems to be the best season out of all 7. After this season, John Schnedier and Tom wopat decided to leave the show(albeit temporarily). So this season was big for both men.

The episodes are incredibly clear to look at on your TV screen. I give credit to Warner Bros. for the impeccable quality. Another terrific feature is that there are 9 separate discs. No more double DVD discs.

But the best feature is the show itself. The humor is good in places, and very good in others. It is a comedy and should be looked at it as such. Some people were offended by the Rebel flag on the General Lee. To me, this gave the car an identity that makes it stand out from the other characters. Other reviews have mentioned that this is one of the last shows to sit down and watch with the family. Absolutely right! This show, to me, is the by-product of a bygone era.

Terrific purchase if you decide or are thinking about buying the set. As mentioned, definitely the best season of the entire series!

One note of mention, I beleive it was John Schnedier who decided to criticize and downplay the men who played Coy and Vance in Season 5 especially when it came to the men being cast in the 2005 Dukes of Hazzard movie(in the extra feautres section). Very surprised to hear Mr. Schnedier say this. But I understood where he was coming from. John Schnedier, Tom Wopat, and the cast made this show one to remember. CBS had a wonderful hit, and the DVD will make you relive it every time you watch an episode.

BTW, if you are thinking of or going to see the movie, you will be disappointed. The movie is such a far cry from the original series, it is sad. Sometimes, it is best not to mess with an original classic! Thank you Warner Bros. for an american classic.",1126569600,10,1973,4.236702127659575

probably not!
since my daddy (who passed on in 1994) and I watched it together on a regular basis throughout a large portion of my childhood.

thanks for this opportunity to collect my memories...

one quick note
The show seemed odd after the original Bo and Luke left and for good reason. My TV brothers appearances changed and I was never the same nor was the entire cast who still remained. It was an obvious mistake to let the real deal leave the show.
AND why aren't they in the new movie?
they look like they could have played those parts again.

2316587,5,B0009S4IM4,"i cant wait for the 4th season to be released. Ive been a fan of this show since i was a kid and especially of Catherine Bach aka Daisy Duke. I think she was one of the hottest women on tv at the time. All 3 of the seasons so far have been superbly done,including the extras. With each episode comes a new twist or surprise,it seems,except for the car chases. I hope seasons 4-7 are every bit as good as the first 3.",1122681600,3,416,3.9642857142857144
2316588,4,B0009S4IM4,"If only for the appearance of Jonathan Frakes (of ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"") as a clean-shaven young'un who falls for Daisy in ""Mrs. Daisy Hogg,"" or Rosco and his garish rhinestone outfits in ""10 Million Dollar Sheriff,"" this season rates high. Denver Pyle directs a few episodes, and James Best even takes his turn. This might have been the greatest ""maturing"" season for the show, before our two boys took off for part of a season.",1121990400,4,440,4.7272727272727275
2316589,5,B0009S4IM4,"During the 1981-82 season which was shortly delayed for some shows due to a writers' strike,there was some turmoil between the two stars,Tom Wopat and John Schneider. Not rivalry,but their lack of royalty payments for Dukes games,toys and other memorabilia that was selling like hotcakes all over America and a few countries outside America between 1980 and '82. The toys include action figures bearing the likenesses of Wopat and Schneider. Their contracts indicated that they would receive royalty payments for sales of Dukes memorabilia. When that didn't happen,Wopat and Schneider walked out on the Dukes Of Hazzard. However,the two stars returned to DOH in early 1983. There were a few slight changes in the opening and closing montages this season. Schneider is in a different personal scene(in the opener) and a new version of the closing theme. Sonny Shroyer is still out although his spinoff Enos got the Nielsen axe in the spring of 1981. With Boss's cousin Cletus Hogg(Rick Hurst) as Hazzard County's deputy still,Enos was not needed. Daisy(Catherine Bach),Uncle Jesse(the late Denver Pyle),Jefferson Davis ""Boss"" Hogg(the late Sorrell Booke) and sheriff Roscoe Coltrane(James Best) are no different then they were before. Roscoe still has his basset hound Flash(""velvet ears"") and Cooter Davenport(Ben Jones) is still running his service station with a clean shaven face. I incorrectly mentioned in the review for the season 3 set that Cletus was Boss Hogg's nephew. When season 5 comes out,viewers will see two new stars filling the places of Wopat and Schneider. Not only that,viewers will see the original stars' triumphant return.",1121644800,8,1646,5.334615384615384
2316590,5,B0009S4IM4,"Thank you Warner Brothers for releasing one of the most fun to watch shows in the history of television. I have all three seasons to date and the two movies when they came out on video. It is refreshing to be able to watch a show such as this without all of the colorful language that many of today's TV shows seem to possess for one reason or another. I look forward to seeing the upcoming release dates of seasons 5 to 7 and I do hope that Enos the complete series is not too far behind. The Dukes of Hazzard is one show that one never gets tired of watching and the word ""boring"" is not in this show's vocabulary. I also own the complete cartoon series (The Dukes) and it is just as fun to watch as the live action series. Again, THANK YOU WARNER BROTHERS for a suberb job well done.",1118102400,10,786,4.1103896103896105
2316591,5,B0009S4IM4,"I pre-ordered this season as soon it was available - just as I did with the third season, and just as I will with the rest of the seven seasons! This show is the best!

I will not give a review here, but just say THANKS to WB for releasing the show on DVD, and please release the ""Enos"" show and the TV movies as well.

The 7th season isn't a full season. It could be fun with some scenes from other shows where characters from TDOH appeared. Or for instance the whole episode of ""Alice"" episode 8.1 named ""Mel Is Hogg-Tied"" featuring Boss Hogg and Roscoe.

I don't understand why they are dropping the double sided discs - but just as long as the quality and price is the same, its okay.

Live Long and Prosper

2316593,5,B0009S4IM4,"It is with great thanks to Warner Brothers, who has released three season sets of the DUKES OF HAZZARD in one year (2005) alone, for providing the fans with these DVDs at such a rapid pace.  It is with great hope that Seasons 5 - 7 are released just as quickly, along with the reunion movies, the ""Enos"" series and the ""Dukes of Hazzard"" cartoon series.

Season 4, as with all the DUKES releases, are of the utmost quality...clear picture, great sound and awesome packaging! I truly believe that the DUKES sets are the best packaged TV on DVD sets that I own. There are 9 single-sided discs here, each with a picture of a cast member or the General Lee on them!

The extra features are great...I was laughing along with John Schneider, Tom Wopat and Catherine Bach during their commentary for the episode ""Double Dukes.""  Great stuff!  The featurette is nicely done as well, with more interviews of the cast and series creator Gy Waldron.  But man, Tom Wopat wasn't too friendly when speaking of the Coy and Vance characters who replaced him and Schneider shortly during the 5th season!

Season 4 is another great collection of episodes.  I began to look over the episode list for this season and found there are too many highlights to mention.  This season came at the height of DUKES-mania, and I never tire of watching it.  It's great fun, clean and harmless.  I enjoyed it as a child and still enjoy it in my late '20s!

It's also great to see Boss Hogg on the cover...let's hope more cast members make the cover of the box in future releases.

Greatly awaiting Seasons 5 through 7.  Thanks, Warner!",1117238400,23,1603,4.559440559440559
