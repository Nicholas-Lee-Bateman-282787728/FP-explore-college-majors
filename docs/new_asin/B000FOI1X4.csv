8364106,5,B000FOI1X4,"This is an excellent dvd for meditation and a stress-buster. I truly enjoyed the magnificent sunsets, and especially the natural sound of cascading water over the rocks and the natural sound of the bubbling brooks.  Just sit in your favorite place and listen to nature and view scriptures from the Word of God.  I found this to be very relaxing.  I look forward to your next dvd, maybe you can add the loop effect, along with sunrises or the aurora borealis (northern lights), more of God's animal creatures, and scripture selections from the book of Isaiah, Ezekiel, and Job.  Thank you for sharing your photographic visions and ministry with others.",1160611200,3,651,4.890909090909091
