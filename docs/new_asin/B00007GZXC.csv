1811259,5,B00007GZXC,"I have done other yoga ball videos (like Balence Ball) and this is the most fun.  Karen Voight is really friendly and not annoying at all. It is an especially good abs workout - it's not torturous while you do it, but you'll really feel it the next day.  If you have been doing yoga for years, you won't be bored or think it is too simple.  If you have not used a yoga ball before, it makes the workout a lot more fun.  I also find the yoga ball very useful for easing back and neck pain  by lying over the ball (not to be taken as medical advice.) Also, you will feel energized at the end, unlike a yoga video which can relax you to the point of sleepiness.",1070668800,8,658,3.9923664122137406
1811260,4,B00007GZXC,"Karen is an excellent instructor. She seems to always challenge you and keeps things simple. Easy to follow and a very effective work-out. When you are done you know you just worked your butt, legs and tummy in a unconventional way, which keeps things exciting and not boring. Plus she is pleasant to look at and listen to.",1070150400,,323,4.586206896551724
1811271,3,B00007GZXC,"I have other videos of Karens and so I am very familar with her teaching style and workouts.  I found this particular workout to be on the easy side for her.  Many of her workouts are challenging and you feel it after but this was not that challenging for me and the length was short.
I have done stability ball workouts from a fitness show on tv that were much more challenging.",1239667200,,379,4.25
1811272,4,B00007GZXC,"I'm giving this DVD 4 stars because it was what I wanted...a short workout for when I'm pressed for time.  But other than that, I am agreeing with everyone who said it was boring, because it is.  I have another of Karen's videos and it is shot on a beach with fabulous scenery and it just changes the whole tone of the video. This one is just blah with a boring set and boring music.  It's okay for what I wanted it for, but if you're looking for something jazzy and motivating, keep looking.",1220140800,,492,4.212765957446808
1811273,5,B00007GZXC,I love this dvd! It's a quick workout that I can do when I don't have a whole hour to workout.  I ordered this dvd because I became hooked on Karen's style of fitness.  She gives great direction for every move on the ball and she really knows how to motivate you. Loved it!,1186704000,3,273,4.037037037037037
1811274,5,B00007GZXC,"First creative, good warm-up with a ball that I've ever seen. I don't know why another reviewer said this was easy. My body hurt for 3 days. Moves don't have to be difficult in choreography to work your muscles. They just need to be cued well and have a motivating instructor. This DVD has it all. Excellent workout.",1175990400,4,316,4.4655172413793105
1811275,5,B00007GZXC,Exercise vieo that is great for working your abs and legs. It is really a great workout!! Highly recommend this exercise video.,1140566400,8,127,4.818181818181818
1811276,5,B00007GZXC,She gets the job done.  She works out almost every major muscle group in a short period of time.  I find myself using this dvd more than any other. Loved it!,1139875200,9,157,4.032258064516129
1811277,5,B00007GZXC,"I am an avid exerciser, own about 10 different exercise DVD's and go to the gym at least three times a week.  So, not too many things have an effect on my body anymore. Not so with this video.  When I completed the video for the first time, I thought, ""Well that was a complete waste of 25 minutes.""  But the next day, my mind was definitly changed.  My body was sore for the first time in over a year!  The pace of the DVD is deceiving.  You don't break a sweat and it's over before you know it, but you will definitly feel the results the next few days.  I have owned the DVD for over a year and every time I complete it, I am sore the next day.  By far the best buy I have ever made!",1139356800,30,686,3.85
1811278,3,B00007GZXC,"I'll start by saying that the only reason I own this is because it came in the Karen Voight Body Sculpting Kit that I got for Christmas.  I probably would be irritated if I paid money for this, because it is so short and easy.  On one hand it flew by and was enjoyable, but on the other hand it was pretty easy.  The abs portion in particular seemed too easy, but I did feel my hamstrings burning during the leg section.  Also, when she says ""legs"" she really means hamstrings.  The quads and calves are not worked here.  It is a nice short workout to do if you are feeling lazy but want to move, or I put it before I do the a.m. portion of the Streamline Fitness DVD.  The stretching section is quite good.  Oh, it is clearly a toning DVD- nowhere does it say cardio but since a previous poster was upset that there was no cardio I thought I would mention that you shouldn't expect to sweat.",1136073600,24,892,4.145348837209302
1811279,1,B00007GZXC,"Worst DVD ever. No motivation, no results.  I own other dvd's and thought that the TITLE sounds good (should have read the reviews).  once i'd received this, it was a disappointment.  The music is bad, the set is bad, the volume is iffy.  The work on the ball seems made up and not put together with research to help you do what the title states.  No results.

don't waste your money.  Buy Winsor, the Firm, or the 8-minutes.  these you can feel and see the results.",1134086400,5,466,4.337209302325581
1811280,5,B00007GZXC,"The work out in this cd is easy to do, does not take much time if well schedule according with one's day, results appear with constancy and the strech part is a real bonus that I have not seen in any other cd that works with ball, and I personally own 3 different.",1129680000,5,264,4.0
1811291,5,B00007GZXC,"This is the workout CD that I keep coming back to.  It is not too long, a great workout, and really does the job.  It is the best of many that I have purchased.",1118188800,6,160,3.676470588235294
1811292,2,B00007GZXC,"This is the first DVD I bought to use my exercise ball, and I was a little disappointed. The workout is VERY short. I mean, I am out of shape, and I think the only reason I was sweating was from laying on plastic for 15 minutes. I must say it does help you to target muscles pretty well. But I would not recommend it if you want any sort of cardio workout.",1115164800,9,356,3.8904109589041096
1811293,5,B00007GZXC,"I bought this routine on VHS when it first came out, shortly after I purchased my first stability ball.  I have used it regularly ever since without getting bored.  It's not a killer workout but it's short, fun, and on days when I feel unmotivated it gets me going.  I enjoy using it in conjunction with other videos - getting started with the warm up and abdominals, then pausing and doing my cardio for the day, and wrapping up with the lower body work and cool down. This one is worth the money.",1112400000,10,498,4.333333333333333
1811294,3,B00007GZXC,"I broke my back about two years ago, I agree with a previous reviewer that this video is great for people with back problems.  The video is fun, but the actual exercise time is only about 15 minutes, plus an addition 5 minutes each for warm-up and cool-down.  Also, though Karen warns the viewer that a mat and one of her genie balls is needed, her cuing for when to use these is poor (which if you have any of her other videos, this is out of character).  I had to pause my DVD player to get set up.",1104451200,7,500,4.03030303030303
1811295,5,B00007GZXC,"i'm a 54yr old guy and i just got my first excercise ball this week...i do a lot of walking and hiking but have been reinjurying my lower back muscles over and over again.

after much research i realized that my core muscles were weak

and i needed to strenghten them with the Ex ball

i bought this dvd to show me how to use the ball.

(i bought my ball online for only $16 and the dvd $9.99 at target)

this dvd workout allowed me to really work on those core muscles in my lower back ,hip etc....the stretching felt wonderful with the ball cushioning my movements..  when i woke up this morning my lower back felt great.. as if i had had the best massage possible in my most chronically sore areas ..i've already done this workout again today and look forward to doing it tomorrow.",1099785600,7,784,4.263513513513513
1811296,3,B00007GZXC,"I am in shape and have extensive experience w/ fitness...This is an easy routine on the ball. You can feel some results if you work it hard, otherwise, good to do if your sick.",1083801600,2,176,4.205882352941177
1811297,3,B00007GZXC,"I was lucky enough to go into Costco and buy a kit that had ""BLT"" and ""Strong and Streamline"" DVD's that included the body ball, the green genies and a workout matt for just over 20 bucks. Heck I was hoping to just find the ball at that price.
I also bought the book ""PowerSculpt: The Women's Body Sculpting & Weight Training Workout Using the Exercise Ball"" and I have gotten more use out of the ball with that book. I highly recommend that book.
With BLT I can do the stretch in the morning before I get on my Nordik Track Elliptical for 20-30 minutes and then either do an ab or just the stretch.
For me the lower opening squats are fun and burn, but I don't know if I walk away feeling like I got a good workout. It is more of a mini workout and a great way to get ur body moving arround before you sit in your car and then at work. The abs I feel in my upper abdominals only. I need the DVD in the morning to keep me on schedule... or I would never leave for work.
It is NOT an aerobic workout. Nor is it a serious workout.
All said, I love my body ball and I have just ordered another DVD ""Quick Fix - Stability Ball Workout"" and ""Pilates on the Ball"" in an effort to find the perfect body ball workout. I wish the author of ""PowerSculpt: The Women's Body Sculpting & Weight Training Workout Using the Exercise Ball"" would put out a video w/ the workouts. I have been into Pilates for over a year now and I am looking forward to my exercise ball to take me to new levels.",1083369600,10,1477,4.0272108843537415
1811298,4,B00007GZXC,"The workout is divided into sections of abs and buns and thighs, but it's best to do the whole thing at once.  It's pretty short and there is only a warm-up at the beginning.  I found the abs workout to be pretty easy and not long enough.  Some of the legs and buns exercises were difficult, and I could definitely feel them.  All in all though, the calisthenics part of the DVD is pretty short.  About half of the DVD is devoted to stretching.  The stretching is great and it really feels good.  Most major muscle groups are stretched, and there's a fun little section at the beginning where you bounce up and down while sitting on the ball.  I would recommend this DVD to beginning exercisers and as an introduction to using a stability ball.  All the exercises are relatively simple, and the instructors are easy to follow.  This is a quick workout that's good to do at night, because it is relaxing and doesn't get your heart rate up.",1075939200,63,938,4.432748538011696
1811299,5,B00007GZXC,"This is my favorite Voight workout. It's light and easy, but very entertaining and fun. Three different sessions or do them all. The last one for stretching is very good. I use this DVD as a warm up to my yoga practice. Many other good on the Ball DVDs on the market, but this one is one of my favorites. Sara Ivahoe's Yoga on the Ball is a good one too. Try it, you'll like it! Check my other reviews on Amazon.",1074038400,13,412,4.036585365853658
7976630,1,B00007GZXC,"This is supposed to be a 25 minute workout, but when I did it, it seemed to be closer to 20 minutes, of which about half the time was made up of warming up at the beginning and then stretching at the end.  The workout in between was ridiculously short.  I can't imagine anyone unless an absolute beginner, getting anything out of this workout - it is simply too short.  And, if you are an absolute beginner, there are better workouts available, that you will be able to grow into.  Buying this DVD was a waste of money.",1454889600,2,519,4.26530612244898
7976631,5,B00007GZXC,"Very doable, short and effective!",1405296000,,33,5.8
7976632,5,B00007GZXC,"I bought this DVD over 5 years ago and I still love and use it regularly! There is a big emphasis on stretch/relax, which is the perfect motivator to exercise after a stressful day at work, and the exercises FEEL GOOD. I love Karen's personable delivery and she has great pacing throughout the routine. I also enjoy the music; the last track, in particular, is very, very calming and a lovely way to end a workout. All in all, this is my favourite exercise DVD and I can't recommend it enough!",1404259200,,493,4.428571428571429
7976633,5,B00007GZXC,"I chose this rating because
1. I found this product on amazon
2. The sellers were prompt and INCLUDED a bill of sale in their package.
(not like another product I bought)
3. The product was in great condition when I bought it,
Karen Voight's training beats them all.",1372636800,,266,4.448979591836735
7976634,4,B00007GZXC,"This is a great work out DVD for your butt, legs, and thighs. I actually was sore the next day after doing it for the first time. I wish it would get a little more challenging as you go though. After about a month I felt like I was wasting my time.",1353974400,,248,3.7884615384615383
7976635,4,B00007GZXC,"Based on prior reviews, I was torn about buying this,,, but very glad I did.  It is a good, overall workout.  She spends just the right amount of time focusing on each area per the title (BLT), and while it's a workout, it's still enjoyable.  My favorite part is that she gives you 'pointers' as you go, helpful tips to get the most out of the workout.  It is an older DVD, so the styles have changed, but the workout is still a good one.",1335312000,3,438,4.117647058823529
7976636,1,B00007GZXC,"When I ordered Karen Voight's BLT exercise DVD, I had great expectations.  With such title, I hoped for a workout that will target these specific areas and will make me work for it! Instead, it was boring for the most part with a couple of great moments.  I am used to exercise DVD programs and by far this is the worse.  I wished it could have been more challenging and fast pace.  Perhaps this exercise routine would be better someone who has just begun an exercise routine.",1309046400,,476,4.436781609195402
7976637,4,B00007GZXC,Good warm up and routine.  Not too long great for beginners or seniors.  The abs workout is also good for a change in your routine.,1282262400,,131,4.2
7976638,5,B00007GZXC,I am definitely seeing results from this video.  I bought it because I needed to know how to use the ball for effective results.  This video arrived in excellent condition although it was used.,1247788800,,193,4.647058823529412
7976639,5,B00007GZXC,"I've been working out to this DVD for 6 years, and it still pushes me.  Karen Voight gives suggestions for changing the difficulty levels on the exercises, and her timely little reminders to keep your tummy tucked in or square your shoulders keep me on track.  I have solid abs, no back pain, and a firmer butt.  The best part- I can do the entire DVD in 20 minutes from warm up to cool down.  I highly recommend this as the best workout DVD for beginners to those just looking to maintain.  It's the best money I've ever spent on exercise.",1242604800,,540,4.306930693069307
