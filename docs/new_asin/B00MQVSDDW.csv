6600156,3,B00MQVSDDW,"2 Out Of 3 Falls Match: Intercontinental Champion Dolph Ziggler vs. Cesaro - Both men started out with some grounded grappling early with Cesaro getting the early advantage including delivering a big move we haven't seen from him recently as he continued to attack with more aggression as time went on with strikes & submissions to the point where he hurt his own arm executing a power move which Dolph capitalized on himself using a series of submission moves himself with both men trading momentum using one big signature move after another resulting in a fun athletic opening match with the only downfall being that the match stipulation don't being necessary for how the match actually played out.

Brie Bella vs. Nikki Bella - The winner of this match would be the other's personal assistant for 30 days as the girls went back & forth early on with Nikki being aggressive side than we usually see such as her shock treatment backbreaker or dropping Brie face first across her knee & having no issues bending the rules such as pulling her hair while Brie was showcasing her athleticism with her various dropkicks & going aerial on more than one occasion including showcasing something she definitely learned from her husband. The match was solid & I will give credit in that both girls did try very hard here & was the best thing to come out of this ""feud"" so far.

Tag Team Champions Goldust & Stardust vs. The Usos - Both teams went back & forth in the opening minutes before Goldust & Stardust was able to finally isolate one of their opponents away from their tag team partner using strategy that had worked for them in previous matches such as frequent tags & grounding their opponent along with other dirty tactics while The Usos relied on more high flying tactics such as back to back dives over the top & other aerial moves along with other trademark offense to the point where it literally took one quick action to give a team the win. This was another good match between the two teams but didn't stand out above many of the previous matches they've had over the past two months.

Hell In A Cell Match: John Cena vs. Randy Orton - The winner would get a future title shot against WWE Champion Brock Lesnar while it should be noted that technically this is the first ever rematch in the history of Hell In A Cell, Lesnar's advocate Paul Heyman was on the PPV panel, and there was a funny sign that WWE camera caught & stayed on a sign for a few seconds saying ""Enjoy Cena vs. Orton #121."" Both men began trading fist right away taking the fight to the outside before one man was able to gain the advantage using the ringside environment to his advantage such as the cell & steps along with using a chair to various parts of the body remaining dominate stopping his opponent dead in his tracks whenever he attempted to gain momentum including one move that ended one person's career in a previous Cell match along with continuing to use weapons to his advantage & having unique counters from his opponents offense before his opponent was able to fight back using the weapons himself along with using counters & delivering his signature moves on more than one occasion. This was the best Cena/Orton match in close to a year since their T.L.C. match as the Cell & weapons definitely added to the match but Cena was heavily on defense for a majority of the match instead of it being more competitive.

United States Champion Sheamus vs. The Miz - Sheamus dominated early on before Miz was able to catch him off guard only to gain the advantage including sending him over the top rope to the floor as both men traded momentum throughout the match with it coming down to one man catching the other with one big move to where they couldn't get up but the real story of this match was Miz's stunt double Danien Mizdow at ringside continuing to mimic almost everything Miz did to the point where the commentators compared it to a voodoo doll & the crowd was more focused on him than the match with chants like ""Mizdow's Awesome!"" with a very silly aftermath involving all three men that the crowd & even J.B.L. had fun with. The match was average but this was all about Damien Mizdow on the outside.

Big Show vs. Rusev - Show took the advantage on Rusev right away with his heavy chops before Rusev heavily targeted Show's knee taking him off his feet while showing a feat of strength himself with a suplex causing Show to continue to showcase offensive that we haven't seen before including a unique leglock that ""STUNNING"" Steve Austin used to call the ""Hollywood & Vine"" along with power moves such as his signature spear & chokeslam before it took a distraction for one man to capitalize on it in a match that was as good as it could possibly be telling a good story between two men with their size & ability.

Divas Champion A.J. Lee vs. Paige - Paige had her new ""bestie"" Alicia Fox at ringside as both girls traded momentum early on before A.J. was finally able to sustain offense including getting a shot in on Alicia before Paige was able to take back control on the outside using the barricade & working her over in the ring while both men continued to hit some big moves & submission attempts along with once again taking the action out to the floor. This was good match in the series these divas have had against each other.

Hell In A Cell Match: Dean Ambrose vs. Seth Rollins - You knew exactly what direction this match was going to go right away with weapons being tossed into the ring & Ambrose climbing to the top of the cell with the opening moments of action & results being a throwback to the very first two Hell In A Cell matches before the match finally got started with Ambrose punishing Seth because ""you stabbed me in the back you son of a..."" using whatever he could get his hands on along with sacrificing his own body while Seth took advantage of any opening using the weapons such as a chair & table including members of The Authority helping out whenever possible before both men had a very unexpected guest. This was the first Cell match in recent years that looked like a throwback to the early Cell matches where came off as an out of control dangerous environment in what was a very fun match from start to finish.

This was a very in the middle show where most of the midcard matches where just as good or a step below their matches at the previous PPV on free TV or did it's job in furthering storylines & characters but nothing much as far as quality action going out of your way to see with the best matches on the card being the two Cell matches & the opening title match. In the end, this is good for a viewing on the network or a rental at best.",1414540800,7,6691,4.469721767594108
6600157,3,B00MQVSDDW,"2 out of 3 Falls for I.C Title: Dolph Ziggler vs. Cesaro

This is a horrible fued but these two had a pretty good match. 2/5

6600158,3,B00MQVSDDW,"The 2/3 falls match for the IC title between Dolph Ziggler & Cesaro was fine even though it could have gone on longer. The Nikki Bella-Brie Bella match was a clean pretty good bout. The Tag Team title match between the team Goldust & Stardust against The Usos (Jimmy & Jey) was so-so at best. The Hell in a Cell/#1 Contender's match between John Cena & Randy Orton was half-hearted and lack of the credibility of their 2009 encounter. The US title match between Sheamus & The Miz was an average tv bout but still good in it's own right. The Big Show-Rusev match was also felt like an average tv bout too but slower. The Divas title match between AJ Lee & Paige was not great but pretty good. The Hell in a Cell match between Seth Rollins & Dean Ambrose was a hardcore,smash-mouth brawl even with the goofy ending. I give this PPV a 5 out of 10.",1414368000,,844,4.28125
6600159,3,B00MQVSDDW,"Pre-Show: Mark Henry got a squash win over Bo Dallas.

  Cesaro vs Dolph Ziggler (IC title): in a good 2 out of 3 Fall match Cesaro lost 2 straight falls. Which pretty near made me bang my head against the wall in frustration. Cesaro should be world champ and anywhere but WWE cartoon land; he would be world champ right now. Not losing mid-card matches at every friggen ppb.
  Goldust and Stardust retained against the Usos.
  Cena vs Orton 10000000000000 in Hell in a Cell: Cena wants Lesnar one more time so of course the spoiled brat who buries people and had the belt more times than he deserves won this number 1# contender match. The match was surprisingly okay but might as well have not been a Hell in a Cell match. Since there was no blood of course and pretty much just regular match.
  Brie vs Nikki Bella: Nikki of course won with her finisher just so we can sit through horrible segments with Brie as her servant every week.
  The Miz vs Sheamus: Sheamus retained the U.S. title with the brogue kick and afterwards Mizdow got some laughs by mimicking everything Sheamus did to the Miz, even flipping over after an extra brochure kick to the Miz.
  Rusev vs Big Show: in yet another predictable Rusev match; Rusev won by submission. They might as well just have Cena beat Rusev already; we see it coming.
  Paige vs AJ (Diva's title): When Paige was hurt outside the ring; her bestie Alicia Fox threw her back in the ring. That backfired though when AJ put on her submission move to win the match. Paige then slapped Alicia and said she hates her. I love Paige!
  Dean Ambrose vs Seth Rollins in Hell in a Cell: Ambrose beat Cena to get this match but they might as well have said the loser of that match got a number 1# contender match since that's what happened. This is worse than Vince Russo writing.
  Anyway this was more like it Hell in a Cell wise. There was plenty of bumps; like Ambrose and Rollins falling off the side of the cage through announce tables. And Ambrose putting Rollins through a table while in cell as well.
  It's just annoying that predictably Ambrose lost despite being more over than played out Cena. Bray Wyatt for no reason helped Rollins get the win. So Ambrose and Wyatt can can be buried in mid-card matches when Cena gets his millionth title shot.",1414368000,,2296,4.458033573141487

HELL IN A CELL 2014

This was a great event that was right here in Texas, Dallas to be exact. Some of the best matches of the year happened here at this event. Particularly the main event HIAC match between Ambrose and Rollins. Of course the opening match was great as well, plus we had the other HIAC amongst many others.

Spoilers

1.[I-C TITLE 2 OUT OF 3 FALLS]DOLPH ZIGGLER VS CESARO-excellent opening match right here with two of the best in the company. Great back and forth action that never stops with both coming with fast offense. Dolph ends up winning both falls straight but that doesnt tell the story of how competitive this match was. Easily one of the best matches of the night.

2. BRIE BELLA VS NIKKI BELLA-this was a pretty good match between the two sisters here. Good back and forth with the winner getting the other as an assistant for a month. Nikki comes out on top in this one. this is one of the better matches that the two have had.

3.[TAG TITLES]GOLDUST & STARDUST VS THE USOS-another good match with two very entertaining teams going at it. These four always put on good matches together and this was just like the rest. Great action back and forth with the Dust brothers getting the win here in another battle of brothers.

4.[HIAC]JOHN CENA VS RANDY ORTON-this Cell match is excellent and one of the most entertaining matches on the card. These two battle all over the cage using not just the cage but weapons as well. Great match with near finishes and such but it is Cena that pulls out the win after an AA on Orton through a table. He then would get a chance at the title that Brock Lesnar owned.

5.[US TITLE]SHEAMUS VS THE MIZ-this was a good match that turned into the Mizdow show as the match went on. The match was good overall and I even thought Miz was going to take the title watching it live. Sheamus keeps the belt but after the match it is excellent with Mizdow.

6. BIG SHOW VS RUSEV-the legend of Rusev continued to grow here as the USA vs. Russia angle was still going on [still is right now even]. This time it was Big Show taking his turn after friend Mark Henry was unable to get the job done. Nice big man match up right here with power moves and a few kicks thrown in for good measure. Speaking of Henry he distracts Show here and cause the eventual downfall of him. Rusev retains.

7.[DIVAS TITLE]AJ LEE VS PAIGE-another good match follows the last and one of the better Divas matches in a while. These two are great together and I would love to see them have real time to really go at it. AJ takes the win here after a good back and forth battle.

8.[HIAC]DEAN AMBROSE VS SETH ROLLINS-the best match on the card and was very much the main event, I am glad they went with it instead of the Cena/Orton one. now while the other was a good match like I said this was excellent. This was a violent match with Ambrose playing the crazy character very well and Rollins as always looking great with his performance. The match starts on top of the cell and after both take a big bump we move inside. Weapons and the cell are utilized here along with some great brawling. In the end Rollins takes the win after Bray Wyatt makes his return and cost Ambrose.

BONUS

1. MARK HENRY VS BO DALLAS-one of the most underutilized and underrated wrestlers ever in WWE Mark Henry was in action on the pre show. Bo Dallas was hilarious on his way to the ring making fun of us Texans, or at least the city of Dallas. It didn't take long for fellow Texan Mark Henry to get the victory, very quick.

This was a great event right here in Texas that I really enjoyed. On the DVD you also get the Mizdow TV segment, and interviews with Gold & Stardust and The Miz & Mizdow. This was a great event and another fun one that Dallas has hosted.",1425945600,6,3772,4.3107344632768365
