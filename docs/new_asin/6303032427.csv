542480,2,6303032427,"Starrcade ended the pitiful WCW year of 1993. The main event ended up being Vader vs. Ric Flair, who substituted for Sid Vicious (and we all know THAT story!). This match was, in a word, awesome! VERY emotional. It was a classic to say the least. Now, as far as the rest of the PPV goes. DUD. Cactus Jack & Maxx Payne carry the Godwinns to a watchable match (but not good). Other than that? Can you say Shockmaster vs. Awesome Kong? I can't recommend this in good concious, but try to catch the Vader/Flair match if you can.",996451200,,524,4.303030303030303
542481,4,6303032427,"This was the 10th anniversary of Starrcade, and just like the first - Ric Flair stole the show.
2 Cold Scorpio and Marcus Alexander Bagwell (with Teddy Long) vs. Paul Orndorff and Paul Roma (with the Assassin) Teddy Long proves his worth as a manager - or his lack of worth I should say. The same guy that took Doom to the tag team championship just three years before looks about as useful as Jameson, the nerd that used to appear on WWF Prime Time. Pretty good contest between the newly formed team of Orndorff and Roma and the somewhat established young duo of Bagwell and Scorpio. Orndorff and Roma win at just about the 12 minute mark after the Assassin puts something in his mask and headbutts Scorpio with it. These teams would battle for the next few months with each trading wins.
Shockmaster vs. King Kong I'm not sure who the Shockmaster actually fought. Whoever it was, he pinned the wrong member of the Colossal Kongs. I can't believe Harley Race brought the Kongs into WCW to be a dominating force. That's hilarious. Shockmaster, a joke in himself, wins in less than two minutes.
WCW World TV Champion Lord Steven Regal vs. Ricky ""the Dragon"" Steamboat Steamboat, much like Flair later in the show, is contesting for a championship in his home town of Charlotte, NC. Regal had pretty much robbed Steamboat of the TV title a few months earlier at Fall Brawl - and after the two were paired together at Battlebowl in November the feud heated up even more. The two put on a pretty good contest with the result being a 15-minute time limit draw. Although a lot of people hated the old time limit draws, I thought they put a lot more attention on a match that otherwise wouldn't have gained as much heat from the fans. Steamboat vs. Regal is one thing, but having the challenger in complete control when the match only has 45 seconds left adds a lot of suspense to the match.
Cactus Jack and Maxx Payne vs. Tex Slazener and Shanghi Pierce (aka the Godwinns) Cactus somehow goes from main eventing against Vader to having to carry Maxx Payne as a tag team partner. Oh well. Jack and Payne go over the more experienced team after about 7 minutes. Cactus and Maxx would go on to feud with the Nasty Boys in January - their feud culiminating in April in a great Chicago Streetfight as part of Spring Stampede.
WCW International World Champion Rick Rude vs. the Boss Rude's belt is the NWA title he won from Flair at Fall Brawl. ""The British Bulldog"" Davey Boy Smith was to have met Rude for the title but unbeknownst to many, he had been fired from the company shortly prior to the show. Rude had attacked Smith during the November Clash of the Champions and the two had started up quite a feud - but when the Bulldog failed to show up to meet Rude during WCW Saturday Night shortly before the PPV - the Boss came out of nowhere and pinned Rude cleanly in a non-title match. It should be noted that the Boss (or the Big Bossman) was the last man to feud with Rude in the WWF and Rude left the company before the feud could finish. Rude takes the win at the 9 minute mark. The Boss goes on to mediocrity against Vader.
""Stunning"" Steve Austin (with Col. Parker) vs. U.S. Champion Dustin Rhodes Best 2 out of 3 Falls These two lions had wars on many pay-per-views from 1991 to this date, and like all the other matches - this one was very heated. Rhodes and Austin had been feuding over the US title since their Halloween Havoc match two months prior. Austin had busted Rhodes' head open during Battlebowl in November. The first fall is awarded pretty sloppy - as Rhodes sends Austin into Col. Parker on the apron - Austin goes over the top rope to the floor and Rhodes loses on DQ. The challenger gets busted open pretty badly but comes back to get a tainted pinfall on Rhodes two minutes later to win the championship.
Sting and Road Warrior Hawk vs. WCW Tag Team Champions Nasty Boys (with Missy Hyatt) Obviously WCW had little competition for the tag team champions if they had to bring in Hawk to tag with Sting. Very long match that nearly hits the 30-minute time limit. Sting and Hawk execute the Doomsday Device on Knobbs but Missy Hyatt makes the save for her team (and pops out of her bra in doing so). Challengers win on a DQ.
Ric Flair vs. WCW Champion Big Van Vader (with Harley Race) 10 years prior, Flair had met and defeated Harley Race at Starrcade 83 to end Race's last reign as world champion. Now he faces Vader for the title. Vader had left a trail of broken bones in his path over the years of 92 and 93. He took credit for Ron Simmons' shoulder injury, Cactus Jack's head trauma, Sting's broken ribs, running Nikita Koloff out of wrestling, breaking the back of a young wrestler in a sqash match, and most recently attacking Sid Vicious and sending him out of WCW (well, Sid was actually fired for the stabbing incident in the UK but Vader did injure Sid in Sid's last WCW TV appearance). Flair, who many felt was past his prime at the time, was a major underdog against the dominating force of Vader. Flair had put his career on the line and said that if he couldn't win the world title in Charlotte - then he would retire. After 21 minutes of action, Flair clips Vader in the knee and rolls him up for the shocking victory and his 11th world title win. Very good match with lots of psychology. Vader was a fantastic big man and had some incredible stamina for his size (when he was healthy). After the match, Flair is congratulated by both Sting and Ricky Steamboat (two men that would contend for his title in the coming year).
Very emotional main event and a good undercard. Recommended tape.",979084800,8,5622,4.432850241545894
542482,1,6303032427,"If you believe that this is a good PPV, your reading the wrong review. Every match except Flair v. Vader is terrible. Shockmaster vs. a Kong? Twenty Nine minutes for Sting & Hawk v. The Nasty Boys? Flair v. Vader  is good, but not Flair's usual five star match. Get this only to hear the  HUGE pop for Flair.

7835690,5,6303032427,"Much better then WWE's WrestleMania 9 of that same year. The best matches were the TV title match between Rick Steamboat & Steven Regal despite the 15 minute draw,the 2 out of 3 falls match for the US championship between Dustin Rhodes & Steve Austin eventhough it was kind of one-sided score-wise not wrestling-wise and the WCW World heavyweight championship match between Vader & Ric Flair which was named Starrcade's number 1 match by wrestling fans everywhere and with good reason becuase the wrestling in that match was much better then in the match between Bret Hart & Yokozuna at the WM9. The Worst match was the match between The Shockmaster & Awesome Kong(The Male one,not female one) which was still better then the ones at WM9 and that's counting the Doink-Crush match. The rest were OK and much better then the crud I had to put up at you-know-where. I give this event a 8 out of 10.",1277769600,,895,4.635220125786163
7835691,4,6303032427,"For what it was, I really enjoyed this tape. But it was seriously lacking. The production value could have been better. I thought the vignettes were put in weird spots and it just cuts out moments after the main event. I'm like ""wtf, no sign off? Gimme some closure!"" Its got Jesse The Body Ventura aka ""The Man"" on color commentary. The main event carries this ppv without question, loved every second of it. Flair making the desperation cover after overcoming my favorite big man, Vader, is just awesome. Buy this for the main event, to see some old faces you don't normally see, and most of all for some good ol' WCW 'rasslin!",1269475200,,629,4.526315789473684
7835692,3,6303032427,"Starrcade is supposed to be WCW's biggest pay per view of the year, but somehow, when you watch this tape, you don't get that impression.  As usual, WCW spends all its time building up the main event while neglecting all the other matches.

The pay-per-view starts with with Mr. Wonderful getting the win in a decent tag match.  Paul Roma comes up with some interesting selling comments during the match that I particularly liked.  2 Cold Scorpio does some nice moves but of course, he's no Mr. Wonderful.  Manager Teddy Long looked even stupider then than he does now.  Ha ha.

Who should come out next for a match but the legendary Shockmaster.  You've got to love these guys who wear hardhats to the ring.  Remember Regal's real man's man gimmick?  Anyway, Shockmaster wins his match in about 30 seconds by beating another huge guy who's just as fat as he is.

Next is by far the best match on the card.  Ricky Steamboat against William Regal.  This is one of the best matches I've seen Regal in, and that's saying something.  Of course, Steamboat is no slouch either, and even though these guys wrestle to the time limit, they don't even let a second go to waste (unless you get impatient watching the ring psychology at the beginning that Regal likes to use).  Great, great match.

Now we go to Mick Foley's least memorable match ever when he teams up with Maxx Payne to face those guys who were the Godwinns in the WWF.  Don't expect much here.  For some reason when Payne does that Fujiwara Arm Bar move of his, it doesn't seem exciting.  Some guys can pull it off, but when Payne does it, you think, ""So what?""

Fortunately this match is followed by a pretty good US title match between Dustin Rhodes and Steve Austin.  Two great wrestlers in a two-out-of-three falls match.  Can't go wrong there.  Austin wins the US Title in a big upset.  He pulls the tights to win the second fall, but I don't count it as cheating, because he was close enough to put his feet on the ropes and he didn't bother to do that.

Next is Ravishing Rick against the Big Bossman.  Bossman gets cheers from the crowd like crazy.  It's amazing.  I guess there are two reasons for this.  He's real southern (this is WCW), and he's facing a heel that's really over.  Rude takes a nasty backdrop but still manages to win with a sunset flip.  Don't see that too often.  Sunset flips are usually broken with ease when the guy who's pinned uses his calves to smash the pinning guy's face.

Okay, so far we've only had a bad Maxx Payne match and a bad Shockmaster match, but that's not too terrible right?  Unfortunately the next match adds to the mediocrity that is Starrcade '93.  The Nasty Boys vs. Hawk and Sting.  There was only really one thing wrong with this match.  It was WAAAAY too long.  The Nasty Boys should never be in a ring for that amount of time.  You know there's a problem when Sting actually has to show some offense during a match to keep the audience awake.  The match ends in a DQ anyway, when Missy disrupts a cover.  The least she could have done was hit somebody.

Thank goodness the main event keeps the pay per view from being a total dud.  It's not Flair's best match, and it's not Vader's best match, but it's a fun match to watch.  Vader dominates the match early as Flair screams in pain.  You know, Vader's one of the rare guys who was used better by the WCW than the WWF.  WWF just didn't realize how great of a champion this man was.  He's a big name internationally.  But since he's fat, I guess WWF didn't like that.

Flair finally starts winning the match when he cheats and uses a chair.  The Charlotte audience loves this, and I don't blame them.  The match goes on for a little while longer until once again Flair gets a pin literally out of nowhere, and becomes an 11-time world champion.  Talk about saving your pay-per-view from certain death.

Flair said he would retire if he lost against Vader.  I wonder if retirement matches were ever credible.  Piper and Savage come immediately to mind.  Yet, I believe Mero and Kevin Sullivan actually went through with their retirements, so you never can tell.

Is that David Flair I see staring open-mouthed at the camera in this tape?  You can tell that man has the charisma of a wrestling superstar.

Better than a 2006 episode of RAW, but there are definitely better tapes out there.",1155600000,,4352,4.463104325699746
