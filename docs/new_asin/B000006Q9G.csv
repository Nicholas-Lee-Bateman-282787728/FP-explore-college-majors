7904710,4,B000006Q9G,"This is a film that explores the life of our 39th president, Jimmy Carter. The biography takes you inside the life of one of our most moral and upstanding citzens to ever ""hang his hat"" in the oval office. After the film is complete, the viewer is left to think that this was indeed a man of both character and grace: providng in us a sense of longing for someone like him, to return to the White House. The biography takes the viewer on a detailed ride through his days in Georgia, the military, The Presidency, and concludes with Carter's return back to the place where this brilliant life all began, Georgia. This is a biography that will inspire us all, and leave us to hope, that if we try real hard, we can one day reach the ""Moral Precedent"" that this great man has set.",988329600,2,777,4.328767123287672
