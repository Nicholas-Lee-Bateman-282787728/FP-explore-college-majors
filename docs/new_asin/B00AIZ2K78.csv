I loved learning what Bobby was all about and was so impressed by his strong desire to help others, no matter what their skin color was.  Ethel seemed to be the driving force behind him! I didn't know she was so sassy and such a free spirit.  What a woman!  I'm a huge fan!  This doc expressed a true love story between two amazing couples.

5439327,3,B00AIZ2K78,"Perhaps a Kennedy should not have made this documentary, it is pure hagiography with the personal touch added in of being done by her youngest daughter.  What it accomplishes, quite brilliantly, is to present the positive side to Ethel and Robert with virtually no criticism whatsoever.  There is certainly a place for this and there is a lot I would agree with in this, but the viewer should know that this is what they will get.  It is very moving, it is a beautiful family of devoted public servants, but there is nothing of the dark side that has become a cottage industry in itself, which any balanced treatment should at least address in some way, agree or refute.",1475107200,,670,4.61344537815126

5439361,5,B00AIZ2K78,"After all the criticism and bad press this woman has gotten since the assassination of RFK, I was delighted to see such a funny and poignant tribute by none other than Ethel and Bobby's last child, Rory. Ethel is-quite simply-a force of nature. Her life has been part fairy tale and part nightmare, but in typical Ethel style this documentary does not focus on the many tragedies. It's her life story in her own words and in the words of the people who know and love her best-her 9 surviving children. And what a story it is.. see it for the awesome home movies if nothing else. Bobby and Ethel sure knew how to whoop it up! It's amazing how much living they packed into the 17 years of their marriage.

 I am still hoping to read a good, reputable biography of Ethel Skakel Kennedy someday but for now this film will do just fine.

BRAVO Rory, for reclaiming your remarkable mother from the Jerry Oppenheimers of the world!",1443398400,,924,4.455621301775148

5439364,5,B00AIZ2K78,"PLOT: the Kennedy we barely knew.

2011~ Rory Kennedy is the youngest of 11 children of Bobby and Ethel Kennedy. Rory made this excellent documentary which is a look at the life and times of Ethel Kennedy. The daughter of a wealthy coal baron Ethel was outgoing and lively. She is now an elderly lady who has a good memory but the method used to help her 'recall' is to simply ask her questions. This bio is done with video, and interviewing several of her 11 children. Young Ethel is married and produces children just about every year. Ethel at times needs a verbal prompt but clearly is articulate for her age and tells of family life at Hickory Hill with animals kids and even a seal. The family thrived on chaos. The Kennedy children who describe her as a ""terrible cook"" but defined very devout catholic mother who was the rock of the family. Added fun is how the large family explores the White House in 1960 when President Kennedy was elected including sliding down the bannisters. This revealing look at matriarch Ethel is entertaining and revealing and gives us an inner look at the fascinating lives of Ethel and Bobby Kennedy.",1426636800,,1138,4.605911330049261

5439393,5,B00AIZ2K78,"The legacy of Ethel Kennedy has always been overshadowed by the mystique of Jacqueline Kennedy. I'm a big fan of Jackie, and yet Ethel's story is remarkable and unique and just as poignant. Do they make people like Ethel these days?  She is a class act, having been full of energy, sparkle and optimism, faced to endure countless tragic events in her life all the while adapting with style and grace to the new challenges those events brought.  We forget the many roads she's walked down, the things in her life she has witnessed and everything that she's accomplished, so it is important that this documentary about her has been made, and in such a loving way. We were robbed of so much when Ethel's husband, Robert, was killed; the United States missed out on the leadership of him as president but also did not get the opportunity to experience Ethel Kennedy as First Lady. I found this account of her life to be fascinating.",1418947200,,928,4.618181818181818

This is a very informative look at Ethel Kennedy's life in her own words and also her children's. We always hear all the stories about RFK, but too few about Ethel. She is a remarkable women and a wonderful mother and grandmother as this film portrays her. It is a must have!!!",1408752000,2,434,4.178571428571429

5439434,4,B00AIZ2K78,"I knew little about Ethel Kennedy prior to watching this documentary produced by her youngest daughter, Rory. I was surprised at how witty and charming Ethel was, with a dark, silly sense of humor that matched mine. While I did not really learn much that I did not already know, Ethel still gave me a good laugh at some parts.",1403308800,,326,4.45

5439479,5,B00AIZ2K78,"An excellent documentary by Rory Kennedy, that shows us a very different side of Ethel Kennedy.  Most of what I knew about Ethel was from her younger years when she and Bobby were having a family and the light was shining on the Kennedy Camelot.  I don't think it was widely known what her life after Bobby's death was like.  The film did a good job showing the strength of character that she had in raising eleven children as a widow and the political force she continued to be in mostly a quiet unsung way.  I appreciate this look at an elderly Ethel, still full of life and fun.",1391731200,3,581,4.302752293577981

5439518,2,B00AIZ2K78,"I thought this would be more about Ethel and her life, not just her perspective of the years with RFK. Instead, everything covered seemed to be a reaction to her husband and his life; everything covered focused on him. Where's her perspective, not just what she thought he thought? Where's the honest look at raising all those children alone, both when he was alive and after his assassination? The documentary begins with an interesting comparison of her and RFK's family backgrounds, but there are no interviews with her siblings or Skakel family members. The focus is on the Kennedy's completely. Even after RFK's tragic death, the rest of her entire life is summed up in the last fifteen minutes and focuses on how everything she did, she did to honor him.

Interesting if you want to see some cute, carefully curated Kennedy home movies and photos (they had a seal!), but if you were looking for something real and honest, look elsewhere.",1384732800,8,943,4.820987654320987

5439521,5,B00AIZ2K78,"As a long-time Kennedy buff, I was happy to hear that something was coming out about Ethel, someone in that family we don't hear about much. Especially excited that it was created by her daughter.  It was a unique glimpse at history and the events that shaped RFK's and Ethel's lives together. The rarely or never seen family videos and interviews with her other children made it even more unique. I came away liking and respecting Ethel more-a tough lady whom it would be interesting to know. The ending words from her really made an impact on me. Though I wasn't alive during those times, it still made me cry, knowing what we lost. So good I made the rest of my family watch it again with me.",1382918400,,695,4.4296875

5439523,5,B00AIZ2K78,"Sure, it's a bit of a white wash, but no one can reasonably expect that Rory would ask her mother about Bobby's vicious side, or his philandering, or any number of other topics that Ethel does not wish to address of emphasize. With that in mind, this is a fascinating and moving and beautifully made documentary about a really remarkable woman, and features not only interviews with Ethel herself, but also many of her 9 surviving children. Ethel's a unique person in our history, and well worth spending an hour and a half with. Highly recommended.",1376784000,3,549,4.729166666666667

This wonderful and insightful look into Ethel Kennedy is a tribute to the many tragedies this family has faced. I would recommend it to anyone who has an interest in the Kennedy family. It was well done as is always the case with HBO. Congratulations to Ethel Kennedy's daughter for putting so much time and effort into this documentary and most of all to get her mom to talk.,1367280000,,451,4.380952380952381
8552357,5,B00AIZ2K78,This is an awesome film. I have seen it so many times but I had to have my own copy. Got the DVD on Amazon two days ago. I've watched the DVD twice already. What an interesting person Ethel Kennedy is. The best parts for me are when they discuss her life after she lost her husband and had to raise eleven children. Some of it makes me sad but it is well worth watching this movie. There is a point where her daughter tries to give her credit for the job she has done raising them and for all of their accomplishments but she just won't allow herself to take any credit and gives her husband the credit. There's something really touching about that moment. You will not regret buying this DVD. Buy it!!!,1526515200,,703,4.214814814814815

8552362,5,B00AIZ2K78,"If you've seen Rory Kennedy's film ""Last days in Vietnam"", you know how good a documentary filmmaker she is.  ""Ethel"" is just as good.  So much has been written about Jacqueline Kennedy that Ethel Kennedy has been somewhat overlooked.  This film remedies that.  Included are great films from the family archives and the first extended interview with Ethel in many years.  I highly recommend this film.",1499990400,,401,5.015151515151516
