8072002,5,B000A1F77A,"GREAT MOVIE! THIS MOVIE AND ITS SEQUEL ARE AMAZING! GET THEM! High action, high drama, dark samurai movie here. Ninjas do just about anything to complete a mission and are given the darkest most unforgiving and unseemly tasks that no one else will touch. Three Ronin must be worse to catch and kill them. Can't believe this didn't become a very long running series of films. One of the better samurai action films I have seen in a long time. Gets gore filled with heads flying and blood spurting. The fights are really over the top awesome. The stories of each character are bleak, sad, and utterly devoid of any hope other than revenge.",1461369600,,637,4.5964912280701755
8072003,5,B000A1F77A,"DVD Review: Animego rules and this movie is out of print. Fruity!

Movie Review: Shadow Hunters is pretty much a straight forward Samurai Vs. Ninja movie. The story does not WOW me with its predictability but the story is works fine, the bloody action is fun and happy and the characters are neat. And that's that.

Conclusion: 5 stars for the DVD and 4 stars for Shadow Hunters.",1430006400,,379,4.5588235294117645
8072004,4,B000A1F77A,"While not being an exceptional film, it has its moments.  A deep story plot is balanced by fantastic fight scenes.",1372809600,,114,4.7
8072005,4,B000A1F77A,"Here's my take on this movie.  Overall, it was enjoyable film and I don't mind adding it to my collection of Japanese slasher films.  As others have mentioned the ending has a little to be desired without a really good story arc.  It's more of a half thrown change up pitch.  I was looking for more of a LONE WOLF and cub level of film, yet was disappointed with the amount of blood and gore.  The swordplay is decent and the acting isn't so bad.  This film is a little more lighthearted than Lone Wolf.. the storyline had a good concept, however the film leaves the viewer wanting to see a possible sequel to a complete ending.  The humor in the film is what keeps the film rolling. The story also has the viewer curious on what becomes of the ronin as another hook throughout the film.  Once again this is my opinion and had expectations for a Shogun Assassin type film... There is much to be desired.. I like this film enough but am disappointed..

And yes there is some cheezy 70's music.. I don't mind it to some extent as I am aware that these Japanese films were created in the early 70's.  The viewer will feel displaced, yet I found it somewhat humorous.  I would say this movie is good enough.

I've watched this movie again and am enjoying it on a more comical point of view.",1298678400,,1286,4.3125
8072006,5,B000A1F77A,This is good entertainment with the gift of hidden bits that require rewatching.  It has grit and comredy mixed well.,1231632000,,117,4.85
8072007,4,B000A1F77A,"This was a fun Samurai, ronin, slice 'em and dice 'em movie. The only drawback was the funky, early seventies music track. Several american and italian-made westerns had the same type of soundtrack in the seventies also. Other than that it was just fun to watch. A few of the characters and acting was a little bit off the mark. I also bought the sequel and it was marginally better.",1202947200,,383,4.485714285714286
8072008,1,B000A1F77A,"I could have gone without this movie. I guess I'm a traditionalist--Sanjuro, Chushingura, (Samurai) Rebellion, Hara-kiri, Sword of Doom--great movies; excellent sword work. But this stinker--poorly choreographed and a terrible 'jazz-like' musical score accompanies a transparent plot and lame ""acting"". Reminds me of the hack HK fist and sword melodramas. There's even the forlorn woman chasing the hero from beginning to end. Spare yourself.

This dog could have stayed on the shelf for another 30 years and no one would complain.",1179532800,4,531,5.555555555555555
8072009,3,B000A1F77A,"I guess I had higher hopes for this movie. I was a bit disapointed.  I watched it with english subtitles and the dialog or the jokes between the characters did not make sense sometimes.  I guess it makes sense in Japanese.  Overall, sometimes fun and ok movie.  But there are such movies that are much better.",1178496000,,309,4.464285714285714
8072010,5,B000A1F77A,"MAN!!! What A movie!! This ""Ninja vs. Samurai"" film IS SOOOO ACTION-PACKED and is HIGH QUALITY. The action scenes were very well choreoghraphied, there is blood and gore, cool fights between samurais and ninjas, COOL ninja tricks, beautiful cinematoghraphy, GREAT acting and not to mention it's interesting story,...I mean, three samurais wandering around the country killing enemies for money and wanted DEAD by an army of ninjas. COOOOL!!!!!

I remember the high quality action-packed fantasy anime called Ninja Scroll that have a similar concept witch is about a wanderer swordman that is also wanted DEAD by an army of ninjas. WELL!! The concept is similar but this movie is NOT fantasy and is about three wanderer swordmen fighting an army of ninjas.

P.S: Another cool stuf is that the director is a celebrity because he is the one that directed TORA!TORA!TORA! If you like COOL action-packed samurai movies directed by celebrities then I recommend Lone Wolf and Cub: Baby Cart to Hades and Zatoichi: Darkness is his Ally.

Adios.",1154908800,10,1036,5.118343195266272
8072011,5,B000A1F77A,"Just received part one of the 1972 Toho film SHADOW HUNTERS a film that I have been waiting a long time to see. Animeigo has done another terrific job with this one as part of their Samurai film series from Japan on DVD. Can you imagine three cold blooded killers being sent on a mission which is constantly interrupted by ninja, female assassins, and corrupt officials all desiring a deed these three are trying to deliver to Edo? Lots and lots of blood and violence before they ride off one final time into the sunset.  The hand to hand combat with scores of ninja is worth the price alone as they battle in some really terrific moves toward their objective.  Easy to read subtitles make this journey even more enjoyable.  And just think part two with even more action will be released soon. This thirty plus years wait has been well worth it!",1124928000,17,845,4.509803921568627
