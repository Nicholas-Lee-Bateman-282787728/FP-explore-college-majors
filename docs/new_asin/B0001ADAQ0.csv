1983311,4,B0001ADAQ0,"This is the video I ordered, but on the bottom during the whole video is a note that it is for promotional purposes only.  It gets in the way of the picture at times.  I would probably still have ordered it because it was a good price, but I would like to have known about the print at the bottom of the screen before I purchased it.
I was pleased with the condition of the item and it arrived on time.  I would order from this seller again.",1357171200,,441,3.9886363636363638
1983312,3,B0001ADAQ0,"This would have been better if when on continuous play the music played at the beginning of each episode - the song is very catchy and kids love it!
Without the music interrupting the episodes they become a bit boring",1182038400,,217,4.45
1983313,5,B0001ADAQ0,"My child loves this video, and I must admit that I tend to get caught up in it too. The characters, particularly the Mighty Finbar, are cute and entertaining. The material is witty for a childrens show, yet simply presented. Each of the episodes has a lesson about being nice to people or sharing or some such thing, but fortunatly the tone isn't preachy. This is a fun and creative show that I recommend.",1127347200,,405,4.486486486486487

8009047,1,B0001ADAQ0,My toddler was interested in the first 10 minutes then it was down hill. I also tried watching it and found it to be very slow.,1412294400,,127,3.923076923076923
8009048,5,B0001ADAQ0,"I wish they had more of these available on Prime...my son loves this cartoon and I love it because it helps him to use his imagination more when he takes a bath.  He is only three and began taking showers (assisted) a few months ago but since watching this show he only wants to take bubble baths.

Also, I had the DVD collection of this show when my oldest daughter was small and it broke (my daughter broke them when she was small) and I did not want to spend the money to purchase it again just for my son to have his turn to break them.  I was delighted to see this available on Prime.",1411084800,,589,4.060344827586207
