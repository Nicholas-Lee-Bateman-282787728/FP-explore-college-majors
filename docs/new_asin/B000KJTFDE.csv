2692594,4,B000KJTFDE,"I have been very pleased with this workout.  there are 5, 10 minute sections and each is a different type of routine so its very hard to get bored of any section!  Some days I will do a cardio routine and then just one 10 minute section afterwards, and on toning days i'll do 2 sections and other exercises!  You will see results, just remember complement the workouts with cardio and a balanced diet (sure I sound like a broken record but many people just look for a miracle cure and there just isn't one!)  I hope everyone enjoys this as much as I do!",1173312000,11,553,4.238095238095238
2692595,5,B000KJTFDE,"I am a fan of the 10 Minute Solutions series and was intrigued when I saw this one was coming out.  I was curious to see whether it would live up to its name and if it would keep my attention and not bore me with endless crunches.  I have tried it and can definately say without hesitation, this is another winner. Each of the 5 workouts has effective and creative moves that really work and are fun to do.  During each workout, I could feel the muscles working and could see a difference afterward.  The last two workouts are more traditional, incorporating crunches, but they do so in a way that is not monotonous.  The instructor is pleasant, but not annoying and she gives good modifications, if neccessary, along with direction as to how to do the exercises properly.  I really am glad that I have added this to my collection and would highly recommend it to anyone looking to tighten and tone their waistline!",1170547200,174,915,4.481927710843373
2692596,4,B000KJTFDE,"Over the years, I've come to like the 10 Minute Solution series.  This is quite a good one, but not my absolute favourite.

You will challenge your entire ab section in different ways.  Plank work for the transverse abs and Pilates for the core, combat aerobics to hit and burn the fat and then regular crunches and ab curls and a little more pilates.  I like having a dvd that concentrates mainly on abs because you can do these whenever you want - daily if you'd like.  If you've done your walk or aerobic work, it's great to put this on when you've got a little spare time and it's easy enough but you still feel good for it afterward.  The instructor Suzanne is good - her cuing is helpful and on the mark and it makes this easy to follow.  I think this would make a good addition to your other workout dvds.",1170460800,85,812,4.233766233766234

2692633,3,B000KJTFDE,"I have only done three of the five workouts, and while the exercises are good, the instructor is not.  First of all, she doesn't demonstrate the exercises before she does them.  Because of this, I recommend you watch the segment first so you will at least have some idea of what you'll be doing.  Second of all, I feel she goes way too fast on some of the moves.  Granted, she only has 10 minutes, but quality is more important than quantity and it's hard to keep proper form on some of the moves when you're speeding through them.  I am not a novice, I consider myself intermediate, so I feel like I know proper form.  However, I have had issues with my neck hurting after I finish some of the segments and I chalk it up to going too fast on some of the moves.  I wouldn't recommend this work out to a beginner except for maybe the Pilates segment since it's the easiest to do and follow.",1426204800,2,889,4.224852071005917

2692637,5,B000KJTFDE,"This is a great workout. I bought it postpartum after having used Bowen's Long & Lean workout throughout my pregnancy. After only a few weeks of admittedly inconsistent workouts, I can tell that my core is stronger and my belly is flattening out. I have done the entire 60 min workout and also just done 1 or 2 segments after running. I like the versatility. All of the 6 segments are different, which is nice. There is a bit of overlap with some of the exercises in her Tighten, Tone and Torch video, but not much so I'm glad I have both DVDs. And anyway, the exercises that overlap are good to do multiple times per week. There are modifications for beginners and advanced participants. I think the only ""extra"" thing you need for any of the workouts is a rolled up towel to put between your knees during a couple of the exercises. I am having a lot of fun with these workouts and am happy I bought the DVD. I will keep buying her workouts.",1424044800,,942,4.327683615819209

You think crunches when you think abs workout and who wants that?  So I avoid them . I decided to take a chance and when I saw home girl on a mat in the previews, it came right out the DVDplayer. But its necessary.  If you think you'll get flat abs wo a crunch of some sort, you're wrong.. its that simple.  I sucked it up and gave it a chance. .I enjoyed it!!! Its ten minutes. If you can't stick it.out for ten minutes.  Start saving for liposuction!  And its variety. Not all mat on the floor. It can be done.  Just do it.

2692672,4,B000KJTFDE,"In the first weeks of using this, I would have given it 5 stars, but now having used it regularly for nearly a year, I would say 3.5/4 is more accurate. This is why I think so...
First, the cons:
-Really my major issue is the amount of talking the instructor does. That sounds odd, but she provides unnecessarily lengthy instructions and commentary, halting the workout while she's doing it. Initially lots of instruction may be useful if you're a beginner, but after a few uses, you find the pauses irritating; you can do at least 3 extra reps while she's talking--it doesn't sound like much but for a 10-minute video, keeping your muscles engaged is important for a good workout...
-After several uses, you may find two breaks too many for a 10-minute workout; I did.

Now the pros:
-Despite the instructor's excessive talking, they are decent workouts. As you become more advanced you can do several segments, or all, and they're all mostly different.
-The length (probably the biggest pro) makes it easy to fit exercise into any schedule, and you can break them up into several sessions while still feeling that you're completing full workouts.

I would recommend this with these caveats: Beginners and intermediate exercisers will most likely find this a good and generally challenging workout. Advanced ab exercisers may become frustrated by unnecessary pauses, and may want to do at least two segments to challenge themselves.  I am an intermediate/advanced exerciser and have found two segments in a row challenging, but not what I would call easy... Bottom line, I think the majority of exercisers will find this a very good workout (I do), you can do reps through talking, and eventually if doing all segments no longer challenge you, you can simply graduate to an extremely challenging ab workout.",1384387200,5,1808,4.921311475409836
2692673,5,B000KJTFDE,"This is an effective workout routine (routines plural, actually) that adapts to even the busiest schedules. If you can only fit 10 minutes of exercise into your day, you can easily do that with this series of workouts. .That is because this 60 minute routine is broken up into 10 minute segments that you can choose individually from the menu -you can choose as many or as few 10 minute segments as you like  in any sequence that you desire.  Though the emphasis in on working the core muscles, it is possible to get a full body workout using this DVD by choosing the right segments for you routine.

2692680,5,B000KJTFDE,I needed to have them! Netflix cut us all off and didn't provide an alternative for any exercise or work out videos. This is perfect. I don't mind buying these because I can access them offline. SO I'm happy.,1374796800,,208,4.358974358974359

2692682,5,B000KJTFDE,"So...I bought this DVD workout three years ago, and when I popped it in for the first time, I said, ""forget this!"" and turned it off. I was way overweight back then, and not ready for this kind of workout. I'll admit, this is not one for beginners. The moves throughout all five segments are somewhat challenging. That's not to say that this workout is EXTREMELY challenging, but if you haven't worked out for years and years like I hadn't, I would start with something simpler.

That said, after losing a good deal of weight through standard gym workouts (elliptical, treadmill, etc.), I tried this DVD again, and being able to do the moves, it's a completely different experience. I love this DVD.

I love the 10 Minute Solution DVDs because I can mix them all up for a 50 minute workout. For example, I also have the Dance 10 Minute Solution DVD, and I do 2 or 3 of those segments with 2 or 3 of the segments from this DVD. With this one, I usually only do my favorites: Flat Belly Fast, Abs Ripper, and Belly Flat Blaster. That's not to say the other two segments are bad, but I'm not a fan of standard crunches (Six Pack Abs), and the Pilates Perfect Abs strains my neck (not a fault of the instructor, I know if you're holding the pose correctly your neck shouldn't hurt, I'm just not good at it).

Belly Flat Blaster is really the best segment here I think. It's low impact, but it's a work out. By the time I'm done, my heart is pumping and I'm sweaty. Squats will do that to you. Abs Ripper and Flat Belly Fast are very similar, with planks and side planks and some pilates mixed in.

The instructor is motivating but not overly so like some instructors can be. Basically, this is now a regular feature in my daily workouts, and if you're above a complete beginner level, I'd recommend trying it out.",1373587200,6,1809,4.375
2692683,5,B000KJTFDE,It is a fast action and fast paced video. Not for just starting off and takes a bit to get routine down,1373328000,,103,3.727272727272727

She is a very good indtructor, I can always squeeze in 10-20 mins per work out. The first time I popped in the DVD I couldn't do half the trick, I thought I wasn't going to attempt this workout again. The following 2 days I was sore all over, mostly the the stomach muscles. I kept working out and it's now been a week and all the pain is gone and I can lift parts of my body I couldn't lift the first day. The only one I can't do (YET) is the Palates.

Now I'm not a exercise buff (I've never joined a gym in my life), and I found this DVD not challenging enough, but decide to incorporate it as part of my rotation.  After doing it for a while, however, I noticed my mid-drift getting firmer and my love handles not as noticeable.  As the title suggests, this DVD concentrates on your belly.  There are a lot of sit-ups and oblique exercise here.  If you find the routine too fast or difficult, break it down and concentrate on just ONE 10 minute routine.  Once you are comfortable with that one, move to the next.  Eventually you'll be able to do all five.  Since I love to eat, I guess I will be using this DVD for years to come!",1358294400,5,947,4.2

The first is Flat belly fast, the second is Pilates perfect abs, the third is Belly fat blaster, the fourth is Ab ripper, and the last one is Six pack abs. Flat belly fast is a great segment to use as a warm-up. The exercises in this segment are definitely the easiest. The Pilates segment uses very traditional Pilates exercises to tone and tighten your abs, not really anything new here, but all very effective. The Belly fat blaster is a cardio segment to help you burn calories and fat, the moves were pretty inventive and different and it really gets your heart rate up in a short amount of time, which is great. The Ab ripper segment combines all of the other segments into one, so there will be some repetitive moves in this segment from the other segments, but with some new twists. My favorite segment is the Six pack abs segment- it is KILLER! The whole ten minutes you are constantly tightening your abs, it is relentless and you seriously feel the burn, you know for a fact you are getting the most out of your ten minutes! I really like this video because it's not just the usual crunches (although there are those in this video too), but the instructor, Suzanne Bowen, uses some really inventive exercises to give you the most bang for your buck.

If you are comfortable doing the Biggest Loser DVD's or Gilad DVD's & are looking as I was for a good ab workout and are not able to hold yourself up on your side with 1 leg and 1 arm for floor work this DVD is NOT for you. Also if you cannot do leg jump out & in moves with both legs with only arm support on the the floor this is NOT for you.

I was looking for a good ab workout. I'm going back to Gilad Express Workout DVD and do the Core workouts. I think I am going to return this DVD & get Gilad's Core & More DVD. You still get a good ab workout but it is done in moves that the beginner/average person can actually do.

Don't get me wrong, I'm sure it's great for folk that have been in the gym a minimum of 5 days a week for a year or more and are close to their healthy weight. But for folks with many pounds to lose - you will likely not be able to do the moves on this DVD.",1309046400,90,1034,3.7777777777777777

The workouts were challenging enough for someone who is accustomed to short workouts, but easy enough for someone who is just beginning a regimen. It all depends on the segment(s) you pick when building your workout.

Suzanne is upbeat throughout and gives decent instruction, though on some of the more difficult exercises I would have liked more time to adjust myself and find the sweet spot.

I love that they give your different workout styles to choose from. The cardio sequences get your heart going and work your abs at the same time, plus are great for mixing things up when you're tired of traditional crunches. The Abs Ripper segment lives up to its name, and the others are a great variety.",1298851200,4,806,4.6223776223776225
2692738,5,B000KJTFDE,"I normally don't take the time to review products however I feel compelled to rave about this DVD because I use it a lot and really see results. I own three of Suzanne Bowen's 10 Minute Solution DVDs; they are all great but this is by far my favourite and the one that gave me the fastest visible results. After a year of doing these exercises the Ab Ripper segment still wears me out. I also love the Belly Fat Blaster segment because 1) it gives you a break from very focused ab work and 2) it is a great thigh workout (I also quickly saw visible results in my legs from this one). And the side crunches, they really work.",1296864000,5,624,4.1652892561983474

2692741,3,B000KJTFDE,"I have done this video a few times and I do not get very motivated to keep it in my routine. It does have moves that seem very effective but a lot of others that I still don't feel are targeting my ab muscles very well.  Maybe a better explanation or alternative way to work the targeted muscle would have been helpful.  One that comes to mind is when she asks to use a towel to hold between your legs.  I have tried varying the towel sizes, concentrating on the muscle area she says it is trying to work, squeezing harder ... ehhh still not getting it down. I like the standing workouts best in the DVD.  Although, you would need to do them for at least 20 min to get a maximum cardio benefit.  SO... I will do those 2 times.

Basically...

I DON'T use this as my primary workout DVD go-to.  Just an addition to my cardio and toning routine.
It is NOT motivating at all IMO.
Some moves just plain suck and some are OK.
Some of the ab sequences are performed too quickly together and I have trouble maintaining a burn in my abs because they are already tired from the previous similar move.  It took some time to improve my performance.",1293926400,7,1136,4.222222222222222

Overall, I think the negative outweighed the positive for me but I would recommend this to beginning exercisers.

pros:  Worked up a mild sweat with chapter 4 which was tough.

cons: The rest of the routines were just a little too easy for me.  The standing routine didn't even make me break a sweat.  Overall, though, I am guessing these would be great low impact routines for beginners.  The deciding factor that made me not want to keep this video was the constant, closeup stomach shots of the instructor --- I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and say it was to make you focus on squeezing your own ab muscles but instead I just found it really annoying.",1287100800,3,718,4.51937984496124

And pants that I thought I didn't like (because they were uncomfortable)-- I loved wearing! (These tended to be the more fashionable pants too I noticed) Sooo.. that told me more then anything that this video was on it. Note: I was pretty thin to start with (and I was taking karate regularly to boot)-- BUT, the 2 years of karate wasn't doing nothing on the tummy---I still had it. AND to me, a tummy stands out even MORE on a person who is  basically thin!  i used the first 10 min which I liked the best--FLAT BELLY FAST

My only problem is they are fairly advanced.

I had completed three months of physio which included 20 sit ups a day for three months, and even that didn't prepare me for this video.

I was able to do only about 10 percent of the moves in this video (sitting out or ""jogging out"" the rest of this).  If I had tried to complete more, I was afraid I'd get a hernia or something.

However, if I go at it real slow, maybe after a little while I can do 20 percent of the workout.  Probably after 6 months of three times a week, I could probably do about 80 percent of each video without worrying about blowing out something in my midsection.

So if your a fitness instructor you could probably join right in, but if your the average joe or jane blow, these workouts are waaaay tooo advanced.",1283904000,,816,4.225806451612903

2692764,4,B000KJTFDE,"I purchased this video a few months ago when I started my new exercise regimen (meaning, I haven't done any meaning physical activity since high school, which was quite a while ago).  I really, really like it.  It's great for beginners, and I would dare say intermediate exercisers as well.

The instructor is EXCELLENT in cueing, explaining the moves so you get them the first time, and it's very easy to just pop it in and go with it.  A lot of videos aren't, and this was VERY important for me because I get frustrated easily if the moves are too difficult, meaning I give up.  Which is why I haven't been exercising.  :o)

Pros:  the 10-minute format is great for those of you who lose steam not knowing how much time is left in the workout.  Also, the programmable format to mix and match the workouts you want is awesome.  I have three sections I like to do together for days when I just want an ab workout, and I feel I got a solid workout in.

Cons:  the 10-minute format. If you do JUST one segment, you're not going to see results quickly because you're not going to get the calorie burn.  But, I find I'll jog outside, then come in and do one of these 10-minute sections to hit my abs, and my daily workout is complete.

My favorite section is Six Pack Abs.  The others I usually do are Belly Fat Blaster and Flat Belly Fast.  The Abs Ripper seems too much for me right now, and I am not a pilates fan, so I haven't yet tried the Pilates Perfect Ab segment yet.

Day #1 ""Flat Belly Fast"" - series of planks (modified push up position) and other movements to suck in your stomach

Day #2 ""Pilates Perfect"" - series of pilates moves including the ""100"", leg lifts, etc.

Day #3 ""Belly Fat Blaster"" - a kickboxing segment with abdominal work in the standing position, really gets your heart pumping so has a great touch of cardio in addition to toning

Day #4 ""Six-Pack Abs"" - classic crunches for obliques, upper & lower abs

Day #5 ""Ab Ripper"" - a combination of exercises from the other days to give you a little bit of everything on your final day

I was excited to try this DVD out as I thought that I could squeeze 10 minute workouts into my schedule at any time, but I was a bit disappointed.  I am a beginner as far as conditioning goes (out of shape), but I did not feel that burn/slight soreness in my abs after doing this workout.  I also felt that Day #1 and some of the exercises on other days were too advanced for me.  I was struggling to keep the plank pose for the entire time and could not concentrate on my abs.  I would have loved it if the instructor offered some variations for beginners so that I could complete these exercises more effectively.

The DVD is easy to do in a small space as you don't move around too much.  There is no special equipment required other than a light set of hand weights and a piece of flooring.  The instructor gives decent cuing and seems pretty upbeat.  Her abs were not perfectly flat (as I have come to expect from most other instructors teaching abs moves) so I am not sure if I really want her results.  The music was the regular, boring background noise.  The warm-ups & cool-downs were short, of course, but they were also pretty good.  This DVD didn't really do it for me, but I can see from the reviews here that a lot of other people really liked it so perhaps I am just too picky, but I was not a big fan.

2692787,4,B000KJTFDE,"I hate to say this about Suzanne... while I feel this is a great variety of ab workouts, I wish I were seeing more results.  I feel it burning at the time, but I, unfortunately, am not sore the next day or seeing huge results.  I have sort of reached a plateau after taking off 2 or 3 pounds.  Maybe because I only weigh about 115 to begin with.  I am aiming to create that sexy, flat, defined mid-section.  I've been keeping up with this series and can see some difference, but nothing drastic.  Flat belly fast is my favorite workout because it's crunchless, but it's also very hard on your shoulders because you are in plank or modified plank positions a lot of the time.  If you have a generally weak upper body, you will have a hard time with this.  Pilates perfect abs is the predictable, classic pilates moves, which if executed properly does help.  Six Pack Abs is TOUGH.  It took me months to be able to actually get through this segment without collapsing.  I guess I'm improving!  The vast majority of this is crunch style, which I don't like because it tends to place strain on your neck no matter how much they say it doesn't.  Belly Fat Blast is a standing cardio segment.  It's good to get your heart rate up and zone in on your abdonminals.  This segment is also hard on your lower body because there is a lot of squatting involved.  Be prepared for that.  And finally, Abs Ripper is pretty good.  It too is very challenging, and combines lots of different exercises.  I think it would be hard to do all 5 in a row, but I like to do two or so at the beginning or end of another workout.  If you really want a challenge for your abs and to feel the burn the next day, try Billy Blank's Ab bootcamp or his Rock Solid Abs.",1236556800,3,1735,4.247706422018348

You can do just one or you can arrange the segments into any order to create a customized workout. Second, the exercizes are challenging and can be modified from beginer to advanced. Next, the instructor is pleasant without being annoying. There's only 1 person to watch, not a bunch of others in the background.

After doing the whole 50 minutes of Blast Off Belly Fat, I realized that this workout wonderfully combines exercises that not only flatten your belly but tone your whole body. If I knew how big the difference is between exercising on your own and doing that with an instructor who shows you how to properly breathe, do the workout so you can really feel it and obtain the results fast, I wouldn't be wasting my time exercising alone. This DVD is a great workout that not only helps you get rid of the fat but leaves you feel refreshed and energized. I love it!",1234656000,3,748,4.467153284671533

2692799,5,B000KJTFDE,"Several of my fitness magazines recently featured articles about how a recent study has shown that certain pilates-based exercises (like the One Hundred, Plank, Side Plank, and Roll Ups) are better for deeply working the abdominal muscles than exercises like the standard crunch.  I already own many abs workouts, but none of mine feature those exercises, so I purchased this workout about two weeks ago since this DVD includes all of the exercises that the study mentioned.  So far, it's great!

Suzanne Bowen's personality is cheerful and pleasant, and she gives excellent form pointers during each workout.  Several other reviews explain each of the five sections of this DVD in more detail, so I will just say that she makes each workout challenging and effective -- you will definitely feel the burn if you concentrate on proper form during the ten minutes!  Suzanne is also very good at showing modifications for beginning, intermediate, and advanced exercisers.

Since the five segments are so short (about ten minutes each), they are easy to tack onto the end of another workout.  I've been doing one of the sections three times a week, and I'm already noticing good results.

I have many workouts that I don't do since the instructor is boring or rubs me the wrong way, but Suzanne is great and I love her personality.  I'm definitely going to look for other workouts from her!",1226534400,6,1386,4.914163090128755

She gives you a moderate/advanced pose, then tells you how to modify it to a beginner's pose. You don't need a whole bunch of equipment- just you, workout clothes, socks, shoes, a towel for the first section, and the video! No bands, no balls, no blocks. Just you and the video! I hate having to buy all of this special equipment the video says you just HAVE TO have. This one is amazing, and it burns your abs (in a good way)!

I like the way the DVD is formatted ... you can pick your 10 minute segments depending on how much time you have or if you want to incorporate abs into your workout that day with other muscle groups or cardio without having to go through a 30-50 minute DVD.

The instructor cues well and paces the routine so that you get the most out of your 10 minutes. There are some new ab moves here that are excellent for ""shocking"" your muscles. If you are like me and have been working out for many years, you know how important variety is for maintaining definition, especially as we age.

At first, some of the exercises took a couple of tries to get used to, but usually after my third go at it, I was able to perform the moves without difficulty. There are five- ten minute exercises, all of which are unique in their own way.  You have the option of choosing how many you want to do and which ones. I love how you can mix it up! I think it is one of the reasons I love this dvd so much, because it doesn't get boring...you can change it up and make it different each time. Oh, and you can really feel the exercises working! I have used this dvd for only five days, and already I can see some tiny changes taking place, which gives me the motivation to keep it up! I especially love the flat belly fast segment, which trains your stomach muscles to lay flat. Also, the instructor has a pleasant voice, doesn't spend tons of time on talking about the moves, and frequently reminds you when to breathe, which is so important!  I would recommend it to anyone! Just don't get discouraged if some of the exercises seem too difficult or impossible at first. After a while, you will be able to do them and love them!",1213401600,8,1197,4.177489177489178

However, I had a baby by c-section 7 months ago and I needed a video that would focus on strengthening my core and four layers of abs since The Firm workouts do not include thorough ab workouts, in my opinion.  So I picked this up and decided to give it a try, especially when I saw it had a segment called ""Flat Belly Fast"" which trains your abs to lay flat and I really need that after a C-section.  I was so impressed with the workout, very challenging, it made me feel I had never worked out my abs before.  The very next day my obliques were so sore and I could notice a visible change in my abs, they were lying flatter already after only one workout, I could not believe it was possible. Most ab workouts focus on the rectus abdominis (the six-pack) muscle and not enough on the obliques and transversus abdominis, which is actually the innermost ab muscle that allows your abs to lie flat (which is what we women want).  Especially after a C-section, strengthening the innermost ab muscles is very important since I found that they got very weak after the surgery.  This video is perfect for strenghtening your ab muscles from the inside out, which is the correct way to do it.  Very effective, highly recommend.",1198886400,76,1354,4.435483870967742

I also like that each workout is a mini workout with both a warm up and cool down.  I am just beginning to get into exercising regularly and like that I can take a break between workouts.  In fact after writing this review I am going to do the last 10 minute workout for the day.  Specifically for this abs workout video I like that there are a lot of different exercises that you don't see all the time.  For the two that I've already done ""Flat Belly Fast"" and ""Belly Fat Blaster"" there were no crunches at all and ""belly fat blaster"" had a lot of standing ab exercises.

I generally have an easier time working my abs than anything else (which you'd never guess by looking at me) so maybe that's why this seemed a little lackluster at times. There are moments (I have done all 5 routines each time I've played it) when you do definitely feel the burn, and maybe it's doing more at other times than I realize. The bicycle crunches are the hardest - killers in any routine, and she does about a zillion of them, I think. In some routines though I found I couldn't quite pull off the moves, like where you lay on your side & lift yourself off the floor. I'm not sure exactly what that's really doing for my abs, since it seemed to be hurting my shoulders & legs a lot more than anything & I couldn't hardly stay balanced long enough to do the side crunches from there, but... She's likeable enough I go along with it.

2692866,5,B000KJTFDE,"I used to have the 8 minutes abs etc. type of tapes. This one is just the best out of all of them. Easy to follow, great choices. Just love it !!!",1185840000,5,146,3.59375
2692867,5,B000KJTFDE,I love this new ab DVD. The 5 10-minute work-outs gives me a week worth's a challenging ab exercises. I'm typically not a big fan of work-out dvds because I never find them challenging enough and they seem repetitous. This DVD is none of that...I noticed increased tone in my abs in just a week and love the variety. Great product!!!,1184457600,9,333,4.475409836065574
2692868,5,B000KJTFDE,"I love this DVD.  The workouts are quick and effective. Suzanne Bowen is a great instructor, she gives enough instruction to get you going but doesn't bore you to death with constant chatter.  The exercises are really great too. My stomach muscels are sore and I feel like  I'm accomplishing something without having to dedicate a lot of time to it. This is a great DVD for people who work and are too busy to stick to a routine that takes very long.",1182902400,6,450,4.397590361445783
2692869,5,B000KJTFDE,This is a well-paced set of short routines that work well together or after some cardio exercise.  When I first started using this tape I had trouble doing some of the more challenging exercises.  After using it for a few weeks I am finding that I'm able to complete all the routines.  Suzanne hits just the right note of encouragement too.  This one is a keeper!,1182729600,5,363,4.454545454545454
2692870,5,B000KJTFDE,"I had another abs DVD ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Perfect-Abs/dp/B000B5XPFG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Perfect Abs</a>"" that I was getting a little bored with, so I picked this one up for variety in my routines. It was a good choice. There are various routines, all of which I find challenging, especially when strung together. You can pick and choose several of the routines and get a very tiring and satisfactory workout done in about 25 minutes. The toughest of the five routines (for me) is the Pilates series, which emphasizes precise control. This product is an excellent value.",1181779200,39,627,5.826086956521739
2692871,5,B000KJTFDE,"I LOVE this workout!!!!!!  It's challenging and fun at the same time!  I love the 10 minute segments.  You can do the whole workout, or create your own workout!  I have already recommended it to a few friends.  It's definitely one of my favorites.",1181433600,2,247,4.5227272727272725
2692872,5,B000KJTFDE,"Finally, I have found a video that I can stick with.  The instructor is pleasant and encouraging without seeming like an exercize nazi.  You can switch the order of the 10 minute segments and do as little or as much as you can.  I usually do three segments at a time.  And I can see results.  I even look forward to exercizing, now, which never happened before.",1180828800,28,361,4.3283582089552235
2692873,5,B000KJTFDE,"I picked up this dvd wanting to trim down my middle but wondering if this would actually do anything.  I own too many dvds where I think to myself, ""Did the instructor REALLY get that body doing this workout? I know I'm not!""  That is simply not the case with this DVD.  The instructor is working just as hard as I am and I really feel it the next day.  Even though there are only so many abs moves out there, the workouts are never boring.  Suzanne is pleasant without being annoying and I love that she is liberal with the stretches. Between every hard move she gives you time to stretch and breathe, while still keeping the workout hard enough that you actually accomplish something.

Kudos to a dvd worth buying and using!",1180137600,8,726,4.380597014925373
2692874,5,B000KJTFDE,"Terrific work out! Not easy but, that's the point. One can work out for 10 or for 50 minutes and fit it into a busy schedule. Excellent!",1178409600,3,136,4.074074074074074
2692875,5,B000KJTFDE,"I love this DVD it hits my abs from a totally different way than convention exercises, and it is fun!!!",1173657600,3,103,4.2
8157602,5,B000KJTFDE,"For those who don't have time to drive across town to the gym and spend an hour in an abs class, this is for you.

PROS:
1) VARIETY: Five workouts, each very different. You're not going to get bored. (Well, maybe after you've done all five of them over and over for as many years as I have, the novelty will wear off.... But not before.)
2) EFFICIENT: 10 minutes each. You're not going to get a rock-solid six-pack in a week (if there's some DVD that will do that for you, please let me know), but you will get in a decent core workout in a time frame that's manageable in even the busiest schedule.
3) SAFE: Suzanne Bower knows her stuff and promotes proper form so you're not doing stupid stuff that leads to injury.
4) INEXPENSIVE: At 10 bucks for a DVD you can use over & over--that beats any deal you'll get on even a single class at a gym.
5) HEALTHY LONGEVITY: The core muscles are one of the most important factors in staying healthy as we age. I've been getting senior discounts for awhile now, and a strong core continues to serve me well.",1522713600,,1049,4.245
