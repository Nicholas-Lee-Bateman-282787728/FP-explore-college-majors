As another reviewer wrote, ""Days of the Ram, Then and Now-DVD"" repeats much information from ""Ramtha, The White Book""; however, I consider that a positive as it simply reinforces Ramtha's amazing teachings.

I rate this video five (5) stars and enthusiastically recommend it to everyone because I love it, love it, love it and cannot get enough of it!!!

8131401,5,B000GFKFTA,"i stayed up until 3 am last night watching this dvd. i was completely encaptivated with ramtha and the way that he spoke about humanity - the diety of us all. in those few hours i felt a shift within me that is so subtle yet so core that my perspective on life and myself and my problems has a new outlook today, with ease. just be.",1165190400,11,332,3.970149253731343
