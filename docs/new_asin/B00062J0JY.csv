A lot of action and good stunt work is featured.",1519689600,,252,5.170731707317073
8037624,5,B00062J0JY,"a wonderful trip down memory to Saturday morning pictures
with heroes villains and adventure linda stirling is of course
fabulous as the tiger woman and just that little bit more scary
than Phyllis coates as ""panther girl of the congo""and frances
Gifford as ""jungle girl"" (both great tho') but the one thing I
would say is that the picture quality could have been a little
clearer nonetheless great fun and I would not miss it for
anything.",1465084800,,440,4.7272727272727275
8037625,5,B00062J0JY,"Video quality is just okay, but then that is what it was in the theaters when we watched them on Saturday mornings over sixty years ago, they were old then.  Brings back great memories.",1430524800,,185,4.4411764705882355
8037626,5,B00062J0JY,"I enjoyed the movie thoroughly.  The Tiger Woman is a heiress to a fortune left to her by her father that was killed in a plane crash.
She is also the leader of a jungle tribe.  The plot involves an oil company that has rights to drill on the tribe lands, but the villains want to seize the oil rights for themselves.  Also, they want to prove that the Tiger Woman is heir to her father's fortune, capture, and kill her, so they can substitute an imposter to claim the millions for themselves.  Linda Stirling, a former model turned actress, plays the Tiger Woman as both the heroine--she fights and shoots like a man in the serial, but is also the damsel in distress. Inspired by Tarzan, the serial is heavy on cliffhangers (cliffhangers inspired George Lucas in Star Wars, and Steven Speilberg in Indiana Jones).",1365811200,,814,4.554794520547945
8037627,5,B00062J0JY,This is excellent. i have been a fan of the movie seriels for a long time now and am becoming a Linda Stirling fan. I can definatly tell why they called her the queen of the Seriels...,1195344000,,184,4.0
8037628,4,B00062J0JY,"Former model Linda Stirling brought statuesque beauty and poise to the role of ""Tiger Woman."" She could appear wooden at times in her skimpy costume, yet when action was required (as it frequently was in this serial) Stirling delivered the goods. Generally considered the queen of movie serials, Stirling also appeared in her share of westerns.

TIGER WOMAN trivia:

The TIGER WOMAN wore a leopard-spotted outfit because the studio couldn't find any tiger patterned fabric.

The runaway mine car scene was the inspiration for the same sequence in ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.""

Allan 'Rocky' Lane was a cowboy movie star in the 1940s. Ironically, he would one day portray the voice of a talking horse on TV. Lane's last major role was that of MR. ED.

Tom Steele, who doubled for Lane and played one of the thugs in TIGER WOMAN, did stunt work in over 250 serials and movies, including ""The Blues Brothers,"" ""Flash Gordon,"" ""Diamonds are Forever,"" ""Gunga Din,"" ""Blazing Saddles,"" ""Buck Rogers,"" ""The Towering Inferno,"" ""Mighty Joe Young"" and ""The Poseidon Adventure.""

Duncan Renaldo was also a western star, but on early television. In 1949 THE CISCO KID was one of the first TV programs filmed in color, although it was never broadcast that way until decades after the program's demise.

8037629,3,B00062J0JY,I was pleased with the visual print but the dialogue went a bit quiet twice for just a moment and if this is the type of serial you like then buy it. Allan  Lane is brilliant as always. but the alternative title is misleading it is hardly in the darkest jungle.,1156291200,,261,4.117647058823529
