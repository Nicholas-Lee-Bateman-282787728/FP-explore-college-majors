8620405,2,B00G3IDRNA,"I've worked out of the AFS book for many years, and was concerned -due to my weak reading abilities- if I was reading/interpreting correctly. I wanted the DVD to reconfirm or instruct me correctly for ALL of the exercises. Was very disappointed that only two, maybe three exercises per topic were demonstrated; where each topic has anywhere from ten (10) to thirty-four (34) exercises. And of course the ones I had concern on were not shown. Instead Rick decided to spend a lot of the DVD showing him playing live with a funk band, I guess he was using some of the topics taught in the book, but who knows. Don't get me wrong, the band sounded great and Rick's chops and abilities are great! But that's not why I bought the DVD. If Rick did not spend the amount of time with his band or did not show exercises with a Samba beat on the kick drum, he could have shown us all of the exercises as written in the book!! Really, this DVD misrepresents itself...",1427068800,,955,4.401129943502825
