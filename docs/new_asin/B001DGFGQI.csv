The title is slightly misleading as it is not all about Wilson's involvment with Manson.  That's just a part of it.  And warning, that part contains explicit material if anyone cares to know.  I know Brian Wilson is the brains behind the Beach Boys, but this documentary was predominantly about Brian.  This should have been titled:  ""Brian Wilson and the Satan (featuring the rest of them)"".
I've seen other Beach Boys documentaries (even made for tv movies) that were better than this jumpy compilation.  I felt like I was trying to watch a documentary put together by someone who had ADD.",1249257600,,674,4.661016949152542
3529266,4,B001DGFGQI,"overall, the documentary was pretty cool. however, about 99% of the beach boys clips were from a prior documentary, an american family from '85. they should have included the clip of dennis singing manson's song never learnt not to love (aka cease to exist). especially since the title of the movie is the beach boys & the satan. but did have cool footage of interviews with dick dale and dean torrence and the chantays. also kim fowley was cool too.",1235692800,,450,4.6375
3529267,3,B001DGFGQI,"We all know of Dennis' direct and mostly indirect involvement with Manson. Why Dreher had to tarnish the name of the documentary is beyond me. The Beach Boys deserve better...especially Brian. Rare, new footage is always good.",1226534400,3,226,5.135135135135135
3529268,5,B001DGFGQI,a totally off  and enjoyable movie. All Brian Wilson fans should see this movie.,1225584000,,80,4.714285714285714
3529269,5,B001DGFGQI,"This is one dvd that any beach boys fan should have in their dvd collection. And if you ever wonder how such an clean cut band got ever involed in the likes of Charles Manson again this the dvd for you or if you like the beach boys music again get this dvd cause it everything that you want to know. So buy your copy now and enjoy.

3529270,3,B001DGFGQI,"I have no idea why the director, German Christoph Dreher, decided to give this 57 minute documentary this title - or why the video company chose the packaging., but this is a hidden gem of a documentary on Brian Wilson and his music and a must for Wilson fans.

The film was made in 1997 - and so references to the ""Smile"" album never being released are a bit premature. All the titles and on screen descriptions are in GERMAN, but all the sound (interviews, songs etc) are in ENGLISH.

Starting out with the history of surf music, the film includes rare interviews with the Chantays, Don Was, and Dick Dale. Lots of rare promo films made by Capitol for the Beach Boys are also here.  The film focuses on Brian Wilson's early years as well as his drug problem for about 45 minutes. About 2/3 through we get to the Psychedelic Years of music and see Janis Joplin perform at Monterey Pop Fest. Then an odd connection is made between Dennis Wilson being friends with Charles Manson and the film veers off to discuss the Manson murders. Then it's back to Brian, who has nothing at all to do with Manson.

Some of the real highlights are newly filmed (well, new in 1997) interviews with Brian at his home at the piano (where he plays ""Love and Mercy"").

A big problem with this release is that it is not ""indexed"" and it is ONE long 57-minute chapter, so you can't go back to a specific song or subject.

Again, this is a quirky - misleadingly packaged - DVD that all Beach Boy and Brian Wilson fans will want to check out. And the video quality is very good.

3529271,3,B001DGFGQI,"Not very much content related to the Beach Boys connection to Charles Manson, but that wasn't a long chapter in their story anyway. Not much new here for Beach Boys fans, except some good interview footage of Brian Wilson. Very low production quality otherwise I'd give it 4 stars.",1461542400,,281,4.755102040816326
3529272,1,B001DGFGQI,"All the footage of other performers doesn't belong in a film which is supposedly about the Beach Boys. The same is true of the over abundance of counterculture clips. The Beach Boys had little involvement in that scene. The pseudo psychoanalyst was the greatest absurdity with putting a Freudian spin on the fact that Briansupposedly hated the beach. Not true. I've heard Brian say he can't surf and doesn't want to surf but loves the beach.

The same clips of the Beach Boys performing, as well as Brian's interview at the piano, are the same found in the other Beach Boys documentaries found here on Amazon. Still, it was fun seeing some of them again. My favorite is Brian taking part in a parody of himself with Ackroyd and Belushi. Three of the best in show business!

The producer with dreadlocks gave interesting and intelligent commentary on his relationship with Brian. How refreshing in a film so much irrelevant material.",1459814400,,932,4.81875

This is a whacked out documentary made by whacked out people. It's taken a little Manson footage and footage from different BB/BW movies. There is an interview with BW on there that I did not see before. If you must see that do yourself a favor and try to youtube it. This is garbage.",1441843200,,406,4.217948717948718

3529280,3,B001DGFGQI,I was surprised I seen a lot if not all of the documentaries concerning the Manson murders and I've read the book helter-skelter and others. Surprised that there were some extra footage in there that I haven't seen of the Manson family. Don't know where they got this and why any one else hasn't found it in the last 46 years. There's a good focus on Brian Wilson and What he went through with his depression and how he was the key to the success of the beach boys.,1437264000,,465,4.235955056179775

3529292,4,B001DGFGQI,"So misleading!  This is not about the Beach Boys and Satan, (or even Manson except for a few unrelated minutes).  It's mostly about Brian and his struggles.  I grew up a few miles away from him in the same era and LOVED the Beach Boys in the early sixties!  I also lived 3 blocks from the beach and was as afraid of the ocean as Brian was.  The Cold War ruled our lives and we had regular ""drop drills"" at school, when we were convinced that the Russians were about to bomb us into oblivion.  That needs to be factored into Brian's sensitivity too.  I was a student protester who was tear gassed in Isla Vista during the 1970 riots as well.  Brian Wilson was a genius to be sure, but the abuse by his father and responsibility for the success of the Beach Boys was simply too much to bear.  I respect Brian for being a survivor and creating music that brings us back to a happier, innocent time.  The Saturday Night Live clip is hilarious and Paul (!) and Linda McCartney at Brian's birthday party are not to be missed!  Enjoy the documentary, and shame on the people who wanted you to think the Beach Boys were Satanists!  Long live the Beach Boys and all they represent!",1384819200,8,1172,4.301369863013699
3529293,4,B001DGFGQI,"Lots of footage from the early days plus more recent interviews with Brian Wilson. Don't let the title fool you. It's a nice little straight-up documentary that doesn't break any new ground, but interesting nonetheless.",1382313600,3,219,5.285714285714286
3529294,1,B001DGFGQI,"I wouldn't even call this a movie.  This is a complete waste of time!  Do not let your curiosity get the best of you like I did. There is no plot or any kind of organization to this ""film.""",1375056000,,189,3.8205128205128207
3529295,4,B001DGFGQI,"This is an interesting look by a German production team at an old narrative:  the progression of American society in the 1960's from sunny utopia to violent chaos.  They do this by focusing on the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson in particular, then shifting focus to Charles Manson toward the end.  They kind of fumble the segway by spending too little time on the Manson / Dennis Wilson connection, such that one is left thinking ""wait, why are we talking about Charles Manson now?"" but if you already know about that connection it makes more sense.  The best part is all the old Beach Boys footage which will be more than enough reason to check this out for many fans.  You also have to be willing to put up with Kim Fowley's improvised busking, which is no mean feat.",1374364800,6,766,4.482014388489208
3529296,3,B001DGFGQI,I thought it was going to talk more about the manson case. This documentary is mostly about the famous groups of the 50s and 60s. I like that music but again I would have liked more on the Manson case.,1365984000,,201,4.05
3529297,5,B001DGFGQI,I learned quite a bit from watching this one. It gives good information on the early days and some good footage.,1361145600,2,112,4.380952380952381
3529298,4,B001DGFGQI,"If you make it past the ridiculous first minute or so of opening title screen and ""spooky"" after effects fan footage, this documentary is chock full of great stuff. As a Brian Wilson fan, I highly recommend it. Although it appears they were trying to tie something together with Dennis Wilson and Manson, it doesn't work and doesn't go anywhere. This should be re cut into two shorts. The Wilson/Beach Boys aspects and interviews with Brian are great, however. And I do recommend it for that reason only.",1339286400,2,504,4.738636363636363
3529299,3,B001DGFGQI,"I enjoyed the old footage...some color, some b/w. Old promo reels, tv performances, intimate studio stuff, and excerpts of an interview with Brian at his Hollywood Hills home (circa 1995-ish, I believe). Producer Don Was tries to set the Brian Wilson legend straight: Wilson is a misunderstood genius - responsible in whole or in part - for some of the best songs of all time. He's a man who suffered a mental break down, the result of his simmering schizophrenia, mania & depression, the pressures of success, a rigorous schedule that included touring and recording an unimaginably prolific outpouring of material (16 studio albums in under six years with the 1968 release of Friends, the last for a while to feature Brian at the creative center), and yes, the drugs.  He's not just some goofball Southern California beach bum who got into acid after making disposable pop music in the '60s, though there is a thread of truth that weaves through that grossly oversimplified summation of the man. The Beach Boys were America's only viable rebuttal to the British invasion, in particular The Beatles (who greatly admired and were influenced by Wilson's offerings). As Was points out, The Beatles were #1, a successful group encouraged by lavish public and critical acclaim, who worked together with a master producer toward greater heights (ironically those likely inspired by Wilson himself); while Brian forged his art despite the critics - private, public and professional. Okay, you get it... I could go on and on, but where's Satan? I thought this video was to include information on the occult and The Beach Boys. Not at all. What it does is dissolve into a jagged ending tying Charles Manson to the band via Dennis Wilson. We know that already. Yes, maybe Charlie's Family members were after Terry Melcher that infamous night, but Sharon Tate just happened to be renting his place. Who knows? The dots are just not well connected. It's 4/5 Beach Boys history, 1/5 Charles Manson/Family history - peppered with loose connecting strings. The title is misleading, perhaps I should have noticed the discrepancies; it's actually called: The Beach Boys and THE Satan - NOT: The Beach Boys and Satan. This video was interesting more for its interviews (Kim Fowley, Don Was...) than its educational merits; most of us know this stuff already. Just be aware that you're not buying a study of Satanism or its effects on The Beach Boys. Keep that in mind and you'll like this just fine.",1277078400,33,2481,4.935406698564593
3529300,2,B001DGFGQI,"Last year, I noticed a copy of this DVD on the shelf at my local Fry's Electronics.  I was intrigued by the title; I thought ""ooooh... a dark and creepy look at the mid-sixties LA music scene & how good ol' Brian Wilson sold his soul the the Devil in exchange for his songwriting gifts.  Sounds fascinating!"".  I knew that Manson (as a struggling musician with dubious talent) had played around the fringes of the aforementioned scene & that he had somewhat of a tangential tie to Dennis Wilson (via Terry Melcher).

As fate would have it, I didn't buy tBB&tS on that day, & I pretty much forgot about it.

Yesterday, I found myself in the very same store & as I passed the DVD rack, there it was.  ""I'm not going to pass it up this time"" I told myself & I snapped it up.

I got it home... popped into the player... & now all I have to say is, ""what a bloody disappointment!"". Suffice if to say that my above mentioned assumptions were nothing more that wishful thinking & apart from a brief mention of Melcher's associations with Manson and Dennis Wilson, what you have here are two short documentaries, neither all that informative, that just happen to co-habitate the same disc.

If you are familiar with the story of the Beach Boys & you've read Helter Skelter, there's really nothing new for you here.  True, there was an informative look at Brian & his particular form of eccentricity; & the claim that the Tate/Labianca hit might actually have been intended for Melcher and Mark Lindsey was a new one on me, but other than that... yuck.

As for me... I'm off to eBay to find a buyer for this & recoup at least SOME of my investment!",1268524800,2,1639,4.397350993377484
