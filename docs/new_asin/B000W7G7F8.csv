There are no instructions on  how to get yourself limber enough to be able to do the exercises. I am not a limber person and thought these DVDs would show me a safe way to get that way, but I was wrong. If your looking for a way to limber up don't use these tapes they are not safe.",1224201600,2,377,4.013333333333334
8221481,5,B000W7G7F8,"I'm thrilled with this video - the lower back focus training, because it
had saved me from having to do surgery on my back. I had severe back
pain and when going to doctors all I would hear is that I needed
surgery. I didn't want to go through that and I decided to look for an
alternative method, quite incidentally my son (who's a martial artist)
had purchased Paul Zaichik's other DVD about splits, and told me that
Paul also had a back pain video.
I've decided to give it a shot. I liked everything about it, the way it
was presented by Paul without all that mambo jumbo about yoga's
spiritual side, since he it seems uses some aspects of yoga in this
video. I liked his pleasant voice and the nice and relaxing music in the
background. I liked how he explained everything and gave different
variations so that I could continue at my own pace. But most of all I
loved that after following it just one time I felt my excruciating pain
recede! I could finally sleep through the night! And after a few weeks
of following the video every other day, I can now tell you that I am
PAIN FREE!
So if you're suffering form back pain and aren't sure whether this dvd's
good for you or not, let me stop your fears, this is money well spent!

8221482,1,B000W7G7F8,After 15 or 20 minutes of listening to this guy breathing without doing hardly anything for my back I gave up on this video.  I was hoping for a focused lower back workout like the title implies but I didn't get it here.,1207353600,3,220,4.116279069767442
8221483,4,B000W7G7F8,"After hemming and Hawing over the cost of this video, I finally bought the video. The reason I bought this is b/c I am only 37 and I have had Back spasms for the last 5 years and I am frankly, tired of it and the exercises my Dr. has me do have not worked for me.
Well, I watched it first and thought ""Great, I wasted my money, it's just another Yoga thing."" There is a breathing segment, short workout for morning & evening and a Long routine for when you have more time.
So Yesterday, I started on the long routine. I did not finish it but only b/c I was out of time. But, even though it is the ""same old moves"" he puts in a lot of variations and explanations that I found really helpful without a bunch of eastern religious mumbo jumbo that other videos put in.
AND, unlike other dvd's & videos with Yogo, stretching, and calisthenics, I did not hurt today! I slept through the night without waking up stiff like normal. (I own a plethora of workout tapes.)
Well, I will probably repost another review once I have done this for a few weeks.",1205798400,5,1043,4.1683168316831685
