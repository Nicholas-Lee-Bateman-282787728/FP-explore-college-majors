367600,5,6301802268,I saw this movie back in the 80's and couldn't find it since.  A good movie with Tommy Lee Jones.,1334102400,,97,3.85
367601,5,6301802268,while not his best tommy lee jones is good as a nam vet who takes over for his dead friend and takes over central park to highlight how wrong vets are being done. the set up and the taking of the park are all handled very well and the story holds up very well when it could have easyly fallen apart. this was first made for hbo in the 80's and really needs to be on dvd.,1147910400,2,370,3.8181818181818183
367602,5,6301802268,"This is one of the best Tommy Lee Jones movies. Also it is one of the best soundtracks performed by Tangerine Dream. I have the original soundtrack recording released by Silva America (SSD 1004) and it is great!. Two of my favorite tracks are 3. The Letter (Parts 1&2), and 6. Love Theme. They are very emotive and they always make me remember the movie. I relly hope they release this movie in DVD.",1140566400,7,399,4.405405405405405

367606,4,6301802268,"This totally underrated movie was here and gone in what seemed like less than a minute and was lost in the heap of ""Rambo""esque movies that were released, but this one was definitely better than average.
I can't remember the last time I saw a VHS copy of this film and it's been AGES since it was even on tv, but I'm still holding out hope that it will one day make it into DVD format.
If you haven't seen it and you like those 'ticked-off Viet Nam vet' movies, pick this one up...if you can find it.",1111363200,8,500,4.112244897959184

367643,5,6301802268,"This movie deserves a Criterion Blu-Ray release. A quintessential, yet unsung, 1980s movie that perfectly captures the zeitgeist of the post-Vietnam War era. Yet, the movie's themes remain in sharp focus through today's lens, as it deals with such subjects as PTSD, suicide among military veterans, gun violence, acts of domestic terrorism, anti-establishment politics and feeling ineffectual in the world. ""I'm just a guy, my life has been directed by other people, there are a lot of people like me, they don't have any control over their lives,"" Mitch (Tommy Lee Jones) says, and there are many today who feel the same way. What better way to ease these tumultuous emotions than to re-release this fine HBO movie on today's media platforms? It's time give ""The Park Is Mine"" its due!",1470700800,,786,5.00763358778626

367659,3,6301802268,"A Viet Nam Veteran decides to take control of Central Park with threats of force for a couple of days before Veteran's Day so people will be aware of those that fought and died for the country but have been forgotten.

He appears to have PTSD. The police are obviously concerned and aspire to use some tactics one of which includes sending in Soldiers of Fortune! A reporter gets into the park and spends time with the guy to get his story People on the street are interviewed and support his act of domestic terrorism. ends in an odd way.

I was somewhat sickened by it.

THANK YOU VETERANS!  Filmed in Canada!",1447200000,,611,4.428571428571429

367706,4,6301802268,"This is not a high dollar movie, but it was pretty good. Still plays the veteran gets weird after the Vietnam War, but it does tell his side of the story some. Does not paint the picture that it was all the wars fault or the Vet's fault, but that Government will overstep its bounds sometimes, and also that when a man/s family abandons him, then things happen. I liked it more for the plan, weaponry, and shows the true nature of some politicians.",1400198400,3,448,4.345238095238095

367708,1,6301802268,"I watched this movie because of all the five star reviews, not knowing what to expect but hoping for a good movie. I thought the movie was unbelievable for one thing. I thought the acting was poor, seemed like the actors were having a hard time believing people would buy the plot. The movie seemed to lack substance meaning the characters were shallow and the plot too simple and lacking diversity. I was very disappointed and this reinforces the fact that even with a lot of great reviews a movie can still be terrible. This makes me wonder, who wrote all these five star reviews?",1396483200,,582,4.552380952380952

367711,5,6301802268,"I choose this rating because its a show that says something it makes a statement, about society than and now, people have to learn how to stand up for things they believe in, and the material they used hit the nail on the hammer with the hammer. Especially people in government who have no clue about the people they represent, they didn't care back than and the don't care now. Its the way government evades everything thats important to the people and have their own agenda's, so in the movie he holds the city hostage makes people think and thats a start unfortunately he had to do it at gun point. But sometimes that may be needed in the future.  Thanks Mike",1388534400,2,662,4.426229508196721

The movie is quick and has few known cast memebers, however the plot is cool and the message is good, the acting well, this was initially a HBO special in the late 80's so it is fair,  I would definitley recommend this movie if you like guns, bullets and a short but to the point plot about veterans, don't expect Oscar acting, but it is enjoyable never the less.",1376697600,6,622,4.175
