2757817,2,B000N6UDI0,"Save your money, this DVD's resolution looks like it was shot with a low def cheap camcorder. The lighting is bad. Each scene opens up with the cheesiest fonts, and they don't go away for a few seconds, getting in the way of trying to enjoy the scenes.",1239062400,21,252,4.270833333333333
2757818,5,B000N6UDI0,"I actually got this DVD for my 4 parrots, who really seem to enjoy videos of nature.  Ones with no talking, just background music.  This is a very nice DVD, and the background music is soothing - not too loud or overwhelming.  The scenes are beautiful.  When the birds are getting too noisy I pop in the DVD, give them each a peanut and they calm down.  Usually.  :-)
When I retire, I'll make good use of their DVD's, including this one.  I would much rather have a DVD like this playing in the background than the drivel on television these days.  I think it's well done and worth the money.",1208131200,42,592,4.27027027027027

8175256,3,B000N6UDI0,"The seller was excellent on this transaction.  The Virtual Relaxation product is, for me, acceptable.  However, some may find it a 5-star rating.  The reason that I am not that pleased with it:  I would prefer nature sounds (as in my previous VHS version) instead of music and wording and skipping through various scenes.",1297728000,,321,4.888888888888889

8175260,1,B000N6UDI0,"The scenes and music in this CD are very(very) depressing. I thought it would be kind of a light pitter patter of rain with a
background of classical music. I was so wrong. I got this around
Christmas time which sometimes can be very depressing for some
and this one just increased my melancholy.",1261440000,,296,4.5
8175261,3,B000N6UDI0,"Portions of this you are left watching a leaf with rain drops for serveral minutes, at first you think, yes pretty, but then you think, okay, let's move on now.  I think they timed it with the music, which actually ruins the whole scenery.  I'd prefer they didn't try to imagine what we like to listen to.  Just jungle noise would have been more peaceful.  Pretty, can't deny it, but not relaxing.",1241481600,11,397,4.472222222222222
