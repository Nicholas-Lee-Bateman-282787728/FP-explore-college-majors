1729071,3,B000068TPD,"Now I am a big fan of Motel Hell especially the Pig Head Chainsaw Scene. But for Deranged I must say it is the worst portray of Ed Gein you should go buy the movie Ed Gein instead.
People say it is the most accurate portrayal in Deranged but if you have seen the crime scene photots right before he is arrested he does noe behead the woman and does not cut her from her neck down to her anus as stated in an interview. Also he was arrested at a neighbors and if you look closely before he arrested the lighting is almost snow white yet when the camera changes scenes its dark, and the blood is too red. And also he was never in his mothers room after she died nor dug up her corpse. Its a good deal Two dvds and the horror but if u want to see the best Ed Gein portrayal so far Buy Ed Gein or Texas Chainsaw Massacre",1039478400,2,816,3.9216867469879517
1729072,5,B000068TPD,"Tis DVD is great! I first watched ""Motel Hell"" and was impressed with the soundtrack in full stereo. The picture quality is far better than the VHS tape. okay, so it may be a little dark or grainy during some scenes, but it was most likely a lower-budget picture and not great lighting or photography resulted. What can you say about this? It's a masterpiece!
Then I turned it over and watched ""Deranged"". The first thing I noticed is that Roberts Blossom, who plays Ezra Cobb, was Doc in ""Escape From Alcatraz"", who give himself a hatchet-job (that wouldn't have been out of place here!).
I have seen the film ""Ed Gein"" with Steve Railsback, and this follows it pretty much to the letter, only Gein was still around when this was made, which is probably why it wasn't a straight biography of him. Still, I found it genuinely creepy, and a great film. Nothing else to add that's already been said here.
This has never been on video before, to my knowledge, which would make it a rarity, but a great piece of unearthed treasure. Kudos to MGM for putting this out. Recommended!",1035158400,3,1075,4.546391752577319
1729073,5,B000068TPD,"Talk about one hell of a horror double feature. First of all,these 2 films are horror classics. I was amazed to find out that they were going to be on the same dvd as a double feature. First of all Deranged is one of my all time favorite horror flicks w/ an excellent performance by Roberts Blossom. Blossom plays Ezra Cobb.. a character based on the serial killer Ed Gein. The same serial killer Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Psycho were based on. The movie was filmed in 1974 w/ early and excellent Tom Savini make-up effects. Deranged definitly has that creepy documentary feel..some scenes you almost feel like your sitting in the same room w/ Ez as he plays w/ his belly drum..using a leg bone for a drum stick..nice. The transfer was pretty decent for an older,almost forgotten film..but my only complaint is that they cut out a few scenes..one being Ez taking out an eyeball w/ a spoon and another one w/ Ez holding up a fresh cut human flesh mask he planned on putting on his decomposing mother. So other then the missing scenes I was extremely happy having this film on dvd. As for the Motel Hell part of the disc..Farmer Vincent has a special recipe for his smoked meats...and let me tell you..his smoked meat isn't beef. The film is fun..watching him and his demented sister go to their secret garden, where they have a special way of treating their human meat stock is great. Plus farmer Vincent runs around wearing a pig head w/ chainsaw in hand..u cant beat that..as for the picture..the trasfer for Motel Hell is a bit grainy..but for the cheap price u cant beat it. In my opinion, Deranged is the better movie of the 2. Im a big fan of surreal horror and Deranged has that going for it. If you loved Texas Chainsaw and never saw Deranged pick this disc up...Its great stuff.",1033516800,4,1788,4.504615384615384
1729074,4,B000068TPD,"Gotta love Motel Hell! Funny, gory, creepy.  It certainly keeps you entertained throughout. Calhoun is great, his sister - like something out of a John Water's movie -- is hysterical.  This has a little bit of everything. Great garden(!)scenes.  Deranged is just creepy.  Slimey creepy.  Well done because it has a kind of documentary feel to it, but there is something that makes you feel just a little dirty after you've watched it.",1032566400,,434,4.890410958904109
1729075,4,B000068TPD,"Do you remember actor Rory Calhoun?  If not, he was the actor who starred in the 1953 classic ""How To Marry A Millionnaire"" with Betty Grable and Marilyn Monroe.  He also starred in the 1954 Western Masterpiece ""The River of No Return"" with Robert Mitchum and Marilyn Monroe.
That was back in the Fifties...mid Fifties...when I first entered grade school.  ""Motel Hell"" was released by United Artists in 1980 and it, too, stars Rory.  Now on with the show...
Rory stars as the famous Farmer Vincent...procurer of fine smoked meats that have been enjoyed by those ""within a 100 mile radius"" for more than 30 years.  His sidekick is Ida, played by Nancy Parsons.  The concoction of Rory and Nancy spells SHEER TERROR.  Let's sum it up this way, as I quote Farmer Vincent from the movie:  ""It takes all types of critters to make Farmer Vincent fritters.""
The film also features, of all people, WOLFMAN JACK...who portrays a Reverend (no foolin').
This 22-year-old horror classic is defintely a diamond in the rough, and may prove to be a needle in a haystack when you go out to find it.  It was just released on DVD and is accompanied by another horror landmark ""Deranged"".  The second flick is more of a portrayal of ""me""...""Motel Hell"" is a dream for horror flick fans.  It has the terror and humor that makes this genre such a delightful stroll through pure entertainment.
Wanna get scared...laugh...catch some great acting by the legend Rory Calhoun...and The Wolfman???  See ""Motel Hell"".  As Rory says in a ""tongue-in-cheek"" scene from the film - ""Meat's Meat, and Man's Gotta Eat.""
On a ""horror"" scale of 1-to-5, five being the highest, I give ""Motel Hell"" a 4.3.  Enjoy!",1031875200,,1675,4.750865051903114

Deranged
1974; running time 1h. 22 m.
Starring: Roberts Blossom, Cosette Lee, and Leslie Carlson; Directed by: Alan Ormsby and Jeff Gillen

Ezra Cobb (Blossom) lives with his religious-fanatic mother (Lee) who has taught him from an early age to hate women.  Her death traumatizes him so much, he digs her up, brings her back home, and acts like she's still alive.  As Ezra's madness deepens, he begins digging up more bodies to restore and use to decorate his home, as well as help keep his mother company.  Not bad, but a little slow-moving, and there's not really any blood & gore until the end.  Based on the story of real-life killer Ed Gein.  Features a Trailer (1:33 runtime), plus English, French, and Spanish subtitles.

Motel Hell
1980; running time 1h. 41 m.
Starring: Rory Calhoun, Paul Linke, Nancy Parsons, and Nina Axelrod; Directed by: Kevin Connor

Crazy Farmer Vincent (Calhoun) and his crazier sister Ida (Parsons) live on a farm with an attached motel called the Motel Hello (the ""o"" in ""Hello"" on the neon sign always shorts out).  Vincent's smoked meats are the best around, made with a special ingredient--human flesh!  He keeps his human ""animals"" in a special garden--buried up to their necks with their vocal cords cut.  Viewers will NEVER forget the sight and sounds of the victims--the creepiest part of the movie!  This print of the film isn't the best--I needed to crank up the sound pretty high, and the night-time scenes were WAY too dark, lessening the impact of the ""garden"" scenes and the climactic fight.  Features a trailer (2:40 runtime), plus English, French, and Spanish subtitles and spoken language options.",1457568000,3,1742,4.982698961937716

I remember when it came out and you saw the picture of the guy in the pig mask with the chainsaw(which caused a big fuss back then)and you thought you were gonna be in for a ride but turned out to be a comedy instead which I don`t mind watching still. But as for DERANGED,you got to get the 30th anniversary German Special Edition!!! It has the deleated ""head and eyeball scooping scene""which is not in the MGM release. You also get extras out the ass!!!Ed Gein documentaries,behind the scene interviews and so on. Cool menu,superb transfer although the missing scene was pasted in so the pic quality changes a little.

1729221,4,B000068TPD,"...so goes one of the many memorable lines from MOTEL HELL a stylish 1980 horror movie with lots of sly humor from Brit director Kevin Connor successfully making his American film debut. The film defines the term ""cult classic"" as it tells the story of Farmer Vincent Smith (Rory Calhoun) whose smoked meats are legendary in his neck of the woods. Could it be his secret herbs and spices or might his garden of human ""plants"" have something to do with it. Working in tandem with his large and equally demented sister Ida (Nancy Parsons). Farmer Vincent ambushes people on the local highway at night and takes them to his ""secret garden"" in order to turn them into jerky. After a young woman (Nina Axelrod) survives one such accident, Vincent takes her to the titular motel run by him and his sister in the hopes that she'll be able to ""help out"". When Vincent's younger brother Bruce (Paul Linke), the local sheriff, falls in love with the girl, the stage is set for quite a finale.

The real beauty of MOTEL HELL is how it is able to deftly balance its black humor with its more gruesome elements. The film is loaded with striking imagery from its beautifully lit night scenes to the truly disturbing ""plants"" in the secret garden and the horrific noises they make (their vocal cords have been slit). Despite my descriptions so far, MOTEL HELL is remarkably restrained in the gore factor until the very end when its slow build up results in a duelling chainsaws matchup between the two brothers. The gem of a script from Robert & Stephen-Charles Jaffe cleverly pokes fun at everything from ""swinging singles"" to televangelists. It even recycles the bound heroine heading for a moving saw bit from silent melodrama. Loads of great one liners, like the one in the review's title, abound and are expertly thrown away by the film's principals. Director Connor said he would only take the job if all the humor was left in. His request was definitely met. Calhoun's last line is a classic.

DERANGED, the second film in this MIDNITE MOVIES double feature set is a totally different film altogether. It's based on the life of Ed Gein, the real life serial killer who ""preserved "" his victims and was the inspiration for Norman Bates in PSYCHO. It is played straight for the most part and illustrates the difference between 'twisted' and 'sick'. It boasts an excellent central performance from character actor Roberts Blossom but is decidely unpleasant with a strong ""ewww"" factor. The full title of the film is DERANGED: CONFESSIONS OF A NECROPHILE. Alan Ormsby, who earlier did CHILDREN SHOULDN'T PLAY WITH DEAD THINGS with Bob Clark (A CHRISTMAS STORY) and would later write MULAN for Disney, directed. To each his own. I prefer the MOTEL HELL approach but most fans want their horror films to be more like DERANGED. If you get the set, then you can make the choice for yourself. Clever or straight-forward.",1385683200,,2903,4.757936507936508

The first one Deranged is a little messed up for a 70s movie (think sorta a mix of Texas chainsaw and a documentry), pretty solid horror flick with some good crazy acting from the old guy. The best movie though is Motel Hell with it's crazy funny over the top acting and plot. Worth it just for that movie and the pig scene at the end is epic.

1729244,5,B000068TPD,"Motel Hell alone would have justified the money spent on this, but you also get Deranged. Deranged is a decent movie, but it can't come close to the other one. Motel Hell, for me, is one of those movies that just makes you feel great watching it. The hard thing is trying to point out exactly why. If you told most people that seeing a movie about a farmer using human meat to make jerky made you feel all warm inside, they'd probably think you were deranged yourself. This is something different though. It's just a campy, mostly comical movie that brings back some nostalgia for anyone who grew up around that time and somehow got lucky enough to check this out on vhs or cable.

I'll admit the plot is pretty silly and a lot of people wouldn't sit through it today, but for all the fans of this genre and time period for movies will love it. They couldn't have had a better actor to play the Farmer Vincent character than this guy. It's like he was born for this type of part, and he does it flawlessly. Both him and his sister both (in the movie), give great performances. The rest of the cast however is another story, but to me that just adds to the fun. I'm not sure why this never got a proper dvd release, but this is fine for me. It's widescreen, the picture is fine, and you also get the other movie which isn't terrible itself.",1349395200,,1339,4.271653543307087

1729249,3,B000068TPD,"This dual-sided disc from MGM Midnite Movies is the first one I've bought where the film unknown to me turned out to be better than the one I was buying it for.

I had high hopes for ""Motel Hell"", hoping to see Nancy Parsons (Beulah Balbricker from the ""Porky's"" movies) chew the scenery to bits. Unfortunately, the script doesn't give her much to do besides pig out on chicken drumsticks and try and drown Nina Axelrod in the big 'ol swimming hole. Parsons' best role is still as the deadly masseuse Zora on ""Charlie's Angels"" back in 1978.

Here she's sister to Rory Calhoun, and together they make the best smoked meat in the county. But what their customers don't know is that their special ingredient lay in the hidden ""human garden"" they're constantly cultivating by capturing innocent passersby on the highway.

While I'm sure this idea sounded much better on paper, the execution leaves a lot to be desired. It plays like a black comedy more than an actual slasher/horror film--but even then misses the mark. Notable only for an amusing turn by Elaine Joyce as half of a swinging couple, and an early non-speaking role for John Ratzenberger (Cliff from ""Cheers""). Nothing else here to really recommend.

""Deranged"" on the other hand, is much more interesting and well-made, yet downbeat and not an enjoyable film that would merit repeat viewings. Loosely based on Ed Gein, in this one a middle-aged Mama's boy goes off the deep end after the old lady dies. He digs up her corpse and eventually embarks on a killing spree to keep bringing companions home for mother. A delayed sexual awakening complicates things and has him kidnapping a cocktail waitress and the teenage hardware store clerk. (Canadian viewers: Look for the cigarette display behind her; I clearly spotted Craven A's and a few other brands that clued me in that this thing was shot in Toronto).

The lead actor Roberts Blossom is creepy and looks disturbed, so the casting was perfect. Micki Moore was very beautiful and likeable as the ill-fated waitress. There's a bit of humour to break up the bleak story when an elderly patron of the bar bemoans the fact his virility isn't what it used to be (""It just hangs there like a turkey neck"").

The print quality of ""Deranged"" is fantastic. I'd never heard of it before, but any fans of the film will be thrilled with the brightness, sharpness and clarity. The gore is minimal considering the subject matter. There's only a bludgeoning and a naked body slicing to speak of. For being made in 1974, ""Deranged"" hardly looks dated at all. The technique seems very contemporary, except for when the narrator actually steps into the frame at several points. ""Deranged"" is a precursor to the gorier, sleazier serial killer movies of the '80s like ""Maniac"" and ""Henry"".",1314576000,5,2785,4.791666666666667
1729250,3,B000068TPD,"I'm seeing that most of the reviews are for the double feature of Deranged/Motel Hell, however, I'm only reviewing the Deranged film, since I've not seen Motel Hell nor do I own that double feature DVD. Deranged is one of the better, if not one of the best film adaptations of a real life serial killer. Made in 1974, this movie is basically the story of Ed Gein, with only the names and locations changed. What makes this film better than a lot of others is the accuracy of the real events and crimes of Ed Gein himself. Not saying its 100% accurate, but it comes a lot closer than any of the other Ed Gein based films that I've seen. And just as a standalone film, even if you don't have any knowledge of the crimes its based upon, it's still a solid film. Roberts Blossom does a really good performance as the Ezra (Ed). Its a fairly short film, and a narrator begins the film explaining the back story of Ezra, and periodically comes in and gives the audience more information regarding the events and crimes of the main protagonist. Though warned at the beginning of the film by the narrator that this film may not be for the ""squeamish"", its really not much of a gorefest at all. Actually it could have, and should have been much more graphic,considering the actual crimes the movie is based upon. Perhaps the director wasn't going for that shock value, or maybe it was for budgetary reasons, nonetheless, what effects are in the film aren't bad for it's time. Though when compared to something like legendary The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (loosely based on Ed Gein), which came out that same year and was done on a low budget, this film's effects don't reach that level of creepiness and authenticity. Though few films do. Like I've said, if you're looking for a fairly accurate account of the crimes of Ed Gein, or if you just simply want to watch a solid horror/thriller flick, then I suggest you check this one out. Again, to me, its much better than a lot of these B-movies being made about Gein and a lot of other real-life serial killers.",1310774400,,2049,4.49597855227882
1729271,3,B000068TPD,"Well Farmer Vincent and his sister Ida are a strange twosome and although they are famous for their smoked meats, their methods are certainly questionable to say they least. Motel Hell is a rather dark comedy that if played straight would be one disturbing piece of cinema.

This is one of the finer examples of 80's horror that is quite retrained by today's standards. I watched this on HDNET and the film looked better than I had ever seen it. Unfortunately I am not sure how the quality of the transfer is on this two-fer DVD. If you like twisted dark comedies, then this campy horror flick might satisfy. As for Deranged, I haven't seen it in many years, so I'm going to have to watch the two films on this DVD and add to my review about the quality of this release and Deranged as a film.

Rory Calhoun is at his demented best here and sister Ida is one scary freak! So when you're enjoying your BBQ today, think of adding a little of Farmer Vincent's quality smoke meat products to the mix!

1729274,4,B000068TPD,"""Deranged"" is the story of a souther mama's boy named Ezra (Roberts Blossom) as his mom just died recently, but some how she just haunts him as he has no choice but to dig up her body and use it for conversations as he is going to the brink of insanity. He starts to murder off innocent women and keep their bodies, sometimes have sex with the bodies becoming a necrophiliac and even cook their flesh for dinner. ""Motel Hell"" is the story of Farmer Vincient Smith (Rory Calhoun) and his sister Ida (Nancy Parsons) run a meat farm and motel called Motel Hello where some of the guests usually disappear and Vincient makes the finest smoked meats in town, his stuff sells like hotcakes and his motel is quite successful around travelers. It really does kind of takes all kinds of critters to make Farmer Vincient's Fritters as Vincient's police officer brother (Paul Linke) is skeptical about what makes the meat taste sooo good, there's a catch to it as there's a secret garden with live humans caught for butchering to become what people will eat.

These are two well made and enjoyable cannibal based movies, first off ""Deranged"" is influenced by the horrific murders of Ed Gein and came out the same year that the masterpiece ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"". Not as memorable as that movie, ""Deranaged"" is still a very documentary-esque look at the mind of a serial killer long before there was ""Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer"", it's a nail-biting suspense shocker that will hit you in the stomach. ""Motel Hell"" is a very entertaining horror comedy that plays like a comical version of ""Psycho"", ""The Hills Have Eyes"" and even ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" as it's a lighthearted satire about cannibalism and motel based horror movies, the film does co-star Playmate Monique St. Pierre and an early appearence by John Ratzenberger. The film does have a cult following to this day and is one of the most satisfying cannibal/slasher/horror comedies around.

It was a different age in the late '70s, early 80's and I was sneakey to boot). I did a double-take when I saw the title. I only purchased the combo-pack because it was cheaper than buying ""Motel Hell"" alone. Needless to say, it wasn't the thought-provoking, nightmare-making machine it was to a nine-year-old but the nostalgia alone was worth the purchase. I am amazed with the selection that Amazon provides; anything I can summon from the mental files of my misguided youth will materialize in living color on my computer screen. I've already ordered several more deviant and bloody movies from Amazon and some more traditonal choices as well. The product I received was just what they said it was in the condition they implied. I can't reccomend Amazon enough; they are the real deal! And if you're in the mood for good old-fashioned horror, try Motel Hell (Deranged isn't too bad, either).<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Deranged-Motel-Hell-Midnite-Movies-Double-Feature/dp/B000068TPD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Deranged/Motel Hell (Midnite Movies Double Feature)</a>",1251504000,2,1280,5.637305699481865
1729276,3,B000068TPD,"Motel Hell (1980) Man, does that Farmer Vincent (Rory Calhoun) make some tasty smoked meats out at that old Motel Hello he runs with his sister Ida (Nancy Parsons)! And they are such friendly people! Too bad the ""o"" on their sign keeps burning out...After a terrible motorcycle accident claims the life of her much older boyfriend Bo, young Terry (Nina Axelrod) is rescued by and ends up staying with Vincent and Ida. Soon, the aging but handsome Vincent has charmed Terry into another May/December romance, though Ida doesn't seem too happy about it. Neither does their little brother Bruce (Paul Linke), the local sheriff. Eventually Terry finds out Vincent and Ida have some secrets, stuff even Bruce doesn't know. Stuff that involves all the auto accidents that happen around the motel that go unreported. Stuff involving a secret garden out in the back of the motel. And definitely stuff that goes on in the smokehouse right beside the motel. In fact, it might even be true that Vincent caused the accident that claimed Bo's life. Bruce also starts to catch on to just what everybody's been eating in those Farmer Vincent fritters, and he goes to rescue Terry, leading to a rather strange climax involving a chainsaw duel in the smokehouse with Vincent who for some reason has put a pig head on like a mask. (?) Reportedly this movie's script started out as a serious and grim horror entry, but for some reason what ended up on film is a very weird flick with silly bits undermining nearly all the scares. Calhoun and Parsons are both very good, Linke is playing a very goofy part as best he can, and Axelrod is pretty much nondescript which is probably why she is now a casting agent instead of an actress. To add to the Freaky Factor, Wolfman Jack turns up in two cameos, one as a vocal only radio DJ, the other as a local televangelist. (?) Everything that goes on in the secret garden is just a bit silly, and the whole ""pig head/mask"" thing , featured so strongly in the ads and the copious coverage in Fangoria magazine is really just a throwaway bit in the climactic scenes used more to hide Calhoun's stunt double than to be as evocative as it actually is. In fact, I'd guess more people remember the movie for that image (Pig head man wielding chainsaw) than for the movie itself. There are rumors of a remake in the works, and I guarantee you there will be lots more made of the pig head mask in it, with the new Farmer Vincent wearing it throughout the movie as he goes about his nefarious pursuits instead of it popping up in the last five minutes. In the end, the movie is worth a look for Calhoun and Parsons, but otherwise not very recommendable.",1244851200,2,2666,4.55625
1729277,5,B000068TPD,"This superb double feature from MGM will make you scared of traveling through the country - especially at night - on those long, winding roads.  There are demented, sadistic farmers like Ezra Cobb and Vincent Smith who can't help preying on tourists and locals alike.  If you enjoyed the classic horror hit, ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre,"" you will enjoy this double dose of demented serial killers.

  ""Deranged"" is a creepfest that grossed me out.  It chronicles the mental breakdown of Ezra Cobb, a middle-aged farmer who deeply loved and cared for his dying mother.  I couldn't help but feel sorry for him when she passed.  However, she filled his brain with hatred towards women.  Ezra suffers a mental breakdown.  He digs up his mom's corpse and attempts to restore her face with the flesh of recently deceased women.  From there, Ezra sinks into the bowels of depravity.  He begins luring women to his home and killing them.  He hints to his neighbors what he is doing but no one believes him until it is too late.  ""Deranged"" has a gruesome ending that you will not soon forget.

  ""Motel Hell"" is also filled with sadistic, grotesque horror.  Farmer Vincent lays bear traps in the roads in order to cause vehicles to crash.  With the help of his sister, Ida, he transports the survivors to their secret garden where they are planted in the ground up to their necks, their vocal cords cut and burlap bags placed over their heads.  They are left until ""ripe.""  Then they are harvested, cut into pieces and smoked.  Farmer Vincent sells his special meats to tourists and locals within a hundred mile radius of his farm.

  Whereas ""Deranged"" was presented in a more believable documentary format, ""Motel Hell"" has a lot of black humor.  The latter is not to be taken too seriously.  In fact, ""Deranged"" is based on the legend of infamous serial killer Ed Gein, ""The Butcher of Plainfield.  ""Psycho"" and ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" were also based on this true life account.

  Both ""Deranged"" and ""Motel Hell"" are classics and essential viewing for horror fans, especially those who love horror from the seventies and eighties.

Motel Hell was something else. I enjoyed this one a lot. It was more of a horror comedy type of movie. Really far out and I liked the characters. Farmer Vincent makes meats and plants tourtists in his garden. A friendly guy on first impression, he has some secrets hes hiding from the public concerning his meats.

Motel Hell:  The finer points of meat smoking.

The 'Motel Hello' has the 'O' burned out, which makes it Motel Hell ... but that part is trivial.  It's one of those homey, cozy places in the middle of nowhere, with not just the motel but a nice little shop that serves up the best smoked meats in the county.  Homegrown, I might add.  Farmer Vincent's Smoked Meats.

Vincent lives at the hotel with his sister Ida.  God I love Ida, she's so far-fetched and crazy.  Vincent and Ida spend their days tending the crops and fattening the hogs for slaughter.  ""It takes all kinds of critters to make Farmer Vincent's Fritters!""  The hotel is the perfect bait for fresh meat, and when no one is checked in, ol' Farmer Vincent checks the roads.  After causing a motorcycle crash, Vincent decides to keep one little lovely for his own plaything.

'Motel Hell' is filled with black comedy that will keep you laughing your horror filled butt off.  The dominatrix and the pervert who stay at the hotel (oh man, that plastic skirt is priceless!!), Wolfman Jack as a preacher, a psychedelic garden scene, a chainsaw fight with Vincent wearing a pig's head, all make for one of the best black comedy horror films ever made.  Serve up some cheese while watching this one.

Deranged:  Ed Gein in a tea party.

Supposedly based on the true account of Ed Gein, but taking way too many liberties, 'Deranged' still holds a soft spot in this black heart in spite of the low budget.  Made even more melodramatic by a glasses-wearing narrator, this film is cheese from beginning to end, but with a flavor you can't help but enjoy.

Ezra Cobb:  Murderer, Grave Robber, Necrophiliac, and known as ""The Butcher Of Woodside.""  Devastated after the death of his mother, whom he cared for most of his life, lonely and child-like Ezra finally digs up her corpse and brings it home to care for.

But Ezra needs fresh skin to keep Mama looking new, so he watches the obituaries for extra parts.  Ezra is a good boy though, and he treats the ladies he steals from the cemetery quite well, setting them up at tea parties with his Mama.  ""Life's a pain and God's a sadist.""

Naturally, Ezra's curiosity involving the opposite sex leads him to bring fresher meat to the table, eventually leading to some grisly discoveries.  Repairs are hard to make without fresh skin

'Motel Hell' is one of the most classic horror flicks to ever grace the screen.  'Deranged' is cheaply done but well acted and well photographed.  If you love horror, this is a MUST HAVE for your collection!  Enjoy!",1169769600,,2765,4.588957055214724

The alienated farmer who apparently suffered from an over-dominated mother who taught her son that women in general were vile, dirty and `not done' lived in his own fantasyworld which let to grave-robbery, collecting body parts and human skin to make numerous artefacts out of them, and eventually killing. Although it had to be said that the killing was more out of curiossity than out of lust, resentment or anything hatefull.

The first movie about the enstranged young man with a mother that even kept on guarding him long after she had perished is the Hitchcock classic ""Psycho"". Dark humor and suspense throughout, but not really a fact-based case study of the Gein case.

Doing a little more justice to the source is the 1974 ""The Texas Chainsaw massacre"", the grand daddy of all horror movies. It's a no-holds-barred outburst of insanity, mayhem and perversities. Not one but three local loonies, one with a mask made of human skin, terrorize a bunch of teenagers. The cheap but effectve way in which it was shot suggested a lot more than it actually showed and gave the movie a reputation of being extremely gory, while in fact, almost all fysical harm is done in the audience's mind. The stench of rotting flesh and withered skin however is almost tangible here and the insanity raised throughout this one has never been equalled.

But in that same year a lesser known film was made. Also on a limited budget, it is ""Deranged"" here, that comes closest to the nocturnal, goulish alter-live of Ed Gein.

Roberts Blossom is perfectly cast as the local farmboy Ezra Cobbs who looses his mother and becomes a kind of recluse.

He does mingle sometimes with the locals, staying over for diner, doing odd jobs for them, but one feels that he really lives in another time and place.

And that time and place being his oppressed youth were his dominating mother messed up his mind, making other women seem like some kind of natural enemy to man.

Going down a mental spiral, Ezra starts to dig up corpses and make tools and other things outof the bones and skin. He even starts to dress up in human suits.

Yet still he starts to feel sincere emotions for other women and at times he tries to make contact. But his mind is allready screwed up too much, and he is on the brink of sanity. The Point of No Return is reached when he unpurposely kills his first victim.

The real tragedy here is that Ezra himself isn't aware of him anything `doing wrong'. He is a nave, almost patheticly disturbed man, unaware of his mental sickness.

We, however, are. And that we still sympathise for this man is thanks to a powerful though low-key performance by Robberts Blossom.

And let's forget about the irritating ""intermezzo's"" by a laughable journalist who intrudes the story from time to time and gives a kind of visible voice-over (I believe that nowadays we would put a guy like this on an audio commentary track).

""Deranged"" is an obscure film that doesn't diserve its very obscurity. It's rough, juicy thrills mixed with some dry humour, a true sense of the awkward and insane, and a leading actor that manages to be a drama more than just a perversity.

""Deranged"" that said it was everything ""Ed Gein"" should have been. Well, they're wrong. ""Ed Gein"" was a lot more effective and managed to creep me out. ""Deranged"" had some freaky moments, but overall...It was funny. Yes. ""Deranged"" was a funny movie.
""Deranged"" is loosely based on Ed Gein. But the characters name is Ezra Cobb. Ezra is a loner, a mommas boy. When his mother dies
(this scene is supposed to be horrifying but comes off as funny)
his sanity begins to unravel and eventually he digs up her body and keeps her at the house. Then, Ezra realizes his need to kill people. The scariest part was at the end. This part really wasn't scary, but sad. Roberts Blossom (this is not a typo) played Ezra well enough and gave him a kind of menacing edge. But still. As for ""Motel Hell"", it wasn't as good as ""Deranged""
but it was funnier. ""Motel Hell"" is about Farmer Vincent (Rory Calhoun) and Ida. They run Motel Hello (the ""o"" is flickering out). They also have a line of fritters that is one of the most popular meats in the county. Problem is they are burying people who pass by their motel ALIVE.  Once they're fattened up they use them to make their various meats. Their brother, Bruce, who's a cop is oblivious to it however. But then Vincent meets Terry (Nina Axelrod) after shooting the motorcycle she was one, taking the man who was with her and burying him alive. Vincent and Bruce simultaneously fall in love with Terry which sets off sort of a chain reaction. Now there movies were made in the late seventies/ early eighties. So there's a lot of violence and a lot of nudity. Sometimes things which weren't meant to be scary come off as funny cuz they're so delightfully stupid.
But, Nina Axelrod is hot by the way.

1729305,4,B000068TPD,"Deranged (Jeff Gillen and Alan Ormsby, 1974)

Deranged purports to be the true story of Ed Gein (though the names have been changed to protect the innocent, naturally), and in its favor, it certainly gets more of the story right than any other Gein-inspired flick (one assumes the changes to the real story, which are confined to the last fifteen minutes of the movie, are there for dramatic tension). Gillen and Ormsby may not have had the budget of Psycho or The Silence of the Lambs, but they certainly had an idea they were ready to run with.

Ezra Cobb (Roberts Blossom, whose last big-screen picture was The Quick and the Dead back in 1995) hasn't had the most normal of lives; he's been housebound most of his life, first through the oversheltering of his parents, and then due to his mother's stroke-induced incapacitation. The film opens with Ma Cobb (Cosette Lee of My Side of the Mountain fame, in her last role) giving her son a few last words of advice on her deathbed. The opening moments of the film are truly chilling. Then you get to Ma Cobb's actual death, and you realize you're going to be getting some laughs out of this picture as well. The budget was small, and the directors decided to spend, well, none of it on special effects. The blood is bright red paint; even giallo films never looked this fake. (The blood effects never get any better, by the way. Gein-- erm, Cobb-- is shattered by the death of his mother, and the rest is history.

Told in documentary style (including the frequent onscreen presence of the narrator, Tom Sims [Leslie Carlson, who would soon thereafter become a David Cronenberg regular]), Deranged works with an unexpected feel of true dread whenever it doesn't descend into the wonderful world of basement-budget special effects (supplied by a young-- this was his first feature work-- Tom Savini, no less). The acting by almost everyone in the film is terrible, but Roberts Blossom stands out in a sea of mediocrity, and his portrayal of the demented serial killer as a guy who's just really, really uncomfortable around others (maybe because they're such bad actors?) works like nobody's business.

Take away the special effects and the token seventies-video-nasty nudity (which is quite nice, though, I must admit, and is true to real-life crime-scene photos) and you've still got something well worth your time. Even more so in some cases, I'd expect. *** ",1108944000,3,2412,4.8024096385542165

1729321,4,B000068TPD,"I'm really learning to love these MGM double feature discs. Usually, this motion picture studio releases its films on DVD with few or no extras, a supreme disappointment to cinema fans. When you can get two low budget cheese fests for such a low price, however, you tend to make a few allowances for the lack of bells and whistles. Who could turn down the wonders of ""Troll"" and ""Troll 2,"" for example, just because the movies' only extras are trailers? It's the same situation with ""Deranged"" and ""Motel Hell."" But don't worry. The wonderful badness of these two films makes extras a moot point. Besides, how could you get Nancy Parsons and Rory Calhoun into the studio to record a commentary track? They've both been dead for years.
""Deranged"" is a movie that every horror aficionado should see at least once. Actually, one time through is about all you'll be able to take of this low budget excursion into the dark, dank recesses of the human mind. Based on the legendary maniac Edward Gein, the movie ""Deranged"" has always had a small coterie of loyal fans. They claim that this movie is the closest thing there is to the real events that occurred in rural Wisconsin back in the 1950s. They're wrong, of course. Even a cursory examination of the Gein story will quickly tell you this film wanders far from the truth on several occasions. No matter, though, since the movie is still a fun way to waste a couple of hours. Instead of referring to their main maniac as Ed Gein, the moviemakers decided to rename the guy Ezra Cobb. Old Ezra resembles Eddie Gein in several ways: he's a mama's boy, a bit of a simpleton, and he quickly nosedives into the shrieking pits of insanity after his mother passes on. After his better half (mom, that is) goes to that great farmhouse in the sky, Ezra promptly starts to hear her voice in his head. He goes out, digs up her corpse, and installs her in the house. Soon, he begins to comb the countryside looking for other gals who might want to keep his mother company. A local waitress, a lascivious friend of his mother's who has designs on Ezra, and a local girl manning the counter in the hardware store all fall prey to Cobb's ever expanding lunacy. There's not a lot of gore here for the hounds, but the scuzzy atmosphere and seriousness of the cast (at least it seemed like they were serious) will keep you on the edge of your seat. The guy who played the Barry Convex role in ""Videodrome"" does a Rod Serling like role as narrator.
I personally prefer the second film on the disc, the 1980 cult classic ""Motel Hell."" Rory Calhoun, a distinguished actor with a long list of film credits stretching back into the Golden Age of Hollywood, throws his dignity to the wind in the part of Farmer Vincent, a meat manufacturer with a sinister secret. Working with his sadistic sister Ida (Nancy Parsons) out of the Motel Hello (that 'o' is missing on the sign, of course), Vincent always sends his customers packing with a bumper sticker, a box of free meat, and a million watt aw shucks smile. Behind the scenes, things are quite different. The good farmer spends his evenings laying traps on the local roadways, thus luring in a whole passel of hapless wayfarers for reasons best left unsaid here. When a girl survives a motorcycle accident orchestrated by the wily Vincent, the farmer decides to take her in so he can eventually teach her the secrets of curing meat. All sorts of unpleasant activities take place from this point on, as Ida's jealousy of the girl causes friction in the family. The local cop presents a challenge too even though he's related to Vincent and Ida. By the time you see two guys, one of them wearing a giant pig's head, battling away with chainsaws, you know you've just spent a few hours with a classic piece of cinema. If you want a few giggles, try and spot John Ratzenberger in a small role as one of Vincent's living beef jerky sticks. Wolfman Jack pops up to say hello as well.
We're talking zero production values for both films here, folks. ""Deranged"" is by far the grungier of the two films, with its broken down farmhouses, battered jalopies, and seedy looking characters; but ""Motel Hell"" won't win any awards for scenery design, either. One thing I will say about the latter film; the DVD transfer is amazingly sharp for a film made nearly twenty-five years ago. It looks like they shot this thing yesterday on top of the line film stock. The same unfortunately cannot be said for ""Deranged,"" which has a fair amount of grain and streaks in the picture. You don't really need a great looking picture to enjoy these cheesy films, but it sure is nice to see ""Motel Hell"" look this good. Moreover, you get the full version of the movie. Whenever this film appears on television, and it does amazingly enough, they usually cut out the scene where the city couple looking for a good time accidentally shows up at Motel Hello. That sequence is restored here in all of its whip cracking glory.
Give this disc a shot if you like low budget ham. The psychedelic experience in Farmer Vincent's secret garden alone is worth the price of the disc. I've been watching a bunch of these MGM double dip discs lately, and I'll keep watching them if the company keeps releasing them. You should, too.",1083628800,4,5261,4.5741525423728815
1729322,3,B000068TPD,"Cannibals, necrophiles, and murderers, oh my!  I own many of the MGM Midnight Movie releases, and I have to say, these two films together certainly combine to make the most gruesome release to date.
Deranged (1974) aka Deranged: Confessions of a Necrophile, was co-directed by actor Jeff Gillen (he played Santa Claus in the classic Christmas Story film released in 1983, ""You'll shoot your eye out, kid."") and writer Alan Ormsby, who also wrote the film, along with other films like My Bodyguard (1980), Cat People (1982), and Porky's II: The Next Day (1983), is based on the ghastly true life events of reclusive Wisconsin farmer Ed Gein, convicted of necrophilia, cannibalism, and murder, inspiring films like Psycho (1960), The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974) and Silence of the Lambs (1991) and others.  The film stars perennial old timing character actor Robert Blossoms as Ezra (Ez) Cobb, whom I best remember from the John Carpenter film Christine (1983), as George LeBay, the old timing man who sold the nerdish Arnie Cunningham the possessed car.
The film starts off with an on-screen narrator giving us some exposition about Ezra, who lives a quiet, solitary life caring for his deeply religious, domineering and bed ridden mother, who instills within Eddie the notion that women, in general, are evil and sex is sinful.  After her death, Ezra is left alone, and becomes miserable.  So much so he digs up his mother more than a year after her burial (yuck), and brings her home.  He soon begins finding fresher corpses, by following the obituaries, for all kinds of uses (double yuck).  Soon his compulsions move from dead corpses to living victims.  His secluded house becomes a shrine to all things dead.  But in small towns, missing women are very much noticed, and soon people begin following the fairly obvious trail left by Ezra, and discover a true American Psycho in their midst.
The production values within Deranged are all that great, but, as another reviewer stated, this actually worked for the film, giving it a gritty, realistic feel.  Blossoms was truly creepy with his gaunt features, creepy, awkward stares, and child-like demeanor, one who has depended on another for guidance and now finds the solitary existence after his mother's passing too much to bear, snapping his already weak will, emanating in nightmarish behavior.  What was really interesting for me was how much I was drawn into the film, and then shocked out of it by the occasional appearance by the on screen commentator, relaying information aspects of the story as it continued to unfold.  The film does get pretty graphic, but not to the point of showing much of the more grisly crimes comprising the true-life events.  There are three version floating around, ones running 78, 82, and 84 minutes.  This one runs 82 minutes, and is missing a scene, as stated by other reviewers.
Motel Hell (1980), directed by Kevin Connor, who also directed films like The Land that Time Forgot (1975), At the Earth's Core (1976), and The People that Time Forgot (1977), tells another horrific tale with a cannibal slant, but unlike Deranged, Motel Hell dishes out a heaping helping of dark comedy, making for a more palatable watch (pun intended), in my opinion.
The film stars Rory Calhoun and Nancy Parson as Vincent and Ida Smith, brother and sister who run the out of the way Motel Hello (the neon letter o at the end of Hello flickers on and off) and also produce locally famous Farmer Vincent's Smoked Meats, ""It takes all kinds of critters to make Farmer Vincent's fritters.""  What makes their meats so popular?  It's a family secret, but know it involves the kidnapping various passersby Vincent manages to ensnare in any number of traps he sets on the isolated road near the hotel.  What happens to these unfortunate victims?  Well, you really have to see it to believe it.  I'll give you a hint...stay out of the `secret garden', by all means.  After shooting out a tire of a couple on a motorcycle, an older man and a younger woman, Vincent takes in the woman, and with the help of his sister Ida, they nurse the woman back to health.  The woman, who knows not of the peculiar methods in Vincent and Ida produce their meats, is thankful and even develops a relationship with Vincent, leading to impending nuptials.  And what happens when she finally discovers their secret?
As I said, there is a good amount of black humor mixed with the horror, and the film was a lot less visceral than I thought it would be...the methods used to `fatten' up and keep the victims before their `harvesting' was quite disconcerting.  Rory Calhoun presents such a friendly image throughout most of the film, reminding me of Jed Clampett from the Beverly Hillbillies, but knowing what you know as the story unfolds, it makes it all the more sinister.  Look cameos by the legendary radio personality Wolfman Jack as an evangelical television preacher and John Ratzenburger of TV's Cheers as a drummer of an ill-fated rock band.  I especially like the S&M couple that stay at the motel, thinking they're in for a real kinky experience, only to find that they are dead wrong.  And the tearful admission by Rory Calhoun at the end is definitely worth sticking around for...
Both films look pretty good, with Motel Hell looking not quite a good as Deranged, and both are presented in wide screen format.  This is a two-sided disc, with the each movie occupying one side, and special features include theatrical trailers and English subtitles.  I'll leave you with one of my more favorite lines from Motel Hell as spoken by Farmer Vincent to his young fianc...'I'm gonna teach you the ancient art of smokin' meat.""

1729325,4,B000068TPD,"The MGM Midnite Movies is a great addition to any horror collector's collection. This one is Deranged/Motel Hell.
DERANGED is a story about Ezra Cobb. Actually, it's based on well-known killer, Ed Gein. They call Ezra ""Ez"" for short which is amusing because it basically sounds like ""Ed"" and I think that a few of the actors said ""Ed"" by mistake several times. OK, so Ezra is sitting next to his dying mother when she gives up living. She was buried and every week, it's said that Ezra visits his mother's grave at least 3 times a week. The year after her death, he hears his mother's voice say ""If you really loved me, you'd bring me back home...."" So he does just that. He digs her up and puts her in his car and drives her home. He uses things that look like skin to try and ""repair"" her until he gets the idea to use human skin instead...by killing and skinning.....
It's a pre-""In the Light of the Moon"" (A.K.A. ""Ed Gein"") flick that delivers what it promises-thin humor and frightening murders. What I didn't like was not the movie but the back cover: It seems that every real Ed Gein type of movie (Deranged, In the Light of the Moon, etc.) always has to mention it inspiring ""Psycho"", ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and ""The Silence of the Lambs"" (A book about Ed Gein uses the same marketing ploy)
MOTEL HELL is my favorite. Farmer Vincent owns Motel Hello (with the ""O"" in ""Hello"" usually blinking on and off) with his sister Ida. Farmer Vincent has the best smoked meats around. But the secret of the great taste isn't in the meat, it is the meat. Actually, it's human meat that they take from their victims that are buried neck deep in a secret garden behind the motel...
What's so good about MOTEL HELL is the laughter. In one scene, a kinky couple rent a room and think that Vincent and Ida are into S&M. So they get their leather on and think that Vincent and Ida are going to have some good ol sex with them...the funniest bit is when they actually tell the victims to raise their hands, so they can put the rope around them and drug them. They willingly accept.

1729326,4,B000068TPD,"Another delectable double-feature tidbit from MGM, this DVD features two horror movies with cannibalistic themes: DERANGED (1974) and the cult classic MOTEL HELL (1980).
DERANGED:
There are several movies whose writers claim that the films were inspired by the notorious Wisconsin necrophiliac and purported cannibal Edward Gein--PSYCHO (1960), THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE (1974),  and THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS (1991), to name a few--but only DERANGED comes close to reflecting Gein's grisly true-life activities.  For those who don't already know, Ed Gein was a backwoodsy Wisconsin farmer who, during the 1950s, raided cemeteries and collected various body parts from the corpses.  He is known to have made clothing and household items from the preserved skin and bones of his ""trophies,"" and it was reported that he also ate some of the flesh (though this was never substantiated).  Gein was caught and arrested in 1957 after actually killing the proprietor of a hardware store, then taking her body to his barn and preparing it in the manner of a hunter dressing a deer.
In DERANGED, the primary character is named Ezra Cobb, and though a lot of the real-life necrophilic and cannibalistic acts have been toned down for the script, Cobb is still a fairly accurate reflection of Edward Gein.  To make these ghoulish themes a little more palatable, scriptwriter and co-director Alan Ormsby mixes in lots of gallows humor.  In addition, the over-the-top performance of award-winning character actor Roberts Blossom, as Ezra Cobb, adds some jocularity to the film, but never goes so far as to diminish the overall horror.
Like Tobe Hooper's THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, which was released the same year, DERANGED opens with an attempt to convince the audience that what they will soon see is the gospel truth.  But instead of having a mere voice-over and some scrolling transcript, DERANGED takes it a step further with a phony news anchor who introduces the film as if it were a docu-drama--a very effective device for getting the audience into the right mind-set.
If you like raw, true-to-life horror, or if you're interested in films that are inspired by grisly real-life crimes, you'll love DERANGED.  You'll also enjoy the film if you're the type of fan who likes his horror played tongue-in-cheek.  Non-genre fans may be a bit put off.

Farmer Vincent Smith and his loopy sister, Ida, are the proprietors of the Motel Hello (the last neon ""o"" is often burned out), next to which is a small meat-processing factory that they also own and operate.  The meat products they make and peddle are actually more popular than the Motel--and more lucrative.  Indeed, people come from all over the country to to satisfy their hankerin' for Farmer Vincent's meats.
Customers frequently comment on how the Smith's meats have a delicious but distinctly unique flavor, and they are always trying to pry the secret from Smith and Ida.  Is it the way they process it?  Is it some exotic seasoning?  Or is it the way they raise or butcher the animals?  Farmer Vincent says that he uses no preservatives, and it's the all-natural ingredients that make the meat taste soooo yummy.  But as a highway billboard declares, ""It takes ALL kinds of critters to make Farmer Vincent's fritters.""  An' when it says ALL, it ain't lyin'!  Under cover of night, Smith and his sister frequently shanghai society's undesirables as they are passing through town, and...well, that ain't just beef and pork in them fritters!
MOTEL HELL isn't just a horror film; it's also a dark comedy.  The plot is goofy but fun, and the dialogue is sometimes outrageous, yet certain scenes can really raise the hair on the back of the neck.  It's a mixture that works well here, and it's hard not to become engrossed.  Part of the reason it plays so well is, of course, the acting.  Veteran actor Rory Calhoun is perfectly cast as Farmer Vincent Smith, as his straight-faced delivery only adds to the hilarity of the script.  Sister Ida is played by Nancy Parsons, an award-winning character actor who has proven to be quite adept at both comedy and drama, having appeared on TV in soaps and shows like BARETTA and THE ROCKFORD FILES, and later in films like PORKYS (1982) and STEEL MAGNOLIAS (1989).  She does an outstanding job in MOTEL HELL, deftly making Ida's persona switch back and forth between an uproariously funny country hick and a downright terrifying murderer.
Throughout MOTEL HELL, there are several witty and playful nods to countless horror classics.  And alert viewers will be able to spot a few famous faces, including the late Wolfman Jack, a 1970s radio personality and former host TV's THE MIDNIGHT SPECIAL; John Ratzenberger, better known as Cliff the postman on TV's CHEERS; Elaine Joyce, former wife of the late Bobby Van who is currently married to playwright Neil Simon; Monique St. Pierre, German beauty who was the 1979 PLAYBOY Playmate of the Year; and the late Hollywood stuntman Everett Creach.
Horror fans and those who enjoy gallows humor will love MOTEL HELL, as will fans of the kinds of movies that used to show up on local late-night TV. Others, including those who don't appreciate the art of campy humor, may just think it's silly.",1069632000,19,5237,4.944127708095781

was worthy of a bag of popcorn. I will never look at cabbage
the same way again. It is not a good movie to watch alone.
I watched it alone the 4th time and I could not sleep at all
that night, but I also was having cramps so it could have been
the beans I had for supper. I just hope they don't make a movie
about me someday.",1066348800,3,387,3.5647058823529414
1729328,5,B000068TPD,"Deranged is a well filmed and well articulated classic. It shows great insight to a murderers mind. The acting is phenomenal. It doesn't use gore and cheap thrills to send one's heart racing. It relies on it's own terror. Afterall what is creepier than a necrophiliac. Ezra Cobb is a deeply troubled man which makes a deeply troubled story and a fascinating horror movie all in one. It is the perfect movie to turn out the lights grab a person you love and hold onto them tight, for if you don't who knows what might get you, this film is truly creepy, and made like a documentary which makes it feel so real. It is not a movie to watch alone.
Motel Hell is on the reverse side of the disc. It is a true dark comedy. I laughed throughout most of it. It somewhat reminded me of Rocky Horror. A bizzare place out in the middle of nowhere, and people constantly stranded, but the secret garden is the best part. The ending will leave you laughing. The acting is great. If they ever remade this movie i would love to star in it. It is that great. So watch Motel Hell you'll enjoy every moment of it. Especially if you love horror movies.",1055980800,3,1133,4.299065420560748
1729329,3,B000068TPD,"Definitely less light-hearted than most of the movies in the Midnite Movies series (though ""Motel Hell"" has its snicker-inducing moments), but a definite must-buy for fans of off-the-beaten-track, ""shocking"" horror films.  Watch 'em and wince.  Clean, widescreen prints seal the deal.",1041206400,3,284,5.902439024390244
1729330,4,B000068TPD,"With the Dreanged/Motel Hell DVD you get a good news/bad news scenario. The good news is; Deranged has finally found its widescreen way onto dvd. :) Bad news: You're stuck with Motel Hell on the other side. :(  Deranged is a low budget, very unsettling horror film based on the heinous real life crimes of Ed Gein. Of course, the folks at MGM left out at least one squimish seen of Ezzra Cobb scouping out a corpse's brains with an ice cream scoop. However, Deranged is not really a gore fest but, instead draws its disconcerting power (thanks to Robert Blossom's oscar caliber performance) from the fact that most of what transpires on screen happened in real life. In short Deranged rocks! Motel Hell on the other hand,is boring, hackneyed, cinematic rubbish. The title says ""it takes all kinds of critters to make farmer Vincent fritters."" Well, it takes all kinds of Antacids to make it through this hackneyed yawn-fest! The ""love"" interest between Farmer Vincent & the young girl is as contrived as anything you'll have the unfortunate experience to watch. Characters you couldn't care less about if you tried. I've seen more suspense generated in a Melissa Gilbert Lifetime Channel chick flick than Motel Hell. My recommendation; buy this dvd if for only Deranged. Watch Motel Hell if you suffer from insomnia.",1041206400,2,1316,4.875
