1832769,1,B00008AOUY,"Yeah, if you're a film student, you could see this movie for tips. But to see this movie for pleasure, DO NOT BUY IT! It was a total waste of money for me. The acting was horrible, I laughed through the whole movie. I wanted to fall asleep. People seem to like this movie for its ""gore humor"", but I think the director tried too hard with that. Maybe the movie was suppose to look like crap, and that's what makes it good. That factor didn't appeal at all to me. The movie has that horrible 80's horror movie feel, and that killed it at the very beginning. The tall skinny blonde, the main character, should have rehearsed being sadistic a little longer. I think I liked two of his killings, I must admit. Not bloody and gory enough, but it was good enough. This DVD is the DVD I hide in the back of my collection, its an embarassment.",1067731200,3,835,4.225
1832770,4,B00008AOUY,"With a movie like KILLING SPREE what some people have to realize is that it's not about the Hollywood ""look"" or great drama (whatever), but more about FUN. People who might want to berate this movie, I think, take watching movies far, far too seriously. Just enjoying it for its low budget and its bad acting (which works for these films, as in BRIDE OF FRANK) makes it worth while watching. The death scenes are pure and simple entertainment soaked in blood & guts. How can you honestly pass up on the opportunity to see as a guy who comes over to cut the grass is later buried by our protagonist--with only lawn man's head and hands left above the ground...a quick pass or two of the lawnmower and no more lawn guy. And how about the aged granny-type, irritatingly nosy woman who meets with the wrong end of a claw hammer? The only thing that I kinda didn't agree with was the movie's ending, in which the zombies of those Asbestos had murdered come back for him; although his suicide with a hacksaw across the neck was somewhat of a guilty pleasure to watch. Bottom line is this is not one for people who take themselves, life, or movies too seriously; but fans of Ed Woods type fare, where more often than not it's the not-great acting and the cheesy production values that are enjoyable to watch.",1047254400,2,1301,4.470588235294118
1832771,5,B00008AOUY,All I can say is THANK YOU! Andy Williams for the great review of the movie. It was a blast to do it and I hope there will be a sequel. Keep it going cause I've got alot more stuff to do!!!!!,997574400,4,191,3.5714285714285716
1832772,5,B00008AOUY,"Killing Spree is an example of quality for the B-Movie genre.  It is not  for everyone, but if you love down and dirty slasher flicks (and face it,  who doesn't) this movie will make you dance and slash at your set.  If  nothing else, the movie has Asbestos Felt in it.  Asbestos is the greatest  actor to ever hit the B-Movies.  He knows how to make them work and gives  his audience exactly what they want.  I don't have a definition for that,  but he does it better than anyone. He makes any movie worthwhile.  Buy it  and see it.  You will love it and want more.",965865600,4,566,4.168224299065421
1832773,4,B00008AOUY,"This is so bad it's great! This has plenty of gore and some of the funniest bad acting I've ever seen. The gory killings are very creative and original. Don't listen to all the big hollywood film fans say about  this,this is a MUST see for all b-movie fans!",960595200,,257,4.244897959183674
1832774,1,B00008AOUY,"Painfully cheap, brainless slasher flick from the person responsible ""Truth or Dare"" (also a cheap, no-brain slasher). Dude thinks his wife is boinking the neighbourhood so he starts dispatching folks in a  series of goofy methods. The video label claims the gore effects will  ""blow your mind"". Well, they blow alright. The acting ranges from  god-awful to inhuman and the irritating Radio Shack keyboard soundtrack  doesn't lessen the pain. Not even worth renting, let alone purchasing.",959558400,,488,5.381578947368421

7980983,5,B00008AOUY,"After viewing Killing Spree at least a dozen times I still cannot get enough of its skilled acting and great special fx. Killing Spree should be considered a cult classic and has many useful quotes such as ""I've just got to do something about these bills"" and ""Screw my wife, I screw drive your head!"" Asbestos Felt effortlessly pulls off the role of a paranoid lunatic, by making his wife quit her job then sending her to live with her mom so he doesn't have to worry about her or her safety you start to realize his delusions know no bounds, in order to understand his mind you must know somebody whom you can relate to the character he is playing. Killing Spree should be viewed and enjoyed by many :)",1523232000,,704,4.3816793893129775
7980984,5,B00008AOUY,"Tom Russo (Asbestos Felt) returns home from a hard day's work. Another dull evening is ruined, when Tom's jealousy gets the better of him. He suspects that his wife, Leeza (Courtney Lercara) is fooling around w/ his best friend, Ben (Raymond Carbone). When Tom finds apparent evidence in Leeza's diary to back up his suspicions, his jealousy turns into homicidal mania! Ben and his new girlfriend (not Leeza) soon find out just how crazy Tom is! Decapitation and death-by-dismembered-head-beating are the result! Obviously, Tom's delusional state isn't limited to these two. Sooo, when the electrician shows up in the diary, old Tom has fun retooling the ceiling fan, just for him! WHACK! As Tom continues to secretly read Leeza's diary, he learns that she's sleeping w/ every man she meets- The TV repairman, the delivery guy, the lawn guy, etc. Needless to say, they all meet their maker in gooshy fashion! KILLING SPREE (aka: I DANCE ON YOUR GRAVE: KILLING SPREE- 1987) is one of those impossibly cheap, unbelievably schlock-y, cinematic experiences that actually, miraculously works! Most of the credit must go to Asbestos Felt, who in addition to his fantastic, living-cartoon facial expressions, seems to be able to make his hair stand up at will! In a movie like this, the fact that a crew-member's hand is clearly visible during a murder scene, is an asset! It adds to the overall ambiance of movie-making malpractice! The fiendishly funny finale is pure, cheeeze-tacular, Gorehundt Shakespeare! Honestly, if the academy recognized films of this sort, this would win in every category! Just imagine, Oscar statues... w/ little screwdrivers in their noggins!... Yes, please!...",1521504000,,1684,5.194852941176471
7980985,4,B00008AOUY,"Another low budget joy, this spotlights the talents of the obscure oddity, Asbestos Felt. Yes, with a name like that, you know you are in for some real entertainment. This Slasher turned Zombie movie showcases bearable acting and effects, and a good storyline. Decently original independent horror cinema.",1477526400,,305,5.375
7980986,5,B00008AOUY,Read the plot I can tell I'm in for a good time with this movie thanks,1464825600,,70,3.4375
7980987,3,B00008AOUY,"Not as bad as people may think, its a nice attempt with good amount of gore and pretty decent acting. I enjoyed this film I love the old vas look to it its really is a fun time capsule.",1429401600,,185,3.769230769230769
7980988,5,B00008AOUY,"While watching this, I was worried this was only going to be a ""guy kills people  because he thinks his wife is cheating on him and that's about it"" kind of film.  The last quarter of the film really caught me by complete surprise.  I mean, it turned into an AWESOME flick.  Fun kills too.

If you haven't seen this, give it a shot.  Great old school stuff for those into classic '80's video fare.",1422403200,,397,4.226666666666667
7980989,1,B00008AOUY,"Tom (Asbestos Felt) has an over active imagination when it comes to his wife Leeza (Courtney Lercara). He imagines she is having an affair with every man she meets. His imagination is at work when the lighting has a red glow. Tom kills all these men. Then the ending becomes so over the top, you think it wasn't the same boring him.

The acting, camera, and sound were all horrible. It is the type of film I was surprised by the fact I didn't see the microphone hanging down in every scene. Not the best VHS transfer either. I recommend avoiding this film, even for camp value.

I don't recall any f-bombs. Shower scene without nudity- in fact you catch a glimpse of Leeza' top and the guy's underwear.",1389052800,,702,4.434108527131783
7980990,5,B00008AOUY,"This movie is a classic campy horror flick. So bad it's funny! Lousy, low-budget horror movies have a special place in my heart, and this one is definitely a winner!",1358553600,,165,4.533333333333333
7980991,5,B00008AOUY,"If you call yourself a fan of the Horror genre, than you already know it's wise not to ignore low-budget films, regardless.  Especially a horror film that comes from Tim Ritter!  Again, don't put a limit to horror flicks; go 'all out' and watch as many as you can, when there's spare time of course.  I've got a long way to go with learning my 'horror history' but it sure is fun to find out who got their start and how their talent has evolved since then while in the process!  You'll find out about the actors/actresses and make-up artists that you've enjoyed by seeing their hard work from big-budget films that got their start from such films as this one!  Don't be so quick to judge.  I bet if you helped out with making a film like this, you'd tell everyone that this was one of the best times of your life haha!  Until that glorious day happens, don't be such a hard*** when judging films LOL!  True, everyone has different taste in horror, but those of you who put down such flicks like this one, I will never understand as a horror fan, how you could not look past certain flaws in 'Killing Spree' (or any other horror film for that matter), and not find its charm???  It's got over-the-top, silly, Troma Entertainment style gore!!!  The special effects is done by Joel Harlow who later worked on  'Basket Case 2', some 'Toxic Avenger' sequels, and 'Jurassic Park'.  Cool to know huh!?  It's fun to 'connect the dots' to some of these people when learning about the Horror genre!  Sure, the story is a simple, run-of-the-mill, 80's slasher film.  Get over it and enjoy it for what it is!!!  Besides enjoying some original, creative kills,(the 'ceiling fan kill' being my favorite!), I loved Asbetos Felt's 'over-the-top' acting!  I have the Sub Rosa Retro DVD edition and I find it to be really great!  It has a ton of bonus features which I enjoyed!  After viewing it, I plan on buying 'Truth or Dare' soon!!!  At the end of a b movie review, I'd be guilty of jotting down ""for fans of b horror only"", but I won't be putting that down in any future reviews I do anymore.  Check it out regardless and learn some horror history!!!  Can't you tell I just watched this LOL!",1263081600,2,2179,4.44949494949495
