7936133,5,B00005AYDB,Awesome dvd if your into DBZ its a must have. Dragonball Z is to me still the best anime out there and will be for a long time to come.,1318896000,,135,3.533333333333333
7936134,5,B00005AYDB,"This was one of the first Dragonball Z DVDs I bought, and I was very impressed. The Androids Saga climaxes here, when Trunks, Vegeta, Krillin, Piccolo, and Tien discover Dr. Gero's lab. Goku, who fell ill in previous episodes, was taken back home by Yamcha. Dr. Gero activates Androids 17 and 18, who proceed to kill Gero and activate the giant Android 16. The Androids fly off to a mountainside roadway, where Vegata challenges Android 18 to a fight and gets a little more than he bargoned for...

Everything about this DVD is great. The sound quality and picture image are very good, and the episodes are 3 of the best in the series. Of course, it's best to see the earlier Android Saga episodes, but then watch this DVD. It's very entertaining.",1149638400,,747,4.616541353383458
7936135,5,B00005AYDB,My son wanted this DVD because his favorite character in the Dragon Ball Z series is Android 17. He was not disappointed. Great DVD if you like the androids. It's a good add to your Dragon Ball Z collection.,1124150400,2,207,4.333333333333333
7936136,5,B00005AYDB,This video is very well done and if you have seen the first two Android videos you will love this,967507200,2,97,3.9
7936137,5,B00005AYDB,"This was by far the greatest cast of villians in any story ever, except for Freiza of course. #17 & #18 are so cool and then you got that #16  guy and man you know when you see this movie you're gonna say what the heck  these  guy's are to cool to be real well no duh their Androids! And their  the coolest charecters ever! Really, I mean you know #16 was really cool in  the fact that he never really wanted to hurt anybody he just was programed  to destroy Gokou he really didn't want to but oh well I don't care if your a  hardcore fan or just a  casual one you'll love it!",967075200,,576,3.9051724137931036
7936138,5,B00005AYDB,"I have viewed these 3 episodes in Japanese & I must say that they are quite entertaining. The tape starts off where the Z Fighters are in search  of Android 20(Dr. Gero) & his hidden lab that contains more androids. In  this episode I believe, Krillin has an encounter in the mountains with  Dr. Gero that you don't want to miss! After recovering with a senzu bean,  Krillin follows Dr. Gero to the lab. This is where the other androids he  spoke of are activated. The Z Fighters meet at the lab to destroy the  androids by blowing up the lab, but Vegeta wants to fight them instead.  Insisde, Dr. Gero has an encounter with the androids that Trunks spoke of.  Knowing of what may happen, Trunks attempts to blow up the lab. In the last  episode, Android 18 takes on an over-confident Vegeta in my all-time  favorite battle. It is my favorite because it takes place on a crowded  highway, after viewing this battle you'll know why I like it so much.",965779200,,949,4.427745664739884
7936139,5,B00005AYDB,"I myself have seen these episodes but w/ japanese voices and english subtitles. The battle between Android 18, the girl, and Vegeta is awesome as Vegeta recently became a Super Saiya-jin. I know Dragon Ball Z fans will  enjoy this tape w/ its 3 episodes. It is a must have! It starts the  beginning of the Cell Saga.  Enjoy!",964742400,5,324,4.4576271186440675
