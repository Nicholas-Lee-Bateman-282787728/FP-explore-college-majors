But I didn't give it a 5-star because half of the time was spent on history(showing reproduction of old B&W prints, etc) and interviews, which for me it's unnecessary information. The other half are beautiful video cam of the fall, from all angles, etc.

Only wish all 50 minutes were video cam.",1235520000,,449,4.743589743589744
8181715,5,B000NVL7F8,"I'm a tour operator and this DVD provided an excellent overview of Niagara Falls which helped me prepare for my recent visit. Typically I'm quite bored by documentaries, but this DVD held my interest. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to play the DVD on the motorcoach due to a technical problem.  Had I been able to show it, however, I know that it would have been of great interest to my customers.",1218153600,,395,4.563380281690141
