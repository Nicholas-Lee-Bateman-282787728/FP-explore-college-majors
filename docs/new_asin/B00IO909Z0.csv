6283597,5,B00IO909Z0,"I enjoyed the novel Battle Cry many years ago, so when I saw the movie on TV I enjoyed it very much.  The story gives incite into those who sacrificed for our freedom in WW2 from a personal and military viewpoint.  It was the first time I became aware of the ""Windtalkers"" and their contribution.

The Battle of the Bulge is a story we should never forget because of the bravery and determination of those who took part.  This movie is a reminder of those brave soldiers.  My father was with Patton's 4th Armoured Division and an uncle was one of those trapped at Bastogne.

Owning these dvds gives me the opportunity to watch when they are not scheduled on tv.",1415491200,4,661,4.421487603305785
6283598,5,B00IO909Z0,"It is surprising how a sprawling war film like this contains so little action. But, don't be disappointed. BATTLE CRY focuses on characterization and characters are plentiful be they ever so stereotypical. James Whitmore as Sgt. Mac, Aldo Ray, Tab Hunter, L. Q. Jones and Perry Lopez as Marine recruits and Dorothy Malone, Anne Francis and Nancy Olsen as their love interests all give standout performances. Max Steiner's patriotic and rousing score is in its full glory. This film is high on good old-fashioned sentimental entertainment. By the film's end the viewer comes to realize many of the sacrifices that were made during this time in history and some of the gloss wears off. As an aside, a deceased acquaintance of mine who served in the US Army 1st Division during the Second World War from North Africa, D-Day to Germany's surrender, found this film to be the best representation of W.W.II military life. That was an exceptional compliment and recommendation for this film from a veteran who was not a Marine and one who fought in the European theater. This is a good film.

Director Ken Annakin's single lens Cinerama epic is a condensation of time, characters and events of the real last ditch W.W.II German offensive. Though not historically accurate BATTLE OF THE BULGE looks back to the glory days of Warner Brothers' BATTLE CRY for inspiration. It did manage to find scope and it does not fail to entertain. Robert Shaw is excellent as the determined Nazi tank division commander Colonel Hessler. But the real standout performance is given by the long forgotten veteran actor George Montgomery as the seasoned American Sergeant who takes the green Lieutenant (James McArthur) under his wing. It also stars Henry Fonda, Robert Ryan, Telly Savalas, Dana Andrews, Charles Bronson, Ty Hardin, Pier Angeli, Barbara Werle, Hans Christian Blech and Werner Peters. Cinematographer Jack Hildyard and aerial photographer Jack Willoughby were in charge of the sweeping and panoramic photography.",1414713600,3,2001,5.1192660550458715

8643888,5,B00IO909Z0,"Great WWII film about the Battle of the Bulge, which was the battle of the Germans coming down upon the Americans in their quest for world domination and obtaining fuel in order to do so. All the cast does a fine job here in bringing the characters to life. Henry Fonda and Robert Shaw do outstanding jobs and the lead foes. The audio and video are balanced and consistent throughout the film. The action is non-stop and does keep you on the edge of your seat wondering what is going to happen next.
Overall, this is a great WWII film to add to your classic or WWII film collection.",1480032000,,582,4.348623853211009
