1104617,3,6305973245,"This movie is one of those flicks that might come on late night TV when there's nothing else on. Cusack and Robbins show flashes of their future abilities, but the movie's limited script hold them back. I would recommend this movie to fans of Robbins and Cusack, but not anybody else. It's interesting to see them in this kind of '80s spoof, considering their later body of work.

Sam Moore and Junior Walker pair up as the  fictitious band ""The Swanky Modes"" adding a number of very  soulful tunes to the soundtrack. To quote Josh & Ivan in the movie  ""We love the Swanky Modes.""",968544000,13,436,4.837837837837838

Roscoe was played by King Cotton, a portly,  snowy-haired, senior citizen, white guy rapper who appeared (very) briefly  in the 80's. You have to see it to believe it. I bought the soundtrack  because of this song.
What there is of a storyline doesn't make much  sense, but that's half the fun. Josh (Tim Robbins) is an aspiring  moviemaker who has talent, but no ambition. His friend, Ivan (John Cusack)  has PLENTY of ambition. After they lose their jobs as security guards, they  decide to go into business for themselves. Unfortunately, their paying gigs  are for funerals, and the only creative work they can find is ""on  spec.""
Josh and Ivan idolize an old, out of work R&B duo, the  Swanky Modes. When Josh and Ivan meet the Swanky Modes in a bar, they  realize it's their golden opportunity. They just have to get the Swanky  Modes back on stage...
One of my favorite scenes is in the bar, when  they ask for another drink. The bartender intends to cut them off, and  tells them they can't have another unless they can recite the alphabet  backwards, with one eye covered, and in sign language. They get their  drinks.

At one point, he accidentally sets himself on fire while sipping drinks, and he later receives fellatio in a cemetery. It's that kind of movie. The plot doesn't matter. Only the gags do. They come so fast that you might need to watch this one twice. Made in 1988, Tapeheads seems to mock the excess of the 80s by being extremely excessive. It's not as funny as something like Airplane!, but it has the same manic energy and goofy confidence. Clearly, it's not for all tastes. Reviewers commonly cop-out and say that a movie is ""X meets Y"" (i.e., Kill Bill is Fist Full of Dollars meets Enter the Dragon, or some such). Allow me a similar cop-out. This movie is something like the Blues Brothers meets Weird Al Yankovich (who makes an appearance here if you can believe it). Tapeheads's problem, however, might not be a lack of orginality, but too much (to lift a line from Sunset Boulevard). As Johnny would say, this is ""weird, wild stuff.""",1145577600,3,1216,4.6342592592592595

The cast, the music, the dialogue and everything else about this film is totally turbular (... yes, even though I am from New York AND the 80s are over, I still talk like a Valley Boy...)! Some of the funniest scenes in the movie are how Josh and Ivan's music videos are taken directly from videos that we have all seen on MTV (when there was still ""M"" in MTV). My personal favourite was their tribute to Duran Duran's video ""Is There Something I Should Know?"" The whole video is in black and white and then a small child throws a ball that is in colour (orange). I gave a happy sigh when I saw that scene. Anyway, that's all Pat has to say in this review. Right now, I am jonesing for some Vanilla Quik so, I must away. Ciaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaao!

1104952,4,6305973245,"What is ""funny"" to one person may or may not be funny to another.
If you're expecting non-stop, slap-stick hijinks ala Jim Carrey - you will be extremely disappointed.
This is a lot of subtle, dead-pan, insider humor - most of it requires some knowledge of the music industry, as others have said. I *do* find the film to be very funny - for me, it was one of those movies that you watched with a buddy, and then go around and incorporate lines from it for several years to come - actually, we still do.
It works from the aspect of being a buddy movie - two better ""buddy"" characters, in terms of believabilty, you'd be hard pressed to find. It also works as a film that creates this absolutely ridiculous world for these characters to live in - yet they generally accept that that's just the way things are - though there's a great scene where the characters look at the camera, as if to acknowledge the absolutely ludicrous nature of the situation to the viewer. Again - that's funny, to me.
As for the actual jokes, it's not going to be a movie that makes you shoot milk out of your nose - well, there are some parts that might - but it's still ""funny"" nonetheless. The characters are wonderful, the cameos are great, the writing and dialogue are sharp as a tack, and the performances are truly great from the entire cast - even down to the burned out rocker at the Menudo concert.
And the commentary track on the DVD was entertaining to me. It did explain most of what they were going for - most of which I got... though some of the stories about the set design were quite amusing, and had escaped me.
Then again, if you need a joke explained to you, is it funny?
Bottom line: A fun little indie-type film that remains subtle even while drowning in a sea of absolute nonsense.
Best advice: Go rent it first, if you're on the fence. If you like it, then I'd buy it.",1063497600,7,1868,4.309659090909091

1104958,1,6305973245,"I know everyone who said this is their favorite movie is going to get all upset, but I'd just like to say that I really tried to like this movie and just couldn't.  My boyfriend and I spotted it in the video store, I remembered that it had come up as one of my recommendations on Amazon and that all the customer reviews seemed to be really enthusiastic, so we rented it and....well.... we weren't going to finish watching it, but we kind of felt obligated to since we'd just spent a buck fifty and already invested forty-five minutes of our lives in this thing.
So this is just a warning to other potential viewers who may be like me.  I like comedies.  I really like the '80s.  I love '80s music.  I'm just about the right age to get all the MTV jokes and recognize all the cameos (go Jello!).  I like Tim Robbins.  But this movie made me feel like I was just not the target audience...maybe if I had fewer brain cells....maybe if I were stoned...  We giggled a couple of times, but it wasn't really the ""Gosh, that was funny"" kind of giggling, more the ""That was supposed to be funny, I guess...hee hee?"" kind.  Or the, ""I'm really trying to find this funny but I'm sort of cringing because the humor is so flat, the dialogue is so bad, the production quality is so terrible, and the things that are supposed to be farcical aren't successfully delineated from the things that are supposed to be deadpan (i.e., the ninja girlfight scene, which is so random and so painfully SUPPOSED to be funny that I actually felt kind of embarassed for the filmmakers).
I came away from this movie feeling, well, an hour and a half older than I was when it started.  And pretty depressed about not being able to enjoy what is clearly a high-ranking comedy to a bunch of people.  If your standards for comedy are anything like mine (timing, intelligence, set-up, situation, language) you will probably feel like a big humorless dork like me.  And if you grew up in LA like I did, you will also be kind of mystified that the concept of Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles (which is a real place, kids) is so darn funny that it's supposed to singlehandedly support 20 minutes of, er, comedy.
But if you're looking for a reminder that sometimes movies you pick up randomly in the video store turn out to be wonderful little treasures, and sometimes they really stink, then you will probably get as much out of this movie as I did.",991267200,10,2407,4.420814479638009

We thought we might take advantage of the situation to pursue other activities... but then we ended up laughing so hard that we couldn't posssibly do anything else.
The movie makes fun of the video industry, and part of the charm of this movie is the part where Cusak and Robbins go out to make cheap videos for third rate bands.  I guess the writers really had fun in deliberately trying to create horrible songs.  The whole movie is cheaply made, but the creators know it, and they take full advantage of it by making cheap fun of everything in the way.

It is visually pleasing, the soundtrack is excellent and John Cusack and Tim Robbins let you truly believe that two underachieving losers can make it big in the video music industry.
The comical scenes are so numerous that they can't all be mentioned.  Tapeheads takes potshots at rent-a-cops, heavy metal groupies, oversexed (and corrupt) politicians and Mexican boy bands just to name a few.  The scenes with the rappin' grandfather named ""Roscoe"" (who is a cross between ""the Colonel"" and ""Waffle House"") are the icing on the cake.
