2113786,3,B0002PYQD0,"The DVD is wonderful with a few exceptions. During the learning sections of the routines, there is not enough detail on proper form when doing movements. Especially the first 2 routines.  I'm fortunate enough to have a DVD player that allows me to play everything in 2-3 different speeds of slow motion so i can attempt to see detail stuff, but that takes working the remote as much as the form if not more.

The forms are broken down into sections which is very good, however for individuals to truly learn them properly it's important that their posture, hands, fist, stances, movements (circular or angular)be addressed with some level of detail. There's nothing explained about what you're doing, i.e when using mantis hand, single whip,etc...  I only make this comment because the DVD is marketed to actually teach or train you in developing the forms/routines.

Gong Li was one of 2 forms that I learned over 15-20 years ago and forgot because I stop practicing after about 9 months. With a rekindled interest to get back into the MA I purchased the DVD because it mentioned Gong LI specifically as a routine and was elated to know I could learn the form again. I deemed learning the routine again a kind of a re-entry point if you will to getting back involved. Well the student performing the routine obviously knows it but the preciseness of form structure appears to be lacking, he looks kind of out of control going through some of the motions. This is defintely a form that needs attention to detail when being taught, which is also lacking during the section breakdown of the routine.

While I'm glad I purchased the DVD, and I will make use of it, even slowing the remote to glean what I can for the Gong Li routine, individulas should know that learning the routines themselves will be a bit difficult unless you are already somewhat fimiliar with them or have a DVD with nice (slowmotion)features.

The 3rd routine seems to be given a bit different treatment where you can watch several students involved with the forms and the various sections, this is definitely more helpful visually when learning, although not a substitute for detail oriented training.

The DVD has some very insightful, useful application points about various moves within the forms which is good , also training excercises which are good also. Overall the DVD gets 3 stars when compared to other VCD's I've recently ordered which give more attention to detail like the Six Harmony Mantis Series and others. One last thing and this is incase the DVD creator is reading. Replace the drums with conversation about the routines when it's being performed. I for one who purchased it would find this more benficial when trying to become immersed in learning it. Especially since it's one of the few I have where engish is being spoken. With that said I have and will continue to enjoy the DVD. I consider it a good purchase with the exception of the aforementioned.

2113787,5,B0002PYQD0,"I started researching kung fu not because of the action movies but because of it's spiritual origins, since it was a Budhist monk who first taught the martial arts to the Shaoling monks who then compiled other forms and styles into a structured system. I was reading a lot about Krishnamurty (The Awakening of intelligence) and The Upanishads which are ancient Indian teachings that preceed Budhism, and I found it interesting how all these ideas have so much in common between themselves and with modern physics (quantum mechanics), and share a basic concept that we are part of the material world (atoms, quarks, strings) and in turn, the universe (a theory of everything see The Elegant Universe by Brian Green). This were we get the often joked about phrase

""being one with the universe"", and all it means is that through meditation or clearing one's mind from the mundane constant thoughts one can achieve a higher state of consciousness were a new awareness of us, and the world develops. This training video is excellent because Dr. Yang first explains the history and origins of kung fu, and then shows the sequences of movements at regular speed, slow speed, and also the actual combat aplications of each one. You get the complete package and, unlike attending a kung fu class where you have to strain to near exhaustion due to overly hard, warming excercices before getting to learning the actual movements, with this training dvd you can go at your own pace, alone or with a partner, and just go back as many time you need to see the movement again. I'm out of shape due years of office work, and when I tried joining a kung fu school, I just new it wasn't for me at least not until I could get into better shape, because I had no energy left after the usual warm up drill. Now I'm learning the movements using this dvd, and at my own pace, while I hit the track in the afternoon. There's no better kung fu training dvd out there, I should know, I've scoured the internet, and local martial arts stores everywhere. I will getting the white crane kung fu traing dvd also from Dr. Yang which enfasizes more hand movements with the Shaoling southern style.",1121817600,14,2166,4.640625
2113788,5,B0002PYQD0,"The Long Fist is a northern chinese kung fu style, and Dr. Yang's presentation sets the standard.  The Long Fist forms presented (Gung Li Chuan, Tan Tui, etc.) comprise a famous set of core forms from the Nanking Central Guoshu Institute from the 1920s (and represent a real authentic martial art designed by a committee :0 ).  In general, Long Fist styles form the backbone of many systems of gongfu in China, and so it really deserves to be studied.

Included with each of the forms is basic training (drills that break down particular hard spots in the form into simple easy to understand movements) and applications.  The large number of practical applications (including many Chin Na techniques) presented is simply amazing.

This is mainly a reference material, as Books and DVDs do not make good primary instructional material for martial arts, so plan on attending a seminar or finding a good local school to get the most from this DVD.",1105056000,19,944,4.838509316770186
2113789,5,B0002PYQD0,"Great! There's so much to learn from this DVD. The bonus material alone makes it worth the price. There are 4 classes with Dr. Yang included. In the first one he teaches the history of Shaolin Kung Fu, and explains how the greatest martial artists of the day were brought together in the early 1900's to preserve the arts of Shaolin Kung Fu after the temple was burned. Then there are classes where he explains the history and concept of each of these three basic sequences. There's also an extra YMAA stretching class before the first sequence.

The sequences themselves are amazing. Dr. Yang's teachers were very traditional, and the sequences are as close to their original form as you'll ever find. In fact, there's some archival footage of one of Dr. Yang's teachers practicing in Taiwan from the 60's. Nowadays, these sequences are often performed in a more dramatic, but less practical way, with no actual fighting capability. Usually, the martial applications are not understood or taught, but here there are over 70 primary and hidden fighting applications demonstrated.

I have read that when Dr. Yang took his YMAA team over to China to perform these sequences, they won the Gold, and the judges were shocked to see this old, authentic kung fu performed, instead of the usual flowery, modern Wushu that is so popular.

This will give anyone a solid foundation in Shaolin Kung Fu, and will help anyone that trains any style to understand the origin of their art.",1091059200,35,1472,4.833333333333333
2113790,4,B0002PYQD0,"Complements the book Shaolin Long Fist Kung Fu. This sequence builds on Yi Lu Mai Fu and Er Lu Mai Fu through the inclusion of several different kicks, side door attacks, and forcing techniques. Detailed instructions for practice will enable you to teach yourself",1027900800,,263,5.0
2113791,4,B0002PYQD0,"Xiao Hu Yan (spelled ""Shaw Fu Ien"" in the book Shaolin Long Fist Kung Fu) is a challenging and exciting sequence from the Shaolin Long Fist style of Gongfu (Kung Fu). Combining techniques from Long Fist and Northern Praying Mantis, Xiao Hu Yan emphasizes low stances, powerful kicks, leg sweeps, trapping, and striking. The tape contains the complete Xiao Hu Yan form, training routines, and martial applications for every move. The form is also divided into four sections to help you master every technique.
Whether for competition or your own practice, Xiao Hu Yan is great for training. It develops speed, strength, and timing. It makes a challenging addition to any martial arts training program. This videotape complements the book Shaolin Long Fist Kung Fu, by Dr. Yang, Jwing-Ming and Jeffery A. Bolt.
A powerful sequence for practice or competition!
Includes martial applications for every move!
An exciting addition to your martial arts collection!",1027900800,2,957,5.220779220779221

8030459,5,B0002PYQD0,"This is one of if not the best Kung Fu training videos out there. Anything by Dr. Yang Jwing Ming is worth having if your a avid martial artist or kung fu practitioner. I have other kung fu instructional videos and none can compare to this one. Please note I recommend you steer clear of the martial art instructional videos sold by martialartsmart and in the Kung Fu Tai Chi magazine. they are all garbage and I was very disappointed with all of those. This product here I would recommend to anybody. Though you should also have books on the subject. I recommend Dr. Yang Jwing Mings book called Shaolin long fist to go along with this video. And always remember you cannot completely learn everything from a video . You need to be taught by a qualified instructer to know the fine details. But if you have no martial arts experience and read up onj it and watch this video and the exercises contained therein, you can learn kung fu from this. Though it would be hard to learn the forms with this video alone. The quality of the picture is alittle bit disappointing. Its not completely clear and alittle blurry. But that dosent take away from its value. I just think for such an expensive video they can at least make it in HD or have a clear picture. Still it gets 5 stars anyway.",1396396800,2,1282,4.413502109704641

8030461,1,B0002PYQD0,"When I bought this video I expected good clear instruction, that's not what it is. Basically this video is a review for the already practicing student. I have done martial arts for the past 20 years and simply can't follow along. Through the whole video I kept waiting to see an explanation that never came. All that you see is them run through the same thing at fast and super fast pace [even though they say its slow pace its not] rather then breaking it down step by step so someone can actually follow along they would rather just show it really fast again for no reason like that's going to help you learn. The moves are not very clearly done and I had trouble simply seeing what they were doing combined with frustration from moving way too fast, he should have showed a move and then explained it to the camera rather then doing it five times fast and never telling you what he is doing. This is the second video I bought from YMAA and I am so unhappy with both videos I will never buy YMAA stuff again.",1356134400,3,1010,4.293193717277487
8030462,5,B0002PYQD0,"The Shaolin Long First Kung Fu DVD is very professional made. I do not know Mr. Yang but
by the DVD and my self experience with Kung Fu as well as other martial arts workout I could
see a serious teacher whiling to give his best. I understand that any kind of body workout
should be totally learned by DVD`s and yes with a real teacher. For that I think this
DVD is very nice introduction, clear and for sure not for does whom never have done any
body workout. I recommend this DVD for those whom already know I little bit Kung Fu and have
self body consciousness.",1351987200,2,564,4.18348623853211

8030464,5,B0002PYQD0,Dr. Yang's books and videos should not need additional reviews. This is one of the best introductory books for beginners of Chinese Martial Arts.  One should not use this book as the only tool to learn martial arts.  Get yourself a real teacher. I would categorically say that instructors who are willing to use this book and related video as instructional materials probably are good instructors.,1232496000,,397,5.0
