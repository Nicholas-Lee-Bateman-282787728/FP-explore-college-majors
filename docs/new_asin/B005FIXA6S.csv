4681380,4,B005FIXA6S,"This film is a delightful and naturalistic look at two young men slowly and clumsily realizing that they are attracted to each other and have the beginnings of deep feelings for each other. The acting by the two leads is spot-on just right and the screenplay and direction are also very effective. This is a film with fascinating visuals and background. I learned allot about working on a farm - and it was interesting to me. There is an almost documentary style at work here in which the budding male-male romance fits in comfortably. American audiences expecting "" action "" and contrived plot or those from anywhere looking for sex and nudity are going to be disappointed. Everyone else should sit back and enjoy.",1324166400,9,715,4.774193548387097
4681381,4,B005FIXA6S,"Think socialist educational film on the joys of a government farmer training program, complete with earnest salt-of-the-earth agriculture instructors sporting haircuts so genuinely awful their 'do's actually achieve that ever ulta-elusive uber-hip of those who have found utter liberation from status-seeking.  Oh, yeah, there is plenty of mucking out stalls and bucking bails and all those authentic farm activities, but never the remotest suggestion of any West Hollywood fantasies about a roll in the hay.  Instead, slowly-as-watching-grass-grow, there develops a friendship so quiet and understated I had to keep rewinding because I thought I must have missed some crucial smoldering glances over the feed hopper or some such coded signal these two guys want each other.  Nope.  Yet, still, somehow the brokeback yearning seeps through, like, well a force of nature as relentless as the seasons. It's one of the odder films I've ever seen--such a deadpan absence of anything flashy, it may as well have been video verit--it absolutely succeeds without our lads so much as skinny dipping at the swimming hole.  Yes, it is in German, and unlikely to get ground through the farcical Hollywood ratings system.  But if it were, I feel certain it might well qualify as the first G-rated farming education and gay romance flick in the history of world cinema.",1324166400,71,1356,5.25462962962963
4681382,5,B005FIXA6S,"The movie is a story about two young farmer apprentices making a discovery of their sexuality, falling in love.  One of the two young men readily opens up to the possibility of the same sex relationship while the other takes time to reach self-acceptance. The production takes on the flavor of a ""home-made"" movie that at times feels like a documentary story, with interview-like acting, little music, and lots of background noises of the farm machinery, firmly grounding the story in realism.  I have enjoyed every moment of this movie.",1322438400,54,537,4.955555555555556
4681383,2,B005FIXA6S,I am a big fan of movies and always excited to watch any new GLBT movies.  I watched this movie with friends and it just kept going on and on and never went anywhere.  I began to get bored after a while and then when action finally began I was like where did that come from and the ending was not any better.  Don't waste your time or money on this.,1322352000,4,349,3.887323943661972
4681384,3,B005FIXA6S,"(( NOTE: 1/2-STAR added for high degree of location / setting authenticity which was captured ON FILM. Otherwise, Story...Acting...Camera Work are rated at 2 1/2-STARS ))

Described at many DVD sales sites as more of a Gay Romance and at Imdb.com as a Drama...neither description is ""mostly"" correct. For why, read on.

In the Director's words, this is a film he calls ""The Farm"" (perhaps being titled ""Harvest"" is more marketable for American distribution).  Also in Benjamin Cantu's own words, this is more a ""Documentary"" (at least, a semi-one), rather than a film falling completely in either of the 2 Genres mentioned above.  Now, in order for you to relate more easily to this film and its location, think of it as being a take off on our country's ""F""uture ""F""armers of ""A""merica.  ....BUT, here in this film, it is a story taking place on the far outskirts of Berlin, in an agricultural school established to intern / train the ""FFG"".  Note that farm life and activities are quite realistically portrayed, right down to the actual use of farm machinery and the handling of animals (this is a working farm).  Yes, there is a ""side story"" in which we are given scenes of the developing ""relationship"" between 2 young, male trainees (the only professional actors in this film; the many other persons you see being actual agricultural school students and their instructors).

As for my general impression of the storyline, I find it one which transports us into a deeply agricultural environment....BUT does so somewhat ""aimlessly"".  There are ""Shifts"" in plot directions and activies shown to us which seem to occur without meaning (aimlessness also exists within that ""personal relationship"" we are waiting to see develop).  Dialog, by the writer / director's own admission, is often unscripted or improvisational, and there is much reliance upon ""looks"" and ""glances"" to get a point....or a feeling across to us.

And as for what we are all waiting to see occur (due to the ""romantic sales pitch"" often given this movie), physical contact between the 2 leads is very slow in coming....and amounts to nothing other than upper body contact.  Kissing scenes are particularly mishandled, due to poor camera angles and even worse use of lighting.  Still, both of the Straight actors, playing characters, ""Marko and Jakob"", are fairly adept at portraying the qualms of ""coming out"" and facing up to a first affair.  Kai-Michael Mller, as ""Jakob"", is particularly able at expressing such feelings.  Lukas Steltner's ""Marko"", who we follow from film's beginning, is more stoic in nature (due likely to his character's more ""iffy"" family background).

At best, I see this as an ""intermittently Gay"" film, which I will NOT be keeping in my Film Library for this Genre.

4681428,5,B005FIXA6S,"Ok. So you know the story. But what makes this different from other gay themed films is obviously the setting of the farm school operations and slow development of attraction between the two apprentices. The long glances and yearning were only shown halfway thru the film and when it happens, it makes their love story much more believable and satisfying. Great natural acting by the leads throughout. I especially like the piano interludes which plays at the right moments.",1403740800,2,474,5.012658227848101
4681429,5,B005FIXA6S,"Never heard of this film before or read any of the reviews prior to watching it. Was just relaxing at home and thought why not give something new a try instead of re-watching an old favorite. Boy was I surprised and inspired! I usually like American movies because they tend to be optimistic and to end on a clear and happy note. By contrast, I find that most of the time European films, especially French ones, are pessimistic and end abruptly; leaving me with a sense of frustration and disappointment. Nonetheless, I decided to give this little known German movie a try and I found it to be a little masterpiece! I'm a huge fan of Marco Berger's ""Plan B"" and the highest compliment that I think I could give to any film is that it reminds me of that aforementioned great piece of cinematic art; ""Harvest"" does this precisely. Both are very slow (inviting and inducing a contemplative state) in showing the subtle development of sexual attraction, affection, and loving commitment between two men; who previously had no known same sex inclination or experience. Both are blessed with exceptional acting from their respective protagonists who enjoy undeniable chemistry. Both are imbued with remarkable passion though neither presents with gratuitous sexual activity. And both, needless to say, end on an unexpected but wonderful hope filled note. Suffice it to say that in the past week I've watched it twice and have just ordered the DVD. I want this movie in my permanent collection and I think most who watch it will feel similarly. So give yourself a treat and watch ""Plan B"" and """"Harvest""; both are awesome just don't watch them at the same time. Each is very intense and to get the most out of it you are going to need to watch it several times and allow it to slowly and subtlety alter your perspective on so many aspects of life.",1403481600,5,1840,4.69969040247678

4681432,5,B005FIXA6S,"I loved this movie.  It is two young gay men falling in love.  By the end of the movie, they both come to realize what they've found.  It's the love story that none of us - gay men - ever had when we were young.  It's the love story we should have had.  In its own, understated way, this movie is groundbreaking.  Not only do the two lads recognize what they've found in each other, but at the end of the movie, you are happy that they have found each other - and that they don't care whether anyone else knows either.  That's another important point.  Because every time two men fall in love, the rest of the world thinks it's their business, their domain.  It isn't.  Not only are these young men in love - and grasp the importance of that fact in the larger scheme of things - but we also understand at the end of the film that the future is theirs.  Thank you to the directors for not making this about sex, but rather about love, and for making a movie that reflects that men in love also won't let the world control our souls or lives any longer.  The latter point is secondary to the love story, but important nevertheless.  Love prevails - and nothing can stop it.  Makes me actually start to think that all of the activist work may not have been in vain after all.  We may never have had this for ourselves, but wasn't the whole point to make things better for young gay people coming after us?  And to the rest of you who reviewed this film and who just liked the love story (without the politics), my hat off to you as well.

Two good actors wasted their time - and ours - on a very subtle, disappointing and somewhat improvised script that left way too many unanswered questions. Randomly juxtapose that against what amounts to a lengthy and much less subtle documentary on German agricultural practices and the result teaches one a lot more about raising cows than it does about what the DVD's blurb called ""sweet gay romance.""

A little bit was touched about their lives but it was like the writer and director were too lazy to go into detail and you're expected to fill in the blanks for the whole movie.

While the very first scene made me wonder if it would be boring, I quickly found myself entranced by the world, both of farming and of the unfamiliar-to-me German apprenticeship structure. The story of the relationship takes a second viewing to fully appreciate because there is much that is left unsaid, but is rather illustrated in a puzzle of actions, expressions, gazes, and utterances. I call it a puzzle, but it is a well-designed one: after the second viewing, I understood things that had not been clear after just one. I was left with the impression that every decision had been carefully and very successfully crafted. The settings, the music, every action and expression, contributed to tell an important story. The end was completely unexpected, yet could not have been more perfect. Had I not been too engrossed to make predictions, I would have been afraid it would be either too big or too small, but I was perfectly satisfied, both intellectually and emotionally.",1339718400,7,1045,4.977142857142857
4681473,2,B005FIXA6S,A very boring film. The film almost feels like you are watching a documentary style film. The characters do not tell enough of a back story to draw the viewer into the film itself. Don't waste your money on this one. There is not much of a love story at all...it's just 2 aimless guys going to farming school and there is barely any interaction between any of the characters at all.

(as opposed to fake people you may well ask... yes well .... people who actually worked as interns on this German industrial farm school). The director uses sound and images to draw you, sometimes roughly, into the movie. The part that touched me the most, and is something that I will remember for sometime, is the ending.

4681478,5,B005FIXA6S,"The film meanders at a thoughtful, European pace; very organic, nothing feels forced or overacted. It feels like a video snippet of real life. Simply put, the story of two young people finding eachother under unusual circumstances and falling in love. The sprinkler scene was carefree and pensive, the character of Mrs. Butsch was motherly, kind and never scolding; their trip to Berlin was the culmination of their timid romance ultimately helping eachother achieve a life goal, one to drive, the other's fear of alcohol, and find eachother in the process. All things that could happen in everyday life under certain circumstances; American gay films have a way of feeling campy and contrived, always indignant. This film is simply saying attraction can happen anywhere to any two people, but especially when you're young and unsure, it all has a sheen to it. A delightful commentary on life, I'd certainly watch it again.",1331078400,9,923,5.078947368421052
4681479,1,B005FIXA6S,"I realize there is merit in the saying, ""different horses for different courses."" I am surprised however that several reviewers think so highly of this film, but it is certainly their right to.  For me, this is a plain feeble movie with no substance.  If you are a farmer, or aspire to be one, you will probably enjoy the many farming scenes, because the bulk of this movie is about farming and the administration of a farm.

The stop-start inability of the short haired character to respond to the other one's advances, was to me extremely frustrating.  I bought this movie, watched it once, and was very fortunate to have found another buyer for it almost immediately here on amazon.com.

There are a host of better gay-themed movies to watch in stead of ""Harvest""; e.g. Bully (not a completely gay movie) / David's Birthday / Is It Just Me? / Johns / La Mission (also not a completely gay movie) / Last Exit To Brooklyn (also not a completely gay movie) / L.I.E. (as in Long Island Express) / Like a Brother / Lillies / Priest / Shank / Shelter / Walk On Water / and the four top gay movies in my personal view: Brokeback Mountain / Yossi & Jagger / A Single Man / (& the incredible) From Beginning To End.",1330300800,5,1209,4.403587443946188

4681481,5,B005FIXA6S,"I loved this movie. The first time Jacob and Marko sit in the abandoned car is one of the most beautiful scenes I have ever seen in any movie, and they hardly say a word; it's all in their eyes and in the way they move. Kai Michael Mller (Jacob) is especially appealing, but both guys are excellent. This movie is far more sensual than movies with nudity and sex (Harvest has none of either).

I should give up trying to understand why other people don't like the same things I do. I can't imagine thinking this movie is slow or boring or dull. I watched it all the way through in one sitting because I simply couldn't break myself away from it. So much was happening that I didn't want to miss any of it. I've seen over a thousand movies in the past five years, and I could count on one hand the ones I've watched in one sitting.

There is no violence in it at all, and only the very briefest flash of hostility from a passing stranger. Nearly everything that happens happens within and between the two lead characters; and even when it is difficult (as it is most of the time for Marko) it is always tender, never violent.

4681482,4,B005FIXA6S,"Most of the so-called ""gay-themed"" love stories on film that I have seen have taken place primarily in urban areas with their usual meeting places and ""troubles"" that come with high-density locals. This low budgeted German (with, of course, sub-titles) film instead tells a very moving love story between two very ""clean-cut"" appearing young men that are learning to be farmers on a huge farm that mainly raises cattle.  The film lovingly shows how these two young men cope with their ""blossoming"" love while shoveling cow manure.

Mario has been a farm apprentice on the above mentioned huge farm for awhile always longing ""for something else"" to see and to do.  Enter into his life another young man with the desire to learn farming and having more knowledge of the world (i.e., he can drive) The two tentatively fall in love not really knowing how to handle it.  Their love story unfolds at a pace that, to me, is very reflective of their surroundings--no wild sex scenes, no wild parties, no  smoked filled bars with loud disco music are shown .  Just a very quiet ""coming together"",is reflected in this very fine film.  (In fact the movie has no sound tract or soundtrack)

We are not bothered with family dynamics; these characters are young adults away from home.  We do not have to absorb chatter that reveals motivation; we can infer their inner states from their interactions.  We do watch the two main characters move toward each other until courage takes them the last step, into each other's arms.  Beautifully shot, lovingly paced, affectively acted, movingly resolved.

That being said, The last 20 minutes of the film I had my mind made up: I did not like this film nor would I recommend it to anyone. However, the very last scene warmed by heart and made me reflect back over the whole movie. It has none of the sexual appeal of most modern movies and for that fact alone, it leaves a bittersweet taste in my mouth. I wanted more! Between peaceful scenes of farmland, background tractors rumbling away and lowing cattle, The interaction between the two main characters (Marco and Jakob) is awkward to say the least. My conclusion is that this is much more realistic than we all know. In fact, That's the one word that would describe this film the best: Realistic.
