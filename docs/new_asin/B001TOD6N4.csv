3792489,5,B001TOD6N4,"Kevin Bacon turns in a near perfect performance as a desk bound Lt. Colonel who volunteers to escort the remains of a fallen marine to Wyoming for burial.

It could be that the noble acts and behavior of all the people encountered by him in this story which consists solely of the trip from Iraq to Dubois is a bit unrealistic. But they are carried out so convincingly that one could believe in America again.",1235692800,6,409,4.453333333333333

3792492,5,B001TOD6N4,"i seen this movie a couple of days ago and this movie should be seen by all americans in the u.s. my last command was in somalia, and i've been shot at and had to do some shooting back. from men to little kids. the feeling that i had to do was in the best intrest of my country. i seen alot of marines wounded, but none has died. thanks to god! when i came back to the u.s. i had to do what the lt.col had to do. we had one officer and three enlisted men ( 2 ssgt's and 1 gysgt ) and i was one of them. all of are marines came back from somalia o.k. but we were givin instruction on how to do what the movie is all about. after seeing the movie, it broke my heart and had some tears. all should see this movie. when i retired from the marine corps, i had nightmares for about two years. i feel the same way that the lt.col felt. i should of died in battle with honors. i've always took care of my marines. my wife use to tell me that i'm crazy for volunteering for all the conflicts that the marines were in. hell, i was never home half the time. go to work at 5:00am and stay until 9:00pm. pt with the troops in the morning and so on! i apologize for telling the story of my life. i just get to carried away. the movie is well written and Kevin Bacon did a go job as a lt.col.
once a marine, always a marine! semper fi, devil dogs",1235606400,18,1331,3.8260869565217392
3792493,5,B001TOD6N4,"I viewed this film at a pre-screening, and I left the theater deeply moved. It's a simple story made into a heartfelt film -- Marine Lieutenant Colonel Michael Strobl (perfectly played by Kevin Bacon) accompanies the remains of Private First Class Chance Phelps from the mortuary at Dover AFB in Delaware to his home in Wyoming.

The Marine's death in Iraq occurs in the tense first minute of the film, with viewers only hearing the radio chatter and the explosion on a black screen. The screen comes to light with PFC Phelps' remains being sent to the U.S. The care of the remains and the personal effects makes visible and gives dignity to the anonymous work at Dover AFB.

The story takes the viewer into some seldom-seen corners of America -- from airport cargo facilities to the mountain highways of Wyoming -- and shows everywhere the reverence for the fallen. When the escort gives Phelps' watch, dog tags, and wooden cross to his parents, eight days after his death, even men will feel the tears coming. Finally, as LtCol Strobl (who had not yet been to Operation Iraqi Freedom when he accompanied Phelps' remains home) thinks over the experience, there's a meditation on where duty lies for a Marine Corps officer.

Director Ross Katz, Kevin Bacon, and HBO have given us a profound film that grants us a rare look not at America's prosperity, or freedoms, or politics -- but rather America's soul.

3792525,5,B001TOD6N4,"This movie really sets itself apart from the rest of the crazy political Hollywood climate. There is absolutely no ounce of politics in here whatsoever. It is about people who are proud of what they do for their country, and others who react to a fallen soldier who fought for their country. Normally, I watch movies thinking that it's a great story, and I move on. This is different this is over 95% factual (there are some artistic variations, like accommodations for the Minneapolis layover and the caravan), but the basic premise is there. I'm glad that with this movie, fallen soldier are getting the respect and honor they deserve, and the families are getting the closure they deserve.

No man left behind is not just a slogan or bravado and Kevin Bacon adds the role of a Marine Corp escort as one of his best performances to a long list of achievements. The movie got a little slow once or twice but the documentary side of this movie filled those gaps with the code of all who have been brothers in combat.  HONOR, LOVE OF COUNTRY, and RESPECT as displayed by the Honor Guard(s), mortuary services at Dover, fellow service members, and everyone who has witnessed the final chapter for a man or woman who gave their all for our way of life.

We owe much debt to the fallen and the survivors. I have family members who are survivors and a few who have past, or fallen in the military. If the U.S. did not get involved our society could be speaking German today. The negative reviewers 'shocking', but typical of ignorance. Kevin Bacon could not have more respectful in this role.

3792549,1,B001TOD6N4,"I'm sorry, Kevin Bacon. Your acting was top-notch and you played a very dignified character beautifully, but this movie was just pure propaganda at its most insidious. It takes the glorification and white-washing of war to new and disgusting heights. What's even worse is that this is based on the death of an actual soldier, someone who was suckered into signing up for a war that should have never happened. The flag folding, the saluting, the people on the road flashing lights when they see a soldier casket, the reverent guarding of a lifeless corpse in a box now called a hero just because hes dead and whom they certainly had no such regard for while alive... just nauseating.

I admit I did hold some small hope that Kevin Bacon's character would have some sort of epiphany at the end: that war was a completely disgusting, unnecessary racket only invented to make the rich richer and to get rid of the ""useless eaters"" gullible enough to sign up  but all hopes of that were smashed as flat as a tank rolling over an Iraqi child for being a terrorist.

Again, I apologize, Kevin Bacon, for giving this movie 1 star. You did a fine job... but you should have known this movie was only made to glorify something so evil: the Military Industrial Complex that kills everything in its path  not just people but the entire Web of Life all around the world.",1519862400,,1358,4.576131687242798

3792560,4,B001TOD6N4,"I really enjoyed the movie, even though it's really short.  It's an interesting look at the way our soldiers' remains are cared for and escorted back to their families.  The one aspect of the story I'd have like to bring out more is why this Lt Col in the Marine Corps wanted to escort the remains of a PFC home to start.  Throughout the movie, it's mentioned several times that such a high ranking officer escorting a PFC is unusual, but they don't counter balance that with a reason why he volunteers for the duty.  They do ALMOST explain it in one scene, but don't quite get there.

But it's a fantastic movie, and I completely disagree that this is patriotic propaganda.  I don't think anyone who's said that about the movie really understood the point of it.",1518912000,,763,4.492753623188406

I believe they did an accurate job portraying the honorable yet unpleasant side of one of the worst/best assignments in our military.  Kevin Bacon did an amazing job as a Marine officer.  He looked and acted the part.  Guess he still remembers some stuff from ""A Few Good Men""  I would recommend this movie to any and all. It brought a few tears to this Marine's eyes.

The whole time I was reminded of my first brother-in-law who was killed in the Vietnam war when I was a teenager.  And how things might have been done in a similar fashion then when he was sent home.
This movie is very detailed but also very respectful.  It shows so much of the process of preparing and transporting remains back to the family..
I can't say anything negative at all.  A wonderful movie. I would highly recommend it. Just be prepared with a box of Kleenex nearby.",1517702400,,620,4.273504273504273

It was a lot slower than typical military movies, yet it was perfectly done. To watch how much an effect a fallen hero can have on total strangers is really tear jerking but honestly true.

If you've ever been to the Vietnam War Memorial  - the Wall - in Washington DC and read individual names and felt the enormity of the loss, this movie succeeds in taking one name of a young soldier lost in Iraq and dramatizing the profound impact that even one soldier not known to the many he passes on his final journey home or to his escort has on a nation and demonstrates the depth of loss to those who knew him.

Makes you think that some airline passengers since the movie came out have actually disrespected the remains of a fallen service member, the escort, and family members for being inconvenienced for having to wait an extra few minutes for them to disembark the plane???  What is wrong with our country when you can't wait 5 minutes for someone who gave everything they had for our country!

They were wracked with sobs and tears for the whole duration? I don't get it. It was an ok movie, and a bit sad, but ultimately just another propaganda movie. If you're into that, go for it. This movie kept reminding me how stupid and pointless the Iraq War was, and how infuriating it was that a bunch of rich politicians sent the lower classes off to die or be maimed for their own gain.

Twelve Years A Slave, and now this one. This movie was so beyond beautifully written and acted. It was so poignant and touching, that at times I had to stop the movie just to catch my breath from sobbing so hard. Out of the hundreds of roles Kevin Bacon has played, from this point forward, I will always remember him for this one. I thank Chance's family for the sacrifice of their son and for granting permission for this to be released to the world. I will never forget their son or the sacrifice he made. I will never forget this movie, just thinking of it brings tears to my eyes.

3792736,5,B001TOD6N4,"During the Oct 2017 ""world Series"" off nights I chose to see a movie on one of the TV movie channels. It was starring Kevin Bacon and titled ""Taking Chance"".
It's title didn't sound like I was really going to enjoy it very much, but WOW,  was I in for a real heartfelt surprise.  Based on the true experiences of U S Marine, Lt. Colonel Michael Strobl, who wrote eloquently of them in a widely circulated 2004 article.
Taking Chance is a profoundly emotional look at the military rituals taken to honor its war dead, as represented by a fallen Marine killed in Iraq, Lance Corporal Chance Phelps.
Working as a strategic analyst at Marine Corps Base Quantico in VA, Marine Corps Lt. Col. Strobl [Kevin Bacon] learns that Phelps had once lived in his hometown, and volunteers to escort the body to its final resting place in Wyoming  When the movie started, it was at the Dover AFB where there were a several Flag Draped Coffins, ready to be escorted to other locations for final interment, as he proceeds across the country. What happens during this movie will really touch your heart. I know how I felt. You gotta see this movie.
I don't mean to be political, but, This movie should be REQUIRED  VIEWING for all the NFL and the like.

3792744,5,B001TOD6N4,"Wanting to learn more about our nation's military Gold Star families, I discovered this HBO film. Although it is not critically acclaimed, it is a most honorable film based upon true events. This very real portrayal of the Marine Colonel who volunteered to escort 19 year-old PFC Chance Phelps from Dover AFB to his final resting place is an emotional journey. Each military person who was ""performing their job"" was portrayed as doing so to uphold the greatest dignity in getting Chance home to his family. The movie is a screenplay based on the diary kept by his military escort with dialog from his buddy in his Marine unit when he was killed in action, and including family, friends and loved ones. Kevin Bacon was wonderfully cast as the Marine Colonel who felt it was his duty to step up and be involved in the Iraq war given he was chasing his own demons by not seeing battle in the Middle East, but wanting to stay safe with his family. Be prepared to be in tears from the opening scene through the final destination. Each person along the way who encountered the military escort and the movement of the PFC's remains in his flag-draped casket was deeply touched and responded with respect and grace. It is especially clear how each person felt it was an honor to help this young war hero who sacrificed himself to save his fellow Marines, find his way home with all of the nation's thankfulness and dignity he so deserved. My father served in the Navy during WW II, and my husband served as a Navy Flight surgeon during the Vietnam war, who continues to serve as a Veterans Affair Hospital physician with over 55 years of service. I couldn't be prouder, yet I am so sad being reminded of the countless men and women who have served our country and lost their lives.
Those who made the ultimate sacrifice are our true heroes of freedom.

Serving as a pastor, I escort those whom have passed quite often and it is especially difficult when people have died younger in life. I have been a part of saying good-bye to veterans in their older age and I am struck by the respect given at funerals, I have helped organize even, of those in the service who tend to saluting, offering the flag to the wife, and the gun salute. What I was not privy to, though I could be if I ever have to face the funeral of an active duty member, is what happens with the soldier on his or her way home. What is most moving about this film is trying to put myself in the shoes of the mother of this young man as I have a daughter six months away from her term to conclude in the National Guard, and a son who went from 6 years in the Guard to re-upping just recently to the Air Guard. I pray I never have to know the agony of the loss of a young person from any of my congregations, and certainly my own children. My only hope if I have to bear such a horrible reality is that respect and honor is given to those whom I love, (such as portrayed in this movie), whom I adore, who serve our nation.

3792792,5,B001TOD6N4,"This young man's story, as shown from the beginning of his journey home from war after his death, is both heartbreaking, tragic and sad. However, over the course of that journey, we see the WHOLE picture like nothing before that's been told or seen. They give us just enough to know hI s death wasn't wasn't pretty, but all too often, real and how they handle those circumstances. From beginning to end the process is dealt with the deepest respect and honor for the loss of that young man and all the others before and after. It also educated everyone surrounding the transporting of his body home. Civilians, unknowing of the process, were educated by Kevin Bacon's amazing character depiction, on how the body is treated during transport. He never had to say a word,,,he showed by his actions. I truly believe this movie was Kevin's best work to date! Upon reaching his destination home, Chance is where he should be.  Bacon, as ever, is humble but gets to know some friends of Chance's the night before the funeral, unwittingly a part of knowing the soldier he's just brought all the way home. There! We see the man, not the soldier then. Now he knows Chance. Coming from a military family with members having gone to war, I related also, but I made it until the end. Anyone who makes it to the end will understand...you will lose it then when reality hits home. A beautiful but tragic story of a young soldier.

Much worthy attention is given that honorable escort, as well.  Bacons acting is impressive.

I loved the loving care that the bodies received every step of the way home. I loved that they took the time to treat those who were too injured for an open casket exactly the way they treated those with less gruesome injuries. I loved that they had a brother or sister with them all the way home too. This was an education in military protocol. Then there was Kevin Bacon. I have to admit up front that I am a huge fan...but wow...a tear filled eye on Mr. Bacon will rip your heart right out. I think I started crying about 2 minutes in when I saw the plane full of flag draped coffins. This movie did not get a lot of press coverage (or I did not see it) but it is so worth buying and sharing with family and friends. It is a movie that needs to be seen and talked about and Kevin Bacon deserves an Oscar. 5000 stellar reviews can't be wrong.",1502323200,,1010,4.131979695431472

Kevin Bacon's performance was worthy of an Oscar. This one movie would make any serious actor's career a worthy memory. His humanity, heartfelt pain, Marine pride and his sadness brought tears to my eyes and a tightness to my chest. Anyone who sees this movie will understand the sacrifice of service.

And although I never had the privilege, since I was born with a disability that precluded my ability to serve, my heart, no, my soul, has always identified with those that have served.  If I could have served, I would have.  Regardless of political beliefs, trends, or opinions, everyone should watch this film.  Not to prompt or glorify conflict, but to see what honor is, if nothing more, to acknowledge the loss and sacrifice, and debt we all owe to those that fall in the line of duty.

And in addition to that this is based on the real life experience of the Major makes it even more remarkable.
I am not a big fan on Kevin Bacon; he's done good work over the years - but this one sticks out in my memory more than others.

In describing it to a friend the other day, I remarked that even though there wasn't any ""action"" at all, I was glued to the screen the entire time.  The actors and actresses (especially Kevin Bacon) are so believable that it is easy to share in the emotions involved in taking PFC Chance home.  I was previously ignorant of all the details involved in bringing a fallen soldier from the field of battle to his or her final resting place.

3792939,5,B001TOD6N4,"""Taking Chance"" is, quite simply, a brilliant movie.

It's not pro-war.
Not anti-war.

It's 'pro military' to the extent that the movie shows the seriousness with which ""The Military"" takes the act of taking soldiers killed in action to their final resting place.

The way the military is presented may inform the larger questions about whether we should be sending soldiers like Chance into combat, but that's not the point of this movie. It's a calm, measured film.

The film engrosses you in every step of the journey as though you were actually there, and leaves you transfixed to every scene. Even though there is little action during what seems like a regular journey by plane and car, the underlying emotions are powerful and gripping to an unexpected degree.

3792946,5,B001TOD6N4,"Excellent film. To paraphrase what Pvt. Phelps' commanding officer mentioned: ""If everyone was like Chance, we'd have no need for the Marines."" War is always destructive and never positive.
Great acting by Kevin Bacon.
I once came very close to being a Pro. Mgr. for the redesign of the facilities at Dover Mortuary and Andrews and Walter Reed. It turned out there was a shortage of funds so I was not hired. It would have been an honor.
No matter what you think of the horrible wars in Iraq and Afghanistan or even Vietnam, Korea, etc, our country needs to treat our service men and women and civilian employees for the military, with the utmost of respect and honor. We have shortchanged their benefits and have allowed some to exist with severe psychological injuries without positive and lasting help. I hope and pray this can become a priority for our countries' politicians and not be concerned about how much it costs. Money is unimportant when it involves the care of our fallen or injured or retired veterans. We should not need to buy power drinks to support the veterans.

The honor, respect, care, and reverence that not just the military, but everyone who came in contact with this fallen hero is beyond words.  I'm gratified to know that this is a true story, and that Americans across the land treat our fallen soldiers in this manner.

This is a hard movie to watch, but an important one to observe.  I'm NOT a crier, but even I had difficulty keeping it together near the end of the movie.  If I had broken down the way that I wanted to, my wife would have been a sobbing basket case in response, and I'm sure we could not have finished the movie without having a significant pause to regain our composure.

Watch this movie.  The premise doesn't sound like much, indeed it almost sounds boring from the description.  I can assure you that it absolutely is a captivating film.  You'll be glad you watched such an important and moving story, while profoundly saddened all at the same time.

For anyone who's served in any branch of the military, you'll see they got so many aspects of this tale correctly. And done with such respect for the military and the home towns that lose their sons and daughters, long before their time. Mr Kevin Bacon comes thru again. I always thought he looked like the best actor ever, to wear the dress uniform of the Marines on the silver screen and it was when he played a Marine in the movie ""A Few Good Men."" And after so many years, he still looks good in a Marine outfit. He wears the uniform with so much respect and his portrayal of the officer escorting the fallen soldier, is done with real compassion. As if Mr Bacon was honoring all our service men and women and that may very well be part of the reason he chose this film.

I served as  a Sergeant in the Army Reserves, starting at the end of the Vietnam war. I am also a woman. I am so proud of our brave men and women that make the sacrifice for our country. However, now that I am older, It angers me, how the government has let our soldiers down. They have had poor, and dangerous equipment to fight with, a shortage of men and women to serve, leaving our soldiers to serve too many tours in combat. When they come home, it seems they are forgotten. No veteran should EVER be homeless, they have little access to mental health, and die, while waiting months, and months for an appointment at a Veterans hospital.

Kevin Bacon did an outstanding job.  We take pride in our traditions.  Americans like the pomp of military parades; sharp uniforms and shiny medals; the excelling of soldier training; and without a doubt, having the biggest and best to win.  Yet, the final show of respect that comes from a soldier's service is the serenity of manicured green grass; the playing of Taps,  and carbon-copied, white headstones that line up row by row.  And now a family must cope with the loss of a son; daughter; father; mother; friend.

I'm proud to be an American and to have the freedoms that no other country on the face of the earth enjoys.  It is because of those great men and women who unselfishly serve this great land, and to the many who have given of their lives so we could have the freedoms which we enjoy.  This movie will cause you to reflect on every aspect of your life.  We bicker and fight over the left and the right, the Liberal and the Conservative, who's right and who's wrong.  The bottom line is we are all Americans and we are blessed in so many ways.  We tend to be selfish and ungrateful but we truly have more than anyone else in the world.  Hopefully, watching this movie will cause each of us to look deep inside ourselves, to be thankful and a more united people.  I truly love this film and have watched it many times.

3793219,2,B001TOD6N4,"This was the SLOWEST, most boring movie. ZERO action. Not what I expected from Kevin Bacon. I can't help but think he had a personal reason to do this movie. We watched the entire thing only because we couldn't help but think at any moment SOMETHING exciting would happen and the tide would change. But no, at the end we just stared at each other thinking what a waste of time it was and why in the world did we think something was going to happen. Well, because it's Kevin Bacon and he usually does enjoyable roles. Not this time. I'm torn - the story line is about a job we don't think about having to be taken on; but why this individual vs all the other military men / women in this position?",1485734400,,696,4.201492537313433

3793363,5,B001TOD6N4,I loved watching this movie due to the fact my husband did this for a troop who worked for him. I had no idea the depth and emotional roller coaster that is experienced. My husband watch this movie and said it was so accurate on the procedures that they must follow. This movie will pull at your heart strings as we both talked about once the movie was over. I have never been prouder of my husband as he could totally relate to what this movie portrayed. I will encourage my family and friends to watch this movie and tell them this is something my husband experience. Because they should know what our military people who take this journey have done. This has opened up our communications to a whole new level. I want to let our service men and women know this act they do willingly will never be forgotten by me. Thank you Amazon for showing this and I pray as others watch they become more aware of the sacrifice thats being made everyday!,1484697600,,943,4.363636363636363
3793364,5,B001TOD6N4,"I have seen most if not all of the war movies that have been made in the past two decades fiction and non-fiction. This is the first one to dig deeply into the very personal and painful side of what happens to those who lose their lives, when serving their country.  The entire approach to this film was one of reverence and respect to the soldier who was killed. I gave this 5 stars and would have given it ten if I could.  A heart wrenching tale of duty, honor and respect. I think that it should be required viewing in every single high school classroom in this nation so that people can really grasp what serving your country is all about. I supported the wars over the past decade and a half, but it is unconscionable to lose sight of the cost in human suffering and pain that is associated with committing our young men and women to fight for us. I watch this movie at least once a year so that I never forget.

I have seen other reviews that said they did not enjoy the movie or that it was too long or that they were uncomfortable with the graphic details. I think that is exactly what this movie is about and what the message is that they are trying to get across. This is not some Hollywood fluff piece. This is about the toll that is paid and how to honor those who paid the ultimate price.",1484697600,,1301,4.175298804780876

So many scenes with no dialogue, when his face said everything; you could see the turmoil in his mind, in his heart.  I knew that fallen soldiers were treated with respect and dignity while being transported; but I never thought about the details, or the men and women whose duty it is to perform them.
