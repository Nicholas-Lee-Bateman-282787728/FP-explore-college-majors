7869718,5,6304401809,"An extraordinary and under-rated cult film featuring a bravura performance by Brad Dourif (One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest) as a man severely crippled by cerebral palsy and confined in a sanatorium..  In an experimental program, prisoners at a local prison are assigned as care-givers for sanatorium inmates.  Michael Ironside (Total Recall; Scanners) costars at a rough but courageous street criminal with a soft heart, who becomes Dourif's care-giver.  The experimental program is overseen by Rae Dawn Chong, who adds a sexy dimension to all of her films, and easily catches Michael Ironside's attention.  This poignant film demonstrates how people who are seemingly polar-opposites can discover and share compassion and understanding.",1407542400,,737,5.612612612612613
7869719,4,6304401809,"I have always had a soft spot for this movie. No doubt about it, it is flawed. But the heart that comes through makes me want to overlook the flaws.
The basic story revolves around an inmate (Michael Ironside) who is put into an ""experimental"" program where he is allowed to be an ""assistant"" to a disabled man in an institution that is underfunded and desperately in need of help. A group of prisoners are put into this program, with vastly different results. Some embrace the concept of helping someone in need and find themselves elevated by the experience, others abuse the system.
The basic flaw I saw in this story is that it would never, ever happen. I work with the disabled, and NEVER would this happen, at least not in the way it is portrayed in the movie. I found myself shaking my head and saying, ""no way"" a lot. But I was able to suspend my disbelief and enjoy the movie anyway. I felt it had an extremely important message to tell, and it told it pretty well.
I am always a sucker for ""losers getting a second chance"" movies, and this movie fit that description completely. The main character (played by Ironside) is a two-bit criminal who keeps on beating his head against the wall --- angry at the ""injustices"" of the system, but unwilling to do his part to change his lot in life. It is truly heartwarming (and yet genuine) to see his character finally figure it out, and to see him flourish when he sees that he *can* get out of his self-defeating rut.
Character actor Ironside (who has built a great career playing creeps and sleazeballs) co-wrote and produced this fine film. I wish he'd do more like it. He also stars in the lead role, playing a man who finds that maybe he can allow himself to believe in second chances. Ironside is very good in this roll -- once again, I wish I'd see him play this kind of character more often. I think his talent is underappreciated most of the time.
Brad Dourif is *absolutely amazing* playing a severely disabled wheelchair-bound man. AMAZING. I always admire Dourif, but not until I saw him in this role did I comprehend what a fantastic actor he is.
Rae Dawn Chong is lovely, and perfectly adequate in her part as the head of this ""experimental"" program (and potential love interest to Ironside). Character actor Bruce Glover is chillingly creepy as a evil inmate with connections.
This film has adult themes and brief nudity, and is not for small children. However, I showed it to my sweet grey-haired grandmotherly mom, and she was able to cope with some of the more violent scenes and salty language, and really appreciated the message it had to tell.
This is a worthwhile movie, even though the basic premise is implausable. If you view it with the expectation that it is flawed but still has a wonderful message to share, you won't be disappointed.",1040774400,4,2816,4.556213017751479
