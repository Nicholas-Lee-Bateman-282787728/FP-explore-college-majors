8236837,5,B001043NR2,"I haven't tried this yet on my dvd player, but it plays just fine on my laptop.  Good quality dvds, just as funny as it was back in the day.

You can get this directly from the ABC (Australian Broadcast Company) website, or you can try - I couldn't get a purchase to go through.  Thankfully there are reliable importers bringing it to Amazon.",1409097600,,342,4.3125
8236838,5,B001043NR2,"In raw mockumentary style, this dry and apt satire strikes at the heart of corporate organization and planning of the Sydney Olympics. The dysfunctional team encounter setback after setback exacerbated by clumsy incompetency from sponsors and government officials. The setups are clever, the payoffs hilarious and always there is the biting political edge we expect from John Clarke and Brian Dawes. I first watched this show on my local PBS station in the wake of the 2002 winter Olympics. I find it one of the best written and brilliantly acted series of recent memory.",1241222400,10,571,5.085106382978723
