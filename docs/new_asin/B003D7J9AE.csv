8394695,3,B003D7J9AE,"I've always liked the acting style of Robert Cummings, or 'Bob' as he preferred in later life, especially when it came to comedy! By 1967 he was getting toward the end of his career, and had virtually concentrated on television for most of the 50's & 60's, with an occasional movie! 'Five Golden Dragons' was his last starring film, and although not a great one by any means, again, it's fun to just watch Cummings playing a very tongue in cheek 'hero' in this rather silly comedy/action film, plus some nice location scenery!
He was pushing 60 by now, but still playing the handsome, evergreen 'ladies man' that had become his forte on television. Pity it wasn't a better film for his swan song on the big screen, but to me, worth it just to see Robert Cummings strut his stuff one last time!",1359417600,,793,4.513888888888889
