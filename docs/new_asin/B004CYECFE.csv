4329665,2,B004CYECFE,"This has been done before. It's only refreshing to see the same story in a different setting.

There's little originality - the kids come back to from camping to discover their folks missing and the town has been invaded. The enemy aren't readily identified. But that's it

It's got incredibly two-dimensional and somewhat annoying characters. And they do such stupid things. Take for instance the bright idea of escaping back from town in a garbage truck at night - that's clever because it's a sturdy vehicle. But when troops appear in front, instead of running them over they reverse the truck. It's got it's yellow flashing warning lights illuminating it as a target. Furthermore when chased by two light vehicles they don't use the truck to drive them off the road.

Another is they decide to use a tanker truck to drive under part of a bridge and use the fuel in the truck as a bomb to blow the bridge up. Before they move into place two girls sit in the cabin remembering times before the invasion and are so engrossed in talking about boys they don't notice an enemy patrol moving up very slowly and otherwise easy to see. And of course one of them has turned the walkie-talkie off so no one can warn them. They remember to take a rope which they hope to dip into the fuel like a giant wick/fuse - but guess what? Matches? Lighter? No. Completely forgot that one too.",1316649600,,1375,4.536290322580645
4329666,5,B004CYECFE,"100% Stars to all involved in creating this movie.
The movie starts with kids getting ready for moving into the world of becoming adults. A group plan a weekend away together before they move on to the next part of their lives.
On returning home they find no one at home, in fact there is not one person in their home town.
As they investigate further they find everyone has been captured by invading forces.
This movie has your attention from the start to the end.
I do hope the ""whisper"" I heard that there could be a follow on movie or a series made, will happen.
I Highly recommend a purchase or must watch of this well made movie. This is another fabulously made Australian movie :)

4329667,5,B004CYECFE,"The movie was very entertaining, and for most of it I was easily able to suspend disbelief. I had some difficulty accepting how the camping group was assembled, but after that point it was absolutely worth watching. The group is exactly what I would expect of people with no military training - undisciplined, totally lacking any concept of operational security, and they even have a token coward who mans up by the end.

The wilderness locations are absolutely beautiful. I would love to go camping where they filmed the wilderness scenes.

Yes, the included plenty of movie hyperboles, such as the ability for anybody to accurately shoot from the hip or the effectiveness of the gasoline for demolition, but I can't fault any movie for doing what all the others are doing.

I can't say the movie is worth three times what we pay for domestic US movies, but now that I have seen it I will probably spend the same amount to see the sequel.",1314316800,2,939,4.644578313253012
4329668,5,B004CYECFE,"As an American once Ex-Pat who lived in Aus for her adolesecnce, I immersed myself John Marsden's stories about Ellie and company to a very personal level. Here I am, 10+ years later, and I still recommend this book series to teens and adults alike all the time.

I was NOT disappointed by this movie. Obviously, some things had to be modernized to be made relevent to a more digital age than the one these books were composed in - and it was performed beautifully. I don't feel any of the minute changes made to the flow of the storyline were unnecessary.
My only complaint is the lack of hermit, but I can see why he was cut out.

I typically abhore the conversion of good novels into film... this was not the case here. I was very pleasantly surprised. The character development was amazing, casting was perfect, and the ending was satisfying. They definitely left room for sequals - and I can't wait <3",1302998400,3,906,4.484848484848484
4329669,4,B004CYECFE,"Like almost all movies based on books, this DVD lacks a lot from the initial writings (of John Marsden) - but it is still highly entertaining. I think much of my enjoyment came however from watching one of my favourite teenage reads on the big screen in the lounge room. I thought the betrayals of Kevin, Homer, Ellie, Fi and Lee were great; while the others weren't quite as I'd imagined them. I think the DVD possibly tries to be a bit too `true' to the book, and will in turn be less impressive or enjoyable for those that aren't book fans. But, in saying all that, (as a fan) I can't wait for the next edition to hit the screens.",1302912000,2,633,4.239669421487603
4329670,2,B004CYECFE,"This is a rubbish movie.

The characters are stereotypical card board cut outs. Rigid Asian guy, outlandish Greek kid, dumb blonde, religous pale girl, stoner... list goes on

Its amateurish to see this kind of stuff, and all the more baffling given it was an adaptation from literature.

It actually annoyed me to see the lead female fall in love with the lifeless average looking asian kid. Oh... but wait.. the kid mouths off like some fortune cookie every once in a while and she gets all google eyed about it. Im not trying to be racist. Im trying to highlight the stereotypes. Surely they could find a more fitting Asian kid to play this part. Maybe some kid with a bit of charm... as to not want to bang your head against the wall when he pulls the John Travolta on her while the whole darn town is going up in flames, ""whats wrong, you don't like me""... No kiddo how can we make this clear... ""my friggn parents are laying waste in a war camp, I just gunned down three people last night and oh yeh... I haven't had any sleep cause I had to save your sorry a$$ from a flesh wound""
Oh boy, its a just so damn juvenile.

Not to mention the ridiculous action scenes. Machine guns firing a bucket load of rounds at a tractor for 15 minutes... ""it blew one of the tyres!""
Has anyone on the set even tried to shoot an AK-47 or similar. The religious girl mows down a group of soldiers like she's watering the garden... pffft... the kickback with her rambo-esque blaze of glory (short burst people... Call of Duty anyone?) would have sent her up in the air. Not to mention the accuracy on this girl from 50 metres out, sporting the machinery like she was fronting for Led Zepplin.

Then you have the completely inappropriate humour during completely inappropriate times. Arnold Shwarzenneger style one liners... Driving a tractor, theres still a military buggy spraying them with live ammunition.. but lets have a KIT KAT moment and say... ""your dangerous behind the wheel...LOL"".... pffft

THe constant fistful of disbelief makes this film cringe worthy. In an otherwise interesting idea which quite frankly 'Red Dawn' starring Patrick Swayze executes much better. At least that B-grade movie took itself a little more seriously.",1297468800,4,2230,4.647208121827411
4329671,4,B004CYECFE,"This is the film adaption of John Marsden's 1993 novel of a group of teenagers caught up in a foreign invasion of Australia. In short - it's great! Given the books popularity, I had some concerns that the film might not do it justice and it might look like `Home & Away' (Australian TV Soap) goes to war! But the actors, most with TV acting experience, do a creditable job and aren't there solely for their looks or profile. For the most part they fit what a normal group of teens would look like and as the action kicks in they take on a suitably unkempt look anyway. Of the key characters, Homer was very good and most importantly, Ellie worked for me too. There was a surprise or two in terms of casting choices and frankly Robyn will not work for everyone. A real plus was that some of the secondary characters get more exposure than in the book. The interactions between them all are fine, with the humour in particular being well delivered. For those concerned about coarser things, there is a little bit of sexual conversation but no nudity, some low level drug use and I'm pleased to say minimal bad language.

With a film adaption there are always a few tweaks to the original story and I have to say that for me, these all worked quite well and in a number of scenes, were very good. There was also some additional information on the wider situation with the war and this was most welcome given the book is very vague on this aspect. All the key events in the book are there and the film makers did a good job constructing them. There are plenty of explosions and the war violence is conveyed in a stronger manner than in the book. It is quite action packed and I found it to be genuinely exciting at times! It is not Mad Max and it shouldn't be either. It is a film made for a modern teen audience and those who enjoyed the book - as a teen or otherwise.

Military obsessives will find a few faults in how the enemy army is depicted. They're not the most efficient army ever either but they are certainly very violent at times and make suitable villains. There are some updates in terms of the technology that wasn't around in 1993 and also some fun, topical youth-culture humour and moments. The final scene is a bit hokey but the vision of the walk into 'Hell' is jawdropping! Altogether I found very little to criticize, this is a very entertaining film that I think fans of the book will embrace.

This made the two Hollywood Red Dawns look like The Godfather. Apart from the low budget feel, the characters act so irrationally and are so generally annoying I was actively rooting for them to get offed. Helicopter outside with a spotlight? Instead of hiding everyone just keep peeking out the window until you get seen. Just escaped getting shot and about to do the big climactic scene? Sit and chat about boys so they can add fake suspense. Jump on a motorcycle to escape while being shot at? Stop so you can say I love you, thus getting shot.

That is the negative now for the myriad of positives. The story was good, the acting was very good by all of the young people involved and every once in a while we get something surprising. So I get it that a bunch of teenagers get confused and scared but they eventually do the right thing, some of the ending I did not like but it fit so I went with it.

I loved Caitlin Stasey as the lead role, but I have to admit that the Ashleigh Cummings character did the most for me.  She was a religious girl who didn't believe in killing but had some choices to make as to whether to kill the enemy or let her friends die.

Normally, I am not a fan of Australian movies, however this one was different. It had good acting, and great special effects, which is in my opinion, unique for Aussie movies.

The movie played out quite similar to Red Dawn, and if you are a red dawn fan, you most likely will enjoy the film. Like Red Dawn, some level of suspension of disbelief is required, however overall the film is extremely entertaining. The variety of character archetypes is well balanced.

4329795,5,B004CYECFE,"This movie is based upon the popular novel and in fact the movie is much better than the novel.  I suppose it is the excellent cast.  These young people come across as authentic teenagers who are accidentally caught up in a holocaust, as a coalition of Asian countries invades Australia bent upon genocide and colonization.  Unlike in the (excellent) ""Red Dawn"" movie, these young people do not immediately pick up rifles and become guerrillas.  Instead, they grope towards the idea in a plausible and authentic way as the horror of their situation slowly becomes apparent to them.  But at last they realize that they have no real choice other than to defend the homeland that they come to realize that they love very much.

The acting here is surprisingly good.  Young teen actors often come across as contrived.  Not here.  These young people all pull off their roles quite well, which adds an air of authenticity to this engrossing film.  This one held my interest throughout.  Highly recommended.

My wife found Homer handsome and effective and I thought he did a good job in the role also.  Lee was a disappointment to both of us, being too scrawny to be believable in a hero's role.  The scenery was impressive, particularly on the march to Hell.  The enemy are portrayed as beetles with dark glasses who scurry around looking evil, which I think is an appropriate depiction of the invaders. Chase scenes are breath taking.

4329799,5,B004CYECFE,"I'm not even going to begin to read the other reviews about this movie because I can see it's already being vilified for reasons I cannot fathom. I watched this movie only because it looked decent and had a sci fi apocalyptic storyline. I also did some research into the making of this movie. It was one of the first all-Australian produced big, expensive movies and for that alone, I wish people would give it a break. I actually loved this movie. I thought it had a wonderful story, some very good acting, great special effects, and I never got bored.

SPOILER ALERT.....

This movie is about eight teenagers who go on a camping trip to a place in the wilderness called Hell, which is a truly beautiful spot, perfect for being alone and didn't seem like hell at all. They spend several days there, where they bond and we get to know the characters, which, for me, was why I liked the movie so much. It was a great way for the audience to get to know the characters before all the action begins. When they go back home, they find their homes are deserted, a dead dog, and unnerving silence. Instead of running into town and getting caught, they waited until dark and then went into town where all the action begins. We find out that their town is in a perfect spot for some sort of asian country to invade their country and use it as a dropping off point. One problem is that there is only one bridge for them to get out and into the rest of Australia.

What I liked, besides the way this group came together, did some very careful things to NOT be caught, and ultimately set up a plan to destroy the bridge, thus cutting off the asian troops from getting onto the mainland, was how smart they were. These were not your usual potty mouthed, lazy teens we all know and love, but teens who obviously are a cut above. They are obviously nice kids. Say what you want, but frankly I am tired of these ""coming of age"" movies, etc. where the teens learn some lesson about drugs, sex, alcohol or fill in the blank. These are simply kids who are faced with a serious crisis, don't moan and groan about it, they simply act. It's not quite as perfect as I am painting it. There was some angst in all of it, but on the whole, when the end finally came, I felt like jumping up and down and clapping for these courageous teens who put their country and family first and came up with a plan to stop the invasion.

It wasn't a perfect movie, but I gave it 5 stars because it's the first movie about teenagers in a long time where I felt good about them in the end. It's a fairly smart movie. Not filled with slashers, or monsters, or alcoholic, abusive parents, or just plain bad attitudes. Just good, smart kids who made a good plan and followed through with special effects that were worthy of a big budget Hollywood film. So, GOOD FOR THEM!

As for whether we'll see the 2nd or 3rd part of this trilogy is still up in the air. There are loose plans to start work on the 2nd movie, but my contact in Australia has been in contact with the movie company and could not get a definitive answer from them. It seems to me that instead of us Americans/Canadians/UKers used to producing big budget films (most of them crap if you ask me), we should be encouraging them, even helping them to build their own productions. Australia is not a rich country, and yet I think they produced a fine film with positive role models. I LOVED this movie and would really like to see the 2nd and 3rd movie made, as good or better than the first one. However, because of the tepid reaction of us snobby northerners, it's not likely to happen. And for that, I am really sorry. I love my country, don't get me wrong. Hollywood is another story. Not so much! I also know that Red Dawn was released around the same time as Tomorrow, and I suspect there was some blow back from that. Too bad because Tomorrow deserved better! It was a great movie and I would encourage you to watch it if you haven't already.

4329807,4,B004CYECFE,"Tomorrow When The War Began (2011) follows the adventures of a group of young people in Australia, who are faced with a crisis, when their country is invaded, and taken over by a foreign military force.  The movie is adapted from a book by the same name, which is the first of a series of seven books about this ongoing conflict.  Written by John Marsden, and known as the ""Tomorrow series"", the novels published between 1993 and 1999, are intended for young adults, and the film also appears to be targeted at a similar audience.

While clearly not intended to be the second coming of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Red-Dawn/dp/B008RTF3J4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Red Dawn</a>&nbsp;(1984), Tomorrow When the War Began deals with some provocative subject matter, in an interesting and thoughtful way.  The main focus is on the group of teenagers, and how they change, as they rise to the challenge that faces them.  What happens sometimes defies logic, or is played too much for laughs, but it's mostly appropriate, for a film mainly targeted at teens.

Seventeen year old Ellie Linton (Caitlin Stasey) and her best friend Corrie (Rachel Hurd-Wood) decide to take a group of friends deep into the outback and go camping at a place known as ""Hell"".  Joining them are Corrie's boyfriend Kevin (Lincoln Lewis), and their friends Homer (Deniz Akdeniz), Fiona (Phoebe Tonkin), Lee (Chris Pang), and Robyn (Ashleigh Cummings).  After a fun getaway in the wilderness, the group returns to civilization, and finds their homes abandoned, and their parents missing.  Eventually they discover that nearly everyone in the town of Wirraree has been captured, and are being held prisoner by an occupying army.

Few explanations regarding what happened are provided, and the enemy is not identified, although they appear to be of Asian origin.  Australia being overrun in a matter of days, may be farfetched, but after a long buildup, the film finally gets into action mode, as the group goes into town and successfully rescues a wounded member.  After their friend Chris (Andy Ryan) joins the group, they decide to take the offensive, embarking on a mission to disrupt the enemy's supply line, by destroying a key bridge.

Stuart Beattie adapted Marsden's book for the screen, and also directed the film.  Having never read any of the Tomorrow novels, I can't speak to how true to the spirit of the original books the movie really is, but from doing some research about the series, and listening to Beattie's commentary track, and also comments by Marsden, I believe that Beattie wanted to stay true to the spirit of the books, and he gets a lot right, making some bold and intelligent choices regarding the plot, that work well.

Marsden chose a female voice to tell his story, and in the movie, the young women assume the primary roles in most of the action scenes, and also face most of the moral dilemmas.  With the males in mostly secondary roles, the movie has a different tone from most action films.  While assertive females may be more common now, the concept was not as accepted when Marsden first published his book in 1993.  Comparisons to Red Dawn continually spring to my mind, but Tomorrow is simply not a film that embraces brutal violence, instead it reflects a softer, less adult tone, where there is room for silliness, bickering, and goofy humor.  It's not all fluff however, as the group suffers some casualties, and everyone eventually becomes hardened by their experiences.

Tomorrow When the War Began isn't particularly realistic, but targeted at a younger demographic, it is quite entertaining for what it is.  The teenage cast, are all quite good.  They seem to match their characters well, and have excellent chemistry together, with a natural buzz of youthful energy.  The film has good production values, and quality special effects.  The Region 2 release has some nice extras, including a number behind the scenes featurettes, an interview with John Marsden, and a commentary track by Stuart Beattie.

Following the original novel, the film ends with the remaining members prepared to continue the battle.  Unfortunately, plans for a sequel have so far failed to materialize, but hopefully it will happen before the cast members either get too old, or too successful to reprise their roles.",1359763200,,4353,5.095774647887324
4329808,4,B004CYECFE,"I enjoyed this movie about as much as I enjoyed ""Red Dawn"" which is basically the same type of movie. Well acted, and directed. There were no scenes that were ""inconceivable"" or childish. Well done.",1359417600,,198,4.685714285714286
4329809,5,B004CYECFE,"I found this at the video rental.  Just rented a bunch a low-price general titles hoping, at least, one might be good.  This was surprisingly good.  Afterwards I bought a copy for myself.

A group of teens go camping, and return to find their homes have been invaded and their families captured.
They retreat back to the wild, and slowly retrain themselves as guerilla fighters. They had no military training of any kind.  Just teens making it up as they went along.

The group's strongest characters were Ellie who was a natural leader, and Homer who was a punk with an instinct for mayhem and explosives - a rebel without a cause. Beyond that the group involved a nice variety.  Fiona - a sensual blond and Homer's crush. Corrie -  Ellie's best friend. Kevin - Corrie's crush.  Robyn - an innocent religious girl.  Lee - Ellie's crush.

The invasion brought them all together.  It gave Ellie a reason to lead.  Gave Homer a cause worth fighting for - he goes from punk to warrior.  Their feelings strengthened as they trained - crushes became love, friendship became family.

On their first attack they made the kinds of mistakes real teens could make - first accidentally shutting off a walkie talkie, and second the girls leaving themselves vulnerable because they got caught up in girl talk.  That was believable and excellent comic relief.  Despite those mistakes, they succeeded in destroying a bridge that the invaders relied on.

At the very end they had fully become soldiers, fighting to reclaim their homes.",1357689600,,1519,4.7992277992278
4329810,1,B004CYECFE,"If the people who brought you Twiglight decided to rip-off Red Dawn and set it in Australia then you'd have 2010's Tomorrow, When the War Began. From the casting, romantic subplot, dialogue and distinct lack of gore, this film was clearly aimed at teenage girls, as if this Cold War/Red Dawn inspired movie were the typical fair of their target audience. There are so many things wrong with this film, I don't know where to begin. First off, just like the 2012 Red Dawn remake they wuss-out of saying that they've been invaded by the People's Republic of China. Instead, very late into the film, it's announced that the invaders are The Coalition Nations, guess we can't offend the future overlords. Next this improvable group of high schoolers, though you wouldn't have guessed that from the casting, armed with just a single AK-47 style assault rifle manages to take out a key inland bridge from one of the invader's main supply ports. Even though this is a rated R war film only one Australia is actually killed on screen, which doesn't include any of the eight teenage protagonists. The entire story is utterly politically correct and predictable, down to the obvious Asian protagonist Lee. Apparently the film makers thought so little of their audience that they had to include the noble Thai restaurant busboy otherwise the audience might of come off with the idea that all Asians are villains. The story takes place within a span of a few days, which make the abrupt character development seem rushed, if not ludicrous. One day Kevin runs like a coward from enemy fire, abandoning his girlfriend in the process, but just a few days later he's charging in on motorcycle to rescue same girlfriend. Robyn, the religious Thelma type from Scooby Doo, who on multiple occasions swears she won't murder ends-up killing more Chinese then everyone else in the group combined. The last few minutes alludes to the group's maturing into a hardened gorilla force, now actually fully armed, but we never actually see any of this, which is a shame cause that would have been much more interesting. No the film ends like a made for TV pilot, promising more to come when the show is picked-up for production. Don't waste your time on this 104 minute teen melodrama masquerading itself as an action/war movie.",1356998400,,2298,4.83502538071066
4329811,4,B004CYECFE,"When Australia is suddenly invaded by an, ahem, unidentified Asian power, eight disparate teenagers band together and become partisans.

Even though there's a lot to be skeptical about here, painstaking cinematography, a well-constructed storyline, and strong acting/characterization/dialogue give ""Tomorrow When the War Began"" an immediacy that makes it work as long as one is willing to let it work. It's obvious that the creators went to some time, expense, and trouble producing this film, a refreshing change from so much of the sloppy low-budget crap we've been seeing lately. Atmospherically, it reminds me of many of the better films from the '80s: It has touches of everything from ""Mad Max"" to ""The Breakfast Club."" Funny in places, a bit grim in others, without anything gratuitous, it's a simple, pleasantly corny thriller that doesn't try to do anything except entertain, and it does that very well.

A couple of other things:

--Some really lush South Australian scenery, particularly of the dangerously beautiful region of ""Hell,"" where the teens camp at the beginning and later take refuge from the invaders;

--The ""Alternative Ending"" on the DVD is worth watching--I like it better than the standard ending.",1356220800,,1225,5.298969072164948
4329812,1,B004CYECFE,"I was looking for something like Red Dawn. Old Red Dawn, New Red Dawn, this garbage doesn't come close to either.  The acting was just so bad and events that were just make you scream ""That wouldn't happen""  I really had high hopes for this movie.  I have not read the book so don't know how close it is to the book but have heard others say it isn't like the book. I could not believe in the characters nor that the character would do anything they did in the movie. I have done a video review on this video under Fuyingbro on youtube.  Please watch it to understand how I feel.  I really felt like taking it to the range and shooting it.",1355702400,5,639,4.120967741935484
4329813,4,B004CYECFE,"Before going too much into the merits of the film, several of the more commonly critiqued aspects of the film should be discussed.  Yes, just about every main character is fairly attractive.  This is a somehow a flaw for TWTWB, but nobody complained about Swayze, Sheen, Howell, Grey, and Thompson all camping together.  Although, the clichd cast assembly was sort of irritating.  I'd much rather have seen two of race X, three of race Y, or a split down the middle, than the random token addition of one Asian guy.  The likelihood of them inviting a guy they hardly know - no matter how interesting he may be - is highly unlikely.  Some have pointed to the fact there is more melodrama than action.  I agree with this concept, but since this film is just the beginning of a series, I'm hoping the next films get deeper into the action like Red Dawn.  Of course, had it all been squeezed into one movie, it could have taken away from the screenplay and character development - the latter I kind of enjoyed.  Yes, they make childish and nonstrategic decisions even while engaging their occupiers.  Well, this is Australia, not Afghanistan; maybe they're just not really mentally prepared for this type of life yet?

With all that said, if you're actively seeking an Aussie version of Red Dawn, this film more than satisfies.  The actors are more than capable while not being exactly polished.  I believe this adds a small semblance of realism to the film because nobody in an ""unknown forces just body-slammed my entire country and are now occupying it while killing randomly""-situation is going to be cool, calm, and collected.  Whereas Red Dawn goes from hunting rifles to RPGs in a blink of an eye, TWTWB takes a slower, more cautious approach that falls in line with the characters' likely trepidation.  If Red Dawn were set up as a trilogy, it would have most likely not had them going on full ambush missions with tactical precision within ten minutes of their predicament's realization.  I would be remiss if the Australian landscape were not mentioned.  Much of Red Dawn's beauty exists in the beautifully remote New Mexico forests, and TWTWB more than fills that with the picturesque views from various locations within New South Wales.

Overall I was very pleased with this film.  Sure, it can be nit-picked apart like the majority of films produced today, but I enjoyed it quite a bit because I was able to accept it for what it is.  Those with very fond admiration for Red Dawn will probably love this film.",1354665600,,2518,4.718535469107551
4329814,3,B004CYECFE,Unfortunately the author of the books finds it necessary to have the characters be conflicted about attacking those who invaded their country.  This is political correctness gone wacko.  If somebody invaded my country and locked people up in concentration type camps.  I would be pissed and would grab the first gun i could find and take as many of them out as possible.  I sure would not worry about whether or not we as a country had offended or perhaps not helped these folks enough.  That being said the movie is good and the story is enjoyable if you can get past the P.C. crapola.  It would be interesting to see how the author felt if this actually happened to Australia.,1354492800,,678,4.56198347107438
4329815,1,B004CYECFE,"There comes a time when it is fitting to speak truth to power.  I knew I was going to hate this film less than a minute in, when the attractive young Australian girl, speaking into a hand-held camera, tries to prepare us for the flashback story to follow.  She's not really a bad actress - none of these kids are - but there is something so melodramtic in her delivery when she mentions 'the friends they have lost', that I could immediately see that we had entered tweenie fantasy land.

Seven Australian teens go camping and return to find that their country has been invaded by mysterious 'coalition forces', and which look suspiciously like Chinese forces.  After a brief time hiding from the invaders (and horsing around in swimsuits), the teens eventually decide to fight back, guerrilla style, opting to destroy a bridge near their town which connects a major port to the interior of  the country.  Now, I'm not going to dissect the strategies and tactics the group uses, nor am I going to ridicule the ridiculous idea of the 'coalition forces'.  Honestly, I've seen a tremendous amount of bad films over my lifetime, and taking things like this with a grain of salt is part and parcel of bad science-fiction/apocalyptic/dystopian/WWIII dramas - what does drive me crazy about a film like TWTWB is its desperate infatuation for enhancing the emotional, melodramatic style of storytelling over any substantive point of view.  It exists in a narcissistic vacuum.

That certainly doesn't mean it won't appeal to viewers who like that sort of thing.  In fact, if one subsists on an unregulated diet of this kind of storytelling, then TWTWB is probably going to look stylish and unique, due to both its cast and location.  At the very least, it will seem average.  For those who have enjoyed the TWILIGHT series, or such television melodramas as DAWSON'S CREEK and others, TOMORROW WHEN THE WAR BEGAN is highly recommended.  If those examples are not to your taste, then I would advise skipping TWTWB.

4329816,5,B004CYECFE,"This is NOT a copy of Red Dawn - and I am a Red Dawn fan. It is BETTER! It has a totally different plot, story line, and has much originality. You get great insight into the characters before the action begins and get to see them grow as the situations intensify. And tell me, if you are paying attention, that there won't be a bit of a tear in you eye a time or two near the end - for sadness, yes, but also for bravery in the face of being put into a mind altering situation. In the same way that I totally understand the foundations of sniper Private Jackson (Barry Pepper) in ""Saving Private Ryan"" as he prays even while performing his duty, watch for Robyn's deeper understanding (an incredible few moments of performance by Ashleigh Cummings near the end) as the reality of it all hits home.

If you are into magnificent scenery in a film this is one to see! I want to go camping where they were - maybe the sequel should have a prize entry for a trip to go camping in Australia in ""Hell"" - and the juxtaposition of the place with that name being the paradise refuge left for them to run to - wow...

Please consider watching this movie. There is more here than you might think.

4329821,1,B004CYECFE,"Sadly, there was something here, a seed of potential that I so wished had a chance to grow into a scenario that no doubt lies in the realm of the possible. Particularly given Australia's proximal location to China - and the Dragon's seeming unstoppable expansion in the east.

But this Aussie '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Red-Dawn/dp/B000PMFS14/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Red Dawn</a>' failed on so many levels. It's difficult to categorize without doing a pile on.

For starters, this would've been more enjoyable had the filmmakers' standards been set at ""less pretty"" in favor of ""more character"". The worst was Caitlin Stasey playing hardworking farm girl Ellie turned rebel insurgent. About as genuine and appropriate for the role as choosing Snooki at becoming a Green Beret.

With those poor selections, from the get-go, the film had an air of a exaggerated falsehood. The entire cast made up of much-too-worldly, self-aware juniors wrecking the foundation of what I felt had the kernel for something quite good. And because that foundational element never takes hold, we're never fully invested in the movie's reality, in accepting the drama as depicted. Populated by thespian school hopefuls parading as actors, they're clearly not ready for the big screen.

Again, highlighting Caitlin's performance as lead character Ellie, whose oscillations between overacting and underplayed made this retread all the more difficult to screen. Example: When her character and Corrie were in the playhouse. Yikes, what an absolutely terrible execution. I'm surprised she didn't put the back of her hand to her forehead and made some monstrously trite pronouncement. Just one of an incredible array of terrible cringe worthy scenes. The campsite scene at 1:13 in the film ... I can't even begin to start without writing a thesis on ham-fisted melodrama - both written and execution.

One has to lay the primary blame at the feet of Director Stuart Beattie. It was his ineptitude that led these drama students down the merry path toward incompetence.

A few more blatantly ridiculous bits that helped heave this into silliness:

- We have these kids driving around on motorcycles, ATVs and SUVs - in the daytime no less. I'm not looking for fully authentic combat realism, but c'mon. I know what some of my fellow vets are thinking, ""Small town. Small force. Unexpected resistance."" Got that. But let's look at the flip side. Your company, a presumption given the approximately 100-150 enemy seen, is going to be tasked with subduing this backwater village. There has to be some intelligence. I mean even a basic satellite reconnaissance like Google Earth will reveal the general lay of the land, where the population is spread. And S2 should have a general idea of population count, types of housing, key civilian leadership, etc. It's not like these guys went in there completely blind. So yeah, once you have most of the populace under control, you immediately set out to cull the hold outs, the hideaways homebounds, etc. You never remain static. You're going to set-up a series of posts - fixed, fixed concealed, and roaming. No way a bunch of vehicles goes tearing around without one of your posts picking up either ambient noise or movement, most especially in a rural township. This isn't a city - sound travels far.

- Why does everyone's makeup look so even throughout the movie? One of the reasons the original 'Red Dawn' worked was you could see how plain everyone was being virtually makeup free. And, most importantly, looked progressively worse as the film went on - which of course makes complete sense. I'm thinking specifically of Lea Thompson and Jennifer Grey who were almost unrecognizable by the movie's final. That all the females in 'Tomorrow' had their hair and makeup intact throughout the flick doomed this to a laughable unreality.

- My favorite quote, ""You're bleeding!"". Yes, thank you Captain Obvious. The fact that a half dozen soldiers are firing fully-automatic assault weapons at you might, just might, incur some injury and blood loss. You know, with the shattered front shield and all. So let's tack on atrocious screenwriting to this flick.

- Additionally, the clichd trope of the 'checklist' - the working girl, the good girl, the portly (naturally) religious girl, the beauty, the likable average guy who turns out to be a coward (and will likely die a hero saving everyone in the upcoming films), the troublemaker, and of course, the token person of color - which I'm surprised wasn't an Aboriginal. Predictably derivative to a fault. People, all people, find friendship in a shared commodity. Whether that's work, an association, or even a hobby, there's always a common thread. What you don't have, not ever, are seven completely different people from wholly divergent backgrounds hanging out with one another. This formula only works with two basic movie constructs: Juries and certain kinds of natural disasters. Well, those and a Coca-Cola commercial.

I understand this is the first of a trilogy. Yikes. If you hit rock bottom, I suppose things can only get better. The scary part - if I were a fan? I don't think they've hit the bottom yet. It'll be interesting to screen the newly rebooted 'Red Dawn' coming out later this year, if only for comparison's sake.

Movie Note:

- Director Beattie should be embarrassed and ashamed for not hiring one veteran from the Aussie SAS to help advise his production. I counted something like 50 people in the Effects Dept, another 30 or so in SFX, 30 in Sound, etc, etc. The one guy they desperately needed in this film, more than all that fluff and special effects, he ignored.

It shows. It really shows.

Two girls sitting in a gas tanker truck underneath a bridge they are supposed to blow up within a few minutes don't know how to use their walkie talkie and have turned it off by mistake and are talking about how their boyfriends kiss, not looking out the windlow, totally inattentive to the enemy soldiers coming up behind them with their flashlights blazing? They are in dire danger, these few minutes are arguably the most important of their lives, with their friends in great danger as well and they loose themselves in talk about kissing boys? Are you kidding? Could any two 17 year olds possibly be that idiotic? In another scene the 7 or so teenagers have taken to hiding somewhere in the countryside and are sitting around a campfire at night? This, after there have been tons of enemy helicopters and jets screeching across the sky practically thoughout the movie? Do you think they might be spotted because of their blazing campfire? Oh, and to top it off, the girls are wearing shorts. They had plenty of opportunity to get pants and other warm clothing from their homes that they visited. Why, when they are supposed to be hiding from literally thousands of enemy soldiers do they need a blazing campfire if its so warm they are wearing summer clothes? Only the writers and directors know. When they are hiding in a house out in the countryside and a helicoper with a searchlight starts to scan the house one of them says, ""We need to go to separate rooms"" Which they do, but almost all of them are peeking out of various windows. Good way not to be seen. And of course one girl gets caught standing up against the window drapes when the spoflight hoovers on the window. Could they really be that stupid? Then they all run from the house to the barn while the helicopter hoovers overhead. The helicopter somehow blows up the house they were just in, some type of missile I guess, but then doesn't shoot up the barn they have all run to. Why not? They must have seen them all running to the barn? I have to assume that this was two a hour made for TV episode to kick off a series about these clueless lads and lasses. Otherwise, there is really no excuse for how bad a movie this is.

It's a teen movie with a bit of survival in it. Don't get me wrong. I thought it was a good movie for what it was. It had great special effects. It was nice to see they didn't skimp there. Characters were a bit stereotypical. A little too much teen angst and inappropriate conversation during times when you should be paying attention. Really, do you need to talk about your love life as you're trying to blow up a bridge? Would you just stand there laughing while a herd of farm animals chase off your enemies? Isn't it like common sense that they just might shoot back??  Sometimes it seems that they're about to get serious, but then the movie takes a turn back to bubblegum teenie bopper problems.  It's not a bad movie but it's different from what a typical fan of this genre might assume. If I were to compare two movies as different from themselves in the same genre,  it would be Independence Day vs Battle Los Angeles. One takes a more light hearted approach to the genre while the other is more down and gritty. Its the same with Tomorrow When the War Began vs Red Dawn.",1342828800,,1213,4.3822222222222225
4329830,4,B004CYECFE,"I found this movie thoroughly enjoyable.  It had sympathetic characters, good character development, reasonable dialog.  Good acting.  It was the sort of movie I enjoy, namely a speculative story about a dramatic event in which the characters have to work together to solve problems, and in this case, to adjust to the new reality.  A number of reviewers have blasted it for being unrealistic, not action oriented, etc.  I thought there was plenty of action, though it wasn't a non-stop series of impossible action sequences like a 007 movie or recent Angelina Jolie movies.  It had some brutality, it had some car chases (truck chase), it had tension, and it had 'coming of age'.  It was fun.  It was sweet.  It was inspirational.  Very good young adult fare and (in my case) old but 'young at heart' fare.  Bought it after seeing it on TV.

Possible Spoilers below:

Yes there were many things that were ""unrealistic"" or not ""proper guerrilla tactics"" as other low star reviewers have complained.  To me, they didn't interfere with the story.

No, it is not reasonable that a teenage pacifist girl first firing an assault rifle would take out several professional soldiers even if she was shooting them in the back.  But that didn't bother me much..there didn't need to be several soldiers, there could have been one, and anyway the scene wasn't about how well she could shoot, it was about how when she had to she was willing to break her moral code to save her friends' lives.

Was it likely a handful of teenagers would evade capture by the whole series of encounters they had with the invading soldiers as others have complained?  No.  But is it possible..yes..and even historical.  If you're old enough to remember Vietnam, there were plenty of teenagers that successfully took on a far superior invading force (us).

Does gasoline routinely go up like an explosive?  No.  Would throwing a burning rag at some gasoline pooled on the ground under a gas tank make an explosion in a few seconds that would kill a number of soldiers?  No.  Again, that didn't matter very much to me.  The spirit was good, even if the exact means were improbable.  Again, in comparison to Bond or Jolie or any number of spy and caper movies, the sort of 'impossible' things these kids did were 'realistic' even though technically impossible. They weren't absurd and ridiculous..just exaggerated.  And they weren't the point of the story.

All in all, a flawed but very enjoyable movie. If you want non-stop ""action"", Kung Fu, ""Sin City"", this is not for you.  If you want overt sex, ""adult"" language, cynicism, black humor, (""Drive Angry""), this is not for you.  If you want endless complexity (""Inception"") this is not for you.  If you want a straight up coming of age against the backdrop of a world turned upside down, this is probably for you.  It had a good heart.",1342828800,,2854,4.7474541751527495

This movie though is amazing.  gman2164 compared it to Swayze's Red Dawn and that initally put me off watching this as Red Dawn is a B Movie at best.  The only similarity this has to red dawn is the plot and the age of the characters.  The writing is well done.  The cinematography is beautiful and really immerses you in the guerrilla war these kids are fighting.  The acting is very good with the actors/actresses really displaying the emotional trauma of the events they're living through.,1342310400,3,577,4.553398058252427
4329833,4,B004CYECFE,"What I like about Tomorrow: When the War Began is that it takes typical teenagers who love to party, go on camping trips, fall in love, etc and suddenly turns them into killing machines against their will.  If I started watching this movie without knowing its name or what it's about, I'd have NO idea that after the first 30 minutes of (to be honest) cliched writing that things would change *dramatically*.

When the teens come home and discover that their parents are missing, they drive around their abandoned town and search for clues on what happened.  Maybe it's just me but I LOVE the mystery and atmosphere that surrounds these type of storylines so I'm *already* enticed.

Now I can understand those who didn't particularly like this movie would strong have a problem with the fact that it's totally unbelievable that typical teens would miraculously find themselves narrowly escaping danger whenever confronted in such a situation, however the magic is that in the land of movies I really see no problem with it whatsoever.  The atmosphere is intense, the acting is a step above the rest, the gradual change in attitude and maturity that the teens experience as the war intensifies and the confrontations become more violent and numerous... these are things I definitely admire.  You really care about these teens and want them to defeat all obstacles and survive.  The one segment with the helicopter shining a light through the temporary home the teens were staying in is a perfect example of such intensity.  Yes we've seen similar segments in dozens of other films but there's always a feeling of mystery whether the bad guys will discover that people are living there.

Oh and the one female of the group is arguably the best actress of the bunch.  At one point the violence and confusion became so much that she actually started turning against her own friends by pointing guns at them and losing control before the realization set in that she's taking the warzone situation too far.  I loved it.

Of course it's not without one major flaw.  That being the ending.  Man this movie was flowing on SUCH a perfect, adrenaline-pumping pace that the way it just abruptly ends left me with a sour taste in my mouth.  No need for that at all- a proper ending should have been writen and given.  It's only fair given the amount of attention concerning everything *else* that took place.  Another small problem is that the entire film feels very American-ized, and not the least bit Australian (despite the slight accent).  On the plus side, it's very easy to make out their accents.  Either way, very minor complaint.

I highly recommend it.",1341532800,4,2650,4.80794701986755

4329835,1,B004CYECFE,"(1.) Actors with little or no experience unless it's a few TV series spots. Actors chosen for physical appearance and one of each type stereotyping. Not memorable, lacked emotion, acting but good line reading.
(2.) A remote part of Australia is invaded by (why?, who knows or even cares) what appears to be peoples of Asian descent. Never told, as if it matters, for obvious reasons even though it makes no sense but the writers needed to have someone and aliens are getting tiresome (gold, or some other alien desired precious resource has already been movie-done).
(3.)  If Australia ever had a military or a police force or armed civilians they were probably abducted by the previous invading aliens. The heavy US military presence in the Pacific must have been dozing while this vast invasion was being planned and assemble or they were paid off by international banking to rid the world of a remote part of Australia.
(4.) Ridiculous action scenes: A garbage truck, being driven backwards by a woman who has never driven a big rig, being chased by bad military guys in dune buggies firing high powered weapons - she wins, of course. Lots of scenes of our actors riding 'cycles in 1st gear for 50 feet (but made to look like seasoned bikers). Women barely able to lift heavy assault rifles suddenly are killing machines. An entire town standing upright, like Aussie sheep, for days in a movie-fast constructed fenced prison with towers. Only other action scene was an effects driven bridge being blown up. Romantic allusions fill the rest of the movie.
(5.) The usual cheap opening scene of helicopter view of a road winding through tourist scenic country. Lots of CGI to make an otherwise not cinematically interesting location seem like paradise.

What starts off as the tired theme of ""a group of friends go together..."" becomes an ambitious, thought-provoking World War III tale. Inspiration obviously springs from Invasion USA and Red Dawn, but with glorious camera work, competent, pretty cast and magnificent location shots. A different view that reminds me of why apologizing and submitting to the enemy is not a good idea. Now, the ""Enemy"" is never identified but is Asian. Since Japan, Vietnam and South Korea are allies I suppose the invaders could be Chinese or North Korean (both nations are on the brink of environmental and population explosions, which were claimed as reasons for the invasion in the movie). Like the original Invasion USA (1952), the lack of enemy identification plays well to the confusion and rage. A worthy addition to my video library. Now, about a sequel...",1335052800,3,969,5.0625

This movie is a fairly close adaptation of the first book, and IMO is a very worthy addition to any fan of the series' collection.

Boiled down, the story is roughly as follows: Some Australian small-town and farm teenagers go together on a camping trip, ending up in a wild valley called ""Hell"" for its difficulty in entering.  While they're out camping, they notice, one night, planes flying over without lights.  And when they get back...their families are gone.

Australia's been invaded, most of its people have been apparently rounded up by the enemy, and our teenagers are some of the very few people who're free.  They make the decision to fight back...and start growing up in a hell of a hurry.

There's some discussion of sex, a little kissing, and (surprise, surprise, it's a war movie) a fair amount of violence.  I'd recommend this to anybody over about age 12, and anybody who liked _Red Dawn_ will love this; unlike _Red Dawn,_ this movie didn't have someone else fiddling with the basic story.",1335052800,4,1207,4.660377358490566
4329846,4,B004CYECFE,"This movie is based on a series of novels for young adults. The premise is that a group of teenage friends are away camping in the Australian outback when Australia is invaded.

They ultimately find that they have been invaded (though who the force is is never explicityly stated, a strong point that will allow the books and the movie to age well) and that their families, friends and neighbors are in POW camps.

Shell-shocked the group seeks shelter, sanctuary and allies and ultimately a plan. This is a story about how a group of teenagers turns itself into an effective guerilla force against an armed invader. Learning the lessons of others who tried to fight back too soon, they take their time, ultimately closing off access to their community. The writing, acting and setting are all top-notch.

4329849,3,B004CYECFE,"First things first - if you are at all tempted to think of this as being even near the same overall theme as 'Red Dawn', then stop and purge those thoughts. The only similarity is that both have an invading force. Red Dawn is  total action picture, the stars looked more or less like average teens in Anytown USA and the action began in the first few minutes and continued until the final few.  The body count of bad guys was satisfyingly high, and the ending wrapped things up pretty well, in its own way.

""TWTWB"" on the other hand, is beautifully photographed, stars beautiful people, has beautiful scenery, Australian outback, wilderness, waterfalls. the young people don't look much like anyone that I knew in high school or university days, but then, if I had lived in Hollywood or Australia, maybe they wold have all had that warm glowing appearance.
Action: The action in this movie does not begin until about three-quarters of the way through. If you expect the ambush the bad guys, snipe them from cover, etc., then you will be sorely disappointed. The main bit of action involves blowing up a bridge. period.
There is no 'character development' of the enemy, and the reasons for invasion are given in a very cursory, perfunctory way, having a vague connection to the world's diminishing resources and the need for the communist approach to 'sharing the wealth' by taking everything that everyone has, killing or imprisoning anyone who objects, and sending the natural resources back to Mother China.
The 'ending' is merely a scene of the grim but still beautiful young crew, riding off into the sunset - or maybe it was the dawn, I was a bit numb by then - vowing to fight the good fight. Huzzah.

I do understand that this is part of a Never Ending Series - a serial based on a series of books - but bluntly speaking, I was rather disappointed that this portion did not do well as a 'stand alone' movie. The exquisite Stieg Larsson series starring Noomi Rapace and Michael Nyquist, the Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, et al, are all connected - all part of the Millennium series - yet each of them can be viewed as a complete movie on its own, ( Granted, the end of the second might be a bit melancholy if we did not already know that Lisbet would be around for the third film) so I rather hoped this would follow in that vein.

4329860,3,B004CYECFE,"Seven college bound friends return from a weekend camping trip to discover that a foreign army invaded their Australian homeland. With their friends and families taken prisoner, they must band together and find a way to fight for their freedom and survival.

Tomorrow When The War Began is a low budget Australian movie recently released in the U.S. that follows seven students on what they think is their last hurrah camping trip before the school year begins in the fall. Upon returning home, they discover their family and friends have all vanished and begin searching for answers.

There isn't a lot to say about this movie. The beginning is slow as they develop the characters which isn't surprising because the movie is based of a ten book series written by John Marsden. Once the characters are developed, the story movies along fairly quick and the action picks up dramatically.

Due to the slow development and large amount of books in the series, this would probably do better as a television series. I also wonder if U.S. audiences will connect with the movie since it's not based in the U.S. Tomorrow When The War Began is required reading for Australian middle school children which means most viewers are familiar with the story before they walked into theaters.",1330473600,,1276,4.898148148148148

people believe they are a new release.  YOu can imagine how mad old
people are with forgetful memory, just to remember they have already seen it!!!
It's sort of underhanded.  Would be nice if Amazon came up with a warning, to
alert you.  I mean, they warn you if you already posted a review about an item,
so why not about a movie???",1330300800,2,407,4.259740259740259
4329863,3,B004CYECFE,"First of all this is an OK movie worth watching. However, not quite as much action as I thought it would have. A lot of the fighting scenes are not that convincing as well. I'm not a big fan of unrealistic explosions either and in this movie they use gasoline as an explosive in more than one scene. Overall I do not think this movie is as good as Red Dawn. Never the less, it is entertaining.",1330300800,,393,4.116883116883117
4329864,4,B004CYECFE,"Great Movie!  Go get them!  Wolverines!

This is a new (Australian) version of the 1980's classic Red Dawn.  The acting is good and the plot could have been better (who attacked, more about what the Government did to fight, etc.) and motive for the invasion, but overall a good movie worth watching.  The only issue I see is the first half of the movie was too slow for character development and the best parts were in the last 20 minutes of the movie.",1330300800,,452,4.397590361445783
4329865,5,B004CYECFE,"Stuart Beattie has delivered a polished and exciting adaptation of John Marsden's novel ""Tomorrow, When the War Began.""

The excellent shot selection and cinematography captured so much beauty of the Australian landscape, and the performance of the entire cast delivered a strong and authentic screen presence.

It was also pleasing that the Australian persona was accurately conveyed with local terms and slang as part of the film dialogue.

The action and adventure narrative is presented with dazzling colour and quality special effects.

It is fantastic that a world renowned Australian novel has made it to the screen, and I commend Beattie for supporting Australian Literature and the Australian Film Industry with this great movie.

4329868,4,B004CYECFE,"This is the box office smash that took Australia by storm, and the rest of the world is catching up. It is taken from the `teen novels' written by John Marsden and follows the book very closely. It is about a group of friends who decide to have a weekend getting back to nature;  that is sleeping under the stars and catching your own food etc. They borrow Ellie's dads' Land Rover and set off. Whilst they are there they see `a whole bunch' of military aircraft passing over head but have no idea of the significance. Ellie is the charismatic female alpha figure played brilliantly by Caitlin Stasey.

On their return they find animals dead, places abandoned and everybody missing. That is when the really start to worry. After hunting around they discover that the entire town of Wirawee, is being held prisoner at the Show Ground. They slowly piece together what has happened and realise that an unnamed country of `coalition' forces has invaded Australia to exploit its resources. The kids have no military training, and few weapons, and a lot of growing up to do. Despite all of that they decide they have to fight back.

This has been criticised for being a poor take on `Red Dawn' and at first I thought so too, but it is actually quite original in that it is not that black and white. The main male positive character is Asian Chris Pung playing LeeTakkon. Yet the invaders seem to be Oriental so who is the enemy? A point on the production they deliberately use different languages and then mix them up so you are not able to work out who the invaders are. We also have issues of cowardice, religious ethics, vegemite and the right use of make up.

The CGI is excellent, the scenery is stunning and the whole thing has a confidence in its own ability, and it does not fail to deliver. There are a couple of plot holes, but they are so minor that they do not take away from the enjoyment. Director and co-screenplay writer Stuart Beattie has done himself proud in this adaptation and the pacing is just right too. I wanted it to go on a while longer when it ended and as this lasts for 103 minutes I thought that was quite some achievement.

This was the highest grossing film in Australia for 2010, bringing in $13 million, which is not a bad effort at all. On the back of that they are going to make two, yes two sequels. So not long to wait for the next instalment, and if it is half as good as this, then it will have been well worth the wait.",1320278400,10,2455,4.386813186813187
4329869,5,B004CYECFE,"This very entertaining movie does justice to the book and is worth watching even if you haven't heard of the book. Beneath the story of an invasion is the story of a group of people finding themselves in the world and standing up for what they believe in.

People who want a really realistic war movie will be disappointed. The young guerilla squad has no concept of discipline or operational security, as one should expect, and this leads to some very lucky escapes. But the inexperience leads to some very exciting and dramatic sequences, making the movie more enjoyable.

In short, this is one of the best movies I have seen recently and I highly recommend it.",1317600000,3,663,4.6581196581196584
4329870,4,B004CYECFE,"Based on a series of bestselling young adult author James Marsden's books, this details the lives of teenagers living out a last bit of fun with an adventurous road trip/camping vacation to a remote area, before school is about to come back in session. Starts off innocently and freewheeling enough as they leave a small country Wirrawee town somewhere in NSW. One night one of the kids awakens to the sound of squadrons of jets zooming overhead... and goes back to sleep thinking nothing of it.

When the teenagers pack up and return from their ""secret"" grotto which they established is theirs, they find most of the homes abandoned,families missing, power out,dogs shot dead, and vehicles burning. Going further into the center of town by nightfall they soon see the truth: Australia has been invaded by an unknown, Asian ""Coalition"" possibly Chinese, Indonesian or Burmese-or all of them. Brutal and uncompromising, anyone arguing with them in the ""indoctrination"" prison camps they've set up is shot dead.

The group, unknown at this point to the invaders, runs back into the country homes to hide, and start making plans to defend their town and rescue their loved ones. They also realize the massive scope of this war with various radio snippets and the shocking realization that the world cannot help them, they're on their own. The smaller Australia forces are overwhelmed by the massive invasion which seeks to annex Australia for it's natural resources and vast areas of open land. They become guerilla fighters taking the battle to the enemy on their own terms. WHen they realize the enemy has figured out they are hiding in their family's homes(one is completely firebombed) they retreat further to their hard to access vacation grotto and start making more ambitous plans.

Overall pretty good film, filled with teenage angst and doubts and some fairly good special effects, one depicting an air battle.",1317427200,17,1916,5.037854889589905
4329871,5,B004CYECFE,"I have read the books including the Ellie Chronicles and have loved them all. I am in my 50's and had always wished to read the books when I bought them for my children. This film really motivated me to read them all. I thought the acting was superb, the little incidents such as Homer playing Gandalf ""you shall not pass"" designed to lighten the tone amusing.  The reviewers who say this has been done before have my attention. Few Australian films are produced compared to the many from the USA and UK. To have a film that Australians can identify with is satisfying. To have one directed at Young Adults whereby the actors look normally attractive (not made up models) and try to do their best without being perfect was inspiring",1316822400,,732,4.545454545454546
