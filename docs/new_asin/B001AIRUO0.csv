3453064,1,B001AIRUO0,"My DVR has these all. It is a waste of money to buy this DVD. I would buy a ""first season"" package, but not this. Disney greed is yet again in the way of customer satisfaction.",1222819200,2,176,3.9166666666666665
3453065,5,B001AIRUO0,it was a wonderful story as always coming from Disney.  It was also nice to see christopher Robin's sister again.,1222646400,,113,4.65
3453066,3,B001AIRUO0,"My 5-year old daughter likes this movie.  She said it's scary, but she likes scary.  My 3-year old son, however, kept leaving the room, so we finally ended up turning it off to resume when he was asleep.  A little too scary for my 3-year old, but I'm sure he will enjoy it later.",1222300800,,279,4.12962962962963
3453067,1,B001AIRUO0,I agree with other reviews. I thought it would be like Micky Mouse Club House and have a least 1 Halloween theme show. The only Halloween show it Handy Manny with is not why I bought the DVD. Very Disappointing!!,1221782400,3,212,4.325
3453068,1,B001AIRUO0,"I had been looking forward to this dvd for my daughter because we believed it to be a Halloween dvd for the ""My Friends Tigger & Pooh"" series.  I'm very disappointed in Disney for this.  Not only does it mislead with the title ""Hundred Acre Wood Haunt"" but the cover makes it look like a Halloween DVD as well because of the darkness and the pumpkins everywhere.  This is nothing but a copy of previously seen episodes.  The ONLY Halloween episode on here is not even Tigger and Pooh!  It's a Handy Manny ""bonus"" episode!  Whether or not the contents of this dvd are listed on the back, this whole release was deliberately misleading and I'm very disappointed.  I will definitely scrutinize my future dvd purchases in the future instead of being enthusiastic about having another Disney to add to our collection.",1220572800,40,812,4.676056338028169
3453069,2,B001AIRUO0,"My son saw this and was so excited to get it- he thought it would be a new movie like the Super Sleuth Christmas Movie DVD was.  However, this is just a DVD of some of the regular episodes off the TV show.  I believe there was only 1 episode he hadn't seen on here.  He was very disappointed.

I admit I should have read the back of the DVD better- it does state specifically which 6 episodes are on here.",1220400000,22,405,3.962962962962963
3453080,5,B001AIRUO0,"Out of all the Pooh movie's, this is my sons favorite.  So glad I bought this! Perfect for his age.",1369353600,,99,3.95
3453081,4,B001AIRUO0,"Bought this used as a surprise for my 3 year old. We'd borrowed it from the library before and she loved it. Cute stories and it makes her happy. It is nice to have a fun, smart, inquisitive girl in the Pooh movies. Girls need good role models, too, and my daughter was happy to see a girl in the films.",1362355200,,303,3.9836065573770494
3453082,3,B001AIRUO0,It's a good DVD but not as good as some of the other Tigger and Friends.  Keeps my kiddo entertained though.,1304035200,,108,4.142857142857143
3453083,1,B001AIRUO0,I was in a hurry to purchase another Pooh Halloween DVD for my granddaughter.  I didn't read the other reviews beforehand.  That was a big mistake!  This is definitely NOT A HALLOWEEN DVD as I believed from the title and front cover.  The only Halloween was Handy Mandy and we can't stand him!  An added Bonus it was not.  Buy Pooh's Heffalump Halloween instead.  It's worth the money and we view it a LOT year 'round.,1287878400,4,418,4.421052631578948
3453084,4,B001AIRUO0,"This is more My Friends Tigger & Pooh TV episodes (3 episodes/6 stories) put to DVD, although I hadn't seem them all before.  And like I've stated before, the title has NOTHING to do with what is on them.  There is little Halloween-related on this disc.  The episodes are:  Super-Sized Darby/Piglet's Lightning Frightening; Eeyore's Trip to the Moon/The Incredible Shrinking Roo; and Eeyore's Home Sweet Home/Rabbit's Prized Pumpkin.  Bonus Feature is a Handy Manny Halloween Episode:  Halloween/Squeeze's Magic Show.  Hmm, OK, so the bonus feature is halloween-themed.  And most of these videos have some sort of game or something on them as well.  If your child likes My Fried Tigger & Pooh on Disney Channel, he/she will like this DVD.",1284163200,6,738,5.083333333333333
3453085,5,B001AIRUO0,My daughter is a BIG fan of Tiger and Pooh.  She loves this video.  I recommend this to anyone with young children.,1231200000,,115,4.181818181818182
3453086,1,B001AIRUO0,"I ditto most of the comments here.  The cover of this DVD is SO misleading.  This dvd is NOT a Halloween DVD!  There are not any Halloween episodes of My Friends Tigger & Pooh on here!  They are all re-runs of regular shows.

Very misleading DVD cover and title ""Hundred Acre Wood Haunt"" - This dvd has absolutely nothing to do with Halloween.. we were so disappointed.",1228348800,9,369,4.447761194029851
3453087,2,B001AIRUO0,"I was very disappointed in the ""Hundred Acre Wood Haunt"". We thougt it was going to be a Halloween movie. The cover also lead me to believe it was a movie, in fact, it was episodes of the TV series which we like but again we thought we were buying a Halloween movie. We bought the Heffalump Halloween movie but it is a little too scarry for my 2 year old.",1225843200,6,355,4.014084507042254
3453088,4,B001AIRUO0,"I was a little disappointed because I thought based on the commercials that this would have a new Halloween episode for MFT&P.  However, the episodes that were on the DVD were enjoyable and my daughter didn't seem to mind.",1223337600,3,222,4.6923076923076925
3453089,3,B001AIRUO0,"I agree with a previous review, the cover of this DVD is very misleading.  I also expected stories with a Halloween theme, and was very disappointed with it.  This is my two year old granddaughter's favorite series, and I was looking forward to sharing new Halloween stories with her, but what I got were stories she'd already seen before.  Very disappointing.",1222905600,8,360,4.868852459016393

8277736,1,B001AIRUO0,"My son wanted to watch a Halloween show, so I put this in for him.  What a misleading piece their ""HAUNT"" and ""S-POOH-Ky Fun!"" from the cover was as well as all the photos of ""Halloween pumpkins.""  There are ZERO Halloween episodes on this disc with the one exception of the Handy Manny episode at the very end of the disc (NOT Winnie the Pooh at all).  This is lame.  Totally bait and switch and a disappointment for both me and my son.  Lame.",1444694400,,444,4.238095238095238
