8108386,5,B000ECWYR6,"An absolutely great movie. I was living in the area at the time and this movie is very factual. The scope of Allison was quite large, encompassing areas over 50 miles away, shutting down freeways both in and out of the areas involved. I watched this movie on television after it first came on, and waiting for YEARS to be able to find it again with 'movie on demand'. The cost seemed really high, but it wasn't 'just history'...it was MY history!",1462665600,2,446,4.451219512195122

8108388,5,B000ECWYR6,"A very competent made-for-TV movie, which narrates with unusual fidelity a real event. JoBeth Williams, as usual, is compelling as a most sensitive head nurse. Rick Schroder's character, no doubt fictionally, is endowed with an abrasive personality but, after he raises to the challenge, he comes to terms with his human side. Kris Kristofferson renders his usual just-reading-the-lines petrified acting, but his character does not matter much. The hospital personnel, especially in neonatology, are the real characters driving the action and, on that regard, acting is impeccable by everybody.

The story touches all the right emotional buttons and the music very aptly expresses the drama of this unique episode in Houston's history, that is worth narrating here.

More or less as reported by one of the intervening doctors, rain started falling hard at 6 p.m. Friday, June 8, 2001. Rising water was first noted in Memorial Hermann and Memorial Hermann Children Hospitals, downtown Houston, at around 11 p.m. Brays Bayou could not handle the water which was backing up into the streets. Electrical power failed at 1:40 a.m. and the hospital went to its gas-powered emergency generators, located in the second floor. However, the electrical switchgear flooded in the basement at approximately 2 a.m. An internal hospital disaster was declared at 2:15 a.m. By 3:30 a.m., the hospital was without electrical power, water, or telephone service.

The two Hermann hospitals were designed to be 2 feet above the 100-year flood plain. This level, however, was breached by rising water of at least 2 feet, which crashed through exterior glass and entered the central core of the hospital. In addition, storm drains and manhole covers that were inside the hospital's flood protection zone burst open by water in the storm sewers trying to find a place to go, thereby allowing a tremendous amount of water to pour down the purchasing ramp and directly enter the hospital. Further water entered through pedestrian and utility tunnels, such as the one connecting the hospital with the Hermann Professional Office Building. The water entered the lobby and emptied into the elevator shafts and stairwells, thus reaching the pedestrian tunnel. The floodwater accumulation between the Hermann Professional Office Building garage and basement forced open metal security doors, pouring water into the underground tunnels and allowing floodwater to enter the hospitals. This high pressure water destroyed the pathology laboratory and caused disbursement of medical waste and biohazardous material throughout the hospital basements. The tremendous water volume and pressure significantly damaged the lower 2 levels of MHH/MHCH.

Only one surgical procedure, which was completed safely, was in progress at the time of the switch to generator power. In the ICUs, many of the ventilators did not have batteries and patients receiving ventilatory assistance dependent on electrical power were manually ventilated using an ambu bag. Neonates were kept warm with chemical perineum pads and skin-to-skin contact.

By Saturday morning at 9 a.m., most of the roads into the hospitals were impassable due to street flooding as deep as 5 feet. The decision to begin evacuating patients who were receiving ventilatory assistance was made at approximately 10:30 a.m. and the decision to completely evacuate all patients was made at approximately 2 p.m. In some cases, nursing staff and equipment were sent with patients to hospitals that had available beds but insufficient staff and equipment. Some patients were transported by volunteers down 10 flights of stairs. Patients were secured to backboards for transit, including neonates who were strapped 5 to a board.

Over a span of 31 hours, 169 patients were discharged from the hospital and 406 patients were successfully transferred by ground and air ambulance to 29 hospitals throughout southeast Texas. All 3 hospital helicopters were used along with helicopters from the Coast Guard and the Texas National Army Reserve.

By 3 p.m. on June 10, 2001, the last patient was evacuated.",1262563200,,4105,5.3847352024922115
