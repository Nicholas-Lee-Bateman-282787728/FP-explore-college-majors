8734123,5,B015NYSE1O,"Thomas Edison's Secret Lab introduces scientific concepts in a silly and fun way that gets kids curious about science! This initial release of the series includes eight episodes for a running time of approximately 90 minutes. Your kids will learn about vaccines, corrosion and the periodic table, slime, fossils, manure, body odor/cleanliness, genes and chemistry all in one entertaining DVD compilation. It also includes a music video that correlates with the subject of each episode. My kids were so excited to watch the music videos that they checked them out before viewing the actual episodes; however, I would recommend having them wait until after watching the episodes as they will make much more sense that way. Important scientific figures of the past are introduced when the kids travel through time to gain knowledge and find solutions to the problems they are facing. My kids and I all agree that the It Takes One to Grow One fertilizer music video was our favorite! It has a catchy tune and clever lyrics that will stick in your head for days. We are eagerly awaiting the release of the next DVD in this series!

8734124,5,B015NYSE1O,"Thomas Edison's Secret Lab is a fun, educational adventure that had me humming songs about science for days. I like this show because it makes science a lot more fun. Its a series about four kids who solve problems using all kinds of science. One of my favorite parts of the show is the relationship between the characters. I like that they would nearly do anything to keep each other safe throughout the show.

The Secret Lab Meeting is a collection of different episodes from the television series that teaches children cool stuff. The main characters are the kids in the lab, Kent, Angie, JD, and Nicky. With the help of their hologram of Thomas Edison and their robot Von Bolt they can solve nearly anything, from a zombie virus to a slime monster and even stinky teenagers.

My favorite character is Thomas Edison because he is very smart and he is always willing to help the kids. Hes wise and stays calm during a crisis. My favorite episode is If The Fossil Fits because its about dinosaurs and dinosaurs are really cool and studying them can teach you a lot about archeology.

My least favorite episode is Dunkin Zombies. Its the first episode in the collection but there is no introduction to the characters and I had trouble figuring out the characters and the story line for a while. I like the second episode No Volts For Von Bolt because of how they explain the elements by introducing a fake police department that specializes in cases involving elements from the periodic table. Its a great genre flip from the modern-day setting to the feeling of an old school detective show.

In the third episode, we see the crew from the lab use the virtual reality room to travel back in time and meet someone who contributed to science. A cartoon Louis Pasteur makes a cameo appearance to teach the kids how to melt slime to destroy a monster. I like the balance between the history and the action scenes.

The history in this show is really cool and educational. The people the kids meet when they travel back in time have accomplished very interesting feats to help science and its progress. One example is Jonas Salk who created the vaccine for polio.

Each episode has a different topic from chemistry to agriculture and even cloning. At the end of each episode, there is a fun little song recapping all the major vocabulary from the episode. I recommend this series for ages 7 to 11. Younger kids might not understand the more complicated science lessons. I give Thomas Edison's Secret Lab 3 out of 5 stars. Reviewed by Benjamin P.
