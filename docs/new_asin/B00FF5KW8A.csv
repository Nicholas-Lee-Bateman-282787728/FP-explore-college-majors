5986520,5,B00FF5KW8A,An interesting documentary about how bin laden was tracked down and the patience that was involved over the years to get him,1395273600,,124,4.681818181818182
5986521,5,B00FF5KW8A,It's absolutely a true story. These are the people who hunted him down and we're not left guessing. It's how it happened.,1394928000,,121,4.545454545454546
5986522,3,B00FF5KW8A,The Peter Bergen and Peter Arnet interview of OBL distracts from the Manhunt story.  It looks more self glorification for them,1392595200,,126,5.0

5986524,5,B00FF5KW8A,I am a history fanatic and found this documentary very interesting and worthwhile. This gives you a real inside look of the people that spent years searching for Bin Laden. It was fascinating and I highly recommend!,1391644800,,215,4.837837837837838
5986525,5,B00FF5KW8A,"Required viewing for those who care about the real stories of many devoted public servants who risked their lives and a few who lost them, in the pursuit not only of Al Qaeda but the related spiraling networks of terrorism they have spawned internationally.  HBO and Manhunt Director, Greg Barker, have courageously corrected the record and brought recognition to the extraordinary women analysts of the ""Sisterhood"" who pursued answers with unrelenting commitment and self-sacrifice, much akin to the women code breakers of Bletchley Park who helped changed the course of WWII, among other historic acts of hero(ine)ism.",1388880000,5,621,5.402061855670103

I would recommend it to anyone who wants to learn more about what the CIA does.  I have to say that I think the FBI agent that was going on and on about the waterboarding seemed to have some personal issues with that, like maybe he identified too closely to those prisoners.",1458000000,,417,4.3896103896103895

5986533,5,B00FF5KW8A,If you can make it past the bias of the western tale it is indeed an interesting story. Its amazing to me how bureaucracy often gets in the way of the little guy trying to do his job and how it may have actually led to letting 9/11 happen. People high up in intelligence covering their ass and ignoring what people on the ground were trying to tell them and then when it happens having the little guy crucified in order to save themselves from embarrassment of being inept.,1455580800,,473,4.325842696629214

Documentary format shows the personalities and skills of the key analysts who put the puzzle pieces together and ultimately helped find and eliminate Bin Laden.  Most of these analysts were women.  They had a clear understanding of Bin Laden's intent long before 9-11-2001.  Interviews are mixed with good fill-in film documentation of the havoc Bin Laden's network was hitting the Middle East with.  Gripping presentation.

5986540,1,B00FF5KW8A,"Both this documentary and Bergen's book fail to address Alec Station conduct in regard to al-Hazmi and al-Mihdhar. Until the public understands that conduct the entire war on terror will continue to be misunderstood. Barker and CIA sources exploit public ignorance to push a narrative of dedicated CIA agents who were on point only to be unfairly blamed by politicians and the public.

There is a pretty good documentary about the '98 embassy bombings on Amazon. Kirk Lippold wrote a good book about the Cole attack. The story the public was told states that al-Hazmi and al-Mihhdar were linked to both of these attacks by way of the Yemen hub and the so called al Qaeda terrorist meeting in Kuala Lumpur in January 2000. I would ask anyone to watch the embassy bombing documentary, read the Cole book and then explain how it makes any sense that al-Hazmi and al-Mihdhar were free to roam the US from January 2000 until 9/11.

In the current political climate the media suggests that citizens who question the government in regard to 9/11 are somehow out of line or may even be insulting the 9/11 victims. Out of line? Did members of the public withhold information about known al Qaeda operatives for two years? Did members of the public abuse national security classification procedures to keep the public ignorant about the bizarre pre-9/11 conduct? Did members of the public make the case that terrorist attacks could only be prevented by granting the intelligence agencies police state powers?",1447200000,2,1498,4.91699604743083

5986568,5,B00FF5KW8A,I had this film stored on my DVR for quiet some time and deleted it.  I immediately regretted not having it around to queue up and re-watch.

5986572,5,B00FF5KW8A,This is a must see documentary on how the US intelligence services tracked down and killed Osama bin Laden.

5986581,5,B00FF5KW8A,"This is a compelling documentary told from the ""inside.""  Of course I never thought that the CIA woke up on 4.30.2011 and said ""Let's get Bin Laden,"" but I did NOT know the years spent tracking him, nor did I know the meticulousness of the tracking.  The people, for whom finding OBL became their 24/7 mission, are impressive.  I am sure I am not alone in learning how many women trackers / analysts were responsible for locating OBL.  They are the unheralded, dedicated team that made it possible for Seal Team 6 to conduct that final, dangerous raid.  My favorite quote from the film is the trackers' response to the question, ""Why didn't you connect the dots?""  Answer:  ""Because the board was black.""  ""Manhunt"" is fascinating, riveting stuff, and a must-see for those the least bit curious about how the mission was accomplished.",1417478400,,834,4.783216783216783

5986584,3,B00FF5KW8A,"A great insight to the people that found Bin Laden before SEAL Team Six did. Long on interviews and short on reenactments, we meet the analysts that that made finding Bin Laden their life's work. From the early days of Al-Qaeda's formation during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan to the raid on Bin Laden's hideout in Abbottabad, Pakistan, this film documents the tireless efforts of a small group within the CIA to convince government and military leaders of the emerging threat prior to 9-11 and their subsequent task of finding Bin Laden after.

5986585,5,B00FF5KW8A,Interesting points of view,1413676800,,26,5.75
5986586,1,B00FF5KW8A,"I've only watched 5 minutes of this show and already want to shut it off due to the gross overstatements, complete inventions, and distortions of the truth.  We, the US government, created the world terrorist momentum, starting with our involvement in Afghanistan when the Soviets were in the region.  Where is the mention of this and how we just abandoned a shattered country to the devises of foreign governments (Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Iran, etc), criminals, gangs, warlords, and warring ethnic & tribal societies.

The intelligence community is inept due to many reasons.  At the forefront is the closed minded mentalities of the people running it and the lack of professionals with a true international understanding.  The bureaucratic nature (political gaming) of everything government is another massive hindrance to any kind of effective and progressive intelligence service(s).  True innovative thought is frowned upon or crushed.  Passion is also a big no no.  Collaboration is so minimal that it's no wonder that our ""people"" are less than capable at ""truly"" solving (or even identifying) problems.  More to the point, we've created more problems that we've ever solved (wittingly and unwittingly).  We created Osama Bin Laden and vast majority of the competent operators in the region without thinking anything through ahead of time.  We involved ourselves in all these conflicts without any clue as to what we were doing and now wonder why all this ""craziness"" is happening all over the world.

This show is ridiculous.  There is very scanty actual fact to this documentary.  Credit is given to such a small number of people and none given to the people who really deserved credit.  The problem with our organizations is false preconceptions, bias, arrogance, lack of interest in anything that is not ""American"", and most importantly - information hording.  The inaccuracies are so drastic that it would take a book to truly comment responsibly.  We made our bed and continuously refuse to admit or address our mistakes.

You want to make a difference?  Replace the leadership (ours), hire people who are patriotic but not blind (who really want to make a difference and save lives) without political motivation; hire people with actual international minds and experience (preferably those who have lived overseas and speak at least one foreign language at a native level of proficiency), who have the ability to think like foreigners, to put one's feet in the shoes of our adversaries, whomever they may be.  Stop looking for a head to chop off and instead look for the cause and the reasons behind ill acts and ill-will.

Osama Bin Laden is gone...SOOO WHAT?? What did that do, other than give a few of us a sense of grim satisfaction?  Did it change anything?  No it did not.  We have to change the very foundation of our understanding and the way we address issues, especially foreign matters.  Changing the fundamental mind-sets of our people and leaders will lead to the beginning of a new age of creating a lasting peace through understanding.

PS, the ""debriefers"" mentioned in this were not the ones who knew the most about the subject matters (the vast majority of the SMEs had no contact, through no fault of their own, with those they desperately needed to speak with).

Wow...this show is so off, it's scary.  Please don't listen to this junk.  Go figure, put a guy, whose experience is South America, in charge of middle east CT operations...that's a smart way to go (no language ability, no cultural knowledge, nothing...south American problem sets are a world apart from this one; but here was another trend of the intelligence leadership...bring in ""experts"" who have nooooo actual expertise in issues at hand)....

These guys talking about Bin Laden are clueless...guessing where ""UBL"" was, based on other guesses and hearsay...now there's some real ""intelligence"".

Wow...there we go...targeting...looking for one target with one name and take him/her out.  Talk about the completely wrong way to look at this problem-set.  Kinetic targeteers are one of the biggest mistakes we made.  Chopping a head off knowing it's going to create 10 more...brilliant (and if you didn't know it...you really shouldn't have been doing this job).

Also, creating targets that we aren't absolutely sure are ""bad guys""...soooo smart...then kill them and act bewildered why the result was an entire clan that was pro-US...now chanting ""death to America"".

I'm sick to my stomach, listening to these people who talk about people (terrorists) that they never met, as if they were intimately involved...acting like they knew them...ridiculous.  I'm now over an hour into this program and have yet to hear or see a single actual expert on anything.

Talking about Iraq...I warned against the ""surge"" and the creation of ""sons of Iraq"".  I actually warned against the invasion as a whole.  What did you think was going to happen when you trained and armed an uncontrollable tribal group with their own goals and agendas and then left them under control of a hostile government?  Warning after warning...ignored.  Of course, the surge provided an amplification in policing ability, but once it was gone...and after we withdrew...exactly as I  predicted...As I predicted, Iraq is close to fracturing at the seems and violence/instability is worse than ever.

You really want to make a difference?  Discredit the groups and personalities, unravel the thread that binds these groups.  Their alleged faith!!!!  This massive pillar they claim as the reason for their conflict.  Take it away and they are nothing but a group of politically motivated activists or sociopaths, comprised mostly of wealthy, educated people who are bored (this represents the majority of the leadership), or those lacking economic opportunity (this represents the majority).  They use Islam (the leadership...and as a result so does some of the following), strategically, as the foundation and reason for their ""struggle"" in order to legitimize themselves on the world stage.  They claim to be waging Holy Jihad (lesser), armed conflict, but they have no leg to stand on in terms of religious authority and legal merit (there is law, which must be followed for declaring greater or lesser Jihad.  On most counts they have broken this Islamic law by declaring Jihad or armed conflict against an ambiguous enemy known as the west without having met the legal requirements to declare such an act)...Take away their credibility instead of reinforcing it...starting with NOT calling them by what they call themselves...enlisting religious authorities around the world to examine and discredit them on an Islamic legal, spiritual, and emotional level...re-label them (the leadership) as heretics and misguided maniacs and the rest as poor, unfortunate people lacking in opportunity to live their life, who have been misled for the benefit of a few fanatical politicians.  That's where you start.  You globally discredit them on a moral, ethical, and religious level, amplifying their ignorance and lack of actual religious credibility...then go from there (I could go on and on).

I really can't write anymore, since I'll be here all day, week, month...  PLEASE DON'T VIEW THIS VIDEO AS FACT...IT IS FRAGMENTS OF TRUTH, COMBINED TO CREATE AN IMPRESSION WHICH IS IN FACT HIGHLY ERRONEOUS AND MISLEADING.

Please note that this is just a comment and not a paper, I have not revised my comments and there may be (likely are) grammatical and spelling (even thinking pattern) mistakes.",1412985600,4,7555,5.162695152013147

5986600,5,B00FF5KW8A,Interesting to see all the behind the scenes work going on.  All we usually see are navy seals. And they did a great job at what they do but it was a real pleasure to hear from the real people and real intelligence to make stuff happen.,1408320000,,236,4.0212765957446805

5986602,4,B00FF5KW8A,Very interesting and informative.  My only gripe on it was that it was a little slow,1407283200,,84,4.25

5986604,1,B00FF5KW8A,"Uh...yea.  Well.  We live in a very unique country with some very unique ideas, Ideas that were trashed and shamed by the '12 techniques' It is unfortunate that those who warn us that others will come because of this is so true.  We do not understand them at all and therefore can only react with singularly disgusting tactics.  The fact is that the CIA was at fault for what happened, not because they failed to discern that 9/11 was going to happen but because they failed to understand the real people behind the event.  The CIA and the people who would trash the very things they try to protect will face this time and time again because they do nothing but react.",1406505600,,668,4.442622950819672

5986606,4,B00FF5KW8A,It was good but I was expecting more.,1405123200,,37,3.75
5986607,5,B00FF5KW8A,"As one of the other interviewers has stated, this is one of the best if not the best no hold bars documentary on terrorism and the CIA's role in it.  The people were honest to the core on what happened and how it effected them.  Your see the human side of these people and just how hard their job was.  I wasn't surprised that even though many worked night and day and in my opinion, not taken seriously back in the nineties when their were practically shouting out about the danger we were in.
When we were attacked it was the same old Washington game.  Someone had to feed the beast. The work and dedication these analysts put into keeping the U.S. safe was quickly overlooked.
I recommend any U.S. adult citizen watch this film.",1405036800,,731,4.392592592592592
5986608,4,B00FF5KW8A,"I had seen this documentary before, but liked it better this time around.  It is pretty interesting listening to the actual people that were part of the team that found Bin Laudin.  If you have never watched this documentary before then it is worth your time.",1404259200,2,259,4.608695652173913
5986609,5,B00FF5KW8A,"The interviews with the actual people involved made this documentary engaging and relevant.  Having no other source for inside information on these events I presume this is an objective reporting.

This title covers the story of discovering bin Laden and his role in escalating events around the middle east, and the world.  It includes his demise.  But mostly its about the heroes in the CIA that did their job even if few upstream folks understood what they did or appreciated it till that fateful day on 9/11.  WE don't often, if ever, hear the story from inside the CIA.

This title should be of interest to historians, those interested in how the CIA functions, people wanting a clinical but fascinating view of 9/11 and its back story, people who like spy stories, and anyone wanting to learn from history.  Which we haven't shown ourselves capable of yet.  So that last category of viewer alone should make this the #1 title streamed/watched or purchased on Amazon.",1403222400,,972,4.848484848484849
5986610,5,B00FF5KW8A,Very interesting. Read the book previously.  HBO documentaries are always of excellent quality.  This one is no different.  XXX XXX,1403222400,,131,5.45
5986611,5,B00FF5KW8A,"Such great insight into the people that worked behind the scenes to look for Bin Laden.  Though this particular recap was specific to the CIA, it can provide a new perspective for professions where ""hidden"" departments perform mission critical tasks to complete what the world sees as a sexy payoff.",1403136000,,299,4.98
5986612,5,B00FF5KW8A,"We got Bin Laden, now find out how from honest and in-depth interviews from those who tracked him. Rodriguez, the head CIA official talks a bit on waterboarding as well, saying that that and slapping are barely forms of torture and I have to agree. It had to be done and worked. There was one sad instance that happened to several CIA agents that I wasn't aware of. I won't explain it here if your not aware and plan to see the film. Manhunt follows the hunt before the 9/11 crashes began and takes us through to his capture and death. If your at all interested in how these brave members infiltrated Al Qaeda this is one to see. Note, unfortunately, they don't explain in detail the actual raid of Seal Team 6. Zero Dark Thirty did a great job of that though. But, I did find this doc more appealing than the movie.",1402358400,,816,4.305194805194805
5986613,5,B00FF5KW8A,"Quite enjoyed this...while some of the people featured are a bit dubious I guess that's the nature
of the beast but I have huge respect for Peter Bergen and not to forget many of the unsung heroes, especially the women, who
worked tirelessly and relentlessly year after year at great sacrifice to finally bring Bin Laden to Justice...",1402012800,5,334,4.775862068965517

5986615,5,B00FF5KW8A,"An excellent documentary about the 20 year search to discovery what the jihadist threat is, and who was behind it, and then to capture (kill) him.  It's intriguing factually, and alerting about the persistent threats facing us.",1401235200,,227,5.135135135135135
5986616,5,B00FF5KW8A,"This was not a Hollywood ""action"" type film. So if you're looking for explosions and guns go somewhere else.  What this film documented was the real behind the scenes details of how Bin Laden was able to be found. Reality, not fiction. The actual CIA investigators were interviewed in detail. The ups and downs that occurred over more than a decade were discussed.. It was a little seen look at the real story. A refreshing view for a change.",1401062400,4,442,4.594936708860759
5986617,5,B00FF5KW8A,I had seen the movie on tv and I found it to be most interesting. So I ordered a copy for my buddy to see it also. He was very glad to view this movie because he does not have a tv with movie channels.,1396396800,,201,3.488888888888889

8615119,2,B00FF5KW8A,"Unwatchable. Fuzzy fade-ins. Inky fade-ins. Fuzzy and shaky camera action. Dingy music. Fast cuts. Should have been done with more room tone and several cameras at different distances. Seems like they cheaped out and tried to keep the production costs down. I quit after five minutes.

8615121,5,B00FF5KW8A,"You have to have a lot of respect for our intelligence community (unsung heroes really). No doubt there are real threats towards us in general. I took away that there is a real human cost both personally and collectively fighting evil. That really is what terrorists represent. A total breakdown in accessing reality and finding a constructive way forward. Unfortunately I do not believe evil will ever just go away, and we owe a real debt of gratitude to the women and men who wage this battle on our behave. I totally agree with the comment that this war is better fought behind the scenes. Give the enemy nothing (meaning more motivation than they already have). Hopefully we learn the lessons from the past twenty years and adapt. We know why there was a breakdown in information dissemination, and we also know what techniques generally have the most effectiveness, and we need to be like a shadow in the night, not publicizing our moves. And of course really understand the problem (history and culture). Is there something we are doing wrong or is this just flat out evil. With respect to the intelligence community. Good work.",1524268800,,1134,4.790816326530612
8615122,5,B00FF5KW8A,Yes Im pleased.  Had seen this doc before on HBO and think it is one of the better documentaries on this overall topic.  The DVD arrived very timely and in great shape!  Thank you,1511395200,,179,4.205882352941177
8615123,5,B00FF5KW8A,"PLOT: close up look at how and who helped find Bin Laden.

This is a docudrama. Excellent computer graphics show the progress of the finding Osama Bin Laden. They go back and interview many of the original CIA people who actually tracked Bin Laden. Most were women. My only comment to clarify is that many times the editing was uneven and you kind of lost the focus from time to time due to this. The CIA analysts talk about the trail that took over 10 years to complete. The computer graphics are first rate and added to the total story of the discovery via his courier. And the final Seal Team raid on his compound and his death. Interesting and well done.",1497657600,,658,4.39344262295082
