8347163,5,B001W4BU2A,"Based on a true story and starring the very same people involved in it, this movie (by first time director Samira Makhmalbaf) tells the story of Zahra and Massoumef, twelve year old twins living on a very humble neighborhood in Tehran. Virtually imprisoned in their own home by their impoverished, ignorant, fundamentalist father and blind mother, they were freed by Iran social services after neighbours complained that the children had not bathed and could not speak. Makhmalbaf shows the twins attempting to function beyond their parents' wall after the social workers have intervened. Their lack social skills is such that they don't know that they have to pay for food. Made when she was just 17 years old (probably with some help from her father, the acclaimed Iranian director Mohsen Makhmalbaf) this film stands very well in the Iranian tradition of social realist, humanist cinema that came out beginning in the mid 1980s. Its so moving, it will be hard for you not to cry while watching it.",1397865600,,1000,4.958333333333333
8347164,5,B001W4BU2A,"The inspirational roots of this film may be found in the very core of the Italian Neo Realism. No doubt it. But it's such the level of poetry and heartbreaking portrait of two little girls who have lived eleven years totally isolated from the outer world, that it will be hard for you not to watch it from start to finish. Their father is a selfish man who argues that having his wife blind, justifies to himself this horrid fact. The awful situation will carry the neighbors to dennounce this anormal situation.

Watch this single but poignant story. A true winner film not to be missed!!!",1376352000,,590,4.566037735849057
