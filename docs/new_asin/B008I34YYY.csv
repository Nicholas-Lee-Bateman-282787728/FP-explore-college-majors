5166324,4,B008I34YYY,"Of all the movies about Moon Nazis, this is definately one of them.

I don't watch many B movies, but I have to say I enjoyed this movie.

Pretty stupid, and the plot had holes, and at the end, I didn't care at all about the characters, but overall, it was worth my time and I will watch it again sometime when I am a little more awake.

The effects are great for a movie like this.  I expected something more along the lines of the Trek fanfilms, but it is much better than that.  20 years ago, this would have been the type of effects that would have made Lucas jealous.  The weird thing about it is that when the movie starts, the effects are fairly horrid, but once the plot starts moving, the effects look really good.  Some of the CGI model complexity is impressive.  In fact, I would say overall the makers of the Atlas Shrugged films should look to these effects guys for their films.  Atlas Shrugged Part 1 suffered much more from effects than this film did.",1342483200,4,967,4.269230769230769
5166325,3,B008I34YYY,"While this film was being made, a few teaser clips were released onto YouTube. From the fans' comments on these, it seems that many of them ""wanted the Nazis to win."" Even this reviewer hoped that this independent film might do what no Hollywood film will ever do -- give a neutral, or at least a thoughtful examination of the National Socialist Weltanschauung. But that opportunity was missed.

It's blindingly obvious that this film is a spoof. Indeed, some of its themes, that are so forcefully imposed onto present-day Western society, are portrayed in such ""over the top"" fashion that I wonder whether the director is slyly hinting at how ridiculous they really are. For example:--

i) Moon Nazis Oberfhrer Klaus Adler and Earthologist Renate Richter are a couple well aware of their Aryan racial compatibility, and their destiny to have children of the highest racial quality. However both are subsequently attracted, without a second thought, to members of other races, fully conforming to the tired old stereotypes of ""blonde White woman + Black man"" and ""White man + Asian woman.""

ii) Black astronaut James Washington knows that the primary reason he was chosen for the first US mission to the moon in 50 years is because he is (in his own opinion) ""pretty."" He is actually a male model. Technical competence is evidently not required -- an obvious reference to the political correctness that has now overwhelmed the US space program, or what passes for one these days.

iii) With reference to the ""racial differences are only skin deep"" diktat, and with a nod perhaps to Jewish author Maurice Samuel's view that you cannot ""make an Aryan of a negro by painting him with ochre,"" the moon Nazis inject Washington with ""Albinisierer,"" which turns his skin white. Thereafter, they regard him as an Aryan!

There are other examples, some subtle, others not. Most moon Nazis have ridiculous titles and incongruous names. (""Adler"" is a typically Jewish surname. His Asian would-be lover and subsequent enemy is Vivian Wagner, presumably named after that most ""anti-semitic"" classical composer).

While the film generally moves along at a good pace, and the CGI effects are often impressive given the film's small budget, any attempt to take it even semi-seriously must run up against the question: ""Why would National Socialists who have escaped to the moon want anything more to do with Earth?"" Although Renate Richter has a nave, proselytising view of National Socialism (""... when we return to those who need our help""), surely Nazis possessing a viable Space Drive would have used it decades ago to move outwards, and to begin to colonise the galaxy. For them, the decaying, degenerate, dishonest, dishonorable and increasingly lethal Earth would surely be strictly quarantined, as an excellent object lesson in what happens to a planet that has repudiated National Socialism.",1341360000,2,2884,5.0738396624472575
5166326,4,B008I34YYY,"Film is awesome.  Downfall spoof was funny.
Blu-Ray has a problem with the 'Promo' sub-menu.  All the links in the sub-menu do not work.  I'm guessing that these are the web trailers.  The movie, trailer and making of menus all work.  Disappointed with the making of portion: a little over 16 minutes of the film being shot.  No commentary or dialogue, even subtitled non-English commentary would have been appreciated (movie also).  Given the price, the BD was a little skimpy on extras.",1341273600,6,488,4.878048780487805
5166327,3,B008I34YYY,"The publicity material for this film might give some the false impression that it is to some extent an adventure movie, if a tongue-in-cheek one. It isn't. ""Iron Sky"" is black comedy from beginning to end. It has moments of genuine comic genius, though to get to them you have to watch a fair amount of material that is very silly indeed.

Any supporters of the GOP ""Tea Party"" or fans of Governor Sarah Palin should probably avoid this unless your sense of humour is extremely good at laughing with or at people who are ridiculing things you believe in. And anyone who had assumed, from the way this film is advertised as a battle against a nazi threat, that it would be an opportunity to enjoy a guilt-free heroic battle against a dangerous and utterly evil foe - a bit like a film version of David Drake's novel ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fortress/dp/0812536207/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fortress</a>"" which was recently republished in ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Loose-Cannon-The-Tom-Kelly-Novels/dp/1451637942/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Loose Cannon: The Tom Kelly Novels</a>"" may be rather disappointed.

We are told at the beginning of the film that it is 2018. There is a new female US President, (played by Stephanie Paul), who is in the middle of her first term and campaigning for re-election. Stephanie Paul and the producers of the film go out of their way to indicate in almost every possible way other than actually using her name, that the President is based on Sarah Palin. It would probably be fairer to say, on a caricature of Sarah Palin as those who are least fond of the former Alaska governor might see her.

The President has re-started the Apollo programme, and the U.S. astronauts who land on the far side of the moon are horrified to run into a moonbase full of nazis.

Apparently in 1945 elements of Hitler's third reich escaped to the moon, and for seventy years have been rebuilding their strength, ready to strike back ...

Don't switch off before the end of the credits. When the camera starts to pan out as the hero and heroine embrace at the end of the film, their location is seen from further and further away, e.g. from out in space. As the first credits appear on the screen something rather important can be seen happening if you watch the earth closely. At the very end of the credits another image appears in the camera view which appears to be meant as a hint about where the future of the human race lies.

Several of the best jokes in the film are inspired by the Charlie Chaplain film ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Great-Dictator/dp/B004DHNQGQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Great Dictator</a>"" which is openly referred to in ""The Iron Sky."" There is also an obvious parody of the section of the film ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Downfall-Blu-ray/dp/B001BHTN90/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Downfall [Blu-ray</a>]"" which has inspired a thousand Youtube spoofs.

The film sends up politicians in general, not just openly Nazi ones - partly by drawing attention to the parallels between the actions of world leaders in general and those of NSDAP leaders.

I don't want to give away the jokes in the film, but another point to watch out for is that the viewer should watch closely, immediately after the President gives the name of the USA's space warship, for the way that name is written on the side of the ship.

In more than one place in ""The Iron Sky"" there were things which would clearly have been a mistake or bad acting in a more serious film, but I wasn't sure whether the people who made this one were sending themselves up as a joke. For example, Gotz Otto, who plays the main Nazi character in the film, deputy fuhrer Klaus Adler, appears to have modelled his performance on the nazis from the UK TV show ""Allo Allo"" (Link:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Allo-Allo-The-Complete-Collection/dp/B001B3LIQU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">'Allo 'Allo! The Complete Collection</a>) set in occupied France, particularly Herr Flick.

Indeed, all the actors who play the Nazis from the moon in this film seem to have modelled their performances on characters from ""Allo Allo.""

The special effects are reasonably well done, though again I wasn't certain whether the film-makers had overlooked certain basic laws of physics or were sending themselves up. one example would be spaceships which were converted Zeppelins. The example I gave in the first draft of this review, which has sparked a vigorous debate in the comments (see below) was that handguns which appear identical to WWII german luger pistols appear to work perfectly well on the moon - in extremely low temperatures, one sixth gravity, and the absence of an atmosphere. And with the recoil not affecting those who fire them in the moon's one sixth gravity any differently from how it would on earth. There are an amazing range of comments on this from people who probably know a lot more about guns than I do, though I'm not aware than any of the Apollo missions tested it by firing a gun on the moon. I had the impression that the creators of this film were not aiming at realistic depiction of the science of such issues, they were simply having a laugh.

Whatever else you may say about it, this film is certainly different. There were points while watching it when I was quite literally rolling around laughing. There were other points when I was on the verge of getting up and turning it off. I suspect this will be one of those films which some people love and others hate.",1341014400,72,5701,5.205016357688113
5166328,3,B008I34YYY,"Having finally and just watched ""Iron Sky"" I am compelled to record my reactions to this unique film.  First, it has achieved a significant cinematic achievement with a limited budget.  The special effects are impressive, if technically flawed (see below).  All of the individual actor performances are great.  It is a dark comedy drama, with campy and kitschy film history references.  I laughed along at various segments, as did my fellow viewing audience.  The story arc rivets one's attention and is engaging, at least to a certain point beginning near the last quarter of the film.
However, it is a flawed film both technically and based on the expectations of a significant segment of the online crowd support that had built momentum for this project over the past several years around the world.  A lot of these expectations were centered around how a fascist militaristic society on the Moon with a 1945 baseline of German weaponry - with a given significant edge of a revolutionary aerospace propulsion system - could evolve over the course of some seven decades along analog lines and how this capability would react with today's terrestrial digital military systems in combat.
First of all, it should be recognized that the film's central premise that Germany developed advanced aircraft of a disc/flying wing configuration during World War 2 is based upon a core of truth and is not some crazed nonsense.  Much of the details of these developments have been muddied over the decades by layers of misinformation and disinformation, but there is little doubt that revolutionary German aerospacecraft were under development by the end of the war and these developments were likely continued by the victorious powers after 1945.  For a highly readable fictionalized account of these achievements, based upon prodigious documented research, see W.A. Harbinson's landmark novel ""Genesis"" and his follow-up Projekt Saucer series and a non-fiction treatment of the subject.
Now, the basic technical and military flaws of the film:
1. German soldiers (Waffen SS) are once again portrayed as robotic bowling pins that can be knocked down in droves, while the reality is that during the war they outperformed the Western Allies with a combat effectiveness ratio of 2.5/1 or more and the Soviets at greater than 5/1.
2.  The flying discs in the film were single stage to orbit hypersonic vehicles, something no nation on Earth, except perhaps the United States with a limited capacity with the supposed secret Aurora project, have achieved.  These vehicles would have an inherent fantastic acceleration capability and could not be shot down by vehicles such as the sluggish USAF A-10 Warthog - they would simple zip away and attack from a stand-off distance.  This is simple physics and cannot be argued away.
3. The Moon Nazi's technologies are portrayed as highly evolved electromechanical analog systems developed along independent lines from Earth's increasing capacities in digital systems.  However, even with basic communications monitoring systems the Moon Nazis would have been aware of Earth's developments and developed at least rudimentary countermeasures.
4. The asteroid bombs shown being deployed by the ""space Zeppelins"" could devastate entire nations with an impact energy equivalent to millions of megatons of TNT directed to predetermined targets on Earth - this threat alone of hyper 9-11 consequences would result in widespread capitulation in today's socially networked and interdependent world.
5. Absolutely no nation on Earth today, or in four year's time in 2018, have the type of deep space and military vehicle space capability suddenly demonstrated near the end of the film.  The US today is in fact dependent upon 1950s level Russian space technology to send astronauts to the International Space Station.  NASA's budget has been devastated by the Obama administration and China is emerging as the world's leading space power.
By ignoring these details, what could have been a true science fiction classic, will now be likely remembered along the lines of Dino De Laurentiis' amusing but syrupy version of ""Flash Gordon""...",1341014400,3,4153,5.2712121212121215
5166329,1,B008I34YYY,"For the unaware, here's the jist: in the twilight of WW2, the tattered remnants of the Nazi party escaped to the dark side of the moon, where they've been building spacecraft and plotting their revenge ever since. It's obviously intended as a blunt parody, but lord is it ham-fisted and dim-witted. Loaded with bland, easy puns and flat punchlines, it's satire in the same vein as Meet the Spartans. The film is set in the year 2018, so naturally the president is played by a porn-grade Sarah Palin impersonator. After reaching office on the back of a ""Yes She Can"" campaign, her big re-election effort involves sending a new mission to the moon, with a black captain, which is publicized as ""Black to the Moon!"" These are the big-laugh moments. Amidst such broad strokes, a few good bits do manage to slip in (there's something about a space zeppelin that's oddly hilarious), but they're like tiny dots of light lost amidst the hustle of a smeared canvas. I may have cracked a smile once or twice, but I groaned more times than I could count, and when it was all over I felt like apologizing to myself. There's a place for this brand of comedy in the world, I guess, but it's not with me.",1340236800,9,1189,4.534883720930233
5166330,5,B008I34YYY,"This movie is a hit around the world except in The USA!....I'll buy it from the British if i have too...but it amazes me how slack distribution companies in the USA have not featured this as one of the best new movies of the year....Tell me it is coming soon, please!",1339977600,43,267,4.254901960784314
5166331,4,B008I34YYY,"Very silly, a tad forced in places, and who gives a crap? Pure, B movie fun, as was intended. Amazing effects considering their $10 million budget. This movie was silly, had a message but delivered it with the subtlety of a giant rubber mallet. It was the funnest load of crap I've ever watched. Highly recommended.

All things considered, it has great spacial effects, decent actors, a good script.... One of my favorite 'B' Sci Fi films of all time!",1339718400,126,288,4.5576923076923075
5166333,4,B008I34YYY,"Oh where to begin. This movie pokes fun at everyone and everything. It's the near future, and a Sarah Palin type is now President. Her campaign slogan? ""Yes we did!"" The moon mission crew was picked for racial diversity, not skill.  The movie is way over-the-top and often laugh-out-loud hilarious. Some of the key plot points could have been fleshed out more, and the F&uuml;hrer had few lines. He is the only actor in the movie you'll recognize (Udo Kier - the head vampire from ""Blade""), and is really under-utilized.

The special effects are great, the space battles and invasion have some insanely funny moments.

The NAZI's are at home in the deadly lunar environment, most of the moon population is oblivious to the real moon-NAZI agenda and WWII history, and purity laws govern all procreation. There is actually some subtlety here, especially the way a population can be manipulated when the ruling class controls education, entertainment, news - everything.

I really don't want to ruin the movie with spoilers. Get it - watch it. The only thing that really ticked me off was the soundtrack. It was the identical Wagner music (Ride of the Valkyries and the Immolation scene from G&ouml;tterd&auml;mmerung) over and over - fine the first couple of times. The 20th? Now way. What happened to Laibach? There was no metal anywhere in the soundtrack. I was picturing a head-banging Laibach score complimenting space battles and the invasion of Earth. Nope. Wagner. I like Wagner. But not on what felt like a repetitive loop for the entire movie!

Music aside, you'll really enjoy this movie. Julia Dietze is hot, Peta Sergeant is made up as a Russ Meyer inspired dream, the president is, er, bizarre.

The same company produced the indie film ""Star Wreck"" - a Star Trek / Babylon 5 mashup. Much of Iron Sky draws from this, and I wish it did not - if you're tempted to see Star Wreck, wait until after you see Iron Sky.",1339372800,2,1924,4.762762762762763

It combines the look of hardcore sci-fi movies like ""Metropolis"" with modern effects (at least as good, if not better, than movies like ""Starship Troopers""), but a heavy dose of comedy in the Mel Brooks ""Comedic Nazi"" tradition.

Early in the movie, there is a scene where a modern cellphone given to the Einstein character places it inside of a ""Gotterdamerung"" (God-damned) machine.  Hundreds of giant gears are set in motion which turn just a few teeth before the cellphone battery goes dead.  What a ridiculous premise.

5166383,3,B008I34YYY,"I was looking forward to this immensely and was thus somewhat dissapointed. My first inkling of what I thought was post war Nazi nonsense was a comic book called Space Western comics #44 with Nazi's in space. It all seemed laughable at the time I had this comic book. Later researching for a book I found some UFO's spotted in history had Nazi markings, and theories exist and / or eyewitness accounts of a Nazi base in Antarctica. As out there as it sounds to some, the possibility seemed plausible enough and there are genuine reasons to consider this possibility as real. Furthermore there are  conspiracy' believers out there that I'm sure think this concept is a genuine possibility too. Consider Alternative 3 and the expedition to Antarctica in 1946 suggesting strongly the governments of the world took this threat seriously as well.  Even the Russians admitted Hitler was not dead after the war. So when I saw this movie existed, I was all over it. But the writers seemed to take the idea as a lark and the whole movie was somewhat tongue and cheek. Much more could have been done with this idea had the writers taken the concept seriously. Like giving the viewer historical reasons to believe or grasp why the theory is even out there:  A preface of historical background would have added genuine shivers down peoples spines as they grasped the concept as not only plausibly genuine and thus frightful, but would consequently have riveted the viewers to their seats. Die Glocke, Peenemunde, Vril and so-on,  so it fell far short of it's possibilities. Some genuinely believe that at least some UFO's are of Nazi Germany origin and would be be a force attacking the states at some time.
  I think I may also have confused this movie with another one like it I saw previews for with Hitler in it and people laughing at the idea of Nazi's on the moon, neither of which scenes are in this movie.
  That said the technology and computer special effects were very good. top notch.
But the story even lacked in needed details...like what is Hydrogen 3 and what could it be used for. and no build up or historical backdrop. , and the actual fight for freedom or whatever was all too easily won.
  also dissapointing was the Extras which were billed as 75 minutes of how the movie was made. I must be missing something as I only got about 8 minutes of extras!. Mind you the extras were very interesting and have lead me on to look for the free movie Star Wreck 5... which I guess will have to be my consolation prize. Maybe I can find the movie I'm thinking of now that I know this isn't it.
People reading the script thought the movie was very funny so if you're not expecting them to take the concept seriously, you may very well enjoy this, but I was, so was somewhat dissapointed.",1506038400,,2785,4.552

5166427,3,B008I34YYY,"At times this movie was funny and at other times this movie was serious.  The most valuable part of this movie is how it is very honest about human behavior.  As human beings, often greed and power will drive people to do all the wrong things.  Whether it's Hitler or Sara Palin or the President of North Korea or the Janitorial Foreman, they will all do destructive things for what they think is valuable to them.  Nearly every character in this movie was motivated by greed and power that they all ignored what can be good in humans.

It's an interesting though outrageous concept that the Nazis were able to develop the science to reach the moon in 1945 to hide on the dark side of the moon.  They continued to develop their weapon system on the moon for a future war and to teach about the Aryan Nation.  By this new period of 2018, the Earth is governed by the United Nations under the command of a female U.S. president who is running to be Earth's incumbent commander of the U.N.  Her election campaign is such that she sent two U.S. astronaut to the moon in a campaign effort only to ignite the Nazis to return to Earth.  The end of the movie had very moral lesson that these people who are greedy for power are dishonest and will destroy the world.  They all had space technology weapons even though all the nations signed treaties not to develop such weapons, and once they realized that there is a major energy source on the moon, Helium3, they were willing to kill each other to get it even though they were all friendly once as a United Nations.

Another reason for the high marks, it is very uncaring towards the 'triggered'.

I remember truly enjoying the ad campaign for this film and wondering if it was going to be realistic or absolutely corny.

This movie is meant to be a comedy with a fun sci-fi premise, moon Nazis that have been in hiding since WW2 preparing for a new invasion. The science and history aren't meant to be at all convincing or realistic. Modern air and space tracking and defense are represented mainly at the pace of plot. There is no real attempt at a deep immersive alternate reality where everything is thought out and explained in detail.

There are several attempts at humor that seemed to be leveled at a USA audience. Many of them fall flat or are simply lost in cultural translation. Expect sexual innuendo, race jokes, Nazi master race themed jabs, and many other potentially offensive pieces of material.

What doesn't work? A lot sadly. Again, this may just be a lost in translation sort of thing, or bad acting, or bad directing. The pace of the film seems stunted at times. Sometimes the visual gags don't work so well. Also for the easily offended just turn it off.

Would I recommend it to friends? I enjoyed it enough to suggest it to several friends, 8 out of the 10 didn't watch it all and the other two said they didn't like it. It wasn't bad enough to make friends into enemies.

As per usual, racial overtones abound, despite the fact that this is a Finnish production. I only watch about 10 minutes of it. The smell of cheesiness was way too much to tolerate. They have their parody of Sarah Palin as president and get in plenty of conservative-bashing that way.

SPOILER ALERT:  So the Nazis escaped Earth in 1945 and have been mining helium on the dark side of the moon, planning to return and conquer Earth in 2018.

If the Nazi's go to the moon in 1925, before jet engines were invented, and spend 40 years developing a super weapon that puts them at 1965. They power their super weapon with a cell phone which wasn't invented till 1973 so the story line is really ridiculous but its still hilarious!!

Don't even try to get your head around the insufferably insane scientific-fiction or the mind-blowing level of mental retardation that embracing such a premise requires, as you'll never quite square the circle.

What you will get with most of your brain cells on stand-by is a thoroughly enjoyable late night romp that features a surprisingly game group of acting unknowns powering through a decent little script crammed with some better than average irony and satire. Iron Sky's watchability is further enhanced by a portfolio of SFX wizardry that not only doesn't suck but is actually much better than some mainstream theatrical releases that lumber into the local multiplex with ""enlightenment"" to spare dripping into your popcorn.

 If you're after Nazi's in an alternative reality check out the first season of Danger 5 where a group of spies are on mission to kill Hitler in a 1960's version of WW II.

For a movie of this budget, the special effects are amazing. It's movies like this that really make me wonder where all the money goes in Hollywood's 200 million dollar blockbusters. There were many details in the special effects that would have been eliminated in most low budget movies.

This movie is clearly a satire and made me laugh many times. It amazed me at how much the directors targeted Americans (the directors are Finnish) and came up with stuff that only an American would find amusing. They must have had Americans writing part of the script.

The script itself, while deliberately outrageous still was lacking. It's almost as if they spent too much time on the sets and not enough on the plot.

The acting was very weak for a lot of the characters. Clearly, they saved money here.

Overlall, the producers did a great job with this one. I wish there were more pictures like this one made every year.

Strongly recommended for sci-fi fans and 'B' movie lovers.",1457481600,2,1210,4.497716894977169

5166559,5,B008I34YYY,"This is a movie deliberately made tongue in cheek and not trying to be plausible at all. It has deliberately fake and at times toy looking props and sets. If you watch the TV show Danger 5 it is very similar to that, although mostly written from the Nazi characters side of things.  It's 2018 and in a bid to get re-elected the president of the USA sends two good looking models as astronauts to redo the moon landing.  Although it's not stated it's sort of hinting that the original moon landing was done in a studio as when our  two astronauts start exploring the moon it's nothing like we have been told it is, one looks over a cliff and notices an open cut mine with trucks and huge mining trucks and other equipment.  He soon is murdered by Nazi soldiers. Yes Nazi soldiers, the Nazis were stationed there during the World War II and have built a large base Area 51 style, on the dark side you can't see from Earth, where they have further developed their UFO technology over the years since. The other astronaut (played by Christopher Kirby), is captured and when his helmet is removed, the Nazis are shocked that he has dark skin.  They decide to cure him of this ailment and take him back to Earth where he will take them to the president where their plans to invade earth will kick off.

This is a fun film that was made by Germany, Australia and Finland and was released in 2012.  Parts of it are spoken in German with English subtitles, but it's mostly in English.  It makes fun of space treaties and country's (all of them) who think they are exempt from what they signed and that obeying what was agreed to is just for everyone else.  As well as highlighting the stupidity of following propaganda by your own government trying to tell you how to think, the film has moments where it is a parody of Star Wars and other films.  It is set in space and on the moon as well as in New York.  Although the film doesn't really have any big name actors, all in it do a great job.

5166568,5,B008I34YYY,"I have to be honest, this is one of my favorite movies. It is a great parody directed by Timo Vuorensola. There are so many little jokes that they will leave you laughing (like when the main character James Washington pointed at one of the Nazis and said who are you supposed to be, Prince Harry?). The movie was originally made released in Finland, then actually released through Walt Disney in the States (of which I did not know until now).

They did a great job researching Nazi culture, predicting what the future would be like if they went to the moon, and what Earth would be like in the future if they had to face this problem. I did, however, want to learn more about what they ate and such, how they were able to travel to the moon without anyone noticing, but its not relevant to the story as it is a parody.

The plot itself was pretty believable, as the President of the United States has sent people to the moon to help her ratings in the next election and once they are there, they find the Nazi moon camp as they are mining Helium-3. James Washington gets captured and has to take them to the Earth for another phone computer to power their large space ship, that is after they turn him into an Aryan. Meanwhile Renate is an Earth specialist who sneaks aboard to see the Earth she thinks she knows so much about.

On Earth they find that things have changed a lot.

They kidnap the Presidents assistant, Vivian, so that they can talk to her and declare war (or, as Renate thinks, bring peace and kindness as she has been brainwashed on the moon). Vivian takes them to the President, making them appear as campaign troop leaders and use Renates brainwashed message about peace. They use the same ideas for their campaign. Meanwhile the Nazis on the moon are preparing for war.

When they get the computer back to the moon, the Nazis declare attack on the Earth and every country is trying to figure out whose ships they are. They each act like they don't have their own militarized spaceships but actually all space craft revolving the Earth has been militarized. An all-out war breaks out between the Earth and moon.

This movie is very well done and actually is in German when on the moon and English when they are in America (I loved that!). Its refreshing to have a movie that tries to keep the language true to who is talking.

BTW, the fact that they had Vivian reenact the Hitler youtube video parody that has been subtitled so many times was amazing. (If you don't know what Im talking about, go google Hitler finds out Firefly was cancelled)

One of the problems I did have in this movie was that they had sound in space. Pet peeve, really Thats why Firefly was amazing! But other than that, I enjoy this movie very much! 5/5!",1445472000,6,2750,4.431683168316832

It's not high art but, it's also better then most Big Budget Summer  Hollywood films

Iron Sky runs circles around 2012 Battleship
but, that's just my nutty opinion
It's one of those films you kind of have to see for yourself and make up your own judgement on it
You're either enjoy it and love it
or Loath it and hate it

My review is is aiming at the very cool Director's Cut (Steelbook Blu ray)

If you are a Steelbook collector this is somewhat of a must have
That's only if you are a fan of the film
If you are a fan of the film you'll get a shinny new steelbook plus the Director's Cut of the film
which is a cool  extra
The UK Steelbook version of Iron Sky is the theatrical version I'm pretty sure it is
It's a nice looking Steelbook (Not the best in terms of art but, it's also not the worst) That would go to the two Original Tim Burton Batman Steelbooks
you can still get it super cheap $16.00 or less for a BR Steelbook that's a great deal

In 2017, America sends a return mission to the moon, this time with an African-American model/astronaut James Washington [Christopher Kirby] in the crew, to improve the re-election chances of a Palinesque president [Stephanie Paul]. Julia Dietze is the naive Nazi schoolmarm Renate Richter teaching the newest generation English and Earth culture. She is called upon to apply her knowledge [or lack thereof] when Washington is captured. Reacting to him being African-American, her mad scientist father uses an albino-nizer to turn Washington Aryan and uses his cell phone to power the giant space battleship Gotterdamerung. Unfortunately, the cell phone's battery is low, so Renate's party-chosen fiance and fuhrer-in-waiting Klaus Adler [Goetz Otto] must go to Earth to obtain more modern computer phones to ;power an all-out invasion of the Earth. Washington is brought along because he ""knows the President"" and Renate stows aboard to see real Earth culture. Renate and Klaus hook up with the President's campaign manager [Peta Sergeant] after kidnapping her, She succeeds in designing the re-election campaign around their proposed New Order. Renate finally learns what Nazis are ""really"" like when Washington takes her to see the full-length GREAT DICTATOR containing more than just Charlie Chaplin playing with the balloon-globe. The current Fuhrer of the Moon [the iconic Udo Kier] visits Earth and is killed in a coup. New Fuhrer Adler returns to the moon to activate the Gotterdamerung while the Earth is already being attacked by Nazi flying saucers launched from Hindenburg-style carriers towing meteors with which to bombard the Earth. Renate and Washington return to the moon in the saucer that brought them to sabotage Gotterdamerung while weaponized Mars-explorer crafts from many nations [except Finland] defend our planet from the Nazi onslaught. I added Netflix streaming just to watch IRON SKY: THE DIRECTOR'S CUT [with 20 extra minutes].

People either find this hilarious or they don't. I get the joke, and the special effects are a lot of fun.

There's also a Directors' Cut with about 17 to 20 additional minutes of restored footage, including some restored special effects scenes that enhance both the plot and the Meteor Blitz FX. If you're debating between the two, I would definitely spend a couple extra dollars for the extra scenes in the Director's Cut.

While I'm here, I'll put in a free plug for the 1970s SF parody novel 'The Iron Dream' by Norman Spinrad, which is brilliant in itself and without whose success I'm sure there would be no IRON SKY film today. 'The Iron Dream' is a must-have book and I heartily encourage everyone to check it out.

People either love IRON SKY or they don't. They get the joke, or they don't. I think it's fun, camp, and it's often hilarious. A nice cross of SNL and MST3K.

If you haven't found it already, anyone who enjoys IRON SKY should check out SF author Norman Spinrad's 1970s cult classic novel 'The Iron Dream'...which was clearly the main inspiration for IRON SKY. Spinrad is a genius, and again, people either get the parody humor of his novel or they don't.

If you're trying to decide between the two, definitely buy the Director's Cut version, the extra 17 minutes or so are very worthwhile.

I was expecting overly dramatic B-movie Sci-Fi, I saw all the positive reviews, but this is like ""Hogan's Heroes"" being done by juveniles who've been told America is the root of all evil in the world. This was not satire, this was on the level of just blowing raspberries and shouting insulting names. This is not just bad, it's downright harmful. Americans are portrayed worse than the Nazis in this movie and the only ""pure"" country is Finland -where this movie was made. Just for the record, in World War II Finland was part of the Axis and fought alongside the Nazis. Also, any skinheads in New York City would get beaten to a pulp within minutes and the Sarah Palin bashing doesn't work at all. She didn't win, tons of people hate her passionately and no one seems to understand that the real danger is always from those who the masses *like* -not the ones who are held up to ridicule.

5166667,5,B008I34YYY,"I avoided this thinking it was just another Nazi exploitation film. Then I heard the directors cut was out and it's actually a comedy - so I gave it a shot. We all know the best dressed side lost the war, but in this slice of comedy sci-fi the Germans merely retreated to the dark side of the moon and regrouped. Ignore the fact there is no oxygen, water, or ability to grow food and you will soon realise this is all well credible. There they rebuilt the Third Reich and planned to re-invade Earth around 2018.

Enter an inept attempt by a female President of the US to have a stunt to garner votes. She sends a black celebrity to the moon to be the first black man on the rock. Well he uncovers the dastardly, but well dressed and camped up, Germans teaching Aryan purity and a whole manner of other twaddle and unwittingly gets roped in to the whole thing and a bit of a love interest too in his female captor.

Cue the invasion of Earth - and hilarity ensuing etc. This starts out as a bit of fun but then actually works on a few levels. There is a lot going on around satire and even commentary on race and discrimination. It is also perfectly balanced in the acting department with everyone just over acting enough to be ludicrous but believable.

The plot was as corny as, but the acting suited the comedy as it was meant to be. The graphics were amazing and made the whole show. For all the Yanks reading this the Finish production team truly portrayed the American president and attitudes effectively as the rest of the world views them. Sadly they have the biggest guns so we can't laugh too loudly I guess. Laugh? You betchya, therre were some really funny moments.

For me, the meeting of the UN security council was an absolute scream where the other countries called the US liars and the US president replied ""this is what we do!"" Almost as funny as the North Korean ambassador claiming their dear leader designed and built the saucers himself. Equally funny was when the US space battleship flew into battle and the other nations called Madam President a liar because the ship was heavily armed, then, the armed space ships of the other nations raced in to assist and Madam President called them liars. Too much truth I guess. I have to say I loved the Aussie accent from one of the space cruisers as brief as it was.

There sure was a moral in there somewhere when, after the earth fleet defeated the Moon Nazis, they all turned on each other leaving no survivors. Well, there were some survivors, the poor elderly, children and their mothers so ferociously nuked under the US President's orders (wow, she sure looked like that Palin woman).

As I said, a corny plot but the graphics... awesome and would I watch the sequel - you betchya. Sequel? There has to be because there were survivors left on the Moon and they have to be rescued. And, of course, that huge piece of the moon blown-off the moon by the crazed new fuhrer's helium gun has to be rebuilt by the huge construction company who contributed most to Madam President's election fund!",1404604800,,1909,4.608823529411764

5166694,3,B008I34YYY,"You already know what the movie is about and you've already watched clips of it on Youtube or you probably wouldn't be reading this.  That said, I won't bore you with the plot, because you already know it.

I am a WWII history fanatic, I love sci-fi films, I love foreign movies, and I love Brit-coms - so seeing those same clips you've seen, and having read the reviews, I couldn't see how anybody could go wrong with a plot like this and the scenes I was seeing.  Visually, this movie is absolutely stunning - the CG work is just as good as anything you'd see in a huge budget sci-fi epic.  The camera work is fantastic, the uniforms and sets are top-drawer, and who doesn't love making Nazis and Sarah Palin funny?  ""Allo Allo"" proved you could do a series where Nazis were genuinely funny, and SNL (amazingly) did some decent work in years past poking fun at Sarah Palin.  So, I went into this movie with some pretty high expectations - and they were not met.

Having watched it twice now, with my wife to make certain it wasn't just me, I'm afraid I have to say the movie is a great disappointment.  There are some great actors in this film that I've always liked before, but they just didn't have anything to work with here.  As stated, Iron Sky is a serious visual treat - the CG work and the whimsical steampunk Nazi creations are fantastic, but the script is rambling, it's disjointed, and the movie feels laboriously long - you keep waiting for it to get ""funny"" and it just keeps muddling along.  I actually laughed in two places during the film, and interestingly, they were the exact same two places my wife laughed the second time I watched it!  And I really do have a great sense of humor and I appreciate dark comedy - the attempts at being comedic here are just very forced and by the time the punch line arrives, you've anticipated it for so long it isn't funny anymore.  More tragic, the film is a roller coaster going from lighthearted attempts at comedy one minute, then plunging into deathly serious tones the next, and so it goes for almost two hours.

Regarding the ""Director's Cut"" - the movie comes in a very interesting shiny metal tin, which is nice, you get a Blu-Ray disc and a DVD, along with a booklet showing a lot of concept artwork, but the extra 20 minutes of video is probably of very little importance.  One problem that was painfully obvious was they duplicated two alternate versions of the same scene, back-to-back, and plugged both of them into the movie, which accounts for about five minutes of the film and was very strange.  This occurs where ""The President"" (Palin) is at the UN meeting to deal with this space Nazi invasion force, and she goes through a big discussion with them, then unveils the secret weapon, the spaceship ""George W. Bush"" which will beat back the invasion - then, immediately following that scene, she does it all over again in a slightly different fashion!  It's rather like they just plugged in deleted scenes and alternate scenes to stretch the movie out and add 20 minutes of footage.

The potentially best scene in the whole film was one I hadn't seen before, where the President's campaign manager goes berserk and duplicates the well-known Adolf Hitler rant from the movie ""Downfall"" that is parodied all over Youtube.  That would've been a brilliant moment in the movie, but, the writers drop the ball and instead of giving her any decent dialogue to work with, they simply told her to drop a non-stop stream of F-bombs screaming about the same thing over-and-over again - it was a marvelous opportunity to be hysterical that was absolutely wasted.

In the end, the movie is graphically spectacular - that's why I gave it three stars.  As far as the story is concerned, it jumps around all over the place and in the end, you're left sitting there knowing you just watched a foreign film, and perhaps this kind of disjointed stuff is funny in northern Finland, but it's not the stuff that made Father Ted, Fawlty Towers, or Monty Python absolutely great.  Some people obviously like it, and I can understand why - the blonde actress is gorgeous, the graphics are superb, but unfortunately, the laughs are few and far between, and the script is far below average.  As much as I seriously wanted to love this movie, I just couldn't make myself come to grips with it.",1402272000,,4340,4.572903225806452

First off, the movie itself was good to begin with, but the 'Director's Cut' put it way beyond Great.  The added scenes were seamless and did add alot to the enjoyment of the movie.

I highly recommend this title and this release.  The 'Steelbook' is a bit hard to get open, but is still worth having.

It either takes place in WWII ( to which anyone who has stayed awake in history class, knows what happens to the Nazis ), a alternate WWII where the Nazis have better tech, aliens on their side and/or have tapped into the powers of the occult or it's about present day Neo-Nazis ( but those tend to be the boring, ""award winning"" movies ). So far the only movie that I know of to have real Nazis in the present ( or near present ) was ""Nazis at The Center of The Earth"" ( trust me when I say this, don't see that movie! ).

This film is fantastic. It's the kind of very well-done campy fun that has to be seen to be believed.

5166718,4,B008I34YYY,"As a fan i am massively impressed with the directors cut of Iron Sky, it's like a whole new movie. The directors cut features 20 extra minutes of previously deleted scenes some of which alter the style of the original film, and that's not all, they've added a boatload of new visual effects throughout and made the Meteor Blitzkrieg even more awesome than before, they've even replaced some of the musical scores with new ones. What they basically have done is taken a ""crazy B movie"" and turned it into a ""crazy B+ with an extra side of crazy movie"", it's just like the back of the movie case reads: ""It's an all-new take on the film"".
 I must suggest however (and this is just my personal opinion) that this directors cut only be watched by people that have already seen and love the original theatrical cut of the film, why is this? Because, the film really has been considerably changed by the inclusion of these deleted scenes and the new musical scores. Some of the new scenes work great in the film while some others are ether unnecessary or do harm to the flow of the scenes they were fit back into, even though i love this directors cut i have a strong respect to the way the theatrical cut was edited, the flow of the film was so much more balanced. A great example of another film with a theatrical and directors cut with similar levels of changes between the two is ""Donnie Darko"", If you've seen both versions of that movie then you know what i mean. The directors cut of Donnie Darko complements the theatrical cut, it just shouldn't be watched first, same thing goes for Iron Sky.
 So if you're already a fan of Iron Sky then buy the directors cut, however, if you've never seen this movie before then i suggest buying or renting the theatrical cut and see what you think first.

I tried hard to keep a straight face during the movie but they got me going and practically non-stop. One of my favorite spots is when everyone in the UN was trying to find out where the threat was coming from; each country denied it was their people. Then North Korea representative admitted that they are behind it.

The acting was great the dialog pungent. There was a little too much potty mouth but it was not enough to be gratuitous. The CGI was quite adequate. The back ground music was not overwhelming the dialog. They did not try to be too campy. In all it was a well balanced movie with a big budget fee.

It was nice to have the subtitles. However 90 percent of the German used was so fundamental that you could follow quite well at that pace.

5166734,5,B008I34YYY,"This is something funny, action-packed, and original in age where Hollywood spews out regurgitated crap. At first glance, it looks like a B-grade adventure flick. Sarah Palin vs Moon Nazis, right? Well, yeah, it is. That's the marketing, anyway. And in this case, NOT marketing it as just a comedy works, as the movie is all-around fleshed out and leaves you surprised when the jokes are funny, the dialogue is better than most comedies nowadays, and the writing is clever (especially from a Finnish-Australian project set in the US and starring WWII Nazis who live on the moon and Americans.) If you go into this blind, your low expectations are pleasantly pushed to the side by delightful comedy, special effects better than you'd think, and a plot and story that almost (almost) makes you want to give a standing ovation at the closing credits. Even if the premise of Nazis advanced enough to mostly master space travel based on 1940's technology makes little sense.

The movie stars a Black actor/model astronaut, James, who is used as a campaign gimmick to get a Sarah Palin parody US president re-elected. Once on the dark side of the moon, he is met by a Nazi colony, who escaped to the moon in the 40s and have been there for 73 years, plotting their return to conquer the world. Once he meets pure-hearted Nazi schoolteacher Renate, her, her fiance soon-to-be Fuher Adler, and James return to Earth. Adler prepares it for invasion, as Renate learns the benefits of being a successful campaign speech writer in modern day New York. And then there's foul-mouthed, brash, and abrasive Vivian, the anti-villain of the story and campaign manager who just wants to be with Adler, who soon ends up scorning her advances. This all leads to an epic showdown with Adler and the Space Nazis versus President not-Palin and promoted ship commander Vivian as Renate and James try to save their respective worlds from war.

For a somewhat low-budget movie that mocks / mimicks American culture, its actually fairly decent and most pass off as believable Americans and the movie itself looks like a professional big studio comedy. The dialogue was surprisingly sharp and witty and the movie itself is just so absurd, you'd have to be the most pretentious film snob to not appreciate the balsy epicness of Space Nazis.

Bottom line, this is a comedy/sci-fi/adventure flick that's just well written, directed, and acted. You feel like you've sat through awesomeness when its over. (Though the ending is kind of a bummer and a little too serious for the rest of the movie.) ""Iron Sky"" is along the lines of ""Dr. Strangelove"" or ""Mars Attacks."" Some might call it 'campy', but its really just refreshing and entertaining. You'll be surprised in a good way after watching this and maybe even itching for more.

5166741,4,B008I34YYY,"Iron Sky is based on the idea that the Nazi's somehow got to the moon and have been biding their time to start a new attack against the Earth.

It was pretty amazing the way Germany went from riding bicycles into the Rhineland in 1936 to using rockets that could make it into outer space by 1945.
It is only a few more seconds of thrust to make it into orbit and not much more to keep pushing on to the moon. So it is no surprise that there have been so many science fiction books based on the idea that someone, most notably the Nazis, got to the moon first and are now fully regrouped and ready to be a problem.

On the surface, this is a decent and enjoyable movie chock full of camp. That is the level that I watched the movie at and I certainly enjoyed it.

However, you can easily (or not so easily) see the satire and social commentary. From the Sarah Palin look alike as president to the subtle jokes about racism, it is possible to see that the makers of this movie intended a not so kind judgment of modern times even when compared to a regime that can only be described as truly evil.",1387238400,,1095,4.131455399061033

5166744,4,B008I34YYY,"For fans of conspiracy theories, Nazis in Space is starting to look a little dated.  There's always been theories of Nazis comingled with UFOs ever since World War II, combining some of the popular literature at the time with the paranoia that the Nazi threat had never truly been eliminated.  This suspicion would eventually shift to the Russians, but for a certain period of time, Nazis lurked everywhere: They were lurking at the center of the earth, in the far reaches of the Arctic, and yes the dark side of the moon.

""Iron Sky"" is the beneficiary of crowdsourcing, and the film's fundraising success is evident in every inch of special effects in the film - special effects that probably wouldn't normally be warranted with such a silly concept.  It's also a snapshot in time, positing what America would be like if a Sarah Palin analogue was president.

But ""Iron Sky"" is actually satirical science fiction, and in that regard it is a biting critique of American success. When a African-American male model is sent to the moon as part of a publicity stunt to generate goodwill, they stumble upon the Nazi base.  This close encounter results in a startling discovery when the resident mad scientist discovers the processing power of iPhones.  Determined to leverage the tiny devices for their own ends, they send Klaus Adler (Gotz Otto) on a reconnaissance mission.

His bride to be, genetically selected by Nazi scientists, decides to follow him.  The Nazi culture does not survive contact with Americans unaltered: Klaus decides to take over the world through popular culture, and Renate Richter (Julia Dietze) realizes that much of what she knows about Nazi history is an awful lie.  ""Iron Sky"" brilliantly shifts gears to more modern theories of Nazi-influence, implying that American culture has already embraced many tenets that would make Nazi propagandists proud.

When a collection of satellites and space stations go to war against the Nazi space war machine, the gloves are off. No government escapes ""Iron Sky's"" unflinching gaze unscathed, which leads to the only ending that makes sense - a nihilistic commentary on the bloodthirsty nature of the world's leaders.

""Iron Sky"" is a retro sci-fi flick with modern wit that's likely to make those without a sense of humor feel uncomfortable.  Rigid patriots will want to give it a pass.",1386460800,,2354,4.989769820971867

Then sparks fly & we realize that a Third Reich version 2.0 is well underway and coming to our world soon! This movie plays both funny and serious often intentionally and sometimes I think not. It's a risky venture when you play one off against the other but they did it and it worked well. The three women stars of this movie are really the stars. Julia Dietze is the educator of a future generation of Nazis youth but also the voice of reason as well as that hot babe that Gotz Otto & Christopher Kirby have their eyes on. Stephanie Paul is the Sarah Palin knock-off who in this world is already the president and her character brings some well needed laughs to the story. Peta Sergeant plays the campaign advisor to the prez but quickly climbs the ladder to commander of essentially everything that can be launched at the invading outer space army. There is a lot of character development wiggle room that goes on with these 3 strong women & it makes the movie and it's important the director Timo Vuorensola got that. Rounding out the main cast is Udo Keir who is the aging Fuhrer and leader of the invasion force. This movie really cuts across the grain. By that I mean the uniform worn doesn't tell you the good guys from the baddies here, you will have to do a little homework. Other observations, it's hard to understand why this got an ""R"" rating by the MPAA. You take out one or 2 scenes and this could easily pass as a PG movie. It's surprising Peta Sergeant ( especially) or the other ladies didn't ramp up or were scripted more adult scenes & I even wonder if it crossed the Producer or Director's mind to incorporate a sexy option as it would have fit the script well and they already had the ""R"" rating. There was a lot a juggling evident as all involved made this project work. From Making Frankfurt look like New York to facing 2 metres of flood water in their base camp in Australia to filming against green walls and hoping CGI add ons would make this vision come to life. It all worked out in the end even raising funds every which way. If you like Science fiction you have to admire what was accomplished here. I think just the unlikely way this movie was put together the big budget look though this wasn't the case and the constant damage control makes this a Cult Movie. The odds were against this film ever being made and especially being this marketable. 4 stars for me as the ending ( while possibly leading to future spin-offs)was a little weak and as previously stated it should have veered in a more adult direction. The DVD special features are top notch, trailers, behind the scenes stuff ( lots) & the director/producer audio commentary option is superb, you get the whole story there & it is really interesting.

I thought the script moved along briskly, funny in a Dr. Strangelove kind of way but not at that level of masterpiece.  A good B movie.  Be sure to look for the nuclear war taking place in the background of the end credits.  If you liked the movie Independence Day, then I do not think you will like this.

5166778,4,B008I34YYY,"Let's not get this wrong: the Nazi movement and the Second World War were terrible events that resulted in the tragic death of millions of people. What gets forgotten here though is that this should not be a taboo subject, this is something we must not forget and despite being a slapstick approach the movie raises some real concerns and sends a harrowing message about our current time (or rather the projected near future).

The film begins with the USA sending a team to the moon as a publicity stunt to boost the President's public image. The president is a caricature of Sarah Palin, the team sent includes an African American model to show that the racial divide is gone (and one might argue there are a number of points here, such as IF we are pointing out something is gone, then it probably is not). Either way, they land on the moon and the model gets captured, while the other astronaut is killed. Oh yeah, captured by Nazis who have been hiding on the dark side of the moon, and been preparing for war.

The secret reason why they went to the moon, which the President wasn't even aware of is that America wants to harness Helium 3 which is available in abundance on the moon and will solve their energy problems for a millennium.

Meanwhile the Nazis on the moon are divided, on the one hand there is a massive military complex, but the children are taught that nazi-ism is a movement of peace. One thing leads to another and a team goes back to earth to get mobile phones (just watch the film) and to meet the president. They are mistaken as actors (that part doesn't fully make sense) but the publicist takes their message of peace to bolster the President's message, which is suddenly very strong in Nazi iconography and no one notices (think about it). One thing leads to another and the invasion of earth begins, which is also approximately where a lot of the footage from the trailer comes in.

The worst part for me in the film was pacing. It was too slow in some parts and on re-watching it I can't help but feel the director was maybe padding or trying to build dramatic tension. Second time round though, the pacing didn't bother me, but be warned some scenes seem to linger.

The other issue (not bad cause I'm a cinephile) is that there is a lot of references to other movies, where scene setups are appropriated. The most iconic one being from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Downfall/dp/B0009RCPUC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Downfall</a>, that scene that was really popular on youtube for a while. Some of the people I was watching the film with did not recognize the references, and although they still loved the film, that import of the themes from the other movies won't give you pause to think, thus loosing some impact.

But what is good? Well firstly, this is a B grade, Nazis from Space, pulp sci-fi film. And granted this is not something some people will be able to appreciate, but at the same time it is drawing parallels between then and now and it isn't just done for the Hogan's Heroes play of making the Germans look stupid and incompetent, but you may need to dwell on that for a little while.

Secondly, although the concept isn't new, it is very current because it reflects on our current political climate, both form an America Centric perspective, but also with the wider impact on the world community (though in fairness this is relatively minor and the importance doesn't become apparent until the very end). In that vein it also deals with a great number of current issues centered around the intrigue of international politics. True it is always done slapstick, but basically it's the opposite of tongue in cheek, it's a joke, but with serious undercurrents.

Third, for a relatively small budget (7.5 million) it does an incredible job with decent computer effects (the initial moon scenes are a bit poor, but they get better), great acting (for a B movie) with Julia Dietze being a standout and smart script. Keep in mind this isn't a mega studio production, but for what it is, its amazing.

As I said, this is a B grade movie, but this is the good kind. It's not in the category of ""so bad it's good"" rather it is just that: good. For me the concept and visualisation are especially great, but that it is making a message under all the slapstick is a big factor of why I think so highly off it.",1374278400,4,4392,4.6567741935483875

5166783,2,B008I34YYY,"The point of this movie is not the moon Nazis or what they represent. In fact, the moon Nazi's pose no real threat to the world that has moved beyond them technologically so far that a cell phone seems like magic to them. They come in giant blimp shaped spaceships that are the carriers for disc shaped vessels that look like typical UFO's, but shoot out bullets like WWI fighter planes. Meanwhile, the other countries of the world have been building up for a star wars type action for years, and have constructed space going vessels armed with nuclear devices that easily destroy all the Nazi ships and their moon base in one action.

Instead, this movie seems to be a spoof of the American political system. The President in the movie is a Sarah Palin type character who cares more for reelection than anything else. She uses Nazi type propaganda speeches to help win support. She has a shady campaign manager who is a master at manipulation. She toys with the fact of starting a war to strengthen her chances for a second term. She says things like, ""You all broke you words; it's okay for us to do it because that's what we do"", and later, she and her secretary of defense start a fist fight in the United Nations over their claim of the moon.

Also, James Washington's character only serves to reinforce negative racial stereotypes. Although he is an astronaut, he still uses urban dialect. When he makes his escape early on in the movie, he adds a ""you'll be sorry you did that, white boy."" Later, when he gets his color restored, he comes onto the scene looking like Eddie Murphy playing Buckwheat.

I will not attempt to address the scientific inaccuracies, because I don't think that was the point of the movie, nor is it my field of expertise, but other slight gaps I will mention. For example, when Adler, Renata, and James come to Earth for the first time, they land on a farm in upstate New York, where a lady with a shot gun sees them come out of their spaceship and chases them off her property with a shot gun. In a later scene, that supposedly takes place a few months after that, Renata and James take that same ship back to the moon. This whole time, the farmer that chased them away did not report that giant space ship sitting on her property? Also, when Renata sees James on the street as a homeless man, he has about 3-4 years of hair growth in what has only been a few months. Finally, when Renata returns to her moon base after it has been mostly destroyed, she walks into her old classroom amid the rubble. Her students are still sitting there in their chairs as if nothing had happened! And then they ask her, ""What was Earth like?""

I was glad to learn that this movie was written and produced by non-Americans, because the stereotypes used in the film are unforgivable.",1373932800,,2798,4.480392156862745
5166784,1,B008I34YYY,"It's not the fact that Iron Sky is a bad movie that upsets me.  It's the fact that it has an idea so ripe for exploitation---space Nazis from the moon---and throws it in the garbage.  Then it drowns it in heavy handed satire, chokes it with execrable dialogue, blinds it with cringeworthy acting, and finally silences it with a potted syfy-brand soundtrack.  It couldn't have been worse if it were produced by a group of emotionless clones who did not have a full understanding of human interaction, much less humor.

I cannot imagine whom the producers thought would think any aspect of this movie was entertaining.  It is my understanding that it was a joint Finnish-German-Australian production, though which members from the production team were responsible for each aspect of production I can only guess.  My hypothesis goes thus: the Germans thought that by producing a satire of Nazism would somehow ease the pain of its memory, and their role in it.  The Australians apparently thought that out-of-date political jokes that appeal to very small population percentages are riotous, and a wise investment choice.  As for the role of the Finns, I can only guess, but I suspect it has something to do with having far too much money, and having a desire to throw it in enormous, expensive special effects blobs until they eliminate every original idea in sight.

The actors can't even deliver their lines without sighing with their eyes.  If I ever meet Udo Kier, I simply want to remind him of the masterpiece he made in Shadow of the Vampire, and then simply walk away while he silently weeps at the direction he has taken his career.

Not that I thought Star Wreck: In the Pirkinning--perhaps Finland's most famous export other than NOKIA--was a bad film or anything, but Iron Sky is better than I expected it would be.

- References to Star Wars, Strangelove, and Der Untergang are well-placed, and I thought I even spotted a few nods to Firefly and Heinlein.  The music even briefly references none other than the Pink Floyd record that you'd probably imagine it *would* reference, in light of the subject matter!

- The special effects are mostly pretty darned good, and avoid such chroma-related issues such as depth-of-field problems better than most green-screen-intensive productions do.  The ""roto"" work *does* seem to mess up a few strands of flowing hair here and there, but this is still a well-made film.  As other reviewers have pointed out, Iron Sky is a farcical tale.  Please don't expect utter realism from the special effects!

- To those who have said that the film is anti-American:  Finns don't hate all Americans, especially not Conan O'Brien, Bjrn Troque, and Beatallica.  I haven't met very many Finns, but they've all been nice to me, the ones that I have met.

- Running out of room, but I guess that I ought to explain the title of my review:  I based it on my ""Buffalaxed"" American mishearing of the frequently-heard but seldom-understood dialogue from the above-mentioned film Der Untergang.",1372550400,3,1415,4.924050632911392

5166793,4,B008I34YYY,"Synopsis:  The year is 2018, and the United States of America has launched a manned mission to the moon in an effort to get the President of the United States (Stephanie Paul) re-elected; during which a black model by the name of James Washington (Christopher Kirby) is used as the front man for the mission under the guise that he's the first African-American person to walk on the moon.  As he and an astronaut arrive, they find that the Nazi's have existed on the dark side of the moon since 1945.  Though the other astronaut is immediately killed, Washington is taken captive by Klaus Adler (Gotz Otto), who is groomed to be the next Fuhrer, and presented to Mondfhrer (Or Moon Leader in English) Wolfgang Kortzfleisch (Udo Kier).  While scientist Doktor Richter (Tilo Prckner) discovers that Washington's mobile phone has the power for them to launch their spaceship, The President of the United States berates her assistant Vivian Wagner (Peta Sergeant) for the ""failure"" of the moon mission; all while Doktor Richter's daughter Renate (Julia Dietze) educates children on the glory of the Third Reich and the beauty that Earth will experience once the Nazi's return.  After flying to Earth to obtain more mobile phones and to meet the President of the United States, a newly-Caucasoid Washington (changed by Dr. Richter's experiments) introduces Adler and Renate to Wagner, who in turn uses Renate's enthusiasm about the Nazi agenda to further the President of the United State's political career.  Will the Americans work with the Moon Nazis on a shared agenda?  Will one of the two attempt to thwart the other?  How will the rest of the world react to the return of the Nazis?  And will Washington get to become himself again?

If you aren't one to pay attention to current events, you're going to see this as a Sci-Fi B-Movie.  If you revel in current events, however, you're probably going to applaud at the way the movie satirizes both American and international political culture.  That in itself made it one of my favorite movies to watch, and the mix of Obama's ""Yes We Can"" message along with Palin's imagery drives home the point there's not a dime's difference between the two major political parties.

I was invited for the sci-fi, but I stayed for the satire.  I recommend this to sci-fi buffs, political cynics, and the Mad Magazine crowd.",1371513600,,2359,4.865

5166795,2,B008I34YYY,"What if the Nazis built a base on the far side of the moon and evacuated some people there just before the end of World War II? And they were finally ready to come back and take over the Earth in 2018? And the first American astronaut captured by them was black? This premise is the sort of crazy comedy that appeals to me. At the end of our LoveFilm free month, I watched this movie on their streaming service.

The movie starts well with many broad comic strokes. Astronauts are sent to the moon by the President of the United States (who looks and talks like Sarah Palin) in a bid to raise her profile and help her re-election. So naturally the black guy is a model, not an actual astronaut. He'll look good in political advertisements. The actual astronaut on the trip scans around for Helium-3, a mythic power source that the American government wants. He is killed almost immediately by the moon Nazis, whose base he has discovered. The Nazis grab the black astronaut (though they can't tell his skin color because of his helmet) and take him back for questioning. The guy who captured him is planning a coup so he can be the new fuehrer on the moon base. This wannabe Adolph also has a schoolteacher girlfriend who becomes involved in the plot. Hijinks ensue.

The comedy works pretty well for the first half, mocking the shallowness of both the Nazis and the American president and even the United Nations. Exploring the moon base with its odd mixture of retro and futuristic technology (they still have gigantic, room sized computers in 2018!) and the silly Nazi culture (they have a ten-minute version of Charlie Chaplin's The Great Dictator which is edited down to make it look like Chaplin admires Hitler). Some of the Nazis eventually sneak to Earth to get more advanced technology (e.g. cell phones) to complete their fleet of flying saucers.

The second half of the film runs out of steam. The Sarah Palin gags just repeat themselves and aren't funny anymore. The launch of the Nazi attack on the earth is pretty cool-looking but it peters out too. The movie becomes formulaic and uninspired, which is a shame since it showed so much promise in the beginning.

If you want, you could watch half the movie. About the time they go see The Great Dictator on earth is when you can switch off. Nothing more to see here!",1370995200,,2329,4.591346153846154

5166798,3,B008I34YYY,"One films burning airships at one's peril.

Iron Sky starts brightly, with well-rendered pastiche of the Space Waltz from 2001: A Space Odyssey, accompanied not by an Austrian Waltz but a Mid-Western Polka of some sort. It's a nice dissonance. The scene is shot, framed and executed well. The effects aren't Weta Digital, but they're not so far off as to warrant complaint. The picture ends with a riff on 2001 too, come to think of it.

American astronauts land on the moon, with no greater purpose than advancing their president's re-election. On their space walk they discover not a monolith but a colony of Moon Nazis, mining Helium 3 (the airship super fuel of the future, apparently). It transpires they have been camped out there since 1945 and they're ready to come back.

Cue pandemonium.

But first, stop and note: to this point, all seems well enough. The election gag was weak, but otherwise the auguries are good. But then the actors open their mouths. Iron Sky never recovers. Its screenplay and script are equally dismal.

Why do film-makers do this?  Vuorensola has done so many things well, but has egregiously overlooked the one thing that doesn't require a multi-million dollar investment, but can single-handedly ruin one: screen writing.

A screenplay that is all over the place is an indulgence allowed in a zany comedy (see Monty Python And The Holy Grail, Airplane!, Top Secret, Team America World Police, Spinal Tap) provided the needle on the gagometer stays in the red zone. But Iron Sky's never gets out of neutral. Frequently, it stalls.

For a film so wittily conceived, put together with such verve, the hackneyed dialogue and lame pay-offs are a tremendous disappointment. ""Obvious and overstated, as usual"", remarks one character of one plot development, without the self-awareness the line demands. Opportunity knocks for a some Sacha-Baron Cohen style outrage. Or even just some cross-dressing slap and tickle. None is forthcoming.

Julia Dietze and Chrstopher Kirby struggle gamely with their material, but there is only so much a talented actor can do. The more limited Peta Sergeant and Stephanie Paul make heavier weather of their roles, but in fairness, have even less to work with than Dietze and Kirby.

There are some in-jokes (at least, I presume that's what caused sections of the audience to erupt for no discernible reason), a couple of film references that fall flat (a corny riff on Hitler's bunker tantrum from Downfall is used to introduce Vivian Wagner (Sergeant), so comes entirely without context) but mostly the wisecracks are humdrum commonplaces.

We have a US president (Paul) who might have made the film, Dr. Strangelove style, if crafted originally and given something clever to say. But being modelled on Sarah Palin, she is a pale rendition of a great idea Tina Fey had five years ago. The comparison is inevitable; Stephanie Paul was bound to come up short, and does, handsomely.

This is a dreadful shame: the idea is great fun and, otherwise, the execution is first rate. The production design and lighting are great (shades of Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow), the special effects impressive, the editing assured and the camera-work excellent. And all crowd-sourced and run on a shoestring. But, because the cheapest thing to fix was overlooked, Iron Sky is likely to go down like a burning space Zeppelin.

Let's take the good, the effects are surprisingly decent, there occasionally funny bits for example when the President uses Nazi propaganda in her re-election campaign or North Korea attempting to take credit for the Nazi invasion.

But a lot of times there are bits that could be funny but never make it.  Take President Palin (who is never actually named).  Other than the inherent humor of the idea the joke never goes anywhere, it just sits there as if President Palin all by herself is funny enough.  One of her schemes is to put an African American astronaut on the moon with the slogan ""Black to the Moon"", later we learn the astronaut is just a male model hired for his looks.  It's a plot that could be cutting or biting but the filmmakers don't really pull it together.

5166819,4,B008I34YYY,"I have been thinking about watching this one for a while now but never got around to it until this morning. I considered it by it's trailer and concept as at best a bit of low-brow entertainment. My father has an odd weakness for cheesy B-Movies and apparently I became afflicted. Not out of any kind of appreciation of them as an art form but just as a light-hearted way to pass the time. That's what I thought this was going to be and for the most part it is. It is definitely a fun movie.

What I wasn't expecting was any kind of depth to the characters. Most were shallow representations of several political figures and ideologies. But the main characters of the film definitely have their own life separate from the camp. The Renate Richter character played by Julia Dietze is obviously the primary character and is well developed (as is Ms. Dietze, good gracious...). Anyway.

Renate's growth in the film is a good example of a common problem with followers of a chosen belief system. They know what it is they are told and are reasonably versed in the information that they are provided (ie. propaganda). However, once exposed to the unfiltered record, in this case the unedited version of a film, some begin to see how childlike their belief in their system is. In fact, Renate's character was itself very childlike in the beginning of the story. As her character's understanding matures so does her personality and it creates a 3 dimensional character. It in fact moves away from a single minded belief system into an experience based ideology that's more personal expression than regurgitation of the opinion of others.

Christopher Kirby's James Washington has his own development. You get the impression that he took himself for granted until it was taken from him. By fighting to get back what he lost he obviously finds his individuality and a deeper appreciation of his own self. What started as an almost stereotypical character (ironically) subtly builds a strong dignity. Nice.

It would be very easy to miss these underlying lessons and simply accept the candy coating that is the movie's surface lampooning.

Give this one a chance. Good character development, excellent special effects, good story delivered at a good pace, and a lot of dark tongue in cheek humor. A well done little film that knows what it is and is better because of it.",1366848000,4,2361,4.776960784313726

5166843,2,B008I34YYY,"Ah yes, Ridley Scott's Prometheus! The people from the internet hated this movie, but I kind of sort of liked it. Whoops! This isn't Prometheus! This is Iron Sky directed by... I dunno, some foreigner I guess. Anyhow, like Prometheus, Iron Sky had an awesome trailer. It had some German rock music. Space Nazis. Hot babes. Foot soldiers. Sarah Palin. In my mind's eye I saw perhaps the best movie ever made. I saw Space Nazi foot soldiers drop in from space and an over the top, ultra cheesy, super violent (Quentin Tarantino style) land and air war would ensue. However, where Prometheus disappointed the internet people, Iron Sky disappointed me. What I got instead of my all out Space Nazi war was cheap shot jokes about America, racial issues, a weak air/space battle, and a predictable change-of-heart ending.

The costumes were great. Renate Richter (played by Julia Dietze) looked fantastic in her Nazi uniforms. Say what you will about the Germans in WWII, but they had damn slick outfits and Renate looks great in them! And her acting is good to boot. The Space Nazi soldier costumes were so rad and this adds to my disappointment. Imagine a movie centered around the Space Nazi invasion of earth with these awesome dudes shooting and blowing stuff up. I'm not saying the movie should have been darker or more serious. No. I was expecting a B movie, just a different type of B movie.

Instead of the moon Nazis the movie spends a lot of its time showing how incompetent and cruel the American government is. I'm American and there are plenty of movies that I love that criticize American culture and American government. Movies like: They Live, Planet of the Apes, and Go Go Super Pink Barbie's Adventure. Criticizing America is not the problem. It is that this movie does it so poorly and spends so much time on it to the point that it becomes overly preachy. They could have made the movie around the invasion and still have gotten in their jokes about America, even better I would argue as it would have opened up more opportunities to show America's fictional blow-every-thing-up attitude.

*SPOILER* The final air/space confrontation was dismal at best. A few Nazi UFOs blow some stuff up, and then the main baddy Klaus Adler (Gotz Otto) awakens the mother ship, which doesn't do much before the space war ships of the various nations of earth take it out. There is no ground battle. There is no cool moon Nazi stuff. Just a big let down of a climax.

In the end Renate sees the wrongness of her Nazi ways and decides to go with James Washington (Christopher Kirby), who is black, bringing to the table all the controversies still surrounding race relations. Uhg it seems like movies are always trying to make me feel some kind of guilt for the white man's racial fears and hatreds. I'm looking at you X-men: First Class. Why did you have to kill off Darwin so fast? Fifteen minutes into the movie and anyone with half a brain can call this ending. It isn't a bad ending really, I just feel like Renate drops her Nazi upbringing too fast. The Nazis are a hateful and despicable group, but it is apart of her identity even if she is a kind and loving person. But atlas it is just a movie and she had to go through some arc, the writers just had her go through the easiest one. This complaint is a bit of a nit-pick.

Iron Sky was my Prometheus. I really see no reason to watch it a second time. The jokes were smirk-funny (a lower form of funny, lower than chuckle-funny) and there was no big ground war. What could have been!! Anyway, GO USA!!! I'm serious. America is awesome.",1362873600,,3591,4.569875776397516

5166848,1,B008I34YYY,"I saw teaser trailers for this movie a while ago and salivated for it's release. Unfortunately, the brilliant teaser trailers are far more entertaining than the movie itself. This is such a GREAT concept that was so HORRIBLY executed. Basic Idea: Nazi's escape Earth in 1945 and make a secret colony on the far side of the moon. There they multiply, become completely militarized, and have built a superweapon they plan to use to conquer the Earth. Seems like a great idea, right? What could go wrong with this plot? Oh, EVERYTHING!

Some call this a comedy. It would be nice if there was something funny in it. There are several attempts, but no actual humor. I'd like to say there is a stand out performance, but the  script is so bad, no one can act their way out of it's incompetence. All are dragged into it's mire. I do think there is some imagery that is cool, but seriously most of the really good stuff is seen in the teaser trailers available on the web. The original Moon Fuhrer looks really good on screen. You really think 'Nazi' when you see him, but it's not worth buying the movie for. Although Julia Dietze makes an adorable little Nazi frau, every action her character takes makes no sense. She was wasted in this movie (even though it appears she cannot act; Is it the script or her?). I could dissect this film and point out bad decision after bad decision that went into it's making, but there is no point. It's just bad.

Extras: You get the teaser trailers plus theatrical trailers and a behind the scenes short. The Blu-Ray doesn't even have a subtitle option, which would have been nice, because a lot of the dialogue is mumbled out and diffused by other scenic noise. There are subtitles when the characters speak German, though some of it flies by pretty quickly.

The Evil Ones have been creating the Fourth Reich from their stronghold on the dark side of the moon, and are about to launch their attack on Earth.

Once you adapt to the transparent silliness of it all (complete with evil scientist), the satire shines through brilliantly. President Palin and her closest advisors quickly see the value of being a war-time president, so welcome the chance of a worthy foe - or a stirring orator, if you can get the Nationalist Socialists on your side, either way works. If you want an outsider's view of American politics, I'm not sure it gets any better.

But, for all its self-conscious cheesiness, production values are surprisingly high. Computer animation of space sequences equals the best around, props and sets approach a comic kind of steampunk in their bold anachronism, and the background music features allusions German opera, national anthems, and probably lots more that I was laughing too hard to pick out.

The story in Iron Sky may be seen as absurd, but it's also original and innovative; at least, I personally haven't seen anything like it at this quality. The entire concept is ridiculous yet interesting, and the execution is great. The film is mostly a mixture of action and comedy. I enjoyed most of the comedy in this film, although it does miss a few times; the film mostly makes fun of U.S. politics, and occasionally others. I particularly enjoyed the hilarious jab at North Korea and the spoof of the iconic Hitler speech in ""Downfall"" (the bunker scene). The special effects were great, a lot better than I expected. The acting was also good for what it was aiming for. Aside from some unfunny jokes, another complaint was the ending; although it was okay, I felt it was a bit inconsistent and didn't really match the vibe of the rest of the film.

Overall, I definitely enjoyed Iron Sky. As of 1/4/13, this film is available on Netflix Streaming, and I recommend a purchase for B-movie fans and a rental otherwise.

The script has a lot of clever little touches (lines from history [e.g. the Germans' 1939 justification for war with Poland], references to films like Downfall and The Great Dictator, snippets from Wagner), and the Nazis' lunar aesthetic is conceived in fine style.

But as the film is made as a light-hearted romp, it needs to establish characters for the audience to identify with - it fails badly here. Taking pot shots at corrupt, media-manipulating, please-everyone policians is fine, but the repulsiveness of their characters drives us into the Nazis' camp, and their leading characters are traitors to their own cause - are we meant to sympathise with the untainted loyal Moon Nazis? We don't get much reason to dislike them, and their singlemindedness, scientific prowess and discipline are, as always, impressive. And, of course, they have the best uniforms.

the plot line is great, Nazis from the moon are trying to take over Earth and for a little while get used for President Sarah Palin's campaign and then there's an epic space battle and more stuff happens and it's all fantastic and fun.

Nevertheless, I couldn't stop the lingering of the following thoughts when I was watching it. First, would the movie become more entertaining and hilarious if they had switched more resources from the building of those spaceship and battle visuals (very good with that budget, IMHO) to the development of funnier scripts? Second, would the boxoffice be higher if they had done marketing and promotion better, at least with a poster that can tell potential audience what the movie is really about? In fact, I saw it in the stand for a long while, and I had absolutely no interest to pick it up before a friend of mine did the recommendation. Third, would a better cast help? I am not complaining against the acting but their looks were not really convincing for their roles.

5166911,3,B008I34YYY,"I had no doubt I was going to get this film after seeing their earlier one that spoofed Trek and Babylon 5. But even though I liked Iron Sky very much I found many things that left me feeling let down by the final product. First off the trailers gave the impression of a much more dramatic story than what one gets. That it was meant to be a comedy if fine, just bill it as a comedy. One should never fib to your audience, especially if they're your standard sci-fi fan that loves to nit pick on the details.

 Some of those nits were the discordance of thinking a very pragmatic and industrious people such as the Nazi were would spend their entire time sealed in a (literal) vacuum while they made their plans to return and conquer. It would seem more realistic that they would have maintained an intelligence link through surviving party members that escaped to neutral countries like Argentina. It would also give them a place to set a base of operations to better support their logistics. Along the same lines one has to ask where the heck did they get the materials to build their base, make their clothing, etc. It sure wouldn't be from moon dust or (very) thin air! But a comedy isn't suppose to delve too deeply normally. However since the movie had a satirical bend to it that DOES require greater depth to pull that off effectively. One scene did work. The one where the German guards were looking and commenting on the Playboy magazine and it's ""hairless"" women. That was pulled off quite well. It might even qualify as the best scene overall.

The CGI again was very well done and again I'm of the opinion that it sets a standard that the larger lazy cookie cutter film makers would do well to pay heed to rather than continue their boring ""Ok we pushed that start button, tweaked the same tiresome graphics and plot progressions we've used a dozen times before so the audience won't be able to tell....the film is done!"" If I had any complaint with things it was there wasn't enough CGI. One of the things I really enjoyed about the prior movie, and what made it stand out, was the amount of realistic CGI employed in the battles. It really got my attention and I was looking forward to the repeat this time. Instead I was left wanting. There just wasn't enough this time to get a full appreciation of the quality and the effort that requires.

You also have to admire the ability to take a German city and turn it into a replica of New York for the city scenes. Far more impressive than NYC itself.

If you want to think I'm being too much a nit picker, I'll agree with you. That's because when I like something I look into the nooks and crannies and see what could have been done to make it better. For what the movie set out to do, an amusing spoof little of the Nazis, Sarah Palin, and the rest of the crass shallow leaders and their lackeys (who should be put before a firing squad rather than on a ballot!), it succeeded. However it did NOT live up to it's potential which could easily have placed it on a legendary status had it been realized. THAT is the part that disappoints the most.

It's worth seeing, just don't get your hopes up too high.",1358035200,2,3167,4.386712095400341
5166912,5,B008I34YYY,"Iron Sky is NOT a Sci-Fi movie by any stretch of the imagination and if you go into this movie thinking you're going to see something awesome in the vein of Sci-Fi brilliance, then wipe this thought from your head and think of this movie as one of those parodies you've seen, trust me, you'll be a lot better off.
I was expecting more when I turned this movie on but when I realized what I got myself into, I was perfectly satisfied with it and found myself laughing at it.
Nazi invasion from the moon after retreating to the dark side and colonizing there for 70 years sounded like a real barn burner of a movie and probably would've been if they took it seriously but that being said, it isn't and they didn't and all things being equal, it is what it is.

  Very well made story and plot, the costumes quite masterful and the most of CGI designed rocketships I think are very convincingly believable because there is a big possibility some of them can actually be built in the future.

The tune from the German patriotic song ""Die Wacht am Rhein"" is provided with new words to fashion the national anthem for the Moon Nazis.

There is the fact that the President sends her campaign manager to command a US space ship to fight the Nazis and the campaign manager looks like a villain from Star Trek.  Or the ever so clever ending that greedy and evil America causes the end of the world through nuclear war.

The movie rolled along in a B movie kind of way until the scene where an African American dude is turned into a white Nazi! I blanched, and kind of got ill (and I have a pretty strong stomach). The movie ended my interest right here. Is it fair for me to make a review without seeing the entire film? Yes, it is unfair. I am saying, however, that once you see something extremely offensive in a film, it kind of kills your interest in continued viewing.

Considering the recent issues Netflix experienced with their streaming service, which is provided by Amazon cloud services, I am concerned Amazon may have more issues managing their cloud.

5166958,3,B008I34YYY,"Good: The first half of the movie, and the visuals. The plot starts out really well, with lots of unique aspects, and stays engaging throughout the first half. If you're anything like me, you will think that the movie just keeps getting better, and better, and better, and better. You will be amazed... until the second half.

Bad: The second half of the movie, which turns the most entertaining sci-fi movie I've seen in years into a thinly veiled, passive-aggressive political attack on the USA. (I live in the USA and I DON'T like my government, so keep that in mind.) They take this highly engaging creation, and then they just have to ooze their irrelevant personal opinions all over it. Imagine that you're watching Alien, and in the middle of fighting with the alien, Ripley takes a break to start lecturing the alien about how much she doesn't like Donald Rumsfeld. You'd probably think that was idiotic. It would fail to do anything to advance the plot or character development, and it would seem contrived and out of place. It would seem like something put there by a person who thinks so much of their opinions that they have to interject them into everything, even if they don't match the context of the discussion.

This movie comes complete with a female US president who is obviously supposed to be Sara Palin. This includes a room in the White House furnished awkwardly with bear skin rugs and moose heads, and a pretentious take on the US national anthem with lyrics about whether the USA is heaven, or (and this is the implied state of affairs) hell. The Palin character even has a Nazi write a speech for her. It has a lot of badly acted, falsely emotional stuff in it. It makes me think the author doesn't have a cogent argument, or does but won't just come out and say it, and has to surreptitiously tug on my heartstrings instead because that's all they know how to do. Finally, the US behaves in a greedy way and the world's response is a slow shot of the US spaceship being torpedoed by the rest of the countries, who then fall on each other.

The overall effect is that I felt mislead and disappointed, like going into a restaurant hungry, but finding that they only sell power tools. I would be fine watching a movie about the tragedies perpetrated by the US government on its own citizens, and the rest of the world, if that's what it was advertised as. In fact, I would probably enjoy that movie. However, luring me in with a fantastic sci-fi plot, and then doing a complete 180 halfway through the movie to snivel and impugn without saying what they were REALLY after, came off as childish. I was surprised to see in the credits that this movie received funding from the EU. Why would they contribute large sums of money to fund a bait-and-switch opinion piece on the US, when their own house is on fire? Don't they need to figure out how to stop Greece from imploding, and taking the rest of the EU with it? And even if they want to be in the movie making business, could they at least choose a plot that doesn't make them look completely sophomoric?

Should you see this movie? Well, maybe. Just consider that the people giving it to you are not intellectually honest with themselves. It DOES have a lot of intriguing plot elements and eye candy, and if you aren't too bothered by the ham-handed political message, you might like it a lot.",1356048000,2,3370,4.537828947368421

I went in expecting a B-Movie experience - but it failed there.  It looks like a B-Movie, but its not enjoyable like one.  Have you ever seen your drunk brother-in-law decide to make a pie?  He takes the same ingredients that Grandma uses to make her pie, but does it the way he thinks it should be done and creates this inedible mess.

That's what this movie is like.

It's not that this movie is bad (it is, but that's not the point), it's not enjoyable.  Many groups would be insulted by this movie, Christians, Republicans, Military, Diplomats.

5167012,5,B008I34YYY,"Many reviewers have referred to this movie as ""camp"" which I think belittles it unnecessarily.  Rocky Horror Picture Show was camp.  This is clever.  Would I recommend it to absolutely everyone without reservation?  No, it depends on your sense of humor.  But these days when all Hollywood spews out are screenplays based on a novel, or a comic book, or a sequel or a reboot or a remake, I found this wonderfully refreshing. (When Fifty Shades of Gray comes out we can look forward to a movie that was based on an atrocious novel that was adapted from a fan fiction that was inspired by the equally atrocious Twilight novels...ugh.)

Keep in mind I only watched this to humor my husband, fully expecting to roll my eyes and scoff the entire time.  Instead I found myself highly entertained for the full 90 minutes.  Personally I enjoyed the special effects, realistic when appropriate and other times quite lyrical.  And the direction overall generated lots of energy.  I thought the acting was truly excellent, everyone sold their roles (with the possible exception of the ""mad scientist"" who did cross over the line to camp.)  Special mention must be given to the actress who played the main character, Renata. From a female perspective I found her to be completely believable and sympathetic as a woman of both intelligence and innocence, indoctrinated to prejudice and yet when confronted by a black man for the first time her reaction is a very human mixture of curiosity and compassion.  A woman bound by duty to a genetically matched mate, yet longing for a spark of romance from the insensitive clod. A gentle schoolteacher, who, it turns out is fully capable of kick-ass moves when the occasion calls for it.

No, this is not Saving Private Ryan.  And should I review that movie I would give it 5 stars for cinematic brilliance, though I didn't enjoy watching it and have no intention of viewing it again.

5167015,4,B008I34YYY,"This is a tough one. I don't know if I've ever seen anyone go to these lengths and spend this much money on a movie with this content.

Here's the scoop. A Sarah Palin (albeit with a Southern accent) type President of the United States is up for reelection. She sends a manned shuttle to the moon which is supposed to be a big p.r. boost being that one of the astronauts is black. When they get to the dark side they find that some WWII Nazis have a secret base and are ready to launch an attack on earth and conquer the entire planet. The black guy is captured, turned into a white guy via an albino drug and sent back with the new Nazi commander to spearhead the assault. Plots and mayhem ensue as the whole thing plays out.

Yes this is a ""B"" movie but it has ""A"" sensibilities in all departments. The film makers didn't cheap out anywhere. The script is way better than it had to be. It sported some nice turns and didn't telegraph where it was going. The production design, costumes, special effects and music were all nearly as good as big studio releases. The acting, though not Academy Award grade, was much better than it would have been had this been made in the 80s. Udo Kier was on hand but I didn't recognize anyone else.

Again I have to wonder why the film makers went to such great lengths to put this together, but my hat's off to them. They did a sweet job and made this the best ""B+"" or ""A-"" movie ever.

5167023,1,B008I34YYY,"After reading the reviews of this film, I thought about giving this one a look. Now I completely regret it. Don't get me wrong- I was not expecting a blockbuster and sometimes I enjoy lowbrow stuff like Howard the Duck that's a little off-beat. I should have just stood by it's premise of Nazis living on the moon deciding to start another war to determine if this was a waste of time or not. From the reviews posted here, I was expecting a halfway funny B-movie with some halfway decent special effects, and maybe some social commentary. None of this is true for this film. This movie is a hodgepodge; from the outset it appears like a straight laced action film with Nazis attacking a pair of astronauts on the moon and then when the producers realized how bad this movie really was they added some segments having a Sarah Palin look alike as the president in a desperate move to save the picture. This movie is far from something made by Mel Brooks or a black comedy from the likes of Monty Python. Don't make the same mistake I made. Ask yourself if a movie about Nazis on the moon looking to start another war can actually be good and then think objectively if it could actually be funny. The answer is simple- it's not. Is it really funny- do you recognize anyone who could actually make this work like Jim Carrey or Jack Black? No,of course it's not.",1353715200,6,1357,4.432

Unless you're speaking of flintlock pistols, a modern pistol with a unitary cartridge/projectile will work perfectly well in a vacuum. The oxidizing agent is within the cartridge.

...And without causing the character who fires one while standing up without support to fall over backwards in the moon's one/sixth gravity...

The kick will be the same whether or not one is in full 1G or 1/6G. Action = reaction, so you still have the acceleration of the projectile leaving the muzzle acting against the inertia (mass) of the Nazi-naut. One might lose one's footing or slip as the pull of gravity will not ""anchor"" the shooter as well to the ""ground"".

Movie I rate as a ""6"" on a scale of ""10"". The action started to lag about 1/3 way through.

Here's the scoop. A Sarah Palin  (albeit with a Southern accent) type President of the United States is up for reelection. She sends a manned shuttle to the moon which is supposed to be a big p.r. boost being that one of the astronauts is black. When they get to the dark side they find that some WWII Nazis have a secret base and are ready to launch an attack on earth and conquer the entire planet. The black guy is captured, turned into a white guy via an albino drug and sent back with the new Nazi commander to spearhead the assault. Plots and mayhem ensue as the whole thing plays out.

Yes this is a ""B"" movie but it has ""A"" sensibilities in all departments. The film makers didn't cheap out anywhere. The script is way better than it had to be. It sported some nice turns and didn't telegraph where it was going. The production design, costumes, special effects and music were all nearly as good as big studio releases. The acting, though not Academy Award grade, was much better than it would have been had this been made in the 80s. Udo Kier was on hand but I didn't recognize anyone else.

This is riotous fun but it plumbs some deeper depths and landed some solid jabs at things that bordered on uncomfortable. There were huge pokes at North Korea, America's relations with the rest of the world, the selling of a President and much more. That one of the assault space ships is named the George W.

5167036,4,B008I34YYY,"Like the title of my review says... what more do you need to know? If that one-line high concept doesn't hook you, this probably isn't the movie for you. If you're still not sure, ask yourself this: Did you enjoy&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mars-Attacks/dp/B001EBV0NU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mars Attacks!</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Starship-Troopers/dp/B000MF4O82/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Starship Troopers</a>? If so, then you will probably enjoy this. Just keep your tongue firmly planted in-cheek. The film pokes fun at Americans in general, Republicans in particular, and Sarah Palin specifically.

Things you need to know going in: This is a ""cult movie"". It is the modern equivalent of the drive-in movies of the 1950s. It is essentially a fan-made film. The makers of this film had previously produced a smaller-scale project called&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Wreck/dp/B002OKK2AW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Wreck</a>. Not a Kickstarter, but essentially produced and financed through an internet co-op initiative. There were tons of people involved in getting this to the finished product (check out those credits, and all those logos that precede the actual film!)

So no, it's not a sci-fi summer blockbuster like you might see in your local cineplex. Made on a relative shoestring budget, but they got every penny's worth on the screen. There are something like 1000 FX shots in the movie. The last half-hour is just a big extended space battle sequence -- extremely impressive when you consider that Hollywood would spend tens of millions of dollars to make the same kind of sequence.",1353110400,,1766,6.447257383966245

The plot is absurd to the nth degree, the acting is a joke (in every possible way) and the mechanics of the whole thing are just out of this world (again in every possible way). The aw,gee,shucks Palinesque President (complete with stuffed polar bears (but no moose!) in the Oval Office) and the ""Yes, she can!"" slogan ("" a war-fighting President in the first term is always re-elected!"") is a wonderful creation. Pure unadulterated nonsense from one end to the other - but very entertaining. So, ignore the mounting impossibilities, which commence in the first few minutes and go steadily upwards from there (the whole thing is one ginormous impossibility), relax and enjoy. If, however, you're a serious devotee of film as an art form, you should avoid like the plague, unless you have a medical team with defibrillator on standby.",1352937600,,1038,4.804469273743017

Their plans for conquering the earth solidify when a stray American moon landing puts them in possession of a cell phone ""computer"" capable of controlling their super weapon. ""There's an app for that Mein Herr"" The fun starts when they turn the surviving Afro-American astronaut into a prototypical albino-aryan (albeit thick lips and all) then send him with a scout team to the earth to get more cell phones. Meanwhile the president, a surprisingly dead on Sarah Palin knockoff see's the invading Nazis as saviors of her reelection. ""Moon Nazis? They're real Nazi's?? Ohhh, my reelection's saved!!"" Yes, it gets out of hand.

The UN Security Council scenes are priceless. Watch how the North Koreans try to take credit for the mysterious Moon Nazi incursions.

Except for the special effects (as good as any sci-fi flick) calling this a B flick would be a blatant compliment. The acting is porn grade, like they corralled a bunch of porn actors on the cheap during their lunch break to make this film. Its simple, film the Iron Sky footage in the Nazi costumes, cut the scene, leave the cameras rolling for porn footage as they change costumes for the next Iron Sky scene.

""Iron Sky"" is a unique work both in science fiction and social commentary. There are also subtle gags, such as a hilarious parody of the Hitler internet meme.

The movie is populated with loveable Nazis, deceitful politicians, deadly lies, sexy marketers, and a secretary of state in leather.

Another low point was when the jilted PR rep, now appointed commander of the US space ship 'George W Bush', arrived on the ships bridge in...what were they, feathers? It was pathetic. The premise had a lot of promise (sorry), and even with some minor tweaks this could have been a decent movie.

Starting from the assumption that you already know this is a movie featuring Nazis invading the Earth from the Moon in flying saucers, assuming that you've committed to this concept... I don't see how you could dislike or regret seeing this B movie.  I really cannot even imagine it any more than I can imagine someone liking the general idea and tropes of Army of Darkness and then disliking it after seeing it.  If you're not sure about movies about Nazis in flying saucers on the Moon or if sardonic humor confuses or bothers you... then of course, approach with caution.

The movie even has a pretty well done feel and style to it - the Nazis have a steampunk/fallout sensibility to them for instance.  The acting was totally appropriate to what it was.  It didn't feel like there were any sections that dragged or anything... really, for what it is, it is a total success.  Is this my favorite movie because I'm giving it 5 stars?  Nope.  I wouldn't put it up against Citizen Kane or anything, but as Dr Strangelove crossed with only the entertaining parts of Independence Day, it totally entertained me.  It gets 5 stars because I got exactly what I thought/hoped I was purchasing.

This is the sort of film that I wouldn't do the ol aw cmon speech if someone else is reluctant to see it the way I might with other films.  (Admittedly there ARE films like that.  I'd gladly insist a reluctant person watch the Merchant Ivory production of Room With a View for instance... because if they couldn't appreciate it, they'd be totally numb to good cinematography, romance, or humor)  If your prospective co-watcher doesn't chortle at the very concept if not the trailer of Iron Sky, watch it yourself and let it be a guilty pleasure.

What would you have if you had some cool computers and could do CGI in your sleep, but had no story-writing ability at all but still you wanted to make a movie that included all kinds of stuff in it concerning a culture that you obviously knew nothing about and some science fiction that wasn't really ""science"" fiction because you don't really get the science part?  You'd have a chance to make a horrible movie.

I think I made it 20 minutes into the movie before I had to stop.  I'll wait a few weeks to calm down and master my disappointment and then cut the DVD into tiny little pieces so no one else is accidentally injured by this...this...movie.

I realize I'm taking this personally, but I really was hyped up on this one.  Science that isn't science, humor that isn't funny, a black guy with dialogue out of a bad film from the 1960s, language from a high school...I could go on and on, but I don't have any more stuff for this part.

The soundtrack was beautiul. The concept was clever. Sadly, the execution simply left me somewhere between flat and annoyed. It impressed me for about the first ten minutes before disappointment took over. The humour was startlingly childish in many instances and came across as forced and self-conscious in even more.
  Even though I'd been warned by a previous Amazon reviewer that aspects of Iron Sky might prove insulting, I thought it wouldn't be so bad that it would override the humour that political/cultural  satire is SUPPOSED to have. The idea that American conservatives are filling the niche left available by the death of the Third Reich is as insulting as it is tiresome and, well, simply not funny.

What kind of heroics will it take for us to defeat evil?  Sure, it would be an action-adventure movie like so many, but at least with new villains.

What I got was a relatively flat attempt at uber-campiness.  Add in an over the top dose of ""Gee, but aren't those Americans a bunch of reckless cowboys!"" and it just gets old fast.  The dialog and most of the acting are nothing special.  The Nazis are cardboard cut-out Nazis.  Everyone on Earth is an idiot.

There is one semi-bright spot, and that the unexpected homage to the ""Hitler learns about"" Internet meme.  That cracked me up for the first 15 seconds, then it deteriorated into ""effing this and effing that"".  Really?  Is that the best you could come up with?

But to hell with all that.  We're dealing with Nazis on the moon, for God's sake.  Here's the deal: in 1945, the Nazis set up a base camp on the dark side of the moon.  Now, in the year 2018, an American astronaut/model (Christopher Kirby) stumbles upon their superstructure.  A rising star in the Nazi party (Gotz Otto) plans to use the American in his scheme to unseat the current Fuhrer (Udo Kier) and overtake planet Earth; only thing is, his cutie Earthologist girlfriend (Julia Dietze) has taken a shine to the newcomer.  Shall the Nazis prevail in their campaign against a war-hungry American government (run by a Palin stand-in)?  Or shall the world pull itself together and kick some moon Nazi butt?

 Now then, the movie was awsome great sory line (For B Movie) and special effect were good, Acting was suprisingly well. I could not tell they were trying to act like most b movies which means they hired actual actors. Some were main stream actors who you will recognize right away. The weakest link in the whole move was the black guy, sorry don't know his name or anyone elses for that matter. He was the only one who remided you this was B movie acting. Other wise the plot and syle of the movie would be the only thing letting you know it was a B movie.

 It had the fell of Attack of Mars, very entertaining. My main thought when watching this was why did it not have its do in theaters.

5167114,5,B008I34YYY,"""Iron Sky"" was a partially crowd-sourced independent movie.  Pretty much a B movie by definition.  But it was better than movies with far bigger budgets.

In 2018, a folksy, female President of the United States is planning her re-election campaign.  She's got that ""hot librarian"" thing going on, but she's not a reflection of any real politician, especially not one from Alaska.  As part of her campaign, she pushes to put an American back on the Moon.  And her astronauts stumble across an eighty year old secret; Nazis have been living on the dark side of the moon since the end of WWII.  The Nazis think that the astronauts are scouts for an invasion of the Moon, and prepare their counter-attack (spoiling attack, actually, but counter-attack is close enough).

And the results are darkly hilarious.  The UN, the space race, the arms race, gender and race issues, propaganda, marketing, and conspiracy theories are all lampooned in this brilliant sci-fi comedy.  I particularly enjoy the part where the advertising executive acts out the famous scene from ""Downfall"" with her staff.  The American President, who in no way was a representation of a former mayor of Wasila, AK, was brilliant, delivering subtle and sublime barbs to the foibles of the American political system.  And the Moon Nazis themselves were brilliantly played stereotypes from WWII films from yesteryear.  The mad scientist (well, mad engineer) and his daughter pushed the humor right over the top.

Amazing film and big fun!

Nazis from the moon, dirigibles, guns, explosions, satire, Sarah Palin--ripe with comedic potential! Unfortunately Iron Sky didn't deliver on anything that, well, on anything at all really. We have a very sinusoidal and ultimately anti-climactic storyline, boring characters, unfunny jokes, and a lame space battle at the end that you could've just fast-forwarded to and not missed a single thing. This movie had so much potential, but it fails to deliver on any one item. I'm often left wondering what I'm supposed to be watching. Is it a serious space opera? No wait, it's a satire.

5167125,4,B008I34YYY,"The Nazis have been hiding on the dark side of the moon for more than seventy years, waiting for the chance to strike back. Because of this outlandish premise, ""Iron Sky"" may look to some like over-the-top, campy fun, something like ""Mars Attacks!"" For better or worse, the Finnish-German-Australian film is actually more than just a wacky one-joke comedy, taking itself pretty seriously, with the action-filled climax and blatant political commentary - perhaps too seriously.

The story is almost non-existent. In the year 2018, an American astronaut James Washington (Christopher Kirby) is attacked by Nazi soldiers on the moon, and is held captive in the swastika-shaped Nazi basee, where the ""F&uuml;hrer"" Wolfgang Kortzfleisch (Udo Kier) rules. In his attempt to escape, Washington meets a schoolteacher and researcher Renate Richter (Julia Dietze), who is also fianc&eacute;e to ambitious military officer Klaus Adler (G&ouml;tz Otto).

Like many low-budget B sci-fi movies, the story is a concoction of various ideas - slapstick, a love romance, an eccentric scienist, attack of space zeppelins and United States presidential election. Part sci-fi action and part political and social satire, the film has many parodies and references to other better-known films and pop culture, including an angry, ranting Hitler of ""Downfall"" and one Charles Chaplin classic (edited down for the kids). While some of them are clever and funny, some look dated, even at the time of the film's initial release, like Sarah Palin-like US President played by Stephanie Paul.

Perhaps ""Iron Sky"" is too ambitious, trying to achieve something deep like a social drama, while entertaining us with spoof and action. The film may not be totally successful at that, but director Timo Vuorensola keeps the ball rolling, with effective acting from the cast and special effects that are surprisingly good.",1348790400,2,1884,5.379661016949153

As a political and social satire, it's hilarious. The Sarah Palin character as U.S. president is a hoot because it's so close to reality. As a rumination on the stupidity and mindless destructiveness of the human race, it's pessimistic and serious. Those parts of the movie are accompanied, appropriately enough, by themes from Wagner's ""Gotterdamerung."" Each part works in isolation, but they don't work well together.

I give the movie one star just because the CGI effects were not a total disaster but it's all downhill from there. I know it's meant as a parody of sorts but even as that, it fails. The film is utterly unfunny and un-American. I can't decide what I disliked most: the bastardized version of the ""Star Spangled Banner"" they played during a scene showing President Sarah Palin (that's not a typo) beating U.N. delegates with her red shoe, the African-American actor that played a white man during the majority of the movie or the fact that, in the end, they try to portray, as sympathetic figures, not the Americans, but the Nazis.

After watching a string of wonderful foreign films, and being enticed by some awesome trailers for Iron Sky, I decided to pull the trigger and buy tickets for a local limited release.  If I could do it over, I sure wish I had that money back!  The disappointment surpassed Blair Witch. Hell, it made Snow Dogs look Oscar worthy. After I plugged this film to my wife, and she usually trusts my judgement, I convinced her to join me. For the duration of the film all I could see was her look that said, pretty much, WTF?! Low expectations never again can be low enough.

I've watched some turds in my life, but somehow this set the bar for crap even lower.  The script is amateurish and forced.  The sub-plots (I don't know what else to call them) were lame.  I even found myself rooting for the Nazis because I hated Astronaut Washington at a Jar-Jar Binks level.  Iron Sky is like what a good idea could be if script and production was handed over to 10 yr olds.  It's predictable.  The irony is ironic only to dim-wits.  The character development purely stereotypical.  This movie is BAD.  Really BAD!  BAD, BAD, BAD!!!  Watch Trollhunter.  Watch Phase 7.  Watch The Hunter.  Watch anything but Iron Sky.  If you can't avoid the curiosity of Moon Nazis, watch the trailers over and over.  I wish I did.  Should you decide to view this turd, you've been warned!

But this post is dedicated to the one getting the least amount of attention. Iron Sky is BRILLIANT! Imagine if Joe Dante (Gremlins) made a movie about Space Nazi's(!), written by Paul Bartel (Death Race 2000, Eating Raoul), Produced by Roger Corman and utilizing all the advantages of CGI on a low budget and you get an idea of how awesome this movie is.

 Not only is Iron Sky a great comedy but it's also a fantastic satire. Even more amazing is that they managed to make this for about 10 million which puts every bloated blockbuster out this summer to shame. I really can't stress how good this movie is. Sure, you look at the trailers and think ""heh, one note joke!"" but it's soo much more than that. I was worried that the bulk of the movie was going to be ""cultural misunderstanding"" comedy and although there's a little bit of that, it's not overdone.

 At about 90 minutes long it's perfectly paced and while you're average Corman cheapie was never really able to deliver a big payoff, Iron Sky delivers a climax on par with the likes of Starship Troopers' Klendathu Drop crossed with the alien invasion of Independence Day.

So a single ship is sent down to try gain more of these ""super computers"" and learn of what Earth is like now before the main fleet is sent - some believing in a peaceful reunion, but the military heads wanting conquest and revenge.

It helps me to enjoy this movie more, if I just think of it as a silly little story that could have been told in about 25 minutes, but they stretched it out longer than it had to be to be able to call it a movie at all.

You can definitely see that it was put together with a very limited budget.  Maybe it is counting on it's ""limited theatrical release availability"" to sell it as a cult film on Blu-ray or DVD.  I paid far more than what this movie is worth, but I can see already that some people are asking about it, probably because their film trailer has gotten some tangible play on YouTube.  I mean, that was where it whet some of my interest.

Maybe the limitation of the availability of this film to a larger American audience is because it seems to be another jab at enhancing the ridicule of the possibility that Sarah Palin could actually be elected as our President.  Which, I have no doubt, could be possible by the cruel fate of selective default. If all we continue to choose from for the upcoming election, is all those greedy, self-serving, morally decadent, slimeballs running for office, we'd eventually end up voting in the lesser of all the evils or idiots on the ballot. So, we never win. Nothing ever changes for the better. Again, I think I'd rather see Sarah Palin in Penthouse, not the White House! America continues its downward spiral.

5167148,4,B008I34YYY,"Wow this is a ridiculous movie. Nazis who fled to the moon at the end of WW2 come back to conquer the earth. If you like the sound of that then this is the film for you.

Good things:
Completely ridiculous and over-the-top concept. The actors never wink at the camera and say it's all a joke. It's played completely straight (except for Palin and her aide) and derives its humour from the absurdity of it all.
Nazis are so dumb its funny. When they capture a black guy their first thought is to turn him white so that he'll be on their side. And their compulsion to salute at the worst possible times is wunderbar.
The graphics. There are some truly awesome space battles here with Nazi zeppelins, giant spaceships, and even the Mir Space Station involved. The design of these vehicles is amazing.

Bad things:
The script. It just seems to be all over the place. And the opening half hour just isn't funny, at least not once the two Nazis are on earth. The whole subplot with Palin's aide made no sense. What did she think they were that she was giving them help like that? This isn't funny, it's just vague and confusing. It gets better once the Nazis attack but there are still a string of odd moments that just suck.
The acting. I know they were on a budget and all so I won't go too hard on them for this, but there was a lot of bad acting in this film. Even some of the leads were just not right. Standouts in this respect are Pres. Palin and her aide. Palin could be fun at times but the actress seems afraid to go all out crazy. Her aide is worse since she's trying to act tough by yelling and it just doesn't work. A lot of this is bad writing but the performance really ruined it. I couldn't stand it when she was on screen. The lead guy is entertaining enough as are the bad guys and a lot of the cheesy acting works. But those two especially just don't.
The editing. This really should have been a fast-paced movie. With a concept like this there's no point with a lot of slow dialogue scenes. Which is why those really stand out, especially near the beginning.
The graphics. Again, low budget so I understand but some of these shots could have used more work. The cg background shots especially tended to be bad.

In conclusion, I think that it is fair to say without any possibility of contradiction that this is the best movie about Space Nazis trying to destroy the earth. Certainly in the top ten. I do think giving it a four is a bit generous though. It deserves something more like a three and a half. The painful Nazis on earth scenes that added nothing to the plot and the inconsistent pacing make this a lot less enjoyable than it should be. Still, it's better than a three so I'll err on the positive side. Entertaining film, go see it.",1342915200,2,2758,4.3
