8150652,5,B000JJ4WDI,"Basilisk takes place in 1614 during the Tokugawa Shogunate era. Two ninja clans are at war with each other competing to win the favor of the regime for the next 1000 years. Each clan has to choose 10 members. Whichever clan kills the 10 members of their rival wins.

There are a lot of awesome things to say about this anime. The animation, the music, and the story line are all great. Almost all , of the characters are too. There are a few ninjas I didn't like though. One guy kills you with his hair, one guy is a quadriplegic that kills you with a knife that he holds with his tongue, and one dude turns into goo when he touches salt. Most of the other ninjas are awesome though. The bad guy is really a heartless bastard. It makes it very interesting when you have a bad guy that is way evil. The characters really keep you interested and the carnage never lets up.

I really think anyone that likes anime would get a kick outta this one. If you like it there's a live action movie called Shinobi. It's the same story line with a few less characters. It's incredible as well.

Definitely give Basilisk a look see.",1354060800,,1118,4.289099526066351
8150653,5,B000JJ4WDI,"I not only enjoyed the story-telling and animation, but also the soundtrack, so I bought the entire series. I will use some of the series, editing out the rough sex, to augment my Ninja camp this summer for 5th through 9th graders.",1352160000,,231,4.523809523809524
8150654,4,B000JJ4WDI,"If your looking for another ""Ninja"" anime to watch like Ninja Scroll(Amazing!) then this would be another good one.  If you want lots of action with great fight scenes and a love story than this is it.  The ending is meh, but not horrible.  If you like Ninja Scroll or Samurai Seven than you should pick this one up.",1286064000,,316,4.322033898305085
8150655,4,B000JJ4WDI,"It is pretty good, sorry I really do not review things that much, unlees I do not like it.",1173657600,,90,3.789473684210526
