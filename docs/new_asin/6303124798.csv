568702,5,6303124798,"WHATS EATING GILBERT GRAPE is one of those fancy films that comes out of nowhere, smacks you in the face with its realism, and then kisses it with its milieu of deep ideas!

At first glance I thought the story was very plain-jane, Gilberts depressed languor is due to his flaccid nature stuck in a small town with his necessitous family.  Boy oh boy was I wrong!  When talking with my neighbor on the subject of this recently watched movie, he gave me the real low-down on what it was all about.

Did you notice their hair? he asked me emphatically.

I was shocked that I had not, so we then rewatched the movie together with this fresh new perspective in mind.  Soon as the movie ended, I whooped my knee for not seeing the films hidden meaning.

The top-level story is actually salad dressing for a deeper message on what defines a persons gender, insightful character study focusing on the correlations between Dip's family crisis and that of the crises of the modern family held hostage in the supposide nuclear household demograph.  All of this is wonderfully presented using Gilberts long, lustrous, woman-like hair as a running allegory.  To counteract this vibrant abstract view, Juliette Louis-Dreyfuss titular character plays the opposite with her very short, prickly, masculine hairstyle.  Her character is the classic male caricature with her gruff and tumble hair-du-style.  The hairs so wonderfully showcase this subtext without it ever covering over your face with its obliqueness.  Even though her hair has some great scenes, the hair that really highlight this deep movie message is the Dippsters.  Continuing my brief Johnny Dipp stint, the guy normally doesnt captivate me in most of his gruffer, shorter hair roles.  Here hes an everyman and comes off much softer, silkier, and prettier looking with his sleek feminine features paired with that long, smooth, and luscious hair.

Adding to the pot are many hairless storylines like being a store clerk and a whole lot more. In short, this is one of those great hair dramas that shouldnt be missed. It will keep you entertained for days on end (if you watch it repeatedly like I did)  and you might even learn something about your own hairs from it!  If anything, see it for the Dippsters hair-doo!",1518480000,,2266,4.859375

568776,5,6303124798,"WHAT'S EATING GILBERT GRAPE features an ensemble cast featuring two Grape brothers, played by Johnny Depp (older) and Leonard deCaprio (younger), their morbidly obese mother (played by real-life morbidly obese 550 pound Darlene Cates), along with several recurring characters.  These other characters include Mary Steenburgen who plays Johnny Depp's a lust-interest, Juliette Lewis who plays Johnny Depp's love-interest, Crispin Glover who plays a minor character as an undertaker, and Joe Stevens.  John C. Riley plays a house repairman who is sometimes seen repairing the house where the Grape Family lives and who eventually finds a job at Burger Barn.

The film includes the following concurrent themes.  I am not sure if any one of these themes is more prevalent than the other, but at any rate, all of these themes are present:

(1) Johnny Depp's character remains serious and low key throughout the movie.  Gilbert Grape never acts up and is never a drama queen.
(2) Leonardo DiCaprio.  His character is mentally retarded.  He finds joy in an annual airstream trailer parade that passes over Iowa's rolling hills.  He habitually climbs up a ladder to the top of the town's water tower, causing commotion and distress.  He frequently climbs trees and enjoys staying on one of the broad branches.  In one scene, he inserts an insect into the latch of a mailbox and chops off the insects head with the mailbox door. When the topic of his father's suicide by hanging is brought up, the mentally retarded boy joyfully positions his hands as though he is being hung by a rope.  His character adds tension to the film, because one is never sure when he is going to harm himself.
(3) One occasional theme of this movie is a type of surrealism similar to that found in LA STRADA.  This surrealism is provided, for example, in a scene where there is an out-of-doors funeral for an insurance salesman (played by Ken Carver) and where, during the ceremony, Leonard DiCaprio's character gets excited by a flatbed truck that is bringing a Burger Barn restaurant into town. In other words, what is very weird is the solemnity of the funeral and the concurrent joy of the retarded boy in the Burger Barn being transported. (This surrealistic episode is repeated but in reverse order, during the opening of Burger Barn, where a Burger Barn employee asks the town undertaker to go away from the crowd of townsfolk at the Burger Barn opening, because of the risk that the undertaker's presence would dampen the happiness of the crowd.)  Another bit of surrealism is provided where an insurance salesman (played by Ken Carver) pressures Johnny Depp's character into buying life insurance, and repeatedly instructs Johnny Depp that he should buy life insurance because anybody can die at any time.  (This surrealistic episode is repeated, but in inverse order, because a bit later on in the story, the insurance salesman gets a heart attack and collapses into a children's wading pool and drowns.)  Yet another surrealistic or perhaps cartoon-like feature of this movie, is that whenever the undertaker (Crispin Glover) appears, he is dressed in a neat suit and tie (even though he is not on a business call).  The morbidly obese mother can also be characterized as a surrealistic element, because she is as obese as Mr. Creosote (a character in Monty Python's MEANING OF LIFE).
(4) A recurring theme in this film is the tension between the town grocery (Mr. Lamson's grocery) and a huge supermarket several miles away (Food Land).  The tension is that Food Land is drawing customers away from Mr. Lamson's grocery, and there is some doubt if Mr. Lamson's grocery can survive.  On a couple of occasions, the film discloses the very glitzy nature of Food Land by referring to (and then actually showing) the display of live lobsters in this supermarket.
(5) Theme of enduring love.  If I was forced to state that one theme was overriding over the others, it would have to be the enduring love that Johnny Depp's character and the rest of the Grape family have for the retarded boy.  Despite his antics, mess-making, and infantile behavior, the other family members remain doting towards the retarded boy.  The enduring nature of this theme is reinforced by the fact that Johnny Depp's love interest (Juliette Lewis) becomes one of the entourage of care-givers to the retarded boy.
(6) Another source of tension is the fact that head of the Grape family had hung himself in the basement many years before.  In other words, the viewer might wonder  --  as the story progresses --  how this historical fact has influenced the members of the Grape family.  As it turns out, the only dramatic influence is shown in one scene where the retarded boy laughs about and makes self-entertaining remarks about his own father hanging himself.  And yet another source of tension in this movie, is the fact that the townspeople make jokes about the morbidly obese mother.  In one particular scene, the morbidly obese mother leaves her home for the first time in many years, because she needs to pick up her retarded son from the police station (he was captured by the police because of his habit of climbing up the water tower).  When the morbidly obese mother leaves the police station with the retarded boy, a cluster of townsfolk stand in front and gawk at her, and an old man even takes a photo of her.  Also, on a couple of occasions in this movie, small children peek into a window of the Grape family house, because they want to see the morbidly obese mother.

CONCLUSION.  This is a film of several concurrent themes.  The movie consistently holds one's attention.  Despite the various concurrent films, the film always appears to be a cohesive and integrated whole.  The concurrent themes include: (1) Johnny Depp's dilly-dallying with Mary Steenburgen; (2) Tension produced by question of whether Mary Steenburgen's husband (insurance salesman) knows about the dilly-dallying, and the question of why the insurance salesman keeps on asking Johnny Depp to see him in his office (is it because the insurance man wants to confront Johnny Depp about the dilly-dallying?); (3) Theme of developing love interest with Juliette Lewis; (4) Theme of the health problems of the morbidly obese mother, and theme of townsfolk making jokes about her; (5) Theme of Food Land taking business away from Mr. Lamson's grocery; (6) Theme of retarded boy frequently getting into trouble (climbing water tower; ruining his birthday cake; mutilating insects, etc.).  Despite all of these concurrent themes, the end of this movie provides a decisive conclusion that brings an end to some of these themes (don't worry, I do not disclose these endings in this review).",1508803200,,6722,4.9431111111111115

568887,5,6303124798,"Astonishing film. Great performances, especially from a young Leonardo DiCaprio. I actually thought that he was mentally handicapped. He should have won the Academy award and not just the nomination. The film also perfectly captured small town America. I felt sorry for Gilbert throughout the film. He was stuck in a miserable life, working at a small grocery store, having to watch over his dysfunctional family, and also having an affair with an oversexed and older Mary Steenburgen. Then Juliette Lewis entered the picture, I was hoping that he would run off with her, she being his only slice of sanity. I loved watching watching their scenes together. The first time I watched this film, I was turned off by it. Then I gave it a second try and I found myself involved with the characters. I found myself watching the film several more times and realized it was becoming one of my favorite films.",1495929600,,900,4.812903225806451
568888,4,6303124798,A lot of good performances in this one especially Leo held it all together and the time went by quickly. If anyone had to live Gilberts life I suspect running away would be a Prime Directive. A totally dysfunctional family manages to keep it all together and support a child with a major issue. Cant say its my favorite genre but I certainly enjoyed it and it didn't seem like a nearly 2-hour movie. There were some plot flaws like the whole disabled truck that mom repaired but you need something to anchor a few characters so therell be time the interaction between the two.,1495324800,,576,4.495238095238095
568889,3,6303124798,"Sometimes the best performance come in a film that just doesn't deserve them. Everyone knows of Gilbert Grape, but not because it is a classic film that deserves to stand the test of time, rather it is the film that launched two of the biggest careers in Hollywood. Gilbert Grape (Johnny Depp) is barely old enough to drink, yet he is the man of the house, forced to raise his brother and sisters, and care for his obese mother. Gilbert lives in the middle of nowhere, works a terrible job, and his future doesn't look so bright, that is until a girl, traveling cross-country with her grandmother, breaks down in his town. A relationship blossoms and Gilbert finally discovers that life has been passing him by. The story here is simple and at many points extremely slow moving. This film was just meant to be a backwards love story, but has become so much more, because of Depp and Leonardo DiCaprio. The two young stars gave everything they had and more, with so little to work with, that their performances became absolutely legendary. What's Eating Gilbert Grape is not a good film, but you will be hard pressed to find one performance, must less two as good as the ones in this film. The feeling and emotion that come along with their joys and despair is something you just can't teach, either you have it or you don't. Both these actors will make you feel every emotion of their characters and make you take a look inside yourself in a way that few film will ever do. I hated the story, but I recommend this film for nothing else than it's performances. If every performance were as good as these, there wouldn't be a need to rate and review films.",1495238400,,1654,4.516666666666667

The Grapes are a family who deserve to have something good to happen to them but it is slow and stubborn in coming. One of Depp's better, more restrained efforts and a truly remarkable performance by DiCaprio. One can feel how trapped Gilbert is in this small, nowhere town with more family than he can deal with.

Playing Howard Hughes in The Aviator earned Leo his second Oscar nomination, this time for Best Actor, an award he should have also won. And finally after nominations for Best Actor for Blood Diamond and The Wolf of Wall Street, DiCaprio FINALLY won his Oscar for The Revenant. In Gilbert Grape, a then 17 year old DiCaprio BECOMES Arnie Grape. The first time I saw the movie I did not realize that this was an actor, it seems so real. At this time he was defined as the most promising actor of his generation, and he lived up to the hype as most often don't to become the best actor of his generation.

568943,5,6303124798,"Endora  is a town so tiny and remote that it might make a small town seem expansive.  The Grape family lives here and is used to nothing remarkable happening, at least not in a dozen years. Gilbert Grape (Johnny Depp) has his routine down pat. He's the 21-year-old head-of household, since the death of his father. You'll learn the circumstances surrounding that. He cares for his mentally-impaired younger brother Arnie (Leonardo DiCaprio), who's predilection for climbing the water tower requires persistent hypervigilance. He attempts to manage his other siblings; works long hours at a grocery to support the family, and tolerates many demands and scoldings from his dramatically obese mom (Darlene Cates), who occupies the sofa from which she barks orders and receives meals. As the story goes, she has remained mostly immobile since her husband's death, soared in weight, and regressed in behavior. She shows affection only to Arnie, sometimes clutching him to her chest like a doll. Gilbert has one more duty, which may offer some reward--- he delivers groceries to Mrs. Carver ( Mary Steenburgen), as well as services of the carnal kind. Gilbert shows little emotion, except to disparage his mom to others. But that's about to change, with the arrival of that one special Airstream carrying Becky (Juliette Lewis). In spite of its chronicling of everyday life in a small town, this story is immensely rich and full of insight. The sparseness and passivity of the setting create space for a keener focus on the family members and their dynamics.  And none of it is wasted. The depiction of how one internal and one external event can powerfully influence and alter an entire family system, across time, is authentic and successful. The acting and all filmmaking elements are exceptional.  Extraordinarily good!",1489622400,5,1817,5.128378378378378

568945,5,6303124798,"I can't recall a movie that was both so sad and endearing at the same time throughout the entire thing. I know the fame Leonardo DiCaprio achieved after this movie and we used to joke about how many didn't know about this role. If only the girls who go crazy over him saw him in this one. And Johnny, what can one say about the roles he's played? Who can sum it up in words?

I believe this was one of, if not the best and most important, roles they both ever played in their careers.

This was a movie named after the main character and yet, at the same time, is one of those rare glimpses into so many lives besides his. This movie wasn't just about Gilbert. He was so neatly tucked into his world of ""good guy"" and putting himself second to others, that we can't help but experience the world of the other characters in his life. His brother, his mother, both of his sisters, his friends, his love interests, even his boss; they're all touching us on some deeper than normal level here.  This is a movie about life, death and everything in between. It brings just a hint of ""Steel Magnolias"" with it.

It is demonstrated for us clearly in the movie that Gilbert was a poor substitute for his father after his passing, and yet ironically succeeded where his father did not. Though he felt like it at times, Gilbert didn't give up. The biggest tragedy was supposed to be his little brother, or so we are lead to think. But it is really his mother, a brave and strong woman at moments, but not when it came to dealing with the loss of her husband and somehow moving on. Gilbert even developed a pretty neurotic way of dealing with his mother after his father's death, I suspect because he felt a very confusing mixture of anger, shame, empathy, love and admiration.

The floor underneath his mother was supposed to be built just a little stronger than it was, and it was ever just so strong to hold her weight. We learn that it was his late father that had built that house, and he just didn't do as good a job as he thought he was doing.
Gilbert was that floor his father built and left behind.

Many times there were events involving water, not to be overlooking the water tower and rain. There was also a hint about fire (signifying change). I don't think the cigarettes in the movie were meaningless, either.

The jobs and opportunities were typical for a small cow town, though it was growing and going through some change. New business was moving in and was both exciting for some and worrisome for others. This was very on point with the small town experience and many who have grown up and lived life in one can relate. From the outside, a store or small place serving food shouldn't be that big of a deal. But it impacts small town life in a big way. It means things are never going to be the same there ever again.

In some ways I can see why the movie is so underrated, and in others I think the acting, cast and writing are so good it's scary. I don't for one moment think this movie was ever written or made with blockbuster status in mind. No, it's much more meaningful than that.

It is exactly what I suspect it was meant to be. One of those things that you stumble upon in life and don't really know what to do with, so you just experience it for what it has to offer. You then want to share it with a world that may or may not be ready for it, ultimately locking it away in your heart as something to bring you some emotion when alone and thinking stumbles upon it once again.",1489536000,13,3494,4.265861027190332

Showcasing unique and rarely seen actors, What's  Eatong Gilbert Grape will challenge your expectations of motherhood and normalcy. Leonard DiCaprio 's performance is controversial but inspiring and honest. This film takes a look at the hard emotional toll of life in a small town and leaves us with a greater appreciation for its charms with a hunger for the wider world and the dream of youthful freedoms. The film reminds us that family is the most important thing.

His ability to become the character of Arnie Grape, a special needs, developmentally delayed child was thoroughly convincing and absolutely captivating. As for Depp, well it was a refreshing look at his normal side, BEFORE his career string of outrageous mad/crazy schizophrenic characters. Other than the fun fantasy character of Capt. Sparrow, I didn't know if he had ever tried just playing a ""normal"" (albeit tragic) character until I delved deep into his early acting history. There it was. Who knew?

I thought that Gilbert was amazing.
I can't imagine anyone doing better in his situation, especially at the end.
Gilbert gave his whole life to his siblings.

I loved this movie, and I have watched it many times.

This movie goes very deep with a lot of heart.

It was clear that this family loved each other.  Even when they fought, it was clear that they all leaned on each other because their little family was all that they had.

I enjoy seeing Johnny Depp before he was the Mad Hatter,
and I enjoy seeing Leonardo DiCaprio before he died on the Titanic,

569912,5,6303124798,"Johnny Depp is excellent, but a very young Leonardo DiCaprio, is the star!  The depth of his portrayal of a disabled young man is phenomenal!  This is the story of a loving family that struggles with the loss of their father, their mother's inability and unwillingness to go outside of their home, and the dangerous situations their disabled brother manages to create.

This movie is well worth seeing!

The format is a German Import, but the supplier included easy to follow instructions, which enabled me to enjoy the film in English. 8)",1442361600,,539,4.826086956521739

DiCaprio does a highly remarkable job portraying a child with special needs and so does Johnny Deep as his brother; and still not many people know about the existence of this film.

570002,5,6303124798,"This isn't a comedy, it's a very moving and sad story about a young man who is lost - he's poor and in a dead end job, but worse, his family is a complete mess.  The economically stalled town doesn't help.  Everyone seems to be lost.

The equilibrium of the family is beautifully portrayed, as is he environment they live in.  Gilbert takes care of everyone, particularly his autistic brother (in a Oscar-worthy performance by Leonardo de Caprio) leaving no room for himself.  His siblings are similarly stalled, but they are taking care of his mother, who is mired in a depression and, as a consequence, morbidly obese and in many ways, the joke of the town.  His circle of friends and his lover are sympathetic and often funny, but there is another level to them that is extremely sad.  Meanwhile, the town is being hollowed out by a Walmart-like box store on the outskirts; there is no industry, no interesting jobs, just stagnation and mediocrity.

Of course, something happens to upset the equilibrium, the arrival of a girl (Juliet Lewis, who is a radiant youth yet appears plain).  She gets him to question everything in a clear way, rather than the muddled ruminations he indulges in as life passes him by.  The care for his autistic brother seems to open them to each other, which threatens everything that people depend on Gilbert for, his shackles of love and obligation.  His mother begs him not to leave as his father had done.

I will not say what happens, but it is unexpected the way things work out.  This is a subtle drama, often very funny, but realistic and beautiful as well.  It is a great film.",1440720000,,1617,4.608391608391608

The scene is set. A family of four young adults with an obese mom and developmentally slow youngest brother tries desperately to survive against the encroachment of real life. What can Gilbert and his sisters do?

Gilbert (Johnny Depp) and his younger brother Arnie (Leonardo DiCaprio) are the main characters. This is a love story between the two brothers, unevenly matched in intellect, but equals in love.

Everything else in their lives either supports or tears at this relationship and this is the story.

Watch this film. It is extraordinary, acted in an exceptionally sensitive way. Well worth watching.",1423785600,3,835,5.162962962962963

WHATS EATING GILBERT GRAPE: Meet the Grape family! Theres dad, whos dead; Momma (Cates), who weighs 500 pounds and hasn't left the house in seven years; accident-prone daughter Amy; teenage Ellen; and retarded Arnie, a 17-year-old who loves to climb trees (and the town water tower). Holding them all together in some semblance of sanity is 20-ish Gilbert (Depp)and hes overburdened with responsibility.

Good-hearted Gilbert has his hands full, stoically dealing with his megadysfunctional familyhes practically St. Gilbert of Grape. But even a saint can make mistakesand even a saint can snap if pushed past his limit. Gilberts limit arrives in the form of young Becky (Lewis), whos just passing through town. Her understanding and affection are the first things Gilberts ever encountered that he wants purely for himself. But wholl hold the Grape bunch together if he chooses selfish love over his selfless duty to the family?

Discussion: Nothing much ever happens in rural Eudora, Iowa, Gilbert explains, and nothing much ever will. He couldn't be more wrongEudora is overflowing with small-town drama; its just all on a very humble, human scale. The plot is episodic, but its the performances that are centraland uniformly excellent. Depp radiates melancholy, and an innocent and wistful wisdom; Cates (in her film debut) hits just the right tone in a physically and emotionally demanding role; Lewis, as the wise waif, is particularly sweet and understated. Best of all is DiCaprios sympathetic and uncannily accurate portrayal of retarded Arnie. (I worked with retarded kids for a year and can attest that his performance is gesture-perfect.) Add in some stunning photography and compassionate humor, and youve got a movie that will make you laugh out loudand cry out loud.",1423008000,,2036,5.089820359281437

Leonardo did a super job in a role that could have easily gone sour or campy. With a special needs brother myself I could see him in the character and as the older brother I had been through some of Depp's character position.

I loved this movie when it first came out.  It got very little attention and I did not know anyone else who had seen it.  When my daughter became a Di Caprio fan, I purchased the DVD for her.

Johnny Depp was great and Leonardo Dicaprio was OUTSTANDING. I cannot comprehend how there are still so many people who don't think he is talented. If this movie doesn't change your mind, I don't know what will. I have never seen a movie touch on these subjects the way this movie did and I felt that it was very realistic which I appreciate.

It is a gift to be able to play like this.  Depp's ability to experience deep inside emotions also takes your heart.  This is a movie very deep.  Very deep.  I could not leave my chair.  It is a testimony to the human heart.  It is also uplifting and has a good ending which is nice.  I cried in several parts of the movie, not because the movie was sad but because I was so moved by the movie.  I honestly have not seen a movie as good as this one.  It is too bad it is leaving Amazon prime. I will just have to get the DVD.  The movie is almost like a meditation, like a prayer. It takes you the depth of yourself, the very depth of yourself.  I am not much of a movie person but I can see that Johnny Depp really is a four on the enneagram.  Only a four on the enneagram could play such a role with such natural ease.  By the way I also laughed at times, when Arnie made jokes.  His sense of humor was just contagious even when it happened at the most ""socially: unacceptable times.  Honestly, I could go on and on.  This is probably the best movie I saw in my life.",1388361600,,1246,4.070247933884297

It's the first film where I saw the amazingly talented Leo DeCaprio. I had never heard of him.  He clearly steals the show with his character of the mentality  challenged ""Arnie"", ( he should have gotten an Oscar).  All of the cast was excellent.

572042,5,6303124798,"20 years on, this film is s till gripping. It's wonderful to see Johnny Depp and Leonardo DiCaprio in their youths. Leo is great playing Arnie, a retarded teenager with the irritating and dangerous habit of running off to climb the town water tower. Depp is Gilbert, Arnie's big brother and protector, who is stuck in his mid-western town. He lives with a grossly overweight mom, a former local beauty who started overeating when her husband died years before. Gilbert two sisters also share the home which is literally and figuratively weighted down with grief and inertia.

WEGG is a sadly sweet story about trying to cope with the stigma of shame in a town that is losing its old time values. A Burger Barn is coming to town and a new food chain is luring customers away from the old family businesses. Yet there is pride and loyalty, Even scenes which might be funny -- the family car tilting to starboard with Mom in the passenger seat--are so loaded with pathos that you don't dare laugh. As is the family name. The Grapes have experienced so much tragedy and loss that their name doesn't even register as comical.

A beautiful story of love, loyalty and dreams of escape.",1378166400,,1178,4.631578947368421

Don't look for any acting, directing or producing flaws in this movie because you will not find any! There are no words good enough to describe how perfect this movie is.

The title of this story is not an interrogative (no question mark), but rather a declarative statement.  The film shows us what is bothering Gilbert Grape.  However, the director never condescends to his audience as he leads us along.  These are a series of small moments, which in total tell the story of how a man and his brother break free of both the inner and outer bonds which hold them down and tie them to the place of their family history.

He is stuck in small town Iowa with his mentally retarded brother Arnie who is about to turn 18 and his dangerously overweight mother.  His younger sister is an annoyance and his older sister is the mom of the house.  Gilbert just wants to get out but doesn't quite know how.  Then a girl comes and shows him what he wants and helps him deal with the pain.

I bought it so my step-daughter, who is a fan of both Johnny Depp and Leonardo DiCaprio, could experience it as I did when I first saw it.  An amazing tale of a family on the brink of implosion that is held together by the eldest siblings doing the best they can.  Johnny Depp turns in a wonderful, touching performance as Gilbert Grape, but it is Leonardo DiCaprio who stuns with his portrayal as Gilbert's mentally-challenged younger brother, Arnie.  Leonardo was nominated for an Oscar for this role, and if you ask me, he should have WON!  Juliette Lewis is fantastic here as well, as the newcomer who shakes things up in the little town.  John C.

This movie, as dreary as it might seem at times, is one of the few that I can wholeheartedly recommend to just about anyone. It's a light drama, but depending on how you look at certain situations in the movie, it could also come off as a dark comedy. There's something for everyone here.

Gilbert Grape is a young man living in the small [fictional] town of Endora, Illinois with his two sisters, 500 pound mother and mentally challenged brother, Arnie. Gilbert's father committed suicide a while ago, and he's been doing his best to keep things going for the family by working in a small grocery store and repairing the house. When he's not working, Gilbert usually spends time with Arnie, whether it's doing fun things or getting Arnie out of trouble, like when he goes on yet another adventure trying to climb the water reservoir. Something is clearly bothering Gilbert, though he has a cool exterior and doesn't seem annoyed at his situation, but he appears to just be going with the flow of life, not trying to get anything more than what he's got. Even the affair he's having with a married woman comes off as a distraction more than anything else. But one day, a young woman and her grandmother come to Endora, passing through while on a trip and their car breaks down. She's different from everyone else he's known...could she be the shot in the arm that he needs?

Right off the bat in Gilbert's narration, he mentions that doctors said Arnie wasn't going to live longer than 6, but here he is about to turn 18. Whenever Arnie would go off and do something, I'd wonder ""is this it?"". Arnie doesn't realize just how easy it is to get hurt, and needs constant supervision. Even something as simple as taking a bath by himself isn't a good idea. Gilbert loves Arnie with all his heart, but how long can he deal with outbursts and laughter during inappropriate times? Screaming with joy that a Burger Barn is coming to town, during a funeral, would grind anyone's gears. The little grocery store that Gilbert works in never seems to have any business, especially now that a much larger store just a few miles away has opened up, and his boss is worried about it. Yet Gilbert insists that people will start coming back on a regular basis once things have settled down. We know the truth, and I'm pretty sure Gilbert knows the truth too. It might not sound that interesting, but it's the characters that drive this story, and the situations too. One of his friends is a mortician, played by Crispin Glover, and he's always eager to know how someone's doing, obviously wanting more business. Simply asking someone how their mom's doing always gets a little laugh out of me. Another friend, played by John C. Reilly, helps Gilbert with repairs now and then, but constantly brings up how great Burger Barn is, and how it'll help the city once one opens up. It's quaint conversations like this that somehow got my interest. These are plain, simple people with problems a lot of us can relate to in one way or another. How many more times is Gilbert going to slip under the cheating wife's husband's nose before he gets caught? How can someone so nice do something as heartless as letting a kid peek through his window to see his huge mom? What is it that will finally make Gilbert snap, having given so much in his life without getting anything in return?

Johnny Depp doesn't exactly stretch his acting abilities with this role, but it's such a plain character compared to what most people are used to, that it makes the character stand out. It's not up there with his performance in Ed Wood, but it's certainly worth watching for. Leonardo DiCaprio though, is the one that'll get most people. Just like how Depp loses himself in his character most of the time, Leo does it as Arnie. It's hard to believe that this is the same guy who's been in some of the biggest recent movies, or even as a troubled teen on Growing Pains. The rest of the cast does great as well, especially Darlene Cates as their mother. The anguish in her voice during certain scenes will send a chill up your spine.

What's Eating Gilbert Grape is the kind of movie you kinda have to be in the mood for. It's not a downer of a movie, but it's definitely not upbeat either. Give it a go on a slow, rainy weekend evening by yourself or with another person.",1347494400,2,4522,4.517704517704518

Shockingly her husband killed himself at the night.
She made a decision to leave Andora as many people seem to think there's a possibility that she killed her husband.

Becky are traveling with her grandmother around the U.S. The engine of their car doesn't work so that they had to stay there for a while.

One day while Gilbert is talking to Becky, Arnie climbed it again. This time officers took Armie to the station.
Their mother, Bonny, stands up to get Arnie. This was the first time to get out in 17 years.
Although she knew kids make fun of her as she is obese, she goes to the police station to get him. and she made it.

There is a opening party of the burger shop.
At the same day, the preparation of Arnie's birthday was processing,

The next morning, Arnie goes to her to wake up. But She didn't forever.
After her death the family broke up. They started their diffirent lives.
Gilbert seems to be looking for the way how to live with Arnie and Backy.

The plot I wrote might be boring for everyone.
It's hard to pick one thing as every scenes are marvelous.
Arnie is really cute. Leo had been a relly talented actor.
Gilbert is a nice brother, I dout I can find such a nice guy in the real world today.
Mom was struggling like a girl, but she showed her strength to save Arnie.
I guess everyone has a strength part when to save someone whom you love.

573123,4,6303124798,"I love this movie, but it's pretty hard for me to talk about it. The biggest reason (sorry) is Darlene Cates. You see, I have been morbidly obese, too, although not as large as she is. So on the one hand, I have real admiration for her courage in making this film, and I can appreciate how hard it must have been for her. On the other hand I am acutely aware of the fact that the only solution to the problem of Mama the screenplay writer could come up with was her death. She cries about how much of a burden she knows she is on her kids, and the next thing you know, she's dead. Was it suicide? It was her husband's suicide all those years ago that started her on her spiraling weight gain. That's another topic on which I am sensitive, as my husband committed suicide.

Then there is the incredibly real performance by Leonardo DiCaprio as Arnie, Gilbert Grape's retarded little brother. Sorry; I know the correct language is mentally impaired or something, but the performance is a stunningly accurate one of someone who is retarded, held back, limited, slow, developmentally disabled. He's a real handful, and because of Mama's limitations, he's mostly Gilbert's handful. Gilbert, of course, is played by the delicious Johnny Depp. Mrs. Carver (Mary Steenburgen) certainly finds him delicious. She, too, is hard to like, but easy to envy.

It's very hard to like Arnie, although one can have compassion for him. Just as it is very hard to like Gilbert's selfish little sister Ellen (Mary Kate Schellhardt), although one can't help sympathizing with the fact that her family has been an embarrassment to her all her life, and teen-agers are so sensitive about such things.

All in all, it's a story of people who are doing their best, and they do love each other, but their best just doesn't seem to work very well. It all falls on Gilbert, and when he finally finds a nice girl to get close to (Becky is played by Juliette Lewis), he ends up screwing up and hurting others just to try to get a little something for himself.

One touching scene occurs when Becky asks Gilbert what he wants, and he mentions all these things for his family. What do you want for yourself, she asks, possibly hoping he would say she was what he wanted. ""To be a good person,"" he replies. It's a four-star tear-jerker.",1336953600,2,2302,4.553140096618358

573227,5,6303124798,"If you've ever driven through one of those one-stoplight towns and wondered, ""Who lives here, and why?,"" then you'll understand what is eating Gilbert Grape. Gilbert is a young adult who lives with his morbidly obese mother Bonnie, his adult sister Amy, his teenaged sister Ellen, and his mentally challenged younger brother Arnie. Gilbert's older brother ""got away"" and his father is deceased (the details I'll leave out because they are important to the story).

Not much happens in Endora, Iowa, and not much ever will, to paraphrase Gilbert, until a series of events culminate on Arnie's eighteenth birthday.

The acting in this film is above par, especially that of Johnny Depp as Gilbert and Leonardo DiCaprio as Arnie. This was an early role for DiCaprio, before his Titanic fame, and it is in my opinion his best work to date. Whereas DiCaprio is able to play Arnie's emotions candidly and outlandishly, Depp plays the multidimensional, introspective Gilbert with subtlety, revealing his emotions through his facial expressions and his voice in a way that allows the audience to experience his feelings of frustration and bewilderment, feelings that occasionally brim over. Depp handles the role brilliantly.

Watched it nonstop the first time. Which I only say because I started it around midnight, had classes the next morning, but started being pulled into the movie so much that I had to finish it.

Is anyone surprised that these two are where they are today?

For me, an actor is successful when you totally forget that what you're seeing is a movie, not real life. What I was seeing, made me more sensitive to the plight of people in these situations. I was right in the middle of their lives, and even though I first saw What's Eating Gilbert Grape at least 15 years ago, that story has stayed with me to this day.

573338,5,6303124798,"""In the souls of the people the grapes of wrath are filling and growing heavy, growing heavy for the vintage."" The Grapes of Wrath

Each time I watch 'What's Eating Gilbert Grape?' I am transported in memory to the small town in which I was raised on the Western border of the panhandle of Idaho, population: pert near 90; almost all related one way or another. My uncle, four years younger than I, was diagnosed with several physical anomalies shortly after birth. Within a year or two, it became apparent that he was learning disabled. He tolerated several surgeries on his eyes and legs, and having seven older siblings giving him all kinds of attention, he thrived. Our small town became his little sovereign nation, of sorts, as did the Grape family and their house in the country. A sort of soft isolation which protects and nurtures can be a great defense for a while, at least. Eventually, though, the outside world must be allowed its chance to either toughen us up or do its damage. Arnie, Gilbert's affected brother, played brilliantly by Leo DiCaprio, and their mother each have issues away from the safety of home. Bonnie, having eaten herself to enormity after her husband abandons the family, so to speak, finds it very difficult both physically and emotionally to leave her house. Arnie, on the other hand, loves to take off with Gilbert whenever possible or flee into town and climb the water tower at will, regardless of consequences. Then, there is sister Ellen, a handful, who also lives at home. This leaves Gilbert, a teenager, toting a bulging load. Relief comes in the form of Becky, Juliette Lewis, who befriends Gilbert and becomes a conduit, bringing hope and dreams back to life for him.

This is by far one of my favorite movies of all time. The power behind this picture is in the alchemic synergy of Johnny Depp and Leo DiCaprio so closely paired in this great project. So many viewers have lauded DiCaprio for the genius he brought to his role, but without Depp's unique talent to receive and react...I don't know.

To sum it all up, as Gilbert puts a bandage on Arnie, he asks him, ""And why am I going to make it better?""

Arnie replies, ""Cause you are Gilbert.""

""Cause I am Gilbert,"" his brother reassures.

Before I rake it out, I have two positive things to say:  Johnny Depp acted well, and Leonardo DiCaprio, whom I generally cannot watch at all, portrayed the developmentally disabled boy impressively.

So, my beefs:

1) It reminded me of a non-comedic version of Pink Flamingos, which itself was only watchable because it was comedic.
2) Too much weirdness, not enough hook.  I'm not into gratuitous freak shows.
3) I didn't like the sexual undercurrent vibe -- creeped me out.  And when the middle aged lady started coming on to Johnny Depp's character I turned it off.  Too pervy and weird.

Starring Johnny Depp, Leonardo DiCaprio, Juliet Lewis, John C. Reilly (TV's Dr. Steve Broule!!!), and Mary Steemburgeon (sp?), there are great performances all around, but DiCaprio takes the cake here as a metally retarded teenager. I had forgotten how convincing he was in this as it had been about ten years since I had seen it. This usually isn't my kind of movie  being that I am a fan of the Spaghetti Westerns and Exploitation Movies of the 60's and 70's or the arty cinema types like Kubrick, Coppola or Lynch, but I gotta say that this is an enjoyable flick that my wife and I can agree on.

Wow, the story is deeply moving but it is to the credit of the director that he tells it in a clear, head-on, loving but unsentimental way.  A lesser director could have ruined it.

Then, the cast is wonderful.  Johnny Depp is so watchable!  It's not just that he is quite beautiful, but he has a depth and intelligence that few young actors possess.  His role is not as showy as that of the mentally challenged brother, but it's more to his credit that he gives so much within such emotional limitations.

All of the actors are first rate, including Mary Steenburgen, who gives a pitch perfect performance as the bored housewife who's having an affair with Gilbert. Juliett Lewis is a perfect match for Depp--as a free spirited girl who comes into his life when her grandmother's trailer breaks down.  She has a  one-of-a-kind smile that suits her perfectly for the role.

The most amazing performance is by a non-professional woman, Darlene Cates, who plays Gilbert's morbidly obese mother.  After I got over the shock of her physical appearance I was totally drawn in to her performance.  This would not have been an easy role for anyone and she played it beautifully.

If I had seen this movie long ago, I would not have dismissed Dicaprio as a pretty boy; he is such an outstanding actor that enhances the greatness of Depp's presence.

Depp does an excellent job in a James Dean type role--the charismatic, brooding young flyboy that is stuck in a little one horse town.

Juliette Lewis tones down her dysfunctional persona and turns in a stellar performance as the girlfriend.

Many will praise Johnny Depp, but my eye has always been on young Leo. Depp is pretty and all, so the book makers were obviously right to bet on him, but it is Leo who turns in the great performance. It is incredible. Curiously he hasn't changed all that much. He is THE great talent of his generation, very badly cast in masculine roles that call for boxing and tough guy stuff, for which he is ill suited. He retains to this day his youthful innocence that made him so appealing to the girls in ""Titanic."" He is no tough guy, though, and always seems weak and ill at ease in Scorsese films. He is a bit like Monty Clift, although many felt that Monty held his own against John Wayne. Come to think of it, Leo may not be the actor Monty was, after all he has done no stage work.

Gilbert (Johnny Depp) feels trapped: his younger brother, a high maintenance problem is mentally challenged (in a brilliant acting job by Leonardo Di Caprio), his mother is reclusive and grossly overweight at 500 pounds, he's in a deadend job in a small grocery store trying to compete with a giant supermarket, he's fooling around with a married woman (beautifully played by Mary Steenburger), and he's stuck in the deadened small town of Endora which equals Endure. DiCaprio's character loves to climb water towers, trees, roofs, and it's challenging to keep an eye on him.
Gilbert's problems are too much for any one man to handle, but he finds love in a girl who is trapped in town when her truck-pulling trailer breaks down. Pick-up trucks are almost characters in this flick.
 The 1993 movie is blessed by an unusually large number of individual three-dimensional character studies. Minor roles are fleshed out, and real people emerge. It's a film that doesn't try to sugarcoat or look for easy solutions. At the beginning Gilbert shows some mean streaks in his attitude toward his mother, but the developing story brings out tenderness and love. It has its comic moments, its sad bits, but manages to keep the audience involved. The family's father is gone, and Gilbert is standing in for him, up to his hips in mire. The only way out is the highway leading out of the small burg, but can that offer real salvation to Gilbert?",1221782400,4,1524,4.839080459770115

This movie is both fun and sad. Mostly it's sad though. Johnny Depp plays Gilbert Grape. He's a young man with the weight of the world on his shoulders. He has a mom who hasn't come out of the house in years since his father committed suicide in the basement. He has a brother with a disability who is unable to care for himself. And, to top it off, he has three other sisters to watch out for. Try juggling that while working at a grocery store, having an affair with an insurance salesman's wife, and falling in love with a young woman who is only in town for a short period of time.

They live in a small town in Iowa that is going no where. His only friends is the local mortician and a handyman with a dream of owning a Burger Barn.

Over the summer, everything changes for him. The aforementioned young lady has caught his eye, his brother's eighteenth birthday is nearing, a super mega grocery store has opened outside of town, and his own emotional needs are coming to a head.

It's a really good movie and I'm looking forward to reading the book now so I can see what all was left out. I highly recommend you watching this movie at the very least.",1218412800,,1407,4.1054545454545455

We have a disabled son and can relate completely to the agonies and joys of raising such a special human being (not to mention the extreme toils and sacrifices it requires daily, as the character of Gilbert show us).

This is the first movie I associated with Johnny Depp, and he didn't let me down.

We have Gilbert, basically stuck in a bad situation, working at a grocery store, having an affair, constantly having to answer for why his mentally ill brother is climbing the water tower or eating the cake in the fridge. If his brother gets in trouble, then his mother has to come into town to bail him out, which is more of an embarrassment for Gilbert because his mother is very overweight. The movie is very sad, and you will find yourself crying through a few parts of it. I love Juliette Lewis in this role too, a far cry from natural born killers, but she starts to show Gilbert that there is more to life.

573813,5,6303124798,"This is a film that inspires people of all ages, cultures, and sensibilities.

Along with ""Groundhog Day"", personally, this film is one to pull off the shelf when feeling down, and see what caring, giving, placing one's family above one's own wants and needs, ensuring all are as happy as they can be...be who you are, the best you can be though life sometimes never provides the right circumstances, though Gilbert is the person we SHOULD aspire to, because he's virtuous to the point where, the viewer cannot understand why he  is so selfless, but hopefully, by the end of the film, will...

Lasse Hallstr&ouml;m, a Swedish filmaker agreed to do the film because of the novel by Peter Hedges who also wrote the screenplay. Together, these two men created a subtle drama where values, to be virtuous, to simply be a good person without realizing it, makes this film simply one of a kind.

Johnny Depp as Gilbert is superb as the selfless giver, and carer of his mentally disabled brother, played with utter reality by Leonardo de Caprio. At the time, de Caprio was a little boy though received an Oscar nomination that launched this actor into a successful career, which has proved he has the right ""stuff"" to portray anyone, a natural actor.

One of the interesting casting stories is that Bonnie, Darelene Cates, `Momma"", was not a professional actor, but chosen from the town where the film was shot. (What a beautiful presentation)! Later, particularly when, after not leaving her home for 7 Years, as she is morbidly obese, rescues her little boy from jail; what a performance, and her expressions as she leaves the jail while the crowd look at her as a freak is simply, well, moving.

Becky (Juliette Lewis) is Gilbert's mentor, revealing that there is a big world out there and he should experience it. Lewis is gorgeous, another natural actor, where this film, again, launched her career as a special talent.

This film is a subtle masterpiece, a film that shows the goodness of some human beings and the potential to see and experience the beauty of the world.

A tragedy, satire, comedy, romance and reality all rolled into one.

It is interesting to note that Depp,DiCaprio and Lewis have all, at one time, been listed as Hollywood's ""most intriguing actors""!.This, to me, lies the greatness and the heart of this touching 1993 look at confused,repressed and quirky people in a dead Texas town called Endora!

GILBERT GRAPE has ALL the earmarks of that greatness to come.
First off, if you have no patience with intimate films that have deliberate character development and no action, you may want to pass. If you relish great acting and a rising action story line, then read on!
Gilbert is the second son of five on whom his entire family hangs! The oldest son flew the coup, the father committed suicide, the mother is a depressed obese and, the youngest son is a retarded boy who was not supposed to live, and the two sisters seem to have their own issues in life. Gilbert (expertly crafted by Depp) is the model of restraint and co-dependent behaviour as he cares for all of his family. But what is eating at Gilbert? He should be exploding any minute, but his feelings seem so repressed as he runs after his younger brother (DiCaprio- who received an Oscar nom),helps to deal with his Mother's depression and 500 pound+ obesity and also work in a dead end job as a grocery store stock boy. In fact, the only sign that Gilbert has any life in him, is when he delivers groceries to an older and married housewife (Oscar winner Mary Steenburgen,as only she could deliver this performance!)where Gilbert finds himself somewhat entrapped,but afraid to let go. Enter Becky, a passer-through Airstream trailer girl whose rig breaks down in Endora. It is this relationship that awakens Gilbert and the rest of the family to confront all of the repressed and suppressed feelings as a family that somehow functions. Every performance in this film is A+ and should be viewed for the quality of acting and adeptness at direction and screenplay.
The Special Edition has wonderful interviews with the cast and director that give perspective of people who can now look back at the film and examine it with fresh perspective. One of the best Special Editions on DVD and well worth the $$$.",1203724800,,3460,5.949799196787149

573911,5,6303124798,"One of these films that are an essential step in the career of an actor. It was true for Leonardo DiCaprio who got his first Academy Award and Golden Globe nominations for the role of a differently-abled kid . It is true he does a good job in that part and he is a brilliant couple with Johnny Depp as his bigger brother. The film is entertaining though on many other levels. The survival of a small town in the US at a time when big shopping malls are opening everywhere. These small towns are doomed to die sooner or later. Their only chance is to become suburban development projects and become the home of people working in the big city next door who want to live away from the hectic activity of the city and commute there every day. We are before this development in Endora. The second interest is the fate of a family in which there is a mentally disabled child. Here they have no opportunity to provide him with an education and some professional activity. So he is more or less attached to a member of his family and he is haunting if not even worse that brother of his, as well as the police and neighbors. It is never vicious but it is really bothering those who want to have peace and quiet. The place of mentally disabled people in our society is something difficult to envisage because they are necessarily a burden to normative people and a normative system that has to adapt to them and not the reverse. Today things have changed a lot, thanks to such films probably, definitely. Then the film attaches itself to showing the mother who is an extremely obese person, her shame, her humiliation, her lot that is close to an ordeal. The film shows how dependent she is on her own family, on her own children, the father having died a long time before. And the film tries to show her under the best light they can afford.  On her disabled son's birthday, after having accepted to be introduced to her elder son's girl friend (a young woman who had to stop in Endora with her mother and their travelling bus for a couple of weeks because of the breakdown of the car they travel in), after climbing back up to the second floor bedroom of the house for the first time in many years and lying there on her back, she dies without any kind of pain or noise with her disabled son calling for her to wake up. The film though has a strange ending. The children decide to burn her in the house since she cannot be taken down. A domestic pyre for the mother and a complete liberation for the children who are scattered away now they are homeless. The burial of old civilizations, of the Hinduist tradition. Amazing. And yet it is not the end. A last scene shows how the elder brother is recuperated by his girlfriend who comes back to pick him up and away from Endora and by picking one she gets two because the disabled brother comes along too. That's what happens when a mechanical incident forces you to stop over in a lost village in the countryside for a couple of weeks. You get trapped in some kind of sentimental cage like the disabled brother's crickets in his glass jar where he raises them. A good decent softly entertaining film.

It tells the story that everyone knows, but won't talk about. A family who loves one another desperatly, but can't seem to find the words to express it. It's not just about any one character in particular, it's about the Family as a whole. Though they may seem disfunctional, they are completly normal and they are about each and every one of us. Each character in this film speaks to someone on a personal level. Those of us who have had a developementally disabled relative, the teenager who is annoyed by everyone and everything, the one who is the ""Adult"" in the family, the one who takes care of everything and wants to get away but can't, and the relative that is different from most and we try to pretend they don't exisit...at least not to us. Gilbert Grape tells us that we're okay. Everyone is different and that makes each and every one of us special in our own way. Imagine your family for just a moment without the mentally challenged relative, or the quirky teenager exploring the big world ahead of them, or the one that the family pretends doesn't exisit. Your life would be forever changed dramatically without them. It teaches us that we should embrace those people in our lives, love them, qualify their existence, to be a family, because in a moment, they could be gone.

Lead star Depp is cast as the caretaker of a rundown house, a mother who's given up all hope, a cranky sister, and a 12 year old brother with the I.Q. of a 4 year old. Add to this mix Depp's holding a job, trying to find an appropriate girlfriend, and attempting to fend off an unhappily married female, and one has all the ingredients for a walking powder keg. Particularly troubling is Depp's younger brother, brilliantly portrayed by Leo DiCaprio, whose main hobbies include running away, climbing trees, and attempting to scale the town watertower. This is a view of Americana that many deny even exists; yet is possibly as prevalent as better known inner city dilemmas. Think poverty knows boundary lines?

573914,4,6303124798,"The 1993 on-screen version of Peter Hedges' quirky novel What's Eating Gilbert Grape is a really fine motion picture to see. Under its surface goings-on What's Eating Gilbert Grape has much to say about guilt, love, duty, family loyalty, and the power of all these things to enslave. Playing the title character, Johnny Depp is expectedly superb with his restrained, sensitive performance as a good-hearted, overburdened young man struggling to be all things to too many people, and long before Titanic, a then little known Leonardo DiCaprio proved his acting skills as Depp's risk-taking retarded younger brother, Arnie. (So adept at acting was DiCaprio here that I can remember people asking if ""that kid from Growing Pains"" really was retarded.)

What's Eating Gilbert Grape is a thoughtful movie. As what remains of his youth drifts toward conclusion and life seems in danger of passing him by, Gilbert Grape lives his days in a static prairie town, working for a corner grocery, overseeing his sisters, his mentally disabled brother, and his mother, who is shut-in by her disfiguring obesity. Grape feels obligated to take on many roles, breadwinner, dutiful son, loyal employee, and he does all this so thoroughly that there is no space in his own existence for himself. At times Grape allows his imagination to wander and he dreams of moving on and finding a place in the outer world, but always he feels the tug of what holds him behind. When one day a whim of fate brings the girl of his dreams into town, Grape is finally forced to confront the roles he plays for others: and Grape's decision will probably surprise many.

As it flows through its deliberately-paced run-time What's Eating Gilbert Grape becomes like a river that alters its channel several times before reaching its destination, and the events that transpire between its opening and ending have the power to shock and sadden, but also make you feel like cheering. There just aren't too many movies out there like this one, and that's part of why so many have found it so special.",1193702400,,2055,4.902298850574713
573915,5,6303124798,"What's Eating Gilbert Grape captures the lives and inner struggles of its characters with a rare tenderness and realism, thanks in part to truly shining performances on the part of its cast. Leonardo DiCaprio, in particular, plays to perfection the role of Arnie, a mentally handicapped teenager, immersing himself in the character with stunning talent. The focus of the film is Gilbert (played by Johnny Depp), a young man in an isolated, rural community who suppresses his own hopes and desires out of loyalty to a family he alternately views as a burden and a blessing. His selfless devotion becomes increasingly unbearable when the free-spirited Becky (Juliette Lewis) appears in his life, then prepares to leave the town where Gilbert is anchored. As his lifelong self-denial becomes harder to maintain, Gilbert neglects and lashes out at his younger brother, but his genuine love for his brother remains undying, as does his devotion to his mother, of whom he is sometimes ashamed because of her extreme obesity. Darlene Cates gives a beautiful, heartfelt performance as Bonnie Grape despite the fact she is not a professional actress, perhaps because of her identification with the character (Cates, who weighs 500 pounds, was chosen for the part after her appearance on Sally Jessie Raphael, where she described being imprisoned by her weight). Although Bonnie's weight makes her the laughing stock of the small town, her love for her children prompts her to gather her courage and leave the house for the first time in years after Arnie is taken in by the police for climbing a water tank.

Oscar nominee DiCaprio gives a remarkably tender performance as Arnie, a mentally challenged kid who's difficult to deal with but impossible not to love. Hallstrom develops the quirkier aspects of Hedges's story--including Gilbert's involvement with a lonely wife and a worldly newcomer--with a light comic touch. Excellent support from Lewis, John C.

She hadn't seen it, asked who was in the cast and when i told her Johnny Depp, Juliette Lewis and Leonardo she rolled her eyes in mortification.  And vowed never to watch it. ha ha

It was made before Leonardo was recognisable by a single name, and at the time, I believed that Arnie was irrefutably autistic.  I don't know if it is a deliberate ploy, but Leonardo seems to focus on the way a charater would use their nose, touch it, lead with it, smell people for reassurance which is so authentic to someone with autism.

574029,5,6303124798,"He's got a mother that weighs 400 pounds, or maybe it's 600.  There's a married woman who can't keep her hands off of him whose husband would like to kill him.  He's got a younger brother that is cuckoo, and he's responsible for him.  He's got to take care of him.  He works in a grocery store.  His life is about groceries.  Honk if you've got groceries...

He's trapped in Endora, somewhere, probably Kansas or Nebraska or Iowa (actually filmed in Texas), somewhere in the heart of the Heartland--by the way this is the sort of American film that plays as a foreign film in, say, France or Sweden.  Along comes Juliette Lewis who's a bit of a short-haired punk to his long-haired country (""Get in the car, longhair"").  He is wallowing in self-pity and she sees it.  ""What about you?"" she asks.  ""What do you want?""

She attracts him and frightens him.  She may make him upset his predictable life as Job.  And then one day, he loses it and hits Arnie, and hits him again.  Who can blame him?  But you don't hurt Arnie.  He is just a boy who will always be a boy.

Johnny Depp is Gilbert Grape, Leonardo DiCaprio is Arnie, Mary Steenburgen is the married woman, Juliette Lewis is Becky and Darlene Cates is Mama.  They all give sterling performances.  The script and direction are flawless.  You've probably seen bits and pieces of this movie on TV.  See the whole thing.  It is an outstanding flick.  Gilbert is an America hero.  He knows the good and the bad, and he always tries to do the good.  But it's tough.  Life is an embarrassment and a boredom, and when it isn't boring, it's scary emotionally.  Depp is perfectly cast as a man whose loyalty to his family and his love for them has trapped him.  And they are using him, and they don't appreciate him.  His father disappeared.  His older brother is gone.  Gilbert has the responsibility.  And he knows it.  And he can't escape it.

But it's hard, and when Becky comes along, she is something different.  She is something he's never seen before.  She isn't predictable, and she is striking.  And she is smart and sensitive, like him.

Don't answer the phone.  Don't answer the door.  This is a heartland masterpiece about real people living real lives, and director Lasse Halstrom (The Cider House Rules (1999) Chocolat (2000) after many Swedish films) doesn't flinch and he doesn't do cliches, and he gets it right.

Lasse hallstrom, the quiet achiever of directors has used his skills and chosen cast to produce another masterpiece of entertainment. It is a roller coaster of emotional involvement from bemused and even grotesque fascination of the very fat 500lb Mama to the inspirational admiration of the unselfish Gilbert Grape (Johhy Depp) who holds his family together and cares totally for Arnie, (Leonardo DiCaprio) his mentally handicapped brother.

DiCaprio certainly made a mockery of the Oscar voting system by not winning the Oscar after being nominated for his award winning portrayal of the unfortunate Arnie.

574118,5,6303124798,"`What's Eating Gilbert Grape' is one of those rare accomplishments in cinema where you learn something about yourself while you watch the credits role.  This is a film that, instead of focusing all its efforts in developing a plot heavy script, creates an atmosphere that absorbs the viewer into the hearts of the central characters, forcing us to look at these people, their everyday lives, their ordinary, and compare their feelings and emotions to our own.  We watch Gilbert (Johnny Depp) as he takes the reigns of his dysfunctional family and tries his hardest to make things better for them, with almost no recognition and or appreciation.  We watch Gilbert battle his feelings of abandonment and his almost innate desire to abandon those around him, to think about himself for a change.  We watch Gilbert selflessly do the right thing regardless of the fact that no one notices and we pray that we have a little Gilbert in is all.

Gilbert's home life is far from normal.  Having suffered the suicide of his father at a young age he was left to take care of his two sisters Amy (Laura Harrington) and Ellen (Mary Kate Schellhardt), his mentally challenged brother Arnie (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his obese mother Bonnie (Darlene Cates) who hasn't left the house since her husband died.  Gilbert works for a local family run grocer that's slowly going out of business due to the `Wal-Mart' type super center that's come to town.  He has a few good friends, more notably Tucker (John C. Reilly) who helps out around the house, and with the influx of vacationers he has a new love interest Becky (Juliette Lewis) who's stranded in town with her Grandmother (Penelope Branning) due to a broken-down truck.  This new girl also strikes jealosy in the eyes of Betty Carver (Mary Steenburgen) the married mother of two whom Gilbert has been `servicing' for a while now.

The film, as I said, is less plot driven and more character driven.  It really builds its characters strongly, letting us know everyone in the cast and realize their dreams, their motives and their fears.  The strongest relationship built is between Gilbert and his brother Arnie, and this of course is driven mostly by DiCaprio's brilliant performance.  Leonardo is so convincing, so calculated and brilliant in his delivery that it's hard to grasp the concept that he isn't handicapped.  This has to be one of the most realistic performances in recent years (if you count 13 years recent).  As you watch Gilbert's reaction to Arnie and everyone around him you can see his deep love and concern for his brother...it's touching...moving even.

I think that best describes this film.  Touching and moving, for it truly is.  Driven by wonderful performances, DiCaprio and Cates leading the pack by completely becoming absorbed in their characters, this is truly a brilliantly made film.  Every character, every performance is different than the next and aided only by the strength of the next.  Depp in particular feeds off the rest of the cast in order to survive, for even though his story may be the most important it's also the least interesting (I'll explain in a minute) and so he steals his glory from the strength of others.  That's not a nark on Depp at all; it's just that his character is so selfless and so caring that he's almost...boring.  Depp plays Gilbert with such subtlety that he almost appears to have no emotion (except for a few scenes, the scene where he hits Arnie for one)...and this is something that could have easily caused him to sink into the background, but instead of allowing that to happen, as I mentioned, Depp uses the strength of his cast mates performances to propel him further instead of drown him out.

Johnny Depp is stupendous as the taciturn title character who is the rock and support mechanism of the Grapes after the absence of the father.  Darlene Cates is a real find as the morbidly obese Momma.  Cates evokes the tragedy of her character with little pathos.  The best performance here comes from Leonardo DiCaprio as the mentally handicapped Arnie.  I cannot recall a performance in any other film where retardation was presented so realistically and it's even more amazing when considering DiCaprio's relative youth at the time.  The American heartland is also beautifully lensed by Ingmar Bergman's longtime cinematographer Sven Nykvist.  In a word, essential viewing.",1149984000,13,993,5.3076923076923075

This movie has to have one of the cheesiest titles in history, but that's the only bad thing that can be said about it. What's Eating Gilbert Grape is both powerful and poignant. From the opening shot, it creates a realistic mood that only dissipates upon completion. The film is funny, joyous, anxious, and depressing which means that it is an accurate reflection of the emotions most of us go experience everyday. The plot is interesting but it is the characters that make it so memorable. As far as the acting goes, I agree with the other reviewers as Johnny Depp are Leonardo DiCaprio are outstanding. With Depp, his portrayal of Gilbert is both sedate and authentic. His skill makes the audience temporarily forget that this modelesque guy with golden locks would rarely be found in a sleepy Iowa town. Concerning DiCaprio, few thespians could play a mentally retarded child with such aplomb. I have to admit that I've never really liked his work, but DiCaprio deserves his due here. My only reservation was that I thought the depiction of rural life was a little over the top with John C. Reilly's character being more a caricature than an actual person.

There plot is interesting, enough, and the romance is fine, but neither of them are in themselves interesting enough to create a compelling movie. The two people who do that are Depp and DiCaprio. Leonardo DiCaprio is 100% convincing as Arnie Grape, a mentally retarded young man from a dysfunctional family. After seeing it for the first time, my pop-culture staved friend asked me if the person playing Arnie was in fact mentally retarded. Depp is also convincing as Gilbert Grape, and performs as much through his face as through his voice. Juliette Lewis, however, is just...weird. She talks and acts basically like a druggie, and her performance in the trailers alone almost prevented me from seeing the movie.

The plot is basically a chronicle of the weeks leading up to Arnie's 18th birthday. He has a morbidly obese mother, a resentful 15 year old sister, and his older brother and sister who act as the mother and father figure for the family.

Mr. Grape married the prettiest girl in town, and fathered the kids in the movie, but the house is not stable, and the family is not stable.  The family is left to survive in the house his dad built on a careless, wrongly-built foundation.  The mother hides inside the house built by the father, who hanged himself.  Just like the house is being held together by the inept efforts of young Gilbert, nailing up little pieces of wood down in the basement, so is the family.  The book reveals more than the movie that Gilbert's buddy, who helps with the basement, is kind of fixated with Gilbert's mom.  Gilbert's buddy, as well as the town's policeman is attracted to her, the image of the prettiest girl in town going to ruin.  Poor Gilbert is doing the best he can, and Johnny Depp does a great job portraying the heroic efforts of this better than average young man.  DeCaprio is equally great as Depp's younger, mentally handicapped brother, who ties Gilbert to his dying home town, his job at a dying grocery store, and his crumbling house.  Notice how Arnie keeps trying to climb?  The water tower has a lot of symbolic value, too.  This movie is almost too good to be a movie.  It has very deep meaning, especially to those of us who have lived the reality of the Grape family's precarious existence.  I would give this movie infinite stars.",1144972800,,1519,4.449275362318841

574311,2,6303124798,"To add to the reviews already written, I would like to focus on the character of Gilbert Grape's mother. However, unlike most of the other reviews here, my comments are critical of this film.

Johnny Depp plays  the middle son in a dysfunctional small town North American Family. The elder son is at college, the younger son is mentally disabled (two sisters are also presnet, though merely as additional signs of a `problem family'), and we find out  that the father hanged himself some years before. But Gilbert's greatest resentment is towards his mother. She is very fat, becoming so after her husband's death, and has not left the house since. She is so fat that she has (apparently) impaired the foundations of the house and the scene reflecting this is noteworthy, because it is only when Mom stands up and stamps her foot in anger that Depp's character realises that the house in unstable. Mom's anger becomes physically too much for the house.

The character of Mom functions as a spectacle in this film. Depp allows small boys to come and peep at her watching television. People stare at her when she ventures out of the house to collect her younger son from the sheriff's office. When Depp meets the Juliette Lewis character, he initially refuses to let her meet Mom. When they do finally meet, Mom is mortified and attempts to explain away her size to Lewis ""I wasn't always like this"". Lewis, who repeats pretty much the same phrase, standing with Depp looking down on Mom in her chair, is portrayed as gracious and kind, yet this scene evokes an uneasy realisation that this intercourse is not between three equal human beings. Mom is presented entirely as lacking. And though Depp's character does achieve some level of peace with Mom, the events that follow are shocking in what they represent (though, given Western culture`s obsessions around fatness and thinness, hardly surprising.)

Mom goes up to bed for the first time in years, and dies. After the authorities inform the family that Mom's corpse will have to be lifted from the house by Crane Gilbert, terrified of the humiliation this will bring, he says, to her, undertakes with his siblings to burn the house with Mom inside.

The end of the film shows Depp and his younger brother (the sisters despatched somewhere else) waiting for Lewis to come and take them away in her camper van. What is interesting here is that a male character, Gilbert's brother (Leo DiCaprio, Oscar-nominated for this role), young impetuous, mentally disabled and often a danger to himself, is allowed to survive and make demands on Depp's character, even while the film-maker kills off the mother.

What does Mom represent? I believe a number of anxieties: various excesses of U.S. culture; `dysfunctional' families and the demands they make on individuals; fear of women, terrifyingly erotic (Dicaprio's character is very attached physically to him mother) but also seen as `too much';  fear of difference. Her death is a not too subtle plot device to destroy the source of such anxieties. The presentation of Mom's predicament (apart from Gilbert) as something she might have overcome, maybe by losing some of her weight, ore merely by confronting her own traumas and overcoming them, just could not have been achieved in this film. Mom was never meant to be a person, a subject: she could only function as a spectacle, an object of the audience's gaze.

So, for some people in the audience at least, this movie is not warm, or profound. It is certainly not `feel- good,' and there is an ever present tone of contempt for those families who, through events beyond their control, find themselves in predicaments of ill health, bereavement,  poverty, and social exclusion. There is also a gender hierarchy underlying the film's message. This is a very uncomfortable film to watch, and not because it is at all 'challenging': indeed it challenges nothing.

I will say this though. While watching this film, even while feeling anger at the engineered death of Mom's character, I found humour in that plot, and in the idea of the house's foundations being at risk: not because I found Mom's problems amusing in a futile attempt to distance myself from her  (that is, an attempt to resolve any feelings of incongruity): but because I recognised the scenes merely reflected the predictable, transparent and rather absurd fixations of the film maker. I was laughing at the film-maker, not Mom.",1139616000,7,4442,4.900133155792277

I think the Amazon reviewer said something about this should have been the movie he won an award for five years before Titanic and I could not agree more. This movie touches on some difficult issues like dealing with someone who is mentally challenged, a woman so obese and depressed she confines herself to a couch while Johnny Depp as Gilbert Grape, who helps care for his two sisters and Arni (DiCaprio) his retarded brother.

His two sisters add to his burden as does an unfaithful wife and traveling woman in a streamline trailer. Gilbert endures the given facts of his dull, uneventful and nondescript life with seemingly limitless patience. He further accepts the troubling circumstances of his half-wit brother who persistently seeks the summits of a city water tower. His world drifts from tedium to tedium until finally it explodes with an unexpected but understandable rage.

As depressing as the story is, there is something positive about it though I cannot point that out very well. Perhaps the positive and accepting attitude of main characters contrast with the dark and sad story content, and because of the sadness the positive attitude shines through the movie in a subtle yet profound way.

Acting in the movie is exceptionally well done, as well as the selection of castings, sound, and art in the movie.  Over all, this is a well made movie.",1126915200,2,612,4.446428571428571

574319,5,6303124798,"This is a sad story about a lonely, depressed man living a life that is surrounded by complete chaos. ""Poor Gilbert,"" is all I can say. It is truly a touching, emotional movie, and I assure that every viewer of this movie will sympathize with Gilbert and his completely wrecked life.

Gilbert Grape (Depp) lives with his mother, two sisters, and brother in an old rotting house in a small dead town. His father committed suicide in their basement several years ago. One sister is bothersome and cruel. His mother became severely depressed after the death of her husband and gained so much weight that Gilbert refers to her as a ""beached whale."" The saddest of Gilbert's problems is his younger brother, Arnie (DiCaprio). Arnie is a mentally retarded teenager, and he is not expected to live very long. Despite all of this, Gilbert is selfless and does everything humanly possible for his hopeless family. Most important is Gilbert's relationship with Arnie. Gilbert loves and takes care of Arnie, and he swears to never let anything happen to him. Many more depressing events occur in this movie, but Gilbert does meet a carefree young woman (Juliette Lewis) who shows him that life doesn't have to be perfect to feel happy.

This is yet another unsurpassable performance by Johnny Depp. Johnny is the only actor I know that makes the viewer feel what he's feeling solely by the expressions he makes on his face. No other actor can convey so much emotion without speaking. And although I am not by any means a Leonardo DiCaprio fan, I must admit his acting in this movie was phenomenal. Truly believable.

I know this movie sounds like a total downer, but believe me, it is a spectacular movie worth watching. The acting, the story, the character development...it is all terrific. Watching this movie will make you a better person.",1124409600,5,1831,4.806349206349206

Johnny Depp gives a marvelous performance as Gilbert, the ""father figure"" to his mentally retarded brother, an amazingly brilliant Leonardo diCaprio.  There is so much love and frustration conveyed in the scenes these two megastars inhabit, and considering it was before they became superstars, it's a credit to these young men's acting abilities.  The film is fleshed out with remarkable supporting turns from John C. Reilly and Crispin Glover as Gilbert's buddies; Mary Steenburgen as the flirtatious housewife who makes sure she gets ""special deliveries"" from Gilbert; Kevin Tighe as Steenburgen's hyper insurance salesman husband; Juliette Lewis as the young girl who brings Gilbert into his own world; and of course, Darlene Cates, who plays Gilbert's morbidly obese mother---a self-imposed recluse who sits in her sofa, eating and watching TV, a brilliant performance for a woman who had never acted before.  The film's tragic tone is softened by some scenes of hilarity, and the ending is truly a sad, but effective, one.  Leonardo richly deserved his Oscar nod, and truth be told, should have won...it is a remarkable performance.  A truly wonderful movie.",1115856000,6,1323,5.424390243902439
574412,4,6303124798,"What's Eating Gilbert Grape was one of the most realistic films I have ever seen.  My favorite actor, Johnny Depp, gave one heck of a performance as the loner Gilbert, who has so much responsibility: his mentally disabled brother Arnie, brilliantly portrayed by Leonardo diCaprio, his two sisters, his morbidly obese mother (one excellent performance by Darlene Cates).  The movie basically centers around Gilbert and his dysfunctional family and all the problems they're having, and how their mom hadn't left the house for over 7 years, and how Gilbert had to work a lot to be able to feed her and the family.  Grape was so moving, just so realistic. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars, however, is because the special features only have the theatrical trailer.  I thought this DVD screamed extras!  I really would've liked to see interviews with the cast, director, producer, etc, especially with Leo for his very demanding character.  I would've liked to see how he had to prepare for that role, because he was just so magnificent and so believable, so deserving of the Oscar nod.  I also would've liked to see an interview with Cates.  It's a shame, the movie was so deserving of 5 stars, I normally don't like to take stars away from something so deserving as this, if it were the VHS version, it would've gotten 5 from me...truly powerful!",1113436800,6,1351,4.76824034334764

Never have I seen Leonardo DiCapprio in such a well acted part as Arnie, who is a retarded teenager and brother to Johnny Depp's title role. Leonardo certainly should have taken home the Oscar for which he was nominated as best supporting actor for this part. His performance was flawless in everyway. Johnny Depp shows great depth of character as a young man who finds himself the head of a family consisting of two sisters, the youngest of whom is a thorn in his side, a 500 pound mother who barely functions, and his retarded brother (DiCapprio). Living and working in a small town with no hope of escape from a difficult life, Depp has turned to an affair with a married woman for diversion but begins to feel devoured even by that. A breath of fresh air blows into town in the person of a girl who is just passing through but lingers long enough to stir up a spark of real life and hope in this previously hopeless extistance and Gilbert(Depp) fights to hang on to that spark. Though there is heartache, embarrassment, and tragedy in this movie, it has an uplifting resolution. The entiire cast is great and very believable. Depp is deep and DiCapprio is brilliant. Even if you don't like either of these actors, this movie is a must see because it is truly fine art.

Even I have to admit though that this movie is one of my all time favorites.  The portrayal of all of the charectors in this movie and their quirks are incredible.  In books, you hope that the charector devepment will do the charectors justice by the end of the book.  In movies, you just hope for any charector development at all.  In this movie though, the charector development does the charectors more than justice, it's incredible.

The movie is more of a drama than a comedy, though it has some very funny scenes. Johnny Depp plays Gilbert Grape and does a fantastic job of portraying a man held captive by responsibilities and love, yet wanting something more. This film captures ""family"" bonds in a way that few do.

But really, you must see Leonardo's performance as a retarded (or perhaps autistic) child, its unbelievably great. He almost received a best supporting actor oscar for this performance, and it was an oversight that Tommy Lee Jones got it instead.",1104883200,,727,4.761904761904762

574502,5,6303124798,"""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"" is a deeply moving glimpse into the frustration, sadness and triumph of love in what some would classify as a dysfunctional family. As the mentally retarded Arnie, Leonardo DiCaprio turns in an incredibly realistic performance; his gestures, his often repetitive speech...everything about his acting seems so perfect for the role he plays. (And I say this as one who has worked with the mentally retarded). It is no wonder he received an Oscar nomination. The story is told mainly through the eyes of Johnny Depp's character, Gilbert who despite his deep love for Arnie is still frustrated by the limitations that caring for Arnie places on his life. Top that off with a morbidly obese mother whom Gilbert is (reluctantly) ashamed of and a younger sister who is an oftentimes irritating troublemaker and you can see why Gilbert sometimes yearns for life to be a little easier. As a clerk in the local grocery store, Gilbert has fallen into a relationship with an older married woman (played by Mary Steenburgen) but finds himself drawn to a new girl in town (Juliette Lewis) with whom he develops a friendly, then caring relationship. Strained relations with the town's law enforcement officials ensue after Arnie repeatedly climbs the water tower and Arnie is arrested. Gilbert's mother played by Darlene Cates) who hasn't left the house in seven years, takes matters into her own hands and the results are at once triumphant and tragic. Depp is marvelous as Gilbert. His sense of despair and self hatred after he loses control and hits Arnie seem totally realistic and understandable. The younger sister who seems like such a brat at the beginning becomes more humanized as we see her vulnerability. The mother's battle with shame and humiliation over her obesity makes us all more attuned to our own shameful insensitivity. Quirky, no doubt, sad - no doubt again. But ultimately, ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"" turns out to be a testament to love, caring and family loyalty. A marvelous movie.",1095984000,184,2025,5.01186943620178

574504,5,6303124798,"..Well that's very simple. It's Gilbert's (Johnny Depp) disfunctional family. His brother (Leonardo DiCaprio) is mentally challenged, his mother (Darlene Cates) is morbidly obese, his youngest sister is a brat, there is also a house wife (Mary Steenburgen) who orders groceries from the store Gilbert works at, she has reasons of her own that does not include the need for food. She's quite capable of going to the supermarket herself. Let's just say she has more than a little thing for Gilbert. Gilbert's father passed away years earlier. Now only himself and the older sister seem able to take care of the home and family. I would like to mention that actress Darlene Cates has lost over 200 lbs. since this film was made. What's Eating Gilbert Grape is a wonderful, funny, sad and off beat drama that is sure to have something for everyone. I think it was very silly for one reviewer to say that this film makes fun of obesity and mentally impaired people. Are we not ever to have these types of characters in movies? I'm not sure if this person watched the entire film. It does have a positive message about these issues. This film doesn't make fun it only points out ignorance in people who do. When you see an overweight person do you stare at them? What if they are very overweight? I really liked the scene when Gilbert's mother said ""I haven't always been like this."" and Becky (Juliette Lewis) said ""I haven't always been like this either."" As if Becky didn't even notice that Gilbert's mother was of a beyond plus size. I myself work with mentally challenged kids everyday so Arnie just seemed like a kid to me. But in reality I have to say Leonardo DiCaprio was superb. On a less superb note however the DVD has zero extras. Well I guess if you wanna call having a theatrical trailer an extra feature go right ahead. I think a few featurettes and a director commentary is a must now days.

If you've seen Titanic, and a couple of his other movie roles, you'll be really shocked, that he can play a totally different role. He's not a pretty-boy as he normally is.
It's never really explained what's the matter with Leo's character, Arnie. He has a lot of different characteristics which relate to different special needs people. I tend to think he's autistic, but he never comes across as especially autistic. So it does get a bit confusing.
There is a really powerful connection between Johnny Depp's character, Gilbert, and Arnie. Gilbert is really protective of his younger brother, and ashamed by everyone else in his family. This relationship comes to a terrific climax later in the movie, which will shock everyone who's enjoyed their relationship up until then.
Juliette Lewis plays the girl Gilbert falls in love with, and who he gives up his older, married lover for. Most people in other reviews I've read don't seem to like her character, but I do. She was great for the part, and although I wasn't keen on her too short hair, I loved everything else about her role.
Darlene Cates plays the abnormally obese mother, who hasn't stepped out of the house in 7 years, until Arnie gets arrested. I'm not sure whether the sheer size of her was for real, or whether it was body padding/suit kinda thing. Her size is almost too realistic to be a body suit.

WHAT'S EATING GILBERT GRAPE, really, is a sensitive look at a family that doesn't like its own members. They don't hate each other, but each member is in its own little orbit that happens to revolve in the same house. The eldest child, Gilbert (one of Depp's best early roles), however is burdened the most. His impulse to establish himself and go after his own needs are one of the hinges of the plot. Fatherless Gilbert and his sister are left to feed themselves and their quarter-ton mother; no easy task. The mentally challenged younger brother Arnie (frighteningly well played by DiCaprio) compounds Gilbert's already growing list of responsibilities. In a strange but not illogical way, he is also responsible, unwillingly, to satisfy the carnal urges of a local housewife.
It seems that everything in Gilbert's world has come to a deadly stop: his mother doesn't leave the couch; he can't leave his dead-end job (the only other potential for employment is the brand new mega-burger diner); he has no love interest; and the passing through of hundreds of hundreds of motor homes on their way to some vacation Mecca is the only source of entertainment in town. Only Arnie seems to be able, in his own way, to communicate the need to get out--he climbs the town's water tower on an almost weekly basis. He knows he has to get out. Only Gilbert can talk him down, as if Arnie wants to share with his brother the desire for escape.
When one of the campers in the convoy breaks down, Gilbert finds his love interest (Juliette Lewis in a quiet but convincing portrayal) dropped on his lap. Her presence in town and its effect on Gilbert set everything on its ear. Gilbert starts asserting himself--to the point of dangerously neglecting Arnie. The seductive housewife inherits her husband's money--the husband, by the way, dies in the strangest way--and leaves Gilbert to the girl. And mother decides she will finally get off the couch and go sleep in her own bed. And then even more things are set off.
There's too much to tell. The point is that WHAT'S EATING GILBERT is one of those films where all the elements blend together seamlessly to create a perfect, mature film. Everything except the title that is.",1079222400,2,2455,4.685185185185185

In this case, this movie failed to remain true to the heartfelt story that Peter Hedges wrote. The author's first novel was outstanding, and I have read it time and time again; couldn't put it down, in fact. But the movie just drops the heart right out of the bottom of this story and turns it into something I feel it was never meant to be.
While there is no doubt in my mind that this movie is an example of the best work that either Johnny Depp or Leonardo DiCaprio have ever done, the directing, screenwriting and production of this movie failed to maintain the true heart of the story; the feelings of Gilbert for his family and his town, and the ultimate sadness of being a thirty-something living in the small town in which he was born.

Directed by Lasse Hallstrom
Cast Featuring: Johnny Depp, Leonardo DiCaprio, Juliette Lewis, Mary Steenburgen, Darlene Cates, Laura Harrington, Mary Kate Schellhardt, Kevin Tighe, John C. Reilly, and Crispin Glover.
DiCaprio was nominated for the Academy Award, Best Supporting Actor, and the Golden Globe Award, Best Supporting Actor.
This magnificent drama unfolds in a small Iowa town that has seen better days.  Gilbert's (Depp)sole purpose in life is to be the backbone of his dysfunctional family.  One that consists of a mentally retarded younger brother, an obese momma, a teenage sister, as well as an older sister.
We are guided through a time in Gilbert's life that rides like a roller coaster.
Endora is a quiet simple town with very little progress.  Gilbert is stuck in a dead end job at the local grocery store.  Arnie, the mentally retarded brother, has a tendency of running off to climb the water tower.  These adventures always bring the police.  Even Gilbert's affair with a lonely married housewife doesn't go without a scandal.  And where would we be without friends?  Gilbert's friends consist of an underworked funeral director, and Tucker, who's big concern is owning a Burger Barn someday.
The Grape's house is falling apart, which of course is Gilbert's responsibility.  The family is in the middle of planning Arnie's 18th birthday party, a birthday they were told he'd never see.  Sounds simple enough..... however, like everything else in Gilbert's life even this produces chaos.
As if all this weren't enough on Gilbert's plate..in walks love.  Good or bad timing?  The connection between Gilbert and Becky (Lewis) helps him through some rough times.  The downfall being, Becky is a traveler and only by the mere fate of her aunt's vehicle breaking down do they meet.  Once fixed Becky is soon on her way out of Endora.
Gilbert quickly learns that what is today isn't always tomorrow.
This movie is definitely 5 star.  The cast is amazing from Depp's downplayed hero to DiCaprio's stunning performance as Arnie.  It has everything you could want love, compassion, friendship, and fate.",1061078400,16,2199,5.117647058823529
574669,4,6303124798,"""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"" is the kind of movie which you don't expect too much before you see it, but after you've seen it, a smile in your face will appear.
The movie tells the story of Gilbert Grape, a nice guy trapped in a small town, with a dysfunctional family (as almost every family is), a job without a future and a relationship with a married woman. And despite all this, he is not a sad man, he is not depressed, he is not worried about himself; his main reason to live is to take care of his family. Everything else comes in a second place, including himself.
Johnny Depp is the center of the movie and his low-key performance is excellent, but the reason why this movie works so fine is the supporting cast; Leonardo DiCaprio is terrific as the mentally retarded brother, he and Depp are the fuel of the story. The rest of the cast includes: Darlene Cates as the big, big, big mother, John C. Reilly as Gilbert's best friend, Juliette Lewis as Gilbert's new love interest and Mary Steenburgen as the married woman who is having an affair with Gilbert, all of them are terrific in their roles.
The main purpose of ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"" is to entertain audiences, and it does...a very enjoyable movie.",1057449600,2,1223,4.513513513513513
574670,5,6303124798,"I don't know what it is about this movie.  I was really blown away by Leonardo DiCaprio's portrayal of Arnie, I think he really steals the show.  The movie itself is set in a small town and is about those stuck in it.  The movie is not action packed, doesn't have a sweeping soundtrack and I don't really think has a hidden deep meaning. It is just a movie portraying the bleakness of small town life and one ""strange"" family's dealings with it.",1053734400,,445,4.337349397590361

You get to experience the same experiences and difficulties of the Grape family by this thoroughly absorbing film. Placed in a small town setting, the film doesn't center around anyone famous or exceptional, but it explores the regular everyday American family with it's troubles and joys.

574672,5,6303124798,"I reserve the five-star treatment to items that are well worth repeated viewing/listening/reading.  This is one such film.
The story of Gilbert Grape is a coming-of-age story like none other.  His father committed suicide when Gilbert was a preteen, and since then he's been the man of the family.  And oh, what a family.  This is as dysfunctional a lot as anyone you know.
But the great thing about the film is that they don't look down on this gang of misfits in any way.  They are handled with dignity and realism, and Gilbert's stuck-in-a-rut life is as understandable as a stop sign.  While the ""and then enters the beautiful girl"" plot line could easily become a too-easy Hollywood cliche, it doesn't come close.
Naturally I could say much about the plot here, but won't spoil it for those who haven't seen this masterpiece.  Leonardo DiCaprio, in his debut as a featured movie performer, steals the show as mentally incapacitated Arnie, blowing away anyone's thought that he's just another pretty face.  Johnny Depp is dead-on as the perpetually frustrated Gilbert, who's finally about to stop holding it together.  And Mary Steenburgen, who's always wonderful, is again, as the small-town wife who's also hiding a dysfunctional family.
It's an emotional ride, this film, so be ready to shed some tears.  No ""chick flick"" by any stretch, this is a film that manages to hit the bull's eye in every frame....and the bull's eye, you'll find, is painted squarely on your heart.",1048982400,18,1480,4.884
574673,4,6303124798,"Its name does little to entice viewership, but ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape?"" is a study in the desperation of a young man coming of age looking to escape his small-town mentality and responsibility for two sisters and a mentally challenged brother, all abandoned years earlier by an apparently equally desperate father. Johnny Depp turns in a credible performance as Big Brother-Caretaker who simmers slightly beneath the surface to escape to a better life somewhere other than this backward southern town. In supporting roles, Mary Steenburgen is in the rare role of older woman who sparks Gilbert's sexual awakening, but the multi-talented Juliette Lewis truly has Gilbert's heart after igniting his feeling of love. Both they and the lead are virtually upstaged, however, by Leonardo diCaprio's Oscar-nominated tour de force as Gilbert's brain-damaged kid brother, and diCaprio is not less than overwhelmingly convincing in his portrayal. A subplot focuses on Gilbert's grossly obese mother, seldom seen in public, and the storyline serves to further explain Gilbert's simmering desire to go for a better life somewhere else. Depp, Lewis and Steenburgen command the viewer's attention. But catch this film if for no other reason than diCaprio's performance. He is absolutely devastating!",1043107200,9,1291,5.492462311557789
574674,4,6303124798,"Set in a small town in Iowa, the characters of a unique family work through life.  I think the small town aspect of this film is crucial to it's overall feeling.  It has a rural disfuction about it.  an air of uncivility.  The irony is, these people are more civilized than most city folk in their purity alone.
Depp gives a great performance, while DiCaprio plays one of his best roles yet.  If you grew up in a small town this film will undoubtedly touch a nerve.

The plot is pretty straight forward; Gilbert Grape, the main character, played by Johnny Depp, goes through a stranded life, having to look after his family: his mother Bonnie (a 500 pounder), his two sisters, Amy and Ellen, and last but not least, Arnie, the star actor of the whole film.

Then their is an imbecile brother. He mentally ill and needs constant attention. He is a burden, but heis Gildbert's brother. He was expected to die at the age of 10, will he live to be 20 and will Gilbert let the love of his life go? Will his mother start taking care of herself or will she die from high cholestral?

574783,5,6303124798,"Set in the fictional town of Endora, Illinois (quite a pregnant name for a city), ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"" focuses on the down but not yet out Grape family: a mother (Darlene Cates) who weighs over 500 pounds, two sisters (Laura Harrington and Mary Kate Schellhardt) with enough bottled up anger to drown a desert town, a mentally retarded brother named Arnie (Leonardo DiCaprio) who's about to turn 18 despite assurances that he'd never live a third that long, and Gilbert (Johnny Depp), the glue that holds them all together.  The burdens of the family, be they running errands in his truck or bathing his brother, all fall on Gilbert's shoulders.  The purpose of this particular story is to find out what happens when that burden is too heavy a weight to bear.
Everyone in the film is constantly expecting a lot from Gilbert.  Whether it's the plea from his momma that he's ""gotta do better"", the complaints from his sisters that he never does anything (when in fact, he does everything), or the selfishness of the married woman (Mary Steenburgen) with whom he's having an unfulfilling affair, Gilbert can't seem to ever be good enough.  Contrast this with the just-happy-to-be-here existence of Arnie, who blithely tells anyone that will listen, ""I can go at anytime.""  It's a wonder that Gilbert ever has the strength to go on.
But go on he does, using just as much effort to keep the family together as he does repressing his own anger.  The film's title is ironic, in that Gilbert shows little anguish; it just appears that something is ""eating"" at him.  It's a rather benign description of his state of mind, but on the surface it works quite well.  For the most part, he vents his anger in passively destructive ways.  One early scene features a couple of kids standing by the side of the road, staring at the Grape house.  When Gilbert sees them, he motions one over.  All the kid wants to do is get a gander at the 500 pound woman inside, and Gilbert resignedly obliges, even going so far as lifting the kid up so he can see through the window.  It's a very mean moment from a young man who is angelic by most accounts.  But when he lets loose of his control, when his primal nature comes out, the anger and violence and wrath and fear is very apparent.
The actors are uniformly good, with a few who should be pointed out for special recognition.
Darlene Cates, who legend has it was discovered after an appearance on ""The Sally Jessy Raphael"" show, plays Momma.  It was important for the story that Momma not be played by an actor in a fat suit; the audience needs to be as repulsed by her as the townspeople are.  But it is equally important that the audience comes to understand her plight, and feel for the woman.  Cates is authentic looking, and, more importantly, authentic acting.  The pathos of Momma is apparent in every defeated sigh.  And when she's called on for anger, as she is in one pivotal scene where she makes the terrifying choice to leave the house, it's painfully real.
Leonardo DiCaprio, in the years since this film came out, has polarized moviegoers in to two camps.  There are those who swoon at the mere mention of his name, ""Titanic""-philes and Tiger Beaters all.  And there are those turn up their noses at the pretty boy actor, who will always be more style than substance.  Neither of these groups will enjoy what Leo does in ""Gilbert Grape"".  They may have to scrub clean all benefits of hindsight, or at the very least time travel back to 1993, to fully enjoy his performance.  And oh what a performance it is.  Common wisdom states that roles with physical or mental challenges, despite being the most often praised, are actually the easiest to play.  Actors develop a series of ticks, and voila!  A character!  Leo, to his credit, is more than just a collection of ticks as Arnie.  Sure, he's got messy hair, dirty fingernails, a nose in constant need of wiping, and a primal scream laugh.  But he so disappears into his character, that any preconceptions you might have about the actor get lost, and a character fully emerges.  It's a seamless and highly endearing performance.
As poignant as Cates is, and as flashy and sublime as DiCaprio is, it is Depp who holds the movie together.  He has to play Gilbert close to the chest for the most part, relying more on his facial expressions rather than on the sparse dialogue to communicate what the character is all about.  It's not an outwardly remarkable performance, but it is supremely effective.  He gets drawn out of his shell, bit by bit, when Becky shows up.  Becky, Juliette Lewis in star-child mode, is a perfect contrast to Gilbert.  She's open and honest and willing to let others in.  Lewis is charming here, a trait she doesn't get to show often enough.  She and Depp have fine chemistry together, as they try to feel their way through young love.
But for most of the movie Depp plays a kind of straight man to DiCaprio's goofball antics.  They have a wonderful chemistry together, for not only do they mine some restrained comedy from these scenes, but they also ably portray a strong brotherly bond.  Gilbert will care for Arnie till the day he dies; Arnie loves and trusts Gilbert, even if he has not the mental capacity to understand why.
Lasse Hallstrom has a wise knack for silences, not just in the performances, where silence is golden, but also in the film's musical score.  For the most part, except for some light piano work in the most important moments, everything is quiet and still.  Which perfectly mimics the solitude of the small town, in which this heartbreaking, but ultimately life-affirming story, takes place.",1028246400,81,5645,4.650201612903226

574787,5,6303124798,"...""Gilbert Grape"" is a brilliant film. It IS a slice of life (as many reviewers write...), so what is the ""something significant"" he expects? The ""significance"" is evident in every scene of the film and perfectly captured in its title. This film has that quirky, dysfunctional-family, slice of life to which we can all relate. Yet, without dragging itself into the popular raunchy side of family problems, ""Grape"" taps into emotions, values and quaint small-town American culture like no other film has ever done. And it is not trite like many films about small-town, mobile-home America. The ""significance"" is a film about ""real life"" without drowning the story in syrupy, Hollywood drama in order to make it SEEM real, as most popular dramas do.
The positive reviews you may have read in Amazon.com have nailed the important aspects. DiCaprio is an over-rated actor in almost everything most people like him in, but his under-rated role in this picture blows away even the convincing performance of Dustin Hoffman in Rainman. If I hadn't known who DiCaprio was, I might not have known this was acting. ... Also, as other reviews point out ..., there are other spectacular performances besides DiCaprio's.
The cast is one of those refreshingly diverse and relatively unknown kind that comes together better than any All-star brat-pak. The music fits and flows very well and adds the icing to cake. The writing literally makes the characters of Johnny Depp and Juliette Lewis, and provides a subtlely brilliant intro and conclusion.
If you're not into drab, mushy dramas, but you like a good story in a quality-made film - this could be the perfect fit for you.",1009411200,3,1662,4.982014388489208

I have added to my collection due to the fact I've become star struck each time I see a Johnny Depp film. Each time he is doing something completely different than the last character wise.

574789,5,6303124798,"Some people will grumble about the excessive absence of anything spectacular in ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape,"" a slice of life comedy/drama that takes us to a place where no one is special, no one is famous, nothing is large-scale, and simple is all the rage. Nothing particularly interesting happens to the characters we meet, nothing explodes and no one gets shot at; life simply goes on.
And that's the beauty of Lasse Hallstrm's gloriously simplistic film: nothing gets in the way, allowing us to get to know the characters in ways that no other movie can provide. As the world of cinema expands, getting bigger and more complex everyday, ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"" feels like a small miracle, a great American film that captures life at its most joyous and its most depressing.
In one of the best performances of his career, Johnny Depp plays Gilbert Grape, a young man who can't seem to see the joy in his life. His career at the local market, a small mom-and-pop store that has seen suffering sales as a result of the new supermarket outside of town, is less than satisfying; he is having an affair with a married woman, who becomes scornful when Gilbert takes an interest in Becky (Juliette Lewis) a young girl traveling across the country with her grandmother in whom he sees a spark of the wonder of life.
It is his family life, however, that becomes bothersome to him. His mother, who weighs 500 pounds and has not left the house in seven years, constantly puts him to work taking care of his brother, Arnie (Leonardo DiCaprio), who suffers from mental retardation. There are times when this family experiences moments of happiness, which is crossed with moments of angst and bickering, all of which builds up to the point that Gilbert cannot stand another minute of his family.
And this is pretty much the plot of the movie; you may never find one more simplistic than this, or one more moving. There is a blunt truthfulness in its approaches to the issues of mental retardation and obesity: the other children of the town pick on Arnie for being different, and his mother's obesity, a result of depression from her husband's passing, is the talk of the town. Yet, these traits are embraced by the audience rather than made into an object of laughter: Arnie possesses a certain childlike charm that quickly catches on, while his mother is a warm-hearted, endearing woman with a gentle, maternal soul.
The film's focus on the characters is in its favor, giving us a chance to get to know their lives and the frustrations they must face each day. For Gilbert, referring to his mother as a ""beached whale"" is an everyday thing, while putting up with Arnie's disappearing and climbing to the top of the town water tower is a regular event. In his face, we see the hidden angst, the wanting in him that cries out to break free and leave what he has known all of his life for something, anything different, though not necessarily better. He finds this in Becky, with whom he shares a warm relationship that opens his eyes and makes him realize that leaving his family behind is not the answer.
These realizations and small glimpses of reality are brought to life under some striking performances, from a cast composed of stars and first-time actors. Depp brings out the subtle expressions and feelings of confusion and wanting in Gilbert with supreme impact; DiCaprio delivers equally powerful acting as Arnie, creating a character that we first want to consider annoying, but in the end, have come to care for. Newcomer Darlene Cates steals the show as Gilbert's mother, filling her with true emotional depth that gives us a reason to feel sorrow for her.
With this talented cast and a story that gains its complexity from its simplicity, ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"" is not a blockbuster or an epic, yet its juxtaposition of sorrow and happiness is endearing and warm, and its focus on people rather than spectacle is astounding. There is a subtle brilliance that bleeds from this film's story, one that is rarely seen in movies of today; any lover of good movies won't find a better film.",1007510400,4,4101,4.745098039215686

Johnny Depp is excellent as usual as Arnie's concerned big brother (the title character)  and Juliette Lewis (with a bad hair-day!) is adequate as Becky, the girl who wants to know what makes him tick.

Gilbert Grape lives in a small town, he has two younger sisters, a retarded brother, played brilliantly by Leonardo Dicaprio, and a morbidly obese mother.  Gilbert is the father figure in this film, and he has little chance to just be himself for awhile.  He always seems to be the one taking care of his brother, ARnie, while his sisters complain about him.  He is just going through life, working at the local grocery store, and fooling around with a married woman, played quite well by Mary Steenbergen.

The first time I watched this movie my attention was captured by Arny as he laughed and squealed joyfully as he ran after a caravan of campers.  This wonderful beginning really captured my attention.  This movie does not fall off and has a great ending--unusual for today's standards.  Also helping capture a place in time is Gilbert, the main character played by old-time heart throb Johnny Depp.  Coincidentally, Arny the retarded brother is played by new heart-throb Leonardo DiCaprio (Titanic).  Perhaps the most moving performance in this movie is played by Darlene Cates.  She plays the part of an incredibly obese woman who is the mother of a poor, dysfunctional family.  One realizes and has to feel for poor Darlene as she both plays out a tragic part in a movie and in her own real life.  This movie classic is universal with international appeal bacause no accents are apparent.  Especially no silly, thick southern ones like in ""To Kill a Mockingbird"".  No state is even mentioned in this movie although it was filmed in Texas.  Endora is just small town, anywhere.  The supporting cast are quite relaxed and gentle in their expert performances.

My friends also saw it, they thought it was a good movie with good actors, i just found it depressingly boring expcially for starring Jonny Depp and Leo...",971049600,3,437,4.214285714285714
574999,5,6303124798,"This film underlines the genius of Hallstrom, in as much that he gets two actors working together, like Phoenix and Reeves in My Own Private Idaho, or the two kids in My Life as a Dog, and you can't imagine anyone else in  their parts. In this movie, DiCaprio as the near dysfunctional Arnie gives  the performance of a lifetime and one day I hope to see him acting this  well again. Depp, as Gilbert, gives a strikingly austere performance of  someone who finds strength from the simple optimism of being alive.  Surrounded by an ensemble of actors who give their all, it turns into,  simply; a great movie.",961372800,4,608,4.532110091743119
575000,5,6303124798,"What's eating Gilbert Grape is one of the most realistic movies I have ever seen. It shows life in a small town in such a way that I actually would like to go there. The acting is brillant, none of the characters can  be defined with only one adjective, they are all so complex that they come  across as simple. That is the beauty of the movie itself, it seems very  simple but is very complex. The casting is excellent...I truly feel that  this is the best Leonardo Dicaprio movie  I have ever seen , his Oscar  nomination was well deserved. The performance he gave as Arnie, Gilbert's  younger mentally handicapped brother, was outstanding, to say the least.  Johnny Depp and Juliet Lewis also gave amazing performances that make this  a memorable movie.",959817600,4,756,4.62406015037594
575001,3,6303124798,"This is the heartfelt story about Gilbert Grape's (Johnny Depp) boring yet challenged life in a small town on the far side.
He has to take care of his retarded brother, played amazingly good by a young pre-fame Leonardo  DiCaprio, of his whale-sized mother, of a grocery store on its way to give  in to the modern hypermarket, of the sexual lusts of a married  woman...
Then, one day, a girl (Juliette Lewis) accidently comes to town.  A girl so much different from Gilbert Grape's daily universe...",954288000,4,499,4.7011494252873565
575002,4,6303124798,Leonardo DiCaprio was absolutely phenominal in the role of Arnie Grape.  Had I not known of him I would have believed he truly was developed mentally delayed.  Our entire family thoroughly enjoyed it (over and over  again).  My only dislike was Mary Steenberger and the character she  played (she was never one of my favorites).,953164800,3,328,4.890909090909091
575003,5,6303124798,"I teach the film, ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape?"" at the high school and college level.  It's the best vehicle I know of to teach symbolism, foreshadowing, tone, irony (all those English Teacher things  that kids usually think of as BORING).  Generally speaking, my students  love this movie as much as I do.  I only teach the film, not the novel. I  was disappointed when I finally found and read the book because, in it,  Momma is very much the pitiful un-funny joke that she fears herself to be.  I do, however, include excerpts from the book to illustrate how differences  in tone can change the impact of the story.  This is the most carefully  crafted film I've ever seen.  Every scene, almost every line, reinforces  the theme and illuminates the main characters' motivations.  In my opinion,  ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape?"" is as nearly perfect as play  writing gets.",951523200,16,874,4.804054054054054
575004,1,6303124798,"Let me say first off that I saw that stupid movie after I read this wonderful book. AND, let me say that I was gravely dissapointed. Since I loved the book so much I thought the movie would be great. Other than  Leonardo DiCaprio's performance, I found the movie just boring. And another  complaint: They turned this movie into a comedy! IT'S NOT A COMEDY. It is a  sad, moving story. I am not the kind of person who is going to crack just  because someone in the movie is ovverweight. If your going to right a story  into a comedy, make sure it has actual amusing content.",950918400,9,573,4.268518518518518

My only problem is a little one--why didn't they develop Johnny & ""Becky""'s relationship more?  Anyway, good job all  round. Depp--well, I needn't say.

He was so convincing -- facial  expressions, body movements, diction, all came together in his Oscar  nominated role.
Johnny Depp is superb as Gilbert as is Juliett Lewis who  plays a kindhearted friend who travels through the dusty one-horse town, an  angel of sorts, who brings hope and love to the distraught family.

575108,5,6303124798,"Ignore the mindless hordes who like to trash actors just because they're popular, or pretty, or whatever.  Johnny Depp is one of the finest actors of his generation and Di Caprio's portrayal of the retarded teen Arnie here  won him a well deserved Oscar nomination and shows that his acting in  ""This Boy's Life"" was not a fluke.

The film is  funny, sad, and poignant. It tells a simple story conveying the title  character's sense of frustration and feeling of being left behind while  everyone else's life moves forward. It's truly a timeless movie that will  reward your patience. It's one of my top 5 films of all time.",942796800,5,571,5.443181818181818

Leo was incredible as Arnie, and no one could have portrayed the character any better. He really made me think about other mentally challenged kids in the world, and how generous, kind, and naive they can be to all the bad stuff there is out there. The story is so touching.  If you like believable, touching,  heartwarming movies, then this one is definitely for you.  I absolutely loved it and would reccomend it to anyone.  I loved Julliette Lewis's character,  I believe that we need more people like Becky in this world. I am  so excited to read the book!  END",891475200,,678,4.419354838709677

Poor Gilbert...what a life he had and tried very hard to be the best person he could be inside his often clamorous and responsibility-filled world. I admired him, tsk'd about some of his choices, and rooted for him the entire movie. Great acting by all!",1523404800,,525,4.526315789473684
