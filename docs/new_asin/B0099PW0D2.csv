5295049,3,B0099PW0D2,"This film lacks a certain polish and luster.  While mildly entertaining and captivating, I never really got caught up in the narrative.  The pacing of the film is a little too slow and never seems to pick up steam when it should.  Usually a suspense film has a point when loose strands of the narrative are drawn together and the hidden elements of the plot revealed.  The film's pace picks up and so do the emotions of the viewer as the dialectic of mystery graduates to revelation and the story becomes complete. This emotional elevation never really happens in the film.  Though the story is believable and the ending logical, mediocre writing and gaps in the plot, which an alert viewer can bridge, slow down the action producing a lethargy in the viewing experience.  The intrigues in the characters' relations is what drives the suspense, but the director uses largely inexperienced actors who never seem to create the necessary tension between themselves, and his choice of an oddly saccharine tone for a tragedy does not lace the ending with a sense of justice.  Instead, he supplies a bittersweet ending that admonishes hope for the lovelorn.  ""Speechless"" seems to me caught between a film noir and a coming-of-age drama.

In an online interview, the director states he did not have official permission from the Chinese authorities to make this film.  Some scenes where filmed ""underground"" and this no doubt contributed to diminishing what could have been a good movie.  However, it is well worth watching.  Another reviewer on this page recommends renting.  Good advice.",1373155200,9,1582,4.969581749049429
5295050,3,B0099PW0D2,"Powerful and interesting but the last stages of the plot - the revelations via flashback- were weak. A little too ambiguous! Still, unsettling and stays in one's memory.",1368662400,2,169,5.071428571428571
5295051,2,B0099PW0D2,Rather boring and a very unlikely plot line. Average acting but attractive cast members and nice photography.  I felt I wasted my time.,1362700800,,135,4.869565217391305
5295052,2,B0099PW0D2,"I made it three quarters of the way through this train wreck then put on ""The Falls"" for some real entertainment. Don't get me wrong, I love foreign flics and usually have no problem with subtitles but there comes a time in a sub-titled film when you know it just isn't worth trying to keep up with the translation. If you must see it, then rent it and keep your money for better investments. To quote another review I read recently...""a total suck-fest!""",1362700800,4,455,4.493975903614458
5295053,4,B0099PW0D2,"A young European man is found naked and mute in the Chinese countryside, then is taken by the police to a hospital, where he befriends an orderly who slowly uncovers the truth of his past.  Interesting story with great emphasis on the characters.",1358121600,6,246,4.72093023255814
5295054,4,B0099PW0D2,"An unidentified  young European man is found on a Chinese countryside riverbank, naked, and seemingly unable (or unwilling) to communicate.  He is taken to a hospital, where no physical reason for his silence is found, and it is decided to send him to a mental asylum.  Jiang, n orderly at the hospital, senses that the patient isn't crazy but just troubled, and takes off with the young man, hoping to get him to open up about his past.  One clue comes when Jiang spots him calling a young Chinese woman on his cell phone, just to hear her voice.  Looking into their relationship, Jiang eventually discovers the devastating event that apparently caused him to withdraw from life.

This 2012 feature is an excellent  suspense-filled story, with capable acting and direction, definitely worth a look.  Has been featured at several international film festivals.  DVD dialogue is in Mandarin with English subtitles, with extras including an interview with director Simon Chung.  Not rated, but would be a solid R for nudity and simulated sexual activity.  Four stars out of five.",1352160000,16,1076,4.98876404494382

8538136,4,B0099PW0D2,"An interesting film. The pace (maybe slow for some Western tastes), is typical of many good Asian films. The growing relationship between Jiang, the young orderly, and Luc, the silent Frenchman he protects and befriends, is fascinating. Jiang can't quite accept his erotic attraction to Luc so their relationship is never consummated, but there is a fierce love there. Jiang opens up to Luc while Luc remains silent--is that the way Jiang wants their relationship to be? The weakness of the film is in its later melodramatic moments. SPEECHLESS would be a richer film if Luc's female nemesis wasn't such a psychopath. Her more extreme actions simply aren't credible in the context of the rest of this film. At its best moments, SPEECHLESS is a fascinating study of how Chinese men deal with homosexual desire. There doesn't seem to be any positive language for that. The three young male leads are all beautiful.",1496793600,,912,4.967320261437909

8538138,4,B0099PW0D2,"Interesting mystery gets solved around a tragic gay romance. Fair picture, good sound, subtitles easy to read and follow. Good acting. Minimal skin with a few butt shots and some non graphic lovemaking.",1429315200,,202,5.151515151515151
8538139,5,B0099PW0D2,"This film is one of those romantic stories that takes you, the audience, on a intricate yet somehow very definitive story about two very different characters in a very complex yet archaic setting.  Yes, this film is in and about a Chinese setting and situation.  I had to watch this one about three times in order to appreciate its message.  This is one film that you would take the one you care about, to see.  I shall be looking forward for more of this type(Chinese)of film.  LOVE, TRUE LOVE KNOWS NO BOUNDRY OR LIMITS!

8538142,4,B0099PW0D2,Main character comes into the story with amnesia and can't speak.  Life goes on.  Until a sympathetic male nurse intervenes to keep authorities from placing him in a state mental institution.  The male nurse seemingly can't stay away from the patient and helps him escape the authorities further.  Their lives eventually become entwined.  Nice story.,1387411200,2,350,5.290909090909091
8538143,4,B0099PW0D2,"This is an independent gay film from Simon Chung, it tells the story of a man found swimming naked in a river by the police. He is either unable or unwilling to speak. So after some controversial `questioning', they decide to take him to the local hospital. There his nurse Jiang, takes more than a professional interest in him. So when it is decided to transfer him to a mental institution he helps him get away.

Then they come across a woman who this man actually knows and the plot starts to develop. We then have the real story of Frenchman Luc, told in flash back. This was one of those films that took a while to get going; the pacing was almost lethargic at one point. The acting is just about credible and with a cast of unknowns and a shoe string budget there were always going to be issues, and they are all too apparent at times especially with some of the sets. I was on the verge of giving up about half way through, but then things did start to happen.

The plot twists at the end are to be expected but they were not entirely foreseeable, which dragged this from being ok to nearly good. I would have given this 3.5 stars, but am rounding up to be generous. It is in Mandarin and a little English which was strange as he is supposed to be French and runs to ninety two minutes which could have been shorter, but all in all not a bad effort. This is one that trades on the plot surprises so not one to keep per se. Also there is next to no bedroom action either - so my advice would be go for a rental option as indeed did I.",1376784000,,1540,4.13
