8613922,5,B009HVFVVQ,"Kavi is by far one of the most talented and graceful dancers that I have seen. Her background in classical dancing makes it easy for her to pick up various forms of dances with ease. I am impressed with her ability to improvise based on the audience!  I have attended her Bollyfusion class in Lifetime Fitness and both my girls learn dance from her. For folks interested in some creative workout, she gives the perfect balance of aerobics and choreography. It is enjoyable and you don't have to look at the clock even once - time flies and you actually enjoy the workout! We highly applaud her efforts and recommend her DVD!",1372377600,,624,4.571428571428571
