4328022,4,B004CQZFH6,"Valdez is Coming is my favorite of the 3 on this DVD. Have had it on 'recorded from TV' VHS for years. Great story, have loved it since it hit the theatres early 70's. Stands the test of time. Ahead of it's time regarding race; great moral tale too. Missouri Breaks 'strange' to say the least but Hey, it's Brando in a dress and Nicholson very young. Breakheart Pass not one of Bronson's best but it Bronson.",1392940800,,408,4.311688311688312
4328023,4,B004CQZFH6,"This is the kind of mostly adult movie trio that is good for a cold wintery day -- when you want to order in, turn up the heat and be glad that you live in this century.  LOTS of bang,bang, shoot-em-up to keep the man in your life happy (IF he likes this kind of thing) and if you go to sleep he will not notice or get angry.",1382054400,2,325,3.710144927536232

4328040,5,B004CQZFH6,Great movies all. The DVD was great quality and played great on my Xbox 1. My favorite was Missouri breaks and I found this DVD while searching for that movie.

4328055,3,B004CQZFH6,"Breakheart pass kept my interest and was fun to watch, good to see Old Bronson in action so I give that one 4 stars.  Valdez and Missouri B are just so-so 2 star movies, total= 3 stars.",1424131200,,185,4.0
4328056,4,B004CQZFH6,"Three movies that are prime examples of 70s western movies. Breakheart Pass is a nice mystery in a great wilderness setting with a competent cast including one of Bronson's best efforts. Valdez is a tour de force for Lancaster and shows his versatility. Missouri Breaks may be the first western to take some real gambles as Nicholson is funny and serious while Brando, wonderfully psychotic, seems to be always hovering in the background. These three give you a wide range of westerns during a dynamic period for the genre.",1424044800,,523,4.887640449438202

4328068,4,B004CQZFH6,"Valdez is Coming/Breakheart Pass were two great movies. Lancaster and Bronson were great in there rolls. Missouri Breaks I didn't watch it through, I found it boring and Brando seemed very dull to me. Of course I'm not a Brando fan.",1411776000,,232,4.682926829268292
8423425,2,B004CQZFH6,Great to have these films but they are DVD-R copies and no legit releases ; they play fine but you get no extras at all.  Still hard to find films but terrible quality regarding these being on DVD-R's.,1528070400,,201,4.2894736842105265
8423426,4,B004CQZFH6,"Valdez is Coming is a really bad movie. There is no real ending and it just cant get off the ground. Lancaster felt like he was phoning this one in. Breakheart pass is better but not by much. Not even Bronson could save this film. The Missouri Breaks however, is a very good film. Hi can a movie starring Marlon Brando(the greatest actor ever) and Jack Nicholson be bad? It is a little weird at times and drags a bit, but this movie is worth watching.",1522108800,,451,4.255813953488372

8423429,5,B004CQZFH6,"I enjoyed all three movies they were made in a time when there was no politics in movies, just entertainment.",1505779200,,109,4.5
8423430,3,B004CQZFH6,"Note that Valdez is ""widescreen"" in the same way some old VHS tapes are widescreen: the picture is there, but it's in the middle of a 4:3 sector.  So on an HDTV you're only using about a third of the screen.  I have a Zoom function on my TV so I can make it fill the screen, but you're losing quality.
Breakheart Pass and Missouri Breaks are real 16:9 transfers.  And Breakheart looks pretty good.  MB is low-quality; there is ghosting, and the resolution looks bad.
So if you want a good copy of Valdez or MB you should look elsewhere.  If you're most interested in BP, you get the other two movies as a package deal.  You save money by only getting one disc, but there are tradeoffs.",1496188800,,685,4.271317829457364

8423433,5,B004CQZFH6,"This is a fantastic compilation to own. Each movie is very unique and entertaining. I highly recommend all three even if you are not a fan of the Western Genre.  Great stories and acting,",1489363200,,187,4.5
8423434,4,B004CQZFH6,The first two were good. The last one was ok.,1487030400,,45,3.6
