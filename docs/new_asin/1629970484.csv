201836,3,1629970484,"Great Courses are generally wonderful! Some of these Heroes lectures are really good, but some fall flat. Where this series excells is tracing hero cycle through literature.",1428710400,,173,5.444444444444445
201837,5,1629970484,"I really like how he address both ancient (Odysseus) and modern (James Bond) heroes. He even includes women, both old and new, which is great.

The context he provides to author's writings is really helpful in understanding perceptions of heroes and the changing heroic expectations of the public.",1420675200,,297,5.1875
201838,5,1629970484,"We thoroughly enjoyed this series. It helped me look at some of my favorite fictional characters in a new light. When we finished the last lecture, we were ready to watch the entire series from the beginning and blow the dust off all these great stories again. The course provides a fascinating perspective -- never a dull moment. A resounding thank you for producing this series!",1418860800,,380,4.7727272727272725
201839,4,1629970484,"Good Course, interesting lectures, well-presented, excellent choice of subjects. But what happned to episode 12? Presumably that's the Lizzie Bennett lecture, which I was looking forward to. Why was this one episode left out of the set? Otherwise this is an excellent 5-Star entry in the Great Courses series.",1416182400,,309,5.326530612244898

201843,2,1629970484,"I ordered the one about Odysseus for my students. It's mainly a summary of The Odyssey in lecture format. The content was accurate, but the kids found it repetitive (since we had just read the epic) and they found the style boring. It's an alternative to sparknotes if you need an overview of Odysseus, but there's little new info if you already read the story.",1445644800,,361,4.569230769230769
201844,5,1629970484,"A great course that served as a complement to Joseph Campbell's Hero series. I enjoyed the expert analysis of heroic characters in western literature by Prof. Shippey. The range of characters and the time span, ranging from Ancient Greek literature to recent ones like Harry Potter, covered in this lecture series is just great.",1445472000,,328,5.092592592592593
201845,4,1629970484,"I love the idea behind the Great Courses series and I've seen a few. The problem with them seems to be that the director decided that there was one way, and one way only, for these professors to ""perform"".  While the information imparted is fascinating, there is a sort of puppet-like quality to the staging of the lecturers. Someone told them all to ""stand, turn, step, keep your arms bent at the elbows."" Having seen a few of these, I find the style a bit distracting at this point. I get it. They're tring to make the lectures interesting. I with they'd go with a style more along the lines of the TED talks. Let them tell us about these things that excite them and ignite their passions. Don't dress them up and put them on a set and tell them how to ""act"" out a lecture.",1442620800,,775,4.272108843537415

201848,5,1629970484,"This is the kind of prof you dream about having in university.  He's of course very knowledgable, but he brings the subject to life with great references, great story telling and brilliant humor.  I've listened to 4 lectures in this series so far and will listen to all of them (even for the characters/works with which I'm unfamiliar).",1437004800,2,336,4.775862068965517
