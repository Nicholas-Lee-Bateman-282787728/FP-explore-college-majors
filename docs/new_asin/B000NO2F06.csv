2773842,5,B000NO2F06,"We have this and the second in the series, and we enjoy them so much.  Our daughter, age 2 1/2, is already captivated and often calls out for more ""Naaman"".  What I really appreciate is that this DVD offers her a Bible story that is less well known than Noah or Moses, yet it is an abosulte treasure.  Not only is she growing in an accurate portrayal of God's Word, but she is having fun and learning a great lesson as well.

In addition to all of that, I would recommend this DVD because I enjoy it.  There are humorous character voices and an entertaining script.  Lots of fun for all.  You will quickly wind up quoting it over and over as we do!

We look forwartd to future installments of the Amazing Bible Puppet Theater!",1175212800,,726,4.286764705882353
2773843,5,B000NO2F06,Amazing Bible Puppet theater is hilarious and accurate! My husband and I sat down to watch it with our 4 and 6 year old children and thoroughly enjoyed it.  We are looking forward to more in the series.  This DVD could be a great help in sunday school classes or in your homeschool Bible time.  My children don't remember as much from a story when there are no pictures or visuals.  A great starting point would be to watch this video and then go to the Bible and read the text. Follow it up with a craft and I am sure the children will come away with a better understanding of what the stories were about and wanting to know more!,1174608000,2,631,4.190082644628099
2773844,5,B000NO2F06,"A copy of this bible puppet show was floating around at our church office where our college and career bible study meets. I asked the pastor about it and he said it was definately worth watching. So one friday night after our bible study, we popped it in on the projecter to check it out. Now these are a bunch of 18-30 year olds and it had all of us laughing. But the coolest thing about this show was that we were all learning the word of God while we were being entertained. This movie is a great for ministering to your kids, even your teenagers. If you like veggie tales, or even just like being edified in the word of God, this movie has your bases covered. I strongly reccomend it!",1173139200,2,688,4.21969696969697
2773845,5,B000NO2F06,"As a parent and Sunday school teacher I thoroughly enjoyed watching this unique and one of a kind, two part DVD with my kids.  Overall, I'd say it's well crafted, humorous, entertaining, memorable, and tells a great story.  The producer is obviously talented and presents the Gospel in an awesome way to children of all ages.  As an adult I found it inspiring as well.  To summarize, this is an excellent value, and I can't wait for the next release.

Like my daughter said, ""For people who don't know Christ it would be very encouraging"".",1172534400,2,539,4.631578947368421
8179962,3,B000NO2F06,"I wasn't a huge fan of this. I felt like it was too over the top (a lot of yelling and exaggeration). I know this is done to get the child's attention, but when it is done throughout the whole thing it has the reverse affect and then getting the child's attention becomes more and more difficult. I generally don't like my kids to watch shows that model that kind of behavior. Sorry :/",1450656000,,385,4.216216216216216
8179963,1,B000NO2F06,Our daughters love puppets so we gave it a chance and let it run about 10 minutes but it was so bad we had to turn it off.  The accents the puppets had and the added goofiness were distracting and made it impossible for our kids to understand them. This could've been really good.,1426118400,,280,4.185185185185185
8179964,2,B000NO2F06,"I applaud the efforts of those who made this video.  They took an obscure Bible story and presented it with some nice puppetry skills.  The also had some nice puppet sets and used some video tricks to make the story of Naaman's leprosy interesting to watch.  I think this could be very useful to a Sunday school teacher who was presenting this particular story to a class, but I found it too limited in scope to be of any use to me.  I was hoping that I could use this as a source for ideas for my own puppet ministry, but I just didn't find that much I could glean from it.  Even as a video to show to children, it's just not worth the bother  -- unless you just happen to be looking for teaching material about Naaman.",1368662400,,720,4.143884892086331
8179965,3,B000NO2F06,"You be the judge. It's biblical, but I have I give it 3 stars, but who cares it's about Christ and that's what matters.",1368489600,,119,4.0
8179966,2,B000NO2F06,"The quality of the sound & audio was distracting to my kids & the quickly lost interest. Also, the characters voice was frightful at times....my kids are 3 & 5",1361232000,,159,4.333333333333333
8179967,3,B000NO2F06,"It held my toddlers' attention. It did a good job of presenting the bible stories, and they aren't the ones usually covered so I like that. Unfortunately, the first two stories are the exact same! I was so bummed! About Naaman being healed of leprosy. The third one was new, from about the same time period. Definitely worth the price!",1358640000,,335,4.6
8179968,3,B000NO2F06,"I thought that maybe this show would be a little more in depth for older kids, but it was mainly for kids ages 3-5. It was a good show, just not what I expected.",1332806400,,161,3.764705882352941
8179969,5,B000NO2F06,"Amazing Bible Puppet theatre has clean humor references that perhaps older adults or children would only understand but it is sticking to the scripture. The emphasis on what is most important is brought out with creativity, wit and clarity. I would financially support the further production more series that stick to what the Bible actually said.
My husband and I watched together with my four and half year old son. We laughed, we listened, we applauded the scenes of elation and victory in the Bible accounts. This video series of two accounts from the first and second books of Kings are appropriate for any age group.",1322611200,,622,4.877358490566038
8179970,5,B000NO2F06,"I was so elated to finally get this DVD and view it. I am so proud that my daughter, as she gets older, will have wonderful Christian entertaining videos to watch such as this. I am trying to build a good collection now so when that time comes she'll be able to enjoy it and not be tempted to watch the stuff on TV nowadays. But this one was perfect for the collection and I hope they produce more of the series. I love it and recommend it to everyone of any age......get it and enjoy!",1201737600,,485,4.0625
8179971,5,B000NO2F06,My family and I really enjoyed this series.  Its a fun way to teach the kids bible stories.  It is great to be able to have these movies so my daughter can watch bible stories when she gets her tv time. Can't wait for more to come.,1175299200,,231,3.893617021276596
