8355501,5,B002826QA6,"I had seen the ""Gunsmith of Williamsburg"" many years ago and was quite impressed with the historical accuracy of that film.  I found ""The Music of Williamsburg"" to be of the same high quality.  The viewer gets a tour through an 18th century village to see the important part that music played in the everyday lives of our forefathers.  The extra feature ""The Musical Instrument Maker of Williamsburg"" recreates the shop of an 18th century craftsman as he and his helpers fashion a harpsichord and a violin.  These are priceless looks into history.",1416614400,,547,4.849462365591398
8355502,5,B002826QA6,"I am an avid History buff so therefore these films by Colonial Williamsburg (all) I have enjoyed over the years.  For me, the older dated films are the best.  Content, character as well as the research behind the making of the films. If one really wants to learn about American History these films and the Foundation in Williamsburg, Virginia  are second to none.
TOP DRAWER!",1350518400,,375,4.7384615384615385
