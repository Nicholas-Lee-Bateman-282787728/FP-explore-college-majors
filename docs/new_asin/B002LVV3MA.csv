3949386,3,B002LVV3MA,"My children greatly enjoyed Episode Three in the ongoing saga of Ice Age and indeed it is probably the best so far, being funny and clever and very tight. There is plenty of visual humor, verbal humor, and situational humor and very little is over-played (though the birthing scene comes close to being working the joke too much). So the movie itself is a great addition to the family's DVD or BluRay collection.  But this particular DVD double-pack is a shameless confidence trick.  The ScratPack disc is utterly without merit. There are no new animated sequences and most of it is tedious in the extreme. It looks as if it took someone eight minutes to compile, though that might be exaggerating the effort and thought that went into it.  There is absolutely no reason for anyone to buy this double-pack; just go for the movie alone.",1256860800,57,835,4.705479452054795
3949387,1,B002LVV3MA,"For 50 cents less, the Blu-ray version of Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs contains a high-def version PLUS a DVD version and all of the extras included on the Scrat Pack disc.  Someone tell me what I'm missing.  Why would you ever spend more for this version?",1256774400,31,258,4.354166666666667
3949388,1,B002LVV3MA,"Understand where I am coming from.  In the past we'd get a DVD for about $15 when the dvd was released.  In that DVD (even past Ice Age dvds) we'd get special features.  Not anymore.  Now you get a DVD with only the movie on it for $15 (remind anyone of VHS?), but if you want the Special Features you got to spend $8 more for that.  To top it off, it's not like they don't have room for the special features on the Movie DVD.  They give us another container...twice as much storage is required of the buyers.  The Marketing Wizs at Dream Works then package this as the Ice Age Dawn of the Dinosaurs Scrat Pack and tell you that you get extra.  YOU DON'T GET EXTRA.  YOU GET NOTHING SPECIAL.  INSTEAD YOU GET ROBBED.  While I'd like the features on the Scrat Pack, I am not spending $8 more to get my special features.  I'm boycotting  and others should boycott this also.  I bet if you look on the Scrat Pack there is about 30 minutes of material.  What a rip off.",1256688000,48,965,4.140540540540541
3949389,5,B002LVV3MA,In this day of questionable movies to watch with your family it is nice to sit down and enjoy this funny film without concern as to what everyone will see next.  Genuinely funny and entertaining movie.,1283904000,,201,4.583333333333333
3949390,4,B002LVV3MA,Good movies at a great price. The Scrat Pack could have been longer though. It was still a good deal.,1282435200,,101,4.1
3949391,5,B002LVV3MA,I bought this for our grandson and he likes to watch it. He won't watch a movie from start to finish if he doesnt like it.,1275264000,,122,3.730769230769231
3949392,5,B002LVV3MA,"After watching the first Ice Age with my daughters and loving it,  I thought Ice age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs was just as good.  My daughters loved it.",1266278400,,149,4.285714285714286
3949393,5,B002LVV3MA,"Ice Age has to be one of the few cartoon franchises that pulls sequels off so well.  Each one is better than the last!  Ellie is pregnant in this one, causing the friends to step away from the growing family in an attempt to give them space.  Sid soon finds three eggs that he decides our his new children, bringing more laughs and baby dinos.  As they wreak havoc amoungst their baby peers, their real mom comes to get them back, taking Sid with them.  Now his friends have to go to a whole new world, undiscovered under layers of ice, to bring him back.  The mammoths quickly realize they aren't the biggest ones in the world anymore, and they all meet a koooky, crazy weasel who aids them on their way.  We cracked up watching this and I'm glad I bought it as it is one my kids will rewatch many times in the future!  Ellie's baby is also so adorable and I look forward to more in the series.",1266105600,,895,4.192982456140351
3949394,5,B002LVV3MA,"I bought this movie just for my kids, but all family enjoy it! Great movie!",1265328000,,75,4.066666666666666
3949395,4,B002LVV3MA,"My four year old girl asked for the whole set of ice age movies including Scrat! Her and I go to the movies often. I bought Ice Age blue rays for all three Ice age movies, but could not find Scrat in blue ray. Scrat mimics the old roadrunner cartoons I grew up with. Since I bought the Dinosaurs Ice Age movie in blue ray I will just give this  Dinosaurs Ice Age movie away without opening it up.",1264896000,,396,4.012658227848101
3949396,4,B002LVV3MA,"Iceage Three: Dawn of the Dinosaurs was well worth the wait.  We thoroughly enjoyed the movie. It was Iceage and Land Before Time merged together.  As usual Sid gets into trouble and the rest of the ""herd"" rescuses him.  Their rescue mission has the common traits of a heros mission threats and all.  This movie held up to what it promised through the previous two.

The Scrat Pack, however, was a bit of a dissapointment.  We loved Scrat and all the shorts that went with him in the movies, and were expecting more from this DVD.  What we got was a DVD of all the old scrat adventures, nothing new to view. Had I known this, I would have just purchased the Dawn of the Dinosaurs by itself.  What's good about this DVD is that if you just need a scrat fix you don't have to pick through an Iceage movie, and you can enjoy one or all of the different Scrat adventures.",1264896000,2,867,4.276073619631902
3949397,5,B002LVV3MA,"I thought maybe they were doing Ice Age too much like some other movies that have about twenty episodes, but I was pleasantly surprised that I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. The character plot was well developed and the introduction of new characters blended very well. I Loved how Scrat had more of a spot in the limelight and what happens that comes between him and his beloved acorn . . .  ahhh, If you haven't seen it better get it you won't be disappointed.",1264809600,,462,4.5
3949398,3,B002LVV3MA,"The third movie was good.  I saw it in the movie theater in 3D and that was really neat. (Too bad the DVD couldn't be 3D). It was a real waste of money to get the Double DVD pack because the extra DVD that came with it only had about 3-5 minutes of new stuff on it and the rest you can find on the previous DVDs (the first two movies) as Special Features.  I was very very disappointed.  It was old stuff with one or two new ones and then the history of how Scrat came to be. Interesting if you are into the cartoon and movie creating business, but most people don't want to watch 10-20 minutes of that stuff.",1264204800,3,609,3.9754098360655736
3949399,5,B002LVV3MA,I saw this movie with my Grandson in the theater in 3-D and we both laughed ourselves silly.  I knew I would be buying this DVD for both my grandchildren as soon as it came out.  The added bonus is The Scrat Pack which both kids love.,1262995200,,234,3.9574468085106385
3949400,5,B002LVV3MA,Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs is another clossel winner in the series. This is one that all ages wouldn't want to miss,1262908800,,119,4.217391304347826
3949401,4,B002LVV3MA,Ice Age Dawn of the Dinosaurs was just want my 4 yo son wanted for Christmas and he loves Scrat so the double pack was great. Unfortunately the Scat Pack movie did not live up to my expections.  I didn't really find the films that funny nor where there enough films.  I thought there would be more than 3.,1262822400,,305,4.1525423728813555

3949407,4,B002LVV3MA,While playing the games it locked up my computor. Finally had to shut the computor off to get out of the game. Would have been cheaper just to buy the movie which I enjoyed. Just as funny as the other two.,1259539200,,205,4.024390243902439

Thanks amazon that we can enjoy as family this movie.",1258588800,,238,3.78
3949413,4,B002LVV3MA,"This is a great movie for children and adults alike.  I actually bought it because I have a boxer puppy and he loves to watch anything with animals. I laugh more from his antics then from the movie, but the movie is fun, entertaining and a great family movie.",1258243200,,259,4.285714285714286
3949414,1,B002LVV3MA,"This rating does not reflect my opinion of the 'film part' of this Pack but the Pack itself, of which the second DVD is called ""The Scrat Pack"" for no other reason than that it contains a couple of old short Scrat films and that's about it. A very cheap marketing trick to make you pay 50% more. Buy the film!",1257984000,5,309,4.081967213114754
3949415,5,B002LVV3MA,"This is equally as good as the other Ice Age movies.  This is a movie you can enjoy with your children or grand children and really laugh together.

3949417,5,B002LVV3MA,"The makers of Ice Age have done it once again! Ice Age 3 seems like the perfect capstone for the Ice Age trilogy. It might not be quite as hilarious as the first two movies, but it is pretty funny. Sid is as clueless as ever. Manny becomes a stressed out parent. Buck is a decent addition (best line:  ""He who has gas, travels at the back of the pack."").

More importantly, Ice Age 3 is a good all-round movie. The blu-ray version has great graphics and amazingly rich sound - easily the best of them. The movie has some exciting action scenes, including a ride on the back of a pteranodon reminiscent of Star Wars.

Granted the idea of a lost world filled with dinosaurs below the Ice Age snows doesn't make a whole lot of natural history sense. Then again, we're talking about mammoths who make fart jokes. That being said, the dinosaurs are well done (better in my opinion that Land of the Lost).

If you liked the first two Ice Age movies, don't miss out on this one!",1257292800,3,971,4.318681318681318

I think we love them for different reasons, as the adult humor relating to things from the past is great for me....and the child humor and color and movement is great for him.  I cannot say enough about all the Ice Age movies!",1404777600,,388,4.16
8373310,5,B002LVV3MA,"When I heard that a 3rd Ice Age movie was in the works, at 2OTH Century-F0X and Blue Sky, I told my entire family and we were excited as ever to see our favourite characters on the big screen again, Roger Ebert was right, this film is hilarious! As a teenager, I still enjoy the Ice Age franchise, and I think this film was just awesome! We get to see a world that we'd probably never see again, and we get a new character thrown into the mix to, a weasel named Buck (played by Simon Pegg, of Shaun of the Dead and Spaced fame), who is very much like a prehistoric Crocodile Dundee. Also, Scrat, the acorn obsessed saber-tooth squirrel gets a girlfriend! Ooh! Anyway, buy Ice Age 3: Dawn of the Dinosaurs on Blu-ray and/or DVD!!!! You'll love it!

About the DVD:
I'd suggest getting the Scrat Pack, despite that it has more features than the ""other DVD"". The original single-disc DVD of Ice Age 3 contains just the audio commentary and that's it!",1350172800,,946,4.375
8373311,5,B002LVV3MA,The computer animators who are responsible for the Ice Age movies are fantastic--they go to great pains and expense to get everything perfect.
