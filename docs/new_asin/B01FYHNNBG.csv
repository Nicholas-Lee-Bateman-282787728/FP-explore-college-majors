8761821,5,B01FYHNNBG,"This disc, recorded at the Royal Concertgebouw in Amsterdam in 2015, offers strikingly clear HD imaging and very good sound presented in both DTS and Dolby Digital 5.0 surround and PCM stereo. Collectors should know that there will not be a Blu-ray version as Euroarts have found that sales of Blu-rays do not justify the extra cost of production.

Regardless of the above, this is a strikingly successful disc and displays both sensitive and highly virtuosic pianism throughout. This is a potent mix and one not to be missed.

The rarely heard complete Tchaikovsky Seasons is a group of twelve, largely gentle, audio images of the seasons from January to December. Each offers a short seasonal portrait, none of which attempts to be a display vehicle for the pianist. The twelve individual titles  At the Fireside; Carnival; Song of the Lark; Snowdrop; Starlit Nights; Barcarolle; Song of the Reaper; Harvest; The hunt; Autumn Song; Troika and Christmas  are a clear indication of the more introspective nature of the pieces and this is fully investigated and delivered by Matsuev.

The following Kreisleriana by Schumann is a different story offering far more opportunities for the pianist to flex his virtuosic muscles. This is a thrilling survey of the work and Matsuev is fully up to all the varying emotional demands of the emotionally demanding work. The finale builds to a conclusion that can only be described as phenomenal pianism.

The Stravinsky Petrushka is an obvious challenge to virtuosity and Matsuev is fully up to the challenge delivering a performance easily capable of challenging the famous earlier version by Pollini. This must now be one of the best versions currently available on any format by any pianist.

The Lyadov Musical Snuffbox is a complete contrast requiring pianism of extreme gentleness and with a touch of humour as the snuffbox gradually winds down. This piece explores exclusively the upper reaches of the piano and is greeted with an amused murmur of appreciation by the otherwise rapt audience.

The remaining Tchaikovsky Meditation and Scriabin Etude are both delivered at the same exalted level and the Jazz-Improvisation by the pianist is of a virtuosic level that defies both description and comparison.

This is simply a remarkable recital and deserves the highest possible recommendation on all counts.",1471219200,,2351,5.16578947368421
