8602802,3,B004SZVN5O,"I found the story line interesting as I see an extreme contrast to what was familiar to me in my Catholic upbringing.  The star is Will Denton, who gives a fine performance as a teenage boy (with raging hormones) amidst other teens sent to camp under the spiritual counsel of a nut job priest (played by Bruce Davison).  The Reverand becomes a catalyst for Satan's terror in the minds of the youth under his study.  The acting is good, but if you're looking for a scary thrill, you can skip this movie.  If you find religious fanaticism amusing, this is definitely for you.  Appearances by Dana Delaney, Jesse Eisenberg, & Andrew McCarthy.",1342656000,2,639,4.669642857142857
