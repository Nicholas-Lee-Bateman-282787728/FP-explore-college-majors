6255989,2,B00IB3QYDA,Its ok but there is too much going on to focus on what's really happening. It needed a little less storylines at a time.,1404000000,,120,4.041666666666667
6255990,3,B00IB3QYDA,Not what I expected. Its better if you watch it in whole instead of one episode at a time. Wish the ending was better. Would have appreciated some closure.,1403740800,,155,4.379310344827586
6255991,5,B00IB3QYDA,"Great movie. Thought it would be a little different, but still loved it. Hope a second movie comes out too.",1402876800,,107,4.4

6255993,3,B00IB3QYDA,"There's nothing about the show that's a surprise. However, I did enjoy the characters, even though they were predictable, and it's a good watch for someone that's just looking for a little vampire fluff (without all the glitter).",1402185600,4,229,5.052631578947368
6255994,2,B00IB3QYDA,the writing sucked. the acting bites. whole thing is an entirely predictable cliche of every vampire myth to date. The only saving grace is that one of the actors runs around without his shirt on which makes the scenery all the better for viewing. SOOOOOO GLAD I did not pay for this movie!,1401235200,13,290,4.490566037735849
6255995,5,B00IB3QYDA,"Alright, so I am loving the spin on this show!! Intriguing, dark and mysterious. Awesome!!!! Can't wait to see the next episode!!!",1400457600,2,130,4.954545454545454

6255998,4,B00IB3QYDA,"OK so it's not cutting edge tv but it does prove Mtv could do something better then scripted real world video.
It also proves that people would watch given something more even if it is a basic copy of what they already see.
It was also nice to see the story ""mildly"" relatable to the college experience.",1497312000,,303,4.333333333333333
6255999,2,B00IB3QYDA,There was no real story line at the beginning. they just rushed right into the whole vampire thing. Poor acting/over-acting. Waste of time.,1495065600,,139,5.086956521739131
6256000,2,B00IB3QYDA,"Not good in any way.  I can't think of one thing in the series that would rate 3 stars not acting, plot, dialogue, set design, nothing. .  I was going to rate it 1 star but gave it 2 stars because I feel sorry for the people with this on their resumes.  I watched all but the last 6 minutes.  I think that pretty much says it all.",1490486400,,330,3.8088235294117645

6256003,5,B00IB3QYDA,Valemont was great!  It's a shame there wasn't ever a second season!  I really thought it was done very well!  Then again I liked MTV when they actually had music videos on too!  Old school!,1484524800,,190,4.3428571428571425

6256019,4,B00IB3QYDA,I enjoyed it. I only saw the first five episodes. I wish more were available.,1475539200,,77,4.2
6256020,1,B00IB3QYDA,"This show was sooo stupid. The acting, the storyline,  made no sense what so ever. I mean ugggggghh, it's lucky it got one star. It doesn't even deserve that.",1474848000,,158,4.448275862068965
6256021,1,B00IB3QYDA,"So bad it is funny to watch -- briefly. While the concept is somewhat unique, the bad acting and writing overpower any creative aspect to be unwatchable.",1474329600,,153,4.703703703703703
6256022,4,B00IB3QYDA,"I really enjoyed the series. It did jump around a little but, I believe it was originally several shorts. The actors were great and I really wanted to explore the story more.",1474156800,,174,4.46875
6256023,4,B00IB3QYDA,I am a horror fan. I liked the series and hope there is another season.,1473724800,,71,3.8
6256024,1,B00IB3QYDA,I can't believe that I actually watched three episodes. The cell phone in between the scenes was very annoying!,1472774400,,111,4.894736842105263

6256027,4,B00IB3QYDA,I would rate this 5 stars except for the last episode. Seemed that they must have rushed to end it. Definitely good to watch.,1468540800,,125,4.25

6256032,1,B00IB3QYDA,If you've read the Vampire Academy Series you'll be familiar with the plot. MTV didn't pull this out of the air. Watch if you feel the urge.,1464307200,,140,4.222222222222222

6256035,1,B00IB3QYDA,The only reason that I'm giving this show any stars at all is because in order to give it a poor review I have to give it at least one star. This show was pretty bad!,1463356800,,166,3.638888888888889
6256036,3,B00IB3QYDA,"A little on the low budget side,but the story line, i think, makes up for that. Very interested and different from the traditional vampire legends and that made it good and made me wish for a season two. Worth the time and effort if your looking doe something light.",1462579200,,266,4.448979591836735
6256037,3,B00IB3QYDA,Too short story line kept jumping ahead it should be longer development the characters more!,1461024000,,92,5.2

6256049,5,B00IB3QYDA,This series wasn't your typical vampire tale.  It was quite good and I look forward to the second season coming out.,1456617600,,116,4.523809523809524
6256050,1,B00IB3QYDA,Only watched for 15 minutes and that is 15 min I can never get back again.  The show obviously was trying to be edgy but failed miserably.,1456531200,,138,4.111111111111111

6256057,2,B00IB3QYDA,"To understand Valemont you should know that it was created as a series of 60-90 second episodes aired on MTV in the commercial break periods of other shows. Effectively, it is an early  ""webisode"" type show and what you can view here are compilations of those scenes into more conventional longform episodes. However, the incredible choppiness of constructing a story a minute and a half at a time has left an indelible mark weakening the show overall. Aside from the choppy pacing, the writing is nothing notable, nor is any of the acting. The tropes and concepts in the show - think of Hogwarts for Vampires and Potential Vampires Who Don't Know It - do not really feel fresh or well-executed. Is it horror? Urban Fantasy? Romance? It doesn't know itself. I did watch the whole series out of vague curiosity to see if they would actually go anywhere interesting and they really didn't. There were a few moments that were good but overall it's just the sort of thing you play in the background while reading a book.",1454630400,13,1016,4.675977653631285

6256060,3,B00IB3QYDA,"Ok, so I am mixed on this show. The acting is less than stellar. The fact that I love everything Vampire is what brings in the 3 stars. It is cheesy in some ways, but the underlying story line is good. Let's see if it gets any better....
In comparing this show to MTV's Teen Wolf, TW completely puts this one to shame from an acting standpoint!",1453939200,,344,4.149253731343284

6256064,4,B00IB3QYDA,"I like this show a lot. I don't understand where all of the hate came from. No it's not perfect. The effects, and some of the acting could be better, but if you overlook all the lack of glitz and glamour and just focus on the underlying show, then it was a decent show. The plotline is great and very entertaining. Unlike a lot of other vampire shows and movies, I actually liked most of the characters. With proper writers, and more production money the second season could have been fantastic. There was a lot of possibility and room for improvement. Sadly a second season was not to be.",1453507200,2,589,4.412844036697248

6256073,4,B00IB3QYDA,"This show had promise in that it had an interesting twist to vampire stories going to a university (Valemont).  This mini-series is like a roller coaster ride:  too fast, too short and leaves viewers wanting for more.",1450656000,,217,4.837837837837838

6256079,4,B00IB3QYDA,Interesting...had no idea that this was about what it turned out to be but enjoyed it.  The only thing I didn't like was that it is only 1 season and then leaves you hanging as far as the ending.,1446768000,,195,4.0

6256111,2,B00IB3QYDA,"Wow, this might have been good, but it wasn't. The concept was great, a university where vampires ""change"" and learn how to behave. The problem was that every character was a cardboard cutout cliche. The angry sister, the ""dead"" brother, the search for the truth, the ""I'm not afraid!"" idiocy of the main character. (Why is it that people who write stuff like this think it's a GOOD thing to be fearless?) The acting, when there was acting, was often overblown. (I expected Eric to twirl a mustache at one point.) And the sister? There was only one emotion she did well- anger. Anything else was just not believable.

Then there are the scripts. I feel for the writer(s). They had five episodes to try and get their characters set, their storyline moving and the audience interested. Obviously, they were rushed, and the result was more like a graphic novel, a bad graphic novel, than a television series. The phone video prop moved the story along, but it was contrived and clunky.

It's too bad, the idea is great. MTV should have put more money into this series, cast other people in many of the roles and allowed the writers 12-13 episodes. They might have had something .",1428278400,5,1176,4.649038461538462

6256126,1,B00IB3QYDA,"This show had potential but the script writing is ""So Bad"" ! So for the first 3 episodes there are writing flaws but still entertaining to keep my interest. The major flaws are as follows;

1. The story is rushed!! Meaning major character development never takes place to really capture your interest; so, the characters become superficial.
2. Each episode is about 18 -20 mins long. it's like watching a trailer to a movie.
3. Vampires in this show are as mortal and uninteresting as humans. They just age slower. Lame!!! What these writers don't seem to understand is that the most alluring thing about vampires is not that they drink blood to survive (that's just a limitation) BUT their immortality which these vamps don't have.
4. Cell phone / iPod mp3 player interludes are silly and they get annoying. I feel like I'm watching a video game when they cut to those scenes but without a XBox / PSP controller. LOL! - it's just stupid!!!

I get to episode 5: Main character drinks blood from her necklace pendant and she goes on some LSD trip that for some reason are events that are actually happening in the show (which is NOT consistent with the other vamp LSD type trips she goes on).

The writing is so bad that its just stupid, the acting gets worse because these actors have no background in which to pull from and by episode 5, it makes no sense at all.

For those GEN X: remember when MTV was really good 24/7 ""Music""? I feel sorry for Millennials and Gen Y. This channel is technically ""R""TV (for Reality crap)",1412121600,2,1523,4.527272727272727
6256127,4,B00IB3QYDA,"The series is good, interesting because of the different spin the writers have put on it. It's like ""Harry Potter"" but Vampires. Need longer episodes, how about 12 episodes per series?",1412121600,,184,4.967741935483871
