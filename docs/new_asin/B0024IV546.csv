There is no other view of Revelation that makes more sense.  Thank you Dr. Gentry!  You have played an important part in restoring the credibility of the scriptures regarding the time of the end (of the age).  Many blessings!",1469664000,,356,4.770491803278689

8350636,2,B0024IV546,"Gentry's argument seems rooted in a flawed premise: if the events portrayed in the Apocalypse did not occur after the book was written, the book is a forgery and a fraud. Such a premise ignores a retrospective and interpretive role for prophecy and precludes the possibility that some of the events revealed to John of Patmos have already occurred at the time of writing while others are yet to come. Because of his flawed premise, Gentry mangles the evidence regarding the date and authorship of Revelation in order to insist (unconvincingly) that the work must have been composed before the destruction of the Temple in 70 AD. There is a tragedy here: Gentry is almost certainly correct that Revelation should be interpreted in light of the destruction of the Temple, but many readers may dismiss that possibility when they see the ham-fisted manner in which he advances his argument regarding the date of composition. I hope that Gentry's audience will follow the advice of Paul and test everything, holding on to what is good.",1427587200,,1030,4.925287356321839

8350638,2,B0024IV546,"I must admit I did not compelet the movie. The first 9 min only talks about how hard the book of Revelation is to understand. If this is a book of instruction to Gods people- why would God hide it from us? Did God give the book the wrong name? I don't believe He did. The bible is wrtten for 2 Tim 3:16  All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness

 There are deeper,clear teaching, for free. Even then you must 2Tim 2:15.
