8202955,3,B000RXZIN4,"I don't actually own this particular set, Karloff's 15 Frightful Films, but, having become something of an expert on the constant repackagings of public domain stuff, I had to say something to counter at least one (if not more) of the other comments on here, just to try to steer people away from confusion.

(I would have just addressed this to the poster in question, but no one pays much attention to the comments, so any confusion he would have inadvertently caused would remain.)

First let me say that this is a public domain set, meaning the copyrights have expired and anyone can release any of these films, and owe no one anything.  Although the prints the companies that specialize in these things use can vary in quality from terrible to very nice, once you've dealt with them often enough you come to expect that.  (And a lot of them use exactly the same prints, often old 16mm tv prints.)  As such, I don't feel guilty at all in reviewing a set that I don't own; in effect, I do already own it, since I have most of these films in other p.d. sets.

(There are a couple of gems to be found here, nevertheless:  ""Juggernaut"" and especially ""The Snake People"" don't turn up all that often.  And I've no clue about the doc about Karloff hosted by Chris Lee, though I'd love to see it sometime!  Heck, it might be worth the price of the set!)

But what bothered me enough to write a review is that, in the rather confused review in question, 11 of you have said it helped them.  (No, I won't mention his name, but it'll be obvious which review I'm referring to, if need be.)  That doesn't mean the prior review has left you confused; it means worse than that, it means that it's left you sure of things, even though those things are confused or wrong.  And all that does is foster even more unnecessary or unwarranted complaints on here.  (I'm sure the poster didn't intend that...though even he mentioned that there were 4 of the 5 Karloff ""Mr. Wong"" films in this set, and that's incorrect, according to Amazon's listing of the contents all 5 of them are on here, so perhaps he doesn't even own it, either.)

Within the space of a single paragraph and a handful of sentences he lists three entirely different sets (one of which was this one, of course) and a few individually available films, and quite possibly the result is to get them all mixed up to anyone reading his review.  So, just to keep things straight:

1.  Obviously this isn't the Universal Lugosi set, and yes, that does include a lot of the really quality stuff that Karloff did for Universal.

2.  No, this isn't the Universal Karloff set, though the earlier post might confuse people about that.  As for that set having inferior films (which may or may not have been what he was trying to say; was he referring to it, or to this one?) it's a matter of opinion.  Arguably the best of the Universal horrors other than the franchises (Frankenstein, the Mummy, Dracula) were the team-ups between Lugosi and Karloff...but there were only a handful of those.  Since Lugosi didn't do all that many Universal films, they put them in the Lugosi set, so the Karloff set didn't have any of them.  But that certainly doesn't mean that every film in the Karloff set was a throwaway; Universal was the best in the business at horror back then.  (But whether you like the films is, of course, a matter of taste.)  At any rate, both Universal sets have nice prints.

3.  Finally, seemingly out of nowhere, he mentions ""The Ghoul,"" a nice little film made in England and distributed in the States by MGM.  Despite his having mentioned it in close connection with all of these, it isn't available in any of these sets, only as an individual purchase.

I think Amazon does everyone a great service by allowing comments on the products.  I think the more educated you are about what you're buying, the more satisfied you'll be.

On the other hand, they run the risk of doing a great disservice to people by not editing comments.  Aside from the occasional (unintentional) confusion, as in this case, there are also the many, many times when I've seen comments running down the quality of the films or product simply because someone was unhappy with the service of some third party or happened to receive the inevitable faulty disk.  That stuff has no business even being in the comments about the product or film (or whatever).  It can take the rating of an otherwise excellent product down, especially if it's on the fringe and there are only a handful of people commenting about it.  (Of course, if someone receives the same problem with the same disks over and over again, then it has every right to be posted here as something to warn people about.)

As for p.d. stuff, the pages are full of people complaining that the transfers aren't good, the films aren't what they'd expected, and on and on.  If you're buying a set of films that average $1.00 apiece, did you expect them all to be pristine remastered transfers?

Come on, they are what they are.  Buy them with that in mind, and you'll be a lot happier.  Any complaints about them are more because the people weren't realistic about what they were buying than about the actual quality of what they received.

My 3 stars, by the way, have everything to do with my opinion of the films included here, and what I assume the quality of the prints and transfers to be without having actually seen them...and I was tempted to give the set 4.  But I wouldn't do that without actually having the set and viewing the films myself.  I just haven't swayed things one way or the other, which I think is fair.",1351468800,,5615,4.527777777777778
8202956,3,B000RXZIN4,"I picked this collection up when I was itching for some BK films that I'd never seen before. They were watchable enough on my old Sharp 27"" tube set, but now that I have a 40"" Sony LCD, these cheap, pixilated DVD's just don't cut it anymore. So now I try to get my flicks with the highest quality picture available. ALL OF THE FILMS IN THIS COLLECTION ARE AVAILABLE SEPERATELY WITH SUPERIOR PICTURE AND SOUND, some better than others of course, so shop wisely. This box set is a great way to inexpensively explore the works of one of the greatest genre actors of the 20th century, but if you are seriously building a Karloff collection and you care about picture and sound quality, well... as they say, you get what you pay for ~",1334016000,,729,4.367647058823529

8202958,5,B000RXZIN4,"Passport Video and Koch Entertainment Distribution present ""THE BORIS KARLOFF BOX: 15 FRIGHTFUL FILMS"" (Dolby digitally remastered) --- Boris Karloff was an English actor, who migrated to Canada in the 1910s, best known for his roles in horror films and his portrayal of Frankenstein's monster in 1931 film Frankenstein --- His popularity following Frankenstein in the early 1930s was such that for a brief time he was billed simply as ""Karloff"" or, on some movie posters, ""Karloff the Uncanny"".

Once Karloff arrived in Hollywood, California, he made dozens of silent films, but work was sporadic, and he often had to take up manual labor--such as digging ditches and driving a cement truck--to pay the bills --- His role as the Monster in Frankenstein (1931) made him a star --- A year later, he played another iconic character, Imhotep, in The Mummy.

The five foot eleven, brown-eyed Karloff played a wide variety of roles in other genres besides horror --- He was memorably gunned down in a bowling alley in the original version of Scarface --- He gave an excellent performance in the 1934 John Ford epic The Lost Patrol --- Karloff gave a string of superb performances in 1930s Universal horror movies, including several with his main rival as heir to the horror throne of Lon Chaney, Sr., Bela Lugosi, whose rejection of Karloff's role in Frankenstein made Karloff's subsequent career possible --- Karloff played Frankenstein's monster three times; the other films being Bride of Frankenstein (1935) and Son of Frankenstein (1939), which also featured Lugosi as the demented Ygor (From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia)

8202959,3,B000RXZIN4,"Frightfully terrible. This 4 disc collection is not the best of Karloff. The closet any box set has come is THE BELA LUGOSI COLLECTION. 4 of 5 flicks star Karloff during his Universal Pictures days at the height of his career. Universal's THE BORIS KARLOFF COLLECTION is a dismal tribute for this legendary actor. Many of the movies on this collection are throw aways or can be purchased seperately. 4 of the 5 delightful Mr. Wong films are included and if you are looking for this, just get the entire set that is in print. This is not to say there are not a few diamonds in the rough. THE GHOUL which was a loan out for MGM in England is very good but too reminiscent of THE MUMMY, but has enough chills to keep you watching. THE APE, a later film in career isn't bad either. The rest are basically cheap Poverty Row B movies. Excluding his FRANKENSTEIN AND MUMMY classics, there are others made during his peak that could be released as a box set. One film that is sorely missing is James Whale's grotesque but humor ""THIS DARK OLD HOUSE"", as well as many others. The price is right, the transfers are so-so as they were released by a small and cheap video company. So don't waste your money. THE GHOUL and THE APE as well as the WONG collection are readily available and better quality than this poorly assembled tribute.

It is amazing that a star of his stature did not make much money for his work. The most was $30,000! Lugosi fared worse with his highest earnings twice as small as Karloff. This may have been a great deal of money during the 30's but other stars were making more and were less popular than Karloff. A rip off--almost as much as this set.",1190678400,11,1664,4.385113268608414

  This is a very good cross section of Karloff's films and shows his range outside the horror movie vain. The ""Mr. Wong"" movies were always fun. This looks to be the one fans have been waiting for.
