7960666,4,B0000649IA,"There seem to be a lot of competing screen/TV versions of this Dickens classic around, and the general consensus suggests that this is one of the best. I have not read the novel, and my familiarity with the competition is limited to the brief and jaded 1947 film of 88 minutes directed by Cavalcanti, and the stunning Trevor Nunn  stage production for the Royal Shakespeare Company ( telecast over eight 1-hour episodes by the BBC ) that is one of the crowning glories of the British theatre, alas no longer available. As an adult experience, this present adaptation worked well for me. Clocking in at 180 minutes, the action moved quickly ---- at times too quickly --- and the skeleton of the plot was clearly displayed. As to the flesh, well it seems that some reviewers were upset that there was too much of it. I cannot refute the charges of ""sexual innuendo"" in this version that distorts Dickens' treatment of his characters, and it certainly comes at a price. One of my missions in life is to wean my grandchildren aged 11 to 16 away from the awful North American culture that is all around them ( too much sex and violence, etc) and expose them to the inspiring British literature and art with which I grew up at their age. The emphasis on children and childhood is central to most of Dickens' greatest novels. Oliver Twist and David Copperfield enthralled them, and taught them that there was a cultural world beyond Batman and Superman. But this version of Nicholas had to be aborted, sad to report. British children simply do not ""do"" rape! A further technical problem for juniors is the rapid editing and cutting back and forth between different scenes, making it difficult for them to follow the sequence of the plot. Perhaps in another decade............. But this directorial device made for taught adult viewng, and the flesh that the various actors brought to their wildly idiosyncratic characters was little short of breathtaking. Smikes (Lee Ingleby); the entire Squeers family led by that wonderfully disgusting role model, Gregor Fisher; the genial Cheeryble twins who actually looked and behaved like twins; the lecherously parasitical aristocracy, down to the tiniest bit-role ---- all treated the viewer to a feast of virtuoso acting that only the Brits can provide. As the two major protagonists, James D'Arcy as Nicholas and Charles Dance as Uncle Ralph were well matched, slugging it out for round after round and twist after turn until only one of the two was left standing. For the rest, the picture quality was excellent and the musical score an unwelcome distraction. But there is another twist to the tail: the version I originally bought was the PAL version that is a fraction the price of the regular N American edition. My system has played PAL after PAL without fail, but not this time. My enquiry to importcds from whom I bought the product on the Amazon.com website has gone unanswered for several weeks, but I was lucky enough to borrow a regular DVD from a friend, making this review possible.",1328400000,,3033,4.821497120921305

7960668,3,B0000649IA,I am afraid that I did not warm to this production but I admit that this is my first Nicholas Nicleby and I have not read the book - so perhaps I would not warm to the book either.  Charles Dance is excellent at being nasty as he was in the recent superb BBC adaption of Bleak House.,1265241600,,283,3.8793103448275863
