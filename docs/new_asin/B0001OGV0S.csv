2023512,4,B0001OGV0S,"Was mystery writer Edgar Wallace's ""The Green Archer"" the original inspiration for DC comics' The Green Arrow? Quite possibly. This is an entertaining old-time movie serial. (""The Archer""  was also used as a villain in a Golden Age Superman story. He somewhat resembled Wallace's Green Archer.)",1443484800,,294,5.391304347826087

2023519,4,B0001OGV0S,"Knox Manning's spirited next-chapter ""teasers"" reflect the comic approach used by director James W. Horne for ""The Green Archer,"" Columbia's 15-chapter serial from 1940, loosely based on a story by Edgar Wallace, with screenplay by Morgan B. Cox, John Cutting and Jesse A. Duffy.

Abel Bellamy (James Craven), has taken over Garr Castle, a replica in America of his ancestral home, by having his younger brother Michael (Kenne Duncan) falsely convicted of a crime.  He has closed the castle to the lucrative tourist trade established by his father so he can use it as headquarters for a gang of jewel thieves, and has the train wrecked that is taking his brother to prison.  He also has Michael's wife, Elaine (Dorothy Fay) locked up in the castle, knowing that she suspects him of being behind all the trouble.  But Michael's friend, ace insurance investigator Spike Holland (Victor Jory), after failing to catch some of the gang preying on a jewel-laden patron of the opera, rents a house for Elaine's father, Parker Howett (Forrest Taylor) and his other daughter Valerie (Iris Meredith) across from the castle to get proof of the master criminal's guilt.  Abel has one of his men, Brad (Jack Ingram) impersonate the castle's legend, The Green Archer to carry out some of his neferious deeds, but a second Green Archer appears, who is helpful to Spike, Valerie and her father.

A plot of this kind invites playing it ""over the top.""  Not all of the cast is up to James Craven's abilities, making the comedy a little uneven, but it works most of the time, if usually to the detriment of credibility.  Many of Columbia's special effects are not good; the ""exploding"" warehouse in Chapter 4 and the burning house in Chapter 14 look exactly like the small models that they are, but the interior scenes of the castle are quite effective, aided by secret passages, hidden traps and, of course, a collapsing room.

VCI's edition, #8317 is on two double-layer DVD's, providing plenty of space to contain the nearly 5-hour total running time.  Another review indicates it is now issued on DVD-R, so check that your player is rated to work with ""DVD-R DL"" and ""DVD+R DL"" discs.  While not the best news, VCI usually drops the old Macrovision copy protection with the change to DVD-R, avoiding a problem with a slight bend at the top of screen with some monitors.  The serial is from a good but not outstanding 16mm reduction print, sharp enough but with moderate grain and occasional ""dirt,"" mostly ""white flecks"" from the negative, though some places seem to have markings intentionally put on the film.  The image is slightly oversized, cutting off part of the bottom line of the ""recap"" titles in some chapters, though no problems with decapitation of the actors from the framing.  The contrast is a little high but the gray scale is usually adequate, and where used the grainy stock footage is easily detected, such as the train wreck in chapter one.  The sound has some clipping distortion typical for existing prints of this serial and most obvious in the title music; the dialogue remains clear enough.  A reasonably good transfer, and the chapters are complete, including the opening Columbia logo and ""teasers"" for next week's installment.  ""Bonus Features"" on Disc 1 are trailers for Columbia serials ""Blackhawk,"" ""The Iron Claw,"" ""Pirates of the High Seas"" and ""The Green Archer"" plus ""bios"" of Victor Jory, Iris Meredith and director James W. Horne.  The second disc has the ""Cliffhanger Promo"" with clips from serials advertising VCI's editions.

The Restored Serials edition is on two DVD-R discs, single-layer which should work on most players.  The discs are said to be ""scratch proof"" and I got a partial demonstration; my copy came with one of the discs loose in the case, and no damage could be seen.  The image has been cleaned up, frame by frame according to the notes.  It is a little odd to have gone to that much work and then release it compressed to fit on two single-layer discs, but it looks good, and has also been issued with less compression on Blu-Ray.  There are a couple places where the motion gets stuck briefly; maybe where some bad frames were deleted, but otherwise the action is reasonably smooth.  The source print appears to be nearly identical to VCI's, no sharper nor with any improvement in gray scale and with the same framing issues, but the ""white flecks"" are mostly gone and the grain has been reduced making the image look better.  Unfortunately the grain was also cleaned up on the miserable stock footage of the train wreck, something that goes beyond ""restoration.""  The sound has the same distortion, and the ""hiss"" level is a little higher than VCI's, probably due to less filtering.  There are extra features, including the trailer for ""The Green Archer"" in slightly better shape than VCI's copy, but the rest of the ""extras"" are in DVD-ROM format, requiring a computer.  These include five lobby cards, the ""Pressbook"" with suggestions for promoting the serial, and the ""continuity"" script from the 1927 serial ""The Terrible People"" based on another Edgar Wallace story.

Alpha's edition, # 5528D is on a single disc, double-layer.  While the copy I got was on a normal ""pressed"" DVD, Alpha has lately been using DVD-R, with the same playback issues as VCI's release.  There is a head-switch glitch near the bottom of the frame, showing it is from a videotape source.  The image is a little fuzzy and often quite grainy, with even more ""dirt"" than VCI's DVD, though the worst of it is in the same places so it is either from the same print or the ""dirt"" was copied when the 16mm reduction was made.  The contrast is lower than VCI's, though the gray scale isn't better.  Unfortunately the digital compression used by Alpha to fit the serial on two layers results in some unsmooth motion at certain speeds; the stock-footage train in the first chapter showing this very well.  The sound is not as clear as either the VCI or Serials Restored edition, muffled and somewhat ""boomy"" in the lower frequencies.  And there is no Columbia logo at the start of the chapters.  No surprises for those familiar with Alpha's releases, but one needs tolerance for the defects to take advantage of the cost difference.

While not likely to appeal to everyone, and my opinion of it seems to be different every time I watch it, ""The Green Archer"" is one of the better examples of James W. Horne's approach to serials.  James Craven and his bumbling underlings provide entertainment, though the humor is helped by waiting a day or so between chapters.  While not ideal, both the VCI and Restored Serials DVD's have good image quality and adequate sound.  The Alpha DVD isn't as good, but is still ""watchable"" on a smaller display if expectations are not high.",1378598400,,6789,4.8181034482758625

This is one fun ride i recommend it to serial fans who would see the humor as well as enjoy the action.

The sound and picture quality on this DVD is adequate; I heard and saw all that was necessary to enjoy this sweet piece of nostalgia.

2023528,3,B0001OGV0S,"We who remember the 10 year serial decade(1936-1945) first hand, knew there was something wrong with Columbia serials after the last Bill Elliot series. As children we lacked the proper vocabulary, it just seemed that Columbia's serials were making fun of themselves. We were right. The answer was Director James Horne who, it seems, had a split personality. His heroes were ""straight"" but his bad guys were a farce without being funny. Compare the Green Archer with Young Frankenstein and it becomes clear. Victor Jory and other pros save The Archer from Horne's misguided sense of life being a bad joke. Serials were not designed for that. Republic's Ralph Byrd and Rod Cameron were the ideal serial stars in their smooth, straight acting that struck the right balance between the serious and the routine. This Green Archer comes across almost as a stage, not a film presentation. It becomes difficult to take the perils and suspense seriously when the threat comes from combination of Lou Costello and Sidney Whiplash Holt of the Secret Service and Captain Midnight are more of Horne's bad jokes. They anticipate but do not replace Saturday morning kid's cartoons. And to think that real hard cash was spent making Terry and the Pirates is hard to believe.",1317168000,,1259,4.971563981042654

2023530,4,B0001OGV0S,"If you are an outlaw looking for employment, you might find yourself escorted to Garr Castle and then into a secret chamber with high stone walls and a simple wooden desk facing a small table and chairs.  The lights dim, the other crooks hush and doff their hats as the Governor of Crooks strolls in: his name is Abel Bellamy.

While Abel lays out his plan to have his goons derail the train carrying his brother Michael to prison, you can't keep your eyes off the large painting behind him.  It is a woodsy scene with, what looks like, Robin Hood taking aim with his long bow.  He sports a feathered cap, cape, and mask.  As you stare you get the creepy feeling he is staring back ...

As it turns out, it is not a painting of Robin, but a likeness of the legendary Green Archer who comes to the aid of the Bellamy family when they are in trouble.  Although Abel is a Bellamy, he is the one causing the trouble - eliminating his brother so that Abel can inherit the castle and capturing his brother's wife Elaine to prevent her from finding incriminating evidence.

Unfortunately for Abel, with the disappearance of Elaine, her sister Valerie begins snooping around.  Worse still, ace insurance investigator Spike Holland gets involved.  Despite Spike's valiant attempts to outwit Abel, Abel is able to trap Spike in many deadly situations; sometimes Spike escapes through pure dumb luck, but other times he is freed by the ""real"" Green Archer ...

Overall:  A much better than average serial;  the last cliffhanger looks truly dangerous.  The picture is a little fuzzy with defects and a thin distortion band at the bottom.  The sound is a little coarse but understandable.  Measured run time: 296 minutes.",1295222400,,1708,4.681208053691275

2023537,4,B0001OGV0S,"Egads, a serial with an underlying current of humor!  Not that it's a comedy; in fact it's a prototypical movie serial with fights, chases, a sprawling gothic castle with dungeons and deathtraps in every corner, secret passages, medieval treasure, and a mysterious masked hero running around doing all kinds of mysterioua things.  Director James Horne was known not for great serials, but for his lighthearted approach to them.  Once I realized the crooks were playing it for laughs, I started to really enjoy it.

James Craven (""The Purple Monster Strikes"") plays Abel Bellamy, who has tuned the family castle into a den of thieves and framed his brother to a long prison term.  His nefarious plot might have succeeded if only he had hired competent henchmen; instead, they fall all over one another trying to carry out his orders.  His reaction to their botched jobs is hilarious--by Chapter 8 or 9 he's about to have a stroke at the antics of his idiot gang.  The confusion between the good and bad Green Archers is also funny, and Fred Kelsey is a hoot as the bumbling police inspector Captain Thompson, who looks like a refugee from a Three Stooges comedy.  Another humorous bit is the performance of Kit Guard, the little guy who plays Dinky with his continuous malapropisms.

Craven is really the star of this serial, but Victor Jory as the hero, ace insurance investigator Spike Holland, is more than competent.  Jory is in perpetual motion as he runs around fighting the bad guys and saving the good guys.  The ultra-hot Iris Meredith (""The Spider's Web"") plays the sister of the woman whom Abel Bellamy is holding prisoner in the castle.  Two of the leading actors from ""Manhunt of Mystery Island"" are also present, Forrest Taylor as the father of the two women, and Kenne Duncan (""The Spider's Web"", ""Haunted Harbor"") as Mike Bellamy, sent to prison via his brother Abel Bellamy's frame-up.

James W. Horne was a real staple at Columbia, directing every one of their serials, without a co-director, from late 1939 until his death in mid-1942--that's ten consecutive serials.

The humor lifts this above the ordinary.  And there are enough surprises and cases of mistaken identity along the way to make this a most enjoyable serial.",1136678400,,2242,4.878627968337731

2023539,4,B0001OGV0S,"THE GREEN ARCHER is based on an Edgar Wallace mystery, concerning a gentleman thief operating from his mob's castle headquarters, and an elusive figure who sends warnings by shooting arrows. This 15-chapter serial of 1940 was intended not just for kids but for a more adult audience. However, the film is about as sophisticated as a Three Stooges movie (with some of the same Columbia contract players!). The local law enforcement is represented by Laurel & Hardy/Stooges foil Fred Kelsey, which tells you how serious this enterprise is.

Serial producers used the first three chapters to sell the film to exhibitors, so director James W. Horne exercises relative restraint for these early episodes. Stay with it, because starting with Chapter 4, Horne plants the tongue firmly in cheek and lets the whole project slide. Hero and villains indulge in over-the-top dramatics. Narrator Knox Manning gets into the spirit, too (the announcer in the 1960s ""Batman"" TV series must have been exposed to Manning's urgent recitations).

Horne gives the serial fans some well-staged thrills (sample: hero and friends are trapped on a high ledge as the building collapses beneath them), but he refuses to take things TOO seriously (sample: the villains play tiddly-winks in their hideout!). Horne also gets screen credit as one of the writers.

The earnest Victor Jory is fine as the rock-jawed hero (an insurance investigator; he's not the leotard-clad Green Archer). The refined James Craven is magnificent as Jory's urbane nemesis. Craven is the Wile E. Coyote of serial villains: he plans intricate death traps, but he EXPECTS his henchmen to fail! Like the coyote, Craven never gives up. The goon squad has the usual Columbia serial faces: Jack Ingram and Kit Guard are most memorable, with Al Ferguson, Cy Schindell, and Eddie Fetherston among the others.

If you can take your serials less than 100% seriously, you'll enjoy this fascinatingly bizarre cliffhanger. Never mind the plot; you'll probably guess the outcome during Chapter 1. By the two-thirds mark, you'll be well accustomed to the mock-serious tone. Just keep your eye on Jory and Craven, and watch the fun. The source print is a fine 16mm print, and picture and sound quality are good.",1107993600,,2244,5.106267029972752
2023540,3,B0001OGV0S,"This is based on an Edgar Wallace novel...well, it sure isn't very true to the novel, but it's a light hearted look at the main concept with its share of thrills, hairbreadth escapes, mixed with some satirical humor, double takes, & so forth.  James Craven who portraye Ivan Shark in CAPTAIN MIDNIGHT is the tongue-in-cheek villian here.
You see, he's framed his brother and had the train taking the brother to jail derailed in order to finish him off, imprisoned his fiance in a secret room, uses some vicious dogs to guard her and the entire castle.  He also has a gang of rather dim-witted crooks, one in particular.
He's capitalizing on the green archer legend surrounding the castle by having a gang member dress up in the requisite outfit.  Only trouble, a second green archer who obviously is out to foil the villian suddenly shows up.  Victor Jory shows up as an insurance investigator (I think he was a reporter and not even the main hero in the novel), falls in love with the imprisoned girl's sister, and we take it from there for 12 chapters until we finally find out (surprise, surprise, as if any intelligent kindergartner couldn't figure it out) who the real green archer is.
Good fun if you don't take your serials serially, I mean seriously.",1028851200,,1258,4.678733031674208
2023541,3,B0001OGV0S,"Watching this serial can almost give almost the same pleasure as watching a good Laurel and Hardy short. One of Horne's techniques was to use the villains as butts for some humorous jabs. James Craven (head villain) is a hoot as he rants and raves against his blundering underlings; when he isn't doing this he is correcting their English or juicily dreaming up some more deviltry. Sarcastic end of chapter narrations also add to the fun--""Is Bellamy giving his gang a pep talk?"", etc. Hilarious last shot in chapter 15: Victor Jory while going upstairs suddenly clutches a shield and covers his derriere to protect himself against the arrows of a future green archer.",980035200,,668,4.868421052631579
2023542,4,B0001OGV0S,"Based on an Edgar Wallace story, this 1940 serial was intended not just for kids but for a more adult audience. However, the film is about as sophisticated as a Three Stooges movie (with some of the same Columbia contract players!). Tongue-in-cheek direction (by James Horne, a comedy director) has heroes and villains alike indulging in over-the-top theatrics. The earnest Victor Jory is fine as the hero, and the refined James Craven is magnificent as the villain. Craven is the Wile E. Coyote of serial villains: he EXPECTS his henchmen to fail! Many of the thrill scenes are well staged (sample: Jory and friends are trapped on a high ledge as the building collapses beneath them). But the main thing about ""The Green Archer"" is the Dumb-with-a-capital-D comic touches (sample: the villains play tiddly-winks in their hideout!). If you can take your serials less than 100% seriously, you'll enjoy this fascinatingly bizarre 15-chapter cliffhanger. The source print is a fine 16mm print, and picture and sound quality are good.",977356800,,1030,5.100591715976331
