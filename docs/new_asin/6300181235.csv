7804294,5,6300181235,"You'll see these two episodes of ""The Jack Benny Program"" on this video (which both reach the ""very funny"" level on my comedy meter).........

1.) ""The Christmas Show"" (original air date: December 18, 1960) is one of the best Benny episodes of the whole series. Jack goes Christmas shopping in a department store and drives a store clerk (played by Mel Blanc) out of his mind by constantly wanting to change a gift he bought. Jack cannot seem to decide between a $40.00 wallet as a gift for his announcer Don Wilson or a $1.98 wallet. (Guess which wallet wins the battle.) LOL!

This entire Christmas Show script is the same identical one that Benny performed several other times, on both his television series and radio show. In fact, the packaging for this video has made an error with regard to the date of this ""Christmas Show"" version. The box shows a ""1958"" copyright date, which is incorrect. Benny did very similar Christmas shows in both 1957 and 1958, but the show on this tape is the 1960 program.

You'll be able to spy character actor Richard Deacon as a store employee in this Jack Benny Christmas show. He's given a very funny one-liner too. Also on hand are Benny sidekicks Dennis Day, Rochester, and Frank Nelson. Dennis sings ""Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer"" for the show's one musical number.

2.) ""The Railroad Station"" is the second entry on this video. First aired on March 23, 1958 (Episode #91; Season #8). .... Jack is going to take a train trip to New York City. Part of the show is filmed at Union Station in Los Angeles. Like the other episode on this tape, there are no major guest stars in this episode; just the regular cast members.

The video prints used for these two episodes look very nice and clear. The tape runs in Standard (SP) mode.

All six of these MCA/Universal Home Video ""Jack Benny"" tapes feature a short ""trailer"" ad at the beginning of each video, which advertises the series of Benny tapes and shows some clips from the episodes contained on the videos.

7804295,5,6300181235,"Volume 5 of this MCA/Universal series of VHS videos gives us two more funny episodes of
""The Jack Benny Program"". ..........

1.) ""Jack Is Kidnapped"" (originally aired on March 12, 1963, during the 13th season of Jack's TV series) has Jack abducted in the middle of the night and held for a ransom of $10,000.  Now, you and I both know, that it's going to take a lot of coercion to make Jack Benny fork over 10-grand!  This is a very funny episode, that has George Burns popping up at the bank for a brief cameo appearance.

The ending of the episode is a hoot, as it's revealed that the bank actually had to go out of business due to Jack's unexpected withdrawal of funds. LOL!

Another highlight is when Jack is given an ultimatum by his kidnappers of: ""You hand over the money or we break both of your legs!""

To which Jack replies (after considerable contemplation): ""Does it have to be BOTH?""

Another LOL!

2.) The video's second installment is ""The Lucille Ball Show"", which was first shown on national TV on October 2, 1964. This was Benny TV episode #232.

Lucy joins Jack in a relatively unfunny comedy sketch. But, still, it's fun to see Jack & Lucy working together on the same stage.

Actually, the highlight of this particular Benny Program comes via a fairly unlikely source -- that being a bit part by Arte Johnson (who would later go on to great success on the ""Laugh-In"" TV series).  Johnson, who plays a member of Benny's stage crew for this episode, does a very funny bit that ends with a really good joke.

This Universal Video product was released in 1994 and sports a running time of approx. 51 minutes. No commercials are included. Audio is in Hi-Fi Mono. Speed is SP (Standard Play) mode. Black-and-White. Closed-Captioned.",1099612800,,1748,4.585209003215434
7804296,5,6300181235,"in the first episode seen on this video, Jack and Rochester are Christmas shopping. his legendary supporting cast from radio make an appearance in the department store: Mel Blanc stars as a sales clerk who gets driven insane by Jack's gift giving to Don Wilson: Jack can't seem to make up his mind on what kind of greeting to give Don along with the billfold...several times he insists that the clerk get the package. each time, Mel has to un-wrap it, take out the card, and Jack write something new...only moments later to do it all over again when Jack changes his mind! this goes on throughout the show. Frank Nelson is seen as the floor walker. Charlie Cantor, the radio actor known for his dopey voices, appears as a sales clerk too. Richard Deacon, known as Mel Cooley on the Dick Van Dyke Show, appears as a sales clerk who ""in a rush of wild enthusiasm i sold my pants"" he sarcastically tells Dennis Day after he asks Deacon if he's a sales clerk. that line was a running gag on the radio show whenever there was a scene inside a store. Benny Rubin used to say a line like that all the time. Meanwhile, Jack visits Mel for another time. This time he wants to change the greeting again...Mel insists that he's already sent it to the delivery room. Jack demands that he goes and gets it. After a scene with Rochester at another part of the store, the camera shifts back to Jack where he's still waiting on Mel. Mel enters sobbing and crying...his suit all torn up because he chased the delivery truck a few blocks! Mel's sobbing and exaggerated pain cracks Jack up. Later, Rochester informs Jack that he wants to give him a nice gift. Jack realizes the true spirit of Christmas and he says: ""don't be silly, it isn't the price of the gift. it's the spirit in which it's given...whether it be $40.00 or $1.98"". Jack gets that look of puzzlement and he walks over to Mel again, who's still crying. Mel cries: ""don't tell me you want to change the card again?"". Jack says: ""no, instead of sending the $40.00 wallet i want the one for $1.98"". Mel screams, pulls out a gun and walks in the backroom. a gun shot is heard...Jack shows some sympathy for the suicide before thinking about the change due to him. He says out loud: ""$40.00 from $1.98. let's see, i got some change coming to me"" and he helps himself to the register! on the second episode, Jack and the gang are on a train trip to New York. Artie Auerbach appears as ""Mr. Kitzel"" and Benny Rubin appears as the ""I dunno"" train depot clerk. Mel Blanc appears in the early scene as a plumber. Later, his voice is heard as the train depot announcer. Frank Nelson is also on hand as another depot clerk. Herb Vigran appears in the opening scene as the milkman. The plot of the show is Jack thinking a woman wants to elope with him after a woman dials the wrong number. You'll be surprised who the woman really wants to elope with. These two episodes are classic, 5-star material.",1073001600,,2936,4.418819188191882
7804297,4,6300181235,"Highly recommended.  Contain two episodes, and the first is the best, with Jack being kidnapped and robbed.  The scene at the bank when Jack is forced to withdrawl $10,000 is hilarious.  In the 2nd episode, Jack teams up with  Lucille Ball to play a historical parody of Paul Revere; only good for a  few laughs.",929836800,11,312,4.6
