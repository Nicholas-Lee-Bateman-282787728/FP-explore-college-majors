7912337,3,B00000JKXA,"My 3-year-old son loves trucks, and was fascinated by a monster truck show he saw on TV one evening.  So I bought this video for him.  He likes it a lot, so it gets some stars.  But half the enjoyment of monster trucks, at least as I see it, is the noise they make.  And most of the trucks in this video are silent -- their awesome noise completely covered by music.  Well, at least the music is pretty good -- powerful rocking stuff.  But I think my little boy would be more interested in hearing the truck's true sounds.  On top of that flaw, the editors have introduced some special effects with the video footage -- I guess they don't think plain old monster trucks crunching over everything in sight and crashing and rolling on the ground is exciting enough.  Not too many effects, but more than necessary.  So not a perfect monster truck video.  At least there isn't any annoying narration!",994636800,7,896,4.441717791411043
