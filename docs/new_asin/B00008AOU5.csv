2696938,1,B00008AOU5,"Wow, could this thing be any worse???  If inanity won an Academy Award this thing would win it hands down!.  Don't really know how anybody in their right mind would buy this thing let alone put it on Amazon or any other video subscription service.  A - zero rating if that were possible!",1395964800,,287,4.377358490566038
2696939,1,B00008AOU5,"Waste your life on something else, because this would be the kind of senseless waste of time, without even the redeeming quality of ""campiness,""  that you would forever regret taking a single minute to scan through.",1368144000,3,215,4.972222222222222
2696940,4,B00008AOU5,"This is a silly comedy pseudo documentary about a group of irritating people on a weekend jaunt in the woods looking for a UFO. It's not so much about aliens as it is about people who would alienate anyone they met, the worst being Bob, the self-appointed leader, whose micromanaging control-freakish nature makes one wish aliens would abduct him. This is a dorky, light entertainment for those times when you want to feel superior to fictional people. It did leave me with one burning question: Who the hell was carrying the tent poles?",1368144000,4,537,4.78494623655914
2696941,1,B00008AOU5,"I wish I had read the reviews before I subjected myself to this trash. If a group of people tried to make the worst possible movie ever, it would be a miracle no matter how skillful they were.

I think the scene where they come across a tree with condoms, handcuffs and dildos hanging from it was the most off the wall, or maybe the scene where the girl is humping the tree.

Definitely NOT RECOMMENDED. The scene where they encounter a phone booth in the middle of the forest has the music (if you can call it that) from 2001  and has them worshipping the phone booth like the monkeys worshipped the obelisk.",1358380800,18,609,4.324561403508772
2696942,1,B00008AOU5,"This might be used, in a class, if you were to use each scene to demonstrate the ways one can make errors in all aspects of film making.
At least they shot enough story scenes to get something to edit together. I don't know how it ends.... I never got through the thing. My guess, is that is a film makers first effort at writing, framing and editing.",1346889600,11,351,4.176470588235294
2696943,1,B00008AOU5,"THIS FILM IS A TOTAL WASTE OF TIME AND MAY KILL BRAIN CELLS!!

We started skipping ahead through this film after the first 10 min looking for something worth watching and never found anything.  The dialog. well I just can't find the words to discribe how bad it was.",1345334400,9,266,4.408163265306122
2696944,5,B00008AOU5,"Great production quality for an indie film.  Worth the price, particularly because this is the only place I can see my old friend Cindy Klayman live and talking since we've lost touch with eachother (she's not dead by the way - she's still live and talking, just not to me).  This should be your favorite movie in your Cindy Klayman entertainment collection.  Enjoy!

2696945,5,B00008AOU5,"This is an hilarious spoof of sci fi films. Although clearly low-budget,
I was laughing throughout. Marc Berlin has a weird, crazy view of things.",1213056000,2,146,4.88

2696947,2,B00008AOU5,"ABSOLUTELY THE WORST. BOB THE  100 % A-TYPE PERSONALITY  IS THE KIND OF PERSON THAT I NEVER WOULD  WANT TO BE AROUND EVEN IN PASSING.THIS MOVIE MADE ME FEEL MISERABLE, NOTHING UP LIFTING ABOUT IT. FORTUNATELY I DO NOT BELIEVE THE PEOPLE WHO PORTRAYED IN THE MOVIE ARE ANYTHING LIKE THE CHARACTERS. HAVING SAID THAT, WHICH MEANS SOME,  REALLY DO HAVE  GOOD ACTING POTENTIAL",1410480000,,372,4.75

I'm still laughing thinking about it...plus the brunet was hot. :)",1406851200,2,124,4.636363636363637
2696950,5,B00008AOU5,We liked the movie.  Funny.  It was a bit uneven at the end.  Acting was good.,1405209600,,78,3.75

2696952,3,B00008AOU5,"Funny, silly, dumb, and where did they store the tents when they weren't using them? The main character did a pretty good job of a Woody Allen. Too bad Woody Allen didn't direct this. It lacked his genus.",1402617600,2,204,4.394736842105263
2696953,1,B00008AOU5,I had no idea one can make movies like these. My 10 years old would have made a far superior movie. I agree with a previous review that a movie worse than this would be a miracle.,1401321600,,179,3.864864864864865
2696954,2,B00008AOU5,b movie-undefined plot--special effects leave a lot to desire--ending leaves many unanswered questions---and now I need to leave at least seven more words for this review--done,1400630400,,176,5.8076923076923075

8158586,1,B00008AOU5,Ever watch something that you9 wish you could unwatch?  Well this is one of those things.  Horrid.,1503705600,,98,4.705882352941177
8158587,1,B00008AOU5,If I hadn't been doing other things while it was on I'd have never made it to the end.  Incredibly stupid group of people bickering and being stupid while tromping through the woods.  I'm ashamed to admit I even watched it all the way through. Only cool thing going for it was the Alien at 93m52s.  It's a shame it's on screen so briefly.  Obviously the only talent in this film was the effects person.,1457827200,,402,4.32
8158588,1,B00008AOU5,Really not very good at all. No real point to the story.,1445731200,,56,3.75
8158589,1,B00008AOU5,I guess it was meant as a spoof but even for that it was pretty bad.,1441670400,,68,3.3125

8158592,1,B00008AOU5,One of the dumbest movies I've seen in a long time. Please don't waste your valuable time on this Super 8 homemade movie.,1432080000,,121,4.304347826086956
