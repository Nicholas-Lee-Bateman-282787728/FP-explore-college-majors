8439326,3,B004RV3P8C,"This interview was something I was looking forward to seeing.  I found it interesting ut not great.
 There were plenty of good stories of wrestlers and territories but it seemed he slipped between the man and the wrestler.
  I would recommend it for those who no nothing about him but for true diehards its just ok.
  The Matches were typical Abdullah but there were too few of them.",1314748800,,383,4.5588235294117645
8439327,5,B004RV3P8C,"If you love Abby, you will LOVE this DVD.
Not only is there an over two-hour interview that gives you a peek into Abby inside & outside of the ring, but you get some amazing matches with legends like Bruiser Brody, Giant Baba, Carlos Colon, Iron Sheik & more...
Enjoy!",1306627200,,268,4.38
8439328,1,B004RV3P8C,"I love Abdullah The Butcher but please if your going to put his best matches on a dvd then at least put 2 hours worth of them,not 85 minutes...This man deserves much more than this meaning his matches should have been placed on 2 discs and just do away with the soundtrack which really does not mean anything.",1304640000,,309,4.344827586206897
