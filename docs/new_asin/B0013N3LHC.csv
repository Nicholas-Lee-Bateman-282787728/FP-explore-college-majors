8252283,4,B0013N3LHC,This is a good story about Mahatma Gandhi. What i like about it is the black and white nature. This in itself take the viewer's mind back to the time of this great man and one feels that he is really watching events of the life of this man in exactly those days he was alive.,1294704000,3,275,3.9285714285714284
8252284,2,B0013N3LHC,"This documentary includes a decent background of the India Gandhi was living in. The historical footage is interesting but repetitive, the key events in his life are simply described in chronological order, the narration is not compelling, the background music wanders between kitsch sitar tunes and inappropriately modern score. Everything about this program looks like they did it on the cheap, but the story is so compelling that you'll probably watch it once if you've seen the Ben Kingsley version. You do get a better picture of how India was part of the British Empire, and how difficult it was for them to break free.",1233792000,10,625,4.961904761904762
