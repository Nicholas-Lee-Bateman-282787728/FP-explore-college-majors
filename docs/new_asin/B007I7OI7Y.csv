8517411,2,B007I7OI7Y,I'm writting this review not so much for the product content but the condition of the DVD when received. The DVD was unwrapped and appeared to be used. Out of the 8 DVD's received three of the DVD's were in this condition. I have not viewed the three in question yet but I was disapointed in the condition. If I'm ordering something new I would expect to receive that product in excellent condition.,1395273600,2,399,4.47945205479452
