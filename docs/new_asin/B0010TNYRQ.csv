8238522,5,B0010TNYRQ,"Cowboy Bodi and the Flyin' Machines is a great, fun, educational video on the joys of aviation.  Our six year old son and his friend watched it during a playdate and they both loved it.  I wandered in and watched it too and also thoroughly enjoyed it.  The educational and historical richness of the video are delivered in a fun and entertaining way for the whole family.  It's well done and very interesting- I learned a lot as well!  And it's a pleasant break from cartoons and mindless videos & movies.  I highly recommend this video for pre-schoolers through mid-elementary kids (our kindergartener totally got it)!

I was lucky enough to get a copy of this video about a year and a half ago when my son was 3 and he loved it on the first watching.  He's now 5 and he still loves this video and wants to know when there will be other Bodi videos.  This video is informative and entertaining.  It doesn't talk down to kids, but rather talks to them, at a few different levels (including how an airfoil works), so it's good for kids at different ages (my 9 year old nephew likes this video as well).  The character is funny and the rapport with the off-screen narrator stays fresh. I enjoy the archival footage.  It's something I can watch over and over again with my son.  So, guys, when is Bodi going to space, riding a train, doing construction...  I need more Cowboy Bodi!",1200873600,,821,4.1847133757961785
