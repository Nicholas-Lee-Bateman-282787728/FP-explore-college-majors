2288803,5,B0009FVSJS,"One of director Chu Yuan's greatest films. His tempo with the storyline not at all convoluted, the seemless choreographed fighting, the intricate plot matched with the ultra-stylish sets. A masterpiece of cinematic presentation.  A very high class brothel is run by a matchless female fighter (Betty Pei Ti) who's 'fingering technique' is instantly lethal.  She falls in love with her latest addition (Lily Ho) to the brothel, and teaches her this deadly style of martial arts, but she spells the downfall of this matchless female fighter/brothel operator.  Yueh Hua is an inspector trying to solve the mysterious murders possibly connected to the brothel. There's plenty of blood, nudity, and violence, as well as ground breaking (what was then very taboo) lesbian issues considered.  An incredibly beautifully filmed story.  A unique masterpiece of martial art cinema strikingly remastered.",1220227200,8,892,5.481751824817518
2288804,4,B0009FVSJS,"For years, I have always loved movies from the Shaw Brothers Studio Company.  And it 2002 when Celestial Pictures, a hong kong based company, bought the rights to the movies, 750 out of 1,000 of them, and were going to get full restoration treatment, I was overjoyed.  The problem?  The movies would only be released in the Asia market, with no American distribution in sight.  The only recourse was buying VCD versions just to be able to view the movies.  (Asian DVD movies are encoded in R3, not playable on US DVD players.)  But, in the last year Shaw movies have been getting US releases, although too few for my taste. Thank you, Image Entertainment.  Thank you, Dragon Dynasty.  And now, Tokyo Shock has gotten into the fold.  As for ""Intimate Confession of a Chinese Courtesan"" this was a movie I have long waited for.  As Celestial dug up various movies, this was one of hundred I discovered.  With the cover, showing two women embracing only told you what kind of movie it is.  But unlike erotic Asian movies, this one is fairly tame.  Unlike another Shaw exploitation movie called, ""Bamboo House of Dolls.""  There are a couple girl to girl kissing scenes, and various naked girls with ugly dudes, but nothing at the level of movies today.

The plot is basically about a corrupt brothel who steals women and sells them into prostitution.  The madam, played by the beautiful Lily Ho, prefers only women for intimacy and comes across a fiery girl, played by Betty Pei Ti, as she grows quite fond of her.  Betty on the other hand fights against the system, trying to retain her freedom.  But when a failed escape arises and a male servant is killed in the process, Betty conforms as Lily's lover and a call girl at the brothel.  But under deception, Betty gets revenge of the men who violated her and eventually going after the madam.

As I originally watched, it became more of a martial art movie then what I expected.  A pleasant surprise. The movie is shot quite beautifully and the performances are top notch.  The story does drag a bit, but the ending is absolutely priceless.  Don't be surprised if you yell back at the TV.  I know I continually do.

This movie is in 2.35 anamorphic widescreen, with both the original Cantonese dialog and a surprising English dub.  The enthusiast in me prefers the original audio with subtitles, but the lazy in me loves the English dub.  Both are great experiences as the dubbed version is surprisingly well done.

If you love old school kung fu movies and particular Shaw Brother movies, you can't lose with this dvd. An Intimate DVD of a Confessed movie lover.",1208563200,23,2611,4.641921397379913

8060073,1,B0009FVSJS,"Horrible sadistic story! I'm not even sending it back, but disposing it in the garbage. I read the book of identical title, but written abbout the girl that was sold by her parents, while family was facing death from hunger in late 1930s China while under Japanese occupation. The book beautifully describes all the incredible adventures but using poetic metaphors during her turbulent life. So I just hoped to got the film based on this book! This DVD however, is just another crude and unpleasant story to watch. We gave it 30 min and stopped, deciding not to waste any more time. One star is OK to give for costumes and cinematography.",1435276800,,638,4.705357142857143

8060077,5,B0009FVSJS,"I don't even know where to start with this one. The Chinese title is AI NU, the name of the main character, whose name is mentioned in the pre-credit sequence, set at the scene of a murder. Was the victim alone? Yes...well, no. Ai Nu was here....

The story of a young girl abducted and sold into prostitution, this is exploitation cinema pushed to the level of High Art. Ai Nu's early time at the brothel is hellish, and we see the seediness and brutality behind the scenes - so often in wuxia, the brothel, as a concept, serves as an elegant dreamland, an escape from the dreary outside world and a rest from the brutality of the ""jiang hu."" Here, we see it all from the back, and it looks like a meat grinder. Ai Nu becomes increasingly hopeless and broken, until an act of kindness from an unexpected party offers her the chance for escape and maybe even revenge.

Even that turns out to be an illusion - yet another cliche' turned on its head by this groundbreaking film. After Ai Nu's failed escape, she seemingly realizes the futility of it all, and the power and wealth she could achieve if she simply goes along with the Madam, played by the equally gorgeous and sinister Betty Pei Ti. And then all hell breaks loose - slowly at first, then with increasing intensity until the jaw-dropping finale at the brothel, where all accounts get SETTLED. I've seen a whole lotta wuxia, and this is definitely top three for the intensity and power of its finale.

The romantic relationship between Lily Ho's Ai Nu and Betty Pei Ti's Chun Yi, and the friendship that begins to bloom between Ai Nu and the officer Chi Te (the always likable Yueh Hua) bring a human warmth to what would otherwise be an inhuman (though thrilling) film. And when Ai Nu shows her true face to all, the film becomes a cathartic tidal wave of blood and fire. Ai Nu becomes nothing less than an Angel, beautiful, dreadful - judgement made flesh.

No, I'm not exaggerating. Trashy, sophisticated, melodramatic, subtle - this is an unexpectedly affecting film, and belongs on your ""must watch"" list. Go for the original Chinese - although the English dub is quite good, it sometimes undermines the emotional impact of key scenes, lowering it from Great to merely ""super cool.""",1402099200,2,2247,4.596009975062344
8060078,3,B0009FVSJS,"the DVD quality wasn't very good, stopped so many times I finanlly gave up. didn't finish the movie.
Movie itself might be a good one - if I can finish watching it...",1378166400,,166,4.21875
8060079,5,B0009FVSJS,"This was shown in fairly complete well-dubbed form as a memorable supporting feature in a few British cinemas when it was still quite new. It caused quite a stir in China because its lesbian angle was tricky and controversial at the time. The splendid Lily Ho in fact swings both ways, using sex as a weapon to destroy the brothel into which she was forcibly abducted. Director Chu Yuan was able to pull it off by dressing it up as a tale of olden times and using familiar surreal Pekin Opera style touches. Indeed his handling of this heady mixture of softcore sex and martial arts is sensitive and sure. It almost qualifies as an art movie in the tradition of Japanese master Kenji Mizoguchi, in some quarters, but in the end best enjoyed as a Shaw Brothers top-notch exploitation drama.",1361750400,,789,4.602836879432624
