3748631,2,B001PMWLYA,"Wow! Where to begin. Let's see, we have horrendous acting, poor special effects, and stupid dialogue. All the makings of a b- movie, which I love. But this is just bad. If you want to laugh for an hour and a half, by all means this is a good pick. Can't believe it's being sold for fifteen dollars.",1457568000,2,298,4.155172413793103
3748632,3,B001PMWLYA,"Pick 20 random people off the street and they could put together a much better acting performance.  I've never laughed so hard at bad acting in my life.

3748633,1,B001PMWLYA,"This felt like a bunch of friends got together for a weekend and, after borrowing an old video camera and downing a case of cheap beer, went out and made a horror movie for fun. The result was one of the most wretched things I've ever watched. The plot made little sense, the dialog was unnecessarily laden with F-bombs, the attempts at humor unfailingly fell flat, the acting was terrible, and most of the characters were outright repellent. There was absolutely nothing redeeming or recommendable here.",1294099200,2,504,4.872093023255814
3748634,1,B001PMWLYA,THIS WAS ABSOLUTELY THE WORST MOVIE I MIGHT HAVE EVER SEEN..IF THEY PAID THESE ACTORS MORE THAN $20.00 EACH..THAT MEANS THEY WERE OVERPAID..SAVE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ONE!!!,1244160000,5,170,5.107142857142857
3748635,1,B001PMWLYA,"When looking at our history of reviews it becomes clear we are lovers of the art of b movies. Always willing to give any film a try for the sake of b we decided to give ""Rise of the Scarecrows"" a shot. Unfortunately this one was not for us in any sense. Being very comfortable with b films we weren't expecting much but didn't know it would be like this.

Right off the bat you know it's going to be rough when you see it's shot with a single home video camera. From the opening scene, which we think was supposed to be scary, it just gets worse and worse. The confusion is almost too much to handle as the ""plot"" is nowhere to be found. The alleged premise is a small town comes under attack by zombie scarecrows who come alive during the evening to kill the living. There is no explanation to what made them scarecrows but who cares anyway. The only reason we kept it on was to see if the mega tough Carlos would be able to save his crew from these killer scarecrows, who never show themselves once throughout the film. Unfortunately for the film's sake Carlos brings it down with some of the worst acting ever recorded.

We had previously declared ""Halloween Night"" the worst movie ever but have bumped it up to make room for this one. In no way can we recommend this to our fans. Sure we love bad movies, we just gave The Dentist 5 stars, but this is just awful. If you want a regular movie you will not like this one. However in the film's defense it is a micro-budget feature. When a director is working with no budget you have to cut them some slack. So with that said this film is not for us, but may be enjoyed in a very specific niche market. A very very specific niche.",1242345600,7,1680,4.198142414860681

But he soon comes to realize that both the local sheriff as well as the townspeople are part of a plan to lead unsuspecting out-of-towners, such as hitchhikers and people with car troubles, into the woods to get slaughtered by scarecrows.

This movie has a lot going against it, atrocious acting, slow pacing,characters that are extremely unlikable (for no good reason whatsoever), it's relatively bloodless, and the parts that try (too hard) to add humor are just cringe-worthy. I usually support independent cinema so I gave Geno McGahee a second chance to impress me after the cinematic sludge that was ""Evil Awakening"", but as mind-numbingly awful as that film was, this second attempt is actually somehow worse.",1516492800,,857,4.951388888888889
8333878,1,B001PMWLYA,it does not make sense. I thought this movie be scary.. but it turns out to be stupid. maybe who ever made this movie needs to go back to film school and learn about film making  come up with a story line,1511740800,,204,3.857142857142857

8333880,1,B001PMWLYA,"I was searching for Pumpkinhead 2. I was hoping it was free with amazon prime, but I was even willing to pay like $1.99 to rent it or whatever. When I searched Pumpkinhead, I could only rent the first one (which I own) or the fourth one. No Pumpkinhead 2 or 3 to be found. BUT ""Rise of the Scarecrows"" was advertised to me instead. The description said it was often compared to ""Pumpkinhead"" and ""Jeepers Creepers"". I was like, ""Oh man, I love Pumpkinhead. And I like Jeepers Creepers, this has got to be great.""

I was really wrong. When the film first started, I thought it was kind of like old found footage that lead to the story of what we'll be enjoying. The camera was shaky, the coloring was terrible, it looks like it was shot in the 70's, maybe? But then the camera cut. The girl hadn't even started running yet and you could tell they shouted at her to run. There were jump shots all over the place, ill placed cutting, terrible lighting and acting. I couldn't even get 10 minutes into it.

I have sat through the WORST horror movies that look like they're made in someone's backyard and this one was beyond that. I made better horror movies than this when I was 10 years old with no editing software or physical footage to work with.

I'm all for indie horror, but my god, you need just a little bit of production value.",1473033600,4,1332,4.32

8333886,1,B001PMWLYA,"Everything was bad. The quality of the video, the continuity of the audio, the acting, the script, and especially the make up, were all bad. It is the only movie I've ever seen where the entire police force was black, and that was actually cool. It annoyed me though that the sheriff kept referring to the new cop as an addition to his ""team,"" which did not exist as you only ever see the sheriff and the new recruit. It also annoyed me that after the new cop handed his badge back, he appears wearing it in the next scene. Come on, lack of continuity of story, too?",1464566400,4,566,4.25
