8443158,5,B004VBGNLO,My son loves this.,1528416000,,18,3.75
8443159,3,B004VBGNLO,"The quality is decent but it wasn't worth the money I paid. I won't be returning it, but if you're thinking about purchasing I'd just recommend watching the show on YouTube.",1521244800,,173,4.612903225806452
8443160,5,B004VBGNLO,"If you enjoy the shows live, and wish you could see them everytime you want.  Then here is your chance, yes the filming is top notch, not like some you see on youtube.  I got this for my mom for her Birthday, and she totally enjoy's it every chance she gets to watch it while she grades home work.",1393718400,2,297,4.016949152542373
8443161,1,B004VBGNLO,"Ive bought a few of these and this ones kinda bad. The audio is raw, other copies dub in the soundtrack from the cd. Also its shot from a single camera, most others are shot from multiple angles and edited. I regret the purchase.",1354838400,4,229,4.2272727272727275
8443162,4,B004VBGNLO,"This sounds excellent! I haven;t seen ""Fantasmic"" yet, except on YouTube, but I'd love to own the Dvd! I hope to get one when Amazon.com gets more copies!",1318723200,,154,4.535714285714286
8443163,5,B004VBGNLO,Both Fantasmic and World of Color come across great in this disc. We actually liked the World Of Color better on disc than at the actual attraction because you can see more on this.,1308787200,3,181,4.352941176470588
