I find this movie an eye opener for people who seem lost and need to see perspectives, in so many other ways.",1455667200,,274,4.188679245283019

7854916,3,630390887X,I have been unable to view this VHS tape to see if the tape is good so I cannot comment on that.  The timliness in which it was sent was not very good so it is now in Alaska and I am in California.  I shipped it to Alaska so that I could give it to someone as a gift and it never made it there while I was there so I am unsure how to rate the product itself.  I was a little disappointed that it took about a month for me to receive the product.,1247702400,,445,3.5670103092783507
7854917,1,630390887X,"When ever I travel I always buy Arche comics because they provide joyous laughs. Watching this movie a week ago made me realize that some comics shouldn't be made into movies. The cast mainly full of unknowns excepet for Lauren Holly. The plot revoles around the gang at their high school reunion. But where are Chuck and Dilton ? Another flaw is having the same charcters play each other when their 15 which is dumb. The film's low point comes when Jughead tries to rap. I would made this film when the gang was in high school and have them reunite at the end instead of baseing the whole film around the reunion. I'm also thankful that the feature film version that was in devolpement back in 2001 with a cast incudling Tobey Maugiure,Joshua Jackson and Christina Ricci got stuck in devlopment hell.",1206403200,,801,4.608391608391608
7854918,4,630390887X,"Yaay!  I remember this movie from when it first came out on TV and I loved it!  It's totally cheesy, but lots of fun just the same.  I had it recorded on VHS years ago, but lost the tape in a move somewhere.  I was having the worst time finding it and thought all was lost until I found out that they'd changed the name of it when it was released on video!  They've removed some of the best scenes imho, but oh well.  At least I've got most of it!  Woo hoo!  I highly reccommend this to anyone who's an Archie fan, it's lots of fun!",1144800000,2,532,3.9065420560747666
7854919,3,630390887X,"I had taped this movie years ago from TV and caused me some problem finding it. The actual title is Archie - To Riverdale and Back Again, which doesn't make sense since he elected to stay in Riverdale at the end of the movie. I loved Christopher Rich in The Charmings, and Fran Ryan in The Wizard. I'm a Picket Fences fan, so it was nice to see Lauren Holly as Betty. Of course way back when, I watched Charles Angels with David Doyle as their boss' frontman. And who could forget Sam Whipple in those ""Please don't squeeze the Charmin"" commercials? I thought they did a pretty good job updating those highschoolers into working adults, though I do think they overdid it a little with Betty. She's okay as a schoolteacher, but taking a shower in Archie's place??? And I couldn't buy Mr. Lodge endangering all those lives with a bomb. I really enjoyed the scene with Jughead and his son rapping to Sugar Sugar, but didn't dig the new Big Ethel. It's a movie I won't take seriously, but I will enjoy the silliness of it when I am in the mood for some schmaltz and nostalgia.",1122768000,5,1072,4.391959798994975

7854921,4,630390887X,"In this day and age, it seems that movies have taken a turn for the MUCH worse. They contain for the most parts all effects and no story, absurd amounts of violence, vile, offensive, and insulting low comedy, or they center around trite issues that wore thin a long time ago. Well, this movie ""Archie Return to Riverdale"" was a VERY PLEASANT surprise. It starts normal enough with the gang Archie, Regi, Veronica, Betty, and Jughead attending a class reunion. Before we are hit with the main plot, we are allowed to meet the characters. (Even though we may already know them to some extent). We are then exposed to different plots. (Archie struggling between his divided feelings for his fiance Pam, Veronica, and Betty.) We also get to see Jughead fighting to win his son's affection and trying to avoid the danger of Big Ethel. We are then exposed to the main plot. (Regi planning to close the icecream shop they shared so many wonderful times in.) In a frustrated way, I find it hilarious that so many movies these days desperately try to keep the audience captivated with non stop ridiculous violence that is sickly glorified in, numerous obscenities, monotonous special effects, etc. And yet, this movie is able to hold interest with some ordinary human struggles and some people trying to save an icecream shop that is dear to them! There is delightful humor that is head and shoulders above the vulgar and offensive slapstick so prevalent today. Also, it seems these days that Hollywood  can only create 2 D villains that the audience is lead to 'boo.' Well, this movie breaks the rut! Regi is the antagonist, and his actions are reprehensible. BUT, we are not permitted to forget that he is one of the gang. And rather than hoping for him to get beaten up or worse, we hope that he will mend his ways. EXCELLENT! There is a hilarious court room scene where we see the different memebers of the gang argue in a way that shows how close they are. The dispute over Archie between Betty and Veronica is also well done. There is something very powerful about the moment where despite the different conflicts the gang is still going through, they all go on stage together for their band reunion. I don't want to ruin the end for those of you who haven't seen it, but I can say it contains humor and beauty. Better movies like Peter O Toole's ""Lion in the Winter,"" Frank Langella's ""Dracula,"" and Liam Neeson's ""Ethan Frome"" certainly exist. But this movie shows that excess violence that is glorified in, obsenities, 2 D good guys and bad guys, overdone special effects, trite worn thin issues, offensive and insulting humor, ARE NOT the ingrediants for a good movie.",1021593600,6,2669,4.678723404255319
7854922,5,630390887X,"This was a very neat movie!  Everyone was in charector except Mr. Lodge and somewhat, Jughead.  All in all it was a great movie I think!  I've been reading Archie comics for years and I wasn't very disapointed!  The only problem is it doesnt stick to typical wholesome Archie culture, however by today's standards it's very very tame!  Yes, so buy it, Archie rules!",1001462400,2,365,4.640625
