3762685,5,B001Q59U04,"After ordering the dvd two movie collection, BREAKIN and BREAKIN 2:ELECTRIC BOOGALOO; she enjoyed watching the movies, however during those years I actually like R & B music, and I still could not understand how the young people in those two movies could twist and turn their bodies, to dance in such a way. Times of dancing certainly has changed, then again the two movies I still enjoyed watching with my youngest daughter.",1315180800,2,425,4.835616438356165

At that age (8)you can enjoy the movies with out worring about things like plot points. These are not Oscar calibur movies, but they are feel good movies, that if you don't try to take them seriously They really are a lot of fun to watch. I watched this with my own kids and now they love it too.",1306195200,2,389,3.814814814814815
3762687,5,B001Q59U04,"One day I asked my husband if he had ever watched 'Electric Boogaloo' when he was younger.  He got a weird look on his face and asked 'what is that?'  So, I came on Amazon.com to search for DVD.  Sure enough I found what I was looking for.  It was exactly as I remembered it when I was younger.  Except, now even funnier because of the style of clothes they wore and the low budget filming.  None the less, I am super glad I found the DVD.  This was a double DVD pack, and I don't remember watching the first 'Breakin', so I was glad it also was included with the purchase.",1293926400,8,573,4.0625

3762739,4,B001Q59U04,"This is truly a wonder of modern science. Two movies on one disc!  Now I only have to look for one disc instead of two when I lose it. Think of the time saved. Now I can watch Lucinda with my shorts down instead of searching under the sofa, knocking away old Cheetos. The second movie has more lovely ladies providing an extra bonus of shorts down action. Overall, I was sad they didn't make a part 3, but I suppose I can watch something else with similar action. My taste in movies varies. I like the music in the first one cause I have the cd. Don't know if part 2 has a cd. Cause I listen to music on CDs and records. A guy at work played me an MP3, but I didn't care for it. It was a long time ago so it might be better know. I have to go, my mom is yelling. The cats got out of the basement and they are making love behind the sofa. Thank you",1458000000,,847,3.84

3762757,4,B001Q59U04,"A guilty pleasure movie that comes nowhere close to standing up to the test of time but does act like a nostalgia baseball bat to the head.  Decent transfer, little to no extras but it's a fun, campy watch that is just prime for a good drinking game in it's honor.  Just remember, though, it has 2x the poppin', 2x the lockin' - For me I find that I can never get enough poppin', but a little lockin' goes a long way and I would have dialed it back to about 1.5x.  Twice the lockin' just felt like overkill.",1443744000,3,507,4.101010101010101
3762758,4,B001Q59U04,"Picture and sound is GREAT!!  The bonus features are good.  Two movies on one disc at a low price cant beat that!!  Would recommend.

The only reason I am giving this 4 star out of 5 is because these movies are not presented in their original aspect ratio.  The original movies aspect ratio is 4:3 with the black on the sides.  Shout zoomed in on the picture to give it a 16:9 look but this crops the image on the top and bottom.  Is that a big deal?  maybe to some.  I wish there was an option on the bluray to view these movies in their original aspect ratio or zoom to 16:9.",1443571200,3,577,4.035398230088496

3762764,5,B001Q59U04,I remember watching Breakin' when I was 4 years old. Me and my father love this movie and have watched it so many times and still are not sick of it. Watching these people dance is absolutely amazing. Breakin' 2 is not as good as the original but the dancing is so awesome. I am very happy that these movies are on Blu ray and still look great after all these years.

3762775,5,B001Q59U04,"Shout Factory has paired up the 1984 cult classics ""Breakin'"" & ""Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo"" as a fun double feature bluray for connoisseurs of 80's cinema. I was only 9 at the time of these film's original releases so watching these two films after many years is definitely nostalgic to the extreme. The first film was released in May 1984 and was a worldwide smash hit grossing over 50 times its small budget. It capitalized on a hot new dance craze called breakdancing. While not a great film by any means, it has a lot of positive energy and decent performances that overcome a half baked script. Surprised by the film's big success a sequel was rushed into production and came out 7 months later as Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo to much less fanfare and box office. I actually enjoy the sequel more as it has a lot more dance numbers in it and an infectious and goofy sensibility which makes it the one most people will return to more often.

This release presents both films on a dual layer bluray and they look better than they ever have. Detail is considerably improved over the DVD releases and the 80's colors are bright and pop off the screen. It appears no digital scrubbing occurred so both films retain a nice grain structure that gives the visual proceedings a wonderful filmic touch. I spotted no compression artifacts either. Breakin' is presented in 1.85:1 widescreen and the sequel is opened up a bit to 1.78:1. Audio is in lossless 2 channel stereo and sounds great. As far as extras go, the first film gets only a trailer but the sequel gets some featurettes on hip hop culture from the original DVD release and a highly entertaining brand new audio commentary track featuring the director, editor and one of the main actors. English subtitles are available for the hearing impaired.

Your enjoyment of these films will vary depending on your appreciation of mid 80's culture and style. They are definite time capsules of a bygone hip hop & dance era which was fun while it lasted. For people like myself who lived through this time period, it will be a fun and nostalgic walk down memory lane. Shout Factory did a fantastic job on both of the films' bluray debut that fans should pick up without hesitation.",1430265600,14,2232,4.66243654822335

I was big into breakdancing in the mid 80's and I can still remember going to both of these at the theater with my middle school buddies.  It sure brought back a lot of memories.
