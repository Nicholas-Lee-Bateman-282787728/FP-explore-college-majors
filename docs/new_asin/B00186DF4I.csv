3411799,5,B00186DF4I,"Love it because the grand kids love it.  When they are happy, so am I.  We are collecting all the Tom and Jerry DVDs because this is what the grand kids like and they never tire of seeing them over and over.",1362873600,,207,3.9047619047619047
3411800,4,B00186DF4I,"A few months ago, I bought a collection of old Tom and Jerry Cartoons, the type that used to be shown in theaters, with the idea that my little four-year-old boy might get a kick out of them. Well, they certainly caught his attention and he was laughing here and there. But, you know, these features were meant for movie audiences ranging from kids right through adults and some of the humor seemed a bit remote for my boy's age.

Next, I found a DVD of the Tom and Jerry Tales, cartoons derived from a kid's TV program. He liked these too. They really hold him to watching and he seems highly amused. So, this past week I bought a second DVD, Tom and Jerry Tales, Volume 5."" I found it on the Wal-Mart five dollar rack. It was billed as Tom and Jerry action on surfboards, skateboards, dirt bikes and so on. Even Bigfoot made an appearance. Droopy costarred in one of the episodes. Well, the boy really liked them and found them interesting and highly amusing. One thing I didn't care for is the long breaks between some of the episodes. Evidently they represent the end of one TV episode and the beginning of another. In my opinion, the DVD would have been much better if they had been edited out.

In any case, these Tom and Jerry Tales are good stuff for kids. But actually, I think my boy gets a bigger kick out of the original Tom and Jerry movie cartoons.

3411803,5,B00186DF4I,"My boys 4 and 2.5 LOVE this. They'd watch it 10 times a day if I let them. The thing I love most about Tom and Jerry is that its the only show that they actually crack up laughing at throughout. My husband and I love to watch them laugh. All these DVDs are so worth the price, which is cheap!",1316908800,2,292,3.80327868852459

3411807,4,B00186DF4I,"As I said in my review for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tom-and-Jerry-Tales-Vol-1/dp/B000G73UPE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tom and Jerry Tales, Vol. 1</a>, I am impressed with how faithful TOM AND JERRY TALES is to the classic MGM T & J shorts.  Vol. 5 continues the tradition with another dozen fast and funny cartoons.

I've always been a big fan of Halloween and/or ""spooky""-themed cartoons, and there's a trio included here.  The best of these is ""Monster Con"", in which Tom faces off with a Van Helsing-inspired monster hunter.  The inimitable Droopy co-stars in ""A Life Less Guarded.""  There's also an extreme sports theme running throughout the collection, as the classic cat and mouse team compete in skateboarding, cycling and tennis.

TOM AND JERRY TALES offers plenty of action (with mild animated violence, if that sort of thing concerns you) to keep younger kids interested, and enough comic antics to appeal to the kids in us all.  I recommend getting them all.",1219190400,12,1021,5.590909090909091
