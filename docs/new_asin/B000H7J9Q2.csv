2630341,3,B000H7J9Q2,Kevin Hart is one of my favorite comedians and I have a few DVDs of his. But this one was not as good as the others and it was because of the club it was recorded in. It was a small club and the audience talked through most of Kevin's routine.,1276646400,7,243,3.784313725490196
2630342,1,B000H7J9Q2,"Kevin Hart is one of the funniest and most charismatic comedians out there today, but you'll never get through this one because the audio quality is so subpar. It's almost like it was shot on somebody's VHS-C camcorder and released as an afterthought.  It was filmed at the LAFF HOUSE in Philly, my hometown, so I'm reluctant to come off as a hater but save your money.  But Kevin tells a lot of the same jokes on his Comedy Central special, which isn't yet on DVD (TiVo it).  And he comes off much, much better on his GROWN LITTLE MAN DVD from Image.",1254787200,8,551,4.330097087378641
2630343,2,B000H7J9Q2,"Kevin is funny but this dvd is not...  The audio is so bad it's as if someone was filming on the ""qt"" from the audience and didn't want to get caught.  Unfortunately, I got caught spending the money for this tinny, indiscernible, subpar, and unprofessional dvd...  Amazon should remove it from listing...  Sorry, but its really that bad...",1231632000,15,339,4.793103448275862
2630344,5,B000H7J9Q2,the movie wAS OF THE CHAIN. WAY BETTER THAN DAVE CHAPELLE STANDUP AND MIKE EPPES STANDUP,1208390400,,88,4.5625
2630345,4,B000H7J9Q2,It was so funny! I would rate five stars But my first impression when it began was that it was very very very poor quality. The audio is terrible I can hear too much of the audience. The camera man is also terrible the frame is zoomed too close up. It looks like a bootleg DVD even though I bought it at Walmart... I still recommend it if you want to laugh but don't mind bad quality recording,1442707200,,393,4.051282051282051

2630350,2,B000H7J9Q2,I love Kevin Hart but this DVD isn't the best to get because what Kevin does here he does on his other DVD's  & the sound quality is much better on them then on this DVD.,1378166400,,170,3.7222222222222223

2630354,5,B000H7J9Q2,"I have seen several Kevin Hart specials and this one, as is true with the others, did not disappoint in the slightest. A very raunchy sense of humor but generally hilarious for the more innocent of us. Great fun for all, not quite family friendly though.",1329696000,,254,4.543478260869565
