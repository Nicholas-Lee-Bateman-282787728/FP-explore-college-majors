8172188,5,B000MTHWK0,"It's obvious that neither the German cast & director nor the American voice actors took this movie seriously. You've got pink blood, one-liners from other movies, a white guy voiced by a black guy, another white guy who sounds like Egor on helium, over the top gore you can't help but laugh at, unconvincing zombies, a guy running through a public area with with a chainsaw, watermelon & marshmallow body physics, & so much more to laugh at.",1293667200,,441,4.666666666666667
8172189,4,B000MTHWK0,"This movie is actually a bonus on the Zombie Doom DVD! How cool is that? It's an extremely low budget movie (probably didn't cost more than 50$ lol), it's very amateurish and it doesn't really have plot (a plane carrying chemicals crashes in a forest, dead people come back to life and kill random people), but it's pretty entertaining, the acting is so bad that it's funny, the dubbing is so terrible that it's hilarious (I'm sure that it was intentional) and it has A LOT of nice gore! The effects don't look anywhere near as good as the effects in Zombie Doom, but some look good for the budget! For gore fans only (people who are intelligent enough to not take low-budget gory movies that are all about entertainment and gore seriously).",1259280000,,741,4.578947368421052
8172190,3,B000MTHWK0,"If you're truly serious about your blood and gore, you absolutely must take at least one pilgrimage to the gruesome abode of German filmmaker Andreas Schnaas.  This guy is in a league all by himself, so you have to throw away your reviewing guidelines when tackling any of his ""gore for gore's sake"" efforts.  I gave his film Zombie Doom five enthusiastic stars, for example, even though it's a laughably bad film in every conceivable way - it's a gorehound's dream come true.  Sadly, Zombie 90: Extreme Pestilence is a far cry from Schnaas at his best.  I found myself extremely bored halfway through the thing.  It's just the same zombie attacks over and over again.  Where's the passion?  Where's the drive to surpass the goriest scenes you've produced in the past?  Frankly, Schnaas just didn't seem to have his cold, black heart into this cinematic effort.

I suppose you'll want to know what the story here is - unless, of course, you're already familiar with Schnaas, in which case you'll know that an actual story oftentimes just gets in Schnaas' way, which may be why he pretty much eschews any kind of sustainable plot.  In this film, a plane carrying some kind of secret chemical weapon crashes somewhere out in the German countryside, giving rise to a local epidemic of zombie-ism.  Two doctors try to put an end to the growing menace.  That's it in a nutshell.  It's all just an excuse for Schnaas to indulge his sickeningly disgusting zombie fantasies.

Film critics beware, for Zombie '90 epitomizes the worst in every facet of filmmaking.  I've already mentioned the ludicrous story, which is just an excuse to serve up a gorefest.  Then there's the acting, which ranges between atrocious and nonexistent altogether.  If you put on a blindfold and just cut and spliced the original film randomly, your editing would surpass that of Schnaas' crew a hundredfold.  Every single scene in this film is obviously the product of one take only.  After all, when you're working with a cheap video camera and no budget to speak of, you have to cut corners.  The low budget proof reveals itself incontrovertibly in the special effects, which are far from impressive.  Yes, Schnaas throws most of his trademarks moves into the mix (decapitations, massive bodily dismemberment by chainsaw, gunshot wounds, the clawing open of human chest cavities, a steady zombie diet of exposed intestines, removal of sexual organs from living humans, and buckets and buckets of blood, etc.), but Schnaas never seems to really push the envelope here.  We just keep seeing the same types of zombie attacks over and over again, which means that Schnaas violated his own standards by settling for the mundane - and that is why I cannot rate Zombie 90 very highly at all.

The dubbing of the film deserves a paragraph all its own.  It may very well be the worst dubbing of all time, but as such it makes Zombie 90 more than bearable to sit through.  If I didn't know better, I would think a couple of 15-year-old kids somehow got their hands on the film, recorded their own dub of the film, and then sent it on its way.  It is simply hilarious at times.  One of the German doctors sounds like Harvey Fierstein on helium, while the other one (and remember, this is a big German white guy) sounds like some kind of ghetto banger straight out of 1970s Harlem.  The incongruence of these voices with the actors on the screen is absolutely ludicrous - but also hilarious.  The fact that the guys doing the dubbing seemingly make up every piece of the dialogue as the film progresses only adds to the comic effect.

Overall, though, this gore-loving reviewer found himself pretty darn disappointed with this entire project.  Clearly, Zombie '90: Extreme Pestilence is a far cry from Schnaas' best.  I never thought I'd say that a Schnaas film wasn't gory enough, but that's pretty much what I'm saying here.  Unless you're an uber-fan of this infamous German filmmaker or a tried and true lover of extreme horror in general, you'll probably want to give this one a pass.  The hilarious English dubbing is about the only thing that makes this film worth watching.",1187568000,2,4140,4.768258426966292
