These DVD's are not the ones you watch and then put away. I can't stop watching them! They are a thrill ride from start to finish! Because of this Discovery series, I've got to go storm chasing this May! I promise, you won't be disappointed!",1301270400,,415,4.402597402597403
4099958,5,B003A86D3C,"This DVD set covers the third season (2009) of the Discovery Channel's ""Storm Chasers"" series.  Meteorologist Reed Timmer and filmmaker Sean Casey return along with new cast member Tim Samaras to try to get scientific data from tornadoes by chasing the storms across Oklahoma, Kansas, and other locations in Tornado Alley.  There are the inevitable clashes and conflicts over chasing methods, and while the teams do have their rough, unsuccessful days, some of them also had great successes in the '09 season.  If you enjoyed the first two seasons of this series, you will enjoy this one as well.

In addition to all eight episodes of the ""Storm Chasers"" season, the DVD set contains bonus material--deleted ""Storm Chasers"" scenes and a preview episode of ""Against The Elements"", which shows tornado footage from South Dakota and a flood situation in the Pacific Northwest.",1270080000,4,873,5.126760563380282

4099983,5,B003A86D3C,"It was interesting to see the late Tim Samaras at work, although he was more often a little too cautious for his team mates from time to time. Thanks in part to the new radar device he had installed Still, he was the most level headed of all that were showcased and the great respect they had for him was not lost. Reed's clashes with his team mates often proved annoying and it was easy to see that it was hard for him to hold back on what he might have wanted to say to Sean whenever they met, but couldn't because they were being filmed on national TV. As for Sean, his sullen, snarky attitude was both amusing and annoying, both toward Reed, who he felt usurped his idea for the TIV and Josh, who tended to dismiss him altogether whenever possible. He also clashed with his own team whenever they tried to point him in the proper direction, only to have him nix whatever they suggested.",1406419200,,890,4.303571428571429

4100016,2,B003A86D3C,This entire show jumped the shark when they started including the personal drama.  The first couple of seasons were great but as I'm viewing the third season I remember why I stopped watching when they originally aired.  In addition I don't buy the idea that these great scientist have altruistic motives behind their research.  They all are obviously in it for the thrill of storm chasing and beyond that seem to be motivated by ego.  They definitely know their sales pitch though.,1383868800,,482,4.841463414634147

4100020,2,B003A86D3C,"I found it hard to take these guys seriously with all the joking around, the drama and the ""faux"" competition with the other team. I thought this was serious stormchasing when I decided to watch it.",1374019200,,198,4.527777777777778

4100023,5,B003A86D3C,Why did they cancel it?  It is a wonderful show!  I highly recommend watching it!  You won't regret watching it ever!,1370044800,,117,4.476190476190476
4100024,4,B003A86D3C,I thought this show was interesting to watch. I learned some things I didn't know about tornados. It made me more aware of why some people chase.,1367280000,,145,4.407407407407407
4100035,5,B003A86D3C,Awesome experience! Very intense footage. Recommend for anyone who is fascinated by tornadoes. Don't know why they cancelled after season 5. :(,1364688000,,143,5.545454545454546
4100036,5,B003A86D3C,Season 3 of Storm Chasers is my favorite of them all. Just a great show and always fun and exciting to watch. I have started buying the seasons for my storm loving nephew too.,1363824000,,175,4.176470588235294
4100037,4,B003A86D3C,Interesting look at tornado chasing - without having to risk your life!  I watched some of the seasons when it was on Discovery Channel and I'm sorry they canceled the show,1362614400,,172,4.548387096774194
4100038,1,B003A86D3C,"I got this for my son who is fasinated with storms. This DVD shows more footage of a bunch of guys getting lost and bickering than storm footage. If you are looking for a reality show then this is for you. If you are looking for a documentary on storms, then don't waste your money on this one.",1356480000,,294,4.086206896551724
4100039,5,B003A86D3C,I purchased the entire series of these DVD's; each of the 5 seasons. I enjoy them - informative and fast action. I am a weather buff so I do enjoy the weather information you learn when watching these DVDs.,1349222400,,206,4.3076923076923075
4100040,4,B003A86D3C,"Little confused about the seasons here. Netflix is running 3 seasons on their site. Season 3 is actually season 2 on that. Season 2 is season 1. Season 3 is what is being sold as season 4 on Amazon. Could someone enlighten me as to which season is what? Overall, the series is excellent and the DVD's are very well done. I would just like to know which season is which.",1335571200,2,369,4.211267605633803
4100041,4,B003A86D3C,"I recently purchased ""Storm Chasers Season 3"" DVDs here since I had seasons 1 & 2 already on DVDs, I figured I would go ahead and get season 3 at this time.
Kind of hard to review a DVD or video cassette of a show, but my personal opinion says that the season 3 set of this ""Storm Chasers"" shows is overall not bad. Of course, there is quite a bit of tornado video clips and plenty of action. The super professionals on the prior seasons 1 & 2 were not on the third season however and that sort of disapointed me somewhat, but overall, it's still a good DVD and if you're a storm or tornado chaser and like to see chasers get pretty close to tornadoes, then I would get this video. It comes on 2 DVD's and lasts several hours long. Overall, 4 out of 5 stars for me on this item.",1329955200,,778,4.025806451612903
4100042,5,B003A86D3C,"Season 3 takes place during the 2009 Tornado season. It introduces Tim Samaras and his Twistex team to the cast that already included Sean Casey and the TIV and Reed Timmer and TVN. Starting in Season 3 Reed starts driving into tornadoes as he invests in an armored vehicle similar to the TIV which he calls the Dominator. Sean Casey finally gets ""the Shot"", Reed intercepts multiple tornadoes and Tim Samaras' team gets multiple intercepts as well. I would put this season ahead of the rest because of its production value. This season, along with Season 2, is narrated by Harry Prichett. He did a fantastic job narrating this show but for some reason no one narrates season 4 and he doesn't return to narrate Season 5. This is also a better copy to buy. The DiscoveryStore version is almost 50 dollars here on Amazon and its 30 on the DiscoveryStore. This version is way more affordable and it includes the same 8 episodes from season three.",1326585600,3,943,4.652694610778443
4100043,5,B003A86D3C,"My son is 6 and LOVES ""Storm Chasers""!!  These are more for kids that are intrested in Storms. Adults will love watching ""Storm Chasers"".",1317686400,,137,4.708333333333333
4100044,5,B003A86D3C,"This has to be one of the best shows on TV. It is filmed and narrated to perfection and is accompanied by incredible footage of incredible and powerful storms. This season follows 3 chasers and their teams: Sean Casey who built the TIV(Tornado Intercept Vehicle) with the intent of getting inside of a tornado and recording the footage with an IMAX camera to complete his film, Reed Timmer who in this Season customizes his vehicle in a similar way to Seans allowing him to get closer than ever to tornados and Tim Samaras whose team records data and some amazing footage as well. In this season there is some tension between Reed and Sean mostly because Sean doesn't like that Reed somewhat copied his armored vehicle idea and because Reed tends to have better luck than Sean and his team. Dr. Josh Wurman's Vortex team also appears in this season and guides Sean and his team to tornados with their Radar Truck. Not to spoil the season but Sean finally gets the shot he needs as the TIV gets inside of a Tornado in Wyoming. Overall this is a great show and this is probably the best season of Storm Chasers.",1313452800,3,1109,4.522388059701493
