8330530,5,B001OD6HI6,"As a period drama, this film raised the bar. As history, it is a valuable insight into the penal colony of Van Diemen's Land and the sheer brutality of the place. The performances are uniformly strong, the script excellent and the story is almost beyond comprehension. Every school kid in Australia should watch this film to better understand who we really are.",1312761600,,361,4.838709677419355
