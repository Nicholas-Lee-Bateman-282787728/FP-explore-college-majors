If you're too young to remember this 70s favorite, you need to watch.  This series singlehandedly changed the face of emergency medicine by showing the U.S. how paramedics made a difference.  The series inspired thousands to become firefighters, paramedics, nurses, and doctors.  The paramedic program was, within one year, at least 20 years ahead of what it would've been without it.  As the prior reviewer said, Universal, you rock!  Now, let's get cracking on the other seasons' episodes.",1117756800,85,647,4.836363636363636
2319781,5,B0009UC80G,"Is how the brilliant genius Jack Webb promoted Emergency!  The first show that showed the importance of paramedics, and what happens to the patients in the hospital.

2319988,5,B0009UC80G,"This dvd is from a different company that the others available for purchase.  The other ones are from the same company that, unfortunately, got rights to LARAMIE and made a total waste of those dvds.  These season 1 stories are exciting and lots more Robert Fuller than in later years.  The biggest plus is the extra scenes.  They aren't numerous or extensive, but for a fan they are very much appreciated!  Also, the final two episodes have cameo appearances by John Smith (Slim in LARAMIE).  I am hoping this company finishes out the series so I can purchase seasons 2-6.  (Seasons 7 and 8 were a complete waste, IMHO.)",1495843200,2,621,4.6422018348623855

2319996,5,B0009UC80G,"""Emergency!"" was my favorite television show as a young boy. I was fascinated by the action and the quick decisions the cast made and how cool they were under pressure. I hadn't seen the series in several decades, but recently watched season one (plus the two hour pilot ""The Wedsworth-Townsend Act"", which is maybe the most boring title for an exciting show ever) on DVD. Some things aren't as good as you remember from childhood, but this was. I was really pleased with how well the show holds up today and thoroughly enjoyed it. I enjoyed it so much that I got the entire series in a box set. It's true that the chemistry of the cast gelled better in later seasons, likewise, it's also true there are a few pieces of overacted melodrama on display here (mostly from guest stars and actors with bit parts), but it's a real gem that's still a pleasure to watch. This show really helped promote paramedic and EMS programs in their formative years, and that's a public service of the highest order that few shows can hope to compare to.

The DVD set opens with ""The Wedsworth-Townsend Act"", the two hour pilot directed (and produced) by the famous Jack Webb; I loved that the opening episode featured appearances from Martin Milner and Kent McCord in their ""Adam-12"" characters (I also loved the subplot about ""Adam-12"", another Webb production, later in the season), and immediately set about establishing who the characters were, what the interpersonal dynamics between them are, and what the equipment does as Johnny Gage (Randolph Mantooth) gets recruited for the new paramedic program by instructor Roy DeSoto. The hospital heavies are also fleshed out, starting with the domineering and somewhat arrogant Dr. Kelly Brackett (Robert Fuller), the easygoing Dr. Joe Early (Bobby Troup), and Troup's real life wife (and Jack Webb's ex-wife!) nurse Dixie McCall (Julie London), the calm foundation of Rampart Hospital. There's some legislative drama and a major emergency at the end which requires Brackett to make a timely decision he is really conflicted about, but it works well. The pilot is a bit slow compared to the later shows, but it firms up Roy and Johnny as a dedicated team in the brand new Station 51.

The 11 episodes of the first season are all good and involve three or four emergencies per episode and a lot of interpersonal character development that gets better as the show progresses (I love the little snippets of characterization that run through the series: Johnny's obsession with practical jokes; Roy being a terrible cook, Johnny's invention of a new type of poker game, etc.) From a perspective four decades later, some things will really pop out at you: cigarettes being smoked in hospital hallways, no HIPAA considerations whatsoever, buying groceries for the entire fire station for $9.03, etc., but the risk and drama still play as well as they did in 1972.

If you liked ""Emergency!"" when it was on television, give it another look; I think you'll be thrilled with how it stands up today; if you have never seen the show, this is a great place to start and I recommend the set highly.",1485820800,4,3117,4.833333333333333

It is a wonderful introduction to the lives of fireman and even hospital staff such as Rampart.  There is nothing graphic in these: no needle shots, no buckets of blood.  The injuries are very understated and the focus is on the job and situations.  It is a bit stunning how far medical response has come in only 40 years; but this is still a kid friendly introduction to live action firefighters and paramedics.",1458518400,2,522,4.6923076923076925

The episode that froze a lot on me was the second side of the first disk, Brush Fire, I just watched that one and it worked perfectly.  I will watch the entire disk however and if it does it anywhere on the season I will return it, BUT so far so good. I will give it a 5 star for now and write a note on here if it is bad or good when I complete the season for you all to know.",1435968000,2,748,3.7044025157232703

Although paramedics are commonplace in today's world, the concept was just starting to catch on when this show debuted.  In fact this show is believed to have been responsible for starting more paramedic careers than any other factor.  Unlike previous Jack Webb Productions, these episodes filled a 1 hour timeslot which went by quickly thanks to the amount of accidents, mishaps and mayhem that was constantly on-screen.  In between all this was the often comical good-natured interaction between the paramedics, the firefighters and the local hospital staff that assisted them via radio when medical supervision was necessary.  The show was popular enough that it spawned a Saturday morning cartoon (Emergency +4) and several TV-movies after its initial run.  Very well done.",1402012800,,853,5.37593984962406

I have NO problems with the disc's of Season 1 - everything plays just fine. Ordered through Amazon and everything arrived in great shape and on time!!

The main reason I watch it is one Randolph Mantooth aka Fireman Johnny Gage, who is too hot for words.  I just can't get enough of him haha.  The acting is not great usually; they had some good guest stars occasionally.  The characters aren't all that interesting.  Still, it was a good show and certainly it was on the air for long enough.  I was kind of annoyed by the price though, for the entire series.  At $150+, I find that too high, especially since this series was on in the 70s and was never even immensely popular I don't think.

2320819,4,B0009UC80G,"EMERGENCY was a Universal distribution Created and produced by TV legend Jack Webb(Sgt. Joe Friday) on DRAGNET, that delivered a double dose of medical drama and real-life action into its stories, which made it a major favorite among viewers during its 1972-77 run on NBC.

When EMERGENCY debuted on NBC in the Winter of 1972, this abbreviated season set compiles the first 11 episodes of the program, in which LA County paramedics Johnny Gage (Randolph Mantooth) and Roy De Soto (Kevin Tighe) tackle crises both big and small, from plane accidents (""Crash,"" ""Dealer's Wild"") and baby deliveries (""Brushfire"") to the rescue of a horse in a ditch (""Publicity Hound"").

Ably assisting the men in the field are the emergency room hospital staff, led by Dr. Joe Early (Bobby Troup, the composer of ""Route 66""), Dr. Kelly Brackett (Robert Fuller of Laramie), and Nurse Dixie McCall (singer Julie London); Deirdre Hall famous from DAYS OF OUR LIVES also appeared (in this season only) as Nurse Sally Lewis.

An energetic and entertaining series, the success of EMERGENCY not only spawned a host of promotional tie-ins (and a Saturday morning cartoon), but also helped spark attention for and interest in paramedic work during its network run, which is a considerable legacy for any television program.

Though no extras are included in EMERGENCY's 1st Season double-disc set, the 1972 two-part pilot, ""The Wedsworth-Townsend Affair,"" is included; directed by Jack Webb, the pilot also features guest appearances by veteran Los Angeles police Officer Pete Malloy(Martin Milner) and his hotshot rookie partner, Officer Jim Reed(Kent McCord)from ADAM-12 where the cast collide.

This primetime reality"" show based on true-to-life events shows how paramedics and medical personnel save lives with split-second decisions and actions. Includes 11 episodes on 2 DVDs along with the fact that it's better being able to watch each episode complete & uncut as opposed to how they were shown on Me-TV, TV Land, and now Cozi-TV with lots of deleted scenes & added commercials.",1389139200,3,2058,5.224242424242425

The show as a whole is a fine example of what TV was when it was all about making entertainment.

its amazing how we take for granted our current 911 and paramedic system and it's something that our parents never had. There was time when there was no infrastructure and I remember this show as being one of the first places where the 'Jaws of Life' were shown off to the general public.  Just in watching the show you can see rescue and medical technology evolve.

The first season has some great episodes, especially the pilot episode (which was actually a television movie). Another reviewer pointed out they cannot show the pilot movie on tv nowadays for whatever reason, but I do remember them showing the pilot once in a while back in the 1970's. It is an easy episode to remember because it's the one where Johnny started out with Fire Station 10. There is really not a bad episode for all of season one.

I highly recommend this dvd set along with season two. I haven't bought the dvd set for season three yet, but another reviewer pointed out that either the intro music and/or the end theme has been altered for season three. I find that very interesting because I own several season three episodes released by Columbia House RE-TV, VHS version, and those contain the UNALTERED ORIGINAL season three music themes and credits. Meanwhile, I do own the dvd set for season four. Great episodes, but beware: season four has some major dvd sound transfer/remastering problems.

Dr. Kelly Brackett (Robert Fuller), the brilliant but sometimes abrasive head of the Emergency Department at LA's Rampart Hospital, is dubious about the idea of non-medical personnel doing doctorish things--not out of any concern for his job, but because he fears the injured may be put in more danger than they already are; head nurse Dixie McCall (Julie London) is all for the idea; and easygoing neurosurgeon Joe Early (Bobby Troup, who was married to London in real life) is willing to just go with the flow.  The double-length pilot episode of this Jack Webb series follows their developing attitudes and the fate of the bill, and the remaining episodes show the firemen and hospital personnel in action.  Like all Webb series, this one is episodic: each segment features several rescues, at least one of which is usually major (the rescue is difficult or dangerous, the doctors are baffled, or the patient is in imminent peril) while another has humorous aspects, and attention is paid to the off-duty life of the principal characters as well.  Baby boomers will enjoy this look back at the roots of a now-ubiquitous institution (""the paramedics""), and their kids may be intrigued by a glimpse into life in a day when cell phones and VCR's didn't yet exist, nurses still wore white uniforms and funny caps, most professions were still dominated by men, and fashions included Afro haircuts and wild prints.  Various well-known names such as Royal Dano, Jeanette Nolan, and others turn up as patients.  This was a favorite series of mine throughout its six-year run and I was delighted at the chance to acquire it on disc.  And despite the material aspects of its look, one thing hasn't changed: the reality of disaster and the necessity for trained people to meet it.",1305504000,,2353,5.046391752577319

Yes, this was a groundbreaking realistic television show, and there are all sorts of groups I'd like to recommend it to, however the actual production quality of these DVDs is dismal.  Being overeager, I ordered multiple seasons, and they all suffer from remarkably poor production quality. These discs come dirty, marked, and defective, even though new, with lots of hang up time, pixillation errors, the discs stall and jam, and returning them for exchange is a big waste of time because you will get replacements with the same problems, or even worse.

The DVD is much clearer, better quality audio, and better quality color. It's like watching an entirely different show - it's that much better. Given that this TV show spawned an interest in the EMT/paramedic programs that have become common place today it's a must see for those who provide emergency services.",1271894400,4,608,4.8

It has to be dramatized to tell the story. You can't see the actors if the smoke is real, so it has to be simulated, but the action of the paramedics is nearly ""true to life."" A lot of our own firemen were featured in the series.

Our Fire Chief, and our P.I.O., Dick Friend, saw to it that it was as near to 'real' life as possible. The driver of E-51, was a real fireman.

Being a fireman, (now firefighter,) is about the most fun one can have, and still remain clothed. The practical jokes that were played are real, the friendships are real, the ""love of the job,"" and the personal bonds that were forged, remain forever.

2321278,3,B0009UC80G,"It is a great pleasure to see this series brought to DVD.  I loved it when it was on NBC in the 1970s, and again in syndication.  It hasn't been seen much in the last 20 years and the TV version was changed for syndication.  I was really looking forward to experiencing the show as I knew it in the 1970s.

The quality of the transfer was excellent, and it was a great pleasure to see the original show opening credits again which were cut off for syndication in the 1980s.  I much prefer the original opens since they include that great Emergency! theme music by Nelson Riddle (the same guy who did the classic 1960s ""Batman"" series theme).

The organization of the DVD left a great deal to be desired.  There is a total lack of extra features.  Chapter breaks skip the show open, the opening and closing credits, and the last commercial break.  Universal included the current Universal movie logo at the beginning of each show, which got really annoying after the second episode and irked me because that was not the logo for Universal at the time the show was created.  Universal also spent the time and money to cut off the Universal Television logo, which for anyone who enjoyed that wonderful Nelson Riddle end credit music will miss since the Mark VII Ltd & Universal TV logos were such an integral part of the show music on the 1970s Universal shows.  Now they are gone, not to be enjoyed by the current generation.  This has been common across the current crop of Universal TV DVD releases and has been the greatest disappointment.  Shame on you, Universal.

In short, a mixed result.  Its great to see such a classic show on DVD.  However, the hamfisted handling of the DVD authoring and the silly exclusion of the Universal TV logo and the overbearing use of the current Universal movie logo make me believe the people who made the creative decisions for these discs were more interested in impressing their corporate masters than giving the viewer the original experience we had when the show was on NBC.

That said, this is a REAL TRIP! I enjoyed seeing the premier movie, and I also was quite amused to discover that Dr. Joe Earley was once a resident under Dr. Kelly Brackett - an amazing feat since Joe is at least fifteen years older than Kelly!

I watched this show when I was young and loved it.  I still love it.  It was a ground breaking show and many of the episodes and rescues were based on actual emergencies.

There is an African American doctor (Mike) who learned about prejudice in a different way - some boys came in the ER who looked like hippies, one was unconscious...and he wouldn't believe the other one that they weren't taking any drugs.  He was brusque and nasty to the other kid, insisting it was an OD case.  Turned out it was a black widow spider bite.  When Mike apologized to the kid, the kid said ""It's okay doctor, you can't help your prejudices any more than anyone else can, I guess...""

Ouch!!

This is a great show, safe to watch with families and kids - though my son gets upset sometimes when he sees people hanging by their legs from towers or something...and he's very sad when someone dies.",1156550400,4,1262,4.354700854700854
2321280,5,B0009UC80G,"I watched Emergency faithfully as a young kid and thought it would have lost some of its magic by now.  But no, it's still great!  Watching it from an adult perspective is a whole new experience.  Some of the rescues are amazing even by today's standards.  Real edge-of-the-seat stuff.  And to have all of these episodes commercial-free, uncut and in sequence is priceless!

There have been some complaints about the quality of these DVDs.  I was hesitant to buy Season 1 but took the leap anyway (after going for Season 2 first).  I've run through each episode completely and the DVDs in my particular Season 1 set have been fine -- no freezing or skipping problems.

I highly recommend Season 2, also.  The characters are a bit more developed and Captain Stanley arrives on the scene.",1145836800,,786,4.713235294117647
2321281,4,B0009UC80G,"This is a great set and a ""must-have"" for anyone who grew up with Emergency.  Season 2 is now available, and there are some noticible differences between the two.

Emergency Season 1 is a bit slow in the beginning and the shows are not as exciting as you may remember them as a kid.  In the early episodes, there is not really a consistant format at all.  It is as if you are watching a work in progress.  In this early version of Emergency, they were obviously experimenting with the storylines, characters, and general direction of the show.

When I first got this set, I popped in disc one and sat back expecting a pleasant trip down memory lane.  I must admit, I was a bit dissapointed.  The first episode is a movie that explains how the entire paramedic profession was born.  It is a really good story, but again, not the Emergency you will remember.

What you may not remember is that Gage and DeSoto did not know each other before the show began.  What we see is the development of a professional relationship, as well as a personal friendship.  The dynamic-duo of the search and rescue aspect of the show just isn't there.

Remember Dr. Brackett?  He could do no wrong. If he lost a patient, there was no hope to begin with.  He was as much of a hero as Guage and DeSoto. In the early episodes, he is often a complete jerk. (He was against the paramedic program altogether!)

How about the beautiful Dixie McCall?  We all know she and Dr. Brackett had a relationship, but as a kid, I remember it being mostly innuendo.  In season one, it is a down-right HOT affair!  The interaction between the two is quite entertaining!  No innuendo here.

If you are wondering about the lovable Dr. Early, his character is established perfectly from the beginning.  He is exactly how you may remember him.  Gentle, kind and an overall good guy.

Season One may not be what you remember, but by the time you are done watching it you will be hooked all over again!",1143158400,4,1957,4.447887323943662
2321322,4,B0009UC80G,"If you're a boomer or Xer chances are this phrase brings back some memories.  ""Emergency!"" a show I grew up with and created and directed by Jack Webb (of Dragnet), starring Randolph Mantooth (gotta love that name) and Kevin Tighe (the heavy in Matewan).  The pilot episode is a well done two hour TV movie based on the true story of how paramedics became legal in California.  It mentions the governor, Ronald Reagan who signed the law (no comment on his politics).  You can see a short clip here of Bobby Troup the show's second doctor, singing and playing piano (the actor was the author of the song ""Route 66"").

  There is a big error in the opening credits that is always annoying to the viewer; namely they put each actor's name on the screen as they show each face....completely covering the faces.  Nelson Riddle (""Batman"" theme song) does the catchy music here.

  These season one episodes are well done, showing the relays between Rampart and Squad 51.  One is called ""The Mascot"" where John looks after a car crash victim's dog.  Also includes ""Brushfire"", ""Botulism"", ""Nurses Wild"", 12 episodes in all.  Also of mention is Robert Fuller who does a convincing role of doctor Brackett.

2321327,4,B0009UC80G,Emergency was one show I liked watching in reruns in the late '70s.  I liked watching how the firefighters in Squad 51 were able to answer the calls to fires at homes or buildings in L.A.  And how the added the hospital element of treating injured victims.  The acting was good on many shows. I like the fast paced theme music with the horns rapidly playing it. I still hear echoes of the sirens in that fire station when there was a call for a fire.  It is one of the best shows to demonstrate the courage of the firefighters.,1141516800,,527,4.24

2321329,4,B0009UC80G,"Universal Home Entertainment continues to frustrate fans of their classic TV library by issuing releases on shoddy, poorly-made media that are rife with defects. I consider myself lucky as my Disc #1 experienced only some minor skipping and pixellation on episode #2 on either side, not enough to justify a return in favor of a new set that could be even worse. But this is truly inexcusable. Big retailers such as Amazon and others need to send Universal a loud and clear message that sending junk into the marketplace is unacceptable and force them to clean up their act.

As for the series itself -- this was one of my favorite Saturday night shows when I was a kid. It's hard to believe that these episodes are 34 years old now. In some ways I see this series as an attempt by Jack Webb's Mark VII productions to take the Adam-12 formula into the firefighting business. It relies on many of the same plot structures and character types as that series. But I like this better, maybe because of the hour-long format or because of the additional regular characters.

Randy Mantooth as John Gage and Kevin Tighe as Roy DeSoto performed dutifully in the series. But looking at it now, the hospital characters, particlarly Robert Fuller's Dr. Kelly Brackett and Julie London's Nurse Dixie McCall seem painfully cliched and wooden. But though she wasn't a great actress, Julie London exudes a subtle sultriness in her scenes that makes watching her worthwhile. I could never warm up to Fuller's character though, preferring Bobby Troup's more human Dr. Joe Early -- even though the thought of musician and songwriter Bobby Troup as a neurosurgeon is a real stretch.

Overall, though, I still enjoy watching these episodes. The series captured the early days of the paramedic profession and Jack Webb deserves credit for making the public aware of what was going on in that regard in California at that time, a trend that eventually swept the continent. In that sense, this show performed a real public service. Now if only Universal would live up to their end of the bargain and release it and other series on discs that people can actually use. For the price they are asking, the buying public deserves better.",1140307200,3,2208,4.79002624671916

2321352,3,B0009UC80G,"Wow. How times change. It's hard to even imagine a world w/o paramedics, let alone them being contested as amateur doctors, as in the first Emergency disc. I rented this from Netflix, and while I only checked out the first disc (which wasn't doubled sided btw, I think they changed the format!) I think I'll be passing on this as a purchase.

I really loved the interaction with ""Gage"" (and Desoto). His character is genuine and the stuff underdog heroes are made of. Sadly, an entire half of the show seems to be dedicated to the rather painful caricatures back at the hospital. I for one really do not like ""doctor shows"" but am willing to bypass my own indifferences for the sake of good acting and good characters (like Quincy), sadly, there isn't much of either there. The doctors and nursing staff seem artificial and border on being cruel.

The picture and sound quality are on par with some of the best I've seen and if they have converted these to one sided discs ""enmass"" it will all be for the best. Even though this was NOT a double sided disc (it had pure black factory paint with the title ""Emergency Disc One"") it actually said ""Side A"" in the menu screen but the flip side COULD NEVER BE PLAYED.

I think what I will do is try Emergency Season Two Disc One when it becomes available and see how the show matures, because my impression of season one was one of extremely dated procedures and one hell of a para... para... oh what's the word?",1138924800,4,1456,4.4456928838951315

Believe me, I have e-mailed Universal plenty of times requesting

they release this great series.

Not too many tv shows can make the claim of influencing something as important as Emergency did. I don't know a firefighter who has not watched this show, or was influenced by

it to become a paramedic or firefighter.

I too wish Universal would do the discs single sided and extra's

would be great, but the clarity was good, compared to the recorded tapes we had from tvland.

It's great to watch these with no commercials, and also seeing

that extra 6 minutes that tvland cut out for their commercials.

Can't wait for Season 2 to come out.

As for the double sided discs, why not e-mail Universal and let

The only trouble I have had so far, is with the audio and visual being out of sync (it's a bit like watching a foreign dubbed film!!!!).  I have tried to fix this on my DVD player and think I may have been successful, so next time I watch an episode, I expect it to be ok (fingers crossed!!!).  I haven't experienced this with other DVD's so hope it isn't a problem with this DVD set.

The sound and visual quality of the DVDs I found to be good.

I would have preferred the DVD's to be single sided rather than double-sided.  It is a bit of a hit and miss approach to determine which side of the DVD to play if you are looking for a particular episode.  Information is only given on one side (I assume side A), and I assume if you want to play side A, you have the writing side up (and side A is thus the underside).  Complicated, I know!!!!  The beauty of single-sided DVD's is you don't have this problem.

All in all, I would definitely recommend this DVD set.  Emergency!  hasn't been (and probably won't be) on Pay TV (here in Australia) and so if you want to relive this show, buying the DVD's is probably the only way you can see it.  I will definitely be buying Season 2 etc when it is released.

Chances are, you will hear ""That old TV show, Emergency! (or, Emergency One!)"".  For me, it was a direct influence upon my entering the healthcare field.  Originally, I wanted to be a paramedic ""just like Johnny and Roy"", but eventually I decided to follow in Dixie's footsteps and enter the nursing profession.  And to this day, items from this show *still* have some influence upon my actions.  C'mon, all you nurses and paramedics out there, admit it:  Haven't you at least **ONCE** flicked the top off of a medication vial just like Johnny does in the opening credits?  Or squirted out excess fluid from a syringe (large, assembled syringe, a la D50 or Bicarb), like Roy did...?

When I grew up, I wanted to be just like my heroes on Emergency, working in the medical field, helping people, and saving lives.  Well, Johnny, Roy, Dixie, Dr. Brackett, and Dr. Early, I got my wish!  See you at the Emergency Room, guys!  Rampart out!",1127174400,5,1097,4.844086021505376

The History of EMS in all of these other reviews is correct, and Emergency!  was a very clean show. (where's family hour today?) My mother made me be good in church on Saturday evening, and if I wasn't, I couldn't watch Emergency! when we got home. I was one kid who enjoyed it, and I entered a volunteer fire department in 1989, in part because of ""Emergency!""

In 1998, I was a gift basket presenter at the ""Emergency!"" convention.  At least 500 people showed up. Randy Mantooth, Kevin Tighe, Bobby Troup, Robert Fuller, Marco Lopez, Mike Stoker, and Tim Donnelly were there.  ALL of them were enthusiastic and friendly.  NONE were treating anyone like ""here's your autograph, bye.""  I would say at least 300 of the 500 convention attendees were either doctors, nurses, paramedics, EMT's, firefighters, police officers, medical professionals, etc. who came to say ""thank you.""  What other TV show has had that?  Jim Page would say, ""that simply would not have happened, without the impact of Emergency!""

The Journal of Emergency Medical Services speaks favorably of Emergency!.  Gary Ludwig of the Memphis FD said that Emergency! was one of the most positive images of the fire service on Television (I concur), and Randolph Mantooth paid tribute to Jim Page at the last EMS convention I attended. The next time you get on your truck, thank Jack Webb, R.A. Cinader, and Jim Page.  Also thank those from the first paramedic classes whose perseverance was a big help in those early days.  Where would you be today without the trailblazers? Would ambulances still be the ""you crash we dash method?"" Think about it.",1126051200,28,1709,4.875432525951557

The pilot movie and the short first season is all that's included,(except for previews of other Universal coming releases).  I was disappointed there were no extras at all.  Many of the stars are still acting and I would have appreciated some interviews with them and some of the great directors as was the case with Battlestar Galactica (Cylon Head edition) also from Universal.  The DVDs look great, the captioning is very helpful and my set only has a very brief instant of stalling.  A popular tv shows site that has voting has over 1800 votes for Emergency!, it's popularity with fans is undisputed.  As a mature viewer I appreciate the show's good taste in showing sanitized injuries, a common practice at that time.  Strategic placement of nurses and furniture make it possibe to maintain good taste when doctors or paramedics are attending to patients.  The fire scenes are exciting and watchable too, very believable to a civilian's eye anyway.  The shows are uplifting and entertaining.

It's amazing to see how much emergency medicine had advanced since this show aired.,1125878400,4,368,4.271428571428571
2321475,4,B0009UC80G,"""Emergency!"" is, in my opinion, one of the best medical shows ever to appear on prime time television.  It depicts the day-to-day, real-life adventures of the paramedics of Los Angeles County in the early 1970's.

In the late 1960's, doctors, some firemen, and a California State Assemblyman recognized the need for immediate emergency medical treatment.  On the flip side, there were many people who were against the idea of ""hose jockeys"" acting like doctors and performing some of the jobs that doctors did.  The general consensus back then was that doctors should practice medicine and fire fighters should practice fire fighting.

Many people, then and now, who were very sick or injured, could not wait for emergency treatment at a hospital.  Ambulance attendants at that time were no more than hospital orderlies who, possessing only a basic understanding of first aid, could not administer emergency medicine.

Thus, the ""Wedworth-Townsend Act"" was born.  This Act, signed into law July 15, 1970 by then-governor Ronald Reagan, authorized medical training for rescue firemen and allowed them to administer the emergency treatment patients needed to stabilize them for transport to a hospital.

""Emergency!"" is a very realistic depiction of those early paramedics.  A little artistic license is used here and there, of course, but generally the series is quite accurate, and many of the episodes are based on actual incidents.  The series is also credited with prompting other fire departments across the country to create their own paramedic services.

Shows such as ""ER,"" ""Chicago Hope"" and ""Doc"" depict emergency medicine from the hospital's point of view.  ""Emergency!"" depicts emergency medicine from the paramedics' point of view.

If you're looking for realistic, fast-paced drama with just a touch of humor interjected here and there, I highly recommend this series.  I give the show itself a five-star rating, although the overall rating is four stars only because the episodes are stored on double-sided DVDs, which can be easily scratched.

""Emergency!"" should be a ""must-have"" in everyone's DVD collection.  It is a ground-breaking series that set the precedent for all other emergency-medical shows after it.",1125792000,13,2228,5.35632183908046
2321476,5,B0009UC80G,"As a die-hard ""Emergency!"" fan and career firefighter/paramedic, I've been waiting a long time for the DVD releasse of this show. I remember watching this show as a young child. It is the main reason I chose public safety as my career. I also tried diligently to record the reruns on TV Land several years ago.

Anyhow, about the DVD: the video reproduction is excellent. the sound is equally as good. I also enjoy the fact that the pilot (The Wedsworth-Townsend Act) is reproduced in the TV movie format instead of the 'flash-back' 2-part episode. I have since taken the set to my fire station and to the ambulance service that I work for, and have watched all of the episodes.

Wow, what great memories!!

I highly recommend this DVD set for anyone who fondly remembers the show, the stars, the action, or if you just want a nostalgic trip back to the 70s!

2321478,5,B0009UC80G,"Most television shows attempting to be a PSA ultimately abandon audience interest in favor of being saccharine and preachy---and are subsequently forgotten years later. Despite the outdated medical equipment and protocol (the paramedics have to call their local hospital for treatment authorizations) this Jack-Webb directed series overall stands the test of time.

A show about the daily adventures of paramedics is not very revolutionary today, but in the early 1970's it was groundbreaking. In that earlier era, most people had grown up knowing that an ambulance could not patch people up en route to Rampart Hospital---something which my generation takes as a given today.

The people in this series are (of course) Hollywood actors, but the message they deliver is effective. Even with comparatively sanitized scripts (these paramedics apparently specialize in treating bloodless injuries!) and an eerily quiet hospital where Dr. Kelly Brackett (Robert Fuller) and Nurse Dixie McCall (Julie London) work, the scripts are amazing for what they were.

This TV drama even earned praise from then-Senator Alan Cranston (D-CA) for informing the public about the numerous benefits of the paramedic program. Receiving commendations from a Federal Legislator is a pretty impressive track sheet for a fictional television show. Today's so-called reality shows can only dream of having such cultural impact upon the American psyche.

11 episodes are included in the 1972-1973 season. Extras on this disc are the Wedsworth-Townsend Act (actually the first 'episode) which explains how the paramedic program is authorized--and the subsequent episodes themselves can exist.

The short season is compensated by realistic script writing acknowlleging that these paramedics are immediately and then constantly at work once they come into existence, this is not a job for the slacker. Plus, it certainly does not hurt that the two male leads themselves are very hunky--I'm genuinely torn between Kevin Tighe and Randolph Mantooh!

Because they do get easily scratched (including with careful handing!) I am concerned that Universal gave a show of such socio-cultural importance the double-sided DVD treatment.",1125187200,13,2197,5.602409638554217

I made it as far as the 2nd episode on side A of disc one, when, not long into the show, the disc starts skipping and then freezes up completely.  This has happened to me with other universal tv products and I'm really getting tired of it.  I have yet to find a set of their recent tv releases that actually works!

2321504,4,B0009UC80G,"First off, I want to say I agree with reviewer Steve Allen.  This set is a long time in coming.  I had the complete set of Emergency! tapes from Columbia House, which ultimately was not even half the episodes from the show.  At best, it was a ""greatest hits"" type of deal.  With that said, I am glad that this great show is finally in a chronological, season-by-season format and on DVD.

Now the problems: I was not impressed with the two-sided discs with only three episodes per side.  That was a cheap way out, if you ask me.  I was also expecting special features, like a ""making of"" commentary, or outtakes or SOMETHING!  I was quite disappointed with the format of the set and the overall cheapness of it.  It was definitely worth, maybe, $15 for 11 episodes.  It was a mid-season replacement, after all.

As for the show, it was quite refreshing to see these episodes, a lot of which I haven't seen in re-runs.  There were a lot of lesser-known episodes that were just as good or better than the more well known episodes on Columbia House.  This is the show that inspired me to get into EMS as soon as I was old enough in the late '80s.  Surprisingly, a lot of the techniques from the early '70s and that were depicted on the show were still in use at that time.  I grew up with this show and I am real happy to see it out as I stated above.  I am looking forward to season 2, but I just hope that Universal does a little more with that season than they did with season 1.",1125100800,5,1479,4.209964412811388
2321505,5,B0009UC80G,"In reading through the reviews I have noticed that a few of you are upset because there are only 11 episodes in this DVD set. The show was a mid-season replacement that debuted in January 1972, so there aren't any more episodes in season one.

Also, the running time for the set is a few minutes shy of 11 hours. take a look at a DVD set for the Simpsons or some other modern series and you will discover that the 22 episodes for a season are only 7 hours or so long and sell for about the same price. Even better, take a look at the Sopranos or other HBO series and you will see that their 10-12 episode season will cost you $80 or more.

As to the series itself, even after 30+ years it still amazes me how realistic everything looked. They didn't have all the computer generated special effects that make up today's TV shows and movies. they used real fires and rescues in a controlled environment, at least as well as you can control a fire.",1124928000,7,945,4.2154696132596685
2321506,5,B0009UC80G,"I was 6 years old when Emergency! debuted. And I couldn't wait for Saturday night! I became an instant Emergency! ""junkie"".

The show was truly revolutionary for it's time. I've recently learned that the L.A. County Fire Department, upon being asked to assist in the making of Emergency, insisted that every rescue and fire scene be based on real-life L.A.County Fire Department responses, and that each scene and film shot be made as realistic as possible.

This makes Emergency! even more enjoyable to watch, knowing how ""true to life"" it was.

Shows like ""Rescue Me"", where every charecter (I know I misspelled it) seems like a self-centered jerk, can't compare to Emergency. John & Roy, Captain Stanley, Drs. Brackett & Early, Dixie and the ""Engine 51"" gang were all terrific, and were people of good moral & ethical charecter (why don't I know how to spell this word!).

Whether you watched the show when it was on NBC, on TV Land, Columbia House VHS, or are watching it on DVD as a first-time viewer, this is a great show...for anyone from age 2 to 102.

If you have children, this is a show you can watch with them, without worrying about graphic material or word content. It is as ""clean"" a t.v. show as there is for a drama show, and will set a good example for children.

You'll also get to see some unique & great-looking fire trucks, such as ""Truck 127"" - a ""snorkel"", or what is commonly called an

""elevated platform"" (you'll see it early on in the very first episode during the high-tension tower rescue), and what is called a ""deluge""...a giant water nozzle placed on a ""squad 51-like"" truck (seen briefly in the first action sequence in the very first episode).

I could go on and on about what a great show Emergency! is.

I can only hope the sales of the 1st season (only 11 episodes) are so good, that Universal will release all six seasons.

This is great, wholesome entertainment that proves that it doesn't have to have sex and gore to entertain.

On the other hand, this set gets the usual Universal short shrift treatment: cheap packaging, no booklet, zero special features, dual-sided disks of questionable quality, etc. Contrast this with all the extras on the Rescue Me DVD set after only one season! Look at the great treament that Paramount gave to The Brady Bunch and Gilligan's Island. Why can't Universal do at least as well?",1124755200,12,734,4.689922480620155

2321509,4,B0009UC80G,"Emergency was a revolutionary TV show.  It portrayed the work of firefighters, paramedics, and doctors pretty much the way it happens in real life.  Prior to Emergency medical based shows tended to lean towards soap opera style dramatics to create compelling stories.  With Emergency the writers used the real jargon spoken by these professionals (""51 start an IV, D5W TKO,"" ""We're transmitting EKG,"" ""We're sending you a strip, vitals to follow. Pulse is 160, the victim is in extreme pain, Rampart. V-fib!""), and it showed how lives were really saved.

The danger of firefighters' work was really shown for the first time in Emergency, and while the show did tend to glamorize firefighters to a small degree it also showed the dedication that they have to their jobs.  Decades before the movie Backdraft you saw firefighters risking their lives on nearly a daily basis.  Realism was goal one for the producers, and they achieved that goal.

Season 1 has some great episodes, but it also lacks the cast chemistry that came a year or two later with the addition of Michael Norell as Captain Stanley.  The cast - filled with great personalities like Randolph Mantooth, Kevin Tighe, Robert Fuller, Bobby Troup, Ron Pinkard, and Julie London - spent the first season finding their footing with their characters.  By season 2 most of them had their characters pegged and developed great interplay with each other.

The other firefighters on the show, played by Tim Donnelly, Marco Lopez, and Mike Stoker also deserve mention because although some of them were given very little to stretch them as actors they did have the perfect personalities to play those characters.

Jack Webb co-created Emergency, and it was his desire to make the show in as close to a ""documentary"" style as possible.  The realism of Emergency ultimately paved the way for later medical shows such as ER.

This is definitely a show that should have its entire run on DVD.  Hopefully this first season sells well enought to see the rest of the show released on DVD.  To quote Captain Stanley, ""Station 51, KMG 365.""",1124496000,88,2084,4.897435897435898

Sure, Randy and Kevin were oftentimes the main focus, but there was no mistaking the contributions of Bobby Troup, Julie London, Robert Fuller and the rest of the Squad 51 actors.  In fact, I only gave this DVD four stars because I know that the wonderful Michael Norell doesn't appear as ""Cap"" until the third season.  I also learned that this DVD only has eleven episodes.

I gained a whole new insight into what it took to get the paramedic program off the ground here. My dad was an EMT for awhile before going back into the military but he's now retired. I wish that I could list my favorite episode but I can't because I love them all. If there isn't anyone who hasn't seen this show you need to check it out because there is never a dull moment and the cast was amazing.,1121904000,7,570,3.9224137931034484
2321572,5,B0009UC80G,"Okay, now that I have caught my breath from the total elation I just experienced when I happened on this soon to be released DVD series.  I am a huge TV on DVD fan and have collected many of my old childhood favorites.  Emergency!, I have to say, tops my list.  This was one of my favorite shows as a child, I was so in love with Randolph Mantooth!!  A few years back I was able to get some of the episodes on VHS, and the show was still as great as ever, it was fun to watch with my children, not something you can do with todays prime time offerings.  Highly, highly recommended series for any who have not watched it.  I can't praise this series enough.",1121731200,23,656,4.0859375
2321573,5,B0009UC80G,"I loved Emergency as a child. I can't wait to get this on DVD,It brings back my childhood. I last saw it on TV Land. I used to count the times when people used to call Dixie""Dix"" when it was on TV Land. They saved lots of lived and hardly ever lost lives. Well Done Boys! Dsoto,and Gage. Where were Desoto and Gage when we needed Station 54, when 9/11 struck? They would've saved lots of lives there.",1121558400,2,400,4.141025641025641
2321574,5,B0009UC80G,"Oh my g*d...I can't believe it! I can't wait to see this DVD set from Universal Classics.  As a big fan of Emergency & Emergency One back in the 70s & 80s this show inspired me to enter the EMS field.  Mr. Jack Web we EMT-Bs', EMT-Is' and EMT-Ps' thank you for showing the world what EMS work was all about back then and how far we have come!  And to all the die hard fans--it is our time to rejoyce!

2321575,5,B0009UC80G,I was getting sick of seeing all of these lame new shows that have only run for one season and are already on DVD when this show was never even really on VHS-I have 6 of them I think...5 or 6...the next show they need to work on along these lines is Third Watch,1120867200,,261,3.8518518518518516
2321576,5,B0009UC80G,"Finally the trifecta has come to home video.  With Dragnet, Adam-12, and EMERGENCY we have true WEBB TV.  This set contains 11 episodes from this ground breaking program's 1st season.

We all can thank Jack Webb for his insight in developing this series.  The nationwide local government firefighter/paramedic  concept of EMT's came right out of LA County.  The telecom equipment may be ancient and harvest gold in color but the stories depicted on EMERGENCY shows what we have know all along about the dedicated men and women serving as police , fire, and rescue personnel.  Let us all hope our homefront warriors are never tested again as on 9/11.

Update...

WOW!  I had forgotten how good the TV movie was.  This show truely has it all with fairly accurate ER scenes (without the visual medical stuff) and a whole host of rescue scenarios that paramedics face everyday.  This 1st season set IS nicely arranged BUT still could use some digital maintenance.

Playability issues...

It seems that EMERGENCY!, ADAM - 12, DRAGNET 1967, and a whole host of newer movies from Universal Studios DO have a playability issue with older players.  Not so with Image Entertainment & Paramount Studios, whom both have issued TV series sets.  The other studios also go the extra mile by not doing their sets in a double sided format.  Universal seems to take the easy route like Disney's Pan & Scan attitude.  But that's just my opinion; I could be wrong!",1120521600,8,1444,4.8244897959183675
2321577,5,B0009UC80G,"I was just watching my tapes of Emergency when I found out that it was being released on DVD, well I preordered right away. But I couldn't help but see how Emergency compared to the hype of ER and how much better the show was because it didn't leave us hanging from week to week, and the characters were people who lead clean lives. While yes there was a moral to every ep, and the appliances were avacado and chocolate, the clothes were groovy, it still makes me feel good about the emergency services workers. So sound the claxons. Emergency is back!",1118966400,12,552,4.421568627450981
2321578,5,B0009UC80G,"Emergency! is an excellent show that the whole family can watch together without worrying mom and dad.

Jack webb and the actors did an excellent job presnting a realistic view of the paramedic program,yet not too real so that people would be squeamish while viewing the hosptial scenes.

Fans of St. Elsewhere and ER can also see what inspired those shows as well.",1118016000,10,365,4.777777777777778
2321579,5,B0009UC80G,"Emergency! without a doubt is the single most important program of our time. With the exception possibly of ""Americas Most Wanted"" and ""Unsolved Mysteries"",Emergency! made more of a difference than any other ""fluff"" show on TV.Who had ever heard of Paramedics,or rescue squads before this show? Anyone who has ever dialed 9-1-1 and requested medical assistance,can thank Jack Webb,Mr Cinader,Johnny and Roy and everybody else associated with this groundbreaking show for urging nationwide EMT coverage. Remember,in the old days,ambulances could not perform lifesaving treatments and could only transport the injured. Many died enroute to the hospital not due to the severity of their injuries,but due to the lack of initial treatment,and no possible diagnosis of how serious their injuries were. Yup....every American today and from 1972- up to today owes a debt of gratitude to this amazing show. Forget CSI,ER,and Law & Order.....they are lightweights compared to the reach of this production. To this day,the Crown engine,the Ward LaFrance engine,and the 72 Dodge squad along with all surviving cast members are....every one...legends. Get ready for Emergency! mania once this DVD is released....It deserves it...and its the least we can do to honor the incredible program that we are fortunate to have.",1117843200,46,1306,5.502487562189055
