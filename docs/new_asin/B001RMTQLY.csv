3777091,5,B001RMTQLY,"This video is one of the best I've seen in months. I stumbled upon it accidentally, but it turned out to be extremely important investment of my time.
2.75 hours (..alright 2 hours 45 minutes) of great data about one sick, disgusting pervert, and his influence on America and the world. The data presented is more than simple biography of a sick man. It is far more.
This video connects lots of dots. I mean a lot. Few persons appear in the movie, of whom Joe Schimmel, and Judith A. Reisman deserve great respect!!!
If you know Joe Schimmel, he is more than your average reporter with narrow view of events. He knows his stuff. I was surprised that Joe found evidence of a connection between Alister Crowley and Alfred C. Kinsey. If you seen any of his previous movies (The Hollywood's War on God, or They Sold Their Souls for Rock n Roll), you know how he exposes occult connection in all his work.
You can always visit Joe Schimmel's site/webstore at goodfight[dot]org.

Don't make premature judgments, please, before you watch it. I know some of you may think that this is some silly fundamentalist home-made video.
But until you watch it, and deal with the FACTUAL data (as opposed to 'scientific' children molestations by Kinsey), don't dare defend that sick, inhuman, psychopathic sadomasochistic pervert - Kinsey.

Among other things, this video analyzes Kinsey's 'research', his influence on policy making, and road to decriminalizing of all sorts of sexual perversions, his connection to bloody Nazi pedophile, to bloody demon-possessed Alister Crowley, and influence of pornography on viewers and hence on the society.

I've made a study of Kinsey and thought this video might be an interesting counterpoint, but instead found a film filled with disinformation and outright fiction.  There is nothing of value here.

3777096,1,B001RMTQLY,I'm not going to go into the details; there's another review that outlines it really well.  I'll just say that it is sensationalized conservative over-dramatized propaganda with no more than a smidgen of truth.  I looked up a few of the statistics presented in the movie and they were all either misapplied or just false.,1354492800,10,321,4.818181818181818
3777097,1,B001RMTQLY,"The film parrots standard slogans and rhetoric: ""children don't know"" about sex until someone ""steals their innocence."" The dramatic music and horror movie sound effects serve no purpose than to cultivate the mood of fear this film wants to provoke. Vicious and blatantly groundless accusations are made against the courageous and pioneering scientist, Alfred Kinsey. The narrator claims the foundations of our nation are ""Christian principles."" Bogus figures on missing children are quoted to terrify viewers  by exaggerating the risk of stranger abduction. Instead of quoting national statistics on child injury and fatality, an obscure ""estimate"" of child abductions is repeated more than once to mislead viewers about the most frequent and most deadly dangers children face. A self-interested author quotes the hysterical parent of a victim as saying ""Your child could be next,"" as if that's a reliable source to calculate the actual probability of danger.

Prosecutors and other self-interested non-experts are quoted making silly and irrelevant emotional statements like ""Your child can disappear in an instant."" The narrator repeats what a prosecutor claims: that abused children are ""scarred forever,"" and ""messed up for life,"" as if he's a medical doctor as well as a prosecutor. The discredited claim that children who were sexually abused ""often lead troubled lives"" is merely repeated without mentioning the counter-evidence.*

The film makes no distinction between ""pedophiles"" and child molesters. It makes false claims about the supposedly high rate of recidivism of ""pedophiles,"" without acknowledging (or unaware) that one of the world's leading authorities on pedophilia says not only do sex offenders against children have a relatively low rate of recidivism, an estimated half of sex offenders against children aren't even pedophiles (many are actually psychopaths who prefer adult sex partners).** The film later contradicts itself by claiming that most pedophiles are never caught. How does anyone know that? If we don't have access to most pedophiles, how can we make valid generalizations about them as a group?

The narrator refers to ""us as a society"" as if everyone is in agreement about the supposed need for terror. He quotes a law firm as saying the supposed increase of sex offenses against children is ""directly tied"" to the increase of pornography on the web. Since when is a law firm an expert on the alleged (supposedly causal) relationship between pornography on the web and sex offenses? Even a former porn star is quoted for her valuable opinion on the supposedly causal connection between porn and sex offenses against children. (She and a former pornographer later testify how God saves.)

Sensationalist journalists are shown making groundless claims like ""the average child molester"" has more than 100 victims, and quotes one hysteric (Judith Reisman) who claims, incredibly, that much of the current ""horror show"" can be traced back to the scientist Kinsey. She quotes the old conspiracy theory (with only token support) that organizations like the Rockefeller Foundation wanted to corrupt America's ""Christian principles"" by any means necessary.

Rather than trying to prove the silly claim that Kinsey was largely or solely responsible for the supposed increase in child sexual abuse later, the film goes on to attack the validity of Kinsey's pioneering research. Most incredibly, Kinsey's research is criticized for selection bias because he included convicted sex offenders and prostitutes as part of his population sample. While that criticism may very well be justified, this film nowhere mentions that the multitude of research claiming that child sexual abuse is usually seriously harmful was no less guilty of selection bias by including patients in therapy as part (if not all) of their study populations. According to this film, selection bias is bad (or ""scientific fraud"") only if your opponents do it.

Note that we are talking about early sex research done in the 1940s and 1950s, compared to sex abuse research as recent as the1990s. Nor does this film mention another type of bias created by the political correctness police: publication bias. For a long time it has been very difficult if not impossible to obtain any funding to conduct and publish impartial child sexuality research, regardless of who applies for it.

Much footage is devoted to Kinsey's survey of children's sexual experience, quoting Judith Reisman who hysterically claims he was ""responsible"" for the sexual abuse of hundreds if not thousands of children. In reality, the data in question were claimed (by Kinsey and co-researchers) to have come from several child molesters long after the fact. A recent director of the Kinsey Institute says he believes only one child molester provided the data, and Kinsey's claim of several molesters was intended to protect his source (just as a journalist's privilege, lawyer/client, doctor/patient, etc.). But regardless of the number of Kinsey's sources, none of the film's long discussion proves Reisman's accusation that Kinsey was ""responsible"" for any child molestation (let alone hundreds or thousands), or that the data (regardless of the number of sources) were not accurate. The film contradicts itself again by quoting another propaganda film that claims an outside scientist (not part of Kinsey's research team) trained the molester to record his data.

The reports that some children enjoyed their sexual experiences are called ""shocking"" by the narrator. Reisman suggests that children having orgasms is torture, and it would be impossible for a four-year-old to have 26 orgasms within 24 hours, as reported in Kinsey's book. (Reisman should read my forthcoming blog post about my own childhood.) On the basis of my personal experience of my own childhood orgasms I would agree with Kinsey's critics that some of his book's description of orgasms in young children is hard to believe. Orgasm in childhood is a normal and natural response to stimulation, and not at all as dramatic as either Kinsey or his hysterical critics claim. I am not claiming any observations; I am speaking from the horse's mouth.

The film claims a crucial point is that Kinsey and his researchers must have encouraged pedophiles to molest children and record their observations carefully, but despite a lot of effort attempting to prove that point (Kinsey researchers are accused of ""word play,"" and actors posing as scientists are shown giving stopwatches to other actors posing as dirty old men, accompanied by dramatic music), a Kinsey co-worker and former director of the Kinsey Institute flatly denies any such thing, and convincingly explains that the pedophile(s) were not encouraged nor trained to do anything. Only parents and child care workers who observed children spontaneously playing by themselves were encouraged to record their observations carefully.

This propaganda film wouldn't be complete without a pseudonymous victim claiming recovered memories. A woman says she was molested by her father with a stopwatch when she was a child, and she claims the father boasted that he had helped Kinsey's research. She only remembered or realized what had happened years later. Although she claims her mother didn't know about it at the time, the latter reportedly corroborated the woman's accusations - an inconsistency the film sees no need to explain.

A truly bizarre part of this story is the revelation that after WWII, Kinsey had reportedly corresponded with a former Nazi in Germany who was later arrested for the possible murder of a child during the war in occupied Poland. But the narrator tries to confuse the time period with ambiguous verb tenses that suggest the crimes were in progress during Kinsey's post-war correspondence. The evidence for molestation was evidently the molester's diaries which he kept during the war, and yet the narrator in this film keeps saying Kinsey corresponded with the man who ""was molesting"" children, rather than saying he ""had been molesting"" or ""used to molest"" children. The former Nazi is also repeatedly called a ""Nazi,"" even though the time period referred to is clearly the 1950s. Once a Nazi always a Nazi?

Kinsey's letters are said to have encouraged the man to ""continue his research,"" but no evidence is offered that by that phrase he meant molest more children, nor is any evidence presented that any more children were in fact molested. Instead, the viewer is presented with images of an actor wearing a Nazi uniform complete with swastika armband, accompanied by dramatic music. At the end of this part of the story, the narrator stops playing word games himself and says in no uncertain terms: the ""Nazi's"" crimes took place during the war (not during Kinsey's post-war correspondence).

The film makes another weak attempt at guilt-by-association in Kinsey's efforts to obtain the diaries of the infamous occultist Aleister Crowley in Europe. Kinsey's motto ""Do your best and let other people react as they will,"" is likened to Crowley's motto ""Do what thou wilt, shall be the whole of the law."" Hardly a close resemblance. Complaining that Kinsey's research influenced the modernization of sex laws, this film neglects to mention that many sex laws date back to the 1800s, when the Salvation Army organized mass demonstrations to influence sex laws. Is that the enlightened period we should forever consider a model of legal wisdom?

Calling anyone under 18 ""children,"" and labeling Playboy publisher Hugh Hefner as Kinsey's ""pamphleteer,"" the film brings Reisman back to make the arrogant and ridiculous claim that Playboy and similar magazines must be arousing, and arousal must be acted out in violent sex crimes. ""That's just the way the human brain works,"" Reisman declares. Despite the certainty with which the supposed link between pornography and crime is asserted, only the weakest arguments are offered as evidence, e.g. sex crimes increased during the 1960s, the same period in which Playboy became very popular, which is like saying the increase in coffee drinking is responsible for the increase in sexual abuse because both occurred during the same decade. No hard scientific evidence for the supposed porn-crime link is mentioned.

Another contradiction: After arguing that viewing porn creates a sex addiction, Reisman claims viewing porn desensitizes people to sex. I'm glad she finally got it right. The self-righteous saviors of children's purity are unbound by logic, and amidst the shame over child sexual abuse, they are shameless in presenting this propaganda film as honest, dispassionate analysis. The film concludes by claiming Kinsey's death was a masochistic suicide, and although I'm unable to verify or dispute that claim, the claim does nothing to discredit the courageous and pioneering work Kinsey did during his life, and his work's possible contribution to the revolution in popular attitudes that previously censored open discussion of human sexuality and healthy sexual development.

Compared to his European predecessors (Krafft-Ebing, Havelock Ellis, Freud), Alfred Kinsey was more open-minded and much more scientific. Kinsey was not perfect, but he marked a clear and precious historical transition from sexual philosophy and moral indoctrination to sexual science and balanced education. Despite blatant propaganda films like this one, we are still making progress on that road.

3777098,5,B001RMTQLY,"It baffles me that so many people have no idea and just blindly refer to the Kinsey studies for all their knowledge and information about human sexuality.
His methods and ""research"" were bias and shoddy at the last. The fact that we have lawmakers and educators pushing Kinsey to the masses as standard for human sexuality and behavior is so crazy when it's obvious and clear-cut that it was mostly junk science. I'm a centrist moderate who often times leans a little to the left on most issues. I often will call out and pick apart the extreme religious-nut jobs who quotes scriptures as an answer to everything. That being said, this documentary is completely rational and everything is backed up with concrete evidence and non-bias facts/sources. Kinsey sympathizers will not be able to constructively or intellectually pick this apart. Again, this is a must see. Anybody who refers or thinks of Kinsey as the hero of sexuality of any kind has been bought and souled a false bill of goods.",1275696000,21,992,4.807017543859649
3777099,5,B001RMTQLY,"This is a well done documentary that contains a wealth of information on Kinsey and his ilk, from his Rockefeller funding to his obsession with the sex antics of occultist Aleister Crowley. A very in depth look at the sexual revolution Kinsey's reports fostered and the fundamental changes it created in the moral fabric of American society. Kinsey was a disturbed man, and his ""research"" none too scientific in nature. Nevertheless, it has a profound effect and his still cited often even today. This film is not for those who are offended by moral judgement. While the information is well cited and objective, the film takes a tone of moral outrage that someone like Kinsey could have such a negative effect. Those with anti-Christian proclivities will take issue with the religious undertones that are sometimes presented in the film. I personally had one complaint with the film and that was the occasional skits that are inserted into the duration of it, such as the husband and wife arguing about the husband's pornography addiction. While I understand the basic point these skits are trying to get across, they take away from an overrall informational presentation. Also, while normalizing pedophilia and the sexualization of children is a great moral concern in America today, I feel that this film dwelled on this aspect of Kinseyism a little too heavy to the neglect of other important aspects (ie, the gutting of Heterosexual-relationships, the rise of a sex drenched mass media,etc.)

Kinsey appologists will dismiss this documentary completely as intellectual vigilantism, as they did with the work of Dr. Judith Reisman (featured prominently in the film) who first brought the workings of Kinsey to light. However, those who are concerned about the moral state of sexuality today should watch this film and learn from it. Many of our current social pathologies stem from the work of Alfred Kinsey and his associates. And this fact is given pitifully less public attention than it warrants. The aim of this film is to change that.

Anyone with a sense of humanity, decency, goodness, and plain respect for others should view this film and stand up to the morally bankrupt madness of Kinseyism.",1264291200,12,2206,5.0576923076923075
3777100,5,B001RMTQLY,"The kinsey syndrome reveals the true nature of Dr. Alfred Kinseys research and his compulsive addictions for anything and everything vile. I could go on at length about how he paid pedophiles to rape children and time it with a stop watch. I could go on at length about how he interviewed hookers, pimps, pedophiles, and other sexually deviant prisoners and passed it off as the normal male/female populations in his books. I might even write a blog bit in the future about how Kinsey went state to state and convinced them that pedophiles are not likely to reoffend, and convinced many states to relax their pedophile laws. Ever wonder how a pedophile can get a few weeks and probation but a lesser crime will get three years?

  If I really wanted to I could tell you in great detail about Kinseys connection to Allister Crowley, or how he was working with a Nazi commander to document and report back his how many times he molested (and sometimes killed) innocent children. A german court convicted this man after world war two and revealed his letters with Kinsey. Oh did I mention how Kinseys supposed research influenced Playboy and Penthouse? Did I mention that both those magazines have cartoons of under age girls and boys having sex and liking it? Did I mention that the creater of the ""Chester the Molester"" cartoons in Penthouse was actually acting out his cartoons on his daughter (he was later convicted)?

  The documentary even reveals how one of Kinseys disciples opened a school in San Francisco on sexuality that instructed catholic priests prior to all those sex scandals. The Kinsey Syndrome is one of the most informative films I have ever seen. I appreciate the heart of the people who made this film to expose this mad man and show the destruction he's done to our society. However, I would be lying if I didn't say there is a part of me that wishes I had never seen this. I am not ashamed to admit that I felt real anger and cried real tears while watching this.

8338298,4,B001RMTQLY,"Another great documentary by Chris Pinto and Joe Schimmel. Well researched and made. Kinsey's evil fraudulent research and how Kinsey Institute have tried to silence and put down the research of dr. Judith Reisman are both sickening. Those who say that Reisman did biased research because she's Christian haven't read her books in which she says that she's a a secular Jew. That is why I appreciate her reserach about which I heard through this documentary. Norman Dodd, in his interview with G. Edward Griffin, which was filmed little before his death told how different foundations used Kinsey's research in destroying Christian family values. Nowadays it is used all around Western world for the same end. Documentary exposed also the nazi and occult connection of Kinsey in his research. Christian J.

8338300,5,B001RMTQLY,"Alfred Kinsey is as important to the breakdown of the family as Karl Marx was to the establishment of brutal regimes.  In this documentary, nearly 3 hours long, many facets of the sexual revolution are covered--not the counterculture rock and roll movement, but the weakening of laws against sex offenders, sex education for very young children, and increase in sex crimes.  It's depressing stuff, but if you are interesting in documented research about how this came to be, this documentary is worth the watch.  It has high production value, in my opinion, and every facet is covered.  Kinsey was a bisexual sadomasochist and encouraged pedophiles to time children's sexual responses.  Not covered in the documentary is the fact that it was a backlash against his own strict upbringing, which also was true for Hugh Hefner, which led to both of them seeking fulfillment in sexual experimentation as they felt unconnected to their fathers.  Playboy, Hustler, and Penthouse magazines are also exposed in this documentary for their frequent use of minors in sexual cartoons.

Kinsey was extremely unprincipled in his research method, including prostitutes and prisoners in his highly selective samples, and making claims which no later research has remotely shown to be true, about the prevalence of premarital sex, homosexuality, adultery, etc.  He was corresponding with a German pedophile who had been a notorious Nazi criminal, and this was discovered in the late 50s at that pedophile's trial in Germany, but the American press gave almost no attention to it, as the American media was under the control of powerful foundations which supported Kinsey's agenda, including the Rockefeller Foundation.  The hero featured most in this is a spunky lady who did professional research on the impact of pornography for the Justice Department in the 80s, Dr. Judith Reisman.  She has done battle against the powerful porn industry in getting her research accepted by government institutions.  The claim Hugh Hefner has made, that sex is fine as long as it's consensual, is certainly a poor one, and he based it on Kinsey's claim that couples are likely to be happier if there's more freedom to have other sex partners without it being stigmatized.  This isn't mentioned in the documentary, but I want to mention that Hefner says he doesn't view his own legacy as related to the ""hard"" porn industry of violent images.  I think his thinking is seriously flawed because even if people are willing to have sex to please a dominant partner (consensual sex = both people are willing), if the sex gets motivated by someone's pressure for self-gratification, it's an unhealthy basis for a relationship.  What pornography encourages is a tendency to move toward all kinds of deviances and violent assault, because its basic message is that the only purpose of another person is to gratify you physically.

Kinsey's claim, which became the foundation of ""the Playboy Philosophy"", was that the paranoid reaction of society made people such as kids traumatized, rather than the sexual molestation traumatizing them.  Society, rather than anything in our God-given nature (which they don't believe is God-given), makes people feel guilty for sexual experimentation, the claim is.  Kinsey believed reactions of hysteria and pain by children during sex actually meant they were enjoying it, and Kinsey's intellectual offshoots have trained priests in this kind of thinking and the public school system in ""sex education"".  The reason some reports have indicated a decline in sexual crimes is because of police departments fudging the numbers for political reasons, and the documentary cites a highly respected police researcher in this.  The documentary is airtight in its proof about the negative effects of the sexual revolution.

It should also motivate whoever sees it to be more careful what entertainment they expose themselves and their family and friends to.  If more and more people stop watching certain TV shows or movies, those shows and movies won't be made anymore.  Same with music.  ""The power of the purse"" and prayer to God are our best ways to fight against this, even more than elections--and we've seen how elections have worked for us in ""fixing"" anything:  they haven't!  Individual responsibility, rather than delegation of responsibility to leaders, is the way to begin healing from this.  Two more things:  This documentary came shortly before the debate on same-sex marriage was on the rise, and would no doubt have mentioned it as a legacy of Kinsey.  Qutb, whose anti-American writings were a motivator for the rise of Islamic terrorism, including Al-Qaeda, mentioned Kinsey's influence as evidence of America's depravity.",1435795200,10,4731,5.214002642007926

It begins with the insidious agenda to destroy American Christian values and it continues with blatantly FALSE research funded by the elites (The Rockefeller family), and it then becomes a horrifying scourge on humanity, as laws are passed to cater to deviance, perversion and criminal behavior, rather than protecting the most vulnerable in our society.

More people need to know how the low-life sexual deviants and psychotic pedophiles in this world continue to live as they ""choose"", complete with laws to support them, while millions of children and teenagers go missing each year globally and tragically end up being forced into child porn films, sex slavery rings and sadly, almost always end up dead.
