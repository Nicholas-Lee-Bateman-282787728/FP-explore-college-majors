""What's this?"" I wondered, read a few reviews, noted that Warner Brothers had given this a nice treatment on DVD, had Terry Southern involvement, starred Stacy Keach & featured James Earl Jones. AhhOwWwwAoOW! Okay, my arm is twisted enough, no need to break it loose from the torso.

Someone else mentioned that they found this film to be 'dated', but, it IS from 1970. The end of the sixties promise and turmoil seems to be on display here for me, all dammed up and bursting at the seams. I guess my filters are down more than some folks, because I welcome 'dated' films, and don't find it a necessity for a 40-some year old movie to somehow seem as if it's theme(s) relate to and enlighten our present era. Why wait for a time machine, anyway? I used to work with a guy who knew I loved film history, but was militant about seeing the latest movies as soon as they were released. Whenever he strayed into 'vintage film' territory, he made sure to ask me if I'd seen it, then follow with his dismissal of ""it didn't hold up"". Heh, I guess he meant his ego, but then, even snobs can be entertaining when cooked properly.

This film is as much serious as it is delirious, capturing a moment in time with thought-provoking camerawork, humor, and a poignancy reflecting what seems to be the state of mind/body/spirit of the aimless adult at that time. The humor helps the viewer to alleviate the angst, but only enough to keep you evaluating what's being played out before your eyes, and there are no easy answers.

James Earl Jones is absurdly intense in his role, locking down a solid performance as the head of a psychiatric institute who displays heart while realizing that attempting a cure for the complicated Sixties malaise might take drastic measures. Stacy Keach is at his organic/unhinged best here, the lost soul in search of himself and his place in the world, placing his sanity in the backseat to enjoy the ride (buckle up). The rest of the acting crew is perfectly cast for cinema of this ilk, and to cut to the chase, if this sounds like your idea of an enjoyable cinema experience, I highly recommend you place your eyes on this under-promoted gem at your earliest convenience.

Kudos to Warner Brothers for presenting this beautiful print with optional English, Spanish, and French subtitles; as well as a nice documentary that told me more than I would ever suspect about the film.

Special Thanks to Amazon, without whom I may have never discovered this thought-provoking movie.",1502150400,,2761,4.6591375770020536
7879754,5,6304963106,"To understand this film you must understand existentialism, social criticism, and the dark side of the late 1960's.
Also there are the great then-unknown talents discovered by the filmmaker Aram Avakian, who soon became famous for the depth and creativity of their work.
This ground-breaking indie film was covered in a huge LIFE magazine story: 9 pages. November 1969. Esquire, Playboy, The L.A. Times, The New York Times all reviewed the film positively.",1487980800,,456,5.260273972602739
7879755,1,6304963106,"The United States has lost many of its cinema art houses (except for New York City, which of course is not of the United States).  They were established for the discerning connoisseur of ""aht"" film and foreign films, those who'd had enough of Rock Hudson and Doris Day rom-coms.

Artistic cinema back then was supposed to be serious, even profound, and the cinematic style was considered ""advanced"" (many quick cuts). The narrative or story was of secondary importance, and the screenplay often seemed strongly influenced by the plays of Samuel Beckett.

Usually, there were scenes that were considered ""shocking"" or ""daring,"" and this might include brief nudity.

End of the Road is such a film, but as such, it seems horribly dated and clichd. Many of the scenes take place in a mental hospital under the control of a mad psychiatrist. The inmates act like crazy people are supposed to act: totally bizarre. One man is raping a live chicken. Another (I think that's Terry Southern) crawls around and barks like a dog.  (There's also a scene featuring Terry's long-time companion, the late&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gail-Gibson/dp/0786441143/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gail Gibson</a>.)

I presume that your interest in this movie is due to your admiration for the work of Terry Southern, and this is the last movie he wrote (along with two other writers) in which he had any control over the production. But none of the wit of Southern's fine novels is apparent here. I noticed nothing humorous, unless you'd consider the scene of a naked man raping a chicken to be hilarious.

Nor is Southern's gift for natural dialogue evident. The entire movie is a drag, and the climactic botched-abortion scene would fit nicely into a Right-to-Life ad.

The only redeeming quality of the film is that it was shot by Gordon Willis, who went on to film The Godfather.  Director Aram Avakian never went on to much  two more forgotten films  and there's a reason for that.

If you're a Terry Southern votary, buy one of his books, and skip this.",1456099200,,2081,5.106194690265487
7879756,3,6304963106,"Love it, hate it? Love it/hate it?  I cannot even decide.  It was an excruciating and
visceral film experience, that's for sure. Watching this with a live audience must
be, er, intriguing!  But as a cult movie a la Rocky Horror? Nah, I don't think so.

I somehow only heard about this film recently since it was being screened at some museum
or other in NYC, a newly restored print, but I got hold of the DVD instead. This recent
DVD looks and sounds pretty crisp, too.  Never read Barth's novel, was born in 1968 so pretty
much passed through this horrendous (as if
it's any less horrendous NOW) period of the USA's history (and the 10-13 years that preceded it) as
an infant to young tyke, but during my research got the gist that they took Barth's much older novel (late 50s) and gave it a current post-60s burnout awfulness and wretchedness and anti-Nixon and establishment spin on the proceedings.
Of course, the great Terry Southern's contributions cannot, I'm certain, be underestimated.

Well, I made it through this somehow, felt for most of its duration like I was on a bad acid trip that I never wanted to
really go on, cannot decide if I love or absolutely loathe this appallingly difficult and disturbing,
scabrous, shocking (even now!) film.  Of course everyone delivers the goods, our brave director,
the amazing cast, Gordon Willis on the DP action, and everyone else, but good lord is this
a f'd up film.  It's about as messed up as you can possibly get, even considering the year it
came out.  The fact that LIFE magazine gave it 9 pages on release is bizarre and incredible.

Mainly even on a surface level it rings true: you can get your BA and MA in the USA and
graduate without a single clue as to what to do next, or with any guidance whatsoever
that's worth a damn, and also, most psychiatrists are even more nuts or weird or quirky
or just plain nasty than most of their patients.  Nothing much has changed.
This country (which I imagine this film and Barth's source novel) is still as primarily,
mentally ill and dysfunctional as it's ever been, so on that level, this mind-bendingly
warped film is still as cogent and relevant as the day it was released, with an X rating(!)
and to either deafening silence, appreciative young hip college audiences, and/or
head-scratching and/or horrified and terrified middle-American ""general"" audiences.

Watch at your own risk. I'm not sure anybody will really ""enjoy"" this film, it's not
""entertainment"" on any obvious level, and the ending is really sheer torture.
If you want to at least see a young Stacy Keach and James Earl Jones really chew
scenery and go for a mood of utter anarchy and insanity whilst having fun doing it, than you can
subject yourself to this American version of the Grand Guignol.  I think mainly the film
is attempting to be (as Barth's novel sounds like it was as well) an overall allegory
for what an ""insane asylum"" America had become by this time in history, and how the
otherwise ""sane"" growing up in such dysfunctional and extreme circumstances were
attempting to cope with living within it, or indeed, in many cases coming back TO it
under even worse conditions and circumstances.  You could accuse End of the Road
of being dated or too ""art-house"" and pretentious, although I think overall, this film
is too over-the-top to even be CALLED ""art-house"".  You might call it horrifying,
even unwatchable, but ""precious art-house fodder"" it surely ain't!  Not for general
audiences?  Nope. I don't think you'll be seeing this screened on Turner Classic
Movies anytime soon.  Almost makes Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse Five look like
a Tupperware party (book or film).  Makes Naked Lunch look like a Disney film.

Otherwise, you've been forewarned.",1423267200,3,3740,4.777950310559007

7879760,5,6304963106,"After working on Easy Rider, Terry Southern began collaborating with Aram Avakian on an intense adaptation of John Barth's debut novel. Shot in the summer and fall of 1968, when America was reeling from assasinations, the quagmire of Vietnam, rioting and ideological meltdown, the resulting film transforms Barth's existential character study into a chilling, visually stunning critique of political, sexual and cultural dysfunction. If the film's reach sometimes exceeds its grasp, there is still much that astonishes in this rarely screened film: the superb acting by Stacy Keach, James Earl Jones, Dorothy Tristan and Harris Yulin; the feature film debut of legendary cinematographer Gordon Willis; the haunting opening montage that relate's the lead's typical boomer upbringing against the horrorshow of post-WWII history; the music supervised by jazz producer George Avakian; and last, but not least, the uncompromising visionary screenplay by Terry Southern, Aram Avakian and Dennis McGuire. If you are a big fan of such end-of-sixties films as Performance and Two-Lane Blacktop, this is definitely your cup of tea.",986860800,24,1121,5.6390532544378695
