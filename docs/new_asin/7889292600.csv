8324609,5,7889292600,"Ali-Baba et les 40 Voleurs (Ali-Baba and the 40 Thieves) cannot disappoint with Fernandel leading the adventure, an actor/genius whose face alone is worth 1000 words.  Breathtaking scenery is the background for a dramatic tale of daring-do, not to mention the belly dancers who may be considered prim by modern standards.  This film is perfect for students of any age learning French (language and culture); parental permission is perhaps necessary if dancing is deemed sinful.",1381795200,,477,5.346666666666667
