3555565,5,B001EL6E9U,"I have seen a lot of anime from a lot of different genre, and My-HiME stands out from the rest as one of the best anime I have seen.  I will not give away any details to make sure not to spoil anything, but this anime has it all.  It has teenage drama, action, mecha, lots of types of humor, really sad heartfelt moments, a great plot and really good character development.  It also has a great soundtrack that fits most scenes perfectly, from soothing piano, to fast paced technoish battle songs, to some eerie tracks that just add to certain moments.

Now for those of you who don't like mecha, this isn't typical mecha, the ones in here are companions to the girls called HiME, not battle suits like most anime of that genre.  While they do play a crucial role in the series, the series isn't centered around fighting, it's more about the emotion.

The series can be split into 3 sections.  The first 7 episodes might seem a bit slow moving, but this is good as this anime has a lot of characters.  These episodes each focus on a few of them so that the viewer gets to know a bit about them, get a feel for them and what they are like so that you will remember them as they appear later on. The story spends enough time with almost all the characters, and involves them with each other so that you actually want to know what happens to everyone, not just the ones that the story spends a bit more time with.

At episode 8, the anime dives deep into it's story.  It starts to get really involved with it's intense, somewhat dark plot full of lots of unexpected twists that'll keep you watching.

A little while later things really change, but I won't say any more about that.

Overall this anime was a perfect balance of everything for me.  I will admit that it has a few elements that some may not like (the ending being one of them), but it's impossible to please everyone.  I personally enjoyed My-HiME from beginning to end.  I call this anime one of those hidden gems because it never really got noticed here in North America, partly cause of the way it was released over here and the fact that they skipped the box set release after the single DVD's came out, waited two years, then released this Anime Legends box set.

I would also like to note that there is a an anime related to this.  It's called My-Otome.  I would not call it a sequel as it does not involve any of the events from this one, but for the most part all the same characters return with slightly different looks, some slightly different names, but in a more technologically advanced world with a whole new adventure.  Some call this an alternate world spinoff, but there are little easter eggs in the series and it's OVA sequel and prequel that suggest that it's far off in the future and that the main characters are distant descendants of the ones in My-HiME.  My-Otome has one big difference however in it's presentation.  While the returning characters retain their attitudes more or less in this series, most of the brand new characters have more immature and childish attitudes than in My-HiME.  It has a lot more silly and child-like humor which can get a bit annoying so that when the story gets serious way later on, you don't really have the same in-depth feel for each character.  The story isn't as dark in My-Otome either, which is good for itself because the transition from it's happy silly nature to a dark plot would be way too awkward of a change for the viewer.

Nevertheless My-Otome, it's sequel My-Otome Zwei, and prequel My-Otome 0 are all worth a watch.  Still I feel that even though the Otome series seems to be getting a lot more attention, My-HiME was still the better series in almost all aspects.",1224806400,17,3703,4.4423076923076925
3555566,5,B001EL6E9U,My-Hime at first was the typical girl with powers but as I came upon the second half of the series it got darker and things were revealed that I wasn't aware of. This is one of those sleeper hits that most anime enthusiast might bypass but its not. I highly recommend this title.,1224288000,,279,4.283018867924528
3555567,4,B001EL6E9U,"Every three centuries the powers that be draw twelve 'battle maidens' to the cursed land of Fuka where they fight each other using monstrous 'Children' to determine which is strongest. The strongest maiden, or Hime, will gain the power to control the Hime-Star which will otherwise devastate the Planet Earth. The weaker eleven will each lose that which is most precious to them, that is the person who is dearest to them.

If Mai-Hime is about anything it's about the choices you make and facing up to the consequences of them.

The time for the ritual combat has come around again and Mai Tokiha will be facing some unforeseen consequences to her decision to accept a scholarship for herself and younger brother Takumi at Fuka Academy just in time for the Hime Ritual.

If ever a series was served well by being presented in a box set, it's Mai-Hime. Initially slow-starting and a little unfocused, the plot is actually trying to make it through the necessary exposition to render all the 8 major Hime in sufficient detail that their brutal and uncompromising deconstruction is lent sufficient impact. Every weakness and emotional flaw is exposed as the contest continues, tenuous friendships and alliances are tested to the limit and each of their motivations and character are laid bare in stark clarity. Assessing the series based on the first four episodes simply doesn't provide you enough overview to judge it completely.

That said, Mai-Hime has some odd quirks that an informed buyer should be aware of. The shows plot initially suggests shojou anime, but the design of the characters and outfits and the amount of combat lands it squarely into Shounen territory. Fan service has been liberally sprinkled throughout the show, and especially during the midtro sections that introduce the next episode. Fine if you like that sort of thing, but a bit disturbing if you don't like your eyecandy underage.

Some of the characters are emotionally retarded in the finest sense of Highschool Anime and Manga, which may make more mature viewers roll their eyes. One can have too much adolescent awkwardness. They are otherwise sufficiently rounded characters that this necessary plot device stands out more than usual. The final 'frowny' point is the ending, where the writers seem to have flinched away from an unhappy conclusion to the tale at the last minute. Regrettable.",1224201600,2,2376,5.020304568527918
3555568,5,B001EL6E9U,"One of the best new animes to come out in recent years, MyHime (or Mai Hime) is a masterpiece of writing and animation.  Many anime series have pacing issues, episodes stuffed with filler to make the series longer - not this one.  The plot, which is rich, complex, and emotional, comes at the viewer at just the right pace.  Episodes are never wasted, although occasionally the writers attempt to lull the audience into a false sense of 'filler episode'.  Often, these episodes prove to be pivital to the plot, some major event happening during an otherwise calm or peaceful day.

Better still is the price.  Slimmed down from around $150.00 to collect the disks individually, this $50 set is well worth the price (especially when many 13 episode series sell for a similar price).

MyHime is one of those ""something for everyone"" animes, mixing mechs, mystic powers, and high-school romance in a fashion reminicent of classics like Escaflowne.  Give this series a chance and I promise it won't disappoint.",1222041600,3,1005,4.905325443786983
3555569,5,B001EL6E9U,I am so excited this anime is finally being released as a box set.  I didn't want to pay per disk. This is one of my favorite anime's and I have rented if from netflix several times but soon I will have my own copy and can watch it as many times as I want. The news of the box set has really made my day.,1221436800,3,304,3.606060606060606
3555592,4,B001EL6E9U,"Although this anime may seem to be geared more towards guys what with its large-breasted female heroines and action, I feel girls can still watch it to relate and for the romance. The packaging it came in was pretty good, the DVDs inside were also nice, but I feel like a book was meant to be a part of it, or perhaps that's just my mistake...either way it was brand new when I opened it so I guess not. I had only seen this anime once before (as in I hadn't really rewatched it) but I loved it, I watched episode after episode, almost addicted to it. But this anime has everything - confusion, action, drama, romance, you name it. I would recommend this to anyone but please watch it in the original Japanese, the English doesn't do it justice.

Also, I am currently watching My-Otome and I find it different and definitely a whole lot more confusing...even reading the Wikipedias doesn't cease my confusion. If anyone could cease it for me...haha",1282953600,,948,4.511627906976744
3555593,5,B001EL6E9U,"I absolutely loved this anime, and buying all the disks at once was so much easier than having to buy them individualy.",1281916800,,119,4.454545454545454
3555594,3,B001EL6E9U,"As much as I love this anime and have wanted to order for quite some time, I was disappointed with the product itself when I got it in the mail. Disc 4 and half of an episode on disc 7 do not work, no matter what I use to play them with.  While it says it is in great condition, it's evident either the item was tampered with or was damaged during shipment. Hopefully, getting the items resurfaced will make them work, though hopefully I won't be getting such mediocre merchandise next time I decide to place an order.",1281052800,,518,4.232323232323233
3555595,4,B001EL6E9U,"My-HiME fits the description of 'beautiful trainwreck' better than any other anime I've watched. It starts out as a high school slice-of-life series, with a lot of ecchi humour, even the 'monster of the week' battles providing far more in the way of amusement (a panty/bra stealing creature, for example) than danger. Then, in the last twelve episodes or so, the drama side gets going, which results in it turning into a less gruesome version of Battle Royale, with robots added on top. The two differing sections of the story do end up blending well together - the first part providing time for viewers to become attached to the characters - but it was certainly strange to see a light-hearted anime take such a dark turn...

If nothing else, you have to praise the visual and audio aspects of the series. It has lovely art and very good animation, the character designs (the faces, short skirts, big breasts and super model female cast) and bright colours unsurprisingly reminding me of Code Geass. The soundtrack is mostly stellar, too, with the music Goddess known as Yuki Kajiura pulling out one of her overall weaker (compared to her best work) but by no means poor collections of music. Even the English voice acting impressed me, Mai's voice fitting her fiery yet loveable and cute personality like a glove... However, where My-HiME falls short, and what makes me class it as a trainwreck, is its story.

Put simply, the story is about a group of twelve girls and their loved ones. Each of the twelve girls (referred to as 'HiME') has a different power, some being elemental and others being the ability to use weapons, and each can summon a mecha/monster (referred to as a 'Child' if it obeys a human and an 'Orphan' if it doesn't) to fight with them. Mai, the female lead, moves to the prestigious Fuka Academy (which accommodates elementary-high school ages, and has dormitories for both genders), along with her younger brother at the start, and there she meets and interacts with the other girls with powers and her new classmates.

Sadly, there isn't much actual plot covered in the 26 episodes. The first half focuses heavily on characterization, fan service and comical goings on. The second half focuses on characterization and battles, each battle resulting in a new death. In between all of this, not a lot beyond the basic premise of the story gets a look in. This resulted in very little of the plot making sense, and the final episode was a failure (partly) because of this.

Why were the 'Child' and 'Orphan' creatures in existence? How could they be summoned by certain people? What was the character reminiscent of Kaoru from Evangelion (Naji)? Why did the HiME ritual occur every 300 years?

None of the above questions, or numerous others I have, receive answers within the series. When the final episode rolled around and the world was saved from destruction in predictable fashion, I was left with a blank expression on my face, reflecting on the many questions without answers and with disappointment in the place of the answers I desired.

Apart from its production values, what saved My-HiME, for me at least, was the quality of its characterization. Over the course of the series, you learn all about Mai. Her relationship with her brother is explored and plays a major role, and as a result of an involving love quadruple I came to care about her as a person, as well as her likeable main love interest. And, though the other cast members didn't get anywhere near as much time because of the amount of them - the number reminding me of Negima's never-ending character list to begin with - enough of the personalities and back-stories of those that mattered got covered for me to become emotionally involved with many of them. The characters laughed and cried, and I was able to feel their emotions; never feeling disconnected.

But, switching back to the story, the final episode almost ruined the good that came before. If you're the sort of person that cringes when you see deus ex machina twists, your face won't be a pretty sight after finishing the anime because it's practically non-stop deus ex machina in the last episode. Without wanting to spoil too much, what happened at the end of My-HiME is equivalent to every emotional, heart-wrenching moment of a story being made worthless, destroying any attachment one has to the many moving scenes included. Even though I enjoyed what came before immensely, I felt like time slowed down at the end - it was a sad way to end such an absorbing title.

To sum it up, Sunrise know how to please anime fans; men/otaku in particular. They keep the skirts high, the chests large, the comedy amusing and are masters at pulling away at the heart strings of viewers with dramatic action, or just plain old fashioned drama. They know how to make up for what would normally by anime ruining flaws. If not for the poor excuse of a story and even worse attempt at an ending, if only for enjoyment alone, I'd be rating it higher, but it wasn't to be. Instead, I'll give it a solid 8/10, thinking of it as something of a guilty pleasure.",1258675200,6,5109,4.726150392817059
3555596,5,B001EL6E9U,"This Anime is a half and half. You start out getting to know the characters and funny outcomes they endure until the story reaches it's zenith and begins to show who's on who side for the second half of the series. The Story is well rounded and has a lot to offer, but it's not all about slapstick humor, there is really a touching side to it too.",1255910400,,347,4.117647058823529
3555597,4,B001EL6E9U,"Girls with miracle power forced to fight their destiny; this reminds me of Rozen Maiden(original+traumend), a far more creative show in several aspects. Being original doesn't always mean attracting more people, though.

It starts out ok and gets boring at the middle. It is easy-going amime, and relies on so many cliches you can find everywhere in amime world, especially in charactor settings; a cool hunk, a calm beauty, and a cute little girl in important posts in high school(surprise?),  brother/sister complex stereotypes, a girl
 almost fell into the wrong guy, etc..and I am PERSONALLY sick of finding a mysterious charactor watching every event from the rooftop.

But my patience finally paid off when I watched final 10 episodes. It gets more serious and enjoyable. There are good twists in both storyline and character developments.

Artwork here is not so special.

Someone mentioned that mechas are differnt from ordinary robot amimes, but don't expect something unique as Tachikoma(Ghost in the shell s.a.c). They are mixture of Japanese monsters and ""Ranger Series"" type of mecha, and one of monsters' heads is designed after Evangelion (not TV series, and seemingly not avarable in U.S. At least not in the box set) I would say, almost shamelessly. The creator probably tried to show some respect to Eva...I hope.

I found human characters were more interesting, despite of all the cliche.
Kuga is stylish, and Mai, the main charactor is somewhat realistic both in appearance and personality so I feel like she is much sexier than ""out-of-nowhere"" amime boobs.
She was one of the reasons I kept watching.

Music is nice (not to mention garbage songs), but failed to create its own world. It can go anywhere other than My-HiME. Some out of place, working better towards the end.

I also have a minor complaint about how to show emotions in each character. For instance, there is a moment one of the characters tells something shocking to Mai. You probably want to see Mai's face right at the moment the words were spoken, but instead, amime waits for the person to finish the line, then shows change in Mai's face, timing too late.

In some ways, this amime is similar to Shana; Monster hunting accompanied by another moster, not much deep thougts behind, (at least in its first half), not so great at emotional expressions, music out of place (Shana has better music,though) and you need to wait quite a while to get hooked.

If you like amime in genaral, however, you would probably like it, just like I did. A safer choice than Shana. I found love triangle was more interesting in Shana though.

And if you really want to enjoy the show,
you should probably forget about everything I said.

This is not going to be a waste for a amime fan.

Just in case, if you are looking for something little more thoughtful, I recommend Rozen Maiden, or watch both to compare.",1246147200,,2883,4.845213849287169
3555598,5,B001EL6E9U,"awesome snime flick with both good an bad mix in rather interesting rather long but well written the voices an art was super well worth buyin

3555600,5,B001EL6E9U,"My-HiME is, in my opinion, almost as good as Evangelion. The series is about a girl named Mai Tokiha trying to start a better life with her brother Takumi at the private school Fuka Academy. However, its difficult when you find out that you're a HiME, one of the battle princesses that must protect the school from monsters called Orphans. So much for a better life!!
The series mixes up almost every aspect of an anime; drama, romance, angst, action, yuri, suspected yaoi, death, and a little bit of fan service in between. (The extras after the credits)
This is one of the first anime that I found so emotional that I indeed shed a tear!! The portrayal of the characters are very good (both Japanese and English voice actors) and they were very convincing.
Every character in the series is connected, and every character develops throughout the series.
It DID start off a bit slow, but it went into its plot at the 5th or 6th episode. And it definitely became more serious and full of twists after episode 8. The ending may not be up-to-par for some people, but the series as a whole is AMAZING. One of the best in my opinion.
I reccomend this anime to anyone. I showed this anime to a person who thought he'd never get into it (my boyfriend) and now everytime he comes to my dorm room, and we have nothing to do. ""Lets Watch My-Hime!!""
A Hidden Gem of Anime.",1233446400,5,1361,4.448
3555601,5,B001EL6E9U,"Perhaps it's a little much to take in all at once, but My-Hime might be the coolest anime I've ever seen.

The series can certainly be criticized for dawdling too much with pointless side-quests and general goofiness. However, My-Hime's girls might be the stars of the show.

Each character possesses a special HIME power and a Child, a special robot, to protect themselves. Mai Tohika, the main character, uses it to defend her high school friends at Fuka Academy. She eventually teams up with Natsuki and Mikoto, a third-year student. They first fight Orphans, the monsters who attack the school.

However, as the story moves on, Mai and Natsuki discover the secrets of the First District Organization. Many of their goals remain a mystery, but they seem intent on reviving the Obsidian Prince. But the true gut punch comes when the HIMEs discover that if their Child dies, they risk losing something they love.

While it is very hard to explain the series without giving away the story, there is plenty of heartbreak in the series. Don't worry--everything gets wrapped up nicely. However, the series dwells on the dread of loss, of missing what they truely love.

And often, the characters have very little control over their emotions, making for some incredible fights with spinning giant swords, bows, spears and guns. True, all the characters end up emotionally exhausted, but Mai is probably one of the best female heroes, who manages to keep moving on, in spite of the deaths of many of her friends.

This series could easily be compared to Trigun, which featured just as much heartbreak. However, My-Hime also manages to soup up everything with bass-thumping techno music and some of the coolest fight scenes, with ships cut in half and plenty of big, big explosions. And at the same time, the characters are deeply intent on not fighting.

After a certain point, the entire school turns into a wasteland. The HIMEs' obsession with the people they love grows so overwhelming that they blow up nearly everything in sight. My-HIME makes for a great anime to watch after breaking up with a girlfriend or boyfriend. In fact, it's so good that it's my favorite anime to watch.

I just can't wait to watch the sequel series, My-Otome and My-Zhime.",1230681600,,2250,4.871727748691099

8298628,5,B001EL6E9U,"I love this show, it's got everything you want in thi series. Action, drama, romance, and a some sci-fi. I would recommend this series to everyone.",1416182400,,147,4.6923076923076925
8298629,4,B001EL6E9U,"This series was recommended to me because of my love for Clamp's ""X"" series; a similar scenario where high school kids with super powers fight to save the world.  My-Hime, however, is significantly lighter, and is filled with much more comical teen-drama than I was prepared for.  There's also a lot of playful, yet innocent sexual (actually, more sexist) moments that makes it quite obvious that the series was created by males.  Being a male myself, it certainly doesn't bother me but I can see how many females would feel like they are being objectified as silly dolls that blush at the very site of any guy (not many guys in this series after all)... however, this is anime after all, so I guess that's the norm.  There's also a lot of same gender 'love' amongst the females, however light.

At any rate, much of the first half of the series deals with crushes, high school drama, and getting to know the characters as they start to discover/use their powers.  The series takes a slightly darker turn during the latter half, and has some great action sequences.  For me the strength of this show is the creativity behind the character design and their respective ""child"" they summon for battle.  There are some really cool powers and creatures that come into play.  Natsuki (my favorite) for instance conjures up a cyber-dog named ""Duran"" who loads specific missile cartridges based on her command.  Meanwhile, Yukino Kikukawa summons ""Diana"" who's main power is to spread spores into the sky with video cameras to coincide with a bunch of viewing screens that surround her.  Though much of the drama is over-dramatic, you still begin to connect and feel for these kids, and in the end you'll enjoy the ride.  I was a bit disappointed with how it ends, and I won't spoil it with details, but I guess it should've been expected since this is a lighthearted series, and not as dark as others I've seen that would have a larger death count.

I was surprised that the series was only in 4:3 ratio being done around 2004, but nevertheless the artwork is beautiful.  If you want a good mix of comedy, action, and adolescent character development, My-Hime is worth checking out.",1374710400,,2175,4.71957671957672

It's great. The animation is pretty good and the voice acting isn't too bad either. What gives this series 5 stars is the story. It has very good characters and character development. You get attached to them very quickly and feel for them when the tragedies strike. Believe me there is a lot of tragedy in this story. It's technically a mecha anime I guess, but it's not conventional. The mecha aren't giant humanoid robots, nor are they the focus of the story the mecha are actually summoned by the Hime (princesses) to fight the demons that are after the ones they love. The demons are only a precursor to a giant plot that is very sinister and dark. While only one Hime can survive you won't want to let go of any of them. They are mostly just average girls with people they want to protect.

The show actually focuses on the story rather than action. I really like that despite that, during episodes lacking in action it's clear there's some action going on. It gives the feeling the monster-of-the-week type critters have more presence.

There's also much amusing humor although when the story gets more serious the dramatic parts are still interesting because the series develops the characters a lot & the audience can really invest in these people. That said I don't consider it as depressing at times as several other viewers have although it did at times feel somewhat sad.",1302307200,,776,5.0546875
