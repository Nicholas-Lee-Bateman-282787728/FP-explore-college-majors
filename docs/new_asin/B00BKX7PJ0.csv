They were shot in 1985, which is thirty years ago, and till this very day they will make an impression on anyone seeing them.  The fights are great to watch, but what really makes this film is the comedy part to it.  We have here five funny guys, all friends from a police force...and they are all funny-in-a-goofy-kind of way.  They reminded me of the Three Stooges and three guys from Lemon Popsicle franchise...especially when they were trying to get with the women, their innovative tricks (like the one with the fire or their fighting) --seeing it--- was like watching Benny, Huey and Bobby in action -- all over again.

The only thing--- I did not like---- was that the subtitles were in white color and it was difficult to read them, since they will blend-in with the rest of the light setting, and on top of that they will appear and disappear quickly do to the fact that Cantonese is spoken-out rapidly. So if you don't mind reading subtitles at fast rate...go a head and watch this film...because it is the funniest Hong Kong action comedy I have ever laid my eyes on.
