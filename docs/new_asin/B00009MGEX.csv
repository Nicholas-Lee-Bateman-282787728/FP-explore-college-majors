7991632,5,B00009MGEX,"This whole series is awesome if weird, in that ""it's just anime"" way. The series has the slightest lesbian flavor that might make it uncomfortable for a few (or really hot for others!), but it really is slight. I recommend it for beautiful characters and a plot that is twisty and odd.",1509926400,,285,4.5
7991633,5,B00009MGEX,"In this volume, the first in the APACOLYPSE SAGA, the final season of REVOLUTIONARY GIRL UTENA, Ruka, Juri's old fensing captain, comes to the school, and the number one thing on his agenda is dueling Utena to find out about her true power. Along the way, he manipulates Shiori, a friend of Juri's, into falling in love with him, (being the handsome ladie's man that he is,) only to trample on her feelings later. I never thought there would be a character on this show I would come to hate more than Anthy's origonal ""groom"", but now I do. This guy really deserves to be utterly humiliated.

The first episode on this disk is my favorite. I have a favorite episode for each season of UTENA, all of them are more comedy-centered rather than serious. In the first season it's the episode where Utena and Anthy switch personalities, in the BLACK ROSE SAGA it's where Nanami gets an enchanted cow bell that begins to turn her into the animal it's usually worn by. Here my favorite episode is ""Nanami's Egg"". Nanami wakes up one morning to find an easter egg laying in her bed, and she starts freaking out, thinking she laid it. (It never occurs to her that just maybe Koga planted it there as a joke.) It's really funny to see Nanami go from being shocked and dreadful at the thought of doing something so unnatural, to suddenly developing maternal and protective feelings twords the egg. It also shows us a side of Nanami we haven't seen before.

If you liked the series so far, you won't be disapointed.",1119484800,,1502,4.538745387453875
