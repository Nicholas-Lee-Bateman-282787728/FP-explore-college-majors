8553306,5,B00ALFER1M,"I like workouts that are hard but do-able and this one definitely took me to the edge, especially a couple of the abs parts at the end. I also liked how it has some unique moves that challenge my body in new ways. She does some nice little twists and tweaks to work every little muscle all around those big ones.  It has a nice flow, works the entire body, and the ladies in the background are GORGEOUS so that is inspiring, I'd love to get those results!  The music was upbeat and not too loud - nice compliment to the pulsing parts. I liked the transitions and the stretching after major work segments flowed nicely.  She did a good job cueing little things to keep aware of for form and/or adapting for advanced/easier levels. The 66 minutes went by pretty fast (though some of the reps did not feel they were ever going to end because she keeps adding a new tweak saying ""almost there...""  LOL, yeah, right!)  You need light weights (2-4lb) and an 8 inch ball is used as well as a bar or chair.  Great workout!",1456444800,2,1014,4.310526315789474
8553307,5,B00ALFER1M,I found the time to pass very quickly during this workout.  It is harder than other barre workouts I've done.  I would say it is advanced but the instructor offers modifications which were very helpful.  It was an enjoyable workout and Kristin was a great instructor.,1390953600,,267,4.760869565217392
8553308,2,B00ALFER1M,"I borrowed this from the library and I'm really glad I didn't waste my money on it. It's just okay and not good enough to make it into my regular rotation.

Positives:
The music is pretty good
The instructor is good at cuing/setting up exercises
Visually appealing set

Negatives:
The hip flexor work is ridiculous. There is so much of it and my hips were so sore. Who wants buff hip flexors?
The music to speaking ratio was off at times. Sometimes the music was too loud and I couldn't hear the instructor, and visa-versa.
I felt there was extreme arm and ab work and not enough thigh and seat work. Especially thighs since working those large muscle groups burns the most calories.
For an hour workout, I expect a better burn and some more sweating",1389139200,3,750,4.507352941176471
8553309,5,B00ALFER1M,"There are many DVD's covering the barre fitness workout method and I must say, The Ballet Physique delivers! They have carved out a unique niche that surpasses other styles and franchises. Kristen Z. and Kristen S. have formulated precise, challenging and fun choreography that will get you shaking and sweating in no time. The workouts are easy to follow but don't let the seamless flow fool you! These workouts are HARD but you will be thanking them later! I love how during a tough sequence they use fun anecdotes and reminders how the hard work pays off! Both instructors are down to earth and are wonderful examples of the what they are teaching. Do yourself a favor and buy these DVD's you will not be sorry and will definitely be thanking the ladies of The Ballet Physique. If you are in the Denver area, their classes are NOT to be missed!",1384646400,2,847,4.6158940397351
8553310,2,B00ALFER1M,"I seem to be in the minority, but I was really disappointed with Signature Sculpt. The hip flexion work was relentless and really kills my hip flexors (as in, they ached for days afterwards), and Kristen and the background exercisers are rather fake-plastered-on-smiles Stepford Wives. Kristen's cueing was often a little behind, and she relies on you knowing your ballet terms (and therefore your body positioning) without really giving enough positional cues herself.

The production values are really great, but that doesn't make up for the weird things Kristen says at times.
