4910726,5,B005ZKCG3E,"Excellent 1950's TV police drama. Also shows a lot of Las Vegas back in the day.
I like Rod Cameron and think he was actually a good actor, very believable and did his own stunts.
Enjoy this DVD set!",1338163200,,199,4.128205128205129
4910727,5,B005ZKCG3E,"Wonderfule series, similiar to Highway Patrol for those that are familiar with that.  A story of Rod Blake, Nevada state patrol that investigates crimes throughout the state of Nevada.  Many name actors will pop up in here as characters.  Great old cars to look at as well.  If you like the 50s and the shows produced then, you will not be disappointed.",1332892800,,353,4.645161290322581
4910728,5,B005ZKCG3E,"Rod Cameron was a tall, rugged, everyman. You could really believe he as the State Trooper who was ever vigilant and diligent in helping the local authorities to solve cases that needed that something extra provided by what amounted to State Troopers or Super investigators (much like the modern NCSI et al.) Not to detract a thing from this excellent show that Amazon kindly brought to me (I was only 3 when it came out) but it is like a television incarnation of the radio show Texas Rangers. I had discovered that little gem by accident. I almost didn't listen because I thought it was a western. NOTHING could be further than the truth. It too concerned a special State Ranger office of highly trained experts who came to the aid of the local sheriffs and police when a case was a bit to hard for them. Also,in the same vein is the excellent M Squad with Lee Marvin as part of an Elite Chicago Police Detective force who aids the local police in tougher cases. What is the connection you ask? Besides the highly entertaining format and premise being in common, radio script writer Lawrence Kimble wrote many of these stories 1st for the radio show Texas Rangers and then adapted them to M Squad and State Trooper. You will get a sense of deja vu when you realize you recognize the story. But that just makes it all the more fun!

Wonderful show and highly entertaining with a credible actor who really makes you believe he is what he portrays-- a rough and tumble Lawman out to right wrongs and get his man....or woman as the case may be. Kudos to Amazon for providing this rare gem. I highly recommend it. Oh, and if I may say one thing more...check out Tales of the Wells Fargo for a similar treat. 'Nuff said.",1332028800,4,1716,4.464968152866242
4910729,5,B005ZKCG3E,"Rod Cameron is one of my favorite western stars beside of Randolph Scott, Joel McCrea,Ben Johnson and John Wayne. Despite starring in other movie genres (drama, policial, adventure and even comedy and musical) was in the western that was his body of work and his greatest popularity. The series ""State Trooper"" made for TV was the most popular of the three which he starred, the others were ""City Detective"" and ""Coronado 9"", because it is a mix of western and policial. Besides the always remarkable presence of Rod Cameron other actors, who later gained fame, are featured in each episode such as Lee Van Cleef, De Forrest Kelley, Doug McClure, Craig Stevens, Claude Akins, Michael London, Carolyn Jones, Amanda Blake and Mike Connors and many others. All 108 episodes maintains the same level of quality. My rating is five stars.",1328486400,11,832,4.95
4910730,5,B005ZKCG3E,"I wasn't born until late 1958, so I have no recollection of this show when it aired, nor have I ever seen it in syndication at any time. In fact, I never even knew who Rod Cameron was until I ordered this show. It sounded interesting and since my sister has lived in western Nevada since the early 70's, I do have some knowledge of the area in which a lot of scenes are filmed. When I bought Season 1, I was shocked at just how fast I zoomed through the 39 (I believe) episodes. I looked online at the history of the show to see that there were two seasons after the initial one, so I tracked down Season 2 and 3 and have enjoyed them just the same.

First, the quality of the video on this two season set is par with the first one and is Average to Good. There are some drops in audio at times but nothing to distract from enjoying the episodes. I've read in the other review here that there was some trimming of the episodes and I do remember seeing some fades at certain points, but there has never been anything to distract, nor make me believe that the story content was ruined. The stories range from really great to just mediocre, but what I find compelling about this show is that each story always holds my attention, even though the outcome may be a letdown, I'm always satisfied. The acting is also much better than I expected and from time to time there is a familiar face that shows up in an episode.

Overall, if you like classic television and like shows that are kind of ""off the wall"" or not too well known, and you like a Dragnet-esque type of show, I highly recommend ""State Trooper"".

On the heels of finishing this set, I ordered Rod Cameron's ""Coronado 9"" series that followed this one in 1960, in hopes that I get just as much enjoyment.",1326412800,26,1760,4.2477611940298505
4910731,4,B005ZKCG3E,"I HAVE PURCHASED QUITE A FEW OF TIMELESS MEDIA PRODUCTS AND STILL HAVE THE SAME COMPLAINT,  ALTHOUGH THE PICTURE AND SOUND QUALITY ON THIS SET IS GOOD , THEY CONTINUE TO TRIM AT LEAST 2 MINUTES FROM EACH EPISODE, THEY ORIGINALLY RUN 25 TO 26 MINUTES AND THESE ARE DOWN TO 24 AND ONE HALF MINUTES.

EITHER THEY CUT THE INTRO WITH ROD CAMERON STARTING THE SHOW, OR A QUICK FADE AT 13 MIN THE COMMERCIAL BREAK,  AND A TRIMMING AT THE END OF THE EPISODE WITHOUT ROD CAMERON SAYING SEE YOU NEXT WEEK,  AND THE END CREDITS END ABRUPTLY. I HAVE A FEW ON 16 MM FILM COMPLETE.

I FEEL TO ALL CUSTOMERS,  THAT TIMELESS MEDIA SHOULD BE ABLE TO STOP CROWDING A DVD WITH 10 EPS TO MAKE 6 DVDS WHEN FOR A FEW MORE DVDS THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO LEAVE THE SHOWS INTACT. THE WORST SET IS M-SQUAD,  MY FAVORITE.

I SORRY FOR IF I AM SLAMMING TIMELESS MEDIA, BUT DO IT PROFESSIONALLY. I THINK THERE ARE OTHER CUSTOMERS THAT WILL AGREE WITH ME.  I HOPE IN THE FUTURE THEY WILL READ THESE COMMENTS AND REALIZE FOR THE PRICE , THEY CAN DO IT RIGHT.

MILL CREEK CAN PUT AN ENTIRE SERIES OUT FOR HALF THE COST AND ALL IS COMPLETE WITH THERE'S. THANK YOU FOR VIEWING MY COMMENTS B. BERTRAND",1326240000,25,1162,4.124444444444444

4910735,5,B005ZKCG3E,"Have the 1st season and I love it.  This was a great TV show and Rod Cameron is perfect in the part.
This show being film during the late 50,s show so much of Nevada and Lake Tahoe the way it was back then.",1378857600,,206,3.6818181818181817
4910736,5,B005ZKCG3E,Just a great old time TV show and the cars just bring back good memories even memories when we had a good president..,1376524800,2,117,4.130434782608695
4910737,5,B005ZKCG3E,I love this old tv show which is the stories of the Nevada Sheirffs department over the state havig Rod Cameron playing the chief investigator for the Nevada State Troopers telling the story and assisting the different  sheriffs departments. It is a good police show and I would recommend it to anyone that likes crime dramas.,1374278400,,326,4.821428571428571
4910738,5,B005ZKCG3E,I grew up in this era and wanted to relive some of those days through this purchase.  It was a great deal from start to finish!,1364169600,,127,3.8846153846153846
4910739,4,B005ZKCG3E,"I am a big fan of these old 50'-60's cop shows. The stories are good though sometimes really formulaic ,prints are decent enough. Addicting show but the main complaint is the endings are way too abrupt which is really the only complaint. For the price this is still a must own set and is great to lounge back watching a few episodes at a time on a lazy weekend morning with coffee and donuts.",1360022400,,392,4.3108108108108105
4910740,5,B005ZKCG3E,"This is a ""sleeper"" program.  I expected corny stories and fake Vegas film footage.  This is the real deal, filmed all over the state of Nevada.  Probably the most Vintage Vegas footage (1956-59)in one package.  Life was better in Black & White.  Writen by a 53 year Vegas resident",1348617600,8,281,4.653061224489796
4910741,4,B005ZKCG3E,"If there's a crime in 1950s Nevada that needed to be investigated, that's where such sheriffs like Andy Anderson and others call on one Mr. Rod Blake, chief investigator for the Nevada State Troopers. Rod Cameron stars in ""State Trooper"", the complete seasons two and three. Blake gets deep into investigating those tough cases, involving ranchers, miners, gamblers, showgirls, convicts, and murder, and you wouldn't want to mess with Rod, cause he'll get you with his fists if try to fight him, because he's one tough lawman in the contemorary west of 1950s Nevada. The picture and sound quality is okay for such an old show, but the pilot episode ""Rodeo Rough House"" is in rough shape, quite obviously a bootleg from a collector, so what, it is a fine period piece of a crime drama, so pick up one if you want it!",1344211200,4,815,4.666666666666667
8489734,4,B005ZKCG3E,"I wasn't around when these episodes originally aired and had really not heard much about them.  This is low-budget 50s TV but it is fun to watch.  Many of the episodes have the flavor of film noir in the desert.  If you like ""Highway Patrol"" with Broderick Crawford, you will probably like this series.  It is fun to see Las Vegas in the 50s before it was a national tourist trap.  For some reason, Rod Cameron reminds me of Ronald Reagan.",1454544000,,439,4.37037037037037
8489735,4,B005ZKCG3E,quite good.,1436140800,,11,5.0
8489736,5,B005ZKCG3E,"These are terrific stories in a quality DVD set.

If you want the entire series, grab it here on Amazon. At the time of purchase, the entire series cost less than buying Season One and Seasons Two & Three separately.

When I purchased this, I thought it was just the second season. I bought the entire series for $10, thinking I would get the third season, too. Then, I discovered I already had it!

If you want similar shows, check out Highway Patrol with Broderick Crawford.",1416182400,,476,4.511627906976744

8489740,5,B005ZKCG3E,The good guys always win....in about twenty minutes.  The bad guys throw in the towel and acknowledge defeat without any pesky backtalk or guff.  Way to go!  Good clean fun in the monochrome atmosphere of 1950s television.  Rod Cameron is my favorite.  If you like these then be sure to check out Coronado 9.  You won't be disappointed.,1403481600,,336,4.706896551724138
8489741,5,B005ZKCG3E,A police show that tells stories strait from the headlines definitely the first that I know of to do that with many others to follow. I very much enjoyed this show and think everybody would enjoy it as well.,1400112000,,207,4.333333333333333
8489742,4,B005ZKCG3E,Well written TV series for the 50's. Good quality video. Interesting story themes. Well acted and directed by quality people I'm front of and behind the camera.,1399248000,,160,4.962962962962963
8489743,5,B005ZKCG3E,Definitely worth a look and really interesting and different story lines as opposed to the same old you receive with some shows. Justice 1950's style.,1391817600,,150,5.04
