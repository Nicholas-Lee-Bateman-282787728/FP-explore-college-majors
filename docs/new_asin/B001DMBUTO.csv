8294160,4,B001DMBUTO,"For simplistic comedy, Johnny Bagpipes is an excellent model for having fun with the bagpipes (I am a retired bagpiper with the Medinah Highlander Bagpipes and Drums Band).  I have watched individual episodes of Johnny Bagpipes via YouTube and have greatly enjoyed him.  The album (DVD) was a gift fpr our After the Holiday gift exchange at our bagpipes and drums band earlier this month.  Therefore, I am unaware of the skits that are included in this Johnny Bagpipes DVD.  I do, however, highly recommend Johnny Bagpipes DVD's to any one interested in listening to bagpipes.",1391126400,,576,4.96875
