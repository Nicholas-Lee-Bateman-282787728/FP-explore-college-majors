8170825,3,B000MQ4WOM,"Danny is a struggling actor (Adam Baratta). His friend Stuart (Shane Edelman) has a rich uncle producer who is out of town. Danny and Stuart go out on the town borrowing his uncle's belongings. While out, they pick up a seductive woman (Kari Wuhrer) who swipes Uncle Manny's Rolex. They need to get the watch back before Uncle Manny comes home.

The film sounds like a 1980's formula comedy...and it is. What the film lacks is originality and comedy. It was overrated with 5 best comedy awards and 2 best feature awards. The acting was bland. Adam Baratta who wrote and directed this film was the worse.

Parental Guide: F-bomb. No sex. Rear nudity (Kari Wuhrer or double)",1361577600,6,672,4.686440677966102
8170826,5,B000MQ4WOM,"The only reason I purchased this video is because it features my favorite actress - Kari Wuhrer.  To be honest, I will purchase any movie that features Kari.  Consequently, I cannot speak for the quality of the movie.  To be honest, I am not a movie fan, just a Kari fan.",1356652800,,271,4.2745098039215685
8170827,1,B000MQ4WOM,"I don't know if the movie is any good since I turned it off after a minute or so. It's a widescreen film squeezed into a full-frame box so you get letterboxing and pillarboxing with a miniature picture in the middle, and, if you enlarge it, the quality is so poor it's unwatchable. It made me wonder what you would wind up with if you turned a troop of baboons loose in a DVD factory. A pity, since Kari Wuhrer is always interesting.",1276041600,11,433,4.228915662650603
8170828,3,B000MQ4WOM,"I was hoping this was going to be funny but it's not.

It doesn't even have moments of being funny.

The fact that the Video encoding was terrible didn't help.",1222819200,14,159,4.266666666666667
