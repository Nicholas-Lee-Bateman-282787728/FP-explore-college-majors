8074130,4,B000A3MN3Y,"i got this from Chuck a few years ago and wished that i would have been interviewed for it, it is an amazing documentary of a singular day in the rock history of Portland, Oregon and as we see just another stop on The Beatles amazing ride. i attended the afternoon show with my sister & brother.even if you had footage and audio from the show, i doubt you'd hear the music, the screams were deafening. this is maybe more for the hard core Beatles fan or rock historian, but what a great labour of love. it totally takes me back to that day and the day's of excitement leading up to the show(s). if you want to see pure unadulterated ""Beatlemania"" this is it, and the fact that The Beach Boys (most of them) flew up to Portland to meet them even though The Beatles would be in Hollywood within a matter of days is a cool trivia nugget. i would get this if you're a real Beatles fan.",1268092800,,881,4.188235294117647

8074132,1,B000A3MN3Y,"If you lived in Portland I guess it's OK but for the rest of you, save your money and buy one of the concerts available on DVD.",1157328000,3,127,3.740740740740741
8074133,3,B000A3MN3Y,Definitely for those who like seeing others experiencing Beatlemania.  Being an avid fan of the Beatles I am all too familiar with this mindset.  I prefer to actually see performances of the fab four.  In that reguard this is a collectors item which will spend more time in the collection archives than in ones DVD player.,1149379200,6,322,4.714285714285714
8074134,5,B000A3MN3Y,"Here's a totally interesting DVD about The Beatles in Portland, Oregon.  It has all the feelings and emotions of the August 1965 Portland Coliseum show.  This DVD takes you to the concert.  From the opening acts to the Beatles departure, it doesn't skip a beat. Two color-printed dvds come in a colorful plastic box. Nice quality and a naturally flowing story line make this Beatles Rocumentary a MUST HAVE for your Beatles DVD collection. A fine journalistic effort. You've heard everything about The Beatles. -- But what about their Portland show? Absolutely cool.",1136505600,2,566,5.064516129032258
8074135,5,B000A3MN3Y,"One week to the day after the Beatles' first appearance at Shea Stadium, the Fabs regaled many in Portland on Sunday, August 22, 1965.

As much as I loved the Beatles' concert, I also enjoyed hearing what fortunate attendees had to say about their Portland performance.  No Beatle fan should be without this gem.  Each section of the program is well marked on the dvd; viewers get to travel with the Beatles.

In addition to this excellent footage, you get treated to a bonus dvd and a plethora of information.  Gear up that 1963 Ford Falcon and fly to the 1965 Beatles' concert in Portland, Oregon!",1136332800,3,599,4.613207547169812
8074136,4,B000A3MN3Y,"Chuck's done a very impressive job of reporting here.  Very detailed, thoroughly researched lots of never-before-seen artifacts, rare images, interviews.  It doesn't contain the newly found home film of the Portland performance(s), but then again, that's not available anywhere yet.  I definitely recommend it to my Beatle friends in Oregon and any Beatles historians.  Its very impressive.",1135555200,5,390,5.7894736842105265
8074137,5,B000A3MN3Y,"I first saw this documentary on Oregon Public Broadcasting in August of 2005.  When I saw it listed on Amazon I had to buy it.  This film is the best demonstration I have seen of what BEATLEMANIA was really like!  While watching this 2 hour show you never know what is going to come up next.  There are some great interviews with fans that describe the Beatles performance on stage.  Some accounts are very moving to watch. These fans express genuine emotion in this film.  The still photographs are amazing and the editing very smooth and well thought out.  This is a quality production.  very different from the usual ""History of The Beatles"" rehash DVDs on the market.  This 2 DVD set is packed with lots of information for the price!",1133481600,6,737,4.564885496183206
