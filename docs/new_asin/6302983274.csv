525817,5,6302983274,"Christopher Durang's off-Broadway play BEYOND THERAPY was a triumph, and Durang himself worked with director Robert Altman to bring it to the screen.  The result is a truly remarkable film--beautifully played by a first-rate cast, quick paced, provocative, romantic, and very, very funny.
Unlike some Altman films, BEYOND THERAPY offers a traditional storyline.  When Prudence and Bruce (Julie Hagerty and Jeff Goldblum) meet for a blind date the result is disasterous--not surprising, when Bruce casually notes that he is bisexual and living with lover Bob (Christopher Guest.)  Prudence and Bruce rush back to their therapists (Tom Conti and Glenda Jackson, respectively) for advice... but their therapists are nuttier than they are, and soon they, Bob, Bob's mother Zizi (Genevieve Page), and the entire waitstaff of a French restaurant are dragged into the fray.
Durang's adaptation of his script is absolutely hilarious, and so many memorable lines (""My mother is NOT a transvestite!"") bounce through the film that the effect--particularly when coupled with Altman's ""wall of sound"" audio style--is absolutely dizzying; the sound design is also memorable for the constant car crashes and china shattering that occurs in the background, a metaphor for collision of characters happening before our eyes.  The entire cast is absolutely first rate (Hagerty, Goldblum, and Guest have never been better), and Altman guides them with a very sure hand.
Altman's vision always divides viewers: you either like his films or you do not.  Although BEYOND THERAPY offers a relatively small cast in a cohesive story, it is actually one of Altman's most visually and aurally kaliediscopic films, and it is unlikely to convert those who find his style confusing and frustrating.  But that said, this is a must-have film for any Altman fan, a truly enjoyable romantic comedy with a razor sharp script and a joyous style.  A great shame that this VHS is out of print and there is no DVD release!  Strongly, strongly recommended.",1019088000,18,2015,5.275
525818,5,6302983274,"Beyond Therapy is a truly hilarious movie, but a demanding one.  You've gotta be willing to watch and LISTEN carefully.  There's SO much going on so much of the time - and Altman mercilessly adds to the confusion with car-crashes and dish-smashes in the background to highlight the mental chaos of his characters.  I can understand how many people would just give up on this movie, missing a cumulative experience that always leaves me laughing.  Definitely NOT for viewers who need slow-moving, clear-talking Murder She Wrote-type video ""action"", but if you can keep up, you'll find Beyond Therapy a little gem of a movie. And, certainly, it would help if you have a somewhat bizarre sense of humor.",1013040000,8,700,4.906779661016949
525925,4,6302983274,"How did this wild black comedy ever get made?  It surely died at the box office, despite the great cast.  In any case, this film is for people who would also, perhaps, enjoy ""Little Murders"" and ""Harold and Maude.""  The story is a first rate rip of homosexuality and the shrinks who often treat the ""disturbed."" This may be the most politically incorrect movie of the 1980s (it was filmed in Paris) and you'll never see it on television. Oh yes, the movie is also very funny---for the handful of people (I'm one of them) who enjoy extraordinarily black comedy.",1236470400,2,560,4.58
525926,5,6302983274,"Let's go to Paris, though it could be anywhere, in any big metropolis of the end of the 20th century, or maybe the beginning of the 21st century. Let's have a bunch of people, boys and girls, men and women, all going through therapy, I mean psychoanalytical therapy, with two doctors, a man and a woman, who are the links between them all. They all are disturbed in their sexual identification not because something is wrong with them, though the women are nymphomaniac and the men are all in between straight and gay, where the two meet, exactly where the straight line bends just before breaking. That situation has been used so often by Woody Allen that we may think Altman is making a farcical parody or a fanciful remake. But you would be wrong to think so. There would have been no reason to go to Paris then. In fact the farce is a satire, a twofold double entendre satire. The satire of all the comedies we get on the big screen that try to sound dramatic and are pathetic, those melodramatic comedies that are supposed to make us both cry and laugh and often manage none or neither. That is an easy satire, the easy level of the satire. The second level is targeting the modern middle class in western societies. They have become dead, uncreative, totally obsessed by themselves, just some dead corpses perambulating in the street that we have forgotten to  bury last time they opened the gates of the cemetery. At this level the satire becomes cruel with those self-satisfied baboons we call the middle class who are essentially un-occupied, in one other word idle, and they have to spend and waste their time the same way they spend and waste the money they don't even spend any energy to make. They buy some kind of trinkets for themselves that have to be expensive and time consuming though harmless and useless. That's what psychoanalysts are all about: the circulation of a lot of money in a lot of empty time that gives you the illusion of being so busy that you get giddy and dizzy. I must say it is well done but after a while it gets to shallow to really fascinate my weary eyes.

525927,3,6302983274,"This may not be the best film in the history of cinema, but it is one of my alltime favorites.  You get the feeling that much of the dialog was mafe up as it went along and like other Robert Altman films there are frequently several people talking at once and it can be a bit difficult to follow.  It doesen't matter, the whole plot is crazy start to finish and charactors are all over the top.  This is not your typical romantic comedy, watch with an open mind and you may just love this!!",1203811200,3,490,4.136842105263158
525928,2,6302983274,"Ok, ok.  I read reviews thru IMDB, etc which warned me that the '80s film version of this strange play was plodding, boring, plodding and plodding.  But reviews aren't always right, right?  And maybe my tastes are different (read: more sophisticated, of course) than the reviewers.

Uh, no.  Reviews were spot on.  This version of a wonderfully twisted play is dull, boring and boring.  And boring, too.  Julie Haggerty's usual characterization of an indecisive, insecure, ditzy woman is tolerable for about 15 minutes.  Jeff Goldblum does some interesting things, but gets tiring by movie's half.

An interesting supporting cast adds some flavor, but ultimately fails.  The slapstick moments were reminiscent of Noises Off!...another play that made a WONderful transition to film with John Ritter and Carol Burnett.

If your local theatre is performing the play, see it there instead. This play can be interpreted a million ways, and it's fun seeing what each acting company/director will do with it.  But as for the movie version - SKIP IT - it's a crazy, flawed piece of writing that was not enhanced in film.",1178755200,,1112,5.043956043956044

525930,4,6302983274,"This lesser known and probably watched Christopher Guest (Spinal Tap, Waiting for Guffman, A Mighty Wind, Best in Show...), in a supporting role, with stars Julie Hagarty, a respected British Member of Parliament and Jeff Goldblum is a camp fest (that means funny!).  Every neurosis and phobia is spotlighted in a tale revolving on a woman's deep denial and a man's denial of self and other relationships.  The initial meeting of Bruce's new girlfriend (Prudence) and his live-in boyfriend/roommate (Bob) will have you rolling on the floor with hilarious laughter.

You'll be confused from the opening scene to the last credit but you'll be laughing so much at the lunancy (to borrow a phrase) that it will hardly be noticed.

Is it Paris, or NYC?",1173571200,2,747,4.952
525931,3,6302983274,"All the ingredients were there to make this movie great, but somehow when they all mixed together the taste was bland.",1171497600,,118,4.666666666666667
525932,1,6302983274,"I bought this movie because it was (somewhat) by Christopher Durang, and it is positively the very last time I'll buy a DVD without renting and seeing it first.  I liked ""Sister Mary..."" (the script, I know there's a film out there somewhere with Dianne Keaton in it, ALL of it written by Durang, but alas it is not on DVD, I very much want to see it).  But ""Beyond Therapy.""  One good thing I can say for it is the interesting way the chaos and seemingly disparate actions and characters come together (congeal?) into something coherent.  But I only laughed twice.  Once at the beginning when Prudence drops her magazines and screams a cussword (must be decent, mustn't say the naughty word) at the guy who runs off with them.  And once when Bob is lying on the therapist's sofa with a child's fuzzy puppet on his right hand and starts to cry and takes a Kleenex with the hand with the puppet on it.  Other than that the most I can say is that it was interesting, hardly funny, NOT Durang that I remember (I've read the play), and the color of the film was kind of dark and blackish, like it had been dipped in soot.  I do not recommend this flick to anyone.  However.  A lot of people liked it, so I guess it's a question of taste.",1078790400,2,1233,4.275862068965517
525933,1,6302983274,"I don't think I've seen a worse screen version of a stage play than this one.
Christopher Durang and Robert Altman have very different styles and senses of humor, which come together in this movie like the Titanic and the iceberg, sinking the whole enterprise.  Durang is direct and over the top; his characters constantly surprise us with their emotional zigzags and unpredictable comments.  Altman likes his actors underplaying much of the time while offscreen chattering and noises distract viewers from the dialogue.  Jokes, motives, and plot points all get lost in the buzz.
Some of the actors are so badly miscast that no one's direction could have helped.  Jeff Goldblum is more creepy, obnoxious, and arrogant than neurotic.  And what's with Tom Conti's outrageous accent?  He doesn't normally talk like that, and the character isn't written like that.
The play is episodic enough that it should translate well to the screen.  I can only hope that some director whose style is more compatible with Durang's will film it again.",1053820800,8,1034,5.047058823529412
525934,5,6302983274,"I am convinced that European Art Movies and psychotherapy are amongst the many ideas being satirized here. And what a hilarious send-up! The gaggle of dowager duchesses frantically fanning themselves in the French restaurant and the antics of the two psychologists are absolutely priceless. Brilliantly designed and shot, this film is a strange and often wonderful excursion into the world of neurosis and manages to delight, disturb and engross the viewer at the same time.
