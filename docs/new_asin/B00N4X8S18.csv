6609810,5,B00N4X8S18,"the matches he loses a completely understandable on why they made the dvd, first to Austin but he needed Kane to help Taker looking strong next he was DQ for hitting the big show with a bat, at the time Taker was a heel. and last in two on one match where they were making Orton the next super star in the wwe. each match has danger in the match and belong on the list even if Taker lose a few. I only question why there is no HBK vs Taker in the first hell in a cell and I also understand why Mankind v Taker cell match didn't make it cause it is on so many other wwe dvd sets",1451433600,,577,3.7768595041322315

6609820,5,B00N4X8S18,"Another solo DVD of the Phenom, the Undertaker, and I guess the first thing that may stick out is how a big part of Taker's career--the period from the year 2000 to 2003--is glossed over. Of course, that was when the Undertaker had abandoned the ""Undead Phenom"" part of his career and became ""Biker-Taker."" Interesting that WWE chose to gloss over a big chunk of the Dead Man's career & I know he had some great matches during that time.

All that being said, this is still what I would say is a very good collection of Undertaker matches--and another thing that may stick out to a viewer of this DVD collection is how many of these matches Taker actually lost, i.e., the ""Body Bag"" match that opens the collection on Disc 1.

The best quality of matches though, imo, happens when we get to Disc 3--matches with Mr. Kennedy, Batista, and maybe the match that surprised me most, the ""Hell in a Cell"" confrontation with Edge. And I say surprised because I had forgotten how great that match was. Edge really took the fight to the Dead Man, hitting him with about 3 spears & some great spots--perhaps my favorite being the chokeslam through 2 tables.

I would go so far as saying it was one of the best HIAC matches I've seen the Dead Man in--and yes, I would say it was even better than the Cell match with Mankind.

Overall--if you're an Undertaker fan--then you really don't need me to tell you to buy this DVD.

6609840,2,B00N4X8S18,"The matches themselves are ok. They feature far too many poor, modern matches and ignore all of his classic attitude era ones, Which there was a bit of a lacking of.

The video quality is fine but the audio quality is really weak and no where near up to the standards it should have been. For example, Just before the second match on disc 1, Paul Bearer was cutting a promo and you couldn't even hear what he was saying. I had to blast my TV just to hear him.

Overall, 5 dollars it's ok but if I had paid any more for it, I think I'd want my money back. It's just not that good of a collection and it's definitely one to pass on.",1399766400,,630,3.992063492063492

The match selection is a variety of UT's in ring work from various eras, and WWE actually put some matches in the mix that we don't see all the time. The one thing I'm holding out for is the Undertaker/Mark Calloway biography, that's really going to be good. Maybe the plan is to wait until he retires before he breaks character.",1337644800,2,380,4.521739130434782

 If you are looking for Undertaker Vs. Steve Austin from Sumerslam 98, or the first Hell in a cell match, or for that matter his Hell in a Cell match with Mankind from King of the ring 98, look elewhere.
 There are some matches I could have done without, but there are also a lot of good ones (some great) on this sett. Highlights of this set are both the Mankind matches, both the Hell in a cell matches and the Last Ride match with Mr. Kennedy. I am ranking this 4 stars because of how many matches are on it that I keep re-watching.",1325116800,2,754,3.9539473684210527
6609851,3,B00N4X8S18,"I was very dissapointed with this dvd. For the guy like Undertaker,the grim reaper,the deadman,the phenom,the american badass,the big evil and the hybrid Taker,this dvd was one of the worst. This dvd sucked. This dvd is not totally bad but it is also definately not the good dvd,we Undertaker fans were expecting.

The dvd should have had Undertaker's REAL good matches from all era's. Not just Original Western Undertaker 90-94,Deadman 94-96,Ministry era 99 and Hybrid or current Undertaker era 2004-present. The dvd should have had more matches from the above mentioned era's.

This dvd should have had Undertaker's American Badass(May 2000-Oct 2000) era matches. This dvd should have had Undertaker's Deadman Inc (Nov 2000-Jul 2001 era's( part of American Badass persona) matches. This dvd should have had the Big Evil(Nov 2001-Nov 2003) era matches. Last but not least this dvd should have had the Undertaker's Lord of darkness(Nov 96-Dec 98) persona matches. Otherwise this is fine dvd.",1324857600,,991,5.305732484076433

6609867,4,B00N4X8S18,"Coming up on Undertaker's 20th anniversary, this was a nice setup where it showcased most of the ""gimmick"" matches he's been involved in (Steel Cage, First Blood, Last Man Standing) along with the ones he was the innovator of (Body Bag, Coffin/Casket, Boiler Room Brawl, Buried Alive, Inferno, Hell In A Cell, Last Ride).  Now while you don't hear Undertaker break character or really talk about his feuds going into these matches, he does do voiceovers here before each match.

Matches Include:
Body Bag Match vs. Ultimate Warrior - This was a rare televised house show match & the first (of many) gimmick matches revolving around Undertaker's persona. The object of this match was to knock your opposition out long enough to place them inside of a body bag & zip it up to win. As usual when it came to Ultimate Warrior, he started out with a fast pace before Taker slowed it down by choking Warrior down to the ground. Warrior still brought the fight & ended up delivering 3 consistent piledrivers with Taker getting up from each one before having to resort to knocking him out with the urn to win the match.
""MSG"" July '91

Coffin Match vs. Kamala - This was the first ever coffin match (later renamed Casket Match) with the rules being a little different than we know then now as you had to win a fall before putting your opponent in the coffin. This match itself was pretty short & sweet (a little over 5 mins.) just to finish the feud between Taker & Kamala but only important as this was the first of many casket matches.
Survivor Series '92

Casket Match vs. Kama - Throughout 1995, Undertaker had been feuding with Ted Dibiase's ""Million $ Corporation"" from I.R.S. (Royal Rumble) to King Kong Bundy (WrestleMania) with Kama being the next person in line after stealing Taker's urn & melting it down into a gold chain. Taker manhandled Kama early both physically as well as mentally with the casket as he kept trying to avoid & run away from it. Kama was able to take control with various punches & kicks along with other moves like a clothesline from the top rope while both men pulled off some spots with the casket that we hadn't seen before. In the end, it still wasn't enough for Taker to still get his revenge but one moment I have to point out during this match that was almost comedic is look out for when Paul Bearer wanted to fight Ted Dibiase on the outside to the point where he even took his coat off, I couldn't help but laugh at that.
SummerSlam '95

Casket Match vs. King Mabel - Undertaker was once again out for revenge here against Mabel who had done so many things to Undertaker such as being one of the rare people to pin him, injure him (hence why he was wearing a face mask during this match), get control of Kama's chain made from Taker's urn, and even go as far as spray painting his own casket. While Mabel was able to get in a few shots here & there, this was a dominate performance by Undertaker to the point where not only did he put Mabel in the casket & got his chain match but got his hands on Sir Mo as well.
""In Your House"" Dec. '95

vs. Mankind - Mankind had attacked Undertaker for months, starting on the RAW right after WrestleMania, and was able to constantly render him unconscious with the nerve hold of the mandible claw. so Taker was more hellbent on revenge than we've seen him before which played out right from the start as Taker attacked Mankind from behind before taking it into the ring & punching him down with more fury than ever before. This evolved into a slow paced brawl with Taker even going for Mankind's mask at one point before Mankind was able to recover & deliver punishment of his own like a running knee smashing Taker's face between his knee & the steel steps before Taker was able to retaliate with an unprotected chairshot right to the head. Before this point in Taker's career, a majority of his matches were against bigger men who were very limited in what they can do in the ring but then came Mankind who definitely brought a more ""hardcore"" fight & style where he used his own body as a weapon which made one line Jim Ross said summarize this match perfectly, ""THIS IS WARFARE!"" as this was most intense & physical match in Taker's career up to this point.
King Of The Ring '96

Boiler Room Brawl vs. Mankind - This was another match that Taker became an innovator of as the rules for this match was that both men would start in the match in the boiler room of the arena with the objective being to fight out & make their way to the ring where the winner would be the man who takes possession of the urn that Paul Bearer was holding in the ring. Mick Foley would later go on refer to this match as his ""unloved child"" because it was a concept that was so unique & different. The fighting in the boiler room was filmed with just one camera & no extra lighting to give it a ""gritty"" feel while there was mostly no commentary minus a few lines here & there while there were some technical difficulties with the picture going out a few times. These men just beat on each other with whatever they could get their hands on while putting themselves in danger like Mankind falling off a ladder through some pieces of wood on top of a box. They were able to make their way out of the boiler room & through the backstage area of the locker room & hallway (including Taker getting burned with hot coffee) all the way to the ring where the bigger story happened in that destroyed an almost 6 year bond. Although Taker & Mankind have had a series of matches you can classify as ""hardcore"" but this was definitely at the top of the list IMO as one of the most violent ones they've done not based off blood or weapons but just the physical punishment both men took as well as gave.
SummerSlam '96

Buried Alive Match vs. Steve Austin - A match that most people forgot happened but this was setup as Taker cost Austin his only title shot against The Rock so for Austin to be entered in the Royal Rumble to gain another title shot, he had to go through Taker in this match. This fight started in the isle with Taker resorting to choking Austin with a guardrail before eventually fighting back to the ring & trying to work over Austin's arm. They once again took the brawl to the floor & to the grave at one point with both men using what they could get their hands on such as chairs & gas cans. Austin was able to finally stun Taker into the grave before getting some more help from not only someone else who had issues with Taker at the time but also some ""heavy machinery"" before claiming his victory.
""IYH: Rock Bottom"" Dec. '98

Inferno Match vs. Kane - While their match at Unforgiven '98 is the most famous inferno match between these two, this was a rare lost one that happened on RAW during the time Undertaker formed his Ministry with the intent to take the WWE away from Vince McMahon so Vince sent Kane into this match to take care of Taker. This was very similar to the previous inferno match in that they were limited in what they could do due to the flames at ringside so they mostly relied on executing power moves with the fight eventually spilling over & ending on the outside of the ring. However the bigger issue here was Vince doing commentary at ringside before receiving a gift that had him so emotionally distracted that he was even brought to his knees with what Taker did to the gift after the match.
""RAW"" Feb. '99

vs. Big Show - This was their first meeting & Show dominated early causing Undertaker to resort to desperate measures early by trying to smother Show with ether & later just completely destroying a baseball bat over Show's head. This was really nothing more than a setup for...
""RAW"" May '99

WWE Championship Match vs. Big Show - ...this rematch which was a complete brawl from start to finish with the referee letting them get away than what they normally would such as Taker using a chair. However what this match is remembered for more than anything else is Big Show chokeslaming Undertaker through the ring.
""RAW"" June '99

Concrete Crypt Match vs. Dudley Boys - Wrestlecrap at it's finest as Undertaker for the most part beat up the WWE Tag Team Champions with Paul Heyman running his mouth non-stop for most of the match until the end when Taker won the match & scared off Heyman & ended up burying Paul Bearer in the concrete himself.
Great American Bash '04
[OMG: Top 50 Incidents]

Casket Match vs. Heidenreich - Heidenreich made it clear that he was scared of caskets & kept trying to stay away from it so Taker used that to his advantage by constantly moving him towards the casket to the point where Heidenreich even ran away from it. Taker at one point used a triangle choke to knock Heidenreich out before Snitsky got involved leading to a brief reunion of the ""Brothers Of Destruction"" with Kane also making an appearance to help his brother & go Snitsky. Heidenreich was able to get an advantage at one point using a modified cobra clutch before Taker recovered & executed his trademark legdrop on the apron with Heidenreich's head wedged in between the casket & it's lid before Taker eventually got the victory. This match was very similar to the earlier matches Taker had against Kama & King Mabel in that Heidenreich was very limited in what he could do in the ring so the gimmick was added to match this match better than what it normally would be.
Royal Rumble '05

Casket Match vs. Randy & Bob Orton - As expected in a handicap match situation, the Orton's kept trying to corner & double team Taker while Taker's strategy was to hit & move when both of them were. Taker was able to focus on one man when the other was out of the way for a few moments such as using a chair on Randy while choking out Bob with the triangle choke. Bob resorted to desperate tactics like using a fire extinguisher to blind Taker while Orton was able to knock Taker out with a chair for a victory but it was the aftermath of the match that made the strongest impression on everyone.
No Mercy '05
[Randy Orton: Evolution Of A Predator]

Undertaker vs. Randy Orton - After trying to end the WrestleMania streak & involving his father & trying to end Taker's career twice including burning his casket, it all ends here inside Hell In A Cell. Taker dominated from the start punishing Orton's head & face via chairshots that busted him open, ramming it into the cell, and using the steel steps. Orton had to resort to an RKO out of nowhere to finally get the advantage & used the steps himself to have Taker bleeding while also using other weapons like a chair & the chair. Both men traded momentum including Taker using the cell to perform his version of ""Old School"" & even attacking Bob Orton through the cell while Orton was able to use a table & even counter Taker's tombstone into his own. This for the most part came off as a ""No Holds Barred"" type of match as it wasn't as brutal, high impact or ""spotty"" like the previous Cell matches were.

[Hell In A Cell]

Last Man Standing Match vs. Great Khali - Taker utilized different sets of strategy in this match to take down Khali such as trying to chop Khali down by taking out his legs & later attempting to choke him out with the triangle choke using the ring ropes for extra leverage. Khali's manager, Davari, did get involved here with Taker chasing him up the stage leaving him open for Khali to throw him off of it. Khali did his usual ""kick/chop"" offense while Taker brawled with Khali & even using weapons like the steel steps & a chair to finally keep Khali down for a 10 count. This was another match where Taker had to work with another ""big"" man who was very limited in what he can do so adding a special stipulation made this match better than it would have been in a regular contest.
""SmackDown"" August '06

First Blood Match vs. Mr. Kennedy - Although they didn't show the pre-match promo, it was mentioned during the match that Kennedy had put Vaseline on his forehead to prevent that area from bleeding but that didn't stop Taker as he heavily focused on Kennedy's head by slamming it on the announce table & steel steps while delivering hard punches, headbutts, and kicks. Undertaker also focused on Kennedy's ribs by ramming them into the ring post, punches & kicks, and even delivering a superplex with the intent of going for internal bleeding. Kennedy used dirty tactics such as low blow to break Taker's dominance before M.V.P. came to ringside & ended up being the deciding factor in the match...but not the way he intended to be but stay tune for the aftermath when Taker gave Kennedy one of the hardest chairshots you've heard.
Survivor Series '06

Last Ride Match vs. Mr. Kennedy - With the way their previous two encounters ended, this was the final encounter with the only way to win the match is to stuff your opposition in the back of a hearse & drive it out of the arena. Kennedy tried to avoid Taker early but that didn't last long as Taker caught up to him & launched Kennedy off the announce table onto the apron. This match evolved into a brawl that saw Kennedy keep trying to escape through the fans before finally getting some momentum in by reversing the tombstone into a real naked choke & using a chair with Taker getting up from each shot. The fought onto the top of the stage where Taker ended up taking on hell of a fall down...which only seemed to anger him more to the point where he used a chair & pipe before finishing off Kennedy with both a chokeslam & tombstone on top of the hearse.
Armageddon '06

World Heavyweight Championship/Last Man Standing Match vs. Batista - A great match with both men using their power moves against each other & each one also selling their injuries (Batista's leg & Taker's arm). Although the finish of the match was a draw, don't let that take away from the effort of both men in this match that was an ideal followup to their WM encounter. Look out for Taker's legdrop onto Batista though the announce table because that looked sick!
Backlash '07

vs. Big Daddy V - Big Daddy V used his heavy weight & strength advantage against Taker early & kept relying on it to regain an advantage whenever Taker would gain the momentum but the only thing noteworthy here was Taker's applying the Hell's Gate & keeping it on to the point where V was bleeding from the mouth.
""SmackDown"" Jan. '08

Hell In A Cell Match vs. Undertaker - In the weeks leading up to this match, you saw Edge's personality change & it was showcased in this match as a different Edge wrestled here than you saw in their previous encounters because Edge came off as insane & obsessed with Taking out taker once & for all instead of being scared, intimated, and relying on help like his previous encounters. Taker got the advantage early & used the cell right away as a weapon itself & brought the ringside steps into the ring before Edge quickly countered using the steps himself like spearing Taker right against it before Edge resorted on his past history in T.L.C. matches by using those items as weapons. They went back & forth punishing each other from knocking one off the apron into the cell, one move that was so impactful that it broke the cell wall, using whatever was at ringside including the monitors & TV cameras & announce tables themselves while pulling out their big moves various times such as the spear, chokeslam, and Last Ride before receipts were being given one by one for all the past attacks in their past with the final image being of one person being sent ""straight to hell."" This lived up to what a Hell In A Cell match should be as far as the level of violence & aggression given out by both men.
SummerSlam '08
[Edge: Decade Of Decadence]

Steel Cage Match vs. Big Show - After meeting in various matches (regular, Last Man Standing, Casket) in the previous months, this was their final encounter inside the steel cage. Show dominated early with his body blows & using the cage to his advantage while Taker kept trying a ""stick & move"" offense. At one point Taker had the chance to escape but make it clear that he wanted to finish off Show more than just win the match. Show countered Taker's chokeslam with one of his own only for Taker to later return the favor & counter his chokeslam with the Hell's Gate to get the final victory.
""SmackDown"" Dec. '08

Two hidden DVD extras are the video packages leading up to his casket matches against Kama & King Mabel.  This was a nice collection that followed up his previous anthology of matches in 2005 & it was nice to get some of the rare gimmick matches of his career.  The only things I really didn't like about this set is that they completely ignored his ""American Bad Ass"" period while along with picking some of the matches that were either completely irrelevant to his career or had no quality to them (Big Daddy V, Dudley Boyz, first Big Show match) over matches that are still in their vault & would have fit in with the theme here (his tag team Buried Alive match with Show vs. Rock & Mankind, the second casket match vs. Yokozuna, his Last Ride match vs. J.B.L., steel cage vs. Batista).  But overall this is a nice collection that serves it's purpose & was enjoyable overall so it's something I'd recommend.",1288828800,5,17214,4.449904882688649
6609868,1,B00N4X8S18,"I just got this set and started watching it. The Undertaker is my second favorite wrestler of all time, next to Bruno Sammartino. I have so far watched 6 matches. I will agree they were really great matches, but Taker was the loser in 3 of the first 6 on the set. Now, maybe it's me, but when you do a tribute set to a performer, isn't it tradional to show matches he acually won? There are somewhere around 20 matches on here, and I didn't wait all these years to get a tribute set where Taker losses half the matches. It's the first tribute set i've seen where the honoree loses even one of the matches, let alone 3 of the first 6. Not my idea of a tribute. I'm very disappointed at the least.",1288137600,5,695,4.117647058823529
6609869,5,B00N4X8S18,"All the matches on this dvd was really GOOD ,I highly recommend this DVD to anyone who is an UNDERTAKER'S fan ,this had some of the most memorable and brutal matches the undertaker have ever competed in ,a great collection of matches chosen by the wwe in my opinion,you can't ask for more ,hell in cell matches ,coffin and casket matches,a boiler room match ,a concrete crypt match(first ever),a body bag match,a steel cage match,first blood matches,a last ride match and last man standing matches ,OMG!!!!! Who needs extras when it was so good ,this DVD was very long indeed and full with some of the best matches the undertaker has competed in ,it surely lived up to it's name,'WWE THE UNDERTAKER'S DEADLIEST MATCHES'

Liked how they did not repeat matches from the tombstone dvd set,which make this one better.",1283731200,,813,4.807142857142857
6609870,4,B00N4X8S18,"i have watched this dvd and heres what i think of it.
  DVD 1 CONTAINS.....
  1-vs the ulimate warrior[body bag match].this was a hard hitting match.at one point the warrior nailed him with 3 piledrivers in a row.there was nothing to take it to a stellar level though.[6 out of ten stars:very good]
  2-vs kamala[casket match].the match took a while to get going.kamala used weak/innefective/repetitive chops a lot.the end was good.[6 out of ten stars:above average...barely]
  3-vs kama[another casket match].mostly kicks and punches from both sides.i thought it would be a slaughter but kama held his own.[6 stars:above average]
  4-vs maybel[who later turned to viscera and big daddy v]in [yet another casket match.].i was wondering at this point how many casket matches there were going to be.it was getting redundant.undertaker had a cool partial skull like mask on.there was a lot of simple brawling mixed in with some power moves.[6 stars:very good]
  5-vs mankind.this  match  was not a casket match which was refreshing.but with no gimmick how far could it really go?well,the cluless ref didn't see a lot of cheating going on.once again,brawling and a slow start.mankind gets chairs and then the pace picks up drasticly.jr said ""it resembles a prison riot"".another announcer said the undertaker ""was in a fight for his life"".there were a lot of violent bumps.mankind squeals and grunts like a demented pig the whole match.mankind also randomly abuses himself.easily the best match this far.the kind of match i paid to see.[7 stars:awesome]
  6-vs mankind[boiler room match].the announcers were pretty quiet so screams and squealing was all you heard,vocaly.as mankind got more violent he said ""bang bang"" as if his other personality were creeping through.it was a nice touch.the match was slow and methodical.it was also ecw like violent and very hard hitting.easily the best match on dvd one.[8 stars out of 10:a classic]
  7-vs stone cold steve austin[buried alive match].again! mostly punching and kicking the whole time.the announcers say the grave is 6 feet deep.the undetaker stands in it and it is barely passed his knees.so more like like half that.there was a big ending though but it was not enough to save the match.[6 stars:above average...barely].
  8-vs kane [inferno match].this was from raw which doesntly normaly get this violent.there was fire around the ring.it blew up really high when the combatants hit the floor hard.another punch and kick fest.there was an ending involving a tiny flame on kanes boot which went up like it was soaked in gas and vince in a fetal position near a teddy bear with its heart ripped out.[6 out of ten stars for a big lack of wrestling moves .while there were some big bumps ,there were just a few.
  SO i would give dvd:1 a overall rating of 6.6 which means very good.

  the rest of the dvd was a bunch of halloween gibberish.i mean,for real,does anyone belive this guy is a vampire or inhuman?does anyone belive he runs about burying people?or that he's from hell?with all that wasted time they could have tossed in the hell in the cell match vs mankind or maybe the original hell in a cell vs sean michaels.
  DVD 2
  1-vs big show.this match was very quick and very intense.they should have called it the anethesia match as it involved ethyr and a baseball bat.[7 stars-unique].
  2-vs big show.this match was called ""a war',""a car crash"" and ""an earthquake"".despite all the colorful commentery this match was pretty average.it ended with a rather large hole in the ring.[6 stars-above average].
  3-vs the dudley boys.[concrete crypt match].in this match paul bearer was in a big glass case.the case was hooked to a cement mixer.every so often paul heyman poured more concrete onto paul bearer..the undertaker did an outstanding job of fending off 2 opponents.there were many  interuptions.this was,at first, amusing but later it got annoying.the match was very dramatic.[6 stars-above average]
  4-vs heidenreich[casket match].here we go again with the casket matches.the match was full of a lot of basic brawling with a few suprises[6 stars-above average]
  5-bob and randy orton[handicapped casket match].yet another casket match.by this time its getting old.bob orton lasted way longer than i thought he would.i mean he did headline wrestlemania 1.it was hard hitting throughout.[6 stars-above average]
  6-vs randy orton[hell in a cell].the start was pretty basic.the undertaker was very slow and methodical.every time he hit orton he would do something more viscious to follow it up as if he was feeding on ortons suffering.orton bleeds A LOT.the weopon play is very brutal.you can see a lot of blood on the ring post.they get slow as they weaken.one of the nastiest low blows ive ever seen in my life was delivered.then there was a big grand finale.[7 stars-awesome!]
  7-vs great khali[last man standing match].the undertaker was on a whole new intensity level for this one.it was called""world war 3"" by the announcer.it was like ww3 in that it only took a short time to destroy everything.[7 stars-intense]
  all the other halloween junk was just silly.he is NOT  the grim reaper..the grim reaper uses a sickle not a steel chair.he could kill someone simply by touching them too.he is not immortal either.he is a man named mean mark callous.i can get up to 32 times fast on my dvd player and undertaker still looks like an old lady coming to the ring.i would give this dvd a average overall rating of 6.3.which is very good.
  dvd 3
1-vs mr kennedy[first blood match].this match seemed trivial after all these bloody matches before it.there was a lot of trash talking then a lot of hard hitting action.it turned into a viscious beatdown before long.there was a suprise ending.[7 stars].
2-vs mr kennedy[last ride match].to win this one you have to put your oppenent in a hearse and drive him away.this was another beatdown.kennedy hit an amazing chair shot.there was some flying.the undertaker came back from being beaten senseless a record time in this one i'd bet.bradshaw was announcing and said people have out of body experiences while battling the undertaker.thats childish.[8 out of ten stars].
3-vs batista[last man standing match]-again,a slow start and much brawling.then the ever present beat down.awesome finale[8 out of ten stars-classic]
4-vs viscera[big daddy v]-this was a straight up match.undertaker actualy choke slammed the enormous v.also undertakers hells gate was debuted here.[6 stars-above average].
5-vs edge[hell in a cell]-the beginning was the same as all of the others.i won't repeat it to you.the steel steps were a favorite early on.there was a viscious head shot.the match was extremely hard hitting.the chair took the steps place.they beat eachother mercilessly with those.before long it looked like a tlc match.edge breaks some ribs.the cage breaks.they fight outside with everything handy.it was very brutal.multiple finishers were employed.a gigantic finale.[8 stars-an all time great even with edge in it].
6-vs the big show[steel cage match].it was very physical as you may have guessed.it was a good match.how could you follow up that last match anyway?[6 stars].
  an average rating of 7.3 for disc 3-awesome!
  average of 6.5 stars for the whole set.
  i would definately recomend this to any taker or true wrestling fan.
  i would just like to add a list of matches they could have included....

6609874,3,B00N4X8S18,"This is a nice collection but I don't understand how the Hell in the Cell match with Mankind can be left off of this set!  To me it's like leaving out the Hogan v Andre match in a Hogan set or the Ricky Steamboat v Randy Savage match in their DVDs.

Not to bemoan the subject but this is not just a classic WWF/E match but one of the all-time great matches. I've read posts that said because Taker wasn't acting as the ""Deadman"" that match doesn't fit. But I'm sure there are ways to creatively edit the motorcycle entrance, because once the match gets going I don't think anyone can tell the difference between the American Badass's wrestling style and that of the Deadman.",1279670400,,674,4.384
6609875,4,B00N4X8S18,"I really enjoyed this video. I didn't watch wrestling for years and The Undertaker was always my favorite wrestler. I would like to see some more pay-per-view matches, but I guess the title is the ""deadliest"", so some of them from Smackdown were pretty deadly too :) If you're a Taker fan and a wrestling fan you will enjoy this collection. Could it be better? Probably yes, but I'm hoping they will release more DVDs by the end of his career.",1279497600,,443,4.481481481481482
6609886,4,B00N4X8S18,"This dvd is great to own but it excluded some of Undertaker's best matches. They could have included maybe Undertaker vs Big Bossman HIAC match from WM15 (it wasn't one of his best but the ending was brutal)

I would have excluded the earlier Big Show matches and Big Daddy V. I thought this dvd was going to have his personal kind of matches. Maybe they should have had:

Taker vs JBL in a last ride match
Taker & Kane vs DDP and Kanyon in a steel cage match (Summerslam 01)
Big Boss Man vs Taker in HIAC (WM15)
Replace the Taker vs Kane in an inferno match on Raw with the first one at Unforgiven

Also not one single special feature. I wouldnt mind seeing some of Taker's great promos, perhaps when he hung Stone Cold on that cross and maybe his debut match.

Overall still a great dvd",1277337600,3,2817,4.707216494845361
6609887,4,B00N4X8S18,"Vs. The Ultimate Warrior (Body Bag Match) - This match was a brawl from the start with the Undertaker attacking Warrior before he even entered the ring. Again, this match is nothing more then a straight up brawl between the two with the Warrior able to nail three consecutive piledrivers followed by a big body splash to end the match. 2.5/5
MADISON SQUARE GARDEN July '91

Vs. Kamala (Casket Match) - A year after winning the WWE Championship and two years after his debut, the Undertaker finds himself in another specialty match at Survivor Series. This match is nothing more than Kamala being so afraid of the coffin the Undertaker built just for him even going so far to not even wanting to touch or be anywhere near of the Undertaker's urn. This match is so one sided with Kamala getting in little offense. It ends with the Undertaker hitting Kamala with the urn and nailing shut the coffin with Kamala inside it. 3/5
SURVIVOR SERIES '92

Vs. Kama (Casket Match) - The entire SummerSlam card in 1995 was terrible in every which way and this Casket Match between the Undertaker and Kama is no different. The match isn't boring but on the other hand there isn't anything there that is really noteworthy except for a few innovative spots with the casket. But other than that, this match doesn't have much to offer. 2.75/5
SUMMERSLAM '95

Vs. King Mabel (Casket Match) - Again, this match is no different than from the previous two Casket matches and more importantly, this match only had one purpose and that was for the Undertaker to gain his urn back which Mabel, along with his crew, had destroyed. Nothing in particular noteworthy as this bout is not even above par. 2.5/5
IN YOUR HOUSE Dec. '95

Vs. Mankind - Up to this point in time, the Undertaker has been in the company for nearly 6 years and during that time, the Undertaker has never met his match until he faced Mick Foley's 'Mankind'. Some may disagree with me on this but Mankind was undoubtfully, in my opinion, the Undertaker's first real challenge during his first six years in the WWE because I feel this match against Mankind was his best wrestling match in those first six years but is morely forgotten due to their later Hell In A Cell match(which took place at the very same event). Just a real good match between two legendary figures as Mick Foley and the Undertaker rarely ever disappoint in any kind of match against one another. 4.5/5
KING OF THE RING '96

Vs. Mankind (Boiler Room Brawl) - With the exception of their Hell In A Cell bout, this Boiler Room Brawl between the Undertaker and Mankind is probably the most insane, wild, and most unique match you will ever see and like all of the Undertaker's and Mick Foley's matches together, they had no boundaries in what they did to each other and this Boiler Room Brawl was a perfect fit for these two. The stimpulation to the match allowed Mankind and the Undertaker go above and beyond in ways you just have to see for yourself as they took the ""hardcore style"" of wrestling to a whole other planet in this bout. If you can get past the technical difficulties throughout the brawl, you are in for a big treat with this one, I guarantee it. 5/5
SUMMERSLAM '96

Vs. Steve Austin (Buried Alive Match) - In this match, the Undertaker was just beginning his Ministry of Darkness clan and Steve Austin was attempted to be his first victim. Like a majority of Austin's matches, this match was a brawl from the start as the two began the match in the aisle way with most of the match being fought outside the ring. In ways, I saw this match better than their other encounters against one another such as their SummerSlam and Judgment Day matches over the WWE Championship because this match was unique and is rarely used in the WWE but the thing is, once you seen one Buried Alive Match you have virtually seen them all so the match will get boring after watched many times. Again, just a wild brawl between the Texas Rattlesnake and the Phenom with Austin gaining victory in the end with help from Kane allowinf Austin to be entered in the 1999 Royal Rumble match. 4/5
ROCKBOTTOM '98

Vs. Kane (Inferno Match) - This match also follows the same comparison, once you seen one Inferno Match, you have seen them all. This match was nothing more or anything less than their last Inferno Match and was focused morely on the interaction between the Undertaker and Mr. McMahon (who was doing commentary) after the match. If you have seen their Unforgiven Inferno Match then you aren't missing much here. 3/5
RAW Feb. '99

Vs. The Big Show - This match is unique because it was the first time the Undertaker had a match with someone who is bigger than him and who could actually wrestle! LOL. The Big Show displayed a great strength of power in the match with the Undertaker using his agility and quick jabs to fight back and even going so low to using a chemical substance to slow down the Big Show. In the end, the Undertaker literally broke a wooden baseball bat over the skull of the Big Show to cause the disqualification for himslef. 2/5
RAW May '99

Vs. The Big Show - This match for the Undertaker's WWE Championship and again, these two giants brought their A game with them using the same formula as they did in the previous match. After the Undertaker gain the advantage over Big Show, he dominate Big Show on the outside over the announce table and even using a steel chair at one point. The Undertaker was incontrol until he was caught and was chokeslammed through the ring which caused the match to be stopped. This was a good match between the two giants and it does not disappoint. 3.5/5
RAW June '99

Vs. Dudley Boyz (Concrete Crypt Match) - This match was not amusing at all. The non-stop blabbling from Paul Heyman was annoying and the action from the Dudleys and the Undertaker was just not good at all. The concept behind the match was good but the concept of the match itself was horribale and not easy to enjoy. This was a bad match from one of the worst PPV cards ever in the WWE. 1.5/5
GREAT AMERICAN BASH '04

Vs. Heidenreich (Casket Match) - Surprisingly, this was a very good Casket Match as the Undertaker was the only guy who could ever get a solid and good match out of Heidenreich. You see the Undertaker using some of his signature moves and incorporating them involving the casket with the Undertaker also unleashing some hard punishment onto Heidenreich with Kane and Snitsky getting involved but not taking anything away from the match. Again, a  shockingly good bout and an even better and much impressive Casket Match. 4/5
ROYAL RUMBLE '05

Vs. Randy Orton & Cowboy Bob Orton (Casket Match) - Like the preivous Casket Match with Heidenreich, this is another very good and a very impressive Casket Match, especially the circumstances surrounding the match with Bob Orton being thrown into the fight at the stage of his career. The only negative I can say about this one is the ending, since it's something that has already been done before. But with the excpetion of the fire ending, this bout delivered. 4.25/5
NO MERCY '05

Vs. Randy Orton (Hell In A Cell Match) - I never admitted this on any other review but I will now. This Hell In A Cell match between Randy Orton and the Undertaker is close to being my favorite Hell In A Cell bout. The Undertaker and Orton brought their best stuff and this match delivered to the fullest no matter what other reviewers say. After being set on fire at No Mercy and returning at Survivor Series, the Undertaker was back to ensure the Legend Killer was going to pay for his dues and Orton certainly does as Orton takes one of the most vicious beatings from the Undertaker someone has ever taken along with two of the most hardest steel chair shots I have ever seen and heard. This match has everything from blood, weapon use, interference, and everything else you could ask for in a Hell In A Cell match. Just a fantastic match in my opinion. 5/5
ARMAGEDDON '05

Vs. The Great Khali (Last Man Standing Match) - Like their previous bouts, the Undertaker tried and tried but Khali just sucks, period. The only noteworthy things I can say is probably the Undertaker being thrown off the stage and delivering a chokeslam to the massive Khali for the end while bloodying Khali in the process. 2/5
SMACKDOWN Aug. '06

Vs. Mr. Kennedy (First Blood Match) - Like their match from No Mercy, the Undertaker and Kennedy delivered. Undertaker was dominating Kennedy for most of the match with Undertaker in the early stages of the match just destroying Mr. Kennedy all over the announce table. In the end, MVP comes out (payback on Mr. Kennedy) accidentally hits Undertaker with a steel chair causing Undertaker to bleed. After the match, Undertaker shows his animalistic side by destroying Mr. Kennedy even more and delivering one of the most hard hitting steel chair shots ever to Mr. Kennedy in Pro Wrestling history! Undertaker also delivers one destructive Tombstone Piledriver to Mr. Kennedy as well. And for the record, this was the match of the night for Survivor Series in '06. 4.5/5
SURVIVOR SERIES '06

Vs. Mr. Kennedy (Last Ride Match) - This was another impressive back and forth contest in this series as Kennedy looked to gain his third win over the Undertaker. These two fought all over ringside with Undertaker being more vicious and dominate every blow he delivered with Kennedy able to hold his own. Just another good match in this series and an impressive showing from Mr. Kennedy. 5/5
ARMAGEDDON '06

Vs. Bastista (Last Man Standing Match) - Despite the double count out end, this was the one of the best Last Man Standing matches I have ever seen. In this match, Batista and the Undertaker topped their World Title Match from WrestleMania 23. You see during the match both men selling their injuries, Batista's hamstring and Undertaker's arm. Undertaker was targeting Batista's injured leg throughout the majority of the match with some brawling occurring. Some spots to look out for are Undertaker's leg drop to Batista through the table, Batista & Undertaker able to stand up after suffering each other's finisher moves, and also Batista stealing an Undertaker move out of the corner. The draw came at the end where Batista countered the Tombstone and speared himself and Undertaker off the stage. A fantastic match between these two over the World Championship. 5/5
BACKLASH '07

Vs. Big Daddy V - The idiot Michael Cole points out this is the first meeting between these two when history and evidence shows these two have met before. Just like their Casket Match, this match did nothing and was just a bore for me. 1.75/5
SMACKDOWN Jan. '08

Vs. Edge (Hell In A Cell Match) - Weeks prior, you see Edge transforming into a more psychoic and paranoided individual who is prepared to enter the devil's playground against the sinister of the demonic structure and it showed in the match Edge was ready to the fullest for his ride to hell and back. The Undertaker and Edge took things they're know for and converted them into their own unique use inside the cell such as Edge introducing tables, ladders, and chairs to the match with the Undertaker using his experience and his knowledge of the Hell In A Cell nature against Edge. Edge and the Undertaker went beyond in having a normal Hell In A Cell bout as they took the match to the outside and coming up when some innovative spots inside and outside of the cell. In the end, the Undertaker returned and had an unbelieveable Hell In A Cell match with Edge that will be remembered for the ages to come. 5/5
SUMMERSLAM '08

Vs. The Big Show (Steel Cage Match) - The Undertaker and Big Show are two giants that seem to have chemistry with each other everytime and they rarely ever have a dull and boring match and this Steel Cage Match is no excpetion. Both the Undertaker and Big Show used the Steel Cage to its fullest allowing the cage to be their tag team partner that the cage has been described on many, many occasions. This was a very good back and forth bout and it delivered. 3.75/5
SMACKDOWN Dec. '08

In the end, with 21 matches on this 3 disc set and not a single one being repeated from the ""Tombstone"" DVD set, this is a set I highly recommend on getting. For the most part, this DVD will satisfy most of of you and that is all you can ask for. Again, this is a set I recommend.",1277078400,4,12347,4.587488667271079
6609888,4,B00N4X8S18,"I never thought I would buy a wrestling DVD, but 'Taker is my favorite wrestler, so I figured I would get this one.  It has some very good matches, and was very entertaining to watch, but it doesn't have all the great matches.  It doesn't have anything from the ""American Badass"" gimmick.  That was before I was a fan, so I don't really care, but if you loved Undertaker's American Badass persona, you won't find it here.  I was hoping for the Hell in the Cell match with Undertaker and Mankind, but that isn't here either.  Still, there are plenty of good matches, I'm entertained, and you'll probably be entertained, too.",1276560000,,623,4.576576576576577

However, I strongly believe that this DVD set should have included MORE matches that serve the gimmick/purpose of this 3 DVD set, such as:

vs. Giant Gonzales in a Rest in Peace Match Summerslam 1993: Match was not a classic but Taker feuded most of the year with Gonzalez. True! Taker carried the match, but it helped his gimmick in his early career.

vs. Yokozuna in a Casket Match Survivor Series 1994: the Tombstone DVD included Taker/Yoko's 1st Casket Match at Royal Rumble 1994 and left this one out. Yoko really sold his fear of caskets in this match.

vs. The Executoner AKA Terry Gordy in an Armageddon Rules Match In Your House: It's Time 1996: The match itself was not as good as his matches with Mankind, but the brawl here was good.

vs. Mankind in a Sledgehammer Match Raw 1998: Any Taker/Foley match is a deadly match. Enough said!.

vs. Kane in a Casket Match Raw 1998: This was after their match at Judgement Day 1998 & they destroyed the casket.

vs. Bigboss Man in a Hell in a Cell Match Wrestlemania 15 1999: Labeled as the worst HIAC, but the ending was shocking and deadly (ALL pun intended).

W/ Big Show vs. Rock N' Sock Connection in a Buried Alive Tag Match Smackdown! 1999: A Lost gem that's never included on DVD.

W/ Kane vs. DDP & Kanyon in a Steel Cage Match Summerslam 2001: Both WWE & WCW titles were on the line. WWE vs. WCW!

vs. RVD in a Hardcore Match Vengeance 2001: The Hardcore belt was on the line. Taker goes Hardcore.

vs. Jeff Hardy in a Ladder Match Raw 2002: Taker defended the Undisputed title in his 1st Ladder Match against the master of the ladder. Classic!

vs. Big Show in a Punjabi Prison Match Great American Bash 2006: Innovative match that should have been included in this DVD set.

vs. Batista, MVP, Big Daddy V, Finlay & the Great Khali in an Elimination Chamber Match: Taker's 1st EC Match. Excellent bout.",1274832000,,2025,4.532967032967033
6609891,5,B00N4X8S18,"So Undertaker finally gets another dvd set. The last one, which was Tombstone: The History Of The Undertaker, was released in 2005. Like Tombstone, Deadliest Matches is a collection of matches. I believe, there will be a narrator to introduce the dvd and matches just like on Tombstone.

Disc 1

""Two Decades of Destruction""

Body Bag Match
Undertaker vs Ultimate Warrior
Madison Square Garden - July 1, 1991
I was 14 yrs old when the feud with Ultimate Warrior took place and when UT locked him in the coffin at the Duneral Parlor I was scared a bit of UT and grew out out of it. Undertaker is my favorite now. I recall this match, and it was a decent match.

""Custom Made Coffin""

Coffin Match
Undertaker vs Kamala
Survivor Series - November 25, 1992

Not his best casket match but I think its here cause its his first.  But I BELIEVE Wndertaker won that.
""Grim Reaper""

Casket Match
Undertaker vs Kama
SummerSlam - August 27, 1995

It was a good casket match. Very good.  UT Was in a huge jam!! Not perfect casket match, but it deserved to be there.

""Shadow of Death""

Casket Match
Undertaker vs King Mabel
In Your House - December 17, 1995

Why is this here?...But its Undertaker; anything by him I will accept.

""Deranged and Sadistic""

Undertaker vs Mankind
Undertaker vs. Mankind anything is worth showing. To Me Mankind gave Undertaker the toughest times. I am glad this is here.

""No Boundaries""

Boiler Room Brawl
Undertaker vs Mankind
SummerSlam - August 18, 1996

I didn't Understand the Boiling Room Brawl until I saw it on the Summer Slam Anthology , It was a great match. Although on the Anthology. Im glad its here.

""Chilling Numbers""

Buried Alive Match
Undertaker vs Stone Cold Steve Austin
Rock Bottom - December 13, 1998

Its a Rare Buried Alive MAtch but It was a special one as just as 99.9 % of Undertaker Buried Alive Matches are.

""Internal Fires""

Inferno Match
Undertaker vs Kane
Raw - February 22, 1999

The First Ever Inferno Match from Unforgiven 98 is far much better. I was in the hospital, so I didn't see the RAW Inferno so I look forward to seeing it.

Disc 2

""An Imposing Force""

Undertaker vs Big Show
Raw - May 3, 1999

Can't comment.

""What Lies Beneath""

WWE Championship Match
Undertaker vs Big Show
Raw - June 4, 1999

I THINK THAT THIS IS THE SHOW WHERE UNDERTAKER WAS CHOKESLAMMED THROUGH RING. I HATED IT CAUSE IT HAPPEN TO UNDERTAKER BUT IT WAS A WOW MOMENT!!

""A Long and Complex History""

Concrete Crypt Match
Undertaker vs The Dudley Boys
The Great American Bash - June 27, 2004

One of Undertakers worse matches cause of the stipulations and Paul HeyMan, the ending was more talked about and better than the entire match.

""Devils and Wicked Men""

Casket Match
Undertaker vs Heidenreich
Royal Rumble - January 30, 2005

Heidenreich didn't deserve to shoe shine my shoes as much as he didn't deserve the cascet match, there were a few moments in the match that made it watchable, but overall UT could have done the match with himself...Im glad UT Won...Very glad

""Like Father, like Son""

1 0n 2 Casket Match
Undertaker vs Randy Orton & Cowboy Bob Orton
No Mercy - October 9, 2005

Great Match...Great job to everyone....UT puts on a great show, Although you didn't win.. As I always Im proud of you Undertaker

""The Devil's Playground""

Hell in a Cell
Undertaker vs Randy Orton
Armageddon - December 18, 2005

Randy Orton vs. Undertaker was the greatest feud of 2005, second would be Shawn Michaels vs. Kurt Angle...The HIAC although not a perfect match, was a very good match and a great way to end the feud.

""Last Judgment""

Last Man Standing Match
Undertaker vs Great Khali
Smackdown - August 18, 2006

Hmmm. This was the best match for those two...It was good match shockingly ppl will believe that I say deserves to be on this DVD

Disc 3

""First Blood""

First Blood Match
Undertaker vs Mr Kennedy
Survivor Series - November 26, 2006

It was a great match....But I (ME) believe this match is here cause of the aftermath, although the match itself was great too.

""Last Ride""

Last Ride Match
Undertaker vs Mr Kennedy
Armageddon - December 17, 2006

GREAT MATCH! Very good match from although being  on the Armageddon 2006, that is on Armageddon 2006 dvd too, that deserved to be here

""Powers Lie Within""

Last Man Standing Match for the World Heavyweight Championship
Undertaker vs Batista
Backlash - April 29, 2007

This match was done at Backlash involving two ppl who participated in the top 3 feuds of all time. I was there for that match it was a great match, but not a great ending, but you can see why it happened.

""Revenge""

Undertaker vs Big Daddy V
Smackdown - January 25, 2008

This Match ppl say shouldnt be here...Although it wasn't a great match and I realized why it was here...This 3 Disc DVD set its titled Undertaker Deadliest Matches, that match against Big Daddy V is where the Undertaker debut his new Hells Gate submission hold. So yes I can see why its here.

""Ring of Fire""

Hell in a Cell
Undertaker vs Edge
SummerSlam - August 17, 2008

This was a great Hell in a Cell Match, although  it was on other dvd sets, it deserved to be here, especially for the aftermath. hense the title of the DVD

""State of Mind""

Steel Cage Match
Undertaker vs Big Show
Smackdown - December 5, 2008

Just a decent match, Undertaker won...Im glad

I look fwd to seeing the dvd when it comes out to add to my awesome collection.",1274745600,3,5394,4.548958333333333
6609892,1,B00N4X8S18,"It's not that the matches on here are poor-in fact, there are some terrific bouts with Mankind, Kane, and Austin.
The problem is glaringly obvious; there they are, moving along year to year, maybe skipping one or two, until you get to 1999. This, of course, was the Meat of the Attitude Era, as most fans will tell you. 1999-2001 were the three finest years in this company's history. And they are NOT well represented.
Yep, the WWE is back to thier old tricks; you know, by ignoring history, they desperately hope we'll go along with them and conveniently forget about the period in which the Dead Man was no longer the Dead Man-no, he was alive and well, and the only connotation towards the Grim Reaper was the fact he could WAKE the dead when he started revvin his Hog.
This was the period of realism; remember? RVD and Kane were tag champs. Kane still wore the mask, and a reddish outfit. But no one pretended he was back from the dead to avenge his soul and blah blah blah. No, he actually talked! In a PPV from 01, the two tag champs are backstage talking strategy for the evening's match. Paraphrased: RVD-""Kane, dude, just watch my back, I'll do the same, and we'll have no problems."" Kand-""You got it brother, they don't stand a chance-now lets go whip some a%$.""
The WWF was never more alive, more exciting, more CREATIVE, than they were then-they had been inspired by the soul of ECW, and for a short time, they were a viable alternative to that innovative federation. The Undertaker, and the switch from comic book demon to bad-*(% biker was a perfect example.
Of course, Vince McMahon, and especially aspiring Senator wife Linda, do NOT want anyone to remember this. That would interfere with their new image: the PG rated, wholesome, fun for the whole family WWE. Where everyone, from the announcers to the performers, have been harmlessly neutered for your 7 year old's viewing pleasure.
Well, for those of us that don't care for the new direction, for those of us who preferred a little creativity to go with their made-up storylines, buying this DVD would almost be a form of mild sacrilege. As for me, I'm not joining Vince's cult-the American BadAs* will never Rest In Peace.
Derek Hamel",1274659200,9,2207,4.63265306122449
6609893,4,B00N4X8S18,This is an interesting set but how many of these undertaker dvds are out there.  I mean some of these matches are on other sets.  But I'll prob get it for the boiler room brawl match and the more recent ones since I don't watch pay per view or wrestling on tv anymore.,1274572800,,268,4.037735849056604
6609894,4,B00N4X8S18,"This is a pretty nice collection of Taker's matches. I already own three of them, but hey out of so many matches that is not too bad.

I will say that I wish there were some Big Evil or American badass era mathes on here. I think WWE is protecting his gimmick here, and they don't want to ruin the illusion for the younger kids who buy this set.

He certainly had alot of good and ""deadly"" matches from 2000-2003 that I would have liked on here.

My last gripe is I want WWE to make all new dvd's from here on out available on Blu Ray. Even though only the last three matches on here were shot with an HD camere, all the matches will benefit from this. I lovee WWE in HD, and I want more of their great Blu Rays!

Anyway this is quite nice, but I simply can not wait till Taker finnaly gets a nice long ducumentary treatment like Shawn Michaels: Heartbreak and Triumph. That will be so epic!",1274227200,5,891,4.103448275862069

Disc 1

""Two Decades of Destruction""

Body Bag Match
Undertaker vs Ultimate Warrior
Madison Square Garden - July 1, 1991

A rare match & vintage classic Undertaker so I'm glad it is on dvd for those reasons.

""Custom Made Coffin""

Coffin Match
Undertaker vs Kamala
Survivor Series - November 25, 1992

I believe this match is on here because it was the very first Casket Match. Why else would it be on here? It is clearly NOT one of UT's deadliest encounters. He dominated this short match.

""Grim Reaper""

Casket Match
Undertaker vs Kama
SummerSlam - August 27, 1995

More dangerous than his match with Kamala. Is it the best casket match? I don't think so. But UT was in trouble here so considering the DVD title, I see why it's on here.

""Shadow of Death""

Casket Match
Undertaker vs King Mabel
In Your House - December 17, 1995

Oh wow. Why this is here I will never know. This should be replaced.

""Deranged and Sadistic""

Undertaker vs Mankind
King of the Ring - June 23, 1996

FINALLY ON DVD! Great match. Worthy of being on DVD!!!

""No Boundaries""

Boiler Room Brawl
Undertaker vs Mankind
SummerSlam - August 18, 1996

Although on the Summerslam Anthology set, I'm glad it's here too. Their entire feud should be here if you ask me.

""Chilling Numbers""

Buried Alive Match
Undertaker vs Stone Cold Steve Austin
Rock Bottom - December 13, 1998

Rare Buried Alive Match. A good one too.

""Internal Fires""

Inferno Match
Undertaker vs Kane
Raw - February 22, 1999

The First Ever Inferno Match from Unforgiven 98 is far much better. They added this one since the first one is already on dvd. However, considering the DVD Title, I would've added Taker's matches with Kane from WM14, Unforgiven 98, RAW 98 (where they battled to become the #1 contender to get a WWF Title shot at KOTR 98) instead as those were better than the second Inferno Match from RAW 1999 and with the exception of WM14 & Unforgiven 98, those have never been on dvd as of yet.

Disc 2

""An Imposing Force""

Undertaker vs Big Show
Raw - May 3, 1999

Can't comment. Didn't see this as Big Show isn't my favorite wrestler. I do know there was a match, where UT was chokeslammed through this ring. Don;t know what match is was though.

""What Lies Beneath""

WWE Championship Match
Undertaker vs Big Show
Raw - June 4, 1999

Can't comment. Didn't see this as Big Show isn't my favorite wrestler. I do know there was a match, where UT was chokeslammed through this ring. Don;t know what match is was though.

""A Long and Complex History""

Concrete Crypt Match
Undertaker vs The Dudley Boys
The Great American Bash - June 27, 2004

Not the best match. But it's rare.....probably because it wasn't a favorite among fans. It's practically forgotten. Not much of a match, really because Paul Heyman kept interrupting it.

""Devils and Wicked Men""

Casket Match
Undertaker vs Heidenreich
Royal Rumble - January 30, 2005

Not really my favorite casket match. Heidenreich was not the best worker so in my opinion, he didn't deserve to face UT, let alone in casket match.

""Like Father, like Son""

1st Ever Handicap Casket Match
Undertaker vs Randy Orton & Cowboy Bob Orton
No Mercy - October 9, 2005

Rare and quite good. Orton & UT had great chemistry together.

""The Devil's Playground""

Hell in a Cell
Undertaker vs Randy Orton
Armageddon - December 18, 2005

The end of one of 2005's greatest WWE feuds (the other being HBK & Kurt Angle) and a fitting end at that.

""Last Judgment""

Last Man Standing Match
Undertaker vs Great Khali
Smackdown - August 18, 2006

Hmmm. Khali on DVD against UT? Not ready for that yet. But it was much better than J.Day 2006 so.....

Disc 3

""First Blood""

First Blood Match
Undertaker vs Mr Kennedy
Survivor Series - November 26, 2006

No clue why this is here. Not complaining as it is a good match. The aftermath (hopefully included) was GREAT! But watch the match too.

""Last Ride""

Last Ride Match
Undertaker vs Mr Kennedy
Armageddon - December 17, 2006

GREAT MATCH! UT's fall was sickening and scary.

""Powers Lie Within""

Last Man Standing Match for the World Heavyweight Championship
Undertaker vs Batista
Backlash - April 29, 2007

A match from THE GREATEST feud of 2007 is here. GREAT GREAT MATCH!!! Not crazy about the ending, but I fully understand and accept why it happened.

""Revenge""

Undertaker vs Big Daddy V
Smackdown - January 25, 2008

No business being on here. BDV gets 2 matches here (the other featured him as King Mabel). It's not even a specialty match and BDV isn't a great worker. If they wanted him on here, should have put the Elimination Chamber from NWO 2008.

""Ring of Fire""

Hell in a Cell
Undertaker vs Edge
SummerSlam - August 17, 2008

A good HIAC. However, since this is at Summerslam, a PPV worthy of watching from start to finish most of the time, I would have wanted the matches from Backlash, J.Day, and ONS instead or in addition to the HIAC.

""State of Mind""

Steel Cage Match
Undertaker vs Big Show
Smackdown - December 5, 2008

Should have added their Cyber Sunday 2008 & GAB 2006 Punjabi Prison matches instead as those were far far better. The Cage match with Batista should've been here too.

Legacy of the Phenom

Matches that should be replaced:
Kamala
Big Show - Cage Match
BDV
King Mabel
Khali
Orton - HIAC (already on the HIAC dvd set)
Concrete Crypt Match
Big Show - both from RAW 1999
Inferno Match 1999

Matches I would have liked to have instead:
Batista - Cage Match
vs HBK - WM25 & WM26
Big Show - Punjabi Prison
Kurt Angle - NWO 2006 Rematch for the WHC (shown on SD. Has yet to get a dvd release)
Batista, Mark Henry, BDV, Khali, MVP - Elimation Chamber - NWO 2008
Kane - episode of RAW form 98 where thy fought for a Title shot at KOTR 98, J.Day 1998
Bret Hart - MSG 1991
Vader - Casket Match from MSG (don't remember what year)

Regardless of the content, I will get it and recommend it to UT fans.

I hope & pray that WWE releases a 3 disc DVD set with a very detailed documentary on Edge, Kane, Sting, and Undertaker. UT & Sting, maybe Kane & Edge too, should have exclusive 4 disc editions as it will bring The Mcmahons money and that's all they want as we all know. Hey if Hogan can get a 4-disc set (9 disc if you include Hulk Still Rules & Unreleased Collector's Edition), then so can UT & Sting. Like them, love them, respect/admire/idolize them, or none at all, if you seen them, these facts cannot be denied.",1274140800,,6667,4.515886287625418
