8334554,2,B001PT6YGO,Not what I expected. I thought it was all Westerns but it was not. I thought Randolph Scott was in more but he was only in one which was the only one I enjoyed. Panhandler was excellant. I turned all the others off. It gets a 2 rating because Panhandler was my Uncles fav,1407456000,,271,4.037037037037037
8334555,5,B001PT6YGO,"Product was as expected, delivered before the promised date. I would recommend this to anybody. Nobody should miss seeing ""Panhandle."" Probably the first adult western Movie.",1373673600,,174,5.730769230769231
8334556,3,B001PT6YGO,"I have no choice but to rate this dvd on a collective multi-film basis.  I purchased it only to add Hellgate to my collection.  I'd rate that particular film as a 4.  The others ranged from mediocre to lousy.  The worst, by far, was Wildfire:  The Story of a Horse.  It contains all the traditional western clichs:  the handsome, two-fisted, fast-drawing cowpoke;  his dim-witted sidekick; the wealthy crook who runs things in town along with his gruff henchmen; the salty, boozy old-timer; the sweety-faced daughter, sister, wife, or steady girl of an unjustly killed honest man; the naughty but nice dance hall girl;  poker players, one of whom always cheats; and the scowling, tough-talking town marshal.  Fortunately, throughout the whole series, at least there weren't too many bandit or indian attacks, and no threatening rattlesnake got its head blown to bits.

As far as I'm concerned, Hellgate by itself was worth the price.  Why anybody had to lump it in with all that other yuck lies beyond my comprehension.  If those were ""darn good"", please don't show me the bad.

I'm afraid this review won't help Amazon sell too many more copies, except perhaps to lovers of those corny stereotyped ""when you've seem one, you've seem them all"" westerns.",1370390400,2,1253,4.9330143540669855
8334557,4,B001PT6YGO,"There are two good titles in this collection that make the package worthwhile--Charles Marquis Warren's HELLGATE and best of all PANHANDLE, an Allied Artist entry written by Blake Edwards. It isn't great by any stretch of the imagination but it's darn good. The rest of the package...well. Okay transfers.",1369872000,,305,5.244897959183674
8334558,4,B001PT6YGO,"This set of Westerns, while not so mainstream, are genuinely good entertainment. They are not action flicks, and will not necessarily satisfy those who are addicted to fast action shootouts, but the good guy does win, and it does feel good when he does. Acting is good, dialog is often corny, but for those who enjoy the Western stereotypical approach to drama and action will not be disappointed.",1262822400,,397,4.852941176470588
8334559,5,B001PT6YGO,"VCI Entertainment has a history of releasing excellent material that somehow has escaped notice of the major releasing companies. This present release (of six movies and several bonus features) brings to the viewer two very good, classic larger-budgeted Westerns (HELLGATE and PANHANDLE) and four ""B"" features. All films come from the Kit Parker Collection (mostly Lippert Productions, but some from other studios as well).

PANHANDLE was one of the first major productions by Monogram Picture's bigger budget releasing company, Allied Artists, and it may well be Rod Cameron's best outing in a Western. Done is Sepia tone, the film also stars the cavern-voiced Reed Hadley (as the 'baddie'). The VCI print is fine, in fact, the best I've seen for this film (which is given to us in its original sepia tone). It's an entirely enjoyable Western, with all sorts of nice touches that make it well-worth replaying. Watch for Cameron singing a little song...

HELLGATE may have been Lippert's best production during its short  existence, and in fact, it far outclasses many higher budget oaters of the period. Starring Sterling Hayden and Ward Bond, it's a replay of sorts of the classic ""Prisoner of Shark Island"" (the ordeal of Dr. Mudd) out West. Hayden, a veterinary doctor, tends to the wounds of a Confederate raider, and for his trouble, gets sent to a dreary prison in the middle of the desert. How he redeems himself and deals with commandant Bond make for a tense and exciting drama. Both Hayden and Bond excel in their roles. Dialogue is terse and sharp all round. The print is excellent, sharp and clear.

TRAIN TO TOMBSTONE stars Don ""Red"" Barry and, albeit a ""B"" Western, is superior to most B's being released in the early 1950s. Robert Lowery co-stars. Excellent print, good dialogue, and believable action and story line make this very entertaining.

WILDFIRE offers us early Eddie Dean (before he began his stint at PRC studios) and Bob Steele, co-starring. It's in Cinecolor, and believe it or not, the color holds up in this 1945 Western. Fine print and very entertaining, if a bit more intended for the (then) younger set....

OPERATION HAYLIFT and FANGS OF THE WILD are equally entertaining, with similar fine quality prints.

The Bonus material includes several ""shorts"" and some trailers, all well done and in great quality.

VCI calls this volume I; let's hope that volume II (and III?) are equally as good as this.  Highly recommended!",1240790400,18,2456,4.970731707317073
