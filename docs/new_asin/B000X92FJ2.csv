On the good side - it brings together a lot of the most influential perspectives in the sound healing world today, and shares some wonderful though basic information that is helpful to those interested in the path of sound as a tool for healing.  On the negative - first, thought this is of little importance to content, it's super dated.  Also, the ideas jump around throughout, and if I had to ask the question, ""what is the ultimate purpose of this film,"" I'm not sure I could answer with anything other than it's a very loose overview of sound healing.  There's also a cheesy new-agey feel that is peppered here and there that, to me, doesn't add anything worthwhile.",1486252800,,750,4.533333333333333

8227283,5,B000X92FJ2,This is a movie I've been showing to my harp therapy certification classes since 2002.  Great introduction to sound therapy and sound therapy pioneers.,1433894400,,151,5.291666666666667
8227284,5,B000X92FJ2,"Enjoyed this documentary.  It's one of those films that, when you watch it, you can see how much sound is an integral part of the ""Life-Force"" of the planet.",1403740800,3,157,4.413793103448276
8227285,4,B000X92FJ2,"This cd attracted my attention because I use tuning fork therapy in my healing sessions.
The material is good, but dated (20 years old).
I'd suggest The Living Matrix for an up-to-date, powerful video about the latest scientific evidence for alternative healing.",1338595200,6,262,5.261904761904762
8227286,5,B000X92FJ2,I saw this today. It's fascinating & informative. There are a good variety of sound healing modalities represented. Also there is a  lot of beautiful scenery. My only complaint is : I wish it was a lot longer ! :),1212278400,3,213,4.325
