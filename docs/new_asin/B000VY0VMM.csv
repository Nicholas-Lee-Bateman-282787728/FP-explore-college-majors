8220525,1,B000VY0VMM,"Definitely an inexpensively made, poorly made documentary of what should have been an interesting and informative subject matter, it was too bad it seems to be made by less than amateurs.  I am very disappointed in this video, for one, it does not even delve into the history or the actual hauntings.  It seems to be a poor compilation of the so-called hauntings, and mostly consists of poorly video'ed interviews of the haunted.  It really doesn't go into any legitimate investigations and at the end of the video you still may be confused about what is really happening.  I do not recommend this video to anyone.",1385683200,,614,4.764150943396227
8220526,5,B000VY0VMM,"I liked the first of the two, but this DVD is definitely my favorite. The filming itself was great, and the narrator did a great job as well. I could tell that a lot of time and effort was put into this DVD. The stories were great and the reenactments were done very well. Definitely recommended! I wouldn't walk to my car alone afterward :)",1284508800,,341,4.2615384615384615
8220527,5,B000VY0VMM,This is a review of true ghost stories from Ohio volume 2.  I was impressed.  There were more interviews with witnesses from the locations than the first DVD.  They also had more reenactments (in the actual establishments and houses) which provided an interesting complexity to the documentary.,1271808000,,294,5.212765957446808
8220528,5,B000VY0VMM,I picked up this dvd after reading about it in a local paper.  The article said it was featured on the today show.  So I figured if it's good enough for them then good enough for me.  It was!  This dvd was very well shot and the people who are interviewed tell first hand accounts of interactions with the ghosts.  The recreations were very good and gave you the creeps.,1252627200,,370,4.228571428571429
