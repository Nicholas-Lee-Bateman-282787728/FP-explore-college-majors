8325046,1,B000EOU4NA,"Unless your a beginner to exercise, don't waste your money. This is a totally cheesy, too easy DVD. This DVD should be on a discount rack. I can't believe it cost $25.00. The release date said 2006, but it was made it 1991 and video quality shows it. There is no title menu for different options or workouts. This DVD showed me nothing new. Do your own crunches and leg lifts and save 25 bucks. I expected the instructor on a phenomenal ab video to show some abs, not be dressed in an oversized T-shirt and shorts to her knees. Maybe I'm being too picky, but what a total disappointment. I'm going to try and get a refund.",1165363200,17,622,4.279661016949152
