8713777,4,B00WMCOQNG,The great Sol Kaplan wrote the score. One of his best is The Spy Who Came In From The Cold. The movie is pertinent to what is happening right now.,1533340800,,146,3.9
8713778,1,B00WMCOQNG,"First, the film itself is an excellent film. If you have the opportunity to see it, do so. It is stated that ""Salt of the Earth"" was the only film ever banned by the United states government. Watch it to see what the government thought was so dangerous about this film... the working class standing up to the corporate aristocracy and the government it controls. Watch it so you can see the parallel with what is happening today. The movie itself is deserving of your time. However, I purchased the FILM DETECTIVE ""restored"" DVD version and to say I was disappointed is an understatement. I am also disappointed that this was listed as an ""Amazon's Choice."" I would think that if one is ""restoring"" a film one would make sure you were using the proper aspect ratio. The entire film in this version has obviously been ""restored"" in the wrong aspect ratio. For lack of a better description, the picture is ""squeezed."" Everything appears out of proportion. It renders the film virtually unwatchable. ""Salt of the earth"" is a worthy addition to your DVD library. However, make sure you purchase from a source that has ""restored"" it in its proper aspect ratio.",1512604800,,1155,4.7227722772277225
8713779,5,B00WMCOQNG,"I saw this movie when I was 15 years of age, at an SDS convention in Chicago - actually, the last SDS convention ever held. Right after the convention ended (it was held in December/January...in Chicago!! BRRRR!....) the Weathermen split off. I guess Dylan was correct...""you don't need a Weatherman to know which way the wind blows.""

The women save the day & their men, miners. Perhaps the President should watch this movie, since it is basically about unsafe mines. (Or ""minds"" in his case)",1506211200,,493,4.8
8713780,5,B00WMCOQNG,"As yesterday afternoon I had some free time and as there was nothing worthwhile on TV (yes, it is true that it was the presidential debate but Im not a masochist) I saw again Salt of the Earth that I had received from Amazon a few days ago.

Filmed in Silver City, New Mexico, ""Salt of the Earth"" (1954) is, from my point of view, one of the best labor movies of all time. It is the story of the struggle of a union of miners, mainly Mexicans and Chicanos, who go on strike mainly due to unsafe conditions in the mine, as well as many other grievances. The mining company rejects the demands of the miners and since they remain firm in their struggle, the bosses attempt to use strikebreakers to halt the strike. The use of scabs fails and then the employer decides to use local police forces and the judge to repress and arrest the striking miners. When a restraining order under the Taft-Hartley Act is issued to break the picket line at the entrance to the mine, strikers face the dilemma of end their picket-line thus allowing the entrance of scabs or to continue their picket of the mine and risk to be arrested and taken to jail. Either decision will cause the end of the strike. Then the women take the initiative to replace the strikers to avoid defeat despite opposition from their husbands. Thus women, with their children and the support of other families from other places, and despite the pressures by the employers and the repression of local authorities, manage to maintain the strike and although the film don't show it, at the end their action serves to defeat the mining company.

This film was banned during the dark days of McCarthyism, the filmmakers, actors and film crew were accused of being communists and a ""threat to democracy"", and lead actress Rosaura Revueltas was deported to Mexico. The extraordinary about this film is that most of the actors were actually true miners, trade unionists and common people from the mining region.

The strength of ""Salt of the Earth"" is that every time you see it you can appreciate both the moral and conviction of the rebel workers and the sacrifice of their families, as well as the prejudices and natural imperfections of workers' struggles. In these times when the labor movement in general is going through a serious ethical crisis and the losing of most battles against capital, this film help to reminds us of what is the true meaning of the labor organization and how to defend the integrity of the workers struggle and more important, how to preserve the dignity of the working class.

The photo that appears with this review (below) is from the scene where Ramn Quintero (Juan Chacn) picks up his baby and is daughter from the jail where his wife Esperanza (Rosaura Revueltas), is imprisoned along with a large group of women accused for being the main instigators of the womens movement in support of the strike. Although Ramn is opposed to the involvement of his wife in the strike, this time he has to pick up his girls to care for them while his wife remains in jail.",1474934400,2,3046,4.614391143911439

The story begins in New Mexico with women washing clothes in the backyard. [You never saw this in those old western films.] They have lived in ""Zinc Town"" for generations. They no longer live on their land and are unhappy. An accident results in a protest against working alone - no one to check for trouble. The family worries about money and living conditions. The men worry about working conditions and safety on the job. A strike will cause hardships. They want raises, seniority, better conditions, and equality. Discrimination is used as a weapon. Celebrating a name-day is like a birthday where persons are named after the saint's day of their birth.

The people celebrate the birthday. Later women complain about the lack of indoor plumbing. A siren screech warns of trouble. The men refuse to go back down in the mine. [Mining, like farming, is the most dangerous work.] They voted to strike over equality in working conditions. The ladies want better sanitation. [You need electricity for running water, etc.] The managers plan to attack the strikers. Can they negotiate? Some are tempted to become strike-breakers. Ramon is arrested and worked over. [Leaders are always targeted.] Can their differences be resolved? Do the Anglos treat their women differently? Winning the strike means a better life for their children. The repossession of a radio is a sign. After seven months some workers went to other mines (hardship cases). They get help from other unions too.

The crisis came with an injunction against their strike. [This judge-made law is a weapon against organized workers.] The leader explains their choices: obey and lose the strike, disobey and be jailed and fined so the strike is lost. The International Union will back them up [democracy means home rule]. A woman points out that the injunction only applies to the miners! Some men laugh, but she is applauded. The discuss their options. They vote as a community, the motion carries. May women join this new picket line. Will they scatter like quail? There is conflict and tear gas. The women fight back. ""We shall not be moved."" Not even with tear gas. Some will be arrested, an informer points them out. ""Solidarity Forever."" The sick infant is released from jail.

Ramon and the other men work at home; they learn of the need for indoor plumbing. Equality for women? Should Ramon go away for hunting? They can use venison for food. The picket line goes on. The company threatened eviction to scare the workers into surrender. Striking miners arrive. The women take the furniture back into the home. The crowd stands, the sheriff and his men leave. The company decides to settle - for now. Will their children see a better world?

This film about working people was produced by the International Union of Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers. It was blacklisted by the movie theater chains and rarely seen until the 1980s. It is a pretty good story for a low-budget drama. You can compare it to the old westerns where the people united against a big landowner to save their ranches and homes. Christopher Jencks was later framed for perjury when a paid informer accused him of attending a Communist meeting. Later they learned this professional witness committed perjury since he was hundreds of miles away from the meeting he claimed he witnessed. The US Supreme Court voided Jencks' conviction (US v. Jencks). This movie is based on an historical event. Quintero may have owned all those lands but the mining company owned the mineral rights and could dig them up.",1471824000,,3569,4.892561983471074
8713782,4,B00WMCOQNG,was 24yr old and lived where this film was made. It is very realistic and realy shows the way things were there and then.,1470096000,,121,4.083333333333333
8713783,4,B00WMCOQNG,"If a bit awkward and rough edged in form, a bit on the nose in it's politics, and a bit melodramatic in it's telling, this story of a miners strike is an historically important early 'independent' film. Made by artists largely blacklisted from Hollywood for liberal beliefs, and/or for refusing to testify against others, this was the only film in U.S. history that was itself blacklisted, and kept out of theaters despite positive reviews.

Yet what it preached; basic dignity and rights for Hispanics, for women, and for workers could hardly be seen, even then, as a real threat to America -- had it not been for hysteria towards all things liberal, progressive, or intellectual - those things being lumped in with communist revolutionary activity.

It's remarkable for a 1954 film to see a U.S. film with all the leading roles being Hispanic, and played by Hispanics, not white actors in 'brown face'. Even more impressive is the film's early but potent feminist viewpoint.

The issue of women also adds a nice level of complexity to a story that could have felt too simplistic in terms of right and wrong. The male Hispanic workers are almost as guilty of oppressing their wives as the Anglo bosses are of oppressing their Hispanic workers. So there's an acknowledgment that everyone still had a lot to learn about creating an equal society in those days.

Along with the occasionally awkward acting (most of the cast were non-professionals) and occasionally too blatant speech-making, there are some very moving, human and inspiring moments.

And in a nice twist of fate, after being blacklisted from theaters and kept from the public, the film now resides on the U.S. National Registry of important films.

The blu-ray transfer improves on the DVD, but not as dramatically as one expects.  Still a bit soft, blacks a bit milky.",1456704000,,1833,4.912621359223301
8713784,4,B00WMCOQNG,"The Film Detectives are to be commended for finally bringing the controversial film ""Salt of the Earth"" to blu-ray. ""Salt of the Earth"" centers of a true story about a miners' strike that took place in New Mexico in 1951, and the film itself was made in the same geographic location in 1953 utilizing many persons who actually participated in the strike.

Some themes examined in this film are civil rights issues, workers' rights and collective bargaining, the rise of feminism, poverty in relation to families trying to make a living wage, and many more ""hot button"" topics that are still being discussed today.

After years of being condemned by many individuals and organized groups, ""Salt of the Earth"" is finally being recognized as one of the most important films ever made in the United States. In fact, ""Salt of the Earth was added to the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress in 1992 as a landmark film.

The amazing Hispanic actress Rosaura Revueltas was recruited from her home country of Mexico to play the ever-suffering wife of a local mine worker. Her husband doesn't seem to understand her desire for clean water, proper housing, and her love of the radio that they got on the ""easy payment plan."" Rosaura sees the radio as their only link to the outside world, while her husband sees the radio as just another financial burden.

A number of mining accidents finally brings tensions to a head forcing the miners to go on strike. The strike drags on, and the wives eventually take over the picket lines for their husbands. This leads to a confrontation between the local sheriff, his henchmen, and the miners' wives who are arrested and jailed (along with their children). I won't spoil the rest of the film by telling too much, but I will say that ""Salt of the Earth"" comes to a conclusion that some may find both rewarding and troubling.

I own three versions of ""Salt of the Earth"" on DVD. The first is the Aplha Video version which has okay picture and sound, but is still quite watchable. The second version is from Pioneer Video and is stated as being a ""digitally enhanced transfer.""  The picture and sound with this version are much better than the Alpha version. Also, the Pioneer version of the DVD contains an ample and interesting amount of ""special features.""

This brings us to The Film Detective blu-ray edition. From viewing this edition with a critical eye, I'm pleased to report that the picture is clear and very watchable. The sound is mostly very good, with a slight bit of static sound in some of the voice-over parts done by Rosaura Revueltas at the beginning of the movie. However, this is very minor and does not take away from the overall enjoyment of the movie.

Decent source materials for this film are hard to find. Therefore, assembling watchable scenes from various prints and other source materials can be a monumental undertaking, and The Film Detectives have done an admirable job of it.
