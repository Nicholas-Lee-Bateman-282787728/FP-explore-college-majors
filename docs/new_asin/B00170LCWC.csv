I watched this show religiously, and was so sad when it wound down and didn't get to continue, so I am very excited to see it finally being released on DVD!",1207267200,3,250,4.208333333333333
3165897,5,B00170LCWC,"I only wish that the season one finale had been two hours long; it deserved a longer exposition.  I have both my own copies on VHS (with commercials) and a bootleg DVD set (really poor quality).  Season two was not nearly as good as one, and seemed to be a bridge to a season three that never happened.  Season one came full circle and alone is worth the full asking price.  The best TV Sci-Fi I think ever!

I've now gotten the ""official"" DVD set and think that my previous remarks were on target for season one and too kind for season two.  Season one had a nice arc that did, indeed, come satisfyingly full circle.  Season two was abominable.  The first episode of season two makes zero sense given the concluding scene of the season one finale.  Then season two just goes down hill from there.  The writers (or whoever) didn't seem to know what to do with the series ... what it was about, what it wanted to say, where the characters were headed ... beyond filling an hour / episode.

Do yourself a favor and watch the first season.  Yancy Butler, as New York homicide cop Sara Pezzini, turns in her best performance ever. Do yourself another favor and do not watch the second season.",1207267200,2,1188,4.39908256880734
3165898,5,B00170LCWC,"I am truly shocked that it has taken this long to release this imaginative, well-written and popular series to DVD.  Countless programs that were far less creative and entertaining have been released to DVD while still on the air.

I can't help but wonder if this was delayed for so many years because of negotiations between the star, Yancy Butler, and the show's producers due to rumored animosities between the two sides.  I can't help but wonder if they didn't want Butler to see her residuals from sales/rental of the DVD release too soon.

Anyway, I'm glad that it's finally being released, and hope that someday they consider revitalizing the show.  It was very timely, relevant, with some great plot twists and performances, i.e., I particularly remember what a great villian Roger Daltrey played.",1207267200,7,805,4.977611940298507

3165903,5,B00170LCWC,"finally- the long wait is over. Witchblade ran for 2 seasons on TNT, and built quite a following in that 2 years before it was yanked from the schedule (although it was almost guaranteed a third after lead actress Yancy Butler won a Saturn Award for her performance).

3165907,3,B00170LCWC,"It was a series that got more boring as it got to the last DVD. Not that thrilling. When you start out on the first couple of shows, it seems quite strange and you try to keep up with the nonsense of the gauntlet on this woman. You find out sooner than later, that you just don't give a rats' butt about her newfound power. You are just slightly amused to keep up with the nonsense story.",1500595200,,388,4.0519480519480515

3165917,5,B00170LCWC,"An amazing series, with great acting, writing and direction! Witchblade franchise itself has one of the best stories of a non-Japanese fantasy/action comic book.
The TV series immediately skyrocket to the top rating series by its time (and still is the highest rating series to be cancelled) and it was cut unexpectedly, without a good reason instead of just pausing production until next season. It's really sad, specially given the way the series finale ended.

Now, about the DVD box itself, it`s totally worth buying! The box looks amazing and the extras have a lot of lore on the Witchblade franchise.",1478822400,4,606,5.0
3165918,5,B00170LCWC,I enjoyed it. I did see the series when it was on tv so it's no surprise  that I liked it.,1476057600,,90,3.2857142857142856
3165919,2,B00170LCWC,"I absolutely love this series (Witchblade).  This is live-action, not to be confused with the anime.  It started as a television movie that proved so popular in ratings and reviews that they created a series out of it.

The TV film aired in August of 2000.  It's pretty good.

The first season aired during the summer of 2001, ending 21 days before 9/11 which was eerie considering this series takes place in New York City and is about strange coincidences and deja vu with the number 11 relating to all significant events.  ""Parallel lines always meet"".  We follow a new york city cop that loses friends of hers and talks to the dead, wishing she could turn back time and stop them from dying.

Season two aired the following summer and (like season one) got stellar cable ratings.  The lead actress had drug/alcohol problems and production stopped in the middle of the season so she could go to rehab.  Production then continued to its end (they even compressed what was to be the final two episodes and combined them into one just to finish it quickly).  Despite the great ratings, TNT decided to cancel the series.  It was a very surprising announcement (though probably not to the cast and crew).  It was obvious it was because they no longer trusted the lead actress to work and that was it for Witchblade.  It's extremely unfortunate, but I am so thankful to have these two seasons.  It's really all that's needed to fall in love and be enamored with it for the rest of my life.  I'm deeply in love with this series.

The problem with this DVD set is that the iconic and essential music throughout the series is replaced (the TV film is the only one that retains all the music and is complete).  While an executive producer graciously picked some new music (some actually pretty damn good) its no substitute for what was and should be.

Now the replacing of music is understandable (yet still unforgivable) due to the BS copyright mania, but what isn't excusable is the edited Season 2 premiere on the set.  They used what would have been syndicated cuts for the first two Season 2 episodes  which originally comprised the season 2 premiere (which originally aired as one 90 minute episode and later aired as a TV film called 'Witchblade 2').  This big premiere episode was the pinnacle of excitement for this series.  I remember watching this when it premiered on Father's Day 2002.  (The episode actually dealt with an estranged father and his daughter, and had Yancy Butler's real-life estranged father communicating with her about missing his daughter.  Great synchronicity and parallels.  Just another layer of that spooky feeling to add to this.)  The life-affirming wonder in this premiere is what this series was all about.  It was the best of Witchblade.  Which is why it hurts that its edited down in this DVD set.

I couldn't allow this to be the only existing way Witchblade is to be viewed.  I took the DVDrips from the internet and (with the help of some TVrips) took the original audio and edited the original music (original sound) back into the series.  So I've uploaded the only real way to watch Witchblade (widescreen with original soundtrack) and even included the uncut Season 2 premiere that is not on the DVD.  So its out there if you look.  I can't say where because its not allowed here.  I'm already saying too much.

I have absolutely no desire to ever watch this DVD set (which I own).  It's not the true series.  You're going to have to download it through alternate means to see the real thing.  And you absolutely should.

The series itself gets more than 5/5 stars.  But the DVD set I can't give much to.  I'm only thankful it exists so that I could have the impeccable video to use for the proper edit.  The missing uncut season 2 premiere hurts it a lot.

(The 'Cry Little Sister' remix from the end of Season One just started playing from a random list of 5000 songs on my ipod.  You won't find that awesome moment in the DVD set.)",1475280000,11,3974,4.598290598290598

3165947,5,B00170LCWC,"I remember seeing this series on television and I thought it was pretty unique with its supernatural elements. It was almost akin to Buffy with a strong female character. Actually, this series actually made me interested in the comic version, which it came from. Even though I was saddened this series didn't go beyond the two season (I think or maybe it was one long season), I was delighted when it came out and I immediately snatched this up. I didn't give it a second thought.

3166015,1,B00170LCWC,"You should read the 5-star ratings if you want a good review.

I found the acting better than the stories, especially the second season which seemed to lose threads started in season 1.  The efforts by the actors elevated the stories to interesting and I was, at first, absorbed and interested.  There were some distorted views of Christianity that I did not care for.  But, after all, that was sort of the premise of the Witchblade itself.  Saying any more would be a spoiler.  I'll recommend to shoppers and viewers - don't watch it if your beliefs are easily offended.  The lack of morality by the main character wielding what, I would have thought, was something Holy was a major disconnect.  I kept hoping through season 1 and started season 2.  Then I quit.

I don't buy entertainment to watch people in bed and I can't say how much of those scenes were in the last episodes, I stopped watching before the last episode.  I collect DVDs but I occasionally run into one I don't want to watch again and might regret what I did watch.

They even worked in some tales from Grimm's writings and give reason for the violence of present day.
Now to bias things just a tad, Yance Butler is smokin' hot it the lead role. The comic book, yes, has Sara proportioned like a barbie doll and built like a 80's stripper. The live action Sara has more the body of the physical trainer from the biggest loser. She is just what the character needs to be to survive in this day and age.

The story and action sequences are distinguished from most other shows by a graphic novel sensibility, which adds another dimension to the storytelling, and makes the series more intriguing. The story is clever and draws the viewer in, but just when you feel that the show might start getting too smart for its own good, it returns to its basic premise of good woman cop (with special powers) vs baddies (with or without special powers). But, just when you think it might start getting stuck in a ho-hum girl v baddies thing, there is another twist in the narrative to grab your attention again.

3166055,4,B00170LCWC,"I personally loved this series, but that said, I had a few issues with it.

As others have mentioned, the whole cop thing was just a fad almost and it was due to writing and costume designed poorly (in places). Sorry, cops don't dress that way. it was so obvious that this type of thing did bother and distract me a lot. The effects were good, not great but not bad. No real procedure following, so many bodies left laying around, ect. Again it leaves you wondering what happened. Yes the witchblade is more of a bullet dodger in the show. After reading the comic this can bother some, yet to the new viewer it probably won't. This was done because the effects caused TNT (TV channel)too go much over budget.

After I saw this, I compared it with the comic. Yes the show is more about Sara, but it had to be so the viewer could 'care' about her. I loved her tough act, but her clothes were inappropriate to the role. (stomach out? And she is beautiful, throaty). Yancy is not the soft classic beauty, but she is still beautiful and I found I liked her more than the waif thin long haired bright eyed 18 year old actresses they could have done. No, Yancy nailed it and was the right girl. I didn't care that Sara was this long haired comic beauty. Sara was a woman and Yancy was all woman and not a teenager. YES!

Some scenes are amazing: Like how the witchblade attaches, how Sara is tested by it in bed, how Sara fell in love.

The series was canceled because of budget and the actress struggle with drinking. I was sad. Anyway, down to the grit. The redo in season 2 was eh at best, but the time line changes pretty fast so you are not bored, and then comes in Irons. Someone had the right eye for casting this guy. I loved it right away. it did feel cheap, but it made a pretty good story once things got moving and they did move right away. I loved Irons, and I did love Nottingham. I wish Sara would have been closer with him. I can only imagine if they made the darkness series and that would be great.

As far as Nottingham, there was more of a one sided affection and a too drawn out thing with Nottingham with his glove. It was great and symbolic but it never got far. I loved it, but it took too long. The blood issue that kept people young was weird and kind of gross so I'll keep that under wraps for spoiler reasons. This was one of those things that didn't work for me. The story itself was awesome for season one. I loved her and Concubar. I think this was well done. even the fact he rode a bike added to why she would like him. Her romance never bothered me...it felt right in that it was awkward for her. She's a tomboy who is very stubborn.

More witchblade story itself would have been great, but we got so much lore in season one I felt satisfied. The whole jealousy thing between one character and the other was also drawn out. IDK, for all it lacked and the sometime feeling of being strung along. I think its worth a watch. There will always be a few things that will be mediocre from the actual fact, it just depends how much they stick out and personally bug you. I am not so drawn to detail it bothered me. I was able to engross myself with the characters enough. It does lack direction at times, but doesn't all series? It's more about a woman with power and the choices she makes despite all the obstacles of the power hungry people around her.

Could it have been better? Heck ya, was it worth 20 bucks, sure. It was the way it was written, and delivered more than anything else. Just remember its an older series and not as 'up to date' as new shows as far as procedures. Now they wear gloves and That satisfies me and makes it seem a bit more real. You will not get that from this series.

I loved Nottingham, the twist they added to his character, and his line ""I love you...in unguarded moments."" I just wish they made him a bit more emotionally mature. He was too kiddish with his affection-which was understandable, he was raised for a reason and his feeling is completely new to him. it just didn't come across as well as it could have. And it took too long. There was supposed to be a love hate thing, and while it was kind of there, I felt it missed the spirit of it all.",1365897600,,4211,4.202970297029703

I was only vaguely aware of Witchblade. When the series aired I was too busy working to watch it but I remember being curious. Anyway, fast-forward several years, I just bought the series. Wow. The first season was interesting. It didn't have the ""superhero"" feel that I was expecting. It had the feel of a ""regular"" cop show with the occasional supernatural element. Once I got past that I began to enjoy it; the writers were taking their time and they seemed to have a plan for where they wanted the characters to go. There was some serious character development. All in all, I'd call season one a success. Now, let's talk about season two. In season two, the writers systematically UNDID EVERYTHING in that was accomplished in season one. Season two brought Danny Woo back to life with no explanation, killed Kenneth Irons, and suddenly, the White Bulls never existed? A different....timeline? Are you kidding me?

3166063,5,B00170LCWC,"I stumbled upon this show while flipping through the channels when it first aired, and I usually like to watch Yancy Butler as she was a good actress and a wonderful personality. Admittedly, I have not read any of the ""Witchblade"" comic books nor do I understood the story behind it.

After first watching this series of ""Witchblade,"" I was a bit confused by the storyline and bits of the elements. But now, after watching it again with a fresh expectation, I found it to be an interesting show and quite enjoyable. It is a story of a detective (Sara Pezzini) who is searching for justice and that search brings her into a contact with an ancient arm-shield called the Witchblade, a mysterious weapon that can fight the darkness. That was the beginning of her journey to the unknown and strange experiences. Along the way, she has discovered her lineage as a wielder of this ancient weapon, which is an interesting bit.

It is the 2nd season that messes things up
It is boring disjointed and nonsensical  and that's saying something good about

The story was real weak and the main focus of the story was not the Withblade, but Yancy's character, Police Detective Sara Pezzini and that took away from the whole mystique of the Witchblade legend.

As I said before, Yancy Butler is a beautiful actress, but this show left her character seeming more butch than femme and that turned my interest away from the show. Maybe it's the fanboy in me, but you should skip this show and stick with the comic for all the greatness that is the Witchblade mythos.",1356739200,,648,4.4

I found the lead actresses vocals to be grating and her eyebrows looked like two wooly caterpillars fighting.  Both were very distracting.  The lead villian was less than sinister and cartoon like.  The only standout character was Ian Nottingham.  There were far to many music video montages where she would ride her motocycle or they played medieval stock footage.  Overall could not keep my attention.,1352332800,,542,4.826086956521739

With all the fast cuts & unnecessary strobe flashing, I think it helped to accentuate the violence, & like most people (at the time it aired) I was probably just desensitized to the violence.

3166101,5,B00170LCWC,"It is rare to find a show that kept me on the edge of my seat as this series did. Witchblade's Yancy Butler encompasses the essence of her character. I'm not familiar with the comic it spans off from but as a show it was a gem. The chemistry in the cast was electrifying and the stories didn't disappoint, at least not for me. Sara Pezzini is a cop who encounters a gauntlet that can only be worn by women who are chosen by it. These women are tied together in some way from Joan of Arc to others. Sara fights evil using this gauntlet (which turns into a bracelet) giving her extraordinary abilities. Kenneth Irons is her arch enemy trying to poses the wichblade and its bearer.
During the early part of the millennium this show was rated #1 in TNT's lineup (a cable channel in the US) but it is believed that the show was cancelled because of reports of Yancy Butler's battle with alcoholism resulting in checking herself into a rehab facility for 30 days in the middle of shooting the series.

Though there are a hand full of episodes that were well developed and thought provoking  with good twists, the series was mostly very predictable and repetitious.  It had great potential but unlike a comic book series where each episode is short and the artwork is a big focus, a one hour show has to deliver more detail and more character complexity to be successful.  Comics can rely on great artwork and viewer imagination to fill in the blanks - a TV show doesn't have that luxury.  Easy to see why it only ran one season.

Season 2 was mainly a bunch of stand-alone episodes that did not keep me ""hooked."" The story progressed a little, but not with the same energy that made the first season such a rush.

3166118,4,B00170LCWC,"Years ago when TNT was sort of foraying into Original Series, they attempted to adapt a comic book written by Top Cow, what emerged was a show that wouldn't have lasted more than a few episode on a major television network but settled in quite comfortably in the basic cable network round up. The first season was one of the better cable shows out there, while fans of the original comic (who prefer more faithful adaptations) won't be fond of it. Those who don't mind some leeway in their adaptations would definitely enjoy it. Three dimensional characters with real flaws and just enough about them to make us admire or hate them but also SEE them as real people. The second season however, tried some theme and plot and character changes that was detrimental to the show and combined with behind the scenes problems with the lead actress and semi decreased viewership the show was canceled sadly after season two.

The first season sets up the series as Sara Pezzini (Yancy Butler), a cop who stumbles upon an ancient artifact that finds it's way onto her wrist known as the 'Witchblade', a magical artifact, that can be worn only by women (a major plot point) and only by women of a certain chosen bloodline. Blessing her with visions, increased stamina and healing and fighting skills, the Witchblade has a lot of appeal and one can see why someone wants to possess it, however  the price one can pay for it is not shied away from in the series either. As Sara goes through some personal tragedy, namely the loss of the only partner the maverick cop was attached to, Danny Woo (Will Yun Lee). We see her grow as a character as she's stalked by Ian Nottingham (Eric Etebari), a flunky of Kenneth Irons (Anthony Cistaro) a man with seeming immortality whose obsession with possessing the Witchblade is palpable to the viewer as well, the first season tried an overreaching plot arc that was slowly but masterfully revealed as the season went on. Witchblade was quite capable of maintaining several subplots over a long period of time without detracting from one to feed the other, we see Sara's new partner Jake McCarty (David Chokachi) stalk down the strange society known as the ""White Bulls"" and we get introduced to Gabriel Bowman (John Hensley), a young man whose strange knowledge of supernatural artifacts is a badge for his own mysterious past and connection to Sara. Special effects were far from amazing, but in some ways were better than ones presented on other science fiction shows. The actors were all well suited to their roles and went at them without hackneyed relish. Butler portrayed Pezzinni as likeable, tough, sensitive and realistic. Whereas other actresses could have gone the route of too tough unlikable bimbo, Butler made Sara a very real person we could all relate to. Yun Lee gets reduced to a corny""mystical asian"" stereotype in a lot of ways as a Ghost who sticks around to help his partner but, Yun Lee plays Danny Woo as very likeable who does what he can for the character of Sara. Cistaro can be corny as Irons in certain points but he's still a villain one loves to hate and Nottingham's growth over the first season makes it memorable. Chokachi's turn as Jake is also masterful as the still semi fresh from Baywatch actor proved he *could* carry a character in a more series show. The first season ended on a high note with promise of the second.

The second season is where the show lost some of its heart as the production was plagued with personal issues from the main actress and the show's theme and execution was changed for the worse. The show abandoned the masterfully single plot arc encompassing an entire season with smaller sub plot episodes that ultimately connect to a whole to make it ""easier"" to follow and kept it regaled to baddie of the week type situations or in this case ""Pretend Wielder of the Witchblade"" of the week. What resulted was a show that didn't have the patience and time to really show off the actor's skill or the writers skill, but all the flaws of the series brought forward. Filled with weak episodes and ridiculous character development, the time shift at the end of Season One left us retreading some of the same ground as season one and this time definitely not for the better. Danny Woo is forced to take the angry Mary Jane ala Spiderman role of character who knows *something* is going on, but not what and ends up being shown as petulant when the person they care about is running around *obviously* hiding secrets from them. Jake is barely shown this season and Nottingham, one of season ones most admirable characters ""evolves"" from the first season to silent, but likable side character into angsty pseudo corny philosophy spouting person whom this viewer wanted Sara to dump off the end of a high cliff. Even the brilliant Irons is diminished as a character. The show went down a worse off path that could have potentially been saved had it not been prematurely cancelled.

Well done over all, with a few flaws here and there one wishes the show could have gone on longer then it actually did. Technically the show was very well filmed and acted and while certainly not a scifi classic it's one of the best feminist themed science fiction series out there. Definitely recommended.",1296604800,3,5270,4.70021645021645

3166120,2,B00170LCWC,"THE GOOD:
The soundtrack is incredible. Really, really good music.

There is plenty of eye candy. It's the Baywatch of the fantasy genre: all beauty and little depth. Eric Etebari is stunning to look at. Yancy Butler's physicality overwhelms her skilled acting. The beauty of the actors is the sole reason for both stars in my rating.

THE BAD:
Very poor quality writing in this show. It's repetitive, especially the use of the word ""Witchblade."" It would be easy to turn it into a drinking game. The story arcs are flat, predictable, and straight out of the box. Ubiquitous chase scenes, anyone? If that isn't bad enough, at the end of the first season, the show uses a cheap plot device to negate everything. The following season recycles almost all the plot points from the first. It's so lazy and even hostile to the audience.

I had little patience for the villain dialogue. Maybe I should say villain monologues. The bad guys seemed to be on their own wavelength most of the time. The non sequitur gibberish these characters spewed was jarring. The occasional riddle coming out of a character's mouth adds some interest. But, these guys never say what they mean, ever. How did they manage to amass their evil empire with such minuscule communication skills?

I suspect the writers were aiming for profound and mysterious. They landed on dumb instead.

THE UGLY:
It is unintentionally funny, too. The scenes where Ian Nottingham has long conversations with inanimate objects (paintings, his father's preserved hand) are just beyond endurance. I don't know what the writers were going for there. Maybe they needed to be told that ""talk to the hand"" is a figure of speech. I cringed for the actor.",1295568000,4,1700,4.848275862068966
3166121,4,B00170LCWC,"Back in 2000, when the series began, my wife and I became devoted fans. We looked for it on DVD but never found it. Well we finally gave up and stopped looking. Now I find it on Amazon 10 years later only to find out it was released in 2008!

I think this was one of the best series of its genre produced - even by todays standards. Yancy Butler plays the roll of Pezz quite deftly and the supporting cast is awesome. When we first started watvhing the episodes I had a difficult time - because I was trying to remember the series. I finall gave up and simply started enjoying the episodes as if I were seeing them for the first time. My enjoyability went up immensely.

If you remember, and enjoyed, this series then I highly recommend adding it to your library. The video quality is good but the audio provided is acceptable but sub-par by 2008 standards, I would have preferred a digital remastered 5.1 soundtrack.

I picked this up at a post xmas sale for fun and I must say I thoroughly enjoyed watching the series.  So much of the Sci-Fi/Fantasy work produced these days is dominated by computerized effects and images and as a result it doesn't in the end feel real or believable.  Witchblade however relies on filmography, soundtrack, and plot to produce a visually striking, gripping, and entertaining experience.  Usually when I watch sci-fi/fantasy shows that are 10 years old I get distracted by the primitiveness of the special effects and I was expecting that when I started watching this series. Instead I was drawn in and thoroughly enjoyed it. I think it underscores for me that so much of what is being turned out now has a 'plastic' quality in terms of the craftsmanship and presentation.  CGI has given us tremendous new options, but maybe they are getting too caught up in the tool and losing sight of the overall product?

Season one is superior to season 2 in terms of plot and story arc. I've never read the comic so I have no complaints about the 'adaptation'.",1294185600,,1142,4.600985221674877
3166124,3,B00170LCWC,"Firstly, all entertainment reviews are subjective, but here's the impression of Witchblade. I enjoy Sci-Fi and mystery both, so this looked like an excellent storyline, a good combination.
A woman detective comes into possession of an ancient artifact of power and uses it to preserve her life as she fights crime and the forces opposed to her possession of the artifact. So far so good, it could have had the potential to be extremely long running, but then sadly fell from its potential as it failed to focus on character development. Even the little human interaction that did take place when the principle slowly lost many of those nearest and dearest to her as the episodes progressed, and one actually began to be drawn into the elements of the main character dealing with grief, loss, love, hate, and our lesser daily challenges, along comes an episode that neatly rewinds time, effectively eliminating the bonds built up around the human aspect and effectively takes the viewer back to episode 1 as it continues a different themed storyline from ~ episode 10 with the same original group of characters / actors.
That's when it became a bit too far fetched even for my somewhat esoteric tastes.

The recommendation - worth watching if you're a sci-fi buff, or just enjoy magic based shows, but if you want a believable ongoing storyline with developing characters that progress in a way you can easily relate to and identify with, then we'd have to say it's better to spend your money elsewhere.",1290729600,5,1502,4.8671875

The main character, Sara, is a reincarnation of Joan of Arc. The witchblade appears on her arm whenever she is in danger. Sara is a homicide detective and ever since she acquired the witchblade, she has been getting some strange cases. There's not a lot of romance as Sara is too busy fighting crime and weird guys to have a boyfriend. It's just pure action throughout the whole show.

 The producers didn't waste a lot of money on props (or clothes for the characters either as Sara wore jeans about the whole first season, but the stories will keep you on the edge of your seat for sure). Another good series similar to this one is Blood Ties. It's also in book form and on dvd.",1269907200,3,802,4.375838926174497
3166132,2,B00170LCWC,"I'm probably gonna get reamed by not-helpfuls from fans of this show, but I felt so misled by the existing reviews that I felt compelled to write one of my own to try and help others like me avoid making the same mistake I did.

For context, I was not familiar with the comic, so came to the show with fresh eyes as someone who is a huge fan of SF and fantasy. (Some of my all time favorite TV shows are Babylon 5, Buffy, and Xena.) The majority of the negative comments here deal with the music being changed for the DVD eps, not being true to the comic, and not making good use of the witchblade, along with issues over the season two redo. But only a small number of the negative comments deal with the things I thought were wrong with the show.

Before I go into why I think the show was a disaster I will say that I very much enjoyed Yancy Butler as Sara and I think it's a shame that the show was not up to her talents because she had what it takes to carry a TV series. Some of the other casting was pretty good too. I especially liked the characters of Gabriel and the medical examiner (can't remember her name) who was funny. Since I didn't see the show on TV I wasn't disappointed by the music on the DVD set and I actually thought that the songs part of the soundtrack was a strongpoint. I looked up info on the web about several of the songs used.

But a strong lead and good music doesn't a successful TV show make. It depends on so many elements that all have to come together in just the right way and this didn't happen with Witchblade. It's a bit difficult for me to put my finger on *exactly* what was wrong in the big picture sense. It seemed to have all the right elements, but the elements were not crafted into a finished, polished piece. A major drawback was just plain crummy writing and poor choices made about story arcs and plot development. The plots never managed to be compelling. And has been mentioned, the time reset for season two didn't come across as anything other than a cheap, tired, overdone gimmick.

One of my major specific complaints about Witchblade is the incredibly awful job they did of making it a cop show. I love the idea of blending cop show with urban fantasy. But wow, you need to at least attempt to make the cop part realistic in order to carry off making the fantasy part believable. I don't mean it needs to be an NYPD Blue, but come on. Episodes had Sara shooting people and leaving the bodies without it ever coming back to haunt her, contaminating crime scenes, and basically ignoring every basic procedure and protocol for a homicide detective. This was all compounded by the medical examiner (as much as I enjoyed the character) doing the same ignoring of all procedures and protocols. Anyone who has ever watched one decent cop/crime/mystery/thriller show could have done a better job.

Another major drawback, and this has been mentioned by others, was the character of Nottingham. Half of the problem can be laid at the actor's feet and the other half at the writers'. Some of the worst, overwrought, attempting-to-be-profound-but-sounding-stupid-instead lines were given to him.

In the end, the lack of compelling story arcs and good writing, along with stupefyingly abysmal cop show elements made me bored (and frequently disgusted) with it all. At the best it was bland television, at the worst it was annoying television. Normally when I'm watching a TV series on DVD I have marathon episode watching sessions. With Witchblade I actually went three weeks before finally watching the final few episodes just to say I had finished the whole thing.",1269820800,22,3616,4.521406727828746

There are some cheesy moments, and the special effects are not top notch, but they're still good.

The first season was great, but the second season felt like the beginning of a long series.  There should have been more seasons to wrap up the story.  Season one is one long story with a good and hopeful ending.  It should have stopped after the first season or gone 3 or 4 more seasons to reach a proper finish.

I read somewhere that Yancy Butler had to go to rehab and they cancelled the show.

The characters are fairly good:  All the cops are good, Ken Irons is pretty good, although not as big and strong as the comic, and Ian Nottingham is sometimes laughable in his manorisms and pouting face.  The comic showed him as stoic (i think) and this show makes him childlike mostly.

Lastly, (obviously the budget wasn't there) the Witchblade doesn't really do much cool stuff.  No shooting fire, minimal organic tendrils or morphing.  Mostly it's metal and either sword-gauntlet, armor or both.  It seems its only powers are blocking bullets (which gets really old) and giving Pezzini some psychic powers (plus some time control).

The stories and writing of the first few episodes are solid, esoteric, and cleverly setting up an interested arc for Det. Sarah ""Pez"" Pezzini. As played by Yancy Butler, (who I feel should not be wearing men's boxers to bed. COME ON!), gives her character the right amount of toughness and vulnerability.

The serie fascinates because of (although the theme is old, the battle between good and evil) the combination of honesty, dedication, time transcending views, deliberate action taken in pursuit of the good and the idea of a 'mythical force' that balances good and evil arising when necessary.

3166170,3,B00170LCWC,"Not familiar with the comic book series, I offer a review that is independent of that influence.

First off, this is the darkest series I have ever seen, and I mean that both literally and figuratively.  The mood is dark, the plots are about multi-generational mystical you-name-it, and even in the practical supposedly everyday world of NYC crime, it falls into the level of weird conspiracies and whom-can-you-trust mode.  But this series is also lit dark, to remind you of some permanent netherworld, I guess, cause there are few daylight scenes and even when people go home at night or work in their office, they seem to be underlit at all times.  Most people walk into a room and turn on a light!  But not these guys.  Like they are all mole-people.  As a viewer, it can be hard on the eyes.

There are cliches abundance, though the bodice-ripping attire of the female lead is spared us.  The lead actress is good, there's no fault with her, but I couldn't imagine wanting to spend any personal time with her character.  For some reason, though, her new partner falls for her, which is part of that cliche world.  The lead who holds the witchblade in this generation is a one-woman crime force that obeys the rules that suit her, ignores those that don't, and did so even before she was supernaturally equipped.  Oh, yeah, we've even got a ghost hanging around to advise her, like she didn't have enough problems already.

The other characters are over-the-top, including a pale blond villain who seems to be an outcast from a James Bond thriller.  And his henchman is an extreme psycho, but generally under control of the master.  The acting isn't too great on this front.  The lead male, the woman's cop partner, has the weird and unbelievable background of having been midwest born and raised but is also a Miami beach legendary surfer turned NYPD cop whom everyone has heard of (he's a legend) even though there's not many people who really follow surfing.  I mean, this whole surfer-turned cop scenario deserved an entire hour of explanation but this background just seems to sit there as if waiting for another series called SURFER COP.

Unfortunately, this series would have been best-served as a miniseries.  The first season has both individual and carryover plot lines that reach a summation, a literal one with everyone dead at the end.  And that would have been fine as is.  Not at all fun, but fine.  Instead the second season is a total revamp - like first season was an entire dream sequence - and in making that revamp they commit career and audience support suicide.  Even the male lead of the series, now due to new circumstance, has to become a supporting character despite his billing.  The plot lines, for those who like the continuing, tend to be self-contained.  Most fans judge the second season to have been a huge mistake, that the first season contained all they were looking for.",1239667200,2,2912,4.718811881188119

As I watched the saga unfold, I realised I had forgotten many minor plot elements, the richness of some of the character details, the pseudo-spiritual underpinnings.

Sad as I was to see the series end prematurely, in retrospect, it ended in a way that really did give us a wonderful resolution, yet showed us that the battle between good and evil (yes, they DO exist) does not end in the defeat of our foes, for as long as greed and a lust for power remain in the world.

Stellar production, intelligent dialogue, sometimes a bit ""comic bookish"", but it's based on a comic to begin with. If you've never seen this show and you like things like Buffy and other 'dark' gothic tinged stuff, this will work for you.",1239062400,,838,4.428571428571429

3166180,4,B00170LCWC,"The most amazing thing about the Witchblade TV series was that there WAS a Witchblade TV series.  The show premiered before the influx of genre shows that we've seen over the past few years and the fact that the character is not exactly a household name made it even more incredible.  As in the Top Cow comic it is based upon (created by Marc Silvestri) it centers on New York Detective Sara Pezzini who comes into possession of the powerful artifact known as the Witchblade and wielded by only women down through the centuries.  The gauntlet literally falls right on her hand in the series pilot film as Sara engages in a shootout with a mob gang member in a museum.

The pilot films throws a lot at the viewer.  Sara's partner, Danny, is murdered by Tommy Gallo, a notorious hit man, but soon after Sara begins to see Danny's ghost.  She is followed by the mysterious Ian Nottingham who works for the wealthy Kenneth Irons.  Irons seems to have intimate knowledge of the Witchblade yet teases Sara with only bits and pieces as you begin to suspect his motives are more sinister.  With Danny's death, Sara is paired with rookie detective Jake McCartey as her new partner.

The show ran for two seasons and a total of 24 episodes (including the pilot) and did reasonably well in the ratings for TNT.  Its cancellation had less to do with ratings and more to the difficulties of star Yancy Butler.  An admitted alcoholic, Butler's problems with the bottle forced production to shut down for several weeks during the second season.  In 2003, she was arrested for disorderly intoxication and ordered into rehab.

Throughout the first season, Sara began to learn more and more about the powers of the Witchblade and her own mysterious lineage while coping with everything from common crooks to demonic priests.  One of the key episodes of the first season is ""Periculum"".  The Witchblade traps Sara on her bed as she is put through a test to see if she is worthy of carrying weapon.  In a dreamlike state, Sara encounters previous blade wielder Joan of Arc as well as Emily Bronte, Sara's earlier incarnation.  This episode is very important as it reveals a great deal about Sara's background, the Witchblade's history, as well as Irons' connection to it.

The strangest episode of season one is ""Transcendence"" in which Sara uses the Blade to reverse time...all the way back to the show's beginning, bringing Danny back to life and forcing Sara to reacquaint herself with Irons, Nottingham, and her friend, Gabriel.  Planned or not, it seemed as if the producers either didn't like, or wanted to change the direction of the show to make it darker and more confrontational and the episode ends up re-booting the entire show going into season two.

The show's cast all played their parts extremely well for the most part, especially Etebari as Nottingham and Cistaro as Irons.  Irons was like a better-mannered and more enigmatic Lex Luthor in terms of being an arch-rival.  He almost made you believe he really was interested in helping Sara early on in the show.  At the risk of sounding sexist, Yancy Butler isn't the most attractive actress around.  I certainly wasn't expecting a Marc Silvestri picture-perfect comic version of the character onscreen but a choice of an actress who exuded a bit more femininity would have been nice.  Butler certainly had the ""tough"" side down cold but it almost made you wince when she had to do romantic scenes (although they are fairly few and far between). Witchblade was generally well-written although it does tend to move very methodically when it comes to revealing the Witchblade and Sara's secrets.

The seven disc set feature an all-new soundtrack chosen by the Executive Producer that includes an assortment of hard, grunge, and alternative rock selections.  Take that for what it is because how many people really remember the original soundtrack from eight years ago?  Witchblade was a complex and ambitious show.  Until shows like ""Lost"" and ""Heroes"" came along, there really were not genre shows that spread so many diverse plotlines.  Who knows where the show might have gone if Butler had not been battling alcoholism.

A solid group of extra including three featurettes and original casting sessions rounds out the set.",1233014400,7,4271,4.857734806629834

It could have been really good, but it all falls apart due to writers having their hands tied by a limited budget.

Throughout the two seasons of the show, the writers seem to actively avoid using the main plot device (i.e. the Witchblade) like the plague because they know that their limited budget will not do it justice. When it does come time for some Witchblade fighting, we are exposed to bad techno music and strobe lights to make the lame special effects look better than they really are. And every single fight looks exactly the same. The writers must have known this was a problem, so they try to avoid having combat whenever possible. What we are left with is a series that has a supernatural background, but tries to ignore it at every opportunity. This series just fails to do the franchise justice.",1229817600,4,975,4.477528089887641

The first half of the season is intriguing enough and has a compelling yearn to watch the next episode while the second half loses pace and suffers from weaker screenwriting which is probably why it never made it to a second season. Amusing character portrayed by Eric Etebari who is heavily infatuated with the heroine and basically an errand boy for a wealthy industrialist who seeks to control the ""ultimate weapon"" lends a somewhat comic flavor to the proceedings.

3166194,5,B00170LCWC,"I saw the series when it initially aired on TNT, and I found it fresh, exciting and captivating. The combination of pure escapist fantasy and cop drama worked well in this incarnation. Yes, it was strange, but strange doesn't mean that it wasn't entertaining. By juxtaposition of an ages-old metaphysical history against Sara Pezzini's attempts to cope with that in the framework of her contemporary physical world, it created a whole new universe for the writers to dabble in. I believe that people who enjoyed ""Sliders"" ""Farscape"" and ""Quantum Leap"" would have enjoyed this show, as well.

All good drama contains conflict, and in this case the conflict was manifest in Sara's efforts to reconcile the mundane and the metaphysical. At first a hard-bitten cynic, we see Sara slowly and begrudgingly grow spiritually and emotionally as she begins to accept and embrace her destiny as the current bearer of the Witchblade.

I was introduced first to the TV series, and then I want back to check out the comic: yet I found the series more accessible. At points during the series you were left wondering along with Sara if she was hallucinating or having visions of events that actually happened--which helped build tension in the storyline.

The important thing is that within the context of that story, it made sense, and helped move the plot forward effectively. It makes no sense to attempt to bring comic-book characters to the big screen, if all you're going to do is regurgitate the comic-book legend exactly as it appeared in print. An effective re-imagining actually takes old characters and makes them fresh and relevant again, as in the re-imagining of the Superboy legend in the Smallville TV series. I've read the Superman and Superboy comics growing up, which were mostly kind of corny. Smallville has taken the development of young Kal-el and made him contemporary and interesting again.

If a film or TV adaptation of a story originally told in graphic novel or comic book format stays true to the spirit and intent of the character, and changes are made to improve the dramatic flow in that direction, then those changes should be embraced as a welcome improvement, and not dismissed offhandedly from the dogmatic perspective of it straying from the comic, or being too different.",1223683200,86,2294,4.981723237597911

The series is structured like a cop drama, but there are a lot of sci/fi and fantasy elements to it. The Witchblade is a magic item with enough of a personality to be subtly controlling events and Sara's destiny.

Yancy Butler plays a convincing tough yet sexy female cop, Sara Pezzini. She does a great job acting, and would reccomend this series on the strength of her personality alone.

I also especially like the dynamic between her and Nottingham (Eric Etebari). Nottingham is a secret favorite of mine, even though he's only a minor character. I'm not sure why he appeals to me so much, but he's the mysterious, cool, and somewhat weird (creepy?) lackey of the ""bad guy"" Kennith Irons. It's hard to figure out what his motives are, but sometimes totally the amoral assassin, sometimes he seems to be in hopeless unrequited love with Sara. But that's just my take on him...

Other people have commented on this, but I thought I'd give it a chance since I was slavishly devoted to the TV series.  I didn't realize how much a part of the show the music was until it was gone.

Now I regret buying this product... while the hero(es) are very interesting and well-developed, the focus on violent, vicious, and vile villains lead to a an ambiance of unpleasant darkness that makes cyberpunk to light and airy.

It seems a little late to critique the writers of this series but I tired of the parade of dispicable characters (corrupt cops, megolomaniacs, a demon, a pedophile, mass murderers, super-assassins, and failed super-heroes) and their horrific acts.  It does, however match the trend of trying to represent super heroes as life would really be for them.  The problem is that the fantasy of superheroes succeeded because it was not real life.  (Of course, as a long-time fan of DC comics, before it got dark, this is clearly a personal preference.)

Also included are quick snippets from thoughts of the character Gabriel, 2 short features on the making of Witchblade (20 mins all together) and the casting sessions of the cast. The show as a whole was very good. If your expecting the costume from the comic series to make an appearance, you'll be disappointed. Only a gauntlet appears taking on 3-4 different shapes - bracelet, sword, full gauntlet and a gauntlet that resembles a brass knuckle type weapon.

3166214,4,B00170LCWC,"I never read the comic books/graphic novels that this series was based upon. That didn't deter me from watching the series back in 2000, nor buying it now.

The series' special effects stand up to the special effects being produced for tv and movies being made today with only one exception. The scenes where Sara walks through fire are obviously computer generated and that shows on the screen. That could have been redone to better effect with the release of the dvd.

The series fascinated me because it was one of the first shows to come out where the hero was a woman. I like that Sara typified everything good and bad about our gender.  She was tough with a kind heart, she was capable of great love and a fierce sense of justice.  What was right and wrong was so ingrained in Sara that you knew she was always going to do the right thing, even if she had to do it outside of what is considered correct in society.

I do have one gripe about the series. I think the mythology of the Witchblade and the bloodlines could have been better explained. I think Sara should have become custodian of the archives instead of them being passed to Ian.  It was a complex series and I have no doubt it would have been explored more had the series returned for a third and fourth season.  It clearly screams for a revival. Who knows, maybe Sci-Fi can find space for the reruns and see if there is still and audience for a new series.

*Excellent amount of action and special effects.
*Excellent filming style.  It's very vivid and has a lot of unique imagery.  Very different than any other show I know of.
*Good stories.
*Good characters; good acting.

The Bad Things
*Soundtrack was changed from the original broadcasted version.  I don't mind so much, since I've never seen it on TV before.  But knowledgable fans may be dissapointed.
*Some special effects look a bit fake (then again, this show is getting old).

The Questionable Things
*Some parts (largely in the pilot episode/movie) have an extremely hyper strobing effect.  Can be seen as either stylish or irritating.

This is a very different, unique, and vivid comic-book inspired TV show.  So much so, that it surpasses most others and can be considered one of the best.  There is hardly anything unlikable or dull about it; its simply great.  Highly reccomended to everybody.

The DVD has excellent image and sound quality.  It is in widescreen.  It contains a few featurettes and commentaries on selected episodes.

Also be sure to check out the anime version.  It's pretty darn awesome too!

3166221,5,B00170LCWC,"Well I am going to stick my neck out and say I think the above is quite possibly a real gem - I have just finished watching it on DVD and was really impressed with the story and character development, and was also surprised with the picture quality too! The DVD Box-Set has all 2 seasons compiled in one set.

PQ (Picture Quality)
The DVD is presented in matted widescreen conversion form its original 4:3 format - surprisingly many of the scenes are of very good quality and it appears to have been well done in most cases. The panoramic scene setting views seem to have suffered, the quality was poorer with some pixilation, artefacts, and similar, and the occasional close up shots of statues and buildings looked to have been stretched to 16:9 so looked distorted. However all shots of actual cast and action scenes and so on were clear and almost always very good quality. I played the discs on my New Zealand purchased PS3 (despite them officially being coded R1 - so they are Region Free) and used the PS3's upsampling to 1080p for my Samsung 50"" HD Plasma DP getting a very tidy image, especially close ups of people & faces, etc. For a remastered 2001 TV series I was pleasantly surprised with the Picture Quality result, and with the quality of the actual writing/material/acting it was well worth the few imperfections. Displaying SD material up onto a full HD display normally highlights issues in the quality of the SD material and this set came through very well..

SQ (Sound Quality)
Although sound quality was not super-fantastic, it was still very good and I generally found it very satisfactory and there were sufficient ambience and surround effects in the remastering to immerse you in most scenes - although I think overall this is the weakest area of the DVD production. The Series on the DVD itself has a very good score of music (IMO) from a variety of artists and genres and they set both mood and pace very well and have a unique distinctness similar in ways to the early Buffy episodes & Firefly for example.... However other fans of the original TV broadcast version of the show have noted a change to the musical score.

CONTENT
I originally only saw 2-3 odd random episodes of Witchblade when it screened here in New Zealand many years ago and found it disjointed and difficult to follow - but now I have seen the full content of both seasons in sequence I understand, especially with the major event at the end of Season 1 - it really has a very rich and complex story with a couple of distinct twists or unexpected events that as a result make it important to view the episodes in sequence and missing a few breaks the continuity. I had always been a bit ambivalent to this series because of the above experience with the original broadcast but having taken the punt to order a copy of the box set from Amazon I have certainly not regretted it and would rate this one of the most enjoyable sci-fi/occult/fantasy type TV shows produced to date that I have viewed. The DVD set has all 24 episodes (including the 90 minute premiere) providing almost 19 hours of the show plus some special features. The special effects in many cases are fantastic quality for a TV Series that screened in 2001 (& 2002) and compare very favourably, if not better, to much of the similar effects used in The Matrix (released in 2000), as another reviewer has noted. My only less than 100% positive comments would be regarding the erratic character of Ian Nottingham, which seems disjointed and as other reviewers here have said seems to suffer from a mix of bad acting and/or inconsistent writing; a similar (but much lesser) issue with Jake McCartey in the later part of the second season; and a minor issue with the last 2-3 episodes of the second season, which while they are still a high quality in general there is a subtle but noticeable change in the scripting, which just takes a bit of the Oomph out of the pace of the show - up until those episodes both seasons move reasonably fast and are intense, full of action, building intrigue & suspense, and more - the last 2-3 episodes just seem a bit slower, and a bit slower and more self-contained than the previous 21-22 episodes, so one wonders if there was a change of writers or if perhaps the writer(s) knew the show wasn't to be renewed and lost focus (although there is clearly no attempt to 'close off' the story or have a dramatic finale - so it is just left hanging with a bit of a non-descript ending).

Overall I also enjoyed the little subtleties too, like the pop-culturish jokes (e.g. one about subjecting people to reruns of South Park made in the context of someone being crazy/insane), and other references to the world as it was in 2001-2002, and as others have mentioned the quality of the acting is surprisingly good overall...

Overall this is an excellent high quality series from a content perspective, and the production of the DVD set appears to be very good overall too (barring the comments above). A must have if you are a fan of this series or a fan of these type of shows - if you liked Heroes (at least Season 1 anyway) you will probably like this, as much of the time in both seasons it has that same fast paced 'save the world' feel present in Heroes S1, with also a very strong conspiracy 'alone against the world' desperation in season 1.

P.S. It has been commented that some of the music is changed from the original - as I did not see the full broadcast of the show on TV originally I cannot comment on that. Personally I found the musical score generally very good.",1218931200,3,5571,4.543824701195219
3166222,5,B00170LCWC,"I watched this show a bit during college when it was on TNT and really enjoyed it. I just finished watching the complete series and I'm still impressed. It completely sucked me in emotionally to the point where some episodes were almost unbearably tense to watch because I was afraid of the outcome. You never feel ""safe"" watching this show because odd plot twists and turns constantly crop up, defying predictions, and I knew my favorite characters could be killed (or be reborn) at any moment.

The problem is that they changed the soundtrack for each episode.  I'm not sure what the motivation for doing this was, but it really sucks.  Scenes that I remember as fast-paced and exciting such as Nottingham chasing Mobius to the sound of The Crystal Method have now become dull and sluggish.  You don't realize what an impact the music has until it changes.  Some of the new music sounds like someone dubbed a $10 Walmart electric keyboard's electronic beat into the show.  No more Sarah McLachlan, Gerrard McMahon, or Soul Coughing.  Every good song from the series was replaced with something that feels totally alien and inappropriate to the action on the screen.

Take that into consideration before buying this DVD set.

I did notice several other music choices had changed - I've really only watched my favorite episode, Thanatopsis, so far - and the music that was playing when Gabriel entered Sly's home is definitely different.  Still, I'm happy overall with the set, though the dialogue doesn't seem to be mixed very well (hard to hear, and I know it wasn't on the VHS copies I have from the show's original run on TNT).

3166228,3,B00170LCWC,"I recently received my DVD package of the complete series, and I eagerly started watching it.  By the time I got to episode three, my fears were confirmed:  a lot of the original music evidently wasn't licensed for the DVDs when they aired the show (even though this show came on during the age of selling packaged seasons on video).  I had suspected it, but I knew for sure when the cool oldies in Gabriel's place and ""Kitten Moon"" by Fluke which had played in the bar were replaced by generic techno.

I'm not a comic book reader, so I came into the show cold.  A lot of my enjoyment came from the outstanding music, especially in season one.  I found a lot of great bands and rediscovered a lot of great oldies via this show, and to have them replaced by generic stuff was hugely disappointing.

If you aren't in it for the music, then you will enjoy this DVD presentation because it is crisp, clean, and in letterbox format.  However, if you are looking for all that amazing music, buyer beware.",1217721600,3,999,4.420765027322404

Enough has been said about the stories and their lasting appeal and the actors in the show.  Yancy Butler made the character her own and it is a shame she could not make a third season...

The thing I DID notice is some of the music was not the same as the original.  This was most noticeable in the episode, Diplopia, where the Gabriel Bowman character was introduced to Three Dog Night's Road to Shambala to show Bowman's retro music taste.  This was not what was playing on the DVD version compared to the taped episode I have when it aired.  This does not take away from the story, but is a point where the aired show might not match the DVD version.",1217462400,,818,4.2727272727272725

4 episodes per disk, with exception of two (one had 3 episodes, last disk has 2 episodes).  Small but nice pamphlet comes with the set, stating episode names for each disk.

Main problem with the disks is that the music that was originally created for the series is the only music that comes with the DVD's.  Copyrighted music that originally aired on TNT is not included (i.e. Crystal Method's ""Trip Like I Do"" is not included at the beginning of the first episode of the first season, as it originally aired on TNT.)

The back of the DVD box says ""Features an All-New Soundtrack Selected by the Executive Producer"".  Translation:  They didn't pay for some of the music rights.

While I was aware that it was based on a comic book, I had not read the comic before watching the show.  So my experience was more that the comic was not taking after the show enough (when I finally read the comic to try and get my Witchblade fix when the show was cancelled).
I thought Yancy Butler was great as the lead - broody and trying to figure out what is this strange thing that has come into her life.  But I did feel that she never quite grew beyond that.  It felt like she was always one step behind Kenneth Irons (the ""bad-guy"" played wonderfuly by Anthony Cistaro (anyone else remember him trying to steal Woody Harrelson's girfriend in Cheers?).

It's only been off the air for 6 years, but it feels like 60! The Witchblade was one of the best shows on TV ever! Luckily I taped every episode and have watched the reruns for years on tape. Season one was especially fantastic.  Special note to Episode 7 (Lagrimas) in Season 2, guest starring Burn Notice's own Jeffery Donovan - not to be missed! What ended up being the final episode of the show is a stunning commentary on owning the power of the feminine in oneself, and how that ownership is graceful, fearless and beautiful.  I MISS THIS SHOW!

To the writers, producers and executives at TNT - find away to bring this great show back!

3166236,5,B00170LCWC,"I'm so excited that Warner Bros. decided to release the DVD set as the complete series (movie, Season 1, Season 2).  Ralph Hemecker did a fantastic job creating a show that complemented the comic series, without imitating it. Frankly, if they had tried to go with the comic's look, the rating would be too high for tv. It would have resembled soft porn, so I'm glad they went with the ""beautiful, but tough"" portrayal instead.

Yancy Butler's portrayal of Sara Pezzinni as a cop struggling to learn the effects of the Witchblade on her life and career was amazing.  I also found Anthony Cistaro's enigmatic Kenneth Irons more interesting than the comic, where the character as more overtly power hungry.  Will Yun Lee and David Chokachi were perfect as Sara's fellow detectives.  The introduction of Gabriel (John Hensley) in season 1 set the stage for great interactions between the talented cast. Terrific guest stars like Peter Mensah (300), Kim DeLury (Farscape Peacekeeper) and Roger Daultry added to the mix.

This was TNT's first television series success and they didn't seem to know how to handle it. For season two, I got the impression the execs became more involved and felt they had to change things up in order to justify their salaries.  Ralph's consistent vision, which pulled viewers into the movie and first season was derailed with many stand alone episodes and the ""death"" of a major character, who was one of the show's strongest actors.  The episodes were ok, but not as compelling as earlier developments and I believe most fans were excited for a third season, with Ralph back in control.  Unfortunately, that never happened.

Still, the series is still the best of it's kind that I've seen.  I hope that we get lots of DVD extras, like cast and crew episode commentaries, the TNT web videos, design, and new cast interviews.  After 5-6 years of waiting, fans deserve a plethora of bonuses!",1212278400,12,1914,4.855384615384615

I broke down and bought pirated copies off ebay and watched them again and again wishing for a studio produced DVD so I wouldn't have to suffer the static filled picture, the TNT logo or the snippets of commercials.  Oh, that we had DVR back when and a DVD recorder, I wouldn't have had such an impatient wait.  Needless to say, when I received the Amazon email I excitedly pre-ordered my copy within 30 seconds of reading it.  I think I can sell my copied dvds now if anyone would buy such bad copies now that the pristine DVDs will be out.  I read a Witchblade book thinking it would be like the series and was sorely dissapointed.  I enjoy the tv created characters so much better that the original comic book series.  I'm glad I wasn't into the series prior to the television Witchblade.

3166243,5,B00170LCWC,"Not only was it one of the most complex series in the history of cable television, Witchblade was easily one of the most underrated. Witchblade debuted in a full-length television pilot on TNT and then after its initial success became a full-fledged series in 2001. In many ways the show was ahead of its time. It managed to be both science-fiction (when the genre was suffering from unoriginal sequels and poorly made remakes), fantasy (before the genre was validated by&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lord-of-the-Rings/dp/B000654ZK0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lord of the Rings</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pan-s-Labyrinth/dp/B00005JPA6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pan's Labyrinth</a>) and added a healthy dose of cop drama. The intricate plotlines featured such esoteric subject matter as psychic visions, cloning, abnormal psychology, time travel, reincarnation, demonic possession, mythological motifs, multiple conspiracies, occult philosophical ideologies, and also benefited from clever pop-culture in-jokes.
The series was brought to life by strong acting from a diverse, if not at times dysfunctional cast. Witchblade also featured a greatly varying soundtrack (this DVD does not include all of the artists I've named here; see my comment for further explanation) that included everyone from The Crystal Method to Peter Gabriel, from Rob Zombie to Enya, from Three Dog Night to U2. The series burst off the small screen with great visual flare, the special effects were almost on a par with the first&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Matrix/dp/B00000K19E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Matrix</a>&nbsp;film, and the camerawork was equally impressive.
There have been some fans of the comics who have complained about the many differences between the show and the comics. But as I was at the time unfamiliar with the comics, I enjoyed the show from a fresh, purely objective perspective. I also think that most fans of the source material understood that this was not an adaptation in the strictest sense but more of a loosely inspired series that dealt with some of the same themes.
And now fans of this cult classic can enjoy their favorite comic book-inspired heroine on DVD... at last.

The characters include:
Sara Pezzini- A New York homicide cop and the ""Blade-wielder""
Danny Woo- Sara's partner and close friend.
Jake McCartey- Sara's rookie partner in training.

Kenneth Irons- A billionaire who may be more than he seems.
Ian Nottingham- A mysterious bodyguard/assassin in Iron's employ.

White Bulls- A secretive fraternity of corrupt vigilante cops.

I hope you will check out one of the coolest shows in recent years. ""Rock on dot com!""",1208822400,355,6542,5.410433070866142
3166244,5,B00170LCWC,"I saw this series when it first came out on t.v. The witchblade is an ancient weapon that can be wielded only by a woman, one particular woman infact. When she dies the witchblade waits for her to be reincarnated. The witchblade was created for the purpose of bringing justice to those who need it and punishment to the bad guy. This series was done very well and Yancy Butler did a superb job as the Heroine. Non stop action and some very cool sword fighting. On the down side toward the end of this series it starts getting really weird and even blasphemes, just FYI.",1208563200,14,569,4.377358490566038
3166245,3,B00170LCWC,"If you are a diehard Witchblade fan, you're going to buy and enjoy this tv series regardless of what any review says.  What I offer here is a review for the ""discerning"" viewer.  It is possible to be a fan of an intellectual property (such as a comic book) and yet maintain a clear, honest judgment about different aspects of the property's use in different media, something that fanboys and fangirls do not understand.  The bottom line is that as a cop drama, the Witchblade tv series is top notch.  It's one of the best cop dramas ever to grace the small screen.  However, as a faithful adaptation of the Witchblade comic book, it is a complete and utter failure.  By the time they were three or four episodes into the first season, the tv show had severed all ties with the comic book and had become its own independent entity.  The only thing the comic book and the show have in common is that they are both called ""Witchblade,"" and some of the character's names are the same.  The argument that one can't directly reproduce the comic book on the tv screen is a cop-out (no pun intended), because the tv show doesn't even try to represent the comic.  On the contrary, once the first two episodes were concluded (known as Witchblade: The Movie), the tv series immediately set about to distance itself as much as it could from the comic.  I could go into detail about this, but I don't wish to do a disservice to viewers who have never seen the show before by spoiling plot elements.  Suffice it to say that what you are getting here is not a television adaptation of the comic book, but a different creation entirely.

That said, I really have to give props to Yancy Butler, the actress who plays Sara Pezzini in this series.  Before I saw her in this tv series, I thought she was just another Hollywood bimbo willing to bare her chest in any B movie she could land a job on.  Oh was I wrong.  Yancy is a very talented actress, and she is the best (and only, in my opinion) reason to buy and watch this series.  Correction: Yancy and John Hensley.  John Hensley plays the part of Gabriel, a dealer in very unique and rare items.  He assists Sara frequently in her investigations because he knows a lot about wierd, arcane stuff.  He plays the part with a confidence and coolness combined with a youthful hipness that makes him very likeable.  My favorite parts of the show are the times when Sara and Gabriel are working together.

It is a bit odd that a show which features such talented actors as Butler and Hensley would also employ the horrid acting abilities of Eric Etebari, the actor who plays Ian Nottingham.  Mr. Etebari is one of the worst actors I've ever seen, but I can't lay the blame completely at his feet.  His character, Nottingham, was not well conceived by the show's writers and producers.  He is nothing like the Nottingham of the comic, but neither is he a well-defined character in his own right in the world of the show.  All throughout the series, the writers seem to be struggling with exactly who they want Nottingham to be, and the result is that Etebari seems unsure of how to play him.  Some of his lines and scenes are so bad as to reach comical levels of absurdity.  Fortunately, Nottingham isn't nearly as present in the second season as he was in the first.

If you're asking the question, ""How much Witchblade action can I see?"", the answer is very little.  Truth be told, this series isn't really about the Witchblade.  It's about Sara, her life as a cop, and the decisions she faces about doing the right thing.  The Blade itself takes a backseat role, usually only appearing once per episode and only very briefly.  Sara usually uses it to block bullets Wonder Woman-style.  It also occasionally grants Sara a ""sixth sense"" at crime scenes which allows her to see through the eyes of the victim or to witness crimes as they are happening elsewhere.  Think the tv show Medium, only the actress has a funky silver bracelet on her wrist.

So that's my Witchblade tv series review for the ""discerning"" viewer.  I hope it helps you to decide whether to purchase it or not.",1208476800,198,4109,4.497975708502024

The best TV Sci-Fi I think ever!

I've now gotten the ""official"" DVD set and think that my previous remarks were on target for season one and too kind for season two.  Season one had a nice arc that did, indeed, come satisfyingly full circle.  Season two was abominable.  The first episode of season two makes zero sense given the concluding scene of the season one finale.  Then season two just goes down hill from there.

The TV series immediately skyrocket to the top rating series by its time (and still is the highest rating series to be cancelled) and it was cut unexpectedly, without a good reason instead of just pausing production until next season. It's really sad, specially given the way the series finale ended.

Now, about the DVD box itself, it`s totally worth buying! The box looks amazing and the extras have a lot of lore on the Witchblade franchise.",1478822400,4,606,5.0
3400415,5,B00170LCWC,I enjoyed it. I did see the series when it was on tv so it's no surprise  that I liked it.,1476057600,,90,3.2857142857142856
3400416,2,B00170LCWC,"I absolutely love this series (Witchblade).  This is live-action, not to be confused with the anime.  It started as a television movie that proved so popular in ratings and reviews that they created a series out of it.

The TV film aired in August of 2000.  It's pretty good.

The first season aired during the summer of 2001, ending 21 days before 9/11 which was eerie considering this series takes place in New York City and is about strange coincidences and deja vu with the number 11 relating to all significant events.  ""Parallel lines always meet"".  We follow a new york city cop that loses friends of hers and talks to the dead, wishing she could turn back time and stop them from dying.

Season two aired the following summer and (like season one) got stellar cable ratings.  The lead actress had drug/alcohol problems and production stopped in the middle of the season so she could go to rehab.  Production then continued to its end (they even compressed what was to be the final two episodes and combined them into one just to finish it quickly).  Despite the great ratings, TNT decided to cancel the series.  It was a very surprising announcement (though probably not to the cast and crew).  It was obvious it was because they no longer trusted the lead actress to work and that was it for Witchblade.  It's extremely unfortunate, but I am so thankful to have these two seasons.  It's really all that's needed to fall in love and be enamored with it for the rest of my life.  I'm deeply in love with this series.

The problem with this DVD set is that the iconic and essential music throughout the series is replaced (the TV film is the only one that retains all the music and is complete).  While an executive producer graciously picked some new music (some actually pretty damn good) its no substitute for what was and should be.

Now the replacing of music is understandable (yet still unforgivable) due to the BS copyright mania, but what isn't excusable is the edited Season 2 premiere on the set.  They used what would have been syndicated cuts for the first two Season 2 episodes  which originally comprised the season 2 premiere (which originally aired as one 90 minute episode and later aired as a TV film called 'Witchblade 2').  This big premiere episode was the pinnacle of excitement for this series.  I remember watching this when it premiered on Father's Day 2002.  (The episode actually dealt with an estranged father and his daughter, and had Yancy Butler's real-life estranged father communicating with her about missing his daughter.  Great synchronicity and parallels.  Just another layer of that spooky feeling to add to this.)  The life-affirming wonder in this premiere is what this series was all about.  It was the best of Witchblade.  Which is why it hurts that its edited down in this DVD set.

I couldn't allow this to be the only existing way Witchblade is to be viewed.  I took the DVDrips from the internet and (with the help of some TVrips) took the original audio and edited the original music (original sound) back into the series.  So I've uploaded the only real way to watch Witchblade (widescreen with original soundtrack) and even included the uncut Season 2 premiere that is not on the DVD.  So its out there if you look.  I can't say where because its not allowed here.  I'm already saying too much.

I have absolutely no desire to ever watch this DVD set (which I own).  It's not the true series.  You're going to have to download it through alternate means to see the real thing.  And you absolutely should.

The series itself gets more than 5/5 stars.  But the DVD set I can't give much to.  I'm only thankful it exists so that I could have the impeccable video to use for the proper edit.  The missing uncut season 2 premiere hurts it a lot.

(The 'Cry Little Sister' remix from the end of Season One just started playing from a random list of 5000 songs on my ipod.  You won't find that awesome moment in the DVD set.)",1475280000,11,3974,4.598290598290598

That said, the anime departs from the original story line -- although it does so with excellent effect, and ends up being one of the very best animes ever made.  Also, the tech level (ie, special effects) of this series is far below what the Witchblade story really needs -- the blade wearer here does not transform the way she does in the comics or the anime.

3400512,1,B00170LCWC,"You should read the 5-star ratings if you want a good review.

I found the acting better than the stories, especially the second season which seemed to lose threads started in season 1.  The efforts by the actors elevated the stories to interesting and I was, at first, absorbed and interested.  There were some distorted views of Christianity that I did not care for.  But, after all, that was sort of the premise of the Witchblade itself.  Saying any more would be a spoiler.  I'll recommend to shoppers and viewers - don't watch it if your beliefs are easily offended.  The lack of morality by the main character wielding what, I would have thought, was something Holy was a major disconnect.  I kept hoping through season 1 and started season 2.  Then I quit.

I don't buy entertainment to watch people in bed and I can't say how much of those scenes were in the last episodes, I stopped watching before the last episode.  I collect DVDs but I occasionally run into one I don't want to watch again and might regret what I did watch.

Now to bias things just a tad, Yance Butler is smokin' hot it the lead role. The comic book, yes, has Sara proportioned like a barbie doll and built like a 80's stripper.

The story and action sequences are distinguished from most other shows by a graphic novel sensibility, which adds another dimension to the storytelling, and makes the series more intriguing. The story is clever and draws the viewer in, but just when you feel that the show might start getting too smart for its own good, it returns to its basic premise of good woman cop (with special powers) vs baddies (with or without special powers). But, just when you think it might start getting stuck in a ho-hum girl v baddies thing, there is another twist in the narrative to grab your attention again.

3400552,4,B00170LCWC,"I personally loved this series, but that said, I had a few issues with it.

As others have mentioned, the whole cop thing was just a fad almost and it was due to writing and costume designed poorly (in places). Sorry, cops don't dress that way. it was so obvious that this type of thing did bother and distract me a lot. The effects were good, not great but not bad. No real procedure following, so many bodies left laying around, ect. Again it leaves you wondering what happened. Yes the witchblade is more of a bullet dodger in the show. After reading the comic this can bother some, yet to the new viewer it probably won't. This was done because the effects caused TNT (TV channel)too go much over budget.

After I saw this, I compared it with the comic. Yes the show is more about Sara, but it had to be so the viewer could 'care' about her. I loved her tough act, but her clothes were inappropriate to the role. (stomach out? And she is beautiful, throaty). Yancy is not the soft classic beauty, but she is still beautiful and I found I liked her more than the waif thin long haired bright eyed 18 year old actresses they could have done. No, Yancy nailed it and was the right girl. I didn't care that Sara was this long haired comic beauty. Sara was a woman and Yancy was all woman and not a teenager. YES!

Some scenes are amazing: Like how the witchblade attaches, how Sara is tested by it in bed, how Sara fell in love.

The series was canceled because of budget and the actress struggle with drinking. I was sad. Anyway, down to the grit. The redo in season 2 was eh at best, but the time line changes pretty fast so you are not bored, and then comes in Irons. Someone had the right eye for casting this guy. I loved it right away. it did feel cheap, but it made a pretty good story once things got moving and they did move right away. I loved Irons, and I did love Nottingham. I wish Sara would have been closer with him. I can only imagine if they made the darkness series and that would be great.

As far as Nottingham, there was more of a one sided affection and a too drawn out thing with Nottingham with his glove. It was great and symbolic but it never got far. I loved it, but it took too long. The blood issue that kept people young was weird and kind of gross so I'll keep that under wraps for spoiler reasons. This was one of those things that didn't work for me. The story itself was awesome for season one. I loved her and Concubar. I think this was well done. even the fact he rode a bike added to why she would like him. Her romance never bothered me...it felt right in that it was awkward for her. She's a tomboy who is very stubborn.

More witchblade story itself would have been great, but we got so much lore in season one I felt satisfied. The whole jealousy thing between one character and the other was also drawn out. IDK, for all it lacked and the sometime feeling of being strung along. I think its worth a watch. There will always be a few things that will be mediocre from the actual fact, it just depends how much they stick out and personally bug you. I am not so drawn to detail it bothered me. I was able to engross myself with the characters enough. It does lack direction at times, but doesn't all series? It's more about a woman with power and the choices she makes despite all the obstacles of the power hungry people around her.

Could it have been better? Heck ya, was it worth 20 bucks, sure. It was the way it was written, and delivered more than anything else. Just remember its an older series and not as 'up to date' as new shows as far as procedures. Now they wear gloves and That satisfies me and makes it seem a bit more real. You will not get that from this series.

I loved Nottingham, the twist they added to his character, and his line ""I love you...in unguarded moments."" I just wish they made him a bit more emotionally mature. He was too kiddish with his affection-which was understandable, he was raised for a reason and his feeling is completely new to him. it just didn't come across as well as it could have. And it took too long. There was supposed to be a love hate thing, and while it was kind of there, I felt it missed the spirit of it all.",1365897600,,4211,4.202970297029703

The first season was interesting. It didn't have the ""superhero"" feel that I was expecting. It had the feel of a ""regular"" cop show with the occasional supernatural element. Once I got past that I began to enjoy it; the writers were taking their time and they seemed to have a plan for where they wanted the characters to go. There was some serious character development. All in all, I'd call season one a success. Now, let's talk about season two. In season two, the writers systematically UNDID EVERYTHING in that was accomplished in season one. Season two brought Danny Woo back to life with no explanation, killed Kenneth Irons, and suddenly, the White Bulls never existed? A different....timeline? Are you kidding me?

Honestly season 1 is pretty good and that is because it is a new thing that you are just learning about.

It is the 2nd season that messes things up
It is boring disjointed and nonsensical  and that's saying something good about

The story was real weak and the main focus of the story was not the Withblade, but Yancy's character, Police Detective Sara Pezzini and that took away from the whole mystique of the Witchblade legend.

As I said before, Yancy Butler is a beautiful actress, but this show left her character seeming more butch than femme and that turned my interest away from the show. Maybe it's the fanboy in me, but you should skip this show and stick with the comic for all the greatness that is the Witchblade mythos.",1356739200,,648,4.4

I found the lead actresses vocals to be grating and her eyebrows looked like two wooly caterpillars fighting.  Both were very distracting.  The lead villian was less than sinister and cartoon like.  The only standout character was Ian Nottingham.  There were far to many music video montages where she would ride her motocycle or they played medieval stock footage.

With all the fast cuts & unnecessary strobe flashing, I think it helped to accentuate the violence, & like most people (at the time it aired) I was probably just desensitized to the violence.

3400598,5,B00170LCWC,"It is rare to find a show that kept me on the edge of my seat as this series did. Witchblade's Yancy Butler encompasses the essence of her character. I'm not familiar with the comic it spans off from but as a show it was a gem. The chemistry in the cast was electrifying and the stories didn't disappoint, at least not for me. Sara Pezzini is a cop who encounters a gauntlet that can only be worn by women who are chosen by it. These women are tied together in some way from Joan of Arc to others. Sara fights evil using this gauntlet (which turns into a bracelet) giving her extraordinary abilities. Kenneth Irons is her arch enemy trying to poses the wichblade and its bearer.
During the early part of the millennium this show was rated #1 in TNT's lineup (a cable channel in the US) but it is believed that the show was cancelled because of reports of Yancy Butler's battle with alcoholism resulting in checking herself into a rehab facility for 30 days in the middle of shooting the series.

Though there are a hand full of episodes that were well developed and thought provoking  with good twists, the series was mostly very predictable and repetitious.  It had great potential but unlike a comic book series where each episode is short and the artwork is a big focus, a one hour show has to deliver more detail and more character complexity to be successful.  Comics can rely on great artwork and viewer imagination to fill in the blanks - a TV show doesn't have that luxury.  Easy to see why it only ran one season.

3400615,4,B00170LCWC,"Years ago when TNT was sort of foraying into Original Series, they attempted to adapt a comic book written by Top Cow, what emerged was a show that wouldn't have lasted more than a few episode on a major television network but settled in quite comfortably in the basic cable network round up. The first season was one of the better cable shows out there, while fans of the original comic (who prefer more faithful adaptations) won't be fond of it. Those who don't mind some leeway in their adaptations would definitely enjoy it. Three dimensional characters with real flaws and just enough about them to make us admire or hate them but also SEE them as real people. The second season however, tried some theme and plot and character changes that was detrimental to the show and combined with behind the scenes problems with the lead actress and semi decreased viewership the show was canceled sadly after season two.

The first season sets up the series as Sara Pezzini (Yancy Butler), a cop who stumbles upon an ancient artifact that finds it's way onto her wrist known as the 'Witchblade', a magical artifact, that can be worn only by women (a major plot point) and only by women of a certain chosen bloodline. Blessing her with visions, increased stamina and healing and fighting skills, the Witchblade has a lot of appeal and one can see why someone wants to possess it, however  the price one can pay for it is not shied away from in the series either. As Sara goes through some personal tragedy, namely the loss of the only partner the maverick cop was attached to, Danny Woo (Will Yun Lee). We see her grow as a character as she's stalked by Ian Nottingham (Eric Etebari), a flunky of Kenneth Irons (Anthony Cistaro) a man with seeming immortality whose obsession with possessing the Witchblade is palpable to the viewer as well, the first season tried an overreaching plot arc that was slowly but masterfully revealed as the season went on. Witchblade was quite capable of maintaining several subplots over a long period of time without detracting from one to feed the other, we see Sara's new partner Jake McCarty (David Chokachi) stalk down the strange society known as the ""White Bulls"" and we get introduced to Gabriel Bowman (John Hensley), a young man whose strange knowledge of supernatural artifacts is a badge for his own mysterious past and connection to Sara. Special effects were far from amazing, but in some ways were better than ones presented on other science fiction shows. The actors were all well suited to their roles and went at them without hackneyed relish. Butler portrayed Pezzinni as likeable, tough, sensitive and realistic. Whereas other actresses could have gone the route of too tough unlikable bimbo, Butler made Sara a very real person we could all relate to. Yun Lee gets reduced to a corny""mystical asian"" stereotype in a lot of ways as a Ghost who sticks around to help his partner but, Yun Lee plays Danny Woo as very likeable who does what he can for the character of Sara. Cistaro can be corny as Irons in certain points but he's still a villain one loves to hate and Nottingham's growth over the first season makes it memorable. Chokachi's turn as Jake is also masterful as the still semi fresh from Baywatch actor proved he *could* carry a character in a more series show. The first season ended on a high note with promise of the second.

The second season is where the show lost some of its heart as the production was plagued with personal issues from the main actress and the show's theme and execution was changed for the worse. The show abandoned the masterfully single plot arc encompassing an entire season with smaller sub plot episodes that ultimately connect to a whole to make it ""easier"" to follow and kept it regaled to baddie of the week type situations or in this case ""Pretend Wielder of the Witchblade"" of the week. What resulted was a show that didn't have the patience and time to really show off the actor's skill or the writers skill, but all the flaws of the series brought forward. Filled with weak episodes and ridiculous character development, the time shift at the end of Season One left us retreading some of the same ground as season one and this time definitely not for the better. Danny Woo is forced to take the angry Mary Jane ala Spiderman role of character who knows *something* is going on, but not what and ends up being shown as petulant when the person they care about is running around *obviously* hiding secrets from them. Jake is barely shown this season and Nottingham, one of season ones most admirable characters ""evolves"" from the first season to silent, but likable side character into angsty pseudo corny philosophy spouting person whom this viewer wanted Sara to dump off the end of a high cliff. Even the brilliant Irons is diminished as a character. The show went down a worse off path that could have potentially been saved had it not been prematurely cancelled.

Well done over all, with a few flaws here and there one wishes the show could have gone on longer then it actually did. Technically the show was very well filmed and acted and while certainly not a scifi classic it's one of the best feminist themed science fiction series out there. Definitely recommended.",1296604800,3,5270,4.70021645021645

3400617,2,B00170LCWC,"THE GOOD:
The soundtrack is incredible. Really, really good music.

There is plenty of eye candy. It's the Baywatch of the fantasy genre: all beauty and little depth. Eric Etebari is stunning to look at. Yancy Butler's physicality overwhelms her skilled acting. The beauty of the actors is the sole reason for both stars in my rating.

THE BAD:
Very poor quality writing in this show. It's repetitive, especially the use of the word ""Witchblade."" It would be easy to turn it into a drinking game. The story arcs are flat, predictable, and straight out of the box. Ubiquitous chase scenes, anyone? If that isn't bad enough, at the end of the first season, the show uses a cheap plot device to negate everything. The following season recycles almost all the plot points from the first. It's so lazy and even hostile to the audience.

I had little patience for the villain dialogue. Maybe I should say villain monologues. The bad guys seemed to be on their own wavelength most of the time. The non sequitur gibberish these characters spewed was jarring. The occasional riddle coming out of a character's mouth adds some interest. But, these guys never say what they mean, ever. How did they manage to amass their evil empire with such minuscule communication skills?

I suspect the writers were aiming for profound and mysterious. They landed on dumb instead.

THE UGLY:
It is unintentionally funny, too. The scenes where Ian Nottingham has long conversations with inanimate objects (paintings, his father's preserved hand) are just beyond endurance. I don't know what the writers were going for there. Maybe they needed to be told that ""talk to the hand"" is a figure of speech. I cringed for the actor.",1295568000,4,1700,4.848275862068966
3400618,4,B00170LCWC,"Back in 2000, when the series began, my wife and I became devoted fans. We looked for it on DVD but never found it. Well we finally gave up and stopped looking. Now I find it on Amazon 10 years later only to find out it was released in 2008!

I think this was one of the best series of its genre produced - even by todays standards. Yancy Butler plays the roll of Pezz quite deftly and the supporting cast is awesome. When we first started watvhing the episodes I had a difficult time - because I was trying to remember the series. I finall gave up and simply started enjoying the episodes as if I were seeing them for the first time. My enjoyability went up immensely.

If you remember, and enjoyed, this series then I highly recommend adding it to your library. The video quality is good but the audio provided is acceptable but sub-par by 2008 standards, I would have preferred a digital remastered 5.1 soundtrack.

3400620,5,B00170LCWC,"I saw a few episodes of this when it originally aired but not all of them.  I picked this up at a post xmas sale for fun and I must say I thoroughly enjoyed watching the series.  So much of the Sci-Fi/Fantasy work produced these days is dominated by computerized effects and images and as a result it doesn't in the end feel real or believable.  Witchblade however relies on filmography, soundtrack, and plot to produce a visually striking, gripping, and entertaining experience.  Usually when I watch sci-fi/fantasy shows that are 10 years old I get distracted by the primitiveness of the special effects and I was expecting that when I started watching this series. Instead I was drawn in and thoroughly enjoyed it. I think it underscores for me that so much of what is being turned out now has a 'plastic' quality in terms of the craftsmanship and presentation.  CGI has given us tremendous new options, but maybe they are getting too caught up in the tool and losing sight of the overall product?

Season one is superior to season 2 in terms of plot and story arc. I've never read the comic so I have no complaints about the 'adaptation'.",1294185600,,1142,4.600985221674877
3400621,3,B00170LCWC,"Firstly, all entertainment reviews are subjective, but here's the impression of Witchblade. I enjoy Sci-Fi and mystery both, so this looked like an excellent storyline, a good combination.
A woman detective comes into possession of an ancient artifact of power and uses it to preserve her life as she fights crime and the forces opposed to her possession of the artifact. So far so good, it could have had the potential to be extremely long running, but then sadly fell from its potential as it failed to focus on character development. Even the little human interaction that did take place when the principle slowly lost many of those nearest and dearest to her as the episodes progressed, and one actually began to be drawn into the elements of the main character dealing with grief, loss, love, hate, and our lesser daily challenges, along comes an episode that neatly rewinds time, effectively eliminating the bonds built up around the human aspect and effectively takes the viewer back to episode 1 as it continues a different themed storyline from ~ episode 10 with the same original group of characters / actors.
That's when it became a bit too far fetched even for my somewhat esoteric tastes.

The recommendation - worth watching if you're a sci-fi buff, or just enjoy magic based shows, but if you want a believable ongoing storyline with developing characters that progress in a way you can easily relate to and identify with, then we'd have to say it's better to spend your money elsewhere.",1290729600,5,1502,4.8671875

3400628,5,B00170LCWC,"If you like the True Blood series by Charlene Harris and the witch books by Kim Harrison, then you will like this series. The main character, Sara, is a reincarnation of Joan of Arc. The witchblade appears on her arm whenever she is in danger. Sara is a homicide detective and ever since she acquired the witchblade, she has been getting some strange cases. There's not a lot of romance as Sara is too busy fighting crime and weird guys to have a boyfriend. It's just pure action throughout the whole show.

 The producers didn't waste a lot of money on props (or clothes for the characters either as Sara wore jeans about the whole first season, but the stories will keep you on the edge of your seat for sure). Another good series similar to this one is Blood Ties. It's also in book form and on dvd.",1269907200,3,802,4.375838926174497
3400629,2,B00170LCWC,"I'm probably gonna get reamed by not-helpfuls from fans of this show, but I felt so misled by the existing reviews that I felt compelled to write one of my own to try and help others like me avoid making the same mistake I did.

For context, I was not familiar with the comic, so came to the show with fresh eyes as someone who is a huge fan of SF and fantasy. (Some of my all time favorite TV shows are Babylon 5, Buffy, and Xena.) The majority of the negative comments here deal with the music being changed for the DVD eps, not being true to the comic, and not making good use of the witchblade, along with issues over the season two redo. But only a small number of the negative comments deal with the things I thought were wrong with the show.

Before I go into why I think the show was a disaster I will say that I very much enjoyed Yancy Butler as Sara and I think it's a shame that the show was not up to her talents because she had what it takes to carry a TV series. Some of the other casting was pretty good too. I especially liked the characters of Gabriel and the medical examiner (can't remember her name) who was funny. Since I didn't see the show on TV I wasn't disappointed by the music on the DVD set and I actually thought that the songs part of the soundtrack was a strongpoint. I looked up info on the web about several of the songs used.

But a strong lead and good music doesn't a successful TV show make. It depends on so many elements that all have to come together in just the right way and this didn't happen with Witchblade. It's a bit difficult for me to put my finger on *exactly* what was wrong in the big picture sense. It seemed to have all the right elements, but the elements were not crafted into a finished, polished piece. A major drawback was just plain crummy writing and poor choices made about story arcs and plot development. The plots never managed to be compelling. And has been mentioned, the time reset for season two didn't come across as anything other than a cheap, tired, overdone gimmick.

One of my major specific complaints about Witchblade is the incredibly awful job they did of making it a cop show. I love the idea of blending cop show with urban fantasy. But wow, you need to at least attempt to make the cop part realistic in order to carry off making the fantasy part believable. I don't mean it needs to be an NYPD Blue, but come on. Episodes had Sara shooting people and leaving the bodies without it ever coming back to haunt her, contaminating crime scenes, and basically ignoring every basic procedure and protocol for a homicide detective. This was all compounded by the medical examiner (as much as I enjoyed the character) doing the same ignoring of all procedures and protocols. Anyone who has ever watched one decent cop/crime/mystery/thriller show could have done a better job.

Another major drawback, and this has been mentioned by others, was the character of Nottingham. Half of the problem can be laid at the actor's feet and the other half at the writers'. Some of the worst, overwrought, attempting-to-be-profound-but-sounding-stupid-instead lines were given to him.

In the end, the lack of compelling story arcs and good writing, along with stupefyingly abysmal cop show elements made me bored (and frequently disgusted) with it all. At the best it was bland television, at the worst it was annoying television. Normally when I'm watching a TV series on DVD I have marathon episode watching sessions. With Witchblade I actually went three weeks before finally watching the final few episodes just to say I had finished the whole thing.",1269820800,22,3616,4.521406727828746

There are some cheesy moments, and the special effects are not top notch, but they're still good.

And the storyline is good.  It's following it's own path, or only loosely following the comic book's storyline path.  But this is a different format, and I think that it works for the 'tv' show it was.

The first season was great, but the second season felt like the beginning of a long series.  There should have been more seasons to wrap up the story.  Season one is one long story with a good and hopeful ending.  It should have stopped after the first season or gone 3 or 4 more seasons to reach a proper finish.

I read somewhere that Yancy Butler had to go to rehab and they cancelled the show.

The characters are fairly good:  All the cops are good, Ken Irons is pretty good, although not as big and strong as the comic, and Ian Nottingham is sometimes laughable in his manorisms and pouting face.  The comic showed him as stoic (i think) and this show makes him childlike mostly.

Lastly, (obviously the budget wasn't there) the Witchblade doesn't really do much cool stuff.  No shooting fire, minimal organic tendrils or morphing.  Mostly it's metal and either sword-gauntlet, armor or both.  It seems its only powers are blocking bullets (which gets really old) and giving Pezzini some psychic powers (plus some time control).

The characters are rich in context and presentation. All the actors are superb. There are some wonderful cameos by guests. The filming is wonderful. Some of the techniques were new in western tv at the time (i.e. wirework).

It was cancelled because ""they"" who decide what we ""want"" to see decided that ""nobody"" wanted to watch a show where you had to keep up with the plot! Not withstanding the many years of soap operas!

Now, with such shows as ""Lost"" and ""Heros"", somebody has finally realized that there is a market for these kind of creative, other-worldly dramas. They noticed that audiences do have the capacity to follow and admire fiction that doesn't get solved and wrapped up each week.

3400665,4,B00170LCWC,"I encountered Witchblade years ago on televion in Europe and somehow I never forgot the impression it made. So many years after I ordered the complete DVD's.
The serie fascinates because of (although the theme is old, the battle between good and evil) the combination of honesty, dedication, time transcending views, deliberate action taken in pursuit of the good and the idea of a 'mythical force' that balances good and evil arising when necessary.
Also Sara is a wonderful actress: the embodiment of feminine power, determination and 'wisdom in action!'",1240617600,,556,5.188888888888889
3400666,4,B00170LCWC,This series is refreshing in the sense that the female heroine is strong and though at times conflicted and confused by her heritage and destiny she adheres to that which is right.

3400667,3,B00170LCWC,"Not familiar with the comic book series, I offer a review that is independent of that influence.

First off, this is the darkest series I have ever seen, and I mean that both literally and figuratively.  The mood is dark, the plots are about multi-generational mystical you-name-it, and even in the practical supposedly everyday world of NYC crime, it falls into the level of weird conspiracies and whom-can-you-trust mode.  But this series is also lit dark, to remind you of some permanent netherworld, I guess, cause there are few daylight scenes and even when people go home at night or work in their office, they seem to be underlit at all times.  Most people walk into a room and turn on a light!  But not these guys.  Like they are all mole-people.  As a viewer, it can be hard on the eyes.

There are cliches abundance, though the bodice-ripping attire of the female lead is spared us.  The lead actress is good, there's no fault with her, but I couldn't imagine wanting to spend any personal time with her character.  For some reason, though, her new partner falls for her, which is part of that cliche world.  The lead who holds the witchblade in this generation is a one-woman crime force that obeys the rules that suit her, ignores those that don't, and did so even before she was supernaturally equipped.  Oh, yeah, we've even got a ghost hanging around to advise her, like she didn't have enough problems already.

The other characters are over-the-top, including a pale blond villain who seems to be an outcast from a James Bond thriller.  And his henchman is an extreme psycho, but generally under control of the master.  The acting isn't too great on this front.  The lead male, the woman's cop partner, has the weird and unbelievable background of having been midwest born and raised but is also a Miami beach legendary surfer turned NYPD cop whom everyone has heard of (he's a legend) even though there's not many people who really follow surfing.  I mean, this whole surfer-turned cop scenario deserved an entire hour of explanation but this background just seems to sit there as if waiting for another series called SURFER COP.

Unfortunately, this series would have been best-served as a miniseries.  The first season has both individual and carryover plot lines that reach a summation, a literal one with everyone dead at the end.  And that would have been fine as is.  Not at all fun, but fine.  Instead the second season is a total revamp - like first season was an entire dream sequence - and in making that revamp they commit career and audience support suicide.  Even the male lead of the series, now due to new circumstance, has to become a supporting character despite his billing.  The plot lines, for those who like the continuing, tend to be self-contained.  Most fans judge the second season to have been a huge mistake, that the first season contained all they were looking for.",1239667200,2,2912,4.718811881188119

As I watched the saga unfold, I realised I had forgotten many minor plot elements, the richness of some of the character details, the pseudo-spiritual underpinnings.

Sad as I was to see the series end prematurely, in retrospect, it ended in a way that really did give us a wonderful resolution, yet showed us that the battle between good and evil (yes, they DO exist) does not end in the defeat of our foes, for as long as greed and a lust for power remain in the world.

Stellar production, intelligent dialogue, sometimes a bit ""comic bookish"", but it's based on a comic to begin with. If you've never seen this show and you like things like Buffy and other 'dark' gothic tinged stuff, this will work for you.",1239062400,,838,4.428571428571429

3400677,4,B00170LCWC,"The most amazing thing about the Witchblade TV series was that there WAS a Witchblade TV series.  The show premiered before the influx of genre shows that we've seen over the past few years and the fact that the character is not exactly a household name made it even more incredible.  As in the Top Cow comic it is based upon (created by Marc Silvestri) it centers on New York Detective Sara Pezzini who comes into possession of the powerful artifact known as the Witchblade and wielded by only women down through the centuries.  The gauntlet literally falls right on her hand in the series pilot film as Sara engages in a shootout with a mob gang member in a museum.

The pilot films throws a lot at the viewer.  Sara's partner, Danny, is murdered by Tommy Gallo, a notorious hit man, but soon after Sara begins to see Danny's ghost.  She is followed by the mysterious Ian Nottingham who works for the wealthy Kenneth Irons.  Irons seems to have intimate knowledge of the Witchblade yet teases Sara with only bits and pieces as you begin to suspect his motives are more sinister.  With Danny's death, Sara is paired with rookie detective Jake McCartey as her new partner.

The show ran for two seasons and a total of 24 episodes (including the pilot) and did reasonably well in the ratings for TNT.  Its cancellation had less to do with ratings and more to the difficulties of star Yancy Butler.  An admitted alcoholic, Butler's problems with the bottle forced production to shut down for several weeks during the second season.  In 2003, she was arrested for disorderly intoxication and ordered into rehab.

Throughout the first season, Sara began to learn more and more about the powers of the Witchblade and her own mysterious lineage while coping with everything from common crooks to demonic priests.  One of the key episodes of the first season is ""Periculum"".  The Witchblade traps Sara on her bed as she is put through a test to see if she is worthy of carrying weapon.  In a dreamlike state, Sara encounters previous blade wielder Joan of Arc as well as Emily Bronte, Sara's earlier incarnation.  This episode is very important as it reveals a great deal about Sara's background, the Witchblade's history, as well as Irons' connection to it.

The strangest episode of season one is ""Transcendence"" in which Sara uses the Blade to reverse time...all the way back to the show's beginning, bringing Danny back to life and forcing Sara to reacquaint herself with Irons, Nottingham, and her friend, Gabriel.  Planned or not, it seemed as if the producers either didn't like, or wanted to change the direction of the show to make it darker and more confrontational and the episode ends up re-booting the entire show going into season two.

The show's cast all played their parts extremely well for the most part, especially Etebari as Nottingham and Cistaro as Irons.  Irons was like a better-mannered and more enigmatic Lex Luthor in terms of being an arch-rival.  He almost made you believe he really was interested in helping Sara early on in the show.  At the risk of sounding sexist, Yancy Butler isn't the most attractive actress around.  I certainly wasn't expecting a Marc Silvestri picture-perfect comic version of the character onscreen but a choice of an actress who exuded a bit more femininity would have been nice.  Butler certainly had the ""tough"" side down cold but it almost made you wince when she had to do romantic scenes (although they are fairly few and far between). Witchblade was generally well-written although it does tend to move very methodically when it comes to revealing the Witchblade and Sara's secrets.

The seven disc set feature an all-new soundtrack chosen by the Executive Producer that includes an assortment of hard, grunge, and alternative rock selections.  Take that for what it is because how many people really remember the original soundtrack from eight years ago?  Witchblade was a complex and ambitious show.  Until shows like ""Lost"" and ""Heroes"" came along, there really were not genre shows that spread so many diverse plotlines.  Who knows where the show might have gone if Butler had not been battling alcoholism.

A solid group of extra including three featurettes and original casting sessions rounds out the set.",1233014400,7,4271,4.857734806629834

I found the prologue and the first season episodes to be the best; nicely scripted, well acted and also connected. The second season episodes were more imaginary and delt with some odd incidents in the plots. Unfortunately, the series did not make the third season so the story is left somewhat up in the air.

It could have been really good, but it all falls apart due to writers having their hands tied by a limited budget.

Throughout the two seasons of the show, the writers seem to actively avoid using the main plot device (i.e. the Witchblade) like the plague because they know that their limited budget will not do it justice. When it does come time for some Witchblade fighting, we are exposed to bad techno music and strobe lights to make the lame special effects look better than they really are. And every single fight looks exactly the same. The writers must have known this was a problem, so they try to avoid having combat whenever possible. What we are left with is a series that has a supernatural background, but tries to ignore it at every opportunity. This series just fails to do the franchise justice.",1229817600,4,975,4.477528089887641

Amusing character portrayed by Eric Etebari who is heavily infatuated with the heroine and basically an errand boy for a wealthy industrialist who seeks to control the ""ultimate weapon"" lends a somewhat comic flavor to the proceedings.

3400691,5,B00170LCWC,"I saw the series when it initially aired on TNT, and I found it fresh, exciting and captivating. The combination of pure escapist fantasy and cop drama worked well in this incarnation. Yes, it was strange, but strange doesn't mean that it wasn't entertaining. By juxtaposition of an ages-old metaphysical history against Sara Pezzini's attempts to cope with that in the framework of her contemporary physical world, it created a whole new universe for the writers to dabble in. I believe that people who enjoyed ""Sliders"" ""Farscape"" and ""Quantum Leap"" would have enjoyed this show, as well.

All good drama contains conflict, and in this case the conflict was manifest in Sara's efforts to reconcile the mundane and the metaphysical. At first a hard-bitten cynic, we see Sara slowly and begrudgingly grow spiritually and emotionally as she begins to accept and embrace her destiny as the current bearer of the Witchblade.

I was introduced first to the TV series, and then I want back to check out the comic: yet I found the series more accessible. At points during the series you were left wondering along with Sara if she was hallucinating or having visions of events that actually happened--which helped build tension in the storyline.

The important thing is that within the context of that story, it made sense, and helped move the plot forward effectively. It makes no sense to attempt to bring comic-book characters to the big screen, if all you're going to do is regurgitate the comic-book legend exactly as it appeared in print. An effective re-imagining actually takes old characters and makes them fresh and relevant again, as in the re-imagining of the Superboy legend in the Smallville TV series. I've read the Superman and Superboy comics growing up, which were mostly kind of corny. Smallville has taken the development of young Kal-el and made him contemporary and interesting again.

If a film or TV adaptation of a story originally told in graphic novel or comic book format stays true to the spirit and intent of the character, and changes are made to improve the dramatic flow in that direction, then those changes should be embraced as a welcome improvement, and not dismissed offhandedly from the dogmatic perspective of it straying from the comic, or being too different.",1223683200,86,2294,4.981723237597911

The series is structured like a cop drama, but there are a lot of sci/fi and fantasy elements to it. The Witchblade is a magic item with enough of a personality to be subtly controlling events and Sara's destiny.

Yancy Butler plays a convincing tough yet sexy female cop, Sara Pezzini. She does a great job acting, and would reccomend this series on the strength of her personality alone.

I also especially like the dynamic between her and Nottingham (Eric Etebari). Nottingham is a secret favorite of mine, even though he's only a minor character. I'm not sure why he appeals to me so much, but he's the mysterious, cool, and somewhat weird (creepy?) lackey of the ""bad guy"" Kennith Irons. It's hard to figure out what his motives are, but sometimes totally the amoral assassin, sometimes he seems to be in hopeless unrequited love with Sara. But that's just my take on him...

It seems a little late to critique the writers of this series but I tired of the parade of dispicable characters (corrupt cops, megolomaniacs, a demon, a pedophile, mass murderers, super-assassins, and failed super-heroes) and their horrific acts.  It does, however match the trend of trying to represent super heroes as life would really be for them.  The problem is that the fantasy of superheroes succeeded because it was not real life.

This DVD contains both full seasons and well as the pilot movie. Also included are quick snippets from thoughts of the character Gabriel, 2 short features on the making of Witchblade (20 mins all together) and the casting sessions of the cast. The show as a whole was very good. If your expecting the costume from the comic series to make an appearance, you'll be disappointed. Only a gauntlet appears taking on 3-4 different shapes - bracelet, sword, full gauntlet and a gauntlet that resembles a brass knuckle type weapon. The last style of gauntlet didn't appear until the 2nd season.

It did not have the same ""zip"" as the first season.  It's like ""Farscape"" in the fourth season, it seems the idea factory had run out of ideas.  It had a few good ones, but not a whole season.

I found the start quite long but the story with it's mysterious people and multiple plots running alongside the witchblade kept me intrigued. I have really enjoyed the whole series and would recomend it to anyone who likes mysteries and fantasy.",1219968000,,521,6.565217391304348
3400711,4,B00170LCWC,"I never read the comic books/graphic novels that this series was based upon. That didn't deter me from watching the series back in 2000, nor buying it now.

The series' special effects stand up to the special effects being produced for tv and movies being made today with only one exception. The scenes where Sara walks through fire are obviously computer generated and that shows on the screen. That could have been redone to better effect with the release of the dvd.

The series fascinated me because it was one of the first shows to come out where the hero was a woman. I like that Sara typified everything good and bad about our gender.  She was tough with a kind heart, she was capable of great love and a fierce sense of justice.  What was right and wrong was so ingrained in Sara that you knew she was always going to do the right thing, even if she had to do it outside of what is considered correct in society.

I do have one gripe about the series. I think the mythology of the Witchblade and the bloodlines could have been better explained. I think Sara should have become custodian of the archives instead of them being passed to Ian.  It was a complex series and I have no doubt it would have been explored more had the series returned for a third and fourth season.  It clearly screams for a revival. Who knows, maybe Sci-Fi can find space for the reruns and see if there is still and audience for a new series.

I seem to remember more music in the original series, this dvd seems to be a bit heavy with U2. I'm a fan of U2, but it could have been more like the original with its variety of tight music.",1219968000,,1619,4.285245901639344

The writing took it away...I liked the build up to episode eleven then wow!  Talk about ""Jumping the Shark"" to the extreme.  Completely wrecked the show and I can now see with clear eyes why it was given the pink slip. That was right up there with the famous Dallas dream it all didn't happen episode.

3400717,5,B00170LCWC,"The Good Things
*Excellent amount of action and special effects.
*Excellent filming style.  It's very vivid and has a lot of unique imagery.  Very different than any other show I know of.
*Good stories.
*Good characters; good acting.

The Bad Things
*Soundtrack was changed from the original broadcasted version.  I don't mind so much, since I've never seen it on TV before.  But knowledgable fans may be dissapointed.
*Some special effects look a bit fake (then again, this show is getting old).

The Questionable Things
*Some parts (largely in the pilot episode/movie) have an extremely hyper strobing effect.  Can be seen as either stylish or irritating.

This is a very different, unique, and vivid comic-book inspired TV show.  So much so, that it surpasses most others and can be considered one of the best.  There is hardly anything unlikable or dull about it; its simply great.  Highly reccomended to everybody.

The DVD has excellent image and sound quality.  It is in widescreen.  It contains a few featurettes and commentaries on selected episodes.

Also be sure to check out the anime version.  It's pretty darn awesome too!

3400718,5,B00170LCWC,"Well I am going to stick my neck out and say I think the above is quite possibly a real gem - I have just finished watching it on DVD and was really impressed with the story and character development, and was also surprised with the picture quality too! The DVD Box-Set has all 2 seasons compiled in one set.

PQ (Picture Quality)
The DVD is presented in matted widescreen conversion form its original 4:3 format - surprisingly many of the scenes are of very good quality and it appears to have been well done in most cases. The panoramic scene setting views seem to have suffered, the quality was poorer with some pixilation, artefacts, and similar, and the occasional close up shots of statues and buildings looked to have been stretched to 16:9 so looked distorted. However all shots of actual cast and action scenes and so on were clear and almost always very good quality. I played the discs on my New Zealand purchased PS3 (despite them officially being coded R1 - so they are Region Free) and used the PS3's upsampling to 1080p for my Samsung 50"" HD Plasma DP getting a very tidy image, especially close ups of people & faces, etc. For a remastered 2001 TV series I was pleasantly surprised with the Picture Quality result, and with the quality of the actual writing/material/acting it was well worth the few imperfections. Displaying SD material up onto a full HD display normally highlights issues in the quality of the SD material and this set came through very well..

SQ (Sound Quality)
Although sound quality was not super-fantastic, it was still very good and I generally found it very satisfactory and there were sufficient ambience and surround effects in the remastering to immerse you in most scenes - although I think overall this is the weakest area of the DVD production. The Series on the DVD itself has a very good score of music (IMO) from a variety of artists and genres and they set both mood and pace very well and have a unique distinctness similar in ways to the early Buffy episodes & Firefly for example.... However other fans of the original TV broadcast version of the show have noted a change to the musical score.

CONTENT
I originally only saw 2-3 odd random episodes of Witchblade when it screened here in New Zealand many years ago and found it disjointed and difficult to follow - but now I have seen the full content of both seasons in sequence I understand, especially with the major event at the end of Season 1 - it really has a very rich and complex story with a couple of distinct twists or unexpected events that as a result make it important to view the episodes in sequence and missing a few breaks the continuity. I had always been a bit ambivalent to this series because of the above experience with the original broadcast but having taken the punt to order a copy of the box set from Amazon I have certainly not regretted it and would rate this one of the most enjoyable sci-fi/occult/fantasy type TV shows produced to date that I have viewed. The DVD set has all 24 episodes (including the 90 minute premiere) providing almost 19 hours of the show plus some special features. The special effects in many cases are fantastic quality for a TV Series that screened in 2001 (& 2002) and compare very favourably, if not better, to much of the similar effects used in The Matrix (released in 2000), as another reviewer has noted. My only less than 100% positive comments would be regarding the erratic character of Ian Nottingham, which seems disjointed and as other reviewers here have said seems to suffer from a mix of bad acting and/or inconsistent writing; a similar (but much lesser) issue with Jake McCartey in the later part of the second season; and a minor issue with the last 2-3 episodes of the second season, which while they are still a high quality in general there is a subtle but noticeable change in the scripting, which just takes a bit of the Oomph out of the pace of the show - up until those episodes both seasons move reasonably fast and are intense, full of action, building intrigue & suspense, and more - the last 2-3 episodes just seem a bit slower, and a bit slower and more self-contained than the previous 21-22 episodes, so one wonders if there was a change of writers or if perhaps the writer(s) knew the show wasn't to be renewed and lost focus (although there is clearly no attempt to 'close off' the story or have a dramatic finale - so it is just left hanging with a bit of a non-descript ending).

Overall I also enjoyed the little subtleties too, like the pop-culturish jokes (e.g. one about subjecting people to reruns of South Park made in the context of someone being crazy/insane), and other references to the world as it was in 2001-2002, and as others have mentioned the quality of the acting is surprisingly good overall...

Overall this is an excellent high quality series from a content perspective, and the production of the DVD set appears to be very good overall too (barring the comments above). A must have if you are a fan of this series or a fan of these type of shows - if you liked Heroes (at least Season 1 anyway) you will probably like this, as much of the time in both seasons it has that same fast paced 'save the world' feel present in Heroes S1, with also a very strong conspiracy 'alone against the world' desperation in season 1.

P.S. It has been commented that some of the music is changed from the original - as I did not see the full broadcast of the show on TV originally I cannot comment on that. Personally I found the musical score generally very good.",1218931200,3,5571,4.543824701195219
3400719,5,B00170LCWC,"I watched this show a bit during college when it was on TNT and really enjoyed it. I just finished watching the complete series and I'm still impressed. It completely sucked me in emotionally to the point where some episodes were almost unbearably tense to watch because I was afraid of the outcome. You never feel ""safe"" watching this show because odd plot twists and turns constantly crop up, defying predictions, and I knew my favorite characters could be killed (or be reborn) at any moment. It's not a show for everyone since it's comic book origins show through clearly, but I loved it.",1218844800,,592,4.701923076923077

Witchblade is worth seeing over and over again. The magic tale, the nice effects, the good acting and the good looking Yancy Butler as Sara Pezzini - the witchblade (carrier).

The problem is that they changed the soundtrack for each episode.  I'm not sure what the motivation for doing this was, but it really sucks.  Scenes that I remember as fast-paced and exciting such as Nottingham chasing Mobius to the sound of The Crystal Method have now become dull and sluggish.  You don't realize what an impact the music has until it changes.  Some of the new music sounds like someone dubbed a $10 Walmart electric keyboard's electronic beat into the show.  No more Sarah McLachlan, Gerrard McMahon, or Soul Coughing.  Every good song from the series was replaced with something that feels totally alien and inappropriate to the action on the screen.

Take that into consideration before buying this DVD set.

I thought, ""So help me, if the pilot movie doesn't end with The Guess Who's American Woman, I'm gonna cry.""  Never fear, that piece of music is as it should be.  I did notice several other music choices had changed - I've really only watched my favorite episode, Thanatopsis, so far - and the music that was playing when Gabriel entered Sly's home is definitely different.  Still, I'm happy overall with the set, though the dialogue doesn't seem to be mixed very well (hard to hear, and I know it wasn't on the VHS copies I have from the show's original run on TNT).  I can at least get my ""Notty"" fix without worrying about wearing a videotape out. :-)",1217894400,2,800,4.306666666666667
3400725,3,B00170LCWC,"I recently received my DVD package of the complete series, and I eagerly started watching it.  By the time I got to episode three, my fears were confirmed:  a lot of the original music evidently wasn't licensed for the DVDs when they aired the show (even though this show came on during the age of selling packaged seasons on video).  I had suspected it, but I knew for sure when the cool oldies in Gabriel's place and ""Kitten Moon"" by Fluke which had played in the bar were replaced by generic techno.

I'm not a comic book reader, so I came into the show cold.  A lot of my enjoyment came from the outstanding music, especially in season one.  I found a lot of great bands and rediscovered a lot of great oldies via this show, and to have them replaced by generic stuff was hugely disappointing.

If you aren't in it for the music, then you will enjoy this DVD presentation because it is crisp, clean, and in letterbox format.  However, if you are looking for all that amazing music, buyer beware.",1217721600,3,999,4.420765027322404

Enough has been said about the stories and their lasting appeal and the actors in the show.  Yancy Butler made the character her own and it is a shame she could not make a third season...

The thing I DID notice is some of the music was not the same as the original.  This was most noticeable in the episode, Diplopia, where the Gabriel Bowman character was introduced to Three Dog Night's Road to Shambala to show Bowman's retro music taste.  This was not what was playing on the DVD version compared to the taped episode I have when it aired.  This does not take away from the story, but is a point where the aired show might not match the DVD version.",1217462400,,818,4.2727272727272725
3400727,4,B00170LCWC,"Finally nice to have this on DVD, picture quality is great and fantastic to see the show in Widescreen. For those who remember when the TV series first aired there are some music substitutions, it's listed on the back on the special features saying new soundtrack by producer. So far I've noticed Shambala by Three Dog Night and Solsbury Hill by Peter Gabriel missing, the songs they were replaced with are okay, doesn't take away from the episodes that much.",1217376000,2,459,4.75

4 episodes per disk, with exception of two (one had 3 episodes, last disk has 2 episodes).  Small but nice pamphlet comes with the set, stating episode names for each disk.

Main problem with the disks is that the music that was originally created for the series is the only music that comes with the DVD's.  Copyrighted music that originally aired on TNT is not included (i.e. Crystal Method's ""Trip Like I Do"" is not included at the beginning of the first episode of the first season, as it originally aired on TNT.)

The back of the DVD box says ""Features an All-New Soundtrack Selected by the Executive Producer"".  Translation:  They didn't pay for some of the music rights.

However, I will say that the music selection to cover up the original music is not bad at all, just not exactly how it aired on TNT.",1217289600,2,890,4.50625

While I was aware that it was based on a comic book, I had not read the comic before watching the show.  So my experience was more that the comic was not taking after the show enough (when I finally read the comic to try and get my Witchblade fix when the show was cancelled).
I thought Yancy Butler was great as the lead - broody and trying to figure out what is this strange thing that has come into her life.  But I did feel that she never quite grew beyond that.  It felt like she was always one step behind Kenneth Irons (the ""bad-guy"" played wonderfuly by Anthony Cistaro (anyone else remember him trying to steal Woody Harrelson's girfriend in Cheers?).

It's only been off the air for 6 years, but it feels like 60! The Witchblade was one of the best shows on TV ever! Luckily I taped every episode and have watched the reruns for years on tape. Season one was especially fantastic.  Special note to Episode 7 (Lagrimas) in Season 2, guest starring Burn Notice's own Jeffery Donovan - not to be missed! What ended up being the final episode of the show is a stunning commentary on owning the power of the feminine in oneself, and how that ownership is graceful, fearless and beautiful.  I MISS THIS SHOW!

To the writers, producers and executives at TNT - find away to bring this great show back!

I was so happy when Amazon alerted me that Witchblade was finally being released on DVD.  I purchased a copy within 2 seconds with no care to the cost.  This show is worth it.",1214352000,4,968,4.471590909090909

3400733,5,B00170LCWC,"I'm so excited that Warner Bros. decided to release the DVD set as the complete series (movie, Season 1, Season 2).  Ralph Hemecker did a fantastic job creating a show that complemented the comic series, without imitating it. Frankly, if they had tried to go with the comic's look, the rating would be too high for tv. It would have resembled soft porn, so I'm glad they went with the ""beautiful, but tough"" portrayal instead.

Yancy Butler's portrayal of Sara Pezzinni as a cop struggling to learn the effects of the Witchblade on her life and career was amazing.  I also found Anthony Cistaro's enigmatic Kenneth Irons more interesting than the comic, where the character as more overtly power hungry.  Will Yun Lee and David Chokachi were perfect as Sara's fellow detectives.  The introduction of Gabriel (John Hensley) in season 1 set the stage for great interactions between the talented cast. Terrific guest stars like Peter Mensah (300), Kim DeLury (Farscape Peacekeeper) and Roger Daultry added to the mix.

This was TNT's first television series success and they didn't seem to know how to handle it. For season two, I got the impression the execs became more involved and felt they had to change things up in order to justify their salaries.  Ralph's consistent vision, which pulled viewers into the movie and first season was derailed with many stand alone episodes and the ""death"" of a major character, who was one of the show's strongest actors.  The episodes were ok, but not as compelling as earlier developments and I believe most fans were excited for a third season, with Ralph back in control.  Unfortunately, that never happened.

Still, the series is still the best of it's kind that I've seen.  I hope that we get lots of DVD extras, like cast and crew episode commentaries, the TNT web videos, design, and new cast interviews.  After 5-6 years of waiting, fans deserve a plethora of bonuses!",1212278400,12,1914,4.855384615384615

Oh, that we had DVR back when and a DVD recorder, I wouldn't have had such an impatient wait.  Needless to say, when I received the Amazon email I excitedly pre-ordered my copy within 30 seconds of reading it.  I think I can sell my copied dvds now if anyone would buy such bad copies now that the pristine DVDs will be out.

3400740,5,B00170LCWC,"Not only was it one of the most complex series in the history of cable television, Witchblade was easily one of the most underrated. Witchblade debuted in a full-length television pilot on TNT and then after its initial success became a full-fledged series in 2001. In many ways the show was ahead of its time. It managed to be both science-fiction (when the genre was suffering from unoriginal sequels and poorly made remakes), fantasy (before the genre was validated by&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lord-of-the-Rings/dp/B000654ZK0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lord of the Rings</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pan-s-Labyrinth/dp/B00005JPA6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pan's Labyrinth</a>) and added a healthy dose of cop drama. The intricate plotlines featured such esoteric subject matter as psychic visions, cloning, abnormal psychology, time travel, reincarnation, demonic possession, mythological motifs, multiple conspiracies, occult philosophical ideologies, and also benefited from clever pop-culture in-jokes.
The series was brought to life by strong acting from a diverse, if not at times dysfunctional cast. Witchblade also featured a greatly varying soundtrack (this DVD does not include all of the artists I've named here; see my comment for further explanation) that included everyone from The Crystal Method to Peter Gabriel, from Rob Zombie to Enya, from Three Dog Night to U2. The series burst off the small screen with great visual flare, the special effects were almost on a par with the first&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Matrix/dp/B00000K19E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Matrix</a>&nbsp;film, and the camerawork was equally impressive.
There have been some fans of the comics who have complained about the many differences between the show and the comics. But as I was at the time unfamiliar with the comics, I enjoyed the show from a fresh, purely objective perspective. I also think that most fans of the source material understood that this was not an adaptation in the strictest sense but more of a loosely inspired series that dealt with some of the same themes.
And now fans of this cult classic can enjoy their favorite comic book-inspired heroine on DVD... at last.

The characters include:
Sara Pezzini- A New York homicide cop and the ""Blade-wielder""
Danny Woo- Sara's partner and close friend.
Jake McCartey- Sara's rookie partner in training.
Gabriel Bowman- A young occult/novelty shop owner and close friend of Sara's.
Kenneth Irons- A billionaire who may be more than he seems.
Ian Nottingham- A mysterious bodyguard/assassin in Iron's employ.
Black Dragons- A group of assassins who underwent experimental training.
White Bulls- A secretive fraternity of corrupt vigilante cops.

Here is the entire listing of episodes, including the pilot film (which is also included):

I hope you will check out one of the coolest shows in recent years. ""Rock on dot com!""",1208822400,355,6542,5.410433070866142
3400741,5,B00170LCWC,"I saw this series when it first came out on t.v. The witchblade is an ancient weapon that can be wielded only by a woman, one particular woman infact. When she dies the witchblade waits for her to be reincarnated. The witchblade was created for the purpose of bringing justice to those who need it and punishment to the bad guy. This series was done very well and Yancy Butler did a superb job as the Heroine. Non stop action and some very cool sword fighting. On the down side toward the end of this series it starts getting really weird and even blasphemes, just FYI.",1208563200,14,569,4.377358490566038
3400742,3,B00170LCWC,"If you are a diehard Witchblade fan, you're going to buy and enjoy this tv series regardless of what any review says.  What I offer here is a review for the ""discerning"" viewer.  It is possible to be a fan of an intellectual property (such as a comic book) and yet maintain a clear, honest judgment about different aspects of the property's use in different media, something that fanboys and fangirls do not understand.  The bottom line is that as a cop drama, the Witchblade tv series is top notch.  It's one of the best cop dramas ever to grace the small screen.  However, as a faithful adaptation of the Witchblade comic book, it is a complete and utter failure.  By the time they were three or four episodes into the first season, the tv show had severed all ties with the comic book and had become its own independent entity.  The only thing the comic book and the show have in common is that they are both called ""Witchblade,"" and some of the character's names are the same.  The argument that one can't directly reproduce the comic book on the tv screen is a cop-out (no pun intended), because the tv show doesn't even try to represent the comic.  On the contrary, once the first two episodes were concluded (known as Witchblade: The Movie), the tv series immediately set about to distance itself as much as it could from the comic.  I could go into detail about this, but I don't wish to do a disservice to viewers who have never seen the show before by spoiling plot elements.  Suffice it to say that what you are getting here is not a television adaptation of the comic book, but a different creation entirely.

That said, I really have to give props to Yancy Butler, the actress who plays Sara Pezzini in this series.  Before I saw her in this tv series, I thought she was just another Hollywood bimbo willing to bare her chest in any B movie she could land a job on.  Oh was I wrong.  Yancy is a very talented actress, and she is the best (and only, in my opinion) reason to buy and watch this series.  Correction: Yancy and John Hensley.  John Hensley plays the part of Gabriel, a dealer in very unique and rare items.  He assists Sara frequently in her investigations because he knows a lot about wierd, arcane stuff.  He plays the part with a confidence and coolness combined with a youthful hipness that makes him very likeable.  My favorite parts of the show are the times when Sara and Gabriel are working together.

It is a bit odd that a show which features such talented actors as Butler and Hensley would also employ the horrid acting abilities of Eric Etebari, the actor who plays Ian Nottingham.  Mr. Etebari is one of the worst actors I've ever seen, but I can't lay the blame completely at his feet.  His character, Nottingham, was not well conceived by the show's writers and producers.  He is nothing like the Nottingham of the comic, but neither is he a well-defined character in his own right in the world of the show.  All throughout the series, the writers seem to be struggling with exactly who they want Nottingham to be, and the result is that Etebari seems unsure of how to play him.  Some of his lines and scenes are so bad as to reach comical levels of absurdity.  Fortunately, Nottingham isn't nearly as present in the second season as he was in the first.

If you're asking the question, ""How much Witchblade action can I see?"", the answer is very little.  Truth be told, this series isn't really about the Witchblade.  It's about Sara, her life as a cop, and the decisions she faces about doing the right thing.  The Blade itself takes a backseat role, usually only appearing once per episode and only very briefly.  Sara usually uses it to block bullets Wonder Woman-style.  It also occasionally grants Sara a ""sixth sense"" at crime scenes which allows her to see through the eyes of the victim or to witness crimes as they are happening elsewhere.  Think the tv show Medium, only the actress has a funky silver bracelet on her wrist.

So that's my Witchblade tv series review for the ""discerning"" viewer.  I hope it helps you to decide whether to purchase it or not.",1208476800,198,4109,4.497975708502024

I think it was pulled because of Yancys' brief time in rehab.(Big deal; her dad was in ""The Lovin Spoonfull"" from the 60's, which alot of us found to be better times in our lives than the depressing times we're having now) so you learn by your mistakes.

This series is a world-class quality production in every aspect:  The original sound track is a musical masterpiece that captures and embodies the series' magical spirit.

You can sense that she has become possessed by the character, Sara, and you can feel her anguish.  This series, despite its short run on TV, has elements of greatness.  And it is gradually becoming a cult classic and a treasured collector's item.  A Personal Note:  Ever since I saw the movie ""Hard Target"", I've been in love with Yancy Butler.
