8371871,5,B002KBAXA4,"This is one of my favorites of the Modern Marvels series. This video reviews some of the most incredible examples of ""Raw Horsepower"" on Planet Earth, and I am not just talking about cars or boats that go fast. It talks briefly about the very beings of the scientific definition, mathematically with James Watt, of Horsepower. Being an engineer and enthusiast of how Horsepower and Torque are made, this video really hit the jackpot. 5/5 stars all the way!",1372636800,,456,4.784810126582278
