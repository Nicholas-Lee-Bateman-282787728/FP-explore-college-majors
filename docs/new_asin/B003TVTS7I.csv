4192914,5,B003TVTS7I,"My review has some spoilers below!

-------------------------------

I thought this movie was just like any other teen movie I watched, but it actually has a great storyline with it. There are the stupid comedy themes as in every other teen movies, but the story really set this movie apart from them.

It's about Chapin a staker type girl, who goes to a new public school and has a mystery past involving the reason why she left her old Catholic school. She makes friends with another new girl at school, Eve. They are BFFs. But, Eve starts to slowly discover why Chapin left her old school. Eve finds out that Chapin has something to do with a death of a girl back at Chapin last school. Eve wants to find out what Chapin has done and help her out. Eve wants to discover how exactly Chapin was involved and how the dead girl died.

While all of the above is going on, the movies in and out of the above story while the girls are in a group of girls playing a game called Triple Dog dare. We see all these girls do their dares and they are pretty fun/cool to watch them do them. There's no stupid dares like girl kiss a girl because that is pretty easy to do and isn't worth daring. No, triple dog dare involves more on the line. All the girls throw in all the money they have and one most value item. The winner will get all the winnings at the end.

The game is played by the host starts off picking out the order and a person to dare that first person what to do. If any person refuses to do a dare then that person will get their head shaved. The dared person can picked not to do the dare and another person to do it, but if that person does do the dare they still get their head shaved. The only thing they cannot picked to dare someone to do is to get their head shaved. (Probably because the game would be pointless then.)  Later we find out this game is also involved with the reason why Chapin left her old school and the dead girls death.

This movie could easily be a movie in the theaters as their are many movies in theaters that totally are not worth watching, but this one actually is. I do recommend it and is a buy.",1337212800,,2134,4.165048543689321
4192915,2,B003TVTS7I,"Maybe it's just me, but I was confused in the beginning of the movie on what happened with the girls before the sleepover. It took me like 40 minutes into the movie to understand what fights and hate was about between the girls. Then second thing is, the stupid part is why is it someone who just moved into town wants to start digging up a past that doesn't have anything to do with them or even have any affect on their future what so ever. It's not important let the past be the past. And lastly, I think the characters contradict their personalities. Like for example one time some are shy, quiet and reserved and the next they're loud and buck-wild. I thought it was alright but I think it could've been better in so many ways.",1327881600,,732,4.311594202898551
4192916,5,B003TVTS7I,"I am surprised that with an all young female cast (he main cast) the writers kept it clean considering the film is based on dares. No girl on girl action as you would expect in most teen films. In anycase I'm not a fan of the ending but the movie was interesting. Triple dog dares..remind me never to play this game, Ill be damned if Im caught peeing on someones porch or robbing a convenient store. The parts are played great. You just gotta love the snotty brat on the cover. I loved Danna from Step by Step because she was a brat, always had something smart to say. It's not a horror film, its more of a comedic drama. I enjoyed it, the cast is beautiful, they each have their own style, which is refreshing.",1299024000,,711,4.235294117647059
4192917,5,B003TVTS7I,"I hope this review doesn't damage my review credibility. I'm avid Movie Collector and collect all styles of movies, I some how came across the lone 5 star review on Amazon, went to Youtube checked out the trailer and was sold. There aren't many reviews online for triple-dog so I wanted to give this little gem Its due. I own a few cheesy quality Movies that flew under the radar that some men wouldn't want to be caught watching, (16 WISHES, WISH APON A STAR, READ IT AND WEEP) all made for Disney Channel Movies, but triple-dog has enough edge and fresh ideas that I can see grown men hiding this under there collection of Action Movies. I don't think it fair to judge this movie with Oscar level movies, like American Beauty, Slum Dog Millionaire, Titanic, its just too different, but if compared to modern teen or tween Movies I'll stand by the 5 star review.

  This is a surprising rated R movie, I say 13+ is o.k, teens would see more Sexuality and Vulgarity in a episode of Jersey Shore than triple-dog, the prevailing question is what really happened to the girl that jumped from the bridge ? and what does Chapin ""skater girl with edge"" have to do with it ?, who will get there head shaved ?, who will win the game of triple-dog ?, If you buy this movie for your teens,""Mom and Dad can be Cool for at least one night"". A really good job by Brittany Roberts as the lead Chapin, a quality supporting casts, some amusing dares and it all will pay off in the end. ""Really good Teen Drama for adults too"".",1294185600,13,1510,4.366548042704626
4192918,5,B003TVTS7I,"Cheesy and corny, I like! This movie is supposedly a horror movie, but its more like a Comedy-Thriller-Drama. I absolutely love Scout Taylor-Compton and she usually makes some good indie movies and I really liked this one. It's a very cheesy movie but I really enjoyed it. I recommend this one for tweens who aren't really into the Horror genre, this one is good fun!",1286236800,9,367,4.661538461538462
4192919,4,B003TVTS7I,Love the movie definitely not for younger kids and Chapin and Winter or whatever his name is would make a really cute couple.,1422921600,,125,4.478260869565218
4192920,4,B003TVTS7I,really good movie,1417478400,,17,5.0
4192921,5,B003TVTS7I,"Upon first viewing this film appears as simply another teen angst\sex comedy, just a carbon copy of the hundreds of such films that have been ground out in the decades since World War II.  Upon further review, however, this film emerges as a quite serious study of bullying and peer pressure among teenage girls.  The coming together of the girls at the slumber party creates an almost tribal group dynamic that is well-known to psychologists, sociologists and educators.  As has often been noted, teenage girls engage in bullying not so much by physical intimidation and violence, yet rather via establishing cliques, pecking orders and manipulating friendships.  This film clearly demonstrates these mechanics of bullying among teenage girls.  Once the group dynamic and pack leader status of the Chapin character is established, such creates the atmosphere that causes the girls to engage in increasingly risky dares owing the bullying of the pack leader and communal peer pressure.  This film demonstrates in an excellent manner how each of the girls were caught up in the communal peer dynamic, driving them to engage in acts that each of them would have never engaged in individually.  The film also indirectly demonstrates the chain reaction the communal peer dynamic creates; while the first dares are not that serious, such leads to an communal peer escalation until by the end of the film the girls are engaging in extremely dangerous stunts.  The film as well demonstrates how the underlying guilt and feelings of worthlessness on the part of the Chapin character lead to her establishing herself as pack leader and to her bullying of the other girls.  This film is an excellent study of teenage psychology and actually a very good warning of how tragedies can result from bullying and peer pressure.  I feel the film at least indirectly demonstrates that such tragedies are not only among adolescents with such events as school shootings or the accidental death portrayed in the film, yet as well when such communal peer pressure dynamic is carried into adulthood, leading to such horrendous events as the Jonestown massacre.  A good film for adolescents and adults alike, with a message of possible maturity beyond bullying and learning individual self-worth at the conclusion.",1415664000,2,2290,5.1455525606469
4192922,3,B003TVTS7I,The movie plot is kind of dumb but for me having Britt Robertson in it saved it.,1409788800,,80,3.764705882352941

4192925,4,B003TVTS7I,"High school girls caught up in bullying and peer pressure. Alternately lighthearted and dark this movie has a bit of a bite to it. Fairly good depiction of 16 year old girls and their clicks, not for pre teens.",1407974400,,210,4.410256410256411
4192926,1,B003TVTS7I,"Okay, to be fair I didn't actually watch the movie. I was just checking for content to figure out why it was rated R. Within the first 3 minutes of the film the girls are talking about 'doing' the principal and two-girls-one-cup was mentioned. The acting is terrible and I hate movies about spoiled teenagers. I have spoiled teenagers!! Don't waste your time. I only wasted 3 minutes of mine.",1406592000,,392,4.614285714285714
4192927,1,B003TVTS7I,Awful movie,1405123200,,11,5.0
4192928,1,B003TVTS7I,"Ugh. Hated every bit of it. Only reason I watched the whole thing was because I refuse to leave a movie unfinished. The acting was terrible, especially the main character. The script was unreasonable and laughable really.",1401408000,3,221,5.0
4192929,5,B003TVTS7I,"The storyline and plot are very intricate and well thought out. The alleged main character turns out to be nothing but a secondary character and basically it goes on from there. A simple birthday celebration turns into a game of truth or dare for 5 teen girls. As the dares get edgier and edgier, they soon find out the real reason behind a former student's death. That's all I can say about the plot without spoiling it for ya. I definitely recommend you pick this up if nothing just to laugh at all the faux pas. It's well priced and it's definitely got a special spot in my library.",1401321600,,585,4.376146788990826
4192930,4,B003TVTS7I,"The movie was worth the watch, especially for Britt Robertson. Her acting was very well done.............everyone else, not so much.",1399766400,,132,5.65
4192931,5,B003TVTS7I,this was a great movie about teenagers pier-pressure I recommend you watch with your teenager not  for younger kids any way thank you for my DVD it arrived on time and as described,1392422400,,180,4.454545454545454
4192932,4,B003TVTS7I,It wasn't bad i kept watching waiting for something big that never really happened but still overall was worth a watch.,1389398400,,119,4.714285714285714
4192933,5,B003TVTS7I,"I was expecting a puff piece teenage movie with cheesy acting and was pleasantly surprised by this movie.  It's not one that I would buy, but rent.  It did keep me guessing what the girls would do next, I never expected any gore horror, it never gave me that type of feeling........but it did give me a feeling that it might send out some positive messages to those ""popular girls"" to stop, take a second and really LOOK at the ones they call Rat Girl, or shun because of the horrible stories they heard of one girl being expelled from one school.

I could go off on a rant about how we all ended up in cliques in high school and haters will be haters - but folks, it needs to stop.  This movie doesn't make HUGE strides in that direction, but tiny baby steps is a good way to start too.  You take 3 popular girls, 1 rat girl, 1 rebel and 1 girl on the fence (the movie set up) and throw them into a Triple Dog Dare game - and they all come out being friends....not all of them firm steady friends, but at least with an understanding of WHY they are the way they are.  And they are all there for each other as they face their greatest fears.

This isn't a movie that will change society, but if it reaches just one or two kids with it's message - that to be different is OKAY, turn to your friends when you need help - then maybe there is hope.  When I was in school you couldn't get an automatic gun as easily as you can today or build an IED using info from the internet.  Kids are hurting and are hurting each other because of non-tolerance.  They need to know that there are other ways to solve problems and that everything will be okay given time.  Goodness knows I went thru high school as a very over weight girl, but I ended up in the career I trained for and am now retired and those school years are a very distant, pleasant memory. Yes, PLEASANT - cause high school beats the corporate world hands down!!!",1383609600,,1916,4.151351351351352
4192934,5,B003TVTS7I,Good movie! love the on going drama and suspence. Deff took me back to my teenage days when promises were not meant to be broken and friendship lasted forever!,1378598400,2,159,4.517241379310345
4192935,4,B003TVTS7I,"This turned out to be wayyy better than I expected .. Kind of like a ""truth or dare"" (minus the truth) that almost goes very wrong. The triple dog dares made by the girls are fun & exciting. Very much what you would expect from girls in that age group. Characters like the ring leader Chapin really stand out. Peer pressure seems to be the main theme that is examined throughout the movie. A good watch.",1376611200,5,403,4.315789473684211

4192939,5,B003TVTS7I,"Great Movie!! Contains the basics that all preteens and teens are aware of, nothing too extreme. Yes, it may seem cheesy but it's a really great movie. Need any (out-there) crazy sleepover ideas? Just watch this movie, you'd love it...especially, if you love extreme dares!! :)",1365033600,2,277,5.043478260869565
4192940,5,B003TVTS7I,this movie is awesome. it's really funny and it's realistic. i think what i like most about it is that it is so realistic. highly recommended.,1364428800,,142,4.5
4192941,5,B003TVTS7I,My sixteen year old daughter loves this movie! Defiantly one of her favorite go to movies. She has probably watched this movie at least 4 times!,1364083200,,144,4.576923076923077
4192942,3,B003TVTS7I,"Plot: I myself do not own the blu-ray of this movie but I watched it a couple times, the first on netflix(Rated R Version) and the second time on Lifetime(Edited Version). The movie is basically about a group of teen girls and Chapin(The egotistical skater and main character) has previously been through a game called ""Triple Dog"". Fast forward to a couple months later and now it is Eve's birthday(2nd Main character. The party was getting boring for Chapin so she decides to challenge the other girls to a game she went through herself called ""Triple Dog"" and loser gets their head shaved.

Thoughts: I thought the movie itself was just a typical chick flick that they would be showing in like a bullying class or the lifetime channel. It was pretty corny but that was expected but the plot lures you in but its not a movie that would be fit for movie theatres across the nation. I'm not gonna spoil the rest of the movie but as the dares have become more edgy between the girls we will then find out the story behind why Stacy St. Claire jumped the bridge(She commmited suicide)in a freak like accident. The slang in the movie started to become redundant to me like ""Shiz, Boyfunk"" and all that opther hot garbage but it actually started to make me chuckle a bit. Overrall I would give this movie 3 out of 5 stars.",1363392000,2,1318,4.491666666666666
4192943,4,B003TVTS7I,Why I gave four star cause they almost have everything in this movie. This movie is really good movie to watch cause they have good actress. Brittany Robetson will be great actress like Juila Robert and Jennifer Lawerson.,1360454400,,221,4.842105263157895

4192945,3,B003TVTS7I,Britt and Alexia Fast are such a teen in this and so are the rest of the girls. If only there had been more for Richard Harmon to do. Still its one of those sleepover LIFETIME movies. Its great to get the real version of it on DVD instead of the TV version.,1355184000,,257,3.8679245283018866
4192946,4,B003TVTS7I,"Hilarious is a great word for this film. So many bad lines and confusing ones: one my favorites: ""Yo would you guys Superman that Hoe for 20 bucks?"" Midway through the film as one of the girls is doing the dare of urinating on the principal's porchmat the bad girl Chapin spouts out ""Shes totally splitting the whisker!"" What the hell does that mean? Lines like that make me think, do modern teenage girls actually say things like that? Probably not, but its very funny indeed. So heres my final thoughts about this: Its a stupid/very cheesy movie with lots of hilariously bad dialogue. Watch it with friends and beers and enjoy.",1347321600,4,629,4.625
4192947,2,B003TVTS7I,"Each time I see a bad movie, I think it has to be the worst.. then I see something more insipid and inane. In this case, it's TRIPLE DOG. It wants to be Mean Girls in the worst way, but it's more like Dumb Clueless Girls. It plays like a bad CW episode of anything and ultimately, whoooooooooo cares.?!?!?! like, yeah, really, fer sure..OMG... It does have slick production values, I will give it that...

Every generation is becoming more and more Clueless, and it shows in this film.. Suburban privileged girls with small insignificant problems, and like, OMG, they just need to get it out by doing pointless dares and, like, OMG, friends stick - dad's don't, so like, let's totally shave our heads and gossip about the dead girl who jumped off a bridge in the middle of winter because she was dared to do it. Memorials on bridges where clueless teenage girls jump to thier death because they were ""dared to""... Uh oh, I like, totally said that twice..... OMG... YEAH!

(STILL 4 DAYS AGO) And what was up with that convenience store microwave? it totally looked like something out of the early 80's, and that girl flipping out over it being blown up?? It was all bogus, and I was like, OMG, that microwave was totally old and she like totally did them a massive favor.. OMG you guys, it like, had a turn dial on it..TOTALLYl!! OKAY, like, UPGRADE and whatnot....

SHUT UP!, OMG.... Wait, I just saw that it was made in Canada.. OMG, like, it's totally a Canadian movie and whatnot.. that explains it all.. and in that case, I'm cool if you're cool.. And like, at least I have friends... (3 Days Ago) ....

Devil Dog is a pointless and contrived mess.. Avoid because it's horrible. You'll like yourself slightly less for having sat through it, and OMG, totally don't let your kids watch it, not because it's inappropriate, but because you don't want your kids emulating these mindless pathetic dolts (as I had been doing for most of this review) - end the cycle!
