6600869,5,B00MU1YF80,"With 43 NUMBER ONE single hits, multiple Grammys and CMA and other awards, the trio of Randy, Jeff and Teddy - best known as Alabama - are not only total entertainers, but they are still together as original members after 45 years! That's saying something. And to watch the trio (with backup musicians) on the DVD portion of this combo set is to see the joy they have found in all these years.  You know their hits and many of them - well 17 of them - are here performed by the band and the next generation of country artists as guests on stage at the historic Ryman auditorium.

Eagle Rock has packaged the event in multiple formats. You can get the DVD, The double CD package,  the ""deluxe"" combo with both (What I got) and even vinyl for those who want to go back to the ""early days"" . If I had to choose just one - because of price - I'd take the DVD but the combo pack makes it possible to listen when not near your DVD player.

The cool think about the three guys is that, not only can they sing, they all play amazingly. Whether guitar, bass or fiddle (""You gotta have a fiddle in the band"", as the first song goes.

I enjoyed the guest artists reactions as they played with the band. They were not the stars; the band was. And, honestly, the DVD has better sight lines than if you were there at the Ryman (""the Mother Church of Country Music"") because it appears that most of the audience there stood at their seats during the show. The camera work has great close-ups though - I guess it's personal opinion of mine - I thiought that there were way too many quick cuts with the camera.

The DVD features the 90-=minute conter plus some bonus features that total 28 minutes. These are interviews with the guest artists recorded the night of the concert. Most of them are accolades to the band and how they influenced them.  After a while these become repetitive. And a few of the performers (Jason Aldean , in particular) use the phrase ""you know"" after nearly ever sentence! He's not alone, but is the worst offender. He can certainly sing and play but I would have appreciated it if the DVD's producer tried to edit out some of those. Carrie Underwood seems to have her conversation techniques under control Okay, fans of Aldean and Luke Bryan are probably not going to care. They are ""fans"". But, the supplemental material is something you'll only watch once.
So, yes, I've played the DVD and the CDs and love the set. I wonder who the band will have as their ""Friends"" for the 50th anniversary release in 2019. Should be interesting.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful!
