2636834,4,B000HEWER6,"Although it is pretty obvious that 'Head Trauma' was filmed on a shoestring, I still feel that it can compete with studio produced thrillers.  The story is interesting and there isn't the goofy explanation that is included in some movies (a recent example is 'Room 6' with Christine Taylor, where they actually have dialogue that explains what just happened as if the viewer can't figure it out on their own).

Overall, 'Head Trauma' is a nice diversion for those who like psychological thrillers somewhat in the same vein as 'Blair Witch Project' in cinematography and 'Memento' for theme.",1168300800,,590,5.010204081632653
2636835,1,B000HEWER6,"I'm a big fan of indie horror...there's really some gems hidden out there if you look hard enough.  One of them is Lance Weiler's The Last Broadcast, which is pretty much the thinking person's Blair Witch, even though it preceeded the latter.

So I was eager to check out his new film Head Trauma.  Unfortunately it fails in almost every way The Last Broadcast succeeds.  In The Last Broadcast, digital video may have been used for bugetary reasons, but it also matched the tone, themes and overall narrative of the film.  In Head Trauma, DV seems to have been used purely for budgetary reasons, giving the entire film a soft, murky look.  The uninspired lighting and camerawork doesn't help things either.  While none of the actors in The Last Broadcast won awards for their performances, they were at least believable as the characters they were portraying.  Meanwhile, the acting in Head Trauma is atrocious.  It's student film-bad.

But for indie horror fare, I'm pretty forgiving of bad acting and languid cinematography.  I've made some short films, I know how hard it is.  As long as the concept is interesting, I'm willing to ignore some sloppy execution.  The concept of The Last Broadcast was ingenious...a thoughtful yet tense examination of digital media with a twist ending that really shocked.  The concept of Head Trauma seems to be to throw every horror movie cliche at us.  And the ""twist""...well lets just say that by telling you the basic plot point that Head Trauma is about a man being terrorized by a hooded figure, I may actually be spoiling the ending for you.  I bet you can't possibly guess who the hooded figure is, can you?

There's other problems with Head Trauma...they stretch about 30 minutes worth of plot into 1:30 by introducing secondary characters who really add nothing to the film for one...but I'll leave it at that.  I have a lot of respect for people who make a truly independant feature film, as I am aware of how hard it is.  But I simply did not see a single redeeming quality in Head Trauma.",1168128000,4,2037,4.719546742209632
2636836,1,B000HEWER6,"I completely agree with the last review!!!  I bought this after reading all the WONDERFUL reviews and what a mistake that turned out to be.  WHAT haunted house??? This was terrible.  If you want a true haunted house story try a few of these and then you can say you watched a ""haunted"" house movie:  Legend of Hell House, Haunted, The Haunting (1963).",1165363200,3,351,4.523809523809524
2636837,2,B000HEWER6,"This is an example of a film hyped-up more by the people who created it than by an actual audience. This is the type of movie that you'll NEVER hear about within the context of film discourse (not even in that of cult movies), and the reason for this is that there is no trace of it in the minds of those who have viewed it; the people have simply forgotten about it. Even if this movie was merely a high school film project (as I had presumed), it probably received a failing grade. 'Head Trauma' seems to be more of a hastily-assembled portrayal of depressing inner city life in a dead end town from which there is no escape, and I suppose that's considered scary by some. WHAT was the deal with this movie?! It was almost as if the director's vision was to put the viewers to sleep as soon as possible - even the actors looked bored. The scariest and most unjustifiable aspect about this particular movie is that at one time, its shelf price was $25. I am not surprised whatsoever by the 'currently unavailable' status of this movie.",1165104000,6,1036,4.373056994818653

2636840,5,B000HEWER6,"This is one terrific, well-crafted little horror entry. If you are a true fan of horror films definately check this one out. This is especially true if you're a fan of ""old school"" Mario Bava, have seen the original Haunting of Hill House, and couldn't resist picking up Carnival of Souls for $8.00 at the DVD bin at the supermarket. This film pays attention to atmosphere like no film since the days of Mario Bava. In no other film since Hill House has the house itself truly become a character, and in no film since Carnival of Souls has a horror film more effectively straddled the line between surrealism and realism or kept you guessing throughout without frustrating you. Head Trauma is a successful fusion of  all these elements - Bavaesque atmosphere, Carnival of Souls real/surrealism, and with a ""prop"" that takes on a life of its own like Hill House.  But it's no rehash, Head Trauma is truly an original in its own right.

I would liken Head Trauma most to Carnival of Souls, the surreal no-budget early-60's cult classic made with a local cast of unknowns Like Carnival of Souls, Head Trauma displays a quality that belies its budget, displays shoestring resoucefulness in spades, and is more original and imaginative than the last ten major horror releases combined. I like Carnival of Souls - a lot. And I like Head Trauma for the same reasons. Both Head Trauma and Carnival of Souls are centered around loner types tormented by a demon figure. Both films are simultaneously waking dreams and a mystery. Both somehow successfully fuse experimental technique with realism. And both films use the media on which they were shot - grainy high speed low-contrast black and white film for Carnival of Souls, and in the case of Head Trauma, digital video, to their advantage. Also, both films feature excellent performances by skilled but unknown actors. At no point is the illusion broken by thinking ""poor Johnny Depp"". We know these people and the neighborhood they reside. No beauty queens, no dashing hunky stars, no cliched heros or villiams - real people, in a real setting, placed in an entirely believable context result in an illustion that absorbs without distraction, never asks for excessive latitude, nor ever slips into camp or unbelievability. Set against a highly believable ""everyday"" backdrop, the horror has far more impact than the ineffective excesses of uncreative, unoriginal, unbelievable, slasher films like those featuring recognizable professional wrestlers as villians. The time of Halloween rip-offs and cannibal zombie films has long since ended. It's high-time that a filmmaker with vision ala George Romano, ala John Carpenter, came along and breathed some life into this genre. And usually these films that re-invigorate horror come out of nowhere, and are shot on a shoestring. The pattern is they don't ""get their due"" upon release, but like any monster worth its salt(?), they never seem to die. Word of mouth spreads, and the hype they receive isn't ""hype"", rather, it's sincere praise that ""hype"" tries to mimic with million dollar PR campaigns. What I'm saying is Head Trauma is ""the real deal"". It's a film you ""tuck away"" for repeat viewings. Lend it to close friends who you're sure will give it back. A film you think about long after you've seen it. A film you revisit by replaying scenes in your mind, or by simply watching it again, outright.

Don't expect over-the-top excessive blood-letting and a huge body count. If  a big body count, excessive graphic gore, standard shock cuts, and over the top violence is your bag, look elsewhere. If you are interested in a literate script, a novel and believable concept, dream-like surrealism worthy of Carl Dreyer, unnerving and subtle sense of dread, a story that grabs you as well as any well-executed mystery, and a logical uncontrived truly suprising surprise ending that neatly and logically ties things up = resolves the mystery, but doesn't try to beat you over the head, then this is your film.

The only distraction is at times the media on which this was shot - digital video, betrays the excellent work of the cinematographer and director despite best efforts. Digital video just isn't ""there"" yet but it's improving, especially in skilled hands. That said, these few gaffes are more than compensated for by some rich, atmospheric, and truly brooding camera work and inspired ""cinematic"" direction. I've not seen a film shot on DV as cinematic as Head Trauma, much of the time its indistinguishable from film, and when it's not, it's usually not distracting. However there are gaffes at times that result in fleeting but jarring distractions that breaks the cinematic flow of the film. These few scenes stand out all the moreso due to the overall excellent production values and care put into this production.

As a horror fan who has endured his share of unwatchable dreck, it's nice to stumble upon a gem from time to time. This is one of those gems. And it's these unexpected gems that makes it worth the risk and the time.

Like Carnival of Souls, I expect this film will stand the test of time, develp its own cult following, and rise above the din to take its place among the more memorable entries in the genre.

Good show.",1160438400,9,5241,4.893018018018018

8139339,5,B000HEWER6,"Head Trauma--is entertaining with a great story.  With the budget the film maker had this is a well done film/ video;  moreover, if you like this movie look at Francis Ha and other work by the same Cinematographer , Sam Levy;  because of Francis Ha and Sam's help developing the look of the Noah Baumbach film I went back to see some of his earlier work with video.  This is a film for film makers along with Francis Ha.  Another film would be Tangerine (all shot on a tablet);  never let a lack of a tool stop you from telling your story.  Use the medium you have available and later you will find new opportunity--if needed.

8139341,4,B000HEWER6,"Head Trauma (Lance Weiler, 2006)

Head Trauma was the seventh movie I watched on February 15, 2013. (I love days when I get to work from home!) Previous to it, the highest rating any of those movies has gotten was a star and a half; my choices today turned out to be phenomenally bad. I was quite thankful this ended up breaking the streak; it's a fine, if flawed, little no-budget thriller that reminded me a great deal of Lodge Kerrigan's cult hit Clean, Shaven. Save that Head Trauma has a plot. And actors who can actually act. You know, little niceties like that that can make all the difference between something well-meaning but insufferable and something watchable that just misses the mark. And even that may be putting it too mildly here; Head Trauma does not necessarily miss said mark as much as dance around it, spitting occasionally and poking it with sticks, thumbing its nose at what Hollywood has conditioned average American audiences to expect from a movie. To continue that comparison from above, Clean, Shaven took much the same approach to filmmaking, I think, but Head Trauma, in my estimation, surpassed its churlish older brother by every metric I can come up with. Simply put, this is one hell of a little movie that far too few people saw.

Plot: George Walker (Vince Mola, in his only screen performance) is a socially-awkward, possibly mentally challenged, and previously homeless guy who comes back to the town where he grew up in order to settle his grandmother's estate and move into her house, which is now condemned by the city. When he gets there and goes into the house to set up camp, he starts looking around, and disturbs Julian (A Dangerous Place's Jamil A. C. Morgan), who's in the house hanging out. The two have an altercation that ends in George taking a header off the front porch. Julian hauls him home to be tended to by his grandmother Roberta (Meryl Lynn Brown, also in her only screen appearance to date), who knew George as a child, and the two of them spend some time catching up once George regains consciousness. Roberta orders Julian, in atonement for injuring George, to help him clean up the house, and the two of them form a tentative, unlikely bond. George also encounters Mary Sherman (Slice's Mary Monahan), an old crush from his high school years, and also needs to fend off the unwelcome attentions of Chester (Jim Sullivan, in another of the film's only screen appearance actors), who wants nothing more than for the city to come demolish the place, since it's lowering the neighborhood's property valuesoh, and who just happens to be Mary's ex. On top of all of the human drama, George becomes convinced the house is hauntedhe begins seeing things in the basement, which is currently flooded (and where Julian won't set foot, though whether that's because of the ghost or not wanting the spoil his trainers is left up to the viewer to decide).

Previous to the past half-decade, watching films on a repeat basis was a standard portion of my repertoire; I've seen probably a half-dozen films more than fifty times, and I know I have seen at least two over one hundred times (Scanners and Begotten). But in the past half-decade, I have watched only two films twice all the way through (I regularly skim films again while writing reviews, but I will only watch key scenes to fact-check). One of them is The Wicker Man. The other is Head Trauma. I originally rated it three stars, entered it in the document to be reviewed, and promptly lost it in the shuffle. I came upon it while trolling through the nether regions of said document, where the things to be reviewed are in chronological order, and realized how much this movie had continued to haunt me long after I had finished watching it; I sat down with it again almost a year to the day later. It validated everything I remembered about it and then some. Much of that has to do with Vince Mola's performance, which is entirely believable, if a little cringeworthy at times. (The cringeworthiness is a big part of the believability, which is somewhat unfortunate.) And whilewithout being spoilythe ultimate resolution to the mystery/horror end of the deal is stock, it is handled with care and sympathy not often found in big-budget mysteries, much less shoestring indie films.

I hadn't made this connection before, but Lance Weiler was half of the directorial team who made The Last Broadcast, the genesis of the found-footage film (in that it was the direct inspiration for The Blair Witch Project).  That Weiler (his co-director on TLB, Stefan Avalos, is now working as a camera guy on the horrifying TV series Toddlers and Tiaras, which is scarier than anything in any horror movie ever made) has turned out two movies this damn good and never done any other features is a crime against humanity. Here, especially, he took a cast of (mostly) non-actors and turned them into people who, when on a screen, can rival the best of Hollywood's B-list...and he made it seem effortless. The things about the movie that impressed me the second time around were much different than those that did the first; it was the relationship between George and Julian, so devoid of the stock Hollywood emotional shortcutsfor that matter, George's relationships with everyone in the film, really. The one time Weiler does use a stock emotional shortcut, it makes perfect sense. (It's the opening shot of the final sequencewithout bring too spoily, I hope, it's the shot where George is sitting on the curb, clutching an important article of clothing, warring with himself over the most important decision he has ever made.) Anddespite the fact that it hasn't been Weiler's stock in trade throughout the movie, he gets Mola to pull it off. That's talent, right there. Head Trauma is a movie far too few people have seen (373 votes on IMDB as of this writing), and it is one that has, or should have, enough broad appeal that it can be recommended to almost anyonehorror fans will find it a bit quiet, but should still like it; mystery fans will eat it up; romance fans are sure to empathize with either George or Mary; human-drama kids will love the way George and Julian's friendship blossoms. It's a movie that's got everything, and yet has, inexplicably, been seen by almost no one. If you get a chance (the movie is usually streamable on Netflix Instant), see it, and sooner rather than later. ****",1395878400,,6402,4.753597122302159
8139342,4,B000HEWER6,Good film. Trippy first time but it kept coming on cable and I rewatched it. Liked it!  So now years later it's all new!,1387929600,,120,4.0
8139343,4,B000HEWER6,"I enjoyed this because although the gimmick is old hat and the acting is just servicable, I just have a thing for spooky, atmospheric movies taking place in lonely, decaying locations. The classic, for me, is Session 9. This is not in that ballpark but I  watched this a couple years ago after first buying it and it has stuck with me. Watching it again as I type this, my only real objection is the shot-on-video look--I`ve just never been a fan of it. But this whole genre is basically one of variations, with the only original ingredients being the locations and the quality of the atmosphere. I can`t defend this as a great movie, but I believe the makers sincerely tried to create something moody, and they succeeded.",1359849600,,722,4.596899224806202

There are no real special effects to speak of, no blood-and-guts, and no ""flavor of the month"" monster/beast/killer...

While Head Trauma does not live up to the genius that was The Last Broadcast, it is an interesting and enigmatic psychological horror with great editing and creepy settings. While watching it, I definitely had a sinking feeling that I had seen something similar to it, and then I realized that it reminded me a lot of The Machinist starring Christian Bale. I believe The Machinist to be a superior film but those of you who were enthralled by Wieler's The Last Broadcast will enjoy the directing style and psychological mystery.",1196726400,,618,4.839622641509434

While the acting isn't oscar-worthy, the photography and lighting make up for it and deliver genuine chills somewhat similar to recent J-horror and classics of 70s and 80s.

Not the scariest, but definitely worth checking out.",1184803200,,500,5.060975609756097
