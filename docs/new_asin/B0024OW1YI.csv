8350835,1,B0024OW1YI,I rented this movie thinking i would get to see A MOVIE. However i was disappointed that what i rented was a movie back drop with the director narrating the full 1 and half of the movie. I rated this rental 1 star because i couldn't rate it lower. disappointed that Amazon did not provide customers with detailed information that this is a narrated copy of the movie. A waste in 2.99 i spent. I would think twice before i rent another movie again.,1283299200,,447,4.333333333333333
