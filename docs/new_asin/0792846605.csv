154410,3,0792846605,"Just how bad is ""C.H.O.M.P.S.""? It is sooooo bad it crosses that mythical line from Unwatchable to So-Bad-It's-Good by the end of the opening credits.
Sure, you may decide to rent ""C.H.O.M.P.S."" because you maybe remember catching it when you were a kid, or you may rent ""C.H.O.M.P.S."" to see Valerie Bertinelli in her ""One Day at a Time"" hey-day or Wesley Eure fresh from the set of ""Land of the Lost"", but the reason you will stick with this chunk of 70's cheese, is that it is so mind numbingly idiotic, you will become too fascinated to turn it off.
The basic storyline is that an inventor creates a robotic crime fighting dog. He works for a security firm run by Conrad Bain, and just happens to be dating the owner's daughter. Two inept criminals (Red Buttons, Chuck McCann) try to steal the invention for rival security company boss Jim Backus.
The hilarity begins with the inept criminals, followed by the grumpy mutt next door named ""Monster"" who makes ""witty"" comments throughout the film, and to top it off you get the wonderful 1970's special effects which are supposed to be amusing, but are downright creepy and terrifying. First the inventor basically decapitates the hapless puppy to demonstrate it's robotics, the vision of the dog's disembodied head resting on the inventor's table is pretty creepy. Add to that, whenever ""C.H.O.M.P.S"" receives a new command, his eyes light up with this demonic red glow giving him a nightmare inducing Dog-From-Hell appearance. Plus you get plenty of Slo-Mo running with Bionic Man sound effects!!
Top all of this off with a musical score created by Hanna-Barbera mainstay Hoyt Curtin, toss in some typical 70's cartoon sound effects, and you have one whopper of an awful film.
Seriously, if you love bad movies as I do, then ""C.H.O.M.P.S."" is a must see.",1243296000,4,1808,4.835483870967742

When Brian would take the dog's head off, I would scream out for my mom and then start to cry. The scenes where his eyes light up could scare little kids... Take it from me, I know...
I would advise parents to pre screen this before letting them see this movie. Seeing this film today still gives me the shakes! and I am now 30! Bed memories die hard....",990835200,8,450,3.956043956043956

  The next day, as Brian (Wesley Eure) goes to work at Norton Security Systems, two hoodlums (Red Buttons, Chuck McCann) show up in the office with Brian's friend, Casey (Valerie Bertinelli) holding her hostage. She also happens to be the daughter of the boss, Ralph Norton (Conrad Bain) whom is also in the office. They order Brian, Casey and Mr. Norton to hand over any money, watches and rings.
  The boss has had it and he fires Brian. casey tells his father that Brian was working on something special. However, she doesn't know what it is yet.
Later, Brian shows Casey (soon to be his wife) his new invention. A dog that looks like Rascal, but it's an electronic, mechanical, computerized watchdog.

Option of Language: English, Spanish.
Option of Subtitles: English, French, Spanish.

In-film advertising: Burger King, Chevron gas station, Coca-Cola, Ford, Wilson, 76 gas station.

If you want to get off the Rated G track, you can freeze-frame the cartoon missile, during opening credits, if you have a naughty mind.

2) Girlfriend and her father support him
3) His invention will save her dad's company
4) Bad guys want to steal his invention
5) All's well that ends well.

This movie inspired me to write some bad limericks, but about a mostly good movie.

There once was a CHOMPS of a dog,
who should throw his special effects in a bog,
The story was trite
and a little bit lite
But for this movie, I'll get off of my log

The special effects are obviously out of date.
The story is, at times, oblate
But it is a fun little movie.
To watch on your teevee,
And your kids, to bed, will be late.

Conrad Bain, perhaps best known as the dad on Diff'rent Strokes, also invites nostalgia.  This film falls squarely into the ""harmless family entertainment"" category, and kids who like dogs will especially like this film.  Parents who like kids who like dogs will tolerate it with minimal pain.",1364515200,2,457,5.053333333333334

He's also dating the daughter of the owner of the company.  The cast of the movie includes some fairly big names of the day (1979) Conrad Bain, Jim Backus, & Valarie Bertinelli are the most famous of the cast.  One thing that struck me as interesting is this movie was produced by Hanna Barbara.  I didn't know they made live action movies.  One more thing, I didn't watch this on Amazon Prime because it isn't a free movie and I object to paying an additional fee over what I have.
