2065446,5,B00027JYCQ,"Both our 4 yr. old and 8 yr. old LOVED this series! We thought the bees were most interesting, but the ants and butterflies were good too. Magic School Bus did their usual fantastic job of infiltrating lots of info into 3 distict and fun story lines too. GREAT!!!",1124841600,5,263,4.387755102040816
2065447,5,B00027JYCQ,"The previous reviewer summed up the stories on this DVD very well so I will only add that all of the MSB shows are great (especially when compared to what else is out there).

I started watching these with my children when they were two and four.  Sure they miss out on some of the finer scientific fine points, but I am *sure* that they are gaining a foundation in a variety of scientific topics.  Things that we can *build upon* later.

For example, I couldn't find my car keys and I asked my 5 year-old daughter if  she had seen them.  She then began gyrating around-much to my confusion.  When I asked her `what the heck ` she was doing, she answered that she was `dancing' out the directions to them the way that bees do.  LOL.

In any case, after watching this show, we go outside and 'dissect' some flowers.  Or we do something like grow beans in a glass cup so that what we have seen in the show is reinforced.

Five Stars.  Top notch Edu-tainment.",1121385600,16,956,4.279329608938547
2065448,5,B00027JYCQ,"My daughter, who is 5 yrs old and now wants to be an entomologist, loves this dvd!  IN A BEEHIVE taught her how the bees communicate and how honey is made.  In GETS ANTS IN ITS PANTS she found out about the life and WORK of an ant colony.  And in her favorite, BUTTERFLY AND THE BOG BEAST, she learned about camouflage for survival. The best part is that they put these three all on a DVD. The one complaint I have is that the episodes are not listed on Amazon in the description so I also ordered the vhs BUTTERFLY (its the same as on the dvd).",1117843200,49,545,4.027777777777778

2065484,5,B00027JYCQ,I love the magic school bus. It makes science fun for children. I highly recommend this dvd. We will be using it with our class on a lesson about butterflies. There wasn't as much about the metamorphosis as camouflage though.,1354838400,,225,4.65

Great thing to buy if you're trying to find some DVDs for an elementary school room.",1303084800,,301,4.788461538461538

2065502,5,B00027JYCQ,My 5-year-old loves this.  What a great learning tool--he's been spouting bug facts since.  My 2-year-old loves it too.  She's not a t.v. kid but this one keeps her rivited to the screen.  Never too young to learn!,1277856000,,214,4.552631578947368
2065503,5,B00027JYCQ,"My 5-year-old daughter loves the Magic School Bus series of DVDs. The shows are highly educational and I make a point of watching the DVDs with her so that we can discuss interesting topics. This DVD covers bugs, and contains three episodes:
""In a Beehive"" - Ms Frizzle and her class discover all about bees and how they make honey.
""Gets Ants in Its Pants""- the class discovers the life cycle of an ant and how industrious ants are
""Butterfly and the Bog Beast"" - how caterpillars change into butterflies

Ms Frizzle's learning principle ""Take chances, make mistakes and get messy"" is hilariously portrayed throughout the episodes. The language is pitched at the right level for young children, and my 5-year-old was able to follow the episodes without needing much clarification.

These shows make science appear fun and interesting, as it is, and encourages children to explore and learn new things. I highly recommend the Magic School Bus series to all children for their high educational value and their ability to make learning fun.",1275436800,16,1038,4.959770114942529

2065505,3,B00027JYCQ,"My kids, ages 5 and 6, enjoy this DVD which does a good job of mixing entertainment and learning.  My beef is that Miss Frizzle pronounces pupae and larvae as pyoo-pay and lar-vay, while dictionaries I've checked all say it should be a long ""e"" - pyoo-pee and lar-vee.  It's hard for readers of any age to pronounce scientific terms, and I think it's very important for kids to hear words correctly.  Magic School Bus let me down.",1260921600,3,430,4.487179487179487
2065506,5,B00027JYCQ,this was a great seller.... fast shipping and the product was exactly as described... thank you!!!!,1240358400,,99,5.25

2065508,5,B00027JYCQ,I know the age target is older but my son has loved this show since he first saw it when he was 4.  Can't get it on our cable anymore so ordered some of the DVDs.  We both love watching them and they are so educational.,1232236800,,219,3.739130434782609

2065578,5,B00027JYCQ,"My son (6 years old, diagnosed with autism) absolutely loves this series of dvds.  His thirst for both tv and knowledge is satisfied with this eclectic teacher, magic school bus, and well rounded group of kids.

As an adult, I enjoy the dvds.  They're interesting and educational - full of fascinating facts that you never knew.  Plus, Lily Tomlin is the perfect Ms. Frizzle.

These are well written and acted (voice) enough to keep children engrossed.  There is enough drama and humor throughout to keep it from ever feeling like they're being forced to learn something useful - but they are!

They're also excellent tools to open discussions about nature, bees, how caterpillars turn into butterfly's and they explain way better than I ever could.

Another added bonus for me personally is that my son has loads and loads of anxiety.  These informative dvds educate him about things such as bees and take the fear out.  He's not even afraid of spiders after watching ""creepy, crawly fun.""

I highly recommend for all children.",1204329600,3,1028,4.884393063583815
2065579,5,B00027JYCQ,"The Magaic School Bus series are a great way for children to learn many topics in science.  My children enjoyed ""Bugs, Bugs, Bugs"". I also found myself sitting down and enjoying this series.  This DVD would make a great addition to any childs video library..",1188172800,,258,4.711111111111111
2065580,5,B00027JYCQ,"I homeschool (unschool) my son, and the Magic School Bus series is GREAT for teaching kids science. We have 4 DVD sets and a few VHS's.

If you're unfamiliar with the premise, the central characters are Ms. Frizzle (a teacher), her class, Liz the lizard and the Bus. Ms. Frizzle takes her class on crazy field trips, where Bus--and sometimes the kids!--experience a transformation so they can get closer to the action. (For example, become a bee or turning into water droplets.)

One of our most recent purchases was Bugs, Bugs, Bugs! and it's excellent as always. These three episodes are:

*In a Beehive - Exploring bee behavior and a beehive

*Gets Ants in Its Pants - Learning about the industrial world of ants

*Butterfly and the Bog Beast - Metamorphosis from caterpillar to butterfly

There is also a few bonus features:

*Bug Challenges

*Find the Camouflage Butterflies

*Ant Olympics

This CD runs about 82 minutes and is supposedly geared towards children 3-8. Personally, I think the age-appropriate range is more like 6-10 because of the complex concepts introduced.

However, if younger kids enjoy it--more power to them! It certainly can't hurt to introduce science to younger kids if the Magic School Bus holds their interest.

My 8-year old son really enjoys the series now (he didn't get into it when he was younger), so I use the Magic School Bus series to supplement our learning/experimenting with science principles.",1181260800,12,1439,4.97489539748954
2065581,5,B00027JYCQ,The Magic School Bus books are true treasures.  They are fun and packed with great scientific information explained in a way that kids can really understand.  The shows are great adaptations of the books and the original story lines very good too.  My kids love the Magic School Bus and this video is no exception!,1169078400,,314,4.672727272727273
2065582,5,B00027JYCQ,"The Magic School Bus created some of the finest products for instruction, while completely disguising this fact to many of its young learners. Children exposed to the vast array of offerings in the field of science at young ages are still in possession of this information today. The original manner in which the students contribute information via their personalities and curiosity mix with our children's own natural instinctive curiosity about the world in which we live. Topics from this series include concepts as specific as mold and the manner in which it can help and hinder us, to as broad as the vast solar system, and systems beyond. Bugs, Bugs, Bugs is a title uniquely dedicated to the many insects and their many purposes common to our world. The only downside is that the series has apparently long been discontinued.",1155945600,4,832,4.95
