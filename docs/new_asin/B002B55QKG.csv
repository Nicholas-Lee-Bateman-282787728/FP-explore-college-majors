8360684,4,B002B55QKG,"When the Smoke Clears  is an interesting film warning younger people against drugs, but even more importantly
covering other aspects of drug dealers and their dangerous methods and criminal activities, indicating that even
innocent kids can get caught up in dangerous situations. This is surprisingly free of preaching regarding drug
usage.  Don't most of us know of the pitfalls?  Chris Carmack is in what has been said to be his first film.  He
is a standout among a very good cast. I don't know much of his subsequent activities.  I hope we'll be seeing more of him.",1453852800,,569,4.824742268041237
