8018377,2,B0001YJBIC,"This video teaches five tricks, that aren't the best, and sixteen different ways of doing those tricks. Two diffeerent tricks would be if the person's card would be in your shoe or your wallet. To me this is not worth the money.",1154563200,2,228,4.4523809523809526
8018378,2,B0001YJBIC,"I bought this DVD after ""Magic with everyday objetcs"" by the same author. That one was very good for beginners, but this card magic DVD is not good at all. Instead of explaining different ""card forces"", key cards and tricks, Magic Frank explains a couple of forces and then repeat them throughout the DVD. For instance, Card in Pocket, Outside Box, Card in Wallet, Card in Box, Card in Shoe, The Future is Back... are all THE SAME TRICK, but he just changes the place where the guessed card will be (shoe, box, envelope...). It is absurd and a waste of time. He could say it out loud (""you can put the card in a box, shoe or wherever you want"") instead of repeating the WHOLE trick over and over again. Sometimes I thought my DVD player was rewinding all the time.",1107734400,13,764,4.387323943661972
8018379,5,B0001YJBIC,"I have MagicFrank's other instructional titles on VHS, but I hope everyone will buy them on DVD.  These are great videos, and the ability to jump to the trick I want to do is extremely convenient, as I'm sure anyone who's watched any other magic video, where this is usually impossible, can tell you.  The tricks on this video are excellent--very easy to learn, but they still mystify anyone watching.  The video is good for not just kids, but adults as well.  I'm 24 years old and I still have fun learning how to do what's on this video and seeing peoples faces when the magic is revealed.  BUY THIS VIDEO--you won't be disappointed.",1090800000,6,635,4.535087719298246
8018380,5,B0001YJBIC,Magic Frank's videos are instructional yet easy for kids to follow. I think they help build a child's confidence. My nephew Will LOVES these DVD's - he was able to do several tricks (which were impressive ! Not store bought tricks) after watching these videos the 1st time. He watches them over and over.,1090195200,5,304,4.648148148148148
8018381,1,B0001YJBIC,"I should have picked up on this from the reviews, and the award from Kids First, but I didn't.  My low rating is for adults, or even older kids.  Other  reviewers liked it, so it might be fine for kids 8  or 9 and under,  but the card tricks are really lame for anyone else.  Be advised that this DVD is FOR KIDS ONLY.",1088380800,11,318,3.890625
8018382,5,B0001YJBIC,Wow - I thought MagicFrank's videos were great but this DVD is even better. This DVD makes learning card magic easy. Highly recommended.,1085097600,4,136,4.956521739130435
