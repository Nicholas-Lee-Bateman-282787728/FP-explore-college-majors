8730684,5,B014GCSYBY,A very good look at her and was nice to put her voice with her writings finally. Was interesting and not fast paced. Definetly dated and the camera work was not great but a nice glimpse into a small amount of Anais. Not much out there on her and it lets you feel like you understand her better.,1487289600,,294,4.086206896551724
8730685,5,B014GCSYBY,"The long out-of-print film finally available on DVD. Every Anais Nin fan out there can finally replace their old beat -up VHS copy of this classic, intimate portrait of the famous diarist, author, poet, and icon, with a made-to-order DVD-R. Now they need to do the same thing for the long out-of-print Sylvia Plath documentary and the other great Voices and Visions series documentaries that have NEVER been upgraded from VHS. A must have, must see film, for fans of Anais Nin and fans of literature in general. Buy Your Copy Now!",1464307200,2,530,4.771739130434782
