8635480,5,B00HSJ2AMW,"Now to do this film justice you have to give away some of the plot, but let's not quite yet.  Our film starts out in a very windswept dusty village as the Japanese conquerers move through and follows the lives of eight Chinese bandits who are more interested in robbing from the rich than fighting the Japanese.  Enter our hero whose one goal is to capture a high ranking Japanese official (the brother of the Emperor).  Told in flashback these characters are introduced and we get to see their interactions with each other and how our ""hero"" gets them to do things his way even though their ""boss"" is hardly ever in agreement.  Lots of action and even some romance ensue and it is well worth the choking dust to follow this film to its conclusion.",1401667200,3,748,4.477941176470588
