7863968,4,630417957X,"Plot:  A Federation colony is destroyed, and a Bajoran militant group claims responsibility.  The Enterprise meets up with Adm. Kennelly, who orders them to track down Orta (the leader of the group) and stop him from doing it again.  He also sends Ensign Ro Laren (who has a history of disobediance that cost the lives of some crewmembers from the USS Wellington), much to the discomfort of the entire crew.  When they finally meet Orta, he claims that he never attacked the colony.  This is rather interesting, but since Ro nearly jeopardized the mission by going alone to meet Orta without anyone's knowledge (and everyone having to follow her afterward), Capt. Picard confines her to quarters.  Ro realizes that she is going to have to tell the captain something that she didn't originally.

An excellent episode and it's really interesting seeing how both the captain and Ro butt heads at times.

As far as the parallel thing that someone said that the Federation=USA, Cardassians=Israel, and Bajorans=Palestinians, I really don't think this was the point of the episode (another reviewer says that Rick Berman said that the Bajorans don't represent any group from today), so I recommend not reading into it and coming up with an interpretation.

Great episode with a solid 4 stars.",1157500800,,1286,5.0

Star Trek producer Rick Berman, explained that the Bajorans were not modelled on any particular group: `The Kurds, the Palestinians, the Jews in the 1940s, the boat people from Haiti-unfortunately, the homeless and terrorism are problems in every age' (TNG Companion, p. 178).",1105401600,,381,5.4576271186440675
