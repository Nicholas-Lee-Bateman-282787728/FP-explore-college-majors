8167171,3,B000M8IM5U,I have never seen it and I am in it.  This copy was in a circulating library.  It is in fair condition  It is really note good movie.  There were too many amateurs both acting and filming.,1361059200,,188,4.0
8167172,1,B000M8IM5U,"This movie gives ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" a run for its money as the worst movie ever made. The script is perfunctory and disjointed. Few of the important plot points are explained well enough to make sense of the story, and the editing is simply incoherent. The acting is listless and uninspired, and one of the stars, Aldo Ray appears to have been intoxicated throughout much of the film. Stuart Whitman, in his role as ""Smithy"" is the only actor who delivers his lines with any conviction. The others merely look embarrassed. I've been looking for this movie for years as I was in it (as an extra) but had never seen it. I heard it was never released in the United States, went straight to video a few years later and sank out of sight. I found this copy on Amazon. There may be more, in case anyone wants to buy them all up and burn them.",1358208000,,843,4.3081761006289305
