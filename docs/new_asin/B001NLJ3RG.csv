3719611,3,B001NLJ3RG,"My son kept saying ""Where's the one with the bugs?"" as we watched all four episodes boxed in the package called ""The Bug Club.""  We bought the DVD because we thought a show with ""Science"" in the name that's subtitled ""The Bug Club"" would contain at least one show devoted entirely to profiling a bunch of cool bugs.  (Bring on the dung beetles and water striders!) Sorry, no.

Toddlers and preschoolers love nature.  They are too young to be jaded and will soak up pretty much any factual material that is simply presented.  According to this show, children won't be interested in nature unless it's accompanied by: - small-child characters shaking their hips, street-rhyming and playing air guitar (this section goes on endlessly and is repeated in each show);  - Sid pulling out a gigantic, media-style microphone, leaning in sideways and popping the mike into his friends' faces when asking them a question; - the kids yukking it up with Laugh-In style jokes that might graze the show's theme at best; - the teacher belting out a number.  Possibly the Mickey Mouse Club was the creators' inspiration.  The entertainment-TV inspired parts of the shows take up a lot of time and are not as interesting as the science parts, and unfortunately also seem to be saying (to the small child watching) that it's just as important to behave like you're on TV as it is to be interested in science.

The show has some undeniable good points -- the family is amusing (if somewhat idealized) and has great values, there is a good attitude about learning, the scientific topics are well chosen even if very lightly presented, there is a positive presentation of school routine, and small kids like the jokes.

ps -- The computer-animated Claymation gives the kids mouths without upper lips that are kind of creepy-looking in motion.  This might bother the very young viewer.",1265414400,10,1862,4.842271293375394
3719612,5,B001NLJ3RG,"My son really likes the ""Sid the Science Kid"" series on PBS, and these DVDs appear to be those PBS shows on DVD.  So far i have 3 of the DVDs and have pre-ordered ""Weather Kid Sid"" due out in the summer.",1263513600,,203,3.8333333333333335
3719613,4,B001NLJ3RG,"I love this show, and the show itself gets 5 stars. It's a great science teaching tool for kids under ~5. My kids love the information and the songs. The format of the show has just enough structure, with transition songs and the right amount of new information for them to learn. The repeated songs are catchy, as are Teacher Susie's clever songs, which are different each show.

Additionally, the characters are all respectful to each other. The kids are respectful of parents, teachers and each other. The adults are respectful of the kids, too, treating them as smart people with important ideas. It's relatively unusual to see a kid in a kid's show interacting with his parents at all. I love that Sid has two parents, who are both supportive, and the dad is not a stereotypical dolt like so many dads on TV. He is sometimes a little goofy for comic relief, but the mom also has a few goofy moments, so it really doesn't come off that the dad is a dolt while everyone else is brilliant. The show makes a point of stating how cool his mom and grandma are, and Sid frequently says how cool his dad is.

So why only 4 stars for this product? The main Sid the Science Kid DVD has four weekday shows. Our PBS station shows those Monday through Thursday, but there is a summary show on Friday. The summary show is not included on this DVD. I'm not sure why not. (Maybe they plan to sell them separately at some point in the future?)

Also, I paid a little extra to get the Front Row Fun DVD for both the Change Happens and the Bug Club DVDs, but the content is identical. I had been hoping to get a different Front Row Fun DVD with each Sid DVD. Front Row Fun contents:

Sid the Science Kid (Charts)
Will & Dewitt
Pocoyo
Word World (one 12 minute episode, not a whole show)
Dive Olly Dive
Animal Atlas
Tiny Planets
Hurray for Huckle
Hopla
Hermie and Friends

Only Sid, Word World and Hermie seemed to hold my kids' attention (ages 2 and 3), but they are familiar with the first two from our PBS station and with Hermie from the books.",1262476800,2,2033,4.339473684210526
3719614,5,B001NLJ3RG,Great buy!  We recently had a 17 hour flight to Europe with our 1 year old and it kept her interested and happy for awhile.  She loves the songs and watching the kids.  I love that it teaches kids to ask questions and love learning.,1257552000,,232,4.111111111111111

3719616,5,B001NLJ3RG,"We ordered this DVD hoping that our 24 month old would watch it during a 4 hour plane flight.  It was ordered a couple of days before, so we played it for him prior to the trip to see if he'd like it.  He loved it, and is still asking to watch it every day 30 days after we received the DVD.  The music on this DVD makes it fun to sing along with, and there is always a lesson to be learned.",1255564800,7,391,3.6867469879518073

3719618,5,B001NLJ3RG,"My 3 year old boy and 5 year old daughter enjoy Sid the Science Kid on PBS.  So when the new collection of Sid episodes was released, we scooped The Bug Club up along with it's companion collection Things Change.  My kids preferred the companion collection more than The Bug Club, to my surprise.

This DVD contains the episodes Hello Doggie, Home Tweet Home, The Dirt on Dirt, and Don't Forget the Leaves,

When Sid hears dogs barking in his neighborhood, he wonders if they're talking to him.  At school, Sid discovers that animals do communicate in lost of different ways, by using body language, making sounds, and barking! Woof!  It's the latest question in a long list of questions that Sid finds himself wondering about.  For example, what makes dirt so dirty?  Why do bees live in hives and ants live in anthills?  Do leaves actually do anything?  Come explore backyard science with Sid in these super duper episodes that feature bugs, nature, animals and more.  This DVD is close to two hours long ( 115 min).

If you hurry (for a limited time) you will get an additional DVD called Front Row Fun which contains another episode of Sid ( Why do we need Charts), as well as episodes of WordWorld, Dive Olly Dive!, Hurray for Huckle!, Tiny Planets, Will and Dewitt, Animal Atlas, Hermia and Friends, Pocoyo and Hopla.  This DVD runs over two hours (134 minutes) and makes for a total of 4 hours of content for a really decent price.

The only problem with the extra DVD is that if you buy the companion collection of Sid the Science Kid (Things Change), the extra Front Row DVD has  exactly the same content.  In other words all the extra Front Row DVDs in the Sid collections have the same content.  I was expecting each of the extra Front Row DVDs to have different content on it, and was disappointed that the disks contain the same shows, so we have both of the just released Sid the Science Kid collections (Change Happens, and The Bug Club) but two extra Front Row Disks containing the exact same content.

Still, a solid purchase for the price, 4 hours of great entertainment for the kids.",1247961600,17,2102,4.56
3719619,3,B001NLJ3RG,"My 4 year old son watched it over and over again, causing me to rent it an extra day because he enjoyed it so much. The songs are catchy and cute, and the parents on the program really take care in making Sid feel great for being as curious as he is. We aren't big fans of tv in our home, but this program definitely gets high marks from us!

Edit 4/21/15: While the program is still ok, I don't find it nearly as tolerable as I did several years ago. Since we are still a limited tv household, there are far better programs out there for young children. We do still choose PBS shows over others, but prefers shows like Dinosaur Train and Daniel Tiger - my then 4 year old isn't as interested in any of these programs, obviously, but my 3 year old loves them all. He hasn't caught on to Sid the Science Kid on the PBS kids app, nor do I expect him to.",1247529600,2,851,4.035502958579881

Sid lives in a world where daycare has just four tykes and stupendous facilities. His Dad appears to be some sort of laborer but has a beautiful house with an impeccably manicured lawn and garden.

3719657,1,B001NLJ3RG,"Not a fan of this, even though there are a lot of people out there who are. I just don't get it. Pretty much everything JHC has done has been brilliant... until this.

One of the things I dislike about this show is how Sid talks like someone with a developmental disorder. I know there will be overly sensitive people out there who will call me ""rude"", ""insensitive"", whatever, but that's really what it sounds like to me, folks. I really put my foot down when my toddler, who had very well developed verbal skills, started talking like Sid, with the stutters and inflections, and all - just like Sid. Made me cringe. So, yes, IMO the vocal talent is terrible.

The animation is probably the worst part of the show, however (once again, IMO). Remember when JHC pioneered in puppetry? Long before the days of incessant CGI, we had one lonely crusader in Hollywood who kept the torch lit brightly on how to make live-action characters, instead of falling back on cheap computer graphics. I was floored when I realized this was JHC. Without knowing what's going on, it seems to me the current owners of JHC are merely cashing in on the companies name while putting out sub-par product that pales in comparison to the creative genius it used to be.

Once again, that's just MY opinion folks. Don't get all bent out of shape over it! I know there are many rabid die-hard Sid fans out there who can't help picking fights with people who have anything bad to say about this show. But you need to get over it. Maybe you should all watch the episode about respecting other people's opinions, eh?",1356048000,,1586,4.538461538461538
