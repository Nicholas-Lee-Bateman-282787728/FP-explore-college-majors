3856896,5,B0026S2TU8,"This movie truly captures the struggles of growing up with Tourette's. It begins from a child's point of view, and progresses to the challenges of getting an interview and then a job, explaining the disability to other professionals and friends, and becoming successful in life. I cried through the whole thing because as a mother it made me realize what challenges lie ahead for my son if this condition does not go away.",1253750400,4,422,4.794520547945205
3856897,5,B0026S2TU8,"For anyone who has a disability or loves someone who does, this movie will lift your spirits. Told in retrospect, early flashbacks of teasing peers and insensitive teachers are heartwrenching. Even his father couldn't see beyond the disability to the boy who needed his love. But the constant encouragement of a mother who refused to give up on her son and the support (finally) of an educator who believed in him, lead him to believe in himself. His quest to become a teacher is not an easy one, but he doesn't quit trying, motivated by a desire to help kids like himself, as a school principal had finally helped him.
Terrific acting and an ending that makes you want to stand up and cheer!",1251417600,,692,4.588709677419355
3856898,5,B0026S2TU8,"If you are a teacher or who know of one,then I heartily recommend this. Quite a touching movie of Jeff Cohen in his quest to be a teacher. You will have to admire the courage of this man who wanted to be an educator. He persevered in the end. Anyone with disabilities can succeed. I loved this movie...hope you will too!",1250294400,5,320,4.262295081967213

3856900,5,B0026S2TU8,"This movie is one of the few that are worth showing to prospective teachers.  It is inspiring to those with ""disabilities"", those who deal with training kids, and those who wish to become teachers.
As a teacher involved with the Teachers for Tomorrow program, I can't wait to show this to my students.  It really shows that students can overcome their disabilities and become whatever they have the drive to be.  I am also planning to show it to my Psychology students as a way of looking at abnormal psych and how it should (and should not) be addressed.

As for the movie itself, it is done extremely well.  It doesn't condescend or preach, but it does deliver a message.  The acting was very good.  I really couldn't find any fault with it.  Patricia Heaton does a terrific job of portraying his mother (for those of us that only know her from Everybody Loves Raymond - who knew she could do a lead drama??)

I can heartily recommend this movie without reservations.  Hallmark definitely hit a homerun with this movie.",1243036800,21,1021,4.622222222222222
3856901,5,B0026S2TU8,"Brad Cohen had TS since he was a child. At school, he would make a noise, and the teacher would think he did it intentionally to disrupt the class. When in junior high, Cohen had poor peer relations.

As an adult, Cohen wanted very much to be a teacher. But no administrator would hire him. After much, much trying, traveling all over creation, Cohen was finally hired as a second-grade teacher. But that was only half the battle. Some kids made fun of him, and one parent pulled her child out of his class because she wanted a ""normal"" teacher for her child. Cohen had to lay down the law. While friendly with children, he had to prove that he was an authority figure, not a buddy.

In time, Cohen more than exceeded expectations. First the children, and then everybody else, loved him. As a teacher with TS myself, I found this movie (and book) quite inspiring. Never let anything stop your dreams. The challenge of dealing with a disability can be surpassed by the challenge of dealing with how others treat you because of their perceptions of your disability, and the challenge of convincing adults that your disability doesn't define you can be more difficult than convincing children of the same.",1241654400,40,1202,4.665094339622642
3856905,5,B0026S2TU8,"This Hallmark Hall of Fame Movie, ""Front of the Class,"" is acting at it's very best.... telling a story with truth and honesty that moves people. Watching it makes you appreciate life, your fellow mankind, and other's daily struggles and obstacles, even more. This movie inspires you to reach for your dreams and let nothing stand in your way!

As for the actors... James Wolk's ability to act as someone with Tourette's syndrome was incredible. He was awe-inspiring in this role, the underdog type you cheer for to succeed and cry for - when they don't and when they do!!! Dominic Scott Kay (""Single Santa Seeks Mrs. Claus"" and ""Meet the Santas"") is absolutely phenomenal as the young Brad Cohen, giving such expression and depth of emotion to his character. The casting of these two- James & Dominic, as the younger and older Brad, is spot on perfection!

Patricia Heaton and Treat Williams portray Brad's parents in ""Front of the Class.""  Of course, most of us know Patricia from the comedy sitcoms ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" and ""The Middle"" and Treat, from the television dramas ""Everwood"" and ""Chesapeake Shores."" They both added a maturity of acting and experience to the drama, which made the story, though I knew both of them from previous roles, still seem so real!

 Thank you Hallmark... and, yes... you will need tissues... but in a Happy Way! Beautifully Touching and Inspiring! An Unforgettable Must See!!!",1505692800,,1420,4.924686192468619

So many blind people just use the system and take money from tax payers, and let others dictate their lives. Brad didn't let people do that to him, and I certainly won't let others do it to me.

This movie is really inspirational. While I may not suffer with what Brad does, I still understand the struggles he has had to deal with in his life. I've been different, struggled with the dating aspects of life, and have had people say and be unkind to me. But if Brad can do it, then so can I.",1443916800,,663,4.0227272727272725

3856980,5,B0026S2TU8,"""Front of the Class is is a movie based on a true Story. It is about a boy named Brad who has a problem, but doesn't have a name for it. He gets in trouble a lot for yelping like a dog in class or tapping his leg against the chair. His mother takes him to multiple doctors, but none can figure out what it truly is. They said he just would have to be disciplined and learn self control. Finally, his mother decides to take matters into her own hands and find out what is wrong with her son. She discovers a book in the library that describes what Tourette syndrome is and it matches exactly what he son has been doing. She shows the doctor and Brad gets diagnosed with Tourette syndrome. Finally teachers and students start to understand once his problem has a name. Brad goes on to school to become a teacher, but everyone thinks he should reconsider due to his syndrome. His amazing attitude doesn't let it get to him though. Right out of school he goes to a ton of interviews that all turn him away because they say his ticks will be too distracting for students. Finally he gets a call from one of the last schools he got interviewed at, and gets the job. Once he explains to his students why he makes weird noises and tells them what it is called they learn to ignore it, and they love him as a teacher. He goes on to win the award for best teacher as well. This movie will help to show you that no mater what types of problems you face, you can get through them.

It is about his struggle to find a job, his difficult childhood, and how he doesn't let Tourette's win.  This movie was very inspiring to me because I have a cousin who has Tourette's and I've seen how difficult it has made his life. I loved Brad's attitude and philosophy of teaching. Brad thought the most important thing to teach his students was that it was ok to be different. I also loved how he handled one of the kids in his class, Thomas. Thomas was a troubled child who had ADD, ADHD, and OCD. The other teachers said it would be smart for Brad to pass him off to Special Ed. but he didn't give up. Brad handled him by giving him detention one day after he left the class without permission. By giving him detention he was given the chance to connect to Thomas and help him see that learning was easy. I highly encourage this movie to anyone who wants an inspiring story, but also to teachers who want to give up.

Maybe if everyone realized it was a disease their attitudes would change when they came across someone having a tic and feel sorry for them rather than making fun of them.

(The Miracle Worker, A Patch of Blue, Temple Grandin, etc.) I find something very endearing about them--I always leave thinking ""What I take for granted. What have I to complain about?""

However, Front of the Class didn't do anything for me. The pacing has all the dramatic arc and tension of a soaked paper towel. I kept waiting for that climatic, triumphant moment when Brad Cohen finally got the job as a teacher. When he got it, the music swelled and he walked in the classroom smiling awaiting his students. I thought ""Okay. Now their going to wrap it up."" But NNNNOOOOO. Instead we get a tedious, meandering, twenty minute soap opera with the family/girlfriend/a couple students and their families.

I thought the acting was reasonably good although nothing outstanding--maybe it's the script--there doesn't seem to be any chops or scenarios for the actors to show off how well they can act.

Taken as a whole, Front of the Class isn't a bad film--it just needed to end at eighty minutes instead of ninety.",1374537600,,1120,4.822916666666667

Back in my day teachers were the next thing to parents.  If I went home with a note from my teacher I knew I was in trouble.  Today, parents could care less about teachers and what they are asked to do.

3857103,5,B0026S2TU8,"When a movie is based on a true story, that's a plus right away for me. I love learning about the challenges others have overcome and the ways real individuals have blessed the people around them. Front of the Class is one of my favorite true-life movies, following a gifted man named Brad Cohen.

If you're unfamiliar with Tourette's syndrome, Front of the Class is an excellent look into the life of someone who fought it. Forced to cope with Tourette's from a very young age, Brad is judged and ridiculed by friends and even family, who don't understand his problem and assume he suffers from nothing more than lack of self control and bad manners. Backed only by the support and unconditional love of his mother, Brad himself doesn't know why he frequently loses control of his tongue and emits strange sounds. The more frustrated he grows with the problem, the worse his uncontrollable outbursts of noises become.

Finally at age eleven, due to his mother's persistence, Brad meets a doctor who diagnoses him with Tourette's. Although it is a relief to finally have an explanation, that doctor's visit is just the beginning of Brad's journey. Filled with the desire to become a teacher, Brad quickly discovers that his condition will be too much for many school boards to accept.

Front of the Class follows Brad as he works through a series of crushing disappointments, encounters overwhelming obstacles, and meets a girl who he can only hope will be able to look past his distracting condition. Whether or not his dream of teaching comes true, you'll find him to be a one-of-a-kind man with a big heart and incredible determination, regardless of what the world thinks.

Brad's story as portrayed by this film teaches the principles of perseverance, diligence, resilience, love, and forgiveness. It's also a very helpful tool in empathizing with those who suffer from Tourette's, or have family who does. I highly recommend this inspiring story.

Note that many people who suffer from Tourette's spout off foul language; Brad's outbursts are merely noises and are completely clean.

Recommended viewing age: all ages, with parental guidance for those under twelve",1341964800,,2170,4.980662983425415
3857104,5,B0026S2TU8,This is an excellent movie.  I showed it to my students and they loved it.  It provides an excellent lesson on respecting others who may be different in any way.  I would strongly recommend this movie to anyone!,1339113600,,211,4.5

3857106,5,B0026S2TU8,This movie Front of the Class is about a boy named Brad (Jimmy Wolk) who makes funny noises.  While growing up Brad stared making funny noises at the time.  In grade school the students made fun of Brad because of his noises.  Brad's mother (Patricia Heaton) was the only person in his life who understands that he can not control his noises.  His mother starts researching to find some answers about his noises.  His dad (Treat Williams) is not supportive of his son's noises.  When Brad is 12 years old his mom finally finds out Brad has Tourette Syndrome.  Brad dreams of being a teacher.  Because of his Tourette's Brad goes on alot of job interviews. After a long road Brad finds a job as a 2nd teacher.  After getting the teaching job Brad meets a woman named Nancy (Sarah Drew).  Watch this movie to see what happens to Brad.,1335571200,,832,4.486666666666666
3857107,5,B0026S2TU8,"Brad Cohen has had Tourette's Syndrome since he was six years old. He grew up with no friends and endured constant name calling because of his disability from his peers, until a principal cared enough to educate his school during a school musical performance. That day things turned around for Brad and people started helping him cope with his disability better. He fell in love with being in Georgia when he was a camp counselor. He tried constantly to find a job in Georgia to match his heart's desire of teaching; he was rejected a lot but kept moving forward trying to find a place where he could be accepted and make a difference in the lives of the students. This story flips back and forth between little Brad and big Brad.

This is a long awaited review for me and I'm glad I finally got this DVD in my hands. I really wish a copy of this DVD or the book that this DVD is about could be in everybody's household and in all schools at some point. It will educate people about Tourette's Syndrome so that people could learn to help people with the disability to become more accepted in our world.",1334966400,,1102,4.401960784313726

Something which wasn't successfully diagnosed until after he had suffered years of taunts and mistreatment at the hands of classmates, school officials, and even at home.  Nonetheless, due to an insightful Principal he is inspired to become a teacher and he is determined not to let Tourette's win.  The movie focuses on his determination to fulfill his dream and the many hurdles he has to overcome in order to do so.  I was especially impressed by how natural both actors who portray Brad Cohen are with their impersonation of Tourette's.  One would never dream they were acting, the way they do it so fluidly.  The movie is typical of Hallmark films in that they aren't action movies per say, but nonetheless well done and inspiring.  We enjoyed this movie very much at home.",1327449600,,893,4.759740259740259

He is open with his students about his condition and they grow to love him despite his disorder, and he teaches his class that ""It's OK to color outside the lines.""

A few comments on the content - two kisses between a couple in a committed relationship but no implied or explicit sex, no rough language, a respectful interaction between parent and adult child, and some less redemptive arguments between parents and their young son (before he is diagnosed with a known condition).

I don't think there is another life story that has moved me as much as that of Brad Cohen.  I remember very vividly when I first heard his name.  It was a few years ago.  I had just gotten home from work and I was getting ready to meet my wife for dinner.  I had switched on the television for some noise while I got dressed and Oprah happened to be on.  Her guest that day was Brad Cohen and I found myself sitting on the couch in tears while I listened to his story.  In fact, I was so moved by his strength and determination that I went to his website, got his email, and sent him an email telling him how much he encouraged and inspired me.

I've never EVER done anything like that before, and I don't think I ever will again.

So, when I saw that this film had been made and that it was going to be playing on television I instantly set my DVR.  I had no idea that this came out in 2008 (I just saw it this past weekend), but if I had known I would have seen it earlier.  I knew going in that it was a Hallmark film, so I had a feeling that it wouldn't really do him justice (Hollywood take note, this story needs to be told on the big screen with a real grit and realism, PLEASE!), but I was excited nonetheless.

Now, I'll get to my feelings on the film.

The first thing I noticed was the narration.  I wasn't a fan.  The narration of a film can make or break it really, and it only works some of the time.  I think the best use of protagonist narration I've seen in recent films was in `About Schmidt', but that is really the exception, not the rule.  Narration is unnecessary and distracting, and in some cases even corny.

I could see `upbeat inspiration' written all over this film, which for me was kind of overdone.  I really applaud Cohen for his outlook on life and the way he has been able to become such a positive role model for so many, but when telling a story of this nature their needs to be a sense of dramatic tension.  I didn't really find that here.  I could see they were trying in some areas (Cohen's breakdown in the car was especially effective, but that was one of those moments I also remembered from his Oprah interview and so I was already emotionally attached to that moment), but overall it seemed to miss the boat there.

The acting was VERY hit and miss, and I blame a lot of this on the script as well, which was so cookie cutter `screenwriting 101' that it gave me a headache in areas.  Jimmy Wolk handles every tick and noise with so much authentic realism you never doubt for a moment that he has Tourette's.  My issue with his performance comes from the overuse of the ticks and noises (he does them every 3 seconds almost and it comes off as not only distracting but unrealistic) and the fact that he has to muddle through some cringe worthy dialog and situations.  The whole father/son side plot to the film is horribly written and acted.  His relationship with his father comes across as nothing but a stereotype, with no real emotion or realism and the confrontations and fights they have about work especially come over as cheesy and unnatural.  Treat Williams has some nice moments, especially with Dominic Scott Kay, but in the later scenes with Wolk he suffers from the same choppy dialog.  Patricia Heaton is not a dramatic actress, and it shows.  She is, by far, worst here and just cringe worthy, soap opera fake in moments.  I really thought that Sarah Drew was luminescent and just so endearing as Nancy, the girl who steals Brad's heart.  She is so natural, and she truly brings out the best in Wolk, who shines when sharing the screen with her.

The overall feel of this film is far too `made for television' for my taste.  It feels cheep in scenes and just kind of cheesy.  I hate saying this.  I wanted to just rave this film.  I even told my wife that it felt like I was watching a bad sitcom at times.

In the end I really love this story, but I felt that the film was a missed opportunity.  I'm very happy that Cohen's story has been told and I hope that many more people see this film, read his book and get inspired by his story.  I just also hope and pray that this story is told on the big screen with a capable script so that we can really EXPERIENCE the power of Cohen's inspirational message.

BTW, this film still made me cry (I'm such a softy), so I guess that means that it still is moving!",1265587200,10,4452,4.1978798586572434
3857146,5,B0026S2TU8,"Unlike most of the other people that have reviewed this movie, I do not have Tourettes, know someone who has it, and I am not a teacher.  Like everyone else, I absolutely adored this movie.  I watched it for the first time last year when it first aired on CBS, and I watched it again a little while ago.  It is truly an uplifting movie, and the fact that it is based on a true story makes it even better.",1265414400,8,404,4.025
3857147,5,B0026S2TU8,"A dear friend told me two days ago that this movie was going to be on TV tonight (6 Feb 10), so I knew that I had to watch it--and I'm very glad that I did. A few times, I cried because I have been plagued with Tourette Syndrome (TS) since about 1953, when I was eight years old. Perhaps many people will be able to gain some understanding about TS from this extremely well done movie. We are not freaks; we just have a disability over which we have no control, and for which medical science has not yet been able to develop a cure. I greatly admire Mr. Cohen for his optimism and perseverance, despite all the obstacles he had to face over the years. Many people would likely have just given up. Yet he turned what may seem to have been a liability into a powerful tool to help him become an overcomer and, more importantly, a super achiever.

Interestingly, I wanted to be a teacher myself from the time I was about 15, so I finally had an opportunity to be one in the Air Force for two years (1980-1982). Regrettably, there is no doubt in my mind that TS had an adverse impact on my performance. It wasn't until about 1981 or 1982 that I even became aware that there was a name for what I had. While that in and of itself did not help alleviate my condition, I at least knew something about it and came to realize that I wasn't alone.

If you have TS or know someone who does, this movie should have a very profound and positive impact on you. Even if you do not or do not know anyone with TS and have a chance to see it, I urge you to do so. It is well worth the time--as, I should add, is true with all Hallmark movies. ><>",1265414400,8,1628,4.068535825545172

3857149,5,B0026S2TU8,"""Front of the Class"" may be one of the first to explain the curious trauma of Tourette Syndrome. Years ago I saw a crime drama on TV (I forget which one) about a teenager who loved movies, but his uncontrollable yelps, etc., ruined the movie for a bunch of bullies, who subsequently beat him to death. Ignorance and confusion will always affect those with Tourettes, as well as those who encounter such people. I have always been plagued by Tourettes, in a very mild form. I've always been a confident person, ready to handle most things, including performing on-stage. My college days, my early 20's, somehow brought out the worst of it, with the twitches and yelps. (This was back in the early 70's). People can be so cruel. ""Front of the Class"" must be the penultimate film ever to not only reveal the torment of Tourettes, but to explain the differences between the many varying forms of this ""syndrome"". My own problem has somewhat dissipated, with rare, minor re-occurances. Still, I can't forget the cruelty to which I was subjected, and other people's comments about those with Tourettes who shout random obscenities, and scream, etc. ""Front of the Class"" explains that those are ""forms"" of Tourettes that do not affect all ""victims"". Kudos to Hallmark and the amazing actor, Jimmy Wolk, for a courageous, all-out performance of commitment and sensitivity. The film is unforgettable in its sincerity, honesty and life-affirming message. Recommended to ALL.

UPDATE: Unknown to me, Jimmy Wolk does NOT have TS, a testament to his acting talent; reminiscent of di Caprio in ""Gilbert Grape"".

8353554,5,B0026S2TU8,"Front of the Class is a true story based on the life of Brad Cohen. This film begins with an adolescence Brad who is judged by family, peers, and professionals who seem to believe that he is an attention seeking, out of control, troublemaker who makes strange sounds. Brad, himself, doesnt understand the cause of his involuntary outbursts, but soon realizes that they become more frequent when he is frustrated, feels unaccepted, or under stress. With the help and support of his persistent mother, Brad meets a doctor who diagnoses him with Tourettes.  Although it is a relief to finally have an explanation, that doctor's visit is just the beginning of Brad's journey. Brad continues his education with hopes of becoming the teacher he never had growing up. This film depicts the struggles and obstacles that Brad must endure on his journey to become employed as a teacher. Fresh out of college, Brad must overcome overwhelming job interviews, lack of acceptance from his father, and a nonexistent love-life, but it isn't enough to deplete his amazing attitude. Brad eventually lands the job of his dreams at Mountain View Elementary School and is on a mention to prove that Tourettes has shaped him to become the perfect teacher. With things improving in Brads life, he also manages dating Nancy (who he later marries). After only one year of teaching, Brad was name Georgias First Class Teacher of the Year. He serves as an inspiration to all throughout his journey for not letting his Tourettes win or be the reason that he doesnt shoot for his dreams.",1522627200,,1558,4.879245283018868
