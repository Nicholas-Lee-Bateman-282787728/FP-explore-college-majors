8354680,1,B0027FG1MC,"Good effort and good intentions. However the quality is pretty bad, VERY amateur-ish. That wouldn't be a big deal, the problem is the fact that I paid for this. It would have been fine if it was a free video to watch. It wasn't worth paying any amount of money for.",1481500800,,265,4.215686274509804
8354681,5,B0027FG1MC,"Exceptional informational video about not just the I&M Canal, but it's surrounding locale coupled with a historical jaunt. This video traverses time as though you went back in time to visit the canal through history.

Very well done by a local citizen wanting to do this bit of local history justice!",1429488000,,300,4.882352941176471
