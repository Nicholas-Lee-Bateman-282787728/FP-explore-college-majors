6608089,1,B00N2QVFXK,"Lame DVD technology covered in pretty packaging.

In essence, all fluff and no  substance.  Just another attempt by the studios to try to milk more money from the consumer.
My  advice, get the  vastly superior Blu-ray box set  that is much cheaper and looks far far better, and has more extras.

Save your money.",1417392000,16,312,4.666666666666667
6608090,5,B00N2QVFXK,"While I understand some people are frustrated with the many re-releases of this fantastic show, the great thing about this release is that is has everything (including extras) in one package. While I haven't seen the Blu-ray versions, the (superb) video and audio quality are identical to the Definitive Collection DVD releases.

And since the 80's version has never been released on Blu-ray, this is likely as good as it's ever going to look, absent a complete (expensive) digital remastering a la Star Trek. And that seems unlikely, according to series writer/producer Alan Brennert.

The packaging is pretty cool, with a black cube containing lenticular images from several episodes on the sides, a complete episode guide booklet, a mini reproduction Gold Key comic book, and two bonus discs filled with extras.

So, to sum up, if you are a huge fan of the show, and you want everything in one package, this is the one. If you already own some (or all) of the original series, it's a bit trickier. It helps if you enjoyed the 80's series, which has some great episodes, but wasn't as consistent as the original series.",1416873600,60,1121,4.858638743455497
6608091,5,B00N2QVFXK,"The DVD negative comments driving down the rating on this set are so annoying.

IN ADDITION:
REASON FOR DVD AND NOT BLU-RAY:

From TV SHOWS ON DVD website:
NOTE (10/1): During the past 24 hours, the above story has generated responses from our readers which amounts to, ""if this set is so prestigious, then why isn't it on Blu-ray Disc instead of DVD?"" The answer is that the 1985 series  (the New Twilight Zone) CANNOT be done for HD, as it was shot on 35mm film but finished on videotape, and therefore cannot be transferred to high-def Blu-ray.

Taken from: http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Twilight-Zone-The-5th-Dimension-LE/20338#ixzz3MQbM3ieu

I bought this too! Most of the negative comments are from people with sour grapes because they bought earlier versions and this one is so great. Love the boxing and it's limited edition as well. Only a little over 7000 sold. I also agree with the Blu Ray black and white comment. It's a black and white show! Blu Ray won't enhance it that much.",1416614400,15,1234,5.502645502645502

Rod serling added not only his introductions and but has written most of the episodes. The 1980s version has struggled to give a fresh approach but couldn't. It is a very nice set but unnessesary because the show is available in single sets and boxsets already including fan favorites and the recent essential set. 194.00 is just insane on amazon you can get the sets or episodes for minimum costs. This is just another way to squeeze money out of fans of the shows. The most dumbest of all is this boxset are not blurays!!!!!! lol the older sets twilight zone original is available in blu rays. I am happy with the old definitive boxset I bought several years ago,in my opinion I stand correct to say this is a waste of money for this boxset. I would suggest to look at the array of available sets on amazon on both twilight zones for a better price if you don't have any of them. I will say the twilight zone is truly one of the greatest televison shows in history 3 stars for the twilight zone show and two stars off for this useless repackage....P.S. by the way im sure these shows are crsytal clear in picture and sound and so are the old sets as well.",1412726400,15,1543,4.514285714285714

I have the original sets when they first came out on DVD. When 3 or 4 episodes were on the disc's. And then when they came out on DVD I got those too. So there's probably no sense in wasting  my money on this set. I probably wouldn't watch them all anyway.

6608115,5,B00N2QVFXK,"First off, I won't waste time reviewing the content of The Twilight Zone.  Since this series has been around since the end of the 1950's, I shall assume that (a) This speaks for itself, in the fact that it lasts 'til this day, and  (b) if you're still reading this, then you'll know how truly great TV it is anyway.  So I'll just comment on this DVD box set.

1.  There are plenty of extra features for fans to love on these discs.  OK, so it's not a Blu-Ray set.  I admit that would have been better for the original series (I know that isn't currently viable for the 80's series, due to reasons you will easily discover if you research just a little more), but DVDs are still perfectly watchable.  Extras include features such as commentaries for a lot of episodes - my fave so far is the Richard Donner commentary for Nightmare at 20000 feet.

2. The outer packaging looks outstanding.  The outer box with the lenticular B/W photos is fantastic and the 'lid' when closed over the top frames it very nicely.  Contents are rewarding, with a small reprinted comic, episode guide booklet and extra discs.

3.  The inner packaging (DVD 'cases') are flimsy and need to be treated with care.  Thin, easily bent cardboard shells are not ideal for lots of discs like this.  Treat your set with extreme care and it will be fine I am sure, but otherwise, well, considering the money this costs, I really wish it had a more sturdy protective cover inside for all the DVDs to be housed in.

4.  Only two other things I would say as a caution, is that be aware that ...  1)  Although the original series has clearly been remastered (very nicely! It looks fantastic!) - the 80's series has clearly not had the same attention bestowed upon it.  I know the technical reasons for this, not being HD, from reading other reviews (and I suggest you do the same) - but it would have been nice if SOME kind of attention had been paid to these great episodes, as well as the originals.  2)  Be aware that the original series is now presented ANAMORPHIC. (!)  What does this mean..?  Well, I'm kind of surprised this has been mastered this way to be honest, since the 80's series here is still presented full screen (the way it was made - as was the original series!).  It means that if you have a modern new widescreen display - and I'm sure most folks reading this will - you likely won't notice any issues, in fact you'll likely benefit from the 'extra resolution'.  But.  If you still have an old school CRT TV (or any similar aspect ratio display device) then you're kind of screwed, to be honest, with these discs, since you'll have to view them in anamorphic mode - and you'll be wasting screen real estate - ultimately having a black border around the image - so it won't fill your screen as it should.  :(  Again, this is only an issue if you have an older TV or 4:3 aspect ratio display.  But if you do, it's kind of infuriating as to why this was done just for the original series and not the 80's series (which will still fill a traditional 4:3 CRT screen correctly).  Well...  C'est La Vie.  Otherwise, a truly awesome box set and highly recommended.",1432857600,45,3141,4.40695652173913
6608116,5,B00N2QVFXK,"I'd just like to put in my two cents on the price of this set.  I bought the ORIGINAL DVD releases of the series starting back in '99 with, ""Treasures of the Twilight Zone"" and ""More Treasures of the Twilight Zone"".  These were single-disc releases which had 3 episodes each.  I can't remember what I payed exactly, but I would believe it to be in the neighborhood of $19.99-$24.99 per release.  I then began getting the regular numbered releases as soon as each hit the street.  This is a total of 45 DVD cases on my shelves, most having 4 episodes each, some having only 3 (those with one-hour episodes).  I'm sure I payed anywhere from $12.99-$19.99 for most of the series.  So just say an average price of $15.00, that makes my purchase price $675 plus tax, just for the ORIGINAL series, and some discs had duplicates of earlier releases.  For ONE ultra low price you not only get a better pressing and presentation of the show I bought, but you also get better and MORE extras, as well as the mid-80's re-boot... which despite its MANY flaws, still has some DAMNED FINE STORIES!!!!  In particular, ""Nightcrawlers"" based on the short story by Robert R. McCammon, and the short, ""I of Newton"" with Ron Glass and Sherman Hemsley.  So please don't complain about the price.  Your complaints fall flat with us old grognards.",1431734400,11,1324,4.615384615384615

6608124,4,B00N2QVFXK,"I haven't actually bought this, I would love to, but I'm writing this in response to a majority of the reviewers here who probably would be considered trolls anywhere else.  So you folks didn't bother buying this either but are butt hurt that this release wasn't in bluray format and decided to review something you don't own and haven't experienced?  How does that work?  This is of course a series that was made in the mid 60's and the 80's.  I'm not sure a bluray treatment would make much of a difference in quality anyway.

The only problem I can see here is the list price of $350 and the amazon bargain price of $175 still seems way too high for me.  One benefit of bluray might have been being able to store more data on each disc, reducing the amount of discs, but I doubt that would lower the price of this collection seeing as the retail for most blurays is still by and large more expensive when compared to dvd.  I'd say the thing that I find most startling from these reviews is the claim that dvd is an outdated format.  The last time I checked anything that plays blurays are also backwards compatible with ya know dvds.  Its not exactly like they're trying to release a new collection on laserdisc or VHS.  In that case I might agree with your outrage.  As it happens DVD is still a superior format when considering the technology they had available during the time these shows were being filmed.

If you want I'm sure you can run a search for The Twilight Zone Complete Collection in bluray.  Or I dunno maybe wait a month or two for the same collection to come out in your preferred format you snobs.

THE ORIGINAL SERIES
A new transfer onto DVD of the episode prints used to create the Bluray release,- even the menu screens are similar - these versions are even better than those used to create the Definitive Edition DVDs back in the mid 2000's. Rod Serling Promos that were missing when that release was compiled have been rediscovered in the archives and added to this 5th Dimension Edition and certain picture flaws have been corrected. This edition is presented in its original aspect ratio of 4:3 so when viewed there are black borders down either side of the screen. This edition will not allow you to ""stretch"" the image horizontally to fit a widescreen television, a real drawback for some people who hate the bands down either side of their TV. If that does bother you then go for the Definitive Edition or The Complete Series Episodes Only Edition which does allow you to watch ""full-screen"" as it were. However good extra to this set is the ""Play All"" feature on each disc allowing you to create your own TZ marathons. Extras-wise this release is very commentary-heavy with many imported from the Blurays with many (but not all) of the Definitive Edition special features now on the two bonus discs along side two new and exclusive items. The first, a brand new 1-hour documentary in two parts, ""As Timeless As Infinity"", chronicles both the creation and the legacy of Rod Serling's series while the second is the first appearance on DVD (at least in the USA) of ""The Time Element"", the unofficial pilot to the series.
THE 1980'S SERIES
A re-issue of the the original mid-200's set from Image Entertainment, much has been said of the poor picture quality of this release and the reasons for it can be found in other reviews of the Complete 1980's Series on Amazon. Suffice to say that unless CBS can go back to the original 35mm film this series was made on and rebuild it in HD this is as good as this series will get (and is probably the reason this 5th Dimension set is on DVD and not Bluray). A stand alone DVD EpikPack re-release of the Complete 1980's Series is due shortly from CBS.
To conclude, this really is, for all its pros and cons, a five star release and raises the bar for future TV series releases on DVD and Bluray. The die-hard TZ fan will probably have the series on Bluray but if you know someone who hasn't made the jump to HD and has even a passing admiration for Rod Serling's brainchild then this would make the perfect gift. It looks terrific on the shelf, matt-black, lenticular images from four classic episodes on four sides and the Twilight Zone Logo embossed in silver on the lid. Yup, five stars
P.S. I have been a Twilight Zone fan for many years now, ever since i was a boy watching episodes late night on the BBC (yes, i'm British, living in the North of England), and i couldn't resist importing this when i saw it as Amazon's Deal of the Day on New Year's Day. It arrived promptly, well packed, taking only 12 Days from placing the order to arrival. Why am i telling you this? Well, after traveling possibly thousands of miles, through dozens of pairs of hands and many different couriers it was, in a twist worthy of the Twilight Zone itself, delivered to my door by my best friend's brother who just happened to be temping for the courier firm that day...Cue the theme music!
