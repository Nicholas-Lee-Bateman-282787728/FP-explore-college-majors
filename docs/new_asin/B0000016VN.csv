7901949,4,B0000016VN,"This is an old VHS tape of a rare documentary done by a Danish company on one their ex-patriots, Peter Martins. My wife had me get his for her because she was a member of SAB and the New York City Ballet and is actually in it for a brief scene in a rehearsal. She is and was a lovely site to see! The story about Peter is pretty good to. He is and was a great talent. Quality is typical for VHS and makes me appreciate DVDs.",1383955200,,424,3.8295454545454546
7901950,5,B0000016VN,"Peter Martins takes us on a tour of his ambitions,  partners, choreographers and multifold talents. Most interesting of all are the moments Martins shares with Balanchine, Robbins and of course Suzanne Farrell. (Watch how Farrell relates the same movement given her by Robbins to Martins. She swoons in Robbins' hands, and makes Martins work for the same moment!)
 Most surprising of all is Martins as choreographer. His first work is a nervously comic delight. For balletomanes, this is a wonderful document.
Tremendous fun, with some wonderful montage sequences of the corps in rehearsal.",1001980800,5,590,5.333333333333333
