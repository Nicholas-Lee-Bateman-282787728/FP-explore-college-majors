2839111,1,B000QQDKYG,"I find it interesting that anyone could call the items in this collection ""movies.""  They seem to me to be a collection of ridiculous productions made by a group of rank amateurs using only a home video camera.  The photography is abominable, the audio is extremely distorted and appears to be coming solely from the tiny inadequate microphone on the camera itself, and the ""actors"" appear to me to be so unaccomplished that it is almost painful for me to watch them. Although I skipped around, I could only get through four of these home movie clips before throwing the lot into the garbage can.",1192320000,10,596,4.666666666666667

Fans of murder, mayhem and maniacs will not be disappointed by this up-to-date collection, however.

2839115,5,B000QQDKYG,"It's hard to believe that so many people bought this dvd that have no interest in independent horror movies, just to run on here and complain about the acting and sound...lol. Anyway, for those who have attended an indie film festival or are lucky to have indie theatres in your area, this is like 5 festivals in one collection for less than the price for two people to go see another remake of Texas Chain Saw Massacre or Halloween or whatever else Hollywood has decided to remake for the umpteenth time. If you're looking for something different, you got it in this collection.

I would say there are 10 really good films in this collection that most people would enjoy. They follow the Hollywood pattern you're familiar with and we know pretty well. I mean, I see a movie like Matthew, Dead 7, or Invitation and I consider I have got my money back. But I will say that the complaints of others are not totally off base. Some of the movies are really shamefully put together and i would have liked for Pendulum to have just left them out of the collection altogether because they were an embarassment to the other well made films, but in my opinion, there are only 4-5 that meet that description. The fun part is going through them all and finding what you like. Hell's Highway and Goth are two good ones that come to mind that were a lot of fun to watch.

Cautionary note: Some of the films in this collection show graphic scenes of violence, especially serial murderers torturing women. There are also scenes of suicide which are shocking and graphic. I only mention this because I don't believe young children should be exposed to these images.

Overall, the collection was much. much better than expected. By reading the negative reviews here, I thought these are going to be totally unwatchable movies. I found the majority of them to be very entertaining. I have several Tromadance dvds that can't come close the films that are in this collection. For those tired of the same old same old, I think this collection provides you with a nice look at alternative cinema at an affordable price.",1210464000,12,2097,4.616621983914209
2839116,1,B000QQDKYG,"This is the most unentertaining collection I have ever bought.  These movies share a common lack of: plot development, quality writing, proper lighting values, background music, sensible editing.  The acting is unversally horrible and amateurish. I gave it one star only because zero is not allowed.",1210464000,5,299,5.478260869565218
2839117,4,B000QQDKYG,"The acting is horrible. The special effects are cheesy. The music is grating. But these films have heart. These filmmakers did not have huge Hollywood budgets, but they had a sense of fun. They remind me of the days when there was no ""You Tube"" or Blockbuster. Back when the way to watch movies at home was to go to the ""mom-and-pop"" video store, we used to rent ""silver label videos"". These videos were cheaply made horror films that were independently produced and printed with silver labels with red print. We used to go to different stores just to find different silver label videos. We used to have silve label video parties where we would watch these cheap, cheesy movies instead of the high budget Hollywood films and, despite the terrible production values, we had fun. These movies remind me of the days of VHS and BETA and the old mom-and-pop video stores with stacks of obscure ""silver label"" videos. This collection provides for many silver label video parties. It really brings back memories of the 1980s and the early days of video. I believe many of these filmmakers grew up watching silver label videos like ""Creeptales"" (Available on other sets like this) and they enjoyed just having fun with these videos. Enjoy and hearken back to 1980s cheese done in 21st Century style.",1196035200,21,1291,4.767857142857143
2839118,5,B000QQDKYG,"This is probably the worst DVD BOX SET I have ever purchased....And I am enjoying every minute of it.  Although I did not get the full version of this set (due to a Millcreek production error, one that forgot to include Disc 1 of the set), I got it cheap enough to enjoy the contents without many complaints.  But there are a few.

For starters if you are a fan of YouTube or internet videos, then you will like this set.  If you are not, do not waste your money.  If you do not like seeing really fat and ugly girls naked, do not waste your money.  If you do not like Ron Jeremy, do not waste your money.  The only reason for the last comment is because of the film ""Hells Highway.""  IT was hillarious to watch Ron get his ""Special member"" chopped off.  That scene alone was worth the $10.00 I spent on this set.",1195171200,6,813,4.127388535031847
2839119,5,B000QQDKYG,"These aren't Hollywood type horror films, this is underground stuff. If that's your cup of tea you will dig this, if it's not you won't. I liked the majority of the films on this box set. I also own the ""Tomb of Terrors"" set. When I bought this I went in with an open mind and I wasn't disappointed.",1194652800,6,299,4.084745762711864
2839120,5,B000QQDKYG,"I read a few negative reviews and I'm a little surprised. What did you think you were buying? This is a box set of independent horror movies. Not left over classics released for the 50th time. It's independent horror. No budget stuff.  I think this box set is an incredible deal. I saw some bad movies sure, but soo many were really great. I love this genre because it reminds me of punk rock, the guys couldn't play the instruments but they had something different to say. God Bless Independent Horror.",1193443200,4,503,4.527472527472527
2839121,1,B000QQDKYG,"Maybe at 2 cents a movie it will be worth it but at a quarter a ""movie"" it's way overpriced.

2839122,4,B000QQDKYG,"I am giving this a four because I enjoyed about 7-10 of the movies in this fifty pack. I liked ""13"", ""Blood Sucking Babes from Burbank"", ""Matthew"", ""The Crawlspace"", ""Off the Beaten Path"", ""Slasher"" and ""The Summer of the Massacre."" The rest of the films aside from a few others ones were very bad. It is a shame that some of the bad movies are included in this fifty pack because it hurts the credibilty of the movies that I mentioned above. Those movies were actually pretty good considering they are very low-budget independent horror films.",1193011200,2,544,4.677083333333333
2839123,1,B000QQDKYG,"These are truly bad movies.  And the fact that there are 50 of them only makes it worse.  These aren't low budget or campy, they're just not entertaining, poorly written, atrociously acted with zilch in production values.",1192579200,14,221,4.945945945945946
8196734,1,B000QQDKYG,These are awful. Alot of them are nothing more than porn flicks.,1463184000,,64,4.416666666666667
8196735,1,B000QQDKYG,"The movies look like school-boys' projects and cannot scare even a child at all. I know they're low-budget films, but I couldn't watch them, because they lacked atmosphere and convincing acting.",1439424000,,194,5.290322580645161
8196736,3,B000QQDKYG,"What a bargain! Which is not to say there's any way on earth these would've been worth more. But if you have an inexplicable fondness for no-budget amateur horror flicks so awful they couldn't score real distribution, getting a big batch of 'em for next to nothing is truly the way to go.

I'd intended to watch them ten at a stretch but I had to spice up things with better movies and the set is going to last me a lot longer than I'd expected. But it's no joke, no satire, sometimes I really do find myself thinking, ""I'm in the mood for something incredibly stink-a-roonies,"" and this collection has never once disappointed me.",1388707200,,630,4.478260869565218
8196737,1,B000QQDKYG,"First I have to say is that I love B movies. I have several other of these low budget movie collections. And I always find a couple of classic forgotten gems. So far I have not found a movie in this bunch films that I can endure even as background noise. The ones that I have screened are very poor video,s, made in the late 80's early 90's. They are in the same quality as some no budget porno videos.",1263686400,2,402,4.0375

8196740,5,B000QQDKYG,"Yes, there are some very bad (as in awful) 1-2 star movies in this collection. A few, like SUBURBAN SASQUATCH and NIGHTMARE ASYLUM are nearly unwatchable. However, there are quite a few 3-5 star movies as well. I will list the 4 and 5 star movies only, as they are my favorites. <<< (4 star) >>> SERIAL KILLER- A sick, disturbing tale w/ a twist ending. THE CRAWLSPACE- A SAW clone w/ a killer called ""the Director"" tormenting his victims. HIGH DESERT- Psycho-biker, Frank kills without mercy, then gets what he deserves. WHEN HEAVEN COMES DOWN- Serial killer known as ""the Savior"" sends many to the afterlife. MATTHEW (aka: SCREAM BLOODY MURDER)- 1970s gore classic about a maniac dispatching everyone he meets! SLASHER- Decent story about a killer who leaves a gold medallion calling card. Unfortunately, the sound conks out 2 thirds through! WISHBONE- A hideous knick-knack grants wishes at a terrible price. Many deaths! THIRTEEN- Serial murders w/ an AIDS connection. <<< (And now, the 5 star) >>>  HELL'S HIGHWAY- Lucinda, the seemingly unstoppable hitch-hiker / killer on a rampage! HELLBOUND- A woman attempts to bring her sister back from the grave. Bad idea! THE VEIL- A 156 min. zombie epic! Great stuff, especially the giant zombie encounter. INVITATION- A group of childhood friends are reunited as adults. Death ensues! TERROR TOONS- The madcap adventures of Dr. Carnage and his go-rilla cohort, Max Assassin. Bloody, ridiculous fun! DEAD 7- Meth dealers dump a dead body down a mine shaft, only to be stalked and killed! DR. SHOCK'S TALES OF TERROR- 4-story anthology, complete w/ daffy host! THE SHUNNED HOUSE- 3 H.P. Lovecraft tales combined into one twisted film. Awesome! I HATE YOU- Serial-killing stand-up comic sets out for fame and fortune (includes trailers and alt. endings!). SUMMER OF THE MASSACRE- Sort of a british TCM, w/ a gibbering killer named ""Hammerhead"" causing havoc! UP FOR RENT- 3-story anthology w/ necrophelia, a nerdy killer, and humor. GOTH- A girl named GOTH shows two wanna-be's what true darkness is all about. My personal favorite. These movies make this collection a bargain...",1228694400,7,2125,5.071428571428571
8196741,5,B000QQDKYG,"(Your mileage may vary...) I liked these independently made flicks. But I can understand how they might not be for the regular consumer of mass media. So buyer beware....

Watching these movies reminded me of a book I read earlier this year; ""If Chins Could Kill: Confessions of a B Movie Actor"" by Bruce Campbell. It's in part an autobiographical account of how he and his buddies (such as Sam Raimi and his brother) made similar independent films in their youth - such as the ""Evil Dead"" series of movies. It's clear from reading this book that making such independent fare is hard work and in no small degree something that they put their heart into. The same I imagine was true for the people who created the films in this set and the ""Catacomb of Creepshows 50 Movie Pack"" (I bought both).

I noticed that several of the other reviewers made comments along the lines of - ""I could do this"" or ""My kid could make this"".... My suggestion if that is true; get your stuff together and go for it! Who knows - maybe someday we will seeing a major blockbuster you made.",1226880000,7,1067,4.466666666666667
8196742,1,B000QQDKYG,"This seemed a good combination of movies, for a husband who grew up in the fifties and sixties. It turned out to be filled with amature photographers attempts at horror. It seemed like my neighbor down the street took home movies with patched up sets, and very poor sound quality and then tried to put it to video. My kids could do better with our video camera.",1226880000,3,361,4.402985074626866
8196743,1,B000QQDKYG,"During Spring Break, I made the mistake of wasting $25 on this junk. The movies are home-made and extremely independent!
