And when you consider that Bollywood generally tends to not always be that polished anyway, well, READY in terms of its production values really comes off as mediocre stuff... at first. The look of the film would have you thinking this sucker was filmed sometime back in the '90s. Thankfully, there are saving graces. One is that Genelia D'Souza, my latest crush, is in it. Another is that some guy named Ram is also in it and he shares great chemistry with Genelia.

READY is near three hours long so there's plenty of shenanigans to sift thru. The opening minutes unfold like a train wreck as several supporting characters are introduced and there's just a lot of lame silliness in this segment. Our main guy Chandu (Ram) does something which estranges him from his family and next we see him in college and it's at this stage, around 23 minutes into the film, that we meet Pooja (Genelia). A misunderstanding has her being kidnapped by Ram on her wedding day. Turns out though that Pooja, a visitor from America, comes with wretched relatives, namely two wicked warring uncles using her as a marrying pawn in their heated rivalry. So Pooja is very much a reluctant bride and doesn't at all mind being abducted. Except that now she and Chandu find themselves pursued by brutal goons deployed by her two feuding uncles. Do Pooja and Chandu fall in love? You bet your bhangra they do.

Indian cinema is a colossal industry, more movies coming out of it annually than the yearly sum produced in Hollywood. And so there's a lot of commonality with certain themes. There tends to be a focus on sentimental family drama and huge importance placed on traditional values. Typical of Indian cinema, the male protagonist Chandu is an audacious hero, a marvelous trickster, an ardent lover, a nice dancer, a fearsome fighter. Yeah, Indian cinema tends to run to excesses, and it took me a while to get used to that. There are fight scenes and Chandu acquits himself like dude's the best fighter in the world ever, and it's pretty ridiculous (but again fairly typical) that mere kicks and punches would send combatants sailing improbably thru the air. However, this guy Ram is a pretty likable actor and one tends to not mind that much. Or I didn't, anyway. And I have to admit that the last fight scene is pretty cool.

At first the comedy content is borderline embarrassing and so cheesy, but stick with it because the second half rolls along and things improve dramatically. What happens is that Chandu and Pooja, in concert with Chandu's family and I think some of his friends, orchestrate an intricate con to free Pooja from her sinister uncles. And the way the caper unfolds had me frequently in stitches. I like the manner in which Chandu manages to improvise to each complication that springs up (it's a gem, how Chandu flips the Chicago Subba Rao scenario on that shady auditor McDowell Murthy). It's a delightful bit of trickeration, and it was well on its way to working perfectly... until the coma patient woke up.

And if you've been keeping up with Bollywood for the past few years, then you may get why the Krrish superhero sequence is so funny.

The musical numbers are mostly tepid and dragged on, with the two exceptions of ""Om Namaste Bolo"" and ""Ninne Pelladukuni,"" and these two are noteworthy mostly for their picturizations rather than the songs themselves.

If you can get past the aggravating bits, then you should enjoy yourself. And if you enjoy yourself, it'll be mostly because of the two leads who ooze charisma and come with terrific energy. This isn't Genelia D'Souza's best effort -&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bommarillu/dp/B000UEHZ9U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bommarillu</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jaane-Tu-ya-jaane-na-DVD-hindi-movie-bollywood/dp/B001IDMLPK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jaane Tu... ya jaane na (DVD) (hindi movie, bollywood)</a>&nbsp;are heaps better - but she's still endearing and sunny and beautiful in this one. READY was a box office hit when it came out in 2008, and it's good enough that a Tamil remake is underway which will also be titled READY and stars none other than Genelia herself. Me, I'm not complaining.",1264204800,,4383,5.140252454417952
