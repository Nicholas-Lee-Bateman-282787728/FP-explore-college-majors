7932845,5,B000056WSO,"This is the first of three in a series of detailed reviews from the videos comprising the Powerpuff 3-Pack.  Video:  Boogie Frights, and it is the best of all the Powerpuff collections.
The title episode is a take-off on the disco song, not the movie with Mark Wahlberg and Burt Reynolds.  Pop culture references:  disco music, Saturday Night Fever, and a funny one involving the Death Star battle in Star Wars:A New Hope.  The Boogie Man hatches a sinister plot to plunge Townsville into eternal darkness, into one long disco party.  One of the most precious scenes involve Blossom and Buttercup arguing about wanting to stay up late.  In the middle of this, a large lump scooches thru the middle of the bed.  A nervous Bubbles pops up, surrounded by her stuffed animals.  Awww!!  There's also a theme of confronting one's fear that comes up in the end.  (Rating:  5)
""Slumbering With The Enemy"" has the Powerpuff Girls inviting all the girls for a slumber party at their place.  Guess who else shows up?  A certain simian with blonde pigtailed hair and long dress called... Mojeesha!  The girls keep an eye on ""her"" and time and again, embarrass themselves by interpreting ""her"" attempts to join in as acts of evil.  But why is ""she"" here anyway?  The montage of Mojeesha and the Girls in various costumes are great fun.  (Rating:  5)
""Ice Sore"" features Blossom's ice powers, which comes in handy during a real scorcher of a day.  Blossom's tendency to trust authority, particularly the Professor's, and her guilt when her good intentions go wrong, are demonstrated here.  Her powers cause some jealousy from her sisters, whose powers don't seem to equal something so useful.  (Rating:  5)
The Shonen Knife video for ""Buttercup"" features clips from various episodes as well as a flurry of freeze frames of certain villains.  Although primarily about Buttercup, it features the other girls as well.  The song's snarling power-pop/punk rhythms match Buttercup's power punches to a tee.  (Rating:  5)
One of the best stories in the series is ""The Rowdyruff Boys"", in which Mojo Jojo, after being foiled time and again by the Puffs, decides to create the antithesis of the Girls.  Remember the old rhyme, ""sugar, spice, and everything nice.""  What are little boys made of?  How Mojo gets the ingredients are great.  However, Mojo's substitute for Chemical X proves just as effective, and the three boys really beat the stuffing out of the Girls, making the Boys one of their most formidable adversaries.  However, the way the Girls achieve their victory is one of the most creative solutions ever seen.  (Rating:  5)
""Helter Shelter"" is a unique episode in that there are no villains to be fought.  Rather, the girls have to deal with Bubbles and her proclivity to bring back animals.  Despite being lectured about this by the Professor, she outdoes herself by bringing home a baby-whale, which she places in the middle window of their room like the car at the Hard Rock Cafe.  The frenzied scene where they frantically try to find a hiding place for the whale in the house is the funniest, as is the exchange:  ""The professor's gonna have a cow.""  Bubbles says:  ""NO!  A baby whale!""  Bubbles is clearly a champion for animals, a tried and true romantic.  (Rating:  5)
A perfect 5 rating for the Girls all-around!",1041552000,,3313,4.818505338078292
7932846,5,B000056WSO,"Powerpuff Girls prove that simplistic animation, along with an awesome soundtrack and effects can wipe out all animation competition. The episodes are great, just the perfect formula for any hardcore fan or beginner. My favorite is Boogie Frights, where the monsters from under the bed come out to play. A really neat take on Boogie Nights, you'll love the animation sequence on that episode. The rest are awesome too. This is what fans needs.",998179200,2,443,5.0
7932847,4,B000056WSO,"Best cartoon in the collection is ""Slumbering with the Enemy,"" where Mojo Jojo becomes Mojesha and parties all night with the Powerpuff Girls and their friends.  The dress-up sequence involving all four is quite funny.  Worst cartoon in the collection is the new cartoon ""Helter Shelter.""  Bubbles loves stray pets, but the latest one - a baby whale - gets the sisters into trouble.  No enemies, no fights, but a return of Blossom's ice breath powers.  It just does not have the same feel as the classic PPG episodes.  The rest of the cartoons are quite good, especially the nightmare monster world meets Star Wars parody on ""Boogie Nights"".  The Samurai Jack preview and Shonen Knife videos are quite cool, and the extra Courage the Cowardly Dog cartoon is funny (especially for those of you who remember the old Clutch Cargo cartoon series.)",986601600,3,843,4.853146853146853
