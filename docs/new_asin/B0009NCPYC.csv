2301896,5,B0009NCPYC,"This flick surprised me. I was expecting acting along the lines of Macho and Midnight Dancers but these guys are really talented. What really impressed me is how universal gay emotions and personalities are. These guys could have been my friends down the street from me here in Honolulu working through the exact emotions. Intelligently made with attention to detail. The quality is surprisingly good considering it was made with non-industry standard equipment. I found myself talking outloud to the main character, it really hit a sensitive spot for me. I have certainly been in his shoes. Buy a copy and support this project. Looking forward to future projects from this guy.",1140739200,20,678,5.0625
2301897,4,B0009NCPYC,"DUDA (DOUBT) is an example of how a man driven by an idea for a film can succeed against all odds at creating a significant statement.  Writer/Director Crisaldo Pablo used a cast of friends with some professionals and with the use of a Sony VX made the first full-length digital film ever shot in the Philippines.  Comments by Cris Pablo and some of the actors are in a 'making of' feature on the DVD demonstrate how much dedication to a vision played in this brave little movie.

The story deals with the life of a thirty-something young man Cris (Andoy Ranay - 'Markova: Comfort Gay', 'Bathhouse') whose life to date has been that of a man seeking sexual encounters daily, swearing that after 4000 such encounters he will find the perfect mate as #4001.  After a particularly active night (seven conquests) he meets the early twenty-something Erick (Paulo Gabriel) and indeed settles into what he feels will be a lifetime commitment.  Cris' friends are constant companions who are pleased at Cris' new lifestyle, but at the same time are wary of the youthful Erick's fidelity.  Doubt ensues and Cris confronts Erick on his time away from the home, a factor that makes the experimenting Erick outraged at Cris' constant jealousy.  Ben, an old paramour of Cris' appears, making one last attempt to ignite past fires of passion before he marries a girlfriend: Cris remains committed to Erick.

Cris works as a television director and much of the story plays out by showing simultaneous TV talk shows, one about Cris' life and the other about Erick's adventures.  The tension mounts as Cris sees his relationship disintegrating and hearing some sad news about Ben, Cris resolves to live the lonely life of an aging gay man...until a surprise event occurs.

For a first-time film, DOUBT has many positive qualities.  Flashback sequences  are filmed in black and white in a grainy, semi-focused manner that allows the theme of sensuality to be presented in an amazingly subtle way.  Considering the film is shot with a digital camera, the flow is smooth and the sense is one of immediacy and spontaneity.  The only professional actor is the lead Andoy Ranay and he draws a convincing, three-dimensional character with whom we can identify - a man approaching the age of 'undesirable' in the gay world of the Philippines.  The rest of the cast, though unsophisticated in training, give committed performances under Crisaldo Pablo's direction.  The resulting product is a somewhat rough but ultimately honest and creative movie about the private and public pain of gay  relationships.  Give it a try.  In Tagalog and English with subtitles.

2301902,1,B0009NCPYC,"As with another one of these films, the main character is named ""Cris."" No one can act, the lighting is bad, you can ""see"" their ""emotions"" coming a mile away. It's an endless blab fest with nothing being said and cutaways to other scenes/situations that do not make things flow... and this was in the first 10 minutes of the film. After 20 minutes, I gave up. I noticed other ""actors"" from similar ""productions"" made in the Philippines. I'm sorry, but all these films are exactly the same, except in this film the writer felt compelled to have the actors call each other derogatory terms in a ""humorous"" way. It went on for so long that I thought, ""This is the best you can do?""

The only thing ""films"" of this ""caliber"" have are eye-candy covers to entice stupid people like me to watch them. A complete total waste of time. I did not care for a nano-second what happened to any of these people. Absolutely dreadful.",1440201600,2,918,4.497005988023952

2301906,3,B0009NCPYC,"This movie was not bad to watch. It was shot in a weird way, one I would have not expected but its still something I don't regret seeing. The acting was great, for a low budget Filipino movie and the plot was intact. I wish that they spent less time on the friends of the main characters and more time on their relationship and how it disintegrated.  And the ending was really random. Overall, not bad, I have seen worse!!!",1361836800,,423,4.2875

8063462,4,B0009NCPYC,"I don't know why people didn't like this movie.  The ending was not tragic at all and there really wasn't any horrible people nor was the movie boring.  I have seen a lot of gay movie, many of the Filipino ones are dark and graphic with seedy characters.  This movie goes into the lives of several gay men and their search for love and what people do to get it, or keep it.  I think it explores friendship more than anything though and gives a pretty realistic perspective of human behavior especially regarding love, lust, desire and the consequences it has with others involved.

We all make mistakes, especially when we lack gratitude for the things we have presently in our life.  I don't think anyone was made out to be an antagonist in this movie just like in real life.  Everyone has various contributing factors to their decisions, no one will ever know all of them to give a 100% accurate explanation, even if they come close. This movie takes you to some of the factors that are not present when decisions are being made.  It helps explain why things happened the way they did.

This is one of the few movies I think that does a good job showing how our experiences and actions shape our character and our relationships.",1446854400,,1230,4.504504504504505
