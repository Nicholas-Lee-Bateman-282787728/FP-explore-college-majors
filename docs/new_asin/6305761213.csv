1080506,5,6305761213,The movies really funny and it shows how high school cliques are as well as having a really cute love story! i'd definetly recomend it to teens!,954115200,,144,4.37037037037037
1080507,3,6305761213,"This movie was a big dissapointment to me.  I had expected the acting to be better, and Melissa didn't look good throughout the entire movie.  The ending was good, and there were a few funny parts, but it wasn't a movie  that I'd buy, and I don't recommend you buying either, if you want to see  it and haven't already, go rent it!  If you still want to buy it then come  back, but I don't think you should waste your money on this, you'll get  sick of it after you watch it twice.",953337600,2,481,4.053191489361702

1080511,3,6305761213,"Drive me Crazy on the surface is portrayed as a shallow,run-of-the-mill, simplistic movie. I also thought it would be this. But instead it is an eyopening web of complex emotions. Some of the beginning parts are  questionable though (Chase goes from grunge-boy, to popular boyfriend in  about 2 seconds with little instant remorse, or thought), but as the movie  unfolds, it becomes something more. This is largely in part of the simple,  yet true to the heart performances of the two leads, Adrian Grenier, who  delicately portrays a teenager somewhere between a hurt child, and a  noncomformist anti-hero, and Melissa Joan Hart believeably portraying a  perky popular girl who has a slow change of heart about who she is and  where she stands. As supporting characters ''Designated Dave'' is strongly  played, showing  acore of insecurity and hurt. BUt overall what makes the  film worth seeing is the general feel of it. The simple, yet realistically  portrayed wounds of hurt, insecurity, and inferiority that make the  ''uncool'' kids try to be what they aren't. High school is finally  realistically portrayed as a Nazi-like environment. As brutal as it seems,  it really is. People get hurt, and suffer and are dehumanized in what is no  less than a Nazi following of kids degrading each other. Hopefully other  filmmakers will take the hint and start creating movies that are more true  to life, instead of the upper-cut, simplistic movies they currently  process.",952732800,15,1472,5.083682008368201
1080512,1,6305761213,Somewhat the same old boring plot. girl makes unpopular guy known and at the process falling in love. Just like the movie plot in 'she's all that' only duller. Mellisa Joan Hart has really overdone herself here.  Adrian  grenier looked good but he deserved a better movie plot and partner. Id  give it a star for the cool clothes during the prom nite scene in the film.,950227200,,369,4.477611940298507

1081010,3,6305761213,"In the interest of full disclosure, I had the biggest crush ever on Melissa Joan Hart when I was twelve years old in 1999 and this movie came out during the period in question when she could do no wrong in my eyes. Sixteen years later, I wanted to see if it still held its lofty position. It doesnt. Drive Me Crazy is not a horrible movie, but it ultimately is what it is: light fare for the teenage crowd. I did like that they had the popular kids and the I guess we would call them geeks or nerds and they sort of had this series of interactions that laid bare how so many people mustve felt during high school.

Bottom line is that this movie is no five star classic and could easily bore anyone in the audience over thirty, but if you fall in the intended demographic for this movie or have nothing to do for ninety minutes, then there are worse things to do with your life then watching Drive Me Crazy.",1449705600,,907,4.153409090909091

1081045,5,6305761213,"Best friend love stories are one of my favorite book and movie stories to follow. This movie has one of my favorite childhood actress Melissa Joan Hart in it and she's so amazing in this movie. She plays Nicole, a preppy,student body,school announcer who used to be best friends with  Chase. (hot,hot,and hot!) Now, it's years later and they basically ignore that the other breaths air. By fate or alcohol,whichever you want to believe in...they make a deal and lying,romance,friendship,ensue.

Watching their friendship go all over the screen and how one another cares for the other and them remembering what they had before is really nice. This isn't just a romance,keep that in mind,this is a teen drama romance comedy.  The ending always kills me with QUESTIONS.

She wants to show her high school friends that she can make any guy change for her and he wants to show that he can fit into a popular crowd.  In doing so, they sort of drive each other crazy because even though they are together as an act, they actually have real feelings for each other.  They don't know how to truly act towards each other because they don't quite know how the other person truly feels.

1081366,3,6305761213,"This movie stars Melissa Joan Hart and it was made in 1999.  As such, it is pretty much typical of the teen high school comedy and the stereotypes that go with it.  Melissa's character is Nicole a senior.  She is popular with lots of school spirit during the centennial year of her high school.  I won't give too much of the plot away but she attends Homecoming with Chase played by Adrian Grenier.  He is also a senior but he is of a more independent mindset who views the majority of students as ""sheep"" and especially looks at the popular kids with disdain.  The movie is pretty much what you would expect from the genre and I don't find fault with the acting.  One thing that is odd is it seemed dated when I watched it.  I can't really say why, but it did.",1439510400,,761,4.236111111111111

So in other words there really isn't anything here to see. The guy is a troll. The girl is cute but she is not cute in a girly way. So there isn't even that. Even the most sought after guy isn't cute with his bleached orange hair with his brown eyes. Yuck. The sound track is annoying.

It is probably one of the better teen movies I have enjoyed over the years because it showed all sides of high school and it had some really good themes throughout.  It is a lot of quirky fun but also adds tones of seriousness throughout.  I especially enjoy the friend's film that he makes showing that people shouldn't be sheep and follow something blindly and that there shouldn't be lables on people since high school is only a small part of our lives.  It is a great Saturday night fun movie to watch alone or with friends.,1426896000,,593,4.315315315315315

There was a good array of characters and the two lead characters, Melissa Joan Hart as Nicole and Adrian Grenier as Chase, worked well together. There are a lot of new young actors in these movies, like Fast Times at Ridgemont High, and their performances are usually outstanding. There is one poignant scene between Chase and is old girlfriend, Dulcie (Ali Larter) and the director John Schultz captured one of the most dramatic moments in cinema since Paul Henreid and Bette Davis in Now, Voyager. Anyway, Dulcie strolls into her favorite bar/hangout with Chase, but wait, he stops at the door, reluctant to go in. He looks around at the place and he begins to think that this is not the life he wants. He knows there are better places to hang, better people to be with and so he watches Dulcie pony up to the bar among the crowd. She turns and suddenly realizes Chase is not next to her, her eyes look away for a moment and when her eyes move to lock onto his, they begin to well up with tears and they are both communicating without a single word. It's a jewel of a moment for a director and for these young talented actors.

I then saw this DVD on the shelf at Fry's electronics, and paid $20+ to see what else this actress had done.  Meh, she marginally looked like a few girls I knew at the time, but I didn't really have a whole lot of interest in miss Hart as such.

The movie was fun for a younger audience.  It's pretty formulaic stuff.  Neighborhood kids who grow apart rediscover one another, and sparks fly.  Not a film I'd see again if given the opportunity.

But, if you're into the whole high school genre, then check it out.

Technical marks all pass muster.  It's the kind of production I'd be proud to shoot.  Hopefully I can harness the kind of skill that went into this thing some day.

Nicole wants a dream date with the star basketball player; but got dissed when he choose a rival school chearleader instead. Chase's girlfriend is smart and beautiful; but dumpes him because he refused to attend an animal rights rally with her. Now that Nicole and Chase have something in common, they reluctantly join forces to navigate the land mines of high school love. Their scheme: date each other to attract the interest and jealousy of their romantic prey. But in true teen movie format, Nicole and Chase find that the one the always wanted was closer than they ever realized.

1082170,3,6305761213,"Isn't it funny how some films don't quite fit their stereotypes? I settled down to watch Drive Me Crazy because I was in the mood to watch a mindless teen movie, and given that this film stars Melissa Joan Hart of Sabrina The Teen Witch fame, I was expecting really more of the same. It doesn't help that the beginning of the film reinforces the stereotype (complete with cheesy pop background music, neon-lit opening titles and slow pan across a typical teenage girl's bedroom followed by Melissa answering the phone in her best ""a la Sabrina"" perky voice).

What I encountered was a film that is still very much rooted in the teen ""prom"" genre, but is slightly deeper and sophisticated (as well as more ponderous and slow-moving) than I expected. It's quite a biting and penetrating observation of the high school social hierarchy as well as the conflicting emotions of young love. Think of it as a more serious version of Clueless with a dash of Dangerous Liaisons thrown in.

Nicole Maris (Melissa Joan Hart) is a pretty and popular girl at the Timothy Zonin High School (definitely in the ""in"" crowd) who is organising a big formal dance celebrating the centenary anniversary of her school. She has the hots for school basketball star Brad (Gabriel Carpenter) and hopes he will be her date for the dance.

Neighbour and fellow classmate Chase Hammon (Adrian Grenier) is on the other side of the school social stratum. Sporting a ""rebel without a cause"" attitude and a grungy appearance, he hangs out with nerdy Ray (Kris Park) and ""Designated Dave"" (Mark Webber) - the latter so-nicknamed because he doesn't drink therefore he always chauffeurs the other kids when they are blind drunk and want to go back home after a party. At the beginning of the film, the three of them (masterminded by Chase) stage a prank involving putting coloured dye into the school sprinkler system which nearly gets them suspended.

Incidentally, Nicole and Chase used to be childhood friends but then grew apart into their different ways. Both have single parents (William Converse-Roberts as Mr. Hammond and Faye Grant as Mrs. Maris) as Chase's mum died of cancer and Nicole's father (Stephen Collins) is estranged. Their parents appear to be very ""friendly"" with each other, and later on in the film we find out why.

So, when Brad - on the verge of asking Nicole to the centenary dance - falls in love with a cheerleader instead (when he accidentally fell on her during a basketball game), and Chase's girlfriend Dulcie (Ali Larter) dumps him because she thinks he's too shallow (because she is into animal rights and he doesn't seem to be interested), Nicole and Chase strike an unholy deal - they will pretend to be in a relationship with each other in an attempt to make their desired partners jealous.

Nicole gives Chase a Pygmalion-like makeover and suddenly it looks like their crazy plan may just succeed after all. Or will they fall in love with each other instead? And what about Nicole's best friend - acid-tongued Alicia (Susan May Pratt) - will she throw a spanner into the works?

The ending may be somewhat predictable, and yet the film as a whole seems to be more than the sum of its parts. The characters are reasonably fleshed out and have complex overtones to their personalities, and the dialogue is reasonably clever in places. However, overall I found the film to be somewhat slow-moving and uninvolving. The problem is, a romantic comedy with artistic pretensions can aspire to become a piece of serious drama, but an ambitious teen movie ends up looking awkward because - let's face it - what is the serious equivalent?

Incidentally, I think Melissa should really stop playing teen roles. She may still have the pert little body and a perky voice, but she is not as fresh-faced as she used to be and it would be nice to see her play her age for a change in a more substantial role.",1104796800,25,3893,4.7400295420974885
1082171,3,6305761213,"Why did I buy this film? Cos it has a track by what used to be one of my fave bands for years on the soundtrack (Steps ""One For Sorrow""), I was interested to see if Melissa Joan Hart can do any other character apart from Clarissa and Sabrina (I grew up with this girl, and she can't), and for the Britney video to ""Drive Me Crazy"". Otherwise, I have a penchant for these rom-coms set in high schools.

I grew up watching Melissa in kids TV, first on Clarissa and then on Sabrina. When you're young, you don't really notice the acting, but in this, you really do notice how bad she is. Like most TV actors trying to move into movies, they don't really try too hard to move away from the character they've been playing for years. She goes through the motions, and most of her laughter, and OTT-ness is fake.

Another thing is most of the time, these movies have drop-dead gorgeous stars. Adrian Grenier?! Who is he exactly? He's not good-looking - or he doesn't appeal to me - and he's just not right for that role.

Ali Larter appears in this, the girl with the ever-changing hair colour, and the film actually looked up by having her in it. She's a great actress, and with the wacky hair colouring (every shade of pink, red and purple you can think of) and styles. It's worthwhile getting this movie purely for her.

The extras aren't up to much, apart from the Britney video - I love that song. You've got the usual theatrical trailer, various TV spots, and two music videos.

There's nothing special about this teen rom-com. It's never properly explained why the two main characters gave up speaking to each ""it's called junior high"", or why they were too shallow to even bother to keep up the friendship. If you like this sort of thing, it's good, but the storyline is getting a bit old and tired now.",1092009600,3,1804,4.389221556886228

1082208,3,6305761213,"Drave Me Crazy had the misfortune of arriving in a year when, as Roger Ebert noted, six or eight movies with the same plot were released. You know the one. Cute boy and adorable girl go to hell and back trying to get the perfect date for the prom, when we all know they are going to wind up with each other. So it's no surprise that Drive Me Crazy tanked, as they say. Even the most innocent teenagers had reached their cute quotient. That's too bad, because this movie may be the best of the lot, which is to say that it's pretty darn good, as opposed to really good.
Chase and Nicole [Adrian Greer and Melissa Joan Hart] grew up next door to each other. He lives with his Dad, who is widowed, and she with her Mother, who is divorced. As kids, they were best friends. When they hit adolescence, they drifted apart. She opted to become a model high school student with lots of normal friends. He became a rebel and a leader of the fringe group. Today she is on the planning committee for Centennial [at least the writers changed the big event from being just a prom]. He couldn't care less about such things. When he is dumped by his very attractive girlfriend and she fails to entice the local jock/hunk into inviting her to the party, Chase and Nicole join forces. They decide that they will pretend to be a couple. Surely this will get the attention of the real objects of their desires. Of course, we know different.
Everyone should recognize Melissa Joan Hart, who is TV's Sabrina, the Teenage Witch. She doesn't do any great acting stretches here, but she's awfully pleasant to watch. To quote another critic, she's on the fast track to becoming this generation's Doris Day. That's not Oscar-winning territory, but it's still a good place to be. With his dark good looks and those sleepy eyes, Adrian Greer makes a refreshing change from your usual clone-a-star types. He may not turn out to be ""A"" picture star material, but who knows? It's a fact he can act.
There are problems with Drive Me Crazy, but the star couple is not one of them. They're a great duo. The problems are with the script, which never ventures outside of its rather bland perspective. As a rebel, Chance is completely harmless, and his sudden transformation into Mr. Middle of the Road is not very believable. The minor characters are interesting, but nothing is done with them story-wise, except for Nicole's father. One day he realizes that he has truly neglected her. He takes her for a ride in his hot-air balloon. In midair, he hands her copy of Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, assuring her that it will help her understand him. She throws the book overboard. End of discussion. It's a clever scene and a wonderful way to show him [and us] just how much he needs to make up to her. A few more vignettes like this one would have really helped the movie. As it is, Drive Me Crazy makes for an enjoyable evening of very light entertainment which neither insults nor lowers your intelligence.",1016582400,2,2984,4.517560073937154

The turmoil of high school!
There is nothing like a perky film to encapsulate the teenage experience, filled with clichs, popularity contests and the traditional happy ending involving a school dance, where the camera pans back just as the couple shares a sweet kiss.
As a fan of John Hughes film, I'm always willing to give teen-comedies a try. Out of all the recent efforts, ""Drive me Crazy"" is by far my favorite. Well written with witty dialogue and a quick pace, the film struggles with a traditional teen film equation: Popular Girl has a dilemma and turns to Less-Than Popular Reject Guy to help her get out of her jam. After a series of comic episodes and a near tragedy (e.g. she thinks he likes someone else), the couple is united and true love realized. This film is a definite child of earlier efforts like ""Can't Buy Me Love"" (great film, actually). What I think sets this one apart? Melissa Joan Hart is completely believable as the popular girl with the heart of gold. The supporting cast is great- Chase (Adrian Grenier) has a cast of friends the likes of which haven't been seen since John Cusack appeared in ""Sixteen Candles"". The soundtrack is upbeat (you can't do better than the Donnas!), and it leaves you with that cornball, happy feeling as the final credits roll. Great work of cinema? Winner of the Venice Film Festival? Probably not, but if you're in the mood for something deliciously fluffy, you could definitely do worse.",999043200,2,1477,4.728682170542636

However, I must also say that I truly believe this was a good movie because it both hit the mark with what high school can be like yet it was different from many of the recent high school flicks that have been made.  It is different because neither character is chasing the other one and they are former friends rather than 2 people who know nothing of each other.  Also, even though Melissa Joan Hart's character is the popular, perky one, Adrian Greiner's character is not your typical ""loser"" character nor would I classify him as a loser.  He is not an academic nerd either, but a rebellious person who gets in some trouble.  That being said, I do have some beefs with the movie.  First, the ""falling for each other"" between Hart and Greiner doesn't develop as it should.  It also bothered me that neither one says how/what they feel even at the end.  The audience knows they are attracted to each other but they never say anything.  Also, this movie really should have been longer so that the story could have developed more, again especially the relationship between Hart and Greiner.

1082245,2,6305761213,"Ultimately this movie is a waste of time and money.  Melissa Joan Hart proves she cannot carry a movie (at least not until she improves her acting skills).  Her performance is plastic, flat, and totally lacking.  It's no different than anything she has done in the past.  Watch an episode of Clarissa and/or Sabrina and then this movie and there is no difference at all in her performance (except, perhaps that her clothes are more revealing).
""Drive Me Crazy"" doesn't seem to know where it wants to go as a story either (did Hart write the movie too?).  It meanders about, seemingly with no direction or purpose.  Is it going to be a satirical commentary on high school life?  Is it going to address the disappointments a young person faces when an absentee parent turns out to be a total flake?  Is it going to address the turmoil a young person feels when a loved one passes away?  WHAT?!  It doesn't have to serve any purpose other than to be a fun teen flick, but it should at least do that well.
The only redeeming quality of this movie is co-star Adrian Grenier.  He appears to be the only cast member who actually possesses any talent.
If you want to watch a movie that shows the struggle between cliques and and the social strata that is high school (and won't lead your brain cells to atrophy), you'd be far better off renting or purchasing ""Clueless"", ""Sixteen Candles"", or ""Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion"".",977702400,2,1427,4.578740157480315

1082248,4,6305761213,"Hardly a waste of time, DRIVE ME CRAZY isn't quite the movie it was marketed to be.  Though presented as a romantic comedy, this is a film essentially about cliques, and the almost tribal warfare that ensues between them.  More, it's about stepping outside the familiar and seeing what else there is to life.  To be sure you won't be magically transported by this film to some greater understanding of high school life.  But it does have the capacity to make you remember what it feels like to be in (a predominantly white, suburban American) high school.
Is it funny?  Well, it's no AMERICAN PIE.  There are moments of humor, but you won't be bustin' a gut, here.  It is, however, absolutely fun.  This is definitely a movie for those nights where you don't want to be challenged, but you equally don't want to be insulted by blatant stereotype.
Oh, yes, it IS a love story.  But it's the social commentary and the characters' felt angst along the way that makes you keep watching.  The acting in almost every case contributes greatly to this need to stay tuned.  Others have commented that Melissa Joan Hart is laughable here, but I don't see that.  She perfectly captures a girl on the cool side of preppy.
If there's anything unsatisfying here, it's that the tension which builds between the two leads never sees real resolution.  The pre-ordained ending simply happens.  Though that ending makes sense, we're missing about one scene of confrontation in which that resolution can be worked out.  Also, unlike AMERICAN PIE which is very clearly told from the perspective of teenagers, this film throughout feels as though it's made by adults trying to recreate their youths.  This makes the film somewhat purer and less offensive than AMERICAN PIE, but it does take a great deal of that frenetic, sexual `edge' off.
These qualifications aside, DRIVE ME CRAZY is still worth a look, and maybe even a ponder or two.

1082251,2,6305761213,"A friend told me that my review for this film is quoted on the video package--and that somehow I was seen as endorsing it. Here is the full  review from the Los Angeles Times:
 Regard with suspicion any movie named  after a song. It suggests there's not much to latch on to about the film in  question, so its handlers have tried to co-opt the persona of a popular  tune. ""Can't Buy Me Love"" and ""Something to Talk About""  both leap to mind.
 In the case of ""Drive Me Crazy,"" anyone  eligible to vote might not get the reference to the Britney Spears  song--and that's likely intentional. The movie, which stars Melissa Joan  Hart of TV's ""Sabrina, the Teenage Witch,"" will fall beneath  grown-up radar--and that's no great loss. Like the song, the movie is  bouncy and catchy but disposable pop  material.
 Hart stars as Nicole  Maris, a campus booster nonpareil. In with the popular crowd but still  remarkably wholesome, Nicole is organizing a sort of massive homecoming  dance to celebrate the centennial of Timothy Zonin High School a.k.a. Time  Zone High. Her next-door neighbor, Chase Hammond (Adrian Grenier), is the  kind of guy who pulls pranks on people like her and views high school as  nothing worth celebrating.
 Nicole gets jilted by her dream date and  Chase gets dumped by his tres political girlfriend. Guess what Nicole and  Chase do? Go ahead. Guess. OK, OK . . . they pretend they're dating to make  the other people jealous. And guess what happens? Go ahead. Guess.
 But  there's no point in being mean-spirited about a film like this. Slickly  directed (though full of TV-style close-ups) and tightly cut, it is  perfectly entertaining for 91 minutes. Like ""She's All That,""  ""Can't Hardly Wait"" and others before it, ""Drive Me  Crazy"" projects from the very beginning that nothing bad is going to  happen in this movie. ""Relax,"" it says, ""it's all good  here.""
 Adapted by TV writer Rob Thomas from the book ""How I  Created My Perfect Prom Date"" by Todd Strasser, ""Drive Me  Crazy"" is set in Utah, where somehow it is basketball season but also  swim-in-the-river weather. Other aspects of Time Zone High, however, feel  as real as home video, such as the drill squad and the morning student  news show.
 Whatever charisma Hart has on TV, the big screen dilutes it  tenfold. Director John Schultz, formerly a documentarian, does her no  favors by relying on the close-up. It's not that she's unattractive--it's  more that she's unexpressive. Grenier, whose floppy  curls and loping  stride suggest high school, even if his 5 o'clock shadow does not, has far  more charisma.
 Not surprisingly, the movie is hyper-aware of its own  soundtrack, even beyond the cut from Spears' absurdly platinum-selling  "" . . . Baby One More Time"" album. Don Philip,  Steps and the  Backstreet Boys--all notably on Jive Records--make musical appearances.  Music supervisors Tom Wolfe and Manish Raval appear to hijack the movie for  a short music video to the Backstreet Boys' ""I Want It That  Way.""
 ""Drive Me Crazy"" earns social points for giving the  unpopular characters far more personality than most of the in-crowd. Mark  Webber is Designated Dave, who  volunteers to drive kids home from  parties--kids who don't even know his last name. Kris  Park plays Ray, a  budding filmmaker who videotapes everything around him.
 The cool  kids--with one or two exceptions--aren't cruel. The film wants to side with  the underdog geeks, but can't then criticize their desires to be popular.  If the movie wants to have it both ways, that's easy to forgive. Remember,  it's all good here.
 If teens somehow get excited about ""Drive Me  Crazy,"" no harm done. But unlike, say, ""Sixteen Candles,""  this won't be a picture today's teens and preteens look back to later, with  even campy nostalgia. It'll drop from memory as quickly as Britney Spears  drops from the pop charts. That's got to happen soon, right?",966470400,2,3911,4.874617737003058

Similar to Can't Buy Me Love, where the popular girl transforms  the geeky guy and introduces him to the ""in crowd"". His motive  for giving in was slightly different than Can't Buy Me Love, but it moved  in the same direction. His geeky friends were left behind for his new  social life and in the end their ultimate plan backfires when they realize  they have fallen for each other. Of course telling you how it ends doesn't  spoil anything, since this movie was predictable, but it was fun watching  them prograss to that point.

But, as one watches  it they see that it tries hard to be part of the former group by making a  statement about the pointlessness of school spirit and conformity. Drive Me  Crazy could have been an interesting dark satire on high school, and for a  moment it veers into that catergory, but all too fast it falls victim to  fake character conflicts and horrible acting.

Of the three major teen staples, there is very little in the way of sex and drugs, but  plenty of rock and roll.  The story revolves around a girl and boy who are  next door neighbors.  Though they have known each other their whole lives,  they travel in very different circles at school.  She is very ""in"", popular  and active.  He is very ""out"", rebellious and counterculture.  When each of  them gets rejected by their love interests, they form an unlikely alliance  to make the rejecters jealous.  They pretend they are now dating, to the  amazement of all their friends.
But be careful what you wish for,  because you might get it.  Surprising to no-one in the audience, they  actually fall for one another.  This complicates matters when the scam  works and their respective love interests re-ignite and take up hot  pursuit.

The  ending is upbeat, and overall this is a feel good movie.  The acting, as is  always the case in these movies, was not so much acting as teens portraying  themselves.  Melissa Joan Hart has been playing a teenager since 1992, and  at 24 it is probably time to move on.  As probably the most experienced  actor in the film, she played the part very well and was one of the few  players who actually had to do some acting outside the stereotype.

The result,  two very opposite people falling for each other when that was not what they  wanted.",954720000,2,383,4.323943661971831
1082322,2,6305761213,"A 'very cute' story indeed. 'Drive Me Crazy' follows the story of Nicole (Melissa Joan Hart) who has just been dissed and dismissed by the high-school babe. So now she plans to win back her prom man by taking ugly loser Chase (Adrian Greiner) to centennial. Only to find out that she  starts falling in love with them and bla, bla you know the rest. HO-HUM.  Nothing big. Nothing great. Nothing exciting but something compared to  'Hanging Up' and some other movies.",954460800,,466,4.658536585365853
