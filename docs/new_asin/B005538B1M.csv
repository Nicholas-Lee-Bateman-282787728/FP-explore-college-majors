4571713,3,B005538B1M,"The show itself is great. A real labor of love from creator, producer, and star Allen Hawco. If you are a fan of THE ROCKFORD FILES, then this is the show for you. It has all the elements that made ROCKFORD such a long and enduring hit, only in Canada. So, the locales are beautiful but in a small, quirky town. It's sort of like ROCKFORD meets NORTHERN EXPOSURE. By all means,enjoy.

While the show is, without a doubt, five stars, I gave the transaction only three. You see, here in America, the DVD sets are way too expensive. I bought the first season from Amazon.ca for HALF the US price. In my haste,when I saw season two for sale, I hit the wrong button, forgetting to realize that I could get this same set, brand new and region one, for HALF THE PRICE from Amazon.ca. It's a mistake I won't make again.",1342396800,8,811,4.300653594771242

4571737,5,B005538B1M,"Very enjoyable series! The characters are fully developed and have their own quirky personalities. It is a fun private detective show mostly without guns. Fast cars. The series is set in New Foundland, and it looks like the USA with US cars, etc., but with buildings that look like they came out Doc Martin's town.

4571776,1,B005538B1M,"Beautiful scenery, but the plots/characters weren't engaging at all.  Not enough mystery, too much wink wink self regard by the lead actor.  You need to care about the characters to make a movie work, and the actors aren't given much in the way of dialogue or plots to create any interest.  Perhaps tying everything up in  each 45-50 minute episode is one reason.  Guess I'm spoiled by continuing-story BBC/HBO screenwriting.  This is going to the library as a donation.",1420675200,,470,4.886075949367089

4571779,5,B005538B1M,This is one heck of fun tv show.  The characters and setting are first rate.  The Eastern Coast of Canada is quite different from the west coast which is where most Canadian tv shows are filmed.  The picture is very good on the dvd set I have watched. There isn't a bad episode either.  This series should have been picked up in the states!  It would have done very well. It's just a well done show and it's rather fun to watch.  Many episodes are just about them working average cases to bigger cases.  The dvd has no extras.,1418256000,,526,4.252525252525253

4571781,5,B005538B1M,"As someone who writes mystery novels for a living I always worry when a television series that I like launches a new season. The reason: I know just how very hard it is to create a sequel that is equal to, or greater than, the first. With that in mind, I was a little worried when I started watching ""Republic of Doyle: Season 2"" because I so enjoyed the first season and its quirky Canadian family of investigators.
I shouldn't have worried, as it turns out, because the second season not only retains the action/humor/drama that made the first one so memorable but it does something more: It reveals unexpected depths in the various members of the Doyle family and those people associated with it. We learn, for example, that Des has deep secrets; that Malachy and Rose are capable of arguing and then forgiving one another and that Doyle, himself, is deeply conflicted over his feelings for not one but two women.
To top it all off, there is a heart-wrenching twist in the season finale that makes me want to see the third one to learn just how it plays out.
I can't think of a better recommendation than that.",1413590400,3,1113,4.514851485148514
4571782,5,B005538B1M,"If you've come to this review the right way - but searching for the title - you should already have seen Season One of this fun detective series produced for Canadian TV - and released on DVD by RLJ under their Acorn imprint.  (If not, I highly suggest that you start with Season One.). So you know the Doyles and at least a few of the women in Jake Doyle (played by Allan Hawco, who is also the Executive Director). A few new women come into his life in the 13 episodes in this season.
I loved Season One a lot - see my review on Amazon - not because of the crimes being solved but the interaction of Jake and his dad and his brother - who gets more time this season. I also fell in love with the scenery. The show is filmed in St. John Newfoundland and often filmed right on the streets of the quaint Canadian Martime province. So much so, that I recently returned from a cruise which stopped in Newfoundland (but, unfortunately in Corner Brook, not in St. Johns)
Eaxch episode in this season has a new crime for the Doyles to solve and they always do. But the crimes are not important. It's the way you take Jake, his family - both blood and extended -into your hearts that matters. At the end of Season Two, some loose ends are tied up - but a few new ones will carry over to Season 3. (Yes, the series goes on - for a few more seasons, but there is no date set yet for the US release. I can wait, I know it's coming).

Each episode runs about 45 minutes because the commercials have been deleted. But - even though it aired on Canadian commercial TV - there is graphic violence (I'd call it moderate) as well as some explicatives (mostly the s-word).
The DVD has bonuses too. There are three - not very important - behind the scenes featurettes (8 minutes total) that show how they rig explosions and car crashes. There are also full length episode commentaries on three of the episodes. (I have not watched those yet).

So, if you've seen Season One and liked it, I highly recommend Season Two. And this is the kind of show that is even more fun when binge-watching 2-3 episodes at a time. A few do have cliff-hangers that will keep you going.
See, no real spoilers - they are no fun with a mystery series.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

4571783,4,B005538B1M,"Delightful and exciting.  The interplay between and among the characters in this series makes for a pleasant time of entertainment.  Nothing too serious, but lots of humor and interesting situations.",1412208000,,199,5.6
4571794,5,B005538B1M,"Great mystery with much comedy slipped between case clues. Jake's (Allan Hawco) romantic tendencies cause him problems. Jake takes a lot of fists and drives a beautiful blue GTO. There's always family related subplots and many carry from one episode to another. Characters are well defined and acted, with a set backdrop of gorgeous St John's Newfoundland. Season 6 is in preparation, so plenty more ""Republic of Doyle"" to come in DVD form. Another GREAT Canadian production.

Sgt Leslie (Krystin Pellerin) is a blonde cop that tickles the romantic fancy of Jake, as does the new gal Allison (Michelle Nolden). The PI Agency includes Pop Malachy (Sean McGinley), his sig-other Rose (Lynda Boyd), Malachy's granddaughter Tinny (Marthe Bernard) and her heart-throb and adopted assistant PI Des (Mark O'Brien) who in my opinion deserves a special funny man award. There are more, and they combine to make a super series team.

SDH SUBTITLES in English for all episodes plus bonus of FX/stunts.
<1> Live and Let Doyle ==A mailman kidnapped in front of the Doyles. The quest could involve national security; plus Jake has a new romantic twist.
<2> Popeye Doyle == Jake's in jail. Can he find a necklace thief among his cell mates? Rose keeps a secret while Tinny earns $$. Guest star Gordon Pinset (Wing at my Back).
<3> A Stand Up Guy == A comedian is getting messages not so funny. Leslie & Allison both have revealing issues.
<4> The Son Also Rises ==Doyle's know the prime suspect of a murder. Tinny digs deeper into her basement farming scheme.
<5> Something Old, Something Blue ==Who's sabotaging the coming wedding? Why? Mal/Rose & Jake/Allison hit Doyle relationships hurdles, plus a Des/Tinny thingy.
<6> The Ryans and the Pittmans ==Daughter of a family friend missing at sea seems like a whale-of-a-tale. Doyles go fishing for the truth.
<7> Crashing on the Couch ==A `shrink' loses it in public. Jake looks from the inside-out.
<8> Sympathy for the Devil ==Rose's ex gets the PI Co. into bounty hunting for a big payoff. Nonstop LOL funny episode.
<9> Will the Real Des Courtney Please Stand Up? ==Doyle's PI firm must look into the case of one of their own. Des shines in this episode. Very good episode indeed.
<10> The Special Detective ==Jake trailed again by a crime fiction writer while he digs deeper into murder and his love associates. Guest star Victor Garber (Sleepless in Seattle).
<11> Don't Gamble with City Hall ==The cards are dealt with robbery, blackmail, drugs, lappers, and conspiracy. The chips fly with Jake, Allison, Sgt. Leslie, the mayor, judge, & Feds.
<12> St. John's Town ==Developments at a new housing development gets the Doyle's hired. Leslie uncovers St. John's Mayor and Jake gets propositioned. Jonny Harris (Murdock Mysteries) guest stars.
<13> Family Business ==A kidnapping of Tinny & Des forces Jake to deal with a dangerous past relationship. Relationships teeter until Series 3 is released.",1410739200,2,2938,4.993877551020408

4571798,5,B005538B1M,"This Season is just as good as the first season.  Now Jake is divorced and he's jumping from women to women, but still not committing, and still seeing his ex-wife.  However, he's met his match with Leslie (played by Krystin Pellerin) who's a police officer.  The Doyle's (father and son) take on any case from stackers, jail breakers, runaway brides and bikers using clever old school detective work.  It's funny , charming, and they always seem to end the episode with a pint at the Duke (the local pub).  New faces join the show; old ones pop in and out.",1404518400,,557,4.53
