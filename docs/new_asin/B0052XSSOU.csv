4532705,1,B0052XSSOU,"I had been forewarned, but I had to see it for myself.  There was an interesting plot here, but the movie has a ""homemade"" video feel to it that is part of the plot.  There should have been consequences here, but the makers of the movie went for a happily ever after style.  The plot wasn't logical.  The characters aren't likeable, just plain.  For a movie that showed us about doing wrong, it chose to tell us what they did right at the end.  I was so disappointed with the movie that had I been a producer of this movie, I would have worked in an ending that included everyone dying.  That is how bad this movie is, just plain awful.",1327795200,,636,4.206611570247934
4532706,1,B0052XSSOU,"The plot sounded interesting... The movie itself is just terrible. Lowest video quality, the story has entirely too many holes in it, doesn't make sense half the time. Takes more than half of the movie to actually get to the point... I stopped watching twenty minutes to the end - couldn't suffer through it any longer.",1325203200,,319,4.714285714285714
4532707,2,B0052XSSOU,"Blackmail Boys is a gay-themed drama in which we get to see every inch of the three main actors, including erections. But, unfortunately, that is the only thing that could possibly make this movie of any interest. The script, acting, and direction are pretty dull. The pace is very slow, yet the film is only 67 minutes. That is not good. I'd say that this is worth seeing only for those that want to see some male nudity from ""average"" guys.",1318896000,4,442,4.469135802469136
4532708,1,B0052XSSOU,"The film is watchable but  not to  buy unless you want to resell it after watching it. The sex is very very mild  and only in a few scenes. A brief scene of an  erection  is the only  bit of  strong sex otherwise it is tame stuff. The worst aspect of the film is the dreadful shakey hand held camera. Can't the  photographer  learn how to film without  ruining the film. If you like seeing a film with many scenes shot as though there was an earthquake going on, then you will  like the  film. Would have given the film a higher rating if the camera  wasn't shaking a lot. - ruind the film for me. Very amateurish filming.",1316822400,2,622,4.126050420168068
4532709,2,B0052XSSOU,"If you buy this film (DVD) based on the Shumanski name, and were looking forward to a film, as creative and cutting edge as their other film `Wrecked' save your money. This title should be rented only, if you buy it, my guess is you will only watch it once.  If you are a hard core Shumanski fan, you might watch it twice.",1316390400,6,322,4.111111111111111
4532710,3,B0052XSSOU,"This is another film from the Shumanski brothers, the makers of `Wrecked'<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wrecked/dp/B002PCVLX6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wrecked</a>. Now if you thought that was good you may find some merit in this their latest offering. It stars Nathan Adloff and Joe Swanberg  who play boyfriends separated by college but still trying to make it work Aaron finally visits Sam in Chicago and finds that he is turning tricks for money. After Sam came out to his parents he was cast adrift from them , leaving him to fend for himself. He is trying to pay his way through art school. Aaron has a supportive family, yet we don't see any offers of fiscal help coming from him - despite the fact they want to get married.

They decide to blackmail one of Sam's clients after they discover he is not at all what he has claimed to be with Sam. There is a bit of morality tussling around the blackmail thing, but they seem to decide that two wrongs can sometimes make a right, but without actually articulating as much. So they set about doing the filming (on a mobile phone!) and then go about executing their plan.

It is filmed using hand held not so steady cam, and this gives it that fly on the wall feel. Add to that, the pieces to camera from Sam which are done in an interview style, this then has a feeling of docudrama. The soundtrack is not too bad and the use of real as to opposed studio locations I liked, but this was clearly done on a cost saving basis rather than an artistic one.

There are scenes of drug taking, various depictions of sex and one or two `old chap' shots, if you follow. It is not the full on `sexy' roller coaster that the sleeve sort of hints at though. There is a bit of on screen chemistry between Aaron and Sam, but not enough to carry what is in essence a rather thin plot. At 69 minutes long this is a short film, and with some slow scenes possibly could have been shorter. That said you do get interminable trailers for more TLA releases so that takes it up to the two hour mark but in an altogether disagreeable way. Still a reasonable effort but it is just OK and by no means one to watch a second time.",1313539200,8,2195,4.507537688442211

8454687,2,B0052XSSOU,"Along with other commenters, I'm afraid that the best I can say about this movie is that it was nice to see some male nudity, brief though it was.  The acting was pretty atrocious, wooden, hollow and essentially just plain lacking across the board.  Even Joe Swanberg, who usually turns in a fairly convincing performance was off in this one.  When I first read about this movie, I thought the story sounded interesting and worth a look see, but it wasn't and the ending was just plain nonsensical.  If you want to see the actors' full frontal shots, just google them and pass on this movie.",1444780800,,591,4.547169811320755
8454688,3,B0052XSSOU,"I'm a fan of Joe Swanburg, so rented this. It's a silly picture, but there is a graphic gay sex scene with Joe (he's straight) and another ""actor"", so I guess it was worth the few bucks.",1430956800,,186,4.054054054054054

8454690,3,B0052XSSOU,just an okay movie...if you are bored and have nothing else to watch...go for it...but not the best just okay at best,1394668800,,117,4.363636363636363
8454691,1,B0052XSSOU,The men in the movie are not hot and the story was lame.  I would not suggest this movie to anyone.,1377820800,,99,3.7142857142857144
8454692,4,B0052XSSOU,I have seen many better movies and I have seen many worse movies. But that makes it interesting right??If this is your kind of film than it will entertain. The actors  were ok as were the production values. Nicer plot too.,1366416000,,222,4.414634146341464
8454693,3,B0052XSSOU,"Was not bad, was not great.  I watched with an open mind and did not find the movie or the plot hard to figure out or follow,  however if you are expecting a high budget movie with well crafted actors you will not like this one. If you saw and liked ""Wrecked"" you will probably like this movie, if you are looking to be entertained for an hour and 10 minutes this movie does the trick.",1331251200,,385,4.052631578947368
