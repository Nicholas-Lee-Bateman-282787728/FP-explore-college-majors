8387400,5,B0032DA43U,I watch all kinds of anime and I enjoy this one a lot. I really like the story and plot also it's a great romance anime especially the last episode it was touching.,1392595200,,164,4.0
8387401,3,B0032DA43U,"Starts out strong, but too many distractions in the storyline to be cohesive.  Plot is simple enough to defeat 3 strong enemies, but the 1st and the 2nd were almost immediate.  The 3rd was hard, but the buildup wasn't there due to the focus of the underlying love plots.

Characters were cute.  The goddess and the 2 best friends.  The little sister and even the dad.  Alot of focus on relationships, but in hesitating middle school fashion.  Was a little disappointed.

Good entertainment though.",1366502400,,497,4.833333333333333

8387403,3,B0032DA43U,The video is good with the storyline of a goddess and spirits. The action is good with the romantic sense.,1347840000,,106,4.35
