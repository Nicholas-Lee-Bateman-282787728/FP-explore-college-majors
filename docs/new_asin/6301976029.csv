408646,4,6301976029,"I thought Yul Brynner gave an excellent performance as the Cossack leader Taras Bulba.  The part was made for him.  I wish he had been in the film more, and Tony Curtis less. Franz Waxman received his 12th Academy Award  nomination for the score.  It is great! Although the quality of the film is  a bit uneven, it has 'The Ride to Dubno' in it, which is one of the most  powerful and striking scenes I have ever seen in a movie.  The movie is  worth buying just to have that scene.",915408000,8,482,4.163043478260869

Yul Brenner and Tony Curtis were superb. However the very end with the Cossacks fight scene with the Poles was too quick with a hard to believe forced ending.

409047,5,6301976029,Yul Brynner's best movie!,1465171200,,25,5.5
409048,4,6301976029,"Taras Bulba was conceived as a big screen epic, the type of movie that got people away from their TV's, which simply couldn't  compete in scope with the big screen. Unusually, it was not set in Ancient Rome or the American West but in the Ukraine, depicting a historical event that  Americans knew little to nothing about. Since the 1300's a dynastically united Poland and Lithuania ruled a huge area from the Baltic almost to the Black Sea. The enemy was generally Turkey, and so the Ukraine, inhabited by the Cossacks among others, became an area of contention. Taras Bulba takes place in the 1500's as Poland  incorporates the area as a formal province of the kingdom despite the Cossacks' opposition.

Originally the film was to be directed by Robert Aldrich, who had specified that Yul Brynner not be hired;  but he was forced to sell the rights to a group of buyers who included Yul Bryner, so guess who got the role. That was one of the film's lucky breaks, because this was a role Brynner was born to play; who was Aldrich thinking of anyway? Because the United Artist film was planned as a major release, it had to have a major star in the role of Bulba's son, Andrei. This was 1961, so there was no question of anyone but a Hollywood star playing the role. Originally it was going to be Burt Lancaster, but he decided not to do it and Tony Curtis ended up in the role against the wishes of Yul Brynner. This is one of the problems in the film. Though he plays it with full commitment, Tony Curtis just doesn't give off even a hint of being a 16th century Cossack. They might as well have hired Cary Grant.  With new director J. Lee Thompson fresh off the success of The Guns of Navarone, they trucked off to the Andes foothills of Argentina near Salta to shoot the film.

What  resulted is a mixed affair. The movie almost splits itself into two distinct parts, one thrilling and one boring. All the outdoor scenes are exciting and excellent, with vast panoramas of horses and men gathering and in battle, including the justifiably famous ""Ride to Dubno"" in which Yul Brynner and a few horsemen eventually add others until thousands of horses and riders fill the screen. There are also fun-filled scenes of Cossacks drunkenly celebrating, which echo the spirit of the painting behind the opening credits (a version of a famous Cossack painting by Ilya Repin). These are the high points of the film. But the rest of the film mostly takes place on a cleanly swept sound stage version of Kiev and concerns the forbidden love between Cossack peasant Andrei and a beautiful Polish Princess, Natalia (Christine Kaufman).

That's where the problems of the film lie. The script is dull and everything in it is a cliche from the Polish students' hazing of Andrei and his brother to the love affair itself. Christine Kaufman is given so little to say or do that all she is left with is standing around looking sweet. The romance should be full of incendiary passion, since it forces Andrei into a terrible dilemma, but instead we're left wondering at his motivation after a single pleasant day in the country. The Poles are painted as the blackest of  villains, which is typical of films but unfair to them. Oddly, the film reverses the usual conflict formula of film, where the audience generally is given to root for the forces of civilization over barbarism. Here we are given the relatively barbaric Cossacks as the heroes, despite the fact that when not fighting, they seem to only indulge in drunken carousing, and the relatively civilized Poles as the bad guys. the film is careful to show that the wild-looking Cossacks are Christians.

So what you end up with is an unsatisfying film with sequences that are really exciting. Fortunately there are enough of the good parts to make the film watchable. The film is buoyantly supported by one of the most famous scores in film history. Franz Waxman's score received a deserved Academy Award nomination (but lost to Lawrence of Arabia. But who could have beaten that?). The score is almost a character in its own right and really keeps things moving.",1464393600,7,4104,4.662517289073306

409054,5,6301976029,"Way under rated. Seen Taras Bulba when it was released in 1962 in Bay Shore, New York. Brand New Movie Theater, at time largest indoor screen in Country. I was 12 and by myself, theater was empty.  This movie touched me like no other would,  I was Andrei in this movie. I was a changed boy when the movie was over. In later years I bought this on Laser Discs, Good Picture, Great Sound,  changing discs ruins the movie, plus it seemed slowed down at times & looked fake. Bought DVD next, China Release, real bad. Well I no longer felt the same about this movie, Including like most reviews Tony Curtis was wrong choice for Andrei. I have to believe though in 1962 most people Loved Tony Curtis & did not care. Worst part of script to me was Andre wounded. Back & Forth, Wound Serious, to acting like nothing wrong. Another serious wound in Battle. Couple days later He Feels Great and fights Taras again. They show him with no shirt on & not a mark on his body.  Couple days ago I ordered the Blu-ray, because of what has happened to The Time Machine with Rod Taylor. I kept the movies on Wish List, planning on buying both if price came down. Time machine has been discontinued, now selling $49.00 - 129.00. I could see it happening to Taras, so I ordered it, not sure I would even enjoy it anymore. Surprised Me, much better than expected, and truly enjoyed it. The story itself is awesome. The Scope, the mass of actors & horses. the colors. No One Could Replace Yul Brenner. The Love between Tony &  Christine at the time was real in & off the screen.  Your Home Land being stolen & then taken back. The power Love Can Be, for True Love  ,for Land, for a way of Life.  Buy The Blu-ray",1457654400,,1688,4.286163522012578

409128,4,6301976029,"This is one of the few movies ever made that portrays Cossacks in a positive light. It's based on a folktale in which a Cossack father kills his son for betraying the Cossack Brotherhood -- a Romeo & Juliet tale that ends quite as badly as Shakespeare's original.

The riding is marvelous, they got the swords and guns mostly right, and the costuming is impeccable. I feel that it really captures the spirit of the Cossacks. They have a great deal in common with the early American settlers and those who pushed America west. That said, I feel the movie is just a trifle forced despite a great performance by Yul Brynner as Taras Bulba and an adequate one by Tony Curtis as his son Andrei.

I like the fact that it does not show the Cossacks as the Jew-murderers Hollywood virtually reserves that role for. (I asked my grandfather about this once, and he snorted with amusement. There were a couple of Jewish families in his village, he said, one of them the village moneylender, and they were treated just like anyone else, invited to parties, and were allowed to speak in town meetings when anything affecting the whole village was discussed, same as everyone else. Hardly sounds like pogrom material to me.) Instead, they are shown as a surprisingly democratic society, bound to each other by blood and honor, demanding and getting respect. And heaven help any who backstab them! They'd fit right in with rural America, even today.

If you enjoy cavalry charges in the old tradition, and watching characters evolve, you'll like this film. But as I said, there is just a little hoke in the romance department that you may find it annoying.",1453766400,2,1641,4.690972222222222

The son is played by Tony Curtis, hence plenty of derring-do and hairbreadth escapes ensue. These do not mesh well with the essentially tragic theme of the novel, which to its credit this film retains.

409334,3,6301976029,"This was the second of Yul Brynners three epic turkeys for UA Studios. At the time Solomon & Sheba was famous for being the film that killed Tyrone Power. Taras was known as the film that killed Tony Curtis marriage when he fell in love with his co-star. And Kings Of The Sun marked the death of Brynners careeer as a viable box office leading man. He then became a guest star in other peoples epics.

For all the publicity garnered about the off-screen love affair between Curtis and leading lady, Christine Kauffman, little of that romance failed to make it to the screen, at least to this viewer. There is absolutely no heat to their scenes together, even their chaste kisses seem perfuntory..

The film was ostensibly based on the Gogol novel. I never read it, so I cannot make any comparisons. Not that it matters to me: a film has to stand on its own merits. This one does not do a good job. Even at only a little over two hours, its rough going.

The plot tells about the Cossack Nations war on Poland over the Steppes. This promises an action packed epic, but none of this really takes place until the last thirty minutes or so. The boring and unconvincing romance just about does the film in. The bad dialogue (by Waldo Salt and Karl Turnberg of all people) doesnt help either. Yul Brynner could certainly hold that screen with presence plus, but his declamatory style of delivery becomes a drag very quickly. Curtis looks tired - and he looks his age. In real life, he was only five years younger than Brynner, but he plays his university age son. He was about fifteen years too old for the part. The sets seem to have been made out of cardboard and spit. Everything has a phoney look to it. The director, J. Lee Thompson, by that time famous for the terrific Tiger Bay thriller and the colossal box office hit, The Guns Of Navarone should have stayed away from this creaky old material, but instead clunked on this one and later on with Kings Of The Sun.

Most people seem to be of the opinion that the best thing about this movie is the music score by Franz Waxman. It pounds away trying to breathe life to a film that just lies there as limp as an over cooked noodle, until the last half hour. By then its too little too late. The one thing that impresses today is that the battle scenes involving what seems to be the entire Argentinian army (the film was shot on the Pampas) have not one bit of CGI over-the-top graphics. The thousands of men and horses onscreen are no computer drawings. The trouble that must have gone to feed and clean up must have been gargantuan. Unfortunately, they should have put that effort into the stilted script.

The Blu-Ray DVD is quite nice - no grain shows up in the process shots. The soundtrack unfortunately is not Stereo - even in those days it was unusual for a movie of that size to have a Mono track, but that was UAs practice at the time. (This was also true of their The Vikings and The Big Country). Lovers of old fashioned epics might still enjoy this, but most others may want to go the rental route.

THREE STARS (Its OK) for the mucic score, the Blu-Ray quality and the reasonable price.",1425686400,3,3149,4.402061855670103

Yul Brynner plays the title character with great bravado and charisma with his unique and appealing mannerisms and screen presence. Composer Franz Waxman's score is one of his most rousing and haunting and is truly the centerpiece of this curious film. Waxman's score beautifully captures the magnificence of the Cossacks as they ride with gathering momentum across the screen and equally captures the obsessive nature of the love affair between Tony Curtis and Christine Kaufmann. Director J. Lee Thompson's flair for impressionistic storytelling is quite evident. There are many indelible images that the viewer can take away from this film. Norma Koch's costumes, Edward Carrere's art designs, Joseph MacDonald's cinematography and Franz Waxman's brilliant score again all contribute to the enduring nature of this underrated film.",1415059200,,1026,5.54140127388535

I remember being a very young and deeply impressionable boy, staying up past my bedtime and watching this wonderful movie on our old black and white TV.  How I loved it!  I think the honor and love depicted in the movie affected me the most.  Of course the adventurous story was great!  Even as a child I always thought that a better actor than Tony Curtis would have been better in his crucial role.  I thought the same for his role in another of my all time favorites, the Vikings.  But he was very very popular at that time.  I mean look at his part in probably one of my top 5 films of all time as well.  Spartacus!  He was getting so very many of the real plum jobs at that time.

Russian-born Yul Brynner played (with his usual intensity) a Cossak detemined to fight off the Polish overlords. Tony Curtis (with his usual quiet style) played the eldest son who has divided loyalties since falling in love with a young beauty of Polish nobility (the winsome German actress Christine Kauffman who would marry Curtis -- and divorce him after about 3 or 4 years).

I found this pretty boring with the only relief provided by Christine's beauty -- however she has almost nothing to do.

This movie appears stuck in the afore mentioned rut and no amount of ""Star Power"" can pull it out,(not Yul Brynner, and/or Tony  Curtis), or pretty scenery or horseback swordplay can change it.

This movie is about 30 to 45 minutes too long to be boring.  There are many nicely filmed cavalry charges, (do forged steel sword blades sound like aluminum blades when struck together? Perhaps some sound effect improvement are also needed.).  Yul Brynner sings something `Kazaky' sounding and it doesn't help The special effects for making the hole in Tony Curtis's Breast Plate armor was nicely understated and it doesn't help.  The Kazaks don't loot the city after they defeat those bad Poles (that dealt with them treacherously) and it doesn't help.  What might help is re-editing the entire flick.

409721,3,6301976029,"Taras Bulba is the entertaining, 1962 film adaption of Nikolai Gogol's short novel. The film is based on the revolts of the Zaporozhian Cossacks against their Polish overlords, which began in the early 17th century.

Yul Brynner is simply outstanding as the Cossack hetman. He was born for the part. Tony Curtis is a bit stiff as the son who turns against his father and his people for a Polish damsel. A Ukrainian Cossack with a Brooklyn accent? Ridiculous. German actress, Christine Kaufmann, plays the love interest, Polish noblewoman, Natalia Dubrov. What a beautiful girl! In real life, 37-year-old Curtis divorced actress Janet Leigh to marry his 17-year-old co-star.

Director J. Lee Thompson does a decent job on this film, one of those Hollywood blockbuster historical epics of the late-50's and early 60's. The scene where Brynner breaks into song is a bit annoying but par for the course for Hollywood films at that time. Another scene, where Curtis and a rival Cossack jump their horses over a narrow chasm in an equestrian duel, is an absolute hoot.

This movie was one of my favorites growing up in the 60's. I wouldn't miss it whenever it came on television. But, being Polish American, I was bit annoyed that the Poles were cast as the bad guys.

Like most films based on historical events, Taras Bulba takes some liberties. The Ukrainian conquerers enter the Polish city of Dubno at the end of the movie promising a reign of magnanimity and liberty for all. However, history records that the Zaporozhian Cossacks slaughtered 100,000 Jews during the most famous of the revolts,  the Chmielnicki Uprising, which began in 1648. A number of Jews worked as agents of the Polish magnates and were deeply resented by the Ukrainian peasantry.

For the Polish perspective on the Chmielnicki Uprising, read ""With Fire and Sword"" by Henryk Sienkiewicz or see the same-titled Polish film, available on DVD and starring drop-dead gorgeous Polish actress, Izabella Scorupco.",1281139200,2,1977,5.012195121951219

While I don't know much about the Cossacks, one has to imagine that theirs was a tremendously different culture that what most viewers would recognize. This is left more or less undeveloped by the script, except to make sure we know that those Cossacks, they boozed it up a lot.

The love story between Curtis and the Polish girl is just sort of silly: love at first sight, etc., etc. The very odd soft-focus glaucoma-effect photography doesn't help. In fact, it comes across as laughable now.

The action pieces are unsatisfactory as well. I will say that there are probably as many horses used in this picture as in any movie I've ever seen, so that's quite a spectacle. But just many (MANY) minutes of horses and their riders tearing across the landscape does not an exciting action scene make.

This story could probably be retold by a director not afraid to explore a stangely different culture, and with a more complete vision of how to tell an exciting story. I'm giving it 3 stars simply because of Brynner and the fact that the effort was put forth.",1261785600,,1324,4.669527896995708

The film does not provide a historical background or even attempt to explain the socio-political realities of 17th century Ukraine, but uses the opportunity to heave opprobium on the Poles, who are treated with some understanding and respect in the novel by Gogol. The film includes situations that may add effect to the film, but are not part of the book - such as Bulba hacking off the Polish colonel's hand at the beginning of the film, the attempt of Andrei's classmates to castrate him, the idiotic ""duel"" between Andrei and another Cossack, which involves jumping a gorge, and the equally silly ""picnic"" scene with the young Polish lady and Andrei making pitiful attempts at folk dancing (the very premise of that scene is ridiculous to begin with). These scenes only cheapen the film; there are a few good scenes for Brynner, Kauffman and Curtis, but they are not enough to save it.

All in all, it's a lot of fun to watch. Utterly cliche-ridden and unshamedly so, the action is carried by the dynamic presence of Yul Brynner and Franz Waxman's brilliant score, which make even the obligatory
exotic-dancers-around-the-camp-fire scenes tolerable.

And, of course, there are the battles scenes, which are astounding in their sheer size and scope, and all accomplished years before computerized gimmickry! (I am assuming that the walled city of Dubno was built for the film somewhere in the Argentinian pampas); the violent and frenetic battle scene where the Poles retreat into the city is
worth the price of the film alone! (But it pains me to watch the relentless horse-trippings---this film MUST have set a record).

In ways Taras Bulba resembles ""The Pride and the Passion"" of 1957;  both were based on literary works, both were filmed on location in foreign countries, both featured scenes of amazing spectacle along with casts of
big-named stars, some of whom may have been slightly miscast (ie: Tony Curtis and Frank Sinatra), and both films were IMMEASURABLY enhanced by their terrific musical scores.

If you can endure the ""CHEESE""-factor, Taras Bulba is really very enjoyable. Brynner at his best, the all-too rare, superb villainy of Guy Rolfe, wonderful old Vladimir Sokoloff's last role, Paul Frees's robust voice-dubbing, (unfortunaely, George MacReady is totally wasted in a brief role), a beautiful Polish Christmas Carol sung by a superb studio men's chorus, etc etc.

Too bad about the army of dummies used in the film's big climatic battle.
Scores of floppy, rubbery, disjointed soldiers and horses hurtle off a cliff into a ravine, bouncing every which way as they slam against the rocks;  I recall the audience howling with glee when I first saw the film in the theater.

Also no doubt that the fight between the Polish Imperial Crown vs. the Cossacks was a commendable and patriotic cause for the mostly Ukranian Cossacks when Kiev, Ukraine was a Polish city. However this story creates a perception of an abusive giant vs. the small Cossacks representing the underdog. Although part of this maybe true, the fight between the vastly smaller Poland vs. the Ukraine and Russia of gigantic proportions not to mention its superior numbers in population, armies, both Cossack and non-Cossack is as realistic as a fight between a midget and colossal giant. And there is no way ""the midget"", no matter how ""imperial"" he may be is going to win the fight at the long run simply due to the fact that the smaller in territory and population, Poland vs. Russia the former will always be vastly outnumbered by the latter. Whenever the latter was the loser and it did happened a few times in history, is because they did not want to pursue that particular war any further and let it go as it was for the time being.

As an adult, this film is more than a bit silly in places (particularly the strangely inappropriate musical interludes) and Tony Curtis is hardly convincing as a Cossack, but while the dialogue is often corny and the acting largely sub-par, it succeeds as spectacle, especially in the Ride to Dubno.  The theme of Nikolai Gogol's story is still a strong one, although this is hardly a straightforward adaptation of the book.  (Gogol's story begins with Andrei's return from Kiev, about 45 minutes into the movie.  Also in the book, Andrei and Natalia never meet in person.

UKRAINIANS and their cossack ancestors are not RUSSIANS - they are RUSYNS, not to be confused with their so-called similiar northern kin and centuries old enemeies, the MUSCOVITE RUSSIANS. The latter would want you to believe that the Ukrainians are Russian so that they can keep the land that is wealthy of natural resources for themselves, for they usurped the title of KIYIV-RUS and called themselves RUSSIANS and tried many brutal campaigns of assimilation to destroy Ukrainian identity. Also, you do not place ""THE"" in front of UKRAINE - it's a country, not a region of Muscovy Russia. You do not say ""THE BELOROSIA"", ""THE POLAND"", ""THE CROATIA"", ""THE ITALY"", ""THE ISRAEL"", get the idea now?

Going back to the movie, it depicts Ukrainian cossack warriors in the 16th century, not the 18th century and is supposed to be parallel to the life and times of the famous Ukrainian Hetman BOHDAN KHMELNITSKIY.

Added to that is the fantastic horseback battle scenes on the Steppes. Those alone deserve 5 stars.

The story of Taras Bulba had the potential to be a great historical epic had it focussed on Taras' struggle between his love for the Cossack way of life and that for his son. Unfortunately, given the box office requirements of the time, the studio execs decided to toss in a cheesy love story (complete with fuzzy close-ups) and Tony Curtis, with his matinee-idol hair-do untouched. That just jars you out of the period. According to his biography, Brynner worked long and hard to bring the character to life, but broke down when he saw the final cut.

First appearances are deceiving. This has nicely produced sleeve and disc artwork (despite the typos) but things go downhill when the disc goes into the player. The picture quality has deteriorated and it bears all the hallmarks of a second or third generation dub from tape. The menus are amateurish. It looks like it's been lifted from a TV broadcast or from a second-rate projection (track-marks across the screen from high contrast areas, weak colour and clearly visible texture and flaws in the projection screen). It's certainly watchable but a very far cry from the sort of quality we've all come to expect from DVD and DVD prices. It does run the full, uncut 122 minutes so if you're a collector and fan of the film then I'd recommend it to round out your catalogue. Copies are still to be had on e-Bay. If you're a videofile looking for a mint print then this one isn't for you. My old MGM VHS copy is far superior in both picture and sound but at least the DVD version provides a more stable copy that is less prone to damage. Be prepared to be disappointed.

The story is of the warrior Cossacks of the Russian steps. They are acknowledged to be the finest cavalry in the world. The Poles seek their help and the Cossacks bring victory, only to be betrayed. The Poles turn on the Cossacks and take their land to create a buffer with Russia. As a result, the Cossacks go into hiding for a time. They emerge when the danger seems past and the Polish universities are opened to the Cossacks. Taras Bulba sends his sons to school to learn all they can in the hope of eventually being able to defeat the Poles. Naturally, a love story and divided loyalties intervene.

Yul Brynner plays the title role of the Cossack leader, Taras Bulba. His is the outstanding performance of the film. His exaggerated, larger than life gestures make the character into something more than a wooden figure.

Tony Curtis plays the son. Some people seem to be distressed because his New York accent detracts from the character. I did not find this any more distracting than the notion that ancient Romans all spoke with British accents. Curtis does a credible but not stellar job.

409899,3,6301976029,"I saw this movie in the theatre when I was a kid and even then I was slightly angered by the slams on Poles in it... but in some ways, I guess I could understand too, and anyway, I remember liking it, I never forgot it.  This movie's lost in a time warp though - it seems like it was made in 1942 not 1962.  I enjoyed it even with all the horses running in it, over & over.  And over.  The highlight for me was the close up of Richard Rust as Captain Alex - as far as I'm concerned, he outswaggered the other Moonchild in the movie, Yul.  I watched this on a Saturday afternoon, I own it, and I recommend it for lazy Saturday viewing.  Who's prettier than Tony Curtis??  Well, I'd say Richard Rust, but actually,  nobody (maybe Tyrone Power.)  Taras Bulba's a film for many people for many reasons!",1104710400,2,798,4.12987012987013
409940,5,6301976029,As a young boy I loved this movie. Although I don't remember much of it I'd really like to see it come back as a DVD. I'd buy it in a second to add to my growing collection of what I term as classics.  This was a wonderful movie.  I just remember as I watched it I myself became a Cossack riding horseback as they did.  Please someone put this on DVD!,1094515200,9,351,3.8472222222222223
409941,3,6301976029,"Taras Bulba could have been a very good film - possibly even a great one. But Hollywood values killed any chance of that. Instead, we have a reasonably enjoyable mess of a movie with two outstanding ingredients that rise above the rest - Franz Waxman's rousingly inventive music and a suitably over the top performance by Yul Brynner. As the title character, Brynner looks every inch a Cossack - swaggering and posing like a macho peacock, delivering his lines with that growling accent, and wearing his costumes as though he had lived in them all his life. Brynner was a hugely undervalued actor - a larger than life performer whose presence saved many a film. But the odds were really against him here.
Instead of focusing on Brynner, the film makes Tony Curtis, as his son, the central character. Curtis makes absolutely no effort to look like a Cossack so it is not surprising that he doesn't act like one either. While the rest of the Cossacks are swarthy, burly, scalplocked he-men, the sons of Taras Bulba look more like a couple of surfers who have wandered in from the film next door. Worse still is Curtis's love interest - the enemy girl he falls in love and betrays the Cossack Brotherhood for. She is played with wan listlessness by Christine Kaufmann in a performance so wooden it's a wonder Curtis didn't get splinters in their love scenes. Still, in real life, he must have fancied her because he left Janet Leigh to marry her.
Even with its insipid love story, Taras Bulba could still have achieved greatness through sheer spectacle. The costume department certainly did their bit - although some of the Polish uniforms are needlessly naff. The music thunders and roars - except for the obligatory love song sung by an oversweetened choir over the equally obligatory sixties montage sequence. Filming in Argentina may have been a good fiscal decision, but it doesn't help the look of the film - pampas are not steppes. Still, there are some exciting and effective sequences, notably the Ride To Dubno during which Brynner's followers grow from a handful to an army. The battles scenes are as lively as the Polish university scenes are dull. Sometimes the scale of the enterprise impresses. But you end up wanting to like the film more than you do.
Perhaps the film's uncertain tone is best illustrated by a post-production anecdote. At a pre-release screening, director J. Lee Thompson supposedly turned to Yul Brynner and said: ""I still don't see why you had to shoot Tony.""",1024876800,94,2492,4.797674418604651

409943,4,6301976029,"This is a great movie, but at the time it was made it raised issues of national security in the country where it was filmed - Argentina. Because of budgetary and political considerations (remember it was the height of the Cold War) the producers decided to forgo the authenticity of shooting it on the vast, rolling steppes of the Ukraine, opting instead for the cheaper and more convenient location of the Argentine pampas.
To create the phenomenal scenes of the mighty Cossack armies clashing with the Polish levies, the entire - and I mean ENTIRE -Argentine army was enrolled for 6 days. During this critical period the borders of the country were left completely undefended, making it possible for any neighboring power to swoop down and capture all the key strategic points in Argentina.
This provided the Paraguayans with the perfect opportunity to avenge the war of 1860, and even gave the sea-less Bolivians the chance to regain a coastline, not to mention the ever present threat of the crafty Chileans. The Brazilians might also have been tempted to pitch in were it not for the fact that their entire army was simultaneously engaged in shooting a water-borne Carmen Miranda swimming-and-dancing extravaganza.
Luckily none of Argentina's jealous neighbors found out in time to take advantage of this once in a lifetime opportunity. After watching this movie, I am sure you will agree the results were well worth the risk to Argentine national security.",992649600,16,1462,5.020576131687243
409944,4,6301976029,"It's great to see that the 'Epic' has made a comeback with the release of GLADIATOR. I therefore urge those of of you who enjoyed it you to view and admire this sweeping, swashbuckling panorama of charging horsemen, ringing blades and booming cannons which explores a fascinating but little-reported (in the west) chapter of history.  Set amid the Cossack struggle for independence from the Polish empire, this tale of warrior chief Yul Brynner and his relationship with his favourite son is full of dash and derring-do from beginning to end, and for me sits alongside 'El Cid' as the top epic of the 1960's which wasn't about ancient Rome. The highlight of the film is the stunningly-filmed sequence in which the Cossack cavalry regiments gather on the road to the city of Dubno, but the film contains several other fine moments: a gripping duel to the death as two cossack horsemen jump a yawning chasm until one tires and topples to their doom, and the scene in which Yul Brynner as Taras Bulba claims the leadership of the Cossack army and deposes the previous 'hetman'. The film's acting honours go unhestatingly to Brynner, who swaggers and struts superbly in the title role, while Tony Curtis is...well Tony Curtis. Franz Waxman's excellent score mixes gentle folk tunes and stirring evocations of galloping horseman. For film buffs: watch out for Brad Dexter, well-known as the Brynner co-star in 'The Magnificent Seven' who didn't make it to stardom, in the role of Taras Bulba's right-hand man. The last word goes to Brynner, who as he attempts to persuade the Cossacks to join his cause, delivers the classic line (to any Polish readers: no offence!)'There's only one way to keep faith with a Pole...put your faith in your sword, and your sword in the Pole!'",969926400,15,1769,4.877076411960133
409945,4,6301976029,"Curtis and then-wife Christine Kaufman are horribly miscast as Cossacks.  In fact, Curtis is more unbelievable here than he was in ""Spartacus,"" a few years earlier.
However, with the rousing battle scenes, the exciting Waxman score, and, of course, the one and only Yul Brynner in the title role, the film is a magnificent adventure deserving of a wider audience in need of a great historical, albeit flawed, epic.",967507200,3,414,5.0
409946,4,6301976029,"As an English teacher in Japan, I often have to answer stock questions like ""Where are you from?"" ""How old are you?"" and ""What's your favourite movie?"" This is where  it gets embarrassing.

When I answer Taras Bulba, nobody gets it. It  seems that any movie older than 6 months, except Roman Holiday, is  consigned to the realms of oblivion here in Japan. But at least this  ignorance gives me the confidence to answer the question honestly. If  fellow Westerners ask me the same question (which is thankfully unlikely as  this is a rather unsophisticated conversational ploy), I am unable to  answer so truthfully. ""What! Your favourite movie is Tony Curtis  playing a Cossack? "" some of my acquaintances would undoubtedly sneer.

I admit that Taras Bulba is in many ways a preposterous movie. Tony  Curtis as the main romantic lead is particularly bad. Christine Kaufmann as  the heroine is bland and wishy washy. Historically , it is less than  accurate. However weighted against all these defects, which make it so  embarrassing to espouse, are the film's good points, and the all important  fact that when I first saw it I was at a highly impressionable age, and saw  in a cinema, not on video.

The action and the stunts, the manly virtues  on display, the cameraderie, the contempt for the feminine side of life,  the triumph of freedom, the incredible music by Franz Waxman made this  movie particularly appealing to a 9 year-old boy seeking to get the better  of his older brothers.

Whereas Curtis seems straight out of 1950s  Brooklyn, Yul Brynner has all the arrogance and charisma of a timeless  warrior patriarch - which is probably what he was in real life anyway. The  Polish and Ukrainian settings have a fairytale atmosphere and there is that  unbelievble gathering of the cossacks underscored by Waxman's rousing  music, one of the greatest moments in cinematic history. It's nowhere the  best movie ever made but for a variety of reasons, it will always hold a  special place in a heart that feels itself to some degree Cossack.",963964800,8,2048,4.821325648414986
409947,5,6301976029,"A grand tale of adventure and struggle. When the Cossacks ride out from their villages and farms, with stirring music behind them, slowly expanding their numbers to become an army of liberation your heart can't help but  beat faster. And the final scene, where the values of a people's freedom  and greatness triumph over betrayal and individual self-indulgence, is a  message that is timeless. It's been a long wait for this to come out for  purchase; the excellent soundtrack has been out for over a year. (get it  too).",953078400,3,522,4.820224719101123
409948,5,6301976029,I first saw this movie when it first came out in full length feature film. Thirty three years later it still captures my imagination and emotions. Like many classics it is timless and to this day can still thrill first  time viewers. A great story of heroism and unyielding character which we  see so little of in todays world. Yul Brynner is able to capture the sole  and heart of the free spirited Cossacks. Reminisent of the fervor of  Braveheart. If you liked that one you will love Taras Bulba.,925084800,8,499,4.511111111111111
