3770530,3,B001QU880W,"As a kid, I devoured all the Saturday Morning TV in the '70s I could take. Now as an adult, I'm amazed by the fact that a 70's Cartoon collection like this even exists so let's start off with the positive.

This is a great sample of pop culture history. Remember, no home video market in the '70's so the best chance to see the new comedy or adventure animated fare were only on Saturdays. It was an weekly event for kids and a boon for animation houses like Hanna-Barbera and Filmation to name a few. I was very pleased to see some long forgotten favorites such as Filmation's Tarzan and HB's Wheelie and the Chopper Bunch (an early precursor to Pixar's 'Cars'). Speed Buggy is another fun show represented I can't believe isn't on its own series DVD set yet. Of course other classics are represented here as well like The JETSONS and SCOOBY-DOO although the episodes here have already been released on other series DVD sets.

Which leads to where I think this set falls short. Too many episodes here that are already on other Hanna-Barbera series DVD sets. There is already a Scooby-Doo Movies set featuring every episode guest-staring the Harlem Globetrotters. Why not feature an episode from that series not currently on that set? There are plenty of them still missing to select from. And by the way, the opening for the Scooby-Doo Movies has been edited. The scene of the robot cowboy gunfire or other ""violent"" acts have been removed. I really hate the PC-ification of animation history. Questioning other episode selection choices, why run a Josie & the Pussycats episode already on their DVD set when a better choice would have been Josie & the Pussycats in Outer Space, which isn't out there yet?

And boy the mix of series selected here really don't do the Hanna-Barbera legacy any favors. When you can watch all the shows here in a row you really come to realize how sloppy and lazy the studio became as the years went by. Most of the series here became cookie-cutter clones of the Scooby-Doo model. Even admitted to by some of the creators featured in the Docs on this set. Teen-age kids and their talking pet (or car, or whatever) solving mysteries. When you've seen one, you've seen them all and the animation gets worse and worse as time goes by. Shows like The Funky Phantom and Goober & the Ghost Chasers are dreadful in every way. These are the bottom of the HB barrel in character design, story and animation and it's no wonder why these shows don't have their own dvd sets. As an animation history buff, it's almost disheartening to see right before your eyes how fast HB declines from its hey-day of Yogi Bear, The Flintstones, The Jetsons even the earliest Scooby-Doo shows into some of the most forgettable '70s cartoon series ever.

And the worst show on this set? Hands, down, The Roman Holidays. A cheap (and I mean cheaply produced!) attempt to clone the Flintstones model. Awful in every conceivable way.

Buyers should also know some of the quality of various shows on this disk are not as great as one would come to expect. A fact that is properly called out on the disks before you even get to the main menu. Obviously some of the original footage from the animation vaults was in rough shape. Tarzan and The Funky Phantom are prime examples. Which is disappointing because of all of the shows here deserving of its own DVD collection, it's Tarzan. For Filmation, one of its finest examples from its library. For those of you at the WB reading these reviews on these sets, I would still take a low quality DVD set of the Tarzan series any day over most of the other shows represented here.

At best, this disk a trippy reflection of a transitional time in animation history. Especially for the Hanna-Barbera studio. An interesting experiment for Warner Bros. I hope they try again. Only this time, here's hoping they think longer and harder about what will go into a volume two for this series.",1244332800,58,3926,4.625538020086084
3770531,5,B001QU880W,"I give this five stars, as I believe this is the best way to see some of these 1970's shows. Most of these have not yet been released on DVD, and to be honest: one episode is enought in some cases.
Those that have been previously released on DVD are worth the entire sets.
1962's THE JETSONS feels out of place here, but it was still in network re-runs on Saturday Mornings.  However I wish another 1970's show would have bene included.  As this is ""volume 1"" I am sure the missing shows will see their way to DVD.

These were all produced by Hanna-Barbera.

The 70s were the era of sugary cereals,  and mindless cartoons.  Scooby Doo still holds up, but these others are absolutely horrible.  I can't even believe how low budget the creativity was at this point, particularly the 70s ones.  Bat-Mite was a constant downer and they kept pushing that character, and others like that are found within this era.  It's a good thing that I graduated on to Twilight Zone and Cosmos or I may never had made it through college.",1472256000,,636,4.422413793103448

3770588,5,B001QU880W,I loved watching these old cartoons with my friend's granddaughter and told her stories of how I used to sit every Saturday morning watching these cartoons while eating breakfast. Don't remember some of them but most of them I remembered and loved every minute of watching the DVDs.,1400112000,,282,4.895833333333333
3770589,3,B001QU880W,"I chose this rating as a 60 percent good is because due to the fact of short cartoons of the 1970s and the pussy cats. I really hate when it is 5 and 10 something min of these dvds, they can add up to 8 or 7 hours of this classic of 1970s making it 4 or 5 episodes for each cartoon like pussy cats and yogi bear show. Instead they made it into 1 or 2 of the episodes, how cheap are they? Cant they just add episodes, I mean it is rare and stuff. I reccomend you to buy this cause some of the shows in here are not shown on dvd or released yet. I don't  recommend u guys to buy this cause some of it is already released like the pussy cats jetsons and scooby doo. I really like and don't like scooby doo because i have it in my windows 8 laptop.",1396483200,,744,3.738853503184713

3770592,2,B001QU880W,"Wow, maybe back when I was a kid I was impressed but especially the entire Hanna Barbera animation looks so flat and amateurish now. Even more so when you think of how good Looney Tunes or Disney looked back then.

Also, because Scooby Doo was a hit, was that reason enough to spin off more versions of a group solving mysteries (Amazing Chan and the Chan Clan, Funky Phantom). You really have to see Roman Holidays to be totally dumbfounded how that got redlit. There are some pretty bad cartoons on here beyond the halfway decent Yogi Bear and Josie and the Pussycats.

I'd say cartoons have come a long way since.

The extras are nothing to write home about. As far as what's on here, other reviews have the list. Needless to say did not date well, and I grew up in this era.",1389052800,,778,4.3517241379310345

Yeah! When this first came out it was priced at $35. Come on man! Give a guy a break.
I waited until the price went down under $20 to get it. I have Volume 1 and 2 and have to say Volume 1 is my favorite.
Only one problem was posted by another who say The Jetsons was also on 1960's Volume which I agree
they could of replaced it w/ another cartoon from the 70's. Besides that this volume 1 was good included my favorites
Hong Kong Phooey which I know has his own complete series DVD. But this makes me think about purchasing it.
I also enjoyed Josie and the Pussycats and The Amazing Chan And The Chan Clan. I think it's the sugar pop music
that I enjoyed in those days. Speaking of pop music you have Monkees Mickey Dolenz voice on The Funky Phantom which he plays the main red head boy Spike who works w/ Funky Phantom. I liked the Batman and Tarzan episodes. In Batman I forgot about Batmite who's such an annoy character but this episode he wasn't that bad. I have to agree w/ the others on Roman Holidays being a B rated Flintstones I could of done w/out. Some cartoons w/ same formula like Speed Buggy and Wheelie and The Chopper. Of course everyone was coping Scooby Doo like The Funky Phantom or The Amazing Chan And The Chan Clan. It was interesting and funny hearing in the extras actor Jamie Farr as one of the writers of The Amazing Chan And The Chan Clan.",1383696000,,1445,4.182795698924731

3770609,4,B001QU880W,"This is the second review of the new Saturday Morning Cartoon collections just released from Warner Bros.  This two disc set covers many of the great cartoons of the 1970s.  Saturday morning cartoons truly began to grow up in this decade and the shows were very different than those of the 1960s.  First off, while most of the 60s shows would run three or four toons during the hour, in the 70s many shows ran just one episode for the entire 30 minute slot.  This was confirmation that kids were becoming more sophisticated.  They wanted meatier plots and fewer funny animals.  The 70s toons were incredibly diversified...there was action, sci-fi, fantasy, horror, musical, mystery, and super hero toons, everything under the sun, frankly.

One toon dominated the decade and became a tremendous incluence and that was ""Scooby Doo, Where are You?""  Actually debuting in 1969 the adventures of Scooby and the gang were on throughout the 1970s in various incarnations.  The tremendous popularity of the Scooby Gang would spawn numerous mystery solving copycat cartoons, largely produced by the Hanna-Barbera studio who created Scooby in the first place.

Goober and the Ghost Chasers was perhaps the most blatant Scooby rip-off.  A group of teens and their dog Goober travel about solving ghostly mysteries.  Goober, the weird hound dog had the ability to turn invisible when he became frightened.  The very first episode ""Assignment: The Ahab Apparition"" is included and guest stars the Partridge Family with the real voices of Danny Bonaduce and Susan Dey.

Master Asian detective Charlie Chan came to animation in the form of The Amazing Chan and the Chan Clan.  The series focused on Chan's many children who solved crimes and also had their own rock band...a common plot device in 60s and 70s cartoons.  Charlie Chan was voiced by Key Luke who played Chan's son in some of the old movies of the 1940s and also starred in the TV series ""Kung Fu"" as Master Po.  Here's a bit of trivia...several of the episodes were written by Jamie Farr of M.A.S.H. fame and the Fonz himself, Henry Winkler.

Another Scooby Clone, The Funky Phantom, featured a group of mystery-solving teens who were aided by A Revolutionary War spirit and his cat ""Boo"".  The ghost was voiced by Daws Butler, one of the greatest voice actors ever.  Butler was also the voice of Yogi Bear, Quickdraw McGraw, and Huckleberry Hound.  One of the teens was voiced by Monkees drummer Mickey Dolenz.

The Scooby Cartoon featured here is from ""The New Scooby New Movies"" which had a different guest star each week.  This one featured the Harlem Globetrotters in ""The Ghostly Creep from the Deep"".

BUT...the disc isn't all mystery solving...The Batman/Tarzan hour gives us ""The Pest"" as Batman and Robin track down the Joker.  Adam West and Burt Ward reprised their roles from the 1960s live action Batman TV show.  And of course there is the ""number one super-guy"" Hong Kong Phooey also battling crime in ""Car Thieves"" and ""Zoo Story"".  Other toons star Speed Buggy, Josie and the Pussy Cats, Wheelie and the Chopper Bunch, and Roman Holidays.

This set is not nearly as diversified as the 1960s set.  There's too much of the mystery shows and not enough of the Sci-Fi/Adventure/Fantasy shows included.  Where is Sealab 2020 or the Godzilla Power Hour?  Where is the Robonic Stooges and Addams Family?  These were all Hanna-Barbera shows.  Hopefully these will show up in future sets.  Like the 1960s set, the quality is overall quite good.  This one loses just a few points for giving us a bit too much of the Scooby clone shows.",1269907200,4,3592,4.871287128712871

3770611,5,B001QU880W,"I can't say how excited I was to have this DVD.  It is the best selection of 70's cartoons that I could think of.  Sure, there were a few left out like JabberJaw & Fat Albert (don't know the copyrights for that one though). The Tom & Jerry Show would have been so welcome here as well (I know it is in volume 2).  But first of all, this has Tarzan: Lord of the Jungle. Far and away one the best Saturday Morning Cartoons that I grew up watching.  Wish there was a complete series for sale. But to also have Speed Buggy, Josie & the Pussycats, Funky Phantom, Scooby-Doo, The Jetsons, Hong Knog Phooey, Goober and the Ghost Chasers, New Adventures of Batman, and Charlie Chan & the Chan Clan here is really awesome.  All very cool shows that I enjoyed watching growing up in the 70's.  This disc set is by far my favorite of the Saturday Morning Cartoon releases.",1266624000,5,861,4.283950617283951
3770612,4,B001QU880W,"This is a good collection of cartoons from the 70's and it is enjoyable.  i was not excited about a few of them like Batman, Tarzan or Yogi's Gang but I just skipped these.  Now to see Wheelie And The Chopper Bunch again was a joy.  With the TV Channel 'Boomerang"" they show many of these and I watch them but this disc has a few that is not played much.  This is a good disc and the newer part 2 is also great.  Hey, it's Hanna-Barbera!!",1261612800,,438,3.9885057471264367
3770613,3,B001QU880W,"Folks, this is perhaps the weakest of this series.

This contains some of the early 70s toons from (mostly) the Hanna Barbera stable and a 1977 Batman/Tarzan episode from Filmation (the folks who brought you Fat Albert, which is available elsewhere).

There are a few good toons here. HONG KONG PHOOEY, one of the last truly great Sat. morning cartoons until GARFIELD AND FRIENDS some 15 years later, is quite imaginative and amusing. These 2 adventures of the Kung Fu fighting canine custodian and his ""Hong Kong Book of Kung Foo"" (voiced by the beloved Scatman Crothers) are hilariously based around Penrod Pooch (HKP's alter-ego) efforts to thrawrt a kangaroo thief and auto rustlers while seeing to it that the police station stays clean at the same time. The episode of the crime fighting female rockers JOSIE & THE PUSSYCATS is quite good, with their efforts to fight the mad seaman Captain Nemo III. As a six year old in 1970, this show got me interested in geography because of all of the different countries they visited. However, this show is best seen in singular viewings, as the adult viewer would soon see that they told the same story every time (you will clench your teeth at the 1000th mention of ""those meddling kids!"").

On the downside, Hanna Barbera was beginning it's downhill slide in the 1970s in part because of the sissified do-gooding children's watchdog groups's misguided attemtps to klean up kiddie kartoons drawing all of the action and humor out of them (didn't these people ALSO watch Looney Tunes and Tom & Jerry when THEY were kids)? While this effort sometimes succeeded in the cases of FAT ALBERT, Schoolhouse Rock, and the Electric Company in efforts to ""edutain,"" this also brought about nauseating fruit loop-troop garbage of the Barney, New Zoo Revue, Care Bears, and Teletubbies variety. This led to HB to new lows such as the sickeningly preachy YOGI'S GANG (why they didn't burn this hogwash and why they included this mess here is beyond me).

HB's tendency to repeat themselves during this period is also shown here. Horrible, witless Scooby-Doo knocckoffs such as THE AMAZING CHAN & THE CHAN CLAN. Fortuantely, I rarely saw this as a kid in 1972 as Charleston SC's WCSC-TV wisely preempted this for the beloved local favorite HAPPY RAINE SHOW which showed better cartoons. I only saw this when visiting cousin in New York City). Other Scooby imitators included the sorry Speed Buggy, and the outrageously stupid FUNKY PHANTOM (a ghost from 1776 and his cat being released from his clock after 200 years by crime fighting teenagers? What were they smoking?). Then there's the ROMAN HOLIDAYS (an unfunny attempt to do the Flintstones and Jetsons in Ancient Rome). These guys were scraping the bottom of the barrel.

Your kids are not going to believe you once sat still for such slop. And neither will you after seeing SOME of these with adult eyes after 30 years.

But, hey, vol. 2 is much better.",1260316800,,2943,4.8409542743538765
3770614,5,B001QU880W,"I purchased all 4 DVD's and I am very pleased.  It has been a long time coming for some of the lesser known HB classics to have their day in the sun.  To be honest, I thought many of these cartoons would never see a release.  There is enough Flintstones, Jetsons, Yogi, etc. to choke a moose.  In my opinion, it is great to see these lesser known characters regardless of plot, writing, character appeal etc.  Let us not forget, these shows did not have the budget and personnel the aforementioned bigger titles were afforded.  Also, owning an official release DVD is much better than the only previous option-low picture quality home recorded DVD's on the auction sites.  Grab this before it is too late.  I don't think you'll see these released again any time soon.",1257724800,5,767,4.588235294117647

3770616,5,B001QU880W,"This is an amazing set and I was so excited to buy it because I have not seen these cartoons in over twenty years.  It took me back to the Saturday mornings of my childhood when cartoons were actually enjoyable and watchable.

I agree with one reviewer that I would love to see a series release of the Tarzan filmation series.

Here is a list of cartoon series that I want to see released as complete series sets on DVD.  They would all be ""must buys"" for me. Hopefully we will see them released one day.

Tarzan, Lord of the Jungle
Clue Club
Goober and the Ghost Chasers
Jeanie
Amazing Chan Clan
Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels
Devlin
Roman Holidays
Wonder Wheels
Sealab 2010

8336353,3,B001QU880W,"SATURDAY MORNING CARTOONS/1970S VOL. 1: Hanna-Barbera was best known for their vast cast of talking critters (Yogi Bear, Huckleberry Hound, Quick Draw McGraw) but by the seventies, the studio was chasing the latest trend started by their enormously successful own Scooby Doo, Where Are You?...mystery solving teens who often doubled as rock bands (a nod to The Archies' influence). There was female pop trio Josie & the Pussycats, Goober & the Ghost Chasers (guest starring the Partridge Family kids in this segment), Funky Phantom (a spirit of '76 who channeled Snagglepuss), Speed Buggy (a talking car voiced by Mel Blanc), The Amazing Chan & the Chan Clan (the movie sleuth saddled with ten children), and The New Scooby Doo Movies, which paired the gang with everyone from The Harlem Globetrotters to Laurel & Hardy. A vintage Jetsons toon, karate-chopping canine Hong Kong Phooey, a Flintstones knock-off called The Roman Holidays, Filmation's straight laced Tarzan, and The New Adventures of Batman (with Adam West and Burt Ward providing the voices) are on hand to break things up a bit. The biggest disappointment is Yogi's Gang, which transforms the famous bruin, Wally Gator, Magilla Gorilla and their mischievous cronies into unfunny, moral-dispensing do-gooders. Thanks to restrictions on cartoon violence inherent to the era, Quick Draw never shoots himself in the face and Huck Hound never gets clobbered by an anvil...this is also why super heroes like Space Ghost and The Herculoids were eventually scrapped in favor of kid detectives. Hanna-Barbera's unfortunate habit of saddling all their later productions with a phony laugh-track doesn't make this stuff any funnier. The sixties' Saturday morning schedule was a wonderland of former theatrical offerings like The Looney Tunes, Tom and Jerry and Popeye. Naturally, the made-for-TV fodder cranked out in the seventies can't help but pale in comparison.
