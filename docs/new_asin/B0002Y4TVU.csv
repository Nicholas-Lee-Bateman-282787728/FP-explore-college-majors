2140279,4,B0002Y4TVU,"I liked it. yes, the budget's a little low for what they were trying to do, but there are some good themes in this you wouldn't normally expect from a movie of this kind. Nice twists and turns, a creepy paranoid vibe and (at least from what I got), a timely message about the dangers of people becoming sheep. how fitting given the current state of the world. It also doesn't hurt that Elizabeth Berkely is easy on the eyes.",1102032000,14,424,4.3125
2140280,5,B0002Y4TVU,It appears that the only way we can get the truth out about the Paradox of Evil the United States has become is to package it as a movie. The Government of the United States is treating its citizens as bags of popcorn by microwaving them to keep them from speaking out.,1102032000,19,269,4.1923076923076925
2140281,2,B0002Y4TVU,"I picked up this movie with a number of other SciFi Channel releases and this one is not worth the time taken to view it,the plot is full of holes,for example why doesn't the director of the covert op need a helmet like his troops to protect his brain from being controlled. The redemption of Karen (the wife)is totally unbelievable as is the participation of the street gang who just happen to want to fight the government,and to top it off most of the acting is second rate,probably because the actors found the script as trying as I did.",1101859200,3,540,4.4646464646464645

2140326,3,B0002Y4TVU,"Not the best movie around, but still creepy and spooky. Voice-to-skull technology. High Tech Gang Stalking. Psychotronic torture. Microchip implants. Sound beams. Microwave rays. Mind Control. Lab rats. (It's all dramatized and exaggerated. It's science fiction. But some of this stuff can be done in reality). It's a Game. The stalkers have to Win over the Target. It becomes an obsession to them. They can't have the Target escapes or even worse the Target Wins. The Target has to be broken, tamed and controlled. And even better, destroyed. It's a psychopathic obsession. A twisted Game - played by people who are sick. ""You have to relive the same day over and over again..."" like Sisyphus.",1398211200,2,694,5.043478260869565
2140327,5,B0002Y4TVU,And provocative. And lent it to a friend who doesn't speak much English and she was able to watch it in Spanish. Pretty cool!  She land her husband liked it too.,1391212800,,161,4.193548387096774
2140328,5,B0002Y4TVU,"WOW! I can't believe that this movie is actually showing the people how they are controllong the masses right as we speak. I have noticed ringing in my ears lately and sumtimes my preseptun uf thinggs is disstorrted. Whenn they activvatte the siggnel, My speeling is totttallly offfff. Timme forr a copppper hat! The military is spraying the skies with aluminum, barium, and strontium and other particulates, which makes the skies conductive. It is now easier for them to transmit the signal with conductive skies. All you have to do is stop texting and talking on your phone and LOOK UP! Barium given to lab rats induced heart attacks. If you feel chest pains, blame it on the military. I know someone in the military and this person said that the planes spraying the chemicals are military planes. This person said they don't know what they are spraying, but it is hurting people. GOOGLE-MK ULTRA, PROJECT BLUEBEAM. This movie is a MUST SEE! I recommend it to anyone that wants to see what is really going on. In the movie they mention LSD being fed to military personnel. That really happened! After WWII, we imported 500 Nazi scientists to continue their work on MIND CONTROL. That was called Project Paperclip. Now they introduce our subconscious mind to mind control on the TV through spinning circles and flashes of light. That puts the victim into a deep trance. Also, counting up, and then counting down. Sports Center is notorious for this count up then down. PAY ATTENTION PEOPLE! IT IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW ON YOUR TV! THAT'S WHY THEY SWITCHED TO DIGITAL PROGRAMMING, TO PRODUCE A MORE DETAILED PICTURE TO MIND CONTROL US BETTER. FOX NEWS-FAIR AND BALANCED-EXCEPT FOR THE MIND CONTROL!",1390089600,5,1696,4.831615120274914
2140329,5,B0002Y4TVU,"Much like the movie, ""Enemy of the State"" this movie depicts in generalities if not in some cases exactly what the !@#$%^ is going on at least in this country if not all over the world. MKULTRA is alive and torturing many powerless victims under different budget titles and subcontracted to various front corporations all funded by hard working plebeian's tax money.

Jesse Ventura is the Paul Revere of our day. His conspiracy show, ""brain invaders"" tries to shed some light on this issue. (youtube his show)
 Gordon P. Erspamer, attorney, located in San Francisco, is fighting for veterans who've been used as test cases for the military experimentation programs even for some crude brain implant technology. (Youtube the following word phrase: ""gordon erspamer brain implant"" and review the listed videos. Enoght said.",1388275200,,821,5.165413533834586
2140330,5,B0002Y4TVU,"This is a 'B+' made movie.  I ordered it for content and the subject, but, I also like the the actors.  I listened to an interview (VeritasRadio) by Dr. Reni Hilde, (Norwegian, Military Command Doctor, ret., and author of 6 books, none published in America).  During her interview, she recommended this movie and the first ""Manchurian Candidate"" with Frank Sinatra.  ""Control Factor"" according to Dr. Hilde, it is a truthful look at experiments being carried out on the masses here in America and other countries, by our government 'military industrial complex', as well as, those experiments in 'Manchurian Candidate'.

Have you heard of MK Ultra and Mind Control projects.(I would also recommend TransFormation America by Cathy O'brian)

I would recommend both movies, and her interview, which you can find with an internet search. Then! make up your own mind on what you think is true.
It is very fascinating, regardless.",1373846400,4,924,5.126666666666667
2140331,3,B0002Y4TVU,"yes, i enjoyed this sci-fi film but you definitely have to be in a forgiving mood to enjoy this. shades of ""Them"" here and you'll simply love the ""posse"" when they come into the film. the actors give it their all and you can't ask for more than that.",1301443200,,250,4.122448979591836
2140332,5,B0002Y4TVU,"It has been a while since I have watched this movie but reading some of the other reviews I have to agree that the movie has a lot of flaws. But, then again, the idea that under the circumstances if people could be controlled by such experiments there would be no way to stop someone else from doing the experiment again. It would thus always be a threat and impossible to stop assuming the technology is there and plausible. It reminds me of a lab in northern California in the 70's which claimed to have a suicide ray. Once directed on an area of a city or town it allegedly caused massive painful depression in the occupants living in the area resulting in massive suicide. Given studies done which seem to show low frequency electromagnetic radiation can affect one's psych in adverse ways and evidence in which the military has been experimenting with non-destructive radiation which is said to cause the enemy to become demoralized I would have to conclude it may be possible. Thus if my information sources are accurate the movie achieved it's objective which is the impossibility of future generations to avoid the continuation of mind control experiments on the population.",1262908800,2,1182,4.799019607843137

8034481,1,B0002Y4TVU,"Be careful, I didn't realize this copy was coming from UK, second I failed to read the notice that it would not play in our country, which I'm surprised it is sold here. They will refund the purchase price only, but will be out the shipping there and back so guess it is my loss. Just want to warn others to read notice. It never entered my mind a DVD didn't work here so missed the warning. Buy from US dealers only!!!",1447459200,,419,4.121951219512195
