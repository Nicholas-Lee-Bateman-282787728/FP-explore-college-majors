NO WAY IS THIS going to let you down. You must be some stupid idiot to not learn how to get a girl to laugh with this program. You can get the hot and crazy but also down to earth type of girls when you just play it smooth and relax and do simple one-liners or even gestures. So I really enjoyed this book.",1408752000,,535,3.7857142857142856

The guest speakers are awesome & all have lots to contribute.  Especially Shawn, just his portion of the series is worth the whole program.  This is a must have..",1379030400,,322,4.696428571428571
8311450,1,B001IW228M,"Forget what you see advertised, this seller only sends you three out of the six DVD's and  they're of the poorest quality imaginable. I rate my experience as being victimized buy this seller. That being said there is a great book on this subject ""Volume 2 The Cocky and Funny Edition by Dantalion Jones,"" he covers this subject in extreme detail.  I want to make it clear that my statements about the DVD's are not meant to reflect on David DeAngelo.",1311033600,2,450,4.54320987654321
