8015057,3,B0001N9Z9S,"This Made-For-TV Movie "" Voyage of Terror"" (1990 )starring Burt Lancaster and Eva Marie Saint is based on the true story  of a hi-jacked luxury cruise ship that came to be known as ""the achille lauro affair"".  . The film depicts the terrorism events that transpired aboard the Italian luxury cruise ship Achille Lauro. It is a US/ITalian co-production that  was  filmed aboard the actual ship!  The incident occurred on international waters during the Reagan administration. The ship was hi-jacked by four Palestinians.

  Since it was an Italian ship, the Italian authorities were mostly responsible for the rescue of the ships passengers. Which included many Americans. However, there was debate in the White House over how or if to act with military force to rescue the hostages. This occurred over  5 years after the Iranian hostage crisis. But the memory of that long drawn out terrorist act was still fresh in the minds of the American people and the Reagan White House. The events are still poignant today for obvious reasons and the threat, still very real. One of the best things about the film is actually  soundtrack original music which  created by master Italian film composer Ennio Morricone.  I wish Amazon would credit Music composers on the movie product pages. But as of yet they do not.
Burt Lancaster and Eva Marie Saint give rare and note worthy performances towards the end of their careers. A  compelling film that seems to get most of the facts correct.",1210118400,7,1477,4.907258064516129
