8282257,5,B001B8PHEY,"One of the best works of the little known German director outside Germany, Helmut Kaeutner. It was created in the time of the impending defeat of Nazi Germany. The Nazis, in reaction, propagandized desparately for total war. This work was based on Maupassant's nouvelle ""The Necklace"" about a mediocre man, who discovered that his lovely and apparently submissive wife, only after her death, actually had an affair with another man. The film develops this love liaison impressively, reminiscent of the French poetical realism carried to a tragic end. The pessimism and ""decadence"" exhibited in the film was considered by the Nazi as signs of defeatism and sabotage of the social morale. After the war, this film has been considered as one of the rare gems of Germany cinema during the Nazi era.",1237420800,,794,5.0227272727272725
