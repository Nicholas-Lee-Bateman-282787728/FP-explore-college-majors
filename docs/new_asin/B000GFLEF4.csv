2608319,5,B000GFLEF4,"Fast paced, hilarious yet deep - this movie very realisticly describes the Bosnia I've come to live in and love during the war.

Been looking for this on DVD since I've seen the movie 3 years ago.

Go for it, you won't regret it!",1173312000,9,229,4.181818181818182
8131578,4,B000GFLEF4,"I enjoyed the first half. The second half was not nearly as good, except for the ending which was okay. The relations between peacetime Bosnians and Serbs, and the well intentioned bumbling of the European and American peacekeepers, were handled with humor, which is difficult to do with such a situation.",1522713600,,305,5.0
8131579,4,B000GFLEF4,Its a reminder of the best comedies of the 70s and a fascinating little slice of life and a genocidal war with shades of The Mouse That Roared. Good little movie with a lot of humor but cant say much about it without giving away the story.,1506729600,,239,4.1063829787234045
8131580,4,B000GFLEF4,"My wife and I are watching a film from each country each month and this is the one from Bosnia-Herzegovina.  This is a very serious movie with moments of levity that actually enhance the message of the film.  I cannot imagine what it would be like to have your neighbors transform into your killers, virtually overnight, and then how you would deal with the aftermath, but this movie expertly puts me into the mindsets of the people caught up in such a nightmare.  The characters are interesting and you get a sense of them as people, not just as cliche's.  The plot succeeds in pulling together multiple story-lines in a satisfying way and shows you many different types of characters from different ethnic, religious, and socio-economic strata.  It is a very good film and I highly recommend it.",1454112000,2,797,4.746376811594203
8131581,5,B000GFLEF4,Excellent movie plus great soundtrack!,1421452800,,38,6.8
8131582,5,B000GFLEF4,"I really enjoyed this.  Every actor made their character add so much to every scene and the story has a good comedic premise.  Politics and money go together like peanut butter and jelly.  It was a tasty movie, a very watchable movie.",1420934400,,234,4.523809523809524
8131583,5,B000GFLEF4,Excellent!  Amazing how it was able to integrate global and personal issues.  An authentic feel of the strife that lingers in the region.,1419206400,,137,4.913043478260869
8131584,5,B000GFLEF4,Provides a good depiction of life and attitudes of the populous in post-war Bosnia.,1416528000,,83,5.0
8131585,5,B000GFLEF4,"Although I agree with each of the other reviews, do not let them make you think that this movie is (all) a downer--it has some wonderful, funny moments.  A lit of them, actually.  As sad and touching and surreal... like life.  Do yourself a favor and watch this movie... does any one know where I can get the soundtrack?",1210982400,4,320,4.389830508474576
8131586,5,B000GFLEF4,"It is worth while, every so often, to look at art the way it used to be -- moral.  Because suffering leads to introspection, most of the art coming from Bosnia is moral.  This movie is no exception.",1207440000,,198,4.184210526315789
8131587,5,B000GFLEF4,"One of the best movies from Bosnia (former Yugoslavia).
It will break your heart and make you think...how fragile we humans are.",1201046400,,128,4.863636363636363
