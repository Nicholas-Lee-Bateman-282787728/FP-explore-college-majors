1870834,1,B00008Z44F,"As often as the voodoo religion and clowns cross paths this is the first movie to exploit this correlation. It deals with intercity youths with bad attitudes, and there excursion to the woods far from Los Angeles. One of the youths with her impeccible ability to use voodoo decides to summon Killjoy to save one of the hoodlums lives who was shot point blank with a shotgun. Instead Killjoy begins to eliminate the teens and not even the Voodoo lady, who's house they had discovered, can stop him. But luckily at the last minute one of the teens discovers a liquid which destroys the clown. Dumb movie dumb ending, and a dumb purchase. I only regret the one star I am giving this is as low as it gets.",1153526400,2,701,4.441860465116279

1870836,1,B00008Z44F,"Easily, this is the worst movie that I have seen in my life. I watched it without any high expectations (because I had seen the first Killjoy movie), but this was just incredibly awful. Until I saw Killer Klowns from Outer Space, Killjoy 1 was the worst movie I'd ever seen, but as incredibly bad as the Killer Klowns movie was, this one managed to be ridiculously worse. So, if nothing else, I must give Killjoy 2 credit for managing to be the worst movie ever put to film. What's wrong with it you ask? I'll try to explain. This movie makes absolutely no sense at all. The acting was incredibly horrible (even for a B horror movie), the plot was awful, the effects were awful, and the villain was awful. At least Killjoy's appearance (however badly put together or explained) in the first movie made a tiny amount of sense. In this movie, the only reason for Killjoy's appearance seems to be that someone informed him that there was a sequel. Even if you enjoy watching these types of movies simply to make fun of them, I would not really suggest this one. While it is EXTREMELY easy to make fun of it, it isn't really worth the fact that it will make your brain die.",1065830400,2,1169,4.391705069124424
1870837,1,B00008Z44F,"The worst movie ever made. A psycho horror movie with many cliches of other better horror movies. Bad acting, bad story, bad directing. Better keep your hands off it.",1055462400,,166,4.758620689655173
1870838,5,B00008Z44F,"This is easily one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. Comes packed with bad acting, unrealistic situations, and of course Killjoy. A couple of friends and I rented this from blockbuster, just because the cover made us laugh. After you get past the first 20 minuntes of absolute stupidity, Killjoy finally gets ""released."" From there on out its a comic fest.",1051315200,3,363,4.777777777777778
7988104,5,B00008Z44F,"This movie takes me back!
Killjoy still had all of his ""names"" and did not yet command a ""starship""!

Great movie about both clowns and violence.
The violence had already started long before Killjoy's arrival.
But Killjoy's kills are supposed to be eviler than the murders that were already on screen twenty minutes before Killjoy arrived!
 1. Great acting, 2. likable characters, 3. evil, yet cute clown, 4. bad one liners that are terrible... but flow with the show!",1488844800,,468,4.9113924050632916

7988108,4,B00008Z44F,"Ignore the other reviews if you are a fan of these crappy B-movies. I'm a fan of the Leprechaun series and the Chucky series, and while Killjoy 2 doesn't live up to either of those, it's in the same vein. It's a fun film, with a great performance from Debbie Rochon and some hilarious one-liners courtesy of Killjoy.",1403136000,,316,4.4655172413793105
7988109,2,B00008Z44F,"Killjoy is back in this sequel to the first film and is being played by Trent Haaga. The main characters are a bunch of teens/young adults who are having their rap sheet read for a bunch of ridiculous crimes they committed. The delinquents are put in a van by detention officers Denise Martinez and Harris Redding and sent off to a detention center across L.A, at least an hour or two away from the city, out in the country and wooded area. The ride lasts all day and by night their engine gives out, leaving them trapped in the middle of nowhere with no cell phone connection at all.

One of the miscreants breaks into a house for help only to get fatally shot by a redneck woman who threatens to kill them all, unless they leave. This leads to Redding shooting and killing her. The group then head to another house visible from where they are and discover that a voodoo woman lives there. The voodoo woman claims that she can save the dying delinquent with her magic. One of the girls goes on to tell the story of how Killjoy came about (referencing the plot from the first movie), leading to one of the criminals to convince her to summon Killjoy to save their dying mate.

After seemingly to have failed, Nic yells at Ce-Ce and she goes to cry about it in an outhouse. Enter Killjoy. Killjoy arrives on the scene and stalks the girl from outside of the outhouse before slipping a pair of chattering teeth inside to chew her to death. From there on out, the criminals, officers, and voodoo woman learn that Killjoy has been resurrected and that their lives on earth are near its end, unless they can find a way to send him back to hell. Can they survive the night and send Killjoy back to the freak circus or will he show them all that he's not clowning around?",1358812800,,1764,4.375
7988110,2,B00008Z44F,"The main characters are introduced by reading their rap sheet. A group of youthful offenders are being transported in a van to a work site 200 miles away. They start out in the morning and by night fall they still haven't arrived. The van breaks down and they go for help.

After a mishap, they come across a house of a woman versed in the black arts. One of the offenders tells us the story of Killjoy, then he somehow arrives at the scene.

The characters in this film are stiff. Killjoy is overly animated with cliche ""Freddy"" style lines. His humor is the sole attraction of the film, which makes it slightly better than the first feature, but not as good as the third one.

7988113,1,B00008Z44F,"I was watching Kill Joy with my man one early morning when I was absolutely noticing that the whole movie was so cruel and plain evil. Usually I will never really watch horror movies like this but I wanted to see what it was all about. Basically explaining it's main reason why he became a killer. I would never ever want my children watching it. My man loves horror movies he has so many collections. He wants to own the two sets of Kill Joy. Me, not interested in it.",1250208000,,469,4.222222222222222
