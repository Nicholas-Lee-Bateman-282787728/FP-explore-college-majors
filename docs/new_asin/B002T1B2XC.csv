8573736,5,B002T1B2XC,"Charming domestic comedy about men thinking they can take care of their children better than their wives.  Three husbands take their six children to their annual winter mountain retreat.  Various mayhem ensues.  The men later receive some comeuppance.  The movie is heart-warming, but be advised, this English speaker had to pay especial attention to the subtitles which sometimes are too brief and sometimes have misspellings that give one pause. None the less, the slight challenge is well worth the effort to see one of the best loved films in the Czech Republic.",1453334400,,566,5.119565217391305
