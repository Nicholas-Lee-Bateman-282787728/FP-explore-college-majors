8098807,5,B000CFNYRO,"Let me start by saying, I have an 11 month old golden retriever who is 77 pounds of pure love and energy. However he does so many bad things. He yanks on his chain, never listens, runs after cars, knocks me down, does not take commands and really just breaks my heart. He wants to do well, but just doesn't understand what I want from him. He tries to overcompensate and just gets horribly nervous whenever I ask him to do anything, resulting in things getting knocked down and him getting in trouble. I know I am partly to blame, but I just get so frustrated with him I want to throttle him sometimes.

Anyway, I bought these Barbara Woodhouse tapes a while ago, and finally popped the first one into a tape deck and put my dog on a leash in the living room and we started to watch. We watched Barbara as she tamed dog after dog with simple, easy instructions. She focuses on teaching the owner to talk to the dog, and explains the proper collars, and leashes (leads)that she says will make training easier. Anyway, her shrill British voice and her proper English voice command respect from the most difficult of canines and the dimmest of owners (I would fit into the latter category.)

Within 15 minutes I had the dog heeling. Within another 15 minutes I (she) tought him to sit. I kept on going and within the hour I had him sitting and staying on the other side of the room while I walked away from him.

I made my whole family come down to watch him sit.

The transformation has been remarkable. It has now been four days since I started using Barbara's tapes, and I swear the change in my dog (and my blood pressure) has been phenomenal.

His nervousness is gone. He understands what I want from him and is happy to comply. He now sits, heels, and walks with ease. Yesterday I even ventured out to a public park with him and he acted as though he was in the show ring.

Barbara's easy step by step instructions are wonderful. I give this series five stars. I cannot get over the difference in my dog in just minutes, let alone days. I could sing her praises all day long. I was just sad that I didn't do this training six months ago.

If this sounds like a rave, it is. I can honestly say I have nothing to gain from praising her, except the knowledge that someone else with a troubled dog might benefit.

Cheers,
