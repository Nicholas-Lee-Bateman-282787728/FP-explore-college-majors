4960366,4,B00652U6E2,"I show this in my ""intro"" geology course in college.  I like it - it gives a nice overview of some interesting volcanoes.  I don't mind the CGI - I think it helps the students see what could happen in an eruption, since we haven't been able to video capture all of these eruptions!  I just have two issues - I don't think they ever cover Mt. Fuji!  It is in the description, but I've watched this video a few times and I don't hear about it.  Unless they give it very short shrift, which they shouldn't...Also it would have been nice to include the Hawaiian volcanoes.  I guess they are not really ""deadly,"" but the lava has caused some extensive damage.  Overall, I think it is a good introduction to volcanoes!",1443052800,,712,4.348484848484849

4960371,5,B00652U6E2,This is an excellent program for high school and college-level general education classes.  A good introductory overview of major world volcanoes as well as the efforts of volcanologists to understand and predict their behavior. I don't mind the dramatic presentation since it really keeps the attention of college-level college students.,1338595200,2,337,5.74
4960372,2,B00652U6E2,"For the record, I'm neither disputing the information provided in the documentary, nor am I criticizing the efforts put forth by scientists to attempt to predict when eruptions will occur among the 1500+ extant volcanoes that currently exist around the world.  My biggest complaint about this DVD is with the sensationalist ""gloom and doom"" style tact taken by the producers.  For example, when discussing the potential impact of an eruption by the Yellowstone caldera (i.e., supervolcano), the radio-voiced narrator's tone turns foreboding as he discusses the demise of millions of people, the background music becomes stereotypically tense, and then we are treated to a Hollywood-style CGI volcanic explosion of cataclysmic proportion.  It reminded me of all of those corny ""global disaster"" movies that Hollywood has been fond of making over the last 10 - 15 years.  The documentary utilizes this corny disaster film approach repetitively in the film (e.g., a CGI underwater caldera explosion in Naples, a CGI volcanic mudslide from Mt Rainer that wipes out trees, cars, etc.); after awhile I started joking that hopefully Bruce Willis would jump into the scene to save us all!  From the tone of this film you would think that mankind is just an inch away from annihilation at any given moment.  Even if that is the case, this ""Chicken Little / The-sky-is-falling"" approach to documentation comes off as being hackneyed and trite. It really is too bad - the documentary actually started strong with stunning, real footage of Iceland's volcanic eruption in 2010; after that, the documentary sort of fizzled out.

If you enjoy Hollywood CG disaster films maybe you'll like this.  It was a little too ""make-believe doomsday"" for my tastes.",1332547200,6,1739,5.185714285714286
4960373,3,B00652U6E2,"You don't see melting bodies, ""Raiders of the Lost Ark""-type of stuff.  The point of this work is that scientists are looking for ways to predict the times, strength, and dimensions of future eruptions.

The work said there are 1,500 active volcanoes across the globe.  In the past 2,000 years, approximately 200,000 victims of volcanoes.  When that volcano erupted in Iceland, it stopped transatlantic flights and made companies lose $2 billion dollars!

I'm not into science that much, so all the studying, or trying to study volcanoes wasn't that interesting.  However, geologists and others interested in science would love it.

What I liked were the computer graphics.  They made complicated geological phenomena more understandable.  It was fascinating to see lightning arise in an ash cloud.  I didn't not know Yellowstone was a volcanic area.

This work may be too advanced for elementary school students, but teachers could show this in junior high and high school classes.",1325808000,8,982,5.230769230769231

Okay, to the common human being, especially those not living near a living, breathing mountain, a volcano is an Earth-bound terrorising menace that will coldly (well, actually fiercely hot would be more to the truth) kill people, destroy nature and property and pave over everything in its path, be it trees, roads, buildings, etc.. In a sense this is true, but that's only looking at one aspect of something that, over time and in the long run, benefits us and its host planet much more than the havoc wreaked in the moment.

I would have been a vulconologist as an adult had I any mathematical ability; but I'm not a bad armchair scientist and read voraciously about almost anything ending in ""ogy"". This particular ""ogy"" topic is my favourite.

This video is excellent for anyone new to science and volcanoes, but - like me - not cut out for the heavy mathematics. It is well-narrated, with a crisp, clear voice, which is but what you'd expect - still, that must be noted, for two reasons: many people overlook the narrator and the work it takes to speak and cultivate the voice as they do, and the second reason is I've heard some truly appalling speakers do this. Cringe. So noting the importance of the narrator is key.

The terminology is excellent, as is the explanations of such. The tour of the different volcanoes: strato (also called composite cones), cinder cones, fissures (similar to fumaroles) and the more tame shield volcanoes, such as on Hawai'i and in Canada, is amazing. Unlike some lesser ""documentaries"" that are becoming more and more common on the telly now, this one does not take one or two stock photos per volcano and show it twenty times; this is a true documentary, with incredible videos and still images of the many volcanoes and their features, disposition and eruptive history and behaviour. All of it wrapped up in a wonderful just about one-hour package. Personally, I'd love it if they'd gone for a one-hour series on every active volcano, a half-hour for every dormant volcano and history on the now-extinct ones.

This documentary also gives a detailed look at the Ring of Fire and how volcanism works, through subduction, convection, etc., as well as how volcanoes form in more unexpected locations, such as Yellowstone National Park.

I don't recall if this particular documentary showcases any of the volcanoes, active or otherwise, on Venus, Mars with Olympus Mons, which dwarfs Mount Everest, being three times its height (now, THAT is tall!) and Io, one of Jupiter's 64 known satellites that is incredibly seismically active. There are a few other volcanically active moons and such as well, but that, too, would need its own hour!

Anyone who takes a very large interest in volcanoes after watching this should look on Amazon for books (available depending on how far they have taken it, in print, Kindle or Whisper-Sync and/or Audible formats. I'm currently reading about Yellowstone's magma hotspot, the explosion of Mount Tambora in 1815 (which thus rendered the following year, 1816, as The Year Without a Summer, accurately enough).

In the meantime, this is an excellent starter for those interested in geology's most amazing and visible makers of change, volcanoes! I would have to recognise and support everything produced under the Nova label. This is science made for everyone to enjoy and learn.",1467504000,2,3375,4.940035273368607

8493256,3,B00652U6E2,"Quite disappointed in the scientific content of this PBS put out by NOVA.  There is actually a lot of mythology of cultures and what they believe as far as ""angry gods"" in the earth.  Not quite what I thought it was going to be for my middle school students.  I guess I can ""cut and paste"" the sections of the video that are worthwhile.",1459296000,2,336,4.21875
