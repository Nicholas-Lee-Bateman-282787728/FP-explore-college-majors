2961414,5,B000W4HIYU,"Big Love is HBO's series about a family, struggling to do what's right in the eyes of God and in the eyes of their community, while all the while hiding a very large secret: they are polygamists.

Polygamy being a pretty radical concept for most of us to grasp, this makes for an incredibly interesting launch pad for a series that's now beginning it's 3rd year. Throw in the turmoil caused by 'The Prophet' who wants his cut of the family's  very successful home and garden business, trying to keep three wives in three different houses  with their individual needs and struggles constantly clamoring for attention, children ranging in age from infants to teens, and one man trying to survive it while still remaining the spiritual leader of his family and you've got a hit show!

A soap opera-like drama set in Utah, Big Love has complex characters; some you like, some you don't and some you're not sure how you should feel about them, intertwined in such a way that you can't help wanting more. Yes, polygamy is certainly the tie that binds this drama, but it fades into the background as family and the relationships within the family are really what it's all about. The 'Big Love' that it takes to hold those relationships together through tough times and deceit.

Not a show for the kids, but adults who like an intelligent drama with the occasional humorous scenario thrown in, will enjoy what Big Love has to offer.",1232323200,3,1424,4.68

I have Amazon Prime, and I ordered this one days shipping too - which means if you used the free shipping, it would be $18.00 less to purchase them separately :)

2961417,5,B000W4HIYU,"I love TV series that deliver great entertainment and social commentary in a non-preachy, stereotype busting way, that really make you think and laugh, and sit on edge of your seat, all at the same time.

This series made me reconsider my verdicts on Mormonism, and even (never dreamed I'd say this) on polygamy itself. I still believe polygamy is a landmine with the odds against its success pretty high. But the series shows how it has some novel advantages over monogamy, if the husband and wives have love, a sense of humor, and lots of grit and flexibility....and--absolutely a key--if hubby truly loves all wives ""THE SAME"" (I know, this is Solomonic long shot! Bill pulls it off here though, in quite an endearing way!).
Be ready to chuckle endlessly (e.g. at Bill;s 'heroic' attempt to satisfy all three high-sex-appetite wives, and at Bill's parents' over the top schemes) but also to be serious, thoughtful and root for Bill's kids' realistic and poignant struggles with life in Mormon Utah, and his brother's almost heroic sbility to remain a good man in the nest of a Mormon fundamentalist ""prophet"" Roman (Bill's wife #2 Nicky's father).
Season 2 manages to cast ALL the characters in an even more morally ambiguous, and yet simultaneously more likable, way than Season 1. Although some scenes are almost slapstick but hilarious, others are totally 3 D, melancholy, and believable. Be prepared to LOVE BIG LOVE!",1212364800,11,2022,5.90443686006826
2961418,5,B000W4HIYU,"Wow!  This has to be one of the best television drama series since Six Feet Under and Brothers and Sisters.  It's deep, it's complex, it's a little weird, but then, i guess, polygamy is all these things.  The series explores what life is like in a polygamist mormom family living in Sandy, Utah, with sensitivity and in a non-judgemental way, while not fearing to delve into the more diffcult issues, like sex, kids, and religious issues. Bill Paxton plays the role of the husband, and is exciting to watch in this role that is the pinnacle of his career to date.  He is supported by the amazing Chloe Sevigny, Jeanne Triplehorn, and Ginnifer Goodwin.  The wives have a very complex, very deep relationship, yet although they are close, each one has secrets they cant reveal to their sister wives.  This series is a must see for anyone who loves quality drama, credible acting, great storylines, and is fascinated by the secret life of polygamists.

I love it.  It's a little unrealistic, but it's a good story.

What I didn't like was that I pre-ordered both seasons in a box set and when I opened up season 2 to watch it, I had two ""Disc 3"" discs instead of Discs 1-4.

I'm in Afghanistan on a small FOB and lacking a postal service.  We get mail in, but we have no way to ship it out except every 4 months when postal comes.

I decided to go ahead and pick up disc 2, but I feel like I'm missing a lot.

So, I give it a 5 for the show.  Very well done with unexpected twists.

8221189,5,B000W4HIYU,"My wife and I like to watch DVDs as late night television entertainment. We've been watching a variety of old TV series: Star Trek, Deep Space Nine, Poirot, Murder, She Wrote, etc. We like the little stories without any commercial or other breaks. We can watch one or two episodes per night and we try to keep it light entertainment. It's a good relaxing break after putting the baby to bed and before we get ready for bedtime.

One series my wife chose was ""Big Love,"" a former HBO series involving plural marriage in Utah. One man is married to three women and living comfortably in a nice little Utah suburb in three close side-by-side houses. Everything is disguised to look like three separate families, but, in fact. it's three wives living in three different houses and sharing a husband who roams from house to house on a scheduled basis. The series has to do with all the situations the adults and their offspring encounter and how they manage to cope with it. Also, it involves the complicated interaction of the three wives with one another and with the husband. Plus, there's all the children. Of course, religion enters in so there's a liberal religious (mainly Mormon, naturally) undertone to the whole setup. It's an interesting series and the cast does an excellent job.

I find ""Big Love"" only so-so watching and I find it interesting but I don't get deeply involved, but my wife finds it absolutely compelling. I don't really understand why and don't ask many in-depth questions to find out why. I suppose it's just another world and a little peek in. In any case, we've completed Seasons One and Two and, after a break of several months, my wife came up with Season 3 while browsing through the DVD bins at our local Warehouse club store. Of course we had to have it and we've already watched the first tow episodes.

8221190,2,B000W4HIYU,"This review has nothing to do with the quality of the show itself, but with the particular product for which i see no reason of existence, unless the price drops dramaticaly. The rules of the free market along with common sense have been thrown in the garbage, in the hope that the buyers are careless enough to not notice the outrageous pricing ? Why should anyone pay $82 for the first 2 seasons when each one is sold seperately for $24.49, is really, really beyond me...This is not a blu ray version or an improved edition from what i can tell, unless i am missing something. So what is the reason for such a vast difference? Is it that the discs are offered in a double case that takes less space on the bookshelve than the two single ones and therefor you may save a few centimeters which justifies paying nearly double? Not even that...Judging from the pictures, you are buying the identical two single cased seasons. The only difference is that you pay much more... Pure lunacy...Just do the math and stay away from this one!",1253491200,,1032,4.524064171122995
8221191,5,B000W4HIYU,"i have been a big fan of Big Love from the beginning.  Getting over the polygamy part early on, you're able to get involved in these families' lives and empathize with the same struggles that every family goes through.  It has a very strong cast, particularly the wives, as well as Harry Dean Stanton, who really makes the best villian.  There are significant complexities that make it captivating, even season after season, that keep you coming back.  I would definitely recommend this series and make sure you watch from the beginning.",1246060800,,537,4.868131868131868

You really get to know each and every person,and it keeps you watching to see whats happening to them. I actually admit I did not think I would care for a show about a man with 3 wives. However,I love it. It is addictive. I hope the show lasts for many seasons.",1243036800,,409,3.9397590361445785

8221195,5,B000W4HIYU,"It's amazing how much drama the producers are able to fit into a one-hour segment.  I LOVE this show.  Every episode leaves you begging to know what happens next.  I started watching Big Love on Season 3 on HBO... And was able to watch all of the Season 2 re-runs when they did a marathon.  After Season 3 ended though, I had withdrawals, so I thought it was a perfect opportunity to buy the Season 1 and 2 bundle to catch up.  It's an excellent show.  Another plus, is the great choice of music used in some of the episodes.  Although this is a DVD set, we play them in our Blu-Ray player on the 52"" flat-screen, and the picture is still magnificent.  ""Big Love"", in my opinion, is what makes HBO worth having on your TV.  The producers picked the best actors to play each part.  Bill Paxton is great ofcourse. 'Barb' is my favorite wife on the show, 'Marg' is the fun, young, flirty wife who's trying to adjust to this new life, and 'Nicki' is the wife everyone loves to hate. The supporting actors are wild, and sometimes wildly funny in their own eerie way. If you are looking for a show packed with drama, various emotion, and twists, this should do it!",1240790400,2,1158,4.319444444444445
