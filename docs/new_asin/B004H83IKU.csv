4375285,4,B004H83IKU,"This is the first time I've addressed a product I have yet to see, but I DO know that I paid a great deal of attention to it when it first aired in 1958.  I was in high school, there were no vcrs in anyone's daily thought, but there WERE those huge clunky reel to reel recorders and I was luck enough to have one.  There were no plug in spots for sound on the t.v., so I had to negotiate with my family to watch and not utter a sound or leave the room.  This way allowed me to tape the soundtrack (did the same thing for WONDERFUL TOWN when Rosalind Russell and Sidney Chaplin did it) and listen to whatever lps were available of the shows.  And now, here it is ready to watch and capture a part of my youth....as with CINDERELLA and the few other kinescope recordings, color was not available...to bad.  And also, one of the reviewers mentioned that the MGM version was not in wide screen.  Well, after originally seeing it in real 3D with polaroid glasses in the early 50's, Turner Classic Movies aired MGM's KISS ME KATE in, ready for this, letterbox.  I was smart enough to record a dvd of it and have it with the public dvd and it's interesting to see how the 35mm version cuts off a bit of the sides and gives more of the top and bottom of the film.  And now that we have 3D tv, why not re-release blue ray 3D versions of KISS ME KATE and HOUSE OF WAX (both part of the Turner, Warner Bros. library).  And I believe there are more worthwhile 3D films from the 50's that would find a new audience.  Anyone have a connection?",1312156800,3,1529,4.135135135135135
4375286,5,B004H83IKU,"So many great stage performances have been lost.  There is so little available of Mary Martin for example even though she created many great roles.  Alfred Drake is another actor who excelled on the stage but left little behind.  Because of the rarity of a preserved Drake performances this video is important.  This video comes the closest to how Kiss me, Kate looked on the stage.  Yes it is a cut version.  True the images are very soft, but every kinescope I have seen has very low contrast and appears washed out.  Accept it for what it is, one of the few windows into a period that cannot be recalled any other way.",1311379200,4,621,4.442477876106195
4375287,5,B004H83IKU,"I first saw this Cole Porter treasure when I was thirteen and wanted a copy for my own for the past 53 years. Well,finally--and by accident--I discovered a copy for sale recently and was delighted to find that it lived up to my memory of it. It is a welcome addition to  my my DVD collection.",1311033600,4,292,4.214285714285714
4375288,5,B004H83IKU,"Kiss Me Kate may be the perfect Broadway musical. The show opened the night before New Years Eve in 1948, and ran at the New Century Theatre for 1,077 performances, garnering Tonys for Best Musical, Book and Score. The 1953 film may not please everyone, with the chilly Kathryn Grayson and a wooden Howard Keel, but who could fault the whiz bang tapping and bubbly over-the-top tapping of Ann Miller? Originally shot in 3D, parts of the film (especially Annie's performance), are literally thrown at the audience. The ""Too Darn Hot"" number introduced the world to the genius known as Bob Fosse, not to mention the terpsichorean splendor of the lesser-known Carol Haney, Bobby Van and Tommy Rall.
  A production of Kate done in front of a live audience in London was released by Image Entertainment in 2003, starring the studly Brent Barrett and the incredibly talented Rachel York. Perhaps a little forced, as taped stage productions tend to be, the real pleasure here is the complete score, played and performed to near perfection. This truly was Cole Porter's masterpiece, recreated here in all its glory.
  However, we now have a black-and-white version of the 1958 Hallmark Hall of Fame production, the first Hallmark produced that was taped rather than done live. Released by the ambitious Video Artists International, the results for musical comedy fans are absolutely stupendous. We have Alfred Drake and Patricia Morison recreating their Broadway triumph, and triumphal it is indeed. Drake's pathos and subtlety in the great love ballad ""Were Thine That Special Face"" is easily matched by the bombast and exuberance of Morison banging away with ""I Hate Men;"" every nuance and meaning of every lyric is clearly, movingly, and expertly delivered.
  We do lose Lisa Kirk, who originated the role of Lois/Bianca in the original, but we get a youthful, sexy and wildly inviting Julie Wilson, in the role which Wilson originated in the London production. The gangsters are played with verve and aplomb by a pre-Gypsy Jack Klugman and a pre-Bilko Harvey Lembeck. There is no musical comedy fan alive who won't salivate over this DVD. Purchase it immediately and return to those thrilling days of yesteryear when style, glamour, and talent were paramount. You won't be disappointed.",1301443200,17,2282,5.072
4375289,5,B004H83IKU,"I've been a fan of Patricia Morison for some time now. She was underused in Hollywood movies, but to me Morison was one of the most beautiful actresses ever in film or on the stage.
Her natural grace and elegance were enhanced by very long hair that she wore mostly up in a large chignon. This vintage TV recording of Kiss Me Kate is a treat because in it Morison finally allows her very long hair to briefly (too briefly) flow free, in the interest of the plot. Her singing and acting are impeccable, and I am grateful that this DVD exists.

For other fans of Patricia Morison, I might mention that in the film ""Sofia"", starring Gene Raymond - DVD sold here on Amazon - there is also a short scene in which Morison's thick, hip-length hair is worn loose.",1301443200,4,755,4.3546099290780145
4375290,4,B004H83IKU,"This is the most recent dvd presentation of Cole Porter's biggest hit, Kiss Me, Kate.  It is a black and white kinescope of a Hallmark Hall of Fame television production featuring the original Broadway leads, Patricia Morison and Alfred Drake.  Its presentation in 1958 is sandwiched between the 1953 movie (with Kathryn Grayson and Howard Keel) and the 2003 PBS special (with Rachel York and Brent Barrett).

Each of the productions has its unique strengths, and they all do justice (in their own fashion) to the brilliant music of Cole Porter.  But this version will not be to everyone's liking, principally because its video (and to a much lesser extent, its audio) quality leaves a lot to be desired.  Contrast is rendered in shades of gray on gray;  the kinescope process does not eliminate soft flickering lines that scroll sporadically up the screen, and focus is somewhat uneven.  In my first viewing, it took me a good 20 minutes to get over my pique at the mediocre video quality, but the show was too good to let me keep pouting for long.  In addition to the great music, the leads, Patricia Morison and Alfred Drake, are fabulous.  She is absolutely beautiful, and her intelligence and artistry as an actress, along with her charisma place her--easily--in the top spot  of the three dvd characterizations of Kate.  Her stage presence shines in so many small ways; in the antechamber of the honeymoon bedroom scene, for example, she ""plays"" her lustrous long dark hair (she doesn't wear a wig) to brilliant comic effect, and when she smiles, no one's worried about the picture's grayness.  Alfred Drake is no slouch either, and his rich baritone, along with his comedic skill, give him an edge over Howard Keel, or the macho crotch-grabbing Brent Barrett. Both Morison and Drake also had a lot of experience in these roles, which made for especially nuanced performances;  each lets her/his stage persona's emotional vulnerability seep, subtly and poignantly, through their hard-nosed egocentric facades.

The PBS production, on the other hand, is strengthened by technical advantages.  It is in high definition widescreen color, and it has Dolby Digital and DTS surround sound (the Hallmark production is in mono).  This 2003 performance is also more than two hours long, whereas the movie is 110 minutes, and the Hallmark show is only 78 minutes long.

If I had to pick only one, though, it would have to be the movie, as an ideal compromise.  Although the picture is not widescreen, it is sharp, and it is in color.  The leads are good, and the dancing which features Ann Miller, Tommy Rall, Bob Fosse, Carol Haney et al, is of the highest musical-comedy order, and James Whitmore and Keenan Wynn easily take home the honors as the good-natured thugs, who encourage us to brush up on our Shakespeare.  The movie also sports a Dolby Digital Surround (5.1) soundtrack.  Enjoy!",1297900800,26,2888,4.901234567901234
4375291,4,B004H83IKU,"A Broadway gem is discovered with this 1958 ""Hallmark Hall Of Fame"" TV adaptation of Cole Porter's ""Kiss Me, Kate."" In the Golden Age of television, it was fairly common for Broadway shows to receive TV adaptations.
These included Ethel Merman in ""Anything Goes"" (1954), Mary Martin in ""Peter Pan"" (1955, 1956, and 1960) and Julie Andrews in ""Rodgers and Hammerstein's ""Cinderella"" (1957). ""Cinderella"" was actually an original musical for television that subsequently enjoyed a healthy life on stage.
  This Black and White (kinescope)  ""Kiss Me, Kate"" has the distinct advantage of Alfred Drake and Patricia Morrison re-creating their original Broadway roles from a decade earlier. Drake and Morrison are superb as tempermental Fred Graham and Lili Vanessi, feuding former spouses who reunite for a musical version of Shakespeare's ""Taming Of The Shrew"" on the first anniversary of their divorce. Fred and Lili's backstage brawling humorously mirrors the plot of ""Shrew"", which is occuring  simultaneously  on stage.
  Alfred Drake lost his starring Broadway roles in ""Kiss Me, Kate"" and ""Kismet"" to Howard Keel when these musicals were made into movies. The charismatic Drake leaves no doubt that he is the definite Fred/Petruchio in ""Kate."" Julie Wilson, from the original London Cast, replaces Lisa Kirk here as lusty Lois. Harvey Lembeck and Jack Klugman almost steal the show as two gangters who get involved in the plot, both backstage and on stage,  when Lois' gambling boyfriend Bill (the handsome Bill Hayes) signs Fred's name to an IOU. A few months after this broadcast, Jack Klugman orginated the role of Herbie opposite Ethel Merman as Rose in the original 1959 production of the Broadway classic ""Gypsy.""
  The 78 minute running time does result in an abbreviated plot and score. The showstopping ""Too Darn Hot"" is unfortunately cut. Cole Porter's sexually suggestive lyrics were probably too hot for TV in 1958. ""Were Thine That Special Face?"" and ""Biancha"" are also cut, but not terribly missed or important. The rest of Cole Porter's sparkling score remains, more or less, intact. Despite the abbreviations, this production is a million times more entertaining than the ridiculously sanitized MGM Cinemascope and color 1953 movie version. For fans who want a complete ""Kiss Me, Kate"" in color, PBS' ""Great Performances"" captured the most recent London revival on DVD, starring the excellent Brent Barrett and Rachel York. I have both versions, side by side, in my DVD cabinet.",1297814400,49,2495,5.230576441102757
4375302,5,B004H83IKU,"""Kiss me Kate"" is one of my favorite modern versions of Shakespeare's ""The Taming of the Shrew"". Howard Keel and Kathryn Grayson are a fascinating romantic and pugilistic pair and I get a kick every time Kate yells, ""You louse,"" at Keel.

Patricia Morison is in great voice as well and the direction is terrific--the two leads even play to the camera at times when they're trying to one up each other.

4375330,5,B004H83IKU,"""Kiss Me, Kate"" is, in my opinion, Cole Porter's greatest musical, and this DVD captures the two original leads in their classic roles in a made for TV version recorded about a decade after the show's opening. The video, in black and white, has some extremely minor glitches, but the sound is superb. My only caveat for Porter and ""Kate"" devotees is that the song ""Too Darn Hot"" is omitted. I don't know if this was cut to make the show fit the TV time slot, or if the song was just ""Too Darn Hot"" for 1950s TV censors. Regardless, this is great theater, great music and even great television. (Oh, and seeing Jack Klugman and Harvey Lembeck singing and dancing ""Brush Up Your Shakespeare"" is worth the price of the video!)",1313366400,2,723,4.484848484848484
8429349,3,B004H83IKU,"I looked forward to watching this Hallmark Hall of Fame TV production of ""Kiss Me Kate with Alfred Drake and Patricia Morison,"" having only seen MGM's Howard Keel and Katherine Grayson version in the past. Neither is the absolute victor in a comparison between the two with both having their assets and deficits. One of the problems with the Hollywood version is that some songs (and good ones) had to be chopped to accommodate changes made in the story and running time. I am also not a big fan of Katherine Grayson's tremmelo and I thought that both Patricia Morison's singing and comic readings of her lines exceeded those of Ms. Grayson. On the other hand Howard Keel is a hard act to follow even though it was he that followed Drake's stage performance. The MGM version's biggest improvement over both the theatrical and Hallmark TV productions is Hermes Pan's choreography. For example, the Hallmark ""Tom, Dick, or Harry"" numbers seems virtually static when compared with the MGM extended dance-filled rendition of the number that features Ann Miller, Bobby Van, and Bob Fosse. This example can be multiplied many times over.

If I had to make a choice between which of the two versions I now prefer, I would go with the MGM version, mostly on the strength that Howard Keel, Ann Miller, and Pan's choreography lend to it.",1528070400,,1327,4.794759825327511
8429350,4,B004H83IKU,"Divorced theater actors Fred (Howard Keel) and Lilli (Kathryn Grayson) team up again to play a musical version of Shakespeare's the Taming of the Shrew, igniting a full range of emotions between the two. The situation is not helped by Fred's flirtation with another actress, Lois (Ann Miller), and finally Lilli quits in mid play. In the meantime, Lois's boyfriend Bill (Tommy Rall) runs up a debt with gangsters, but signs Fred's name. Things grow more complicated when the gangsters (played by James Whitmore and Keenan Wynn) arrive to collect the money, and refuse to let Lilli leave. All the while, the play within a play is on-going as well, adding a further dimension to plot.

It may sound complicated, but the beauty of Dorothy Kingsley's screenplay (which was nominated for a Writers Guild of America Award) is how well it flows, weaving all the subplots in and out, and finally tying them together.  Keel and Grayson are excellently matched, with both having superb singing voices.  Miller, as always, steals the spotlight with her vivacity and dancing skill--helped, of course, by Hermes Pan's excellent choreography.  Costumes and sets are cheerful and colorful and look great all around.  The star of the show, however, is Cole Porter: his clever lyrics and lovely music are the groundwork that the builds this fine film.

What I dislike about this movie is that it highlights the Taming of the Shrew (a horrible play) in a positive, even idolizing, light.  The modern part of the plot follows the Taming some, showing male dominance and female subservience as the expected outcome between a man and a woman.  I realize the movie is only showing the societal norm for the 1950s, and as such can enjoy the rest of the film without being affected.

The bottom line is that Kiss Me Kate is a fun, lively movie, with a few flaws, but still good enough for a universal recommendation.",1526688000,,1892,4.850931677018633

Okay.  Drake and Morrison (the whole cast actually) knew what they were doing.  Only I thought Fred was supposed to be pompous.  Three songs were left out, two I liked a lot.  Lots of choruses were left out (probably to fit a 3 hour show into 78 minutes).  Some lines (by no means all) were cleaned up.  Nothing like I had expected.
