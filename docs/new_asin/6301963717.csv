382976,5,6301963717,"When I saw the film Miller's Crossing for the first time, I will admit that I didn't really understand the story or the plot. After watching this film about four or five more times, I feel that this film was badly  overlooked by many critics and especially by the American Film Institute's  100 Greatest Films . So many directors have tried to film a unique gangster  film that will achieve it's own place in American film history, only to  fail miserably. Miller's  Crossing is a crowning achievement in  cinematography, screenwriting, and acting. The Coen brothers show their  audience a true side of organized crime in the 1920's. The Godfather is the  greatest mafia movie that was ever made, but Miller's Crossing is the only  film that has ever come close to challenging Francis Ford Coppola's  masterpiece.",916444800,,813,4.911764705882353
382977,3,6301963717,"It's the 1920s in a big, corrupt city controlled by gangsters. Violence, stupidity, backstabbing and greed are everywhere. There are beatings, shootings, burnings, and broken glass. It's always dark, even during the  day. Anyone who doesn't end up dead ends up unhappy.",914284800,4,269,5.404761904761905
382978,5,6301963717,"This film, inspired by the Dashiell Hammett novel ""The Glass Key"", the film of the same name, and Akira Kurosawa's ""Yojimbo"", is a beautifully shot, intricately plotted, and  wonderfully acted piece of film noir art.  Gabriel Byrne, in his best role  ever, plays Tommy, the right hand man to Leo(Albert Finney, who's  terrific), the Irish head of organized crime in an unnamed city in the  1920's-1930's.  He finds himself caught between Leo and the head of an  Italian crime gang, Johnny Caspar, played by Jon Polito, in a gang war over  turf and a fight hustler named Bernie ""the Shmatta"" Bernbaum,  played by John Turturro.  To reveal more would be a crime in itself.  Catch  director Sam Raimi (Evil Dead 2, Darkman, A Simple Plan) playing a trigger  happy cop on a raid.  One of the best gangster films since ""The  Godfather.""",911606400,4,831,4.753521126760563

383076,5,6301963717,"What you see in Miller's Crossing is not what you get, believe me. This film belongs to Gabriel Byrne who plays Tom Reagan. Tom is a hero, anti-hero, maybe, in this gangster film. The Coen Bros, those wonderful film guys, have written and directed this film. You can tell from the very beginning when this marvelous music overpowers you that a Coen film is here.

Tom Reagan is an assistant of sorts to Leo, played by Albert Finney. Leo is the crime boss, and the entire city revolves around him. Both Tom and Leo have an affinity for Verna, played by Marsha Gay Harden, though Leo is at first not aware of this. Jon Polito who plays Johnny Caspar, Leo's opposite. John has a thing for ""business ethics."", which makes me laugh when you see his temper and his antics.  One of the most interesting characters is Bernie Bernbaum, played by John Turrtora. A weasel loved by his sister, Verna, and for whom everything falls apart.  The action is violent, beatings a plenty, gunfights a plenty, lots of booze, some sex, but nothing seen. A Coen film must be seen.

383191,4,6301963717,"Millers Crossing is a very good crime noir  set in the gangster time period of the mid 1920s.  The acting is very good throughout the film and the movie seems to have just the right mix of action intrigue and suspense.  I would rate this movie 4  stars.  The music is chilling in a good way and I enjoyed the pacing of the movie.  The lead actor Gabriel Byrne is excellent as a mob advisor looking at all the angles and trying to play both sides against each other.

The only thing I take issue with in this movie is that Tom Reagan never seems to take any physical damage from all the punches he takes to his body.  You never see any bruising, busted lips, black eyes, swollen stomach on Tom.  In each scene the guy looks normal as can be after he just got the crap beat out of him in the previous scene.  Also I thought it was a stretch to see Leo jump out of the upstairs window of his house and spring back up to his feet like he was in his 20s instead of his late 50s to early 60s.

In the next scene Leo shoots an intruder in the bedroom of his home 100 times before he falls to the ground, Ill call BS on that one to.  The goon probably would have fallen after 6 shots and not stayed on his feet.  These physical details hurt the movie after multiple viewing.  If the hero could have shown damage like Jack Nickelsons character in Chinatown it would have added a lot more weight to the movie.

Millers Crossing has your typical gangster elements but it doesnt play them out in the same old way.  I thought it was funny to see the police force totally corrupt going back and forth with their allegiance.  The same way I thought it was funny to see Casper struggling to be the big boss and run the whole show complaining that it isn't easy.  It probably gave Casper new found respect for Leo, how he kept it all together running the city, while at the same time despising him and trying to carve his own legacy which doesnt last long.

It was a little hard to believe that Casper would take Tom's world over that of The Dane his long time trusted lieutenant.  I don't think the movie resolves how Tom ended up paying off the large gambling debts he racked up to a loan shark.

It is truly a unique film and stands apart.  I love the time period, I would have even liked to have seen all the boxer matches they keep talking about that had the fix on.  It is funny to watch Casper bitch and whine about ethics while they are trying to rig a boxing match.

I really enjoy the movie and would recommend it.  I bought the movie for around $5 plus a few dollars shipping and handling.  The movie is well worth the low price tag.",1484092800,,2627,4.142292490118577

383198,5,6301963717,"If you don't know about Coen movies, then you need to start.  This is a solid member of the Coen brothers arsenal of fascinating, layered, thoughtful but suspenseful movies.  Coen brothers can get a little weird, though (Barton Fink), so if you don't have the stomach for the weirdness of Coen Brother's, don't worry, this stays within the mob movie genre to make anyone who enjoys a good mob movie happy, while pushing the edges of the genre - as Coen brother do - to make it interesting and tantalizing for people who are a bit bored with Godfather and Goodfella re-runs.  This is more an early era mob movie, which makes it a little different than the typical genre, and doesn't attempt to mirror real mob history at all, so it's much more playful in that sense.

I planned ALL of this so you could see the type of guy I really am - all knowing,  all seeing and pretty damn lucky (just not at gambling).""  I know I am really picky but a story should have some spontaneity to it. This one seemed too artificial and unrealistic, hence 3 stars. Tom wasn't Leo's right-hand man for no reason.

film that much better and really has that 40's film noir gangster look and feel. It's one of those over looked classics that should be considered

383755,3,6301963717,"The Coen Brothers have some fooled into thinking that they are significant filmmakers (pardon me while I chuckle) in today's age, but (as the failed novelists that they are in reality) they hoodwink the movie nerds into thinking that their screenplays are pieces of brilliance when in fact they are some of the most emotionally aloof, structurally confusing, and coldly photographed pictures in recent memory (please, let me tell you about the dark side first, okay?). And there is no screenplay more confusing than ""Miller's Crossing,"" which actually uses the story's confusing aspects to its advantage--it's not that I don't understand what is going on, but I wonder why the Coen's try to mask the story's shallowness by making it so convoluted and empty intellectually? Albert Finney is of course very watchable here, and his performance is a bit like watching a hungry dog searching for a piece of ripe meat inside of a screenplay that only provides him with a few bits left on the bone. But at least the Coen Brothers do not try to hide their blatant sadism and intellectual grave-robbing. ""Miller's Crossing"" elevates violence to grim and severely unpleasant levels--teeth are loosened, there are brutal beatings and fist-fights that will make your jaw sore just by watching them, there are shoot-outs that would give Scorsese nightmares, and there are sadistic jokes (ranging from a man whacked in the chops with a chimney sweep to a man hurling up odious bile thinking that his ass may be grass in a matter of moments for not having done what he was supposed to, the ass) but the moment that takes the cake is when Finney blows the toes, feet, and chest biblits out of a gangster hit man with a tommy-gun that not once ever has to be reloaded. The Coen boys have an obsession with head wounds, and Finney gets in a good one here (as good as Storemare's headshot to the copper in ""Fargo"") against a hit man stalking him. Don't watch this one right after you eat--I forgot how brutal this one actually is and heck I like violent movies! As far as the film's story, there is nothing original here AT ALL, other than the style of the picture, and I confess that Barry Sonnenfeld's lush lighting and crisp cinematography is the picture's major selling point overall. But the movie merely pays lip service to Dashiell Hammett and James M. Cain rather than trying to seek out its own voice. Maybe the newer fans can get behind the Coen Brothers's ""originality"", but there are those of us who refuse to be fooled.
However, there is a plus side to all of this. Marcia Gay Harden (as Verna) is drop dead gorgeous here--her lips and hair are incredible, and what a figure! She is easy upon the eyes and kept me watching. Another face worth mentioning is J. E. Freeman--he is an extraordinary film noir-type/gangster picture actor who truly has the menacing look and tall physique to make this particular character come to life. ""Miller's Crossing"" doesn't look like any other movie, and for this aspect alone it can be recommended for its opulent visual qualities. But while the Coen Brothers's socially awkward sense of humor excels in other pictures (like ""Fargo""), here it is almost absent in that the story takes itself way too seriously and there is a depressing feeling floating about. It's not as depressing as ""Barton Fink,"" but what other movie is? I also enjoy gangster movies a great deal, so this one also holds a bit of nostalgic quality for me, but not so much to fool me into pushing it up into the five start register. The dialogue is also an issue. Sometimes it's snappy, sometimes it truly works--other times, it seems as if the Coen Brothers are both behind the times and in front of them at the same time (and the swear word ""god damn"" is said about twenty times in the first forty minutes alone, but there are no 'f' bombs dropping here). The picture is exciting visually, but the story is so punch drunk that it is hard to tell whether or not any of this matters at all (and I confess to having enjoyed many scenes throughout).
The Coen Brothers almost had me fooled as a young critic and movie lover, and there are some of their films that are still funny and still enjoyable on many levels. But what no fan boy will ever cop to is that much of their screenplay work is just damn lazy. Start picking apart the threads in the movie (and if you are a Coen Brothers fan, you'll take the time to do just that) and you find more loose stitches than in the Frankenstein monster. But the costumes, the music, the period detail, the atmosphere, and the lovely miss Harden make the film a visual feast--but it's all homage, nothing much else. The Coen boys may be the masters of the post-modern pastiche tribute style, but in the older days they hadn't completely lost touch with their more rational cinematic faculties. So...you decide. C+ (for the DVD presentation, and the great Sonnenfeld extra)

And that DVD cover! Yeesh! It looks like two insurance salesmen are chasing Turturro into the woods to watch him find a bush before he fills his shorts! I can't believe this one, it looks like dog vomit to me. And the dogs return apparently...",1430352000,,5155,4.652412280701754

The biggest issue I have is with the main character, I don't like him and he's unrealistic.  He's rude and demeaning to viscous people who are his bosses, which is almost never allowed in real life, and he's also someone that is a know-it-all about things that are highly subjective (such as what people are feeling, or what they will do, or using chains of logic such as 'this will happen, then that will happen, which will trigger that, and then this guy will do such and such a result' etc).

But is does not diminish the impact of one of the very best Coen brother's movies that can also be ranked right up there with ""The Godfather"" and ""Goodfellas"" as one of the greatest gangster films to ever grace the screen.  The images conjured are magnificent from tommy guns out of control to a single hat gliding ever so gracefully in a quiet forest.  The Coens spin a tale of gang rivalry during the Prohibition era in an unidentified city that could be Chicago or New York (although shot in New Orleans).

I thought this movie established a grave and intelligent tone better than ""The Godfather,"" and avoided some of the stagey, macho posturing of ""The Godfather.""  I actually felt like this was less cheesy and better than ""The Godfather.""

Gabriel Byrne brings an awesome gravity and seriousness to the role, and this movie does the opposite of insulting your intelligence.

383990,3,6301963717,"Never saw a Coen Bros. film I didn't like, but this one is the first I have no desire to see a 2nd time.  The plot had the usual twists typical of the Coens, but unfortunately the main character, played by Gabriel Byrne, who is on screen most of the time, is kind of boring, just no star sizzle there, and in fact the thing only comes alive when short, pudgy, bald Jon Polito is hamming it up as an Italian crime boss.  The dialogue is snappy - TOO snappy, it seems forced, not natural.  Byrne and Marcia Gay Harden have no chemistry at all playing out a love/hate relationship.  They seem to be striving for the cattiness between Glenn Ford and Rita Hayworth in ""Gilda,"" but their scenes together just don't click.  I didn't get bored, and the plot device of a faked ""whack"" was novel, but the characters generally seemed flat, even Albert Finney as an Irish crime lord, though his scene using a tommy gun is well staged.

384213,5,6301963717,"Seeing this again for the first time in 20+ years, I was delighted to find my original responses confirmed and to see again some of the images I remember from all that time ago (I didn't remember the plot so well!). Generically it's impossible really to place -- like most of the Coens' work, and all the more engaging and surprising for that. In one of the ""extras"" with this DVD, Turturro comments that he thinks it's about a man who loses his soul -- Tom Reagan, played by Gabriel Byrne. I don't see it that way -- rather I see him as a man intellectually and emotionally mature who gets worn down by people who are less smart and more emotionally immature than he is. He is in a sense let down in places where he looks for trust, and his motives become self-protective only after the man who owes him his life, Bernie the bookie (Turturro), refuses to ""disappear"" and comes back to shake him down and, of course, put his life at risk. Then the intelligence kicks in, and the adjective ""Machiavellian"" (that one reviewer uses) becomes apt. Up to that point, he has been a voice of reason and a seeker after loyalty and affection, and willing to GIVE loyalty and affection in turn. There's too much humor in the movie for Tom to be seen as a tragic figure, but at the end he's isolated and disappointed, and the fact that his life is no longer in danger seems hardly to compensate for that. He's not perfect, even early in the movie -- he drinks too much and gambles recklessly -- and he's on the receiving end of many beatings for his sins, but by the end we feel that he is still a person of substance in a movie where most characters are driven by impulse and appetite.

Even in 1990, the Coen brothers were showing an ability to flawlessly suggest a particular time and place -- the 1920's of Irish and Italian gangs in warfare in cities. Costumes and settings are lovingly attended to, and the movie, at every point, looks great, with the outdoor non-urban scenes at Miller's Crossing memorably staged and shot. The cast is stellar: Albert Finney is the Irish boss to whom Tom is as loyal as he can be until he is rejected, mainly because of his honesty (no spoiler here). Jon Polito has a great comic turn as an Italian boss who want to take over Finney's turf, which includes having the mayor and police chief in his pocket. By the time Tom hooks up with him, he (Tom) is pretty much in self-protective mode. Marcia Gay Harden is Bernie's sister, desired by both Tom and Leo, Finney's character. The performances are uniformly superb, and the visual rhythms of the film are simply stunning. Add to that a soundtrack with an Irish feel -- a correlative of the kind of sentiment the movie deals in -- and it adds up to a great experience. The staging and choreography of the violent scenes are carefully done, and the audience's reactions to them are carefully gauged, insofar as these things can be managed. It's said and implied by some characters in the movie that Tom has no heart -- but he does, and so does the movie.",1390867200,,3030,4.43010752688172

I like movies based on plays, yet this is not one of them.

What is it?

This movie is framed beautifully.
It has wonderful dialogue that creates a sense of a mob movie without it really being one.
I say that only because the mob sense is really more setting.  It's not action packed. It's not realistic.  It's not a mob movie.  It's a drama cast therein.

The acting and staging are strong.  The scenes are constructed and edited to beauty.

The scene when they come to get Albert Finney is worth seeing the movie alone.

The idioms that percolate through the narrative are curious, but become iconic by the movie's conclusion.

So many icons in the film beyond the hat and its leitmotif.

The dialogue is strong and smells of film noir, but it's a new language, even though the film is years old.
Fully fiction. There is no real setting here, but you are taken to this place where the mob talks hard and eloquent and new, and may not have the Mamet stammer.

384463,5,6301963717,"A masterpiece of a gangster flick. Set during Prohibition era, 'Miller's Crossing' never gets old - it actually seems to get even better with each viewing. The film stars the awesome and legendary Al Finney as mob boss Leo and it revolves around him and his off-the-boat lackey (Byrne) doing battle with an ambitious Italian Mafioso (Polito) trying to muscle in on Irish turf. It has an old-school feel to it that is rarely perfected elsewhere, and everything from the sets, costume design, dialogue and screenplay is superbly crafted and balanced by the Coen brothers. The scene when Leo turns-the-tables on the gang of hitters intruding on his sprawling mansion with Danny Boy playing in the backround would have made even Cagney weep with envy.

In Fargo, The Big Lebowski, and No Country For Old Men, the protagonists are all people who think they know more than they do, but are undone by the presence of an elemental evil (except in Lebowski, in which the evil is played for laughs). Coen Bros. films are almost always about self-delusions and how they punish the people who revel in them. In Miller's Crossing, Gabriel Byrne's Tom is the proverbial Cassandra, who pretty much always tells the truth but nobody believes him. Everyone else believes what they choose to believe. The theme of evil vs. innocence is here inverted into evil vs. ignorance. I could go on, but I'd have to write a dissertation. Suffice to say that every scene is a gem, and Byrne's performance is stunning. Albert Finney makes a great berk of a mob boss, Jon Polito shows why the Coens kept casting him in other films, and J.

This blu ray disc reproduced some of the beautiful scenes e.g. in the forest but failed to tone down the makeup which made all men wore red lipsticks.  22 years on, the film now looks a bit flashy with a hollow center.  It is mainly due to the lacking of deeper explorations or descriptions of the 3 main charactors, the 2 gangsters and Gabriel Byrne's charactor, critically the latter.  How good a right hand man was he?  Why was he so like by his boss, even after he betrayed him?  Was he really heartless or souless?  Are they simply small time hoods?  It is all very ambiguous.

384597,3,6301963717,"Eddie Dane, played by J. E. Freeman, is a smart, ruthless lieutenant to one of the mob bosses in this film, and he is not the main character.  But long before this film was half over I had pretty much settled on ""The Dane"" as the one character I liked, primarily because he's one of the few characters in the film who seems real enough to suit me.  In other words, he doesn't seem like some Hollywood scriptwriter's idea of what a quirky droll parody of a gangster should be like.  Which pretty describes everybody else in this film.

Okay, Albert Finney does a fine job, for what little we see of him, and the rest of the cast does too, but the material they're handed in terms of script really just does not belong in the same league as Godfather and Goodfellas, two films which do what they do with very few missteps, if any.

Now the whole point of Miller's Crossing is Tom Reagan, played by Gabriel Byrne.  He's albert Finney's top lieutenant.  But what's he up to, really?  Why does he do what he does?  I mean, he does kill a guy, not in self-defense, but does that make him a good bad-guy, or a bad bad-guy, or some guy who walks a fine line, or just a guy who has a low tolerance for being messed with more than once?  Maybe he's got one of those personal ""codes"" of honor that explains everything.  I'm not really sure.  But I've only watched the film once, so who knows?

I compare this film to Sin City because it frequently leans toward exaggeration.  The dialogue given to Johnny Caspar, gamely played by Jon Polito, is one long excursion into monomanical burlesque.  All we need is Tony Sopranos' inclination for malapropisms, or a few words of wisdom from Paulie Walnuts.  What we get instead is something like a battalion of cops knocking over a speakeasy with a little help from a firebomb and an actual tripod-mounted military grade machine gun.  Yes, that actually does happen in this film.  And the mayor and chief of police, more than not, remind me of Commissioner Gordon and Chief O'Hara from the old Batman tv series, except that Commissioner Gordon would have been a bit too earnest for Miller's Crossing.

And nearly everywhere he goes Eddie Dane is compelled to remark on all the people ""cracking wise"" like regular smart alecks.  It's another thing I like about the guy.  I mean, let's face it, a guy like Sammy Gravano didn't become the underboss of one of the most powerful families in America by lighting up a room with his gallows wit.  Mostly he did it by making lots of money for the people above him.  From time to time he probably also did things to suggest to people that he didn't like being used for a doormat.  And, sure, Eddie Dane gets down and dirty, and utterly brutal, but that's what he's supposed to do.  That's who he is.  It's who he SHOULD be.  That's why I respect him as a character.

Tom Reagan, by comparison, just kind of wanders through the film, and he says and does a few things to manipulate people, and in the end I'm still wondering just why did he go to all the trouble?

Well, this is a movie that begins with a character who spends a couple of minutes telling us what happened to upset the status quo among people.  That's usually a bad sign.  Because as nearly every beginning writer will tell you one of the cardinal rules of fiction is to show, don't tell.  If somebody gets robbed, let the reader, or the audience, see that person getting robbed.  Don't start out with the victim filling out a police report.

Okay, it's a pretty decent movie.  I just didn't like it all that much.",1320796800,,3550,4.417565485362095

384606,5,6301963717,"Ok, it has been 21 years since I first screened Miller's Crossing, and one of the ways that I judge films(or music or literature, for that matter) is how they stand up to the test of time. It's as good today as it was 21 years ago: it is a flawless gem of a film. When I first saw it, it was obvious that they had borrowed, or alluded to, a great deal of the plot framework of Dashiell Hammett's great novel the Glass Key. At first, this sort of bugged me. But then, after looking at the differences between the two stories, it gradually became apparent to me that they had identified certain weaknesses (at least in terms of cinematic representation of the work) and set about to refashion the lump of clay to eliminate them. The end result still gets into the insider's sophisticated amoral view of politics and organized crime during Prohibition--which was the great strength of The Glass Key--while telling a more complex and believable storyline between the characters. This is a sophisticated proposition. In both the film and the book, the man who stands behind the great chair(Mr Inside-Outski) and whispers in the ear of the Great Man is a gambler having a string of bad luck, who usually knows how to play all the angles. There is a woman whom the gambler thinks is dangerous for the Great Man--and the Great Man will not listen. There is a rival with psycho overtones--who orders the beating of said gambler. There is a falling out between the gambler and the Political Boss, and a great trap that is laid by the gambler without the Bosses knowledge or comprehension, to deal with all these complications once and for all. Beyond those comparisons, Miller's Crossing serves up some scenes that are so memorable, so poetic, that they are simply breathtaking. A small boy stands staring at a corpse in an alley. After a long pause, he grabs the toupee off the corpse and runs away. Later, the Political Boss says: ""They took his hair, Tommy.  Jesus that's strange. Why would they do that?"" Then, there is the Political Boss, teeth clamped to a cigar, standing in his slippers in the dark, firing a steady stream of light from a Tommy Gun at a fleeing car to the strains of Danny Boy playing on an old Victrola. There is a young John Turturro, being led through the woods to his own execution, begging and pleading for his life. ""Look in your heart, Tommy! Look in your heart!. We're not like those animals back there! We don't bump guys!""

It's a film that tells a story in a very cinematic way, driving the viewer forward relentlessly, and the complexities build towards a surprising and inexorable conclusion.

This is probably one of those films that benefits from multiple viewings, but who has time for that? I still have no idea exactly what the role of John Turturro was supposed to be. In one of the extras, someone says they thought this was a comedy when they first read it, and I can see why. Both the rival crime bosses are almost cartoonish in their anger. The look of certain scenes veers towards the exaggerated look of a cartoon at times, too. In fairness, I did get through this in one sitting, which is rare. I wouldn't call it the best gangster flick ever made, as some say. It is far from that. It is very hard to understand.

384631,5,6301963717,"A strange little film. Once again the Coen Brothers want to make an anti-genre film. This time they attack the genre of the gangster mafia in an eastern city that does not need a name but has to be big during prohibition. That mafia is working in clubs with bars and gambling tables, and in racketeering for protection. Two rival gangs and one chap taken in between Irish and Italian bosses or would-like-to-be-sole bosses. He has an affair with the girl friend of the Irish man and he shifts to the other side but then he is demanded to execute the brother of the woman, which he fakes and then this brother turns against him and he finally manages, after many sessions of punching and upper cutting that leave him every time healthy and strong, to trick and trap the brother who belongs to the Irish gang and the Italian boss into confronting each other at his own place and the brother kills the Italian boss and our man kills the brother and disguises the two deaths in a mutual gun fight and killing. He is back with his first boss the surviving Irish man who is going to marry the woman of before and forgives our man. But this one refuses that forgiveness that he has not asked and walks away. We will note a slight touch of Jewishness on that Irish man for the funeral of the brother. The cops in that prohibition situation are providing the street entertainment and the cleaning sessions in some clubs that are so wide open that a whole brigade of cops could run in without breaking the slightest piece of glass. But the best part remains the machine gun fights between the Irish boss and the hit men sent to assassinate him by the competitor. The chandelier turns into a ""windmill"" that is in fact a ""bullet mill"" and it is funny though it lasts only a second. Overkill is the motto and so many bullets and noise for just nothing is like using the space shuttle to go buy your daily bread at the next block bakery.

Nope.  Even with the stellar acting power of Gabriel Byrne and Albert Finney, this souffle falls flat.  There is no -- as in NO -- plot to follow.

384678,5,6301963717,"Often hailed as the Coen brothers finest film; `Millers Crossing' is a brilliant gangster film that exceeds the film the Academy decided to embrace this given year (yes, I'm talking to you `GoodFellas').  `Millers Crossing' is quiet when it needs to be, shocking when necessary, and always effortlessly chilling.

The film tells the story of Irish gangster Tom Reagan, lieutenant to crime boss Liam O'Bannon.  O'Bannon's power is challenged by rival crime boss Johnny Caspar, and soon things start to shift within the O'Bannon clan.  When it is revealed that Reagan is having an affair with O'Bannon's lover Verna his is cast out of the family and soon finds himself negotiating with Caspar.  Tom has some outstanding gambling debts that threaten his life, and Verna's brother Bernie has been making trouble for Caspar, so they make a deal.

If Tom helps Caspar with his problem, Caspar will help Tom with his.

The film is a solid gangster film that embellishes all the great things about this particular genre.  It is violent, extremely at times, but it is also very sullen.  The film possesses this unsettling calm, this effortless ease that permeates each scene and gives off this purified feeling of dread.  This is especially noticeable in the forest scenes that just reek of fantastic, caressing the audience with its faux sense of serenity.

We can all get down on our knees and praise cinematographer Barry Sonnenfeld for this.

The same calm accomplished by the direction is also evident in the marvelous acting on all fronts.  The film is carried on the shoulders of Gabriel Byrne, who marvelously captures the repressed hostility within Tom's actions.  As great as Byrne is, the supporting cast is so much better.  Miss Harden is flawless, delivering a distilled sensuality that just envelopes her character and everyone around her.  Jon Polito is effectively repulsive as Caspar, and J.E. Freeman is chillingly horrific as Eddie Dane, Reagan's biggest opponent.  Albert Finney is marvelous as Liam O'Bannon, capturing the paternal instincts as well as the killer ones.  He reminds me somewhat of Tony Soprano, likable yet deadly, but in a vastly different way.

The films biggest stand out would have to be John Turturro though, such a brilliantly layered performance.  He goes from sadistic to emotionally crippled with effortless ease, and his whole breakdown in the woods, where he begs for his life, is the film single greatest moment.  What makes that moment so fantastic is the mirrored moment that comes towards the end, where Bernie tries his hand at the same plea...

""Look into your heart.""

...but you can tell, as he can, that this time it won't work.  You can see on his face that he knows that you know that everyone else knows that we can see right through this faade.

""What heart?""

`Millers Crossing' is a marvelously crafted epic that will leave your blood chilled and your heart cold, and that is beautiful when considering the genre.  There are countless efforts made in this regard, to create a gangster film that get everything right, but rarely does it happen with such effortless grace.  The Coen's have a huge following, and they have won awards for films such as `Fargo' and the recent `No Country for Old Men'; but to me, `Millers Crossing' is probably their finest hour.  It saddens me that this film was entirely ignored by Oscar.",1224028800,4,3373,4.930851063829787

She was fantastic in Fargo. Fargo was a great movie with all the right moves, excellent tone, bizarre characters, and a flatly affected but very strong pregnant cop played by McDermott. The Coen brothers are known for their slightly off-kilter films. Raising Arizona with Nicholas Cage and Holly Hunter was a very successful and entertaining quirky movie. Strange characters and bizarre situations can be very entertaining. The formula just doesn't work in Miller's Crossing.

Garbrial Byrne stars as a dirtball gangster. He's the slimey no. 2 to Albert Finney in Finney's massive gangster world. Finney is the real power in this mystery city and Byrne's authority and power comes from only the fact that he has Finney's confidence. Finney is the star of the movie for me. In this unnamed city, the mayor and the police chief are in his pocket until his rival ""goes to war"" with his gang and starts to get the upper hand.  Byrne is having a ""liaison"" with Albert Finney's galpal played ably by Marcia Gay Harden. Byrne is Finney's second in command, so his choice of girlfriend is highly questionable. Over the course of the convoluted plot and where dirtbags of all stripes show up and do their thing, Byrne is forced to kill a man to show his new pals that he is not a mole or traitor. Well, Byrne has a little itty bitty heart and lets the pathetic victim go so long as he disappears from town. The intended victim is his girlfriend's brother so it makes sense not to whack him.

Byrne makes his way between the two warring gangs all the while trying to get some money to pay off his gambling debts. It's all really quite silly and meaningless. There are lots of false deep moments with characters pretending to have souls and more than one layer to their shallow characters but they can't quite pull it off. This is a movie populated with characters who are all essentially the same, completely corrupt-- with little or no ethics or care for anybody else but themselves.

The main problem with quirky films is that they so often end badly. What I mean is that the filmmakers don't quite know how to conclude the story or they purposefully leave the ending obscure just so they can retain their ""quirky"" reputations.

Why is it seen as something of a failure in modern hollywood films to properly conclude a story? At one time, this was considered the mark of a well-constructed story--  one that has a beginning, middle, and end. Some ""artists"" apparently find the concept unfulfilling and perhaps even a bit constricting-- well, I want a proper ending to my stories! Why should the audience have to make up their own endings? It's just lazy story-telling disquised as avant-garde ""art"".

The ending in this movie was completely frustrating. Nothing was wrapped up for the main characters (except those that got whacked) and what seems like a perfectly reasonable option presented to Byrne at the closing is rejected by him for no apparent reason. Finney's character doesn't quite understand the ending and neither do I. But Byrne is apparently motivated by other character traits that unfortunately nobody in the audience knows anything about.

Folks in this movie don't learn alot, and don't change alot. It's just another ""slice of life"" in this particular weird, bizarro Coen brothers world.

The film is beautiful to watch with lush dark colors everywhere. Everybody is wan and pale and even the scenery is washed out. The direction is excellent and the pacing fine. The performances are all adequate or better, but it's just not enough. The dialogue is stilted and terse. Albert Finney owns this movie and so does Marcia Gay Harden.

Essentially, this approach to filmmaking and story telling is a treat for the filmmakers but a frustration for the audience. At the end of the movie I want to know what happens next, I want the storyline concluded, and I don't want to waste my time guessing and speculating about what happens to the characters after the credits because I really just don't care enough about the film or the shallow one or two dimensional characters to waste my time on the exercise.",1208563200,8,4578,5.074468085106383

I've seen piece of Miller's Crossing many, many times over the years, but somehow I'd never gotten round to sitting down and watching the whole movie until recently. I think this has to do with my ambivalence towards the Coens, who are capable of cranking out an amazing film one day and an awful one the next; I'm never quite sure what I'm going to get. I'm quite happy that both my last two Coen experiences (this and No Country for Old Men) have been more than satisfactory.

Gabriel Byrne plays Tom Reagan, a triggerman for crime boss Leo O'Bannon (Albert Finney). As the movie opens, Johnny Caspar (Jon Polito) is asking O'Bannon for license to kill Bernie Bernbaum (John Turturro). O'Bannon refuses; Bernie is the brother of Verna (Marcia Gay Harden), Leo's girlfriend. Caspar and his loyalists go rogue, setting up their own shop; when it's revealed that Reagan has been having an affair with Verna, O'Bannon ejects him from the gang, and he, too, goes over to Caspar's outfit, which is now struggling with O'Bannon's for control of the city. Between gobs of flying bullets, Caspar's right-hand man Eddie Dane (J. E. Freeman) is embroiled in the mystery of where Reagan's loyalties truly lie; is he loyal to Caspar? An agent for O'Bannon? Or, most dangerously, is he loyal only to himself?

Loosely based on two Dashiell Hammett novels (The Glass Key and Red Harvest), Miller's Crossing is a fast-moving, violent look at the golden age of the gangster that manages to be a lot more at the same time. Barry Sonnenfeld's cinematography, on the penultimate film before he moved to directing, is a joy to watch. (Please, Barry, go back to cinematography. It's something you're good at.) The script is sharp, by turns funny and heart-wrenching, and the actors are uniformly excellent. This is good filmmaking, pure and simple. ****",1205107200,,1870,4.8742138364779874

This film isn't those for those looking for a violent shoot em up gangster movie (though it does have its moments, including a memorable tommy gun scene with the great Albert Finney), you will actually have to pay attention to the conversations and every action to get it.

384757,4,6301963717,"""Miller's Crossing"" Is best described as that ""stylish Coen Bros. Gangster Movie"".  Instead of the southwestern types populating ""Raising Arizona"" and ""Blood Simple"", we have the ""Dapper Dans"" and fast-talking molls of some nameless Prohibition-era metropolis.  Seething with an endless array of illicit dealing (speakeasies, bookmaking, fight-fixing), the city is barely held together by boss Lee O'Bannon (Albert Finney).  Even the Police Chief and the Mayor pay unquestioned deference to O'Bannon who, when times get desperate, proves he's still an artist with a Tommygun.  Nobody gets big without O'Bannon's permission, but the crime boss has a weakness - Verna Birnbaum (Marcia Gay Harden).

Lee's obsession with Verna proves fatal because he feels obligated to protect her no-good brother Bernie, an utter creep marked for death by lower crime boss Johnny Caspar.  Gabriel Byrne is Tommy Regan, Lee's right-hand man and also his conscience.  Regan cautions his boss to dump Verna - he knows that both she and her brother aren't worth going to war over.  But he's also fallen for Verna.  When O'Bannon ignores Tom, he sparks a mob war that soon threatens his primacy and catapults Caspar to the ultimate power.  Tom must navigate an uncertain path as Caspar's new confidante, one that brings him to blows with Caspar's right-hand man, and will see him realize his true feelings for Verna.

This was a great movie, with an uncommon sense of sound and visual artistry.  Putting aside the plot, full of characters with shifting motives, the Coens display their great ear for unforgettable dialog and expression.  Their never-named city manages to be more cartoonishly realized than those that appeared in the many Batman-clones that appeared in the early 1990's when ""Crossing"" was released.  The Coen's rely on their gift for visual irony - their city is populated with Cops who strut proudly even though conscious that they are tools of the bosses.  (In my favorite scene, Tom takes a chair to an oversized enforcer sent to rough him up; his ""victim's"" expression - like a child on the verge of tears - is priceless.)

At its heart, ""Crossing"" is an impossible mix of contradictions - with action both fast and slow, rough and smooth, heavy and light, best shown in a scene where Finney single-handedly turns the tables on would-be assassins, and the rat-a-tat of his submachine gun shares our attentions with the poignant sounds of ""O Danny Boy"".  Not quite the collection of sight-gags familiar in stock Coen fare like ""Intolerable Cruelty"" or ""O' Brother"", the film is best compared to a dream that Gabriel Byrne's character describes to Verna, of chasing his hat through the wind.  Byrne calls the sight of a grown man chasing something pathetic, but Verna thinks that hat an image that will change into something beautiful.  Even if you don't buy the story, the film's mix of imagery will prove unforgettable.",1192147200,4,2918,5.066945606694561
384788,4,6301963717,"This is one of my favorite movies, not least because of the haunting score that plays during the opening credits and recurs throughout.  I'm surprised no one else has mentioned this.

The movie was filmed in New Orleans--I was there during its filming, and streets were constantly being blocked off--but I'd say it's intended to be New York or Boston.  Note the Irish tenor of the gangs and the police chief.

This is better than any other gangster movie: it distils the essence of the genre. It fuels Tarantino and The Usual Suspects, mixed with wry twists and rye. Although I haven't read The Glass Key, I've read all Chandler; and the Byrne man is pure Chandler, on the other side of the tracks. He takes a lot of punishment, he feels like a sawn-off leg, he cools it with bootleg, he has a way with a semi-soiled maid, and a weakness for the ponies. Runyonesque. He's not sure where he's going, but he can figure. He's never cross, but he's crossing over. Like the private eye,  he's not mean, and he's melancholy, but he's not soft-boiled.

Either seems equally possible to me, as he engages in every double-cross known to man, for reasons which are never made entirely clear.  Along the way, he is beaten up seemingly by nearly every inhabitant of the unnamed city's criminal underworld, but seems to accept his lot with resignation.

This movie had so many twists and turns that it required two consecutive viewings to insure that I had it right.  One could watch it a million times and still never know exactly what Tom Reagan's motives are.  The Coens certainly have no problem leaving the ultimate outcome somewhat unresolved, which always entertains me.  Neat, tidy endings are rarely a reflection of real life.

One will find great performances throughout, particularly those of Albert Finney & Gabriel Byrne.  The typically twisted Coen humor is on abundant display in the snappy dialogue, sometimes so snappy that the viewer can hardly follow along (Steve Buscemi speaks at such a blistering pace that I had put on the subtitles to make sense of it all).

As other reviewers have said, you either love the Coens or hate them.  The surreal, ambivalent qualities which delight some will drives other crazy.  I have found both to be true...by the time ""Barton Fink"" was over, I had no idea what I was even watching anymore, and wondered what the ballyhoo was all about.  However, ""Miller's Crossing"" is a good example of all the best Coenesque qualities falling nicely into place, resulting in a movie which is hugely entertaining without being nearly as frustrating as some others.",1173312000,3,1647,4.863799283154122
384795,4,6301963717,"Miller's Crossing is the Coen Brother's foray into the gangster genre.  Most people either love the Coen Brother's movies or hate them.  I fall somewhere in between, however, their movies are always interesting and Miller's Crossing is no exception.

The film takes place in a prohibition era, large, American city.  The protagonist, Tom Reagen, played by Gabriel Byrne, is the trusted right-hand man of Leo O'Bannon (Albert Finney), the leader of the dominant Irish gang.  Leo is under pressure from the up and coming Italian gang led by Johnny Caspar (Jon Polito).  A conflict between the two leaders emerges over the small time hood, Bernie Bernbaum (John Turturro).  Apparently Bernie is leaking word of Caspar's fixed races to too many people.  Caspar is seeing the odds of his sure bets drop too much.  It's cutting heavily into his cash flow.  And besides, it's just not ehtical.  Leo, partly because Bernie is his girlfriend Verna's (Marsha Gay Hardin) kid brother, is protecting Leo and refuses to let Caspar move against him.  The police and mayor take orders from whoever the top dog is, and the funniest moments of the movie are watching them shift around in trying to end up on the right side of the ensuing war.  Tom has to act on his own to bring his boss Leo and Verna, with whom he's having an affair, safely through the war.

It's a complicated plot, but the plot isn't the strongest aspect of the film.  What I found most remarkable about the film was it's attention to detail.  As a period peice, Miller's Crossing is phenomenal.  The costumes, the settings, the cars all perfectly fit 1920's urban America.  And the dialouge, what a wealth of character 1920's, American slang brings to the movie.  The acting by the whole cast was particularly well done.  And the cinematography captured it all perfectly.  Especially the lonely road through the woods at what was called Miller's Crossing.  This movie is truly a feast for the eyes, and the dialouge and soundtack make it a feast for the ears as well.  The plot is a little too complex and Tom Reagen rolls from beating to beating like an indestructable Superman, but as a period piece, this movie excels.

Add in a little trademark Coen dark humor and a little Coen fixation with hats, and this movie is well worth a couple of hours of a quiet evening at home.",1170892800,4,2332,4.715346534653466

I'll save you some time: If you want a traditional shoot 'em up crime pic, all action and no brains,

keep walking. This ain't your picture.

I mean, this is a great gangster movie, make no mistake about it. It's got all the necessary ingredients: lots of violence (explosions, machine guns, arson), exuberantly shot; multiple, incestuous betrayals (professional, romantic, sexual); even a little love . . . . But none to spare. Nobody will ever accuse this movie of sentimentality.

Miller's Crossing is definitely more aimed at the head than the heart. That said, the film has some real emotional depth, with bonds of all sorts--professional, familial, romantic--straining, twisting, crossing, breaking, doublecrossing. There's a lot more feeling here than is obvious at first glance.

But the Coens are, as is their wont, riffing on a genre. They write characters like Johnny Casper (Jon Polito), a choleric little fireplug who muses about the nature of right and wrong (""an interesting ethical question . . . "") as he's sending his lieutenants out to murder his enemies or, when things get out of hand, doing the job himself.

Also, Joel and Ethan are so in love with the gorgeous lingo of the hard-boiled period gangster pic that they make it a featured player. If you share their love of language in general, and American slang in particular, Miller's Crossing will thrill you with its virtuosic wordplay.

Here's a question: How many times does world-weary Tom (Gabriel Byrne), the still water at the center of Miller's Crossing, get beat up? And how many times does he lose his hat?",1169942400,3,1881,4.9523809523809526

The person hired to follow Verna was found dead, and now Leo wants to get even. [No Maltese Falcon here.] Tommy says starting a war will only cause more trouble than its worth. [Does Tommy's bad bets symbolize a loser?]

Tommy is brought to see Casper and offered a deal. He refuses, and earns more bad luck. [No Glass Key is broken.] Trouble seems to be developing in town.

This kind of confusion and awkward narrative is unfortunately somewhat typical to early Coen brothers movies: Blood Simple is a little mystifying in its timeline of the husband's death, and even Fargo is a little confusing when it comes to figuring out who knows who in the crime world, but despite that, this early chunk of movies, including this one, are some of the Coen brothers' best stuff.

This film, if there is any justice in the world, should be a cornerstone work in the modern gangster genre.  Aside from capturing the grittiness of Prohibition-era life, as opposed to the overly clean _Chicago_-esque images, this is an intellectual and emotional gangster film.  Aside from presenting a great cast (Gabriel Byrne, Albert Finney, John Turturro, Steve Buscemi, John Polito), this movie explores the importance of love and loyalty in the darkness and violence of a crime underworld.

Don't get me wrong--this film is not sappy, nor is it appropriate for Lifetime airtime.  Love among gangsters is of course stressful and antagonistic, but above all of the violence in this film is the strategic-minded advisor played by Gabriel Byrne, who digs through the complex relationships of gangland to sort out deep-rooted problems for his boss.  Byrne's character distinguishes this movie so much from other gangster movies in that he is an intellectual gangster rather than a violent one.  He barely ever has a gun, and while his strategies do not always run smoothly, the movie centers around his methods of playing people against each other to eventually gets what he wants.

Freeman as ""The Dane""; awesome cinematography and a perfect score (featuring murder and mayhem to ""Danny Boy"" and Italian opera); and a couple highly memorable scenes, one featuring Finney and the other Turturro. There's a good bit of violence, but very little done to a gruesome extent, and the language harks back to a ""wholesome"" time before the F word had been popularized (""rumpus"" gets a lot of play). At a minimum, Miller's Crossing is a good evening's rental for an adult audience. You may even end up putting it on your list of all-time favorites.",1162252800,,994,4.993975903614458
384837,4,6301963717,"Because the Coen brothers style was relatively unknown when ""Miller's Crossing"" was released back in 1990, most critics and viewers took it to be just another run of the mill gangster thriller; notable only for the complexity of its story elements. The Dashiell Hammett type story is told from the point of view of Tom (Gabriel Byrne), an adviser to a prohibition era Irish crime boss named Leo (Albert Finney).

Although it appears to be a serious (and violent) gangster film with a straightforward story, it is actually a huge inside joke with the Coens showing both reverence and irreverence for their genre. Or more correctly ""genres"", as there is mixing of 1920-30's gangster movie elements with the film noir style of the 1940-50's. ""Miller's Crossing"" has a very fabricated production design with the stylized dialogue to match; giving it an unreal feel, a bit like the ""Serenity"" movie which mixed space and cowboys.

Albert Finney and Jon Polito (as Johnny Caspar) are especially good as rival crime bosses. The film can only be truly appreciated by those well acquainted with the film traditions of its two genres, but it still works on a basic gangster picture level.

The obvious comparison is ""Reservoir Dogs"", if only because the Coens and Tarantino are serious students of cinema history and film theory who carefully wove this stuff into their respective films. Yet there is considerable originally within these otherwise derivative works, both self-conscious reverential tributes and biting parodies of film conventions.

Both films fit the writer/director classification, where the director is responsible for translating his own vision to the screen. The Coen vision is translated into an expressionistic world, which is superficially convincing as being real. The pseudo realism is self-sustaining because the characters behave as if they believe in it. The repeated inquiry ""what's the rumpus"" works within the film's reality but would be a strange question to hear today on a sixth grade playground.

As the film progresses and these phrases of stylized gangster talk are repeated in service to the plot, the viewer assimilates them and the world of the film becomes increasingly familiar, becoming a world they know.

""Miller's Crossing"" has a more complex story than ""Reservoir Dogs"" and more of a comic book quality. Its main exaggeration is the transitional device of having the hero get unrealistically beaten up between virtually every scene change. The sequences with the corrupt mayor and police are also comic book surreal.

At the time of release critics and audiences were not familiar with what would become the Coen's comedy trademark, the disconnection between the way their characters should talk and behave (per film convention) and the way the Coen's actually script them. This was less apparent in ""Miller's Crossing"" than in their later films, coming mainly in the discourses by Leo and Casper on ethics and codes of loyalty, and in the caricature of Casper's fat spoiled son.

The story is circumscribed and without overt interest in seeking to move you very deeply but it is neither distant nor dry or cold, either. On first viewing, it strongly led me to view it a second time to catch the threads and dialogue I knew were there but missed on the first run through.

The insightful Byrne is attempting to broker an uneasy peace between his boss Leo and powerful up and coming Italian mobster Johnny Caspar played flawlessly by bald character actor Jon Polito.

Polito it seems has been having his gambling profits minimized by the efforts of erratic grifter Bernie Bernbaum played by John Turturro.  He comes to Finney for his blessing on the execution of the pain in the neck Turturro.  Turturro is however under Finney's protection and Finney's refusal to sanction the hit sets off a violent turf war with the scheming Byrne in the middle.

Byrne must negotiate his way through this minefield while having an affair with Leo's mistress Verna played by Marcia Gay Harden, who also happens to be Turturro's sister.  Byrne manages to play both sides against each other while frequently getting pummeled throughout the film.  It seems as if he's an inveterate gambler and in addition to taking his lumps from each warring faction, he also gets beaten for welching on gambling debts.

The Coen's with brilliant set design and wardrobing create a very authentic looking film populated with accomplished actors doing very effective jobs with their roles.

384895,5,6301963717,"Not only is Miller's Crossing one of the Cohen brothers' very best (in a list of countless phenomenal) productions, it is one of the greatest crime/neo-noir films ever made, and possibly even one of the greatest films of the last 40 years.

The story of turmoil and curruption in the world of prohibition era crime is told with such subtlety and careful detail that one is pulled through a complex series of twists and turns in such a way that it all feel perfectly natural.

Gabriel Byrne's alcoholic gambler with a heart of gold (*wink*) is in the vein of Bogart's finest roles. Albert Finney's blinded by love political boss who ""dosn't like to think"" is the ultimate irish gangster. John Turturro's sniveling bookie is one of his two best performances (see Unstrung Heroes). Marcia Gay Harden is a unique femme fatale. Jon Polito's moronic Italian thug is as funny as it is brilliant. All of these characters give the film a sense of humanity and realism in what is essentially a mob opera.

In addittion to the acting, the films production values create a real connection between the viewer and the world of the film. The contrasts in the film's lighting and production design are not only period perfect (with only the slightest hint of the Cohen Brothers' ""more noir than noir"" style) but a flawless example of why the film noir style is vital: duality. Everyone wants to be the good guy at some point just like everyone wants to be the bad guy at some point, and no matter what we want we're always a bit of both. Film noir is all about holding a mirror up to the face of humanity. Tragedy, love, deceit, honor, violence, and hollow and imperfect redemtion are all components of a good noir epic and this Cohen brothers' masterpeice has them all in spades.

An effective work, without major artifices, it shows us the criminal world in all his brilliance. The  performances of Albert Finney, Gabriel Byrne, Marcia Gay Harden and John Turturo are simply brilliant.

384897,4,6301963717,"It difficult today to recall that, when this movie came out in 1990, a lot of critics panned it, calling the characters cartoon caricatures and the story stilted and unwieldy.

Now, 15 years later and in a time when its players -- Gabriel Byrne, Marcia Gay Harden, John Turturro and Jon Polito -- have all made big names for themselves, we can look back on this as one of the Coen brothers most inspired and entertaining films. It is the equal, in my opinion, of ""Fargo"" and ""Barton Fink"" and way ahead of their drowsy comedies of recent years starring big budget players like George Clooney and Katherine Zeta Jones.

If you've never seen it, ""Miller's Crossing"" is a crossroads in the country near the unnamed city where Italian and Irish gangsters are duking it out for control. Gabriel Byrne's character is the linchpin between the warring groups, first as the top associate to Irish mob chief Albert Finney and, later, as part of Jon Polito's Italian mob after he seemingly switches allegiance.

But does he switch? You'll really be entertained trying to figure that out! You'll also be entertained by a number of miraculous scenes -- the best of which is Finney fighting off killers in his bedroom and putting some more out of action with one of the best machine gun scenes in film history to the tunes of ""Danny Boy"". You'll also get a great kick out of a shootout at a speakeasy and a scene with fighter ""Drop"" Johnson -- one of the greatest names a Hollywood character has ever had.

All this and America's best character actor, John Turturro, too!

I'm getting carried away with enthusiasm but I can't help it when I think of this worderful, offbeat yet terribly mainstream and entertaining mob movie. There's never been one like it and probably never will be one like it. Buy it, rent it or borrow it tongiht and see how much fun you can have for a couple hours with his group of madcap gangsters.",1129766400,3,1908,4.6

384901,3,6301963717,"There's one overriding element of Miller's Crossing which is readily apparent from the outset--snappy stylish dialogue that forces one to listen intently lest something is missed.  Quite the gimmick to hold one's attention.  If you're expecting to remain a mentally passive participant, fuhgedaboutit! There's one problem--the labyrinthine plot takes so many left turns and backsteps with a cast of equally unsavory characters that one is ultimately befuddled by it all and simply lets himself be ""taken for a ride"".

The time and place is prohibition era America in some large unnamed multi-ethnic city run by mobsters who have city government inextricably on the take.  From appearances, no one other than racketeers and crooked government officials inhabit this social milieu.  ""Ordinary"" citizens spend their time at the speakeasy run by top dog Leo (Albert Finney).  Oh, there's an anonymous boy and his dog who make an appearance hovering over the bloody backalley corpse of one ""Rug"" Daniels, a hired ""tail"" who's mysteriously ""rubbed out"" and a character who becomes central to the proceedings without ever uttering a single word.  The boy makes off with the dead man's toupee.  ""They took his hair,"" Leo later utters in astonishment, believing for all the world that the missing toupee carries some symbolic significance other than as the random event which it is.  Such is the closed, delusional, and self-involved world of these characters who inhabit it.

Doors to private residences aren't barriers to entry as much as they're ""itches to scratch""; the residents themselves don't even bother to ask who's knocking before opening them, if people bother to knock at all.  Everyone seems to know everyone else's business; some private conversations almost instantaneously become public knowledge.  Ethics, at least as they're defined in this milieu, exist to propagate the aforementioned self-involved delusions.  Boss Johnny Caspar (Jon Polito) implores to Leo, ""What kind of a world is it when a businessman can't trust his own fix?""

Seemingly above the fray is our protagonist Tommy Reagan (Gabriel Byrne), Leo's young street-smart confidant who gambles too much, but garners trust and grudging respect from everyone involved because he's ""honorable"" and knows all the angles. Despite his allegiances, people ""like"" him.  He rolls with the punches, literally, with the self-assured belief that it's better to pay one's own debts than to have them ""taken care of"" and that actions should only be taken ""for a reason"".  Tommy's love involvement with Verna (Marcia Gay Harden), the sister of neurotic underhanded bookie Bernie Bernbaum (John Turturro), makes for severe complications because Verna also has her emotional ""claws"" sunk deep into Leo.  But Caspar wants Bernie Bernbaum ""bumped off"" from Leo's protection because Bernie's been broadcasting Caspar's fixes, thus ""corrupting"" the fixed odds. Leo denies this request seemingly out of pure spite for Caspar. Tommy entreats Leo to carefully weigh what can be gained by protecting Bernie with what can be lost by giving Caspar the ""high hat"".  Afterward, Tommy comes clean with Leo about his affair with Verna and gets ""bounced"", literally, from Leo's protection and confidence.  Tommy soon finds himself in the employ of Leo's nemesis Caspar, who earlier made Tommy a one-time-take-it-or-leave-your face-on-the-floor offer to cover his gambling debts if he'd deliver Bernie Bernbaum.  Meanwhile...aw, fuhgedaboutit!  Think I'm spoiling it for you?  Not a chance, that was just in the first hour!

Despite the convoluted machinations, Miller's Crossing shows inimitable cinematic style.  A marvelous scene has Leo in a one-against-all gunfight replete with acrobatic stunts straight out of a b-movie western and a standing tommy gun duel which has him looking like no less than George C. Scott as Patton standing tall with a pistol against a strafing Messerschmitt--all to the pensive strains of Danny Boy on the phonograph.

All the actors play their roles over-the-top and revel in their parodistically noirish dialogue, with perhaps the exception of Byrne as Tommy.  He gets to make up for it by wracking his brain in the midst of this underworld zoo and taking more physical punishment than is humanly possible in a lifetime of movies!  Think I'm exaggerating?  Well, this whole film is one large exaggeration.  In fact, it's closer to a live-action cartoon populated by caricatures than a true-life drama.  In response to the reviewers who've expressed dismay at what constitutes ""honor"" and ""manhood"" in this film; I'd put forth that every character, every motivation, and everything that transpires is ultimately meant to be laughed at and scorned in the manner of any black comedy.  To even begin to compare Miller's Crossing with a film such as The Godfather is ludicrous.

The question remains, should one take the time to view this film?  Absolutely.  Does it ultimately reward multiple viewings with the purpose of garnering lucid insights and further comprehending all that goes on and with whom?  Well, Caspar imparts the following wisdom, and we also see Leo practice it: ""Always remember to put one in the brain.""  The overly assiduous viewer might do likewise to himself. I've forced myself to watch this film five times...trust me, a sixth time won't be in the immediate offing.",1125878400,6,5363,5.290436835891382

384952,3,6301963717,"Yes, I only gave this wonderful film three stars. Wait! Before you go down there and click on the ""No"" portion of the ""Was this review helpful"" section, let me explain why I rated it this way ...

Let me tell you about the positive sides of watching this movie. First, it's a Coen brothers film. Second, behind the camera, also, was Barry Sonnenfeld, the excellent cinematographer of almost all of the Coen brothers' movies. His wide angle shots and muted colors and shadowing are pure eye-candy. Third, an excellent ensemble cast graces the screen (Gabriel Byrne, Albert Finney, John Turturro, Marcia Gay Harden, etc.).

So you might be asking, ""What's not to like!""

Well, the negative aspect -- and there really is only one, but it's a BIG one -- is that the film has no point, no plot, no secure message. So when I finished viewing the film, I just continued to stare at the screen thinking, 'Okay. That was pretty to watch. But WHY did I watch it?'

Some might argue that it's a crime-noir film designed to show the metal of a man, and how his own personal code during the prohibition wars between rival ""gangs"" made him stand out above the rest. But, at the end of the film, he kills an unarmed man (I won't tell you who it is, though). Where did his personal code go then?

Still, this is a beautifully filmed movie. And Gabriel Byrne, although not having much of a message to get across to us, is excellent, as is Albert Finney.",1125187200,5,1436,4.465648854961832
384953,5,6301963717,"To me, this film is an uncredited remake of Dashiell Hammett's ""the Glass Key"", and unlike the drippy version with Alan Ladd and Veronica Lake, this version deserves to be ranked right up there with 'the Maltese Falcon' and 'the Thin Man', completing the movie versions of Hammett's best novels. IF you love Hammett or these other films, this becomes a 'must own'.

I've read a number of profession reviews, and none of them has ever noted this about the film. But the relationship between the boss and his number two is the same, the rivalries over the girl and with the rival gang are there - down to the 'beating' scene in the warehouse and the shifting allegiances of the police chief and mayor.  The girlfriend in the novel is a senator's daughter, but the movie's development of the Verna and Bernie characters are in keeping with the flow of the novel's story line. And if this isn't a remake of the Glass Key, then what's the thing with the hat ?

Again, this is a brilliant film. I've read many of the other reviews here, and I agree with the praise they heap on this film. I'd only add that this is the role of a lifetime for Marcia Gay Harden; no other role has ever demanded so much from her, or given her such a chance to shine.

384956,4,6301963717,"After the phenomenal critical success of the Coen brothers creation ""Barton Fink"" a lot of their fans were intrigued by the story that the script for ""Barton Fink"" was based on the Coen's experiences making the film ""Miller's Crossing.""  In ""Barton Fink"" a writer is lured to Hollywood to make a wrestling picture (an obvious parallel to the gangster genre).  He decides to write a unique wrestling picture with more intelligence and emotion and style than action sequences in the ring.  As with that scenario, ""Miller's Crossing"" is anything like typical gangster film noir.  It is loaded with memorable, quirky characters and finely tuned dialogue.  The cinematography is ""handsome"" and the acting is first rate.  The cast is exceptional.  Albert Finney, Gabriel Byrne, Marcia Gay Harden, and John Turturro lead the way with excellent performances but the rest of the cast frequently shine as well.  In ""Barton Fink"" the lead character struggles with writer's block, and there is a particular scene in ""Miller's Crossing"" that screams ""Where does the script go from here?""  The final resolution to the dilema is original and highly intelligent.  The biggest problem with ""Miller's Crossing"" is that this style of filmmaking really isn't for everyone.  The Coen brothers are known for their eccentric perspective and for introducing a wide variety of personas into their often bizarre tales.  Other films of note that brought about equal parts praise and bewilderment are ""Raising Arizona"" and ""Fargo.""  For what it's worth, anything original coming out of Hollywood is worth checking out.  ""Miller's Crossing"" is a well-made, cerebral gangster film filled with a carnival of characters and driven by a thoughtfully crafted screenplay.  It is hard to believe that both ""Miller's Crossing"" and Martin Scorsese's ""Goodfellas"" came out in the same year.  Both are gangster films, but both are completely different.  The special features on this DVD include an interesting featurette with Director of Photography Barry Sonnenfeld, and a short list of cast interviews that lasts about five minutes collectively.  If you happen to see ""Barton Fink"" and want to see where that story originated, then ""Miller's Crossing"" has most of the answers.  There is even an apartment building in ""Miller's Crossing"" called ""The Barton Arms.""  ""Miller's Crossing"" is a good film that may be too unorthodox for some viewers, but is nonetheless one of the most unique gangster films ever made.

Right from the opening scene, this 1990 gangster movie from the Coen Brothers will draw you in with its clever dialogue and brilliant sets. I agree this is the best Coen Brothers film. Every detail and conversation is relevant, and the story builds to an intense climax. Not a single misstep and great pacing - just a superb screenplay and production design all around.

I am a fan of Coen Bros. movies in general, especially O' Brother Where Art Thou, but this one left me very disappointed. The plot was extremely predictable and the dialogue was about as cliche as you can get. Very poor character development (the main character started out with an accent, but didn't stick with it?), and very little to keep me interested. I kept waiting for something interesting to happen, but it never did. To compare this movie with great movies like Casablanca, Gone With the Wind, or Godfather is absolutely ridiculous.

384992,5,6301963717,"It's odd that this is my favorite movie, since I've seen several other films from the Coen Brothers, including ""Fargo"" and ""O Brother Where Art Thou"", and I just haven't cared for them.  They tend to make very quirky films, and ""Miller's Crossing"" certainly has some of that (just get a load of Steve Buscemi's character in this movie and you'll see what I mean), but it doesn't seem to descend into silliness the way some elements of other Coen films do.

Another reviewer described ""Miller's Crossing"" as ""the thinking man's mob movie"", and I couldn't sum it up any better than that.  The first thing that will strike you when you see it is the beauty of the film.  The locations, costumes, props, etc. all evoke the prohibition era better than I've ever seen any other film do.  (Visually, ""Road to Perdition"" does this pretty well too, though otherwise it's not nearly in the same class with ""Miller's Crossing"".)  It draws you into the period and makes makes you want to live there.  Also helping this is the use of 1920s or 30s slang.  The dialog in this film is great, and contributes immensely to the illusion that are watching something that actually took place in the early 20th century.

The casting is also absolutely brilliant.  It's one of the few films I can think of where you just can't imagine other actors playing any of the roles.  Gabriel Byrne is perfect as the laconic Tom Regan. Albert Finney exudes charisma as charming, roguish Irish gang boss.  J.E. Freeman is menacing as the Italian boss' right hand man.  Marcia Gay Harden is utterly believable as the tough, rather unscrupulous gangster's moll, and John Turturro plays her scheming brother with just the right combination of charming affability and swinish selfishness and ingratitude.

But the real star of the movie is the plot.  It's just complex enough to require your complete attention in order to stay abreast of all its twists and turns, but it's not so complicated that you can't follow it.  There is action and violence, but what really drives the story are the schemes and machinations of the characters, especially Tom Regan.  Regan appears to be battered by fortune all through the movie, and lloks like he's in over his head.  But when you reach the end of the film, you discover that he has been playing everyone like violins.  You can see several times in the movie when fate throws him a curve, and he is surprised by something that wasn't in his calculations, but each time he recovers beautifully, changes his plans accordingly, and turns the new development to his advantage.  He's a character who would have prospered at the court of the Borgias, but you can also see that his ruthlessness, and his capacity to carry off the coldest, most machiavellian intrigues are not qualities he himself admires, and indeed he obviously doesn't like himself very much.  This coldheartedness, along with his lack of warmth and charm, might make him look pretty rotten, save for one realy admirable quality which I can't really name without spoiling the ending for those who haven't seen the film.  Once you do see it though, you'll know what I mean.

Perhaps it was the fact that this movie is not really fast paced that caused it to fade a bit at the box office, especially as it faced competition from ""Goodfellas"", which is both faster paced and more intense.  But if you want a gangster movie that evokes nostalgia for THE ""gangster era"" in America, sterling performances from truly first rate actors, and a plot that really stimulates your intellect, you owe it to yourself to check this movie out.",1095033600,7,3592,4.747181964573269

384994,5,6301963717,"Despite opening the New York Film Festival in 1990, Miller's Crossing was eclipsed by several other gangster films that year: some superior (GoodFellas) and some inferior (Godfather III, Mobsters), but all containing big-time movie stars that the Coen brothers' film did not have. Coupled with a detached, distanced approach to the characters and a densely textured plot with several implicit and explicit events occurring concurrently, Miller's Crossing became something of a cinematic oddity, a rare gem waiting to be re-discovered at the video store. Now, 20th Century Fox has finally released this underrated film on DVD with a beautiful transfer and a few extras.

 ""Shooting Miller's Crossing: A Conversation with Barry Sonnenfeld,"" is the director's take on how he got into films, how he met the Coen brothers and his experiences working on Miller's Crossing.

 ""Interview Soundbites,"" feature brief comments from Gabriel Byrne, Marcia Gay Harden and John Turturro on working with the Coens and their views on their respective characters. They have the ring of a fluffy electronic press kit and look like they were done shortly after the film was completed.

 There is the standard assortment of trailers for Miller's Crossing, Barton Fink and Raising Arizona.

 Finally, there is a collection of stills from the movie that range from actual scenes to behind-the-scenes pictures.

 Miller's Crossing has aged considerably well over the years. Even though it was marginalized at the time, only it and GoodFellas have endured. It also stands as one of the Coen brothers finest films of their career. This makes it all the more satisfying that 20th Century Fox has taken the time to release such a stunning transfer on DVD. While it would have been nice to have a stronger collection of supplemental material, this is still a movie every dedicated film fan should have in their library.",1091404800,4,1890,5.1875
384995,5,6301963717,"Miller's Crossing is the most skillful and affectionate film ever based on the novels of Dashiell Hammett. The plot is roughly a cross between Hammett novels The Glass Key and Red Harvest, though it's in adapting the latter that the Coen's really hit their peak. Red Harvest was also the inspiration behind such fine films as Kurosawa's Yojimbo, Leone's A Fistful of Dollars and Walter Miller's Last Man Standing, but it's never been done better than here. (One wonders when the novel will be adapted under its own name.) This is perhaps the most violent story ever filmed and yet also the most ingenious: A town is run by two rival gangs and one man, in this case Gabriel Byrne, cleverly makes them destroy one another. The performances are inspired, especially the brilliant John Turturro as a very loose cannon. The scene where Byrne is led to his own death under a canopy of trees is one of the greatest moments ever filmed and is very nicely foreshadowed under the credits.

Everyone praises the crisp, cynical dialog of ""Millers Crossing"" and the complex plot that still holds together.  This is characteristic of a Hammett novel.  While everyone is familiar with Hammett's ""Maltese Falcon,"" ""Miller's Crossing"" is more of a blend of the character's and story line found in his ""The Glass Key"" and the gang war is similar to one in his ""Red Harvest"".

Gabriel Byrne, in his finest performance, plays Tom, adviser and right-hand-man for Leo, played with fabulous machismo by Albert Finney.  Leo, the leading gangster in an anonymous Prohibition-era town, is one of those ""nice guy"" gangsters - a self-professed big-hearted slob who's an ""artist with the Thompson"" -- the ultimate gangster weapon.
We meet Tom and Leo in a fabulous opening scene where Johnny Caspar (the delightful John Polito) talks about ""ettics,"" fixed fights, and the need to kill off a manic John Turturro for selling the information on Caspar's fixed fights.  This scene is a marvelous tribute to ""The Godfather,"" which opens with people requesting favors of the Don.  We also meet Eddie Dane, Caspar's fearsome henchman, who stalks the movie with a perpetual snarl and is the scourge of the gangster world.
This is a movie with a perfect look.  From the thin spiral of smoke from a fired pistol, to the rich details of the city's gin-joints, to the ominous beauty of Miller's Crossing, the movie is steeped in its time period.  One of the best shots is a perversion of a Norman Rockwell painting where a young ragamuffin and his pet dog peer closely at a murdered gangster -- just the kind of ironic twist that fans of the Coens will love.
The plot gets going because Leo refuses to give Caspar the permission to whack John Turturro for selling the fixed fight information.  Caspar, a powerful gangster in his own right, declares war on Leo.  In a magnificent scene, two henchmen try to whack Leo in his house, and while Leo's house goes up in flames Leo blows away the two hitmen as well as a carful of other assassins on the street outside.  In typical Coen fashion, the scene is accompanied by a soaring rendition of ""Danny Boy"" -- wow!
Complicating matters, Tom is sleeping with Leo's girlfriend, Verna (Patricia Gay Harden, who throws the best punch ever thrown by a woman in a gangster film), and Leo finds out. Tom appears to flip sides, going over to Caspar and the Dane and appears to be working on their side.  Still, this movie is about codes of honor, and ulterior motives remain intact.
The dialogue in this movie is wonderful, with gangster/period slang injecting a strong dose of style and wit into the movie. Instead of a mere, ""What's up?"" we hear, ""What's the rumpus?""  Instead of ""Get out,"" we hear, ""Take your flunky and dangle.""  Instead of ""That's insulting,"" we hear, ""I'm sick of the high hat!""  Instead of ""I'm going to rat you out,"" we get, ""If I don't hear from you, I start eating in restaurants.""  And Steve Buscemi steals the show with a rapid-fire speech to Tom.
After a bunch of double-crosses, threats, gunfights, pointed jokes about city corruption, and subtle jokes about the veiled homosexuality underlying virtually all gangster movies, ""Miller's Crossing"" builds to a dark crescendo when all motives are laid bare.  The characters cross the point of no return, and the movie closes with a wonderfully-enigmatic, melancholy Tom staring after his beloved Verna and Leo.
A bit dark and bloody, even by the Coen brothers' standards, this movie will have some squirming in their seats from time to time.  But make no mistake - this is a movie filled with beauty, humor, and the sheer love of filmmaking.  A must-have for any fan of the gangster genre as well as any fan of the Coens' other films.",1083888000,5,3713,4.765990639625585
385001,5,6301963717,"In the world of gangster movies, there are many titles that deserve to be on the list of the greatest ever.  Classics like THE GODFATHER, GOODFELLAS, and ONCE UPON A TIME IN AMERICA are usually mentioned in the same breadth and deservedly so.  One film that also deserves to be on the list, and isn't but should be regardless, is MILLER'S CROSSING, the third feature from the highly talented Coen Brothers released in 1990.  The Coens are mostly known for their later-day masterworks like FARGO and THE BIG LEBOWSKI, not to mention their second film RAISING ARIZONA which starred Nicolas Cage and Holly Hunter.  After seeing MILLER'S CROSSING for the first time, as well as numerous times after that, I have to say that this is their crowning achievement.  It's practically flawless from beginning to end; even most so-called ""perfect"" films have at least one or two small flaws in them.  Everything fires on all cylinders during all two hours of MILLER'S CROSSING, and if there's any flaw whatsoever, I can't find any.
Gabriel Byrne, in probably his best performance, stars as Tom Reagan, the wise right-hand man to Leo (Albert Finney), an Irish crime boss who is engaging in a turf war with his former protege turned rival Johnny Caspar (Jon Polito), the leader of the Italian mob.  In the first scene of the film, Johnny wants Leo to order a hit on a nervous nelly named Bernie (a terrific John Turturro) who he claims has been selling out his fight bets to various others, making him lose money in the process.  Leo refuses to do the favor for Caspar, since Bernie is the brother of his lover Verna (Marcia Gay Harden).  Tom thinks that not killing Bernie is a bad idea, but remains loyal to Leo and his decision.  However, Tom is also having an affair with Verna, and it begins to test his trust with Leo.  Caspar, meanwhile, orders a hit on Leo which fails miserably (in a hilariously bloody sequence with the music of the Irish song ""Danny Boy"" playing in the background), but that is not going to stop Caspar from trying to claim the throne.  When Tom finally confesses to Leo that he is sleeping with Verna, Leo is through with him for good.  This leaves an open door though.  Knowing all the angles from every side, Tom decides to play all of them, remaining loyal to Leo while getting all of his enemies out of the way, and to also pay off his enormous gambling debts.
This is about as far with the plot as I go.  The plot for the movie is very complicated, and you may need a second viewing to figure out what's going on, but this is one of those rare movies that rewards repeated viewings.  The plot itself is so well-written and it shows on screen.  There's a surprise lurking around every corner, but it never detracts from the story like most movies do.  It enhances the experience, which is the right way to go.  And thankfully, the Coens don't sacrifice character development, which helps because we really do care about these characters (yes, even the bad ones).
The performances are all top-notch.  Gabriel Byrne is perfect as Tom, a man who has the brains and chops to be a leader, and isn't as big of a sap as Leo, yet decides to stay in the shadows until called for.  He also lets his flaws be known and doesn't want to be forgiven for them, which is refreshing considering that in this lifestyle, flaws are usually seen as a virtue.  Albert Finney is both tough and vulnerable as Leo. He can be downright sweet with his friends, and be very vicious with a tommy gun if he gets his hands on one.  Marcia Gay Harden is slinky and seductive as Verna - so much so that you can't tell what her motives are and which side she's on.  John Tuturro is awesome as Bernie, who develops him as a nebbish fellow in way over his head at first, but makes him more devious later on in the film and he turns out to be important to the plot than we realized.  Jon Polito is very funny as Caspar; J.E. Freeman is dark and menacing as Caspar's long-time friend and hit man Eddie Dane; and Steve Buscemi has a small cameo as Bernie's friend Mink, who also plays a vital part later on.
The set design and cinematography also warrant a mention.  The camerawork is just stunning in this movie, showing the 1930s atmosphere in all its lurid glory, and evoking the feel of a Dick Tracy comic book at the same time.  The buildings and stage sets also show what is was like at that time period, and makes you really feel like you're there.  Heck, even the dialogue crackles with the zing and style of what they must've said back then (almost everyone in the movie asks at some point, ""What's the rumpus?"").
This is as close to perfect as a movie is ever gonna get, in my opinion.  MILLER'S CROSSING is an absolute triumph in every sense of the word, and my only complaint about it is that it ends too soon like most great movies do.  Highly recommended.",1083888000,9,4849,4.458663646659117
385070,5,6301963717,"While not given much attention upon release, Miller's Crossing has developed a devoted cult following, particularly among fans of the Coen Bros. Ratcheting up the elements that made Blood Simple so popular (grotesque, humorous violence, bizarre but consistent characters, random chance undoing complex plans, incredible plot complexity, etc. etc. etc.), Miller's Crossing nonetheless manages to be far more emotionally powerful than the earlier film. This one bears quite a few repeat viewings, with a plot full of more twists and turns than most of us can follow in one sitting. Like most of the Coens' films, this is tremendously enjoyable, even when you're not quite sure what's happening or why. This is one of my all-time favorites. A perfect script, great cinematogrophy, a top-notch cast, and, of course, flawless production and direction make this one a classic waiting to be discovered. Simply put, one of the best films ever made. Miller's Crossing is a morality play created with infinite style. Complex characters, complex plot, excellent acting, and great editing. Probablly Gabriel Byrne's best work. If you consider yourself a sophisticated moviegoer, this is not one to miss. But a caveat to the mainstream, you can't eat popcorn and watch this movie at the same time; it requires your full attention. And if you thought that the Road to Perdition was a great film you will probably not understand why so many of us love Miller's Crossing.",1081987200,2,1455,5.169491525423729
385071,5,6301963717,"I saw this 1990 film in a theater when it first came out but had generally forgotten it.  Except, that is, for one memorable scene.  That's when John Turturro, taken to Miller's Crossing for the purpose of being murdered by the mob, begs for his life and Gabriel Bryne, cast as the hit man, has to make a decision.  It's all more complicated than that of course.  After all, this is a Coen brothers' film where style is everything, and the characters are complex and edgy.

Set in the probation era, the characters are all larger than life.  There's Albert Finney as a mob boss who's smart in many ways with the exception of the ways of love.  He's fallen for Marcia Gay Harden whose toughness is part of her appeal.  She's trying to protect her sleazy brother, played by John Turturro, and she's also romancing Gabriel Bryne.  The plot thickens as competing mob bosses are at war with each other and the cool Bryne, who always wears a hat, is playing them all against each other.

The plot is complicated and hard to follow.  Good thing for ""rewind"" and ""replay"" on my DVD or it would have just raced past me in a blur.  It's supposed to be a blur though.  The genius of the film is that the plot is just part of the fast paced comic strip snapshot of a time and a place with characters that are so exaggerated that they become symbols rather than real people.

The acting is over-the-top excellent, especially John Turturro.  I'm constantly amazed how he is always the most memorable character in film after film.  I also loved the details of the setting, especially Ms. Harden's wardrobe and hairdo.  There's also an undercurrent of dark humor in the way the characters go about their lives..

I enjoyed the film and stayed up late just to see the interesting extras on the DVD.  It was good to revisit it after all these years. Miller's Crossing filmmaking at its finest and I definitely recommend it.",1080691200,5,1905,4.517543859649122
385072,1,6301963717,"I was expected a great movie because I usually like the Coen brothers but Miller's Crossing was just boring. Too much useless dialogues for not many action scenes.

385073,5,6301963717,"Is there honor among thieves?
So goes the central question of an early film from the Coen brothers. When they made it, the Coen's were still running out of the public eye - their quirky masterpieces, ""Raising Arizona"" and ""Fargo"" had not yet brought them fame. And because of that, ""Miller's Crossing"", a film about mob conflicts between the Irish gangs and the Italians in an unnamed Midwestern city (it is Chicago, isn't it???? Or is it?) did not reap its fame in theaters, but became a cult favorite on VHS. The release of the DVD in May of 2003 raised even more interest in the film.
In the Coen's world of gangsters, you don't just wait for the next killing, you've got to stay on your toes and figure out the next double-cross, and the next, and the next. Betrayal, revenge, and following orders - those are the central themes that result in loss of life in this period piece. The Coen's show early mastery of cinematography, score and sound. The camera angles, the transition between scenes, the focus on the details in the forest, and in every scene that takes place in Tom's apartment...they're all intricate and award-winning.
But, the film is ultimately character driven. The Coen's cast a couple of actors they weren't that familiar with (Gabriel Byrne as Tom Reagan and Albert Finney, so Irish he's green as Leo, the mob boss) and surrounded them with their usual cronies: Jon Polito as a rival of Leo's, Italian Johnny Caspar; John Turturro in fine form as Bernie Bernbaum; bit parts for Steve Buscemi, Michael Jeter, and J.E. Freedman as Caspar's henchman, ""the Dane"". They took a chance on unknown actress Marcia Gay Harden to play the sexy, conniving Verna; and it paid off, as she played brilliantly, foreshadowing her skills and the Oscar she received for ""Pollock"", and her nomination for ""Mystic River"" this year.
Synopsis of the plot:
Tom Reagan (Byrne) is the number one lieutenant of the Irish crime family, and the person the crimelord, Leo (Finney), trusts the most. He's steely-eyed, cynical, and accustomed to Leo tuning in to Tom's will. Throughout the film Tom seems to be getting in deeper and deeper in gambling losses, which he stubbornly refuses to let Leo pay. Less well known is the fact that he's carrying on with sultry Verna, who Leo's fallen in love with. Tom wants to throw Verna's brother, a double crosser named Bernie Bernbaum who ""makes book"" and likes boys more than girls...to the wolves, in the form of minor Italian underboss Johnny Caspar. Leo refuses.
The seeds of dissension are sown, and before the film ends, Tom has been everyone's whipping boy, based on his innate ability for the double cross. The final scenario leaves your head spinning, but in true Coen form, the central question - is there honor among thieves? - has been answered. And like the big, big movies of the 40's and 50's, the Coen's leave the best for the last; you will savor the last big scene.
I thought Gabriel Byrne was wonderful in the lead role.
At the time he shot this, he'd had bit parts in television and movies for over ten years. ""Miller's Crossing"", his first lead, proved his vehicle to move his career up, and helped him cross over into film producing. He has the memorable lines:
""If you want me to keep my mouth shut, it's gonna cost you some dough. I figure a thousand bucks is reasonable, so I want two.""
And to Verna, who's a Jewess:
""If I'd known we were gonna cast our feelings into words, I'd have memorized the Song of Solomon.""
Chemistry between Harden and Byrne is a bit puzzling, but it is definitely living and breathing onscreen.
There isn't a poor performance in ""Miller's Crossing"", but special mention should go to character actor John Turturro, who has the benefit of the role that would normally go to Steve Buscemi, (and Buscemi has little more than a walk on). True to form, Turturro and Buscemi can each play the mealy-mouthed, snide little characters that annoy everyone....really a mark of how brilliant each of them is! Laughingly, Turturro based his painful, whiny character on his observations of director Barry Sonnenfeld's demeanor on the set!
And in a truly Coen-like twist, Albert Finney also shows his versatility by appearing, as a gag, in drag, in the background of the ladies' room, a scene in which Tom confronts Verna about her brother.
There are just not enough accolades to give the quality of this film, and the transfer to DVD is inspiring, although special features are limited to discussions with director and actors. Since they're all such fascinating individuals, this may have proved wisest - it takes nothing away from the film.
Worth a spot in your DVD collection, ""Miller's Crossing"" is not ""The Godfather"" - but almost.",1075939200,,4708,4.756723716381418
385074,5,6301963717,"This is one of the earlier collaborations by the Cohen brothers who co-authored the screenplay, directed by Joel Cohen. I enjoyed it more when I saw it again recently than I did the first time almost 15 years ago because I now have a greater appreciation of Barry Sonnenfeld's brilliant cinematography. The acting is also outstanding, notably Gabriel Byne (Tom Reagan), Albert Finney (Leo), Marcia Gay Harden (Verna), Joe Polito (Johnny Caspar), and John Turturro (Bernie Bernbaum). There are two separate but related plots which are resolved, inevitably, in a violent climax. The first involves relationships between Irish-American and Italian-American gangsters during the 1930s; the other involves Reagan's relationships with his boss, Leo, and Leo's paramour, Verna. The screenplay examines how these and other relationships interact as loyalties are forged and betrayed, ambitions collide, and difficult choices must be made. Bernie Bernbaum is one of the most interesting characters in this film. He is Verna's brother, a silver-tongued bookie, who pays for protection by Leo which proves necessary when he falls deeply into debt to Caspar. The Coens are experts at choreographing almost casual human collisions during the completion of what often resembles a chess game, focusing our attention on a sequence of moves and counter-moves. (That is less true of the Coens' Fargo which has a much tighter plot.) As in The Road to Perdition (2002), this film brilliantly captures its period and locale while examining various types of dysfunctional relationships which have probably existed for thousands of years. Whereas I associate the first and second Godfather films with Tolstoy and Dickens, I associate Miller's Crossing as well as The Road to Perdition with Aeschylus and Sophocles.",1075161600,2,1791,5.446043165467626

I watched the film and fell asleep (admittedly I was tired). The next evening I took another look. What a dissapointment. Quite simply this film didn't do it. Byrne was totally emotionless - took some severe beatings without so much a showing a scratch. Predictable film. Just lacking. Period.

There is nothing about this film I dislike: plot, dialogue, wonderfully composed deep-focus shots, the subtle tri-color scheme which I missed on first viewing (which of course is the point of the film: we see, but do not observe), the characters, the Celtic-tinged score, editing, sound effects,acting, etc. The Coen brother's films are often offbeat to begin with, but this film reveals a depth rarely seen in this most commercial of eras.",1072137600,4,537,5.044943820224719

Hard to believe this was only the Coen Brother's second outing in film, just after the auspicious debut, ""Blood Simple"".
For those who didn't pick up on their work until the success of ""Raising Arizona"", it is very much worth going back & picking up this DVD. It's recreation of the 1920s, and the dissection of gangland rivalries, is exceptional.
Gabriel Byrne, Albert Finney, John Tuturro, Marcia Gay Harden are all exceptional. But there are many more actors in smaller but pivital rolls who will also catch your eye.
And in the annals of cinema, the sequence where Albert Finney's character has a shoot-out with opposing gang hit-men, will be studied for years. Terrific storytelling, with nary a word spoken. It ranks up there with the opening scene of ""Touch of Evil"".

385078,5,6301963717,"Miller's Crossing is still largely a cult classic, tragically. This movie is among the finest crime films of all time. The film is incredibly realistic, from the grittily real period dialogue, set design, and wardrobe to the engrossing tale of depression-era mob maneuvers and double-crosses that keeps twisting and turning until the final conclusion. Everything works, and the film is so utterly compelling that it deserves a more lofty position among the greatest crime films of all time.
The production values are extraordinarily high. The Coens display a nearly obsessive attention to detail to recreate the time and setting of depression-era Chicago. The dialogue is sumptuous and full of colorful language and local aphorisms. Wardrobe, lighting, and sound all come together to form a distinct feel. This is the most period-accurate film I have ever seen.
But all of that would mean nothing without effective storytelling and acting. The story revolves around Tom (Gabriel Byrne), right-hand man of a local, benevolent mob boss, Leo  (Albert Finney). When he disagrees with his boss on whether or not to surrender a bookie (John Turturro), whose sister (Marcia Gay Harden) is romantically involved with both Leo and Tom, to an opposing mob boss (Jon Polito). What erupts is gang warfare, leading to shifting allegiances, deception, and a fascinating examination of duty and ethics. This is a character-driven tale, and it succeeds largely because of its very talented cast. Byrne is perfect as Tom, who comes off as apathetic, even psychopathic at times, but he is actually highly principled if you consider the context of his actions. Albert Finney is also marvelous as Leo, the well-meaning but somewhat incompetent gangster leader. John Turturro is genuinely hateful as a slimy bookie who tries to manipulate Tom's misfortunes to his own advantage, even after Tom saves his life. Jon Polito is great, as always, playing a very contradictory character very averse to getting the ""high hat."" Marcia Gay Harden, though, steals the show in an Oscar-nominated turn as a two-timing grifter. All of these actors are immaculately cast and give excellent performances.
All things considered, this movie is one of the most complete, moving, and spellbinding historical epic and crime film ever made. This is definitely one to see, and hopefully someday this film will be able to take its rightful place among the best films ever made.",1070323200,4,2433,5.206632653061225

Byrne and Finney, as Tommy and Leo, have an acting chemistry that I haven't seen in years. But even the other characters have ties and/or hatreds that are so believeable that they're almost unbelieveable: Caspar and the Dane, the Dane vs. Tommy, Bernie vs. Tommy, etc. In fact, at times, it's the entire world vs. Tommy. (How many times does he get beaten anyway? I lost count.) And, of course, there's Verna who has just about everyone wrapped around her cigarette stained fingers. What a character.

385141,5,6301963717,"Miller's Crossing"" is set during the Prohibition-era of the 1930's. Leo ( Albert Finney)in an Irish gangster that has control over of an Eastern city, with the help of his trusted advisor and lieutenant Tom ( Gabriel Byrne). The rival gang is lead by Caspar ( Jon Polito). He wants a bookie named Bernie Bernbaum (John Turturo) dead, because he feels that Bernie has been cheating him. However, Bernie is the brother of Leo's mistress Verna (Marcia Gay Harden), and Leo refuses to kill him. So Caspar and his ruthless henchman Eddie Dane ( J.E. Freeman)fight for control of the town. Just as the threat erupts, Tom reveals that he wants Verna as well, and him and Leo have a falling out. Tom is suddenly stuck in between the two mobs when Caspar tries to recruit him. Out of loyalty to Leo, Tom tries his best to keep the peace. Unfortunately, he finds himself in the middle of war of constant ambushes and double crosses, where allegiances are constantly shifting, and nothing is ever what it seems.
""Miller's Crossing"" is without a doubt the Coen Brothers' best film, and one of the best gangster films that I have ever seen overall. The Coen Brothers manage to not only create a stunning, and graphic vision of gangsterism, but also a plot with tons of twists and turns as well. Just when you think you have it narrowed down to where Tom's loyalties lie, the story takes you someplace completely different. This makes the film original, because most mob films ONLY focus on power struggle and violence. While this film does have plenty of both, it also has elements of a great con artist film as well. This manages to keep you on the edge of your seat, and caught up in the story. The ending is absolutely outstanding. It is extremely satisfying and provides for an overall enjoyable experience.
However, I am not taking away from the gangster aspect of the film. The costume and set designs, along with the mafia nicknames, dialogue, and overall power struggle, perfectly re-creates the look and feel of the Prohibition-era and the underworld warfare that occured. Next were the performances from the actors. Albert Finney, Gabriel Byrne, Marcia Gay Harden, Jon Polito, and J.E. Freeman were all phenomenal in their roles. Each bring something important to the film, and are all unique in their personalities as well. One of the best all around performances from a cast I have ever seen. The musical score is absolutely beautiful. One of the most powerful and moving scores that I have ever heard. Lastly, Barry Sonnefield once again provides for stunning cinematography!
The Coen Brothers combined gangsterism with a twisting plot, and used a wonderful cast to bring the story to life. The cinematography, musical score, and stunning authenticity are all breathtaking. ""Miller's Crossing"" is a masterpiece that you will want to watch again and again. The good news is now the film is finally out on DVD. Not only do you get to see the film, but also the extras as well. There are interviews shown with all the main actors in the film, as well as a conversation with Barry Sonnefield.

385142,2,6301963717,"This film is cleaver, the slow burn hammett style dialogue must have elicited a few sleepless nights stooped over the type writer (with the obligatory smouldering cigar poking its rear over the rim of an ashtray etc etc.) and the neo noir photography is 'gorgeous', with the 'honour amongst thieves' (and bookies and murderers and double crossers and confidence tricksters...) fallacy dispelled quite nicely.
Typing that dubious (and requisite) kudo required as much grating of my teeth.
The film is, as far as I'm concerned, willfully off-putting, self satisfied, pretentious..... The actors do their best, although they seem to have a real sense of reverence ('this is a smart movie') writ large upon their faces in every scene that requires them to spout forth the mucho stilted dialogue of which this movie is mostly composed. They shuffle through the film, strike poses (stunningly and ambiguously lit, of course) and spout forth the most ridiculous dialogue I've heard in years, as though they're somnambulist automatons plugged into the 'seedy-but-glistening-detective yarn' mainframe (there are a few silly visual tricks courtesy of the director of the ""Men in Black"" I and II, as is evident when Johnny Caspar confronts and executes ""the Dane"" figure). I realise that this is part of the films project, a revisionist potboiler, a left of centre treatise on human nature and the darkness within everyone including our (despondent, scheming but laconically smart) protagonist and what not. I don't care. How very pompous. The tranquil (read: composer on ritalin alert) title theme sets up the stolid, staid tone for the film within the first two or three minutes. The Coens again feel it fit to test out patience with their detached (and mypoic) view of human beings and their intrinsic pitfalls, it is almost as if in their quest not to pander to the audience and create some thoughtful Hollywood product, they forgot to add the most important ingredient (think of it in terms of baking powder in a cake mix); 'an iota of humanity'(understand that in whatever sense you will). I understand that the figures in this film are not meant to represent real people, they are ideal types to be found in pulp novels and films (I am sure there is a a veritable reference book of homages in this). That is not what I mean when I type 'iota of humanity'. I am against the pantomime nature of the references to be found in this and so many other nineties films.
My point is that the Coens are cold technicians, manipulators of quasi-intellectualisms, precocious NYU graduates with a severe carrot up their collective asses. I have not enjoyed a single component of their misbegotten ouvre. I thought (based on the consistent praise this film elicits even from those who don't generally like the Coens' work) that this one would be different. It wasn't. When all's said, neo-noir is a big fat cliche these days anyway. I don't buy any of it (although I enjoyed 'The Grifters a lot more than this tripe).",1064102400,6,2998,4.926877470355731
385143,5,6301963717,"Back in 1990, I was vaguely aware of the Coen Brothers, having seen Raising Arizona several dozen times. I was eager to see their new release, which from the ads seemed like it would be an entertaining, quirky gangster film. While I never got to see it theatrically, several months later I saw it on video and was amazed. Miller's Crossing is easily the best gangster film of all time.
The dialogue is second-to-none, and the acting is simply perfect. Albert Finney delivers one of the greatest scenes in cinematic history when he shows why he's known as ""an artist with the Thompson"". This is as close to perfect as a movie can get.
The wait for the release of this DVD was maddening. My trusty, old VHS copy had nearly worn out. When I finally picked this up, I was thrilled beyond belief. It was the first time I'd seen it widescreen, and the picture looked amazing compared to my old tape. While I would have liked to have seen a deluxe special edition, I'm more than pleased with this DVD.
If you enjoy movies of any kind, you owe it to yourself to own Miller's Crossing.",1062201600,,1076,4.4393939393939394

385145,5,6301963717,"Miller's Crossing was released in 1990.  It was a modest success and was relatively well received by critics. I saw the movie when it came out and liked it but thought it was nothing special. Repeated viewings on home video have made me change my opinion; it is now one of my favorite films.
Albert Finney is Leo, an Irish mob boss in an unnamed Eastern city during prohibition. Gabriel Byrne is Tom, his right hand man, a drunk and a compulsive gambler. Jon Polito is Caspar, a lesser mobster who comes to Finney  to get permission to kill Bernie Birnbaum (played by John Turturro), a bookie who has been profiting from information about boxing matches fixed by Polito. Finney refuses, saying to Polito that Turturro pays him protection money just like he does. In reality, Finney doesn't want to harm Turturro because he's romantically involved with the bookmaker's sister, played by Marcia Gay Harden.
The performances by the leads are excellent. Albert Finney and Gabriel Byrne are superb. Jon Polito is fantastic in every scene he appears. There is an unforgettable assassination-attempt scene where Albert Finney jumps out of a second floor window and then lets his Thompson submachine gun do his talking for him. I originally thought that Turturro's perfomance was more annoying than anything else, but even that has grown on me. It's said that an actor making you dislike his character is a sign of the excellence of the protrayal. The newly released DVD is fine and the sound quality is noticeably better than the tape. There is unfortunately no director's commentary track, a inexplicable major fault. The documentary interviewing cinematographer Barry Sonnenfeld somewhat makes up for this. In this documentary Sonnenfeld says that Turturro told him that he based  his performance as a whiny double-dealing homosexual Jew on his observations of Sonnenfeld on the set.  The movie has a polished yet artificial look that is somehow wholly appropriate. Just like a Shakespeare play, despite the fact that you can never forget that you are watching actors emoting on a  (sound)stage, the writing and the performances are so good that it doesn't matter.",1058572800,3,2159,5.03641456582633

The Coen brothers are one of the elite duos in film. Millers Crossing left me wanting more. The story was hard to follow at times.  I will need to watch it again to completely understand the story line. Recently I watched Road to Perdition. If you liked that film and haven't seen Millers Crossing please do immediately. Everything about this film is perfectly done. At times the gangsters take on the comic book imager not depicted in other movies.  The DVD was very good. Watch the special features section interview with Barry Sonnenfeld.  He has some great insight on the many films him and the Coen brothers have made.

Most of the performances are great, and at the time, many of the actors were virtually unknowns. I'd rank this just behind The Godfather and Goodfellas in term of prestige in the ganster genre, and above Scarface.

385149,5,6301963717,"After being very disappointed with ""Once Upon A Time in America"" this weekend, I decided to watch another gangster movie that I had never seen before.  This one gave me hope as it was done by the very brilliant Coen Brothers.  And I'm happy to say that this time I wasn't disappointed.  In fact, I had to watch it again the next day!  ""Miller's Crossing"" is a hauntingly beautiful masterpiece for all the right reasons.
The story gets pretty complex, as this is from the Coen Brothers.  It focuses Tom, a cold and smart-aleck lieutenant who works under an Irish Mob Boss, Leo.  Things get ugly when Leo gets into a disagreement with an Italian underboss who feels that he is getting a raw deal.  Things also get more complicated when Tom falls in love with Leo's woman.  Sooner or later Tom's going to have to decide who's side he's on and who his enemies  really are.  All of this leads to an uncontrollable scenario with the signature Coen twists and surprises.
I loved everything about this film.  From the very first minute I was hooked.  Sure, it starts out kind of slow, but this is almost necessary in all of the Coen movies.  There needs to be a heavy build-up so it can all come together.  And once things start spinning, it doesn't stop until the ending credits.  I loved how well-written the film was too.  It relies heavily on dialogue, but we love hearing the conversations these characters get into.  There's a lot of dark and subtle humor in it too, although it is a more serious film for the Coen Brothers.
The acting is also superb.  Gabriel Byrne is fantastic as the cold and heartless Tom, who always has something smart or sarcastic to say.  There is no way I could see anybody else playing the role.  It suits him that well.  John Turturro is also wonderful in his role and really gets to show off his acting ability.  One of his better roles, I think.  Everybody else in it is also terrific.
There's really not much to the DVD, which is a shame.  I'm glad that it has finally come out on DVD and all, but it would've been nice to see a few more extras added to it.  The special features included are cast interviews, trailers, a still gallery, and an interview with Barry Sonnenfeld.  The Barry Sonnenfeld interview I found very interesting as he explains the look and feel of this movie as opposed to the other Coen movies he has worked on.  The picture and sound quality is really good and brings out the tone of the movie.
""Miller's Crossing"" is a definite winner in my mind.  It is now quickly becoming a new favorite of mine.  If you're looking for a great crime film with a story, interesting characters, and an overwhelming plot, this is the one to see.  As with some of the other Coen movies, this one tends to get graphically violent at times, but it is never gratuitous and is always appropriate to the story.  An excellent Coen film that is bound to give you a new look into the Mafia world.",1055894400,48,2924,4.429643527204503

385182,5,6301963717,"Easily Coens' masterpiece...strewn with fascinating argot (""Whats the rumpus?"",  ""Always with the high hat""), breathtaking cliffhangers and plot about-turns, one of the BEST action sequences ever filmed with 'Danny Boy' in the backdrop (at par with the Val Kilmer/De Niro/Pacino cameo in ""Heat""), and despite never quite having amassed the epic acclaim of ""Godfather"", an absolutely exquisite, wholesome treat.
Even as a straightlaced gansta flick, it rocks. But beyond that at a deeper level, the movie is an exquisite narrative of more sapient themes such as personal ethics, chance, destiny, and one's command over one's own life -- particulary in the brilliant denouement that happens between Byrne's and Finney's characters.
Given the near-classic status this movie enjoys, one would have expected a lot more from a DVD though -- especially after we were made to wait for so long!

This third film by the Coen brothers established their spots as master film makers. After the success of Raising Arizona it would have been an easy move for them to start chruning out comedies left and right. Instead they dove into the Gangster genre where it again would have been simple to trun out some recycled garbage. Instead they transcended a genre and produced a film both majestic in its beauty and poignant in its commentary on the human condition. This film never bores me, no matter hom many times I have seen it. It never condescends to me. It never underestimates me. It makes me laugh, it makes me think, it damn near makes me cry. Even when put up against their later films, Miller's Crossing presents strong argument that it may be the Coen's best.",1054684800,11,944,4.526315789473684
385184,5,6301963717,"The Coen Brothers' third film is a gorgeous and brilliant modern take on the classic gangster film.  A flawless cast, headed by Gabriel Byrne in his best role ever, includes Albert Finney, John Turturro, Marcia Gay Harden and Joe Polito -- even brief appearances from Steve Buscemi, Frances McDormand and Sam Raimi. Every performance is terrific, but Byrne's Tom Reagan is a revelation -- a complex loner who can take a punch and hold on to his hat.  Sets and costumes are beautiful, Barry Sonnenfeld brings considerable talent as DP, and Carter Burwell's music is haunting. This is an often forgotten or underrated film by the Brothers Coen, but don't miss it -- it presages later devices (our hero lives at the Barton Arms, for instance) and is worthwhile in its own right.

The dvd is sparse and has no vocal input from its creators, which seems passing strange, and a shame, but you can hear the film in English, French or Spanish, with subtitles available in English or Spanish, and there is a fun 16-minute featurette called ""Shooting Miller's Crossing: A Conversation with Barry Sonnenfeld"", really a monologue about his experience, style and philosophy, including brief storyboard-film comparisons and a hysterical revelation about the ladies' room scene. There are also 22 behind-the-scenes photos; trailers for Miller's Crossing, Barton Fink and Raising Arizona; and multiple interview soundbites from Byrne, Harden and Turturro.

This is an ingenious genre film with twists, turns, double-crosses, great dialogue, beautiful shots and a superb cast, and it's great to have it out on dvd.  An essential film.",1054684800,5,1617,5.156488549618321

Once again we can bring the characters into our home and discussions, all the while telling the nay sayers to 'dangle'. A film that has reached such cult status for it's plot, casting, cinematography, and dialogue should not be missed. The transfer is wonderful. Clear and crisp images. Great colors and, as expected, a huge upgrade in sound quality. The special features are the only weak point, in my opinion. (There could've been more.)

385186,5,6301963717,"Undoubtedly, MILLERS CROSSING is the finest film to date by Joel and Ethan Coen.  This is not your run-of-the mill gangster film.  On the contrary, this is the Coen brothes take on the gangster epic.  Therefore, in the film is found all the signature trademarks of their work: dark humor, complex characters, clever and thoughtful plot twists, and an all-around, damn good-looking movie.  As always, the Coen brothers succeed in creating an amazing atmosphere for their characters to run amouck in.
As is the case with all their films, they assemble a cast of actors that is both unconventional and brilliant.  Gabriel Byrne (in what has to be the finest performance of his career) is the unlikely protagonist, Tom- a sort of boozing, sulking gangster who plays all sides and confuses one and all (including the viewer).  Marcia Gay Harden is both funny and sultry as the tough moll that pits two friends against one another.  Albert Finney, in an excellent performance, plays the other side of the love triangle.  John Turturro, Jon Polito and Steve Buscemi provide terrific support.
Special mention must be made to the hauntingly beautiful score by Carter Burwell, which perfectly adds to the dark and eery world that these people inhabit.

Gabriel Byrne is wonderfully understated, Albert Finney is almost unrecognizable, Jon Polito's Caspar is pleasantly unpleasant - I can easily go on. The cast is superb, the cinematography is beautiful, the irony laid on thick (Finney killing his would-be assassins to the lilting strains of Danny Boy).Everyone else has mentioned the music, so I will, too - it's great.

This film deftly pushes the humor without losing the drama, and deserves much more recognition.  After all, the Coens labored long and hard to achieve this.  This is their ""Citizen Kane"".
And the terrific casting: Early appearances by Steve Buscemi, John Turturro, plus Albert Finney as a mob boss (far from ""Tom Jones"").  Others in the comic book cast have memorable one-liners.

The camera work is beautifully done, the music perfect, and the acting is all good -- and some of it is truly outstanding, particularly Gabriel Byrne's and Albert Finney's performances.
One of my favorite scenes in the movie involves Leo (Albert Finney), a few assassins sent to kill him, and some very enthusiastic gunplay. I won't spoil it, but watch Leo's cigar, and his facial expressions. Albert Finney is GOOD.
And Gabriel Byrne was so good as Tom that I've never been able to watch him in any other movie without thinking, ""Where's his fedora?""
The setting of the Prohibition Era is perfectly rendered, yet the characters are perfectly archetypical and the story is timeless.
Anyone who likes Gangster Movies must watch Miller's Crossing.
(And I cannot resist this response to one previous review: Anyone who thinks it's ""boring"" should TRY WATCHING IT, instead of fast-forwarding through it looking for the explosions and car chases.)",1051574400,2,1074,5.107954545454546
385244,5,6301963717,"A rich, complex masterpiece of a movie.  Like a fine old tapestry, the overall effect is wonderful to behold; then you begin to examine it closely, and the artistry involved in each thread and every weave becomes dazzlingly apparent.  This is a movie that commands your complete attention as it unfolds; immediately begins to haunt you when it ends; and then continues to beckon to you for another viewing.
The script is labyrinthine, centering around Tom Regan (Gabriel Byrne) as he maneuvers among competing factions of the mob (Albert Finney, Jon Polito, and others) during the Prohibition era.  Mystery builds as one double cross piles on top of another while unexpected twists and turns complicate the puzzle.  The viewer is kept entertainingly off-balance throughout.  Nothing is predictable; surprises abound; and yet, by the time the closing credits roll, everything is resolved in a way that makes perfect sense, with each character having remained true to himself (or herself) all along.
Characters this complex demand the most of the actors playing them, and happily, the entire cast of ""Miller's Crossing"" is uniformly superb.  Gabriel Byrne underplays beautifully, imbuing Tom with a supernatural calm that always seems just-this-close to erupting into something frightening and violent.  Albert Finney gives one of his finest performances as the gangster kingpin who is slowly beginning to lose control of both the rackets and the local politicians; the scene in which he senses invaders in his home and slowly but surely plans his escape strategy is brilliantly played.  John Turturro scores heavily as a conniving second-rate hood who wants to move into the big-time; and Marcia Gay Harden (always an underrated actress despite her eventual supporting actress Oscar win for ""Pollock"") is nothing short of perfection as his toughly protective - and confidently sexy - sister who can more than hold her own among the male denizens of this seedy underworld.
Add to this marvelous mix of script and cast some razor-sharp editing, a lush musical score, exquisite cinematography, and intelligent direction, and what you end up with is a film that begs to designated a genuine classic of the American cinema. For once 20th Century-Fox Home Video has done justice to one of their DVD releases.  This edition offers a sharp video transfer and clear audio.  The DVD also includes the Theatrical Trailer for this film and two other Coen Brothers offerings, ""Barton Fink"" and ""Raising Arizona""; very insightful interview clips with Gabriel Byrne, Marcia Gay Harden, and John Turturro on the making of the film; an unfortunately limited (and mediocre) stills gallery; and an audio commentary.

385245,5,6301963717,"Certainly my favorite Cohen brothers film (and I consider myself an aficionado of their work) and one of my favorite films of all-time, Miller's Crossing is a brushstroke of genius, in every way imaginable, a complete masterwork if I've ever seen one.
The plot has been summed up in previous reviews: a power-struggle between the Irish mob and the Italians in an unnamed city on the east coast (I'm assuming). It involves complex loyalties and trusts, forged and broken, keeping you guessing character motives and alliances until the very end.
Gabriel Byrne plays the wonderfully dark Tom Regan, right hand man to the always-brilliant Albert Finney's Liam 'Leo' O'Bannon. Everyone in the film shines. I was particularly taken with Jon Polito's Giovanni `Johnny Caspar' Casparo. On the surface, a hot-headed simpleton, but underneath, one of the more torn and complex mobsters since Pacino's Michael Corleone.
The theme of the film can be summed up by Johnny Caspar's frustrated expectations of his employees: ""Friendship.....character....ethics....."" The movie exists as a complicated character study of these traits and how they affect the lives of the many characters involved. Some of the villains in the film seem to live by the `honor among the thieves' credo more so than the films 'heroes' if indeed there are any.
The film looks stunning, as can be expected from the Cohen's, and the aforementioned score is one of the most used in film trailers to this day. The scenes at Miller's Crossing with Tom chasing his hat and then being put to the test later in the film are simply stunning.

I have watched it many times, and each time I catch some new bit of information or see a story angle or acting nuance that enriches the movie for me. I admire many cinema works, but this one (along with Raising Arizona and to a lesser degree other works by the Coens) is among the few that remain fresh and entertaining even after multiple viewings.
One suggestion; because the actors employ a diverse set of accents and because the language is steeped in a vernacular that takes some getting used to, at some point you may want to watch it with subtitles to be sure you catch the subtleties and nuances of the story.

He is placed in a series of comprimising circumstances that test his loyalties to his boss, his woman, and his honor.  John Turturro, ALbert Finney, and Jon Polito all play great supporting roles that really flesh out this unsung gem of a movie.
It is rare to find a ""gangter"" (not gangsta) film that has more to do with the characters than with planning out hits.  The closest comparison to Miller's Crossing that I can think of from recent years is Road to Perdition, but this movie does not have the at times over the top, ""sons are put on Earth to trouble their fathers- I love you son"" melodrama I tasted in that movie.  Miller's Crossing is more about Gabriel Byrne's quiet portrayal of a man who will do what he feels he must--at any cost to others or himself.
Long story short, if you liked The Godfather movies, Road to Perdition, or Carlito's Way...full speed ahead, buy this movie.  If you are a fan of Coen brothers movies, and you're wondering if their early movies are as good as their later movies--yes, they are; give this one a try.",1047600000,,1296,4.461864406779661
385428,4,6301963717,"For those unfamiliar with Miller's Crossing, it is a true masterpiece that has dwelt largely in obscurity since its release in the early nineties. When asked for the Coen brother's greatest achievement, the kneejerk reaction is for the masses to yell ""Fargo"" while a small group whispers ""Miller's Crossing"". This is for two reasons: one, no one wants to knock Fargo, a great film that brought the Coens to the forefront. Second, it is almost like having knowledge of a terrific secret. No one would believe you anyway, and you feel pretty smart about it.
Three things stand out to me about MC: 1. Gabriel Byrne. This holds par with his performance in ""The Usual Suspects"" -- which is good, he is in about 90% of the movie. 2. John Turturro. Hell, what isn't this guy great in? A Coen regular, his Bernie is outstanding. 3. Imagery. I won't give a single thing away, except this: just think about hats during the movie. Hats.
The cat is truly out of the bag when MC is released on DVD, but that's OK. Those who know what I mean will only smile and nod. Those who don't, well, I only wish I could see this again for the first time. As Johnny said in the movie, ""You never say 'I told you so.'""
Please enjoy this great mob flick.",1047513600,9,1227,4.409691629955947
385429,5,6301963717,"There's no use saying Miller's Crossing is better than Godfather.  It is more nuanced, with more irony and quirkiness, but simply doesn't have the scope of that classic.  Frankly, even though they are both mafia movies, it's rather like comparing apples to oranges... where the Godfather is an epic view from the top, Miller's Crossing is a morality play seen from an outsider's perspective.  Where the Godfather is straightforward storytelling, Miller's Crossing has symbolic humor, multiple layers, and an intricate plot.
You can watch Miller's Crossing over and again, and take something away from it every time.  I would even go so far as to say it is the best thing the Coen brothers (Raising Arizona, Fargo, O Brother...) have ever done.  In the simplest terms, it is brilliant.

Although it never received it's due in it's day, many covet the film for it's absorbing script, mesmerizing acting and jaw dropping technical beauty. The story revolves around a hard nosed mobster who is sharp, cunning and loyal despite his flaws. It also showcases rich characters you simply never see from the tepid world of major studios. Even if you don't catch all that is happening behind the motivations for the plot and it's characters on the first viewing. The acting by Gabriel Byrne, Marcia Gay Harding, John Turturro, John Polito, J.E. Freeman and great Albert Finny will keep your attention glued. Also the technical presence of it's cinematography and sound will startle you now that DVD can properly showcase it. Add on top another gorgeous soundtrack by the underrated Carter Burwell, and it will just astound you that this film never swept the Academy Awards. IT IS THAT GREAT! The DVD won't be stacked with extras but, trust me, this movie is so good you won't need them. This film and a few others by Kubrick and Foreman are the only dramas, I watch over and over.

385431,5,6301963717,"This is a different kind of gangster flick. It is an intelligent foray into the world of the roaring twenties and the corruption and speakeasies engendered by Prohibition. This money making turf is zealously guarded by rival crime bosses: Leo, masterfully played by Albert Finney, and Johnny Caspar, well played by Jon Polito.
Tom Reagan, beautiful played by the darkly smoldering Gabriel Byrne, is Leo's main man. Unfortunately for him, he is feeling the noose around his neck tighten, as he owes some big gambling debts that he is unable to pay. Moreover, he is head over heels in love with Verna, played with hard edged, sexual intensity by Marcia Gay Harden, who just happens to be Leo's main squeeze. Moreover, Verna's bookmaker brother, Bernie Bernbaum, played with smarmy abandon by John Turturro, has a contract on his life and is on the run. When Tom finds himself helping Bernie, he soon discovers that no good deed goes unpunished. All this makes life very complicated and difficult for Tom.
At times, it is difficult to ascertain who the good guys and the bad guys really are, or for whom they really work, as they all seem to march to the beat of a different drummer. There is more to what is going on than initially meets the eye. Make no mistake, this is a multi-faceted movie that works well on many levels. As with all Coen brothers' films, there is an underlay of sly humor that permeates the film.
The dialogue is sharp and evocative of another time, as it is laden with Prohibition era slang, and its stacatto delivery is most effective. The characters all walk the walk and talk the talk. The  performances by the entire cast are stellar. Look for Steve Buscemi in the small role of Mink, and do not blink or you will miss Frances McDormand's performance as Johnny Caspar's secretary. All in all, this is an excellent film and another feather in the collective cap of the Coen brothers.",1039305600,2,1907,4.692537313432836
385432,5,6301963717,"I'm a Coen Brothers fan.  While Fargo and O' Brother tend to garner the most acclaim, I firmly believe this is their finest film.  The characters are developed slowly and consistently, yet the scenes are short and witty.  The dialogue is somewhat film noir, and may sound a bit corny at first.  But you soon realize that this is a period piece and the jargon is true to the Roaring Twenties.
I didn't find the plot complex.  It is intelligent and unpredictable.  Each time I watch it, I catch a new
connecting detail.  The Irish music adds a wonderful flavor, and the entire film has a romantic feel reminiscent of the Sicilian scenes in Godfather II.  The more I watch it, the more I like it.",1039046400,2,693,4.444444444444445
385503,5,6301963717,"You won't see a movie next year or the next that will beat this one.  Miller's Crossing doesn't contain a bad frame of photography, a poor word of dialogue, or a momentary slack in the level of acting.  Plus, it's full of absolutely classic gangster-movie moments.  The intricacy of the plot will be only one of the reasons you'll want to see it multiple times.  It's eye candy, ear candy, brain candy.
Gabriel Byrne shines as the Christ figure Tom Reagan (everyone exclaims ""Jesus, Tom"" to him throughout the movie), who sacrifices himself, his girlfriend, his career, and his friendships to ""put things right"" for Leo.  Albert Finney is amazing as Leo, the fading Irish Prohibition-era mob boss who's going soft but still can rise to the fire of his younger days (""the old man is still an artist with the Thompson"").  John Turturro (as usual) turns in a brilliant acting job playing the ""shmatte kid"" Bernie Birnbaum.  J. E. Freeman (the Dane) will make you wet your pants when he approaches with a long-barreled pistole.  Marcia Gay Harden smokes the screen and discombobulates Tom's heart as the sultry Verna.  And Joe Polito is hilarious as the greaseball Johnny Casper (Giovanni Gasparo) who carries out murdeous plots while dim-wittedly trying to analyze the ""ethics"" of each situation.

385507,5,6301963717,"Miller's Crossing has gone down in history as one of the gangster greats. And rightly so. It is, I assure you, a dazzling display of film-making. I won't bore you with the story outline (check the editorial reviews for that) but I will tell you why think this is one of my all-time favourites (I watch it at least once every other year).
More than anything else, Miller's Crossing fireworks display of acting talent, Albert Finney powerful as the hard-as-nails gangland boss; J.E. Freeman who almost steals the show as the towering, sinister, almost Dickensian mob side-kick, Eddie Dane; John Turturro who shines as conniving, gutless conman, Bernie Birmbaum. But for my money the film's best performance is Jon Polito who plays Italian gang boss, Johnny Caspar. Polito hisses, explodes, cowers, wangles, philosophises, smarms and turns a performance that has Academy Award written all over it
Visually this a stunning film, with lots of memorable sequences and scenarios composed with true artistic flair. The action scenes are great, tommy gun bullets fly thick and fast, gangland slayings are sometimes shockingly authentic and the rising death toll is recorded by the mobsters with detachment, like the latest sports results.
The film would be perfect were it not for the plot, which is ludicrously complicated - twisting and turning every second. Still deserves those 5 stars, however.",1023667200,4,1390,5.182222222222222
385508,5,6301963717,"Simpley fantastic. This movie is a masterpiece for the Coen brothers. The picture is visually stunning. The costumes and the atmosphere are wonderful. This movie is a throw back to old gangster movies and a different time. Albert Finney, John Turturro and Gabriel Bryne fill out this cast of quirky characters. The dialouge is well written and fun. Turturro gives an amazing performance as the sleazy Bernie Bernbaum. Gabriel Bryne is perfect as the cynical man behind the man. And Albert Finney is my personal favorite as Leo, an old time Boss of the cities political machine. Don't forget Steve Buschemi as Mink and The Dane.

385509,5,6301963717,"""Miller's Crossing"" is a smart prohibition-era tale of an Irish mafia lieutenant, Tom (Gabriel Byrne,) friend and direct political operations consultant to the Irish crime boss, Leo (Albert Finney.)  The leader of an Italian section, Casper (Jon Polito,) with henchman Eddie Dane (J.E. Freeman) and a personal view of ethics, asks Irish ""commander-in-chief"" to eliminate the brother of his girlfriend for chiselling into the Italians' gambling fixes.  When Leo turns them down against Tom's recommendation, a series of bloody political moves occur from both sides.  To complicate things, Leo wants to ask the girl to marry, but doesn't know she's also involved with Tom.  When Tom informs Leo out of friendship, he kicks Tom out of the family.  Then, Tom resentfully assumes a role as a bought-lieutenant of the Italian boss.
  Everything in the film is Grade A.  This is a well-planned, thought-out mob film, and a true noir gangster picture.  Everything from script to editing is treated with an efficiency that makes this movie very dark with minimum means.  The best gangster films are not any more true than this one.  Rest assured: the photography is not the only beauty in the movie.  This film is every bit as eloquent as ""Dick Tracy"", ""Crisscross"", Hill's ""Dillinger"", ""Out Of the Past"", ""Bound"", ""Bonnie And Clyde"", ""The Untouchables"", ""Bladerunner"", ""L.A. Confidential"", ""Key Largo"", ""St. Valentine's Day Massacre"", ""The Maltese Falcon"", or ""The Godfather"".  It is also as colorful.  It can only be so underrated by being such a strong and colorful narrative of American prohibition mafia friendship.  What's wrong with people?: for a change, the ""Irish mafia's rule?""  Get with the program, people!
  The entire cast is memorable.  J.E. Freeman as henchman ""Eddie Dane"" is an especially frightening lieutenant to the Italian wielding a .45 revolver and standing taller than Dirty Harry.  Jon Polito is great and funny as the fat spaghetti-Italian boss, ""Johnny Casper.""  Albert Finney fits as an aging toughguy-killer and crime boss, ""Leo"", who wants to marry a girl barely in adulthood.  Gabriel Byrne is the ""luck-of-the-Irish"" mob lieutenant, ""Tom"", who has a fist planted on his shnozzer in nearly every scene.  Marcia Gay Harden is the two-timing political defense for her fix-chiselling brother, played by John Turturro.  Steve Buscemi is a fickle and Eddie Dane's son.  Frances McDormand cameos as a secretary.  Others are equally convincing.",1022976000,,2461,5.262210796915167

I could keep going. There are several reasons why Miller's Crossing is the best Coen Brothers movie, but the biggest reason is the dialogue. From the opening monologue on the ""et'ics"" of a fixed fight, to the final confrontation between our protagonist and his tormentor, the dialogue is like no other movie filmed since, what, 1949? The dialogue is rattled off like a Tommy gun, or enunciated slowly and lovingly like pillow talk. It always crackles with wit and energy. It provokes regular belly laughs (you've never heard so many euphemisms for ""Jew"", lovingly applied by two Jewish filmmakers). And it moves a Byzantine plot along like an energetic traffic cop. There are zero false notes in this movie. The sets and scenery are brilliantly evocative of the Prohibition era. A miraculous cast, from Coen regulars such as Jon Polito, Steve Buscemi and (briefly) Michael Badalucco, to stars Gabriel Byrne, Albert Finney and Marcia Gay Harden, are uniformly brilliant. Fargo, Barton Fink and Blood Simple are three of the best movies of the past 20 years. Miller's Crossing outshines them all.

I went with a good friend to see in this movie when it was released in 1990 because the trailer looked so breathtaking. We were shocked at how great a film this truly was. To attempt to draw some perspective for you I will breakdown my movie tastes to show you that while I like a good drama it is not the tops on my genre preference list. My movie tastes go roughly in this order. 1) Horror 2) Horror-Sci-Fi 3) Gangster Drama 4) Action 5) Sci-Fi 6) Drama 7) Comedy. This film had to leap two of my favorite genre categories to get into my overall top 5, very tough indeed.

385578,5,6301963717,"In contrast to 90% of currently produced movies, (...) ""Miller's Crossing"" has a satisfying depth and a ""chewy"" complexity that rewards you every time you watch it.
""Miller's Crossing"" is why God let us invent movies. For what it is, it is the perfect movie. Dialogue, music by Carter Burwell, set design, camera work, acting, wardrobe, sound, et al; everything done as well as human craftsmanship and genius talent allows. Not a single wasted or superfluous scene, note, line of dialogue, actor or set piece.
The dialogue is excruciatingly sharp, fresh and always revealing of character (I wish *I* could write dialogue as well as the Coens!). Aside from ""Casablanca"" or ""Network,"" you simply cannot find dialogue in any other movie that is literally such a joy to hear because it is so well crafted in every sense of the word.
The coloring in the movie is a rich, dark jewel tone palette: dark, pure greens; ruby reds (although not many of these), saturated earth tones, grays and blacks with enough accent whites to keep the viewer's eye stimulated.
The acting is top notch. Jon Polito will, forever and ever, always be ""Caspar"" to me, a pirhana who just happens to wear a suit and tie. He was born for that role. Gabrielle Byrne plays ""Tom Regan,"" a brooding, intelligent, manipulative lieutenant with a mysterious, inviolate internal code of honor to Albert Finney's brash, ruthless yet sentimental crime boss ""Leo.""
As an aspiring (and perspiring and sometimes expiring) screenwriter, I can tell you that ""Miller's Crossing"" is one of the densest, most well-told stories I've ever seen on film.

Amid that kind of competition, this movie did not last on the big screen. It's a crying shame because after having seen all three films, I say Miller's Crossing blows away the competition.
  What really sets this movie apart from the others is the deep character development and excellent dialogue. Another reviewer called the dialogue ""flowery"" but without the sharp, witty and fast-paced dialogue, this would not be a ""thinking man's"" movie. You must pay attention to what each and every character is saying and doing or you will miss important facts, tidbits of information, and foreshadowing. Is it a double cross or a triple cross? Who's playing who? What's the setup? The characters are all too human and make their share of mistakes. Their motivations and actions can be believed. Gabriel Byrne truly shines in his role as Tom.

Byrne's portrayal of a character of mixed-motivations and passions -loyalty and spite towards his boss, enrapturement and disgust towards the woman, steely self-control and compulsive gambling- all interplay to create a complex anti-hero. In the end you know he wins, but you are still not sure what he was fighting for or what he has gained. His weaknesses are brought out just as strongly as his strengths.
Although they oversimplify and caricature the mayor and the police chief, the Prohibition-era ethics and hypocrisy are masterfully portrayed. The competing mob bosses, each beset by his own romanticism and bizarre idealism along with their ruthlessness, also provide a backdrop for Tom's manipulations.

Tom (a dashing and coolly intense Gabriel Byrne)a mobster lietenent, always has a smarter, better idea for things. Sadly, on one hand, these ideas seem to backfire on him, making him look like a renegade fool, but in dark, bizarre twists, things seem to work out even better for him, finally proving him right in the eyes of all. I'll stop there as further information would ruin the magical unfolding of this thrilling, dark ride. Just believe this ""reversal of fortune"" story is worth seeing the frustrating demise Tom initially undergoes. The usual suspects of many a Coen film are all here: Frances McDormand, Steve Buscemi, and John Turturro. New to the company include a very potent Albert Finney and recent Oscar winner Marcia Gay Harden. Besides the cast, the Coens' rely on the craftspeople of many of their other works to solidify their amazing visuals and production values.

385637,5,6301963717,"This was one of the first in the 90's wave of slick, reconstructed gangster/crime films (the Tarantino/Ritchie oeuvre, Usual Suspects, et al), and really the best.  Gabriel Byrne's Hamlet-like advisor plays against Albert Finney's Sonny Corleone-like boss, double- and triple-crossing his way through threats, fists, gunfire, and Marcia Gay Harden's right hook into a big payday and said Ms. Harden's arms.  A classic noir-style protagonist, Byrne's Tom Reagan is hard-boiled and gets harder as the film progresses.
Though supposedly loosely based on ""The Glass Key"" by Dashiell Hammett, there is a lot of James Cain's ""Love's Lovely Counterfeit"" thrown in, including much of the sparkling dialogue (""Hey, Tom, Bernie's been lookin' for ya.""  ""Well, I'm right here, I'm not made of glass."").  It definitely has the Coen touch with some quirky characters and wait-for-it humor, but these touches only add to the charm and texture of the Prohibition-era story.

Miller's Crossing is that film for me. From the first time I watched this movie in 1990 to my 50th viewing a couple of months back the film has always seemed fresh, vibrant & undeniably a true Coen brothers movie. Filled with the usual oddball characters (from the sleazy Bernie Bernbaum to our quiet Anti-Hero Tom), hilarious dialogue & twisted plotline we enter the dark heart of 1930's Gangland America. Tom Reagan (Gabriel Byrne, in probably his best role) is the right hand man to Irish underworld boss Leo (Albert Finney) and also lover to Leo's moll Verna (Oscar Winner Marcia Gay Harden, in her first role). All is well until fellow gangster Johnny Caspar (Jon Polito) tells Leo that he wants to whack Bernie Bernbaum (John Turturro) for selling out his fixed fights. Unknown to Johnny however is the fact that Bernie is Verna's brother and when Leo refuses permission to kill him a gang war erupts. Tom finds himself torn between his loyalty to Leo and his love to Verna and thus begins a spiral into deceit, betrayal & death. The major theme of this movie however lies within loyalties, truth and as Johnny Caspar puts so eloquently at the beginning of the film ""it's about ethics""--funny coming from a deranged killer & mob boss. In this world of gangsters, it is misguided loyalties which kill and words of truth that cause trouble. Only Tom and Johnny Caspar's muscle The Dane (J.E. Freeman) seem to know which way is up and the two clash constantly throughout the film. Tom always seems in control as the movie progresses, even as his world falls down around him, and we wonder if his brillant Machiavellian-like plan will come to fruition. I'll stop here and let the film do the rest. Every one of the performances is top-notch and it is hard to see character actors like Freeman & Polito in any other movie--it's almost like they were born for these roles. Byrne is solid as the stoic Tom, Finney is a marvel as Leo and you can see why Marcia Gay Harden's career florished after this role. But really Turturro turns this film into a masterpiece with his classic portrayal as Bernie. He definitely deserved a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for this role but the Academy ignored this movie as they would all Coen Bros. films until Fargo. In closing, Miller's Crossing is a film for fans of film, with beautiful cinematography, Carter Burwell's brillant soundtrack, excellent acting and tour de force directing by the Coens. It begs repeated viewings and never fails to deliver. A Masterpiece of Cinema and my all-time favorite film.",991958400,11,2692,4.681434599156118

Set design is impeccable, costumes and (especially) hair are great, dialogue is without peer.  And take note:  Although NO ONE ever mentions it in their reviews, this movie is notable for the wierd gay love triangle which drives much of the story within this gangster period piece, a really unusual plot device for the genre.

385640,5,6301963717,"I've been singing the praises of this movie for years, and it placed the Coen brothers at the top of my list of Movie-Producing Geniuses, from which none of their subsequent movies has given them cause to topple.  While I rate Barton Fink and Fargo alongside this movie, I feel there's a slightly greater seriousness of purpose with Miller's Crossing which I appreciate.  Their latest two movies, The Big Lebowski and O Brother Where Art Thou, while brilliant, are both lighter and more purely comedic.
Several things attract me to Miller's Crossing: 1) I am not a particularly visual person, but this movie is so visually beautiful as to be conspicuous for this feature.  The composition of each shot, the lighting of the scenes and particularly their wondrous use of a rich color palette--all of these things conspire to make an extraordinarily beautiful viewing experience.  It is a color movie which does the Film Noir genre proud.  2) The character of Tom Regan (wonderfully underplayed by Gabriel Byrne) is a delicious enigma.  He seems motivated by a strong (but unspoken) code of ethics, and he seems to be unable to lie even when it gets him into trouble (the exception to this rule is his efforts to rid the world of Johnny Caspar, though even then it's not so much lying as maneuvering).  It is also striking to me that every single character in the movie who interacts with Tom emphatically says ""Jesus, Tom"" or ""Christ, Tom"" to him at some point (usually as a reaction to some uncomfortable truth he has just spoken).  The movie is supposedly an adaptation of Dashiel Hammett's story The Glass Key (though it's a stretch to my mind--maybe inspired is a better word than adapted), and Hammett virtually invented the hard-boiled detective.  Tom, while not a detective, is of that hard-boiled cast, saying very little but making his words count.  There's something very appealing about his seeming singleness of purpose.  3) I'm drawn to movies which, like a Bach fugue, cannot be grasped after a viewing or two.  I think great movie art keeps revealing itself, paying dividends for effort.  This is a movie where one needs to pay attention.  Multiple interconnected plots unfold simultaneously, and alliances are constantly shifting; one never knows just how much a person can be taken at their word.
While I adore other mob movies like The Godfather and Goodfellas, neither introduces an element of mystery and intrigue the way Miller's Crossing does, and certainly neither is more finely crafted than this movie.  I give it my highest rating!",988675200,8,2555,4.909302325581395

It's always puzzling to me that the Coen brothers are so disdained within the critical community.  Is it because they sense that Joel and Ethan are essentially ridiculing the entire medium?  Oh don't get me wrong; they obviously love movies, and they make them better than anyone, but how is a film critic supposed to take the scene where Albert Finney goes ballistic with a never-ending stream of withering pellets on a pair of gangsters in his own bedroom?  Critics know the Cohens are lampooning  ""sacred""  film moments such as when Sonny Corleone gets obliterated at the toll-booth  (to say nothing of Warren and Faye getting theirs back in  '67).  They know it, and they dislike it.  We're told that they're too  ""cold"", they're  ""pretentious"", they're  ""mocking"", they're ultimately not serious moviemakers.  These are doubtless the same critics who used similar terminology in regards to Stanley Kubrick, but now that he's safely passed on, they can call him a  ""genius"".  Well, in any event, the Coens are better than Kubrick ever was  (ok, *Lolita*  was great), anyway.  As for comparisons with  *Goodfellas* -- there IS none.  *Miller's Crossing*  accomplishes more in 2 hours than Scorsese's bloated movie does in 3.  The Coens are surgeons.  No scene is wasted  (statements about  ""stylistic tangents""  to the contrary).
This movie's a masterpiece, dude.  Has Jon Polito ever been better?  For that matter, has Gabriel Byrne ever been better?  (Was Jeff Bridges ever funny AT ALL until  *Lebowski*?  Et cetera.)  Obviously, actors need masterful scripts.  All too often, they don't get them.  The Coens write masterful scripts.  Watch  *Miller's Crossing*  and let the character development astound you.  The theme of personal honor is rigorously pursued throughout, and the intricate plot is gravy.  The Coens are the best American filmmakers since Orson Welles, and any film  ""critic""  who says otherwise is just giving you the high hat.",988588800,,2113,5.043859649122807

This film is superb in every respect - writing, direction, cinematography, even music.  The film's theme is honor among thieves, and the opening scene in which this theme is enunciated (""if you can't trust a fix, what can you trust?"") is a classic.  The Coen brothers' genius in creating memorable characters is displayed throughout; each of the major characters is a delight to watch: the cynical (and devious) Tom Regan, the vampish (and devious) Verna, the treacherous (and devious) Bernie Birnbaum, the sentimental (and murderous) Leo, the philosophical (and murderous) Johnny Caspar, the sadistic (and murderous) Eddie Dane (you may start to notice a pattern or two emerging); and even minor characters, such as Frankie and Tic-Tac, are sharply drawn and brought vividly life.  And nobody writes better dialogue than the Coens (Tom: ""[Rug was] not a bad guy, if looks, brains, and personality don't count."" Verna: ""You'd better hope they don't."") If one were so inclined, one might describe ""Miller's Crossing"" as a post-modern exercise in cinematic revisionism, an ironic deconstruction of the traditional gangster film in which the Coen brothers take the elements of the genre and assemble them into a decontextualized parody which emphasizes surfaces and shapes: the fedoras, the cashmere overcoats and leather gloves, the smoking tommy guns with limitless magazines, the cigarette (no filters please) and the whisky bottles and the vintage autos.

Such is the case with Miller's Crossing, categorizable because it's a gangster film, but that's about it. Everything else is completely original, completely Coen-like. The story revolves around Tom (Gabriel Byrne) and his calculated gamble of playing both sides of the city's (I don't believe the name of the city is ever mentioned) organized crime underworld. Initially Tom is a trusted right hand man in the Irish mob, but power starts to shift toward the Italians. So Tom tries to see how things are gonna turn out. Then the Irish boss finds out that Tom has been sleeping with his girl and pushes Tom over to the Italians. But nothing with the Coen brothers is ever that simple.

385708,5,6301963717,"Hats.  It's all about the hats.
I haven't seen this much attention paid to headwear since the Indiana Jones movies.  ""What gives?"" I ask myself every time I watch it.  The final poetic image we see over the opening credits is of a fedora blown across an autumn clearing.  Then, Gabriel Byrne (Tommy) goes to Marcia Gay Harden's (Verna) apartment, to retrieve his hat that he lost to her in a poker game the night before.  Needless to say, that's not all he came for.  From here, the action spins off into a labyrinthine series of crosses and double-crosses, where you never know whose allegiance is with whom.
So what do we make of all these hats?  My take is that this movie is about men who know how to exist within the rules of a certain world, that of Prohibition-era mobsters.  But everyone here is flawed, enough so that their judgement is clouded and at times they forget why those rules are in place.  Tommy is a wise lieutenant in the Irish mob, but he has a dangerous gambling habit (and is currently in the middle of a slump) and his hat offers disguise from would-be collectors.  Johnny Caspar, head of the Italian mob, is constantly telling people that he's ""sick a gettin' the high hat,"" a reference to the lack of respect he's afforded.  But does he really deserve that respect?  Probably not, since he doesn't even have the sense to cover his shiny bald head with a stylish chapeau.  (*There's a moment where someone refers to Johnny as `Giovanni Casparro', a reference to his necessarily hidden heritage and an example of the details the Coen's throw in as a reward for an attentive audience*)  And if we want to stretch the theme to its limits, a mobster, dead in an alley, has his toupee lifted by a curious kid and his dog.  His friends later misinterpret this as a sign of disrespect, and it pushes the impending turf war to the brink.  So the hat covers the head, just as the flaws of these powerful men cloud their good sense.  It's either that, or a typically stylish Coen red herring.  Frankly, I'm such a fan of their movies that either answer will suffice.
If you are generally put-off by the Coen's movies, by their ludicrous non-sequiters that amount to little more than stylish tangents, I implore you to check out two scenes here that are picture perfect in conception and execution.  The first is the opening scene in Albert Finney's (Leo) office.  Johnny Casper has come to him ostensibly to ask for a favour, but really to talk of `ethics'.  We get our first glimpses into the hatred between these two men, and their respective henchmen, Tommy and Eddie Dane.  Even though the scene is dialogue heavy and for the most part quite civil, the Coen's manage to throw in many other subtle hints as to the incivility that is to come.  The second scene has Leo surviving a hit, when the mobsters sent to kill him accidentally set fire to the first floor of his house.  Leo feels the heat (literally and metaphorically), and manages to get the jump on his attackers.  There is one great shot here, where cinematographer Barry Sonnenfeld manages to show the floorboards in Leo's bedroom actually warping from the heat.  It's a shining example of his work throughout the movie.  Both of these scenes are simple and economically, fitting perfectly into and advancing forward the plot.
All the actors here are top-notch, managing to portray these flawed men with the right mixture of charisma and world-weariness.  Albert Finney, Jon Polito, J.E. Freeman, and John Turturro are the standouts.  Turturro has some of the best moments.  First when he begs for his life, and then when he cynically tries to quote his begging to save himself again.  And Gabriel Byrne, an actor who I very rarely like, is perfect.  He is asked to carry the movie, and he does a fantastic job.
`Miller's Crossing' is not cold and pretentious, as its reputation usually states.  I admit that the Coen's fall into that trap sometimes.  But not this time.  Here, they've crafted a tightly plotted and suspenseful movie that never wastes a moment of its time, or of yours.",979344000,14,4067,4.63268156424581

The cinematography and music score are notable too. One of the few movies that gets better with each viewing -I always find something new in the plot or characterisations.

385710,5,6301963717,"Though it seems northern and cold, we never actually find out where Miller's Crossing is set. My guess is somewhere on the border of Ellroy's corrupted LA, Scorsese's Mafia world and a third territory; a pulpy, straight-faced, frosty, warm Coen Brothers land. Here, a two timing bookie, Bernie Bernbaum has upset a rather strange gangster, Johnny Caspar. Caspar's primary concern is ""etics"" i.e. ethics. For the bookie's unethical offense (he leaked information about a fixed fight), Caspar and his domineeringly vicious right-hand man, Eddie Dane want to have Bernbaum killed because ""If you can't trust a fix, what can ya trust"". For the killing to go through, Caspar must have a sit down with the guy who's ""runnin things"". That guy is Leo, the mick who may or may not be going soft. Either way, he won't give Caspar the go ahead because he's in love with Bernie's sister Verna.  Except that Verna, is in what is called a ""business arrangement"" with Leo and is really in love with Tom, Leo's right-hand man who may or may not be cold-blooded. He and Verna are engaged in a love/maim relationship. ""I never met a person who makes being a son-of-a-bitch such a point of pride"" she tells him.
Rest assured that the above synopsis is about five minutes worth of film. The Byzantine plot, involving crosses, double crosses and more crosses, is arousing in its dexterity. Guided by Gabriel Byrne's studied, intelligent performance as Tom, a man with an acid tongue, revealing as little as possible, the plot which spirals immaculately around the enigmatic protagonist is shaped into a figure of sculpted perfection. No scene is wasted. Not one line of dialogue is unmemorable. Yet Miller's Crossing has paid for that. Many critics have complained that for a film to be so aesthetically attractive, it has to be slick and soulless. It has never gotten the respect it deserved, never gets mentioned in the same breath with other crime classics such as Chinatown or The Maltese Falcon, films I consider Miller's Crossing to be at least the equal of. Then again, Miller's Crossing is no ordinary crime film.
At times it resembles an absurdist comedy as when a spectacularly obese woman joins a violent confrontation between Tom and Leo with her own comically small handbag. Or when one member of a completely bribable police force shoots an innocent shop keeper dead, and laughs pathetically at the dead man's shaking body, he looks back at the rest of the police force, they all start laughing loudly as if they were in some comic strip. Then the police officer is riddled with a staggering amount of bullets. At other times, the film is a melodrama as when Verna confronts Tom about the fate of her brother. In the film's most memorable scene, out on Miller's Crossing, a beautiful part of the forest in a seemingly perpetual fall season, the place where many of the ""hits"" i.e. murders take place a man running infront of another, about to be executed starts begging pathetically for his life. ""I beg of you,"" he asks first. ""Look in your heart"" he then pleads. ""I'm praying to you,"" he finally begs, on his knees in a chilling pictorial of cruelty and beauty. The outcome of this scene is the axis on which the whole film rotates. That something may lie under those poisonous one liners and sculpted exteriors. A softness that should in all self-serving wisdom remain obscure.
It seems that everything fell into place for this film. Barry Sonnenfeld's autumnal browns, oaks and reds set a frosty, evocative, elegant atmosphere. Nothing in his own films, as a director has ever looked so good. I consider Carter Burwell's score to be the second best ever written (after Ennio Morricone's The Mission). The haunting opening theme alone tells that this ""crime"" film is like no other. And a beautiful rendition of ""Danny Boy"" by Frank Patterson, that plays over the film's second best scene, was so memorable, that this violent scene which also reveals an unexpected dimension to the Leo character became known simply as the ""Danny Boy"" scene. Again the beauty of this rendition is in absolute opposition with the violence of the scene. The result is strangely majestic.
With a script of this quality I doubt that any actor would look bad, but all the actors shine, probably knowing that they would never again have an opportunity to utter suck needle-like words. Many of the words seem to be invented, with phrases like ""What's the rompus"" replacing the traditional hello, others seemed to be dug up from some really old detective novel, with words like ""twist"" meaning woman and ""schmada"" meaning guy. Even the secondary character such as The Dane gets to flex his vicious verbosity in an exchange such as this:
The Dane: Where is Leo?
Man lying on the floor: Why should I tell? You're going to kill me anyway.
The Dane: Because if you told me and you were lying, I wouldn't get to kill ya then.
Man lying on the floor: He's having a get together tomorrow at his whisky joint. Check it. It's gold.
The Dane: You know what buster. I believe you.
I don't think I need to point out what happens next.
Everytime I watch Miller's Crossing I love it a little more. It's a beautiful film to look at. It is sharp, gripping and absorbing from start to finish.

385711,1,6301963717,"I'm no Coen Brothers fan, so I watched this out of interest in  the actors. The first problem I had with it, however, was that everyone was so tight and emotionally closed down. Yes, I understand that's part of who these people need to be, but still it was the only time I have ever watched a movie *knowing* there was a director just out of camera range. I couldn't warm even to Albert Finney, a perennial favorite.
My big problem, however, was with the movie's use of violence and its connection to messages about manhood. (Spoilers) Part of the plot keys on the fact that the main character, Tom, doesn't commit a murder he's supposed to. In fact, he shows a spark of humanity and is merciful to a man begging for his life.
For the rest of the movie, Bernie, the reprieved man, is able to taunt Tom with his ""weakness,"" his unmanliness in showing mercy. In the end, when he kills Bernie, Tom vindicates his manhood. So the movie portrays the ability to kill without mercy as the  sign of true manhood; the ability to show even a spark of common humanity is a weakness.
This is a chilling message about what makes a real man, and what doesn't. It was boys with this kind of attitude who committed the massacre at Columbine. That is the price we pay for our society's worship of violence, and Hollywood's love affair with it.",975110400,9,1326,4.430327868852459

There is only one drawback to this  movie if you have never seen it before.  As they often do, the Coen  brothers make extensive use of dialects, something they did to wonderful  effect in Fargo.

Although seldom mentioned,  ""MILLER'S CROSSING"" must take its rightful place alongside the  above as one of the definitive treatments of gangster dynamics in American  Cinema.  I like to call it ""The Thinking Man's Mob Movie"" because  it's a film that requires one to really focus on the action and dialog and  not merely sit back in a lounger without attention span and wait for kill.  These characters are multi-faceted, the plot is complex and the payoff for  the viewer is delivered through outstanding cinematography (perhaps the  Coen's best!) and skillful pacing. Coupling their usual stable of actors  (Turturro, Buscemi, Polito) with veteran thespo Albert Finney, the  exquisitely laconic Gabriel Byrne, and femme-semi-fatale Marcia Gay Harden,  the Coen Brothers have assembled a truly great ensemble cast that  transcends the brutality and authenticity of the era.  Sure, there's great  kill!  In the good gangster pictures, violence is actually a character unto  itself, always lurking in the background until called upon to make a point.  In ""MILLER'S CROSSING"", the Coen Brothers seem to downplay the  actual mechanical violence by isolating the factors and sequences that are  responsible for it.  Betrayal and revenge are important themes in this  film.  The crisp writing makes the conversation between characters appear  effortless and uncontrived.  There's a certain casuality in the dialog that  belies the Coen's alarmingly accurate renderings of gangland execution.  Finally, the enjoyment one derives from viewing ""MILLER'S  CROSSING"" is not related to how much he/she understands the action or  knows about the mob lifestyle, but to the appreciation of the filmmaker's  art in communicating the brutality and fraternity of these individuals with  astonishing beauty and precision.",955411200,80,2014,5.456026058631922

I loved the visuals, and the dialogue is so good it hurts.  This is the most elegant film from  the Coen's.  It's also very funny.  The plentiful violence is some of the  best, most hilarious ever.",954806400,,326,4.5
385827,5,6301963717,"I honestly thought The Godfather movie was the only movie that had deception personified.  When I first rented Millers Crossing, I watched it over and over again.  I felt compelled to understand ""the code""  Tom so much believes in.  Whereas other mob movies have the  ""turncoat"" betray his boss, Tom stays loyal, even when he is  ousted.  I returned this movie past a week later.  It was so late... I  could have bought the movie outright.  I did not know then who the Coen  brothers were. From then... I have been a fan.  I have to say Millers  Crossing is my favorite movie to date.  I have worn out my VHS copy.  It is  a movie that will leave you confused, angry, mad happy, and rooting for the  bad guy as much as the good, because you don't want it to end.",953424000,2,762,4.253521126760563

Normally, you only see 2 or 3 or at most a handful of brilliant actors that stand out in any one movie.  Is it because the  movie had such a great script?  Is it because the directors did such a good  job?  etc.  etc...  or is it because all the actors really excelled in  their acting ability in this movie?  I can't tell.",948931200,2,421,4.15
385831,5,6301963717,"As it's chilly performances and aloof style put the audience at a distance, it's hard to see the first time through what a brilliant film this picture is; but repeated veiwings have only cemented my  opinion--Miller's Crossing is the finest American film since Raging Bull.
I think the key to my love for Miller's, though, is realizing what what  I believe the dream-hat meant (I'm sure this will be obvious to some,  especially those that have watched a number of times, but I just want to  throw this out there for folks that have seen it, but don't know what all  the hubbub is about--because certainly, that's how I felt when I first saw  it).
Whether people wear hats or not in the film seems to represent  whether they are acting out of passion-from the heart, that is, or out of  mind--thinking logically, or unemotionally.
Tom's conflict in the film is  entirely between his head and his heart(Verna).  He loses his hat to Verna  in a poker game, and he goes back to her apartment to get it--and it is  left on the sill while they fool around.  And Tom says about his dream:  ""There's nothing more foolish than a man chasing his hat.""  Ultimately, Tom chooses mind over heart in the end--or does he?  The final  shot shows him methodically putting his hat on so low that we can't even  see his eyes, so he seems to make the cold choice of pure logic--but then,  as he looks after Leo leaving (Leo, who has been hatless throughout, pure  emotion, has now learned something--and he is wearing a yarmulke), the  camera sneaks in under the brim of Tom's hat to see his eyes.  It is rare  for a movie to understand its character's so well.  Wonderful filmmaking",948585600,40,1664,4.525252525252525
385832,5,6301963717,"When I first saw this movie I got lost and didn't get it.  My friend assured me ""just watch it again, it's great"".  So about a year later I watched it again and it was like watching a different movie.  I  payed very close attention and started to get wrapped up in the complex yet  intriging story.  Yet after the second viewing I still wasn't completly  convinced that I had followed it to a tee.  So I watched it again a couple  of nights later.  Wow!  It seemed to get better and better everytime I  watched it.  And after the 3rd or 4th viewing I felt I had gotten all there  was to get.  It is now, my favorite movie of all time.  You could see how  this movie got snubbed at the Academy awards, especially when 'Goodfellas'  and the 'Godfather 3' were out the same year.  All the Academy members  couldn't follow it the first time either I guess. But it is truely a better  movie than both of the two traditional mob films mentioned.  Far more  original and stylish.  This movie is so good, that the Academy of motion  pictures owes the Coen brothers a formal appology for over looking what is  clearly their best work and one of the best films of the decade.  My only  question is when is it coming out on DVD?",947635200,8,1217,4.219298245614035
385833,5,6301963717,"I agree with the bulk of previous reviewers' positive comments about this movie; I couldn't really add much that hasn't already been said.  However, it's a shame that, as far as I can tell, Gabriel Byrne wasn't nominated for  any acting awards for his role here.  In fact, at least in the IMDB  listings, the only role he's EVER been nominated for (which he won) is some  TV appearance in the 70's.  This guy's a great actor who's been in a number  of excellent films.  His style is completely unaffected, never a  distraction, and a pleasure to watch, MILLER'S CROSSING certainly being no  exception.  Would you have wanted anyone else to play Keaton in USUAL  SUSPECTS?  Come on...give this guy an award!",947203200,,706,4.688524590163935
385930,5,6301963717,"Although it's difficult to think of another film that is like Millers Crossing, a lot of people are blinkered when they say it's the best Movie ever. Is it a better Sci-Fi movie than Close Encounters or is it a better  comedy than Blazing Saddles ? However, having said that it is simply my  favourite film of all time of any genre. It's class oozes from every scene  - I can only reiterate the comments from most others  : Its dialogue,  performances, plot, look and imagery has never been surpassed. You need to  watch it at least 3 times before it all falls into place - the first time  you watch it you may find yourself lost now and again as the story is  multi-layered. therefore, first time you watch it just enjoy the visuals  and the feel of the dialogue and characters, Then watch it again with the  rewind button ready to go over all of the pivital moments (there are many)  and finally watch it again and simply bathe in the excellence of it all. As  someone else said in another review I noticed - take the phone off the  hook, tell everyone to shut-up and pay attention. You will thank yourself  afterwards as the more I think about it and remember it as I'm writing  this, I realise that everyone was in fact probably right - It IS the Best  movie Ever Made !  My all time favourite Movie - make it yours.",947203200,6,1320,4.300813008130081

What's  Tom going to do next?  Does he even know?",947030400,,391,4.4714285714285715
385932,5,6301963717,"Yes, FARGO won lots of awards, and sure, RAISING ARIZONA isuproariously funny, but make no mistake: MILLER'S CROSSING is thequintessential Coen brothers film.  In point of fact, it's flawless, a jewel you can turn over and around in your hands again and again, seeing a new facet every time, each one striking and smooth and perfect.
The script is awash with Prohibition-era jargon both historically grounded and whimsically invented, a symphony of phrases and exchanges that linger and echo long after being heard.  (It isn't unusual after a viewing to walk around asking friends, ""What's the rumpus?"", or to complain about being given ""the high hat"" upon being snubbed.)
The performances, as well, are individually and collectively irresistable.  I defy you, in fact, to find a single film in which _any_ of the major players has ever been better.  There's not a false or miscast note in the whole of the dramatis personae.  There's Gabriel Byrne as the inscrutable, Machiavellian Tom Reagan, a trusted advisor to the city's Irish mob lord who falls out of favor and ""defects"" to the Italian camp to save his own skin...or does he?  Albert Finney plays Leo, the aforementioned Irish power broker whose fists of iron, vicious survival instinct, and all-too-vulnerable heart congeal into a simply remarkable, unforgettable character.  John Turturro is equal parts pathetic outcast and conniving opportunist as Bernie Birnbaum, the unscrupulous, vampirically pale bookmaker whose shady maneuvers set the whole plot into motion.  Marcia Gay Harden exudes fierce intelligence and buckets of carefully-aimed sex appeal as Bernie's sister Verna, whose unflagging drive to protect her brother -- even from himself -- almost excuse her twisted machinations.  J.E. Freeman drips evil and impending violence all over the screen as smarter-than-you-want-him-to-be enforcer Eddie Dane.  Jon Polito, as hot-tempered Italian ringleader Johnny Caspar, may be the only character at hand to actually feel sorry for, as his oddly consistent ethical code makes it a sure bet he doesn't stand a chance in his environment.
There's more to say about the acting, of course, but I'll stop there rather than pour accolades onto the entire cast.  And when I say ""entire,"" I'm not exaggerating: every person who comes into frame, from the leads to the smaller parts to the people with one line or none at all, fit together and play off of each other as though they'd been born to do nothing else in their entire lives. The whole of it actually makes it difficult not to notice acting and casting problems in other films.
I'm running out of room here, so I can only nod to some of the other perfect elements of production. Barry Sonnenfeld's dead-on photography is measured and seamless where appropriate, frenetic where necessary.  Set design and costuming make for such an astonishing illusion that were this not a color film, you might actually forget that it was released 9, not 69 years ago.  And even the sound -- from the music (diegetic and otherwise) to the crystal-clear sound effects that pierce the visual and draw you in by the ears, like they're supposed to -- is a _presence_ in its own right throughout the film.  I mean, when was the last time ice cubes dropping into an old-fashioned glass or the wringing out of an alcohol-soaked rag into a tinny dish felt truly woven into the designed effect of a scene in a movie?
What continues to amaze me about MILLER'S CROSSING is that no matter how many times I see it, regardless of how hard I look, I _can't find anything wrong with it_. That's an extremely rare situation in my experience.  It's what we all want out of a movie, and almost never get.  MILLER'S CROSSING delivers exactly that feeling, and when Tom Reagan leans against that tree and adjusts that hat in the haunting final shot, he knows it just as surely as we do.  He doesn't seem to feel especially happy about it, but that's okay.  _You_ will.",946944000,226,3948,4.929110105580694
385933,5,6301963717,"Directing, acting and script are unsurpassable. This is the best work ever made by the Coen Brothers. All the actors give the perfomances of their careers (specially Byrne and Turturro). Dialogues are fascinating.  Mesmerising. Only Tarantino can match them. This movie is about friendship  and loyalty; about love and integrity; about greed and deception. As one  character says, it's about ethics. The key is Byrne, his moral ambiguity,  and the choices he has to take in the course of the action: the way they  are presented (and not explained) make this movie a masterwork, a true  classic.",946857600,,594,5.072164948453608

Then Byrne gets invovled with trying to protect Verna's brother,  John Turturo, from both sides, all while trying to remain loyal to Finney.  This is a smartly written and superbly acted film.

Gabriel  Byrne and John Tuturro are two of the finest actors  never to be nominated  for an Oscar and they both deserved it for their work in this film.
