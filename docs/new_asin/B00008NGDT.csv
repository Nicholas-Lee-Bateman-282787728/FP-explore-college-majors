Annabeth Gish, whom we all should know from the Cult TV series ""The X-files"" does a really good job in her role of ""Marissa Kiley"". I'm a great fan of her and I recommend this movie to everyone who likes her liek I do!",1054425600,,369,4.138888888888889
1854056,4,B00008NGDT,"Great Movie. Okay title. Chick flick from a guys point of view...
Pursuit of Happiness is one of those movies that your girlfriend tells you she caught on a late night cable channel and makes you watch it on your night off.  But the great thing about this movie is that you'll actually identify with what the film's lead character Allen (Frank Whaley).  This movie has all the great dating faux pas and lessons.  The most important of which is how to turn your gal pal into your girlfriend.  Pursiut of Happiness is a chick flick, without a doubt, but most guys will come to love it.",1053820800,,583,4.420560747663552

1854104,5,B00008NGDT,"Pursuit of Happiness is a 2001 film classified as a romantic comedy. There is more to it than that. A fellow whose choice of women and an ability to relate to them calls to mind the role of Allen Felix in Play It Again, Sam. Various encounters are not only mismatches but there is difficulty in establishing meaningful relationships. All this is in pursuit of happiness. And all the folks in this film of both sexes are also in the same pursuit, one way or the other.
Curiously, the protagonist in this film, Allen (Frank Whitley) has a longtime friendship with a childhood companion, as an adult, Marissa (Annabeth Gish), which aside from a brief intimate relationship during high school, has been platonic on the surface. In reality and over time, Marissa has come to love Allen. He of course is oblivious to her feelings. Each of  them over the years, has been able to use each other when anxiety-provoking situations in life arise, either romantically (Marissas marriage on the rocks; Allens relationships end up sending his girlfriend to his colleagues beds). In essence, what Allen and Marissa have been doing over the years is learning to accept, respect, understand, and support each other. In essence it is a desirable rather extended premarital courting that experts tell us is antecedent to a stable and enduring marriage.
Marissas marriage is on the rocks; her husband has had an extramarital affair, and as it turns out, with one of Allens latest live-ins. Concurrently, Allen lands a terrific job in Seattle (They are in LA). Because of their close platonic relationship, Allen volunteers to have her make the decision about whether he should accept the new position but she declines to take the responsibility. At the final send off packing in his apartment, they trade sexual histories at her insistence. It turns out he was her first relationship which he did not know at the time. He kisses her, she declines a relationship. He leaves LA.
Six months go by, each desperately miss each other. Fortunately at a mutual friends wedding they meet; he as the best man, she as the matron of honor. Before the wedding, Allen has an epiphany: he has grown up and realizes he loves Marissa and wants to marry her. He accosts her in front of the brides dressing room and tells her. She replies she gave up on the relationship A long time ago. He says give it another chance. The wedding proceeds. And if you're into the movie, I will not spoil the very poignant ending, but suffice it to say, (if you're a softie, get the Kleenex.) it appears they find happiness.
The acting was excellent but I would also give credit to the director for the success of this movie.",1446508800,,2670,4.7296137339055795

1854137,4,B00008NGDT,"This movie is not perfect.  It's slow in places, the pacing is uneven and occasional events are thrown in that seem like they should have significance, but it ends up that they don't.

However, the last 40 to 50 minutes of the movie make it all worthwhile.  The chemistry between the two leads is quite good and the last half of the movie has several one-on-one scenes with them where there is a slow and effective build up to the eventual happy conclusion.

What raises this above the typical romantic comedy fare is Annabeth Gish's performance.  Early in her career she had a number of roles where she played smart, warm, sensitive young women and played them perfectly.  Her character in this film (Marissa) is something of a grown up version of those earlier characters.  Her face conveys an array of emotions effortlessly and convincingly.  There are a couple scenes near the end when Frank Whaley's character (Alan), unexpected by her, expresses his feelings.  The expressions of surprise and happiness on her face as this occurs are perfect.  And in what seems like a minor thing, but isn't something I've seen an actor do very often, her breathing changes subtly, but noticeably during those emotional reactions as well.

It's a warm movie.  Alan and Marissa have several good friends who would do just about anything for them.  But it's the friendship and buildup to something more between the two main characters that makes this a truly feel-good movie.",1391472000,6,1463,4.850806451612903

1854139,4,B00008NGDT,"This is a sweet movie. About a nice nerdy guy. He is blessed to have a lot of friends and a best friend. He goes on a sweet journey of personal growth. If you like or need a ""feel good pick me up"" movie this movie is right for you. After you watched the movie you end up feeling...well should I say it...happy.",1376438400,9,310,3.9365079365079363
1854140,4,B00008NGDT,"If I had come across this movie on the shelf at the video store, I would have not just passed it by but avoided it overtly. It has the stupidest DVD cover ever. Which is ironic considering the lead character's line of work.

I gave it a chance for a couple of reasons. For one, I am always searching for the ultimate Annabeth Gish vessel, and for two, it had a solid romantic premise.

Regarding point number one, this is, in my opinion, definately the ""one."" As you may recall, Annabeth had a few hits in the 80s and then kind of fell off the map, fame-wise, after that. It's an absolute shame, really.

The fact is, she is brilliant at what she does -- heart rending emotions and gleaming charm. She does not disappoint in this movie. Her character is constantly making you want to reach through the screen and hug her. Thankfully she has her best friend of many years to do that for us. And for that perfect reason, this movie has officially ascended to one of my favorites - certainly within the ranks of Annabeth Gish's filmography.

If you can look past the annoying characterization of Amy Jo Johnson's role, the movie is absolutely worth at least one viewing, if not several.",1177113600,5,1183,4.462962962962963
1854141,1,B00008NGDT,"I like romantic comedies in general, even some that I recognize as being formulaic, but I didn't like this movie.  The weaknesses were immediately apparent--awkward dialogue, lack of visual style--but I hoped the movie would overcome its faults.  It didn't.  Unlike, for example, Wedding for Bella, which had some similar shortcomings and obvious outcomes, this movie never made me care about the lead characters--they were two-dimensional sketches rather than fleshed-out characters.  I liked Amy Jo Johnson, although being a 30-year-old playing ""the teenager"" suggests a reason for her undistinguished career, and I liked Liz Vassey who was also relaxed in her character rather than awkwardly acting a part.  Otherwise, nothing to see here. Move along.",1149811200,12,754,5.521739130434782

She is a talented, beautiful and smart actress. It seems to be a simple romantic movie but it is much more than that. The perfect atmosphere of the movie can make you feel a lot of different emotions. It shows me a lot of truth that I was not aware of. It shows that the job, money, carrer and things like that are not really important. The important thing is to aware of the day, love the day, seize the day and just be happy because there are somebody around you that loves you whatever you are or you will become.
