8489269,1,B005YG4ZNS,"This ""Educational Video"" perpetuates the liberal stereotype of all white people as evil, spoiled elitist who've only achieved what they have because the complexion of their skin.  Furthermore, it uses Jesus and God incorrectly and disgracefully to further its ""White Privilege"" agenda, going so far as to say ""Jesus wants you free"" claiming that He wants you to be free from the lie in society that White Privilege doesn't exist.  When in turn, when used in correct context, Jesus means that He wants people to be free from sin.  In addition, this film gives the intention that All White People think Jesus is white (Grossly incorrect) then  ""conveniently"" doesn't attribute this stereotype to any other race. In conclusion, aside from the mediocre acting and outdated, it slams Christianity, white people and perpetuates racial tension.
