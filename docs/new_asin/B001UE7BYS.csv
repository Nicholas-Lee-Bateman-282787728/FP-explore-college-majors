8343452,1,B001UE7BYS,"I should have listened to the reviewers of the other similar DVD and not bought this.

The poses REALLY are individual.  Yes, you can sequence them, but it doesn't work.  There is no flow.  There is all this crap -- name of pose and what it does before EACH pose begins!  Then, more bad, at the end of EACH pose, she says Namaste.  How many time can you see this and hear this before it drives you insane -- and this is supposed to be a practice to reduce stress?!

Okay, big question:  Has ANYONE who was part of creating this DVD TRIED practicing to it?  I don't think so.  If they did, they would have figured out that it doesn't work.

At the very least they could have eliminated the Namaste and the pose name and information.

I am SO disappointed because it's beautifully shot.  The music is awesome.  The people involved in the practice are terrific.  Her voice is perfect.  If all that wasn't so exceptional, I would not feel so extremely disappointed.  Boo!",1433376000,2,967,4.403409090909091
8343453,5,B001UE7BYS,I take restorative yoga classes four times a week.  I do something from this video the other three.  Does that tell you enough?  Thank you Laura Hawes!,1422835200,,151,4.518518518518518
8343454,5,B001UE7BYS,"I mostly do flow yoga, but like a lot of people, probably benefit at least as much from relaxation and stress relief than I do from exercise.  This DVD is perfect when I am not feeling like doing much of a workout.  The DVD contains quite of few different sequences for different purposes (health & beauty, anxiety, anger, depression, etc.).  None of them are hard to do, even the ""fitness"" routine.  If you are looking for exercise, this is not the DVD for you.

I like Laura Hawes' calming voice, and the scenery/settings are also very calming.  There is more instruction on this than I need, but this DVD would be just fine for a beginner.  If you are like me and own quite a few yoga DVDs, this one won't be a whole lot like the others in your collection.  In any case, ""Yoga Therapy for Stress Relief"" is a sound purchase and it will complement anyone's yoga DVD collection.",1297987200,5,879,4.416149068322981
