8072412,5,B000A2EKVS,I have purchased several of the Standard Deviants dvd's for my children to supplement their school. I didn't just get it for the SAT. The Standard Devient presentation is very entertaining and the student enjoys learning.  My older children had the Standard Devient programs and they said that so much of what they learned was helpful on the SAT test.,1366675200,,351,4.85
8072413,1,B000A2EKVS,"I just checked this out from the library hoping to improve my child's writing.  The video gives steps and strategies on how to write an essay but gives NO EXAMPLES AT ALL!  It is just energetic young people telling the camera (or you the audience) the steps and strategies.  These are the correct steps and strategies, but without examples, the strategies are too abstract for a young student.",1309737600,,393,4.75
