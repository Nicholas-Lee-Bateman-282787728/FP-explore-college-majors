8322983,5,B001N2WJ4E,"Love this second part of the mini series, though this one was little darker in that you finally realized just how the whole two collections were interconnected. Still, it was one the best collections I have seen yet. Totally recommend...",1433980800,,237,4.95
8322984,5,B001N2WJ4E,"Mahoro is a retired combat android. She has a little over a year left in her operational life span. She decides to spend it helping people. She takes a job as a live in maid for a middle school boy named Suguru. She quickly works her way into his heart with her devotion and pure intentions. They become very close and overcome many challenges. A sexy teacher who has her eye on Suguru is always trying to split them up, an old enemy returns to settle the score with Mahoro, and Mahoro's impending fate weighs heavy on her heart. Despite these trials, their bond remains strong. Thye may be able to overcome any challenge together, but what will happen when her life span comes to an end?

This is a great anime. It is very similar to Steel Angel Kurumi. It also has a bit of a Love Hina, and Girls Bravo mood about it. I personally like it better than Kurumi, and Love Hina. The animation is pretty good, there are lots of great characters. The voice acting, and soundtrack are also very decent. My favorite part about this show is the many different genres it spans. There is action, comedy, drama, and romance. This show has a very sweet love story going on, but there is also a lot of nudity and pervy stuff thrown in there. This show has everything. I can't believe that I just found out about it by accident. It's over 10 years old. I'm very glad I discovered Maharomatic. I think any mature anime fan can find something to love here.",1353196800,,1440,4.373134328358209
8322985,3,B001N2WJ4E,"It was interesting to see how things played out, but the last episode left a feeling of confusion and disconnection. *spoiler* It takes place 20 years later with Suguru all grown up and on another planet. Mahoro is brought back with what seems to be her conciousness being used to form her existence again. She looks the same and still has her memories. But there is way too much time that has passed and you never get to fully understand what the past few years has been like. It just seems like the last episode was thrown together. :/ Then the weird stuff said in the credits tends to confuse things even more. And the ova episode just leaves a weird feeling.",1350345600,,662,4.434426229508197
8322986,4,B001N2WJ4E,I enjoyed this Anime collection very much. You can find other reviews that will tell you all you could want to know about the story and content. So in summation it was amusing and enjoyable.,1253577600,,190,4.457142857142857
8322987,4,B001N2WJ4E,"This collection was a really good find to me. It takes the original series does away with some of the overused fan service and tries to focus more on the story at hand. The entire thing was just greatness, a 5 star easy, but the ending just seemed to work out too perfectly for my taste. There was just something at the end that threw off the whole logical emotional response. !!SPOILER!! It would've been better if Mahoro hadn't returned. But I tend to like scarred characters better anyway!!SPOILER!!",1239840000,,502,4.651685393258427
