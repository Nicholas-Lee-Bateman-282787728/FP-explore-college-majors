The fact that it made out to be like it stars kurupt, it goes the opposite way and only features the rapper in a few scenes. When I first got this I was very excited to chill with my boys and view it, but that went down the drian. Don't get me wrong it has it's moments and if you are a die hard kurupt fan like my self you will no doubt buy it. But I woundn't recommend it to many people.",1097107200,3,483,3.792079207920792
7949249,1,B00005OSLV,"It very rarely gets any worse than this lousy low-budget straight-to-video urban comedy featuring Dogg Pound Gangsta, Kurupt, in his first ""starring"" role. Fact is Kurupt is only shown in about three or four sequences and the rest of the film is about a studio executive's daughter who steals her rapper boyfriend's master recordings and heads out to California to find him. Along the way, she meets up with a nerdy but romantic wannabe poet. Even Tiny Lister, who is usually always pretty good in his roles, can't save this garbage.",1077926400,,533,4.868131868131868
