1330770,4,B00003CXMV,"It's really  not necessary to follow the confused and confusing plot. Action is the key to the entertainment value and there is plenty of that, mostly well done. All you need know is that Snipes is a good guy no matter how things look and so is Maury Chaykin,  playing a subordinate role with real style. The young woman interpreter with glasses is a good guy too, but everyone else is suspect: some of these others are good guys, some are bad guys and some turn out to be simply background for the action. While occasionally both those playing good and those playing bad guys are a bit too over-stereotyped in their performances, on the whole, the cast handle themselves with a fair degree of constraint, when not shooting, bombing and committing mayhem in the interest of their various causes.
Snipes is the key to the success of the movie. He makes the action far from boring and does well in other  aspects of the role as required.
In all, a no-brainer with a sufficiently interesting plot and set of characters, to create an adequate backdrop to vigorous action. A good movie to watch when you just want to relax and forget the news of the day you just saw.",1379376000,,1162,4.523809523809524

1330773,5,B00003CXMV,"This movie is a great fun, action-filled thriller. Wesley races against time and his on people ( the law) to catch a murder only to find out.... can he survive?

1330774,3,B00003CXMV,"""The Art of War"" was Wesley Snipes' first film following a two-year break from Hollywood and his first starring vehicle since&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blade/dp/0780624890/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blade</a>. Disappointingly, it was made during the height of Hollywood's superficially glossy period and was treated as such by most viewers, therein becoming one of Snipes' larger flops at the time. Nevertheless, it holds some appeal to me that critics tend to overlook, and after a steady diet of Snipes' direct-to-video output, this looks fine by comparison. This isn't a movie for people who like Wesley for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/New-Jack-City/dp/6305047480/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">New Jack City</a>, but casual action-thriller aficionados ought to enjoy it with some popcorn.

The story: An undercover operative (Snipes) is framed for the murder of a Chinese ambassador during the crafting of an important trade agreement between the UN and China. Now, he must sift through a web of betrayal to find the real culprits.

This film thinks it's cleverer than it actually is. You can see the inevitable twists coming from a mile away, and even though it's trying to be politically relevant, it feels shallow. That said, if you can enjoy isolated moments, director Christian Duguay (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Joan-of-Arc/dp/B00000JS6F/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Joan of Arc</a>) manages some good scenes of pop drama and Snipes delivers a serviceable acting performance. Where other actors are concerned, I liked Maury Chaykin (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nero-Wolfe/dp/B000CRR3CE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nero Wolfe</a>) as Wesley's ally but was disappointed that Cary Tagawa (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mortal-Kombat/dp/0790729997/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mortal Kombat</a>) and James Hong (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Big-Trouble-in-Little-China/dp/B000QUCQX8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Big Trouble in Little China</a>) are stuck with small roles and aren't afforded much action.

Speaking of action, the movie isn't brimming with it but what's there is generally good. What attracted me to the film was the involvement of Ron Yuan as fight choreographer, yet his services are only utilized for two scenes: the surprisingly nifty brawl in the beginning of the movie and (SPOILER) the eventual showdown with Michael Biehn's (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Aliens/dp/B00012FXAE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Aliens</a>) character, which sounds like it should suck but is actually pretty decent. There are a couple chase scenes, but these fall victim to overzealous editing. For example, in pursuing an assassin, Snipes slides down the handrails of a staircase, but all we see is him mounting the rails before a cutaway shot and a jump cut to him at the bottom of the stairs. Seriously, Chris Duguay - if you're going to put a stunt like that in the movie, at least actually show it, huh?

The movie won more than a bit of acclaim for its art direction and cinematography, and I have to admit that the picture is a fairly aesthetic one if you overlook the dated computer graphics. This won't save the movie for someone who's decided they already don't like it, so know yourself before making a purchase. If nothing else, know that only a half-decade later, Wesley would be doing junk like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Marksman/dp/B000A1OFYQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Marksman</a>, and this one will probably seem better by comparison.",1345507200,,3804,6.741344195519348

1330776,5,B00003CXMV,"Short and sweet, this was a great movie.  Snipes played the part straight. None of the phony James Bond, Steven Seagal, Schwarzenegger, Sylvester Stallone...overacting or even impossible feats. The story flowed smoothly, lots of actions, but a little to much cold blooded murder by the bad guys but the characters they played were real and identifiable . You could feel the emotion Snipes was feeling about what is wrong with what he was paid to do and his job.  Great fight scenes and a good logically possible ending and just the right amount of teasing nude scenes.",1321228800,,568,4.845360824742268
1330777,5,B00003CXMV,"this movie? the ending w/ bad guy vs. good guy save the girl is standard hollywood - the rest is unique. I guess since it does not go totally hollywood formula some are downgading it (good women are actually at risk in this movie, the babe doesn't go full frontal or sleep w/ the hero, I suspect these two things are why its being given low marks)---or maybe its so good people are downgrading it to pump up other movies. Anyway, this is a very good action flick. Very good plot, twists, story line w/o holes, good chemistry among characters",1303603200,,541,4.42
1330778,5,B00003CXMV,This is a pretty good movie i enjoyed it alot. i was really impressed with wesley snipes's performance. this was a good movie,1291334400,,125,4.478260869565218
1330779,5,B00003CXMV,"Well first off let me start by saying I don't care what people say about the movie or Snipes, it was a great movie. For those who think different, they didn't really see the movie or botherd to take a look at the time frame of when it was created. I have seen almost all of Wesley's action films but this one is the best to date next to blade. From the suspence to the martial art action sequences, Snipes delivers. When watching the movie I understood exactly what was going on just by the actions of the characters alone. He worked for the UN and was setup by the UN is the whole story in a nut shell but the trip taking to find out the truth makes the movie worth watching. If your looking for some action that involves a twist of Martial arts and spy technology this is one film to add to your list. I only wish Wesley Snipes can bring that much energy and more in his films over the next few years(if of course he dosen't go to jail).",1258675200,,939,4.081081081081081
1330780,5,B00003CXMV,"If you liked Art of War II, you need to see this one--not BETTER, but just as good. Lots of great action and unexpected twists with a very satisfactory ending. Don't hesitate to try this one.",1246838400,,191,4.333333333333333
1330781,1,B00003CXMV,"I fast forwarded through most of the movie to get to the confirmation of who I knew were the ""bad guys"", which I had figured out in the first five minutes. The most annoying part of the movie is the voice of the main Asian female character. I swear it was like a bad voice over of a Japanese film! They used every cliche in the book - double crossing partners, sympathetic but hardened NY cop, a visit to the seedy mafia underbelly, etc. Skip it.",1245715200,,446,4.1976744186046515
1330782,4,B00003CXMV,"First of all the average for this movie is outrageous. 2 and 1/2 stars for The Art Of War? Have you guys ever seen The Marksman? If you've seen that disaster then you've seen Wesley's worst movie. A three and 1/2 star average would be more realistic. Then again I tend to forget the bandwagoneers that I'm dealing with. These are the same pseudo-intellectuals that bash Crank Yankers for not having a plot not realizing that a show consisting of muppets and crank calls is not supposed to have a plot! At any rate....

Story: Neil Shaw is a special operatives agent for the U.N. His life takes a turn for the worst when he is framed for a murder of a political leader. From then on he searches for clues to who the real killer is along with a reluctant female accomplice(played by Marie Matiko).

I know that the movie has flaws and I'm aware that at times the story tends to get convoluted and drags a bit but I still like this movie. I cant help what I entertained by and I was entertained with this movie. Wesley was good as Neil Shaw and so was Michael Biehn(who looks a twin brother of Joe Pantoliano) is good as an associate turned enemy as well as Anne Archer. Look, this movie was meant to be a popcorn flick and on that level it succeeds. The action scenes are stylish and well choreographed and the story has holes and tends to be confusing sometimes. Its a trade off that I can live with. I've had more fun watching this movie than most of the overrated blockbusters of recent. If you can look past this movie's flaws and enjoy it for what it is then cool. If not why waste your time?",1244592000,,1595,4.295681063122924
1330783,5,B00003CXMV,I'm watching this movie on tnt channel right now and ....WOW! Crazy-Great Movie!! Wesley is at his BEST with ACTION films. This is a GOTTA Have Dvd for sure!!!,1189900800,,159,4.517241379310345
1330784,1,B00003CXMV,"The best thing about this movie is the poster, which recalls the posters of the thrillers of the '70s.

The second best thing is the trailer, which makes it seem silly, but a little fun, like a cheap thrill.

You'll observe that neither the poster nor the trailer are actually IN the movie.

This movie is worse than just bad, but not bad in an even somewhat amusing way. This is the most poorly directed movie I have ever seen. There is no point of view, there is no logic, there is no rhythm or momentum. Every cut is jarring, every angle thoughtless.

I respect Wesley for taking control and producing his own films, but he's gotta do better than this. If he just had a better director (and a script wouldn't hurt) a lot of the glaring problems of this movie would be less visible. Actors who are not so clearly bottom of the bargain barrel would help, too.

But special mention has to go to Anne Archer. She's always been awful, but she reaches new lows here. The most ridiculous thing is that she's supposed to be in charge of this super high-level espionage unit, and she's about as savvy and sophisticated as an Iowa housewife who's watched one episode of Martha Stewart. And the worst part is: she tends to sound a little drunk when she's just trying to speak normally. Talk about a weak link.

Wesley, how bout producing a nice romantic comedy with yourself? Or take your time and seek out a really decent script. Or just take time to... find yourself.

And as for you, dear reader, you do not want to see this movie. You really, really don't. Just look at the cool poster.

And keep hoping the Blade series gets back on track.",1181260800,,1636,4.411960132890365
1330785,4,B00003CXMV,I enjoyed this movie. It is a shame that his persona gives a bad impression. This was a pretty good dvd for under $10. Decent story just enough violence that you and your girlfriend/wife can watch without flinching.,1181001600,,215,4.684210526315789
1330786,4,B00003CXMV,"'The Art of War' starring Wesley Snipes is a superior action/adventure tale about an international conspiracy involving United Nations ""One World Insiders"", the FBI, high level Chinese politicians and Asian Triad gangs. Neil Shaw (Wesley Snipes) is a U.N. secret agent caught in the middle of a growing mystery which seems centered around the arrival of an important Chinese Ambassador and his entourage in New York.

Also involved is a lovely Chinese national named Julia Fang (Marie Matiko) who appears marked for death by both Triad and U.N. factions. Agent Neil becomes Julia's only means of survival as the two work together to stay alive and reveal the conspirators. As the action builds towards a climax and the dead bodies pile up they both become increasingly aware that the conspiracy rises to the highest eschalons of international politics.

A highly entertaining film with lots of suspense and a great cast; Wesley Snipes, Marie Matiko, James Hong, Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa, Donald Sutherland, Anne Archer and Michael Biehn.",1150070400,,1033,5.254545454545455
1330787,3,B00003CXMV,"This is a typical hollywood movie, in both good and bad way. First, the budget is big, the premise thought provoking, and the actions scenes well directed. Those are the good parts.

The bad includes the casting: wesley snipes is black, his boss is female, his love interest is an asian diplomat w a nose ring, and his sidekick a cop who while theoretically italian is obviously jewish and speaks in yinglish. More hollywood postive discrimination than you can shake a stick at. Also the plot totally sucks, and is best disregarded (altho the concerns about china and so forth are interesting, the way things play out is completely hokey). All in all worth seeing, but not a must see by any means. I wouldn't pay full price, if I were you... (I bought it used).",1136160000,,761,4.595588235294118

Wesley Snipes once again plays the hero, this time a covert U.N. agent, who sets out to prevent the assassination of a Chinese leader who is at the UN To sign a historic trade agreement.

This is an espionage, spy thriller with Snipes as a U.N. security agent.  The plot centers around a conspiracy to thwart American-Chinese trade negotiations.  There are double & triple crosses galore & this film has the feel of an updated film-noir classic, MTV style.

1330793,1,B00003CXMV,"I've seen some bad movies.  Some horrible movies in fact, but nothing, absolutely nothing, as bad as this.  This is the result if you take bad editing, stolen scenes, and no plot and throw money at it.
From the beginning where Neil Shaw (Wesley Snipes) gets in a fight at a major event and the event ""never happened"" to the public to the scene where a sniper kills a major diplomat at a major U.N. event.  Does no one have security details in these things?
His intuition of bombs in backpacks and the events that happened in the translators apartment are also quite unbelievable.  If he's that talented shouldn't he be working for Ms. Cleo instead of risking his butt?
The ending to this movie is a direct rip off of ""The Matrix"", unfortunately neither of the characters are superheroes so it comes off as ridiculous.

1330796,3,B00003CXMV,"The Art of War is a stylish action film that trys too hard to follow the trend and style of recent blockbusters.  The actions are mostly reminisant of John Woo films (such as Hard Boiled, Face Off, or Mission Impossible 2).  For the most part, they are fairly good if un-inspired.  The climax however is simply atrocious.  It's an utter (...) of the last gun-fight in the Matrix with both men dodging bullets right and left.  Aside from being a rather tired (...), it simply doesn't work.  The characters don't posses any supernatural powers and so it's really hard to buy that they are dodging bullets.
Another problem is the films awful plot.  For some reason, the Wesley Snipes character seems to have ESP.  In one scene, he comes into a room where his partner had been beaten and murdered.  Then, just by looking at the room, he sees everything replay in his head.  In another scene, the character sees some guy coming out of a resturant.  He notices that the asian guys is carrying a back-pack.  He then drives through the resurant, grabs the back-pack, and throws it out the window where upon it explodes.  Talk about police intuition (or maybe all asian guys carry bombs).  As before, this wouldn't be a problem if the character actually had ESP but it's just kind of dumb here.",1005091200,,1285,4.60352422907489
1330797,2,B00003CXMV,"Maury Chaykin is the only redeeming thing this movie has to offer, hence the two stars. Maury Chaykin played Nero Wolfe in A&E's adaptation of Rex Stout's THE GOLDEN SPIDERS. He was astonishingly good as the neurotic Wolfe, and made a tepid story-line a fascinating watch.
In the abysmal ART OF WAR, Maury Chaykin hilariously plays a droll FBI agent, and relays the surreality of this farce of a movie by having a great time in his character. He alone is the only reason to watch this movie; his is a class act performance in relation to the rest of the poorly conceived and executed movie.
THE ART OF WAR pretentiously tries to adopt some of Sun Tzu's maxims, but coming at the end of a goofy flick, one is more embarrassed by their employ than anything else. Although this movie is really about watching Wesley Snipes wander around vandalizing things and beating people up, they could at least have attempted to gin up a less shabby premise.
Anyone who reads a newspaper will be totally bemused by the sorry devices parsed out as intellegient geopolitics. First of all, the United Nations does not negotiate trade treaties, does not have anything to do with the North and South Korean negotiations, and certainly does not mediate bilateral trade agreements between China and the United States. Second of all, the UN is a factionalized, marginally coherent entity that can barely keep its own paperwork in order, let alone conduct supersecret covert operations with a bunch of silly sassy spies. It'd take everyone about two seconds to find out about it, and the UN Security Council members would promptly jail any UN Secretary General that tried anything that stupid. This movie presents a total misunderstanding of what the UN does and how it is organized. Thirdly, any prominent Chinese businessman that can buy and sell hotels on a whim would hardly jeopardize his position with a bunch of small-patatoes sweat-shops and smuggling operations. Fourthly, any diabolically ""clever"" conspiracy would hardly be based on the ham-handed right-wing politics that are demonized in this movie. There is also a total misunderstanding of elite policy perspectives in the US. The attempt to frame this movie as politically adept because it so blatantly advocates UN supremacy certainly does can't get around the fact that the political subtext is presented so atrociously.
All of this makes the formulaic plot, underwhelming action scenes, and embarrassingly banal premise the ingredients of a movie that should never, ever have been made. It's no wonder that this movie has elicited nothing from the world but a collective yawn.",1005004800,,2621,5.013761467889908

1330803,5,B00003CXMV,I loved the action scenes in this one. The political apects in this movie were a little heavy handed; however the fight scenes in this one made it worth watching. I think that with a little better writing this character could be much better than the James Bond franchise ...like the title of the movie company that produced this film...Franchise.  Bond films have really gotten into the formula..too much so to have any suspense or surprise in them any more.,1001289600,,458,4.725
1330804,2,B00003CXMV,"This movie is a rip-off of many other action movie...It felt like a little bit of Mission Impossible with a pinch of Enemy of the State thrown in.  Wesley Snipes stars as a U.N. spy, a very typical character in these James Bond style movies of one man takes on dozens, and wins.  The plot is as difficult to follow as it is thin.  The film centers around the concept that the U.N. is trying to build itself up as a major world power by framing people for the assasinations of heads of state.  The movie does not spend enough time to develop this plot and thus leaves the viewer distracted from the action.  Throughout the movie, you are presented with a small list of people for the ""who-done-it"" style ending, which I'm sorry to say was very predictable.  Overall, this film is worth watching on cable, but I personally would not pay the money to rent or buy it.",996796800,,863,4.3625
1330805,2,B00003CXMV,"Marie Matiko is the only positive in this film filled with misused talent. Donald Sutherland, who is usually a master at adding spice and roguish subtlety to the characters he portrays cannot find a single hook in this ... script on which to hang his hat. He is straight and insipid as the Secretary General of the UN and could have been played by a community actor.
Wesley Snipes, the unofficial hired gun who protects the UN interests, is always at the very least sharp-tongued and witty. Nope. Not even that. Besides some mildly entertaining martial arts scenes, the best right in the beginning, there just is nothing here in terms of script, action, or chemistry to make it worth your bother. It seems like there were hardly even any second takes to work on the interaction between the characters. No reason to bother.
Oh, except maybe Marie Matiko. Who? I don't know, but she's attractive and on occasion seemed to put an effort in this worthless script. I'm going to go watch the Matrix for the 100th time.",996278400,,1012,4.659217877094972
1330806,2,B00003CXMV,"As a piece of storytelling, `The Art of War' often borders on the incoherent - but if you stick with it to the end, you will find that most of the narrative elements do eventually fall into place and sort themselves out nicely. It's getting there that's the problem. For long stretches of the film, we really have no idea who is doing what to whom and the sad truth is we often really don't care. The question then becomes: how far can a film try a viewer's patience and, even more to the point, how long can it expect him or her to stick it out waiting for the climactic revelation? In this case, at least, the overall quality of the film may not justify all the time expended on the effort.
In theme, this is definitely not a film designed to appease right wing paranoiacs. Essentially, the film hails the United Nations as a force for world peace, while it simultaneously demonizes the anti-China trade crowd in no uncertain terms. Wesley Snipes plays a hot shot undercover agent working for the U.N. who suddenly finds himself unsure of who his real enemies are when a high Chinese government official is assassinated right on the eve of the signing of a big international trade treaty with that Communist country.
However, it would be foolish for anyone to take this film any more seriously that its superficial action movie format warrants. For all its high-minded attempts at contemporary political relevance, `The Art of War' is generally a typical entry in the action film genre, emerging as basically little more than a series of elaborate but often quite preposterous stunt sequences loosely held together by an over-complicated plot. From a technical standpoint, these action set pieces are efficiently executed (particularly impressive is a foot race that takes place over rooftops, through alleys and along major thoroughfares of New York City in a pouring down rainstorm). Yet, the film seems needlessly violent at times and one questions the appropriateness of using a tragedy like the mass extermination of some Asian immigrants as window dressing for what is, essentially, a routine action thriller.
And routine it ultimately is. There is very little in this film that commands any genuine audience interest. Without anyone for us to really care about, we lose the motivation to try and unravel the tangled narrative skeins that the filmmakers manage to dump in our laps. Thus, for all its pretensions to social significance, `The Art of War' (despite a very good closing shot, I might add) turns out to be just another traditional shoot-em-up, just another entry in a genre that seems for some reason to be a perennial favorite with the movie going crowd these days.",994464000,,2685,4.851851851851852
1330807,3,B00003CXMV,"This movie reminded me so much of the first offering of Mission Impossible, starred, Tom Cruise.  Shaw (played by Wesley Snipes) didn't exist but worked behind the scene on United Nations' behalf to influence the decision making process.  Thing started to get awry when his task as an observer to Chinese Ambassador went horribly wrong.  Instead of being a puppet master, Shaw became the puppet.  Associates that worked with him (notably Michael Biehn of Terminator, Aliens fame) were murdered.  Police & FBI were on his tail as Shaw was framed (predictably).  By coincidence, he bumped into an attractive female journalist who eventually worked along his side to solve the puzzle & to clear his name.  Art of War, by Sun Tzu was touched upon briefly here, asking the question who should we trust.  What annoyed me about the movie was the usage of Japanese to play Chinese characters.  For discerning viewers, the supposedly Mandarin & Cantonese they spoke in the movie were hardly legible. To my pleasant surprise, the cinematography of the movie was quite innovative & fast paced.  Donald Sutherland was more into a cameo appearance, Anne Archer acted as Shaw's superior, Murray Chaulkin led a solid supporting cast.  Overall, an above average action thriller with a predictable predicament but still, a well-made movie.  It could almost be rendered as a Chinese bashing movie but we wouldn't go there.",991008000,,1404,5.056521739130435
1330808,2,B00003CXMV,"At least for a while, I'm sure Snipes can make productions better than this. Otherwise, he will fall into Van Damme's categorie ... Wesley is a good action hero, who can convince dramatically too. So why he spents his times in lousy films as this one ? In this, he even was one of the executive producers. The film is not a total waste of time, has good premise, intriguing start, but all is lost in the middle, when it goes in slow motion and the cliches flow everywhere around the place ... Sutherland is here again, a new kind kind of Michael Caine ( be it, accepting whatever role people offer him - and still acting very fine ). Michael Biehn surprised me ( negatively ) as the steryotyped villain, I think he could do better than this. Anne Archer is totally unconvincing as the ""bad girl"" . The action scenes are average, no big deal, but doesn't harm the movie. The trouble is really the plot, very, very weak, going towards Seagal, Van Damme and Lundgreen...

1330810,2,B00003CXMV,"I wasn't expecting too much when I rented The Art of War, just some mindless action entertainment.  In all reality there isn't enough action in this film.  Wesley Snipes plays a role that he's played a thousand times before, renegade cop.  The plot twists in this film are right out of the 1990's action screen writing handbook.  One thing I will say in favor of this film is that the martial arts sequences were accurately portrayed.  Good hand to hand combat sequences and no Matrix style garbage.  The plot is actually not bad, involving the UN and a US/China free trade agreement but The Art of War is not worth the time.

Imagine my surprise when it turned out to be fast paced action film with a great cast and high production values.  I'm not talking about a great film, but still very entertaining compared with most of the drivel from Hollywood.  I could not understand all the bad reviews.  Then a started to get a nasty suspicion which was confirmed when I read some of the Amazon reviews.  Apparently this country has been so intimidated by the extreme right in this county that any piece of fiction that is critical of these wackos is rejected out of hand by the media.  Shades of the repression of the 40s and 50s!  I find it ironic that this movie demonstrates its own premise.",982195200,,938,4.2897727272727275
1330812,4,B00003CXMV,"Most people can't differentiate between a bad film and a film they don't like.  Many people didn't like this motion picture because of its liberal subtext.  That doesn't make it a bad film.  Most don't realize that this is a Canadian production, and that probably explains the political slant.  However, as action films go, it is intelligent, high tech, stimulating, bordering on believable (seldom are action flicks actually believable), with plenty of violence.  I didn't particularly agree with its ""New World Order"" message, but it is still a solid film.
The main criticism I have of the film is the editing.  In an attempt to make the story more intriguing, it is pasted together in a convoluted way that makes it very difficult to follow.  All the factions and motivations are eventually explained, but one has to pay very close attention or see the movie a few times to catch them all.  The screenplay suffers from an excess of subplots, which makes following the story that much more difficult.  The biggest sin committed by the producers and director was that they did not understanding their audience.  This film targets action lovers, who are a visceral lot.  They want to be stimulated, not confused and intrigued.  They also tend to be more conservative politically (God, Guns, Guts).  So naturally, the film bombed.
Wesley Snipes delivers a strong performance in the intelligent action hero role.  Snipes seems to be locked in the action genre when he is really too bright for the roles he plays.  He should take a lesson from Samuel L. Jackson and look for scripts that are more dramatic.  Jackson still does action films (Shaft), but he picks parts portraying complex characters and scripts with strong character development, instead of straight macho testosterone parts.  Snipes would have done well in some of the roles Jackson has had.  Anne Archer does a fine job as the manipulative career diplomat, pulling everyone's strings behind the scenes.  Donald Sutherland is a bit flaccid in this film, but his character really didn't have a lot of bite.
Overall, this film is a strong entry into a genre dominated by mindless body count.  I rated it an 8/10.  Those who like their action flicks to be completely believable subtract two points.  Subtract another two points for those who don't like confounding story lines.  For those who abhor screen violence, don't even bother.",981763200,,2394,4.959798994974874

After years of service, one of his team-mates gets killed and then he is pinned for the death of a high foreign national.  Now he is on the run looking for the person who did this to him.  This is nowhere near Snipes' best.  In my opinion Jungle Fever or Boiling Point show his true acting ability.  It is overly violent, using Matrix style matial arts as one of its' the key selling points.  I figured out the so-called ""mystery"" in the first few minutes of the movie.  Even with a talent filled supporting cast; Donald Sutherland (Disclosure, Shadow Conspiracy), Anne Archer (Patriot Games), and Michael Biehn (Aliens, Terminator).  This movie couldn't be helped.

Director Christian Duguay has super charged a sometimes confusing plot with lots and lots of action, gunfire, chases, explosions, you name it - it's here.  There is very little ""down time"" in this movie.  The visuals are stunning whether at the very top of a high skyscraper, in a nightclub, or on the street great effort was spent in getting it right.  Turn off the sometimes overpowering surround sound and view it once, twice,  any number of times for the pure joy of detail, color, and the essence of mood, rain, darkness, it's all there.  So the acting at times is stretched, the plot confusing,  the visuals are worth the viewing.  Actress Marie Matiko (from The Corruptor) breaths fresh life into this film.  She is headstrong, determined, vulnerable at times, always moving staying up with the action, creating action and enhancing what is happening to her and around her.  Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa who first came on the scene in a very memorable performance in ""The Last Emporer"" performs the ""perfect"" villian, smooth, evil, premeditated, you won't forget him.

So why does this movie stink? Simple, you can get EVERYTHING in this movie in ANY OTHER movie and done even better. I was HOPING for a spy film that could make up for MI2. After Blade I thought Wesley Snipes might be headed in a better direction with his movie.
The movie begins with a sub-par, uninteresting, rather bland not very actionish beginning. You see its not just the TYPICAL action thats a bore, there is no drama in this film that makes you care for anyone. Wesley Snipes wasn't BAD, its the movie really. After I found out who was behind it all, I walked out because I couldn't take anymore. the last 20 mins would have been just as boring as the rest of the film. The action scenes are SO boring!
In short, DON'T waste your time. Go Rent Mission Impossible or even SEE MI2 again JUST because the action was at least interesting if nothing else.
