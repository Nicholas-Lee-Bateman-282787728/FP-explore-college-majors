3689071,5,B001LPWGHS,"This is the complete Shakespeare searies of plays recounting the English kings from Richard II through Richard III.  The cast is outstanding -- people you will recognize as : James Bond (Sean Connery), James Herriot's boss (all creatures great and small) Richard Hardy and many other first tier actors.  There are more oscar and other award winning actors in these plays than any other series you will ever see.

I saw this series when it was originally broadcast in the early 60's.  It was a wonderful way for an 11 year old to come to love and appreciate Shakespeare.  These are better than Olivier and Branagh's productions.  Having it available again is great.  Its better than I remember.",1242777600,10,693,4.822033898305085
3689072,5,B001LPWGHS,"This is a superb set and production. But I want to focus on one aspect. Robert Hardy  is the finest Hal I've seen (and I've seen, many times,all the filmed ones- Olivier, Branaugh, Gwillim, Baxter and many on stage at Stratford Ont and in London). His interpretation,while conventionally as- it-must-be vigorous, is thoughtful and nuanced.  For instance amid all the revelry,you see,as rarely one does,from scene one, his association with Falstaff eating at him. The courtship with Katharine is done with unusual conviction. Line delivery is everywhere compelling. The series is marked by many intelligent and charming directorial touches and easily compares favorably with the latter (and fine) BBC series. But Hardy is outstanding.",1242000000,17,733,5.421052631578948
3689073,5,B001LPWGHS,"I endorse the opinions of the reviewers who came before, and had the same experience - forty years of waiting for this DVD.  In addition, I have never seen a better production of any of the Histories, black-and-white and primitive camerawork notwithstanding, and how often do you get to see Henry VI?  You will not do better.",1241136000,9,325,4.684210526315789
3689074,5,B001LPWGHS,"Like some other reviewers I watched this series -hungrily from week to week- when it was first broadcast here in the early '60s and for the decades since have hoped and hoped that it would some day be resurrected on DVD. Nunc dimittis! Age has not withered it; if anything, the whole series has a wonderful freshness about it, It is certainly delightul to watch Judi Dench, Robert Hardy and Sean Connery in their early years ( Back then, I thought Sean Connery somewhat wooden; not now: one almost expects him to pop up with, ""Hotspur, James Hotspur!"")

What struck me most forcibly-it came during one of the Henry VI plays-was the fitting nature of the whole concept: even back in the '60s I had noticed how small the interiors were and it was obvious that even the exteriors were studio shot, but seeing a picture of the model of the set brought home that this was not merely production economy: in Henry V the Chorus asks, ""...pardon, gentles all,/ The flat unraised spirits that hath dar'd/On rhia unworthy scaffold to bring forth/ So great an object."" This is the genius of the whole series: Shakespeare had his wooden O and the BBC devoutly and appropriately set the whole Age on those terms.

The acting, for such an epic, is uniformly fine; no need to duplicate other reviewers, In true repertory tradition, actors appear and reappear in different roles; I sometimes wondered how Geoffrey Bayldon kept track of who he was playing!

And isn't it wonderful that through the magic of DVD, we don't have to wait a week between episodes any more!",1240444800,13,1549,4.666666666666667
3689075,5,B001LPWGHS,"In the midst of the Great Recession, let me first remark what a bargain these discs are:  eight Shakespeare plays for $35.00--a total of 947 minutes, we are informed.  More important, they are glorious minutes.  These are excellent productions, and stand up well nearly 50 years after they were recorded.  They are not quite uncut, but the lost dialog is minimal.  A side benefit is seeing familiar actors who have grown old on screen during those years delivering great youthful performances: Robert Hardy, whom my 11 year old son knows only as Cornelius Fudge, ""Minister of Magic"" in the Harry Potter series, as Prince Hal/Henry V; Sean Connery as Hotspur, two years before he first became James Bond; the great Judi Dench, and several others familiar to fans of BBC-TV.  I cannot join in the complete adulation for these productions expressed by some adjacent reviewers, and I don't think they equal the histories as done by the BBC twenty years later for the ""BBC Shakespeare"" series.  An occasional magniloquence and a general absence of irony root these performances more in the first half of the twentieth century than the second, but they are very good indeed, well worth experiencing as the first decade of the twenty-first century comes to a close.  It's too bad that they were produced just before the great changes in video technology to color and to tape.  Based on their low resolution, almost blurry at times, these black-and-white images have the look of something preserved by Kinescope, and not recorded directly to film or videotape (the latter, I think, not yet in general use in 1960).  Still, we are the first generation able to experience directly complete performances of Shakespeare given half a century ago; in 1960, there was no possibility of seeing such a performance from 1910!  We should be grateful to the BBC for preserving these productions and making them available on DVD.",1240099200,39,1908,4.9498432601880875
3689076,5,B001LPWGHS,"We were living in Lincoln, Nebraska, in 1961 when ""Age of Kings"" was shown on the local public TV station which, I think, was associated with the University of Nebraska.  It was so memorable that I have never forgotten it -- especially Robert Hardy's performance as Prince Hal in Henry IV and as Henry V.  He was so young and vigorous that his performance transcended the small screen and the absence of color. I've been a devotee of public TV ever since, but nothing was ever as exciting as those plays at that time.  Perhaps it was TV's newness at the time, but since then TV drama has been prettied up and has lost its immediacy.",1238371200,67,632,4.431034482758621
3689077,5,B001LPWGHS,"By any standard I can think of this series stands out in memory as the finest television treatment of Shakespeare that exists.  If for nothing else the performances of Connery as Hotspur, Hardy as Hal and Harry in Henry V, and Richard Daneman as Richard III are worth owning this. Robert Hardy's St. Crispin's Day speech rivals Olivier's and Brannagh's, Daneman's Richard III also rivals Olivier's and the great Stratford performance of Antony Sher.  At no time in his long career did Sean Connery ever exceed his incomparable interpretation of Hotspur. I have wished for, prayed for, hoped for an opportunity to see this again, and NOW! Thanks to all the gods of drama.",1238284800,132,670,4.868421052631579

Additionally, what is fun about the series is that it can be appreciated as a sort of history lesson.  Aside from the role of Shakespeare as apologist for the Tutors, viewing the plays provokes interesting insights into a controversial phase of English history.",1451952000,,409,5.0
3689100,5,B001LPWGHS,"I purchased this DVD maybe 5 or 6 years ago but never gave a review, (I noticed I paid about $20 more than the present price but that's OK). Let me state first off, that still...  I continue to watch these outstanding performances, not just from time to time but at least once or twice a month. I think the more we learn about the people and places of this time period, the more we thirst for Shakespeare's insight. At least that's how I look at it.

When I first discovered Robert Hardy it was as Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester in the ""Elizabeth R"" BBC mini series and thought he was a wonderful actor... but to see him as the ""Gallant"" Prince Hal and King Henry V, I was blown away. Sean Connery as Hotspur was a pleasant surprise, so was Judi Dench. But 6 years on and a more learn-ed appreciation within the tetralogy, three favorite Characters have emerged besides Prince Hal are as follows; 1) Sir John 'Jack' Falstaff... Frank Pettingell was born to play the role.  2) Henry Bolingbroke/Henry IV... Tom Fleming. 3) King Richard II... David William - I've grown to understand the emotions it takes to act the role of poor Richard. Also, the Owen Glendower character has opened up a new direction of historical interest which led me to author John Cowper Powys and his books. This DVD is still my favorite above all my other Shakespeare and Kurosawa DVD collections. It's the one I turn too time and time again when I want to close off the outside world and get away to another time and place.",1442102400,,1500,4.447272727272727

After about 10 minutes I turned off the computer and gave this series my full attention.  It was quite immersive to see these plays one after the other with the same actors playing their roles.  Not only are the leading roles impressive but character roles are portrayed with love and affection, especially characters like Falstaff, Bardolph, Pistol, Mistress Quickly, and many others.

Some surprises, good and some not so good:  a sexy Judi Dench appears as the French Princess courted by Henry V, and Sean Connery is great as ""Hotspur"" in the second segment of ""Henry IV"" that his later work as James Bond and other heroes seems now to be ""anticlimactic"" in nature;  on the other hand I am slightly disappointed to discover a few instances of ""editing"" of Shakespeare's original works, something that didn't happen 25 or so years ago with the PBS ""Shakespeare Plays.""  Kent State University offered post graduate credits re. the PBS series.  There was also ""editing"" in the recent ""The Holllow Crown"" presentations on PBS.  Still the 60's ""Age of Kings"" holds up well against the recent productions.  ""Falstaff"" presents the immortal (and immoral) prototypical ""picaresque,"" loveable, and bawdy rogue.

These black and white, highly theatrical stagings may seem strange to people today. But the actors delivery their lines with such feeling and knowledge of what they are saying that the lack of cinematic movement and naturalistic acting seems irrelevant.

3689118,5,B001LPWGHS,"A legendary production, the BBC's television production of Shakespeare's mighty double tetralogy casts the sequence of eight plays (Richard II, the two parts of Henry IV, Henry V, the three parts of Henry VI, and Richard III) into 15 hour-long vignettes. The result is an epic of truly epic proportions; one that easily transcends the limits imposed by the television production capabilities of the time.

Backed by an impressive supporting cast, it is the monarchs who define this series:

David William (Richard II) gets the series started off in an appropriately theatrical manner--his diction and intonation are unashamedly melodramatic, as befits the eponymous character of Richard II, acknowledged as one of Shakespeare's most impressive demonstrations of expression in English. A portrayal of truly tragic intensity, William's Richard II is by turns vain, indecisive, brooding, and self-righteous.

Tom Fleming's Henry IV is a high point of the series. A study in the burdens that accompany regal power, Fleming's Henry offers a movingly human counterpoint to Richard II's vanity and the fiery passion of Henry V and Edward IV. Fleming also offers a strong contrast with Robert Hardy's role as Prince Hal--the future Henry V. Where Hal is impulsive and constantly living for the next five minutes, Henry IV is thoughtful and farsighted. The contrast is well demonstrated through the performances of these two actors.

When he ascends the throne, Robert Hardy's Henry V must shed his associations with his rambunctious past, and the transformation is razor-sharp in the famous scene depicting the king's rejection and banishment of Sir John Falstaff. However, underneath Henry's more pronouncedly regal exterior, Hardy maintains hints of the boyish mischievousness that so characterized Prince Hal's youth. This adolescent charm bursts forth to full effect as Henry V woos Princess Katherine of France (Dame Judi Dench) in a delightful interweaving of pidgin English and mangled French. Leading his troops to battle beforehand, Hardy's declamations, ""Once more unto the breach,"" and ""Today is St Crispin's day"" recall the passionate outpourings of his youth, in a more mature setting.

Henry V's premature death plunges England and France into political and military turmoil, leaving Henry VI (Terry Scully) to pick up the pieces. Perhaps the most challenging of the roles in the series, Henry VI finds a sympathetic soul in Scully, who undergoes a dramatic transformation from a child and young man full of vigor to a wizened, shattered monarch quietly awaiting death (which soon comes in the hunchbacked form of the future Richard III). Scully captures in a truly moving fashion the gamut of Henry VI's personality, in particular the monarch's zealous sense of piety and religious idealism. These sentiments leave him prone to manipulation, first by a cadre of politicos surrounding his throne and, soon thereafter, by his wife, Mary Morris's Queen Margaret. Morris's portrayal breathes vigorous life into one of Shakespeare's most scheming female characters this side of Lady Macbeth. Terry Scully's physical transformation during the course of the five episodes drawn from Henry VI is incredible and must be seen in its entirety to be fully appreciated.

Julian Glover's Edward IV is everything Henry VI is not: ambitious, impulsive, deceitful, and brashly self-confident. Glover brings out Edward's almost constantly-changing mind and furious passions to the full, whether it is in bluntly wooing his future queen, the widow Elizabeth Grey; his demands that his brothers Richard and George show her full love and acceptance; or his rash temptation of fate at the end of Henry VI Part Three, ""Sound drums and trumpets, farewell sour annoy, / For here I hope begins our lasting joy!"" The contrast between these two actors--Scully's slight, almost fragile frame vs Glover's stout, solid bulk--is among the most visually effective pairings in the series.

Richard III (Paul Daneman), the last of the major portrayals, is the consummation of the series, as his ascent and the civil strife it engenders fulfills the curse pronounced by the Bishop of Carlisle way back in Richard II. Daneman gives literature's most famous hunchbacked villain a performance for the ages, fully communicating Richard's insatiable ambition and love of bloodletting. In the famous soliloquy from Henry VI Part Three (""Ay, Edward will use women honourably...""), Daneman waddles, rolls, gnashes, and slithers about the stage as he weaves the web that will ultimately ensnare virtually everyone around him. Daneman's performance is comparable to the almost breathtaking depiction of Caius Cassius by Sir John Gielguld in the 1953 film of Julius Caesar: like Gielguld, Daneman manages to become an ever-present force; even when not on the screen, Richard III's presence is nonetheless felt, like the puppeteer whose hands and strings are invisible, but understood to be present regardless. While Daneman lacks the unmitigated malicious hatred of, say, Ian McKellan's 1995 portrayal, he makes up for it in the creation of Richard as an intelligent, patient schemer--where McKellan is a true boar in a china shop, Daneman is better described as the ""bottled spider"", quietly weaving his web of intrigues and biding his moment.

If the kings were the sole strong points, ""An Age of Kings"" would be a triumph. That so many in the supporting cast are top-notch as well only further cements the series's claim to fame. Sir Sean Connery's Hotspur is a tour-de-force. The unrestrained hotheaded young man receives what may be the defining performance for decades to come in Sean Connery's work here, and his verbal sparring with William Squire's Owen Glendower is a magnificent comedy of manners. Frank Pettingell's Sir John Falstaff is almost typecast, and his inflection--often almost hinting at drunkenness--is perfectly attuned to Falstaff's normal state. Mary Morris plays a delightfully and infuriatingly ambitious Margaret and her interactions with Jack May's imperious Duke of York are a bitterness to be savored. Robert Lang's Henry Cardinal Beaufort and John Ringham's Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, are another pairing whose burning hatred of each other translate into excellent performances.

The fight scenes are a bit iffy, some settings are obviously contrived, the quality of the DVD is only as good as can be expected, given the now fifty-one year age of the series, and the plays themselves are cut; but for all that, this is still an excellent way to meet some of Shakespeare's most complex plays and characters for the first time. By telling the unified story these two tetralogies contain, the BBC introduced the love of Shakespeare to a whole generation of television watchers on both sides of the Atlantic.

3689129,5,B001LPWGHS,"This cycle of history plays covers 100 years of the kings between Richard 2nd and Richard 3rd, including the plays of Henry 4th, 5th and 6th. There are 8 plays and 15 hours to either enjoy or put up with. The cast reads like a `who's who' of British acting from the early 1960s, many of whom give high quality performances. Actors include Sean Connery, Frank Windsor, Julian Glover, Judi Dench, Robert Hardy, Robert Lang, Eileen Atkins, Patrick Garland, Tom Fleming and others. They take on leading roles, but consistently reappear throughout the series and excel in cameo roles.
  Characterisation was a great success and a hallmark of the production, although we must forgive the wooden scenes, occasional fluffed lines and unconvincing battle scenes. Many swordfights between small numbers of actors pass for huge and long battles which push along the narrative. Personally I can make allowances for old and occasionally damaged black and white film, much of which needs to be toned down with the contrast and brightness settings.
  Even with these limitations, I still preferred this production to the `academic' and colour BBC series of Shakespeare's canon made 20 years or so later. The only complaint I have is that in both productions the difficult character of the young Henry 6th is not portrayed convincingly. However in this earlier production the king in old age is much better, realistic and even enjoyable.

Even so, I still believe that there are many more up to date screen versions of plays and mini-series, including live recordings at the Globe Theatre and BBC series which are more entertaining for the less avid Shakespearian.",1320624000,4,1715,5.042402826855124

It's all of Shakespeare's English history plays, cut up, rearranged to be chronological, then abridged to fit a 15-hour run time.  There are 5 discs in the set; each DVD has 3 episodes, thus 15 hours.

This was made for the BBC in the early 1960's.  When they came on American TV, each episode was given a short introduction by Mortimer J. Adler.

The costumes and sets are spare but the acting and direction are considered so top-notch that people who saw this on TV 50 years ago still seek it out.  It was also filmed on video, so by this point it looks like you're looking at some cheap black-and-white bootleg.

All the actors are excellent but the one that really stands out is Jack May - that voice, and what an excellent actor. Alas, I just learned that he passed away in the late 90's. Of all the characters portrayed in this series on the Kings his was the most believable as the Duke of York. I so closely associated him with the Duke that I wanted myself to sport a white rose. This series also ties the many aspects and historical background necessary to understand characters such as Henry V and Richard III. Understanding what was done to the Duke of York one can understand some of Richard's later brutality. But all is made most clear as when one understands that once Bolingbrook usurped the throne he laid the groundwork for future blood to be spilled. Lovers of Shakespeare and of History will appreciate this monumental work for TV---and may agree on what an excellent talent Mr. Jack May had...requiescat in pace.",1313366400,3,1113,4.742268041237113

Talbot, the hero and most memorable character in the play, with the most memorable and affecting scenes and lines, it cut out entirely, barring a brief mention in the first scene. Try to imagine The Merchant of Venice staged without Shylock and you get some idea. If there are any other fans of 1H6 out there (I think it is a severely underrated play), be sure you track down the later, more complete BBC version.

3689134,5,B001LPWGHS,"The first BBC megahit from the 1960s. Wonderful acting (including the very young Sean Connery as passionate Hotspur). A better portrayal of Falstaff than Orson Welles. And a better Richard III than Olivier. The script isn't too bad either.

OK, OK... Olivier did a better King Henry V. However, this actor's Prince Hal plays off his foil, Falstaff to perfection in Henry IV.

3689135,5,B001LPWGHS,This DVD set has been long awaited. My mom has talked about this series for years. It made a lasting impression on her and has asked for a long time to see if it was available. For a long time it was not. It has many actors and actresses that are still very popular today. Even though this was produced in the 70's it was done very well.,1299628800,,337,3.9705882352941178
3689136,2,B001LPWGHS,"9/4/10 - I was wrong. I was watching these DVD's on a portable player - when I switched to a 24 inch screen, I did become engrossed. I rewatched Richard II and Henry IV - and virtually the whole plays are there. A lot of the acting is pretty darn good, though some of it is pretty bad. But the Baddeley's, Hermione and Angela, were fine. As I noted below, the guy playing Falstaff isn't funny, but he does have his moments. It's the other main players who miss the target. Hal (Robert Hardy) is stiff and his passionate stuff lacks conviction. Sean Connery as Hotspur is a far more interesting character - I wanted him to win. Too often our Kings - Bolingbroke/Henry IV and Richard II - stare into space as they speak - no, not soliloquies - one does not get the sense that they are thinking to themselves - it's like they don't know where to look. The staging is cramped, and even a HiDef screen doesn't help the video. There are times at the end of Henry IV Part II when one simply cannot see what is going on, though nothing much is actually happening.
One final cavil. There is no material supplied with the series - just the original TV shows. No printed material. Not even a list of actors and roles - one of the reasons I am so vague as to who plays whom.
All in all, I must admit my original rating was far too low. The things I said about the video, audio, staging and makeup were true, but the overall production does a great deal with so very little. Now I would give An Age of Kings - 3.5 stars, maybe more or less as I finish the DVD's - they are good enough so that I want to do so. Yeah, I was off before. Shakespeare always draws you in.
I was, however, right about one thing; when I showed Henry IV Pt 1 to a student, he kept laughing, and not at Falstaff.
EARLIER: This DVD release of a long ago BBC television series has gotten praise from other reviewers, and, since there seemed to be no other DVD version of Henry IV Part I, I figured I might as well get Richard II, the Henry's (IV-VI) and Richard III together in one bundle. Videos help students understand Shakespeare.
Wrong choice - the Age of Kings does not actually have the complete plays, only chunks, though they are easy enough to follow. However, I cannot show this series to students - they would laugh. The production values are terrible - shoddy, cramped sets that are unconvincing and a video quality one can usually only find on old VHS. It looks like filmed TV of an earlier age (because that is what it is), washed-out, slightly murky and a little blurry. In this case, one can be grateful that An Age of Kings isn't in color. As for the sound, everything seems too loud, even when one turns down the sound. The sound quality is also not good, and horns hurt your ears. Enunciation is good though monotonic, and the subtitles are clear and helpful.
The make-up the actors wear (and they wear a lot of it if they are supposed to look old) is of a quality usually seen on kids at Halloween. Richard II's face looked as if it were made of wax, and the fake eyelashes on various characters seem something out of a comedy.
None of this would really matter if the acting were good, but in what I have watched so far (Richard II through the second part of Henry IV) it is not. Sean Connery as Hotspur is watchable because he doesn't seem to be taking the whole thing seriously, though when he does, the scenery is thoroughly chewed. None of the other actors were known to me, except for Judy Dench, but she hasn't shown up yet. (I have never seen her go wrong, so her role, at least, should be a treat.) Prince Hal is unconvincing and is always looking off stage for lines. Richard II and Henry IV seem half-dead - even the great ""Let us sit upon the ground and tell sad tales of the deaths of kings ...."" speech is almost emotionless. Glendower looks and sounds like a Klingon. The sword battle between Hal and Hotspur is so badly staged as to be funny. It's a wonder the two actors didn't kill themselves. Speaking of humor, this Falstaff is not funny, but he's not bad; when he discusses ""honor"", he's right on target.
When this series was done, it was a great achievement for television, but it just doesn't hold up over time. It's not horrible, but it's not good. The complex interplay of themes which Shakespeare created get badly lost.",1283040000,8,4325,4.314496314496314
3689137,5,B001LPWGHS,"I was looking for something else when I came across 'Age of Kings', and vaguely remembered a few images from childhood.  I was intrigued that after nearly half-a-century it was being put on DVD.  I knew it would be a good production for its time, since BBC was really great in the 1960s and 1970s.  Still, there was a slight sense of 'Don't expect too much - remember it was an ""Age"" ago that this was made.'  I could not have been more mistaken.  Had my expectations been high they would still have been surpassed.  It's brilliant.  Inevitably a potted run-through of 8 out of 10 of Shakespeare's history plays must compress, and one fears character and drama will be lost.  But not a bit of it.  I was truly amazed at how well the character of individuals like Richard II, Henry V, Richard III came through, and how Shakespeare's overall portrayal of the struggle held up.  While scaled down, of course, the 'HENRY V' we have here works as well dramatically as Laurence Olivier's 1940s version or Kenneth Branagh's 1980s version.
  At the price offered, it's a bargain.  And there's nothing else like it.  It's the only integrated, manageable and credible playing of Shakespeare's continuous cycle of history plays.  Think of this as in the same league as I CLAUDIUS and BRIDESHEAD REVISITED. The only regret is that, amazingly, this DVD is designed only for North America with nothing comparable available for European (and British) audiences.",1282089600,8,1446,4.797570850202429

I'm goaded into saying how fabulous these productions really are, because other reviews of this DVD set so badly miss the point. No, it's not modern dress. No, it's not high production values. No, it's not every other gimmick and gimcrackery people have thought up so they don't have to come to grips with the material of the plays. It takes a bit of subtlety and attention to really appreciate all that's here. Definitely not for those who want an action flick!  These performances far exceed other Shakespeare I've been privileged to see, with very few and memorable exceptions: Maggie Smith in As You Like It; Olivier's Lear, a few others. Sheer pleasure. And-- maybe we LIKE to see how the plays were performed in 1960! There's a lot to be said for that. No, it's not dated, it's beyond dates and times.",1276819200,8,917,4.80379746835443

I purchased the set for my British Lit. class; however my students would bolt for the door within minutes. I hoped the plays would be like those operas they filmed on stage in the late 50's and 60's. Unfortunately they are not. Also, the dialogue is, surprisingly, difficult to understand. I just attended a performance of Richard III at Shakespeare in Chicago. Every line bright and clear. Two of our guests who are not fans of Elizabethan English had no difficulty understanding. Not so with this DVD. All in all, a HUGE mistake purchasing the set.
As an aside, it's about time that Amazon came up with a system of identifying whether or not the reviewer has actually purchased the item being reviewed. Thank you Amazon.",1254787200,27,855,4.8231292517006805
3689152,5,B001LPWGHS,"I saw An Age of Kings back on Australian TV in 1960 or 1961 and have never forgotten it. The performance of Richard II is the best I've seen (including the RSC at Stratford-on-Avon). Terry Scully gave a great performance as King Henry VI -- not the easiest or most sympathetic character to play. He awoke in me an interest in the historical King Henry VI that has lasted now some 50 years. I was sorry to learn that he had died of a stroke in 2001. I have often sought in vain for a video of this great BBC series -- succeeding versions have all tended to be too ""contemporary"" and ""avant garde"" for my taste. I am delighted with this DVD and can recommend it wholeheartedly to all lovers of Shakespeare and those interested in the drama of the Wars of the Roses. (Don't expect Shakespeare to deliver accurate history, however!)",1253750400,11,828,4.4183006535947715
3689153,4,B001LPWGHS,"I've only seen Richard II, Henry IV, and parts of Henry V so far.  I just compared parts of 1HenryIV from this black-and-white production (ca. 1960) and the more recent BBC production of 1HIV (an unexpected ""pun"", what?) from the complete set done a few decades later.  The later was quite good, with Anthony Quale a wonderful Falstaff and decent color photography.  The Falstaff in this set is just as good.  The Prince Hal in the later set has an annoying Beatles haircut, the one in this set has more classical command of his character; pity he wears ballet tights. This Richard II is wonderful, you will feel for this pitiful lead character (historically he was not so pitiful, of course, but that's another story).

While the newer BBC set looks somewhat higher budget, this older one generally displays more gravitas.  Perhaps I'm a tad antiquarian, but classical music buffs will understand the difference between a terrific modern recording vs. some of the better older recordings when conductors could put the fear of G-d into the players to deliver an extra ""sweep"" that is not possible today.  In this ""Age of Kings"" set, the actors convey a long familiarity with their roles and deliver a dramatic ""sweep.""  Here is old-school, flamboyant confidence.

It's a shame the recording technology used was so unnecessarily primitive, but had they done it right you wouldn't be getting 16 hours of fine Bard for $35.

The cuts are well planned, so the stories unfolds quite gracefully.
Most of the plays are presented in two 65 minute segments, rather than act-by-act.  The sub-titles are very helpful for modern viewers.

It was a smashing success in 1960 and while much discussed has been rarely seen since then, until this fine five disc set. Great fun for theater and Shakespeare buffs.

3689156,5,B001LPWGHS,"As a classically trained actor who has done more than his share of
Shakespeare, I can honestly say I've generally found the connecting
factors of his history cycle (Richard II to Richard III, with three
Henrys in between) somewhat elusive.  This series has resolved quite
a multitude of misunderstandings I've had about these plays.  To see
the whole cycle performed chronologically, with all the same actors
playing their designated roles throughout, gave me an appreciation
for these works that no actor (or basic Bardophile) should be without.
Many are familiar with Henry V or Richard III because of their past
cinematic incarnations, and some have only a perfunctory knowledge
of characters like Hotspur and Falstaff.  This series, as dated as
it is, serves as a wonderful introduction.  And what a treat to see
this cast!  Many of them were (some still are) legendary performers
of the London stage who, because they never carved out a niche for
themselves in films (either American or British) are unknown outside
the realm. This series may be the only document available of their
incredible talents.  Others of course, are more well known. To see
a pre-James Bond Sean Connery as Hotspur, or Judi Dench in her young
ingenue phase as Katherine of France (not to mention character actor
stalwarts like Julian Glover, Geoffrey Bayldon, and George A. Cooper)
is just so much gravy on an impeccable meal.  An additional note for
those who may have difficulties in viewing and accepting this material,
is the on-screen English subtitle option that allows you to view the
Shakespearean text as its being spoken. And any qualms about length
are eased by the fact that the series is broken down as originally
broadcast - in 15 (mostly) one-hour segments.  It's like viewing an
episodic Shakespearean historical soap opera.  Perfect for students!
Highly recommended.",1244937600,101,1864,5.085245901639344

3689158,5,B001LPWGHS,"Today, it's hard to imagine what a difficult undertaking this would be:  All of the major history plays---Richard II, Henry IV Parts 1 & 2, Henry V, Henry VI Parts 1,2 and 3 and Richard III--- truncated (slightly) to 15 hours of television. For 30 weeks, on every second Thursday night, an hour of The Bard's works was broadcast into the homes of Great Brittan. Picked up by public television in America, it was for a generation the benchmark of televised Shakespeare.  Not seen for decades, the big question was, of course, would An Age of Kings stand up to memory . . . or would the years date it absurdly?
Actually, the answer is yes. And yes. On the negative side, the technical work, especially in the earlier shows, leaves much to be desired.  Grainy black-and-white is a given, but the camera seems sometimes to have a mind of its own, and the mind isn't always on Shakespeare.  The focus drifts aimlessly, the heads of speaking performers are cut off, and generally there are moments of an unforgivably amateur look.  Further, the style of acting is not one we're used to anymore, and, more than anything else, this is most off-putting.  Actors at the time had a tendency to ""gabble""  their lines---that is, rely so heavily on the blank verse to carry the lengthy speeches that the audience feels pummeled by the heavily stressed beats in the iambic pentameter. No wonder An Age of Kings was so wonderfully parodied in ""So That's The Way You Like It,"" a sketch from Beyond the Fringe
However, the plus side more than makes up for these shortcomings.  First, consider that this is really the first rendering of the complete histories anywhere.  Some of the plays, to be sure, had been done in succession, but the choice to  do all eight was surely a brave one that paid off mightily.  Although written separately throughout Shakespeare's career, the plays do ultimately fit together in a sweeping saga of the British Monarchy. Seeing the same performers play the same characters in successive works fills out a theme and narrative that would be otherwise missing;  an added pleasure is to see a very young Dame Judi Dench in the small role of Katherine in Henry V, and an absolutely spectacular Sean Connery in the  not -so-unsubstantial role Hotspur.",1243814400,19,2258,4.729591836734694

The problem I found with the early 1960's releases is that ""All of the dialogue"" was spoken and at an incredible pace which was crazy! Buy the film ""Titus"" with Sir Anthony Hopkins and Jessica Lang to see and hear how Shakespeare ought to be acted. The dialogue is from ""Titus Andronicus"" but not in Shakespeare's chronology. There are acts, scenes and lines that are all from the play but only half. But, the tale is told using only Shakespeare's meter.

One is the poor image quality. It's a 16mm kinescope ** using the BBC's low-resolution 405-line video system *** of what was (incredibly) live performances. The sound is crisp and clear, suggesting it's derived from synched magnetic tape, rather than an optical recording.

The other is the acting. It's typical British Shakespeare, with actors racing through their lines, almost devoid of expression or inflection, as if they'll miss the last bus for home. On the rare occasions when an actor slows down and gives the lines their proper weight and meaning, you realize how good these productions could have been, but weren't.

Shakespeare's writing is poetic, not quotidian. To rush through it, without regard for the listeners' need to comprehend it -- and worse, to allow time for the words to be rolled under the mind's tongue -- is an insult to Shakespeare and the audience. We Colonials do it better.

ADDENDUM: Watching the rest of the first disk reveals David William (Richard II) slowing down and becoming comprehensible. But in the third act, Frank Pettingell (Falstaff) is almost impossible to understand -- not the words, but their meaning/significance.

Though his eyebrows tend to steal the scenes he's in, Sean Connery generally makes clear what he's talking about. His performance is unrestrained (in a good way). The movie star he would become is present.

* Couldn't resist.
** DuMont offered a hybrid film/video system (Electronicam} prior to the introduction of videotape. Jackie Gleason used it for ""The Honeymooners"".
