5346169,5,B009L4DSV4,Jimmy Stewart and Sandra Dee along with a great cast in a classic 60's comedy romp. Again the DVD quality is not as great as it could be but you have to love this film which is great for the whole family.,1359331200,5,204,3.880952380952381
5346170,5,B009L4DSV4,I really enjoyed this movie it takes me back to the time I was a teenager and when I traveled over to France.,1359331200,,109,3.782608695652174
5346171,4,B009L4DSV4,"Jimmy Stewart has never been funnier on film than in this exceptionally good but light comedy from 1963.

He plays the over protective Dad in an era when ""Blowin' in the Wind"" was in the... air. He follows his college freshman daughter around the planet, to ensure her well-being in the brave new world - and finding himself in one compromising position after the other.

Good script, but indifferent and curiously voyeuristic direction; and light use of the great Audrey Meadows, who nonetheless gets major close-ups - casual fans can take it or leave it.",1358121600,4,556,4.842105263157895
5346172,5,B009L4DSV4,"This movie will take your mind off your troubles and really entertain you. What Jimmy Stewart goes through in this movie trying to protect his air-head college daughter, Sandra Dee, is a scream. Good intentions become the basis for laughs as every incident is blown out of proportion by some unexpected third party. Jimmy Stewart is a lawyer who gets a personal taste of how some parental ideas don't work out as expected. Its another movie about how the older generation doesn't understand the younger one and vice-versa. Jimmy Stewart and Sandra Dee are exceptional in their roles and give you plenty of tongue-in-cheek humor.",1355443200,16,628,4.9904761904761905
5346173,5,B009L4DSV4,"I have been waiting for this movie to be released on DVD for a very long time. Jimmy Stewart is the father of a beautiful young lady who is popular with the opposite sex.  Every time she does something questionable, his reactions lands him in hot water.  Sandra Dee is wonderful as his daughter.",1354233600,4,295,4.444444444444445
5346174,1,B009L4DSV4,"This is one of the cutest comedies from the early 60's. Stewart and Dee are an absolute joy.

However, this is my beef: the film, though not in Pan/Scan as in the case of this company's other recent CinemaScope releases,is presented in the ""Letterboxed"" format and it is NOT Anamorphic by any means. It will come as a big dissappointment to those of you who own a Flat Screen and play movies in their original format. If you still have one of the old CRT TV sets of yesteryear, or you don't care, you'll be Okay.

As for me, I am totally baffled that in 2012 a major studio, whose wide screen system in 1953 revolutionized the way films are presented forever, would release their old CinemaScope movies  in a tiny Letterboxed format, when their older CinemaScope DVD releases, like the Monroe fliks, ""Peyton Place,"" ""The Man In The Grey Flannel Suit,"" etc. were originally released completely anamorphic in order to fit on rear projection screens of a few years ago! This company is run by idiots, and I shall abstain from wasting my hard earned money on their old fashioned product.",1354147200,36,1083,4.630208333333333
5346175,5,B009L4DSV4,"This 1963 comedy with James Stewart and Sandra Dee receives an overdue release via the Fox Cinema Archive Collection.  The film, an adaptation of Phoebe and Henry Ephron's hit stage play, focuses on the misadventures of Frank Michaelson (Stewart) as he travels across country and continent to protect his daughter's (Dee) virtue.  Co-starring Audrey Meadows, John McGiver, and Robert Morley, Take Her, She's Mine looks breathtaking in widescreen (one of the few CinemaScope features in this collection that retains its original aspect ratio) and offers a crisp monotrack.  No special features, but the delightful film (and its pristine print) warrants the purchase price. Recommended for sixties' spectators as well Stewart fans-- look for Bob Denver, Jim Nabors, and James Brolin in cameo roles.",1351036800,20,796,5.455284552845528

5346181,3,B009L4DSV4,"Slow but charming.  If you can be as patient as the vintage era lifestyle was, this will suit you very well as a family flick.  The theme is not well suited to children under twelve.  Not hilarious but well acted.  A sort of adolescent transition movie when the moral fifties began to give way to the immoral trends of the sixties.  If the flower power era revolts you, this film may, too.",1441324800,,389,4.347222222222222

5346185,5,B009L4DSV4,"Wow, this has been a favorite of mine for years.  I remember watching it the first time when I was snowed in in college.  No classes, but nowhere to go, the local TV station ran Cabin Fever Theater all night long.  James Stewart is at home playing the ever exasperated father of new college student Sandra Dee.  He is so intent on saving her, he falls into trap after trap.  Yes it is a comedy of misadventures, but Mr. Stewart keeps it somehow believable.  The movie has a great supporting cast, well written dialogue and lots of laughs.  As a father now whose daughter has graduated college and is prepare to wed, I understand Jimmy Stewart's trials and tribulations.",1436832000,,669,4.571428571428571

5346205,5,B009L4DSV4,"Maybe not exactly screwball, but pretty close.

Cute comedy about coming of age of teenage daughter Sandra Dee.  Yes, the story line is about Dee and her romance with a handsome Frenchman.  Dee even sings, believe it or not!

But the fun part of this oldie is Stewart and the shenanigans he gets in -- he keeps getting arrested because he gets sucked into strange situations from a college protest to his consorting in a brothel which he went in just to make a phone call!

Funny scene with a period costume he wears.  Robert Morely, a great old character actor, helps Stewart with his costume, which is where the fun begins.

Jayne Meadows does a great turn as the calm mom in all this.

Stewart could do it all, comedy, drama, cowboys.  One of this better comedy roles.",1403222400,4,771,4.489208633093525

5346209,4,B009L4DSV4,"This is one of my favorite movies and am so glad I finally was able to buy it in DVD format.

Jimmy Stewart is charming as the father, Sandra Dee is delightful as the daughter, Audrey Meadows is wonderful as the mother, and Robert Morley is engaging with two polar opposite parts. This movie is dated but that is part of the charm - it captures a more innocent time in our history. Is the storyline believable? Probably not, but I don't care.
