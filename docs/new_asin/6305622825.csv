1052298,3,6305622825,"This is overrated. I would not recommend watching. Your time is worth something.

CZJ was kinda awful, like a bratty teenager. It was painful to watch her mannerisms and listen to her faux American accent. She sounds like she was raised on a farm and never left. (there are plenty of well educated farmers, but the stereotype is the stereotype). The accent does not fit the work nor the person her character has cultivated. It was disappointing. Emoting has taken the front seat with common sense relegated to somewhere beyond the trunk. The emotions were disingenuous.

SC was ordinary SC. Not good, not bad. Seemed a better fit for his role than CZJ for hers.

Dialog was poor. Action scenes were kinda dramatic, but ultimately lame. They could have gone further.

Interesting twists, but not enough to keep you engaged. I stopped the movie several times to run errands, walk the dog, etc. Not gripping.",1487980800,,905,4.819354838709677

My wife and I watched it again because she had just come back from Scotland and I asked her if she had gone to Malcolm's Castle. She frowned and asked why. I explained that it was the castle where Entrapment was filmed. Of course she corrected me that it was Duart's Castle, on the Isle of Mull. Rita-Jones was in her prime when this was made and it's easy to see why Michael Douglas lost his head for her.",1464048000,2,563,4.271028037383178

1052647,4,6305622825,"This is a different kind of ""whodunit"".  This isn't about someone being killed but something being taken.  Catherine Zeta-Jones plays Virginia Baker, an insurance investigator who is looking closely at Robert MacDougal (Sean Connery) for the theft of a Rembrandt.

Connery and Zeta-Jones work well with each other in this movie.  Zeta-Jones ""infiltrates"" Connery to ""learn from him"".  Is she on the up and up?  Is she on the sly?  There's a decent movie here made better by the limber Zeta-Jones and Connery's workout routine.",1462406400,,526,5.117647058823529

1052718,5,6305622825,"I have always loved this movie. Catherine and Sean Connery make a good debut together in a heist style of a movie. Catherine looks as good as ever and Sean is right there with his usual style. The drama and locales of the movie are excellent! For the most part, this movie looks good here. I have the 2011 edition Blu-ray. I have played it on a 65"" Ultra 4K with a Sony Blu-ray player. Fox doesn't list the movie as being Full 1080p in the specifications, but lists in the Special Features the Theatrical Trailer is in HD. Huh? What gives Fox? We live in the digital age now, everything that is put out should be full HD, especially on a format like this for our newer Digital TVs. I give this movie 5 stars for everything about it, but the Blu-ray could have been better and more Features also.

Zeta-Jones' acting is not very believable but she occupies the screen  is a great way as she maneuvers over and through infrared lasers.  In short, this is a great movie and an instant classic.  S. Connery was too much of an acting presence for Zet-Jones to be opposite of him.  However, he carried the movie with his sophistication and screen presence.

As Connery enters the waning years of his career, he shows us he still can hold our attention with a glance, a lifted eyebrow, and that accent, while in the end he shows his humanity and vulnerability in a way that the younger Connery never would have done.

1053301,4,6305622825,"I remember seeing this movie on 2 May 1999. At the time I wrote that it was a 7.0 out of 10. But that sells short a great film that had suspense, action and great drama all combined into one swell feature.

I hadn't seen this movie since it was released in 1999. Because I'd only seen it once I had forgotten much of what I saw. I did remember the climax that took place on PETRONAS Twin Towers, however. That action sequence was nothing short of fantastic! it was my first time ever seeing the world's tallest building. Ironically, this was before 9-11, and some three minutes into this movie we can see in the background (From Inside A Skyscraper) America's Twin Towers before they were taken away from us two years later.

I liked the supporting characters too. Thibodaux and Cruz were two guys that you had no idea which side they were on until the very end of the film. Thibodaux was more a mystery than Cruz, to tell you the truth. Nevertheless, they were played well by Ving Rhames and Will Patton, respectively. Ironically, I just finished seeing a movie called Out of Sight where Rhames played a similar heavy with George Clooney. Yet this character had less screen time than his character ""Buddy"" did in Out of Sight. As another top reviewer said: ""Rhames must be tired of playing 'heavies' all of the time.""

I give this film only Four Stars for several glaring plot holes. Connery's character, MacDougal seems to be too cagey a man to have ever been captured by the FBI. Also, how could Baker have jumped off a train halfway between stations? That would have entailed having to pull the emergency cord which would have stopped the train but would also have alerted the authorities--especially when a woman would have been seen running across the tracks and climbing over a fence. Yes, she could have done all of that but the FBI would have been pursuing her. Another thing is this: How exactly would they have hid one billion dollars!? It's hard enough in this day and age to hide  one million bucks, but a billion! There is no way money like that could have been sluiced into that enough accounts to make it nearly invisible to snoops.

My last two sentences beg this question. Why did they not have a sequel to wrap this movie up? This would have been the perfect movie for a sequel. indeed, it could be a great vehicle for Mr. Connery to come out of retirement and reprise one of the 20 or 25 best roles he's ever played in my opinion. Someone would certainly have come looking for their missing billion dollars. Please 20th Century Fox, make a sequel to this great film!

I have the original full screen version that was released. As soon as I can I will purchase the special edition widescreen version and add that to my DVD library. Buy and view this DVD if you enjoy heist films; you certainly won't be disappointed.

1053468,5,6305622825,"I very rarely buy movies - if any, then a nature documentary.  But, I've now watched Entrapment 4 times, and I love it as much now as ever.  Oscar material it isn't, but it's well-done and outstanding for what it is.  The plot is vaguely along the lines of ""The Great Train Robbery"" (also starring Sean Connery) - but so much better than his earlier movie.  The action takes place during the weeks before and during the turn of the millenium (1999), and involves a few great heists.

Entrapment is great fun:  a flight of fantasy for sure; including a few ""missions impossible"" with enough suspense to keep your heart-rate up; a hint or two of 007 (with high-tech gadgetry, and some chase scenes), except with more well-paced action over-all; a touching, evolving romance between Mac (Connery) and Gin (Catherine Zeta-Jones), despite their quite different ages and screen personalities.  It is serious drama for the most part, but with some lighter moments now and then as well.  It never becomes ""dark"" or melodramatic.  The acting is excellent, and the dialog believable.  The musical score is closely tied to the drama, and appropriate.  And, throw in a few surprises at the end.  In sum, good entertainment.",1390435200,5,1211,4.853658536585366

For those who need a the ending to be a surprise (and it will be) I will not go into any details.

One thing I don't understand is why the extras from the DVD were not carried over to the Blu Ray disc namely the trailers and TV spots, deleted scenes with and without commentary and mini documentary feature.  I also hope one day they put back in to the film the deleted scenes because it would make the film better and a bit easier to understand at the beginning.  I could just strangle the director for doing that as well as anyone else who thought it was a good idea.  What a wast not using the car chase.
The other scene is her breaking in to his hotel room to invite him to steal the mask by putting the magazine on his bed.  Anyway its a good Connery film and as close to James Bond as you can get if he became a thief.",1388620800,,878,4.075581395348837

My real interest and pleasure was to see Xeta-Jones make the whole scheme a winner. She a keen actress without getting too verbal about her glamourous beauty. She's one of my best five and right near the top. I'll save the other four for some other time. I liked the comparative love for one another and this was not her first time to beautifully handle age gaps. This is my favorite of several others I have at home but I still give them 5 stars for mostly the same reasons given to her. All that health stuff is mostly edge of the gutter overwritten for the waste basket IMO. She's going to be OK as long as she stays clean and that I full expect.

The story is tight, has some humor and imagination with something of an unexpected ending that I prefer. As far as I'm concerned a dash of romance fits SiFI, family feud, comedy, military, and even some of the high end series during the last 2/3 years. If you choose to check this impression -- take a look at one of other four I mentioned when she's close to Dr Who and only gets as far as like kiss after a pause that's tempting.

1053737,3,6305622825,"*** THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE BLU-RAY ISSUE ***

I have to admit to a guilty pleasure on this one - I've always liked the wonderfully cheesy ""Entrapment"" - especially the slightly odd yet very convincing chemistry between the young and beautiful Catherine Zeta-Jones and the old but still incredibly sexy Sean Connery. You genuinely feel that Connery fancies Jones and she likewise - and apparently that was the case. You can see that Connery actually likes and admires her and it gives the film a great dynamic - enjoying themselves rather than just grinning and bearing it.

Which is a shame, because I was hoping that this would be a decent buy on BLU RAY, but it isn't.

The principal reason is not the film itself (which is very entertaining), but the way it was filmed. There's a sort of filtered haze over at least 75% of the print (possibly hiding someone's age my dear?) that now looks even worse - accentuated by its transfer to the mercilessness of High Def. The picture isn't crap, but it's NOT 1080P DEFINED either - and it's absolutely NOT AN IMPROVEMENT over say a dirt-cheap DVD. ""Entrapment"" on BLU RAY looks murky and poorly executed most of the time - and for a film that was issued in 1999, that's just not good enough.

The Extra Feature is a commentary by Director Jon Amiel, but that's all (no making of, no interviews). Presentation is in Letterbox 16:9 (so it fills the full screen) and languages include French, Swedish, Danish, Finnish, Norwegian, Dutch and English For The Hard-Of-Hearing.

I'd say hire this before you buy it. In a slew of badly transferred movies to this great, but sometimes frustrating format, this is yet another sloppy reissue.

One to avoid I'm afraid.",1278201600,12,1701,4.691275167785235

Ginny Barker (Catherine Zeta-Jones) who worked for Waverly Security had a much larger goal in mind robbing the International Clearance Bank during the Millenium Celebratrion on New Year's Eve in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia but she needed help. She had been planning this event for a few years ... Hector Cruz (Will Patton) head of security had noticed she had no friends. She had no social life. She worked long hours doing statistical calculations and creating computer graphics examining all angles of the rooms and items her company insured and protected. He worried about her. She convinced Hector to let her attempt to catch and bring to justice the highly successful thief: McDougall (Sean Connery). He was a handsome foxy older gentleman, a wealthy Scotsman who had no need for the money but was a thief for the challenge of it. He was in the gallery where the Rembrandt was showcased during its opening exhibit, he was the likliest suspect. Hector was worried because two agents had previously disappeared trying to apprehend McDougall but Gin Barker convinced him because she was a woman ... she could do it. Despite misgivings, he gave her the chance to try.

Sean Connery played the aging gray haired foxy thief to perfection. He lived in Scotland, in a castle on an isolated island. He thought he had everything ... until he met Gin Barker. She followed him about in London, and watched him wander into a computer company, where he managed to steal five chips easily worth a million dollars each. She was exhausted as she returned to her hotel room, only to discover her luggage missing. She was too tired to report it immediately, pealed off her clothes and and prepared for bed ... totally naked because her dressing gown was among the missing items. She was shocked to discover someone staring at her in the dark. It was Mac (McDougall). He asked why was she following him around London. She then presented to him her grandiose plans. He mentioned his rules: ""first we try, then we trust"" and the corollary, ""it's strictly business"" ...

First he tested her and when she passed all his challenges, beyond his wildest expectations, he took her up on the job. They trained for the highest value monetary robbery of all time. This film appeals on multiple levels: it includes mystery, romance, tension, unexpected twists and turns in the plot and exotic locales, London, Scotland and Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The May - December romance and relationship which builds from total distrust, to mutual respect, to outright admiration is fun to watch. Catherine Zeta-Jones is believable, beautiful and in fantastic form as she executes gymnastic maneuvers that would make a Gold Medal Female Olympics Champion blush with pride. Sean Connery delivers a superb performance and also delivers outstanding one line responses to her confident approach. He says, ""I don't like surprises."" She replies, ""There won't be any."" He countermands, ""Trust me, there always are."" This is a highly enjoyable film and receives my highest recommendation for acting, story-line, plot development, action, and intrigue.

Connery and Zeta Jones are amazing in their roles, they give a very believable performance as thieves, of course helped by a sophisticated and well written plot and a perfect choice of music. The capers are very inventive and suggest an accurate research by the writers, even the romantic part is handled with such a grace that almost you don't see the huge age gap between the characters.

In this crime thriller Catherine Zeta-Jones plays Virginia Baker, an insurance investigator who is hot on the tail of Robert MacDougal (Sean Connery), a thought to be retired art thief.  As the story would go Virginia is somewhat of an art thief herself and enlists MacDougal's help in carrying out her master plan of stealing boatloads of money through wireless transfers on New Years Eve.  Sure the chemistry between Zeta-Jones and Connery is a bit of a stretch, but Connery is always suave and Zeta-Jones is as beautiful and intoxicating as ever before, and lets not forget Ving Rhames' `so-bad-he's-so-cool' Aaron Thibadeaux.

It is oddly uneven: parts of it are not bad at all. The scenery is splendid. The technology is well above my head. Some of the action is quite exciting. Totally implausible, anything is possible,  particularly as it draws on almost every other suspense heist ever made. Some parts drag, others seem unnecessary. The whole thing doesn't gel, and in the end it's all too complicated to understand. Moreover, after all the strenuous work that Connery puts in, in the final scene he definitely looks as if he's had enough, and is just looking to put his feet up, and perhaps take a wee dram before hitting the sack. I wouldn't call Sean an introspective actor. He gets on with the job, and always turns in a reliable performance, but the only part which fitted him like a glove, and which he seemed truly to have enjoyed, was the role he played in The Man who would be King.

HE:  You sound surprised.

SHE:  No, it's just not what I expected.

The dialogue doesn't get much better in ""Entrapment"".  She also says ""Wow!"" a lot, generally expressing herself with a teenager's vocabulary (and impetuosity), which seems to indicate a more intuitive, spontaneous thinking process than one might expect from a highly intelligent and methodical art thief.  He, on the other hand, mutters and grunts his observations in as thick a Scottish brogue as he can muster.  He's the organization man to her acrobat, explaining the basic ground rules of thievery, such as ""Never trust a naked woman"".  This will, needless to say, lead to some awkwardness in their partnership, culminating in a tussle which ends with him backing out on the grounds that ""My situation is just too complicated.""  (War injury?  Forgot his Viagra?  We can't be sure.)  If you're looking for romantic tension, try ""Roman Holiday"".  If you're looking for a convincing heist scene, ""Revenge of the Pink Panther"" does as good a job, with humor as a bonus.

1053964,5,6305622825,"This is a terrific latter day thriller that brings to mind the work of Hitchcock.  The plot twists are clever yet plausible.  The motives of the main characters and true identities are shadowy which adds to the intrigue of the film.  The film looks terrific and the action and stuntwork are excellent.  The film is anchored by two dynamic performances by Sean Connery and Catherine Zeta-Jones.  At the time much was made of the age difference between the two(Connery was 67 and Zeta-Jones was 29) but the chemistry between the two makes it a non-factor.  Connery, in probably his last film that required grueling physical exertion, shows that in the twilight of a storied career that he won't go quietly into the night.  This was Zeta-Jones' second American film. In her first, ""The Mask of Zorro"", she was good but her role there did not have the heft of ""Entrapment"".  Aside from her natural beauty that just explodes on screen she more than holds her own with Connery.  There is a mystique to her character, an insurance investigator who is out to ensnare Connery's thief.  Good supporting turns are also given by Will Patten as Zeta-Jones' co-worker and Ving Rhames as an associate of Connery's.  If I recall the reviews at the time of the film's release it was generally dismissed as a slick thriller.

1053966,4,6305622825,"I admit the first time I saw this I wasn't impressed, but I just saw it again a few nights ago and really enjoyed it. I have always admired Sean's skill and presence...What's interesting and a little  iffy is that he plays a ""likeable bad guy"". His appeal is present in force but I think they could have casted the female lead much better, Jones is no where near the caliber Sean is. I don't like the Bond films...even the ones with Sean, because they are SO predictable and flimsy. Now, usually I like a story with depth and backstory which this one simply doesn't have. Nonetheless, it is enjoyable all the same.

I admire that there is no sex scene (I plain don't like them; but that's not to say that Sean has lost his sex appeal, he hasn't! And please give the guy a break about his age and the fact that he's slowin' down a bit...I think anyone of his age would.)

1053967,3,6305622825,"We are introduced early in this movie to someone whole steals a valuable Rembrandt Van Rijn painting.  We do not see this person because the person is wearing a mask.  Insurance investigator Virginia Baker (Catherine Zeta-Jones) tells her boss that she thinks Robert ""Mac"" MacDougal (Sean Connery) stole the painting.  Her boss tells her that she has blamed MacDougal for half the thefts committed for a period of time I no longer recall.  The beginning of this movie sounds very similar to ""The Thomas Crown Affair.""  Fear not, this movie has more twists than that movie, to which is bears only a few similarities.  This movie is much more like ""It Takes a Thief,"" though you may not realize how much until you reach the end.

Baker begins following Mac around, ostensibly to find some clue as to where the Rembrandt painting might be.  However, we soon learn that Baker has something much bigger in mind.  Things become even more interesting when Baker reveals to Mac that she stole the Rembrandt, and she used a clever, non-obvious way of getting the painting out of the building.  Soon we learn that there is even more to the theft of the Rembrandt.  I know I was surprised.

What happens next is a sort of competition, where we see Baker and Mac continuing to try to outdo each other.  If you are not paying attention it is easy to get lost in who is doing what and when they are doing it; thus the advantage of DVDs where you can keep stepping back a chapter or so to try and digest the complexity of this movie.  Eventually the plot reveals that Baker has a plan to steal a huge (billions) sum of money by breaking into a computer.  The plan involves very fine timing that has to coincide with the millennium (of course, otherwise there would be no sense of urgency).

Once things get set into motion the movie moves forward briskly.  There is getting into the building, the timing of breaking into the computer, and the nasty mistake that sends dozens of people chasing after them.  It is all good fun up until someone gets caught.

This movie tends to get polarized reviews.  I think mostly it is about your expectations.  If you like Sean Connery and Catherine Zeta-Jones, and try to avoid analyzing action movies very much, then you would probably like this movie.  On the other hand, if you do not care for either actor, or you spend too much time realizing that there are a number of continuity problems and implausibilities sprinkled throughout the movie, you will likely be too focused on those and disappointed that the director was hoping you would like his cleverness in spite of the fact that much of the plot was impossible.

In balance, I should note that Christopher Young received a BMI Film Music Award in 2000 for this movie.  Catherine Zeta-Jones won a Blockbuster Entertainment Award for Favorite Actress - Action.  Both Catherine Zeta-Jones and Sean Connery won European Film Awards Audience Awards for Best Actress and Best Actor.  In addition, Ving Rhames was nominated for the Blockbuster Entertainment Award for Favorite Supporting Actor - Action, and the Motion Picture Sound Editors of USA nominated the movie for a Golden Reel Award for Best Sound Editing for a Foreign Feature.  To keep things in perspective, Catherine Zeta-Jones was also nominated for the Razzie Award for Worst Actress and Zeta-Jones and Connery were nominated for the Razzie Award for Worst Couple.

As for me, once I realized that the movie had too many implausible situations, I just enjoyed the plot and tried to figure out what was what.  I also must point out that I have liked Connery in nearly every movie he has starred in.  He has a lot of charisma.  I also like Zeta-Jones, though she has much less talent than Connery.

I must admit that the ending puzzles me just a little.  It seems to me that there came a point where the director made something happen, and ignored the trivial problem that what he did was impossible.  I think he was hoping that people would like the end of the movie so much that they would not notice the problem.  Unfortunately, nearly everyone noticed.  Fortunately for the director, many people did not care.",1120953600,2,4152,4.68646408839779

I don't really understand why there's some questionable reviews about this DVD, but everyone has their own opinion I guess. I found it to be quite a fast paced movie, although I'm not keen on Sean Connery (Mac). I don't like the spelling of the name :) and the only reason they had to bring in Catherine Zeta Jones (Gin) is because he's getting on a bit now! I'm always going to be a bit iffy about Catherine, as her accent is so WEIRD now, and she reverts back to her Welsh accent, particularly when she wants people to believe she's still the same little Welsh girl that starred in Darling Buds Of May. I don't think so! She keeps saying ""combuder"" instead of ""computer"". Watching her struggle with the name Kuala Lumpur in half-Welsh-half-American is genuinely funny.

Both actors do a great job of portraying their characters. Sean Connery does a brilliant eye roll a lot of the time, and is probably the only actor who can get away with saying ""If I'm late, I'm dead"".

The film is shot in Kuala Lumpur, what looks like Scotland, and London, I think. The Scotland scenery looks lovely, very peaceful and remote. The building used for exterior shots of Mac's safe house (Castle Duart on the Isle of Mull) is the ancestral home of the Chief of the Clan MacLean.

I love the whole stealing of precious items, it's so weird how much thought & work actually goes into it during the film. And you're always holding your breath, waiting for them to hit a laser, or for a security guard to spot them.

The finale to this, I will NEVER understand, no matter how many times I watch it! It's very subtle, highly original, and you're left guessing until the very last frame, and trying to search the screen! In this, there are double-crosses, triple-crosses and quadruple-crosses, enough to leave you spinning. Is he double-crossing her? Is she double-crossing him? Is Ving Rhames in this for anything other than hard cash, and lots of it? Considering he doesn't have much of a role, and he's not really who you think he is!

There's been a lot of comparisons to a movie called The Thomas Crown Affair. Sorry, but I haven't seen this, so I'm not likely to compare.

There's a lot of sexual chemistry between Catherine & Sean, although you'll be glad to hear, they never really get it on, and it's almost a paternal attraction on Sean's side.

Forget the negative reviews for this movie. You're not supposed to take this film at all seriously, you're supposed to be watching the pretty lady get herself into all kinds of positions (Michael Douglas must love that!) with some laser beams.",1098403200,6,2643,4.561181434599156

Still, much of what happens strains credulity even for film-goers. And what happened to all the other people? Would the FBI leave the platform so quickly? And the other passengers not come back?

Zeta is actually an insurance detective, Virginia Baker trying to find, the person responsible for a couple of burglary crimes in the area.
She suspects Mack (Sean Connery aka Robert MacDougal) is the person behind it, but rather than try to bring him in, she decides to get the man's confidence, and convinces him to try to pull of a big heist thus implicating Mac some more and
getting the evidence she needs to put him behind bars for a long time.
Mack is not an idiot, and he distrusts her from their very first meeting.
By the end of the film, one of the film will have pulled a great heist while the other
will either be in jail for a long time or worse. Their 2 contrasting styles in the movie, and their styles in pulling of different heists in the movie is really fun to watch.
The acting and special effects and stunts are also great including the culminating
climatic scene near the end where Mac and Virginia plot their big escape after
a heist.
There are some problems with the film however. Virginia is young and naive and
she takes the lies and garbage that Mac says at face value. Mac is not even a good
liar yet Virginia's character is dumb enough to believe this old thief'ss lies.
Now on to the dvd itself:
The DVD is very well done and contains a great
number of features:
* Deleted scenes
The deleted scenes in the movie are actually quite good, in fact, I think they were alot better than a couple of the scenes in the finished draft of the movie.
One great deleted scene is the car chase that Mack and Virginia get into while trying to dodge a couple of hitman that are tracking them down.
The scene has a great climax at the end that has you guessing what's going to happen next.
The scene is actually in the film, but what you get in the finished movie is actually
less than half of the original scene!!
Needless to say, I think this scene was great and should have been put in the original film.
Other features in the DVD include:
* Special feature on the making of the film
*Special commentary on the film itself
The commentary is teriffic, the director Jon Amiel, provides a lot of great insights and fact into the characters and Catherine Zeta herself, that fans may not
know.
*Alternate ending to the film!!!
The alternate ending in the film is actually very similiar to the original ending
with minor differences.
*Special trailers of the film
* Production Notes and much more!!!
Entrapment from head to toe is one of the best heist/thriller movies in quite a long time.
It gets predictable in a couple of areas, but the film is entertaining from beginning to
end.

What matters is if the pair work well together, and Catherine and Sean are great together. By the way they never actually hook up, but if they had, it would have been very intense. The chemistry between the 2 was very evident to me throughout the entire movie, I was egging on a romance. But Sean's character is above the physical involvement level with partners, so Catherine is held at bay. The movie reminded me of a classic thriller, a movie loaded with action...but thank God, not an ""action movie"". Enough of a hint at romance to keep us gals interested...but certainly not a romance. And on top of everything it was smart and well done. It took me on lots of twists and turns, and I loved them all.

I have to say that ""The Rock"" is probably a more thrilling movie, and slightly less typical than ""Entrapment"". This film, while being intriguing and entertaining, throws back to Connery as James Bond. His sophisticated style and wit are humorous and convincing in this action flick. However, similar to ""The Rock"", I absolutley feel that the cast in ""Entrapment"" is solid. It was filmed wonderfully, and there are some sultry scenes with Catherine Zeta Jones. And some of the landscapes, and open scenes are just amazing. Picturesque views of Connery's character's house, inside and out, are a definite highlight.

1)  NO SEX SCENES!  It is nice to see a movie that has great action, yet did not put in filth just to sell it.
2) A unique plot.  So many flicks are about the same thing, just done differently.
3) Great twists!  The movie kept you guessing until the end.  I kept wondering how it would end.  No, the good guys do not always win!
4) Good acting.
5) It kept a good pace through the entire movie.  I did not get bored by it being too slow nor did I get overwhelmed by it moving so fast that I could not keep track of what was happening.
Things that hurt the rating of the movie:
1) The use of the ""F"" word several times.  There was absolutely no need to add profanity to this movie, especially what I consider being hard core profanity.
2) A couple completely unbelievable and unrealistic scenes.  Stretch the imagination, but keep to things that can really happen.
Overall, this was a good movie with a good plot.  I would recommend this movie - especially if you have TV Guardian to filter out the few times of foul language.

Two great actors(Sean Connery and Cathrine Zeta-Jones) did a great job in this movie. There like good guy-bad guys! There bad guys that you like. The action is great, the plot line is good! I still haven't told you much about the movie either than it's good! Well, their both stealers, who steal a bunch of stuff. The last is 8 billion dollars, at a world's largest bank. That was the best part of the movie. Alot of one line humours type of thing! I consider this to be one of my all time favourite movies, two thumbs up!!!",1019001600,2,621,4.408695652173913
1054090,2,6305622825,"After reading through other reviews of Entrapment I can't help but feel I saw the wrong movie. The version I saw was a never ending string of cliches embedded into a plot so flimsy it couldn't stand up if it were not for Sean Connery and Catherine Zeta-Jones. The direction of Jon Amiel was a never ending series of well worn manipulation techniques that were not even well done. I don't mind being a passive observer, but I do not like to be blatantly manipulated.
Several times during the movie I found it difficult not to laugh out load at the ludicrousness of what I was seeing. For example, in the well advertised scene of Catherine Zeta-Jones wriggling her way through the fake laser beams I couldn't stop thinking ""Why doesn't she just crawl"" or ""What was the point of that move?"" It's indicative of the whole movie. It's a scene played for the audience, and we aren't supposed to be there. In another scene between Sean Connery and Ving Rhames, Rhames scolds Connery for changing partners etc. Who is this scene for? We discover later in yet one more feeble plot twist that these two know this conversation is a sham, but rather than playing it out to further some clever hidden agenda it is solely to pull the wool over the eyes of the audience. And as I've stated before, the audience is not supposed to be there.
There are so many good caper movies... It is truly a disservice to the research that went into making those movies to add this fairy tale to the same genre... In short this movie was a waste of time and money.",1017100800,,1533,4.459074733096085
1054151,3,6305622825,"Entrapment is a good old-fashioned crime caper movie. The story of a master criminal playing cat and mouse with an investigator has been done a hundred times before, and sometimes better, as the remake of The Thomas Crown Affair. Still, this picture has enough humor, thrills and plot twists to keep most viewers pleasantly occupied for a couple of hours. It also has something most movies don't have -Sean Connery.
Mr., Connery, now nearing seventy years old, remains as elegant, wise and impish as ever. Perhaps this is because, unlike today's generation of male stars, he was never buffed, pumped up and made to look like a model in a media blitz for Nordic Track. Even as James Bond, he had a five o'clock shadow, body hair, and skin that was not deeply tanned all over. He has always been a star that we are comfortable and at home with.
As Robert MacDougal, art thief of thieves, Connery is, well, Connery. This role is hardly a stretch for him, but he plays it with his usual skill. MacDougal has gotten rich over the years and seems to pinch art treasures these days because he enjoys it. At the outset, we see him pull an especially spectacular heist, and soon, Virginia Baker, a beautiful insurance investigator, is on to him. She is played by Catherine Zeta-Jones, whose performance is not quite up to her usual standard. Virginia cleverly works her way into MacDougal's life and persuades him to help her with an even more incredible robbery. He doesn't trust anyone, but he is both amused and intrigued by Virginia. The plot gets more and more involved, and we spend a lot of time guessing who is fooling whom.
The movie's pacing is uneven, which causes it to bog down from time to time. In particular, the scenes in which MacDougal trains Virginia for the upcoming heist are too drawn out. These scenes are followed by some exciting stuff, but why the wait? This problem is especially prevalent in movies like Entrapment, because they start off in high gear. You can't then easily shift into low gear without losing the audience. Director Jon Amiel might have been wise to consider the style of three decades worth of James Bond movies. They don't just start with a bang, they are all one big two hour bang.
The violence quotient in Entrapment is low, which I am always glad to see. Perhaps more than sex, violence in movies should not be gratuitous. If it's essential to the plot, then fine. Otherwise, we all get the point with a minimum of bloodshed.",1016668800,,2467,4.647597254004577
1054152,5,6305622825,"It might be the subtitle for this highly entertaining action-thriller. In fact it's more a cat and mouse game... but who's the cat? In the best tradition of Hitchcock's ""To Catch a Thief"" it's a well balanced movie.
Sean Connery is in his top form when mixing duty with humor.
 Catherine Zeta-Jones is amazingly subtle in her role. She starts out cocky and glizzy only to end up being confused to the kazoo in her encounter with Connery.
This is a pure actioner, not a minute passes without a twist in the plot and nobody stands still for much too long.
There double-crosses, triple-crosses and quadruple-crosses,... well in fact, there are so many crosses one could become dizzy...
It's a harmless no-brainer, but so well acted and directed that you will be constantly gripping your armchair just to see what happens next.
The DVD edition is not top notch, but with a movie like this one who cares... You get engulfed into the action practically as the movie starts and the rollercoaster ride ends when the movie ends. So who's got the time to examine wether frame 121 was sharp enough or if that squeeky noise on the right channel was really perfect.
Once you enter in the game it won't let you loose one minute and you will almost shout at it to stop, but as Zeta-Jones, you will be dragged even deeper into the charade and be so fascinated by it that you won't want it stop once it does.
The finale is a pure surprise and, though not unexpected for a Hollywood movie, truly original.
If you like this kind of movies, this one is certainly for you and will keep you guessing to the end on the who does what to whom and why... but who is really what and does really what to whom? Have fun with it... and let the ride of your lifetime begin...",1014076800,14,1744,4.433021806853582

We're lucky to have CATHERINE ZETA-JONES ,who with her beauty makes it tolerable to watch. But maybe you're not a movie buff,and you just want to be entertained for 114 minutes after a hard day at work,then this is for you. Watch out,you might fall asleep on your couch.

1054155,5,6305622825,"This film appears to have been written pretty much to accentuate Zeta-Jones appeal, but there is much more to this film, and even in its sensual parts it really does keep itself quite well to what is needed to support the plot.
Three things in this movie really make it stand out.
The first is the plot.  There seems to be a hidden meaning to every scene, and to almost every scene a twist that brings us into a totally different spot.  It's like a wild roller coaster ride in the dark.
The second is the robberies.  It is amazing to watch the high tech devices in the hands of experts used to waltz through some of the most intricate security systems.  There are some minor slips in the robberies technically speaking, but nothing that destroys the film or even the robberies.
The third element is the chemistry between Zeta-Jones and Connery is extremely intriguing especially because of the age difference.  And who's to say that normal people don't do strange things like that all the time?
I'm tacking a fourth on here: In my opinion this film is the best work either Connery or Zeta-Jones has ever done.
Also if you are looking for a similar movie with real style.  Thomas Crown Affair appears to be essentially it's counter part.  The only real difference is I think Thomas Crown Affair over did every aspect of itself.",1003017600,,1326,4.569620253164557

But overall the film is quite intelligent and passably believable in the way it is carried out.

Sean Connery is not equalling his performances in Finding Forrester and The Untouchables, but he brings some fun to the part. Catherine Zeta Jones is fine, but this movie is supposed to be a fun old caper, and it lacks some of the flair that Crown had in excess. Whenever the two were stealing something the movie was fun, but it was just about a half-hour too long. It was okay, but so was the DVD. The deleted scenes had no audio, but the studio made the right choice cutting them. The alternate ending was the regular one with the mess of dialogue at the end deleted, which would have been better, I think. Anyway, if you have patience you will get a lot more out of this.

1054160,2,6305622825,"When this movie was originally released in theatres, I was warned not to see it on the big screen. I was told it was a bad movie, not worthy of watching. I didn't understand why so many people told me that; I mean the film has Sean Connery, contains a seemingly interesting plot, and Catherine Zeta-Jones. There was also a lot of discussion over the fact that Sean Connery was old enough to be Catherine Zeta-Jones' grandfather, yet he was playing her love interest. Luckily, I didn't see the movie in theatres and I am grateful for that.
ENTRAPMENT starts off on the right foot. The film's early scenes are interesting and demand attention. However, about thirty minutes later, the movie takes an unexpected twist into territory it should not have entered: romantic entaglement with bad dialogue and no chemistry. Even though Sean Connery is pushing 75, he's still considered by many to be one of the sexiest men alive.  Catherine Zeta-Jones is a beautiful young woman and attracts the eye of many men. Nevertheless, just because two people are physically attractive does not mean that there will be any chemistry between them. In this film the chemistry between Connery and Zeta-Jones is like the chemistry between the same sides of a magnet: instead of uniting, the two objects pull away from each other.  Of course, it doesn't help that the movie is full of bad dialogue and many of the emotional scenes of Zeta-Jones are totally forced with no reality or logic to them at all. The screenwriters should have kept to the basics instead of relying on dazzling special effects to save the film.
There are a few good action scenes, especially at the beginning. However, towards the end even those are so blown out of proportion that you begin wondering when the masked superhero will arrive that can match Connery's superhuman skills and foil his evil plans. Overall, ENTRAPMENT is a movie that had a lot of potential, but ending up getting entrapped by itself.",985824000,2,1961,4.798816568047338
1054199,3,6305622825,"Entrapment is one of the greatest action movies I have seen in a long while.  It's really too bad that that's really all that it is. The countless suspenseful scenes, and pulse-quickening action is so plentiful, that this movie has very little actual plot.  The plot that is there is shaky, and difficult to comprehend. Personally, it sounds like any other ""world domination"" story that is so oft repeated in Hollywood, but maybe I'm wrong. Anyway, the romantic subplot is far from romantic, and is very disjointed from the rest of the story. With the plot depth of an episode of The Flintstones, and the romance of an infomercial, this film is not really worth seeing unless you're craving a lot of action.

However, that's pretty much all this movie can sport: the story is weak and not very original (the ""Thomas Crown affair"" is the real thing and a much better movie overall) and the characters are not convinced about their roles (neither are we).  It is not the worst movie I've ever seen but it could be better.  Go for the other title (The ""TC affair"") if you haven't seen it already and enjoy!",972259200,,532,4.627659574468085

However, Catherine Zeta-Jones has emerged as the brunette version of positively and literally the most beautiful and majestic woman to ever grace the legendary Hollywood screen: Princess Grace Kelly. The presence and charisma of Sean Connery, of course, has always  transformed mediocre films into true spectacles.  Now, delicately introduce the tender and multi-talented Zeta-Jones, and you enjoy a relationship that combines the eloquence of James Stewart and Donna Reed (""It's A Wonderful Life"") with the mesmorizing qualities of Elvis Presley and Ann Margaret (""Viva Las Vegas"").  At this point, if you can possibly manage to persuade your brain to overlook some far fetched and perhaps ill conceived plot twists, you're probably ready for the home stretch: A razzle dazzle conclusion with gut wrenching suspense and cool special effects.  There is something sleek and silky smooth about this DVD production and its main characters that defies description. If you seem to like what you're hearing (and seeing) so far, trust me: This special DVD version is worth its weight in gold.  But for heavens sake, what's up with ""Suave Sean"" slurring his ""s"" words and butchering the ""r"" sounds??

She needs to be  extremely sure, however, as together they plan the heist of the millennium  from the sickening height of one of the tallest buildings in the  world....

1054204,4,6305622825,"Watching a Sean Connery film is a form of escape.  This film is certainly  that.  Entrapment  takes you out of the humdrum into a life of  sophisticated crime.  Elegant art works,  computerized finance, exotic  locations and unusual people.  Big Tam always manages to  provide rich wit,  delivered effortlessly with his particular charm.  Here, he's partnered  with  insurance investigator Zeta-Jones as they weave through an bizarre  array of heists, each  building from one to the next.  The ultimate goal  must be achieved in a specific time and  place.  The finale is inevitable,  but given Connery's film history, not disappointing nor  surprising.
Big  Tam has developed an inexplicable ability to draw out the best of his film  partners.  In his  only truly serious film, Medicine Man, he brought a  lustre to Lorraine Bracco not seen in her  other films.  Entrapment  displays Catherine Zeta-Jones as more 'alive' than any of her other  films.  Anthony Hopkins could only use her as decoration in Zorro, but against  Connery, she  presents a wider range of expression.  Still appearing a bit  constrained, she's at least  competent in this role, if not  outstanding.
Entrapment almost seems one of a new genre of Connery type  roles.  The Rock, Medicine  Man, Hunt for Red October and this film present  him as the devious outcast who makes  good.  It's not a bad type, although  one wonders what the insurance companies think of  presenting us with such  a successful thief always going scot-free.

Catherine Zeta Jones fitted the role of an insurance investigater leading a double life, very well indeed being subtle and athletic thoughout, she breathed life into the film. Having talked about the actors, the film seemed to wallow too much with many of the scenes taking place in some castle in scotland. They ought to have dotted around a bit to keep things interesting. Still, there some scenes (not enough) which contained real suspense and thrilling action. The ending was entirly unconvincing and unrealistic. Although i didn't see it coming, it wasn't in the least bit likely, considing the complete lack of chemistry between the lead actors throughout the film.
This, in my opinion is what killed the film, the lack of relationship other than profesional. Mac even put Gin down when she suggested it. In a way it would have been difficult having a romantic intrest because Connery is old enough to be Zeta Jones' grandfather.
In conclusion I would say that if you are a die-hard Connery or Zeta jones fan, then it is worth a rent for a mediocre performance by good actors and a topical story line, watch it once then make up your own mind.",967507200,,1380,4.802521008403361

The plot is slow and  too static, the movie tends to stick in one location (an old house in the  middle of nowhere) while Connery and Zeta play cat-and-mouse games of  betrayal. There are a few good moments, not knowing who is the bad guy (or  girl) in this movie makes it a little more exciting, but the big question  is WHY?

1054251,2,6305622825,"The ""heist"" plot has been a staple of movies down through the decades, including such films as ""Rififi,"" ""Topkapi,""  ""Gambit,"" ""How to Steal a Million,"" ""The Hot  Rock"" ad infinitum. In most cases, the object of the carefully crafted  theft usually involved priceless jewels or artwork. In the latest  installment, ""Entrapment,"" there are indeed valuable tangible  works to be lifted, but, in the style of true '90's thievery, the real  goldmine lies in the more abstract vein of computer banking and currency  transfer. Alas, the aptly named ""Entrapment"" falls into a trap of  its own making, gussying up a hopelessly conventional script with a display  of impressive computer hardware and eyeboggling gadgetry in a vain attempt  to overcome dull, barely believable characters and a script totally devoid  of the cleverness and wit necessary to carry this sort of story off.
Sean  Connery and the beautiful Catherine Zeta-Jones portray accomplished thieves  who, after a customary skirmish of mutual doubt and suspicion, decide to  steal first a priceless Chinese mask and then $8 billion from the Southeast  Bank in Koala Lampur. To give the film's its patina of contemporary  relevance, the script inserts timely references to Y2K and the millennial  bug - all to no avail. For unfortunately, Connery and Zeta-Jones, though  both very charismatic stars in other circumstances, do not register high on  the credibility scale here. It is hard to believe that this doddering dolt  and this whiny, weepy fashionplate could possible concoct, let alone carry  out, such elaborate heists and even gravity-defying stunts. Even less  believable are the romantic interludes between this 60-year old man and  this 20-something year old woman. The scenes in which Connery trains Jones  to perform elaborate tricks of physical dexterity are dull and cutesy - and  the final scene of reconciliation (at an empty train station) is so  hopelessly contrived that the filmmakers seem to have thrown all logic out  the window and allow the characters to perform feats that actually defy the  laws of physical possibility.
The basic purpose of ""Entrapment""  seems to have been to allow two likable actors the chance to cavort in a  myriad of eyepopping settings and to dazzle the audience with the latest in  technocyber hardware. It's too bad that the less techno value of a solid  script driven by smart dialogue and well developed characters was not  downloaded into this film as well.",964396800,,2471,5.159090909090909

The movie is extremely better than 2 1/2  stars, it's about insurance investigater Jin (Cathrine Zeta Jones) who is  facinated about famous theif Mac (Sean Coneray) when a famous rembrant is  stolen from a client she claims it was him and that she can seduce him into  telling all.
Her boss who has a crush on her assigns her the job. While  she claims to be a theif herself they join together to steal an ancient  Chineese mask.  The movie leads to the robbing of 8 billion dollars in a  Kaula Lumpour bank.

The Plot first of all was different because they  started out with the Theif using some kind of special machine to lower them  below this 40 story building to a window. The machine that the thief used  had me thinking ""Is stuff like this really around?"". Sean and  Cathrine take being a theif to the next level with the high tech gagets and  cool escape moves. A good example is when cathrine was training to slip  through the laser beams for the alarm system. Even though it's a  movie......to think someone would be able to do this and even seeing it  just makes u think. This movie has many twits and what you think in the  begining will change quickly as u get to the middle and end of the movie.

Entrapment has Catherine Zeta Jones (Zorro) playing an insurance investigator (ooh, scary!) on the trail of Connery the master thief.  Ving Raimes (Mission Impossible) hoins in an all too minor role.  The plot is full of twists, and there is really some genuine excitement during the chase scenes, but I couldn't help but feel I've seen all this before and better (see Sneakers). The sexual tension between Connery and Jones is also excellent until it turns into something which left most of the group I saw it with crying out, ""He's old enough to be her grandfather!"" No points for grossing out the audience.  The film is a good popcorn muncher, but if you're low on cash, save your money for the money for The Mummy or Star Wars instead.

This movie is hardly worth the low price amazon is asking, Sean Connery once again plays a fast witted, cool cat who lives in a castle of all  places and is rich, thats a stretch huh. I saw the castle and said, o.k.  he's the big bad world crook and he has all this mad money, i'm not big on  foreign country policies but i'm sure scotland, ireland or whatever  European country this castle is in has something similar to the IRS. He's a  well known crook yet no one has bothered to ask how the heck can he afford  to live in the castle with all this rare expensive stuff?

Like every action flick,  it leans toward the unrealistic, especially a scene in which they're  dangling from a 78-floor building, but that's what makes it fun to  watch.

One can't help  thinking that placing Catherine Zeta-Jones at his disposal, so to speak,  must have acted as something of a stimulant. They make a great pair.
If  adventure is all you are after, it's here. If travel interests you, even  the armchair variety, you've got that too. If stunts are needed, there are  one or two of those.

First, it involved a theft of a painting and a insurance  worker trying to catch the crook- second it involved a secret hideaway (a  castle instaed of a place by the beach as in TCA) and finally some good old  fashioned double cross.
What made this movie stand out was the fact that  it did not revolve around the theft of one item, but at least 3 different  ones.  The action scenes were better and I feel the acting was better  also.
The odd thing about both movies was the fact that the main  characters both played James Bond and now there are breaking the law-  ironic.  This is a good and fun filled movie.",956966400,,839,4.301282051282051

The first (and best,in my opinon),007, does his usual  competent job of acting, adding a definite touch of professionalism here.  There has been some criticisms of Zeta-Jones' acting, which I think is  unfair.  Her parts, so far, have consisted of mostly  ""window-dressing""so she hasn't really been given a chance to  stretch. Her acting here is certainly ""meets the requirements""  and her beauty is undeniable.

Sean Connery is, of course, a classic.  He makes bad  movies good and good movies better.  Catherine Zeta-Jones is simply the  most beautiful actress in Hollywood today (nice to see a girl with a  full-figure, as opposed to, say, Gweynth Paltrow).  The supporting cast is  interesting as well, but Ving Rhames must be sick of playing the  heavy.
As for the film itself, the plot is fairly entertaining, with  crosses and double-crosses until the last reel.  The highlights here (and  the reason I enjoy the film) are,  of course, the theft sequences, and they  are beautifully directed and edited.  Even if you hate the film, the  mask-heist will grab you.
The new DVD special-edition is a marked  improvement over the old one- the new anamorphic transfer is flawless and  the extras (while still a bit slim) are good.  I especially enjoyed the  director's dry humor on the commentary track.

1054392,3,6305622825,"As much as ""The Thomas Crown Affair"" surprised me with its exciting plot and charismatic lead actors, ""Entrapment"" disappointed me. Here's why-
The plot is a little clunky- a heist in  Kuala Lumpur (for the geographically illiterate, that is in Malaysia) that  can only be pulled off at midnight of December 31st, 1999 because of the  Y2K computer glitch. Interesting, topical, and a little too expository at  times for my taste. I was genuinely surprised by the trick ending to  ""The Thomas Crown Affair"". I didn't see it coming and yet it was  entirely believable. I didn't buy the trick ending to  ""Entrapment"". I did sort of see it coming, and it wasn't  believable. Too left field for my liking.
Much was made of the casting of  this movie- since Sean Connery is old enough to be his co-star's  grandfather. Personally it didn't bother me too much- Connery is still the  epitome of the action star and still has the intensity and passion to carry  a film all by himself. I hate to say it, but the problem I have with this  movie is with Catherine Zeta-Jones, Connery's costar. Zeta-Jones is a  stunningly beautiful woman who looks very good here, and also, in this film  at least, is a stunningly bad actress who hits all of the wrong notes and  is not believable in her role.
What else? I liked Ving Rhames. Always an  actor with a presence, he does a good job here. Otherwise this movie was a  profound disappointment- from Zeta-Jones's performance, from the slow  action scenes, from the bad dialouge, this movie left me wanting. Too bad.",950486400,,1546,4.659259259259259

One  of the greatest titles of ""99"" and one that all action/suspense  and indeed Connery fans should have in their collection.  Great viewing for  all.",948067200,2,730,4.279411764705882
1054454,4,6305622825,"I know:  many viewers resented the apparent lack of physical chemistry between the characters played by Connery and Zeta-Jones.  Most of them had vivid memories of Sean Connery playing the always charismatic 007, and  Catherine Zeta-Jones exchanging sparks with Antonio Banderas in The Mask of  Zorro. But is chemistry between a man and a woman just, physical, sensual,  and sexual ?  I find the movie entertaining, as it shows 2 people  enjoying doing what they like best - no, I am not saying you should do the  same thing ! - but as it happens in life, people perform so much better  when they really like what they do.  The chemistry is between Zeta-Jones  youth, outgoing passion for life and Connery's less evident, more inward  quest for adventure which is backed up by his wisdom and longtime  experience.  As they go about doing and accomplishing things together, the  old man develops respect and acknowledges the younger woman's worth.  Slowly he starts to like her and, despite his age, or, perhaps because of  his age, he feels that, to a certain extent he cares for her.  While, at  the same time, she turns from intellectually admiring him to actually  liking him on her side. Admittedly, it is an uneasy chemistry between  Connery, the Scott gentleman and Catherine, the Welsh with long brown hair  and eyes, but the film offers enjoyable action moments interspersed with  occasionally good dialogue and exchanges between the two leads.  Watch and  enjoy the movie, as I did, for what it is not for what it is not !",948067200,5,1531,4.773946360153257

1054456,5,6305622825,"This movie is breathtaking. I was completely expecting yet *another* millennium-based,  end-of-the-world film...however I was pleasantly surprised, and impressed. The millennium does play a huge role, but I don't  mind, because it's for an original, ""impossible but doable""  cause. Just think: $8 billion. I would tolarate the millennium cliche for  $8 billion...especially since the way in which Gin and Mac do it is  unbelieveable!
The scenes themselves are incredible. You could probably  watch a few individual scenes by themselves and get a pretty nice thrill,  they're so great. I was completely hooked after the first two minutes of  the opening sequence. (That was cool. Just cool.) And then there is the  rather (in)famous part in which we have Gin prancing around, blindfolded,  between rows of red yarn. Now that was classic...and possibly the most  erotic, no-touching-involved scene that I have seen in my life. (The music  in that scene is great--suspensful, heart-wrenching. The soundtrack in  general is great for this movie.) And when they pull off the actual  break-in, that's even better! And of course, who can forget the incredibly  sweet scene near the end where Gin and Mac get in a dancing position and  waltz their way through the lazer beams? The entire climax of the movie  itself is breathtaking. Ingenius.
The plot is yet another perk. I mean, I  so thought I knew how this movie was going to end. Of course, it did end  the way I thought it would (it's a good ending. I'm glad it turned out that  way), but thing is, there were so many unforseeable twists and turns in the  story, that by the time we actually get to the end, it doesn't seem nearly  so predictable anymore. This is your classic cat-and-mouse movie where the  hunter becomes the hunted and vice versa. I like Gin's strong girl  character (hey, scaling the side of a steel support beam in highheels is  enough to make me go wow) and I like how the plot keeps you on your toes.  You never know just who is who until the end. Entrapment is definately  going on in this movie, by everyone to everyone! Deception...I love  it.
Buy this movie. It's sexy, clever, and unpredictable, with some great  one-liners. It is, in a word, ""perfect.""",947894400,,2229,4.822751322751323

1054511,5,6305622825,"Great movie for anyone who likes the lure of criminal activities. One thing I'd like to clear up is the definition of anamorphic. One of the most confusing terms of DVD has to be the anamorphic 16x9 enhancement. DVD has  the capability to store a lot more image information than your regular TV  set can display, even though not all discs actually support this feature.  So called 16x9 anamorphic TV sets (so can computer monitors if you're using  a DVD-ROM) can use this additional information to create a higher  resolution image, resulting in a much sharper and more detailed picture.  Since 16x9 screens have a widescreen ratio themselves, they do not have to  bother about the black bars at the top and bottom of a widescreen movie and  can thus stretch the image to use the full height of the display. If your  TV does not support 16x9 enhancements, the movie will simply be displayed  in widescreen. Also anyone who is a Gillian Anderson (Scully from the  X-Files) fan I recommend the movie ""The Turning"". If you like  Gillian you won't be disappointed.

Even the use of the high tech equipment was easy to  follow in Entrapment... Catherine Zeta-Jones is definitely a gorgeous and  sensual woman with a lot of class. She strongly resembles the classic  Hollywood beauty reminiscent of Vivian Leigh from Gone With The Wind and  other Hollywood sexy sirens of the 30's, 40's, and 50's. What's amazing  about Jones is how she can switch off or un-do her thick Welsh-European  accent in any movie and convert over to either American or Mexican (Zorro);  Talk about ironing out your natural accent. Sean Connery is still Mr. Cool  or Slick when it comes to any role he plays; He exudes a lot of confidence  and sophistication; Connery is an example of what a true gentleman should  be like(smooth and suave, especially with the ladies). I'll admit his  character was a bit rough with Jones' in the beginning; all for good  reason, though. I more than highly recommend this movie for its polished (  yet, not too polished) ensemble of characters, story, plot, twists and  turns of excitement and intrigue ! The only mentionable annoyance was  toward the end at the train/sub station with the characters hide and go  seek exchanges.

1054566,3,6305622825,"I called Entrapment ""lopsided"" because its first act is a complete bust, confusing and uninteresting, but its final sequences make for very effective action filmmaking.
Skipping the fact that this movie  is trying to generate heat between two actors two generations apart  (30-year-old Catherine Zeta-Jones and 70-something Sean Connery), this  movie succeeds on quite a few levels -- and falls flat on others.
It was  surprising for me to discover that the script was co-written by Ron Bass.  For the first 30 minutes are utter chaos -- not giving the audience the  information it needs, stingy with exposition, and quite frankly badly  scripted, staged, and acted.  Catherine Zeta-Jones comes alive onscreen,  though, once she is paired with Connery -- faced with the task of matching  Connery's legendary screen presence, she faces up to the task admirably,  projecting charisma and a good degree of emotional authenticity.  Not a  great performance, but a solid one.  Connery waltzes his way through  another not-so-challenging but fun performance.
The execution of the  dramatic scenes as well as the set-ups for the scenario were very poorly  done by Jon Amiel (Copycat).  However, Amiel redeems himself partially by  the slam-bang last half hour of the film, where suspense and tension are  both high and the stunts have a degree of freshness to them.

SC's Scottish castle filled with his stolen art was a  nice touch.  It moved into Mission Impossible mode which was pretty cool,  but then it turned into a Die Hard wannabe where it lost all dignity.  There was a lot of high tech coolness to it and enough twists and turns to  make your head spin.  It had a couple of chances to reedeem itself but it  let them pass by.

She's stunning to look at even when she comes up from a swim with  full makeup on, but she has a hard time giving any lines with punch.  The  movie dragged in some parts, but was entertaining overall.  The  Connery/Zeta-Jones love interest wasn't believable or very well developed.

Characters drop a game-changing statement into the middle of a sentence, then they hardly talk about it again.

The biggest downfall though is the implausibility of the age gap. Sean Connery is foxy at any age, but for the first half of the film they have a mentor/student dynamic that almost seems parental. So when it gets romantic, it feels incredibly uncomfortable and forced. The whole film would have worked much better with a smaller age gap.
