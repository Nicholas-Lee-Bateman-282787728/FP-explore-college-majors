1871374,5,B00008YLVB,"Ah, those unforgettable words...especially poignant since they were said to me by Steve Forrest (Hondo)a number of times.  Yep, I played T.J. McCabe in the original series, the guy with the bolt action scope rifle who'd climb up on high places (technically the sniper was called the ""high man""), yank my cap around and try to emulate Steve McQueen's smooth moves with guns.  So it's a real gas to see the original 13 come out on DVD...especially because I never had good copies of the originals!
SWAT was a great experience, with a bunch of great guys.  We were surprised when they cancelled the show...it had been doing great, #1 all summer...then ABC switched it to try to win another night...good old network TV wisdom...and we lost our audience.
The scuttlebutt around the 20th Fox lot was that Aaron Spelling hated the show...it wasn't what he felt his name should be associated with...you may remember he went on to do Family and Dallas after that...so he allegedly swapped us out for Starsky and Hutch, which was a more character-driven show.  Can't say I blame him...the writing got pretty stale pretty quick, because at least one of the line producers would take good scripts and turn them around to focus on Hondo and also dumb 'em up in favor of action, whereas we kept hoping they'd give us more of a shot at a Rookies-style, character-strong program.
We did have a lot of fun in that short 35 episodes...and I was particularly happy to find out that Rod Perry (Deke), whom I believed, thanks to a story Mark Shera (Luca)told me in the mid-80s, had died of a heart attack way back then, is in fact still very much alive!
But still sad that my old pal Bob Urich (Jim Street in SWAT, Dan Tana in Vegas, Spencer in Spencer for Hire)is gone for real.  He was a good and good hearted man.
The only bummer about the new movie is that at least a couple of the guys from the old show did brief cameos in the flick, but since I live in NY, and the casting agent told me there was no real effort to include all of us anyway as in a reunion scene, I got left out of the movie.  That was a little disappointing, I would have loved to do a bit in it, especially since they reprised our original character names (and made my character into a bad guy!)  Well, that's Hollywood for you.
Best news is I'm happy to hear our old fans are still out there and rooting for good over evil on the streets of L.A.  Thanks for still digging the show, everybody!
your ever-lovin', crime-fightin' T.J.

1871375,5,B00008YLVB,"I just finished the 13th episode and I am hoping someone somewhere releases the 2nd and final season of S.W.A.T. Like every good show in the 1970's and early 1980's, you got into the show, even though it may have not had good production value, after you heard the THEME music! I am a child of the 1970s and I am buying EVERYTHING I can find from that era and this is a MUST BUY. I didn't buy my copy from Amazon but I am buying up everything I see on this site. The only thing missing here is a DVD for Wonder Woman and Stone Cold Steve Austin, the 6 million dollar man!",1060300800,,570,4.008771929824562
1871376,5,B00008YLVB,"I truely believe that this show is what started ""Police shows"" for television. This was my favorite show as a kid and I have been waiting for decades for this to come out on DVD. It was a great show then, (and if you can get passed the 70 genre) it is still a great show today. It is somewhat amazing at how much the world has changed over the years, but crime and the way the police deal with it has not. I testament to this show it the motion picute that is coming out soon...""SWAT"".",1059350400,,485,4.010309278350515
1871377,4,B00008YLVB,"A long overdue release of a popular series which suffers from one major flaw.
The Pilot Episode which aired the same year as a 2 hour episode of the Rookies has not been included.  This was a terrible oversight which I hope will be remedied with inclusion in subsequent releases.",1058227200,,279,4.58
1871378,5,B00008YLVB,Wow seeing the series again brought back so much. It was like I was watching it on the T.V. screen again. Beautifully remastered. Well worth every cent.,1057881600,,152,4.666666666666667
1871379,3,B00008YLVB,"In the mid 70's, cop shows flourished on network TV.  From the start, SWAT (Special Weapons And Tactics) was a controversial entry into ABC's primetime lineup.  The Spelling/Goldberg production was harshly criticized for being too violent.  And near thirty years later, this remains a program that requires parental monitoring.  This is not for kids.
The testosterone rich SWAT team, is headed by Steve Forrest, as ""Lt. `Hondo' Harrelson"".  Confident, and capable, he inspires loyalty and molds the team to his will.  Rod Perry is speedy ""Deacon Kay"", his second in command, and pointman.  Springboarding from his role as a renegade cop in the film ""Magnum Force"", Robert Urich is officer ""Jim Street"".  Small but street tough, baby-faced Mark Shera is sure to charm the ladies, as ""Dominic Luca"".  Rounding out the team is James Coleman as ""TJ McCabe"", the team's sharpshooter.  These guys mean business, when they turn their caps around.
The adrenaline begins to flow, as the SWAT van rolls out in response to a call.  The van doors swing open, and the team hits the ground running, with flak vests on and weapons in hand, scaling to the top of buildings, repelling down walls, moving into position, and taking cover.  The team is called on to deal with ruthless, and often psychotic criminals, motivated primarily by greed or revenge.  The violence is often taken to extreme and irrational levels, in order to justify SWAT's presence and deadly force response.  Anticipation builds, as once the team is in position, something is sure to break wide open.  Since there isn't much entertainment value in a peaceful surrender, a shootout invariably occurs.  Harrelson's team often does not follow realistic established police procedures.  Many times instead of containing a situation, and attempting to resolve things in a non-violent manner, the team actually initiates a violent confrontation.  The program usually has plenty of action, and some cool stunts, but also contains many inaccuracies regarding shooting techniques and the basic safe handling of firearms.  Pointing a weapon at someone, when there is no intention to shoot, is something that an officer trained in gun safety should never do.  Yet one of the team does this.  So don't expect too much insight into real SWAT tactics.  At times the team's actions seem more appropriate to a commando unit operating in a war, rather than as a police unit.  Just one standoff ends without violence.  And for some reason, women seem to get slapped around a lot.
The program does stress the standard law enforcement ideals of justice, teamwork, camaraderie, discipline and sacrifice, but that's certainly not anything new.  When the SWAT team is not involved in an active operation, they conduct investigations similar to regular police detectives, and engage in training exercises to keep sharp.
The thirteen episodes in the first season are presented on three DVD's.  Image quality is very good, though the quality of story writing is spotty, as realism is too often sacrificed in favor of the dramatic.  The episodes featured on Disc 2 emerge as probably being the best of the bunch.  Highlights include, ""Jungle War"", which stars Cameron Mitchell going over the top, as a renegade SWAT member.  ""Time Bomb"", an adventure in a movie studio, with Officer Street (the late Robert Urich) and his girlfriend (Heather Menzies, in real life the soon to be Mrs. Robert Urich), on the run from a group planting bombs.  ""The Steel Plated Security Blanket"", centers on a robbery attempt at a beauty contest.  Contestants include Loni Anderson, and future ""Angel"", Farrah Fawcett-Majors.  How dull the SWAT could be without the action and violence, can be seen in the episode ""Blind Man's Bluff"", where Harrelson becomes unfit to command the team because of an injury.
The episodes are formatted so that you can skip the opening credits, which features Rhythm Heritage's energetic theme song, but the remainder of the episode has no chapter stops.  If you want to jump ahead, you need to hit fast forward.  Not a very convenient arrangement.
Fans of 70's style police and crime dramas, comfortable with a raised level of violence, should consider this set.  Reasonably priced, SWAT The Complete First Season, does provide some excitement, and a pretty good ""bang"" for your buck.",1056326400,7,4324,5.085106382978723
1871380,4,B00008YLVB,SWAT was one of the first TV shows to throw off the ADAM-12 genre.  It came closer to the unpredictable world we live in.  Lots of action and weapons.  Bad guys gety it in the end and the good guys always come out on top.  The DVD tranfer seems pretty decent.

If you like wooden acting, predictable plots and really bad lines, this series is for you. If Mystery Theater 3000 ever takes on television shows this is a must.

1871504,4,B00008YLVB,"S.W.A.T was called up when tough cases could not be handled by the police. Steve Forrest,younger brother of movie star Dana Andrews heads the cast which included James Coleman,Rod Perry,Robert Urich (Vegas) and Mark Shera (Barnaby Jones).The first season was a mid-season replacement and only ran to 13 episodes. The pilot is not on this DVD.It was aired on a series called ""The Rookies"".
Season 2 of S.W.A.T has also now been released.
Unfortunately,this series was cancelled due to the pressures of the anti-violence lobby in the mid 70's. Plenty of gun play in this show.
Guest stars included:
Cameron Mitchell (Buck Cannon,The High Chaparral)
Mark Slade (Blue Boy,The High Chaparral)
Anne Francis (Forbidden Planet)
Leslie Neilson (Forbidden Planet)
Stuart Whitman  (Marshal Jim Crown,Cimarron Strip)
James Darrin (Dr Tony Newman,The Time Tunnel)
All the stories are fairly good but one called The Running Man stands out above the rest. It was a 96 minute episode and starred Stuart Whitman as an undercover cop who testifies against the mafia. Now he has to go on the run under an assumed name as the mafia are out to get him. He ends up in a small town run by a man named Fiske played by Forrest Tucker (F Troop) who is under the thumb of the mob  searching for Whitman. Will his cover be blown and will he survive?

1871534,4,B00008YLVB,"Tough but not swaggering, serious but not solemn, S.W.A.T. was a police drama that ran on ABC from February of 1975 to April of 1976 and won over its 1970s television audience with several unexpectedly interesting elements: A degree of storytelling sophistication; visually exciting, guerrilla-like street violence; and a subtle but determined fascination with the psyches of the show's 5 principal characters.

To a non-viewer, S.W.A.T. looked like a fatuously reassuring, law-and-order shill in the aftermath of the Vietnam war and Watergate. In reality, creator-producer Robert Hammer (a Peabody Award winner for the 1979 POW TV drama, When Hell Was in Session) managed to make an ideal, mid-'70s Aaron Spelling cop show with an extra emphasis on the human factor in peacekeeping.

Spun off from an earlier Spelling series, THE ROOKIES, S.W.A.T. was the story of Special Weapons and Tactics, an elite branch of the LAPD assigned the most critical cases of urban violence in an American era of cult terrorism, snipers, assassinations, traumatized war veterans, and organized crime.

Considering what the S.W.A.T. team is up against in every episode--shooters with sophisticated weaponry, psychotic revolutionaries, vulnerable takeover targets (nuclear reactors, etc.)--one might have expected the show to be swallowed up in gadgetry and fancy police protocol for extreme emergencies, but from the pilot (technically, a 2-hour Rookies episode not included in this set) on, S.W.A.T. was clearly much more interested in the way team leader Lt. Dan ""Hondo"" Harrelson (Steve Forrest), Sgt. David ""Deacon"" Kay (Rod Perry), and Officers Street (Robert Urich), Luca (Mark Shera), and McCabe (Jim Coleman) tried to understand the modern world even while keeping its meanest tendencies in check.

Inventive stories with occasional twists and appealing guest stars (Jim Keach, Cameron Mitchell, Annette O'Toole) keep one glued to the 13 episodes contained here. Among the best: ""A Coven of Killers,"" starring Sal Mineo as a Charles Manson-like monster; ""Jungle War,"" featuring Mitchell as a career cop and war vet facing an emotional breakdown; and ""The Bravo Enigma,"" an apocalyptic tale of a curiously likable hit man (Christopher George) unknowingly spreading a plague through L.A.",1389312000,,2275,5.528735632183908

See, back then we kids knew that this was just television. Unlike the kids of today,who are desensitsized to violence, we knew we weren't supposed to go out and kill people because of law and order wasn't disrespected like it is now. We knew if a SWAT team came to your area .... there was trouble. My teenagers can't get enough of all my 70's shows I play for them !!!! They love the historic, groundbreaking television shows I collect, and they love to see how a lot of my favorite actors got their start. And as a African-American male, I loved to see "" Deacon "" in there with his team, all of them respecting one another's talent,  and courage because at the end of the day, that's why you all went safely home. Aaron Spelling did a good job trying to represent every walk of life in all of his TV projects. And so much was taught to us by television back then, all of us true 70's kids know it did. I didn't like the SWAT remake at all. To a purist, it just was a bad copycat, hollywood fill in to keep up with the movie remake wave of that time. All of the original cast should have had a cameo in the movie, just like the ""Shaft"" remake that Samuel Jackson also starred in. Even the "" Starsky And Hutch "" remake had David Soul, and Paul Michael Glaser make a cameo in the end, but no ""Huggy Bear "". You should always pay homage to those who came before you. Quentin Tarintino did a excellent job in "" Jackie Brown "" with the two actors he adored, Pam Grier, and Robert Forster.

1871653,5,B00008YLVB,"Of all the programmes I can remember from my childhood this one has to come top of the list.

I can remember being woken by the iconic siren heralding the start of the reruns.  This was one of those late-night, post 11 o'clock, imported TV programmes; and I can remember sneaking downstairs at the first shriek of the siren that introduced the theme music at the start of the show.

The show followed the five men of the elite Special Weapons and Tactics unit (known as SWAT).  The team was led by Lieutenant Dan ""Hondo"" Harrelson (Steve Forrest); and he was ably assisted by officer Jim Street (the late Robert Urich), Sgt Deacon ""Deke"" Kay (Rod Perry), Officer Dominic Luca (Mark Shera) and Officer TJ McCabe (James Coleman).

This box set contains the 13 episodes that made up the first season.  There is no word on whether not the second season will be released.

SWAT was a series that was ahead of its time, and was originally cancelled because of its excessive violence - there was an objection to the use of guns and snipers in a police drama about a team that goes into ""situations too dangerous for even the police to handle"".

The series is only available on US region 1, however, this is not an embedded DVD box set so will play on a region two player - it is the equivalent of the region 0 or region free.

If like me you have vague recollections of this from your childhood then I can recommend this box set to you, though it is not as violent as many of the programmes that we see now it is still an outstanding series.",1266451200,2,1534,4.373239436619718

My older brother was allowed to watch it. I remember coming down to get a drink of water and my brother was watching TV and I asked him what he was watching and he said SWAT so I as I got my water I came back into the living room and watched it for a bit and was hooked. I loved the action and drama of the show... I ALSO DELEVOPED MY VERY FIRST CRUSH ON MARK SHERA (Dominic Luca).

I was only able to watch it for 10 minutes more because out came my mother and sent me straight to bed. I was so upset.

I always tried my hardest to sneak down and watch the show when both my parents were asleep. I didn't want to miss my Luca :[]

I don't have to do that anymore . I'm all grown up now and have the DVD and I'm enjoying watching every single episode. Brings back some nice memories.

They don't make action movies like this anymore. I don't know why it didn't last long on the air. It's a shame :(

1871696,4,B00008YLVB,"I grew up during the 1970s, watching a lot of TV crime shows, but never caught an episode of S.W.A.T.  Apparently, it ran for only one calendar year, spanning two TV seasons.  I ended up with the Season 1 DVDs by accident and only recently watched them.  I was very pleasantly surprised.  This was no silly, insubstantial Starsky & Hutch, another show I had not seen until recently but had a very different reaction to.

I do not remember seeing Steve Forrest in other shows or liking what I did see.  He made a believer out of me in his role on S.W.A.T.  He does a terrific job as the strong, smart, dedicated, professional leader of the team.  Rod Perry is also a stand-out.  As Forrest's highly skilled, trusted right-hand man, Perry has great chemistry with Forrest and is very good at playing both light and serious scenes (though the twang in how he says his boss's nickname ""Hondo"" can be distracting; and where does the nickname come from?  The bare-bones disk set, which does not even have chapter breaks within each episode, omits the pilot episode).  James Coleman conveys quiet strength and expertise as the team's sniper.

The professionalism, training, equipment, teamwork, and seriousness with which the men approach their work, reinforced by the dramatic opening and powerful theme music, capture the imagination.  In the show, the police engage in training exercises, test new machinery, are pro-active (as when an armored car is stolen and the team immediately begins trying to figure out how and where it might be used), and outsmart and out-maneuver, as well as out-gun, the villains.  The show uses the technique of featuring multiple crimes in one episode, which is also used to good effect in all of the various CSI series.  Somewhat like ""Old West"" feel of The A-Team, there is real fun and interest in seeing S.W.A.T. go up against the bad guys, who usually have skills and elaborate plans of their own.

Showing a specially skilled S.W.A.T. team gave Aaron Spelling and people behind the series a standard of quality they had to aim for, which was good discipline and pushed them to more serious work.  Spelling should have embraced this, rather than reportedly disowning the show, preferring pure fluff programming.  The best episode in the 13-show set is probably the one in which the team protects a mobster turned government witness in the hospital.  Both the police and the criminals are smart, there is suspense and a twist, and Mark Shera shines, with an opportunity to show feeling in serious, well-crafted scenes.  The episodes about a jewelry theft from a beauty pageant and a coin heist are also above-average.

It is easy to criticize the show.  Of course, there are repetitious gun-rack-emptying, running, and driving scenes when a call comes in and the team has to ""roll.""  But routine and procedure are part of police work.

Setting the series in the fictional ""WCPD"" does not help authenticity.  The plain, baggy, baseball-style caps that the men wore may be authentic, but it does not help the dramatic effect of the opening freeze-frame shots to have Mark Shera's and Robert Urich's deadly serious but small-looking faces peeking out from under the caps like mice.  Sometimes the series and Shera seem to be trying too hard to show off his character as the team clown.  Urich is completely wasted by the series, coming off as wooden, self-conscious, forced, and extraneous.  Rose Marie's appearances as a hawker of cheap pastries and sandwiches at the police station, obviously meant to provide some color and humor, can get tiresome.

The dialogue and interactions can be stiff and the characters and stories shallow.  This is often true of scenes with Forrest at home with the wife and kids and of the story-lines with ""personal"" angles.  Like Hawaii Five-O, S.W.A.T., at its best, is proof of a basic point.  If a show is done professionally, it can be entertaining to watch the characters for what they do on the job, which is how the public and peers see them in real life, and there is no need to constantly delve into personal subplots.

Two shows are particularly disappointing.  In ""Time Bomb"" (included in the disk set as a first season episode but according to episode guides not aired until the second season), the criminal's plan never gets off the ground and much time is wasted on chase scenes around a movie studio backlot.  In ""Blind Man's Bluff,"" Forrest is wounded in an unconvincing, sloppy way; he responds unprofessionally and out of character; his replacement appears once, in one exaggerated, talky scene as a jerk, and is never seen in action; the role of the rest of the team is weak; and little goes on during the episode.

Although the team responded to some interesting individual incidents, the episode in which a reporter was following the team around did not make much of that plot line.  The episode in which S.W.A.T. tracked an international hit man (played with gusto by Christopher George) suffered from the distracting complication that he was infected with a deadly disease and from an anticlimactic end confrontation.  Also, too often, as when a basketball team is taken hostage, the crooks put themselves in a box with little realistic plan of escape, making themselves too easy pickings and not enough of a challenge for S.W.A.T.  Regardless of these and other possible complaints, it is still fun and interesting to see how the team sizes up and responds to each situation, with Hondo barking out orders and the men expertly deploying their skills, weapons, and tactics to solve the particular high-stakes problem.

Overall, the shows in the DVD set are good entertainment.  As to the hatchet-job review that boasted ""non-fan, fresh eyes,"" as though it was entitled to some special weight just for not having seen the show when it originally aired (neither did I), all it had to offer were stale, obvious, superficial criticisms and inapt comparisons to other shows, without any attempt to appreciate what S.W.A.T. does well.  (What could be easier than ridiculing the show for featuring a ""Charles Manson type"" as the villain one week, as though it was supposed to be taken seriously as the real thing, and with no mention of Sal Mineo's live-wire performance?)  Another review that trashed the series sounded like canned comments written without even watching the show.  For example, the review announced self-importantly, without any explanation or support, that the series showed no regard for police procedure and, except for ""one time,"" always shot first and asked questions later.  This is absurd; time and again, the episodes showed far more understatement, skill, intelligence, and discipline in response to a crisis than I had expected.

If you watch the show for yourself, you will find that it had something special.  Even if, as some say, the quality declined in the second season, I hope some day (soon?) myself to be able to see the rest of the episodes of the series.",1183075200,5,6969,4.906996587030717

There's plenty of good stuff in this series.  It's been fun to watch, especially since it was denied from me 30 years ago.

I do wish that they had some extra features on the DVD but there isn't.  No character interviews, no background info, nothing.  They don't even have scene selection, you can only choose an episode or play all the episodes - bummer.  Maybe they can add some of that to the second DVD if it ever comes out.

If you get a chance to read through all the reviews here, the characters that played Luca and T.J. also entered reviews - look for them!",1123977600,4,1177,4.025862068965517

I really want to buy this great compilation, but since my elder brother doesn't speak English I'd like to know if it has Spansih subtitles.  I'll really appreciate if you can help me.

My dad and I used to catch it every week. Getting a chance to see it all again really brought back lots of memories. I would recommend this DVD for anyone who grew up watching this show. I wished that they would come out with more of the series since it went on to a second season. If you grew up during the 70's, this is a great addition to your collection!",1113955200,2,531,3.75
1871731,2,B00008YLVB,"I never watched this show growing up, but being hooked on these ""TVd's"" I'm currently a Netflix junkie and giving most 70's shows a look since many neighborhood vid stores just do not stock these.

Well, what can I say? I found the show SWAT, at least Disc One to be wooden. If having 5 central characters is supposed to be a plus I didn't see it. Each ""character"" seemed similiar to each other and Steve Forrest seemed robotic. Forced laughs, lame dialogue, poor guest stars abound, and the chemistry is just so flat. (The Charles Manson parallel episode being almost ""comical"".)

I'm just here to report in to ""the curious"" that all that glittered in the 70's was not gold. I'm a big fan of Columbo and in comparison to the acting and writing on that show, SWAT is honestly an utter joke. It was a fun trial and I have no regrets and just so you know, I give Kung-Fu 5 stars and I had never watched that either in ""its day"", and was another Netflix trial balloon I sailed, you don't necessarily had to have watched the show in its time, if it WAS good, it will still BE good.",1111017600,3,1077,4.300492610837439

1871774,5,B00008YLVB,"I recently picked up Season One of ""S.W.A.T."" and I was really amazed at the overall quality of this release. What a treat it is to finally have the first 13 episodes complete with digitally remastered audio and video. In my opinion the picture and sound are truly amazing and they have never looked and sounded better. Not only do I get to own Season One on DVD but I get to relive some of my childhood memories all over again with this wonderful set.

This show made quite an impression on me as a 10 year old; In fact some of the other neighborhood kid's and me formed our own S.W.A.T. club. We outfitted ourselves with black t-shirts, caps and pants. We carried authentic police band Walkie Talkies and plastic guns and Daisy air rifles. I of course was T.J and many times I could be found on the roof of our house waiting to take down the bad guy's, unless my Dad was coming up the ladder to take me down!

Anyway enough of that, If your a fan of S.W.A.T. you definitely can't go wrong buying this set from Amazon. Thanks to the magic of DVD and this amazing Season one set I get to revisit a little slice of my childhood when ever I want. In my opinion this 3 single sided disc set complete with great artwork and packaging is well done. Sadly the pilot episode that started it all has not been included in this release and that's disappointing! I hope that the remaining episodes from season two are on the way and some bonus material or the (original pilot) will be included this time around.

From the moment the theme music starts and the S.W.A.T. van doors burst open you're hooked. Join Lt ""Hondo"" Harrelson, Officers Deacon, Street, Luca and T.J. for a sharp shooting good time!

1871775,4,B00008YLVB,"This is one of the 1970s action dramas about S.W.A.T team in action. Many of us who enjoyed this show were saddened that this show did not reappear in re-runs and thanks to the producers and the studio for 13 glorious episodes (three DVDs). Now we have the opportunity to view, entertain and enjoy this show. This is one of the few shows about a team of cops in action. There were several single cop shows such as Beretta; two-cop shows such as Starsky and Hutch, but S.W.A.T is the only one about a team. The show stars well known actor Steve Forrest and this show also paved way for the success of Robert Urich (Vegas) and Mark Shera (Barnaby Jones). I hope the success of this DVD set will convince Columbia TriStar to produce second set of DVD covering the second season.",1088380800,31,775,4.426573426573427

I didn't really enjoy sit-coms so this show was right up my alley. We used to pretend to be S.W.A.T. playing around in the yard, and I'd always turn my hat around like T.J.
This dvd set is really great....but wait until the second longer season comes out! There is an awsome second season episode in which Hondo takes a bullet and is in critical condition (I think it was a two part episode). If my memory is correct there is another great episode that involves Street and/or Luca being held hostage by a crazy person in some kind of warehouse room/cell. Really great serious stuff!

I then bought the DVD when it came out and saw that SWAT 1st season was out on DVD and saw some clips so within that week I bought it. It was such a great show. It was cancelled before its time and unike some of my other favorite shos like 24 it barely shows blood and its not like one of those corny family hour shows like the Brady Bunch. I think they should revive the series for todays audiences it would be great and I can't wait till they release the second season. My only beef with it was there were no special features and not even a scene selection. I disagree that some of my friends said it was stupid it was great go and buy it.,1076889600,4,750,3.8766233766233764
1871779,5,B00008YLVB,"I just read the posting by Mark Shera about not being asked to be in the Movie version of SWAT?  Are the producers crazy?!?!  I do not know if Mr. Shera was serious, but I might have actually gone to see the film version of SWAT if he had been in it.  My first reaction on hearing they were making it was how I was sure they would ruin it, as movie versions of top TV shows usually are and when I heard they had no Dom Luca or someone representing him in the movie, I wrote it off.
The first season in DVD, however is the delight I remember from 1975, when I spent my Saturday nights at age 16 soaking up the action on TV.  My discovery of this DVD set at my local Borders has made me happy.  Yes, at times it is campy, but so what?  It's 70's TV folks! Live a little!

1871811,5,B00008YLVB,"Well, I played Dominic Luca in the original series, and what Jim has told you (above) about the devolution of the writing and focus of the show is true. Aaron Spelling was embarrassed about the series' violence--mild compared to today's fare. And with more than a little public pressure, the networks conceived and implemented what came to be known as  the ""Family Hour.""  No guns, no death, no violence. And soon after, no SWAT. But I'm afraid his recollection of a rumor about Rod Perry's demise is a little fuzzy. Not only is Jim's mention of Rod's heart attack news to me, but no such story of Rod's death was relayed to Jim by your's truly. And yes sadly, Bob Urich's passing was a terrible shock and sadness to us all. He left a great legacy, though. And he lives on in this wonderful compilation of shows. Great fun to view episodes that I've not seen in decades!
BTW: I didn't get a chance to be in the film because...well... no one asked. LOL!!!

I really enjoyed watching the DVDs, and am really hoping that a SWAT, Second Season will be out soon!

S.W.A.T. was violent, derivative, and not particularly well-written, but there was a kinetic energy to it that makes it memorable.
As a six-year-old, I watched it faithfully, every time the parents weren't watching me.  You were NOBODY on the first-grade playground unless you could recount the latest plot and recite the lines.

Special Weapons And Tactics (S.W.A.T.) team operating in an unidentified California city.

Steve Forrest was perfect in the role of Lieutenant Dan 'Hondo' Harrelson.
Robert Urich was perfect in the role of Officer Jim Street.
Rod Perry was perfect in the role of Sergeant David 'Deacon' Kay.
Mark Shera was perfect in the role of Officer Dominic Luca.
James Coleman was perfect in the role of Officer T.J. McCabe.

I rated this ""S.W.A.T. - Season One"" 3-disc set just four stars because it didn't include the ""S.W.A.T."" two-hour pilot episode.
That two-hour pilot episode aired on ABC on February 17, 1975 as an episode of ""The Rookies"".
It still should have been included on the ""S.W.A.T. - Season One"" DVD release though.

Season One of ""S.W.A.T."" originally aired on ABC from February 24, 1975 until May 26, 1975.

Sony Pictures Home Entertainment made a drastic and gigantic typo on the back of the DVD case.
According to them, the 13-episodes from Season One  have a combined running time of approximately 564 minutes on this DVD release.
The 13-episodes from Season One actually have a combined running time of 651 minutes and 23 seconds on this DVD release.
651 minutes and 23 seconds equals 10 hours, 51 minutes and 23 seconds of total content.

Here are the exact running times for all 13 episodes from the first season of ""S.W.A.T."" on this 3-disc DVD set.

Disc 1:
""The Killing Ground"" (50:18)
""Coven of Killers"" (50:19)
""Death Carrier"" (50:18)
""Pressure Cooker"" (50:22)
""Hit Men"" (50:06)

Disc 2:
""Jungle War"" (49:19)
""Death Score"" (50:07)
""Time Bomb"" (50:16)
""The Bravo Enigma"" (50:13)
""The Steel-Plated Security Blanket"" (49:49)

Disc 3:
""Omega One"" (50:13)
""Blind Man's Bluff"" (49:46)
""Sole Survivor"" (50:17)

It appears that all 13 of these episodes are presented in uncut and unedited form on this Sony Pictures Home Entertainment 3-disc set.

There weren't any teasers included in any of the episodes on this 3-disc DVD set.
It might be possible that each of these 13 episodes didn't have teasers when these episodes originally aired on ABC.

All three discs are single-sided.

The picture quality is terrific and the audio quality is sensational.

The packaging that Sony Pictures Home Entertainment used for ""S.W.A.T. - The Complete First Season"" is perfect.
