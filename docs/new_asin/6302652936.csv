493085,2,6302652936,"My opinion differs from the previous ones in several important aspects. Pavarotti's voice is good. But it was not as good as I expected it to be and it was really poor when compared with the Decca recoding with Sutherland. Certainly, it has been a while since that recording...But still!...What a change in the quality of the voice! Anyway, that is a minor thing when you look at his ridiculous acting. I can't disagree more with previous reviewers on this issue. Pavarotti's acting made of this one of the worst performances I have ever seen of this Opera. Leaving aside his looks (he doesn't fit a young Nemorino), what really bothered me was his ""robotic"" moves, his unexisting body language, his ""mono-expressive"" facial gestures and his inability (or unwillingness) to properly interact with the rest of the cast in accordance to what should be happening on stage (sometimes he is just walking around,eating or with a mesmerized look in his face). Again, his singing was good but emotionally flat and with few traces of the great voice it was in the '70. Not good enough to make a great Nemorino. Unfortunately, this is an Opera production (not a massive concert) and a little more of effort in the acting should be expected(to better convey the deep emotions of the characters). Although the sound was not the best, one could appreciate the good performance of the Met Orchestra under the direction of Levine. Mrs. Battle singing was good (not as good as I have heard her before; i.e. Il Barbiere di Siviglia), although there were times in which i could not understand clearly what she was singing (some vowels also sounded a little flat, specially in the last duet with Nemorino). Mrs. Battle's acting was not great but certainly it was much better than Pavarotti's (although it annoyed me to see her singing sometimes to the auditorioum when she was supposed to be expressing feelings towards a character on stage). I also expected more from the Met's presentation. I considered it a little cartoonist and old. In sum, a video that has great selling power (Pavarotti, Battle, Dara, Pons, Levine, the Met productions, etc.) but does not satisfy. I consider that the production of L'elisir D'amore from the Opera de Lyon, with Alagna and Gheorghiu, is by far a much better perfomance and a better buy.",1045267200,15,2307,4.843037974683544
493086,5,6302652936,"What a performace! I never was crazy about opera buffa, but this performace made me love ""L'Elisir D'Amore"" along with opera buffa in general. What a charming, fluent singing and acting. Let me start with Luciano Pavarotti: Nemorino is one of his favourite roles. This role suits his voice to perfection, it seems so easy. Because of this easyness he has plenty of time for acting, really great acting. I never thought that Pavarotti could be the great actor but this performance shows that he indeed is. Although this is comical opera, his singing makes you cry, he is especially great in duets with Belcore (II act), Adina and Dulcamara (I act). His high C at the end of the duet with Belcore is brilliant and easy.
Catherine Battle is brilliant too. She is so amazing, one thing I don't like about her is that she makes too much gestures with her hands, it is too vivid on the screen. But her singing is perfect. Juan Pons is magnificent, his 100 percent dramatic voice gives him somehow oportiunity to sing in opera buffa and sing on the highest level.
So, this VHS is must have, especially for Donizetti and Pavarotti fans. You will not regret it.",1004486400,7,1152,4.597087378640777
493087,5,6302652936,"Yes, the famous name is Luciano Pavarotti who performed so excellently and brilliant in this opera, that convinced us of his superiority in this world. He performed with such glorious and natural folly that we are deeply moved to the fate yet be amused of this poor Nemorino who longed for the popular Belle of the village, Adina. Pavarotti was performing with such sincerity and in his top condition in this opera and his beautiful voice who is already wellknown to anybody also guaranteed the brilliant performance. His acting and singing is matched by the clear colloratura voice and perfect acting of Kathleen Battle, who personifies the fickle Adina. Her performance and also support by the performances of Juan Pons as Sargeant Belcore and Enzo Dara as Dr. Dulcamara resulted in the perfection of this opera. We also adore the beautiful background scenery and the colorful costumes, which is prepared so tasteful and with care. In short, this opera is so magnificent and enjoyable, that we will watch it over and over again.",998352000,6,1030,4.959537572254336
493088,5,6302652936,"O-MI-GAWD! My jaw is still on the floor after watching this amazing production of Donizetti's most frequently revived romantic comedy. The sets are rudimentary but the conductor and performers keep you too riveted to care! James Levine is not given enough credit as the Met's Artistic Director and Principal Conductor, but that would all change if all of his detractors sat down and watched this video. You can tell from the overture that this is going to be an effervescent and detailed performance. Bravo, Maestro Levine! The supporting players (Korliss Uecker as Giannetta, Enzo Dara as Dulcamara, and Juan Pons as Belcore) are all great but the true glory of this production is the teaming of Pavarotti and Battle, surely the two most coveted opera stars at the time this was filmed (1991). This video is truly a testament to the golden-voiced tenor: even when he is just going through the motions as he is here, he is heads and shoulders above his closest competitors. (His ""Una furtiva lagrima"" made the hairs on my arms stand on end!) Pavarotti has received a lot of flak for his alleged lack of acting skills but he turns in a wonderful performance that is, in turns, hilarious and heartrending. Once again Kathleen Battle astounds, this time as Adina. She completely inhabits the aristocrat, making a character that could be simple relatively complex. (Adina's ability for coyness and cruelty is schizophrenic and, under Ms. Battle's auspices, believable.) Her singing is, as usual, a delight to hear and only occasionally is her diction veiled in the cavernous Metropolitan. She dispenses with many interpolated high C's, D's, and one E in the second act. And they said this was a tenor show. HA! Buy this, you will NOT be sorry.",992304000,12,1739,4.918367346938775
493089,5,6302652936,"L'Elisir D'Amore is without a doubt one of the most charming operas that one could add to any collection.  Here the plot is relatively simple.  Nemorino(Pavarotti), is a poor villager hopelessly in love with a wealthy farm owner Adina (Kathleen Battle).  He sits in awe of her just mystified by both her brains and beauty.  He pines away his love for her, so much so that it has become routine and the entire village knows that when he's near her..here it comes.  Adina to the contrary, initially is flattered but somewhat repulsed by Nemorino's hopelss affection.  In effort to win her love he consults Dulcamara (Enzo Dara) who is both a pedler and make shift doctor for the potion of Isolda (an elixor of love, which is where we get the title).  This potion in all honesty is nothing more than wine, but Nemorino's naivity doesn't realize it and he then sets about the conquest of winning Adina's heart. In this on set, Nemorino's uncle who was sick in the begining of the opera, has  died leaving Nemorino a weathly man.  The Village girls hear of this and now Nemorino is a hot commodity.  He of course thinks that his elixor is working! Adina comes to see him when he is engulfed in a sea of women.  Deciding that it's time for Adina to know the pains of love, he ignores her, leaving her reduced to tears.  The rest I will leave for you to unravel!  But, I will tell you this, there is a happy ending, but my the fun we have getting there!  The cast is sensational. If you are familiar with the Judith Blegen production this one is a particular delight.  Kathleen Battle gives an invigerating and energetic performance. The agility and beauty of her coloratura is fascinating and oddly enough she and Pavarotti do make a believable couple.  She the on surface haughty, disenaged maiden and he, her hopeless, bumbling admirer.  The staging is also well done. This is a video that you will surely watch again and again.  It is comic opera much in the style of the Barber of Seville ( Il Barbiere Di Siviglia, another Kathleen Battle hallmark ).  If you enjoy great singing and an adorable story line then get this opera.  You won't regret it!",989539200,7,2147,4.541666666666667
493149,4,6302652936,"This was a wonderful L'Elisir DVD purchase. I have a CD recording of L'Elisir with Luciano Pavarotti and Joan Sutherland from 1971 which I absolutely love more than the DVD. Nonetheless, I truly enjoyed the performance. I thought Luciano Pavarotti did an outstanding job as Nemorino. I have always felt this role was one of those that Pavarotti owned, especially in the 70's & 80's. I have not preferred anyone else as Nemorino. Regarding the rest of the cast, Juan Pons is also one of my favourite Belcore. His performance is consistently excellent. I cannot ask for anyone else better in the pit other than James Levine. I gave this a 4 star instead of 5 because of Kathleen Battle. I credit her with having a lovely voice and she sang beautifully. However, I have a few minor gripes. 1)I felt her voice was not powerful enough for Adina. There were certain parts my husband and I had a difficult time hearing her. I much prefer Dame Joan Sutherland for Adina. 2)My other gripe about Battle is her somewhat poor Italian pronunciation. It was very obvious throughtout especially when she pronounced any word w/ a ""t"". Granted Dame Joan was not perfect with the Italian language but nontheless, better. 3) When Battle sang, I found her mouth somewhat distracting. At times, we had to look away. She often does this mouth curling inward thing which makes her mouth look like an ""O"" on certain note. If you purchase the DVD, you'll know what I mean. Overall, I would definitely recommend this to beginners and seasoned opera fans alike.",1202515200,4,1534,4.727611940298507

He was a wonderful actor.  Study the facial expressions and his ability to get emotions across through his singing.  None better.

493152,1,6302652936,I purchased this DVD after watching an opera on PBS TV. But then I found out it was not the same opera performance. This opera performance is not so good.,1195948800,3,154,4.166666666666667
493153,5,6302652936,"Wonderful, playful production.  Pavarotti having fun and so is Battle.  Great quality.  Recommend to all Pavarotti aficianados.  Grazie",1194825600,,135,6.333333333333333
493154,5,6302652936,"I bought this DVD shortly after Luciano Pavarotti's death; I wanted something to remember him by. I made a good choice. Joe McLellan (in the Amazon review) is right: this is the role that fit him best. And he was tough to fit: physically large, with limited acting ability (even by operatic standards) and a larger-than-life offstage persona that bled into his onstage characterizations. But he acts well enough here--indeed, he's often fun to watch. Credit John Copley for giving Pavarotti enough to do but staying within his range.

And the voice is . . . the voice, still in fine form at 56.

Pavarotti is not the only star here. Kathleen Battle's performance is a treasure in every respect. Her Adina is, first and foremost, gorgeously sung. But there is also a quality of conviction and believability that she brings to the part, making those she sings with stronger as well.

The rest of the cast does a fine job, and Levine and the Met orchestra turn in a superlative performance, pacing the action nicely. Indeed, despite the fact that an adoring audience often breaks into vigorous applause, this production flows more smoothly than most of the ones I've seen from the Met. The a vista scene changes help. But a lot of credit for this goes to Donizetti and Romani for giving us a wonderful show that never bogs down musically or dramatically, one of the finest operatic comedies.

The recorded sound is acceptable, although the balance between soloist and orchestra overly favors the latter at times (many live recordings have this problem).

From what I gather from Amazon reviews, there are other good DVD options available for this opera. At some future date I hope to see what Alagna and Villazon do with the role of Nemorino. But their voices won't be as resonant or plangent as the voice you'll hear on this DVD. It's not their fault, and they're not alone. In this respect, Pavarotti was unique.",1190160000,6,1911,4.761329305135952
493155,5,6302652936,"This is the first opera I watched because its music has been used in the movie ""Match Point"" by Woody Allen which I find beautiful. I always thought opera to be some kind of classy and boring stuff. I was totally blown away by the powerful voice of the actors and the everybody's enthusiasm that can be felt also from the applauses and cheers from the audience after each scene. Human voice, it is obvious from this performance, is the most beautiful musical instrument.

Despite the primitive stage and costume, this opera seems to have everything that can be found in a great movie, or in life: love, luck, and humor. It is like a no-frill bare-bone style movie, without any sound or visual effects except human voice, facial expression and body movement, but moving and entertaining none the less.",1165017600,8,800,4.714285714285714

The kudos for both incredible voice AND saucy acting goes to the lovely Kathleen Battle, ever so spoiled in her role and generous with her upper register. Most funny was Dara as the doctor, I never doubted him for a moment. Luciano, for me, sometimes seems to be winking at us self-consciously, like this is not really me, see me act like a country peasant. Then his great and extended voice grabs me and I feel honored to be in the presence of his singing and Donizetti's music. Afterwards, I felt what a great night at the opera!

I would recommend this as an introduction to opera for anyone and for opera fans alike get this one. Mind you there are some flaws with the overall productions like Italians flags waving around when in truth Donizetti never was around for the establishing of an Italian country so that was totally out of place. (I have noticed that the Met has this annoying habit of throwing in flags of today in opera setting of centuries ago)Also there is Pavarotti wearing a green hospital band on his hand. However, this is opera and opera is about singing and I assure you that great singing is what you get in this production. Buy it!!!! WONDERFUL!!! Bravissimo!!!!",1132704000,15,864,4.766666666666667
493190,4,6302652936,"Donizetti's L'Elisir d'Amore is a wonderful opera. Light, entertaining and distracting us from all evil things going on in the world. But also reminding us how easily we all are fooled by these charlatans who know the art of changing our hopes into money in their own pockets. The performance claims for both singing and acting and the winner is Mr Battle who is absolutely outstanding as the convincing seller of the functional food of the time, l'elisir d'amore - the love-potion. Miss Battle is also very good with a wonderful, sensitive voice. Of course, Pavarotti is the great tenor but here also confirming his often less successful talent as an actor. Unfortunately his voice can't always compensate his woody performance and (too) impressive body - reducing the rating from 5 stars to 4. Maestro Levine is the ideal conductor to keep it all together with both humour and discipline.",1125964800,7,890,4.94
493191,5,6302652936,"A wonderful DVD recorded in 1991

This is a live presentation at the Met of Donizetti's L'elisir d'Amore with James Levine conducting. It stars Kathleen Battle  (Adina), Luciano Pavarotti (Nemorino), Jaun Pons (Belcore) and Enzo Dara (Dottore Dulcamara).

This recording has so much going for it... Let me elaborate.

The sets and props were outstanding with magnificent drop down scenery and even a revolving waterwheel. All the costumes (especially the ladies)were gorgeous,  simply sumptuous. The camera work was generally well done with only a little concern in some of the duets. (in ""Quanto Amore"" for example, the camera tended on several occasions, to focus on only one of the singers when in fact both persons were singing)

What really separates this L'elisir for some of the others is the quality of the singing and acting; Battle, plays the perfect Adina,(coquettish and funny)then add to this the pureness to her voice, and her ability to reach some of those high notes with such apparent ease. Pons does the best Belcore I've seen or heard, and Dara does a wonderful interpretation of the charlatan buffa, Dottore Dulcamara.

However, to me, it is Pavarotti who shines throughout this night as the lovesick and downtrodden Nemorino. This is without a doubt, Pavarotti's finest acting achievement; he seemed so at ease with his character during the entire performance. And, of course, there is his voice, which was in magnificent form for this performance.

Highlight of the disc:

If there was one memorable, focal point in this night of outstanding performances it was Pavarotti's aria ""Una Furtiva Lagrima""; sung with such tenderness and feeling that the  enraptured audience ACTUALLY WAITED until the music finished before the thunderous applause and cheering started, so great was their respect for the mans rendering of this famous piece.

The entire performance that night seemed to be incredibly relaxed, with the cast seemly having a lot of fun on stage. Some of the camera work actually caught some of them laughing and joking with each other after their songs. The audience giving prolonged thunderous applause and ovations after nearly every song (and deservedly so,in my opinion). What at thrill it must have been to be there that night.

All in all a fabulous DVD. A must have, if your a fan of Donizetti, Battle, Pavarotti or any of the other performers of this wonderful opera with its catchy, infectious melodies.",1122854400,13,2443,5.095238095238095
493192,4,6302652936,"Originally recorded in 1992, this 2005 DVD re-release of the Kathleen Battle/Luciano Pavarotti ""L'Elisir D'Amore"" (The Elixir of Love) recorded live at the Met under the baton of James Levine, holds up rather well, given the dated scenery and trend toward more fit, younger performers singing romantic roles. Pavarotti was big then and he sweats up a storm when he sings. But for sheer power and enjoyment of watching a cast of talented singers at their peak, well, this DVD is eminently worth owning. The picture quality is digital, but it is taken from tape, making the clarity somewhat gauzy. But the sound quality is what may ultimately rule here - and the sound quality of this DVD is deep and rich and full, and the high point of this release, especially if you happen to be watching this production on a system equipped with an enhanced sound system. Kathleen Battle, at the height of her career, is magnificent and beautiful and when she is on stage singing, it's easy to be seduced by the wonderful, mellifluous tones that she produces. The entire cast and chorus does a superb job, making this production enjoyable. It probably doesn't hurt that Donizetti's score is easy on the ear, melodious and filled with harmony and loaded with plenty of emotion. Though dated, it is a great performance and worth owning.

I think Gheorghiu isn't as natural an actress as Battle,nor do I think she has as good a voice. I know a lot of people worship Gheorghiu and I enjoy her too, but she doesn't seem natural when acting and singing. Don't think I dislike or am putting her down,because I think she is great.

493194,5,6302652936,"The words ""Journeyman Opera Composer"" have affixed themselves to Donizetti's name in much the same fashion as ""The Great Reformer"" have to Gluck: the price one pays for diligence and fecundity of imagination, I suppose. Although not all of Donizetti's 60 or so Operas are listenable today, some 10 of them are masterpieces of the Bel Canto repetoire and three of them are amongst the finest (and last) works of true opera buffa. L'Elisir D'Amore is his earliest opera buffa and considered his best by many (I prefer Don Pasquale but it's close). Composed quickly (under a month) to a libretto by Felice Romani, it premiered at the Teatro della Canobbiana, Milan in 1832. A Met stalwart, there have been more than 220 performances since 1904.

The story is simple: two men in a small Italian village are in love with Adina (soprano) the wealthy town flirt: Nemerino (tenor), a shy and gentle farmer and Belcore (baritone), a conceited and strutting army sergeant. Dr. Dulcamore (buffo bass) arrives in the village selling a magical elixir (actually a cheap Bordeaux). Nemerino buys it thinking it a love potion a la Tristan und Isolde, gets drunk and repulses Adina who decides to marry Belcore. She delays the wedding and Belcore decides to rid himself of Nemerino by having him enlist for the cash bonus of twenty crowns. Nemerino buys a second bottle of elixir and gets drunk again. Word spreads his rich uncle has died, leaving him his estate. The village girls suddenly take an interest in a man in uniform with money. Nemerino, unaware of the source of their interest, credits the elixir. Adina, now jealous of all the attention he is getting, realizes she loves only him. Belcore heads for greener pastures and Dulcamara sells all of his remaining elixir. Everyone is happy!

Nemerino has been sung by the greatest tenors: Gigli, Schipa, Gedda, Carreras, Alva and Di Stefano have all made their mark. But no comic role has ever suited a tenor more than this one suits Pavarotti. Not surprisingly, it is his favorite role. Nemerino has been described as ""a cocker spaniel"". Pavarotti's (limited) acting palette includes that of a large, playful puppy. He offers us a beautiful ""Una furtiva lagrima"" in this performance taped at the Met in November 1991. The voice, slightly pinched at the top, is clarion clear. His diction is exquisite, as always. But it is Kathleen Battle as Adina that is  revelatory. Her performance is stunning! Her voice has great force and beauty. In fact, it is more powerful than Pavarotti's in many scenes! A full, rich, lyrical instrument under superb control at all times. Her acting is superb as well. She throws herself into the role. I did not detect much chemistry between the two leads, however. Frankly, I did not expect much. Yet it still works. Enzo Dara as Dulcamara hams it up wonderfully. He is terrific! Funny, believable with a marvelous buffo bass. Juan Pons sings a suitably officious Belcore and Korliss Uecker is a pretty Giannetta.

James Levine conducts the Met Orchestra, then at the height of its powers as one of the world's greatest ensembles, with sublime rightness. The younger and healthier Levine extracts every bit of beauty and comedy from this lovable score. Listen to the Woodwinds (my favorite section of the Orchestra) and relish their Mozartean clarity and grace! John Copley's production is beauty simplified. Beni Montresor's designs and stage pictures are vibrant with stunning primary colors and lovely Children's book style illustrations.

Donizetti is not a journeyman! Rather, he composed to live. So he composed quickly and well in order to please both audience and singers. If you are amongst either of these groups purchase this DVD! For production, sight and sound, this version of Elixir is excellent! We may be entering a new golden age for Opera afficionados when Operas such as this are available for such a relatively small sum.",1118016000,12,3912,4.948249619482496

As Adina, Kathleen Battle is sensational. Her voice is sublime, glowing with a ravishingly creamy, sensuous legato. Not only does she sing with technical perfection and ease, her compelling artistry is the epitome of grace and charm. Luciano Pavarotti gives his finest performance on video in his signature role of Nemorino. This role was his own personal favorite of all his roles and it shows in the warmth and charm he brings to his portrayal and his gorgeous vocalism.

His easy, beautiful timber are recorded for the ages and we are indebted to Met-DGG for making it available. I was at this performance in a balcony box and never dared hope for its release since a previous performance with Judith Blegan has been available for some time. Battle is here in rapturous, glorious  voice. An extremely beautiful timber, even from top to bottom, and every note in between. I cried as I watched the performance since it  brought back the memories of seeing and hearing this so long ago. Pons and Dara are equally in their company. Pnns is excellent and to my way of thinking very underrated. Dara must still be singing Dulcamara somewhere if he is still alive. He sings this role to the very life.  There is just no weakness in this production. Panni was supposed to have been the conductor for this matinee  performance but he was ill and history fated us with the final link, Levine,  to make this an historical performance. We have been blessed with a plethora of great DVDs from the Met [ Ernani, Manon Lescaut, Lucia to name but a few ] but the L'elisir here is probably their very best. The sets are wonderfully traditional and they work very well indeed. I left the theater numb, with a very sore throat and walked to the train talking to myself. My poor wife thought I had lost my mind. Its still under seat three in the third balcony box. This is an absolute must for your DVD shelf. The only time I've heard a more beautiful soprano in a live performance was Caballe at Chicago Lyric back around 1969 In Traviata. I certainly have heard many other superb sopranos, but I put Battle and Caballe in a special ranking. IF you don't enjoy this video you're either tone deaf, hate Donizetti or just don't like beautiful music  sung as exquisitely  as this Adina and Nemorino. Where are all  your music lovers? There should be many more reviews here. Out of five stars this should have at least 10. Even if you disagree with me, this dvd deserves recognition and attention.

I'm not always thrilled with Pavarotti's acting ability, but here his Nemorino is marvelous, in what might be his most engaging performance on film; charming and tender, his ""Una Furtiva Lagrima"" is incredibly moving and full of beauty. Kathleen Battle is an exquisite Adina, youthful and capricious, and vocally stunning. Korliss Uecker is a lovely Giannetta, and Juan Pons excellent as Sergeant Belcore. Enzo Dara almost steals the show as a hilarious Doctor Dulcamara, with his chest full of bizarre medals. His comedic timing is right on target and his voice quite up to the demands of the role.
The sets by Beni Montresor are ingenious and effective, and the costumes are splendid, in colors that remind one of a spring garden. The camerawork is also good, and adds to the visual interest. From the orchestra pit, James Levine masterfully keeps it all together with sparkle and zest.
This 1991 live performance from the Metropolitan Opera is terrific theater, as well as a musical treat, and one to own and enjoy repeatedly.",1058832000,25,1151,4.938144329896907

7829038,5,6302652936,"I purchased this before it went out of print, because I was fortunate to see this production live at the MET years ago. This was my first time at the MET and was fortunate to see what I consider a near perfect production of one of my favorite Donizetti operas.  Battle has to be one of my favorites Amina's ever!! Whatever personal problems she might have had at the MET, she was one performer that never disappointed. I said this production was near perfect and that has to do with Pavarotti. Where the man sang like the angels and vocally he is one of the best Nemorino's ever, physically he is far from being well suited for the part. Not so much because of his weight, but by this time he started having problems and you can tell that he could not move around as much. Still, in my opinion, all he had to do was stand there and sing...and I felt I had my money's worth!!  This also includes the fabulous Enzo Dara as Dulcamara and you can not get any better than that!!",1468454400,2,973,4.254054054054054

7829043,4,6302652936,"What a delightful and fun opera. I disagree with others too. In all respects 5 stars. This is not a dream cast unless you close your eyes when Pavarotti is on stage. His golden voice is now a silver voice. And he is a large lump on the stage with absolutely no acting ability. Opera singers should be judged on their voice, acting ability, stage presence and presentation. His costume was literally a tent due to his massive size. He was hardly engaged with the cast and certainly not a credible love interest for Ms. Battle. A buffoon yes. I now will search for another Elixer of love with a tenor with better acting ability. If you want to see acting watch Domingo in Carmen and Pagliacci.",1301270400,2,691,4.448818897637795
7829044,5,6302652936,"Composer Gaetano Donizetti knew used the formula of romance to the fullest. Never innovated, it was always the current rules of his time. His triumph is in the beautiful melodies, the music that pleases the ears. In working with the voice can express great ability in soils, sets and choirs. Walk safely through serious opera and shows skill with the comic. Lucia di Lammermoor, La Favorita, Don Pasquale, Lucrezia Borgia, Roberto Devereux are some of the successes of the composer.

Luciano Pavarotti is at home in L'Elisir D'Amore. The role of Nemorino is ideal for your voice. Build your character with what is best, his treble. Brilliant, powerful and alive. Overflowing emotions to each note. His large body is not adapting to personagem. No proves to be the naive and passionate young man tells how the plot. But his enthusiasm, mixed with some good expressions make it a good Nemorino. Moved the public in the aria Una furtiva lagrima by the Italian style of singing and a total dedication to music. In several scenes can pull laughter from the audience and us viewers, who have worldwide fame of being bad actor that's high praise.

Pleasant surprise in this video is Kathleen Battle. His Adina is all sensuality. Captivates audiences with his mischievous way. Poor Nemorino is ""despised"" subtly. His voice is a pure lyricism, a little dark and with some slight difficulties in the passages. His tone is pleasing to the ears. It stands out with beautiful performance, correct and consistent with the character.

Donizetti insert a character reminiscent of comic opera, Il Dottore Dulcamara. Low owl is a comic character, sometimes clumsy, sometimes mixed up the dodgy. This type of singer became a rarity nowadays, Enzo Dara as incorporating some of these characteristics. Funny, irreverent, manipulative and smart. Voice serious bright and agile, its entrance aria, Udite, Udite, characteristics and performed with mastery. Use and abuse, with much talk, the ingenuity of Nemorino and does well. In opera and interpretation.

Sergeant Belcore is played by Juan Pons. Another singer with inadequate physical type for the role. Your remember the large body of Sergeant Garcia series Zorro, huge for a soldier on active duty. His baritone voice has great colors in the middle notes, good volume and projection. Its performance is average scenic, is a sergeant good-natured, funny and cheerful you are always willing to meet the wishes of his beloved Adina.

The conducting of James Levine is accurate and correct with time, with all the suits in balance. For an opera dominated the comic this is essential. The Met chorus was never a masterpiece when compared to other opera houses. In L'elisir get good vocal performance. Accompanying the adventures of soloists keeping the pace and mood.

The scenarios use an idea already won in theater, up and down supported by ropes. Designed according to the libretto, simple and practical. Give impetus to a comic opera. The costumes are light, beautiful and appropriate. Represent the peasants clothes a little too luxurious for this class. In other do well to carry the singers to Italy in the nineteenth century.

Highlight the correct direction for television, the cameras capture the essence of his performance time, with good angles and outlets. The picture quality is good when you know that this is an analog recording that was transported to digital. The sound follows the same rule. The resources presented on this record are poor, we can not select scenes from the menu, only acts. There is no interview or documentary. We have a small selection of photos of L'Elisir D'Amore at the Met which shows various interpreters of the past, including the Brazilian Bidu Sayao.

The recording of this DVD is the year of 1992, it is amazing how the production of the Met are not dated. Produced to be presented by an average of 25 years can stay current for many years. This L'elisir D'amore may be presented in any theater in the world today that will make great success.

Saudades do Pavarotti

  O compositor  Gaetano Donizetti soube utilizar-se da formula do romantismo de maneira plena. Nunca inovou, seguia sempre as regras vigentes de seu tempo. Seu triunfo est nas belas melodias, na msica que agrada aos ouvidos. No trabalhar com a voz consegue expressar grande habilidade em solos, conjuntos e coros. Caminha com segurana pela pera sria e mostra habilidade com o cmico. Lucia di Lammermoor, La Favorita, Don Pasquale, Lucrezia Borgia e Roberto Devereux so alguns dos sucessos do compositor.

  Luciano Pavarotti est  vontade no L'Elisir D'Amore. O papel de Nemorino  ideal para sua voz. Constri seu personagem com o que tem de melhor, seus agudos. Brilhantes, potentes e vivos. Transbordam emoes a cada nota. Seu corpanzil no se adapta ao personagem. No demonstra ser o rapaz ingnuo e apaixonado como manda o enredo. Mas, seu entusiasmo, misturado a algumas boas expresses fazem dele um bom Nemorino. Comove o pblico na ria Una Furtiva lagrima pelo jeito italiano de cantar e uma entrega total a msica. Em diversas cenas consegue arrancar risos da platia e de ns espectadores, para quem tem fama mundial de ser pssimo ator isso  grande elogio.

  Agradvel surpresa nesse vdeo  Kathleen Battle. Sua Adina  toda sensualidade. Cativa o pblico com seu jeito travesso. Pobre do Nemorino,  ""desprezado"" sutilmente. Sua voz  de um lirismo puro, um pouco escura e com algumas dificuldades nas passagens ligeiras. Seu timbre  agradvel aos ouvidos. Destaca-se pela bela atuao, correta e compatvel com a personagem.

  Donizetti insere um personagem remanescente da pera bufa, Il Dottore Dulcamara. Baixo bufo  um personagem cmico, ora atrapalhado, ora metido a espertalho. Esse tipo de cantor tornou-se raridade nos dias atuais, Enzo Dara incorpora na medida certa essas caractersticas. Engraado, irreverente, manipulador e esperto. Voz com graves brilhantes e geis, sua ria de entrada, Udite,Udite , Ristici   interpretada com maestria. Usa e abusa, com muita conversa fiada, da ingenuidade do Nemorino e se sai bem. Na pera e na interpretao.

  O sargento Belcore  interpretado por Juan Pons. Mais um cantor com tipo fsico inadequado para o papel. Seu corpanzil lembra o sargento Garcia do seriado Zorro, enorme para um militar na ativa. Sua voz de bartono tem grande colorido nas notas mdias, bom volume e projeo. Sua atuao cnica  mediana, faz um sargento bonacho, engraado e alegre que est sempre disposto a atender os desejos de sua amada Adina.

  A regncia de James Levine  precisa e com tempos corretos, com todos os naipes em equilbrio. Para uma pera onde predomina o cmico isso  essencial. O coro do Met nunca foi um primor quando comparado a outros teatros lricos. Nesse L'elisir consegue boa atuao vocal. Acompanha as peripcias dos solistas mantendo o ritmo e o bom humor.

  Os cenrios usam uma idia j vencida em teatro, sobem e descem apoiados por cordas. Concebidos de acordo com o libreto, simples e prticos. Do a dinmica necessria a uma pera cmica. Os figurinos so leves, bonitos e adequados. Representam os camponeses com roupas um pouco luxuosas demais para essa classe social. No demais cumprem sua funo de transportar os cantores para a Itlia do sculo XIX.

  Destaque para a correta direo televisiva, as cmeras captam os momentos essncias da rcita, com bons ngulos e tomadas. A qualidade da imagem  boa quando se sabe que se trata de uma gravao analgica que foi transportada para o digital. O som segue a mesma regra. Os recursos apresentados nesse disco so pobres, no conseguimos selecionar cenas pelo menu, somente atos. No existe nenhuma entrevista ou documentrio. Temos uma pequena seleo de fotos do L'Elisir D'Amore no Met onde se mostra vrios interpretes do passado, entre eles a brasileira Bidu Sayo.

  A gravao desse dvd  do ano de 1992,  impressionante como as produo do Met no ficam datadas. Produzidas para serem apresentadas por 25 anos em mdia conseguem permanecer atuais por longos anos. Esse L'elisir D'amore pode ser apresentado em qualquer teatro do mundo nos dias atuais que far enorme sucesso.
