8347270,4,B001W9EUAY,"Based on the Hong Kong film Breaking News, a gang of Russian armed robbers are ambushed by the police and following the fire fight and car chase escape into a massive housing complex where they take a family hostage and join forces with two hit men who were about to carry out a contract.

The police decide to turn the whole thing into a media event in order to help boost their poor image. This goes wrong however as the criminals manage to outwit the police at every turn. The Russian SWAT/Special Forces are shown in a poor light as the gangsters manage to out shoot them at every turn.

Big on shoot outs and well acted, particularly by Andrey Merzlikin as Smirnov the cop who first tracks down the gangsters. News Makers is worth a couple of hours of your time and not just for the Russian setting, unusual as that is.",1313712000,2,824,4.379084967320262
