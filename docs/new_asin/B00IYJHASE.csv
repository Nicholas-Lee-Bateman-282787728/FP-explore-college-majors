6305189,5,B00IYJHASE,My two year old son absolutely loves this movie! He is a big fan of Cookie Monster and is so thrilled to have this movie so he can watch CM all the time. I especially like it because it has clips of Sesame Street from when I was a kid. I feel like I get to share that special part of my childhood with my kids. I will more than likely be looking out for more Sesame Street DVD's like this one.,1458259200,,393,3.8048780487804876
6305190,4,B00IYJHASE,"A lot of good & classic Cookie Monster moments. My daughter loves Cookie Monster, but this one doesn't interest her as much as some of her other Sesame Street DVDs & tapes. Still a nice addition to the collection, though.
For those of you who don't know, this is one disc with two different features (""C is for Cookie"" & ""Cookie Monster's Best Bites""), both mostly just being collections of Cookie Monster songs with some skits thrown in. There isn't any overlapping content, but both segments are fairly similar.",1456099200,6,513,4.775280898876405

8646368,5,B00IYJHASE,"Being 35, I adore buying my 1yr old nephew anything that's old school Muppets/Sesame St. He ALREADY loves Cookie Monster so I decided this would be a fun little DVD for him to watch with Mommy n Daddy(who's also a long time Cookie fan)
They all love it. It's an hour and a half of different skits and songs - all the classics that I grew up with and loved.
My nephew adores it and I'm a happy Aunt Xx",1488585600,,400,4.0125

8646373,5,B00IYJHASE,Fun dvd that my kids enjoyed. Has some older version Sesame Street songs/skits from the 70's and 80's that were cool to see since PBS now only shows new Sesame Street shows.,1466380800,,173,4.4375
