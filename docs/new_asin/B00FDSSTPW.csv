8614515,3,B00FDSSTPW,I thought this was The Mr Men Show cartoon that was out around 1997...which was a remake of THIS DVD.  I personally think the remake was much funnier and I was disappointed when this version arrived. It's hard to tell from the description. Not the show I was looking for.,1451865600,2,271,4.42
