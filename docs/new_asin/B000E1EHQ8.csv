2480000,3,B000E1EHQ8,"The original WALKING TALL movie shocked people of the time with its violence and straight forward, no-nonsense route to justice. To a lesser degree, the sequels tried to do the same thing. In the case of this series, an attempt was made to commercialize the idea.  The attempt was not all that successful.

The movie worked because of a desire to see justice and because of a frustration with the system. In that context, Sheriff Buford Pusser's violence made sense. In the TV series, however, it is another matter. The violence and disregard of the system is present just for the sake of excitement.

The acting is a mixed bag as are the plots. There has been much worse which has lasted longer on TV. This show, only lasted for 7 episodes. That was enough.

Episode synopses follow:

The Killing of McNeal County's Children - Someone is selling PCP cigarettes in the local school and Sheriff Pusser is on the warpath trying to shut down sales. He wants action and will let the law catch up as best it can.

The Protectors of the People - Tensions flare when some white supremacists try to incite racial violence and blame the black community for crimes they committed themselves. It comes to a head when a black deputy is framed for raping a white woman.

Kidnapped - A bank robbery goes wrong and the head robber gets shot and arrested. That leaves his sons looking for a way to spring him. They decide to stage a kidnapping to get their dad back.

The Hitman - A big time vice operator is trying to get set up again in McNeal County and the Sheriff is making things difficult. To get around those difficulties, a hit man is hired. This hit man is an old friend of the Sheriff.

Company Town- Sheriff Pusser investigates a missing man from a mining town. His wife is convinced that he has been killed because he was speaking out for better working questions. The more the sheriff looks around, the more crooked the setup seems.

Deadly Impact - The sheriff gets suspicious when a lady is run off the road. She is a pollution whistleblower and that raises eyebrows.

The Fire Within - A man with a gunshot wound runs the sheriff of the road. It turns out he is involved in a dangerous gun running operation. Before the accident, the victim made a confession to a priest but the priest refuses to divulge any information which might help the case.",1183852800,4,2348,4.527186761229315
2480001,4,B000E1EHQ8,"These episodes/stories are all fictional.

I saw all of the Walking tall movies as a child and recently bought them all on DVD.

I don't even remember knowing of the series when it was on TV.

I bought the series on DVD hoping that it was somewhat based on true life events from the life Buford Pusser.

I was very disappointed to find out that the series had nothing to do with the true life, events of the legendary hero of a Sheriff, Buford Pusser.

There is a disclaimer at the end of each episode that is barely readable due to the small print and blurriness that says something to the effect of the stories are fictional events based on the career of Buford Pusser and that all characters except for Buford Pusser and his family are fictious.

You should also be aware that this series is supposed to take place in the early eighties and Buford Pusser actually died in the mid seventies.

One interesting fact that I found while reading about Buford Pusser and the movies Walking tall on the Internet, is that Bo Svenson was the second highest paid person on TV at that time, second only to Johnny Carson on the Tonight Show.

One other interesting thing that I found while reading about Buford Pusser and the movies Walking tall and the TV series, was that in the TV series episode where Buford Pusser burns down the bar, footage from the movie is reused, notice that the car he is driving reverts back to the Chevrolet Impala as he arrives at the bar and when he leaves, but in the rest of the series the police cars are not Chevrolets.",1154217600,3,1544,4.411971830985915
2480002,4,B000E1EHQ8,"For me, Bo Svenson IS Buford Pusser.  Of course Joe Don Baker played the role in the first (And many say the BEST) film.

 But growing up in the late 70's and early 80's, it was Svenson's version that I saw the most.  Svenson played the part on film, in Part II:Walking Tall, and Final Chapter:Walking Tall.

 And in 1981, Svenson picked up the club again for this short lived TV show.

  I was 12 when the show came out and I loved it.  I had seen the 2nd and 1st film (in that order) and the story hooked me.  I watched every show.(Which is not a big deal, since only 7 were made, but still.)

 When I found out the DVD set of the show was coming out, I jumped at it.  But I knew that what I loved at age 12 might seem silly now.

  That is not the case.  If you are a fan of the film series, and not a hardcore ""Joe Don is Buford"" fan, then you should enjoy this try at a TV show.

 I don't think there is a 'clunker' in the set.  Sure, some of the plots have been done before, and you may figure out the 'twists' early on, but they are great fun to watch.

 Svenson makes a great Buford.  Some say he looked more like him then Joe Don did.

 The theme song stayed with me all these years, and it was a joy to hear it once again.

 And some posters have already mentioned the great guest stars-here's one they missed: Chuck Conners.  Though he doesn't go 'one on one' with Svenson's Buford, he is good in his role.

 if you are a 'Walking Tall' fan, this is a must buy!",1143417600,18,1472,3.9215017064846416
2480003,5,B000E1EHQ8,"Received my DVD set today and watched all of the epsiodes. The picture and sound on this DVD set is outstanding! The transfers look and sound better than the botched up Walking Tall movie set that Rhino released. Lets hope for a better release of the movies some time soon!

The Walking Tall TV series on DVD will not dissapoint! Thanks Sony for giving this show the care it deserved in your transfer to DVD!!",1142640000,3,409,4.453333333333333
2480004,5,B000E1EHQ8,Loved this series!  I'm glad it was released on DVD.  The writing was great for the time period and Bo Svensen did Buford Pusser justice.  The Music was perfect for the show.  Edd Kaleoff is a master.  Enjoyed the title theme as well brilliantly sung by Brad Mercer.  Will enjoy this DVD for years to come.,1142121600,6,306,4.375
2480005,4,B000E1EHQ8,"Actually I find this show more interesting and action packed than I originally remember after viewing the show 25 years ago. Its amazing this show made it to DVD,after its early cancellation and low ratings...I am thinking the recent Walking Tall movies (The Rock)have led the maker to seek some financial gain. And for me thats ok....glad to have this show on DVD and I hope everyone buys a copy. Its not the horrid disaster that it has been widely reported all these years.",1141776000,3,475,4.666666666666667
2480006,3,B000E1EHQ8,I thought they produced 13 episodes but it appears only 7 episodes are in the set.  My memory must not be serving me too well.  I remember this show coming on NBC as a mid-season replacement (1980-81) on Saturday nights.  The late Brandon Tartikoff talks about this series in his book The Last Great Ride and how he couldn't understand why it wasn't a success with the conservative tide sweeping the country on the heels of Reagan's election.,1137369600,10,442,4.641025641025641
2480007,5,B000E1EHQ8,"At last the series Walking Tall is coming to DVD. Merlin Olson, of Little House, guest stars as a hitman as well as Chuck Connors, L.Q. Jones, Ralph Bellamy and William Sanderson.",1135900800,8,179,4.625

2480032,5,B000E1EHQ8,"I have always liked ""WALKING TALL' series. Ilike to see him bring justce to wrongdoers. I also like to see that ""BIG STICK "" go against a wrogdoer's head.",1357257600,,154,4.344827586206897
2480033,5,B000E1EHQ8,"As a kid I saw the original movie and then parts 2 and 3 on late night movies. I finally got them on dvd. I remembered my Pop watching
this and I probably did too but don't remember any episodes. I found this cheap at flea market and I'm glad I added to collection.
Bo Svenson was one of the my favorite actors as a kid and he's great in this good classic All American Good Cop show! It seems
NBC did the cheap making this show but it still has great stories and acting and of course action! You would not see a show like this
on TV today which is just what most Americans want right NOW and would be a big hit. Too bad this show wasn't and did last longer.",1356134400,,657,3.91044776119403
2480034,5,B000E1EHQ8,So very glad to have this series back in my video collection.  This is a must have for any Buford Pusser fan.  This TVseries depicts Sheriff Pusser like his trilogy - two discs and 7 shows with justice being served with fairness and honesty.,1325548800,,241,4.454545454545454
2480035,5,B000E1EHQ8,I received this earlier than expected.  This came in just in time for christmas.  I was really pleased.  I thought it would end up being a late present.,1325203200,,152,4.357142857142857
2480036,3,B000E1EHQ8,"If you're a fan of the old Buford Pusser ""Walking Tall"" movies, then this fictional account is a good investment.  The story line does not make sense, since Buford Pusser died at the end of Walking Tall III and the county name is different.  This is a typical police drama of the early 1980's.  If you've never seen ""Walking Tall"" or aren't a fan, then don't bother buying this.",1322956800,,378,4.449275362318841
2480037,2,B000E1EHQ8,I really didn't care for it that much. I thought that Bo Stevenson stunk as the sheriff. The movie wasn't like the original one that was shown on T.V. years before. That one was GREAT! This one STUNK!,1273104000,,200,4.2894736842105265
2480038,5,B000E1EHQ8,"After reading the Buford Pusser biography by W.R. Morris, the fiction of the walking tall movies started with the first film not the television series. Liberties were taken while pusser was present during the first film and because of that it opened the door for more and more fiction. How accurate was ""tombstone""? not very much. More trouble comes to town in different varieties as sheriff Pusser tackles kidnappers, good friends gone bad, corporations, drug dealers, kkk, and mercenaries. As far as entertainment level the WT television series is better than the sequels and is probably just behind the original w/Joe Don Baker. Bo plays the sherrif without political correctness, treats everyone equally and tells it like it is. No cop on television today does that or has the presence that Svenson had, they are too hip, cool and hiding behind shades. There is more action in these episodes than in WT 2,3 and the drama is very good with Svenson giving a great performance. Fullscreen dvd looks and sounds good.",1227830400,4,1016,4.947368421052632

8103918,5,B000E1EHQ8,"This brings back a lot of memories. This is a true part of real life historical person who made it his mission to clean crime out in his community from Judges on down to mafia located in Nashville,Tennessee in the senate. He lost his wife and suffered many cuts,beatings,shootings,and finally surcomed to his corvette with the brakes tampered with. He crashed on the side of the road torn up and his children were on their way home when they saw the car in flames and saw their daddy dead. This SHERIFF BUFORD T. PUSSER,fought against racism by making his DEPUTY SHERIFF the first black man to hold this office. It is a lot more graphic in words and adult raw filth. Watch without children present. Or if you are offended do not buy this at all. When our family started watching this DVD we only saw 20 minutes and then off it went. It is saved only as a historical thing that happened in the area that we now live in.",1411603200,,918,4.374269005847953
