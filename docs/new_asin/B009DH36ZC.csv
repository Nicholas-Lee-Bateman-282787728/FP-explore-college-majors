5320213,5,B009DH36ZC,"I loved this tv medical series.  Chad Everett was the very dashing star.  The series was based on a college campus.  All the episodes were ""hip"" and appealed to the college-age and young people.  This series also had a lot of popular and legendary guest stars during that time.  Anyone who loves a good medical drama with a very handsome young doctor as its main focus along with an older, yet, wiser chief of surgery will love this series.  I'm so happy that it is finally coming out on DVD.  What took so long???",1356912000,,514,4.404255319148936
5320214,5,B009DH36ZC,Medical Center: The Complete Second Season is  FANTASTIC!  Waiting for Medical Center Season 3!  Can't beat great television like this.  Chad Everett was great and the guest stars were too!  Great memories!,1356393600,,206,5.3125
5320215,5,B009DH36ZC,ABSOLUTELY THRILLED WITH MEDICAL CENTER: THE COMPLETE SECOND SEASON.  WOULD LOVE TO SEE ALL THE SEASONS RELEASED (THE SOONER THE BETTER):),1355702400,,138,5.571428571428571
5320216,5,B009DH36ZC,I love the new energy the new season captures  - - - making the drama a little less dry - - - The social - family - medical issues are still handled quite directly by Dr. Gannon -  This series is better than the grimy boring Grey's Anatomy.,1354579200,,240,3.9791666666666665
5320217,5,B009DH36ZC,"I'm a little biased, because Chad Everett was my first crush...these shows bring back some really nice memories.  I'm looking forward to the upcoming seasons being released!",1352851200,,173,5.407407407407407
5320218,5,B009DH36ZC,I love the Medical Center season two DVD. It plays perfectly & I received it in very good condition I highly recommend it to my family & friends Who like Chad Everett. I can't wait until Medical Center season three DVD comes out! The picture & sound quality on this season is great!,1352851200,,282,4.339622641509434
5320219,5,B009DH36ZC,"Fan since day one and really enjoyed watching season 2. Cannot wait for all of the seasons of Medical Center to come out on DVD. The sound and picture quality are great. Come with the DVD a special bonus: all three variant endings for the Peter Strauss episode ""Countdown"".",1352073600,3,273,4.591836734693878
5320220,5,B009DH36ZC,I really enjoy watching Medical Center all over.  It is funny how different but yet still very entertaining it is as an adult versus a young kid. The show really addressed some very important issues of the day and had many big stars on the show. I hope the rest of the years are produced. I will be sure to purchase them. This was the best birthday gift I bought myself.,1351728000,5,370,4.211267605633803
5320221,5,B009DH36ZC,"Well it has finally arrived! The Complete Second Season of Medical Center. I am in love with Chad Everett all over again! Like the first season, the DVD's are of great quality in both sound and picture. When I originally saw the TV series of Medical Center, I was young,(ahh,so young) and looking back on it now, it is a wonder I was allowed to watch it at all. The panning in on Dr Joe Gannon's (Chad Everett) physique is disarming to say the least. Not good for this lady at 35 and some months of age!!! Also, like the first season, the themes presented are pressing issues of the time, and come to life with the very good acting and engaging guest stars. I am still a tad overawed by the attention to the medical and nursing details in the show, and I believe there are no medical shows today that even come near to ""Medical Center"" in this aspect. Thoroughly enjoyable... and I cannot wait for the third season and hopefully every other season after that, to be released by Warner's ! ( Please,pretty please.. ?)",1351123200,10,1016,4.409574468085107
5320222,5,B009DH36ZC,"I just bought the Season 2 of Medical Center and am thrilled with it. Fans purchasing this may be interested to know that the episode ""Woman in Question"" has been re-titled as ""Pitfall"". At first I was puzzled and thought ""Woman in Question"" had been left out but when I viewed ""Pitfall"" I saw that it was the same story with guest stars Brenda Scott and Dennis Cole.",1349308800,5,367,4.411764705882353
5320243,5,B009DH36ZC,Great show.....love to see Dr. Gannon still a very nice looking man.,1455667200,,68,4.75

5320246,5,B009DH36ZC,Loved it.,1438992000,,9,4.0
5320247,5,B009DH36ZC,"I liked this TV series a lot. It was difficult to find because Warners Bros (who practically own Hollywood) bought the rights from Turner who in part owned MGM which produced this show in the late  60's, and kept it shelved from the public until it was released not too long ago.  But the price ($50) is a little too high for a show that was cancelled in the mid 70's. Overall though, I am thankful it's available and I guess I'm going to have to save up a little more in order to get the other seasons.",1435104000,2,503,4.122448979591836

5320267,5,B009DH36ZC,"I'm very grateful to have these old shows on DVD, and the clothes are so much more interesting and fun to look at than the stuff young folks are wearing these days! They were tight enough to show off the great bodies, let's just say! And I am completely addicted to Chad Everett again; what a beautific, sensuous presence he was on-screen without even using any bedroom scenes. Dr. Gannon had the most wonderful bed-side manner of all the doctors at ""University Medical Center.""",1405987200,5,478,4.7023809523809526
5320268,4,B009DH36ZC,"Fun to watch, but enjoyed first season more.  Will want to get the third season, but not right away.",1404864000,,100,4.2631578947368425
5320269,5,B009DH36ZC,Amazon has the Medical Cener Series and I have them all.  Chad Everett was great as Dr. Gannon I love it.,1403481600,,105,4.0
5320270,5,B009DH36ZC,"I was very happy to be able to purchase this article, my sister's gift and she really, really loved it",1398729600,,102,4.15
5320271,5,B009DH36ZC,"Medical center was far more cutting edge than I remember.  Though a tad melodramatic,  the topic material was relevent to the era of production,  and handled with graceful though very direct honestly.  After seeing this in color (I had only seen it in black and white because in the 70's we only had a b&w tv) I didn't realize Chad Everetts eyes were so blue.  I'd.also forgotten what a handsome man he was.  Huba huba!  I'm in love all over again!

The DVD set for season two played beautifully in my player with clean crisp video with generally well balanced color.  The sound quality was decent though incostent betweed episodes.",1384646400,3,632,4.672727272727273
5320272,5,B009DH36ZC,I loved this show when it was on TV and I am so glad the first three seasons are out on DVD.,1383523200,,92,3.227272727272727
5320283,5,B009DH36ZC,This dvd arrived promptly and in excellent condition. This show was one of my favorites during it's first run. Chad Everett was always one of my favorite actors and the show portrayed medical care the way it should be. Doctors should know their patients and be kind and supportive as they were in this show. I look forward to the rest of the episodes becoming available.,1380931200,,370,4.621212121212121
5320284,5,B009DH36ZC,"Chad Evertt played a very good doctor, its hard to find good shows like this today.  Excellent! Excellent! Excellent Excellent",1378080000,,126,5.3

5320286,5,B009DH36ZC,Boy do I miss the days of doctors like Joe Gannon.  Looking forward to season 3.  All his series DVD's are worth seeing.,1375056000,,120,4.173913043478261
5320287,5,B009DH36ZC,"I can't say much more than I said in my Season 1 review. The show was getting into its stride for its coming long run. Season 2 does have the opening theme music my wife remembered from the show that wasn't in the first season.
This season is 24 episodes long with the only extras being 29 minutes on the last disk of alternate endings to the episode ""Countdown"" with guest star Peter Strauss.
Great color and video in the DVD set, a good and enjoyable show to see.",1374019200,,465,4.235955056179775
5320288,4,B009DH36ZC,the video was clear but the audio was not at times. I enjoyed revisiting a favorite show from when I was a teen.,1372809600,,112,3.9130434782608696
5320289,5,B009DH36ZC,This video is of great quality and is economically priced. I enjoyed every minute of it. I've watched it more than once. The series brought back a lot of memories.  I recommend it.,1366156800,,180,4.454545454545454
5320290,5,B009DH36ZC,"Grew up watching Medical Center and couldn't wait to buy Season 2!  It is great!  Good sound and picture!  Loved the episodes and what fun to see the ""retro"" decor in the scenes!  And of course, Chad Everett!  What more is there to say?  Can't wait for Season 3 to come out!",1364342400,,274,4.173076923076923
5320291,5,B009DH36ZC,Excellent TV show and who can resist those blue eyes?  I look forward to more seasons being released.  They don't make TV shows like this any more.,1364342400,,147,4.407407407407407
5320292,5,B009DH36ZC,"I have SO enjoyed watching tis old series!  I hope the rest of the series will continue to be put out on DVD soon!  Just can't get enough of my child-hood crush, Chad Everett.  And it's interesting to see how many of the stigmas from that era sadly still exist today.",1362960000,,267,4.196078431372549
5320313,5,B009DH36ZC,"Chad Everett was my favourite actor when I was a young girl...so  I was happy to see him again in the role of Dr. Gannon.
Only flaw of the DVDs  is the audio a bit low",1362787200,,167,3.611111111111111
5320314,5,B009DH36ZC,"I waited so long for this series to come out on DVD.  I have purchased both Season 1 and Season 2 and cannot wait for the next one ... Although the price for the sets seems abit high, to me it is worth the price.  This series dealt with issues ahead of it's time with candor and class.  Never had a doctor with the bedside manner of Dr. Joe ... Sure wish I had!  Highly recommend this series.",1361923200,2,392,3.9871794871794872
5320315,5,B009DH36ZC,Medical Center just fills a hole deep down inside of me. Chad Everett improves each year as an actor. I can't wait to catch the later seasons. Joe Gannon taught me about compassion as a young teenager and the lessons keep coming. That makes up for the antiquated medical practice of the 70's.,1360022400,,292,4.528301886792453
5320316,3,B009DH36ZC,"Some of the story lines are ridiculous as all the ""drama"" and ""theatrics"", but it brings me back so many memories of that time period of the early 70s.  I think the theme song they used in the 2nd season didn't match the show.  The FIRST season I thought was better and I even liked the theme song for it better in the FIRST season.  I remember the theme song in the 2nd season very well, but always thought it should have gone into a sports show, like a story about track and field, LOL!  It's a nice show with a lot of caring involved in the stories, but there's so much idealism as there was back in the 60s and 70s, even the 80s.  This doesn't happen in the real world.",1359158400,,673,4.068181818181818
5320317,5,B009DH36ZC,I love the sensitive story lines and the topics of that time.  I wish all doctors cared as much as Joe Gannon!!!,1359158400,,112,4.090909090909091
5320318,5,B009DH36ZC,A great show finally on DVD. Love all of the episodes. Sometimes funny because a show from the 70's is a little campy.,1358035200,,118,4.173913043478261
5320319,5,B009DH36ZC,"I have loved this program, and Chad Everett, since I was a young girl.  The quality of the DVDs is good and it is so wonderful to have them to play whenever there is nothing else on TV!",1357948800,,185,3.8684210526315788
5320320,5,B009DH36ZC,"Can't wait for more seasons to come out. Who does't want to watch this powerful medical drama that was way before it's time, and Chad Everett's good looks makes all episodes more enjoyable!",1357344000,,189,4.757575757575758
5320321,5,B009DH36ZC,"I was so sadden by the death of Chad Everett. I was only eight when Medical Center first aired. I could not wait to watch medical center with my mom but she had other plans. It was off to bed for me because I had school in the morning. So she'd put me to bed and when the coast was clear (my mom) then I would open my bedroom door just enough so I could watch from a far. I got caught once and was told to go back to bed. I did but then opened the door again and watched. My mom, who is no longer with me, told me once, had she known how much I like the show and that she was going to get flack for it several years later, she may have let me watch. Well, mom I'm watching it now. Still in my bedroom but with the door open. I look forward to all the other seasons to come. BUT please don't wait a year like you did between season one and two.",1357171200,7,843,3.7150837988826817

8540323,5,B009DH36ZC,"I remember watching ""Medical Center"" when I was 5, because the episodes I remember are from Season 2. ""Assailant"" is one of them. The story of a rape victim holds up very well for being almost 50 years old, though the draconian technique of pinning the screaming victim to her hospital bed isn't one I remember or even would recommend. Not helpful! The DVD transfers are fantastic. Colors have been restored and the soundtrack is excellent. Can't wait to order the rest of the series!",1489968000,,484,4.705882352941177
