8335810,3,B001QIRSF0,"I love Anna's series Bake. Thinking this would be like that I made the purchase. Having watched it, I feel a bit disappointed as it is nothing like her Bake series in terms of efficiency,  style and production quality. This is definitely for basic pastry making, not bad for beginners, but not for me. I understand this was in her early days, but overall not one of my faves.",1456012800,,375,4.434782608695652
