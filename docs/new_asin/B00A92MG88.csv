5401173,3,B00A92MG88,"I have enjoyed the scenery and the camera work that is featured in this movie. Julia Loktev is a great director.
I hated the story. Basically it's about 2 hipsters that are about to get married in 2 months who go to Georgia (country, not US state) for some awesome hiking with a guide. As it happens, things get real for them: a random passerby shoves a giant gun in their face for one reason or another. As you might expect: this happy-go-lucky pair freaked and were quite upset for the rest of the movie. Gone was their childish naivet of how everything is wonderful and happy in the world: people have guns in poor countries and they use them. After the incident: there was no coddling by their guide either, this made things a lot more upsetting for them. The guide was a sly fellow and caused some trouble of his own for this pair of bozos.
The only way I can relate to the storyline is from the NYT article a couple of years ago about a bunch of, similarly naive, 20-somethings moving into Bushwick, Brooklyn and then get robbed at gunpoint inside their apartment as they were just moving in. They were very surprised that this has happened to them. Yes, people have guns in poorer neighborhoods and they use them.
I would definitely watch this movie for the beautiful scenic vistas of Georgia. However if you are easily irritated by stupid, hapless urbanites - do not bother.",1358467200,17,1382,4.50996015936255
5401174,4,B00A92MG88,"In ""The Loneliest Planet,"" a young engaged couple -- Alex (Gael Garcia Bernal) and Nica (Hani Furstenberg) -- take a hiking trip across the Caucus Mountains in the Republic of Georgia (not the southern state).  They hire a local guide, Dato (played by Bidzina Gujabize who is an actual Georgian hiking guide) and joyfully trek into the wilderness.  The trio get along well, with Alex and Nica enjoying young love and Dato teaching them Georgian.  But then something unexpected happens that completely changes the tenor of the couple's relationship.

The movie is slow paced and likely to turn off many people who are looking for a thriller.  There is not much plot or dialogue, with numerous stretches simply following the trio as they hike.  The movie is beautiful to look at -- a bit of a Georgian travelogue -- but again not enough to hold the attention.  However, what the movie excels at is depicting the couple.  Bernal and Furstenberg have amazing chemistry together, and the movie shows the small things that demonstrate the strength and closeness of their relationship, such as their contest to see who can stand on their heads longer.  Silly stuff.

When the plot twist occurs (be forewarned that it is not a huge shocking twist), we instantly see how it has changed them.  The three main leads' naturalistic acting is tremendous, and the movie subtly examines big topics such as trust and masculinity.  That it does so without a plethora of dialogue is all the more impressive.",1357344000,11,1488,4.861111111111111

5401180,3,B00A92MG88,"This really could've been an absolutely amazing film. Brilliantly filmed in the country of Georgia in some of the most spectacular mountain scenery imaginable. The actors are obviously capable of excellent work. Even the basic theme of the film had a lot of promise. But the director chose to do the whole piece as though only photographed on the surface, not inhabited. The majority of words used in the film are the kinds of random nonsequitors that people say when they know each other well and have often discussed many other issues. Or the kinds of introductory banter a tour guide might use showing something to someone for the first time. And yet this film screams out for dialogue, for some sort of genuine interiority. We see the characters thinking; odd looks, frowns, queasy feelings, yet we never hear what anyone is thinking about. As if anyone ever simply has an expression divorced from thoughts. Or take a (the?) pivotal point in the film, a man points a gun at them. Then they walk on... and on... and on.. and THEY NEVER DISCUSS IT! When in history has such an event occurred among 20 or 30 somethings and there not been cascades of discussion? Supposedly this changes their relationship. I suspect the director mostly told them to stop talking. I think was a good demonstration of the limits of the ""show don't tell"" idea. There must be language and words. I could go on, I really wanted to love this film, but in the end I just wanted someone talk.",1427068800,2,1468,4.65

Personally, I thought it was OK and it seemed realistic enough, how people would act in their situation. But my BF was so pissed I made him sit through it. Literally NOTHING happens in the move for the first hour... not. a. thing.

5401184,2,B00A92MG88,"I had really high hopes for this movie since I love slow, arty movies and I love backpacking. Unfortunately I found this one to be slow beyond all tolerability. There were so many scenes that weren't beautiful, arty, or anything else other than just slow and pointless. So much of it ended up like an amateur was trying to do something artistic, but just couldn't pull it off. There were some scenes that worked, I do have to admit that. Some scenes were interesting and well acted and actually added to the story. Overall, though, it was kind of like a nice little short story that someone added a whole lot of pointless filler to so that it could be a novel. I have no movie making experience whatsoever, and at least half the movie I could have just gone out and filmed randomly on just about any hike I've been on. It's a shame the lead actors were mostly wasted, as was my time. Also wanted to add, that in terms of slow movies without much dialogue, I loved All is Lost with Robert Redford, never found it boring at all and I don't even care or know anything about sailing. So a not much dialogue movie about backpacking seemed like a sure bet for someone with my tastes. I'm convinced that everyone who gave this a positive review was trying to show how highbrow their movie tastes are, but not one of them would willingly ever sit through this movie again.",1418860800,,1364,4.395256916996048

That said, this film left me wanting to eat the DVD case it permanently belonged in, never to be opened and shared with the human population. The scenery was decent and the cinematography was nothing to write Grandmother about. Essentially, this was the cinematic equivalent of watching grass grow.

5401190,4,B00A92MG88,"The Loneliest Planet is one tough film to rate given the glacial pacing and general lack of drama. Two engaged lovers Alex and Nica (Gael Garcia
Bernal and Hani Furstenberg) embark on a long languid hike through the Caucasus mountains in Georgia with a local guide. Both actors are wonderful, crazy in love, we share many quiet intimate moments until an unexpected encounter with locals threatens everything. Bernal is always terrific and Miss Furstenberg is a real find. The scenery is gorgeous and is enjoyable as a travelogue. The film succeeds largely due to the chemistry of the two lovers until a jolting incident with local sheep herders causes Nica to question everything about her future husband. This brief incident involving a split second bad decision on Alex's part seems to carry a lot of baggage for some viewers. Will Nica be able to move past it? The ending does perhaps offer a hint of an answer. This is a wonderful little love story for some viewers. Pacing will certainly be an issue for some, I suppose 25-30 minutes could have been cut without hurting the film.",1404777600,,1084,4.802139037433155

5401193,5,B00A92MG88,"I agree with the other reviewers that this film is not mainstream. The fact that it's an indie film perhaps makes that obvious. What's not obvious is the quiet that speaks volumes. Not a lot of dialogue, barely any. Enough though.

This couple has the relationship we all want and envy. Intimate, close, perfectly paired.  I kept thinking who would they find to fit so well. They would never find what they have with each other:  Inside jokes, mutual relaxed fun, extreme intimacy and knowledge of each other's habits and wants, anticipating each others needs, never bored, always close and always taking care of the other without question. Giving and receiving to each other without question. Until...

I think the message of this movie is that you never really know someone. Or, the person and yourself isn't exactly what you thought. And when you see a chink...in the person or in yourself, what do you do about it? What does it mean for the relationship. Is he/she who you thought? Are you? Was everything else a lie because of the chink. Is the chink really a chasm?

This movie made me feel and think. I felt for each character separately. It created the ability for us to have empathy for each person, and feel agony, shame, and loneliness. As a bonus, the setting was gorgeous, and we got a key hole into the Georgian culture and unrest.",1388707200,8,1345,4.658227848101266
5401194,2,B00A92MG88,"A Western couple (played by Gael Garcia Bernal, who is actually Mexican and Hani Furstenberg, who is an Israeli) decide to hike in the Caucasus Mountains of the country of Georgia, taking as a guide a local man (Bidzina Gujabidze). The audience can see from the start that the guide is a bit of a screw loose, and that something nasty is going to happen to them, but they seem oblivious to it. I will not reveal more of the plot. I thought that this will be terribly self-indulgent (and many in the audience will feel that) but I find myself surprised in the first half of the movie for liking the film. However, something happens halfway, and the movie takes a wrong turn, not completely, but the second half of the film becomes not very believable and slow and quite a drag. Russian born Julia Loktev (why doesnt she wants to be called by her real name, Yulia Lokteva) directs. The rough outdoor beauty of Georgia certainly helps (I know this is a clich, but the land really becomes one of the characters of the film).",1388448000,,1020,4.459893048128342

5401205,4,B00A92MG88,"This film will move the one who has travelled long term, without any goal in mind but the journey itself.  This film captures the spirit of travel to foreign lands, enraptured with the momentary lapse of time, that only such travel can so viscerally travel.  We are often asked before we leave, where are you going? why are you going there? and for those of us who know this spirit, we cannot say, we just plan accordingly and go.  So The Lonely Planet captures this from start to end, though there is no definite beginning or end, as in life there is no beginning or end.  I could see many walking away dissatisified, because there is no explosions, no fancy cars, no guns, but this is not for the typical eye.  It is an artistic film, the characters expose us to love, the strife of interconnectedness and intimacy, and its unparalleled beauty.  To the wakeful eye, this film has something to offer, something of capturing the transcendent spirit of the mundane world.  The climax is unnerving, and a bit oddly placed, but in life, that is how such things go.  So, alas, we must move with it as it moves, and The Loneliest Planet provides us with a glimpse of that.",1376438400,,1167,4.497630331753554

A bonus is that nothing in the acting or direction of this movie is overblown or overwrought in the least. It looks like real people having an actual experience, and the acting is primo.",1376092800,2,491,4.72093023255814
5401207,1,B00A92MG88,Very boring waiting for climax (which was a surprising one) and the its boring after that. I definitely won't recommend this to my friends,1374451200,3,138,4.791666666666667
5401208,2,B00A92MG88,"I knew virtually nothing about this movie but for some reason it looked kinda' interesting so I took a flyer.  The film opens with Nica (Hani Furstenberg) a svelte young woman jumping up and down, as if on a trampoline, but...she's totally nude and covered in water.  The film goes downhill from there.

Nica was trying to keep warm I guess waiting for her fianc, Alex (Gael Garcia Bernal) to give her the final cold water rinse.  The pair, world travelers, are in the Republic of Georgia and have hired a guide to take them hiking and camping in the Caucasus Mountains.  So now I'm wondering what this is all about.  Is this vampire country?  Are we going the way of sex slavery?  Well for the first 40 minutes or so we see the loving couple and their husky local observe the beautiful topography and vistas of the mountains.  Certainly nothing wrong with that if you are expecting a travelogue.

Things change and I perked up when 3 Georgians confront the guide and the couple.  The guide and the locals get into a big argument, but unless you speak the language (no subtitles here) you would have to guess.  Suddenly one of the couples says something and it changes everything, for everybody.  I shouldn't give it away because that is what the film is about I guess.  Do the couple really know each other, especially in a crisis?  I stayed focus on trying to figure out what the locals were so pissed off about.  We never learn.  The guide who has limited English doesn't explain.  Maybe I'm the only one who didn't get it.  The journey continues for the trio but it's all quiet between them.  That's about it.

Directed and co-written (with Tom Bissell) by Julia Loktev, this film is just bizarre nonsense.  Obviously the filmmakers are trying to make a point about relationships, masculinity and morality.  But even a lover of art film will not likely have the patience to sit through this waste of time.",1372204800,2,1909,4.5828402366863905
5401209,1,B00A92MG88,"I'm first to confess to not being the sharpest knife in the drawer. For example, I have no idea how the title of this movie has anything to do with it. A lot of things in this film are confounding to me.

*********SPOILER ALERT*********

But most of all, in the most important scene of the movie, we never learn why the young boy was agitated, why the old man put a gun to the head of Alex, why it took so long for the guide to intervene, if he even did. Most important, why the guide was asked about it afterwards, briefly, but never replied.

That crucial scene, the one that gives the second half of the movie its reason for existence, is inexplicably unexplained.

I thought Alex acted normally during the scene. When the rifle first came out, he instinctively put Nica in front of him. Not the height of chivalry, of course, but self preservation instincts taking over, I guess. Then he quickly realized what he had to do, to shield Nica, and he stepped in front of her. He then didn't bawl, cringe or bargain. He stood, awaiting his fate, maybe hoping the rifle had only one bullet in it, for him only.

If Nica was disappointed in her to-be husband, and she was, she conveyed it through silence and separation. (Quite a useful communication skill there. One, fortunately, my wife never learned. Partly why we're married 44 years.) Alex tried to bring her back, but she made it much too hard for him.

Instead of Alex and Nica talking it out, the dialogue we do get are dumb jokes about birth control in China.

I thought this movie had the chance to be quite good. ""All"" it needed was a plot, editing (especially editing), and dialogue.

A half-star for the pluck of the actress playing Nica -- looked like a LOT of hiking -- and another for the remarkable Georgian landscape.

I kept hoping the loose ends, like the guide's string tricks, would be tied together. They never were.

This movie is a good litmus test for deciding which professional reviewers share our taste. Some loved this movie, some thoroughly disliked it. Now I know whose judgment matches mine.",1371340800,6,2072,4.53083109919571

5401219,5,B00A92MG88,"I'm going to say right away that `The Loneliest Planet' is not going to be a film for everyone.  It is very slow moving and far more observational than anything else.  It is going to bore quite a few and is going to feel almost too slight in its progression of themes for some, but for those who embrace the minimalist approach, `The Loneliest Planet' is going to be a true gem.

Julia Loktev's stunning film (the cinematography is nearly unmatched) tells the story of Nica and Alex, an engaged couple who are backpacking through the Caucasus Mountains.  They have a guide named Dato who is showing them the way and they are basically soaking in nature and each other before saying their vows.  While all seems well, a slight misunderstanding turns ugly and a singular mistake causes a riff between the couple that threatens to destroy their relationship.  It is in that one moment that so much about these two is exposed, and while the moment passes without physical tragedy, the emotional damage is already done.

The film is extremely subtle, even in that big moment, for it presents us with the tension and then dispels it without making it into some melodramatic experience.  It is frightening and tense and then ultimately a mere bump in the road.  What makes `The Loneliest Planet' so impactful is the way it allows those moments to settle in a very natural light.  Hani Furstenberg and Gael Garcia Bernal (about time he comes back with something noteworthy) are both extremely good here.  Furstenberg is especially moving in her emotional conundrum in the later part of the film, and the way that her character's expressions and dilemma is explored with such restraint is beautifully rendered.

8548554,3,B00A92MG88,"This is a film where as your watching you quickly realise why a lot of people don't like it.  First off the film starts with the female character jumping up and down naked in a shower so you're demographic opposed to full frontal nudity will turn it off right there.  You've shortly after got the guy with his face in her crotch (she's got underwear on) for an extended time so more people likely turned it off there. Later in the film the girl also needs to pee and for some reason her fiance seems to think shining a torch on her naked behind as she pees is a good idea when obviously the guide like the viewer could see everything. None of these scenes were necessary for the storyline or getting to know the characters and just seemed to be there for the shock value or maybe a word of mouth reason to get people to watch it. Because really nothing interesting happens in the film which if not for a minute or so scene with a three locals, could seemed to be something paid for by the Georgian tourism board, as it is just shots of a couple and their guide hiking up and down hills and valleys of Caucasus Mountains.

This is also a film without a lot of dialogue, it's a film that mostly revolves around three actors, it's a movie where nothing really happens, where ten minutes at a time can be footage of people taking down a tent, or sitting under a bit of plastic in the rain holding it up with one arm (not real sure why they didn't put up their tent, then at least you could read, lie down or whatever with both arms free while your waiting for the rain to stop).  It's also a film that just ends without an ending, were they supposed to be return to shoot the next day, someone got sick, the camera crew or whatever got an offer to work on a better movie.  Eventually enough time passed that they just decided to use whatever footage they had.  The only event in the movie we don't have subtitles to know what's being said by the Georgian's or the guide, sure likely we're supposed to be kept in the dark and not know what is going on as if we are in the couple's shoes, but it's pretty unrealistic that no one would talk about it afterwards, especially when you considered how one of them acted during it.

Still I didn't mind the movie, the scenery was good.  Perhaps it's because I have backpacked a lot Eastern Europe myself so can put myself in their shoes (although I certainly wouldn't act like them). But at times like the early night club scene I have witnessed creepy local guys get in the personal space of female backpackers and no one seems to do anything about it.  I have also seen your negative stereotype western tourists acting like someone's country is their playground, as these two do.",1467763200,,2718,4.313725490196078
8548555,2,B00A92MG88,"I agree with another reviewer - this movie could have been an absolutely amazing film. The filmwork was superb, and after seeing the spectacular mountain scenery, I am now planning a trekking trip to Georgia. The actors are obviously talented and the basic story had a lot of promise. The dialogue was lame and boring - when there was dialogue.  I am a huge fan of indie films and was very excited about this one.  But I was bored to tears.  It would have been much better if presented as a study of the guide as a person (rather than an actor) or as a nature film. I could go on, I really wanted to love this film, but in the end I just wanted someone talk.",1463961600,,658,4.165354330708661
