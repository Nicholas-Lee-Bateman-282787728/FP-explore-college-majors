8167496,5,B000MAFXQE,"The first half of the 20th century is the most interesting history, to me. The stories of these courageous women only added to my
fascination. What a world. Very nice documentary.",1418774400,,179,4.806451612903226
8167497,5,B000MAFXQE,"This was a very honest depiction of the American (and particularly women's) involvement in the Spanish Civil War.
Very worthwhile.",1403049600,,130,5.55

8167499,5,B000MAFXQE,"Got this and watched it this week.  It is incredible.  I think that one is so taken with the women themselves that the technique of the film is kind of ignored.  Although after saying that I think the film is well put together and is a good combination of current interviews, archive footage and readings from the letters and other written works of the various women who were involved in some way.

The thing that is overwhelming is the kind of off handed way these women refer to what they did.  They seem to think that they had no other choice then to fight (yes I know they were not in the front lines with a gun) fascism then and there.  It is interesting because most Americans didn't seem to feel that way at all, nor did most of the rest of the world.  There are always, I guess, only a few who are willing to step up and be counted in each generation.

Watching it, makes me feel a little less satisfied with how I've lived my own life.  If one compares one's self with the women in this movie, one is probably going to come up short.

One final thing I'd like to mention.  The government that was elected by a majority of the Spanish citizens was not a communist government.  However, the only state that was willing to put its money behind the Republicans was the Soviet Union.  The only group of people who were completely committed to fighting fascism then and there were the communists (and of course the anarchists).  The people who originally set out to over throw the democratic government of Spain were not communists, but were fascists supported by other fascist nations and of course your conservatives in almost every country.",1373673600,4,1646,4.47986577181208

8167501,5,B000MAFXQE,"I purchased this after seeing the HBO Movie Gelhorn and Hemingway, but this film informs  the viewer of many women worldwide who felt the need to personally contribute to the world and stamp out facism. MUST SEE TV.  Vintage stock clips, pictures, make this an historical treasure trove. Interviews and remembrances by the women are priceless as well.  Thoroughly enjoyable and inspirational.",1342137600,2,392,5.290322580645161
8167502,5,B000MAFXQE,"This documentary speaks about American women who volunteered to fight against fascists in Spain.  On a happy note, all the 80 women who went survived.

The work is a blend of interviews and selections from writings.  I don't know if all the writings were letters, but this work had an epistolary style like Walker's ""The Color Purple.""  This work showed living women and demonstrates how these brave young fighters became respectable old ladies.  The speeches were probably from dead women and I'm sure the living women who spoke them must have been honored to do it.  If you are impressed by Eleanor Roosevelt, and who isn't, then you will love her more after seeing this.  Some viewers may not like this epistolary style and might prefer straight forward narration instead.

This work said that many nationalities came to fight in Spain, not just Americans.  I am sure that documentary makers in other countries could create counterparts to this work.  The documentary emphasizes that Spain was very much a precursor or omen for World War II.  For younger audiences, the tragedies of Darfur may seem similar to the 1930s Spain presented here.  One Black fighter compared the situation in Spain to the racism in the US.  Many of the women interviewed seemed to be of a certain religion, but they are never seen saying they fought in Spain to fight the oppression that their religious peers faced in Europe.

The work interviews one African-American woman who fought.  The work does not limit itself to gender.  There are numerous photographs and some talk of the African-American men involved in this effort.  They show a photo of Paul Robeson but never mention him by name.  Robin D.G. Kelly has a wonderful chapter about the Black men who fought in Spain in his ""Race Rebels"" book.  I think a progressive history major could write a fabulous paper comparing that chapter to this documentary.",1202947200,13,1894,4.8808777429467085
