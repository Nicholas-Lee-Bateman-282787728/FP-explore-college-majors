7764381,4,B01GP4HSI6,"This was considerably more entertaining than I thought it was going to be.  It had a great story from start to finish that all came together, it didn't copy cat any particular movie storyline as so many seem to do these days, and had my wife and I laughing pretty loudly quite a few times.  All in all, a great movie to pass a couple hours of your Saturday night time!",1474848000,,368,4.169014084507042

7764384,4,B01GP4HSI6,"4 stars might be a bit of a stretch, but I really enjoyed this film.  Production quality was good.  The plot was better than most spring break movies.  The acting was believable (not terrible).  If you're in the mood for a light, fun comedy then this should suffice.",1473638400,,266,4.479166666666667

8763233,5,B01GP4HSI6,"If you're 18 and in high school, you may love this film.  If you're 28 and in the real world, you may want to go back to high school.  If you're 38, seeing this movie may make you want to go to Mexico. If you're 48 and you've seen this movie and you haven't been to Mexico....what are you waiting for? If you're 58, seeing this movie may make you want to sample Mezcal if you haven't already. If you're 68, or 78, or 88, then seeing this movie may make you want to go for a ride in a Mexican Taxi. And if you're 98 and you just saw this movie - I want to buy you a beer.

Oh.  Yeah.  And by the way, the movie rocks.  But so did my first-ever movie screenwriting credit, 'Revenge of the Nerds'.

What more can I say?  Except that, and no offense to anyone, but the Mexican title of this movie is insanely great...especially if you speak Spanish.  And even if you don't.  And one final thing: there is some fine, fine acting in this film but Silverio Palacios (in the role of ""Chuy"") is so insane that he literally defies description.",1486771200,2,1033,4.0945273631840795

8763237,4,B01GP4HSI6,"Well,, bust my buttons if this movie didn't surprise me. I did laugh and I did laugh a lot! I also had those, why are you listening to your friend when you know he is just going to get you into trouble moments. This is the story of Logan who wants to be a DJ but dad thinks that is a waste of time and his friend Blake who always gets logan into trouble. Well, lits just say that dad trusts Logan one more time and well, Blake talks him into going to sprig break in Mexico where all hell breaks loose and one bad thing after another happens to Logan. I want to tell you that you will be screaming....please don't do that! a lot. But they do it. The actors are all very likable and very energetic. P.S. I love the tour guide/driver they have he is great. Do I recommend it, I do, be aware lots of upper ladies parts going on.",1478908800,2,824,4.0
