3694910,3,B001MAA6WO,"Have you seen dramas where everything seems overly melodrmatic and overdone? This movie fits the bill. The movie tries to be great and seems to have been created with a great vision. But the vision and the story were not executed well at all except maybe in the last 20 minutes.

This film is not a martial arts epic. The action sequences are mostly unexciting and uninspiring battle sequences. Jet Li does a few of his old martial art tricks, but they are not central to the story or the action sequences.

The problem is that the battle sequences and their consequences are nearly 2/3 of the movie they are not even all that important to the story. The real intrigue is the triangle love relationship between the main characters. One great omission in the storyline is never answering why does the main female character maintains the triangular relationship? What is HER motivation and objective? Her character is central and is perhaps the most important role and yet she is relegated to just being passive victim to the circumstances and men around her.

The last 20 minutes brings the triangular relationship to the center. And that's when things get really intersting. The movie still could have done a better job of properly dramatizing key sequences, but the storyline picks up a notch or two in its drama and intrigue. If not for the last 20 minutes, I would have given this movie 2 stars at the most.

Overall, this is a decent film.",1271462400,,1443,4.691699604743083
3694911,2,B001MAA6WO,"Hey~

I watch a lot of films, especially Kung Fu Chinese Jet Li types. I love these types of movies. But this film was not that great. THere should be no five stars here... why? Not very cohesive, in the middle of the movie on, it gets lost for like a half an hour..you literally don't know what going on, and where the Army is at. The whole movie they talk about taking Nanking, and then ""presto"" it's taken over, and the only way you knew Nanking was won and was taken over, is because there is some random conversation about it after the fact...though near the end, there seems to have a coming together, but it was profound or anything. It seems like the theme of the movie was its okay to kill as long as it is for the betterment of mankind. And keep your promises..but all throughout, Too much blood, super violent- almost strangely out of context....kind of like, ""hey, war is bloody."" and I, the viewer is like, yep, I get that. I didn't watch this movie to see a thousand guys get their necks slashed... Jet li kind of sold out here...no serious action scenes up close, or great acting. The war actions were not that great...It was just mediocre, to below mediocre. The costumes were nice.

I cannot say how much I do like ""these sort of films"", but the quality was loose, vague, and didn't ever draw me in. The brotherhood concept lacked much. It never felt authentic, and the concept of the film was based on this to the very bloody end. Watch Hero again, even if you've seen it a thousand times...it'll still be better the 1001st time than this film. I wouldn't waste your money, but don't take my word for it. Spend the money for yourself to see what I mean...or save two hours of your life, and go for a walk outside. See the birds chirp and flowers. Its spring.",1271116800,2,1776,4.346385542168675
3694912,5,B001MAA6WO,"This movie drew me in far more than I expected. Well acted, good character development and with a coherent plot.  Thumbs up!
This was my first try with Amazon's Digital movie rental and I will definitely be doing this again.  Watched it on my laptop via Wi-fi in a motel room.",1271030400,,276,4.392156862745098
3694913,5,B001MAA6WO,"General Pang Qing Yun is the sole survivor of his entire battalion. The Ching army was taken out against Taiping rebels in Hechuan. A woman named Lian spends the night with Pang and leaves before he wakes the next morning. Jiang Wuyang, one of the bandits that rides into the town Pang currently finds himself in, is impressed with Pang's fighting skills and introduces Pang to Zhao Er Hu. Jiang and Er Hu take Pang to their village where Pang is reunited with Lian who just so happens to be Er Hu's wife. The bandits from the village overthrow a passing food convoy and that is thought to be a resolution to their current desperation until the imperial army invades and usurps the food that they stole. Pang, Er Hu, and Jiang take a blood oath to become blood brothers before joining Lord Chen's army. With the odds against them, their 800 soldiers get the upper hand on Shu City's 5,000 as plans are put into motion to overthrow Suzhou and Nanjing, the capital. The brothers soon begin to fall apart on their rise to the top. Er Hu tends to be loyal with his word and his brothers no matter what as Pang will sacrifice anyone and even make deals with his enemies just to win while Jiang is stuck in the middle.

This movie is phenomenal. The battle sequences are stunning, the cinematography is brilliant, and the acting is top notch. The Warlords took everything that was fantastic about Mongol and made it just a little bit better. Jet Li deserves a mention. After seeing Unleashed and Fearless, it was nice to see him actually show his acting chops again. The desire to see him at that acting capacity was high, so it was quite a treat to see him at that caliber once again. After The Forbidden Kingdom and his rather stale performance in that, it's become a bit difficult what to expect from him other than him displaying how talented he is at martial arts. Fortunately, he did a great job in this as he showed just about every emotion in this film at some time or another. His fight scenes were also incredible, but that is kind of a given. Andy Lau also deserves a nod. His character is just so passionate about being honorable and loyal that when things go wrong, his reaction is just explosive. He has some really powerful scenes where he's fighting for what he thinks is right. There's a scene where a play is mocking him and his brothers while he's eating dinner. He begins to laugh, which leads to him crying uncontrollably, and then he begins laughing again. He just managed to pull it off flawlessly and it was incredibly impressive.

The battle scenes didn't pull any punches either. Blood flies across the screen as limbs roll on the ground. It's truly fantastic. They are the highlight of the film as the first half seems to not pull away from the battlefield. The film is also extremely colorful. Every scene is stunningly vibrant. There are so many memorable scenes from the film and half of that is due to how they were shot. There's a scene where Er Hu runs into a coliseum where there are just hundreds of dead bodies lying on the ground and the camera does a 360 degree motion around him capturing his emotions and the devastation that lies around him. It's amazing.

The Warlords is one of the best Chinese war epics I've ever seen. Not that I've seen too many of them, but even in comparison to feudal Japan films, it's one of the best.  If you were a fan of films like Mongol: The Rise of Genghis Kahn, The Last Samurai, or Seven Samurai, then this comes highly recommended. It's the type of film that shouldn't be missed by anyone.",1268524800,14,3559,4.487654320987654

The main character is wonderfully portrayed and given depth by excellent acting.  Well worth a few minutes online before viewing, to review key elements of the period in question.
SPOILER ALERT: if you know the actual history, the ending is no surprise.

For those reviewers who didn't like the fight scenes: (1) the movie really isn't about fight scenes; it's not a martial arts movie; (2) real life is a lot messier and less sophisticated than dojo practice or tournament kendo (or whatever your choice of methods is).",1443657600,2,774,5.319672131147541

3694938,5,B001MAA6WO,"The Warlords is an historical drama/action movie that takes place in China during the  1860's about the time of our own Civil War.  This about the real Warlords involved in this Chinese Civil War. Jet Li is General Pang.  When the movie begins we se a filed of dead bodies, the slain soldiers of General Pang.  He is the only survivor among his troops. The events of the movie are based on real events that took place in China during this time period.  The movie automatically plays with an English soundtrack and rather than have the voices dubbed into English with Chinese accents, they speak regular English and I did not like that so I switched it the original Mandarin with English subtitles.  It made the movie more realistic.  The action is well directed.  The battle sequences are not filled with unrealistic marital arts sequences, but depict real battle scenes.  Jet Li is a good actor and Takeshi Kaneshiro is fun to watch.  He can also be seen in the two part epic Red Cliff.  The story is well told and mostly easy to follow.  I enjoyed the movie. If you like historical movies about the History of China, this is a good movie.",1441324800,3,1140,4.534313725490196

3695008,5,B001MAA6WO,"Different from most martial movies that you may have watched, The Warlords has a gloomy realism through the whole movie. Set during the Taiping rebellion of Qing dynasty, the story demonstrates the struggles between friendship, loyalty, and ideal through a series of event of the raise and fall of Pang Qingyun, the warlord. The tragic ending of the movie is full of artistic expression, and manifests the fatalism of common people in comparison to the ruling class.

3695025,4,B001MAA6WO,"This movie focuses on the path to ""redemption"" of the general portrayed by Jet Li. He suffers a big failure in battle, and the movie then recounts the story of how he fought to finish his life goal, how he made friends along the way, and the political battles he had to face.

It's not your classic American action film. So the story development and the action can seem a little slow at times.

To me, this was more about the drama and the semi-historical story telling than fighting and killing.

It was interesting to see the struggles of Jet Li's character as he goes from a person with strong values to then be manipulated into political schemes.",1416700800,,650,4.491525423728813

In some movies the subtitles fly by so fast.  In actuality, this was easy to keep up and it was a well-made film and the dialog was not rapid fire.  If you like war films, this one is about civil war in China where powerful war lords commanded vast armies to combat each other.  The story focuses on the journey of the main character from being a defeated commander who faked his death to survive a great battle to one of being a great warrior leader with many difficult decisions to make along the way. There's even a love triangle in this movie, although subtle.  It's amazing just how poor people were back then, and to have food and be guaranteed a meager life, the men needed to join the winning army so their families could exist in their dirty villages.  The movie actually held my attention much more than I would have thought.",1404345600,,972,4.407821229050279

If I see Andy Lau and/or Takeshi Hanishiro on the cover of a movie it's an automatic must-see for me. They are always a dynamite pairing in films and this one lived up to my expectations. It's not the absolute best movie I've seen them in, but it is very well-done. Heart-rending.

3695074,3,B001MAA6WO,"I found this film watchable, but nothing more and it is a pity, because it had potential for so much more... Below, more of my impressions, with some spoilers.

This film tells the story of three very different men who meet and conclude a pact of brotherhood in the middle of the Taiping War (1850-1864), an incredibly violent and tragic conflict which caused quite possibly as much as 20 million dead - making it the second deadliest war in the whole history of humanity (only Second World War killed more people).

A big budget super production about such an enormous and destructive war was a great idea - but the result is not as good as could be expected. The film is long and there is not enough story to fill the 127 minutes. Battle scenes are disappointing and we can hardly see on the screen where the heck went the amount of money spend on making this film. Chinese armies of Taiping War were colourful and spectacular - and what we see on the screen is neither.

Because this is a Chinese story there is of course some elaborate intriguing, plotting and backstabbing, but we saw this kind of things already on the screen many times - and they were shown much better. It must also be said that Jet Li is not really an actor - he is a martial arts specialist, and when in a film he is not allowed to kick and scream, he seems as paralyzed as a bird staring at a snake... He got 15 million USD for this film - and in my modest opinion he didn't earn it...

That being said the film has also some merits. Andy Lau and Takeshi Kaneshiro are real actors and it shows on the screen. Xu Jinglei is a very attractive woman and even if her screen time is ultimately limited, it is a pleasure to watch her. This film also avoids - very wisely - showing idiotic kung fu which so badly damaged so many potentially good Asian films... And  yes, there are some good scenes, although they become rare in the second half of the film.

Bottom line, this is an average war/adventure film, watchable once and recommended for renting rather than buying. Sadly, a really good, epic film about the Taiping War still remains to be made.",1400803200,,2123,4.375634517766497

3695098,4,B001MAA6WO,"Very well-done epic portraying a period during the Ching dynasty. Jet Li did an excellent job in this gritty, dark film. this film concerned itself with brotherhood and love during the wars, and although I would rather have seen a more historic piece, the directors did use some of the historical facts in this movie. It was definitely worth the watch as it really tells a tale that sucks you in. 4 stars simply because brotherhood and love were more important to the story than the actual historical reasons behind the events of the period. This is an excellent film, however, and like so many Occidental movies that include some 'unsolved historical mystery', this one at least attempts to give an answer to the question.

Bandits become warriors, and warriors become victors, and then the generals are destroyed by the diplomatic and power-hungry warlords who really finance the wars, but do not fight themselves but orchestrate them.

The telling of the story about the relationship between the three blood brothers, General Pang and Lady Hu is touching and well done.

The movie is subtitled, but I almost don't realize it.  There are a few false notes, when the acting is somewhat over the top.  Can't quite label it, but it does not detract significantly from the performances for me.

It seems like I understand the language.  I am beginning to listen for words I can associate with the subtitles.  I can pronounce the names of the protagonists and I can associate certain spoken words with the subtitle.

I enjoyed this story.  It's about empathy, loyalty, commitment, love, chance, opportunity, vision, the caprice of life, and betrayal on multiple levels.",1390089600,,980,4.666666666666667

3695142,2,B001MAA6WO,"The movie itself was stunningly clear and the visuals themselves were good--there is no question that the movie is excellent in this regard. The sound and the scenes were both clear and were rich in detail--the film also was good in this regard.

Note, however, that the rest of this review I'm writing after watching the movie, and this may give most of the movie away. The entire storyline is actually based around a true one, where a soldier's army is betrayed and left to die--he survives by acting dead until it is over. To quickly move on, he joins a band of bandits and convinces their leader, as well as another man, to become co-leaders of a new army that will fight for justice, etc. and these three become brothers by pact--and whoever betrays the brothers, dies.

Sadly, what happens eventually after winning several victories is that the main character (the leading general) ends up short of supplies to take a vital city to finish the war that his army is fighting. They eventually begin to starve, before finally taking the city, in the hope that the second leader of the group will allow them to respectfully surrender and be fed. However, the main character has him chained until all the surrendered army, encased within the walls of the now conquered city, are shot with several rounds of arrows. After this, the story becomes even more disparaging, as the girlfriend of the main leader and his friend both are killed, as on both sides, there is a misunderstanding which leads to their fatal deaths. Finally, the third ""brother"", in seeing what has happened, in how his original friend has become powerful, but also evil and disloyal to the pact, decides to honor the original pact. On the day that the general is to become the governor, his remaining friend rushes up and stabs him. Both men fight in the end, and the original character (the soldier, now general, now governor) asks finally, at the final moments, that he should die. From there, the movie ends.

Now, I did not write this merely to give a synopsis, but to seriously ask, ""What was the point of the film?"" Generally, fiction in itself is garbage, but when telling a true epic, there must be a reason why. The loyalty of the men who became brothers was broken--but this isn't directly communicated as well as it should be for a main subject. How did it affect history? Why was this movie made? Why is it important? Was it simply to entertain? With other movies centered around a central character, such as ""Braveheart"", where the main character also dies (only by being publicly executed), it actually has a serious point to it, because Wallace's death and legacy was an important part of Scottish history, but it felt like the death was not empty. In that example, it was actually encouraging somewhat because it was depicted as heroic. It wasn't for betrayal or for being dishonorable to a brother, as in what we see in ""The Warlords"".

In this film's case, the ending deaths quickly happened and in seemingly rapid succession with the betrayals, and it is not a film I personally would want to watch again, with others or alone. It doesn't encourage--it actually leads the viewer (or at least in my opinion) to want to do anything to forget about the movie after seriously reflecting on its meaning. Obviously, with respect to the film, this must have been an important point for Chinese history, as dates are mentioned and the story is carefully portrayed in this film, but outside of the importance of sanity, loyalty, and perhaps the post-war mind after war, there are better films that could be seen on this subject with much more powerful points and endings. This film, does, however, have excellent filming throughout, and in that area, gets all five stars--by watching it, it is masterfully edited. The contrasts in lighting and sweeping, distant scenes in some parts of the movie give a sense of depth, but the eventual end of the film takes this away, after starting with victories and a close bond. But this is only my opinion, like any other viewer...",1382659200,,4049,4.7227722772277225

But the story is a Classic Tragedy in every way, the film was beautifully made, the acting was superb. It's heart wrenching, but well presented and I understood the nature and motivation of each of the main characters. General Pang was brilliant, driven, at moments a little mad, but he had a vision. The tragedy that eventually came from his actions was oddly a lesson for today.
The poor reviews I've read here on Amazon made me think that a lot of people just didn't understand what they were seeing, they somehow missed the real struggle. The characterization of General Pang (Jet Li) a villian is not accurate. He was obsessed with being right but terribly misguided, and you know that from the tone of the narrator from early on.
There is a samarai movie called Samarai Twilight that a reviewer rated very badly, because it took him half the movie to realize there were no vampires. Funniest review I EVER saw.

I thought the acting was fine by all (I probably wouldn't have been interested in watching it if it weren't for Jet Li).  I do question whether or not any of the animals in the this film were actually harmed.  I think I am going to swear off of any more Asian films as they do not have laws & organizations to protect the animals in filming. I would be EXTREMELY disappointed in Jet Li if he did participate in the making of a movie in which animals were treated with such disregard. The American Humane Association rates some of the newer movies, as well as having an archive of older movies which you can review before supporting any film if interested....  Unfortunately, this one is not listed on their website.

But John Wu had a lot more trouble, and ""Red Cliff"" {international cut/2 parts} was incredible.  The Warlords seemed bored and straining to produce anger and fierceness.  I hate to descredit any Chinese filmmaking because those guys are getting truly masterful with their action and epics.  Goodness knows it's hard for them to get their money/backing for these movies--and it's so interesting to see Chinese history instead of having to read it from some dull old Brit in the last half century.  For good background writing on China and Korea, you still need to read Pearl Buck for the truth and a good yarn.

The story is compelling since it is based on real events, and it is tragic all the way around.  It shows you the evils of war, and how dehumanizing war is in general.  Principles can be betrayed too easily on war in order to get a win, and the weakness and frailty of our humanity is displayed here in its crudest form.

You have a choice between English dubbed (which I hate) and original Chinese (Mandarin?). That is  all. According to the Product description, there are supposed to be subs. Did I miss somehting?

I normally like to watch any foreign film in it's original language with subtitles on. I feel that you lose a LOT of mood, ambience, and the actors performance when it is dubbed no matter how well it is done. Also, there are a lot of scenes where the actor is speaking with a low voice or mumbling. I had to listen to them several times and even then I did not always understand what was said. I thought Blu-Rays had all this space? How hard is it to put in subtitles? What about the hard of hearing?

Others have complained about the movie being clipped. I know nothing about that, but I did find that this version of the film appeared to have one major scene missing. There was supposed ot be this great battle for control of the last city, but it we get is a few scenes of soldiers running down the streets with a narrator saying that the battle was already won.

It sounds exactly like a 1970's low class English dubbing of a cheap Hong Kong kung fu movie. Same cheap, unexpressive English accents definitely not synchronized to the actors. Since this movie has been getting great reviews, you have to wonder what whoever authorized the dubbing was thinking.

I heard also that the distributor cut out 1/2 hour. Together with the fact that the normal DVD version is not packaged with the Blu Ray, makes this version somewhat expensive for what you get.",1294099200,,811,4.711267605633803
3695193,3,B001MAA6WO,"Like Red Cliff, The Warlords is a martial arts movie in a different sense of the word. While there are a couple scenes with Jet Li dishing out some wushu, the bulk of the action consists of large scale battles, sieges, and raids.

That said, there is definitely a rock hard moral core at the heart of this movie that fits with what I like about more typical martial arts movies: the sense of honor and the importance of male bonding over personal gain. What gives this movie its heart is that the brotherhood created by the characters played by the three male leads spins apart and leads to tragic consequences.

A little background on the Taiping rebellion, even a blurb from Wikipedia or the like, would be a good thing to read as the movie clearly assumes we know a bit about it. By and large though, this information would make the film richer but not knowing it does not impair your ability to follow the story.  The position of each male protagonist is a little vague at the start of the film, but this again is a minor issue.

The battle scenes in this movie are astounding. Some really shocking shots with limbs being severed, etc. It's graphic, but not gratuitous. Despite all the effects and costumes and such, the film never loses its emotional core. I was surprised how much I came to care about the brotherhood of these three men in under two hours.  That said, there were a few scenes that did drag a little, and this would be another slight flaw with the movie.

Of course, the length of the movie brings me to the major problem with the US release. From what I understand, 15 minutes has been cut from this film for the US release. why? Why? WHY??? Other reviews suggest the cut footage - as was the case in the US version of Fearless - eliminate scenes that enhance the emotional power of the story. In the case of Fearless, I luckily obtained and watched the full director's cut of the international release so I was able to see the intended version of the movie.  However, no such option is available for us Yankees with The Warlords, and I have no doubt that the film suffers from the missing footage.

I find it increasingly irritating that I have to be careful to purchase or am simply unable to purchase the unedited version of so many films from overseas.  DVDs and blu-rays can store a lot of information on them. There is not reason not to release a movie with the original cut as well as the 'for dopey Americans' cut. Let the viewer decide if it's going to kill them to spend 15 more minutes with the film!

Anyway, while the pacing is a little slow at times and some of the details of the story are sketchy given the lack of historical background and the missing footage (most likely), I enjoyed watching The Warlords, though I wish I had the real movie - not a cut version - for my DVD collection. I can't give the DVD release for the film more than 3 stars due to this poor packaging decision.",1292976000,24,2924,4.388170055452865
3695194,4,B001MAA6WO,"Revisiting the old standard plot of friends through war who are driven apart by the cost of victory and the machinations of politicians who fear their united power (already filmed in 1973 as Blood Brothers), Peter Chan's The Warlords is an excellent old-fashioned epic set against the 14-year Taipeng Rebellion. Following an initially unrecognisable Jet Li's betrayed general as he teams up with Andy Lau and Takeshi Kaneshiro's bandit brothers and instils an idealism in them that he loses himself as he comes closer to achieving his goals, it's a grim picture of war, not glamorising its protagonists - they seal their pact by murdering three strangers - and which weighs up the moral consequences of its atrocities as personal morality becomes an increasingly flexible commodity (though like most Chinese government sanctioned films ultimately takes the view that a few thousand innocents massacred are a necessary price to pay for the majority to live in harmony). The big battle scene and gritty battle montages are certainly very spectacular and look real enough - there's CGI used, but it's seamless - though the horse falls are rather worryingly unnecessary. Nonetheless an impressive cut above the usual Chinese period battle movie.

The US and UK DVD and Blu-ray releases are both cut by 12 minutes, but the Chinese two disc NTSC release from Zoke Culture includes the uncut version with optional English subtitles, 3 trailers, making of featurette (with English subtitles) as well as a longer documentary and 58 minutes of blog featurettes.",1292457600,,1551,5.179282868525896

I enjoyed the movie, don't get me wrong, but if I compare it to how much I enjoyed, say Red Cliff, it just wasn't as good. Too much was predictable and it didn't quite live up to the experience I expected from the previews and the cast.

I had high expectations and felt a little let down. I would actually give it a 4.5 if that was possible. It's not a bad movie by any means but when you're finished watching it, and your reaction is: It wasn't too bad, it was pretty good, then it just isn't 5 stars, imo. It could've been 5 stars without a doubt.
It's like when you eat a good meal and you come away feeling like there was just
something missing in the recipe that kept it from being great.

I also give it 4.5 simply because of the actors and their strength to carry the roles so well and the price I paid which was about $17 with free shipping. I blame what shortcomings the movie has on the director.

This movie is twice as good when watched in Chinese with subtitles. Better yet, watch once with subtitles then again without to really bask in the massively epic cinematography. Some gorgeous shots of China in here, and many incredibly huge, tightly choreographed battle scenes.

The acting is very good in general, and Jet Li is a whole new category of solid here. Easily his best performance, and the direction is crisp and never sloppy or lingering, which makes everything including Li that much more captivating.

Didn't know this period of Chinese history much; if I had, I'd probably worship this film. As it is, I liked it a lot anyhow. The script has some very fine lines and ideas as well; many deep issues of society, war and brotherhood are explored in ways Hollywood never would.

The blu-ray picture is pleasantly grainy, looking very film-like, not CGI in any way. The BD also has a number of good extras. A good package, all in all.

But do NOT watch with dubbing! The English voices are ok but the original voices add so much more drama and reality to the proceedings (and I love subtitles like ""[whinnies]"" when the horses make a noise). I watched both dubbed and original and Chinese is absolutely the way to go here. Worlds of difference.

3695206,4,B001MAA6WO,"NOTE: The US version of the film cut over 15 minutes of footage from the original film.

General Pang Qing Yun is the sole survivor of his entire battalion. The Ching army was taken out against Taiping rebels in Hechuan. A woman named Lian spends the night with Pang and leaves before he wakes the next morning. Jiang Wuyang, one of the bandits that rides into the town Pang currently finds himself in, is impressed with Pang's fighting skills and introduces Pang to Zhao Er Hu. Jiang and Er Hu take Pang to their village where Pang is reunited with Lian who just so happens to be Er Hu's wife. The bandits from the village overthrow a passing food convoy and that is thought to be a resolution to their current desperation until the imperial army invades and usurps the food that they stole. Pang, Er Hu, and Jiang take a blood oath to become blood brothers before joining Lord Chen's army. With the odds against them, their 800 soldiers get the upper hand on Shu City's 5,000 as plans are put into motion to overthrow Suzhou and Nanjing, the capital. The brothers soon begin to fall apart on their rise to the top. Er Hu tends to be loyal with his word and his brothers no matter what as Pang will sacrifice anyone and even make deals with his enemies just to win while Jiang is stuck in the middle.

This movie is phenomenal. The battle sequences are stunning, the cinematography is brilliant, and the acting is top notch. The Warlords took everything that was fantastic about Mongol and made it just a little bit better. Jet Li deserves a mention. After seeing Unleashed and Fearless, it was nice to see him actually show his acting chops again. The desire to see him at that acting capacity was high, so it was quite a treat to see him at that caliber once again. After The Forbidden Kingdom and his rather stale performance in that, it's become a bit difficult what to expect from him other than him displaying how talented he is at martial arts. Fortunately, he did a great job in this as he showed just about every emotion in this film at some time or another. His fight scenes were also incredible, but that is kind of a given. Andy Lau also deserves a nod. His character is just so passionate about being honorable and loyal that when things go wrong, his reaction is just explosive. He has some really powerful scenes where he's fighting for what he thinks is right. There's a scene where a play is mocking him and his brothers while he's eating dinner. He begins to laugh, which leads to him crying uncontrollably, and then he begins laughing again. He just managed to pull it off flawlessly and it was incredibly impressive.

The battle scenes didn't pull any punches either. Blood flies across the screen as limbs roll on the ground. It's truly fantastic. They are the highlight of the film as the first half seems to not pull away from the battlefield. The film is also extremely colorful. Every scene is stunningly vibrant. There are so many memorable scenes from the film and half of that is due to how they were shot. There's a scene where Er Hu runs into a coliseum where there are just hundreds of dead bodies lying on the ground and the camera does a 360 degree motion around him capturing his emotions and the devastation that lies around him. It's amazing.

The Warlords is one of the best Chinese war epics I've ever seen. Not that I've seen too many of them, but even in comparison to feudal Japan films, it's one of the best. If you were a fan of films like Mongol: The Rise of Genghis Kahn, The Last Samurai, or Seven Samurai, then this comes highly recommended.

But, once again, just like with ""Iron Monkey"" and ""Suriyothai"" we get these ""American"" cut versions. WHICH SUCKS!!! I am a film school student and have studied films for over 20 years and I despise it when a foreign film is cut ""supposedly"" to our western liking. Who asked Magnolia to cut 13-14 minutes of the film anyway? Surely fans of foreign films did not ask for this. Read the dvdbeaver comparison to find out what is missing in the ""American"" cut. Magnolia, you dropped the ball on this one. I bought your versions of ""Haeundae"" (interestingly renamed ""Tidal Wave"". Haeundae does not mean Tidal Wave. It is the town in South Korea where the tsunami hits), ""Chocolate"", ""Ong Bak 2"", ""Let The Right One In"" (except for the subtitle complaints) and others and I am pleased with them. But, remember this, true film fans want the ""director's vision"" of a film, not the version that you ""think we would want""!!! I am importing the Region A Megastar version with no ""cuts"" to the film. MAGNOLIA PLEASE DO NOT MAKE ""CUTS"" TO THE SOUTH KOREAN FILM ""MOTHER"" THAT YOU ARE RELEASING ON BLU-RAY JULY 20TH. I saw ""Mother"" and it is amazing just the way it is. No need to cut ANYTHING from that film. Stay true to your fans and supporters and we will always buy your releases.",1277856000,90,1345,4.56198347107438
3695210,2,B001MAA6WO,"I saw The Warlords about a year ago before making the switch to Blu-Ray and liking the films grittiness and bloody battle scenes decided to hold off on purchasing the Blu-Ray after seeing the trailer on the movie for the disc of Red Cliff. Unfortunately unlike that movie I didn't learn about the cuts made, totally re-editing the film in some ways until popping the disc in my player this morning.
I was going to give the movie an honest try afterwards, but at times the edits border on incompetent, taking out emotional moments that work for the story's characters or even creating gaffes through scenes that were re-edited to different parts of the film. Add to that a new musical score that goes from acceptable to incessant at times and to me the movie just didn't work as well as the original Chinese cut. Thats not to say it might not work for those who haven't seen the original I suppose but with many companies offering both edited and un-edited versions of movies on DVD and Blu-Ray I can say this release is a disappointment to me on that fact alone.
If you decide to buy this version, the picture quality is good, the audio decent and the extras rather abundant. I just hope Magnolia with films I want to see like Centurion or Mother, doesn't make this a habit. I could understand the re-editing of Red Cliff. This one not so much.",1277769600,6,1344,4.512295081967213
3695211,4,B001MAA6WO,"THE WARLORDS (2007) is an ambitious film directed by Peter Chan, one of Hong Kong's known filmmakers. This film has a very impressive cast in Jet Li (Fearless), Andy Lau (Infernal Affairs) and Takeshi Kaneshiro (Returner). This period epic is loosely based on Chang Cheh's classic; BLOOD BROTHERS. I've seen a lot of Chinese epics and thankfully ""The Warlords"" is not a part of the colorful, overindulgent film geared towards U.S. audiences. Truly, this film is darker and grittier than most Chinese epics, but still has massive commercial appeal and will no doubt be popular to international audiences.

The Taiping Rebellion has plunged the country in chaos. General Quing-yun Pang (Jet Li) is the lone survivor of a massive battle between the Christian Taiping and the Qing dynasty under command. That evening, he finds comfort in the arms of comely Lian (Xu Jinglei) but she disappears the following day. Pang encounters a group of bandits led by Er-hu Zhao (Andy Lau) and Jiang (Kaneshiro) who are having difficulty in survival. As fate would have it, the three takes a blood oath to join the Qing army to quell the rebellion.

The Taiping rebellion is among the bloodiest civil war ever recorded in history. The body count rivals the ones during World War II. The Taiping rebellion has a lot to do with religion and cultural ideology, and those powerful issues have been downplayed in favor of the theme of brotherhood, love and war. The film fails to take advantage of its historical context. Quite disappointing really, apparently, the producers presume that the usual theme of brotherhood and loyalty are more universal and more appealing to international audiences. I looked up the details of the Taiping rebellion, and I have to say, even though ""The Warlords"" is in no means a bad film, it's full potential hasn't been achieved. Rather, the rebellion is only used as a backdrop and not really the film's main premise.

As for the battle scenes, it may well be the bloodiest I've seen so far in Hong Kong cinema. Limbs are severed and there are a few gruesome beheadings. The sequences still have the martial arts influence, but no hints of wires are shown. U.S. audiences may need hints of Chinese history to be able to fully grasp the proceedings, there's a lot of commentary to China's tumultuous past and there is some effective human drama in the brothers' contrasting ideas regarding war and righteousness. Pang is a realist while Er-hu is an idealist, I'm pretty certain you have an idea how two opposing ideologies cannot coexist. Sadly, the missing cultural impact of the war minimizes the film's depth, making the horrors of war less involving.

Jet Li gives the performance of his career since ""Fearless"". The man can indeed act, and now I understand why he wants to leave the shadow of Wu Shu. There is quite a lot of ""manly"" tear-jerking moments, and the existing love triangle between Pang, Er-hu and Lian seems to be minor plot devices in an attempt to relate to its audiences. The film is successful as a costume epic, and definitely has a lot of ambition. The style feels a little bit like a Hollywood production; expensive, huge and indeed loud. There are some emotional complexities inherent in its characters and conflicts but it becomes a little too predictable. The film is indeed large but somewhat hampered by its commercialism. Big name Asian stars, expensive production values (I heard that it surpassed ""Curse of the Golden Flower"" in dollar expense), drama and a China-friendly aversion to sensitive themes.

Now, this doesn't mean that ""The Warlords"" is a bad film, it is actually a VERY good one. The elaborate costumes, decent battle sequences, awesome set designs and the excellent performance by my boy; Jet Li does make the film a real note-worthy experience. It is just both a success and a victim of its own commercialism. For the most part, Peter Chan and company knew what they wanted to do with this film; a film that can please almost everyone (except maybe those who love happy endings) and has mass mainstream appeal for both Chinese and international audiences. The film's historical trappings feel more like a setting rather than a sense of history. Still, a lot of viewers will not be disappointed, the film is not subtle in execution, the melodramatic battlefields and the great performances by its actors are sure to please many. It may be a bit hollow in spirit but definitely solid and safe in the power it exudes.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! [4 stars]
NOTE: The U.S. release (region 1) of ""The Warlords"" has lost more than 15 minutes of original footage when compared to the Hong Kong release. It loses a lot of its emotions and dramatic impact. If you have multi-region capability, get the uncut Asian release.",1276560000,55,4765,4.869297163995068
3695212,5,B001MAA6WO,"Jet Li as a villain is quite a remarkable piece of casting, and everyone really holds their own in this action epic set in 1860s China. The title in English is Warlords but in Chinese it was Blood Brothers, and features three men who are doing their best to survive in a wartorn land.
Jet Li, a great general in the Imperial army, is betrayed and the only man in his army to survive. His resurrection from the dead is both fascinating and appalling to watch as his desire for power obliterates all before him. Andy Lau gives the performance of a lifetime as the head of a band of brigands, who first follows Jet Li but later becomes disaffected by what he sees and tries to turn back from the collision course the ambitious general has set them all on.
Takeshi Kaneshiro as the youngest of the three strong male leads is remarkable in terms of both his battle prowess and how loyal he is to both men, until he is forced to choose sides. Complicating matters still further is the fact that Li's character unintentionally fell in love with a woman on the road, who turns out to be the wife of Lau's character. The inevitable ending is anything but as each man meets his fate.
The action and battle sequences, music, costume, and above all, the depiction of warfare at the time, including trench warfare, makes this an Asian All Quiet on the Western Front, where there is no glory for anyone, only more bloodshed for the sake of ruthless territorial ambitions.  I have watched it several times now, with a variety of friends, and everyone LOVED it, even as they were completely shocked by it. If you like action films, there is plenty to recommend Warlords, but the sheer depth of this epic is remarkable.  This is a GREAT film in the true sense of the word.",1274486400,52,1755,4.464174454828661
3695213,5,B001MAA6WO,"While I haven't seen this version yet, I own the two disc Chinese version which was released several months ago. As my version is a two disc limited edition set, there's more to the movie than what is in this version (I'm assuming). For those who seen the theatrical and international versions of Red Cliff will know what I'm talking about. The two disc version is from China so it'll only play on Region specific dvd players. If you have a region free dvd player then I highly recommend getting the ""Chinese"" version as it has numerous scenes and tid bits that I'm sure are missing from this version.",1273536000,10,601,4.522935779816514

There is a lot of action in the movie, but most of it is storyline and dialogue. All of the actors deliver a stellar performance, and the message of the film is strong. I would like to leave one star off because I don't believe it is completely historically accurate, but decided against that because the film was so compelling.",1272153600,,505,4.56043956043956
