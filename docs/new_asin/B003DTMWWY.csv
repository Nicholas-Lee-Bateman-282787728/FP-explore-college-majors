8394923,5,B003DTMWWY,"I want to commend Mike Carroll on his wonderful debut dramatic film ""Year"" I've screened the film over the past week twice and I must say it is a rich and complex work.  I've watched and enjoyed Mr. Carroll's second film, ""Nightbeats"", before watching this, his first one, and I expected to see ""Year"" as more the work of a fledgling director. I was wrong. Both ""Year"" and ""Nightbeats"" are mature works from a mature director. Reminds me of a few other directors who have hit the deck running: Orson Welles, Spielberg, and Steven Soderbergh.

The script is tightly structured, the characters are well-drawn and acted, the cinematography is gorgeous, (particularly the cityscapes and time-lapse sequences of clouds), relating to the interior lives of the characters while moving us through time. I was simply amazed when while watching the bonus featurette on the DVD, (which I highly recommend), I learned that most of the filming of characters was accomplished with available lighting. And far from looking like a home movie, the film looks, well, very sensitively lit. So here you have a single person, directing, shooting, collecting sound, and still able to pull from the ""available light"", quality and mood. Amazing work. When I think of what Mr Carroll could accomplish with a crew and a couple of million dollars....on the other hand, I hope he continues to be a filmmaker in the fullest sense of the word - I mean in the sense that HE interprets the meaning of that word.

I was moved by the acting of this wonderful cast. They come from the theater we learn in the book, ""Naked Filmmaking"", and in the featurette previously mentioned. What I find remarkable is how they were able to adjust from the stage to the ""close-up""...from projecting their characters to revealing their souls through a subtle look or gesture. Bonnie Bennett and David Harris were particularly strong. As was the character who played the older friend and confidant of Bonnie's character, sorry, I forgot his name!). His performance, to me, was particularly fine.

I think this must have been an amazing experience, check that, quest, to have been a part of. During the featurette, there's a number of shots of Mr. Carroll directing the cast in the New Year's Eve scenes. Everyone looks so focused, tuned in, and inspired. I'm sure they knew they were a part of something very special. Call it the democratization of feature film making if you want but they were there body and soul. Not for the big bucks or for the fame, although I hope that happens for this fine ensemble of artists. They were there giving their best - normal, but talented people. And there was Mike Carroll, calm, smiling, directing his film, and in his element.",1354406400,,2715,4.832258064516129
8394924,4,B003DTMWWY,"I am a fan of Mike Carroll films. A true student of Cassavetes, his style is one that allows his actors lots of freedom to explore and to instinctively play off of a situation, which oftentimes leads to moments of real truth. He is one of the few that has the courage to do this kind of film-making, because he is so well-versed in the ""laws"" OF film-making. Year is a perfect example of the free-form sub-genre that is so constantly attempted by filmmakers. Only Mike pulls it off, whereas other lesser filmmakers don't because they lose focus on the story's through-line. Relationships are real in Year and several characters (like Bonnie Bennett and Erik Wheeler) breath authenticity into moments that more times than not would have been handled amateurishly. If you want a film with about real familial relationships in multiple levels of disrepair, Year is for you. The whole cast is solid, and Mike's cinematography is, as usual, priceless. If you also want a lesson in do- it-yourself-film-making, then there's yet another reason to buy YEAR.",1272672000,,1049,4.898876404494382
