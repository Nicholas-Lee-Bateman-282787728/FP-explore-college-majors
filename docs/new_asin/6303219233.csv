596366,4,6303219233,"I read the book before I saw the movie, and even so I wasn't disappointed. The movie told a good section of the story and stayed as true as possible to the book. I just wish that they had been able to do more of the book. I had two minor problems with it, though: Some of the footage (like the fall of the Alamo) looked like it might have been borrowed from an old western. Also, during the battle right before Otto and Yancey captured Santa Anna, I don't understand why they had Sam Houston galloping around the edges of the battle in slow motion, hardly fighting at all, looking like an early-nineteenth-century Captain America. I don't think that served any real purpose. Other than that, I liked it.",1044316800,4,703,4.415384615384616
596367,5,6303219233,"Its hard to believe nobodys written a review of this movie at amazon! I really enjoy reading the customer reviews and how people,s opinions differ so much, but I never thought that I would ever write one but this movie  deserves a good review. Let me start by saying this is a long movie (over 3  hrs.) at amazon it states its on one vhs cassete, but the copy of the movie  I recieved was on two, recorded in sp mode with superb sound and video as  good as any vhs movie. This movie is about how the USA battled and won  Texas from Mexico a truly remarkable piece of American history, in this  movie the acting is terrific, its the kind of movie that keeps your eyes  glued to the screen, this is a must for viewers who like movies with lots  of battle scenes, and I think others will enjoy the movie as well. Well I  hope to many people don't laugh at my only review but after viewing this  movie and due to the fact  that no one else had written a review, I felt  the need to let people know this is a great movie in fact it is one of my  favorates. My final words BUY IT!  you won't regret it.  PS: Anybody that  has seen this movie please write a review , I would love to read your  opinions of this movie.",943747200,38,1210,4.016806722689076

596429,5,6303219233,"Michner presented a more realistic portrayal of the origin of Texas.
Alamo was not romanticised.  Disapppointed the film did not dwell
on the Irish immigration.  They hated the English and served with
Santa Anna at the battle of the Alamo.  Austin was portrayed as
frustrated with the Anglos that refused to understand they swore
allegiance to Mexico when they accepted the land.  Actually,
the Irish immigrants were loyal to Mexico.  They considered the
yankees English and wanted no part of them.",1395705600,,498,5.098765432098766

596432,2,6303219233,"The only thing that made this film worthwhile is Rick Schroder's nude skinnydipping scene. He undresses in front of the lake, revealing his impressive ass, and then another great ass shot as he surfaces, the water running over his round, wholesome cheeks. This is the only reason I gave the film 2 stars, other than that it's a boring waste of time. You're better off reading James Michner's book.",1339891200,,397,4.768115942028985
596433,3,6303219233,"I can't believe Michener would ok this project if it was supposed to be the film adaptation of his book ""Texas"" which was excellent.

596434,4,6303219233,"I'm surprised this movie has been re-run so few times on TV.  I watched it on TV not long ago and liked it so well I ordered the VHS so I could watch it again.  It tells the story of how Texas was colonized by Americans at the invitation of the Mexican government and how Texas subsequently broke away, becoming first an independent republic and then a state.  The characters--both actual historical figures and the fictional ones whose stories are told against a real historical background--give a sense of realism to this sweeping historical tale.  I especially liked Chelsea Field and Benjamin Bratt and the fictional characters they played.  Both gave excellent performances.  The narration by Charleton Heston is memorable as well.",1324252800,,736,4.991803278688525

596509,4,6303219233,"Mitchener tends to do an historical rewrite in these sweeping novels.
The ideas is to make a story connecting the history to the individuals involved. He really isn't as successful as this in many cases.
This mini-series is relatively well scripted, costumed and acted.
I liked it because it gave a ""feel"" for the historical Texas that is missing in many westerns.",1242000000,,364,4.887096774193548
596510,3,6303219233,"While this book had some good story telling, the characters were not very well defined.  Towards the end, it seemed he was just writing the story to get it over w/& to include as much history as he could in one place.  Didn't seem very historically accurate.  I also watched the movie of the same name/author & it was absolutely terrible.",1241740800,,338,4.508196721311475
596511,4,6303219233,"I agree with everybody that has posted reviews about this movie, but the ones that have only 1 or 2 stars. In the style of Gone With the Wind, the novel shows how families were at first united, then separated during the conflict. I am familiar with the historical facts and that is why I could follow the locations and time, but someone who has not read the book or know little about the true facts would be a little lost. I was lucky to get this movie on DVD. The sound and the colors are great, the photography is very good, the landscapes and the sets believable, picture is sharp except for the stolen parts from an earlier movie. I am giving the movie 4 stars because of the battle scenes (the ones made for this movie), even considering it was a made for TV movie, they could have been choreographed an filmed better. In overall for a low budget TV movie, it was very good. I think it wouldn't be a bad idea to rebroadcast it, specially now that the DVD has became a scarce item. I will keep it in my library of history documentaries and movies.",1192233600,5,1051,4.26
596512,2,6303219233,"The Texas Revolution of 1835 to 1836, including the periods preceding and immediately following, are depicted in this 3-hour TV movie whose only redeeming value is shedding light and paying homage to Stephen Austin, the ""Father of Texas"" whose story and contribution to an Anglo-dominated Texas has been overshadowed by the legendary Sam Houston.  The rest of the film is the usual ""Santa Anna is a tyrant"" storyline with short low-budget battle scenes and a weak attempt to show the Mexican perspective via a fictional Hispanic character displaying stereotypical Latin machismo.  Anyone who knows Texan history will realize that the Anglo settlers/rebels did not fight just for basic civil liberties like habeas corpus but also for the right to own black slaves, something which ""tyrannical"" Mexico had abolished but which persisted in the ""land of the free"" USA. Politics aside, this movie is really talky, boring and showing very little of the Alamo defenders like Crockett, Bowie and Travis.  It is recommended only for real history buffs interested in Austin and Houston and who do not come from Mexico.  Everyone else should watch John Wayne's ""Alamo"", which at least has the decency to commend the bravery of Mexican soldiers acting as a tyrant's cannon fodder.",1162166400,2,1268,5.170731707317073
596513,5,6303219233,"We are original orginal of this video and have watched it on tv once an then this set.

It is one of the best movies we havd seen on the Alamo and the start of Texas as a independant State.

Charle Heston really done a great job in his naration.

It is a solid 3 hr movie with lots of action, love story and other things that make it great.

I highly recommend seeing it, you will not forget it.",1138665600,2,395,3.9
596514,1,6303219233,"While I wouldn't be able to speak to Michener's original work, not having read it, I am nevertheless willing to say that the movie adaptation is the worst kind of media.  While purporting to tell the history of Texas, it manages to tell only the story of a few wealthy white men.  In the entire movie, there are only four women characters, only two of which have more than one line.  In all four cases, their sole goal appears to be the subsumation of their selves in their husbands.

  As for the ""thirty thousand Indians... mostly Cherokee"" that Heston's narration mentions at the beginning, that is more or less all the attention they receive in the film.  They are depicted once as raiding wagon train and once you see their aftermath on a homestead they've despoiled.  Other than that, the movie treats Texas as if it were totally empty when the whites arrived to ""civilize"" it.  And of African Americans, literally not one word or character.  More than odd, considering that Texas was always going to enter into the Union as a slave state, and that the extension of the slave trade to their farms was one of the major boons of annexation for Texas.  Lastly, Benjamin Bratt's character is made to deliver overtly racist lines directly aimed at the denigration of the Mexican character and spirit.  He does nothing good for race relations, and indeed says things like ""Mexicanos and Tejanos can never live together, they shouldn't have tried.""  Such lines are disrespectful in light of the fact that racism against Latinos is still endemic in Texas.  The fact that this remains true is largely the result of depictions like this one, that only further racist views and stereotypes.

  All in all, and as a white male whose family has been in Texas since the beginning of the state, I thought this movie made a mockery of my heritage.  Simply leaving out the truth of our history to focus on ""good, honest pioneering"" is to tell far less than half the story.",1130371200,8,1961,4.667638483965015
596515,1,6303219233,"I am no expert on the history of Texas but as a standalone movie, this is laughable.  Borrowed clips from old westerns (the battle of the Alamo being the worst offender), cheesy attempts at drama that go overboard (Houston being shot off his horse three times all in slow-mo only to dismount and stumble on the ground immediatly after being put back on horseback), and the predictability of some scenes made this movie feel more like a comedy than historical documentary.  If you are looking for a history of Texas, something better must exist somewhere.  As others have said this condenses alot into way too little and the end result holds little entertainment value as any sort of drama from my point of view.  The only redeemable quality is that it (presumably) provides a basic understanding on the birth of Texas but a strait documentary would probably have been able to convey a more in-depth story in the same amount of time.

Bottom line: while the historical content appears to be of merit, the absurd presentation is too distracting to make it really worth your time.",1119398400,2,1077,4.768817204301075
596516,3,6303219233,"This movie version is so inferior.  Michener is a genius and justice was not done to him with this movie.

596517,3,6303219233,"James A. Michener's Texas is a quality TV miniseries that tells the story of how Texas became a state. The movie condenses almost 30 years of history into about 3 hours which is one of its bad points. Narrated by Charlton Heston, the miniseries shows Stephen Austin's colonization of Texas, cries for war, the Alamo, the Battle at San Jacinto, and the struggle to help the Republic of Texas survive all while following the story of several fictional characters.
 The cast for the movie is really very good. It stars Benjamin Bratt, Rick Schroeder, Patrick Duffy, Chelsea Field, Randy Travis, Anthony Michael Hall, Stacey Keach, John Schneider, David Keith and many other notable faces. Bratt is very good as Benito Garza as is Schroeder as Otto MacNab, a young Texas Ranger. Overall, the movie is pretty good, but everything seems a little rushed. For one, the footage from the Alamo attack is from The Last Command made in the 1950's which looks very out of place. Also, San Jacinto is done almost all in slow motion which just doesn't work. Still a good movie though if you're looking for a basic history of Texas.",1051660800,26,1116,4.752577319587629
