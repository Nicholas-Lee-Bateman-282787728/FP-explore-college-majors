8482442,5,B001F2W5AK,"This DVD is very well done.  Being an expert in primitive skills as well as a professional videographer, the quality is excellent both in production and showcasing Tony's skill.  This video shows the entire process, from collecting clay, to processing it in a mano and metate as was done for thousands of years.  Then Tony wets and prepares the clay and begins building the pot.  Tony's mastery in replicating ancient pottery without a potters wheel is obvious in this video...as he brings the walls up they are extremely fragile and flexible.  You'd think the pot would collapse under its own weight, but Tony continues to add more clay as he builds the walls upward and finally inward to create the neck.  It's like watching a tightrope walker with no net...incredible.  After drying Tony paints the pot and fires it in a large campfire that encircles the pot, carefully warming it up before covering it with wood from the Joshua trees to final fire it.  Anyone who enjoys Native crafts or wants to learn how the Indians of the Soutwest made pottery need look no further.  I've watched this video numerous times and still enjoy it.  Fantastic video!!",1467072000,,1152,4.802030456852792
