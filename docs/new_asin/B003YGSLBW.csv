8409246,2,B003YGSLBW,"Just a marketing item for Jet Li.  If you're a fan, ah.  If you're looking for a beginning film try ""Fist of Legend"", ""The Tai Chi Master"", or ""The Legend"", or ""Hero"".",1405814400,2,167,4.1875
8409247,5,B003YGSLBW,"Great action, great fight scenes, skillful actors.  The plots tend to always be the same (avenging a murdered master, rescuing a kidnapped girl, challenging a drug lord, etc.).  But I watch them for the great choreographed fight scenes.",1402185600,2,236,5.184210526315789
8409248,5,B003YGSLBW,There are posers and then there are the real deal. Jet Li is the real deal. I have been a fan of Jet Li for years. He is one of the most important action stars in the world. This series is where it all started.,1341532800,,210,3.688888888888889
8409249,3,B003YGSLBW,"I took one look at the DVD cover with the picture of Jet Li on it and then looked at the price and I was hooked on buying it. I should have read the descriptions of the product first. There are 4 films on one disk, 1 is about the various shaolin styles, and there are a lot of them. The monkey and drunken styles are just plain silly, the rest are ok. If you are planning on becoming a martial arts master this one might interest you. The documentary on the life of Jet Li growing up did not interest me. The other two films Shaolin Temple 1 and 2 were 1980 films and they showed their age. Real old films. I would pass on this one. But, for the real kung Fu fans you can't go wrong on the price.",1339372800,2,696,3.908450704225352
8409250,3,B003YGSLBW,"I thought this was a movie by Jet li...No ! its not.  Although it covers lots of styles of Kung Fu in China, it was not what I was looking for.  I gave it three stars because the contents wasn't bad.",1325462400,3,199,3.8292682926829267
8409251,5,B003YGSLBW,i am a jet li fan i needed to add this dvd movie to my martial arts dvd movie that i really love to watch,1298851200,3,105,3.24
