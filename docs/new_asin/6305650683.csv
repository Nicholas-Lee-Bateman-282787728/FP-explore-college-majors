1059590,4,6305650683,"for using this tape.  Gloria Quinlan's instruction is sometimes confusing.  I had to do the tape quite a few times before I got the routine down.  Once you know the steps, however, it really is a fun tape to do.  If you have patience and can suppress the desire to fling the tape out of a window, you'll do fine.",988502400,,312,4.15
1059591,5,6305650683,"This video is fun, easy to learn and a nice workout for those who are looking for fat-burning. I use this video at least three times a week and on the other four days, I miss it. I get up ready to dance and I feel good all day long. I have had it for a month and always enjoy the routine.",974592000,,288,3.661290322580645
1059592,4,6305650683,"When I am stressed or want to add variety to my workouts, I do this tape.  It's fun, spunky, and a change from the norm. Gloria is friendly, sincere, and an encouraging instructor.  Sure, the chatter is loud and the transitions are a little choppy, but the class is energetic and similar to a live class.  When I want ""serious"" exercise, I simply use The Firm (they actually use words like gastrocnemius [calf muscle] and ""lie supine"" with straight faces.)  I think it's good to have videos that you use for the pure fun of it.  As far as the ""un-Latin"" comments, I think Crunch's intent was to useLatin inspiration in traditional aerobics moves.  I recommend his video to anyone who wants to spice up their workout and have a some fun.  I think it is a good value for the price, and well worth a try.",970099200,2,801,4.408163265306122
1059593,4,6305650683,"Having read the other reviews of this video I find that others have  approached the video with two expectations that have left them  disappointed.  First, some expect this is really going to be a strenuous  workout because of the words ""crunch"" and ""fat  blaster"".  Secondly, some expect this workout to be the equivilant of  a latin dance class.  Anyone approaching this video with either notion  would be disappointed.  However, I am a computer potato who has just  recently returned to working out and I find this video both great fun and a  great workout.  It is a lot of fun to do in the morning to really get going  or after work as stress relief. I think that Gloria does a fantasic job  teaching combinations of low-impact aerobic moves that do have a latin  flavor.  I appreciate that there is not a lot of instructional chatter, the  mood is very upbeat, the workout is challenging without being impossible,  and the video participants really seem to be enjoying themselves.  This  video would be best appreciated by an aerobics beginner - if you already do  two hours a day of high-impact aerobics or hold a latin dance trophy this  video is not for you.",966470400,14,1165,4.658415841584159
1059594,1,6305650683,"As a fan of latino music and dance, as well as a busy person looking for good cardio videos, I was disappointed on both counts.  While the instructor is quite likeable and it was nice to see a variety of body  shapes among the class participants, the negatives outweigh these  positives.  One, the music is simply AWFUL!  The music on the Kathy Smith  Latin video is much better (and at least authentic latin).  Two, the  changes could have been cued better (instead of ""pay attention to the  changes"" - tell us what the changes are!).  Three,  I had to really  throw myself into the choreography, and even then I only broke a very light  sweat towards the end of the video (while the Kathy Smith Latin workout is  also rather ""lite"", I work up a much better sweat because I throw  myself into the steps and add my moves of my own).  Four, there is very  little actual dancing in this video, and often the movements are not  well-synchronized to the music. At least on the Kathy Smith video I can  easily fall back into the class' movements because everyone is on the beat.  The one additional plus is that it's a ""short"" workout, but it  doesn't even feel like a very good workout.  This one gets shoved into a  box and put in the garage.",962064000,4,1239,4.384955752212389
1059595,3,6305650683,"I love a good workout and am an avid fan of Latin music anddancing, so I couldn't wait to try this video when I brought it home. What a disappointment!  About the only thing with a Latin flair was the instructor!
The workout is not aerobically challenging for anyone except maybe a beginner, I found the choreography too basic, and I was most let down to find that the music doesn't even sound Latin.  I'm not even sure how they were allowed to promote this as a ""Fat Blaster"" workout either.
On a more positive note, the instructor is very motivating and easy to like, and as one other reviewer noted, it was nice to see the range of body types.  All the Crunch videos give you the feel of being in a real class.  As well, it's a short workout if you don't have much time.  Unfortunately, the positives are not enough to make up for the negatives.
If you're TRULY looking for a Latin workout, try Kathy Smith's Latin Workout. It isn't the toughest workout either, but the music's better and the choreography is much more like Latin dancing.  END",953164800,24,1046,4.421875
1059596,4,6305650683,"I had to write this review, because as an instructor myself, I did the tape from a different perspective from most people.  The workout is so true to Gloria's style, which is fun, energetic and full of nice surprises in  the movement.  Gloria has such a passion for what she does and it comes  through in this tape.  Her back-up people were all wonderful and  enthusiastic and I loved that they were a nice representation of different  body types.  You won't feel intimidated by this workout.  Be patient with  yourself learning the movement, it will be worth it!  Great job Gloria!  As  a bonus, Dragonfly Productions, Inc. produced this video, so you know it is  a quality product.",952560000,3,683,4.677966101694915
1059597,4,6305650683,"It took watching the tape three times to learn the moves, but it was fun learning!  They're not difficult, but the pace is fast.  The music is energetic, and the dance moves are great!  You can really get into the  rhythm and get your heart pumping.  If you have the patience to learn the  moves, you should have fun with this tape.  The 30 minutes goes by fast!",943142400,17,362,4.235294117647059
1059705,2,6305650683,"Starting with the pros.  I love Crunch videos, the teachers are usually great, and entertaining.  They are encouraging with out being wierd.  I feel the same about this video, Gloria Quinlan was very engaging.  However I am no latina dancing mama, and you need to be to keep up with her.
All the women on the tape were amazing, they were bustin' moves this little white girl shreeks at the idea of.  If you are a dancer, than I'm sure you will enjoy this tape.  If you are not, you will enjoy watching them run circles around you!
I am in shape and enjoy working out, but this one was not for me.",1067385600,,596,4.230088495575221
1059706,1,6305650683,"I wanted a 30 minute workout to combine with my 55 minute workouts I do three times a week, so I bought this tape.  I thought this would do it.  NO WAY!!!!  I didn't break a sweat.  The instuctor doesn't explain the moves at all.  The moves are to fancy... to fast... and you have to concentrate extremely hard to even keep up. There are so many moves I couldn't keep up. The music was nice but the people in the video are annoying. Don't waste your money on this tape.",1062547200,,469,4.1098901098901095
1059707,5,6305650683,"I love this workout video. I have had it for over a year and I do it a couple times a week and I am not at all bored with it.  Yes, you do have to run through the tape 5 or 6 times before you really get the ""hang of it"". The first time I did this routine I was completely lost. But if you stick with it you'll be amazed at how well you pick up the moves. And this is from someone with no dance background who had a hard time learning the electric slide! It just takes time and patience (and the rewind button). Once you know it you can vary the moves and intensity. I also love the upbeat attitude of the dancers and the instructors. I can see how some people might find it annoying but for me at 7 in the morning I need a lot of motivation and enthusiasm. I hate the videos where everyone looks like they are bored, it makes me want to crawl back into bed. I have tried a lot of different workout/dance videos and this is the absolute best I have come across yet. It provides a good cardio workout but not to the point of being completely exhausting. This video is perfect if you are trying to get back into shape or just starting because its not so hard that you get discouraged cause you can't finish and it is difficult enough to burn some serious calories. If I could I would give it 6 stars!",1051488000,,1297,3.9884615384615385
1059708,1,6305650683,"On the description on the back of the box it states that it is good for all levels.  Very untrue. This video was very difficult to keep up with. I felt that the instructor did not give good direction or illustration.  It would have been nice if she demonstrated a move before she actually did it.
Plus, I thought that the camera angle's were not appropriate. Meaning, that when she was doing a new step the camera was focused on her face. You didn't actually SEE the new step until the 2nd or 3rd time she did it.
I am very sorry I bought this one. I guess you win some an you lose some. I only wish I had read the reviews before purchasing this so called exercise video.",1042416000,,671,4.153846153846154
1059709,1,6305650683,"I bought the video today, and it was like throwing my ($)down the drain,
I'm sorry to say!
I was led to believe (by the cover's description) that there would be MUSIC
and that it would be FUN.
Well, I couldn't even stand to watch the whole video, because the so-called
music wasn't music at all. It was just a nondescript Latin beat - no
discernable melody at all...and believe me, I know and LOVE Latin music and
have for over 40 years!  I speak Spanish and absolutely adore Hispanic culture and especially the music.
This video had a lady who talked (screamed is more like it!) NON-STOP. It
was beyond annoying! I even found myself screaming back at her to please shut up. I
fast-forwarded all the way through...stopping every few minutes to see if it
would improve...if she would stop her shrieking and actually play some hot,
happy, exciting MUSIC and just let us finally do the moves with her in
peace. But NOOOOOOOO...!! She never did.  It was this constant
''fakey-encouraging'' drivel :  ''That's right!''  ''Great!''  ''You did it!'' ''Wow!'' And all in a high-pitched, piercing, relentlessly loud voice. And no REAL music!  Just a lame, synthesized EXCUSE for music, which was really nothing but a beat,...which the girl managed to over-power with her constant chatter. And the girls in the group did some ''woo! woo!'' in the background, to try to make it seem as if they, at least, were enjoying it. But that simply came off as trying too hard to convince us. If only it HAD been fun and had made you want to dance, like the cover said it would! (Sigh!) But alas, it did not.",1030233600,2,1587,4.590106007067138
1059710,2,6305650683,If you have never taken a Latin Dance class this video is not for you I guess the instructer is under the usumption that you know what you were doing I did not even finish the video I was so confused and fustrated. Save your money this video is not worth it.,1030147200,2,258,3.980769230769231
1059711,2,6305650683,"I was very excited when i brought this video home but was a bit disappointed by it. first of all, watch this video 2 or 3 times before you try it because the instructor goes really fast and if you blink you miss a move- well you miss most of the moves anyway even if you don't blink!! the only challenge in the video was keeping up with the instructor who does not even take the time to explain every move; she just goes on and on as if she expects you to know all the moves already. the workout does however work up a sweat! i felt like i was going through my first ever latino dance experience where no one bothered to show me how to make the moves!",1026172800,2,651,3.9770992366412212
1059712,5,6305650683,"I was looking for a tough work out, and was kind of disappointed the first time I did this video because I didn't feel like I worked that hard. The next time I did the video, I realized that was because I did catch all the steps the first time. By the third viewing, once I got the ""flavor"", as Gloria calls it, I was huffing and puffing and having a fabulous time! The moves are SO much fun. I love Gloria. It doesn't hurt that I liked dancing and salsa-type moves before hand... But the best part, though? The whole tape is low impact - I get a great work out (for around 30 minutes) AND it's great on my knees!",1014940800,,613,4.032786885245901
1059713,5,6305650683,"This is a great workout.  The instructor really gets you pumped up.  When she goes to fast to understand, since so far I've only done this twice, I just walk fast in place, and pick it back up.  It's alot of fun, you get a nice pace going, and 30 minutes is up in no time.  I would recommend this tape to anyone looking for a change of pace from standard aerobic tapes.",999561600,,369,4.013698630136986
1059714,4,6305650683,"I do this workout 4 times a week. It is great if you just have 30 minutes to burn some fat or a great warm up before an intense weight training set. Gloria Quinlan is adorable, has a pleasant voice to listen to and moves very naturally. This workout is a mix of basic latin dance steps and your basic aerobic moves (v-step). It's also what you make it, intensity can drive the workout. I also use Kathy Smith's latin workout and will sometimes do Kathy's right after Gloria's. There is no comparison, one is an apple the other is an orange. Kathy's tape has great content and is based more on the latin dance steps with lots of variations such as pivots and cross steps. Kathy's video has a much faster pace. Kathy does not seem to be quite as natural with latin moves and is painful to watch. I have to follow the female dancer next to Kathy.  I would probably like to see Gloria leading Kathy's video.",998870400,5,903,4.311764705882353
7892976,2,6305650683,Did not like this at all. Found myself laughing at it and it went to GoodWill. Hopefully someone else enjoyed it more than I.,1385942400,,125,4.25
7892977,4,6305650683,"I bought this video new in 1999 & I still workout to it every couple years for about 2 weeks until I move on to another of my many workout dvds.  (This is the only workout video I kept: all my others I gave away when I got the dvd versions. Since there's no dvd for this one, I've kept the videotape).  It's a good low-impact cardio aerobic workout with some easy to follow basic mambo, samba & meringue moves.  It's only 30 minutes, but you'll get your heart rate up & feel you've done a little workout in your legs, hips, arms.  I like her upbeat good mood enthusiasm.  I wish she were working out by herself (as the other people working out are distractions) but it's still good. I recommend this classic workout video for the beginners who want to raise the heart-rate, get toned but are dance-step challenged.",1332460800,,814,4.364238410596027
7892978,1,6305650683,"I've done a *lot* of workout videos, and I can easily say this is in the bottom two. The instructor isn't good at instructing, and although the routine is essentially easy, I had a hard time following along because she was so unclear at what she wanted. She also says ""pay attention"" or ""please pay attention"" at least 20 times (really) and a handful of times she says it really sternly. Um, I didn't see anyone behind her messing up at all--why the constant reprimands? Not very inspiring. Also, the women working out with her are awfully annoying. I know that, especially in Crunch videos, the background people are terribly enthusiastic, but these were screeching and hollering from the very beginning and throughout, even when we're doing such exciting things as stepping back and forth.

Don't buy this. I implore you.",1189209600,,823,4.836879432624113
7892979,3,6305650683,"I've been using dance dvds for 3 years now & own many as well as hated many. I love Gloria, I have her other DVDs, this seems to be her first.
She does tend to talk loud, she must have the music up where she teaches, but her cuing is awesome! She explains so well... Ok, now step touch to your right, take the left leg, bring it up, put it down &.... you got it! lets go...  ok, now pay attention here, the toes go up...."" She doesn't miss a thing. She's not the most fluid dancer, but she's naturally better then any Kathy Smith or Denise Austin or any other aerobic wannabes.
The dancers in the back are only average compared to the average person, so make sure you keep your eyes on Gloria or the African American woman or you'll learn bad form.
This video is a great start. Great mambos & merenges, a lot of step touches for breaks, etc. I only skimmed this from a library rental. I'd keep it, but I have more complex dance dvds with real music, not this fake synthesizer music that most dvds use.
I can't understand how anyone would find this video too fast or complex. Remember people, this is DANCE, getting it the first time is RARE. No one expects to be Michael Jordan on the basketball court their first time, so why should you expect to do the moves perfect the first time either?",1183939200,,1291,4.22672064777328
7892980,2,6305650683,"I like the dance moves in this video, however the people in the class are EXTREMELY IRRITATING! It really detracts from my ability to fully enjoy the class itself. I'd put the tv on mute, however I need to hear the dance instructions.

The moves in this video are not really that challenging, but it may take you a couple of times of doing the tape to get the hang of them. Gloria's cues are pretty on target, if you pay attention. You do side steps, low kicks, knee ups, triple steps, a Meringue, V-steps, box steps, Cha Cha's, some Salsa moves and a few other Latin dance moves whose names escape me at the moment. All of these moves are of course accompanied by various arm movements.

Gloria is a good instructor and isn't one to grate on the nerves, unlike the people in her class. I'm all for having high energy and being into what you're doing, but these girls take it to the extreme. They are constantly hooting and hollering and making noise overall. It's very annoying, which is partly why I do this video very rarely. Also, it doesn't seem to get my heart rate up that much, so it's not what I would consider a great cardio workout. But, it's decent in a pinch, if I don't feel like exerting myself too terribly and just want to get in some form of exercise for the day.",1142380800,2,1281,4.3112033195020745
7892981,2,6305650683,"The reviews are really all over the place on this one.  I am amazed at all the reviews that say this video is too difficult to follow.  I found the moves to be very basic and did not work up too much of a sweat.  It felt like it lasted about 15 minutes.  However, I couldn't get past all of the women whooping and hollering through the entire video.  I have dozens of videos including several latin ones and have never experienced that.  It distracted me so much I could hardly concentrate on the instructor.  If I heard, ""Whoo, Whoo.  Oh yeah,"" one more time I was going to throw something at the TV.  They acted like Cheerleaders at a junior high dance.  I would never be able to show my face in public again if I was one of these dancers. This was so annoying that I don't know if I'll be able to do this video again, even though I thought the instructor did a good job and the choreography was interesting if not a challenging enough workout.",1122768000,,946,4.205555555555556
7892982,4,6305650683,"I'm surprised about the negative reviews of this video. I'm glad I decided to try this workout anyway. I've done a lot of videos and it's hard to find a video that doesn't bore me, let alone a video that I want to do all the time.  This video actually makes me want to workout and it gets my heart rate up (I've done tapes at all levels, including the tough Firm and Gin Miller videos/DVDs, so I'm not an out of shape beginner).

This is one of my favorite dance videos for the same reason other people don't seem to like it.  I like the fact that it does not slow down unnecessarily to give instructions and then later pick up the pace.  That's the problem with a lot of dance videos.  When you've mastered the moves, you get bored and your heart rate goes down when you have to go through the instructional phase of the workout for the 100th time. I prefer real dancing over traditional aerobics and kickboxing for a workout, but most of the dance-oriented videos out there have too many pauses or the moves aren't vigorous enough for a workout. With Crunch Fat Blaster Goes Latin though, I feel as if my 30 minutes were well spent. I push myself harder with this one because I like the moves (especially the sequence with the samba) and you get more out of it that way. The moves aren't at all complicated, so there's no need for the instructor to teach the moves at a slower pace.

To top it off, I love the instructor.  She's not overly perky and irritating like many others, but she's still lively and fun. And thankfully, there is a lot less of the annoying whooping that seems to accompany most Crunch videos.  Or maybe I was having so much fun that I didn't notice it.

Not every video will work for everyone, but if you like a little fun in your workouts without sacrificing the satisfying feeling of working up a good sweat, this might be worth a try for you.",1118620800,2,1870,4.304843304843305
7892983,2,6305650683,"I really wanted to like this video - I was really excited about adding a little Latin flair to my workout.  Let me just say that when my hubby and I previewed this video our mouths dropped open when we saw the fast pace of this video with NO instruction at all!  How are you supposed to dive right in like that - especially when you're out of shape and NOT a dancer - and be expected to learn the moves?  I tried this video - and had to rewind it just to get a good workout!  I tried so hard the first time to get the moves, but found myself confused most of the time.  The second time I just ended up (in certain parts of the video) doing my own thing just to get a sweat going.  I love the instructor - I think she is so pretty and full of energy - but she needs to slow down and take the time to teach you the move!  It was like they had all taken a triple dose of ritalin that day!  There was no way I could keep up.  So, I'm afraid that this video will be collecting dust at my house.",1091750400,,989,3.7853658536585364
