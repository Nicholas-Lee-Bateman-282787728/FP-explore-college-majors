8083046,5,B000B7VZLA,"For fans of the 1978 film ""The Thirty-Nine Steps"" starring Robert Powell, Karen Dotrice, David Warner, and John Mills, this is a prequel series of Richard Hannay's adventures. The character of Hannay is cool, fast-thinking, and very adept at getting out of situations he didn't realize he was getting into. He can't even take a trip to a wedding without getting caught up in a jewelry robbery, much less take a train trip on the Orient Express without getting tangled up in international espionage.  And when he's invited to invest in medical research, he ends up having to prevent a major biological attack on London.  Guest stars include Alex Kingston (River Song of Dr. Who), Joanna David (the Girl from Jeremy Brett's ""Rebecca""), and others easily recognizable to BBC/ITV viewers. I had hoped that the series would be released in the US, but have given up hope of that. The series is set in n1912, with beautiful production values. (The film, which was NOT a remake of the 1939 Hitchcock or the 1959 Kenneth More film, is also not available in NTSC format other than an Italian import or viewing on amazon.) I've been looking for the series for a while - now that I have a universal disc player, this is going to be a very special gift!",1498003200,,1240,4.657534246575342
