2789188,5,B000O179IQ,"""Animaniacs"" is a most enjoyable cartoon series - even though the pop culture references are a little dated now. The Warner brothers (and their sister) never fail to make me laugh. All the talented voice actors do a wonderful job of bringing their wacky characters to life. My favorite two hours of Saturday morning cartoons used to be ""Animaniacs"", ""Pinky and The Brain"", ""Freakazoid"" and ""Earthworm Jim"". I sure miss that lineup! I wish someone would get their butts in gear and release ""Freakazoid"" and ""Earthworm Jim"" on DVD, too. I am anxiously awaiting the release of the ""Animaniacs, Vol. 4"" DVD set.",1187308800,13,607,4.902912621359223
2789219,5,B000O179IQ,"It has been fun to reconnect with my childhood zaniness!  The Anamaniacs are funny, weird, clever, and even educational cartoon characters.  It contains many 90's pop references as well as classic movie knowledge alongside allusions to history, geography, and literature.  It's great for both children and adults!",1408579200,,313,5.617021276595745
2789220,5,B000O179IQ,I missed watching the Animaniacs. Modern cartoons are fine for modern kids but this is what I grew up with. I still laugh and enjoy every episode of the Animaniacs. It was well worth the price for a trip down memory lane.,1394323200,,221,4.285714285714286
2789221,5,B000O179IQ,The kids love it and would watch it non-stop if I would let them.  I appreciate the parody and old school slapstick approach...the way cartoons were done back in the day.,1371600000,,170,4.483870967741935
2789222,5,B000O179IQ,"I love this trio. They can brighten anyone's day with their crazy adventures and their witiness. I loved this show when it first debut and am still a huge fan. Who else but Yakko, Wakko, and Dot to make any situation (like being stuck in an elevator) funny and enjoyable. I would recommend this set to anyone who needs a good laugh.",1361664000,,332,4.370967741935484
2789223,5,B000O179IQ,"Meet Yakk,o, Wakko, and Dot as the run amok on Warner Bros. lot. You'll also meet Pinky and the Brain who like to rule the universe, Slappy, the pessimistic squirrel and her nephew, Skippy, the Goodfeathers (pigeons) who always seem to have bad luck, Buttons, Mindy's poor dog who is constantly chasing after and keeping safe the young toddler, but never seems to get a biscuit, and more.

A laugh-out loud hysterical show. Due to the age of some of the jokes, kids probably won't get some of them, but it still has enough laughs to keep anyone going. Throughout the series, the producers even throw in a few funny songs that teach kids educational things or some moral to life that they should know. The characters are fairly well-developed for only ever appeal in short ""episodes"" and it's easy for kids to relate to any of the cartoon characters. This series is fun for the whole family.",1358812800,,890,4.632911392405063
2789224,5,B000O179IQ,"Purchased these videos as a Christmas present for my daughter, who has been watching the episodes online, and being a UK resident, was unable to find any store in the UK which actually sold these.  Bearing in mind it was close to Christmas, I didn't expect the dvds to arrive before the big day from the USA, but they did arrive in time for New Year.  Overall, very smooth transaction, and would not hesitate in placing any future orders with the company.",1357948800,,455,4.536585365853658
2789225,5,B000O179IQ,Great show - brings back many childhood memories. Topical humor at its best! Wish they made more cartoons with this kind of wit!,1357689600,,128,4.608695652173913
2789226,5,B000O179IQ,We bought this for our kids cause we remember watching it when we were younger and we thought it was great.,1356912000,,107,4.142857142857143
2789227,5,B000O179IQ,"Holy free hollies! The DVD of the century is finally here! We all know that Steven Speilberg can do almost anything. He gave birth to the summer blockbuster, turned Harrison Ford into a film icon and created one of the most horrifying yet respectable movies (Schindler's List.) Where could he go from here? He started a cartoon empire. In the early 1990's a whole group of Spielberg cartoons busted onto the TV and gave us plenty to laugh about, but also learn about. Animaniacs is probably the most brilliant cartoon ever to be created...EVER!

Animanics is about 3 whatchimawhozits named Yakko Wakko and Dot. They were locked away in the 30's for being out of control and now they have escaped! Since they escaped they have made fun of pop culture in every way possible but also gave us a huge amount of knowledge through word and song. Consider it Sesame street for older kids and adults. The songs like Yakkos World, The Senses Song and many others are what really made this tv show stand out and show the world that cartoons don't always have to be just plain silly or action packed where the good guy wins every time. This DVD set is a must have in your collection. If you are a die hard fan of the show or never saw it in your life, it is still a must have. I guarantee that you will not be disappointed and if you are I expect to hear from you!",1356134400,3,1352,4.365079365079365
2789228,5,B000O179IQ,"Funny, even with some of yesterday's pop culture references... I relish my five year old quoting the episodes, much more than today's SpongeBob and <shudder> Regular Show.",1355529600,,171,5.37037037037037
2789239,5,B000O179IQ,"Wakko,Yakko,Dot and The Goodfeathers head a lineup of absolute classic slapstick,brilliant,childish,hilarious,stupid things you will ever hear or watch,tummy wobbling guaranteed",1352505600,,177,7.9

2789241,5,B000O179IQ,"I use to watch this cartoon every day that I came home from school. Now I can watch the complete series whenever I want to. Shipping was quick (even coming to Alaska). My wife got it for me, now me and my 3 year old sit and watch it (yes she's 3 and she likes it too). Now I keep a few of the disk in my truck, so when I know we are going to be on a long trip the kids have something to watch.",1301616000,,393,3.528735632183908

2789244,5,B000O179IQ,"make these review requests go away. The DVD is fabulous, the follow up annoying. Design the website for crappy slow third world service. Where's the submit button? How can I make this sloooooow web page go away? What a crappy design. You must be the red 'lectroids from the eighth dimension.

2789246,3,B000O179IQ,I searched for the Pinky and The Brain cartoon series on DVD when I came across this set of DVD's. I thought I had purchased something else when I received my package. It does have the cartoons inside but it also has everything else.  The entire DVD set wasn't what I liked.,1255219200,,274,4.269230769230769
2789247,4,B000O179IQ,This pack is really fun.  It brings back the singing and history aspects that cartoons used to have.,1255219200,2,100,4.555555555555555
2789248,4,B000O179IQ,LOVE the Animaniac DVDs. Particularly useful when babysitting. Kids love it and it's a lot more fun to watch than most kids shows :),1244764800,2,132,4.541666666666667
2789269,5,B000O179IQ,"Makes you wish they were still on TV, instead of the cruddy cartoons that are on now.",1235692800,6,85,4.0588235294117645

2789272,5,B000O179IQ,"This show is so good!  My fianc and I used to watch this show when we were younger, and it's as cute, funny, and intelligent as we both remember.  It's such a joy to be able to sit down and watch these now as adults and relive the fond memories and discover the things we missed when we were younger.",1216166400,,300,3.9833333333333334
2789273,5,B000O179IQ,"Animaniacs is really zany, and fun at the same time. Wouldn't it nice if the final volume of Animaniacs came out on DVD? I hope Animaniacs Volume 4, which will be the last of the show, is released on DVD, after the production of Tiny Toon Adventures, and Freakazoid! Warner Bros., please say you have plans of releasing Animaniacs Volume 4 in the near future.",1214352000,,359,4.538461538461538
2789274,5,B000O179IQ,"The first three volumes of animaniacs are extremly funny. It has some classic episodes that I have not seen in years. This would be great to buy if you need a laugh or you want to relive old memories or share with a younger generation. The only problem is that you can buy the first three volumes but there might not be a volume four. This set brings you half way through season three and just leaves you. So if enough people buy this, then we might get to finish the series.",1205539200,16,475,4.173913043478261
2789275,5,B000O179IQ,"I agree with the other three reviewers. This is top notch stuff.

Where is season 4? These other three volumes allow us to see the first 75 episodes of the series, but there were 99 episodes.

And where is the FREAKAZOID series? And HYSTERIA?

Where's an on line petition when you need one?",1204934400,2,290,4.433962264150943
2789276,5,B000O179IQ,I loved animaniacs as a kid and I still love it today. This is mainly because of the use of a delightful wittiness and satyrical view of historical moments and people.,1195257600,,167,4.419354838709677
2789277,5,B000O179IQ,"75 episodes of pushing limits, pushing buttons, filled with zany and cultural sendups and gags. Assume EVERYTHING! Cause anything is possible with Yakko, Wacko and the Warner sister Dot.

Great paraodys of films/ film makers and gullable hollywood celebrities...and yet it is all presented in light hearted nature for the younger generation to enjoy as well.

Having grown up with this entertainment and not been able to purchase the Animaniacs set in Australia, it surly is worth it",1194307200,7,483,5.17948717948718

8182574,5,B000O179IQ,"My kids love these DVDs.  These shows came out over 20 years before my kids were born, but my kids absolutely love them.  Nothing else they watch today can even compare.  They watch them on long road trips and it's funny to hear them giggling and laughing in the back seat of the car as they watch.  The only weird side effect is that they call out ""Helloooo Nurse!"" when they see a pretty girl.  It can be a bit embarrassing.",1504742400,,426,4.209876543209877
8182575,4,B000O179IQ,"I bought this as a Christmas gift, then decided to save it for February birthday, so I cannot fairly rate it yet.  Our family has always enjoyed Animaniacs and so I expect it to be a delightful gift.
