225408,4,630021320X,So far the only things I have found lacking in these DVD's is the lack of extras to include Spanish/French subtitles and dubbing as well as extra info about the shooting of the individual episodes such as unseen footage  etc..,955411200,,226,4.65
225409,5,630021320X,If you're wondering which of the Original Series dvds to get first I'd advise you to get this one.  Simply brilliant from beginning to end.

225410,5,630021320X,"""The Menagerie"" has consistently scored as one of the top ten most popular episodes of the original series.  Both the flashback and wraparound plotlines are among the best Star Trek had to offer.  Spock is  willing to sacrifice his career--and perhaps his life--to ensure that  Christopher Pike, his former Captain--horribly disfigured by a recent space  disaster--can spend his remaining years in comfort and happiness.  If that  is not an act of love, I don't know what is.
Paramount has simply  outdone itself in the remastering of this episode.  The flashback elements  date back to 1964, yet they look so fresh they could have been filmed  yesterday.  It is also  interesting to see the great care the original  cinematographer took with lighting--most of the compositions are simply  beautiful--and far superior to today's more flatly lit approach.  The sound  has been remarkably enhanced, with both the sound effects and score in  stereo.
It is interesting to compare ""The Cage"" with the  original series.  Although it is very impressive as science fiction, there  is very little chemistry between the characters (similar to ""The Next  Generation"").  Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelley, and the consistently  underrated William Shater made a far more effective team in that  respect.
This is a must for all Star Trek fans.",954288000,21,1326,5.2

225465,5,630021320X,"As `Star Trek' rapidly approaches its 50th anniversary, it is a given that the tragic ""City on the Edge of Forever"" and the laugh-out loud ""The Trouble With Tribbles"" are considered the original TV series' best two episodes.  Still, I suggest that ""The Menagerie, Parts I & II,"" is the original series' most poignant tale and is definitely worth of re-discovery by today's generation.  Director J.J. Abrams' past two 'Trek' films have ret-conned Captain Christopher Pike (portrayed by Bruce Greenwood) as the new Captain Kirk's predecessor, mentor, and surrogate dad.  As agreeable as Greenwood's portrayal is, perhaps it is time to re-evaluate the original Pike (the late Jeffrey Hunter) whose protg instead proved to be Spock.

In 1965, producer Gene Roddenberry's initial `Trek' pilot entitled ""The Cage"" was rejected by NBC as being ""too cerebral,"" with too many unapppealing characters/actors and too little action.  Truth be told, NBC did Roddenberry a huge favor by allowing him an almost-unprecedented second pilot (""Where No Man Has Gone Before"") soon after and setting in motion the `Star Trek' we know today.  By late 1966, with its first season already near the halfway mark, a hard-pressed Roddenberry ingeniously recycled most of ""The Cage"" into what became ""The Menagerie, Parts I and II.""

Book-ended by an intriguing storyline (set thirteen years after ""The Cage"") the plot has Spock has inexplicably abduct his invalid former captain and hijack the Enterprise, only to be court-martialed.  The original series' only two-part episode cleverly integrates mysterious ""trial evidence"" revealing how Pike and his crew encountered an illusion-casting alien race on planet Talos IV.  Played extremely well with some possibly sinister overtones, the enigmatic motive behind Spock's defiant conspiracy with the Talosians isn't revealed until near the end.  Replacing Jeffrey Hunter, actor Sean Kinney portrays a crippled, wheelchair-bound Pike suffering a hellish, vegetative existence from severe radiation exposure.  Pike's tragic condition is the only hint we initially have as to why Spock would even want to risk returning his former captain to a planet so forbidden that going there invokes the Federation's only death penalty offense.  The first half concludes with a tense scene between Kirk and Spock setting up a cliffhanger.  The mystery's solution becomes fairly obvious in the second half.  Arguably, the second half's last few minutes provide one of Spock's all-time best moments in revealing his compassion and loyalty.

As for this Captain Pike and his crew, Hunter offers a solid performance while his co-stars do their best with surprisingly generic characters.  Majel Barrett (billed as M. Leigh Hudec), as Number One, and John Hoyt, as Dr. Boyce, have the best supporting parts, but the acting MVP deservedly goes to guest star Susan Oliver for her challenging role as Vina.  Leonard Nimoy's presence is notable only for being the Enterprise's token alien crew member.  Still, watch for young Spock's wide grin while examining an odd plant on Talos IV.  Nimoy and the writers hadn't yet fleshed out his character's distinctive Vulcan personality, as this Spock clearly is a rough draft.  That actually sums ups ""The Cage:"" it is a `Trek' rough draft featuring an original, intelligent storyline but missing the vital element of charismatic characters necessary to make the story really click.

Beyond the actor upgrades, the vast improvement of ""The Menagerie"" over ""The Cage"" is most apparent in the difference in their finales.  Watching ""The Cage,"" the open ending clearly implied that it was simply on to the next episode, while ""The Menagerie"" will reward you with something to think about when it is over.  Hence, ""The Menagerie"" truly makes the `Trek' magic come to life by bringing all of science fiction's best elements together.  Viewing ""The Cage"" (minus a few scenes) inside ""The Menagerie, Parts I & II,"" however, remains an enlightening experience to see where `Trek' could have gone where no one has gone before.

Rating: 5 stars.  Suffice to say, ""The Menagerie, Parts I & II"" offers an inspiring, sentimental theme about why one should feel blessed and fulfilled by reality --  just like enjoying any fantasy or illusion.

P.S. From the same out-of-print Star Trek DVD collection (two episodes per volume), it concludes with a double feature of the original series' last episode: the dubious ""Turnabout Intruder,"" with ""The Cage"" (linking the unused black-and-white footage with its colorized ""Menagerie"" scenes).",1397606400,,4559,5.311977715877437

225500,5,630021320X,"One of the best episodes of Star Trek, the original series. Captain Kirk's idol (Captain Pike) from the Enterprise ship was shown as he was before the attack of delta rays which left him as a total  non capacited person, (just to say that he was so handsome and cute before that attack). That episode of the Talus IV planet I watched for the very first time in my country -Peru-  in 1967 in the  spanish version  and in black and white. However, it was so well done due to the year released, that impressed me so much. I was only 11 years old and it got me in that way that I thought it was real and left me thinking about what kind of planets would exist up there in the many galaxies outspace. At the end, the talusians gave Captain Pike his original appearence and made him living an illusional life with his female companion (also restored by those beings)happy ever after. So many questions about that illusional life like for example, are they going to get old?, how come if they are living an illusion of beauty and youth?, still remain without answer.

That was also the Apollo era and everybody was crazy about spaceships and the astronauts, etc., so the episode just match the moment.
The impression that brought me when I watched those series just kept in my mind during my whole life, and  now that I came to America ten years ago I finally found those episodes so I can remember them and watch them also anytime I want, mostly when I feel nostalgic about the time I lived and it is not coming back anymore.

Comparing the original series with the ""Next Generation"" episodes, the first ones have many flaws, but that is the point, at that moment there weren't so many special effects or computer effects that sometimes overcome the watcher and they left the other things to our imagination, which of course was better than the sometimes dissapointment ""effects""

It also reveals the loyalty, about the always logical Mr. Spock (who was the favorite personage of the series) and his former superior even though he put in risk his future in the Starfleet and the new crew's, the gentle manners of Captain Pike, the way that he was, honest and clear. Some of that attributes me and my friends were looking forward to get male friends, which after sometime we knew it was not going to be true, because he was a fictional creation but not a real one. To me, they always exist in the ""space-time"" dimenssion, like Einstein once explained, but in my only way theory: I can put the DVD in my player and watch them like thousand times.",1308182400,,2538,4.490238611713666
225501,5,630021320X,"Jeffrey Hunter decided not to continue his Star Trek role from the first pilot, ""The Cage"" and thus a second pilot (""Where No Man Has Gone Before"") was created with William Shatner in the role of the new captain, James T, Kirk with Leonard Nimoy returning as ""Spock"". This began the original tv series that was broadcast in color on NBC (1966-69).
  Since nobody saw the unaired first pilot, ""The Cage"", in 1964 (It was not broadcast nor available on VHS until 1986), they chose to create two episodes called ""The Menagerie"" (episode 11 & 12) with new footage and the old 1964 footage with Jeffery Hunter as ""Captain Pike"". In the new story, Actor Sean Kenney played the injured Captain Pike.

 Commodore Jose Mendez (Malachi Throne) has invited the Enterprise officials to visit Captain Pike (Sean Kenney), the former captain of the Enterprise.  They discover Pike has been severely damaged while trying to save some children. Only Pike will allow Spock to stay. Pike knows he must go on trial, but refuses. Pike is secretly beamed up on the Enterprise and they head for Talos IV where it all began.
 Meanwhile, Spock is under arrest for mutiny and the trial is under way with Mendez, Kirk and Pike in attendance.
  Sadly, Jeffrey Hunter died May 27, 1969. Age: 42. He previously had stroke. he had a fall that caused head trama. He died from complications of the fall and surgery.

That's one of the reasons why I bought ""The Cage"" after I already had ""The Menagerie"". But still ""The Menagerie"" is the superior version.

225507,5,630021320X,"In addition to being a great double episode, this one thus becomes an early ""Star Trek Movie,"" and a darned good one too! I gleaned some of the following information (edited and mixed with my own comments) from Wikipedia for the benefit of consumers here.

Here we get to see the ORIGINAL Captain of the Starship Enterprise, Jeffrey Hunter, who played the role of Captain Pike. Hunter wasn't nearly as theatrical and overdramatic as William Shatner, who ended up in the role of Captain James T. Kirk, but would have, in my opinion, been equally great for the entire series had he stayed on board.

Part one of the two-part episode was broadcast on November 17, 1966 with the second part broadcast a week later on November 24, 1966.

Here, Spock has to trick Captain Kirk and essentially commit treason in taking the Enterprise to the forbidden Planet, Talos IV. At his trial for that infraction, Captain Pike, a man unable to move or speak except through an electronic device, ultimately reveals the story behind Spock's bizarre deception.

New filming took place for the framing story for ""The Cage,"" the Star Trek pilot film which Gene Roddenberry shrewdly utilized in the production of this episode. Since actor Jeffrey Hunter was unavailable to reprise his role as Captain Pike, a look-alike actor, Sean Kenney, played the injured captain in the new scenes of ""The Menagerie"".

Sadly, in 1969, while flying back to the U.S. from Spain after filming ""Viva America!,"" Jeffrey Hunter suffered the signs of a stroke. After recovering at a hospital in Los Angeles, he suffered another stroke while at home, causing a fall and a skull fracture. He died the following day from his injuries and was ultimately interred in the Glen Haven Memorial Park cemetery in Sylmar, California.

In summary, while this double episode is NOT representative of the typical Star Trek program, it's still a superb entry and any fan of science fiction television would much enjoy this intriguing and coherent story. You don't have to be a Trekkie to ""get it"".",1201305600,3,2038,4.875722543352601

I hope that my kids will have a show or two that when they reach my age, will be as good as they remember. Like this is for me.",1188691200,,410,3.9518072289156625
225509,5,630021320X,"""The Menagerie"" is a unique chapter in Trek history. Unable to deliver new episodes quickly enough (due to Trek's exceptionally long postproduction times in those days), the producers wrote a 2-part episode based largely around the original pilot for the show, which NBC had rejected. The newer scenes are mostly simple set-ups aboard ship or a starbase.

The story-telling device is ingenious. Spock was the only crew member to carry over from the original cast. In Part I of ""The Menagerie,"" Spock hijacks the Enterprise to take his old captain, Christopher Pike, back to planet Talos IV. In the resulting mutiny trial, images are beamed from the planet. This footage is actually reused from the original Star Trek pilot, ""The Cage.""

The resulting two-part story is an award-winning masterpiece. Roddenberry was fond of his original pilot and liked to show it by itself. But a great deal is gained by the framing device, or ""envelope."" (Note that there is little ""Cage"" footage that did not get reused in ""The Menagerie"" -- just a couple of brief scenes.) By seeing old and new Enterprise footage side by side, we get a sense of Federation history and continuity. There are some cosmetic changes, which would be natural, but it's basically the same ship. We see how deep the quality of loyalty is in Spock. Normally Spock's loyalty is to Kirk, but Spock's loyalty to his old captain -- also an Earthman -- in my opinion makes Spock all the more admirable.

We also get to see Kirk and Pike side by side. These are similar men, both bold decisive leaders on the young side of 40. But Jefferey Hunter (whose other major role was Jesus) brought less of a sense of humor to Captain Pike than Shatner often did with Kirk.

""The Cage"" itself, which makes up the bulk of Part II, is quite good. The big-brained Talosians captured Pike and sought to make him mate and settle down with an Earth woman, Vina (the delightful Susan Oliver). When they see that human hatred of captivity -- as demonstrated by Pike -- is too great, they realize that humans aren't useful to them and they let him go. Using the power of illusion, they offered many enticements. The scene in which they make Vina appear as a green Orion slave girl is the sexiest in all of Star Trek, and it's worth the money for that scene alone.

The final scene (back on the current Enterprise) is one of the most moving in the history of the franchise. As the credits roll, we see Kirk gaze in awe as he sees the Talosians use their mental powers to restore the severely-disabled Pike to a full and joyful life. ""He has illusion and you have reality."" It is a very humane ending that helps to make up for the Talosians' earlier bad behavior.",1182211200,,2698,4.6125
225560,4,630021320X,"Gene Roddenberry conceived these episodes to utilize footage from the costly first Star Trek pilot, which had been considered too cerebral by the network.  Now that it is possible to view ""The Cage"" in its intended version, there is really no reason for these episodes anymore.  Of course, no one could know that then, and for many years this was the only way that fine pilot could be seen in any form.  The framing story, in which Spock (Leonard Nimoy) risks court martial to return his disfigured former captain (Jeffrey Hunter) to Talos IV, is frequently awkward.  However, it does provide a plausible pretext for strong conflict between the main characters and a touching send-off for the former captain of the Enterprise, Christopher Pike.",1167696000,,744,4.975806451612903

 When Star Trek's production crew started falling behind in both schedule and budgets during the first season, they came up with the brilliant idea of using the unsold The Cage pilot as the basis for a two part episode. The result: One of the most important and brilliant Treks ever done!

Everyone knows the basic plot by now: Spock kidnaps his crippled former Captain, and hijacks the Enterprise, and sets course for the one forbidden planet in all The Federation. He eventually is court-martialed en route, and presents as his evidence an unusally detailed account of the Enterprise's visit to Talos IV 13 years prior.

THIS is the episode which cements Spock's character forever: the supposedly emotionless Vulcan, who demonstrates more passion and loyalty than most humans. Leonard Nimoy's performance is one of his best as Spock : initially seeming as though Spock had gone crazy almost, kidnapping Pike, using false computer tapes and voices to convince people that the ship is under 'secret orders', all sorts of indications SOMEthing must be wrong with Spock...until after the Talosian's plan is revealed,where it is found THEY have been manipulating events all along, and Spock returns to his stoic self.....except..when leaving the briefing room with Pike for the last time, his head bowed, shoulders slumped.

Shatner's understated performance in this has been sloughed off in some circles. I say :'unfair'...Frankly, it is PERFECT for the events - all during these events, Kirk acts rather stunned at all these events: His friend and 1st Officer has seemingly gone crazy and hijacked his ship, he almost dies going after him in a shutle, THEN he is releived of command for all of this! By the time the Talosians supposedly abandon Spock and forces the trial board to take a vote, even Kirk is convinced Spock should be put away. But..at the end..is able to smile when the Talosian shows him the 'rejuvenated' Pike happy again at last.

All of these performances are directed with care by Marc Daniels, the veteran TV director who was at the helm of the 'envelope'. They make an deliberate  point of cutting to the more mature, unemotional Spock during the famous 'laughing' scene,and you can ALMOST see a flicker of 'was I THAT emotional?' cross his face!

The makeup used on Sean Kenney, the 'substitute' Captain Pike (Jeffery Hunter was unavailable),might be some of the best ever done for any Trek: it holds up totally through repeated cuts back and forth from the pilot footage: you are totally convinced this is an older, horribly maimed Jeffrey Hunter!

Some small parts of The Cage are cut: some shots of Pike's fellow 'zoo-mates', some VERY sexist lines about 'women on the bridge', and the obligatory 'aliens running through the computer' scene. None of these are very important to the plot of EITHER the pilot or the envelope.

And just to add some trivia:

Part II of The Menagerie was the highest rated episode of Star trek ever in prime time!

Actor Malachi Throne had been the original voice of the Talosian Keeper in the pilot. Since he was cast as Commodore Mendez, voice artist Vic Perrin was dubbed in as The Keeper.

As per the Director's Guild, Marc Daniels was credited as director for Part I, while the director of The Cage, Robert (Mr Pilot) Butler, was given the screen credit for Part II.

The Menagerie is amazing experience from start to finish!",1146009600,,3395,4.902268760907504
225563,5,630021320X,"On September 8, 1966 Star Trek premiered on NBC to little critical acclaim.  In the weeks that followed Star Trek's audience of ardent fans was treated to shows unlike anything else they had seen on television.  Over the course of the evenings of both November 17 and November 24 of that same year Star Trek aired an episode titled 'The Menagerie' and science fiction on television came of age - and, more importantly, people noticed.  The episode has become legendary over these past many years, some Trekkies considering it the best show in the whole of the Star Trek canon.  While that point may be arguable it is no question that 'The Menagerie' helped put the series over the top.  Nearly every one of us fans knows the story of this episode: in 1965 the NBC network approved the series for production but rejected the series pilot titled 'The Cage'; that footage was then used as a ""wrap-around"" story for 'The Menagerie' detailing the extraordinary experiences of the crew of the Enterprise, and in particular Captain Pike, on Talos IV.  The story itself is quite good but it's the use of the footage of the failed pilot that makes this episode so brilliant.

While enroute to deliver much needed medical supplies to the distant Vegan colony the Enterprise intercepts an old style earth radio transmission.  The signal is determined to be sent by a Starfleet vessel and originating from a nearby star system; further the Enterprise's science officers discover that the signal had been sent over 17 years earlier, when the vessel was first listed as missing.  When it's confirmed there are survivors the Enterprise travels there to rescue them.  Very soon upon their arrival the landing party makes some mysterious discoveries about the survivors - including an alluring and seductive beauty named Vina. The captain is taken captive and held in an underground cavern by the planet's inhabitants, the Talosians, where he is forced against his will to live through illusion after another.  The crew members try to rescue the captain but continually fail; two female members of the bridge crew are taken hostage when the Enterprise attempts to beam a landing party inside the caverns.  The Talosians are attempting to entice the earthlings into propagation in order to reproduce a new race of beings to repopulate the planet which once thrived.  When the Talosians realize that humans will not be contented to be caged they relent and allow the Enterprise and its crew to leave.  Vina however, who was the only human survivor of a scientific expedition that crash-landed on Talos IV seventeen years earlier, harbors a secret that leaves her with little choice but to stay.

That was the story in the original pilot aptly titled 'The Cage'.  In 'The Menagerie' Spock both shanghais his former commander, Captain Pike, from Starbase 11 and commandeers the Enterprise through a series of masterful maneuvers.  Pike is now a virtual invalid having been paralyzed and horribly disfigured in an accident.  When Spock takes his charade as far as he can he turns himself over for judicial punishment but does not relinquish his control over the Enterprise - which is now being controlled by computers and set on a course for Talos IV.  Contact with the planet is forbidden by the Federation and violation of the directive is punishable by death.  A court martial is convened to determine Spock's culpability and what his reasons are for taking such an incredible risk.  During the trial Spock refuses to divulge his reasons and instead the officials arbitrating the court martial are fed images from Talos IV that picture what happened on the Enterprise's visit there 13 years ago.  The mystery of what happened to them there is revealed onscreen and the reasons for Spock's actions become clear and the intrepid first officer escapes judicial punishment.

Even after all these many years and several Star Trek incarnations this episode continues to hold it's own among the very best shows Trek has produced.  And what might be seen as dated production elements are actually still quite impressive when seen today.  In particular the matte painting in the background of the opening sequence where Kirk, Spock and McCoy are greeted by Miss Piper is among the very best produced for the original series; the matte painting of the fortress on Rigel VII is another memorable shot.  I also liked the fact that the survivors the Enterprise encounters on Talos IV were wearing tattered remnants of clothing and that the camp was a sort of slap-dash and hodge-podge of pieces from wreckage - the wreckage of a starship they detected from their scanners on the Enterprise.  Too often the production department opted to use props that looked entirely too new and clean for scenes in the original series when clearly that should not have been the case.

The only knock I have against 'The Menagerie' is that the happy ending has one insurmountable shortcoming.  At the end of the episode Captain Pike joins Vina on the surface of Talos IV presumably to live out the rest of his life.  Since we discovered earlier in the show that Pike now has a battery driven heart let's hope the Enterprise left the Talosians with a prodigious supply of Duracells, Energizers or Everreadys!  Vina explained to Pike during the course of the episode that the Talosians had forgotten how to fix their machines in the centuries since they began living in the underground caverns.  And as evidenced at the conclusion of the show the top of the elevator shaft is still blown off, remaining in the same state of destruction the Enterprise had done to it 13 years earlier.  But of course now that the captain is able to speak and is mobile once again he can probably come up with a solution to that problem huh?  Let's hope so anyway!

The court room sequences have one curiosity too that is a bit glaring.  All of the officers present for the trial are in full dress uniform with the exception of Mr. Scott who wears the familiar red long-sleeve shirt while he operates a computer that I presume is recording the events seen onscreen.  Speaking of Scotty he has only one line of dialogue during the show - if you can call it a line that is.  After Commodore Mendes and Kirk beam aboard the Enterprise a message is received in the transporter room to the effect that the computers aren't responding to commands or inputs.  Scotty grunts something unintelligible and walks out of the transporter room.  Apparently the writers couldn't spare one piece of dialogue for the ship's engineer; granted he isn't a peripheral character to the drama unfolding here but it's a shabby way to portray one of the staff officers of the flagship of the Federation.

Worth noting: That is of course Majel Barrett seen playing Number One here who portrays Nurse Christine Chapel in subsequent episodes; John Hoyt, who plays Dr. Philip Boyce, is a familiar character actor and veteran of a few science fiction films of the 50's most notably in 'When World's Collide'; because Jeffrey Hunter had passed away it was decided to have his character depicted in the unrecognizable manner seen here and played by another actor; Mr. Spock acts very un-Vulcan like in the scenes on the planet's surface where he smiles a few times; this episode received a 1967 Hugo award as the best television screenplay (written by Gene Roddenberry).",1101859200,,7369,4.867894315452362
225564,4,630021320X,"I'd give this episode(s) 5 stars except for the reason the main story (The Cage) got incorperated into it, the Trial of Spock.  Not only was it a sad excuse to re-view Capt. Pike's adventure but uses something a more perfect future should be done with - lawyers!
I realize that the story needed a context for the present Enterprise crew to contemplate Pike's story but Spock could have kidnapped Pike and explained the back story to audience in flashbacks during the trip (as an example).  Even a battle scene where Kirk has to stop Spock from landing on Talos IV would have been great (oops! sorry, no decent special effects then).
Only the confrontation between Kirk and Spock should have been left alone.
p.s.  ST:TOS also played the lawyer card in Court-Martial, a lame excuse for a story.  ST:TNG had at least four court-cases, played out to predictable endings.
Among them:
1) Data is saved from a scientist who wants to dis-assemble him.
2) Riker is falsely accused of murder.
3) In The Drumhead an out of control witch hunt is stopped when the lawyer looses it!
4) A Society is freed from an alien posing as ""their god"".

225566,5,630021320X,"Volume 8 of the Star Trek DVD collection contains the series only 2 part episode.  THE MENAGERIE is easily one of the series best dramas and also easily one of the best episodes of the first season.  Creator Gene Roddenberry made a very clever move in this episode.  Using the footage from the (at the time) un-seen pilot episode THE CAGE, he made an episode that revolved around Captain Pike.
The MENAGERIE takes place 13 years after the events that occured in THE CAGE.  Spock was a crew member aboard the USS Enterprise during Cpt. Pike's command.  However now Pike is severely crippled from a freak accident when he was saving some children.  He is still the same person he once was only trapped inside a useless body, a vegetable if you will.  When they arrive on a planet Spock and Kirk meet up with Pike after many years.  Spock kidnaps Pike and sets the Enterprises course to Rigel IV the forbidden planet.  He is arrested and sent to court for a court martial for disobeying Kirk orders.  Spock explains why he is doing this and during the court shows footage that occured 13 years ago.  If Spock is not guilty he will be able to continue his assignment if he is Kirk will be forced to find him guilty and the Vulcan will be court martialed.
THE MENAGERIE was a wonderful episode that ranks as one of the series most complex plots.  Partly because it is a two parter but the best thing about this was Roddenberry was finally able to put some of the unused footage from THE CAGE to use.  Although the run of THE CAGE here is quite disjointed it gives you the basic jist of the plot.  It also features the famous bulb head aliens that treat human like zoo animals.
Overall Volume 8 is a essential 2 part Trek episode that must be seen.  It is great to see Cpt. Pike again even though he is terribly scarred and says nothing.  Still this DVD is one of the collections finest.  Highly recommended!",1024876800,,1902,4.419540229885057

Gene Roddenberry needed a reason to take the already shot footage of the original pilot which (never aird) in the series now being broadcast. So in an effort to save money for two weeks, he wrote a very simples Court Martial Story around the original pilot.
Explaining what happened to the orginal captain and Starship named Enterprise. Since the series had been sold on the basis of the second pilot (WHERE NO MAN HAS GONE BEFORE) there had to be an explination of the cast changes, set changes and different ""look"" the show had.
The story is simple and the fact that the original Captain in the original pilot was not available (JEFFEREY HUNTER) they had to put another actor in an electronic wheelchair and cover him up in makeup.
It was a commercial trick, nothing more.",1024012800,,1014,4.486486486486487

Susan Oliver as Vina, oh how beatiful she is. I have always been infatuated with green skinned slave girls anyway. I've made several bids for them, but always fall short cash wise (maybe a dylithium mine would help). Wathing Susan dance half-naked in her green body paint is much too seductive for 1960s and is possibly why the series was not picked up. I can see the producers now thinking ""What the hell bloody show are you perverts trying to make? This is 1964 for crying out loud! Slave women who dance for their owners? Barbarians!""
Well I sit and watch Sweet Vina dance and dance and dance. I never get tired of her. If I was Pike I would have told Spock to fly off without me. I would have made sure the aliens kept her as the 'Green Illusion' and supplied them with a whole herd of slaves to do their manual labor. Sure when you saw her in her real state she was pretty messed up, but no worse than my ex-wife when she woke up with a hangover Sunday morning. I'm glad Pike finally got to be with her. Too bad it took for him to be as messed up as Vina for them to finally be together. Rock on Captain Pike!

After all, every two-part cliffhanger that was broadcast on 'NextGen', 'DS9', and 'Voyager' count as two separate segments... why NOT 'The Menagerie'?

But, aside from this quandary, 'The Menagerie' is a wonderful showcase of the classic Trek producers' efforts to make the most of their budgetary limits. By framing the first (then-unseen) pilot 'The Cage' around a story involving the present Enterprise crew, Desilu managed to shave a couple bucks off of production expenses. It's also interesting to see who might've composed the original 'Trek crew had the first pilot been greenlighted into a TV series. Ah, what might've been...

  --Jeffrey Hunter as Captain Christopher Pike in ""The Menagerie.""
  LIGHTS! CAMERA!  ACTION!  ""The Menagerie"" is the best STAR TREK episode ever!  Jeffrey Hunter is sensational as Captain Christopher Pike, and so is Susan Oliver as his love interest, the deformed space castaway Vina.  This is science fiction at its best--although it's an obvious ripoff of FORBIDDEN PLANET!--with ray guns, space aliens, faster than light travel, lots of women, and a handsome, intellectual leading man of action, former movie star Jeffrey Hunter.
  Hunter as the Captain of the Enterprise has an incredible All American quality to him, and his leading man looks are matched by his performances in the action scenes--he's the ultimate take charge guy of STAR TREK!
  Unfortunately, this is Hunter's only appearance on STAR TREK--his wife at the time talked him out of the role--but it doesn't matter, because once you've seen ""The Menagerie"" you know that JEFFREY HUNTER IS THE REAL CAPTAIN OF THE ENTERPRISE!",989971200,2,1046,5.124260355029586

In addition to the ""musical flowers"" pitch change, the hand held laser weapons, the laser cannon sound, and the transporter sounds have been subtly changed; evident when compared to the vhs version.

In the original version, you hear the sharp contrast as the  loudest of the eerie vibrations disappear abruptly, and then come back (in  synch with Spock clasping and releasing the leaves).
All that is lost in  the transfer to DVD. The ""musical leaf"" sound track has been  beautifully dubbed on in full Dolby Surround - but with no break! Spock  plays with the leaves to no effect; and the whole point of that little  scene has been remastered out of existence!

The  episode got a prestigious Science Fiction award for its creativity in  science fiction and it obviously and definitely deserves it. It is a  continuation of what Gene Roddenberry had in mind for his first, pilot,  episode, 'The Cage'. 'The Menagerie' is a completion of 'The Cage' and it  is in color, whereas 'The Cage' was filmed in Black & White. Captain  Pike (from 'The Cage') was trapped in a cage by the Talosians for  interbreeding purposes with a female human in order to raise a race of  human slaves to save their world from total destruction. Capt. Kirk had to  watch all of this (in 'The Menagerie') while putting Spock on trial for  deliberately trying to take over (and indeed did take over) the Enterprise  to send the mangled, decapacitated, wheel-chair bound, Capt. Pike back to  Talos IV. What happens next, your going to have to find out for yourself by  purchasing this almighty supreme Star Trek episode.
