I actually don't own it any more, I think I gave it away.
Poor guy, I wonder if he lies in bed at night and thinks, ""ugh, why did I do this movie?""
I no longer have a crush on Ian. It was years ago...",1341187200,,295,3.774193548387097
7869394,3,6304372469,"THE CORPORATION has a good idea but it's not done very well at all.  Ian Ziering stars as Darren Danvers, an up and coming video game designer, who has recently been hired by an upper scale corporation.  They pay him in the six figures, give him his own car, a house, and all the perks that go with such a valuable position.  Katherine Kelly Lang is his wife, who wants to finish getting her PHd, something the other wives at the corporation think the company will frown upon.  Andrew Stevens heads up the corporation, and it isn't long before we realize there's something going on here.  Seems like subliminal messages are being put on a new game that will encourage all owners to rush out and buy its upgrade.  To test this subliminal text, they do some pretty bizarre things to the members of the corporation as well.  High tech murder.

Unfortunately, the direction is vapid and the script has so many holes, including an anticlimactic ending and no clear understanding of how things will resolve.

Dee Wallace Stone overacts shamelessly as one of the wives and Larry Mannetti is zombie like and it's not because of the video game.

Ziering does a good job in his leading role, but the script helms him in and never lets him fully develop.

Nice try, but ultimately, a miss.",1095120000,5,1278,4.58590308370044
