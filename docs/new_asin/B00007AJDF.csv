7974556,4,B00007AJDF,"Slow moving, sometimes boring sailing DVD that is confused at what is the intended audience. Some parts are really useful, for example the explanation (and demonstration) of sail shapes is brilliant.

Some other parts leave one wondering at who exactly this DVD is targeted to? People who don't know how to tie a bowline should't be watching a program that goes to such great lengths explaining  how to fly and jibe a spinnaker.

Depending on your skill you will use the skip button often; if you are a novice it is very likely that you will fast forward through racing and some technical parts, if you have been on the water once or twice it is very likely you will skip the timeless advice of putting the sun screen to protect thy nose.

As with the other DVD's in the Annapolis series the footage is relevant, the things are explained well, to the point of actually throwing people overboard not once but twice to illustrate the pickup maneuveres. John Rousmaniere is the author, narrator and the mastermind behind the series; among other things he does have a sailing geek appeal which makes watching the slow parts almost tolerable.",1153526400,,1137,4.7272727272727275
