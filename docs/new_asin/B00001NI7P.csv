8104531,5,B00001NI7P,"This video is not as widely available as Rick's 1985 Universal Amphitheater show, but unlike that video, this is a complete concert. Rick and his band get to show more of what they can do here, once again with vocal assistance from the Jordanaires. This concert came just after Rick broke up the Stone Canyon Band, and put together a new band, with roots in the rockabilly of his youth. These cats play the rockabilly stuff (""Boppin' the Blues"", ""Milkcow Blues"", ""My Bucket's Got a Hole in it"", ""That's All Right"") authentically. This is not a 1980's imitation of the 50's sound - this is the real thing, led by one of the pioneers of the music. Bobby Neal is one of the best guitarists to ever work with Rick - I place him right alongside James Burton. The rhythm section of Ricky Intvelt on drums and Pat Woodward on bass is rock solid. I'm not familiar with the piano player on this tape (possibly a subsitute for Rick's regular piano player, David Morgan), but he fits right in musically. Rick looks great, as vibrant and handsome at 44 as he was in his 30's. His voice is particularly nice on ballads like ""Never Be Anyone Else But You"" and ""Lonesome Town"", with the passing years having added more resonance and timbre. All the biggest hits are here - ""Poor Little Fool"", ""Travelin' Man"", ""Hello Mary Lou"", ""It's Up to You"", ""Garden Party"", etc. Bobby Neal's guitar solo on ""Fools Rush In"" is a highlight, as is Rick doing his first hit, ""I'm Walkin'"" - actually doing it better here than on the original recording. The best moments, though, are when Rick and the band rev things up with some high energy rock and roll on ""Believe What You Say"" (done ""Playing to Win"" style), ""Honky Tonk Women"" (with Rick on piano - who knew he could play like this?!), ""It's Late"", and a new song, ""You Know What I Mean"". If you never got to see Rick in person, this is a good representation of the kind of show he was doing in the mid-80's. If you did, it will bring back the memories.",1197158400,,1977,4.419178082191781
