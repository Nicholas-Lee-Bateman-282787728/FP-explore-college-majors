On the other hand we have Peter Cushing playing the wacked old scientis (one of his best roles), Caroline Munro, some very colorful sets, plenty of action and Doug McClure (well, actually he should probably reside on the first hand).  Some people have held their noses and waved this one off due to the cheapo effects, but the final question should be is this an entertaing film? And the answer would be yes, it is an enjoyable film.

725742,1,630391750X,"Despite all the bad Tarzan films that have been made over the years, ""At the Earth's Core"" is unquestionably the worst adaptation of an Edgar Rice Burroughs' book ever made. I gave this turkey one star because that's the fewest I could give it, If there was a negative star I would use it. The producers of this film took a science fiction adventure classic and made it into pure schlock. From the cheesy sets and costumes, to the rediculous special effects, this movie is bad. Doug McClure is way too old and way too fat to play Burroughs' hero David Innes. Burroughs' inner world of Pellucidar, with its mountains, jungles, seas, and tiny central sun has been reduced to a series of day-glo caverns where rubber suited refugees from a Maurice Sendak book  romp. The Mahars, Burroughs' super intelligent race of pterosaurs look like scaly Muppets in this dog, and their apish servants the Sagoths have become pig faced things that grunt like electronic feedback. Do not buy this film! Buy the book which was just re-released this year in an excellent trade paperback edition with the original illstrations by J.

Well, this flick, at first, gives the impression it's gonna be good, what with the Iron Mole drilling thru the earth and all, but once they arrive at earth's core-ville things take a turn for the nasty.  Watching these guys in rubber monster suits for an hour makes the dinosaur puppets from 'Land That Time Forgot' look like CGI.  On the flip side, Peter Cushing creates a marvelous character in the proper englishmen, Professor Livingston, or whatever his name was, and the Iron Mole part at the beginning is cool.  This is definatley better thought out than 'People That Time Forgot' but McClure was never able to recapture the combination of great story/great acting that it takes to make a great adventure movie with a small budget/cheesy effects.  That is why 'Land that Time Forgot' will forever remain McClures best movie.

726030,3,630391750X,"Fun to watch if you like the cheezy special effects.
After the 'Land that Time Forgot' used mostly miniatures, Amicus decided to try actor's in costumes and the results speak for themselves.

Don't bother looking for any logic here, especially since the movie is based on a story that was written around 100 years ago. Underground people who don't even know about the surface just happen to speak English. Somehow in a very short period of time Peter Cushing's machine manages to get close to the center of the earth while travelling at 78 feet per second!

The acting was decent, even if I despise Peter Cushing in these types of roles. In this one he plays the absent minded professor.
The machine that they used to get to the center of the earth is very cool looking and should have been used more as it is easily the best looking special effect produced by this movie.

Caroline Munro is easily one of the hottest looking brunettes from the era, though she looks just slightly less hot than in 'The Golden Voyage of Sinbad.'

The quality of the blu-ray DVD is pretty good.

There is one thing that bugs me about some of these recent Blu-ray releases. No subtitles or closed captions. There are times when I watch late at night and I use subtitles. They are also helpful if an actor or character isn't speaking clearly or has a thick accent.

726094,5,630391750X,"BOTTOM LINE: If you're of fan of old school sci-fi/fantasy films or just enjoy menacing monsters and fantasy-filled fisticuffs then this movie will be right up your alley. Doug McClure makes for an engaging ""everyman"" hero, Peter Cushing is aces as the befuddled Doctor Perry, and the breathtakingly beautiful presence of oily-breasted, barely-clothed Caroline Munro is a sigh-worthy addition to any adventure film. LOL. Kino-Lorber's Blu-ray release of AT THE EARTH'S CORE is a solid 89 minutes of slam-bang fun. 5 STARS

THE STORY: Victorian era adventurers construct and test a manned underground boring machine which goes off course during its maiden voyage, eventually depositing our two heroes in the deep Earth kingdom of Pellucidar, a fantastical world full of cavemen types who are regularly menaced by bloodthirsty dinosaurian monstrosities. Lording over this underground domain are freakish telepathic pterodactyl beings called the Mehar, and their piggish soldiers, the Saggoths. Will our heroes escape or are they doomed to become slaves of the ruthless Mehar?

THOUGHTS: Nice Blu-ray release of this old school subterranean heroes 'n' monsters saga. Sturdy Doug McClure leads the way as David Innes, a two-fisted American businessman who has spent most of his late father's fortune financing the construction of ""The Iron Mole"" (the above-mentioned rocket-propelled earth tunneler), designed by eccentric Englishman, Dr. Abner Perry, (played with tongue-firmly in check by the always delightful Peter Cushing). Rounding out the cast is the luscious Caroline Munro as Dia, a princess in the subterrestrial world of Pellucidar. This film has the attitude and feel of a 1950's sci-fi flick, and I mean that in the best possible way. It's harmless, swashbuckling-styled fun and very entertaining, in an almost comic-book fashion. Seeing as how the story is adapted from the pen of ""Tarzan"" creator Edgar Rice Burroughs that should come as no surprise. The hero is a simple-but-honest, no-nonsense type: headstrong & pure-hearted, with an unwavering conviction in what's right & wrong. The professor character is a brilliant, well-meaning bumbler who always has a quick comeback and comes to the rescue when you least expect it. The damsel in distress is just... drop-dead gorgeous eye candy. There is more to the film than that, but not much. It's a fine way to spend a rainy Saturday afternoon, plopped on the couch with some popcorn. Younger kids should enjoy the monsters and cavemen action, while the older viewers can marvel in the knowledge that a film this enjoyably silly came out just a year before Star Wars hit the theaters, forever changing the game and almost single-handedly redefining what an effects-heavy film ought to look like.

THE BLU-RAY: Kino-Lorber's Blu-ray release of AT THE EARTH'S CORE looks very nice, indeed. The picture has a moderate-to-razor sharp focus, with only minimal pixelation and occasional dirt & grit. The soundmix is strong & even. The bright, eye-popping color palette fully fills a 16x9 screen. Honestly, this is the best I've ever seen this film look - and I've owned a factory VHS tape, a DVD and now this Blu-ray. Do you already own this movie in an older format, have a Blu-ray player and are mulling over whether or not to double-dip? Well, I can whole-heartedly recommend this Blu-ray release of AT THE EARTH'S CORE as an absolutely worthwhile upgrade. Bonus material includes a couple of newly-lensed interview segments: one with star Caroline Munro that clocks in at just under 30mins and another with director Kevin Conner that's a hair over 22mins. There's also a vintage ""Making of"" featurette included and the original theatrical trailer, too. Lastly, Kino has made the slipcover artwork insert one of those reversible deals, which doubles the fun. A nice touch.",1429142400,3,3830,5.244698205546492

Subotsky produced the two big screen adaptations of the first Doctor adventures starring Peter Cushing (Dr Who and the Daleks, Daleks Invasion Earth 2150 AD) but failed to create a third, despite his continued interest up until his death in 1991. In many ways, ""At the Earth's Core,"" based on the Edgar Rice Burroughs novel, is the closest movie we will ever have to the third installment of Peter Cushing's Doctor. For this reason alone, many people who enjoyed the two Dalek movies should own this one as well. Peter Cushing's character in this film is similar to his character in the Dalek movies, making this a fun addition to your Doctor Who collection (even though is NOT a Doctor Who title).",1425168000,3,767,4.774436090225564
726172,4,630391750X,"No one will ever mistake this film for a cinematic masterpiece, to put it mildly -- but for lazy Saturday afternoon fare, it can't be beat for sheer ridiculous fun. There's a certain innocent, lo-fi charm to this sort of B-movie that can't be recreated today. Certainly the dinosaurs, monsters, and exotic settings could be realized with much greater detail & brilliance with CGI -- but I wonder if such a film would be as enjoyable as one with the cheap rubber suits? Frankly, I doubt it.

So what have we got here? A modest, slightly tongue-in-cheek adaptation of the Edgar Rice Burroughs classic, with Doug McClure delivering a solid heroic lead in keeping with pulp standards, Peter Cushing at his most chirpily eccentric -- ""You can't mesmerize me, I'm British!"" -- and Caroline Munro as the requisite gorgeous, scantily clad damsel in distress. And I have to say that you simply couldn't get someone of Munro's delightful spunkiness & sexiness today. She's not only physically attractive, but she's immensely appealing as a screen presence, with a dazzling smile that could light up the darkest night. In this, she captures the essence of the pulp heroine at her best.

Yes, it's easy to laugh at some of the effects & the obviously low budget. But in a film like this, that's part of the fun. No dark, grim, edgy adolescent angst here! This is Boy's Own Adventure, and all the better for it -- recommended for that reason!",1424908800,,1429,4.758064516129032

Andrew's Blu-ray Review: At the Earth's Core is a British feature film of the adventure, fantasy and science fiction genres. It combines elements of ""hollow earth"" and the ""lost world"" storytelling tropes as well as modern dinosaur fare with just a dash of camp fun. When the film starts the plot is already on its feet and running, so you had better be ready folks. What appears to be a huge auger is constructed and moved by locomotive to a promising mountain, only then do characters appear to answer some desperate questions. The massive contraption is a revolutionary drilling machine and the function tests are about to be conducted, not by a miner or engineer, but by the inventor and financier. What they do encounter is a subterranean world populated by all sorts of fantastic beasts and primitive people. Any place with lava flowing freely is hardly paradise (disclaimer: except Hawaii), but when a race of merciless creatures like the Majars rules over it things are much worse. Oppression and avian tyranny are everything the Victorian Man was against, so the two wayward trailblazers struggle to overthrow the Majars Empire.

At the Earth's Core is the second film adaptation of an Edgar Rice Burroughs novel by the team of director Kevin Connor, producer John Dark, actor Doug McClure and British production house Amicus. It is not part of Burroughs' 'Caprona' book trilogy, on which Connor's other films, The Land that Time Forgot [1975] and The People that Time Forgot [1977] were based, but deals nevertheless with the theme of a lost and hidden world where the protagonists encounter humans and creatures from an ancient time. And you should have guessed it, that something is going to go wrong, overcome by heat and battered unconscious the explorers are carried deep into our planet. Despite almost hitting the centre they never encounter molten rock, it's astounding. For those of us who saw these films as youngsters, they still hold a certain nostalgic appeal that transcends their clumsy monster effects and general silliness, and most of their (many) faults can be blamed on the production teams' trying to do far too much with way with limited means.

Aside from Tarzan, the fantasy/adventure classics of Edgar Rice Burroughs have not fared so well on film. Since so much of Edgar Rice Burroughs' work dates from 75 to 100 years ago, and so many filmmakers, from the likes George Lucas to James Cameron, have been inspired by (some may say begged, borrowed or just plain stole from) him over the years, that when someone tries to do a more-or-less faithful rendition of one of his works.

American TV star Doug McClure was lured to the UK to work in all three of these films, though his presence is drastically reduced in `The People That Time Forgot.' But with the film `The Land that Time Forgot,' must have been so successful enough to warrant another film, and in 1976 saw Doug McClure once again back in a Edgar Rice Burroughs' fantasyland, as realised by the Amicus crew in `At the Earth's Core.'

The story follows the original 1914 novel in very general outline, though much that makes the book special doesn't translate to the screen, alas. The movie opens as British scientist Abner Perry [Peter Cushing] and his former pupil David Innes [Doug McClure] are about to embark on a trial run of their ""Iron Mole,"" a drilling machine devised to explore beneath the planet's crust. Things quickly go awry and the pair eventually arrives in a vast cave world full of weird plants and even weirder beasties. No sooner have David and Perry left their machine then they are set upon by some strange sort of dinosaur-like creature. Fleeing the monster, they are quickly captured by the pig-faced Sagoths, a humanoid henchman race who do the bidding of the mysterious, reptilian Mahars, who hold dominion over the native human population.

The prisoners finally arrive at the Mahar city and are brought before the winged overlords, who seem to communicate with the Sagoths via telepathy. After a period slaving away in the mines with the other captives, David manages to escape through a disused cave tunnel and encounters Ra, a chieftain of one of the human tribes. In time-honoured fashion, the two fight and become fast friends once David rescues Ra from the clutches of a carnivorous plant. Thinking to dissuade David from his plan to free Perry and the rest of the humans from the Mahars' rule, Ra brings him back into the Mahar city to witness their hideous ritual of feasting upon the more comely female captives. This just strengthens David's resolve to bring the various warring human factions together and eliminate the Mahars for once and all. But first, he is reunited with the lovely Dia and must fight Jubal the Ugly One [Michael Crane], the most ferocious warrior in the land, for her hand.

Let's get this right out of the way, even in the mid-70s, this was cheese-tastic stuff. Edgar Rice Burroughs' original tale is a terrific piece of pulp storytelling, full of action, derring-do and a plethora of monsters, both of the traditional dinosaur variety plus all manner of other unique and original creations, such as the nasty Mahars. Not only do the creatures in `At The Earth's Core' not bear any resemblance whatsoever to any sort of dinosaur known to science, they are nearly all portrayed by men in rubber suits. The design of the various monster suits do show some kind of inspired, oddball imagination, but realistic they are not. (Laughable is the word that comes to mind.) Coupled with the entire film taking place on Pinewood sound stages, on cramped jungle or cave sets not greatly more lavish than the average classic Doctor Who serial, and one is left with a general air of goofiness that can't be ignored.

The rest of the cast is decent enough, considering what's required, and the script, by producer Subotsky, is perfectly serviceable for this kind of fare. Director Kevin Connor perhaps wisely keeps the frame tight in on his stars' faces for the most part, which sometimes works in tandem with the cramped feel of the sets to make this feel like a very small lost world, but otherwise does a competent enough job moving the story forward (this clocks in at a brisk 90 minutes). What really lets the side down is the aforementioned poor effects work; it might be unfair to compare this with the marvels of Star Wars which came out a mere year later, as the budget here is surely less than a tenth of other films, but after Star Wars, effects-heavy films would never be the same, and pretty much sounded the death knell for the sort of old-fashioned yet cheap monster mayhem seen here. There's also a number of plot holes and other head-scratching moments (such as how the denizens of Pellucidar manage to speak English, for one . . . and where exactly did Perry get that bow and arrow? for another.) Taken as a proper adaptation of its far superior source, there's no denying that `At the Earth's Core' falls way short of the mark.

Still, the sets, colourful lighting, rubber monsters and (actually quite effective) sound design all work together to give the film a strange, otherworldly atmosphere that kind of works in spite of the budgetary shortcomings, resulting in an almost hallucinatory quality; taken on the level of a kind of trippy 70s fever dream, the film remains pretty diverting stuff. Its goofy fun aimed at 10-year-olds, and if like me and you still have a ghost of that 10-year-old self-hanging around, you might enjoy it too. And, if all else fails, there's always Caroline Munro. Extravagant, colourful and thoroughly preposterous, At the Earth's Core is utterly without pretension but has the exuberant charm of the best of its decade.

Blu-ray Video Quality  This Blu-ray release has been given a 1080p encoded transfer displayed with an aspect ratio of 1.85:1. The colours are very impressive and reveal themselves to be right from the opening credits, as a very bright orange hue is seen in the shots of molten metal and reds and greens also stand out really well. The Pellucidar jungle is shot under pink lights and the foliage is a mix of brown and green. Blacks are inky and contribute to one end of the image's strong contrast. Shooting was shot entirely indoors, and cinematographer Alan Hume uses a shallow depth of field to help hide the walls of legendary Pinewood Studios. This also limits the sharpness to the items in the foreground. In addition to the film grain, minor specks of black and white appear throughout, but despite this, it still does not spoil the enjoyment of this film.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  The audio situation arrives in the form of 2.0 DTS-HD Master Audio Stereo. Composer Mike Vickers predominantly creates electronic music for the score, and it comes through with a good fidelity. The dialogue is exceptionally clear, but unfortunately Peter Cushing's voice suffers the most from dubbing, sounding hollow early on, as if talking into a can at times. The audio elements are balanced well together and present a satisfactory dynamic range, although a high-pitched train whistle gets so loud it distorts, but that's likely a source issue.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Audio Commentary: Commentary by Director Kevin Connor: This has got to be the most unintentionally funny commentary I have ever heard. Whoever was supposed to do the interview director Kevin Connor was unable to make the recording session, so Bill Olsen was the replacement but why he was chosen is totally unclear? He is very knowledgeable about all aspect of film, but obviously hasn't done any research to conduct this conversation. He frustrates Kevin Connor because he doesn't always listen to what he has said and has an oddball sense of humour, making him come across like a stranger straying into the conversation.

On Camera Interview with Actress Caroline Munro [2014] [1080p] [16:9] [28:40] The actress talks about getting the role of Dia and working on this film as well as others like 'The Devil Within Her.' This is a very fascinating interview and this wonderful actress comes over as a very nice lady. Caroline Munro also talks fondly about the director Kevin Connor, who says he was a very nice person to work with.

On Camera Interview with Director Kevin Connor [2014] [1080p] [16:9] [22:00] Kevin Connor talks about his long career in films, and as both an editor and director, and also about working on the film. He also comes across as a very nice person as a director and that goes for all the actors that worked with him on all his films, saying he was really nice to work with.

Feature Documentary: A Special Art: Monsters [1976] [480i] [4:3] [5:42] This very short black-and-white archival piece looks at different aspects of this film, and especially such as what went into creating the monsters.

Original Theatrical Trailer [1976] [1080p] [1:85] [2:52]

Finally, 'At the Earth's Core' is nearly wall-to-wall action, rarely interested in slowing down, possibly out of fear that any break will lose the attention of its young audience. Perhaps it's best to have the movie careening along, processing strange sights at top speed, as `At the Earth's Core' doesn't have the dramatic weight to fully inspect the wonders of Edgar Rice Burroughs's novel. Instead, the feature emphasises monster beat-downs and menacing birds, stuffed with enough acts of daring-do to satisfy as pure camp escapism and if feeling there is nothing to watch on your TV, then put this Blu-ray on and it will take you away on a journey of 89 minutes of glorious escapism fun. Highly Recommended!

726260,5,630391750X,"Just finished watching ""At The Earth's Core"" released by Orion Films.
""At The Earth's Core"" plays great homage to the B-Science Fiction movies of the 1950s and 1960s; yet unlike them, it doesn't quite have the all-out happy ending that you would have expected in this movie.
Movies based on Edgar Rice Burrough's novels enjoyed a brief flowing in the late 1970s after the releases of the highly popular ""The Land The Time Forgot"" and ""The People That Time Forgot.""
So it should come as no surprise the Kevin Connor, who directed both of the aforemetnioned ""Time Forgot"" movies turned his  talents to bring  Burrough's tales of Pellcuidar to the silver screen.
""At The Earth's Core"" stars Peter Cushing, Doug McClure, and the ever lovely and gracious Caroline Munro [yes, I'm still think that was absolutely wonderful of her to personalize her autograph to me on a DVD copy of ""The Golden Voyage of Sinbad - which my good friend Steve Orchard asked her to do] and is serio-comic schlock theater at it's best.
""At The Earth's Core"" simply tells the tale of a hotshot American businessman and his former absent-minded professor - who take a test run on a giantic manned earth borer he finanaced to increase mining returns.
A bit of a sticky-wicky malfunction sends them off course and into the Earth's habital core of Pellucidar where the love Princess Dia - played to perfection by the lovely Caroline Munro.
What follows is classic lost world adventure and where otherly wordly intelligences enslave primitive humans and eat them.
""At The Earth's Core"" has a tear jerker of an ending that cried out for a sequel.  Sadly, one was never made.
Highly Recommended!

726261,4,630391750X,"I collect classic sci-fi films from the 60's on and thus purchased At the Earth's Core as soon as it was available. I was not disappointed. The film is a classic monster/adventure movie from the 70's with a fun script, brilliantly madcap performances from Peter Cushing and others, plus the great 70's cheese you know and love. Watching a guy in a big bird suit stomp around after Peter Cushing is about as good as it gets for this sci-fi lover. Give me the fun old style of this over video game style computer effects any day!

The disc looks glorious, truly. Obviously it's not going to look as crisp as a brand new film but the transfer here is much better than expected with great colors that pop off the screen and a ton of nice detail. There are definitely marks and scratches in places, especially the early footage, but it looks much better than you'd think and rarely has issues. No processing was done as far as I could tell, so you're getting full detail here.

Special features are a fun commentary with the director and a host, plus some nice interviews with the director and the female lead. Considering how many catalog films come out on blu ray with no new features at all I was quite satisfied with what was on the disc. The commentary especially feels like watching the film with a couple old friends, very laid-back and conversational.

If you like cheesy 70's sci-fi anywhere near as much as I do I highly recommend this disc! Let's hope Kino obtain the rights to release this director's other films in the U.S. such as ""The Land that Time Forgot!""",1423180800,25,1568,4.514084507042254

726333,5,630391750X,"What a weird, wonderfully wacky movie!  Released in 1976 before Star Wars changed everything, people expecting well fabricated realistic dinosaurs are doomed to disappointment.  This movie owes a lot to the Godzilla way of making monsters (shove some poor sap in a rubber suit and leave him to stomp around in as menacing a fashion as one can while wearing a silly rubber monster costume).  They weren't trying for realism; they were just hoping to entertain (small tots by the look of those big bulbous monsters).  The story is loosely based on a book by Edgar Rice Burroughs (the Pellucidar series: At the Earth's Core).  One assumes the filmmakers were trying to make this a kid friendly venture.  The plot concerns a rushed experiment that goes horribly awry when Dr. Abner Perry's contraption goes down rather than horizontal.  ""Total power failure!  Oh, how disappointing!""  The aim was to go through a mountain, not under it.  Instead of reaching the other side, they end up in the Earth's core surrounded by hostile creatures and primitive humans.  ""They're so excitable....like all foreigners!""

This film features work by my favorite cinematographer Alan Hume.  The jaunty score is by Mike Vickers.  It has a definite steampunk look with the ""iron mole.""  And it showcases one of the most endearing performances by Peter Cushing (as Dr. Abner Perry).  ""But we came in peace!!!""  Watching the normally staid Peter Cushing doing slapstick is hilarious.  My only complaint is that they lose sight of Cushing far too many times in this movie in favor of Doug McClure running around acting all heroic.  Anyone could have played McClure's role; Cushing was irreplaceable.  I love this movie because it is so impossibly silly.  But yes, the book(s) was better.",1408752000,,1763,5.010344827586207

Even the most recently released John Carter in 2012 was a complete failure because it ignored Burroughs vision, and chose to make a political eco statement instead. This film seemed to go beyond them all to be as bad as it could. From the Godzilla type actor in the rubber suit, to the plastic potted plants it was horrible. More dismaying was the poor light this feature portrayed the great actor Peter Cushing. If you want to watch a classic story made as badly as possible then this is the movie for you.

The tale of slavery, exploitation, and potentially genocidal revolution went right over my head. That and references to a 'master race' (they 'all look alike' don't you know). The Evil Bad Flying Dinosaurs are actually quite creepy as well, what with their telepathic ability to make girls into edible puppets. We also get male bonding, some low level lust from a coy princess playing hard to get (isn't that ever the way?), and gladiatorial combat with what looks like the Evil Bad Flying Dinosaur's pet proto-mammal.

726562,2,630391750X,"This review is of the movie, and the Amazon Prime streaming presentation in particular.

As far as presentation, I give the movie high marks. The picture looked great and the sound was convincing. If this is a secret favorite from the days of your youth, you won't be annoyed at what you see here.

The movie itself is not so great. The creatures, large and small, were embarrassingly pathetic even for the mid-70s. Everything is a rubber costume with almost no flexibility. I can't decide which was worse: the Allosaurus with the parrot head, the Tyranosauri with the minotaur heads, or the levitating pterodactyl people ... I say levitating because those wings certainly did not propel them in the air.

Amazingly, all the human inhabitants of Pelucidar spoke English with broad vocabularies. Sometimes they had stilted ""prehistoric man"" type speech, and sometimes they sounded like talking to your neighbor over the fence. LOL

Caroline Monro had one of her most effective cleavage shows in this movie, to go along with her Sinbad appearance. It was racy for the time, but tame by today's standards.

The plot was formulaic and repetitive, you can easily take an extended bathroom break or a phone call and miss nothing in the story.

There were a lot of B adventure movies I saw as a youngster and still like a lot. I was a big Doug McClure fan. Unfortunately this film just doesn't do it for me still. Cheap costumes, cheap sets, cheap effects, uninspired writing, and barely adequate acting leave this film sorely lacking any modern day appeal.",1350259200,2,1550,4.8522727272727275

726618,4,630391750X,"Let's see, to begin with, these films have almost no extras, apart from their respective trailers and some subtitles.  But since these films are both older than I am, and some of the cast and crew has suffered the prefix ""the late,"" there's little to do about that.

The films themselves:

""War-gods of the deep"" does not quite live up to its name, since there are no gods in it, nor any war.  Instead of being in the vein of say, ""Warlords of Atlantis,"" it instead runs a lot like a a hybrid sixties Disney comedy / episode of ""Stargate SG 1,"" with the first 10-20 minutes seeming lifted straight out of a garden variety Disney film, and the rest from ""SG-1.""  It is sort of saved by some hammy performances, mostly by Vincent Price, and by generally looking really odd.  I don't know why they dragged Edgar Allan Poe into this.  It is also rather lacking in the lava-department compared to the other film on the disc:

""At the Earths core"" is what passed for a special effects movie in the mid seventies, and is as such, a fairly good one.  Sure the entire monster action is guys in rubber suits, but somehow those are oddly more satisfying, perhaps because one believes that a man in a monster suit can reach out and touch something, while a CGI graph can't.  That, and they are funnier.  This is good old fashion Sci-fi with a weirdo scientist and his trusty sidekick riding their giant drill into another world.  The film actually opens up with that, and pretty much continues with action with very little leeway to get more popcorn unless one pauses it.  It has more monsters than any film I have recently seen; flower monsters, flying monsters, fire-breathing monsters... and more.  I ran out of fingers to count them on.  The film also has more lava than you can safely shake a stick at.  With all those monsters and all that lava, there is no time tacked on romances or pseudo-philosophizing.

In short, it's a great movie, marred only by me not being 12 years old when I saw it.

726622,3,630391750X,"Based on an Edgar Allan Poe poem, ""War Gods of the Deep"" is the superior of this double feature.  Vincent Price gives a great performance (as always); he is an evil captain who is determined to prevent a volcano from erupting and destroying the ancient, underwater city that he and his crewman have commandeered.  He has developed a friendship with gill men who resemble the Creature from the Black Lagoon.  Excellent performances are given from all especially Tab Hunter and David Tomlinson who starred in Walt Disney's ""Mary Poppins"" and ""Bedknobs and Broomsticks.""  Tomlinson and his silly pet hen, Herbert, provide great comic relief and were a delight to watch.

  Unfortunately, the print had some defects; there were a few lines and tears.  Overall it was a beautiful film.  The underwater fight scenes could have been made to appear more realistic.  There was poor continuity between the stuntmen who fought and the actual actors who merely stood and posed when close ups of their faces were needed.

  ""At the Earth's Core"" was a mediocre adaptation of Edgar Rice Burroughs' best-selling novel of the same title.  This time, horror icon Peter Cushing was one of the star performers, but his scenes were few and he was depicted as an feeble, bumbling scientist.  The special effects were atrociously outdated; they were no more advanced than those of ""King Kong"" of 1933.

  The monsters at the earth's core must be the missing links between dinosaurs and the birds in which they were suppose to have evolved.  They appear to be dinosaurs bred with the Muppets such as Big Bird, Ernie, and the Cookie Monster.  The inferior special effects overwhelmed the plot.  Most memorable scene:  the Mahar feeding frenzy on the beautiful captive maidens.  Delicious, but not as frightening as when I first saw it as a young adult.

  Overall, this double feature is not on the same level as others where Vincent Price was the headliner.  I bought it solely because Price was in it.  This double feature is recommended for fans of Vince Price, gothic horror, or underwater Captain Nemo style classics.  ""Mysterious Island"" was so much better than either film.  Incidentally, Caroline Munro is gorgeous in ""At the Earth's Core"" (and every other movie she stars in) but that is not enough to warrant buying this DVD.",1216166400,,2311,4.9119170984455955
726623,2,630391750X,"Double ouch!!

""War Gods of the Deep"" is one of Vincent Price's weakest films, and he appears disinterested throughout.  Tab Hunter is unbearably stiff, and the ""comic relief"" provided by David Tomlinson and a chicken isn't funny in the slightest.  Shoddy special effects and a shoddier plotline drag this movie way, way down (to the bottom of the sea, shall we say?).

""At the Earth's Core"" manages to sink even lower.  Doug McClure plays his role over the top, and the ""comic relief"" provided by a buffoonish Peter Cushing isn't funny either.  The monsters in this film are so phony that they insult the intelligence of the viewer, even for the low standards of the 1970s.  An awful plotline with an absurd romance thrown in -- there's nothing of merit to this film except unintended laughs at how bad it is.

The DVD gets two stars as it was cheap entertainment and allows Vincent Price fans to see one of his more obscure (and deservedly so) films.",1212710400,2,952,4.658682634730539
726703,4,630391750X,"Edgar Rice Burroughs' novel AT THE EARTH'S CORE was his first novel in the Pellucidar Series.  Pellucidar was the hollow earth where the adventures took place.

The 1976 film adaptation of this novel by Pinewood Studios added to the growing movie vault based on Burroughs' novels.

Perhaps, the most delightful character is Professor Abner Perry, the engineer, geologist, and paleontologist. Peter Cushing's Perry is absolute entertainment.  It would be worth one's time just to watch this performance with those famous British one liners tossed in for good measure.

Perhaps, his most quoted line is -""You cannot mesmerized me. I'm British.""

Doug McClure is at top form as American David Innes, the heir to a great mining fortune, who is more interested in the ladies than he is about his financial investment in Perry's subterranean prospector aka ""the iron mole"".

The iron mole is a wonderful machine with a dandy control room.  The special effects and property crew had fun with this device.

Caroline Munro's Princess Dia is the love interest for David Innes.  He had to travel to inner earth to find his true love.  She is definitely a rare treasure.

Of course, the story needs a villain, and this villain is Hooja the Sly One who has designs on Princess Dia. He is definitely a crafty fellow.

The evil empire of the story is located at Phutra City.  There, the Mahars, female giant birds, who must have escaped from a Japanese movie set, rule with mind control and fear.  The brainless Sagoths are the henchmen of the Mahars.  The Sagoths go into the tropical paradise to round up the humans from various unconferated tribes for their vast building projects.  Also, the Mahars has this nasty habit of eating human females.

David Innes has to convince the various tribal leaders to work together to defeat the Mahars.  Ra, the native hero in this movie, joins his voice in this chorus of unity in order to end human slavery to the evil Mahars and free Pellucidar.

The final battle has some gems as well as heroics.  Special effects are not too bad considering the time period.

This film is worth your ninety minutes if you have a definite interest in this genre. Also, you should read the book as well as the whole Pellucidar novel series.",1206835200,4,2252,4.794805194805194
726704,3,630391750X,"Before Luke Skywalker, there was Doug McClure... His John Dark-Kevin Connor fantasy adventures were a mainstay of Summer holiday movies in the days before Star Wars: they weren't masterpieces, they didn't boast state-of-the-art special effects, but they were exactly what an audience of kids wanted from a film back in the mid 70s.

At the Earth's Core is highly enjoyable, catching just the right tone for the appropriately named Burroughs' pulp adventure about Victorian inventor Peter Cushing and the inevitable Doug McClure ending up in the underground world of Pelucidar and battling its evil telepathic fighting dinosaurs. This time the puppets are gone in favor of men in monster suits, which is a lot more fun if you're willing to suspend your disbelief, and if you're not there's always Caroline Munro's cleavage to look at. Aside from what may well be Peter Cushing's worst performance, an irritating but dottier rehash of his movie Dr Who (""You can't mesmerize me, I'm British!""), it's easily the best of the John Dark-Kevin Connor-Doug McClure fantasy adventures, surprisingly well directed and boasting an atmospheric use of color.

Vincent Price and his immortal band of smugglers living in a somewhat mislocated Babylonian city under the Cornish stretch of the English Channel didn't have the same effect this time, but Jacques Tourneur's vaguely Poe-inspired subterranean/underwater adventure is still a fun romp thanks to superb production design which makes the film look ten times more expensive than it probably was and great Scope photography with a good use of color from Zulu's Stephen Dade. It's not a masterpiece, but it's a brisk and enjoyable period adventure with more than a passing nod to both Journey to the Center of the Earth and 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea. Plus it has David Tomlinson sharing a diving suit with a chicken while pursued by gill men, and not many films can say that.

Aside from a couple of moments of negative damage the 2.35:1 widescreen transfer is surprisingly good. The only extra is the US theatrical trailer.

At the Earth's Core is an inspired companion piece, catching just the right tone for the appropriately named Burroughs' pulp adventure about Victorian inventor Peter Cushing and the inevitable Doug McClure ending up in the underground world of Pelucidar and battling its evil telepathic fighting dinosaurs.

726706,3,630391750X,"In the late 1970s Doug McClure made a career out of movies like this. Starting with THE LAND THAT TIME FORGOT in 1975 he managed to come out with one such movie a year until WARLORDS OF ATLANTIS in 1978 (curiously titled on the Amazon catalog as WARLORDS OF THE DEEP). And this effort is the second in the ""series"" (the sequel to LAND, THE PEOPLE THAT TIME FORGOT was a 1977 release).

Essentially they follow much the same formula, in essence a group of people from a past era discover an unexplored realm, mingle with an undiscovered people  and battle some of the cheesiest monsters ever committed to celluloid.

In this effort McClure plays David Innes, an American who agrees to back a Victorian scientist (played wonderfully by horror veteran Peter Cushing) in his experiment to bore into the side of a mountain in Wales. Sounds simple enough, except they misjudge the power of their contraption (the Iron Mole) and end up at the center of the Earth among a group of people enslaved by giant birds.

The mere physics aside this is a pure popcorn  B-movie, but it is a lot of fun too. I'm a sucker for center of the earth movies, whether that be the classic James Mason version of JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH to the 2003 thriller THE CORE. So, perhaps it should be no small surprise that I have a fondness for this movie.

Of course there's also the power of nostalgia. I never saw this movie in the theater (though I did catch WARLORDS OF ATLANTIS there), but I saw it when it arrived on television. I must have been about 10 years old. In other words - I was too young to care about the physics that tell us that the center of the earth is pure molten, swirling lava. And too young to care that the giant birds were clearly just people in giant costumes, but not too young to notice that Caroline Munro was incredibly attractive. It's not surprising that the next year she would be appearing as a femme fatale in the James Bond movie THE SPY WHO LOVED ME.

Yes, Munro is a real attraction for this movie, but I also enjoyed the performances of Cushing and McClure in what is 90 minutes of 1970s camp.  Overall it's worth a spin and the DVD includes the original theatrical trailer.",1146096000,8,2195,4.415841584158416

Doug McClure is adventurer David Innes, who accompanies Dr. Abner Perry (Peter Cushing) on a journey into the earth's core.  Once they pair reaches the interior of the earth, they discover that everyone speaks English, except for the telepathic Meyhas, who communicate telepathically to the accompaniment of sound effects that clue you in to what is happening.

Suitable to a movie of this type, one of the people that David and Dr. Perry discover is Princess Dia (Caroline Munro, who also appeared in the James Bond movie ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" the year after this movie was released, both Dr. Phibes movies, and ""The Golden Voyage of Sinbad,"" among others).  Princess Dia is suitably undressed for the occasion, providing incentive for David and Dr. Perry to upset a status quo that appears to have existing for thousands of years.

In addition to the Meyhas, which are bird-like lizards, are other critters that appear to have some vague connection to dinosaurs, or perhaps I would be more accurate in saying that many of the creatures have vague connections to dinosaurs.  Other creatures appear to be completely fictional.  The environment seems to be a jungle, in a movie set sort of way.

This movie is a genuine cheese-fest, and yet it is enjoyable if you disconnect it from Edgar Rice Burrough's original story and watch with your brain mostly disconnected.  Or you could make fun of it as you watch it (which is what I tend to do).  If you have enjoyed other movies filmed about the same time using a similar style, ""The Land That Time Forgot (1975)"" and ""The People That Time Forgot (1977),"" this one will be a must-have for your collection.",1135814400,2,1715,4.802721088435374
726709,3,630391750X,"This Beneath-The-Surface themed double feature from MGM is pretty mediocre.  Neither film is really bad, but neither are anything to write home about either.  War Gods Of The Deep starts things off.  Basically Tab Hunter(who looks like an early prototype for Casper Van Dien) and David Tomlinson(with a pet chicken in a picnic basket) go searching for Susan Hart, who has vanished from her bedroom.  Finding that old reliable secret passage behind the bookshelf they find themselves going deeper and deeper into a cave til they end up in a city beneath the sea ruled by Vincent Price.  Price kidnapped the girl coz she looks like his late wife(how's that for original?) and I'm assuming he wants to get jiggy with her.  He's also stressed coz an underwater volcano is a ticking timebomb that will destroy his beloved city.  Price sees our heroes as meddling pains in the ass, so he decides to execute them though he doesn't keep them very well guarded coz they seem to just venture out whenever they want to.  The first hour's a bunch of scenes of Price talking about his civilization and such.  Finally are heroes are let out into the ocean with scuba gear and are hunted by Price's soldiers as well as the gill men that lurk around the city.  These horrifying gill men are nothing more than guys in torn clothes and obvious rubber masks.  The Creature From The Black Lagoon is much more believable.  Price does alright with what he's given.  He's always a decent villian even if the movie isn't all that decent.  Hunter is typical tough guy and Tomlinson and his rooster are the comic relief characters.  Not bad but far from good.  Actually, kinda boring.  The second feature, At The Earth's Core, is the better of the two, but that's not saying much.  It's another collaboration between director Kevin Connor and star Doug McClure(The first being The Land That Time Forgot).  McClure and Peter Cushing have one of those neato machines with the giant drill on the front that allows you to burrow through the earth.  Well, somewhere in the middle, they get stuck and find themselves in a prehistoric kind of world very similar to the ""Before Time"" films.  The center of the earth is pretty much a jungle with a red/pink sky and a cave.  Lots of red lighting and lots of lava in this film.  The primitive humans(that speak english) are slaves to evil pterodactyl men who control an army of neanderthal type goons(who have a bizarre way of speaking.  You know the sound it makes when you are listening to a cd and you hit the FF button?).  The visuals and monsters in this movie are at about Godzilla level.  The arrival of the badazz McClure sparks a slave revolt and soon everyone's had it up to here with these pterodactyl schmucks.  It may sound like cheesy B movie fun, and it is, but it's also a bit more boring than it should be.  Cushing is the comic relief this time as an absent minded english scientist.  He's got that ""Oh, My!"", ""Oh, Dear!"" reaction to everything.  A very far cry from his Frankenstein portrayal for sure.  Caroline Munro is there just to look hot like she always does.  Not bad if you're a fan of rubber monsters and lava.  Though I'm sure Edgar Rice Burroughs would want the negatives burned if he saw it.

Sure, the monster special effects technology is not comparable with Jurassic Park, but keep in mind that this movie was made in the 1970's!  Doug McClure and Peter Cushing made a very good team in this action-packed adventure film!  The movie starts out in the Victorian age as scientist; Dr. Abner Perry (Peter Cushing) and his Geologic Engineering student; David Innes (Doug McClure) are embarking on a mission to test a manned underground drilling machine called ""The Iron Mole"".  When the ""Iron mole"" goes off-course, the teacher and student duo end up in a place ""like nothing on Earth"", as stated by David Innes.
  David and Dr. Perry end up getting captured and enslaved with humans, by Sagaths, the soldiers for the Majars who rule in the city of Pellucidar.
  After finding a way to escape from the caves of the Sagaths, David, aided by a new human friend; Rah, returns to free the slaves and rescue Dr. Perry.  The human tribes unite and Dr. Perry trains the tribesman on the skills of Archery, in order to revolt against the Majars and Sagaths, and destroy them.
  I loved the comradery between David and Dr. Perry, and the protective nature that David showed for the doctor when they were being roughly treated by the Sagaths and all through the movie.  David even, helped physically hold the doctor upright, on the long trip into the caves as they were being pulled along on a long chain of human captives, saying ""Come on doc,...it can't be much further"".  David is a real gentleman, and he also was very courageous and protective for the woman he fell in love with, Princess Dia.  He even fought for her protection against ugly men who attempted to ""man handle"" her!
  The movie was filled with humor that may have been unintentional, by the ""air-headed"" character of Dr. Perry, and the ""serious natured character"" of David Innes.  The antics of Doug McClure and Peter Cushing in this film, for example, when they were being chased by a giant ""eagle-looking"" bird, after crash landing at the earth's core, was comparable to the antics of the ""Three Stooges"".  I couldn't help but laugh!  I enjoyed this movie so much, I watch it frequently!  It seems that I pick up on things that I did not previously notice before, the more times that I watch it!  A fun and entertaining movie overall!  Andrea Lynn Burcham",1051401600,5,2410,4.7040572792362765

Sorry, I can't help it, but watching this one, and more like it(also recommended: THE PEOPLE THAT TIME FORGOT and HUMANOIDS FROM THE DEEP for more laughfests!) is funnier than any so-called comedy these days! Peter Cushing is Dr Abner Perry, a mad Victorian scientist who invents the Iron Mole, a steam-powered drilling machine(?!) financed by David Innes, a token American played by Doug McClure, a mainstay of 1970s B-monster-flix. When they get lost drilling they wind up, quite literally, at the earth's core and encounter telepathic dinosaurs with lions' tails(honestly), rock bridges over lava flow which cavemen cross with bare feet, an exploding fire-breathing toad . . . and Caroline Munro is on hand as Princess Dia. Basically our heroes have to help the cavemen defeat the Majar beasts(telepathic dinos) and a race of apemen which resemble cast-offs who failed the auditions for Planet of The Apes!
Cushing absolutely revels in his role as Dr Perry. Throughout his movie career, he made all kinds of weird and wonderfully amusing horror flicks and even played the big-screen incarnation of Dr Who in two Brit productions. He knows it, and in this one he can't help but act tongue-in-cheek, which works and is fun to watch.
The SFX are truly Godzilla-style in execution. We get close-ups of men in rubber suits that make them look bigger, Majar creatures on wires(you can see them), exploding mushrooms, a killer plant made from paintbrushes and a pink lava sky! 'This cannot be the Rhondda Valley!' Mr Cushing exclaims. And later on, he asserts to the creatures: 'You cannot mesmerise me, I'm British!' Great stuff!
Oh, and Caroline Munro, who made a great Bond villainness in THE SPY WHO LOVED ME a year later, looks delicious in a loincloth bikini. So, overall, if you love this sort of thing to poke fun at, you can't go far wrong. I get a strange satisfaction out of watching bad movies at times, and this is one of my cheesiest entries in my list of 'guilty pleasure' flix.

726771,3,630391750X,"""At the Earth's Core"" is the middle of a trio of films based on novels by Edgar Rice Burroughs.  This 1976 film comes from the Pellucidar series, while the other two were based on a pair of novels from a trilogy on ""The Land That Time Forgot.""  This only sounds confusing, especially since all three films were directed by Kevin Connor and stared Doug McClure.  Why they did not turn to ERB's John Carter of Mars series is beyond me, but the Pellucidar series, about a land at the earth's core (hence the title) was a decent series.  Unfortunately, the film has as many failings as he does assets.
The story starts with Victorian inventor Dr. Abner Perry (Peter Cushing) whose invention the ""Iron Mole"" has been bankrolled by American David Innes (McClure) to drill into the earth and open up all sorts of wonderful mining opportunities.  Unfortunately the vehicle, with its rather lush intererior, has some problems turning and takes Perry and Innes down, down, to their apparent deaths.  But then it breaks through into the land of Pellucidar, complete a lava sky for illumination (this is science fiction with the accent on the fiction, so be like Abner and David and go along for the ride).
The performances are fine, although while you suspect that from Cushing it is rather surprising from McClure, but the actor was finding his niche in these films.  Add to the equation Princess Dia played by Caroline Munro (she was Victoria Phibes in the Dr. Phibes movies and followed this film as a Bond girl in ""The Spy Who Loved Me"") and the human beings are fine.  It is the cheesy monsters and special effects that drag this film down.  Too bad because Burroughs had come up with this sentient race of psychic pterodactyls, the Meyhas, who enslave the humans of Pellucidar for food.  Of course the bad dinosaurs capture our heroes who them have to free themselves and every other human being in Pellcuidar (and do it all in 89 minutes).  If the Meyhas were not so awful then this film might be halfway decent, but it is not even a close call.  ERB deserved beter.  If you check out one of these films, then do ""The Land That Time Forgot,"" because it is the best of the bunch.",1044316800,,2174,4.58656330749354
726772,5,630391750X,"This is one of the best films of all time, I saw it for the first time when I was very young and it blew my mind. I has lost none of its charm over the years...the rubber monster suits are laughable. The Mahars, although they look like toys you'd find at the bottom of cereal boxes, they are still frightening. Doug Mclure excels as the adventurer and Peter Cushing as the doddering Professor Parry borders on insanity. Caroline Munro is as gorgeous as ever but Cy Grant steals the show as Ra, the token black guy sidekick. Although you can see the film isn't all that it still succeeds in taking you to another world with the chattering Sagoths, pink sky and weird music.
  If ever the world's been evil to you just stick this in your DVD player and live an another world. Only comlaint I can make is the menus, which are a bit minimalist.",1038441600,,840,4.310126582278481
726773,4,630391750X,"I sympathize with Burrough's fans who wished for a more serious treatment of their beloved author's work, but they need to take the film for what it is.  It is clear that the actors were having a great time making it, Cushing is great in an out-of-character role, Caroline Munroe is delicious, the Mahars are hilarious (like kids in big rubber parrot suits flapping their arms while hanging by their necks!) as are the afro-ed natives idiotically dancing around in celebration, and when the fire-breathing toad fell off the cliff and exploded, we were howling in stitches and had to replay that scene again and again.  Add to this a fast-paced, quirky directorial style and Doug McLure and you have a ""B"" classic.  For those of you who just don't get it, go out and develop a personality, then you might be able to let yourself go and enjoy.",1035590400,,841,4.630872483221476
726774,3,630391750X,"AT THE EARTH'S CORE (based on a story by Edgar Rice Burroughs) never quite achieves good movie status but you have to give it credit for trying. Thankfully the film is set in motion the minute the credit sequence ends. Cushing and McClure (the latter shamefully getting top billing) are set to do a test run with their ""iron mole"", a great looking giant drill. Only minutes after their journey begins the two men are knocked out. Shortly after waking the mole has a power failure and the two men find themselves AT THE EARTH'S CORE.
For the uninitiated the Earth's core is full of giant plastic plants, bird beaked monsters, a tribe of human slaves (that speak English), some bizarre pasty faced creatures that serve a strange race of hypnotic pterodactyls. The core is bathed in pink light (which eminates from the magma above). At first the color scheme is quite neat but after awhile it becomes a nauseating experience.
It is of course Cushing and McClure's job to end the pterodactyls reign and free the humans, especially the most attractive human, the scantily clad Caroline Munro.
Munro sports an outfit similar to the ones she wore in The Golden Voyage Of Sinbad (One wonders if such races would ever be saved if it weren't for beautiful women with sweaty cleavage). Her character, Dia, is an enslaved queen looking for the right man. McClure steps up to the plate but doesn't follow through with the native's customs and nearly loses Dia. Cushing later informs the dullard to be ""forceful."" McClure is clearly bothered by taking on such a masculine role at first but he gets into it quickly enough after Dia shows her submissive approval.
The humans manage to destroy their evil rulers and eventually Cushing and McClure return to Earth's surface (one of the film's intentionally funnier moments).
Cushing is most endearing as a wacky British scientist. He adds a level of touching humor and professionalism not usually found in such a picture. McClure is a fine enough actor but he annoyed me to no end. I am not familiar with his career so I am quite surprised to see such unappealing person as the star of this film.
The truth is the special effects are the star of the picture. Being a fan of non-CGI effects it is always a pleasure to see a film like this. That said, some of the effects are laughably bad. A particular standout is when a bird beaked dinosaur eats a man. The man is clearly a stuffed dummy. Surprisingly the camera lingers on the hysterical carnage for some time.
The DVD is part of MGM's impressive budget priced Midnight Movies series. The enhanced widescreen picture is excellent. The source print is clean and vibrant (almost too much so). The film's keyboard soundtrack sounds very John Carpenterish. The mono sound is strong. The DVD also includes a theatrical trailer which is in fine shape.",1017792000,12,2829,4.740365111561866
726775,5,630391750X,"This movie is a great classic sci-fi movie. Today's computer generated effects can hold nothing to this very creative and entertaining movie. They created a whole new world that was completely orginal and the story as well as the charters are very enjoyable. This movie has class and flair and even the music is enjoyable and fun. If you don't like this movie I questioned your respect for creative and fun movie making. I highly recommend this movie to all of those who enjoy sci-fi and just plain family fun kind of people.  Try the other movies is this set, they include, the people that time forgot, the land that time forgot, and Warlords of Atlantis. This last movie is almost impossible to get the only copies I could get were generic copies. I wish the Amazon could get this movie in VHS or even better DVD.",1016150400,,815,4.54421768707483
726776,5,630391750X,"Hey! Cheesy and low-budget as heck,this drive-in movie from 1976 is nonetheless a lotta fun! I can't help comparing it to Sid and Marty Krofft's saturday morning shows of the early 70s,especialy LAND OF THE LOST.VERY entertaning!",1013817600,,229,5.216216216216216
726777,2,630391750X,"Though modestly entertaining, this movie isn't nearly as cool as I remember my teenage self thinking it was when it came out.  And I think the reviewer from Brentwood Bay, Canada is onto something: several scenes looked suspiciously cropped (sometimes on the sides, sometimes on the top and bottom) for a true widescreen print.  Some upshots: the print is otherwise in good shape, with rich colors; the drilling machine is still a neat thing to behold; and although some of the monsters' costumes aren't the best, the optical effects that integrate the monsters into the same shots with the actors (and make a normal-sized guy in a monster suit appear to be fifteen feet tall) are polished and work quite well.  So, there's enough here for genre fans to enjoy, as long as one doesn't expect too much.  Also fun to think about: Peter Cushing probably filmed ""Star Wars"" right after he made this movie.  Think of the man's versatility; his sinister Grand Moff Tarkin character in ""Star Wars"" is nothing like the scatterbrained professor-type he plays here, yet he pulled off both parts beautifully.",1007510400,5,1096,4.902702702702703
726778,1,630391750X,"This ridiculous adaptation of Edgar Rice Burroughs' straight-faced novel was probably not even meant to be taken seriously, but that is no excuse for its extreme badness.  Two scientists (Peter Cushing and Doug McClure) pilot a giant drilling machine which goes off-course and winds up in a strange land in Earth's interior.  In the original novel, the inner world of Pellucidar has no ""time"" as we understand it, because there are no astronomical events to measure the passage of time.  Needless to say, there is no such interesting idea in the film version.  Cushing, usually a fine actor, is embarassing to watch as a dotty old scientist with a ""funny"" vocal delivery which, in one scene, he forgets to do!  (I guess the director didn't notice.)  The inner world looks basically like a cheap amusement park ride, complete with highly unconvincing rubber monsters.  Our intrepid heroes go thru the usual dangerous situations, all of which lack excitement.  They return to the surface by popping up in front of the White House, causing two comic policemen to run around frantically.  It's supposed to be funny, I guess.",983664000,6,1120,4.978494623655914

7854925,4,630391750X,"Good old fashion adventure fantasy from Amicus Productions, set in the Victorian era.  These were the type of movies one loved as a child growing up in the 1970s.  Sure, some of the special effects won't measure up to today's standards, but it has a certain charm, that some CGI fests sort of lack.

This was Doug McClure's second of four British monster features he would make during this period and was always his likeable self.  Peter Cushing is rather unusual in this one, playing more of a Lionel Jefferies type, rather than Peter Cushing!.  And of course, anytime you have the lovely Caroline Munro in anything, it was always worth the watch!",1519084800,,648,4.699115044247788
7854926,2,630391750X,"At the Earths Core,"" based on a novel by Edgar Rice Burroughs, stars Doug McClure as businessman and engineer David Innes whose old professor, Dr. Abner Perry (Peter Cushing), has recently talked him into financing his latest invention. The new machine, referred to by David as the Iron Mole, is a giant manned drill, capable of boring through solid rock at a rate of 78 feet per minutes.

On a trial run, the Iron Mole works much faster than anticipated and becomes uncontrollable, going way off course. Soon, Perry and Innes are deep enough to feel the heat of the magma below the Earths crust. Both men are soon overcome by the intense heat, but are revived when the temperature once again changes dramatically. The Iron Mole is practically at the center of the Earth where it is frigid.

Once the men reach the Earths core, they encounter countless obstacles, most notably a lost prehistoric world, peopled by intelligent, telepathic creatures called Meihars. Their soldiers are called Sagoths, and they are periodically sent to round up cave-dwelling humans to serve as slave labor in their massive city.

The major drawback of At the Earths Core is its dreadful, though ambitious special effects. Monsters are rubber-suited, there are oozing lava flows, sets are not at all convincing, and the acting is weak. The Victorian setting is reminiscent of The Time Machine. But on a certain level  camp  the film is entertaining because of its sheer silliness. Caroline Munro is on hand for eye candy value as cave princess Dia, whose primary role is running around screaming from one life-threatening danger after another.

Special features on the widescreen DVD release includes camera interviews with star Caroline Munro and director Kevin Connor, audio commentary with director Connor, and the original theatrical trailer. The film is also available in a Blu-ray edition.",1517961600,,1875,5.071428571428571

Another fun cheese fest from the Land That Time Forgot people, this time based on Edgar Rice Burroughs first Pellucidar noveladapted by Milton SubotskyThe story has adventurer David Innes (Doug McClure) and his friend, Professor Abner Perry (the legendary Peter Cushing) test driving a deep earth drilling machine and ending up in a bizarre world at the center of the planet. While there, they battle strange creatures, tyrannical bird men and Innes finds love with the beautiful cave girl Dia (Hammer film honey Caroline Munro). Will they get home alive? will David want to, with his Earths core cutie now at his side?

The effects are quite cheesy with its styrofoam sets and rubber monsters, but free from traditional dinosaur design, the critters are quite weird and the landscape is quite psychedelic. Director Kevin Connor (Land That Time Forgot, Motel Hell) doesnt take things too seriously and keeps the flick moving at a fast pace. His cast play their roles straightthough Cushing is delightfully over the topbut do seem to be having fun and so do we. Add some beers and both Land and People That Time Forgot and you're good to go with a fun Saturday night of rubber creatures and cave girl cuties.",1515801600,,1425,4.96234309623431
