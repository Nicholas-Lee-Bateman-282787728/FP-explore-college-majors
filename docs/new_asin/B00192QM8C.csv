It was downright dumb at times, actually. When you give trite dialogue to barely competent actors though, you can't expect much more. First off, there was no chemistry between the lead actor and actress. He simply was not capable of carrying this movie. The drug dealers were also not convincing at all. With the exception of the actor who played Angel (and his crew). He was terrific, but I'm too lazy at the moment to look up his name. Sorry. Too clean cut and not believable in the scenes we're being asked to deem credible. Jacob Reynolds turned in an incredible performance though. By saying little and giving these haunting looks, he portrays a convincing attitude and persona that's very unnerving. Nina Fehren was absolutely gorgeous too, of course. Even crying with blood on her face. These two actors alone saved this from getting a 2 star review. Some good shots of the inner city too added a nice element of despair and degradation. People who like the films of Harmony Korine will enjoy this movie very much, in my opinion. The ending was a predictable, convoluted mess. I did make it through the entire movie though. That alone is worth something these days. Not worth the cost of shipping.",1409270400,,1364,4.735294117647059
8271652,3,B00192QM8C,"Lee Krieger has made a memorable freshman film attempt with December Ends. It is movies like this that can help motivate those indie film makers into doing what it takes to make something people will believe.

The story centers on a young man's attempt to make his existence while coping with the loss of mom and sharing space with a defunct dad. Through the connections of a trusted family member he decides to engage in drug dealing to pay the bills. The story develops nicely into a believable mix of him finding love but dealing with the environment that surrounds him and his love interest. His affectionate eye unfortunately has fallen upon his drug-addicted boss' girlfriend (played by Alex Thayer). The lead actor, Josh Janowicz, is creating for himself a solid resume/CV - Chumscrubber is an awesome film and On the Doll is scoring better as it gets noticed. Thayer has a captivating screen presence with those glacier eyes of hers.

I would recommend this dark city piece for those looking to sit with a tense indie film that keeps you involved. The drug use can get gratuitous and the language too extensive, but I suppose it helps set up that Scarface style ending.",1215388800,3,1177,4.764705882352941
