8684002,4,B00OKQX92Q,"King Jeong Jo, the 22nd ruler of the Chosun Dynasty, survived much tragedy on the way to the throne and still faced much opposition even after succeeding his grandfather. His father, the crown prince, was starved to death in a box upon the order of his grandfather, a victim of vicious fights between opposing political factions. Even after he ascended to the throne, he still had to contend with powerful lords who contributed to his father's death. The movie deals with a fictionalized account of an infamous assassination attempt. Set over the course of a day and night, the movie captures the tension as the isolated king deals with various opponents, including his 'grandmother', who was the second wife of his grandfather and only seven years older than himself. Recommended for historical movie buffs.",1436400000,,808,5.037313432835821
8684003,5,B00OKQX92Q,"A brooding and dark atmosphere for this royal story. Hyun Bin was wonderful in his kingly role. The story told in a good pace, production design was visually engaging though many scenes were in the dark. Movie ended too soon, would have liked it to be longer.",1421280000,,259,4.531914893617022
