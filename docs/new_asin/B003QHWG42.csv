8402315,2,B003QHWG42,"I ordered this disc because I didn't know much about the real Meryl Streep. I wonder if I know anything more since this bio has some many inaccurate points:
1) The succession of films is off (eg: MAMA MIA was not followed with JULIE AND JULIA (which the narrator calls JULIA AND JULIA), but was followed with the film DOUBT. Other successions are wrong: Woody Allen did not do MANHATTAN after JULIA; MANHATTAN was after THE DEER HUNTER, not before it.
2) SOPHIE'S CHOICE was never nominated for best film. The nominees were: E.T.; Gandhi, Missing, Tootsie and The Verdict.
3) Meryl was not nominated for Best Actress for ADAPTATION; She was nominated for supporting actress.
4) She was not nominated for supporting actress for THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA; She was nominated for lead actress.
5) ??? Since these are inaccurate, I wonder how many more are. Eg: did she really replace Madonna in MUSIC OF THE HEART or it this wrong too?
It gets me sick when I know more that the professional who is supposed to be the expert? Watch with caution.....!",1378512000,3,1041,4.663043478260869
