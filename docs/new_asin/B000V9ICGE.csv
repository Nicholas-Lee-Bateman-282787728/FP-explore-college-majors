8217385,5,B000V9ICGE,"I purchased this volume specifically, as opposed to the other specials because David Soul was a guest singer on this - I wasn't disappointed. The special was shot on location in Hawaii and the Captain and Tennille were shown in various spots on the island and gave brief histories of different landmarks. Although this special was very different to their typical variety show, it was a nice change. Hawaii is beautiful and at the end of the show, all of the guest are together singing with Toni and separately, including Kenny Rogers. Toni does a great ""Back To The Island"" also. If you are a fan, this is a great way to remember the 70's and how popular the variety shows were.",1197504000,3,678,4.565573770491803
