I had the opportunity to watch it thanks to a friend of mine, and the story is nothing short of spectacular. The writing, acting, and style chosen to tell the story are all sublime and I... I am at a loss for words. While it is certainly a tearjerker, it isn't needlessly heart-wrenching like many other movies and stories I have read/seen. While i am the cynical type who raises an eyebrow or just nods along when stories are described as timeless or transcending culture/borders, this statement is absolutely true of this film. I hope that one day there will be an international release, because if any movie deserved one it would be Rainbow Song.

P.S. Potential buyers from U.S. and Europe take note: This product is only available as a Region 3 (SE Asia, etc.) DVD. I hope this changes.",1374969600,,866,4.587096774193548
