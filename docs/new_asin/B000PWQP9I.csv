2828599,4,B000PWQP9I,"The Black Cat, directed by Stuart Gordon and written by Dennis Paoli & Stuart Gordon, features the great Edgar Allen Poe (Jeffrey Combs), out of literary inspiration and short on cash, tormented by an inky feline who will either destroy his sanity or spur him to write one of his greatest horror stories ever.

It's nice to see Stuart Gordon's take on something other than H.P. Lovecraft (I haven't seen Edmund yet). I must admit, I was pleasantly surprised by his take on The Black Cat and it might just be my favorite of his work to date aside from the first Re-Animator film.

Gordon does an amazing job of turning the emotional but bloodless work of Poe and turning it into a grand guignol good time, and while he may not look the part as much as, say, Christina Ricci, Combs makes for a highly believable Poe.

Everything from the bit parts, to the set decoration, to the animal actors is top-notch in The Black Cat. Don't miss this one... it's (sorry) the cat's meow!

2828600,4,B000PWQP9I,"Philadelphia, 1840's, the gifted but severely flawed writer Edgar Allan Poe (Jeffrey Combs) is having some serious issues. Suffering from writers block and unable to get his work published, he succumbs to alcoholism while his beautiful young wife, Virginia (Elyse Levesque), becomes gravely ill with tuberculosis. Unable to pay for her care, he immerses himself in his work but there is one obstacle standing in his way and it's in the guise of a diabolical black cat.

This stylish entry in the ""Masters of Horror"" series was directed by Stuart Gordon who didn't impress me much with his season one entry ""Dreams in the Witch House"" which I found much too quirky and lack luster for my taste. This installment however impressed me greatly. It is beautifully filmed with outstanding performances by the two leads, exquisite period costumes and the setting and scenery is atmospheric to boot. It mixes in humor with gore which is not over done (by MOH standards) and some indisputably sinister scenes. It's not perfect however as the horror does take it's time to get started so the pacing is this films worst enemy and animal lovers take notice there is a scene involving feline mutilation that may offend but c'est la vie. This is a horror tale where people and animals will be placed in unpleasant situations and I am sure no animals were harmed in the making of this film. What I loved about this episode is that, although there are moments that are explicit, the scenes that disturbed me the most didn't involve the gore. That only proves you do not need buckets of blood to inspire fear from your audience. With the right director, you can accomplish a heck of a lot with minimal blood shed. There is one scene especially that is expertly done. It oozes bone chilling atmosphere and absolute horror and it involves a woman screaming, a brick wall and that hellish black cat.

Jeffrey Combs is worth mentioning because he was perfectly cast. With the hair and the prosthetics, he looks almost identical to the man he is portraying (at least according to the pictures I have seen) and his performance is solid throughout. Despite Poe's severe emotional problems; Combs is able to make him sympathetic. He flows from one emotion to the other with ease and his lovely leading lady may not have as much to do but still manages to stand out not just by her beauty (which is exquisite) but by her subtle performance as well.

I am not too familiar with the life of Edgar Allan Poe so I do not know how much of this is indeed factual. I am certain the film makers took several liberties here but that is a non issue because everyone involved with this project, for the most part, delivered in spades. ""The Black Cat"" is well acted with a solid story that intrigues; tickles the funny bone and most importantly delivers the chills we horror fans are desperately yearning for. Many episodes in this series delivered in being graphic with abundance of in your face gore, this one delivered in being genuinely creepy. Admittedly, it's gory but not to the ridiculous degree of other episodes and despite some pacing issues and the historical subject matter, it was never dull. Recommended.",1259712000,,3181,4.748643761301989
2828601,5,B000PWQP9I,"This is a wonderful interweaving of Poe's life and his famous story, ""The Black Cat."" If you know only a bit of the man's biography and the story, the mixture is not the least bit confusing; ""The Black Cat"" already contains enough of Poe the man to make the respective plot lines simultaneously independent and seamlessly interwoven. The production values are exceptional and Jeffrey Combs gives one of the most passionate performances I have ever seen of the famous writer. If you're teaching Gothic literature, this could easily be the highlight of your class to cap things off. Give it a look. It's worth every penny.",1258588800,3,620,4.8584905660377355
2828602,5,B000PWQP9I,"I love Poe -- so much that I use four of his works to teach the reading skill of visualization in my classroom.  I use graphic novels and adapted versions to help my students, but finding video of Poe's work has proved very difficult in the 6 years I have been teaching Poe.  Until I found this movie.  This is an awesome telling of ""The Black Cat"".  It is almost exactly the story; it even uses some of the exact wording from Poe's writing.  It is visually exciting and the kids LOVED it.  I also love the fact that it is told from the perspective of Poe and how he came about to writing the story ""The Black Cat"".  It was fun to tell students that there were other of Poe's stories noted in the movie and have them find them (""The Raven"" when Poe looks over his dead wife's body and says, ""Nevermore""; the eye of the man he is selling his stories to from ""the Tell-Tale Heart"").

I HIGHLY recommend this movie, as it is almost exactly how Poe told it.  I do want to warn that there are a couple of graphic scenes (when he plucks out the cat's eye, when he buries his axe in his wife's brain)....",1258070400,3,1097,4.136792452830188
2828603,3,B000PWQP9I,"Edgar Allan Poe's oft-filmed short story ""The Black Cat"" is again turned into an episode of made-for-TV series ""Masters of Horror."" Anyone who has read the original short would remember that Poe's tale contains very graphic violence done to the titular animal. This episode directed by Stuart Gordon (""Re-Animator"") retains much of the source material's shocking descriptions of tortures and gores. If you like cats, perhaps you shouldn't see this one.

The adaptation is fairly faithful to the original tale except one thing: the protagonist is Edgar Allan Poe himself. Stuart Gordon and co-script writer Dennis Paoli incorporated biographical facts into the writer's short story to make a 60-minute episode. Jeffrey Combs plays Edgar Allan Poe, wearing a specially-made false nose to look like the author. But does he really look like him? Well, see it for yourself. (See also the DVD's extra and you will find how they did it.)

Elyse Levesque plays his wife Virginia suffering TB. Inclusion of her character (and her illness) is, it seems, an excuse for showing lots of blood. Yes, lots of it. It is a nice way to shock the audiences, but the shocks come few and far between in the story that switches between reality and fantasy. The slightly confusing narrative undermines the impact that the fate of three characters - the deranged narrator, his dutiful wife and the black cat - should give to us in the original tale.

Jeffrey Combs hams it up as troubled author Edgar Allan Poe. He plays the writer driven slowly to madness with the over-the-top acting, which is a hit-and-miss affair. He is genuinely effective when the graphic violence is involved, like disturbing animal torture scenes, but for all the make-ups he doesn't convince me as Poe himself. Actually, I couldn't see the point of making him the ax-wielding protagonist when we know that blood and violence is, and should be, the most attractive part of the show.

To me, the most interesting part of the DVD is its making-of, in which the filmmakers explain how they achieved to do special effects within the limited budget. No cats were harmed during the filming.

I was not impressed with the narrative gimmick of making Poe himself the center of the story after all. This is, I think, partly because the most famous episode about the enigmatic writer's life is, as you know, his mysterious death in Baltimore, which is at odds with the short story's conclusion, and partly because Poe's great works are based on his unsurpassed imagination, or (dark) fantasy, which is missing here.",1241136000,2,2556,4.934883720930233
2828604,4,B000PWQP9I,"I've seen many Poe adaptations over the years, everything from Jean Epstein's masterful silent version of ""House of Usher"" to the Corman/Price films, and even animated shorts like the 1953 ""Tell-Tale Heart"" (narrated by James Mason) and Czech animator Jan Svankmajer's ""The Pit, the Pendulum, and Hope."" Most of these directors portrayed his  works with a measure of restraint, and that has always been my preference. That said, I felt this version manages to be faithful to the original Poe story, and to Poe's own life. For this film is somewhat unique in being both an adaptation of The Black Cat and an abbreviated biopic of Poe himself. It's an interesting synthesis, and I think Stuart Gordon pulled it off nicely.
My main criticism is the occasional gore. This is displayed in 3 main sequences: the eruption of blood from the mouth of the tubercular Virginia Clemm; the gouging out of the cat's eye by the Poe character; and the splitting of Virginia's skull with an axe near the end of the film. Gordon defends these forays in the commentary track by saying he wanted to remain as faithful as possible to the way Poe originally wrote the story. I can cut him that much slack, but I still don't believe it's necessary to hew so literally to an author's work, simply because the very nature of the printed word creates an aesthetic distance between a horror narrative and the reader, whereas the medium of film allows for much less distance. Consequently, I've always felt that more should be left to the imagination. Otherwise, what we get is not so much ""horror"" as revulsion and disgust. Of course, I come from the Old School of horror fans who grew up on the films of Lewton, James Whale, et. al. I daresay not many fans under 40 years of age share my views.
Despite these ""lapses,"" I give this film 4 stars because the acting is generally first-rate, starting with Jeffrey Combs, a superb actor in a first-rate performance, and almost all the supporting cast. The one exception is the actress playing Virginia Clemm. She's a stunning girl, and certainly looks the part. And her acting is competent. The problem is her diction. While Combs pulls off a very convincing Southern accent (and Poe himself was a Southern gentleman of real breeding), she speaks with a northern intonation that sounds like it's coming somewhere between Chicago and Philadelphia. Not only that, but it carries no aura of someone who might have grown up in mid-19th Century America -- it's simply too ""contemporary"" in tone and inflection. I don't know whether to attribute this incongruity to her lack of experience or to a lack of concern on Gordon's part. But it creates a jarring effect whenever she speaks.
Despite these flaws, I give this drama high marks and believe it's well worth seeing. It's also a valuable contribution to the Poe canon on film inasmuch as it's very well researched, and tells us a lot about Poe himself. It's likely that Gordon's treatment would have been even more graphic had he been filming for the theater rather than for television. Nevertheless, give him credit for turning out what is essentially a fine piece of work.",1228694400,2,3140,4.78268876611418
2828605,4,B000PWQP9I,"H.P. Lovecraft adapter extraordinaire Stuart Gordon (Re-Animator, From Beyond) returns to Masters of Horror to weave this inventive episode.  In The Black Cat, Stuart re-unites with the always great Jeffrey Combs, who turns in a riveting performance as the down-on-his-luck alcoholic poet Edgar Allan Poe, suffering a case of writer's block while dealing with his ailing wife Virginia (Elyse Levesque).  Things don't appear to be getting much easier for Poe either, especially as Virginia's cat torments him a great deal; all of which will possibly inspire Poe to craft one of his most famous tales, or completely ruin him.  The most noteworthy factor of The Black Cat is undoubtedly the too often underused Combs, who is simply wonderful in the role, while the equally underrated director Gordon manages to keep things pretty compelling throughout the episode.  Those sensitive to violence against animals should be warned before viewing The Black Cat however, as these scenes prove to be quite difficult to watch.  All in all though, The Black Cat is a faithful yet inventive take on the life and work of Edgar Allan Poe, and fans of Stuart Gordon and/or Jeffrey Combs should definitely pick this episode up.",1228003200,,1210,5.121827411167513

2828607,4,B000PWQP9I,"Until viewing this I was not familiar with the Masters Of Horror series, but when I heard that Stuart Gordon was directing an hour long feature on the great Gothic poet/writer, Edgar Allan Poe, my curiosity was deeply piqued. Initially I was worried they would turn his life and genious into an unflattering mess but they brilliantly twisted bits and pieces of his real life into the inspiration for his disturbing story, ""The Black Cat"". Jeffrey Combs does a fantastic job and an uncanny likeness to E.A. Poe by portraying his descent into madness through alcoholism and his struggle to be recognized in the literary world while also showing his softer side through the love for his cousin/wife.

I confidently feel that any fan or admirer of Edgar Allan Poe's work will enjoy and appreciate this latest installment of the series. Just be warned, if your an animal lover like myself you'll find there to be a few squeamish parts difficult to watch. But as another reviewer stated: No animals were harmed in the making of this film!",1199059200,,1032,4.797752808988764

2828609,5,B000PWQP9I,"With the latest Masters of Horror DVD release, you don't just get one Master of Horror, but three: Director Stuart Gordon, Actor Jeffrey Combs, and early master of the macabre tale Edgar Allan Poe. The three combine to bring you one of Poe's best-known tales, The Black Cat. Gordon and Combs are certainly no strangers to each other. They first worked together in 1985 on the cult classic Re-Animator, and would team again on films such as From Beyond and Castle Freak. This time they tackle a Poe story that has been adapted several times but never all that well.

The interesting thing about the production is how the writers Gordon and Dennis Paoli combine Poe's own life with his tale. Rather than an unnamed narrator, Poe himself becomes the narrator as the screenplay cleverly mixes Poe's original tale, with events from Poe's actual life. Poe is played brilliantly by Jeffrey Combs. When Combs is made up, the likeness to photos of Poe is uncanny. I actually had to a double take to see that it was really Combs. I've grown accustomed to his wild-eyed, nebbish roles that he took me by surprise.

As the film opens, Poe is already famous for his horror tales and his publisher demands more while Poe would prefer to write poetry. He struggles to make ends meet and provide for his wife Virgina. Desperate for income, they decide to sell Virgina's beloved piano however Edgar insists his wife play a song for a potential buyer. While playing, she begins to cough up bursts of blood due to being inflicted with consumption, or Tuberculosis as it's called today. This is, in fact, all true. Virginia did break a blood vessel while singing and playing the piano. As Virginia's condition worsens, Poe begins to drink more and more, and becomes increasingly irritated with their pet cat, Pluto. In a fit of a drunken rage, Poe gouges one of the cat's eyes out with a penknife. The battle of wills between cat and man eventually leads to the film's chilling ending but with a twist on the original tale.

The Black Cat is beautifully filmed. Most of the film appears in a washed out color palette that borders on black & white. This is contrasted by the bright red crimson of Virginia's blood and the deep emerald eyes of Pluto. Combs and Elyse Levesque give superb performances as Edgar and Virginia. Combs immerses himself into the tragic psyche of the lead character who, despite his literary successes, lived a life of destitution, alcoholism. and eventually madness, which only worsened after Virginia's death. Levesque is the supportive wife, willing to sacrifice her own comforts, and even her fragile health, for her husband.

The Black Cat is not the usual Masters of Horror episode. Its horror is more subtly spread; although gore fans shouldn't be too disappointed...this is, after all, from the guy who gave us Re-Animator! There are a few nice extras on the disc: Audio commentary with Gordon and Combs; a short feature on the various special effects; a fifteen minute ""making of"" documentary, photo gallery, and DVD-ROM script.

REVIEWED BY TIM JANSON",1194566400,2,3065,4.819391634980988
2828610,5,B000PWQP9I,"When Stuart Gordon and Jeffrey Combs come together, they normally make beautiful landscapes that remind me more of cinematic tides touching portrayal-laden sands than of two people trying to push together frames. Perhaps that's because of the great deal of things they've done together; they've done a great deal of work in the realms of H.P. Lovecraft and Gordon has also put in time in the realm of Poe, and this revitalization of The Black Cat is yet another appealing picture painted by the Gordon quill. I liked it, too, enough so that I forgave the Masters of Horror series for a lot of the lackluster subsets it had done in this latest series. In a sense this is what I wanted when I saw Gordon was up to bat anyhow; I've always imagined Gordon and Combs as a tandem that were quite knowledgeable of the inner workings of the classics and I knew whatever they did would be amazing.
And Gordon and Combs coming together with something that has been done more than once - I enjoyed the fact that they could connect all the dots and to connect them well.

Much of what comes from the director also echoes in the performance of his case, and nobody seems to work better with Gordon than combs. Much like Combs had done when he played the role of Lovecraft in Necronomicon, he took on the tormented form of Poe and made his pain believable. One of the marks of a great horror actor is to become a sensation like that of pain and to somehow sell it along with the movements and the backgrounds and the terrible stuff of legends and Combs does that beautifully. Equally impressive is Elyse Levesque in her portrayal of EAP's dying bride, and the cat - well, the cat was not exactly what I'd call a household dream.

If you are a fan of the Masters of Horror, a fan of Stuart Gordon or Jeffrey Combs, or if you haven't seen the story of Edgar Allan Poe come to life before and would like a pseudo-tour of his troubles then this is a great buy. It has a small punchline in the price department and has a nice kick that is nasty by nature, and it is just plain good.
Not too campy, not too serious - it is what Masters of Horror set out to be.",1194048000,6,2140,4.32089552238806
2828611,4,B000PWQP9I,"Bravo! I have to admit I have finally been impressed by the lack luster MOH series. This is by far the finest piece of work I have seen out of all the MOH short films.

The Black Cat is a classic Edgar Allen Poe tale that was created perfectly by Stuart Gordon. It was slightly slow at the start but picked up beautifully half way through. It wasn't scary (if thats what you're looking for) but it was intense and extremely well put together. I absolutely loved it and would recommend it to anyone looking for a unique viewing experience, especially if you are a fan of the MOH series.",1191542400,2,585,4.318181818181818
2828612,4,B000PWQP9I,"The Masters of Horror series brings us sixty-minute episodes that cover a wide range of topics in the genre. In this case, the plot has to do with Edgar Alan Poe and his short story ""The Black Cat"". I really liked the way in which the episode integrated the short story and puts a surprising twist on it. Therefore, if you really want to appreciate this, you are going to have to read the tale first.

Poe lives with his wife, Sissy, and is trying to make a living writing poetry. Sadly, this is not what the public seeks. They want to get more of his fantastic tales instead, so the publisher demands this of the writer. This drives the Poe to seek refuge in his drinking, hoping that the stupor will make him forget his problems and take him away from the simpletons that do not comprehend his genius. But this is not his only problem, since his wife is afflicted by the white plague and her condition is getting worse every day. In this scenario, we find Poe and his wife's black cat, Pluto, start to confront each other, with the violence quickly escalating and reaching vicious tones.

This episode has all the basic characteristics that make a great horror story. Jeffrey Combs delivers an astounding performance, making us feel the craziness of the character as if it was jumping from the screen. There is also a fair amount of gore, and the chills are enough to keep us on our toes for a good portion of the time. The only drawback is that towards the middle of the story, the pace drags a little and we find ourselves willing to press the fast forward button. Nevertheless, the quality of this production is very good and I recommend it for people that enjoy the genre, and especially for Poe fans.",1190764800,,1707,4.467948717948718
2828613,5,B000PWQP9I,"This may be the best single cinematic treatment on the life of Poe yet filmed...for it is much more than a spin on ""The Black Cat"".  The film covers  and cross-references so much of Poe and his life and loves and literary output that it is absolutely the best visual introduction to the Poe Universe I have come across.  The image of a drunken Poe walking home with a gigantic cat shadow stalking him is alone worth the price of this DVD!  The acting, sets, music are all gothically top-notch.  (The actor playing Poe looks (with makeup, of course) so very much like Poe it would be wondeful if Stallone considered him for his own long-planned biopic of the Divine Edgar. But then again, if Stallone is directing I don't have very high hopes for its eventual quality or accuracy.  Poe will get into a 12 round drunken boxing bout somewhere in it, I'm sure!) However...what makes this gripping film all the more poignant and at the same time horrific is that, yes, it seems to end on a happy note - Virginia is alive and Poe gains the inspiration for a story that will win more bread for his meagre table.....but the horrors of Virginia's demise he has been tortured by throughout the bulk of the film we all know will, indeed, come to pass.  The Red Death will take her at age 24.  Poe at 40.  The only thing missing from the script is Virgina's mother -  Muddy - for the three were inseparable...and her inclusion could have wrought futher tormented, waking nightmares in Poe's mind.  But....this is a small point considering how very much ground is, indeed, covered in the time given.  Bravo to one and all who made this mini-masterpiece!",1190678400,3,1640,4.540816326530612

The Black Cat reunites Gordon with his long time leading man Jeff Combs. Combs portrayal of Edgar Allen Poe is so both wonderfully twisted and accurate, off hand the only characterization I can compare it to is Dennis Quaid's wonderful rendition of Doc Holiday in ""Wyatt Earp"". The only caviat I would introduce is that being a cat lover I have to be in exactly the right frame of mind to watch this, as it can get a touch gorey at times. Still again it is so worth it just to see Jeff Combs teamed with Stuart Gordon again. I look forward to this directors contribution to a third series.",1190160000,,778,4.524822695035461

There are scenes of ghastly gore here not for the squeamish such as a cat getting it's eyeball removed but don't worry folks it's all fake and not real, i love how Gordon has twisted Poe's short story into a grueling and disturbing 60 minute movie for ""Masters of Horror"" and i think it's one of the best stories on the show yet.

2828618,5,B000PWQP9I,"Stuart Gordon is arguably one of the few masters at directing horror films who remains totally faithful to both the genre and his fans.  That's not to say that Gordon hasn't had a few misses, but unlike many of his peers, he obviously tries to avoid pandering to the big-name studios, the MPAA, and conservative watch-dog groups, and even his lesser efforts are therefore often more appealing to genre fans than some of the best efforts of other directors. Gordon knows what makes a good horror film AND what makes it appealing to the hard-core fans, meaning that he doesn't shy away from controversial subjects or themes and he delivers the shocks and the gore without being gratuitous about it.  And that is precisely why Gordon's THE BLACK CAT, his latest entry in Showtime's cable-TV series MASTERS OF HORROR, is probably the best episode of the series to date.

THE BLACK CAT is a fictional, but fact-based, account of how the great horror and mystery writer Edgar Allan Poe may have been inspired to write his short-story masterpiece ""The Black Cat.""  Living in poverty and struggling to take care of his gravely ill wife, Poe falls into bouts with depression, alcoholism, and drug abuse. During these emotional and drug-laden episodes, he has delusions and hallucinations involving a badgering feline and the inadvertent murder of his beloved wife. Ultimately, he pulls himself out of his stupor and draws inspiration from his delusions the coalesce into the famous short story.

Jeffrey Combs, a longtime collaborator of Gordon's, is absolutely outstanding in the role of Poe. Not only is he dead-ringer (excuse the pun) for the famous American author, but Combs delivers a tour-de-force performance that makes the story both compelling and believable. And delivering excellent performances in supporting roles are Aron Tager, whom genre fans may recognize from his recurring role as Doctor Vink in Nickelodeon's delightful children's horror anthology ARE YOU AFRAID OF THE DARK?; attractive Elyse Levesque playing Poe's young wife; Eric Keenleyside as a police officer in one of Poe's delusions; and Ian Alexander Martin and Ken Kramer in small but important roles.

Although the account is fictional, Gordon and his co-writer Dennis Paoli did exceptional research to ensure that the details of Poe's life were factual, making the story seem all the more like something that could have indeed occurred and, in turn, inspired the great author and poet.  Many of these factual details are pointed out by Gordon and actor Combs in their excellent feature commentary, and others are discussed in one of the exceptional documentaries offered on the disc.  In addition to these, other special features include a documentary on the make-up and CGI FX, a biography of director Gordon, and the episode's screenplay.

In spite of its short run time (55 mins), small budget, and an excruciatingly short production schedule, ""The Black Cat""--like Gordon's first-season MOH entry, ""Dreams in the Witch House""--does not come across as a  cheap, hastily executed made-for-cable film. Gordon's direction is tight and skillful, drawing upon his experience in both theater and film to create a perfectly dreary mood that, while intricate to the narrative, never upstages the actors or the action.  The cinematography is also breathtaking, with camera angles and visuals that help to belie the film's meager budget, and Gordon's decision to use starkly monochromatic color scheme, punctuated only occasionally with elements of harsh color, adds to the realism of this period piece.

In short, ""The Black Cat"" is a highly entertaining and notable entry in the horror genre, and it is arguably the best entry hitherto in Showtime's MASTERS OF HORROR series. Indeed, in spite of its made-for-cable origins, Gordon's skill and faithfulness to the genre and genre fans serves to created a film that rivals many full-length horror films released in theaters these days, and all serious genre fans should consider adding the film to their growing collections.",1185148800,3,4042,5.192012288786482
2828619,5,B000PWQP9I,"This is another Masters of Horror entry by Stuart Gordon. Jeffrey Combs is Edgar Allan Poe, looking for inspiration for his next work. His wife is dying of TB. His alcoholism won't go away. His debts are mounting. And on top of that the most irritating black cat keeps popping up at the wrong times...

I'm tempted to recommend this just for Jeffrey Combs, famed cult actor. I can't say if his Poe is historically accurate, but he gives a charged performance and with the costuming he looks reasonably like the original article. Gordon captures the spirit of Poe's horror literature well, with a build-up of mood and tension as sanity fails and madness takes over. There are also some stand-out bits of gore as well; I agree with the previous reviewer, if you like cats, don't watch this. It's not a very pet-friendly film.

The film does get off to a slow start, and for awhile you wonder if you're watching a history channel biopic until things pick up. Really, the only semi-strike against The Black Cat is that you know beforehand how it turns out.  Making Poe the central character means he obviously has to live through the events so he can be inspired and write about them. But the joy of this piece is not in any final twists or reveals, but in seeing one of literature's greatest horror stories adapted for the screen.

If you can handle the pet violence, add this to your horror library.",1182038400,5,1397,4.576

8193669,5,B000PWQP9I,"The ""Masters of Horror"" television series has had its fair shares of ups and downs.  While many of the short films are extremely appealing, others tend to fall short on delivering either an intriguing storyline or a decent level of terror and scares.  Well, Stuart Gordon does an amazing job of transforming a classic literary short story into an amazing short film.  Using inspiration from not only the classic Edgar Allen Poe story ""The Black Cat"" but also making references to Poe's life truly adds creditability to the film, making it true to the source material, while also letting the audience dig deeper into the thought patterns and lifestyle of Poe himself.

Jeffery Combs is cast as the lead role of Edgar Allen Poe, who is currently experiencing money problems.  He cannot provide care to his ailing wife, due to his excessive drinking problems, and his lack of any recent income.  Poe hasn't written a story in a long time, and instead is trying to rely on selling his poetry to the local paper for spare cash.  The money quickly goes towards the local bar though, while Poe's wife lays at home silently suffering.  The film at first shows Poe's wife, Virginia Clemm Poe (played by Elyse Levesque), keeping her ailment to herself, hiding the blood that she coughs up from her husband (and cousin) Edgar.  Whenever Edgar attempts to comfort his wife though, he is greeted by their pet cat Pluto, who does not take too fondly of Edgar at all, striking the man whenever he can.

In a final attempt to make money, Virginia agreed to sell her piano, despite her love and talent for the instrument.  Edgar asks his wife to play a song for him one more time on the piano before selling it.  While playing the piano, Virginia breaks out into a coughing spell, leading to a river blood that spews from her mouth while she chokes and gags on her own blood, Edgar scrambles for assistance.  After the doctor refuses to assist Virginia to the degree that Edgar would like (due to his lack of money), Poe becomes infuriated.  He begins his decent into madness.  This portion of the film was based on Poe's biography, staying very true to his life.  After this portion of the film, we slowly transcend into the classic tale ""The Black Cat"".

The next portion of the film begins to tell the tale of the short story on which the film is titled.  Poe begins to torture his cat, carving out its eye, and hanging it (similar to the story), however the cat continues to return to haunt him and remind him of his cruel deed.  In a fit of blind rage, he commits murder, and barricades the body within a wall (like the story).  Staying true to the story, the film depicts Poe as being over confident in his hiding of the body, insisting that cops inspect the walls.  Poe usually does this in his pieces, such as in ""The Tell Tale Heart"" where he insists that the cops sit down, right on top of the floor boards in which the man is buried, and in ""The Black Cat"" where he insists that the officers inspect ""these strong walls"" while repeating over and over again just how well built the walls are.

The film is graphic, and beautifully rendered, with less vibrant colors utilized for the actors and environment, allowing deeper colors such as red (for the blood) to truly stand out in highly detailed manners.  The story stays true to both Poe's life, and his story.  The scenes between Poe and the cat are extremely graphic, but are indeed necessary as they are part of the original tale in which the film is based off of.  The basement scene was disturbing in the story, and Stuart Gordon does an even better job at bringing it to life.  The violence, the ambiance, and the overall haunting tone of the scene is extraordinary, and can truly send shivers down the viewers' spines.  This is a truly disturbing, and well done film, based on a truly and well done story, written by a true legend in the literary world.",1283299200,4,3904,4.547925608011445
