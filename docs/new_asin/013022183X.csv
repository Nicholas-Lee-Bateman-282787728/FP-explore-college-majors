7787870,2,013022183X,"This is listed as a DVD and says ""number of discs"" but it is shown as a VHS tape.  This is an excellent video and I had one like it that I lent out a few years ago and was looking for a new one, preferable DVD.  I was excited to find this here since I thought I'd looked before but it wasn't listed.  I ordered it and it arrived yesterday, but is exactly the same VHS tape that I had before. I'm not returning it because I'm fairly sure that the DVD must not exist (but WHY???) and I need it. I'm a literacy coach and will use this to show teachers how reading and writing within a developmental spelling program can be accomplished. Highly recommend the item, but BEWARE you are getting a TAPE not a DVD.",1225497600,2,705,4.057553956834532
