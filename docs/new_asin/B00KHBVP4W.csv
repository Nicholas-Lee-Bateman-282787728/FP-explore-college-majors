***If you have not bought any of the 4 features at the following listing (also containing the above title), I recommend considering the whole package :&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-World-War-One-Collection-4pack-Giftset-DVD/dp/B00MWGGS1K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The World War One Collection (4pack/ Giftset/ DVD)</a>

Reading the title one may mistake this as a documentary of WWI based on Churchill's famous writings on the subject.  In fact, this is a documentary about Churchill himself and how WWI formed him, and how he contributed to warfare during that time.  It is an extraordinary story of how someone who ascended to great power at a young age and then fails, only to piece his political career together again over time.  It is an example of how an action man with vision has an unflappable belief that he has a date with history.  One of the strengths of this documentary is the inclusion of detail about his wife Clementine and their relationship through it all.

This exceptional though not perfect documentary has plenty of nicely dramatized scenes and nice movie footage from WWI.  Though they definitely don't avoid showing Churchill's lust for fame and power, I would still say it's a little understated in perhaps British fashion.  They touch on his enthusiasm for the beginning of WWI, but don't show his influence in the cabinet for actions that actually helped bring about WWI.  Nevertheless, we see how almost laughable or threatening his ambitions are to his seniors and peers (such as his request to be made a general in his first Belgium mission that was viewed as a mixed success).  We see his greatest failure later with the Dardanelles campaign and his dismissal as First Lord of the Admiralty.  It was fascinating to see his determination in going to the Army and fighting in the trenches as a common Major, then LT Col.  It is surprising that with all his flowery eccentricities, his attention to detail and problem solving actually made him a good commander.  Further, Churchill grasps concepts and necessities of modern warfare despite his obsession with history.  This is something that commanders in WWI were notoriously bad at grasping.  I was not previously aware of Churchill's contributions to developing modern tank warfare.

For someone who is looking for all WWI combat illustrations, this program may drag just a little bit.  However, it still has interesting points to make in that respect.  For someone interested in illustrations of political ascendency, I thought it was fascinating and even inspiring despite  Churchill's foibles.  One gets the sense that despite Churchill's overbearingness, he and Clementine really are partners in his date with greatness.  The program is not that long compared to some documentaries, so it really is just an overview.  Take it for what it is and enjoy.",1414108800,14,2982,5.3247863247863245

8658946,1,B00KHBVP4W,"What a bunch of nonsense! This film is ridiculous. Winston Churchill was all of 5'6"" yet the producers of this propaganda portray him as being about 6'2"". Churchill is one of the main manipulators of WWI! Contrary to the perpetuated lies of the last century Kaiser Wilhelm II 'did not' want war with the United Kingdom. All he wanted was an empire similar to that of his ancestors across the channel. Because of Churchill's absurd influence of his cronies in parliament he got his way, and WWI happened! And, because of WWI and the cruel way the Brits, French, and Woodrow Wilson treated Germany WWII came about. Even then, Germany did not want a war with Britain. But again, Churchill got his way. Don't believe me? Then read Pat Buchanan's fabulous book, ""Churchill, Hitler, and the Unnecessary War"". I used to be an admirer, but as I read books about Churchill (who incidentally was a terrible student as a child. Quite obstinate in so many ways!) I became quite suspicious, and cynical! But then I read Buchanan's book, and became convinced that Winston Spencer Churchill was the real perpetrator of evil of the 20th century. Remember though; it's the victors who write the history, so that is why he is portrayed as being such a brilliant leader. The man was a scoundrel!",1522627200,,1276,4.752252252252252

8658948,4,B00KHBVP4W,"Just like anything Churchill. Megalomaniac, Bombastic, Self absorbed? Sure, but brave to a fault, and devoted no only to himself, but to his Country. How many Public figures, when cast from office, would go to the front lines, and fight. Yes, yes he acted will folly, and other officers hated him, but he won much respect from those same officers, and looked after the men in his battalion, he became a good officer, and I think learned a great deal about men.",1501286400,2,460,4.621951219512195

8658950,4,B00KHBVP4W,An excellent DVD on Churchill's formative years albeit the primary complaint is that the actor portraying him does not bear a resemblance to him. The DVD is interspersed with old film clips and photos which was nicely done.,1439424000,3,223,4.894736842105263

8658952,5,B00KHBVP4W,"I found this dvd to be a very informative look at Churchill during the first World War. The disastrous Gallipoli campaign in the Dardanelles led to the young Churchill being blamed for the deaths of thousands. He was removed as the Secretary of the Navy and his career seemed to be in tatters. He then volunteered for the trenches in France where he served honorably and was highly regarded by his men. Before the war ends he is back in London working with Prime Minister Lloyd George as head of munitions.

A very watchable description of perhaps the greatest man of the 20th Century. Highly Recommended.",1429056000,4,605,4.7075471698113205
