8035739,5,B00030DEK0,"I used to do this video with my mom when I was just a little girl.  It helped her get back in shape after having all her babies. Now after having my second child I am turning to this for when I get bored with my other exercise routines.  It's fun and challenging still, but newer exercisers may not appreciate it as much as I do...the styles and music are pretty outdated but the moves are great and follow current principles.  If you think it is going to be easy just because it's outdated, think again! Some parts are pretty tough...she'll make you sweat. It incorporates aerobics, balance, stretching, floor work and ab work. You can add ankle weights and dumbbells to some parts for strength training also. If you are a fan of the 80's I think you will enjoy it. Kathy is a great motivator! You can find previews of a few short clips on some other sites to get an idea of what you are getting. I ordered this through Amazon from a separate company and it was still delivered in just a few days in brand new condition. I ordered the VHS as I've heard the DVD lost a few bits and pieces of the original workout when it was converted to the newer version. The VHS is exactly how I remember it.",1272931200,3,1194,4.251101321585903
8035740,5,B00030DEK0,"I've used this workout at home for years an it's the best high-impact aerobic workout I've found--and I've tried a few! This workout starts out slowly, and then it picks up. What I like about it is if I don't feel up to it, I can keep my feet on the floor (not jump if I don't want to) and still feel like I had a good workout. I usually only do the aerobic portion which is only 30 mins, but there's also a toning portion targeting all those fun areas. This workout is definitely in my rotation of workouts.",1238112000,,508,4.09
8035741,5,B00030DEK0,This one is too advanced for me right now but I'm working my way up it. Kathy is elite!,1231804800,,87,3.6315789473684212
8035742,4,B00030DEK0,"This is an intense Kathy Smith workout filmed back in 1984. This is of course her first video she made and it is very 80s. This is way better the her newer tapes that come out. This is a hard core high impact video which also includes toning exercises using your own body strength with no weights and a part for balance similiar to the balance section on Jane Fonda`s Workout Challenge. The first part of the video is the aerobics which starts out with a warm up and aerobic warm up to get you ready for the challenges of the next sequence. Than after that is pulse check and than the high impact continues a little bit longer with add on. This part Kathy and the other instructers with her are outside on the street and they are showing you to add on to each move. Than the toning begins with the upper torso,than lower torso,balance and so on and so forth. I think this is a very good video I love the music and the 80s style with the hard core exercise that makes you sore the next day. The only problem with this video is how Kathy does not do the mirror image. This is something they couldd have done without. I always like to mirror when I am  working out with videos. Her constant left when it your right and right when its you left is very confusing to me. Her footlookin screen that shows how your feet should be opposite does not help much. This is something that should have bee noticed back than. I just ignore the wrong directions and the footlookin and just mirror them like I like to. Other than that it is a great workout totally not designed for beginner or the weak of hearted but it is great.",1168473600,4,1611,4.23051948051948
8035743,5,B00030DEK0,"This video works your ENTIRE BODY in an hour without using any equipment!  It's really high-impact/cardiovascular, the moves are fun but basic, so you can really work on the important part of improving your fitness level without always having to look back and forth like, 'What the heck is she doing NOW???'  I love love love working out and I'm a high-engergy person, so it's awesome for somebody who is in o.k. shape (I have a desk job but work out about 3 days a week) to get an extra good workout.  She even has a short balance section, and the music is good for a workout video.  You will have a 'good' pain for a couple days following.  It works all your muscles.  And... Kathy's body is in great shape for this video, so it's really inspiring.  I recommend this to anybody who thinks that today's videos are on the easy side.",1112054400,12,832,4.398692810457517
8035744,5,B00030DEK0,"Remember the feeling you got when sprinting in gym class? Thats the feeling I get when I do this tape. Wow is it hard! Its harder than Tae-bo! This is Kathy Smith's first workout video and one of her best actually. It is very HIGH IMPACT so stay away from it if you have bad knees or whatever. Otherwise please buy it for yourself and do it 3 times a week, it will kill you, and you'll love it, I promise!!!!!!! BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY it add it to you Kathy SMith collection, its a good one... just don't injure yourself...hehe",1031702400,16,524,4.147058823529412
