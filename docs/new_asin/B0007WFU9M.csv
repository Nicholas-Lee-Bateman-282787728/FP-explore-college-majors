8052589,2,B0007WFU9M,This is an awesome film with beautiful special effects!  That said there is a better version of this film which is sadly out of print! If you don;t believe me about the quality then just read the other who have reviewed this product. To make matters worse this company has recently folded so if you want to own this film then you better pick up any copy you can get your hands on.  Be wary of people who like to take advantage of these types of situations because they will overcharge you.  Anyway good hunting to you steadfast collector of fun Japanese films!,1270512000,,560,4.41747572815534
8052590,1,B0007WFU9M,"WARNING: Not In English as stated in the description. Only English sub-titles. Not worth one penny to me, i hate reading sub-titles because you can not enjoy or concentrate on the movie. Schroeder (DJ WACK ""O"") of Cult Movies Magazine.",1214179200,,235,4.9
8052591,1,B0007WFU9M,"For some unknown reason, ADV has taken it unto itself to crop their beautifully remastered print of DAIMAJIN IKARU from 2.35:1 Daeiscope to 1.85:1.  The result is the net loss of 40% or so of the image to the left and right.  The audio quality is excellent, the image vibrant, but the aspect ratio really destroys any appeal this disc may have to former fans of the film.  On the flipside, their re-release of the first film is incredibly inexpensive, in the correct aspect ratio, and features the best print of the film I've ever seen.  Fans would do better to simply stick with the old releases or go with the official Japanese R2 discs.",1115683200,7,639,4.530434782608696
8052592,5,B0007WFU9M,"This is a tale of two clans both under attack from a neighbouring clan near a lake in feudal Japan. One of the clans has a 20 foot statue of their god on a tiny island just off the coast. While the two clans were attending religious services on the island, the third clan occupied the other two clans' villages. Saying anything else would spoil the ending. The Daimajin series are blends of myth, history, reality and fantasy with decent F/X considering the era.",1115078400,2,462,4.511904761904762
