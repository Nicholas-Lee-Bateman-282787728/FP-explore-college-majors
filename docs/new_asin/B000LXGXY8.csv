2716149,5,B000LXGXY8,"Unlike most long-running (five years or more) TV shows, The Rockford Files only seemed to grow more entertaining as seasons passed.  This is, of course, due to solid writing and acting, but also the fleshing out of many of the regular characters, including Angel, Beth and Dennis.  It goes without saying that James Garners breezy characterization of Rockford rates as one of the best in TV history.  I look forward to collecting the entire series, and hopefully the many TV movies that came in their wake.",1171065600,34,506,4.8604651162790695
2716150,5,B000LXGXY8,"James Garner is a great actor and Jim Rockford is his greatest character.  Backed by an excellent supporting cast and superlative writing, this show never gets old despite the fact that I've seen each episode a gazillion times. Whether he is peddling a slick con to a gullible, greedy crook. bailing sleazy Angel out for the umpteenth time, turning the tables on the bad guys in the end with Dennis and the cavalry coming in the door at the last minute, Jim, (Garner or Rockford - who knows?) makes an extremely appealing character who everyone would like to have as a friend or buddy. Add a number of beautiful woman who never seem to be able to corral Jim and you have a series for the ages.",1170806400,35,693,4.456692913385827

If they are available, it would have been nice to see a ""director's cut"".

2716287,3,B000LXGXY8,"James Garner is such a natural actor that these are fun to watch. I was a little disappointed in the weak stories. No excessive violence, but nothing much really happens either. Most episodes seem to be the same. I love Columbo and Matlock and Diagnosis Murder, and although these are certainly not complicated, they have more substance than Rockford. I don't know if the other seasons are any better, but I was a little disappointed in this one.",1400976000,,446,4.730769230769231

2716312,5,B000LXGXY8,We have had this DVD for a few years now and decided I should write a review. It would have to be one of the best TV Series ever made. We bought this movie from Amazon because at the time it was not available in Australia. Highly recommended..,1393372800,,243,4.083333333333333

2716314,4,B000LXGXY8,"The Rockford Files was an excellent TV series. The acting and quality of the stories of each show just naturally draw the viewer in. This third season collection is really fun. The characters are so well established and have such feeling, it's almost like being involved with friends on an adventure when viewing each episode.
Easily recommended to any James Garner Fan.",1385856000,,370,4.983870967741935
2716315,5,B000LXGXY8,"Rockford has always been a favorite of mine and by the time I discovered I liked the program, it went off the air so I have not seen all of the episodes. Many will be brand new for me and I am enjoying a episode or two every night. The quality of the set is wonderful and it came earlier than expected so that was an extra blessing!",1382572800,,332,3.8970588235294117
2716316,5,B000LXGXY8,"I like Jim Garner, but wasn't a fan of this show.  My friend loved the show and asked if it was available on Amazon.  The prices were good so we ordered him two seasons that he needed for his collection.",1381190400,,203,4.05
2716317,5,B000LXGXY8,"Some great episodes here:  ""The Birds, the Bees and TT FLOWERS"" was a nail biter!  Love the episodes where Rocky is prominent!  ""SO HELP ME,GOD"" was disturbing in its content but an eye opener.  The episode with Dennis being framed was great, also.  I love the ones where Dennis needs help from Jim for once.  ""To Protect and Serve""  was great and Joyce Van Patten did a fabulously believable job of being a really annoying police groupie.  GREAT SEASON!",1381190400,,454,4.658227848101266

2716333,5,B000LXGXY8,"The Rockford files series is classic.  Very much more simple plots than the shows of today.  If you like James Garner you will appreciate these dvds.  I own 5 of the 6 seasons, and plan to purchase the last.",1374796800,,207,4.256410256410256

2716338,5,B000LXGXY8,I love season three of the rockford files. Now I have only one season to complete my collection. I believe this was one of the best show on TV.,1371254400,,143,3.9655172413793105
2716339,5,B000LXGXY8,"If you are a fan of The Rockford Files, there is a lot to like about season three (1976-77), as life seems to have settled down a bit, for Malibu private investigator Jim Rockford (James Garner).  As usual, Jim finds himself involved in offbeat cases, meeting interesting people, engaging in some radical car chases, and occasionally running afoul of the law, or organized crime, but with the support of his father ""Rocky"" (Noah Beery Jr.), police detective Dennis Becker (Joe Santos), and some of his close friends, ""Jimbo"" somehow manages to pull through.  There may not be many big paydays for Rockford, but in this season, at least he doesn't take it on the chin that often.

Very little is happening in the romance department, as things have cooled down with lawyer Beth Davenport (Gretchen Corbett), and there are few damsel in distress type cases.  Fortunately, Beth is still around, when Jim gets into legal scrapes.  Stuart Margolin is always enjoyable as Jim's squirrely buddy ""Angel"" Martin, who this time around actually does more good than harm.  Adding some new flavors, Season Three features the introduction of James Luisi, as police Lt. Doug Chapman, who has a severe dislike for Rockford, and his methods.

As in previous seasons, the writing remains at a high level, with more quirky adventures, and some great guest stars.  Robert Webber makes his third appearance on the program, as an infuriating psychic, looking to exploit Rockford, in ""The Oracle Wore a Cashmere Suit"".  Ned Beatty is very convincing, playing Jim's down on his luck Korean War army pal, in ""Return To The 38th Parallel"".

The nature of the grand jury system is explored in ""So Help Me God"", where Jim crosses paths with an aggressive prosecutor.  The confidence game, a Rockford Files specialty, is brilliantly played in ""There's One In Every Port"".  Defending a football player charged with murder, Beth needs Jim's help badly, in ""Crack Back"".  Old friends Gandolph Fitch (Isaac Hayes) and Marcus Hayes (Louis Gossett Jr.), return in ""Just Another Polish Wedding"".  A scene where the two men confront a group of white supremacists, is priceless.

This season also features a pair of outstanding and suspenseful two part adventures.  ""The Trees, the Bees, and T.T. Flowers"", features Strother Martin as Rocky's friend, who is put into a sanitarium, so his property can be taken from him.  In ""To Protect and Serve"", Joyce Van Patten gives a terrific performance, as a police ""buff"" who interferes with an investigation.  In addition, George Loros makes his first appearance, as hitman Anthony Gagglio.

With a nice variety of stories, Season Three features more of the quirky escapades that fans had come to love, with just a smidge more reality and sophistication.  For his work during this season, James Garner (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Great-Escape-1963/dp/B00BN3DUVE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Great Escape (1963)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Grand-Prix-1966/dp/B004PHE9F6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Grand Prix (1966)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Maverick-1957-62/dp/B007AAF3FK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Maverick (1957-62)</a>) would win an Emmy for his portrayal of Jim Rockford, who just becomes more enjoyable to watch, when he is well supported by his close friends.",1368921600,2,3411,5.716831683168317
2716340,5,B000LXGXY8,"With so much junk on current TV, it's a pleasure to be able to acquire classic TV series' like Rockford Files (and Matlock, Murder She Wrote, Columbo, Perry Mason and others). There are only one or two shows on TV these days worth watching (NCIS and Bones). Most of the shows on TV are vulgar, violent, unfunny and promote offensive social or sexual agendas. The comedies (both live and animated) are included in that description and even game shows (Jeopardy clues are starting to be Left-leaning or presented by left-leaning celebrities and celebrity politicians including the current residents of the White House which is disrespectful of the office in my opinion). The reality shows are unreal and stupid with most having mercenary goals. And don't even get me started on the low morals and quality of Saturday morning cartoons. My TV is usually nothing more than a monitor for my DVD collection.",1366156800,,900,4.927631578947368

Now I have to buy it again, and of course I have to watch all the same episodes all over again to make sure the new set plays properly.

5 emmys the All-Time # 1 PI series. James Garner {Jim Rockford}, Noah Beery {Rocky},
Joe Santos {Dennis}, Stuart Margolin {Angel}.
Rockford always got the oddball cases that put him in tight spots; beat up often, lots of car chases, but he always managed to come out on top with his cons & routines. Co-star his Pontiac Firebird Classic Sports Car, {The Rockfordmobile}, that out-ran all the baddies. His Texas characters, printing press, and routines are classics! Began as a spin-off from Jack Webb's Adam-12, laid the groundwork for the series, with Jim in trouble with the law. (Jim, Jimbo, Jimmy) almost NEVER got paid!
Feb 2005 James Garner received the 41st Lifetime Achievement Award

Season 1 : 23 mostly great eps including 9 Classics! Season 2 : 22 mostly great eps including 8 Classics! Season 3 : 22 mostly great eps including 8 Classics! Season 4 : 21 mostly great eps including 14 Classics! Season 5 : 22 mostly great eps only 6 Classics though, Season 6 was a HALF SEASON CRAPPY 12 eps NOT UP TO James Garner's standard, only 2 were any good, which is partly why the show was cancelled. I DID NOT BUY SEASON 6!!!

SEASON 4 IS BY FAR THE BEST SEASON 14 / 21 eps = 67% CLASSICS!!!

If Universal would release the 2nd DVD of Rockfird Files 1990s Movies.....
If WB would just release Bret Maverick The Lazy Ace (1980) the world would be a better place.",1332374400,3,1421,4.564705882352941

2716369,5,B000LXGXY8,"When I first ordered the Rockford Files, I thought it would be an occasional good hour of entertainment, and it would be suitable to replace Columbo, which my wife liked.  She generally would lie down on the couch with Perry Mason reruns and fall asleep, asking me who the killer was at the end of the episode.  Columbo would keep her interest too, and she only occasionally might doze off.  However, once we started watching Rockford, she became intensely interested in the plots and the actors.  The first and second years' episodes were terrific, and the third Rockford is no drop-off in quality.  How the writers manage to come up with a story-line that finds its way to his trailer is perhaps the most intriguing thing about Rockford episodes.  Somehow, fact situations that seem to have no relevance to his existence meander in his direction; some times on purpose when he is framed or set up by someone he knows or doesn't know he gets involved; and in some cases just by his own negligence he's in too deep.  Nevertheless, by virtue of his guile, quick-thinking, luck, driving skills, or some other inexplicable ending, he lives to meet his next dilemna.  Whatever they have done in manufacturing these episodes, they get a five star rating, based on my entertainment standards, as well as my wife's alertness, interest, enjoyment, and positive comments.  Now I don't have to tell her how the episode ends.  I can't wait to order the 4th year!",1284076800,2,1451,4.768

2716395,5,B000LXGXY8,"Rockford's 1976-77 Season is awesome and is even better and more upgraded than Rockford's first 2 seasons and probably the best season of them all throughout the ROCKFORD FILES whole 6-year run on NBC since the action on this detective drama seemed to have gotten better and more sophisticated as the seasons progressed with more car chases, more brawling scenes, more homicide cases, more mischief with the down-on-his-luck private-eye Jim Rockford(James Garner) sleazy persuasive ex-con buddy Angel Martin(Stu Margolin), more dilemma for Rockford's often flustered cop buddy Det. Dennis Becker(Joe Santos) from the LAPD, etc. along with the fact that this private detective show was still in its honeymoon phase doing well in the ratings.

In addition to that, this was also the season when James Luisi joins the cast & crew of the show as Becker's hard-nosed superior officer(Lt. Doug Chapman) a.k.a. ""Chappy"" along with the fact that Rockford's Third Season had more episodes with my favorite character which was Rockford's drop-dead gorgeous attorney girlfriend Beth Davenport(Gretchen Corbett) than any other season, plus this seemed to be the season when Beth was at the peak of her appearance and career on this show along with the fact that Beth even helped out Angel in the ""Drought At Indianhead River"" episode, but what I don't understand is why didn't Beth come out in ""The Becker Connection"" episode when Dennis got suspended by his superiors for a false accusation since Beth would've really came in handy and helped Becker out a lot since Becker could've really used an attorney in that episode like his superiors suggested and Beth would've tried to make Chappy along with the rest of Becker's superiors to at least consider the possibility that Becker was innocent all along.

Unfortunately Gretchen Corbett(Beth)was abruptly dropped from the show in the middle of Rockford's 4th Season back in the Winter of 1978, due to a salary dispute with Universal leaving us to mourn the loss of Beth in the last 2 1/2 seasons of this detective drama.

Rockford's 3rd Season also takes me all the way back to memory lane when I used to watch the ROCKFORD FILES every Friday night on NBC, plus I used to think it was so cool how Rockford would always cruise around from place to place around the whole L.A. Area in his bronze Pontiac Firebird to get around and how Rockford often wore snazzy 3-piece suits and lived an eccentric lifestyle since Rockford lived in a small ragged trailer in a parking lot in beautiful Malibu by the beach over by the famous Pacific Coast Highway near the famous Malibu Pier, yet Rockford's Firebird was often racked up, Rockford was often beat up by hoodlums, often shot at and was often in trouble with Becker's often skeptical superior officers Lt. Diehl(Tom Atkins)and Lt. Chapman(James Luisi)who detested Rockford and did whatever they could to get Rockford busted and use any excuse imaginable to get his P.I. license cancelled which frequently got Becker in a lot of hot water with Diehl and Chapman as well, yet I find it kind of odd why Diehl didn't appear even once in this season, but had came out in the 1st, 2nd, and 4th Seasons of the ROCKFORD FILES.

It was also interesting seeing guest stars like
*Gerald McRaney before he was even a star in the ""Rattlers' Class of '63"" episode before his co-starring days as the short-tempered gonzo PI(Rick Simon)on SIMON & SIMON & before his co-starring days on MAJOR DAD and TOUCHED BY AN ANGEL

*Mary Carver in the ""Dirty Money, Black Light"" episode before her co-starring days as Rick & AJ Simons long suffering, but loving mother(Cecilia Simon) on SIMON & SIMON

*William Daniels in the ""So Help Me God"" episode before his co-starring days of playing Dr. Mark Craig on ST. ELSEWHERE and being the voice of KITT on KNIGHT RIDER

*Jon Cypher in the ""To Protect & To Serve"" episode before his days on MAJOR DAD and HILL STREET BLUES

*Roger Mosley in the ""Dirty Money, Black Light"" episode before his co-starring days as Magnum's faithful old Navy buddy from the Vietnam war(T.C.)on MAGNUM, P.I.

*Jim Sikking in ""The Becker Connection"" episode before his co-starring days as Lt. Howard Hunter on HILL STREET BLUES

*Singer Isaac Hayes making a returning appearance as ex-con Gandy Fitch in the ""Another Polish Wedding"" episode

*Sharon Gless in ""The Fourth Man"" episode before her co-starring days on the police drama CAGNEY & LACEY

*Veronica Hamel in the ""Return Of The 38th Parallell"" episode before her co-starring days as the gorgeous attorney(Joyce Davenport) on HILL STREET BLUES

*Lou Gossett, Jr. in the ""Another Polish Wedding"" episode before his co-starring days as Walt Shepherd on the short-lived series THE POWERS OF MATTHEW STAR

*Richard Venture in ""The Trees, The Bees, & The T.T. Flowers"" episode before his co-starring days as the exasperated superior officer(Cmdr. Altobelli)on the short-lived STREET HAWK

*Susan Howard in the ""Feeding Frenzy"" episode before her co-starring days on DALLAS

*Noble Willingham from WALKER TEXAS RANGER in the episode "" Coulter City Wildcats ""

*Joan Van Ark from KNOTTS LANDING and YOUNG & THE RESTLESS in the episode "" There's One In Every Port ""

*Ron Rifkin from ONE DAY AT A TIME in the episode "" The Trouble With Warren ""
This 1976-1977 Season was probably one of Rockford's best seasons since it was during the days way before the ROCKFORD FILES had to cancel all of the sudden back in January of 1980 due to James Garner's chronic back & knee problems and getting a slight dip in the Nielsen ratings thru much newer more popular shows like the DUKES OF HAZZARD, which obviously ended up K.O.ing Rockford when the Dukes made their debut on CBS in January of 1979, especially since the Dukes were in their honeymoon phase back then and Rockford no longer was.

Rockford's 3rd Season also takes me all the way back to memory lane to the fact that I was 4 years old living in the Imperial Valley at the time in my boring hometown(El Centro, CA).

The one thing I always found so intriguing about this private detective drama was the often festidious Jim Rockford(James Garner) was not only a bachelor, a Vietnam Veteran, and a pardoned ex-con now turned private investigator who lived on a shoe-string budget like Mannix(Mike Connors), Magnum(Tom Selleck), and Rick & AJ Simon(Gerald McRaney, Jameson Parker)did, but Rockford still seemed to have talent just like the Simon brothers did which often helped Rockford, Rick, and A.J. solve their cases along with the fact that the often fastidious Rockford had Becker from the LAPD to rely on just like the Simon brothers had their streetwise cop buddies Det. Marcel ""Downtown"" Brown(Tim Reid)and then Lt. Abigail Marsh(Joan McMurtry)from San Diego P.D. on SIMON & SIMON.

In addition to that, Rockford always managed to always have spiffy clothes, snazzy 3-piece suits, his fancy bronze Firebird and still manage to afford living in Malibu, despite the fact that Rockford was often snookered by his clients, never had a lovely home, never had much money, never had a steady private-eye business, never had an office of his own, had his answering machine at his trailer taking calls from potential clients instead of a leggy secretary answering the phone at an office & was never rolling in bucks either since Rockford was just barely making ends meet struggling to make a living just like Mannix, Magnum, and Rick and AJ Simon all did, plus Rockford's lifestyle was a little eccentric just like Rick and AJ's was since Rockford always left his gun in a cookie-jar and lived in a rusty trailer in a parking lot by Malibu Beach just like Rick lived on a boat in the backyard of his baby brother AJ's house.

It was also great being able to watch all these episodes of Rockford complete & uncut just like they were originally shown on their original air-dates on NBC, not like they were shown with lots of deleted scenes with too many commercial interruptions like when they were shown in reruns on Cozi-TV,  Me-TV, WGN, TV Land, TNN, and A&E.

So now that Universal has just about all 6 seasons of the ROCKFORD FILES released on DVD and all 8 seasons of MAGNUM, P.I. released on DVD and SIMON & SIMON's first 2 seasons are out on DVD and since Paramount has MANNIX's first 2 seasons out on DVD, I'm hoping this has inspired Warner Bros. to release MATT HOUSTON with Lee Horseley & Pamela Hensley out on DVD soon, starting with MATT HOUSTON's 1st Season, since MATT HOUSTON was also a popular private detective show too just like the ROCKFORD FILES, MAGNUM, MANNIX, and SIMON & SIMON all were.

Fortunately I just got word that Paramount will finally be releasing the detective drama MATT HOUSTON-Season 1 out on DVD on Tuesday March 9th, 2010 and that Shout will be releasing SIMON & SIMON-Season 4 out on DVD on Tuesday April 6th, 2010 and are now both available for pre-order which gives us 2 private detective dramas underway to look forward to for the Spring of 2010.",1227139200,6,8966,4.840627041149576

I also often watched the reruns on the ""midnight double feature"" on ABC.I have a great love for the program. I met James Garner at an airport in New York in 1990. I was working the security check point and he just walked through like it was no big deal. I was speechless. I spent my whole dinner break talking with him. People were looking at him, recognizing him, but couldn't place who he was. He got a big kick out of that. It was a day I'll never forget. He is a very nice guy. The show deserves every accolade that it gets. They just don't write 'em likey used to. 1977 was the breakthough year for the Firebird. Liked it so much I bought a '77 Firebird in 1999 and restored it to look just like Jim Rockford's. I did a reverse 180's or ""J"" turn in my car once and only once. It was fun.

2716400,5,B000LXGXY8,"Season three of The Rockford Files continues the same high standard of the previous two seasons. There are a total of 22 episodes plus an episode from season four that's the bonus material. Jim Rockford is on the prowl, doing cases. And like before, sometimes he gets paid, sometimes he doesn't &, occasionally, he does a case for nothing. Stuart Margolin as Angel is more prominent as is Gretchen Corbett as Beth Davenport. The romantic angle between Rockford & Davenport is completely gone though you can tell they like one another. Joe Santos as Sgt. Dennis Becker has a more prominent role in this season, we even see his wife in a couple of episodes.

Major guest stars abound in this season; Sharon Gless (Cagney & Lacey), Cleavon Little (Blazing Saddles), Isaac Hayes (recording artist most notably known for ""Shaft""), Lou Gossett, Jr. (who had co-starred with Garner in 1971's Skin Game), Ned Beatty, Strother Martin & Robert Loggia.
Season three is where Garner finally won the Emmy for Best Actor in a Dramatic Series. Garner deserved the award & should've won it more times than he did. He's such an excellent actor that most of us don't realize that's what he's doing.

There isn't an episode here that isn't entertaining. Sure, some are better than others but not any you want to miss. Garner even does a turn at being a director for one episode. As it says on the box: ""This is classic entertainment you can't afford to miss"".",1212883200,3,1440,4.733067729083666

To newer viewers I would say that The Rockford Files has some of the finest stories and acting that ever were on television. If you like more contemporary shows such as The Sopranos you may really appreciate The Rockford Files, as the show delves deeply into the psychology of a ""private eye"" and his personal battles as well as telling a great story. To the show's credit I cannot think of a weak episode. The show is also an entertaining window into the Los Angeles of the 1970s -- the cars, the clothes, the restaurants, the lifestyle, and the social mores. Finally, James Garner's Rockford is such an interesting character -- basically a nice guy, funny, sarcastic, smart, gullible, brilliantly played by Garner.

2716449,4,B000LXGXY8,"Seasons 1 and 2 of ""The Rockford Files"" were good, but had flaws. Season 1 was plagued by padded scripts, with pacing issues and meandering (at times) storylines. Season 2 tightened the pace, but saw Jim Rockford being used and abused by what seemed like everyone in Los Angeles. Viewers preferred (as other reviewers here have noted) the Rockford who was a step ahead, cunning and crafty and being the artist rather than the victim in a con.

Season 3 has been my favorite of the series thus far, with the combination of taut scripts, strong guest performances and the performance of James Garner. Rockford here is as he should be - sly, rumpled, a little bit cowardly and very clever. If you're a new viewer to the show, I would recommend starting with Season 3, because it is the most consistent of the seasons currently available.

Highlights from this set: ""So Help Me God"" (Jim faces down an overzealous prosecutor); ""Sticks and Stones..."" (Simon Oakland and Cleavon Little as friendly rivals who team with Jim on a case); ""Just Another Polish Wedding"" (with Isaac Hayes and Lou Gossett, Jr.); and ""Crack Back,"" when Jim protects Beth from a stalker.

The only weak spot is the lack of a retrospective interview. Seasons 1 and 2 had comments from Garner and Stephen Cannell. Instead, we get a bonus episode from Season 4. But this is nothing to sneeze at. ""Quickie Nirvana"" is a solid episode that was penned by ""Sopranos"" creator David Chase, and it is ""The Rockford Files"" at its best.",1177286400,7,1493,4.712643678160919

Refreshing my memory by recently purchasing all 3 seasons, season 3 is my least favorite. Besides a season 4 bonus episode, no real added bonuses to this season. As in my other columns, favorite episodes were ""Profit and Loss"" from season 1 as well as 3 from season 2 including the ""Great Blue Lake"" real estate scam, the Becker real estate swindle w/ Linda Evans, and the basketball episode w/ Lou Gossett.

The Season Three release, like Season Two, contains single-sided disks--the dreaded Universal double-sided disks are gone, and with them, hopefully, the freezing and skipping problems that so many people reported with the Season One set. Here's hoping Universal has learned a lesson from the shoddy Rockford Season One and ""Kolchak: The Night Stalker"" releases and will give us nothing but high-quality, reliable DVDs in the future.",1173398400,5,726,5.161016949152542
2716526,5,B000LXGXY8,"The third season was the season where the show really took off, awards-wise and themse wise.  As someone what they remember about Rockford, and it'll be the scams and Jim's fights for lost causes.  Those elements were in the first two seasons, but in season three they really ""click"".

Watching the episodes on DVD now, it's interesting to see how many actors were used over and over again, but in different roles each time.  Almost like an acting troop where the same people do all the parts--but not quite!

Can't wait to get season 4!",1173225600,5,537,4.610526315789474
2716527,5,B000LXGXY8,"What more can be said about James Garner as James Rockford that hasn't been said? How one actor can be suave and intimidating all within the same breath is breathtaking. He just had it. The Rockford Files like all the greats are just a culmination of all the right actors clocking in at Universal at all the right times. Call it one part luck / one part science. And I LOVE it when I see for any various episode ""Special Guest star Gretchen Corbett"" because that means my heart will be skipping a beat when 'Beth' Davenport makes an appearance. Joe Santos was simply perfect for the disgruntled ""Becker"" and of course Noah Beery Jr. as Joseph ""Rocky"" Rockford lent the personal touch.

The packaging and artwork are once again BEAUTIFUL! One sided non-freezing discs (unlike the A TEAM!) are always a bonus, put that together with a solid middle of the road price tag and you have a purchase that shouldn't be missed by anyone that has any interest in; the 70's, humor, car chases, love interests, clever writing, solid chemistry, or sarcasm.

2716528,5,B000LXGXY8,"During the second season of ""The Rockford Files"" the ratings slumped a bit--fans hated seeing Rockford turned into a chump by the clients he often represented which is too bad because they missed a great season. The third season finds Jim in the driver's seat driving the stories and the ratings improved allowing the show to continue on for a nice long run. Featuring a parade of great guest stars including Sharon Gless, character actor Robert Walden as a psychic working on a case Jim had  and top notch writing by Juanita Bartlett and David Chase (who would go on the create ""The Sorpranos""), the third season looks extremely good with minimal dirt, debris and the uncut episodes. As usual the terrific supporting including Joe Santos, the lovely Gretchen Corbett, Stuart Margolin and Noah Berry Jr. provide color and humor.

The only extra we get here is ""Quickie Nirvana"" an episode from the fourth season (written by David Chase) and while I don't mind having a preview of succeeding great seasons (and ""Quickie Nirvana"" is an extremely good episode), I'd rather see Universal include some interviews with some of the cast including Gretchen Corbett as Beth(am I the only kid who was in love with her when she was on the show? The show had a gaping hole when she left)who stepped in often as Jim's attorney.

Either way this is a top notch season and well worth getting.",1172707200,14,1377,4.7531380753138075
2716529,5,B000LXGXY8,"Remember when you could flip the TV on and in general, you had a choice of some pretty good shows - i.e. Magnum PI / Miami Vice / etc.

You NEVER had to worry back then about Dancing With The Stars or Grease or any one of a thousand pathetic reality TV shows.

Is it any wonder that so many of us will glom onto these DVDs of great old television shows.

But in my opinion, The Rockford Files was at or very close to the top of the list.

And I agree with a previous reviewer who stated that the show really hit its stride in this season. In fact, I personally loved this season for the introduction of Lt Chapman alone. Of course, Rockford and ""Chappie"" (as Lance White called him) bumped heads right from the get-go and poor old Chapman was usually (always..??) on the receiving end of some of Jimbo's best barbs..!! Seriously, was there anybody on TV who could turn a phrase as well as our world-weary cynical friend Rockford..??

This show was a classic example of a brilliant marriage between the writers, who consistently churned out some of the best scripts week in and week out / year in and year out and the star, James Garner. Nobody could deliver the lines or conjure up scams as well as Garner / Rockford.

And was it just me or did anybody secretly wish that just once, they'd like to see Rockford solve a case and enjoy a big pay day instead of having to hear yet another excuse why he was going to be stiffed on his fee..???!!

This was a great, great series and I'm so grateful that we can now enjoy these episodes again 30 years later (God, was it really thirty years ago that this show ran on television..???!!)

Yikes..!!!!",1172620800,15,1642,4.308441558441558
2716530,5,B000LXGXY8,"It was in this season that the series had many of its finest episodes.

Although there is no such thing as a ""bad"" episode of Rockford Files, and I would give five stars to each season, it was in this season that series really hit its stride. In the first season, most episodes were about Rockford helping some beautiful ""damsel in distress"", even ones who get involved  with mobsters.  In the second season, we see Jim getting into serious trouble frequently because he allows himself to be used as a patsy, even by close friends, and frankly, this sometimes gets on my nerves, even if it is by the otherwise lovable Angel Martin (it should be pointed out that the audience didn't care for this either since the ratings for the show declined during that season). However, in Season 3 there was a major turnaround.  We now see stories about Jim encountering real problems and real abuses people have with the police and other institutions who often abuse their power. For example, there is the two-part episode ""The Bees, the Trees and T T Flowers"" where Strother Martin puts in a fine performance of a eccentric older man who is falsely declared senile and incompetant in order to gain control of his property.  Another excellent two-parter is ""To Protect and to Serve"" where Joyce Van Patten plays a lonely, bitter woman who's only pleasure in life is hanging around the police (who mistakenly allow it) and secretly enjoying seeing other peoples' tragedies. Another episode, which is James Garner's favorite is one where he is jailed for contempt of court, showing the abuses of the District Attorney's powers to compel people to testify, in defiance of their concience. It was also in this season the Rockford's biggest police nemesis, Lt Chapman, is introduced.

If someone wants a good introduction to the series, I would recommend this as the first DVD set to purchase.",1172102400,45,1876,4.8105590062111805
