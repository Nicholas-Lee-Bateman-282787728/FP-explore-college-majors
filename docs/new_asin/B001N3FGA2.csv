8323115,2,B001N3FGA2,"SLOW,SLOW,SLOW.  MY GRANDSON WILL BE ENTERING 1ST GRADE AND THESE 3 DVD'S ARE WAY TOO BORING AND EASY FOR HIM. THEY MIGHT BE OK FOR A CHILD WHO HAS NOT ATTENDED SCHOOL. MY GRANDSON WAS WATCHING THIS KIND OF STUFF AT TWO AND THREE YEARS OF AGE. A BIG WASTE OF MONEY ON MY PART. I WILL DONATE THEM TO THE LIBARY FOR YOUNGER CHILDREN.",1280448000,,331,4.092307692307692
8323116,4,B001N3FGA2,"This was a great video for first graders, they went through how much each coin was worth, what color the coin was.  Some of the songs were boring, but my first graders enjoyed this video",1271980800,,186,4.314285714285714
8323117,5,B001N3FGA2,"My 3 year old loves these videos and she is learning, no doubt. Each video has catchy rhymes and rhythm to help kids remember what they need to know. Physical movement and hand motions are also used to engage the hands on and physical learner.  I frequently find my three year old chanting and clapping the song to herself along with the hand motions.

The DVDs come with hands on activities and games too. The website has even more fun learning games to do with your kids.",1263772800,,473,4.425287356321839
8323118,5,B001N3FGA2,"At 3 years of age, our son has learned to tell time (e.g. months, days, hours, minutes), and identify money and it's value through the use of these DVDs.  Also, the shape DVD is an excellent resource that described both 2-D and 3-D shapes in a fun way for kids.  They learn about octagons, heptagons, hexagons, pentagons, trapazoids, rhombus(i.e. diamond), squares/rectangles, ovals, circles, cubes, spheres, cones, and more.  Well worth the $50 price for this 3-set collection.  Highly recommend for young advanced minds as a starter to all these real world concepts!

Update 10/2012:
My kids watched these up through about grade K.  I do not think they would  be well suited for older children - first graders, and up.  I think the Rock 'n Learn video series would be better for older children.

Here are links to the Rock 'n Learn videos which are better suited for older children:

My 6 (almost 7) year old first grader is doing 6th grade math.  He learns at a much faster rate than most children due to long attention span and amazing memory.  Did these videos help him - I think so.  Our 5 year old Kindergartner is doing 2nd/3rd grade math work.  If you have young quick learners like my children, I would like to recommend to you the following videos while your children are still very young (5 or younger):

Leapfrog has some very good videos for preschool children as well, but the material does not tackle anything higher than single digit addition and subtraction.",1254614400,2,2753,7.832258064516129
8323119,1,B001N3FGA2,"How can anyone rate these videos ""5 stars""?  Don't let the cartoon characters on the cover fool you.  If you want to ignore my warnings, at the very least, do not buy the box set.  Buy one first, and judge for yourself.

The hour hand is oh so short... The minute hand is oh so long?

Very disappointing and not worth the money.  My wife will not let me down for buying this garbage (She quietly left the room after watching the first ten minutes).  Even worse, I felt horrible watching my 4 year old suffer through these videos.  My kid has watched and enjoyed many other children videos (like sesame street and the rock n'learn series).  This series is the first, which did not garner my son's interest.",1254441600,,705,4.403100775193798
8323120,5,B001N3FGA2,I've never heard a negative comment about this series and I've had them for over a year.  My children's teachers also rave about them - from PreK through 1st grade!  I think the key point here is that the kids LOVE them and they remember the concepts - isn't that what we're trying to achieve here?,1238112000,,298,4.303571428571429
8323121,3,B001N3FGA2,"This was not at all what I was expecting.  Based on so many rave reviews, I thought this was a sure winner, but NO.  The ""songs"" are not even songs... the preschool equivalent of the Hot Pockets theme song, i.e. poorly written, thrown together.  While I have to admit my 4-year-old loves them and watches them often, I can't say yet whether they will actually help her learn these concepts.  (Her desire for them are the sole reason I bumped my review up to 3 stars.)  This is the first time I've truly been disappointed upon ordering a product after researching what others had to say about it.  Definitely not worth the money - stick to Sesame Street and pocket the 40 bucks.",1238025600,,677,4.463414634146342
