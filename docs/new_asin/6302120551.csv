429455,4,6302120551,"The best thing about this movie is Cole Porter's timeless music.  The arrangements and performances (other than Cary Grant's) are terrific, although some of the choreography and set designs are a little odd for the songs they were intended for.

The casting of Cary Grant as Cole Porter was atrocious.  He can't sing and his dialogue delivery is mechanical and manic.  I would have much more preferred Fred Astaire in the title part.

Monty Wooley stole the show.

The biggest thing you need to do when watching this movie is to remember that very little of it is factual.  VERY little.  Cole and Linda were not introduced by a relative of Cole's, they met at a party in Europe. Linda was a very wealthy divorcee and it was rumored but never proven that she was a lesbian; she WAS, however, a battered wife and was looking more for a marriage of convenience than anything else. It was a well known ""secret"" that Cole was gay, which Linda knew when she asked him to marry her.  Linda financed Cole's lifestyle in exchange for his companionship and affection.  Cole never did military service, certainly wasn't wounded in battle and never walked with a cane prior to his horseback riding accident - he was too vain.  Linda was at Cole's side from the moment of the accident, throughout the course of the 34 surgeries he underwent, until she died of emphysema.  They did, however, have a genuine love for each other, no matter how unconventional their marriage was.

Rather than watching this movie as a biography of Cole Porter's life, just watch it as a really good musical.  You'll definitely enjoy it.",1468368000,,1602,4.695340501792114

The artistry, the genius of Cary Grant, had reached new heights in this movie. The make-up crew gave Cary Grant character's face, here, a heavy applications throughout, so at times he has this haunted look. But it is our brilliant Cary Grant all the same. Again you have to see it to believe it. Unsurpassed! Thrown into the ""package"" here is one of the most beautiful musical-ballet combination titled ""The Beguine"". The theme, the delivery of choreography, the colors, costumes, all in all, it is a piece of art delivered by Michael Curtiz and repeatedly it gives me an  unforgettable two hours of joy, whenever I see it.

429614,4,6302120551,"A great break from current movies! The story line is actually carried by the actors. (No special effects, car crashes, or explosions.) Wry humor throughout (pay attention to the dialogue and you'll be chuckling at something in almost every scene.) The music is truly exceptional and builds this feel-good movie to its dramatic conclusion. I watched it first in a theater at a Cole Porter festival, then a week later the Amazon Instant version. There are slight differences but both were enjoyable.

This is a wonderful story that is a popularization of Cole Porter's life (it only vaguely resembles the real thing), but the music is all Cole Porter. I had not expected more than a ho-hum old movie experience at the time. It turned out to be the most enjoyable movie I'd seen in a very long time.

429688,2,6302120551,"Songwriter Cole Porter has one of the most recognizable song catalogs; Cary Grant has one of the most recognizable profiles and speaking voices, yet this film did nothing to add to the others artistic legacy.  This movie may have been popular when it came out, but it has not aged well and the movie barely held my attention.  There is no real plot. With that said, there is a feeble attempt to portray Porters life, but the script is so watered down there is no feeling of drama or authenticity.  Grants acting skills were barely flexed and his affable skills nearly wasted.  This film appears to have been an attempt to cash in on the popularity of Cary Grant and Cole Porter, and from what Ive read, with little of the expected success.  Cole Porter fans would do better to watch De-Lovely starring Kevin Kline.",1433116800,,814,4.586206896551724

Just because the movie makers left out all the facts, like Cole Porter being gay and married only for the convenience of the presentation to the public. They didn't touch much on the horrible injuries he received when he fell from his horse, and how he had to live much of his life in pain. Oh, and sorry but Cole Porter wasn't much of a looker - he certainly was no Cary Grant. But, that being said, it's a light musical; something to have on the tube while you're doing a jigsaw puzzle on a snowy day.

429991,3,6302120551,"It goes almost without saying that if you don't really like the songs of Cole Porter, you won't like this movie about his life, which includes renditions of  MANY well-known SONGS that earned him his reputation as a lyric genius.  I'm not sure whether I really like Porter's songs (and won't take time here to analyze why I might not), but every time I get bored or irritated with one of them and turn it off halfway through, I seem to like it a little better the next time I hear it!  Some Porter songs I like/dislike better/worse than others.  For me, a lot depends on how they're done and who sings them.  I really do like the powerful version of ""Night and Day"" that Ronan Tynan sings in his album ""The Impossible Dream.""

If you happen not to like Porter's songs very much, there are still things about this movie that are really remarkable and dazzling and worth seeing.  The lush use of COLOR is just truly marvelous.  There is dramatically beautiful color in the scenery, as with the outstanding snow and sled scenes of the Christmas season set at the home of Cole Porter's parents early in the movie.  There's also marvelous color in the costumes and clothing which are stunning examples of typical 1940s  Hollywood GLAMOUR in its hey-day when this movie was made in 1946.  The rapidly changing melange of beautiful COSTUMES AND FASHIONS here, as the film progresses, is 100% noticeably gorgeous.  In my estimation, the costume and fashion designs are at a level of highly realized art.  For anyone whose taste runs to exquisite costumery and clothing, this movie would be quite enjoyable.  If you are too bored by the Porter songs and dances, and a plot which may seem (as it does to me) to be presented in a shallow and non-compelling way, why not turn down the sound and fast-forward the speed, which is what I did.  That way you can get the visual beauty, which is considerable, without wasting a lot of time on the other elements that may strike you as too trivial.  Even though after I got about halfway through and decided to watch most of the movie speeded up, I slowed it to normal speed a lot of times in order to briefly enjoy beautiful ladies' dresses or bits of certain songs.

This movie is also enjoyable because of the presence of Alexis Smith, a movie star you don't see very often.  There's a sophisticated grace in her portrayal of Porter's wife Linda that reminds me of Grace Kelley.

Cary Grant, who looks nothing at all like Cole Porter, was entirely wrong, I thought, in the part of Cole, and the disparity in appearance and personality was one large factor in causing me to consider the movie an unsuccessful biography of Porter.  The personality of Cary Grant is so distinctive that no matter what he does to change it, he always seems to be just that charismatic character known as ""Cary Grant"" and no one else.  It was clear that he was attempting to portray painful, anguished, unhappy emotions in Porter, but, somehow, I could not manage to meld together his acting/face/figure with what I knew of Porter's appearance/personality.  Also, there was an overall clash between the movie's romantic love-story elan and the anguished, deficient, sexual elements suggested by the movie but never explained.  The troubled elements of Porter's personality were very EVIDENT in the story but came across as just an inexplicable surface mystery.  His love for Linda, as presented, seemed dispassionate, not really believable, actually maybe non-existent, so, as love story, the movie was not satisfying.  As love story, it was frustrating, just as Porter's and Linda's real life marriage probably was.  Yet, in the movie, no reason for Porter's seeming lack of real ""chemistry"" for Linda is ever given.

If you want to see what Cole Porter really looked like, he played himself in a brief scene at the beginning of a filmed musical he wrote called ""Kiss Me, Kate,"" a story about contemporary theater people that contains some plot elements based on ""The Taming of the Shrew"" by Shakespeare.",1311465600,,4017,4.742446043165468

429993,2,6302120551,"I absolutely LOVE Cary Grant but after watching this once into the sale pile it goes. I also really enjoy Cole Porter songs as sung by Fred Astaire but these huge Hollywood productions were silly, overly contrived and I wanted to fast forward through most of them. Mary Martin was cute but whose idea was to have the men as Eskimos and her in a fur outfit with a swimming suit underneath? I hope this is not what they had on stage in the real production! Monty Woolley and Jane Wyman really stole the show. I didn't know she could be so perky so that was a delightful surprise and Monty is always fun! And as a huge fan of the under rated Eve Arden what a joy to see her as a believable French woman! She looked fabulous and had the accent and clothing down. I was so happy to see her small part in this otherwise pretty forgettable film.
I couldn't help thinking that the real love affair was between Monty and Cole not Linda and Cole! At the very end when Cole and Linda hug the look on Cole's face reminded me of a vampire. He certainly didn't look happy and I thought it was odd. Then I recalled hearing that Porter was gay or bi and so it made more sense.
The sets for the songs were way too corny for me and some of the costumes were lovely but some just silly. The color was so so. Poor Cary was pretty stiff during most of it. Compare this film to ""Holiday"" where he is all charm and fun. Alexis is fine but she is always too proper for me. All in all I won't keep it but it was Ok for a rainy day flick. Cary made so many more films that are delightful that this goes on the bottom of my list along with Mr. Lucky, Monkey Business and Arsenic and Old Lace.",1300060800,,1665,4.0638297872340425
429994,3,6302120551,"Those reviewers who warn and complain about the highly fictionalized version of Cole Porter's life in this movie are absolutely correct, but that is one of the central points of the movie. For a more complete portrait of one of America's greatest composers, I urge you to see another magnificent, but terribly under-appreciated film on the dual nature of Porter's life and music--""De Lovely.""  Both Kevin Kline and Ashley Judd do a wonderful job of portraying the complicated nature of Porter and his relationship with his wife, Linda Lee Thomas, as well as the importance of their relationship for the evolution of Porter's wonderful music.  The movie is even more fun because the musical score is sung by a Hall of Fame pop musical and Broadway theater cast dressed in period costumes and making all of Porter's greatest songs come to life.  The combination of both ""De Lovely"" and ""Night and Day"" will make clear all of the different aspects of Porter's life and highlight the changes over the years in Hollywood's biographical portrayals",1295568000,,1041,4.971264367816092

429999,4,6302120551,"If you can forgive the sad fact that the movie bears very little in common with the accurate life story of Cole Porter, then NIGHT AND DAY (1946) can be enjoyed for it's treasure trove of musical performances; but as a genuine screen biography of the composer, it falls decidedly flat.

Cary Grant stars as the tunesmith who gave us such standards as ""I Get a Kick Out of You"", ""Anything Goes"", ""Begin the Beguine"" and ""Let's Do It"", in this most loose recreation of Cole Porter's early career, leading up to the horse-riding accident which left him crippled.  Porter's devoted wife Linda is played with charm and poise by Alexis Smith, who comes off quite well.

In reality, Porter was bisexual and his marriage to Linda (a divorce who had endured abuse in her previous relationship) was a mutually supportive ""arrangement"", although they did love each other very much.  This of course couldn't be depicted on-screen in 1946 because of the strict censorship laws.

Adding flash to the musical portions are Ginny Simms (who somehow manages to make us forget the non-presence of Ethel Merman in the ""Anything Goes"" sequences); and Mary Martin recreating her star-making turn (""My Heart Belongs to Daddy"") from ""Leave It to Me"".  Jane Wyman is a sparky chorus girl, and Monty Woolley plays himself.  Eve Arden has a small but enjoyable bit as a French music-hall singer.  Unlike MGM, Warners didn't have the largest pool of musical talents from which to pick and choose, but I think they did a good job with the casting in NIGHT AND DAY.  In hindsight, it might have been more appropriate to have been filmed in B&W, but the Technicolor photography definitely enhances the charm of the musical numbers.

Warner's DVD features a nice print (if a trifle washed-out in places); along with some choice shorts from the era (""Musical Movieland"", ""Desi Arnaz & His Orchestra""), and the Looney Tunes cartoon ""The Big Snooze"".

430050,2,6302120551,"Very little of the actual Cole Porter exists in ""Night and Day,"" a scrubbed-down version of the legendary Broadway songwriter's life. While Cary Grant is wonderfully charismatic, the movie itself is both fluffy and stretched out, with the holes patched by colourful musical numbers.

We're introduced to Cole (Grant) as he finishes one year at Yale, but disappoints his grandfather by saying that he's quitting to be a songwriter. He and his professor Monty Woolley (played by self) manage to scrounge up the money for a brilliant musical -- only to have World War I break out on opening night, thus destroying the show.

But after being injured, Cole regains his musical skills, with the help of his soon-to-be-wife Linda (Alexis Smith). Soon he's world-famous for his sparkling songs and brilliant dancing... but fame has a price, and Linda is growing tired of being second-fiddle to Cole's career. Things get even worse when he has a crippling fall from a horse.

Given that this movie was made in 1946, Porter gets the deluxe whitewashing -- inner demons, depression, chronic pain, homosexuality and a platonic marriage are all watered down into a typical Hollywood romance. Only the final close-up of Grant -- looking stiff and slightly ominous -- may hint at the lack of a storybook ending.

Unfortunately, the movie before it is rather corny, with melodramatic confrontations and the hokey handling of real-life tragedies (Porter's near-crippling). It's just fluff. And being turned into fluff, there's too little material included to spread around, so the filmmakers patched it with kitschy versions of Porter's songs, all in eyepoppingly garish colours. Okay, I loved that mad tap-dancing number, but that's about it.

Grant plays a purely fantasy Porter, but he does so with suave charm and style, as well as good chemistry with the elegant Alexis Smith. And Monty Woolley -- the real friend, albeit much older -- is fun as a professor with a great love of the theatre. He gets all of the funnier lines too (""The face and chin belong to me -- the beard belongs to the world"").

""Night and Day"" is an amusing fluff piece with good acting from Grant and Smith, but not much else to recommend it. It's too in love with Porter's songs and Technicolor to register a real story.",1166745600,,2282,4.914285714285715

Is it celebrating it, or does Grant's tortured look over Linda's shoulder betray darker, more forboding elements in their relationship. Be that as it may, they never really delve into Porter's life in any gripping, realistic way.  You can hear the music better performed many, many places.  It's fun to watch Wooley and Martins' performances, as well as the cameos by the likes of Eve Arden.

  If the viewer is looking for historical accuracy, it is best to look elsewhere.  There is a loose framework of historical accuracy here, but only a skeleton.  Porter actually did go to Yale, but only for undergrad.  He actually went to Harvard for law school.  As far as I know, he was never actually in World War I, although he was in Europe during the war. In addition, the love story is completely and utterly fabricated, although it is ""cute"" and a nice sub-plot to the film.

  The real driving force of the film is definitely the sets, the music, and Grant himself.  This is definitely an entertaining fantasy, and I highly recommend it for film buffs, especially those that love Cary Grant.

430077,2,6302120551,"Others have addressed the travesty this movie makes of Cole Porter's life, so I will not rehash. Historically, both Linda and Cole were supposed to have been quite pleased with the flic, which, given the times, probably was the only public reaction they could have had (I'd hope they laughed histerically in private).
On the plus side, we have Alexis Smith as beautiful and elegant as she always was, but younger (presumably Linda Lee Porter suggested her for the role); Jane Wyman vital and sparkling, as far removed from Douglas Sirk as one can imagine; Mary Martin innocently raunchy; Eve Arden putting on a French accent, straight-faced; and about the most gosh-awful-kitschiest rendition of Begin the Beguine I have ever seen, on or off film. Not campy but garish, it becomes fascinatingly repellent .... definitely worth seeing. It is the movie's ""Big Number"" .... seriously tasteless and ill-conceived, following relatively close on the heels -so to speak- of an acknowledged masterpiece: Begin the Beguine,  the ""Big Number"" in ""Broadway Melody of 1940,"" danced by Eleanor Powell and Fred Astaire.(Available in a pristine transfer to DVD).
What is absolutely shameful is the minimal care evidenced in the movie's transfer to DVD.  Scratches and dirt are easily discernible...... worst: whole sections go by in thoroughly faded technicolor, yet there are isolated spots when one is reminded how glorious the process could be.  It doesn't appear WB went to a negative but rather picked from various prints in varying degrees of deterioration.  I can think of many movies deserving full-fledged restoration before Night and Day,
but, c'mon...... surely Warner can do better than this.
WB partially redeems itself by including a musical short featuring a singing Desi Arnaz and His Band, and a truly charmless, through-composed oddity called ""Musical Movieland.""

430078,3,6302120551,"One of Broadway's most brilliant songwriters, Cole Porter (1891-1964) worked hard to present an unflappable image to the world--but in truth he was a tremendously complex man, a homosexual who lived with wife Linda Lee Thomas in a marriage of convenience, subject fits of depression, and suffering horrific pain in the wake of a horseback riding accident which left him crippled at the peak of his career.  Add to this the fact that his lyrics were often censored for film, radio, and records and it seems very odd that 1940s Hollywood would attempt a biography.

What they did, of course, was fictionalize it to the max, reducing the story of his life to a mix of backstage musical and domestic drama--and transforming the tiny and waspish Porter and his icy bride Linda into handsome Cary Grant and lovely Alexis Smith.  The result is pure nonsense, of course, but when you tack in a host of Porter classics--fantasy it might be, but it is entertaining enough to watch.

Grant is no singer, but he has considerable charm, and Smith is as always extremely attractive.  The supporting cast is remarkably strong, featuring the likes of Jane Wyman, Eve Arden, Dorothy Malone, and Alan Hale--and rare screen appearances by Monty Woolley and Mary Martin, who deliver knockout performances of ""Miss Otis Regrets"" and ""My Heart Belongs To Daddy"" respectively.  The DVD transfer is reasonable, and although the bonuses are pure fluff they are amusing.  While it may be short on fact with a story little more than pure melodrama, the music and performers make NIGHT AND DAY a reasonably pleasant way to spend a rainy afternoon.

430079,3,6302120551,"Cole Porter was a skinny, homely little guy from Peru, Indiana, who reinvented himself as an international sophisticate. And he was gay. Of course a movie of this era cannot be expected to deal with a subject that was then taboo. But casting the dashing Cary Grant as Cole Porter turns this movie into pure fantasy, if enjoyable fantasy. In the MGM musical about Rodgers and Hart, ""Words and Music,"" casting the role of Lorenz ""Larry"" Hart posed a similar problem. Hart was 4' 9"", alcoholic, and more or less openly gay. They at least made a stab at getting it right by casting the diminutive Mickey Rooney, and including many of Hart's mannerisms, such as his hyperactivity, penchant for smoking large cigars, and his habit of nervously rubbing his hands together. And there's a scene when Tom Drake as Rodgers gives Rooney a funny look when he he puts an arm on his shoulder while he is playing the piano. Very subtle but unmistakeable. Mickey Rooney as Hart is an honorable failure. The best that one can say about Cary Grant as Cole Porter is that Porter would certainly have liked to look like Grant. (And then there is ""Rhapsody in Blue,"" starring Robert Alda, who is a reasonable facsimile of the probably gay Gershwin, which invents two completely fictional female romantic interests for Gershwin, who never had any.) One piece of authenticity in the film is Monty Woolley, who was a classmate and friend of Porter at Yale. Monty was a scion of Manhattan high society, and Cole a social climber par excellence--and they both loved the theater. The music makes it all more than worthwhile--the high point for me being the great Mary Martin doing the song that made her a star, ""My Heart Belongs to Daddy.""",1073606400,,1712,4.71

7821637,4,6302120551,"Good movie which I hadn't seen in forever.  The story is entertaining...but basically myopic and just what we would expect from a 1946 era film however.  Love Cary Grant and Alexis smith...they are great in anything they do.  I didn't like the way Cole Porter's Homosexuality was minimized...even to the extent of making us feel sorry for his wife (Alexis Smith) without ever getting any closure upon HER situation or feelings. It is as though the director didn't finish the movie.  ""What's the rest of the story?"" ~  inquiring minds want to know.",1505952000,,547,4.838709677419355

7821639,3,6302120551,"This movie leaves you guessing just what the relationship of Cole Porter and his wife really was about. Confuses you at every turn of non- fact  See the movie ""De-Lovely"" instead, Then you know the basic story and can follow what is happening so much better.",1502582400,,258,4.608695652173913

7821641,5,6302120551,"This is a very pleasant musical based loosely on the life of Cole Porter.  Cole Porter is played by Cary Grant, a great actor and true Hollywood icon.  The movie highlights the vast array of songs authored by Cole Porter.

Although based on the life of Cole Porter, the are great liberties taken with Mr. Porter's actual biography.  When I was a youth I used to see movies such as this and mistook them for actual biographies.  The movie itself is stylistically dated.  As such it may not appeal to every modern viewer.  However it is a very fine movie with a very strong cast from this period.  Personally, I enjoyed it very much and am very glad I was able to see it.  Thank You...",1496880000,,683,4.357142857142857
