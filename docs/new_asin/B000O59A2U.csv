2791117,5,B000O59A2U,"The following review is limited to THE SONS OF KATIE ELDER.

The setting of this western is the town of Clearwater, TX (near Laredo), probably in the 1870's. The four sons of Katie Elder, who had not seen each other, or her, in years, come to her funeral. The eldest brother, John Elder (John Wayne), watches the funeral from a distance.

Why are some of the townspeople anxious for John Elder, a gunslinger, to leave the town as soon as possible after the funeral? The brothers do not get straight answers as to how it was that their mother had recently lost her property, and begin to smell a rat. They also learn that their father had been murdered, but no one will say who was responsible.

A woman who was a close friend of Katie Elder describes Mrs. Elder as a devout woman of character, and how disappointed she was in her four sons.  At least some of Katie Elder's sons mailed her letters and money, but had otherwise gone down the wrong paths in life. Mrs. Elder at least wanted one of them to go to college, but he balked. The woman did not want to discuss the murder of Mr. Elder because Katie Elder didn't want vengeance and further violence.

Three of the brothers wanted to fulfill their mother's wishes that the remaining one go to college, but he continues to balk. John Elder keeps the pressure on.

Sibling rivalry exists even in adulthood. At one time, all four brothers are involved in a brawl. At another time, they drag each other into a body of water.

The conspiracy of silence about Mrs. Elder's property and her murdered husband begins to unravel despite the current owners' persistent efforts to have it stifled. In time, the current owners of Mrs. Elder's property frame the four sons for murder. The local law enforcement officials seem ready to believe the charge with no evidence, and a lynch mob surrounds the prison. There is a massive shootout, and three of the four brothers are wounded. Will any of these three survive? Will they be able to clear the Elder name of the murder charge?",1189900800,6,2019,4.545454545454546

They get together and go on a drive to collect some horses their mother had purchased. You will enjoy this one.
The Shootist, He rides into town and visits the clinic of the local sawbones. Only to find out that the sickness
is not a wrong diagnosis by another doctor. He has but one chance, that is to go out in a blaze of gunfire.

2791145,5,B000O59A2U,"104us The shootist by Don Siegel (1976,100')

The Shootist is a 1976 Western film directed by Don Siegel and starring John Wayne in his final film role. Based on the 1975 novel of the same name by Glendon Swarthout with a screenplay written by Scott Hale and Miles Hood Swarthout (the son of the author), the film is about a dying gunfighter who spends his last days looking for a way to die with the least pain and the most dignity. The film co-stars Lauren Bacall, Ron Howard, Harry Morgan, and James Stewart. Upon its theatrical release in June 1976, The Shootist  was a minor success, earning nearly $6,000,000. It received fair-to-excellent reviews, with enormous praise given to Wayne by many critics.

The movie begins with a clip montage of some of John Wayne's earlier western movies, depicting the life of the legendary ""shootist"" (gunfighter) John Bernard (J B) Books. The aging Books and the Old West are dying. The film was shot on location in Carson City, Nevada and at the Warner Brothers Burbank Studios in California. Besides changing the location from El Paso to Carson City, and having his horse Dollor written in, Wayne also changed the ending of the screenplay. Books was supposed to shoot Jack Pulford in the back, and then Gillom Rogers was to shoot Books. Wayne said, ""Mister, I've made over 250 pictures and have never shot a guy in the back. Change it."" He also did not want the young Gillom killing him; this would have made the movie go in a different direction and Gillom's tossing away of the gun, thus rejecting the life of a gunman, gained Wayne's approval.

Wayne was also responsible for much of the film's casting: friends and past co-stars Lauren Bacall, James Stewart, Richard Boone and John Carradine were all cast at Wayne's request. Despite Wayne's influence on the film, Don Siegel denied claims that he and Wayne clashed, saying that ""He had plenty of his own ideas... and some I liked which gave me inspirations, and some I didn't like. But we didn't fight over any of it. We liked each other and respected each other.""
