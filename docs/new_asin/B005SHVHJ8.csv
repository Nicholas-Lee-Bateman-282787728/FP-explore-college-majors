8485143,3,B005SHVHJ8,"First I want to say that I enjoyed the DVD, and that I learned a lot. I would have given it a 3.5, if I could. They shipped the DVD the samd day that I ordered and I received very quickly so by that 1st week end I was making the bag. And as a 1st attempt it came out really well. A friend wanted to borrow it. That being said, they could do a few things to improve it. It starts with a supply list. The writing is white on a gray, light gray and white background so it was a little hard to read. Also they mentioned to use medium weight pellon. There are several types of pellon, so it would have been better for a beginning handbag maker if they said exactly what weight they use, then with that experience I could have been better to decide what weight I could use from then out. Everyone has a different opioion of what medium is. Also they need to get a script to go by and maybe do a voice over, there were lots of pauses and huh when they lost their train of thought. And this might help them to remember to mention things like what stitch length to use when construction. I used a 4. I had to depend a lot on my sewing experence to fill in some blanks that they missed. They obviously know what they are doing, the bags they showed, and the one I made were great. Last thing, they kept saying and kept saying how difficulty it was to show details on the black lining, well show it on a different color lining ! And yes, I will buy another DVD.",1343260800,4,1450,4.003448275862069
