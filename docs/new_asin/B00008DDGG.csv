a children's church or VBS setting.",1257033600,,123,4.125
1835826,4,B00008DDGG,"Although my 5 year old grandson was impatient for Charleton Heston's recap of the story to be over (which I enjoyed), once the cartoon portion began, he was enthralled.  Good animation and a story well told.  Could have done without the hokey song about dreams, which was repeated throughout.",1229040000,3,292,4.938775510204081
1835827,5,B00008DDGG,Charlton Heston did a great job with the introduction of the movie!! The movie itself is touching and inspiring. This movies should be viewed by all ages. Families required!!!,1218326400,,175,5.068965517241379
1835828,5,B00008DDGG,"My wife and I got this one for our child, and it's loved my the family we watch it over and over. It is best to view all programs with young children, because no matter how innocent a DVD may seem children always have questions that are best answered by their parents. ""Faith without works is dead"" so do not leave the education of your child to the television, teach them the way God would.",1212278400,6,391,4.226666666666667
1835829,5,B00008DDGG,"This DVD production of the Joseph & The Coat of Many Colors story has accomplished exactly what I had hoped for my 3yr old son: an interest in learning about the Lord and His involvement in the lives of those who trust Him.  My son often recites (in surprising detail) various scenes from the tale.  One of my fellow brothers in Christ calls my son ""The Little Preacher"" because my son enjoys capturing the attention of those around him so he can retell the story of Joseph & The Coat of Many Colors.  I understand some reviewing this telling of the story may prefer stricter adherence to various nuances and literary exactness from Scripture - I can appreciate that as I am a literal believer of Scripture.  There is never a perfect retelling of any Biblical story that will appeal to everyone's preference.  As already mentioned, this achieved what I had hoped for my son: help him develop an interest in learning about the Lord, building a faith in the Lord, and forgiving those who wrong him.",1191542400,6,996,4.604519774011299
1835830,5,B00008DDGG,"This is my favorite story in Genesis.  This cartoon version is just perfect for kids or adults.  The story is first introduced by Charlton Heston.  If the kids start looking around for other things to do, don't worry. The introduction is brief, but it's a good one followed by the cute animated story of Joseph and his coat of many colours which everyone will love.  My friend's son was only 2 when he watched part of this and he was glued to it!  The characters are cute and all of the Heroes and Legends videos are told in a way that it easy for a child to understand.",1130544000,16,570,4.2407407407407405

1835897,4,B00008DDGG,Purchased for Sunday School summer program.. Ages K-5.  Story pretty much sticks to Bible story.,1404691200,2,96,5.4
1835898,5,B00008DDGG,great way to tell the bible stories for the younger kids. My grandchildren loved watching the movie. Going to buy more of the dvds. Charles Heston did a great job telling these stories.,1390780800,,185,4.636363636363637
1835939,2,B00008DDGG,"I was excited to receive the collection of 12 such stories from a local store for only $5 for Christmas.  The kids love watching these, but unfortunately, I'm not loving them.  I like that someone has invested the time and money to put Bible stories at a child's level, but sadly, they take rather questionable ""liberties"", my guess is so they can fill in some ""blanks"" to round out a story put to film.  You can't say what Scripture doesn't say, though, so I cringe and try to make sure to let the kids know that ""we don't know that it really happened that way"", or ""I don't think they were angry like that"", because yes, the characters in these stories often appear/sound mean/angry.  I heard another family member preview them on-line and she already had made the same ""angry"" observation about the characters.

There are also story introductions with Mr. Heston, which tend to be too long for many kids to sit through.  They again, seem to ""interpret"" and don't always seem like good theology...sighs.  2 stars for providing Bible stories for kiddos, but outside of that, I'm pretty disappointed and I don't like to be negative :(.",1390176000,,1135,4.673366834170854

I just recently was at a bible study and was able to put an image, albeit animated, to the story we were discussing!
How cool is that!

1835946,5,B00008DDGG,"Using this video as a Christmas present for the kids. Although I haven't seen this video yet, I'm sure it will be a great addition to the other videos that we already own from this series.",1354233600,,188,4.25
1835947,5,B00008DDGG,"I ordered severeal of these to show to my kids.  As we read each story I wanted to show them the movie behind it.  The kids enjoyed these very much and at a inexpensive cost, it is definitely worth it.  It's very engaging and can allow for much interaction with the kids.",1278028800,2,271,4.173076923076923
1835948,3,B00008DDGG,"My children enjoyed this video. This is a fairly well done cartoon telling the story of Joseph.

My complaint is in changing the details, particularly of Joseph's second dream.  Genesis 37:9 in NIV translation says: Then he had another dream, and he told it to his brothers.  ""Listen,"" he said, ""I had another dream, and this time the sun and moon and eleven stars were bowing down to me.

In this video, Joseph tells his father that the dream showed stars bowing down to the sun.  There are other changes which seem to have been made to make the story flow more easily, but I cannot figure out why they felt the need to change this detail.  In the Bible, Jacob says, ""Will your mother and I and your brothers actually come and bow down to the ground before you?""  This is consistent with the dream of the sun and the moon and 11 stars bowing down to Joseph.

Video is still entertaining, but I would recommend reviewing the bible story first and discussing the differences with your children, if you want them to have an accurate knowledge of this biblical story.",1264982400,24,1064,4.505208333333333

7981757,2,B00008DDGG,"The interpretation of the exchange between Joseph and Potiphar's wife felt so wrong. Rather than Joseph fleeing from temptation, he lingered and was so close to giving in.  It not only felt wrong, but it sends a message to kids that one should stick around for a while when temptation comes, including adultery.",1442188800,,311,4.867924528301887
