8537528,5,B0097VV1JM,"By 1980 J.R. Ewing was the most hated man on television so it was only natural for daytime soap operas to bank on that kind of character to boost ratings. This was no more evident than on ""As the World Turns"" which debut the new character James Stenbeck at the beginning of the decade played wonderfully by the talented Anthony Herrera. James was at times devious, sneaky and full of himself, but at the same time he was handsome, wealthy and debonair in the vein of James Bond. Women loved him and men wanted to be him.

 Soap Classics has introduced another wonderful box set of classic daytime drama in ""The James Stenbeck Story"", a collection of ten uncut episodes from the 1980's (1980-1989). Many have referred to this decade as being the best of ""As the World Turns"" as it kept up with the more youth-oriented serials like ""All My Children"" and ""General Hospital"". What viewers wanted during the greedy eighties was action, action and more action and ""World Turns"" fed them mouthfuls all with James Stenbeck at the center of the story!",1350864000,3,1042,4.657608695652174
