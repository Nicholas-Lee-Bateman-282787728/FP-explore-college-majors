3715754,4,B001NFNFIU,"I paid about $12 for this....so that is about the price of a movie ticket these days. Most movies I  spend  that on stink...so before throwing this in the trash as another reviewer suggested..lets keep the price in mind. I enjoyed myself a great deal during his standup. I don't put him up  with current greats like Brian Reagan, Robert Schimmel or even Christopher Titus and certainly not comedy gods like Carlin..but Ferguson is charming and funny and I will watch this from time to time.  The bonus interview is very enlightening  and the extra speech fun. This is a very good value for money folks. If you like standup...want a different perspective and certainly if you are a fan of  Mr Ferguson...lighten up and  enjoy!",1238457600,26,725,4.7063492063492065
3715755,4,B001NFNFIU,"I went to this comedy show live back in October and it was everything I remembered it to be.  Craig is hilarious, and it is the full show with all the parts they cut out for the Comedy Central special.  The only disappointment is they made me believe that the warm-up comedian that was at the original taping was also going to be on the DVD, but he wasn't.  Definitely recommend for anyone looking for a good laugh.",1237852800,25,415,4.294871794871795

3715766,5,B001NFNFIU,Craig's one of my favorite people.  I'm sure he's bummed on the Scottish independence vote outcome. I expect he or someone like him with a strong belief in Scotland's freedom will write a book on that.  But for this one.  As expected from Craig - very much worth it.,1411084800,,266,4.387755102040816

3715792,5,B001NFNFIU,"I love Craig Ferguson although he uses curse words often heard growing up in a blue collar city in Scotland with working middle class parents I read about in his autobiography American on Purpose and I ADMIRE his complete honesty of where he came from what he went through (Alcoholic-been sober about 20 yrs!) been to those meeting in basements of churches he says you can find by looking at VERY first pages in PHONE book! HA! His recovery in a long tern 6 month rehab in Scotland not one 30 days for celebs, funny and very sad stories alcoholics all learn to laugh and cry at that find recovery I can relate to myself,and his intense determination to come to America and BE a citizen after visiting an Uncle here who was a gardener one summer when he was 12? and he returned home more determined than ever to come back. He took the LONG way to get here as told in his Biography American on Purpose-This book lets Craig be Craig with no bleeps, etc. just gut level honest comedy never scripted- he does that few can like Don Rickles, Jonathon Winters, Robin Williams, best kind I like knowing it all just COMES into their heads! And he realizes how blessed he has been and is still humble and not in the social circle of Hollywood. So this book let me read more funny stories, many or most real of his never turned off mind that thankfully he still has! A must read for anyone liking gut level comedy not offended at some swearing that you can tell is ingrained from his life in Scotland and you have to take it with the laughs!",1362096000,,1529,4.34965034965035

3715836,4,B001NFNFIU,"The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson is our fave TV show. Craig is hilariously irreverent and the funniest guy on late night by far.  Just listen to the audience; Craig gets actual LAUGHS while the other guys predominantly get applause; like a pat on the head for being clever. Having said that, this DVD was nowhere near as funny as Craig's late night show. He needs Geoff; they complement each other like the new Laurel & Hardy, but funnier and contemporary and irreverent. This DVD was surprisingly lacking teeth. It's almost as if Craig needs a censor so he knows exactly how hard to ride the line. Still a fan, but his TV show is just better.",1356048000,,649,4.5
3715837,5,B001NFNFIU,"Just like most DVDs that have Craig Ferguson as the main subject matter... Craig is absolutely fantastic! Hilarious and witty and a bit dirty but gosh you gotta love him. But the DVD features are, as usual, lacking. This has a couple nice extras on it including one of my favorite speeches Craig did in Boston. But really, when you're looking to get this it isn't for DVD features. It's for Craig. If you're a fan you should already have this, simple as that. If you're not a fan you should get it and become a fan!",1353974400,,515,4.319587628865979

3715839,4,B001NFNFIU,"So Craig Ferguson is a US citizen now. He became one on 7/4/08, in Boston. And here he is back in Boston at the Wilbur Theatre for something over an hour of stand-up comedy. He tells a good bit of his own story, especially what made him come to the US, and how he feels living in Los Angeles, and why everyone seems to love Sean Connery, even though he's so old. He has laughs about Tom Cruise and Oprah Winfrey, and just about everyone else you might expect, except he never said a single word about Barack Obama.

He's funny. He does accents other than Scots, he does great things with facial expressions and body language, and you can't help imagining him in a kilt.

One of my favorites is his description of his wedding to a Jewish princess from New York. They had a combination Scots and Jewish wedding, with all the men in kilts and yarmulkes. His Scots relatives criticized him for breaking a ""perfectly good"" glass, and the relatives fought over who would pay for the wedding. But they had to dispense with the Jewish tradition of carrying the bride and groom around on their shoulders on chairs, which was in conflict with the Scots tradition of not wearing underwear under a kilt.

He's a very smart, very funny guy, and the US should be delighted to call him one of us.",1336867200,,1281,4.419491525423729
3715840,5,B001NFNFIU,"This is the best Craig Ferguson show on DVD!  He really shines in these shows .  In his own late night network show he is not able to really cut loose so these DVD's of his live shows really are fantastic.  This is even better I feel than ""Does this really need to be said"", although I ordered that one too and it was great.  Craig Ferguson has a great time creating a new revolution on stage.

3715842,2,B001NFNFIU,I bought this DVD for my husband (who watches Ferguson on TV nightly) and we watched it together but neither of us found him to be very funny in this format. Alot of the jokes we've heard before. Now that we own it I dought we'll ever watch it again.  I would recommend renting it but not for purchase.,1300665600,2,302,4.11864406779661

3715844,5,B001NFNFIU,"Craig Ferguson may be American now, but his perspective on this country is still fresh and funny.  His comedy special is a treasure.  The best part of his show is his honesty about his own humanity.  He may have sharp things to say about others but always keeps himself in check with humbling rants about his own life.

3715877,4,B001NFNFIU,"The stand up itself: Excellent. I laughed the whole way through. The man is funny, what can i say... But the dvd was, how shall i put this?, low on features. You get Craig's speech a Fanuel Hall, which is nice and also a brief interview of him; but that's really it. I mean I know its only a stand up special, but I expected ""A Wee Bit o' Revolution"" to have ""A Wee Bit"" more... All in all, good dvd; worth the money if you like Craig Ferguson (i know i do) and his humor.",1282608000,2,472,3.9270833333333335

3715879,5,B001NFNFIU,"The 1st time I remember seeing Craig Ferguson was on the Late, Late Show. I decided to get his book & discovered this DVD while looking on Amazon. I am very happy with this DVD! My wife & I watched it in her hospital room and the one drawback was, it hurt her stomach when she laughed (which was often), due to a procedure she had done. We will have to watch it again when she is feeling better. Craig is very entertaining and it is refreshing to have someone in the entertainment industry that actually loves America! If you like his TV show, you'll like this DVD. Unlike the TV, the DVD is not censored, so if you have a delicate ear, be forwarned. Neither my wife nor I found it offensive, though.",1262995200,2,700,4.231343283582089

3715882,5,B001NFNFIU,I had seen the hour long version of the concert on TV and liked it so much I ordered the DVD and was so happy I did so! The DVD shows the entire session with some really hilarious bits that were not shown on TV. Craig is wonderful and the interview that is included on the DVD is worth the price by itself. I highly recommend this!,1251590400,,331,3.955223880597015

3715885,5,B001NFNFIU,"I have watched this DVD--Craig Ferguson's standup routine--several times and I laugh out loud each and every time.  He tells stories about what he's been through but it's woven throughout his comedy routine so it never seems like he's just telling a story.  He is just self-deprecating enough and is able to poke fun at himself so that he comes across as human as the next guy.  If you like him even a little, I recommend this DVD and you will become as big a fan as I am now.",1245974400,8,476,4.266666666666667
3715916,4,B001NFNFIU,"If you never have seen Craig live, that is your misfortune!  He is hilarious.  He says all the things that they won't allow on his show.

3715918,5,B001NFNFIU,"One's enjoyment of this DVD is a function of one's liking for Craig Ferguson. I'm a huge fan, so I thought it was terrific. It is a convenient and inexpensive way to view his act as performed in personal appearances. We had seen Craig about six months ago in Las Vegas, and the DVD is that performance revisited. I would caution for those who might be concerned, that at the least it is PG-13, and more likely R rated, based on the narrative.
Craig is a funny guy, and I'm happy to have this DVD.",1241308800,10,496,4.231578947368421
3715919,5,B001NFNFIU,"I went to see one of Craig's live shows and laughed so hard my stomach hurt.  Nothing is as good as seeing the show live, but the DVD is pretty close.  He has tremendous energy and enthusisam and really connects with the audience.

The interview that was included on the DVD was great too.  The main thing you can say about Craig is that he's genuine.  I think that's why so many people feel such a connection with him.",1241136000,46,419,4.253164556962025

3715921,4,B001NFNFIU,"""Craig Ferguson: A Wee Bit O'Revolution""  is a standup performance filmed live at the Wilbur Theatre in Boston.  Ferguson, host of CBS's ""Late, Late Show,"" was recently granted American citizenship.  His performance covers a number of topics as the comedian shares his insights on rehab and  why junkies are fun to be around.  He also criticizes the latest big-screen James Bond for not being hairy enough.  If you're offended by off-color language, be warned.  Ferguson uses plenty of it on the DVD, and provides an overlong dissertaion on [...] size.  Comedy-wise, however, the DVD is a winner with the comedian in top form.  Though this concert premiered on Comedy Central on March 22, 2009, the DVD includes features not seen on television:  an interview with Ferguson and a speech he gave at Boston's Fanneuil Hall.",1240617600,8,820,5.007407407407407
3715922,3,B001NFNFIU,There was hardly any political jokes or political satire in it at all. I don't even think Craig poked fun at any of the politicians from the UK. You would think with the cover photo being Craig sitting on an old-fashioned throne there would be a Prince Charles impression thrown in or something. Also I have to admit that when he's not dressed in a suit somehow his gay jokes lose quite a bit of their zing. This stand-up show ended up being a drawn-out crazed ramblings about abusing substances and semi-amusing impressions. I would rather stick to his Late Late Show offerings that seem to be a more well-endowed robust comedy routine. Probably due to the padded support of the mighty CBS corporation.,1240444800,4,703,4.67741935483871
3715923,4,B001NFNFIU,"Its really funny, I laughed out loud, just like I usually do when I watch his show at 12:37pm on CBS. He was VERY CHEEKY in this one, using a bit of language and some interesting topic, but besides that, I really liked it. Craig is the funniest and most intelligent man on TV.",1240358400,2,276,4.12962962962963
3715924,5,B001NFNFIU,"I have to preface this review by saying that I am a fan of Craig's and his Late Night show.  I have also seen his stand up show.  This video is copy of that stand up show.  I saw his show in Atlantic City and enjoyed it but thought he toned down the video a bit from the show I saw.  On the road, Craig does not hold his tongue and often uses some choice words, but I think he held back a bit in this video. In his stand up he is known to adlib some parts of the gig and I think he chose not to do so much of that on this video. The video still represents the same show that I saw in AC.  I enjoyed the video and also liked the fact that he added the speech he gave in Boston, last July 4, 2008 as well as an unscripted interview with him and a unknown interviewer.  If you are a fan you will enjoy the video.  If you like comedy you will enjoy the video.  If you are not a fan yet, watch his show a few times first.  He has great timing and is truely one of comedy's best.  Then get the video.  The TV persona - cleaner.  Stand up persona - dirtier.  Craig - truely funny!",1239926400,9,1073,3.736607142857143
3715925,5,B001NFNFIU,"First of all a little credit to Mr. Ferguson: this is his first stand-up special (as Comedy Central has announced more times than I care to remember and Craig himself states in the act).  That being said, he does an excellent job of easing you into the heavier, funnier bits.  His act may not seem as polished as other established comedians, but we all know what happened when funnyman Greg Giraldo of Comedy Central acclaim had his own T.V. show...it tanked! I don't think Craig Ferguson should stick to either gig--he shows definite promise with his stand-up ability!

The DVD is a bargain at $12 with more content than some full-length Hollywood movies out on the market right now.  You get a honest, in-depth (though light-hearted which is refreshing he doesn't take himself too seriously like a lot of celebrities do when sharing their opinions) interview with Ferguson and a speech he made at a college in Boston on the Fourth of July no less.

For the parents: there is a bit of cussing and naughty humor, but it's in good taste (believe it or not) and comes off endearing when played by such a likable comedian.  Buy this comedy special so we can encourage him to do another one!",1238716800,12,1187,4.628571428571429

When I first saw him doing stand up I thought that I wasn't going to like it that much but let me tell you, I started laughing within 2 minutes of his routine and never stopped laughing until about an hour after it was over. He is so stinking funny I was actually gasping for air several times and making that crazy coughing sound when you laugh too hard thing. If you have not seen Craig Ferguson, you have got to watch any one of his stand up DVD's. You will not be disappointed unless you are one of those super serious people who does not find anything in this world funny, then you might be offended. His Scottish accent is so awesome.

I have been a big fan of him ever since he was Mr. Wick on Drew Carey's sitcom before hosting The Late Late Show and his new game show, Celebrity Name Game. Unlike all the other late night hosts, he doesn't make jokes about celebrities about their drug addictions or alcohol problems since he has had similar experiences himself. What I really liked about him was that he chose to cut out the Batman jokes due to the shooting in my old hometown of Aurora and despite the fact that he swears way more than any other late night host, he is also a classy man. Trust me since I met the Scotsman in person and he's the nicest man you could ever meet in person. Trust me, his stand up specials are definitely worth it.",1429747200,2,769,4.238095238095238
