8274136,4,B0019J2U68,"Very entertaining, if slightly amateurish and thin documentary about Alan Abel, a
sort of Sasha Baron Cohen of the 60s and 70s, who played politically inspired hoaxes
on the press. While the film itself isn't amazing on a technique level, Abel as
a character, and his bits are so funny that it makes it worthwhile. And there's
something innately touching about a daughter making a film as a tribute to her
wonderful, eccentric, father.

Sadly DVD extras - with lots of footage of Abel doing his thing - are even more fun than
the film, but those don't seem to be included on the download.",1343174400,,588,4.6
8274137,3,B0019J2U68,"Alan Abel has made a life out of pulling outrageous pranks that play on the gullibility of both the American media and public. The documentary Abel Raises Cain focuses on his strange ""career."" Abel's stunts are hilarious and have included:
- having a group of pranksters fake fainting spells during a live taping of Phil Donahue's TV program,
- starting a group that purportedly wanted to force all animals to wear clothes. (Its slogan was ""A Nude Horse is a Rude Horse""),
- starting another group that purportedly wanted to ban the breastfeeding of infants, due to the alleged thrill that it gave nursing mothers.

It probably goes without saying, that Abel is quite a character. The film shows Abel living in a ramshackle Connecticut house and struggling to makes ends meet; whatever else one may say about Abel, he has not gotten rich off of his stunts.

Abel Raises Cain rates only three stars because it fails to explain Abel on a deeper level. Abel wants the viewer to believe that he has performed a valuable service by exposing the public's gullibility, but the assertion is questionable. The film reminds the viewer of the movie Borat - Abel's stunts encourage people to laugh at others in a mean-spirited way without regard for the consequences to his unwitting victims. More insight into Abel - and the effects of his pranks - would have made this documentary more satisfying.

In short, Abel Raises Cain is funny, but it could have been so much better if the filmmakers had delved a bit deeper and asked Abel some tougher questions.",1306972800,,1544,4.775280898876405

8274139,5,B0019J2U68,"This is a brilliant and entertaining documentary about Alan Abel, the legendary hoaxer whose pranks rise to the level of great art. Among other triumphs, he was the first (and only?) person to trick the New York Times into publishing an obituary for someone who was still breathing (himself). The film, by Jenny Abel and Jeff Hockett, provides a fascinating insight into Mr. Abel's motivations while also providing a deliriously funny retrospective of his greatest pranks. This movie is a must see for anyone who delights in the gullibility of the media and enjoys being in on a good joke!",1239235200,2,589,4.9
