5772649,5,B00D3PYS6Q,Love the series....well made and love Maggie Smith.  The British class (caste) system at its finest.... As does its humor or should I say humour;-),1382745600,3,147,4.88
5772650,5,B00D3PYS6Q,My daughter is an avid Downton Abbey fan so these will be a Christmas gift for her.  She will be thrilled to own the set!  Can't seem to get enough of the series so these will be perfect for her.,1382140800,,195,3.85
5772651,4,B00D3PYS6Q,"4 stars is for the show itself, lets face it...its ""Dallas"" all over again with different 'UK/English' accents instead of 'Southern/Texan' accents, and with historical elements in the mix as interesting backdrops. A good ol' Soap Opera with excellent acting...nothing too much wrong with that i say! (at least for seasons 1-2, we haven't seen season 3 yet, and don't have this boxed set yet :)... BUT will come back and update rating based on the specifics of the set once it's released....questions i DO have about the set are....

Does anyone know whether or not this will contain the UN-cut longer UK versions of the show, or will it contain the cut/shorter versions that appeared on US broadcasts? the answer to the above will determine whether or not i purchase this set. My fingers crossed that it contains the genuine longer unedited versions that aired in UK?...if amazon can confirm that, then i'll be SOLD on this set right away as a gift for the mrs.

so,...does anyone know?",1378684800,10,986,4.794117647058823
5772652,5,B00D3PYS6Q,"There is something special about ""Downton Abbey"".  It has all the trappings of a typical British costume drama, but it's got an extra spark that's allowed it to travel overseas and find great success here in the United States.  I am a male in his 20s who enjoys dark TV shows like ""Dexter"" and ""Breaking Bad"" - on the surface, I'm not exactly in the demographic you'd think would be interested in ""Downton Abbey"".  But I gave the show a chance, and I really enjoy it.  So I'd encourage you to give it a chance too.  Between ""Downton Abbey"" and the BBC's ""Sherlock"", I think Britain has two of the best shows of recent years.

As with any great TV show, ""Downton Abbey"" has a strong narrative and well-written characters.  One thing that sounded a bit off-putting about the show was the idea of rich folks living in their castle with a bunch of servants.  But as you watch, its obvious that the Crawleys (who own the estate) care very much for their staff.  And when financial troubles hit the family, they do their very best to keep all their staff on payroll.  They consider it their duty, and even their honor, to employ as many people as possible and treat them well (this is something that large companies today could learn from).

One of the most fun aspects is that this world is unfamiliar to most of us.  The show's timeline so far spans from 1912 to the early 1920s.  People spoke, dressed, and acted differently than they do now.  Various world events from the time period are referenced in the show - the sinking of the Titanic and the British campaigns of World War I are two in particular that greatly affect the series and its characters.

This show feels very cinematic - the locations, the costumes, the sound design and the music are all fantastic.  Despite TV programs having limited resources, this show is an example of what talented directors can achieve on a modest budget - the show feels every bit as grand in scope as a Hollywood feature film.

* This Amazon exclusive box set contains the first three seasons of the show (plus a bonus disc with special features).  It's the perfect way to catch up on the entire series; it would also make a nice gift for a fan of the show.
** If you're a Prime member, you can stream all three seasons for free right now on Amazon Instant Video.",1378080000,157,2305,4.4606205250596656

5772670,2,B00D3PYS6Q,Got this item in July when it was a daily deal & a great deal at that. I was going to give it as a birthday present but decided to save it for Christmas. The person was so excited & rushed through the first season in a day but when she put in the 1st disc of the 2nd season it was defective with an indentation that does not allow it to play that disc. Very disappointing and of course now past the return date.,1451174400,,411,3.847058823529412

We have looked at every disc and the other 4 seasons each have their first & second episodes but the first disc of the first season starts with episode #3.  I am gave this to my 93 year old mother for an early Christmas gift because she had missed the first 3 1/2 seasons.  We are very disappointed episodes 1 & 2 of the series are missing.  I am waiting to hear back from the seller.",1449360000,,567,4.231481481481482
5772673,5,B00D3PYS6Q,"How I love Downtown Abbey! I got started late in the game, so I ordered this and got all caught up. Even got my husband interested in watching them. The quality of the show is outstanding, but through Blu Ray - can't get much better. You can pause, reverse if you can't quite make out that English accent and there is the additional footage. I will probably have to order the other seasons later to add to my collection. I have been frustrated in the past watching this on TV because cable (and satellite) isn't always reliable.

5772695,5,B00D3PYS6Q,"We found this show quite by accident while perusing channels to find something to watch one night. We caught the end of the show that night and watched the last 20 minutes or so. We liked it instantly and began watching it because it was just so well done. This program, down to the smallest detail is spot on for the time period it is set in which makes it so appealing. The show is written very well and makes you care about the characters and because of that, you have to watch it. The Brits seem to know how to do these time piece shows very well and it is probably why it has caught on here in the states. There are some things about the show that turned me off, especially how the Irish were cast in the show. Episodes involving that were very one sided. Being of Irish descent and still having family there, I have heard the other side. However, it is a British television program and they do as they please.

All that being said, it is an excellent, well done program and very entertaining.",1437436800,,998,4.252631578947368

As the series progresses, new inventions and events follow a real-time line.

The cast includes an always sultry Michelle Dockery.

Skillfully written, directed, cast and acted with a terrific screen presentation.  A wonderful range of emotions drawn in a changing era.  Although if locks had been put on the Abbey's interior room's doors or the masters or servants had been minimally aware of the chance of being overheard, the plot substance would have dwindled to nothing.  But regardless of social status, the range of humanity so artfully drawn is marvelous; these are characters that the viewer can't help themselves but to care about and become involved in their lives.

5772743,1,B00D3PYS6Q,"Just to clarify, I am not rating the story or characters of Downton Abbey, I am rating the specific product and purchase experience.
I am now having to return this Amazon Exclusive Blu-ray set for a third time. When I purchased the first set for my wife's birthday, we found that disc #3 would not load and gave an ""invalid disc"" error on each Blu-ray player that we have. This is a 9 disc set (some of the descriptions state that this contains 7 discs). Each of the seasons contain two discs of the show and a third disc with bonus content (discs 3, 6 and 9 are bonus materials) Bonus discs 6 and 9 both play without issue.
When I contacted Amazon, I spoke with ""Alvaro"" who was friendly and very apologetic and provided me with a UPS return label and in addition to sending me a replacement, he also issued a $5 credit to my Amazon account for the inconvenience. I sent back that first set and received a replacement within a few days. Unfortunately, the second set also contained the same ""invalid disc"" error on disc #3. I notified Amazon and this time I spoke with ""Melanie"" who told me that they would temporarily remove this item from Amazon and research the error. She said that they would be reviewing their inventory because it seemed like there was a potential copying issue with that disc and she would call me back in 3-5 days with an update.
A week and a half later (after no contact from ""Melanie"" or anyone else from Amazon) I spoke with ""Yen"".  Yen issued the second UPS return label and said they were sending me a third set of Blu-ray discs. There was much confusion as to my dilemma when I tried to explain that I'd had the same problem twice before.
When I mentioned that ""Melanie"" indicated that Amazon was going to verify if the disc #3 was working properly BEFORE they sent me a third set, Yen replied, ""yes, when we receive the defective/damaged item, we check to see what's wrong"".  I spent a great deal of time trying to explain that I was told that someone was going to check that particular disc BEFORE sending it on to me, since I wasn't allowed to return a single disc, rather than the full set. Then suddenly Yen tells me, ""I just did some checking and see that we have reviewed this disc for replacement..."" I replied, ""so you're saying that someone from Amazon HAS verified that Disc #3 is reading correctly?"" Yen replied, ""yes sir, let me go ahead and place the order.""
I've now received a third set - shrink-wrapped and unchecked. Disc# 3 does not read, although Yen had indicated it would have been verified.  At least I had received that initial $5 credit for all the hassle. At this point, it looks like a refund is in order so that I can just purchase the individual seasons.",1401148800,20,2715,4.426
5772744,5,B00D3PYS6Q,If you are into English theater this is an excellent turn of the century novel. I was hooked on the series since the 2nd episode.

5772747,5,B00D3PYS6Q,"This turned out to be a ""sleeper"" Christmas gift. My wife had no idea that this series even existed. But I overheard two women raving about the series at a restaurant. At the same time Amazon offered the package as a special. The price was certainly reasonable. My wife's reaction when she opened the gift seemed to be ""ho-hum - why are you giving me this?"" But within a few minutes of the first episode, she was ""hooked."" It did not take much longer to reel me in. Watching episode on top of episode, instead of waiting for a week, is a great way to get the feel of the characters and plot. It all goes so quickly. With the first three seasons digested, though, we were able to patiently watch season four on a weekly basis this year over PBS.",1399939200,2,744,4.283687943262412

Have never and probably will never listen to the series.
Both when aired and now with the Blu-rays, just look at the really beautiful scenery, costumes, rooms and genteel mannerisms of a long gone glimpse of how things ""used to be.""
While this is happening, there is some awesome music being played, with the best equipment affordable, and what a beautiful way of removing yourself from the twenty-first century!

I had had some problems with some of the dialogue and didn't catch some phrases or even short scenes.  Hearing them for the second time I understood more.  More than half way through the three seasons I decided to try the English subtitles; my only regret is that I hadn't done that earlier.  The subtitles help a lot and they are not at all distracting; they are placed in discrete places on the screen so that they don't cover anything and they can be read very readily and quickly.",1389225600,4,726,4.134751773049645

the set has NO episode/disk guide, so there is no way of finding any particular episode without resorting to trial and error, which is a massive oversite that could have been prevented with the insertion of a single peice of paper.

The set itself is fairly empty, don't expect anything but disks.  no inserts, no extra / fun packaging.. very standard..  nothing that screams ""Deluxe""",1386979200,36,467,4.8
