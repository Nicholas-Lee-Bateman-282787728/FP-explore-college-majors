72266,5,0784013470,"This had to be one of the most disappointing film-going experiences that I've ever had. When I left the movie theater I realized that I'd just seen a powerful, disturbing and very scary film that no one will see because of  the still playing 'The Sixth Sense'. I like 'Sixth Sense', but I still  can't see any reason for it's phenomenal success. Yes, I was surprised by  the ending, but the overall story and character development was rather limp  and (while I liked the kid) Bruce Willis's performance was at times  downright laughable. How many of his scenes didn't actually have him in  tears?  'Stir of Echoes' in my opinion is a far better film. The main  reason is Kevin Bacon's knockout performance, which has to be seen to be  believed. His hilarious response to his wife - ""It's not over  there!"" had me in stitches. Lately he hasn't done any roles which  would give him something to work with and in this film he finally finds the  right material. He is simply sensational. You see the changes that his  character goes through and you believe them 100%. Not a false note in this  very difficult performance. The actress who played his wife is just as good  and so is their little kid.  Don't let this on slip away. It's a gripping  film.",949622400,3,1247,4.520179372197309
72267,4,0784013470,"A little slow at the beginning, but more than makes up for it in the long run.
The performance of the three main characters was excellent, and they really let you feel the emotions.
For those not into horror (like me),  this movie was gripping, without being over the edge.",949622400,2,273,4.46
72268,3,0784013470,"and so our protagonist Tom (Kevin Bacon) slips into a deep hypnotic state, and after he awakens, he starts to ""receive"" messages from the supernatural. This is the basis for a very scary story which takes place in  a close-knit, blue-collarish town where everyone knows their  neighbors...but not as well as they think! Bacon's acting is right on the  money. I especially liked the supposed blue-collar speak: Aye, how youse  doin'? He convincingly acts terrified, confused, & sad...a man on the  brink of going looney. Rounding out the cast is the always  quirky-yet-attractive Illeana Douglas, down-to-earth sexy Kathryn Erbe as  Tom's wife, and playing Tom's son, Jake,  Zachary David Cope does a fairly  good imitation of the kid from ""The Sixth Sense"". ( The kid here,  you see, has always ""received"" the same messages!) The director  & writer, David Koepp uses a great visual style to move things along,  as well as a few neat special FX shots as the supernatural forces come to  light. The scene where Tom first goes under hypnosis is very very  effective...I almost felt like I was being hypnotized as I wathced...you  will too. Thoroughly enjoyable. Great extras. Well worth the price of  ownership.",949622400,,1208,4.994974874371859
72269,4,0784013470,"""Stir of Echoes"" was a major surprise.  Big time.  I wanted to see it since I first saw the trailer in July but I never got around to it.  I waited for video (Which most of you have probably done also) and was  thoroughly impressed.  So impressed in fact, that I went out and bought it  the next night.  It's sort of a mish-mash of ""Poltergeist"",  ""The Shining"", ""Rosemary's Baby"", ""The Sixth  Sense"" and whatever else ghost movies are out there for that matter.  Kevin Bacon gives the performance of a lifetime and the movie has dazzling  surprises that truly surprise.  On the DVD, I LOVED that creepy cool menu  beginning.  All those flash cuts and stuff FREAKED ME OUT!  If you LOVE  good horror flicks, this one is for you!  It's pretty scary.",949536000,9,748,4.462686567164179

72271,5,0784013470,"Scariest movie I have ever seen.  No joke!  I didn't see the sixth sense, but I've heard this was much better.",949363200,2,110,4.190476190476191
72272,5,0784013470,"This movie was truly a surprise, and a victim of bad timing.  It was eerie, suspensful, funny, and somewhat similar to and released around the same time as the Sixth Sense.  The mammoth success of Sixth Sense truly  wounded this film's potential. Kevin Bacon does a great job as playing a  madman driving by those subliminal movie messages like ""Dig"".  He  opens up a pathway into the paranormal world after being placed into a  hypnotic spell by Ileana Douglas(Fox's Action).  From there he finds that  he not the only one in his family with the ""Shinning"", yes the  Shinning.  Do you want to get sued lad!  Sorry, Simpson's reference after  he sees his son talking to ""imaginary"" dead friends as we all  tended to do from time to time.  While the movie was overshadowed by Sixth  Sense it had more action, and moved at a faster pace. The only thing that  Sixth sense had over the films was it's incredible ending.  The movie would  have you jumping one minute and laughing the next, but not in the  predictable way most horror movies do.  It was truly well done, and had a  great sex scene where the wife wakes the husband(Bacon) for some loving.  It's true in movies dreams can come true.  Go see it or buy it either way  you shouldn''t be disappointed unless you one of the people that likes to  ruin a movie by saying that's a rip-off from Sixth Sense or that doesn't  happen in the Sixth Sense.  Also, look for the microwave burrito on the  nightstand.  I'm still not sure of the symbolism, but I'm sure it's  something genious.  Take care, go get it!",948412800,95,1557,4.489208633093525

But like other horror movies, people, especially the main characters, become dumber as the movie gets closer to the climax.
For instance, not calling the police out of ""kindness"" is really dumb.
Not running away from a bunch of unfriendly people, when you have the chance, is also dumb.
Still, considering all other horror movies, this one is above average.",1474156800,,376,5.080645161290323

72427,5,0784013470,"Do you like ghost stories?
Did you saw Sixth Sense and liked it?
This is your man.
This movie was released with Sixth Sense and was a poor man at that time. But it was a well made movie.
There is this simillar movie in Korea but it is ok watching this film since it is not all redundant.
It has scary moments and some but also great ending, peaceful one that make us also feel like oh, now I can go back to sleep kind of feeling.

The story is not that original but it is more of a Art work and Atmosphere that are great.
The house is a great charactor itself too.
Also Kevin Bacon and his wife charactor played by Kathryn Erbe were so great that I wanted to just watch this film again and again because of them
Also the kid was so adorable to just look at. He was not just a kid. He was a great actor himself.

The story is simple.
Before this family moved in, there is this incident happend in this house during repairation.
Two of the nabour boys happens to stop this girl who just got out of her house and rapes her and kills her, burries her inside the wall.
Now not knowing all that, Kevin's family moved in.
Kevin and his son see ghost from time to time. She wants something from them which is revenge and her proper burrier.

Now rest of the story is pretty predictable.
But you have no idea how it flow.
You will enjoy how it is for every penny of it.
Scary sad but not that gloomy, and joyous at the end when the girl is released in a happy face.
Great movie that shouldn't be burried.
Also the bluray transfer was so great comparing the fact that it was made in 1999.
It was picture sound perfect.",1469232000,3,1608,4.066246056782334

Kevin Bacon's character is a skeptic about hypnosis and psychic phenomena, until he asks his sister-in-law to hypnotize him, thus opening his mind to the spiritual world, which, he discovers, his five-year-old son knows a lot about. There are visual references to ""Psycho,"" ""Night of the Living Dead"" (which is also on TV at one point in the movie), a bit of Edgar Allan Poe, and even ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind,"" though this is not a sci-fi film.

72440,4,0784013470,"In recent years, supernatural horror has become about gore and jump scares, these movies aren't scary anymore! Paranormal Activity, The Grudge, The Ring, are you kidding me?! Those movies were terrible! They don't make movies like Stir of Echoes anymore, this is a supernatural thriller, that was truly unsettling and creepy, the kind of film that defines what supernatural horror should be. Tom & Maggie are celebrating moving into a new house, and as the party is winding down, Maggie's sister claims to know something about the supernatural. Tom (Kevin Bacon) is a complete skeptic, so she offers to hypnotize him and see what happens. Reluctantly Tom agrees and after seeing some strange flashes, Tom wakes up unsettled but still a non-believer. Over the next few weeks, Tom continues to see strange images of a girl asking for his help and believes his sister in-law messed with his mind somehow. Once convinced that she had nothing to do with it, Tom decides to investigate and try to find out, who this girl is and why she's asking for help. This movie is truly scary because depending on what you believe in, this could be 100% real. Kevin Bacon is one of those actors who when he is in the right role is better than anyone, and this role is perfect for him. Bacon had me on the edge of my seat and it seemed as thou this movie just flew by. I wanted to know who this girl was and what happened to her just as much as he did. As for the paranormal stuff, it wasn't bloody, gory, and out of nowhere but it was just as creepy. This is the kind of film that left you jittery and uneasy for hours afterwards, the definitive horror movie.

72447,5,0784013470,"This movie came out a month after The Sixth Sense, and was largely overshadowed by it. I adore this movie. Ive seen it a hundred times. I feel that the family is so likable, as a unit and individually. Im a big Kevin Bacon fan. Always have been. And I love Kathryn Erbe as Toms wife, Maggie. It would have been so easy for the creators of this movie to portray her as the denier and the naysayer, but instead shes supportive and sympathetic, and takes on the burden along with Tom and his son, an adorable little boy who is played by Zachary David Cope (one of two roles, one uncredited- what happened to this kid? He was great!).

The very practical and hard working Tom, who doesnt believe in any spiritual nonsense, challenges Maggies sister Lisa (Illeana Douglas) to hypnotize him at a party. He then realizes that a missing girl in the neighborhood is making contact with him and his son. I think Kevin Bacon does a great job playing this role. Tom is shocked, scared, and exhausted. Very burdened, both morally and spiritually, he begins to seek the truth of this unsolved disappearance of the young lady, much to the dismay of certain people in the neighborhood who are hiding a terrible secret.

I love this movie. I love the acting, the atmosphere of their unique and fun Chicago neighborhood, the scares, the secret unfolded, and the ultimate justice. I can find a way to justify every moment of this movie,",1461715200,,1417,4.552941176470588

72450,4,0784013470,"This movie is not scary, but it features two outstanding lead performances by Kathryn Erbe and Kevin Bacon. This performances are enabled by David Koepp's excellent dialogue. The first ten minutes of the movie focus on Bacon and Erbe sharing joy and concern over her unexpected pregnancy. Their comments and reactions seem very real, and they make very clear the stresses on working-class couples. You wouldn't expect this kind of writing in a horror picture. It's a welcome change.

The movie sags after its strong start and features a slew of horror movie clichs--sances, visions, and sudden loud noises. Critics say that similarities between The Sixth Sense and this movie are coincidental, but like me you'll probably wonder how much Koepp and Shamalyan might have stolen from each other. You will notice that Shamalayan had the stronger child actor, which may have resulted in The Sixth Sense's better box office success.

The movie picks up during its last half hour and features some very impressive plot twists that are completely unpredictable.

Expect a working-class drama that happens to have a ghost in it and you'll enjoy Stir of Echoes.",1459036800,,1151,5.079365079365079

72457,4,0784013470,"Stir of Echoes is a smart, well-made horror thriller with good acting and slick direction. After being hypnotized by his sister-in-law at a party, a family man begins seeing a ghost in his home. As he dedicates himself to understanding what it wants, he discovers his young son can communicate with the ghost and may even hold the key to unearthing a neighborhood secret. Despite being released the same summer as The Sixth Sense and having a similar theme, understand that this film is no copycat. Adapted from the book by Richard Matheson, Stir of Echoes is a solid supernatural picture that not only holds its own but actually continues to dazzle after several viewings, unlike its nemesis which loses much of its impact once you know its secret.

Perhaps most intriguing is that these characters are regular people with normal lives and realistic motives, a trifecta that's been all but discounted by a Hollywood elite that prefers to believe audiences can (or should) better relate to the beautiful, rich, and exceptional. Furthermore, Stir of Echoes showcases the talents of the gravely underrated Kevin Bacon. While most would agree that Depp and DiCaprio belong to a prestigious handful of actors capable of embodying any part, one need only see Bacon in one of his more obscure films - The Woodsman, for instance - to know he deserves the same accolades.

Stir of Echoes is not a perfect film, but it is a strong, well-constructed entry into the paranormal horror genre that packs enough chills, charm, and well-placed humor to win over the casual film-goer as well as the true film buff.",1450137600,,1597,4.88929889298893

72472,4,0784013470,"Kevin Bacon movies are either hit or miss, and this was a hit.  Unfortunately it did not have a great box office turn out, but it was rather insightful to the spirit world.  I mean that in that I believe there are people out there who are sensitive to what is going on in another world, who can hear and listen to the thoughts and feelings of others, much like the saints can hear voices and see things.  Why?  Because it's science.  Like those who have had near death experiences and have come back, their electrical systems have become fine tuned or are ""off"".  They asked the saints how and why it is that they can see and hear things when others can't, and they had no explanations.  All they said was ""I am a vessel, I'm just the messenger.""  Kevin Bacon, unknowingly, became just one of these things.

Kevin Bacon is a blue collar guy living in a Chicago suburb, happily going about his business with his wife and young son, when at a party one night, something changes.  His sister-in-law, who he never particularly liked, is telling others about reconnecting to the spirit world.  Never one to believe his kooky sister, he offers for her to put him under.  So she does with hypnosis, for the purpose of putting him under enough for her to stick a pin in his hand without his twitching.  Since then, he begins to not feel right, sensing things, hearing things.  And his young son is talking to his imaginary friends.  Thanks to his young son's recommendation to get a new babysitter (from his imaginary friend Samantha), when Kevin begins to sense that something is not right on the night he was going out to a football game, the paths line up the right way.  The babysitter is the sister of a girl who disappeared last year, and when she heard his son say the name of his imaginary friend Samantha, she demands to know how and why he knows the name of the sister who disappeared last year.  From there, Kevin Bacon goes down a path of not knowing exactly how and why things are happening the way they are, but he's sure that someone is trying to tell him something and he is trying in vain to find out what it is.  Things haunt him in dreams, he sees things before they happen, and his wife fears that he's going mad.  All the while, we wonder exactly what happened to Samantha and why others are appearing in their dreams like this.

This was a good movie with a few twists that I wasn't expecting here and there.  Over time, I saw how the stories of the other secondary characters did and didn't intersect when it was about to come to a head.  It's too bad that this did not take off like The Sixth Sense did, but I think that movie's hype came from the big twists at the end which you didn't expect.  Here you knew you were going to find something out, but it wasn't as shocking as the Sixth Sense's.  Because there is a world that some of us are part of, some us can see and hear, and some of us know that there is, a place somewhere between science and the part we cannot explain how and why.  We are there ... And yet we are not.",1443916800,2,3043,4.287215411558669

72496,4,0784013470,"This is an excellent film for fans of horror and suspense.  Kevin Bacon is terrific in his role as Tom Witzky, a regular joe who wants to be better than his normal ""boring life"" with his wife Maggie and his son Jake.  Well, he certainly gets a life-changing event when his sister-in-law Lisa hypnotizes him at a party, opening a door in Tom's mind he was unaware of which leads to a series of visions and strange happenings involving a young girl who went missing from their Chicago neighborhood a few months before.

The film is a mystery entangled with a horror story and provides plenty of suspense and creepiness along the way as Bacon, Kathryn Erbe and Zachary David Cope provide exquisite performances as a family in serious jeopardy of being torn apart in the face of evil.  The special features include a nice featurette where the actors, director and writer of the film-inspiring novel give their takes on this project which never fails to send shivers up the spine.",1431734400,,975,4.684210526315789

The writer and director created a superbly intelligent and engaging horror/mystery film.

Kevin Bacon is brilliant. His acting in this film is so natural and spontaneous.

The plot twist is deftly incorporated into the story that climaxes in a spine chilling ending.

72536,5,0784013470,"This is not your typical horror film, no girls screaming even though they are supposed to be hiding. I know that the sequel had a little more P.R. but I assure you this is not like the sequel at all. This is actually based off a book there's no real surprise scares in it this movie, this movie is just generally creepy with the dimensional characters and a build up plot. It's not bogged down by a million dollars of special effects the acting is great and awesome. Not at all what I would call a ""b""horror movie. Kevin Bacons  character is skeptical of hypnotism yet becomes hypnotized by his wife's sister and becomes only slightly clarvoint. The characters in our are real and relatable to the general public as they are a family on the brink of poverty trying to make ends meet in the inner city. This movie belongs in the horror movie all star collection whether you like the movie or not. They just don't make horror movies like this often like Rose Red, or the others, sleepy hallow, and what lies beneath.

72539,4,0784013470,"Tom Witzky (Kevin Bacon) is an ordinary guy whose life later becomes complicated. During a get together at a block party, he talks his sister-in-law Lisa (Illeana Douglas) into hypnotizing him. She pulls it off and places a post hypnotic suggestion in Tom to make him more open-minded. She doesn't realize this leads to opening a mental door that allows him to somewhat communicate with the dead. Tom is soon hounded by a spirit that wants something really bad. -summary

When Stir of Echoes was released back in 1999, it was immediately considered a clone of The Sixth Sense which starred Bruce Willis. For reasons I can't remember because it has been so long since I saw the other film. I remember enjoying this one a lot more, perhaps it had something to do with its simplicity. Directed by David Koepp and based on the book A Stir of Echoes written by Richard Matheson, Stir of Echoes is a supernatural horror thriller that delivers on suspense and creepiness.

The plot begins when Tom begins to hallucinate, then later learns that he possesses a precognitive sense which leads to some weird and very disturbing visions. There is some type of connection and the viewer will easily begin to guess what it is, but things are kept vague enough to keep you wanting more. Tom's 5 year old son Jake (Zachary David Cope) plays a role in this as well, since he can actually speak to the spirit as well as see it. This sets in motion a chain of events that results in a gripping, very well paced viewing experience.

I thought Koepp did a splendid job in blurring reality and dreams, along with taking the simplest of set pieces and getting the most out of them to produce chills. I haven't seen the movie in years, and the appearance of the spirit in combination with Tom's reality shifts still made my skin crawl.

The characters are well developed and they stood out to me mainly because of how ordinary they are. They feel like everyday normal people, who just got hit with something complicated out of nowhere, and they act the part very well. The performances by Illeana Douglas and Kathryn Erbe whom played Tom's wife Maggie were just as good as everyone else, but I enjoyed Douglas the most though.

Towards the end of the film, I kind of thought that the spirit was a little over-exposed, and I didn't really like the ending all that much. I would have preferred less of a thriller type ending, and I'll just leave it at that.

Overall, Stir of Echoes is a very solid horror thriller that I do recommend. It's still very good over ten years later and felt pretty damn refreshing to watch. There are a couple of squeamish scenes, and one little sex scene, but nothing I can consider damaging to the viewing experience. The movie has a 99 minute run time.

Pros: Delivers on atmosphere and chills

Cons: Ending could have been better",1412640000,,2836,4.590909090909091

I am NOT a film reviewer, so this 'review' may not help, but this is a very good film with excellent acting, atmosphere and story.

72563,4,0784013470,"Stir of Echoes is a really impressive horror flick.  It's about Kevin Bacon's character who plays the role of a father/husband to a younger son and after some light-hearted encouragement to get hypnotized one night at a party, soon after he begins to see premonitions of future (or past) events around the neighborhood.  This is when the horror kicks in.

He and his wife have a younger son and initially it's believed he's talking to imaginary friends, but soon they realize the names he's blurting out while playing with his toys are that of real people that have died.  The parents don't take this seriously or think it's cause for concern until an almost kidnapping incident involving the boy and the babysitter later on (the boy blurts out the name ""Samantha"" the name of the babysitters missing sister, so she panics, grabs the boy and tries to take him to her mother before getting caught).  Then Kevin Bacon and his wife put the pieces together and realize that something isn't quite right here!  Trying to find out what happened to the missing girl is the ultimate message here.

Kevin Bacon does a great job playing the confused husband/father never quite sure how to interpret the visions that he sees, and his wife and son are both terrific actors in their respective roles as well.  In fact the little boy is quite sharp as far as his acting skills are concerned.  Basically the movie is about Kevin Bacon trying to figure out what's going inside his brain and why he's seeing events before they happen, and in the second half -without spoiling anything- the little boys images are also revealed and shown in remarkably spooky fashion.  Keeping the events around the neighborhood and especially in the house was the best way to tell this story for the full amount of scariness.

I highly recommend this movie.",1400803200,,1822,4.752380952380952

The casting is great and this movie really does raise the hairs on your neck without the over-the-top graphic depictions of blood and gore.

I loved it and so do my guy and my friends....so let's start from the top. I lit a candle and I need you to picture one of those great old movie theatre's; and its an empty theatre, the walls are black......the rest of the theatre is completely drenched in black...theirs  long black letters on the screen, they're blurry at 1st and as you get closer you start to notice a few things......The Theatre is no longer empty as you see a boy the age of 8 and an older girl sitting next to him wearing an old Orange jacket and thick glasses. It's strange but you know that the girls a ghost and the boy has the special ability to talk to ghost to help them...after that you have to know more.....Now I saw this movie after the 6th sense and at 1st I liked this one more cause of the story line....but later I linked the 6th sense and this one all up with The Shining.....(even with Simpson's version of The Shining....where Groundskeeper Willy says you've got the shinning......Bart says...Oh you mean Shining.....and he says......shhh! You wanna get sued, which is funny cause I've seen 50000 spoofs of this, my 2nd favorite being the South Park episode at the old Blockbuster Stan's dad bought. Which brings me to the cemetery scene in Stir of Echoes. The boy walks past a tall black man who says The Boys got the second sight.....x-Ray....the father 2. And I thought this was one of Kevin Bacon's best roles.....the other and this is gonna date me......was Tremors. The mom I thought was a tad annoying cause she took a long while 2 understand what was going on, and wasn't exactly being supportive....until a while in the movie. As for the little boy, as far as I'm concerned....I like him....Haley Joel Osment and Danny. I thought the clues were Really cool, my favorite was the movie theatre intro I did.....and how he kept  humming Paint It Black.....A song which the mom knew but wasn't sure why the kid was singing it...and in turn he wasn't sure either...I liked how the day the murder happened started coming to life in bits and pieces of clues that Kevin Bacon had to figure out, and I liked how when the girl got her retribution.....she was released and got to leave this plane  ( in fact that's the song I used for my Headline.)

It is a slightly disturbing and completely enthralling suspense mystery that keeps your attention.

I was actually watching it while doing something else and I had to keep rewinding it to understand something I had only been paying half attention to.
Yep, its one of those movies.

I recommend it even if you don't care for ghost stories because its a pretty good whodunit.
I recommend it even if you don't like mysteries because its a pretty good ghost story.

72588,3,0784013470,"Stir of Echoes is a well produced movie about the dead communicating with the living called receivers. The witzky family has two receivers under one roof, the dad Tom (Kevin Bacon) and his son Jake (Zachary David Cope) who is more receptive. The wife/mother Maggie (Kathryn Erbe) is unable to see or hear the ghosts and is a major cause of tension between the three. The story is not new to the genre, but it is farily well written and between the direction and acting it is an enjoyable movie to watch. I felt that the movies pacing was a little uneven and lags here and there and there was some missed opportunities that could have made this a great story. My case in point is the lack of follow through with Officer Neil ( Eddie Bo Smith Jr.) and his group of receivers that could have greatly expanded on and added some much need depth and dimention to the story and the supporting cast. Tom is driven to the breaking point after he dares Maggie's friend Lisa (Illeana Douglas) to hypnotize him at a neighbors party that opens a pathway for him to become a receiver. His problems revolve around a teenage girl that had dissappeared 6 moths ago and his visions begin to take control of his life with his sole purpose in life is to find the missing neighborhood girl Samantha (a young Jennifer Morrision) that as I mentioned earlier has caused a strain in his otherwise good marriage. The ending has a couple of twists that do little to change the ending from the old standard to something with a bite to it. All in all its an entertaining average movie with good production values. Was it worth the time? yes. Would I watch it again? I already have.

Rating from 0 to 5 Stars

Story = 3 A pretty standard story with some missed opportunities.
Direction = 4 Good direction that was able to bring out good performances from the cast.
Acting = 4 Very good job done by lead and supporting cast plus kudo's to Zachary David Cope as Jake.
Violence = 2 A few scenes of fighting, gun play, and of murder and attempted rape.
Scary/Chreepy Factor = 3 The effects are well done and add a creepyness to the story.
Sex/Nudity = Yes a scene of lovemaking with partial nudity and a bath scene with partial nudity. There is a scene that hints of a rape, but is interrupted by a ???
Foul Language = Yes and it includes the big ones, but it is sprinkled here and there and not in every scene.
Entertainment Value = 3+",1378080000,,2402,4.383408071748879

72597,5,0784013470,"Kevin Bacon leads a good cast in a working class neighborhood haunted house thriller. Not an eerie mansion or even a fancy NYC apartment building but ordinary folk who find  strange things happening to them. It all starts when the little boy starts talking to somebody who isn't there. Soon the father joins in seeing things that aren't there and falling apart as a consequence.
The script is a tight one, the neighborhood atmosphere well done, the surprises are surprises, with the result that the viewer is carried along into ever more perplexing situations until a denouement which may or may not be a surprise. Hopefully, the viewer will not know in advance what is coming up.
One of the not so secret secrets of the success (as a movie, don't  know about the box office) is the very ordinariness of the people involved as well as the setting. Don't find out what is coming to get the real impact.

Won't say what happens in that final scene, since I wouldn't want to give anything away.

""This is a good neighborhood!"" - or something like it - was spoken by one of the supporting actors as well at one point, and that ironic statement helps support this theme.  The neighborhood really isn't as good as it seems.  Which one is?  There are  always things going on behind the scenes that are not only not discussed, but hidden as well.  And this neighborhood is surely no different.

Kevin Bacon gives one of his very good performances here; I've always been a fan of his.  As a matter of fact, I sometimes think that he doesn't always get the credit he deserves.  He's had a long career with many film credits and he always brings his A game.  (Sorry for that expression.  I won't use it again, believe me.)  And Kathryn Erbe not only looks good but acts good.  Err, acts well; sorry.  Same for Illeana Douglas.  Watch for a bit part by a gal from the best hospital show ever:  ""House"" (and it ain't even close), but I wasn't exactly convinced that she was developmentally disabled here.  But the cast is pretty decent, across the board.

I watched this film a long time ago, and decided to watch it again.  I vaguely remembered the plot, but it came back to me slowly.  Now I could say, ""Oh, it's SO obvious what happens,"" which would of course be unfair since I had seen it before.  But I think that the average first-time viewer gets enough clues to have an idea of what will happen in this Edgar-Allen-Poe like film.  (That's all the hint that I will give you.)

The film builds character and the plot nicely. By the subway scene, I couldn't help about thinking about how much this movie reminded me of something Steven King might do.

What makes it more interesting is that his 5 yr old son already has these ""psychic abiilities"" and comforts his father ""not to be afraid."" This helps keep him from looking like he is just a ""crazy man"" to his wife and the audience. It is interesting to watch the scene where the policeman in the cemetary communicates with the young boy almost in the way the black caretaker does with the boy in the movie ""The Shining""- he realizes right off he has ""the eyes"" he calls it. This helps the wife understand what the father and son are up against and reestablishes the importance of solving the task at hand. The plot is well moving, always exciting and at times keeps you on the edge of your seat. Every scene serves a purpose and there is no confusing twists or unnecessary filler. I loved the special effects of when he is ""under hypnosis"" how the scenery changes as she puts him under, as well as the scenes where he has communication(visions) with the dead girl, eerie and creepy without being overly frightening. It is a riot to watch Kevin Bacon(Tom) ""dig"" for clues in his rental house. All the pieces really come together at the end and give it a satisfying ending.

72647,4,0784013470,"I'm not certain why I'm reviewing this as so many others already have. I suppose it's because I've seen it for a second time after it's original release and I liked it better this time around.

Here's the scoop. Kevin Bacon and his wife have a young son who appears to be in communication with someone unseen. After a party where Kevin is hypnotized, he gets a glimpse of what his son is communicating with, and it sends him 'round the bend. This leads to the unraveling of a mystery which began in their neighborhood some 6 months earlier.

One of the things that caught my attention was that this story was originally penned by Richard Matheson as a book. He has a boatload of credits to his name both as a book and short story author as well as the dozens of film and TV scripts he's written. He's responsible for many of the episodes of the original ""Twilight Zone"" TV series. That is why, as much as I liked it originally, it seemed a bit out of touch with the times. Like anything else, the approach to writing scripts has changed over the years, and this seemed so 'by the book.' Not at all bad, jut a bit outdated. Also, having been released around the same time as the more popular  ""The Sixth Sense"", which has a similar theme, the differences are striking.

This movie sets up the premise and makes a bee-line for the end. Not many subtleties or meanderings. Just pound this sucker out. The second viewing looked better to me. I appreciated the entire thing a lot more. The acting, particularly, struck me as being better. Bacon is usually good but Katheryn Erbe, as his wife, really jumped out. They paired well. The other actors do a good job as well. Illeana Douglas' character might have been a bit 'too' but that's a minor quibble.

This is a strong, blue collar type outing. It's by the book in a good way. All the production values and directing are solid. If you like a good horror/ mystery this is a great outing.",1311638400,3,1933,4.418539325842697

The disc 's cover/sticker on the disc was not centered and the letters were grainy if anyone was to look closely.

72667,2,0784013470,"I disagree strongly with director and writer David Koepp's belief that he was successful in depicting true-to-life working-class characters from Chicago in ""Stir of Echoes"". There is something very unlikeable and unrealistic about most of the characters in this film. The thing that bothers me the most is the foul language. When Kathyrn Erbe (who plays the wife, Maggie) confronts Tom (played by Kevin Bacon), she crudely confronts him over his vision of a woman who's been haunting their house; she blurts out, ""Did you f--k her?"" Not only does this unsubtle, heavy-handed type of dialogue crop up way too often during the film (and spoken by too many of the characters), it also makes the characters wholly unsympathetic. Don't any of them have any wit or a sense of humor or are they all crude boors who like to get into arguments with one another?

Koepp based 'Stir of Echoes' on a 1958 tale by Richard Matheson (of Twilight Zone fame). The inciting incident, where Tom is hypnotized and begins seeing visions seems quite dated. Hypnosis might have been a big thing for a movie audience in 1958 but by the late 90s it's old hat! I would have liked to have seen something a little more clever and original to propel Tom into his supernatural world.

Many of the characters' actions in this film are way too over the top. I didn't quite believe that the babysitter would kidnap Jake simply because she heard him talking about her missing sister. Most normal teenagers would have calmly told their parents about their suspicions and the parents could have then contacted the police to investigate. Perhaps the most unbelievable part of the film is Maggie's reaction to Tom's obsessions. She visits her friend the hypnotist who advises her to ""get help"" for Tom; but she never follows through. She decides to do everything on her own. Even if you believe that she never notices anything peculiar about her child's behavior (especially Jake telling her to hire the babysitter), she totally ignores everything the psychic cop tells her (spelling it out that her husband has partial psychic powers and the son is fully psychic). She goes home and ends up having another argument with Tom over his visions. It's just too unbelievable that she continues to believe Tom is out of his mind.

Koepp implies that Maggie fears humiliation from her working class friends if word gets out that Tom has lost his marbles and that's why she gains no insight into what's going on. I don't really buy it given all the clues put in front of her but even if one accepts Koepp's scenario, a real person probably would have gone for some outside help.

Koepp settles for some over the top banter between husband and wife with Tom insisting that Maggie has been trying to stop him from discovering ""the most important thing in my life"". In the silliest scene in the movie, Kevin Bacon, sounding like someone who forgot to take his medication, repeats ""I won't stop"" three times as Maggie tries to get him to stop digging up the body. Koepp needs a device to get Maggie out of the house so Tom is left alone for the killers to appear and try and do him in. So out of the blue, Maggie's mother dies and she takes Jake and leaves the house.

Even way before the resolution where the bad guys are dispatched, it seems pretty obvious that a bunch of locals killed the missing girl so I didn't find the film's denouement very gripping. There are a few scenes in ""Stir of Echoes"" that are too drawn out. Koepp could have cut about 10 minutes from the exposition before the hypnosis scene. The same goes for all the digging Kevin Bacon was doing at the end.

Koepp has certainly made a name for himself in Hollywood, penning the the two Spielberg films, 'War of the Worlds' and 'Indiana Jones', which showed a marked improvement over the insufferable ""Spiderman"". Now that he is a prime player in Hollywood, perhaps he might consider tackling subject matter that is intellectually on a higher plane.

72682,4,0784013470,"Stir of Echoes is a supernatural thriller starring Kevin Bacon.  When it was realeased in theaters it was percieved as a Sixth Sense wannabe but it is actually a very good film now that it can be viewed on its own.  Based on the story by Richard Matheson (who was an influence on Stephen King), it is the story of average guy Tom Witzky (Bacon in an outstanding performance) who lives in a working class Chicago neighborhood and undergoes hypnotizm at a party.  That experience changes him and now he has visions and intuitive feelings that understandably begin to creep him out, particularly since he did not believe in the supernatural until this stuff started happening to him.  The mystery he uncovers is not that complex but it is still suspenseful to see unfold.  His new insight drives him to behave in eratic ways putting stress on his wife and son but leading to eerie results.  I think that family relationship is the most interesting part of the film.  In hindsight this movie has only a couple of similarities with Sixth Sense:  a kid who talks to the dead; a ghost that wants something from the living.  But it also has much in common with Stephen King's work (and probably a number of other ghost stories).  I think some of the photography prefigures the interest in Japanese horror films here in America.  And setting the film in Chicago was an interesting choice as well.  David Koepp wrote and directed the film.  He helped Michael Crichton write the screenplay to Jurrasic Park which I was not a fan of but I think this is a film he can be proud of.

His son also has a similar power but only calm to spirits, Tom must find clues of the dead woman so he can get rid of his unwanted powers and find a way to let her spirit rest.

Intriguing and smart psychological supernatural horror thriller based on a novel by Richard Matheson is one of the most overlooked horror movies of all time. It was originally made in 1998 then released later in September 1999 on the month after the successful similar movie ""The Sixth Sense"", some folks and critics have compared to the other movie while some have declaired this to be the better of the two. Sure ""The Sixth Sense"" was an excellent movie in it's own right but this is a more involving and scary thrill-ride as it's truly the best horror movie of 1999 and a must see.

72685,5,0784013470,"Samuel Taylor Coleridge once described it as a ""willing suspension of disbelief."" If you read a book or see a movie that stretches the boundaries of reality, or so you believe, but the art compels you to enter into its dimension and you do so, you have willingly suspended your disbelief.

Are there ghosts? If so, can they visit their needs upon us? Can they grab our attention and demand justice? Is it possible for hypnosis to ""open doors to the impossible?"" Director David Koepp and his convincing cast make the viewer want to suspend disbelief and join them in this 94-minute excursion into the world beyond death.

As usual, Kevin Bacon, one of our best actors, delivers a convincing performance as Tom, the ultimate skeptic. His apology to Maggie for his ordinariness seems out of place at the time, but it foreshadows the unlikely event to follow: his dip into otherworldliness. Another seemingly incongruous scene places Jake (Zachary David Cope) and Maggie (Kathryn Erbe) at a cemetery, where Jake, by seeming happenstance, meets Neil, another open-door traveler into the other world. It is Neil's explanation that helps Maggie grasp the intensity of Tom's visions, but not understand them.

A spare economy of scenes makes each one pertinent to plot development, a sort of one-thing-leads-to-another-to-another-and so on. Maggie's visit to Neil causes her to put a knife in her purse. Her grandmother dies, removing Jake from his bed of feathers. Jake reminds his mother to take her purse, which, of course, puts the knife at hand for the ending. None of this is spoiler material. If you read this beforehand, it will mean nothing except a clicking into place as you view. Afterward, you will say, Aha!

Crime will out, especially when the echoes of the dead, once living, find an ""open door"" to stir through and demand help. Once satisfied, the dead can move on to wherever they go, calmly and peacefully. The door, however, remains ajar.

72704,2,0784013470,"""Stir of Echoes,"" updated from an old novel by Richard Matheson, came out in 1999 soon after the huge hit ""The Sixth Sense."" Whether intentionally or not, the two films resemble each other enormously: the restless dead communicate with a little boy, and an adult is drawn into that communication. ""The Sixth Sense"" (the only truly good thing by director M. Night Shyamalan) is more moody, inventive, and compelling (if a little self-important, like Shyamalan himself); it obviously hit a nerve with audiences and critics. Needless to say, it eclipsed ""Stir of Echoes,"" a decent film but one that treads too well-worn territory. Somehow, the ordinary setting is *too* ordinary. I really didn't care about the dull lives of the characters; they were unappealingly presented. Neither did I care about the ghost, though her victimization in life gave me the same feeling of anger when I hear news items about similar violence against women. The acting is professional but uninspired. It's probably Kevin Bacon's best work, but frankly, that's not saying much. He generally delivers his lines in an uninflected monotone and is stiff throughout; and while Bruce Willis was almost as wooden in ""The Sixth Sense,"" Haley Joel Osment's performance as the prescient child was so overwhelming and expressive that Willis hardly mattered. Here, the kid (played by Zachary David Cope) is almost window dressing so Bacon's dull performance has no help. The direction, by the screenwriter, is unobtrusive at least but it constantly borrows images from other films, often very irritating. Worth a look, but you probably won't want to go back for a second viewing. The extras are plentiful but unbelievably uninteresting. They are presented to look like the analogous features on the DVDs of ""The Ring"" and ""The Sixth Sense."" The distributor, Lions Gate, seemed to think so little of this film's marketability that they felt it necessary to connect it with two more successful--and original--supernatural thrillers of the period by imitating the DVD presentation.",1171756800,2,2044,5.21580547112462
72705,4,0784013470,"I first saw Stir of Echoes on the SciFi channel, and I really enjoyed it. When I saw the film at the store this evening, I pounced on it.

This film is definitely well-filmed and very well-acted. Kevin Bacon and Kathryn Erbe are believable as a married couple, and the little boy who plays their son is great. I usually find that children play parts that are too precocious or too (whether purposely or not) annoying, but this boy was quite realistic.

I wouldn't call myself a huge horror or thriller fan, but this one was really good. (It helped that I watched it with the lights on....) The story did get somewhat predictable toward the end, but that certainly didn't stop me from buying it so I could watch it again.

One technical aspect that I didn't like--on the Special Edition DVD, the menus are incredibly annoying; this is probably kind of hard to grasp without actually seeing what I'm talking about. The menu design is supposed to be edgy--the menu names wibble and shift with distortions, and occasionally the text completely disappears. Again, this is part of the design because it corresponds to some scenes in the film and it adds to the mood. However, when I'm trying to actually access the deleted scenes or play the film, I don't want to have to wait and make sure I have ""Play"" selected while all I can see on the screen is the word ""See"" backwards.

Besides, after A Pure Formality and Final Approach, I already knew what the twist in that film would be.  Particularly realistic in Stir of Echoes was the involuntary and unconscious urges, instincts, and blurtings that occured.  When my great grandfather died I did exactly the same thing Bacon's character does at the kitchen table over orange juice.  I was like three at the time.  Ditto when I found out about my sister being pregnant and blurting out ""it's a girl.""  The flashes of red in this film, while not accurate, are a good metaphor for the emotional charges or flashes you perceive.  Do I know what causes this stuff or why I can do this and not others?  Is it dead people causing it?  The zietgeist or whatever?  Can I start describing the way the universe is or prescribing a particular philosophy you should adhere to?  I haven't got a frigg'n clue, but not only is this a well made film, with good acting, photography, music, sound effects, and writing, but it also portrays this phenomenon in a way that makes me think someone involved in its creation had first hand experience with it.  It'd be nice to say I've followed through with things like Bacon's character does, but I got to admit usually I've chickened out.  If you don't know what I'm talking about, then just enjoy it as a film.

Cast:  Kevin Bacon, Zachary David Cope, Kathryne Erbe, Illeana Douglas, Kevin Dunn, Conor O'Farrell, Lusia Strus, Stephen Eugene Walker.

Running Time:  99 minutes

Rated R for violence, sexuality and language.

""Stir of Echoes"" is more like a very good murder/mystery thriller then a film about the paranormal. Combining both crime and the supernatural by both the writer and director of the movie Richard Matheson and David Koepp and doing it as well as they did put it a step or two above even the great supernatural movie ""The Sixth Sense"" which ""Stir of Echoes"" is always compared too and was released just about the same time in the summer of 1999.  Unlike ""The Sixth Sense"" there's no slick and tricky ending that will have you want to go back to see the film over again to spot what you missed, the ending of ""Stir of Echoes"" is straight-forward and direct and hits you right between the eyes and unlike the Bruce Willis classic you do see it coming. Renting a house in a Chicago working-class neighborhood Tom Witzky, a telephone worker, and his wife Maggie, Kathryn Erbe, and little boy Jack, Zachary David Cope, seem to be fitting it with those living around them.  Little Jack later seems to be seeing things and talking to himself but that does not bother his parents since they think that it's normal for a little boy to daydream. One night Tom and Maggie go to see Maggie's friend Lisa, Illeana Douglas, who dabbles in the occult and the supernatural and Tom reluctantly agrees to be hypnotized by her and the results opens his mind to a world that he scarcely knew and didn't, up to then, believe in. Like his son Jack Tom has, as it's called in the movie, ""The Eye"" to see disembodied spirits or people and one of the spirits that both he and young Jack see is a young girl Samantha Kozac, Jennifer Morrison, who's been missing since last March when she disappeared from sight. One night Debbie, Liza Well, Samantha's sister was baby-sitting Jack and when she heard him mention Samantha and that he knows where she is Debbie loses it and almost kidnapped Jack in order to have him tell her where she can find her sister.

Tom also starts seeing flashes of light and ghostly appearances that become more and more real to the point where his wife Maggie thinks that he's losing his mind and, together with little Jack, almost leaves him. As Tom's mind becomes more tuned in with the astral world, that world that between life and death, he realizes that Samantha is somehow connected with the house he living in and that she did not disappeared last March in some kind of accident but was murdered and that her body was hidden somewhere in the house by her murderer or murderers.  The story is very effective, presented more as a psychological horror film rather than the grisly gore so prevalent in the genre. Numerous comparisons have been made between this film and `The Shining' and `Close Encounters of the Third Kind', somehow implying that because this film used some of the effective devices from those films, it is without value. I couldn't disagree more. There is a difference between ripping off a story and adapting effective devices used in other films. This film did the later par extraordinaire. This story used a novel approach to a well plowed genre. It combined the supernatural element with a mystery to produce a powerful hybrid. Forget the comparison with `Sixth Sense'. The only thing these films had in common was dead people.

Writer/Director David Koepp did a terrific job in both capacities. The story was plausible, frightening and drew the viewer in. There were some dangling dead end plot lines (Maggie's pregnancy disappeared as a plot element after the announcement; and what was Neil about?) that just wasted our time. But mostly, everything fit together well. The direction was fabulous; designed to scare the hell out of you and that it did. Koepp created incredible suspense without the use of expensive special effects, simply by using the camera and sound effectively. Kevin Bacon was at the top of his game in this film. His obsession with finding Samantha was played with intensity and single mindedness. Kathryn Erbe was also good as Maggie, bringing both strength and passion to the part.  An extremely underrated, underappreciated thriller that rivals many of the late 1990's and early part of the 2000 decade.",1141171200,2,4391,4.784676354029062

Trying to ignore or shake off the phenomenon as the product of a stressed imagination does little good for, as Tom finds out, when the dead want to be heard they can be very persistent.  Released theatrically very close to the time of ""The Sixth Sense"", this movie has suffered from a perception that two 'talking to the dead' movies in one summer would have to be too similar, and that the lower profile one (Stir) would be of a weak quality.  I feel that's a mistake on both parts.  The two movies are similar but certainly not clones of one another, and while I don't feel ""Stir Of Echoes"" reached the heights of ""The Sixth Sense"" it's not weak at all either.  It's a fine, creepy thriller with quality performances and production, and certainly shouldn't be forgotten just because it didn't reap hundreds of millions at the box office.

72734,4,0784013470,"This sounds incredible, but it took almost six years for 'Stir of Echoes' to arrive in theaters in Japan, and the reason for this delay is, I believe, the film's accidental resemblance with 'The Sixth Sense.'  Well, but many people have already pointed that out, so let's not talk about it now.  Maybe I should talk about how thrilling this thriller can be.

Kevin Bacon gives strong acting as Tom, who is hypnotized for a lark by his sister-in-law, and starts to see things.  And he realizes that his only son also has the same ability to see.  The only difference is that his son is able to see clearer, even people -- particularly, a girl named Samantha.  Tom's new ability results in his obsession with the girl, or the truths behind the images, and guided by the strange images, his quest leads him to the unexpected place where the key is hidden.

'Stir of Echoes' is directed by David Koepp, whose track record as writer (before 'Stir') include 'Carlito's Way' 'Mission Impossible' (with Robert Towne), 'The Lost World' and 'Snake Eyes.'  Impressive record?  Innovative writing?  I don't think so.  And I didn't mention 'The Trigger Effect' which he also directed, or 'The Secret Window' he is to direct later.  To his credit, none of these films stink; they all have something to offer.  However, none of them shows outstanding qualities, perhaps except the visuals.

Like these films, 'Stir of Echoes' starts with great premise, and solidly develops the idea in the middle of the story (slightly overstepping here and there), and ... here's the important part ... ends with a weak, predictable conclusion.  Not that this thriller is not entertaining.  I'm only talking about the weakness of the last act.  I admit the visuals are often impressive (Tom's consciousness while hypnotized is brilliantly expressed).  And the strong acting from the two leads Kevin Bacon and Kathryn Erbe as Tom's wife make up for that ... almost.

So what should I say if you have not seen it?  Should I recommend?  Yes.  But do not try to find a big secret in the ending, which avid thriller fans can foresee from miles away.  After all David Koepp is the guy who has also co-written the script of Tom Cruise's 'War of the World' (with Josh Friedman), and what you find here is spooky images and often disturbing scenes, not a surprise ending.  But perhaps this kind of thriller of which atmosphere matters most, does not need it.",1129939200,,2419,4.7458033573141485

What becomes unusual is when Tim is hypnotized during a party.  Suddenly, Tim experiences unusual and bizarre nightmares, including situations where he not only sees things, but experiences things physically.

Tim tries to have the hypnotist undo whatever she did, but she is unable to do so, because she really does not know what she did.  Tim's visions increase as he becomes obsessed with more than finding out the source of the visions.  For some reason he is being compelled by a ghost to do something, for a reason that he has yet to understand.  As Tim's obsession/compulsion grows, his wife Maggie (Kathryn Erbe) begins to think that Tim is either insane or heading in that direction.

As we follow Tim's descent into madness, a number of occurrences convince us that either his insanity is quite vivid (for the skeptics among us), or he truly is seeing a ghost.  Eventually we are convinced that he is seeing a ghost, which makes his situation even more frightening, because the ghost becomes insistent to the extent of putting Tim and possibly Jake's life in danger.

This movie contains sufficient psychological thrills in combination with jump out from behind the corner scares and an ending that I did not see coming to give it advantages over ""The Sixth Sense.""  This movie is not necessarily better than ""The Sixth Sense"" because it is a different kind of movie.  However, it is its equal in setting up an eerie atmosphere and superior in providing several moments that gave me a nice jump (when was the last time you saw a dead girl unexpectedly sitting next to you on the couch?).

Kevin Bacon provides an incredible performance in this movie.  I consider Kevin's performance superior to Bruce Willis's because of the intensity of Kevin's character, and the need to play someone who appeared on the borderline of being insane yet knowing that he was under a terrible compulsion that he did not control.  The combination of emotions Kevin attained was more difficult than Bruce Willis's rather staid role.

The supporting actors completed the rather mundane scenario, which could have been acted out in your neighborhood, just around the corner.  The people seemed so real, so normal.  Their dreams and actions were those of people that likely you know.  It is their very normalcy and that this story takes place in a suburb rather than an isolated location that makes this story scarier.

This movie is one of the best ghost stories I have watched, and I consider it to be one of the best ghost stories of all time.  Well worth watching more than once and having in your horror movie collection.",1105228800,12,3551,4.8344370860927155

He begins having visions which won't leave him alone, until he chooses to do something about them.  He doesn't like this new gift and would be happy to get rid of it, but there is no way out than to go ahead and get to the bottom of it and follow what he's instructed to do.

72765,4,0784013470,"""Stir of Echoes"" succeeds because of the talents of a pair of individuals who are under-appreciated in Hollywood.  First, there is Richard Matheson, whose novel is adapted here by writer-director David Koepp.  Just in terms of novels that have been made into movies Matheson has on his resume ""I Am Legend,"" ""What Dreams May Come,"" ""Bid Time Return"" (filmed as ""Somewhere in Time""), ""Someone Is Bleeding,"" ""Hell House,"" and ""The Shrinking Man"" (which the babysitter is reading in this movie).  There we can talk about 16 episodes of ""The Twilight Zone,"" the scripts for the television movies ""Duel"" and ""The Night Talker,"" and the screenplays for ""House of Usher"" and ""The Pit and the Pendulum.""  Matheson should be mentioned in the same breath with Rod Serling and Stephen King, and have his name appear before the title, but after all these years I am left with the feeling that the only ones who have always recognized Matheson as being that good are fellow writers like Serling and King.

The other person whose reputation with audiences is not as good as it is with his peers is Kevin Bacon.  The actor held his own with Oscar winners Sean Penn and Tim Robbins in ""Mystic River,"" and while there were certainly reviews that noted how well he did in his less flashier role, you know that most audience members cannot think of him with (a) figuring out how to get from whatever movie they are watching to one in which he starred, (b) humming the theme from ""Footloose,"" or (c) both.  In ""Stir of Echoes"" it is Bacon's performance of a working stiff that grounds Matheson's ghost story in the world of the living, which is what makes it chilling.

There is a sense in which ""Stir of Echoes"" is a combination of ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Mystic River,"" but simply on the level where we have a ghost story set in a working class neighborhood.  Tom (Bacon) is married to Maggie (Kathryn Erbe), and they have a five-year-old named Jake (Zachary David Cope).  They never notice that their son talks to somebody who is not there and asks questions about whether it hurts to be dead.  One night at a party Tom agrees to be hypnotized by Maggie's sister, Lisa (Illeana Doulgas), who plays around with the idea of being a New Age mystic.  When Tom comes out of his trance he is not quite sure what happened while he was under.  But when he starts seeing the ghost of a young girl (Jenny Morrison), he knows it has something to do with being hypnotized and eventually Lisa confesses that she did make a post-hypnotic suggestion that she thought would improve her brother-in-law.

Tom's life starts coming apart as he becomes obsessed with finding out what the ghost wants, especially once he learns that her name is Samantha and that she was a girl from the neighborhood who disappeared the year before. Tom never wanted to be famous, but he is bothered by the fact that his life is so ordinary.  Well, those days (and nights) are behind him now.  It is up to his wife to have a chance encounter with the person, Neil the Cop (Eddie Bo Smith Jr.) who explains what has happened: a switch has been thrown and Tom is now a receiver.  If he does not do what the ghost requires, then he will never be free.  But Tom does not understand what is required and risks losing not only his job, but his friends and family.

The rule in films such as this one is to express madness by going over the top, but Bacon heads in the opposite direction.  As he is confronted with nightmarish visions he becomes more withdrawn.  Characters haunted by ghosts are rarely so soft spoken.  Bacon's choice is perfect for both the character and the story, for when Samantha is able to communicate a single word, ""Dig,"" it reinforces the idea that the truth of this tale is buried not only with Tom's house, but within himself as well.  His acceptance of what he is being asked to do has elements is more than weary resignation, for he understands that there is a wrong to be righted.

How good of a ghost story you think ""Stir of Echoes"" ends up having to do with how far ahead you get of Tom in his quest to put everything together.  Once Tom starts digging he spends a lot of time digging in the wrong places, and while he is busy doing that pieces start to fall into place.  Koepp plays with us a bit with regards to what is really happening to Tom and his visions.  The ones from the past are easy to figure out, but there are also looks into the future that can fake you out, which can be annoying as well.  But Bacon's performance makes up for these flaws and even if the endgame of ""Stir of Echoes"" takes the story back to familiar ground, it is still a lot better than most of the horror films I have seen since this 1999 film came out.",1099785600,,4708,4.4557109557109555

72767,4,0784013470,"Although it was branded as a variation on ""The Sixth Sense"", ""Stir of Echoes"" (based on Richard Matheson's terrific novel ""A Stir of Echoes"" I guess the ""A"" got lost on the way to the box office)focuses on what director/writer David Koepp does best. Koepp's film createa an intense psychological thriller where everyone believes the main character is crazy except us. We know what he knows and, as a result, we fear for his sanity almost as much as his loved ones because we know he isn't insane.

Kevin Bacon gives a startling and powerful performance as a Tom Witzky a regular family guy who, after being hynotized by his sister-in-law (Illeana Douglas) begins seeing visions that suggest a murdered girl's ghost is trying to communicate with him. He's driven to try and uncover who committed the murder but, more importantly, help put her soul to rest before he loses his mind and his family. Koepp's film eschews conventional ""horror"" film conventions because it isn't a horror film at all.

Overlooked when it was first released, ""Stir of Echoes"" has one of Bacon's best, most intense performances. The imaginative, sharp direction also highlights Matheson's haunting ghost story. This new special edition has most of the features of the earlier release plus a number of new featurettes including ""The Mind's Eye: Beneath the Trance"", ""Sight of Spirits: Channeling the Paranormal"", ""Special Effects Featurette"" plus deleted scenes, a production design featurette and other extras. We also get Director David Koepp's original commentary track from the previous edition, the music video ""Breathe"" by Moist and the two making of featurettes.

The transfer itself appears to be a new transfer with slightly better image quality than the previous edition. The exceptional soundtrack also has a new 6.1 DTS commentary plus a Dolby Digital 5.1 EX remix of the soundtrack as well. The sound is crisp without a hint of the compression that frequently mars most transfers. Overall, a terrific transfer plus some nice extras.

72806,4,0784013470,"David Koepp who wrote and directed ""Secret Window"" and has written movies like ""Panic Room"", ""Spider-Man"",and ""Jurrasic Park"",made a pretty darned genius film that was pretty underated.

Keopp like M.Night Shyamalan relies on sound effects and quick snippets of gory things,like fingernails snapping off someones hand to scare you but Koepp makes it work. Kevin Bacon gives a great performance,I mean there's no way he would get an Oscar nomination for this movie or anything but it's a good performance. Bacon plays Tom. A blue collar man with a wife and boy who acts rather strangeley,talking to himself or is it someone else. One night at a party his hypnotist sister-in-law hypnotizes him and after that he begins seeing and hearing horrifying visions of a dead girl. What happens next is basically a cliche,with Tom attempting to discover the secret of the ghost.

While his son continues to talk to her. I bought the original version but when this version came out,I bought this version and sold the other one and this is definitley a better DVD. It's got

some of the same things,commentary by David Koepp and such(which people should listen too). But it has some new,improved features.

The case is rather loose and maddening but whatever. Illeana Scott is great in the film as is the little boy who plays Kevin Bacon's son. Now another thing I must mention is that the film isn't really a mystery,it's not to hard to figure out what's happening but,the film is really good either way.

72807,3,0784013470,"This is not a bad movie.  It is reasonably well made, although it has dubiously long sequences of Kevin Bacon searching for power tools and using said power tools w/o any serious tension, as we know exactly what he will find, as does he.  Also, the background crime and its perpetrators were too easy to discern halfway through the film, and some variation of the confrontation was obvious 40 minutes into the film.  The film has an effective mood, and a couple of jolts...
My problem w/ films like this, and I know there are those of you like me, is this:  In horror, in Supernatural horror, the supernatural has to be malevolent and it has to be the threat.  If an average human is a greater threat to the protagonist than the ghost--which seems to be the common norm of most modern horror/thrillers (Below, 6th Sense, What Lies Beneath, The Others, 28 Days Later, this)--then it does nothing for me.  It's not scary.  A ghost trying to warn you or avenge its death isn't scary.  Sure, the film may manipulate some jumps out of you w/ quick shots of the practically harmless ghost, but after you've experience the thrills, what remains?  Once you know the secret of ""The Others"", what could possibly be scary about the movie after a second viewing?  The Exorcist is still scary, because that movie is about an evil presence out to harm you.  The Ring gave me some uneasy nights, I admit, because the threat was evil.  The Blair Witch Project, the same thing.  There's nothing scary about the ghosts in this, in The Others, in the 6th Sense.
So, if you really enjoyed movies w/ ghosts who are only harmful in their pop-up-out-of-no-where powers, and human conspiracies about failed coverups scare you more, then you'd like this.  If, however, it's the vile nature of the beast that keeps you up at night, then you'd feel you had wasted money on this picture.",1089158400,,1859,4.6109422492401215

Kevin Bacon is outstanding in this film, quite possibly his best performance ever.  He plays a loving husband with one child.  One evening after experimenting with hypnotherapy, he acquires strange powers which allows him to see evil things that have occurred or are about to occur.  This might sound far-fetched, but it really works, and does not deter from the quality of this script.
When I first saw this film, I became very spooked, and had to check that all the doors were locked.  Films that can create this sort of eeeriness are few and far between, and worth a look.

I don't see the similarity, personally; true, both are about people who can see ghosts and try to help them uncover the truth behind their deaths, but so was Hamlet.  ""Stir of Echoes"" is much edgier and darker than the ""Sixth Sense""--and it really helps the movie shine because of it.
I guess one of the main reasons that I feel that ""Echoes"" is superior is because I feel it's more realistic in the sense that the ghost is angry over her death--and will resort to unscrupulous means to have her death avenged.  The ghosts in the Sixth Sense, by comparison, were pretty stupid.  And don't get me started on the entire ""the ghost are just misunderstood"" angle.

72850,5,0784013470,"Stir of Echoes has something that most movies do not have-a story adapted from a Richard Matheson novel.  I haven't had a chance to read this particular novel as of yet and thus cannot say how closely the movie follows it, but the fact that we have this movie as a result of director David Koepp's chance reading of the highly talented Matheson's 1958 novel is a powerful argument for keeping the works of the truly great writers in print and readily available to all.  Certainly, there is a Sixth Sense quality to this movie, quite by accident and somewhat to its misfortune in terms of the timing of its theatrical release, but this movie stands on its own quite nicely.  Kevin Bacon gives a remarkable performance as Tom Witzky, a man haunted by visions he can neither understand nor escape from.  These disturbing visions first come to him after he is hypnotized by his sister-in-law at a party, and almost immediately they begin to consume him.  His wife Maggie (Kathryn Erbe) grows frantic with worry, while his son Jake (Zachary David Cope making his feature film debut) eases his transition into this strange new mental world.  Jake has been talking to ghosts throughout his childhood, especially Samantha, the teenager Tom unexpectedly encounters on his couch that first night and seeks to ""find"" again.  Samantha wants him to do something, and Tom's struggle involves finding out just what that something is.  There are plenty of creepy scenes to be enjoyed, and the visual presentation of Samantha is especially well done; the unnatural way she moves was captured by having Jennifer Morrison walk especially slowly and filming her using a different frame rate than normal.  It's remarkably effective.  The visions are also impressive-we see what Tom sees and can understand the frustration he feels at not being able to interpret them.  All he gets are scattered images, and it is up to him to put all of the pieces of the puzzle together.  The mystery of Samantha's disappearance is not obvious, thank goodness, and this fact allows for a truly spectacular end to this movie.
This is a thoroughly enjoyable, thought-provoking film, one more than capable of pleasing stalwart horror lovers like myself as well as more mainstream viewers who wander into the realm of the cinematic supernatural only on special occasions or by accident.  The acting is superb on all counts, from Bacon on down the line to Cope, and the rather subdued special effects really work marvelously and help reinforce the believability of the otherwise fantastic story.  There is a definite air of realism and plausibility here, and that helps maintain a crucial connection between the audience and the film.
The special features offered on the DVD are good things to have, but they don't really increase your enjoyment of the movie itself.  The featurette is actually rather short in length and mainly features short interviews with the cast and crew.  The behind the scenes featurette seems rather strange; you just get very short looks at cast and crew preparing or doing their work, and there is no effort to explain anything that you are seeing.  Of course, the DVD also features a commentary by director David Koepp for those who really want to dig deeply into the genesis of this action-packed thriller.  I was disappointed to find no deleted scenes included on the DVD, though; normally, I'm not that high on deleted scenes because most of the time it is quite easy to see why they were deleted.  In the production notes for Stir of Echoes, though, Koepp refers to a scene featuring Samantha which he found too creepy to include in the final cut; I would really have liked to have a look at that scene.
Stir of Echoes is a great example of realistic suspense done right.  Foregoing blood and heavy-handed horror tactics, director David Koepp has succeeded in giving us an electrifying, deliciously creepy, intellectually stimulating supernatural thriller every bit as exciting and memorable as The Sixth Sense.",1045267200,,4002,4.918276374442794

72855,4,0784013470,"I must say I was surprised when I read the book after seeing the movie.  I think the movie is just better, as a whole work of its own, than the book.  It maintains a better sense of creepiness, and makes a little more sense.  The characters are developed a little more, and in my opinion they act more realistically.  Especially the wife character, as you get to see much more of her reaction to her husband's unravelling due to his visions.  This movie has two of the scenes that truly scared me, the first being when Tom first sees the ghost, and the second being the series of shots where the ghost ""plays"" with Tom's wife and child.  My Japanese girlfriend could understand this movie with only a very basic grasp of English, which is always a plus.  A good afternoon popcorn movie.",1019692800,,786,4.416666666666667

They have some similarities, yes, but the storyline is totally different. Kevin Bacon is fantastic in this film. he is hypnotized by his sister-in-law at a party and begins receiving horrifying and eerie images in his mind of a shy girl named Samantha Koufax. He only sees bits and pieces of these images and he tries to place them together to figure out what they mean. He will stop at nothing to figure out this mystery whether it means tearing apart his house, his marriage or his life. It's a non-stop thriller that will keep your interest peaked and keep you guessing throughout the film. This is a good movie to watch in the dark!!! Maybe it doesn't get the accolades of The Sixth Sense but I believe it's just as good.",1016755200,9,835,4.5
72867,3,0784013470,"Stir of Echoes had an unremarkable run at the boxoffice. While it only faintly resembles The Sixth Sense, it had enough plot similarities for it to be compared unfavorably to that phenomenal smash hit. The truth is that, for a movie of its type, its business was about average. How we media journalists love to make comparisons! What was really happening in Media Land was this: The small company that released Stir of Echoes was Artisan, which also distributed the sleeper hit The Blair Witch Project. So, like in the case of the Rams' winning the Super Bowl, many of us were eager to say that Artisan couldn't do it twice. As a group, we tend to root for the little guy only until he actually wins. A more convincing case might be made that movies headlining poor Kevin Bacon rarely make money. At least there we have several years worth of data.
When the movie opens, we see Tony Witsky [Bacon] sitting on his bed strumming a guitar. In the adjoining bathroom, his six-year old son is taking a bath. From Tony's point of view, the boy seems to be babbling on like many kids do. From ours, he looks as though he is talking to someone only he can see. Our viewpoint is the correct one, for this is a ghost story. At first, no one pays any attention to the child, and when they do, they don't believe him. Later on, Tony has good reason to know his son is telling the truth, and the apparition becomes their secret world. Of course, how a child would handle such a situation is quite different from how an adult would, and one of the delights of the movie is in seeing the huge difference in their reactions.
Like most movie ghosts, the dead girl in this one is hanging around until justice is done. Her problem is something Tony and his wife Maggie [Katherine Erbe] have no way to deal with. Although Tony dreams of being a rock star, the couple is basically an ordinary one living in a working-class Chicago neighborhood. They have a good marriage. They are well-liked. The extent of their adventures up to know seems limited to beer-drinking parties and to dealing with Maggie's off-the-wall sister, Lisa [Ileana Douglas], who is studying to be a hypno-therapist.
As a tale, Stir of Echoes is genuinely spooky. Tony's uncovering of the ghost's terrible secret merely leads to yet more horror. There are few special effects. Director David Keopp doesn't need them. He makes great use of lightening and sound. There are a few problems with the movie, most of them to do with characterization. Tony tends to be indecisive, and I suspect that such a person would usually choose flight over fight. Maggie gets so loud and agitated when she's angry that it makes the idea of a good marriage a little suspect. When it becomes obvious that Tony has gone over the edge, not only does no one try to intercede, no one even pays much attention. Still, these defects in the plot's structure don't do irreparable harm to the thrill and chill aspects. They do cause Stir of Echoes to be a good movie, rather than a great one.",1016582400,,3013,4.540441176470588
72868,1,0784013470,"I was looking forward to seeing this DVD after remembering some exciting-looking trailers, but the movie disappointed me.  Even taking into account the obvious similarities to ""The Sixth Sense"" (which I thought was much more well done) and an influence of both movies, ""The Shining"", I never got the impression that I was watching anything original.  ""Stir of Echoes"" is a rote supernatural-themed thriller that probably worked better in the original book than it does on the big screen.
Kevin Bacon's character does start to get developed a little in the beginning of the movie as we find out that he wants to be more than an ""ordinary guy"", but this never goes anywhere.  He starts having bizarre visions after being hypnotized by his wife's sister (played by Illeana Douglas, whose role as a dippy academic was funny in ""Ghost World"" but is just annoying here).  The most effective bits of the movie for me were the brief snippets of visions shown through Kevin Bacon's point of view ... whether seeing them in real-time or in DVD freeze-frame, they were both scary and intriguing.
Unfortunately, the movie doesn't take the premise anywhere new or exciting.  None of the characters are interesting, there are shots and scenes that seem portentous but lead nowhere ... the movie seemed rather underwritten, as we get only brief sketches of the different characters and stretches of superfluous visual filler.  The movie is basically a murder thriller but the suspense is undermined by the predictability.  I'm afraid that for me the only memorable part (in a positive way) of ""Stir of Echoes"" was the pleasant Beth Orton song at the end of the movie.",1016496000,5,1652,4.920863309352518

It is rated R, so it can be more violent, more scary, and more disturbing.  Everything ties in to make sense at the end.  The music ""Paint it Black"" is great.  Kevin Bacon has the role of his life.  This movie is much better than the book.  This DVD comes with special features, a good commentary, a good video.  The one problem is that it has no subtitles.  We need english subtitles to read the lines during the commentary.  But, still it is a great must buy DVD.

72870,5,0784013470,"Talk about a nail-biting thriller, ""Stir of Echoes"" is a supernatural journey into the unknown.  Brilliantly written and directed, this is a movie that shouldn't be missed by anyone.
Kevin Bacon stars as Tom.  Tom is an ordinary man who loves his family and is devoted to his job.  The only thing he wishes is that he wasn't so ordinary.  Everything drastically changes at a neighborhood party when Tom is hypnotized for a brief period of time.  After that unforgettable night, Tom starts seeing things; haunting and violent images that he can't stop or ignore.  He hears things that he cannot block from his eardrums.  Later on, he discovers that what he is witnessing are possible puzzle pieces to an unspeakable crime that took place a while back.  As Tom starts losing it and is determined to solve the unbearable puzzle that haunts him day and night, the more danger he puts him and his family into.
In a way, this was the movie that ""Sixth Sense"" was trying to be.  I felt that this movie was a lot more shocking and haunting.  The movie has great acting and a fabulous screenplay.  This is a movie you may not want to watch late at night, unless you don't mind a nightmare or two.  It's too bad that this movie came out the same time that ""The Sixth Sense"" did, otherwise it would've gotten more recognition; well deserved recognition at that.  There are a few extras on the DVD for those of you who enjoy what special features DVDs have to offer, including a behind the scenes feature, a music video, and a couple of trailers.
This is a great thriller that should've gotten a hell of a lot more recognition.  Rent or buy this one as soon as you can.  If you love a dark thriller, then you will not be disappointed.  Be warned; there are some shocking and disturbing images that may be hard to stomach for some; not for those who get disturbed easily.  ""Stir of Echoes"" is filled with thrills and surprises that you won't want to miss.  It also has an excellent plot with a surprising climax.

The story is about a man who ends up getting a hypnotised during a party winds up living a real nightmare when he discovers than he can comminucate with the dead. I do not like to give the plot but it's definetly worth the watch.

72875,4,0784013470,"Other reviewers have mentioned The Sixth Sense as a comparison for Stir of Echoes.  Steven King's The Shining also has some similarities which are worth noting. In all these films a young child is sensitive to the restless spirits who want human intervention to right a wrong.  Additionally, this is the premise of the film Ghost, with Demi Moore and Patrick Swayze.  Stir of Echoes is as believable as the rest of these watchable films.
While not as frightening as something like The Exorcist, a classic, Stir of Echoes has fine performances by the entire cast and carefully builds suspense as we watch Kevin Bacon go from doubter in the supernatural to obsessed with finding what happened to a missing girl who haunts him and his young son.
The Irish seem particularly interested in ghosts.  W.B. Yeats, perhaps the greatest poet of the 20th century, spent much of his adult life trying to communicate with the spirit world, and had some success, if we are to believe his reports in many of his published works.  More recently, Van Morrison talked about the Irish sensitivity to ghosts in discussing his performance of the great Patrick Kavanaugh song, Raglan Road.  In other words, we are prepared to suspend disbelief in what appears to be absurd because so many gifted people seem to think that contacting the dead is possible.
Stir of Echoes also owes a debt to Edgar Allan Poe's superb short story, The Cask of Amontillado.  In his obsession to find the missing girl, Kevin Bacon begins to tear down his house to find her.  At this point the story turns grisly as the dark secret of Poe's story is revealed in this new twist on Poe's orginal idea. The action moves relentlessly to a credible conclusion.
This is one of those films that surprise the viewer who may not be expecting to see a well made movie. The direction is tight and the dialogue well written.  The ending makes sense given the careful presentation of the various subplots that have been introduced. Kevin Bacon is the driving force in this film and he shows once again that he deserves to be in the top tier of American actors.",1003190400,4,2102,4.690217391304348

The only similarity it has with the said film is the father/son's special gift of being able to see & talk to dead people.  The similarity ends there as Stir of Echoes offers much more in terms of story plot & characterization.
Unlike the 6th Sense where the surprise ending spoils the story if you watch it the 2nd time around, I still cannot get enough of the ""surprises"" here in Stir of Echoes.

i have to say that, while it was not the best horror/suspense/psychological drama i have seen, it left me with a very definite sense of closure.  The lack of supernatural events other than the uncannily haunting of the intuition struck me as particularly realistic.  If you are skeptical of the power of hypnotism, the ability called the ""sixth sense"", or any of the more nebulous psychological phenomena, you may not embrace the concept of this film as
whole-heartedly as i did.
The idea that some people ""shine"" - i.e., have the ability to pick up on sensations and ambient forces invisible to most of us is one that i completely subscribe to, having an albeit very small ""shine"" myself.  On that note,  i cannot deny certain parallels to the movies ""The Shining"", but they are thematic rather than formulaic or contrived.
i did not anticipate the ending, which in my opinion was tremendously satisfying.  OK - this all makes sense now!  i seldom leave a movie, no matter WHAT the genre, feeling this way, and it was refreshing.
The ""Stir of Echoes"" was very low on the gore and shock, but quite sufficient in suspense and creepiness to keep this viewer a bit on edge. to elaborate on the plot would be unconscionable.  Better to watch the movie, as i did, with no preconceptions.

Besides being able to predict the future, he also sees a ghost from the past that has a mystery for him to solve.  Incidentally, his son starts to exhibit some of the same powers and his wife becomes thoroughly alienated. This movie is at once simpler and tighter that the source material.  While the movie does not linger on the thoughts that Wallace is bombarded by like Matheson did in the novel, the movie is much more driven and suspenseful around the murder mystery. The players in this movie are very good, with a surprisingly strong performance from Kevin Bacon.  The directing is good and suspensful, and while this movie doesn't live up to the level of the Sixth Sense, it is much better than most of the horror/suspense movies that come out these days (can anyone say, The Haunting).

72932,2,0784013470,"Stir of Echoes
Score: 41/100
People had been talking about Stir of Echoes around New Zealand, saying it was 10 times scarier than The Sixth Sense and it was very well commercialised. But, Stir of Echoes borrows so heavily from The Sixth Sense that it might as well have been titled The Seventh Sense, and it is a huge disappointment.
Tom (Kevin Bacon) is a regular guy, a utilities lineman, married, with a young son, his wife is pregnant; he hangs out with long-time pals in a Chicago neighborhood. At a party, his sister-in-law hypnotizes him, and he goes into a deep trance. Before waking him, she suggests that he keep his mind open. That night he sees flashes of violence and the ghost of a young woman. His young son, too, is ""a receiver,"" but while the boy is calm and coherent in his conversations with spirits, Tom is confused and agitated. Over time, the young woman's story comes to the surface, and Tom begins a hunt for her body that puts him and his usually understanding wife, Maggie (Katherine Erbe), in grave danger.
Stir of Echoes does not only take scenes from The Sixth Sense, it uses The Shining's story, man-goes-crazy-and-freaks-family-out, and it basically insults the brilliance of Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece. Most of the performances are laughable, especially Kevin Bacon and Zachary David Cope in a stupidly over-blown chemistry, but, Katherine Erbe manages to an okay heroine, though she does not put nearly enough effort in to save this film. The easy way to say it is this film is predictable, annoying and boring, and does not deserve the critical-acclaim and large audience it got.
The finale is entertaining and neatly done, but, guess what! It uses exactly the same techniques as The Green Mile did! God, it's becoming uncountable how many movies this borrows from. Stir of Echoes is a passable and mostly lame horror film that always tries to score, and never earns many points.",984787200,,1916,4.826747720364741
72933,4,0784013470,"First of all, let me get the comparisons with 'Sixth Sense' out of the way. Has to be done though because even the Director of 'Echoes' - David Koepp (in the DVD commentary add on) makes a indirect (and complimentary) reference to that earlier released movie when he talks about the cold breathe effects used by the director of 'Sixth Sense' - M. Night Shyamalan. To me the titles of the movies could have been exchanged as 'Echoes' plot relies  centrally on the development of this 'sixth sense' by Tom Witzky allowing him to see and hear the afterlife.
Back to the present life now and this good movie. Tom (Kevin Bacon), a telephone lineman and his wife Maggie (Kathryn Erbe) are trying to make ends meet, improve the life they share with son Jake (Zachary David Cope) and hold onto their dreams. Tom still wants to be a rock musician but is coming to the realization that mid life responsibilities bring ""I never wanted to be famous. I just never expected to be so... ""What?"" Maggie asks. ...""I don't know. ordinary"" Suburban life in America for most of us huh? Not quite. The old adage of being careful of what you wish for applies here. On a drunken dare, with his sister-in-law, Tom states that he can't be hypnotized. She tries, and he is.
If the idea of hypnosis allowing you to perceive another reality is really bothersome to you then switch off. That is the central theme of the movie and is what the plot depends on. It's not overly done though and there is no 'message' attached, it's just the vehicle the movie uses to explore the underlying crime and the afterlife. The ghosts that come with it provide the horrific visions and clues that help Tom solve the mystery.
Overall the movies plot holds together, the acting is excellent, the horror is subtle, not gory -but scary (Tom watching TV on the couch... being watched...brrr!). It's light on psychology of the afterlife and the disappointments of present-life. It's simply a good, scary thriller. 'Stir of Echoes' is only weak at the end with a pretty ordinary closure.",982800000,,2038,4.645429362880886
72934,4,0784013470,"""Stir Of Echoes"" is a lovely horror/thriller which had the misfortune of being released at the same time as ""Sixth Sense"".

Stir Of Echoes (The Film):
 I am not even gonna go to the Sixth Sense Vs. Stir OF Echoes thing because both of these movies are two very different productions inspite of what you may think. The latter is a modern-day classic no doubt, but the former kept me chilled with its creepy cinematography, excellent direction from Koepp and the great Kevin Bacon. The strength of this film also lies in the fact that it portrays the lives of this blue-collared couple so realistically that you can't help but identify with the characters. The performances are top-notch and there are scenes when one's really is scared out of his/her wits. The film is a great movie to own.

Stir Of Echoes (The DVD):
 I must say that the features in this DVD by Artisan is average at the most. The menus are great and the montage of trailers and TV spots are fazing. I was disappointed by the hasty put-together of the featurette (only 3 mins. long!) and the behind-the-scenes (small with no commentary) look. Heck, there is a fairly noticeable ""layer change"" in the DVD as well (I saw it on my Sony 335 btw) but its not that bad. Another disappointing fact was that MOIST video which should have been replaced by the more prominent song that lingers throughout the trailers and plays a big role in the movie too.

Verdict: Great film. Just-about average DVD. But, still a great buy for the film itself!",979171200,3,1503,4.593283582089552
72935,5,0784013470,"This was a really good scary movie.  I Liked how it was very simple, without an huge buget, and yet they still pulled of a great story.  There really never was a dull moment.  The creepyness just starts right from the get go, and keeps you intrested up untill the end.  If you need a break from all those slasher movies which worry more about the overly elaborate chase secnes, and would perfer a movie thats mysterious, creepy, and keeps you on the edge of your seat biting your fingernails, then Stir of Echoes is the movie for you.",977356800,,534,4.363636363636363

The best ones are always the ones in which the actor has to play someone on the verge of insanity.  That is Kevin Bacon's character in this film, a man who isn't sure about what he sees.  He knows the images he sees are there, but who is in control of them?  Maybe his wife is, or the hypnotist, or even his son!  I won't neglect to mention that the suspenseful parts of the movie (the boo scares) are well placed and unexpected, but also frightful is the eerie atmosphere and cinematography.

It really is quite a good movie, though. Like the sixth sence, if you have any belief in the supernatural, you will walk away with a little more belief.

He can see dead people ~ well, one dead person in particular, who he need to help find whoever killed her.
Such a great suspenseful movie ~ it had me glued the whole time.

72950,2,0784013470,"Sure, Stir of Echoes got the shaft because it was released around the same time as the Sixth Sense. However, the very notion that this film was great and would have been a box office smash if not for that unfortunate coincedence.. Well, that's really quite scary.
Granted, some parts were ok, at times even good, but there were a number of distractions. Kevin Bacon's son wasn't exactly easy on the eyes (I hope I don't have to elaborate this, because I don't want to offend anyone). It was also sort of surreal how he (the son) always commented on the dead people around them as if, ""hey, everything is going to be ok"". It's interesting for one person in a movie to be able to see dead people. Several people.. no. Especially if some small child is completely ok with it, and the father is going batty.
The son didn't even play any sort of purpose in the whole film. He just sort of screwed everything up. Kevin Bacon was definitely shortchanged here, as his performance would have seemed a lot better if not for the kid. Why drag the focus off of how frightening and mysterious it is? I swear I hated the presence of that kid in the movie long before the credits rolled by.
Also, the ending was, well, way too predictable. In a psychological thriller, I want to be surprised. I don't want to be yawning, looking at my watch, or looking for the bathroom because I could care less. See? No comparisons to that ""other movie"", though I'm sure you could make some yourself. This ""film"" is just horrible, thanks to a few mindless screw-ups.",972000000,5,1536,4.469750889679715
72951,4,0784013470,If there was no ''Sixth Sence'' this movie could be a classic but unfortunately Kevin Bacon is not yet famous as Bruce Willis.

72952,4,0784013470,"In the midst of so many movies about psychics/paranormal/hynotism/childred seeing dead people, etc. et. etc. that came out around the same time, it is easy to confuse ""Stir of Echoes"" with another seemingly similar movie, or miss it all together among the heap.  When I first saw it, I remember thinking, ""Is that the one about the little boy who sees dead people?"" (yes, it also is, but I was specifically thinking of ""Sixth Sense"") or the one about the guy who's wife is worried about him because he suddenly freaks out after a weird encounter?""(yes, it is also, but I was specifically thinking of ""The Astronaut's Wife"".)
Although it is easy to confuse this title with other similar horror movies- and I suppose that means a comment can be made about its lack of originality in plot- it was a very  unique movie that deserves to be watched for its own merit.  I was amazed at the little boy's performance.  He acted out so many scary things- seeing dead people, talking to them, calming down his dad when he was afraid- in a very convincing manner.  A lot of parts in the movie did exactly what they were intended to do- scared me to death!
I didn't give this movie five stars because there were some events that happened that didn't seem to reeappear throughout the rest of the movie so I wondered why they were in there at all.  For example, in the beginning the boy's mother says she is pregnant but there is no mention of a coming baby anywhere throughout the rest of the show.  There is also a character of a police man who was very underdeveloped and didn't need to be there, in my opinion.  So for these dropped story lines I get it four stars, but the rest of the movie was definitely great.  You will be entranced by the story line of a haunted house, a boy and father who see dead people and the wife and mother who wonders if they are both losing their minds.  You will also be eerily creeped out by certain unexpected parts in the movie.  Stir of Echoes is definitely the movie to get for that late-night Horror Fest, and is especially appropriate since Halloween is right around the corner!

72953,5,0784013470,I think Stir Of Echos is the best and ever movie of Kevin Bacon. Its story is well writen it takes you inside the movie. Besides Its dvd version is so comforted. All the collectors should own one. Strictly recommended. * 'This movie is better than Sixth Sense',970963200,2,260,4.4375
72954,5,0784013470,"Despite what you might have heard or any preconcieved notions you might have going in, Stir of Echoes is not a cheap and explotative attempt at capitalizing on the success of The Sixth Sense.  In fact in comparing the two, Stir is far and away the better psychological thriller.  Written by Richard Matheson (one of Stephen King's biggest influences) in the 1950's some detail had to be changed and it's all for the better.  The events unfold in Chicago, not L.A., which is a welcome change and gives us a real sense of home.  We identify with Kevin Bacon's Tom, a struggling musician who finds himself in a dead-end job and living a perfectly average life (not what he wants at all).  That is until he finds himself seeing a ghost of a teenage girl whose asking him for help.  While she's very menacing at times there's a consent sense that David Koepp's steering this film in a different direction than you might expect.  It's very sensative and plays on our fears, not so much of haunted houses or evil spirits, but of eachother and more directly - of losing our sanity.  Bacon's performance while not Oscar-worthy is maybe his best since Sleepers and he manages to nail the Chicago accent to a tee.  The DVD is disappointing in that it's a formated version of the film and doesn't capture the grandeur of the theatrical version but the sound is maybe the best of any disc I've seen thusfar.  And Koepp's commentary track is terrific, especially for those aspiring film-makers whom he gives plenty of helpful hints.",970876800,,1518,4.651685393258427

72980,2,0784013470,"The Sixth Sense caused a stir with its twisting plotlines and the occasional trip to visit with the dead. This DVD is a little different in  the approach but the formulaic plotline endures.
Kevin Bacon is a Chicago  husband trying to provide for his family, a son and wife, with an accent  that sounds more Bronx than Chi-town. Okay. But why the guitar and  references to his band? It doesnt help the story and it doesn't develop the  character.
Anyhow, he gets hypnotized at a party and begins to have  visions (yeah...not the Fatima type, but of dead, missing children). And  that sets off an addiction (seriously) for Orange Juice. His son communes  with the dead as well...why not?
Nice neighborhood. Seems like two jocks  killed a retarded girl (why she had to be mentally retarded I'm not sure),  and the parents cover up her accidental death by sealing her in a basement  wall (Poe anyone?). You guessed it...the basement is in Bacons home and he  is obsessed with finding the body.
An attempt to cover it up follows with  some gunshots and a stabbing. Twists? Not really. Predictable. YOU  BET.
Just okay. This is an okay flick. Good second or third choice when  you really want a movie but the good stuff is gone.",966729600,5,1222,4.618604651162791
72981,4,0784013470,"This film has its share of scary moments, and some excellent acting by almost all of the large cast.
The movie is about what happens when Kevin  Bacon's character suddenly becomes ""open"" to the supernatural  elements that surround him. He struggles to make sense of them, and in the  meantime feels as though he is receiving clues to a puzzle.
In addition  to the basic ""thriller"" premise, I like that director David Koepp  takes time to establish relationships between the characters. For example,  Bacon's character's relationship with his wife is clearly portrayed, and as  a viewer, you understand why those characters behave the way they  do.
Koepps's pacing of the unfolding plot is also well-done. He manages  to keep you engaged in the story while still imparting a lot of information  through dialogue, and the breaks between ""scary parts"" give you a  chance to catch your breath, and re-connect with the characters.
The  movie pays homage to a ton of great thrillers -- The Shining, and Close  Encounters, most notably -- and Koepp acknowledges Brian De Palma's help  and influence on this film.
One scene that stands out in the film is the  scene in which Bacon's character (Tom) is first hypnotized. Hypnosis scenes  have been done to death in movies, so it was nice to see such an original  take on it in the film. Instead of showing the cliche of the hypnotist  staring into the camera, dangling a pendulum, Koepp decides to show his  audience exactly what Tom is visualizing as he listens to the hypnotist.  The result is that you see all the odd things that follow from Tom's  perspective.
This has two beneficial functions: First, there is real  entertainment value in watching someone get hypnotized ""from the  inside out."" Second, it helps you sympathize with Tom, who is the  film's protagonist, and an occasionally otherwise unsympathetic  character.
Since this is a DVD review, I'll briefly comment on  DVD-specific aspects of the video release. The video is usually clear, but  sometimes grainy in the darker scenes. The audio mix is fine. Extras  include a scene-specific commentary by director David Koepp. The commentary  is usually interesting and insightful, and only occasionally cloying. He  describes how he shot several scenes, why he made certain story decisions,  and what it was like to work with some of the actors.
So, all in all, if  you like Kevin Bacon, or think you would like to see a scarier version of  the Sixth Sense, you will probably like this movie.",966124800,3,2498,4.899521531100478
72982,5,0784013470,"This is a good movie to watch during the wee hours of the morning, when  nobody is around to pester you and you're in the mood for some thrills and  chills.  Stir of Echoes has plenty of them.  The movie starts off with the  kid taking a bath.  His father, Tom (Kevin Bacon), is talking to him from  the bedroom.  But the boy is clearly talking to somebody else.  The camera  angles around when he is whisked out of the tub.  Nobody is there. Tom takes  his wife and goes across the street to join a party, where his  sister-in-law hypnotizes him.  The special effects in that scene were very  good.  I won't spoil them for you.  After he comes out the trance and goes  home, thinking he can sleep off the weird experience. But then the ghost of  Samantha, who disappeared about a year before, starts haunting him.  The  movie really takes off from there, catapulting Tom and his family into a  surreal and scary nightmare, where he can see ghosts and foretell the  future of his neighbors.  Samantha continues to haunt him until he is  forced to find out what happened to her.  The ending was typical of  Hollywood, but I was still satisfied. Stir of Echoes is based on the novel  that was written by Richard Mattheson during the 1950s.  Koepp had to  change the plot quite a bit to modernize it to the 90s, but he did a good  job.  The story was still virtually the same.  A ordinary man finds himself  in a strange world he doesn't understand, has to solve a mystery he doesn't  want to be a part of, and live to tell about it.",965779200,,1530,4.304964539007092
72983,3,0784013470,"... this movie, like The Sixth Sense, is worth a second viewing. Unlike Sense, however, this film's secrets and ending are easily figured out, so if you are watching for the mystery of it all, it's a strictly middle of the road work. But if you want to see Kevin Bacon's best work to date, this an absolute MUST SEE. His maturity as an actor is evident in his emotional angst over his gift, and his borderline-deranged characterization as the obsession becomes more and more overpowering is reminiscent of the intensity seen in Brolin's Amityville Horror or Nicholson's The Shining characters.
Directorially, this film holds its own against Sense, with clever interplays between this world and the next to keep you off balance, tense music and expert emotion-manipulation.
Definitely worth a look.",965606400,,797,5.045454545454546

72995,4,0784013470,"This was a creepy movie.  It is set in a middle class city neighborhood  that most of us could feel at home in.  That's what makes it creepy.  It  all seems so normal.
Kevin Bacon plays a ""non-believer"" in the  supernatural that is hynotized by his sister-in-law.  What happens when  she hynotizes him startles all at the party they are attending.  His hard  bitten character reacts in terror scaring all that are there.  He brushes  off the incident as so much hocus pocus, but he is unsettled about it.  He  has strange recollections that he believes are not really his own.
What  ensues initially appears to be a trip into madness.  Kevin Bacon a formally  brat pack actor, does a magnificent job, showing his extending range as a  more mature actor.  His character unwittingly is in contact with  individuals that have died.  As in Sixth Sense, they wish their earthly  contact to aid them to identify their killer(s).
In the course of this  contact, Kevin predicts some future events and uncovers a well hidden  neighborhood secret.  Unfortunately, for him, the neighbors catch on to the  fact they are about to be exposed.  He then becomes a liability.
This is  an excellent movie that will satisfy most viewers appetite for suspense.  It is not gory or overly violent as some other movies are, but the few  scenes that are can be disturbing.

Kevin Bacon portrays a normal, hard-working, middle class man who  loves his family.  After a freak encounter he is left with an uncanny  ability to see into the past/future and communicate somewhat with the  after-life.
The cast is great and all of the characters are enveloping  and well played.  The plot of this movie is much more involved than Sixth  Sense and easier to follow along with... you know what you're looking for  here!

73000,1,0784013470,"I was rather looking forward to this film, having read the book and enjoying it very much, as well as having liked David Koepp's previous directorial effort, The Trigger Effect.  Imagine my shock, when by the  halfway point of the movie, I wanted nothing more than for the film to just  be over.
The film starts out well enough.  It makes a few changes here  and there, such as the main character being a much more blue collar type  person and the hypnotist being a woman rather than a man.  No problems  there.  The problems come in when the film goes on and there is almost  nothing to develop the supporting characters of the neighbors.  It gets  even worse when it decides to throw cheap shock gimmicks at the audience  rather than use the subtle scares Matheson imbued his novel with.  (The  best examples of the cheap shocks include the oft-repeated shot of the  breaking fingernail, as well as the laughable vision of the boy shooting  himself and then spreading the blood over his face.)
Probably the lowest  point of the film is when Koepp decides to introduce the character of the  psychic police officer, who does nothing more than give us information that  we've already figured out on our own.  (And if you hadn't figured it out by  that point, then you surely weren't paying attention to all the clues the  director bashed you over the head with.)
By the end, due to the lack of  supporting character development, I had no real concern over which  neighbors did what to whom, nor did I feel the shock I'm sure I was  supposed to have felt.  Instead, I was just glad when the screen darkened  and the credits rolled.
I will forever be mystified as to why this film  received so many good reviews.  I just think of it as further evidence of  how David Koepp's screenplays in which he adapts pre-existing material  almost always turn out bad.  (The Lost World, The Shadow, Mission:  Impossible...

She converses with Neil, the black cop, in the cemetery (where was  Scatman Cruthers?), investigates on her own, saying her husband would  ""never understand"" - yet that was precisely what he had been  trying to do, so her failure to pass Neil's card on rang false.  The  tearing up of the backyard bugged me the same way it did in Close  Encounters when he piles the dirt in the house to recreate Devil's Tower. .  .

This movie  was excellent though,it really emphasises on visual style which is hard to  capitalize on when you're using city landscape scenery rather than  constructed sets like in Sleepy Hollow,but I think the effect was equal if  not better than Sleepy Hollow(excellent cinematography).Next the story was  also very well put together,in the beggining I thought it was going to be a  rip off of Sixth Sense with the kid speaking to the walls ,but it doesn't  take that route at all,it was a totally origional concept of a movie that  is put together in such a way that it totally kept my attention until the  end and has an outstanding performance by Kevin Bacon. The sound track was  yet another strong point in this movie with some of the tracks seeming like  they were pulled right out of Resident Evil and helped a lot to keep the  tension built. For anyone into these sort of movies a definite must buy,but  even if you're not I think everyone should at least rent it and see it  once. Forget Sixth Sense,forget Sleepy Hollow,grab this one instead-a  psycodic master piece that almost had me going a little crazy from the  wonderful array of colors the director slips in through out the movie to  get some what of a hypnosis effect. Very origional,very artistic ,very  good-watch it",960422400,,1659,4.6482758620689655

Kevin Bacon  plays a man with a wife and son, and one night at a party, his  sister-in-law hypnotizes him just for a gimmick. When he wakes up, he  begins having visions of a ghostly young girl who pulls him into solving a  mystery that involves a murder and conspiracy cover-up in his own  neighborhood.

73026,1,0784013470,"I won't disagree with the other folks who already gave the movie a 5-star rating. Yes, the *movie* is great, but... it is the worst *DVD* -- looking only the technical aspect -- I bought until today. Before somebody thinks  to flame me, let me explain my one-star rating:
- this movie doesn't have  any subtitles (English, French, Spanish, whatever);
- this movies doesn't  have any alternative languages;
- the Closed Captions encoded on this DVD  are defective, producing nothing but garbage on the bottom of the screen,  incomplete sentences, randomic lower case letters instead of spaces, and so  on.
Another glitch is that the DVD is actually widescreen, but on the  jacket is written ""fullscreen"" twice. Seems that Artisan doesn't  know the difference.
Not being an US citizen, it is helpful to have  subtitles to follow when the characters are only whispering or speaking  without good pronunciation. Even understanding most of the movies without  the need of subtitles, sometimes certain words are spoken too low or fast  to be understood, and subtitles can be very handy. Unfortunately, as I said  above, this DVD is without any subtitles, and the CC is worthless.
And  yes, my equipment is working very well, this is the only DVD with this  malfunction. Other non-US customers, be warned!",958694400,11,1298,5.0
73027,4,0784013470,"It really takes a lot for me to judge a movie as chilly or scary - but this one is, in fact. Maybe because the special effects used when we enter the mind of Kevin Bacon's character are not exagerrated but  effective.
The story is pretty straight forward, no real surprises, and  this is why the chill really works. The fear and the reactions from both  the new medium (Bacon's character), from his son, from his wife, and from  his surroundings are well-described through very very good acting!  Bravo.
There are two reasons, however, why I do not grant Stir Of  Echoes five stars:
First of all, there are several beginnings (or hints)  which are not followed up! Breaking of one of the most important rules in  Movie Making, not least when it comes to scary movies! Too bad!
Secondly,  it is sickening'n'tiring that we A-L-WAYS have to be bothered with this  standardized American movie endning: some guy taken for dead comes up and  saves the day with a gun, shooting all the bad guys just like that, and in  the very last second. Ew!",958089600,,1037,4.545945945945946
73028,5,0784013470,"`Stir of Echoes' is one of the better supernatural thrillers I have seen in some time.  It is a frightening and gripping story, well presented and well crafted.  Tom Witzky (Kevin Bacon) and his wife Maggie (Kathryn Erbe)  live a normal middle class life with their son Jake (Zachary David Cope) in  a Chicago suburb.  Normal, that is, except for the fact that young Jake is  communing with the dead.  One evening Tom dares his sister-in-law to  hypnotize him to prove it is a bunch of baloney.  The result is that Tom  begins to get visions of a young girl named Samantha; the same girl Jake  has been talking with.  When Tom gets a message to find her, he begins an  all consuming and obsessive quest.  What he finds turns out to be an evil  and sinister revelation that puts him and his whole family in grave  danger.
The story is very effective, presented more as a psychological  horror film rather than the grisly gore so prevalent in the genre.  Numerous comparisons have been made between this film and `The Shining' and  `Close Encounters of the Third Kind', somehow implying that because this  film used some of the effective devices from those films, it is without  value.  I couldn't disagree more.  There is a difference between ripping  off a story and adapting effective devices used in other films.  This film  did the later par extraordinaire.  This story used a novel approach to a  well plowed genre.  It combined the supernatural element with a mystery to  produce a powerful hybrid.  Forget the comparison with `Sixth Sense'.  The  only thing these films had in common was dead people.
Writer/Director  David Koepp did a terrific job in both capacities.  The story was  plausible, frightening and drew the viewer in.  There were some dangling  dead end plot lines (Maggie's pregnancy disappeared as a plot element after  the announcement; and what was Neil about?) that just wasted our time. But  mostly, everything fit together well.  The direction was fabulous.  It was  designed to scare the hell out of you and that it did.  Koepp created  incredible suspense without the use of expensive special effects, simply by  using the camera and sound effectively.  The five speaker surround on the  DVD was particularly good and added impact and eeriness to each  scene.
Kevin Bacon was at the top of his game in this film.  His  obsession with finding Samantha was played with intensity and single  mindedness.  Kathryn Erbe was also good as Maggie, bringing both strength  and passion to the part.
I rated this film a 9/10. This is an excellent  thriller.  Don't miss it.",958003200,,2591,4.789954337899544

The director doesn't  overzealously go for the ""shocking"".  The cast is perfect, there  is not one weak link in there.

73033,4,0784013470,"This movie is every bit as entertaining as the Sixth Sense and it is a shame it didn't get more press when it was playing in theaters.  Kevin Bacon turns in his usual solid performance as a frustrated laborer whose  boring life takes a dramatic turn when he allows his flaky sister-in-law to  hypnotize him, giving him the ability to sense the supernatural.  How  Bacon's character reacts to these powers is frightening and sometimes  amusing.  A good example of the blend of humor and suspense is a scene in  which Bacon takes on an interesting construction/desctruction project in  his basement.  A major part of the plot involves the relationship  between Bacon and his young son who shares the supernatural sense.  Although the relationship is not at the same level of the relationship  between Willis and Osment in the Sixth Sense, it is still interesting, and  the young actor (quite a bit younger than Osment) is very convincing and  quite creepy when the situation calls for it.
For a good, underrated  thriller, don't hesitate to check out Stir of Echoes.",957312000,4,1064,4.860335195530726

This movie has one of the eeriest plots I can  recall. It becomes difficult to discern what are Bacon's visions and what  are the reality scenes.
Kevin Bacon plays a middle class father, whose  life is changed after he volunteers to be hypnotized. As the movie  progresses, so does his madness.
A true spine-tingler, I recommend this  movie to everyone who likes to be scared on a higher level. This is not  ""Halloween"" or ""Friday the 13th,"" it is much more  intellectual.",957052800,,686,4.475806451612903

The only thing that really brings this movie down is the  comparrison with the Sixth Sense.  The interactive menu is a major selling  point of this movie.  Really well done.

That is a terrible shame, because this movie is as  good as any around.  Comparing Echoes to Sense is like comparing DaVinci to  Michealangelo.  Both are great in their own distinct ways.
The story of  an ordinary working class guy (Kevin Bacon) living in his version of a  safe, ideal neighborhood whose world is throw out of whack when he is  hypnotized by his ditzy sister-in-law (the always good Illeana Douglas).  When he starts to experience strange things, it turns his and his family's  world upside down.  It would be a shame to say more and possibly spoil the  suspenseful plot, but the twists and turns this tale takes are wonderful.
This movie will keep you on the edge of your seat and give you a good  half-dozen or so jump out of your skin scares.  Well acted (Bacon and  Douglas are the ""big"" names, but Kathryn Erbe, Kevin Dunn, AJ Oto  lead a great supporting cast, and Zachary David Cope does an amazing job as  Bacon's son) and written, this movie should have been a much bigger hit.  The second life it has received on video/DVD is well-deserved.

However, if you're honest, you'll have  to admit that Stir Of Echos is incredibly suspenseful (definitely Edge Of  The Seat stuff!) totally riveting, and far, far CREEPIER than the Sixth  Sense!  In this movie, (starring Kevin Bacon) the lead character is  hypontized on a drunken whim, at a party.

I thoroughly enjoyed the plot, which is based on a Richard  Matheson novel, and Kevin Bacon's performance is superb. Yet, when the end  of the story nears, one might consider that there are too many people  involved in the final climactic ending, and I use the term loosely.  Kevin Bacon plays an inner-city construction worker, who is married and has  a small boy. He and his family live in a small residential neighborhood  filled wit lots of people who care for their image of a well-rounded  community. However, at a party, Bacon is hypnotized by his wife's friend,  and he beins to have visions of a girl, and it seems that she's being  attacked. This begins his spiralling downfall, as he begins to tear apart  his life and his home for the clues to the final answer, forsaking his job,  his social life and his family.  The storyline of the movie is  terrific, with an evident element of suspense that is sure to please fans  of The Sixth Sense. Yet, when the ending comes, it seems as though the  filmmakers traded originality for a typical Hollywood ending scenario.  True, that may be what was in the book, but I personally think that they  could've done just a little better.  Like the everlasting At First  Sight, this is a movie that you should rent first before diving into the  purchase pot.",955324800,,1466,4.522900763358779
73064,3,0784013470,"A couple attempt to cope with the husband's hynopotically-enduced clairvoyance which, as a premise, could prove interesting enough.  Problem is, Bacon's character's a little dense, so it takes him a good stretch of  time to figure out what his new sight's all about (just enough time to blow  a big budget on some decent digital effects).  Meanwhile he and his wife  possess absolutely no communication skills and she goes mosquitoing around  her husband's head while he grunts in displeasure and shoos her away so  that he may fulfil the duty demanded by The Ghost of the Chilling  Cameo!
Oh yeah, and their son sees the ghost too; talks to it.  (A  tendency which mom feels can be remedied by turning off those darn horror  movies.)
I'll let you guess whether or not the average dysfunctional  suburban couple and their soon-to-be-in-therapy son live to the credits,  which begin with an inappropriate bit of top 40 tacked on so that the film  would contain just enough of it's type to sell a sountrack.
But hey, it  wasn't terrible waste of 90 minutes, just very average and  forgettable.

Yes, they both have a small child who sees ghosts (whether it is ""I  see dead people..."" or ""I'm afraid of the feathers..."") but  they are still very different. For one thing, Kevin Bacon is more like Jack  Nicholson was in ""The Shining"" and Bruce Willis... well, wasn't.  Bruce Willis had a whole Fox Mulder ""I will find the truth""  attitude...

One  scene involves a heated discussion which could have potentially been the  most intense part of the story, but the dialogue was so unbelievable and  ""scripted"" it fell flat.
In addition, I found that the Chicago  scene was portrayed poorly.  It makes me feel that everyone in Chicago goes  to ""block parties"" each weekend.  I doubt that is the  case.

Any viewers particularly fond  of ""small"" or ""major"" twists or surprises will surely  get a chill from the little boy's(who play's Bacon's son) statement and  revelation of, ""...I'm afraid of the feathers"".  Watching Bacon's  character transform from a cynical disbeliever of the powers of hypnotism  and the spiritual world to a man going literally mad until he finds the  answers to what he is seeing is amazing ! The events that lead to the  ending are all packaged in a nerve racking roller coaster ride. There is a  great sense of closure and fulfillment with the story as well; no loose  ends or confusing open ended questions. This film is cleverly written and  the effects (though not overpowering or overabundant) are uniquely  mesmerizing !  Stir of Echoes should have stirred more box office earnings.

The ghost being shot at six frames per second was  an excellent touch to give you something creepy that wasn't cheesey  looking.

I think Stir of Echoes was so creepy because it is one of those  movies where it can actually happen, unlike movies like Friday the 13th,  Halloween, etc. I totally loved this movie, and even seeing Sixth Sense  first, I was not the least bit disappointed by this one.

Starring Kevin Bacon in his most complex and intense performance, he plays an every day  average joe whose dormant psychic powers accidently get awakened when he is  hypmotizied by his sister-in-law at a party. Suddenly plagued with  supernatural visions and ghostly nightmares, Bacon slowly finds himself  falling into some sort of mystery that has something to due with the house  he lives in and his aggressively incresing paranormal powers. What begins  as an omnious character piece of unsatisifed lives, develops into an  emotionally draining voyage into the spirtually unknown. Compared to the  Sixth Sense, Stir of Echoes is more of film noir mystery enhanced by  sophisticated direction and an oscar calibar performance by Kevin Bacon.

73125,4,0784013470,"Not having seen THE SIXTH SENSE, this review will not be a comparison of the two movies.
This movie is a good old-fashioned ghost story.  As a ""receiver"" capable of touching the supernatural plane, Kevin  Bacon's portrayal of a man on the edge of madness is quite effective.  Likewise, the character of his son in the film adds an engaging element of  eerieness.
For the first hour, this film had me tightly in its grip.  As  Bacon gets little glimpses of a deeper mystery, you are taken along on his  increasingly-deperate quest to touch the ghostly plane and get a full  revelation of just why his life has been turned upside down.
However, I  believe the resolution insults the intelligence and suspense of what had  gone before.  A typical Hollywood thriller ending, while by no means a  drastic letdown, derails you from the track of enjoyable unpredictability  that brought you to that point.
Overall, this movie is highly  entertaining.  While I wished for more of an atypical resolution, I can't  say that my money was not well-spent on this release.",952041600,11,1058,4.794444444444444

The film is very well written and does have a strong cast. However, this  film could have been expanded in certain areas, none so much as the group  of people who share Bacon's gift as paranormal receivers (the ability to  see aspects from the dead).

73129,4,0784013470,"Based on a book of the same name, Stir of Echoes is one of those rare ghost stories that actually works.  Forget about overblown fluff like Amityville Horror and Poltergeist.  In my opinion, this is one of the best  Supernatural horror flicks in a long, long time.  Kevin Bacon plays a man  who is hypnotized by his flaky wanna-be gypsy sister in law who, not liking  his singlemindedness regarding his wife not working, commands him to have a  more open mind.  Once he awakens from his hypnosis, his mind's open,  allright...He starts receiving messages from a murdered young girl who  won't leave him alone until he solves her murder.  This is a truly creepy  movie, and scary, as well.  And Bacon's just plain great in the lead roll.  I'm not too keen on children in supernatural type movies (i.e. Sixth Sense,  the Shining) because they tend to all be the same...wide opened eye  toddlers with a knack for being cryptic.  However, the boy in this movie's  really good, and his visions play a pivotal roll in the film's outcome.  This one's highly recommended by yours truly.

All in all a fairly good ghost story. There are a couple of  things I's like to have seen developed more (like the meeting of the  receivers) but sometimes less is more.  The DVD 5.1 digital sound was very  good on my system & helped to build tension. The transfer seemed fine  as well.",951177600,2,611,4.162393162393163

Whether it be a lonely boy just wanting to dance in a town where it is forbidden, or a a guy who wants to get it on with Neve and the Noxema girl, he always seems  sly, sinister, and scary. Footloose, very scary. This film, slightly so.  Stir of Echoes was released on the coattails of another little ghost story,  the now oscar nominated The Sixth Sense. It was sort of pushed away by  many, dismissed as a clone and so forth. That is too bad for the film,  which is not so bad. I rented the DVD expecting a good Kevin B. chuckle,  the type I generally expect to pop-off while I watch the earnest Mr. Bacon  wrestle in the throes of whatever dilema the production he is in throws his  way. This time, though, I found myself actually liking his character, his  acting, and the film itself. It wasn't perfect (I figured out the ending  about 20 minutes into the film), but as far as thrillers goes these days, I  would take this Chicago based tale in a New York minute over the likings of  Fallen, Bone Collector, yada yada yada...",951177600,,1091,4.346534653465347

73133,5,0784013470,"The new Hollywood player ""Artisan Entertainment"" offers up its second outing in the wake of the ""Blair Witch Project"".
The ""Stir of Echoes"" is based on a long out of print novel which has  been adapted by screenwriter/director David Koepp. Koepp is responsible for  writing such huge hits as both ""Jurassic Parks"", ""Mission:  Impossible"" and ""Men In Black."" His last directing effort  was 1996's ""Trigger Effect"" which told of paranoia erupting  during a mass blackout in LA. In ""Stir of Echoes"" we encounter  more paranoia and its effects on a Chicago-based family. The cause of the  paranoia comes when the head of the family (Kevin Bacon) is hypnotized by  an unlicensed hypno-therapist (Illeana Douglas). The hypnosis opens an  unlocked chamber of Bacon's mind and unleashes a long kept secret come to  life.
""Stir of Echoes"" is a very light and subtle ghost story  thriller. How can a film like this overcome the flooded horror genre  market? Well the standout performance by Kevin Bacon is probably a good  start as he gives one of his best in recent years. His protective nature  towards his boy, his obsession with trying to solve his polluted mind and  his reactions with the supernatural phenomenon bring out every reaction in  Bacon. The portrayal reminded me a lot of Craig T Nelson in the classic  ""Poltergeist"" as an every day man trying to battle the unknown.  Other evidences of ""Poltergeist"" were in the ""little  boy"" who knows more than his parents and seems to be in tune with the  corporeal world. One aspect of Echoes which is never fully explored is the  ""open-minded"" underground where the wife learns that only 8% of  the population have the ability to see the corporeal world. Begging for  help this intriguing subplot could have been the key this supernatural  thriller needed. Except the story takes the obvious road and we end at the  conclusion. Was this fully explored in the novel? We may never know. So if  you are a Kevin Bacon fan see ""Stir of Echoes"" and if you want to  see a good ghost story then see this film.",951091200,8,2048,4.760683760683761

73145,4,0784013470,"Too bad this film didn't last very long at the theatre...probably poor timing by the people who elected to release this around the same time as Sixth Sense.
Overall, this was a very good film. Very suspenseful and  excellent acting by Kevin Bacon. Loaded with imagery and leaves you  wondering about a lot of things...sort of reminiscent of the Twilight Zone.  These are the types of ""horror"" films that don't require blood,  gore, and Freddy Krueger types to scare you.  The more realistic a film is,  the more it frightens me...and this film disturbed me enough to keep me  awake for many hours afterward.
I would have rated it 5  stars....except...the film is adapted from a book written by Richard  Matheson (who was a writer and director for the Twilight Zone, and directed  some of Serling's most memorable episodes) There are many parts of the film  which were changed from the book, possibly to make the film a bit more  ""90's"". (the book was written in the 50's) Some of it wouldn't  bother you unless you've read it, but the film doesn't explore the  characters in an much depth as the book. They also change the circumstances  of the victim's death, (and who the victim is, for that matter)and other  small details (the hypnotist in the book is the wife's brother, not sister)  There are also some characters in the book which would have been great in  the movie and would have complimented Bacon's character, but they are not  addressed at all.

Bacon, while  at a party, gets hypnotized and the hypnotist throws a suggestion in his  mind for Bacon to be more ""open minded""...this leads to his new  ""look"" on life or death depending on your perspective. The  filming is gritty, has some intense scenes, and a bit of the ""oh  wow"" that comes from the audience makes for a great viewing  experience.

Dad (Bacon), after being  hynotized at a party, starts having strange and horrible visions; he also  starts seeing the ghost of the same dead girl in his living room; a ghost  that wants something.  'Stir of Echoes' deserves to stand on it's own and  not be compared to 'The Sixth Sense.' I personally think 'Stir' is better.

The sixth sense is a very good movie, but this  is much better and suspenseful the whole way through. I and My wife were on  the edge of our seats the whole way through the movie. The only thing the  sixth sense has over this movie is the suprise ending. This movie is the  better of the two in My humble opinion and does not need the incrediable  ending of sixth sense.

The psychological elements should  have been better highlighted.  Kevin Bacon's character needed to understand  that the new knowledge he has been recently made aware is not really new  information.  He comes to no real thought in the progress of the film.  The other big problem with the screenplay is the use of the dais ex  machina.
