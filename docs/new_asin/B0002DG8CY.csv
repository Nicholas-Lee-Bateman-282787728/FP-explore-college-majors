8026703,1,B0002DG8CY,"The Japanese tried to imitate Chinese martial art films in the 70's -- and they failed.  The acting is more like caricatures of the Japanese culture.  I lived there and NEVER saw any one acting like they do in their martial art films.  Even the fighting is boring.
I think the Chinese have the market on good martial art movies.  I do have great respect for Japan those and its people.  Well, except for their harsh treatment of sea life in general.",1414454400,,449,4.426829268292683
8026704,4,B0002DG8CY,"Eighteen year old Koryu Lee (Etsuko ""Sue"" Shihomi)top female fighter of the Kenmpo shorinji school in Tokyo. She is Mainly based in Hong Kong as a missionary and is her fathers home (half Chinese/half Japanese) in the movie she seeks to find her missing brother kidnapped by a Japanese drug smuggling and experimental ring controlled by a organization of top martial art experts. Reassuring her Uncle and other family members in a attempt to furthering her search and linking up with a possible leads (Note) in the all of the SS movies She takes a job undercover selling flowers in Yokohama's strip clubs. With the overwhelming urge to find her brother her determination becomes stronger throughout the movie and seems almost unstoppable no matter whom the mob boss hires to take her down.

Although Sonny Chiba is in this movie he is shadowed a bit I guess the director wanted the audience to focus more on Sue than Chiba. And he did just that as most male viewers would agree Miss, Shihomi is a delight to watch in action, nice little body, a cute face and smile, yet so deadly. Action in the movie is good but not as great as the Chiba ones. The charters used are recognisable from other chiba movies if they die they usually come back in the next one(lol) Still well picked Japanese actors at the time. I would highly recommend the four disk SS collection from BCI it is remastered and very well put togther.",1364342400,,1412,4.625498007968128
8026705,4,B0002DG8CY,This movie is so silly and fun it would make a cool noirish video game. The good part? Females play a prominate role overall in this movie and for the females the roles are not particularly sexually exploitive. Here women kickass on all sides.,1312761600,,243,4.545454545454546
8026706,3,B0002DG8CY,"Sue Shiomi tries her best and does a half-decent job, but the screen only really sparks into life when Mr. Streetfighter himself swaggers on and starts some serious buttkicking. Unfortunately, this is all too seldom. To make up for that there are a selection of weapons fights on offer, Sai, Tonfa, Nunchaku, but most of these are wasted - whether my copy was cut, I don't know - with only the nunchaku getting a decent showing.

As one of the other reviews mentioned there does seem to be more than just a polite nod to Enter the Dragon in parts of this movie. Not that that's a bad thing, but don't come to this expecting anything like Bruce Lee's masterpiece.

It's a pleasant way to spend 90 minutes, but really it's nothing that special.",1177804800,,742,4.529850746268656
8026707,4,B0002DG8CY,"Connoisseurs of old-school karate flicks will be hard pressed to find a female action star who is as much fun to watch as Etsuko ""Sue"" Shiomi. Of course there are others with better abilities in both martial arts and acting, such as the great Michelle Yeoh, but Shiomi certainly combined seriously chopsocky buttkickin' action skills with heart and adorability. Shiomi was just 19 years old or so when this movie was filmed back in the mid-70s, and not only is she a real cutie, but she can also kill you with her bare hands. This movie has a pretty typical karate flick plot, as main character Tina (Shiomi) infiltrates a gang of drug runners who have imprisoned her brother, and leaves big piles of bleeding goons in her wake. Shiomi isn't a very good actress to be sure &#8211; her dialogue mostly consists of yelling and you could count all of her facial expressions on one hand, though she at least looks like she feels bad after kicking a guy down the stairs or embedding a spike in another guy's skull.

This movie is also worth tracking down for anyone who loves old karate flicks that are just so bad they're good. We get a heaping helping of fight scenes showcasing a variety of martial arts styles and weapons. And it just keeps getting more fun &#8211; with bizarrities like an elite force of fighters who wear baskets on their heads and get beaten by a ballerina, and a troop of Thai kickboxing teenage chicks who for some reason are dressed up like Pebbles Flintstone. (YabbaDabbaDoo!) Not to mention the high-priced gangsters who keep getting whomped by a single young cutie pie. Why doesn't the big boss just fire all these idiots already? And on a historical note, there is evidence that Quentin Tarrantino is hip to this film, and some fans of the genre are speculating that Sue Shiomi was the direct inspiration for Uma Thurman's character in ""Kill Bill."" You will really like Sue Shiomi as an action star after catching this flick, so track this lost gem down if you can. [~doomsdayer520~]",1138492800,,2009,4.659154929577465
8026708,4,B0002DG8CY,"I think the idea of this movie is to mimic Enter The Dragon while

showcasing the star Etsuko Shiomi, in that respect it was a

success, It helped that Etsuko Shiomi is a real karate fighter

in real life, few will remember that she once issued a challenge

to a chinese actress who also portrayed tough girl roles, It was

suppose to be full contact, needless to say the chinese girl

declined, such was the reputation of Shiomi in her heydays,

I wonder where she is now. If you like Kill Bill or Azumi, you

won't be disappointed in this movie specially as the star here

has real fighting talent. I could have rated this 5 stars but

the transfer to DVD could have been better.",1103760000,,681,4.333333333333333
