The picture is good as is the sound and the movie is interesting but far from real, but that's nothing new in movies. This is a good movie for an old B/W and I like old B/W movies.",1418342400,,332,3.5616438356164384
8313095,3,B001JL96K4,"The experimental hospital ""Mercy Plane"" has to take a back seat to the lovely 19-year-old Frances Gifford in this 1939 action-filled Poverty Row opus. Ms. Gifford would go on to become a legendary cult figure when she starred as Nyoka in Republic's 1941 serial ""Jungle Girl.""

Gifford plays a daredevil airplane pilot not unlike Amelia Earhart. Earhart receives a passing mention in some of the dialogue about ""not coming back"" in her attempt to be the first woman to fly solo around the world.

Gifford wants to try her hand at being the first woman to fly solo around the world. But in the man's world of 1939, she is pounded from every side by a lot of male egos who can't understand how a woman can win so many air races without cheating or creating some other unfair advantage.

The biggest complainer of the bunch is her pilot boyfriend James Dunn who has lost a lot of air races to her. He hurls insults in her direction through most of the movie. Most women would have told him where to stick his plane and walked out, but not in this film.

As it turns out, Dunn and Gifford were a real life married couple when this film was made. He was twenty years older than her and looked it. If he was as disrespectful to her off camera as on, it's no wonder their marriage only lasted four years.

Anyway, this film is worth watching, especially for Frances Gifford fans because she receives a lot of screen time. Also, the film transfer and sound are not bad.",1314662400,2,1460,4.432835820895522
