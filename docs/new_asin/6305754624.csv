7893708,4,6305754624,"I have the ""complete series"" (minus the final 7 episodes, so, maybe not so ""complete"") on a 4 disc set.  I used to own all the available Good Neighbors videos, but the tapes are missing several episodes which, fortunately,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Good-Neighbors-The-Complete-Series-1-3/dp/B000784WKO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Good Neighbors - The Complete Series 1-3</a>&nbsp;can be found on the DVD set. (I don't know why the last 7 episodes aren't included, so I do own those on tape)  Anyway, I was happy to find episodes such as ""That Thing in the Cellar"" and ""The Guru of Surbiton"" on the DVD set.  If you're a true Good Neighbors fan, the DVD set is worth owning!",1184630400,,715,5.663551401869159
7893709,5,6305754624,"A charming, quirky comedy - still fresh - built on the absurdities of male/female relationships and British class distinctions.  Beautifully written, played out with lovely timing, this is a sweet vacation into a slightly off-register world.  This comedy spares us from the vulgar excesses of much British humor, and makes an affectionate study of its characters and our own natures. Intelligently funny.  A delight from beginning to end.  It's got me thinking about raising some carrots, myself.",1180483200,,496,5.402597402597403
7893710,4,6305754624,"The ""Royal Command"" was a lot of hype. The show itself was as usual  Very Goog.",1168300800,,79,3.9375
7893711,4,6305754624,"It was so exciting to finally see this final episode of Good Neighbors after being a fan for so many years. We started watching the series in 1982 when it aired on PBS locally and it soon became our favorite sitcom of all time. This episode is not up to the standards of the regular series, but if you are a fan, that's not going to stop you from wanting to see it anyway.
Tom and Barbara are worried about getting old and having no savings for when they can't manage the back-breaking work of self-sufficiency. Jerry is trying to get in shape for a physical exam he has to pass to qualify for life insurance and Margo is helping him. Tom goes to see the banker (George Cole of Henry Root fame) to propose a scheme whereby the Goods would sell the bank their house but would continue to live in it until they die. The Goods would live on the mortgage payments the bank pays them. The banker thinks this is a preposterous idea (and yet it sounds just like a reverse mortgage, doesn't it?). Meanwhile, Jerry is having trouble staying focused on getting in shape, and Tom mocks him as he's jogging in the neighborhood. Jerry and Tom challenge each other to a race. Barbara and Margo cheer them on, and then wait while the boys end up taking rather a long time. Finally they return, in a tie. But it seems they cheated by taking a taxi when they both ran out of steam, and spent the time in a pub. Nothing is resolved, but everyone, including the Queen, has a grand time.
The quality of the sound on the VHS is not excellent, but maybe we have a dodgy print. The show isn't one of the classics, but it's fun to see the sets and the crew, and watch the Queen and Duke do their thing. A must for fans!",1072051200,8,1695,4.218461538461538
7893712,4,6305754624,"The Good Neighbors Royal Command Performance was very exciting especially to see the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh greeting the cast and staff on the Good Life soundstage in 1977.  The episode ""When Iam 65"" did not have original sparkle of before scripts.  The cast was brillant but the writing went flat.  It seems there were long pauses between lines.  It seems it ran out of steam and to call it quits.  Seeing the BBC studio was a surprising treat and to actually see the writers and directors of the show...Richard Briers does an intro and is brillant.  Penelope Keith, Felicity Kendal and Paul Eddington were were bang on....",1021334400,9,633,4.709090909090909
7893713,5,6305754624,"When I first saw the Good Life (the British name) in the 1970s as an impressionable kid, I immediately loved it. Everybody was so nice and civilized unlike the glue-sniffing, head-butting ruffians at my local Scottish comprehensive school. I was so charmed that I almost wanted to become English, middle-class, and 'awfully nice.' I also developed a raging crush on Felicity Kendall.
This series was a product of the golden age of British TV when the BBC was more like a giant artists' collective than the faceless management bureau it has since become. The casting is incredible. The four main actors are hand-in-glove with their roles. Paul Eddington as the long-suffering but slyly rebellious Jerry is the perfect foil for Margot's innocent pomposity. Felicity Kendall's Barbara is both tomboyish and kittenish and serves as a welcome check on Richard Brier's naughty little boy act as the exuberant and mischievous Tom.
For those unfamiliar with the situation of this situation comedy, it concerns the efforts of Tom and Barbara Good to escape the 9-to-5, Monday-to-Friday, suburbs-to-city commuting rat race, by starting a commune in their own garden, and the effect this has on their relationship with their very strait-laced neighbors, Jerry and Margot.
This tape includes two consecutive episodes from the 2nd series and one from the 3rd series with the following original transmission dates.
(1) Mr Fix It - 19th of December, 1975 Tom and Barbaras revolutionary lifestyle attracts the interest of a freelance journalist, throwing their neighbours' bourgeois values into sharp relief. Margot tries hard to get her name in the paper, while Jerry uses the publicity to gain sponsorship perks from local businesses.
(2) The Day Peace Broke Out - 2nd of January, 1976 After noticing that some of his leeks are missing, Tom sets out to catch the thief. His vigilantism, however, lands him in trouble with the law. Revenge finally comes in the unexpected shape of Geraldine the Goat.
(3) I Talk to the Trees - 1st of October, 1976 After meeting an old man who talks to his plants, the Goods decide to experiment with talking to their plants. Margot meanwhile is plotting to take over the Suburbiton Music Society. When Tom taunts her with plotting a revolution, she shows her right wing credentials by responding, ""I'd rather you thought of it as a right-wing coup."" This only a couple of years after General Pinochet's infamous right wing coup in Chile!",983318400,2,2456,5.051724137931035
7893714,5,6305754624,"I saw this series when it came to US TV some years ago (thank you, forever, PBS).  I loved it then.  I love it now.  I've got the whole collection, finally.  And thank god, because these seem to go in and out of stock quite rapidly.
Stars:  Tom & Barbara Good, played by Richard Briers and Felicity Kendal - whom I worship, and Margo & Jerry Leadbetter, played by Penelope Keith and Paul Eddington.
I also saw Felicity Kendal in a PBS replay of the BBC Shakespeare series with her starring as Viola in ""Twelfth Night"" and was so impressed that I named a daughter after her.
Felicity (and the other cast members) are believable, funny, and always in trouble, love, etc., with each other.
The setting...  Tom & Barbara move to a ritzy neighborhood and start a farm... well, more like they decide to ""live off the land.""  Try that in a swank neighborhood and I'm sure you'll end up with some of the problems they had.
Totally hysterical.  Very funny.  A must see.  Own it if you can.  Definitely for the whole family.",970099200,,1014,4.427027027027027
