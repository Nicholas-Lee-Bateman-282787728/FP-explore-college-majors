4893137,5,B005TZFZK6,"This excellent documentary starts where ""Who Killed the Electric Car?"" left off.  Only this time we get to go behind the closed doors of Nissan, GM, and the Silicon Valley start-up Tesla Motors. We seem to concentrate more on the people behind the project than the project its self.

Many times we are left with the question will the company survive or not.  We watch technology the sings and swims. We watch as financing gets scarce. Nerves fray and wonder about sincerity.

There is lots of great footage of cars and their making.  One scene where robots were making leafs I turned to my wife and suggested that it looked like a scene from ""Atlas Shrugged Part 1"". She said it reminded her of ""The Terminator"". Could be because Arnold was in the documentary.

I was disappointed to find there was no Ed Begley Jr. in the presentation as he is a great advocate of electric cars.

In the end it was sort of a commercial for the targeted companies.  Ford Fusion gets a two second flash.  I will watch this over again as it moves fast enough to miss some of the subtleties.

And for people that gage their DVD by the amount of extras, you will not be disanointed with the variety and usefulness of the extras.

By the way do you think the neighbor would notice the bright orange cable plugged into their outdoor lamp? On a serious side we now have several charging stations at the local university, and used book store. Could user more but it is a start.

4893138,4,B005TZFZK6,"In continuation with ""Who Killed The Electric Car?"" ... this flick is about the only true direction we can go before we destroy the planet earth in our own filth & petro fumes. No foreign oil, no foreign wars. As with the current trend towards alternative energy sources (windmills, more solar power both on an individual and corporate basis) the only way to save the so called American car industry is to reign forth ut of control greed and avericity and focus on science. Nikola Tesla was delving into non-traditional power sources as far back as 100+ years ago and hopeful Silicon Valley's new start up Tesla Motors and others do their part in cleaning up the automobile industry.

Overall an excellent foray into where the ""Who Killed The Electric Car?"" ended.",1327276800,,764,4.787878787878788
4893139,5,B005TZFZK6,"I was privileged to see this film when Chris Paine displayed it at the EVTV's EVCCON conference in September 2011. While Bob Lutz is still a major character in the film it also focus's on Elon Musk and the sacrifices he mas made both personally and finically to make electric cars become a mainstream reality. It also features a grassroots EV maker in L.A. and shares his experiences. Honestly this film is what I envisioned the first one being before I saw it. This film also played a part in me purchasing a car and starting a conversion to electric as soon as I returned from the conference.

All the best,

4893140,5,B005TZFZK6,"`Revenge Of The Electric Car' is the perfect sequel to 'Who Killed The Electric Car' film documentary. We've seen petroleum and natural gas interests tout about the supplies still in the ground - an average of one hundred years is often trumpeted in their ads - all they do is make me laugh! One hundred years, yep, that's a lot of time - not! What the petro companies don't tell you is as the supply dwindles, the price will keep going up - and it can't be replenished! There is also the moral question of whether it is right to leave our future generations in crisis mode - both in environmental and in leaving our children and grandchildren without because of our selfishness? I think NOT! We need to mainstream the electric car, we need to encourage the development of alternative and sustaining power for industry and the home - interesting fact - the technology is already here - we only need to make it an everyday reality! By ending our dependence on all oil, especially foreign oil and gas, we stop siphoning our economy and jobs overseas, we no  longer have our sons and daughters die or become disabled to protect oil company interests - and we make sure we have a supply of petroleum for future generations to be used in more noble pursuits like medicine. The biggest problem currently with electric cars is cruising range. Let me offer a potential solution - car bodies that double as solar panels (its currently being tried already at one electric car company at a limited level) and the use of passive wind turbines that can generate electricity even when a car is parked - that's an original Andrew Boggs and mall 727 concept! Simply, when one is traveling even at twenty-five miles per hour, there is wind resistance that can be turned into energy to charge a car's batteries, thus increasing range - and at 55 mph, that can produce a lot of energy. Another problem mentioned is increasing demand on the power grid to recharge a car's batteries - that has already been solved with home solar cells and wind turbines which can not only power homes, but recharge our cars as well. This will power North American jobs, this will save our economy! Think about it!  Yes, I really do want to see 'Revenge Of The Electric Car' now and for my children to see in the future as well.",1321920000,10,2290,4.555825242718447

After watching that, I watched Revenge of the Electric Car, which left me feeling much better about the progress that has been made and about new models that are now close to making electric vehicles good enough to replace ICE cars for many people.

Although old and slightly out dated, this is still an enjoyable film to watch for anyone that is interested in EVs.",1459123200,3,677,6.052083333333333

The filmaker could have easily gone all ""Micheal Moore"" on the subject and banged a drum against the man... but he did something even more powerful. He told the stories of four men actually making electric cars... and showed how hard it is to make a car... any car. All the stories are engaging and the future looks very bright!

The ""revenge"" movie was good, but more about marketing and the up and coming electric car businesses than about the electric car's many points of superiority over the internal combustion car.  A worthwhile purchase if you are interested in how these great new vehicles are being sold.  The Tesla guy, Musk saying that if GM hadn't (stupidly) given up it's pre-eminence in EVs by crushing their electric car, the EV-1 back in the 1990's, Tesla could never have started up as a business!",1421971200,,617,4.685185185185185

Another avenue for electric transport that is highly developed in Europe and Japan but sparse in the U.S. is the electric train.  The last time I checked an electric subway or train, when full with passengers, provides transportation at the equivalent to about 120 miles to the gallon of gasoline, based on energy use.",1417996800,,554,4.739583333333333

4893177,4,B005TZFZK6,"In this movie I really enjoyed the fact that it made non-believers of the electric car in to believers. The vice president of general motors wasn't a believer at first but that fact that he wants to create a more economy friendly car was shocking. I also liked how the electric car was brought back to life. So many car companies fought to bring it back some even went bankrupt. Telsa was a new company that that paved the way for the volt to be created by general motors. I like the fact that the volt has a backup gas tank in it just in case the car ran out of charge. When general motors ran out of money and had to file bankruptcy the government gave them 30 million dollars to help them out and to get back on the right track. I really enjoyed how Elon from Telsa fought to make an even better electric car the sedan and got loans from places like the department of energy. That within its self-shows me that he is passionate about what he does and its not just about him make a profit, but make something affordable for all consumers. I really enjoyed this movie and I cant wait to see how electric cars change our future.",1407024000,,1128,4.226851851851852
4893178,5,B005TZFZK6,"The film did a very great job on showing how difficult it was to bring the electric vehicle to the mainstream public.  It also solidified the idea that the American Dream is still possible; this was apparent by Tesla Motors. The impact of the recession was also very apparent; to both the consumer and to companies.  This could have been the end for the electric car like at the turn of the century and again in the 1990s. This documentary, in my opinion, is a testament that the best things in life are worth fighting for.

4893187,5,B005TZFZK6,"If you've already seen the first film ""Who Killed the Electric Car"" I recommend that you watch the Plug In America's sponsored ""What is the Electric Car?"" before watching this. It tells more of the story of the EV1, and the insurance requirements that lead to the cars being destroyed as well as additional interviews from many of the same people in the first film, I think of it as 'Who Killed the Electric Car 1.5'. If you haven't seen the first film, your enjoyment of this movie shouldn't be effected, they are thematically quite different.

This film opens with a overhead view a multilevel, multilane highway, and Dan Neil a reporter, that was mostly against EVs in the first film, and now has come to the conclusion that he will ""never buy another gasoline powered car"", and that ""the only way forward is electric cars."" It next recaps General Motors (GM) EV1 and the fall out from those events. Danny Devito recounts his owning the car. Two news editors Ray Wert and Owen Thomas are also key commentators on the events within the film from time to time. Bob Lutz is then introduced as one of the films main stars, a GM Media spokes person and vice chairman. They then give a brief overview of his career in a magazine style animated sequence. After seeing Toyotas success with hybrids he suggests a similar electric car project be started, but gets nowhere with the idea at GM. The story then shifts to Tesla Motors releasing it's first Roadster. Elon musk is then introduced. It then lists some of his other accomplishments such as SpaceX and PayPal. Bob's Story then picks up after hearing about the success of Tesla Motors, he is then given his chance to head the production project of a part EV/part Gasoline powered car known as the Chevrolet Volt. It is revealed at GM's 100th birthday celebration. While the car companies are ramping up their plans the story switches to the people who have been making cars electric for years through conversion. Greg 'Gadget' Abbott and his wife Charlotte Jackson are then introduced. They tell how gas cars can be converted to electric. He also did this for the bonus footage of the first movie. It then tells about his latest projects. He and GM, & Tesla also show off their cars at the Plug-In America parade. As the race to build the best and quickest selling EV in the USA begins, half way around the world Nissan/Renault's CEO Carlos Ghosn is introduced. As Nissan is beginning their ramp up to production of the all-electric Nissan LEAF. He discusses his plans for Nissan, as preparation are begun to mass produce the car, and try and beat the other car companies to the market.

As each of the films principal players are building up their plans, a recession hits the world. Shortly afterward there is arson at Gadgets workshop. He looses much of the equipment and tools he has but finds some things still working including a controller. ""With that,"" he says ""I can build a car."" GM and other car companies begin loosing money on their non-EV related projects and ask the US government for help. And they get snapped at by the media and the government for their wastefulness, and that they had not built the vehicles that the government had been asking them to build.

The film then takes a quick look back at Preston Tucker and how his car company failed. And compares the difficulties he had with those that Elon Musk was having. He was going through hard times with SpaceX and Tesla, getting a divorce, and had gotten a new financee. In a similar way Lutz also has to handle difficulties in the design elements of the Volt. Elon then finds that there are a mass of Roadsters sitting in a garage all with small defects in them, which aren't being worked on at the time. Eventually they get to the director of the film's car and he 'Chris Paine' reluctantly makes another cameo in one of his films. As the US manufactures are having problems, in Japan the Nissan LEAF is globally launched.

Gadget manages to get some loans and buys a old shed style garage where he can work once again. Tesla begins delivering cars, as Martin Eberhard is removed as president of the company. Elon eventually becomes CEO of the company and has to give the company $3 million to keep it going. They next raise prices to meet production demands. Sadly, as he is seen in the movie, these are some of Elon's most rude and grumpy moments. He later says that in these moments he was near total nervous breakdown. Tesla takes out a loan from the Department of Energy to keep the business going and to finish designing their family car the Model S.

Back in Detroit a church holds a service, which hopes that the US government will help the automobile industry, which most of the people there depend on. GM went through bankruptcy and after which the government loaned them the funds they would need to reopen.

Back in California 'Gadget' finds that the building he has been working in is full of harmful chemicals left over from the previous owners, he is getting sick, and has to stop working on his conversion. Meanwhile the LEAF goes on its USA promotional campaign. As GM goes through its new changes, Bob struggles to keep the Volt program going while finding time for his family. Once again in California Tesla has made a deal with Daimler automotive, and while waiting for the government's loan,  Tesla launches their 'Model S' sedan. Shortly before the event begins, and at which Elon will spend most of the night trying to sell deposits on the cars, he says ""It won't be fun for me, but I hope its fun for others.""

At the 'North American Auto show' the Tesla Roadster, Volt and Leaf are shown, while walking around doing interviews, Elon and Bob meet and they find themselves in front of the LEAF and discuss what they think are the advantages their cars have over it. Turning towards Tennessee, Carlos is busy at a ground breaking ceremony for a the factory that will build LEAFs in the USA. Shortly afterward Elon Musk is seen at the launch of Tesla Motors on the stock exchange, a day in which they raise $226 million. Next the Chevrolet Volt goes into production. As Nissan gets a similar loan to its competitors, for the building of their factory for the LEAF. Tesla opens their new Headquarters, as Elon makes an opening toast to ""Get us off F***ing oil as fast as possible."" The only 'strong language' used in the film. Gadget gets a new place and can begin work again.

There is a short montage of EVs being delivered, along with scenes of solar and wind power plants. Then Danny Devito is seen getting the delivery of his new GM car a Volt. Next there is a preview of new EV models that are being produced, as the Volt and LEAF are returned to, and it tells what awards each has won. It is then announced that Tesla got their government loan, there is footage of their new Tesla factory opening, and the announcement that Elon married Talulah his financee. Bob is seen in the shadows, looking out into a bright sunny day, and is said to have retired.

Similar to the beginning of the movie, Dan Neil talks about his new fondness for EVs as the movie closes. The credits begin to appear as Gadget is seen driving his finished conversion, reaching a distance of 121 and a half miles.

Besides the audio commentary by the director, the audio has music composed by David Robbins. The music is mostly symphonic, with traces of Jazz, Pop/Techno, most of the interviews and conversations are left without music. There are the occasional rock and roll tracks. This time Tim Robbins gives the narration, his deep voice gives a tone of sorrow to the struggles that are encountered to the people with in the movie.

If you like Elon Music's story, I reccomend watching two other documentaries about him. ""Bloomberg's Risk Takers: Elon Musk"", and National Geographic's ""Mega Factories Supercars: Tesla"" (a documentary of the production and release of the Model S). Another documentaries you might like is ""Making of the Mitsubisih i-MiEV Electric Car"".",1387411200,4,10491,4.667748917748917

4893193,5,B005TZFZK6,"Loved this movie.
After I saw this movie, I got the video, and then I got solar panels and now I have a 100% electric Nissan LEAF that I plug into those solar panels.

NO gas.
NO oil changes.
NO tune-ups.
NO valves, rings, pistons, timing belt.
NO transmission, transmission fluid or shifting gears to interrupt acceleration.
NO carburetor or air filter.
NO radiator, engine coolant, water pump or hoses to maintain.
NO regular powertrain maintenance.
NO smog checks ever.

And after use of the carpool lanes by hybrids ended in June of 2011, the all-electric car still qualifies, so Doug can also continue smile and wave as he zips past the traffic as well.

Added a license plate frame that says, Powered by Sunshine and a bumper sticker that reads, Alternative Energy is Homeland Security.

I keep hearing from people that I should be concerned about range anxiety.
I hear rumors that the price of gas is going up. Do drivers of gas cars fear gas price anxiety?

When I was thinking about getting the LEAF, a number of people warned me that it just isn't practical. Today, all the people who warned me are grumbling and complaining about high gas prices. All those like me who plug a LEAF into solar panels are not complaining; we are happy. I find it hilarious when people try to explain why something doesnt really work, to those of us who make it work every day.",1372723200,6,1368,4.590163934426229

4893210,1,B005TZFZK6,"If his Who Killed the Electric Car? didn't establish Chris Paine as the prime distorter of the history of the
electric car, this film will probably complete the task. The claimed ""revenge"" extracted by that technology is
pretty tame stuff, to judge by the anemic EV sales of the vehicles in his film, which Paine has anointed as virtual saviors of our civilization. For some reason he claims modern gas powered vehicles to be smoke producing machines
rendering most of the population respiratory-stricken, wheezing for air. The only smoke I see associated with
passenger cars is the smoke coming from the coal plants that produce the electricity required by Paine's ""clean air electric vehicles"" (California laughably claims they are ""zero emission vehicles."") Sure they are.
  What should be laid to rest by what has transpired since his initial film, is Paine's loony theory that , once govts force automakers to produce cars in quantity, their previously exorbitant costs (which he deemed due to low production rates) would drop enormously. Well, the all electric Nisan Leaf has cost-benefited about as much as possible from mass production : it shares a production line with its sister non-electric brethren, and virtually all of its parts are being produced in large quantities. It still costs way too much for what it offers (a 76 mile driving range). Its sales volumes are very low, despite being sold practically everywhere on the planet. This despite a $7500 Federal subsidy to the owners.
  Somebody please tell the mentally anemic Paine that ""It's the batteries, Stupid. They cost too much and don't last very long. And, oh yes, they recharge slowly and weigh a ton."" THAT is the sole reason electrics have not yet replaced gas powered vehicles. All of Paine's celebration of recent EV auto offerings can be tossed into the nearest wastebasket as pure BS, along with his film. Electric cars will arrive when better batteries arrive. Not before.

4893214,4,B005TZFZK6,"A very fine effort and an important film for future generations.  There's no hiding the fact that oil is not a renewable resource and that we will run out of it within the next century, so it's incredibly important to quickly move off our dependence on oil, and that's where this movie comes into play.  We, as a society, need to get that message out there that if we don't move towards renewable and affordable energy alternatives like this electric car, then we will be in dire straits, and this movie shows how we will achieve this goal by gradually but steadily move beyond gas-only driven vehicles.

Fortunately there are visionaries out there like Elon Musk and the Nissan CEO Carlos Ghosn who see the writing on the wall and are acting on it by producing practical, efficient and hopeful cars that are purely electric that can stand up against their gas driven counterparts.  It takes revolutionaries to begin and drive a concept and to keep fighting for it and luckily people as well as governments are getting the message and taking it seriously, and 'Revenge of the Electric Car' carries this message very eloquently.

Granted the movie is biased in favor of the electric car and is opposed to gas driven vehicles on the principle that they're not sustainable for the future, but with that bias comes logic based on the undeniable facts of petroleum, it's running out and we need to move on with something better suited for the future.  Not only is it economical but it's also better for the environment, so it's a win-win for customers.

Tesla Motors has the look down for electric cars which is appealing to the masses, while Nissan still has a ways to go to make its Leaf car a more attractive ride, because let's face it, people base their car buying decisions on the looks, and unfortunately many if not most of the electric cars and hybrids look too unorthodox for people to embrace them, and that remains one of the biggest obstacles.  Hopefully Nissan and other car companies will take some inspiration from Tesla Motors and design better looking electric cars in order to get more people on board.  That and they need to increase the range capacity.  Take the Leaf for example, it's limited to 100 miles, which is decent but it's mostly for city driving, people in rural areas/states can't rely on because they have to drive several hundred miles.  Now GM's Volt by Bob Lutz is a smarter alternative so far because it has a gas backup tank for the electric motor, so drivers can switch back and forth depending on usage.

With these innovations coming along and with other companies moving in the same or similar direction, it won't take too long before everyone follows suit and eventually we the consumers will benefit when it comes to our pocket books as well as making it a healthier place to live and breath with no more smog and less carbon dioxide causing damage.

The film does an admirable job of showing what the industry as well as what the private sector does to create and innovate within the field of electric vehicles, and all biases aside, it makes a compelling argument that this is a feasible and intelligent move toward the future as we lessen our dependence on an unsustainabile resource, oil.  This movie should be shown in schools across the country, to wake people up from the pipe dream that we can continue to drive gasoline engines indefinitely because that's not only unrealistic, it's also dangerous to not know the truth and what the consequences are if we don't take the steps now to ensure the prosperity and well-being of our future generations.  It's more than just a documentary about efficient and environmental vehicles, it concerns humanity as a whole for generations to come, so hopefully the word will spread and more people will see the bigger picture that this movie indirectly portrays.",1334620800,2,3847,4.7380239520958085
4893215,4,B005TZFZK6,"Those interested in the automobile, its history and development will probably find this one interesting, I know I did. Most of us likely have feelings of frustration when it comes to importing oil from volatile areas of the world where supply lines are vulnerable to disruption at almost any time. It is equally frustrating when our government has all but shut down oil exploration and production in this country as green energy is pursued with questionable success.

Alternate sources of energy which would be useful for automotive use have been hard to identify or present technological problems which have no immediate solution. The use of electricity has stumbled at the problem of storage; the successful production of an all-electric automobile that would be a suitable replacement for our present gas powered model is still waiting for an electrical storage device that will take a charge quickly and have an extended range more comparable to the current gasoline powered model.

What this documentary does is explore the efforts of four separate groups that are trying to provide a workable interim solution; Nissan, General Motors, Tesla Motors, and an individual entrepreneur who is working on conversion of existing automobiles to electric powered vehicles. What is conspicuous by its absence is any reference to the most successful hybrid to date, the Toyota Prius. It would appear that Toyota's approach to the problem, using a small gasoline engine to help compensate for the limited battery storage capacity is the ideal until vastly improved storage along with quicker charge times becomes technologically feasible.

One thing encouraging out of all of this is to note that American ingenuity has been stirred up and that is a potent force.",1334534400,3,1756,5.219858156028369

Car geeks will absolutely love the ""insider"" accounts of how GM, Nissan, and Tesla (a new, upstart car company) each worked to develop a new electric vehicle that was both affordable and user-friendly--the Volt, the Leaf, and the Roadster, respectively. As this documentary makes abundantly clear, the future of our global economy is predicated on green, clean energy--it makes sense for the environment, and it makes sense for sustainable economics. If this film's predictions are correct, it will be just a matter of years until we all begin transitioning to electric vehicles. I suspect, by that time, they'll become more affordable and more user-friendly.

4893217,4,B005TZFZK6,"Having followed the slow progress of EVs over the past 20 years I just had to see this documentary.
Here are some of my thoughts that answer some of the questions you may have after seeing it.

~ It's not all about us in the USA! Other countries will adopt and use EVs faster than us to get away from their high cost gasoline. Some countries have even mandated it.

~ EVs are the only cars that will get ""cleaner"" as they age because nations will upgrade to cleaner power generation systems.

~ For those of you who scoffed at the Prius, just watch the rapid worldwide adoption of these pure electric vehicles.

~ The Chevy Volt. A cruel 10 year late-to-the-game joke on the American  public. It still has a gas engine, so it's a hybrid!! So GM, please stop selling it as an EV. The Volt is the worst halfway technology to be created since the Jarvik 7 artificial heart. Sorry Prius, you're also included in this category.

~ The hall of mirrors unscientific right wing arguments on the net environmental damage that hybrids and EVs do is pure politics. Even the veteran Detroit executive Bob Lutz realizes that the genie is outta the bottle. Sorry big oil, you had your chances and you blew it.

~ No charging infrastructure? Err last time I checked, electricity is fed to almost every building in the country...",1334188800,4,1313,4.514767932489452
4893218,3,B005TZFZK6,"When I saw the director's first film ""Who Killed the Electric Car?"" I was outraged at the corporate myopia. So of course I was glad to see this new film showing GM eating crow and EVs in America finally getting some traction.

I used to be very excited and hopeful about electric cars. (The first documentary also opened my eyes to probably the main reason GM killed EVs: they require little maintenance, but maintenance is a huge cash cow for auto dealers.)

However, my thinking has recently changed.

I now think that gas cars are not the problem - it's cars of any type that are the problem. Cars and their infrastructure are terribly wasteful of resources. Using them for mass transit is near-insanity. We must get away from burning fossil fuels for energy, yes. Electric cars are somewhat better, but not greatly so. EVs are not going to save the planet - we must make much bigger changes than that.

The book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Green-Illusions-The-Dirty-Secrets-of-Clean-Energy-and-the-Future-of-Environmentalism-Our-Sustainable-Future/dp/0803237758/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Green Illusions: The Dirty Secrets of Clean Energy and the Future of Environmentalism (Our Sustainable Future)</a>&nbsp;is what changed my mind. I also read an enlightening piece by the author in the Christian Science Monitor - some quotes follow:

""It takes a lot of fossil fuel to craft a battery... the environmental damage stemming from grid-dependent hybrids and electric vehicles will be greater than that of traditional gasoline-driven cars until at least 2030, even when assuming favorable technological advances.

""The suburban architecture of fully disengaged homes and megastores, connected by wide streets and highways, has prompted a mass deployment of energy resources that would have been unthinkable just a generation before its formation. It is from within the suburban addiction that Americans grew to understand extreme energy waste as perfectly normal....

""Some community groups are saying 'No.' They're showing how concerned citizens are better achieving their environmental objectives by supporting more durable options such as walkable neighborhoods, bicycling infrastructure, carpooling, traffic calming and comfortable public transit."" (Christian Science Monitor, Ozzie Zehner, February 13, 2012)

I also read recently that the biggest energy cost for a car is its manufacture. Cheaper cars usually the greenest because they take less energy to produce.

So unfortunately it was hard for me to be very excited about this documentary. I would have enjoyed it a lot more a year ago. But now I think the excitement over EVs is misguided.",1334016000,2,2700,5.73
4893219,5,B005TZFZK6,"Every time I fill my Prius these days, I'm so thankful that I have a car that is at least partly electric and gives me a lot of miles per gallon.  I can imagine how much better it would be if I had a car that was totally electric but there aren't many affordable electric cars out there yet. This documentary gives me hope that there will soon be more energy efficient cars available.  This movie was not only informative, it was very entertaining.  I loved the way it gave insight into the first electric cars and how GM destroyed them.  It showed some of the small companies like Tesla that were trailblazers with the first all-electric vehicles.  Wow, I wish I could afford one of those!  That has to be one of the best looking cars I've seen.

The documentary also showed how resistant GM was to develop new electric models when there were Japanese carmakers that were selling so many hybrids and Americans were willing to pay a premium for them and even wait in line to get them in some cases.  It has to make you wonder what they were thinking!  I suppose the oil industry has something to do with it and with the general lack of efficient transportation other than the car.  But that's another story.

The filming, interviews, presentation were all outstanding on this movie.  If you like automobiles and/or you like the thought of cleaning up the environment and becoming less dependent of foreign oil, I think you'll be cheering some of the successes and feel frustrated with some of the delays in getting this next generation of vehicles to the market.",1333756800,4,1562,4.559139784946237

It also explores the people who made it happen and the things they had to go through to make it happen.  Everything from the Tesla to the Leaf, to the Volt to custom made electric cars. It also covers the basics of what was in ""The Death of the Electric Car.""  I was really surprised that Nissan basically bet the company on the Leaf and it's follow-ons.  I was also surprised that the person pushing the Volt was actually wanting it to be totally plug-in electric, like the Leaf, but couldn't convince management.

All-in-all a very enlightening film.",1331856000,3,716,4.606299212598425
4893222,4,B005TZFZK6,"Going into this I wasn't quite sure what to think... It purported to be about how the electric car is coming and it'll be replacing gas-guzzling cars soon. It's time has come...

In reality, the movie is more about the CHALLENGES of even bringing such a thing to market. Auto manufacturers once tried the electric car and then recalled and destroyed most of them.

Then the economic crisis hit and gas prices started going up, so now we don't want to be dependent on oil anymore, so... ""the electric car's time has come!"" Well, okay, not really. There's no infrastructure. Battery technology is still not yet fully fledged. They can only go so long without a recharge. Sure, we've got a few hybrids on the road, but they're still expensive. Tesla Motors has tried putting electric cars into production, but have found it far more expensive and time-consuming to design them than originally anticipated and had to raise prices on folks who had reserved cars. Various car companies are still designing and re-designing them, but we still haven't arrived yet.

So, perhaps the ""revenge"" of the electric car is on the manufacturers trying to manufacture and sell them or the lobbyists trying to tout the benefits and get them made by the car companies. And yet, for all the braying of the proponents, again, we're just not there yet. Car companies are slow to adapt, consumers are slow to embrace, etc.

In the end, I didn't come away feeling like the electric car has had its revenge or really even much opened the door. There are still major social and technical hurdles to overcome. Not least of all infrastructure (recharging stations as ubiquitous as gas stations) and public perception.

So, it's kind of a mixed bag. If you're into seeing some of the CHALLENGES facing car companies and specifically the electric car's adoption, this is the movie for you. If you're looking for a feel-good piece about the bright shiny future just around the corner, well, you might be a little disappointed.

Seems like the answer is a perpetual ""Change is a-comin', we just, uhh, don't know when or how...""",1329955200,,2094,4.802777777777778
4893223,4,B005TZFZK6,"Revenge of the Electric Car is a documentary showing the progress and obstacles the electric car has had to face in order to make it's way into widespread distribution. You may have heard of the EV1 from GM that was released several years ago, before the world was really ready for it (gas was still cheap and CEOs just did not see the business sense in pursuing it). Now, however things have changed.

The world is in a recession. The American car industry almost died. Even foreign car makers have suffered greatly. Gas prices continue to rise but salaries aren't rising with it. Awareness of environmental concerns among the public has grown (and it IS an issue in the public mind, whether you believe in global warming or not). Now we see the technology coming back, ""with a vengeance"". The push to get rid of the gas guzzlers is on!

There is some good information here. Most people probably are not aware that the Tesla, the guy who created Paypal then sold it to eBay for millions, also has an electric car company (which almost went under when the recession hit but the government gave him a loan). Bob Lutz, who was vehemently opposed to the electric car, began to embrace it . . . and then got retired.

Unlike many documentaries, this one did not get overly preachy. That's a good thing. Some people expressed their opinions about the direction of the auto industry but skeptics were also included so there is a less lopsided view in this film than in others (and that very concept plagues documentaries). Naturally, one of the biggest areas of debate is the actual affect on the environment as there are plenty of scientists who indicate that a single volcanic eruption causes more atmospheric pollutants than all of the cars put together. The CEO of Nissan, interviewed in this documentary said it best when he stated that it didn't matter if he believed in global warming or not, the public sees it as an issue and expects a response.

There's no analysis of where the electrical power comes from, or whether electric cars are the right option for mass-replacement of internal combustion automobiles. Nothing of substance on battery technology, or on safety.

Rather it's a documentary about the people and personalities (many of them famous in the People magazine version of fame) who are excited about electric cars. The former governor of California makes a 20 second appearance. There's nothing really wrong with this cheerleader documentary, but for what could be a serious topic, it's really a superficial take on it. Lots of celebrities and paeans to people power for bringing the electric car back post-EV1. Enjoyable, but it's dessert rather than a full meal.",1329436800,3,880,5.330935251798561

It plays out like a fictional story with villains, side plots, mysteries, etc.  It was such a compelling story and the subject matter played so perfectly in to the high gas priced climate of 2006 when I saw it.  So after hearing they were making Revenge of the Electric Car, I was onboard and ready to watch!

The only problem is that now gas price consciousness has become more mainstream.  So in other words, the ability to get electric cars and hybrids became mainstream as well.  I wasn't for sure how you could top a movie like ""Who Killed"" after seeing this change.

I can say that the makers of this documentary did it.  The story once again is compelling, but now from the perspective of the race to create scenario.  Now each of the car makers were shown as neck and neck enthusiasts fighting to dominate this new electric car frontier.

The most surprising aspect of this movie had to do with the historical philosphies of GM looking to the future openingly, without the hestitation you would expect.  Then you have the up and coming Tesla Motors which moved the idea of Detroit based design to computerized Silicone Valley.  And last but not least, there's Nissan - hiding the shadows waiting to unveil their secret weapon.  What you get, beyond an updated history lesson on electric cars, is a great docudrama.  The story once again sucked me in.

I can say that I like ""Who Killed"" better, but this was a worthy follow up.  The only issue is that it felt (still) too soon to comment on the situation.  Another installment could be made in five years and just as much could be said to further the story.

I didn't know the technology was around & being used by the public.  I guess I was still pretty young then & not paying attention to much.

It was great to see the different aspects of the business.  You have the person working from their garage.  Then Mr. Paypal who has tons of money but no experience building cars like GM & others.  Then our US major car maker & finally our ""enemy"" - the Non US major car maker whom I was very impressed with; his confidence plus he seemed the most in control & in the game compared to everyone else.

The inventiveness of everyone is astounding & brings hope to our abused little planet.  It is my hope that we can find something even better than the electric car since electricity is hardly a clean option either!  I know, I know, there is wind power, solar power, hydro power, thermal power & more.  They all have their limits & they themselves need improvement.  You also must take into consideration the ramifications of having those giant toxic batteries.  It makes me wonder if we are simply trading one evil for another.

I was hoping to see something about the Prius. The Prius seemed to be the ice breaker for a greener car.  I know it's a hybrid, but look at how popular it became & now even trendy.

For those of you looking to see Arnold like I was, it's for about 20 seconds.  He appears at a car show & gets a very quick interview.

This would make a great movie to show in schools.  It leaves a lot of room for discussion & ideas for the future.  I hope that if it interests you even a little, you will watch it.  It is by no means a waste of time.",1329177600,12,2149,4.148058252427185

I thought this film would be cheerleading for the current line of electric cars, which it is to an extent, but it's also a look at the lives of four men striving to make their mark on the industry. All of the stories are fascinating and the personal tone is a nice touch.

You get a first hand look at the stresses of a GM executive getting forced into retirement after helping get the Volt going, a silicon valley PayPal inventor sinking his life savings into Tesla motors, the CEO of Nissan, and an enthusiast whose home lab and home gets burned to the ground by arsonists.

The filmmakers have gotten unbelievable access to the movers and shakers in this industry like Elon Musk, Bob Lutz, and Carlos Ghosn. Most of the people I wasn't familiar with. The story of the development of this industry was also largely unknown to me. They not only covered the major automakers, though. There is also apparently a large underground movement of private individuals out there building or retrofitting their own cars to be electric. The in and outs of this movement were surprisingly dramatic to me.

There are no losers here we see these winners in action and as a result of there efforts we all win!
I am rooting for Tesla and the success of the Model S. This should lead to, hopefully, the next major growth industry in Silicon Valley --- the electric auto industry.

4893234,3,B005TZFZK6,"Watching this movie helped me get to know some very interesting people. Never knew the name Bob Lutz before this documentary. Lutz is a retired GM guy. By most accounts a brilliant business strategist. The word `avuncular' might have been invented to describe him.  You can immediately notice the friendly charisma.

Then I met Carlos Ghosn, who is the CEO of Nissan. He doesn't come across as avuncular, but rather very sincere. He comes across very intelligent, passionate, and really believes what he says.

Elon Musk, founder of PayPal, has put much of the money he had made from the electronic payment company he founded on an electric car called Tesla. It has paid off well for this South African technical genius.

The character I was least impressed with was the electric car itself. All of the `re-charging' is shown in sunny California. Didn't see a practical way to charge an electric car in snowy Upstate New York in winter; especially if you're living in an apartment. We still don't know how long the life of the batteries in current electric cars last for. If they're anything like the batteries in our laptops, forget it. They maybe good for the first year, but then what? Recharge every 15 minutes? Where? I think a fundamental technological shift will be needed for democratizing alternate energy for common vehicles.

I would recommend this movie for you to meet the people behind the technology that is the electric car.",1328572800,5,1440,4.8612244897959185
4893235,3,B005TZFZK6,"""Revenge of the Electric Car"" is a sequel to Chris Paine's 2006  ""Who Killed the Electric Car?""  The documentary illustrates the efforts of auto manufacturers to rethink the commercial viability of the electric car.  CEO's from Tesla Motors, Nissan, and GM are interviewed about past missteps and current strategies in making and marketing electric cars.

The underlying theme of the  documentary is that auto manufacturers have come to the realization that electric cars are inevitable and have seriously attempted to work out development, testing, and how to convince consumers to buy.  Right now, electric cars get about 100 miles to the charge, which might be OK for some folks, but seems inadequate for those who plan long trips.  That's a major shortcoming that has to be overcome.

Paine lays out the facts, provides a bit of history of the electric car, and presents the ideas and long-range plans of auto makers, but there really is no conclusion.  The end of the story is yet to be told, and that depends on the economy (Tesla Motors tanked in 2008 when the economy took a nose dive), how seriously we want to wean ourselves of foreign oil,  improved mileage per charge, cost to the consumer and, of course, profitability.

This film doesn't have the impact Paine's earlier documentary did, primarily because it deals with executives who are on the side of the electric car, not against it.  There is no outrage from consumers at having their leased electric cars taken away and no real sense of expose.  It's a fairly routine story, updating the viewer on what's on the minds of the auto makers, but not offering any ""big"" moments.  The tone is the same throughout and tends to become dull when too many talking heads dominate.  If you haven't seen Paine's first film, ""Who Killed the Electric Car?,"" check it out first.  It's the better of the two films.",1328054400,,1866,4.820754716981132

4893237,3,B005TZFZK6,"A better title would be ""Who Wants to Build an Electric Car?"" This film is all about the personalities of three people instrumental in reviving electric car design and manufacture and a fourth who does it as a hobby/business. It does not provide a satisfactory answer to the question of why the electric car should be returning so soon after GM killed it -- other than the enthusiasm of a few influential and enterprising people. The film presents almost no facts and figures to support the case for electric cars. You have to listen closely to hear the principal characters mention a few details like the range.

The deficiency of this film becomes obvious when you think about what it does not contain.

* Very little about the electric technology
* Nothing on battery technology
* No price projections or discussion of affordability
* Very little about environmental impact
* Little distinction between pure electric and plug-in hybrid cars
* Other than a little strategy, no business case for making electric cars
* No clue how individual electric car conversions can be competitive
* No projection of future gasoline price or electric car economics
* No consumer survey
* Nothing on electric charging stations or infrastructure
* Nothing on incompatibility of charging requirements among the different cars

This film skipped around a lot and devoted time to many irrelevant scenes that could have been used for the above topics. It deserves three stars for a good ""behind the scenes"" story, but it fails to make a case for or against electric cars, and it does not provide the facts that the viewer needs to form an opinion about the future of electric cars. The result is an anticlimactic ending. We are left with an empty feeling. Have we seen a story about brilliant visionary people or foolish deluded money wasters?",1327795200,4,1826,4.883870967741935

Soon after the start of the new millennium US automobile companies built electric cars.  The most successful was GM's EV1.  Customers liked their EV1s but General Motors recalled all 5000 and put the model in limbo.  Why did they abolish a successful automobile that ran without petroleum?

Revenge of the Electric Car tells the story of the fall and rise of the electric automobile.  Three companies are involved in the resurgence of this machine: Tesla, GM, and Nissan.  A small company called Gadget remodels  existing gas automobiles into ones that run on electricity.

The small companies are struggling, but the two major companies appear committed to producing an electric vehicle that can eventually replace internal combustion petroleum models.  Revenge of the Electric Car presents the story of this effort with a bit of mystery and a bit of pizzazz.

The only real problem I see with the electric models presented in this documentary is the number of miles a person can get with a single charge.  Currently the available models have an effective range of approximately 150 miles.  That capacity is fine for a car a person drives around most towns, but seriously limits longer range travel.  At least one model has a generator to refresh the batteries while driving, but they admit the generator production only adds a few miles.  Another model has a small gas engine as a backup that significantly adds to the range, but that makes it a hybrid instead of an electric car.

Several of the cars presented in this documentary are tempting, and once they improve the capacity of the generator, I intend to purchase one.  The quiet, absence of pollutants and ability to avoid petroleum make these vehicles tempting.

This is an informative film that will be attractive to people concerned with high gas prices, and people involved the ""green"" movement.  I recommend this film.",1327708800,4,1885,4.964856230031949

4893240,4,B005TZFZK6,"I think most everyone will agree that we need to end our dependence on petroleum products to drive our nation's economy. Is the Electric Car the solutions?  Maybe, Maybe not - but it's certainly a step in the right directions.  ""Revenge of The Electric Car"" is the addendum to ""Who Killed The Electric Car"" a  2006 documentary film which followed GM's EV1 to its baffling and rather sinister demise.

The film divides its focus on 4 factions of the ""New"" Electric Car gurus: GM's cigar chomping, ""take no prisoners"" Bob Lutz, Nissan's ""Be where your enemy isn't"" Carlos Ghosn, Tesla Motors ""Silicon Valley can do a better job than Detroit"" Elon Musk and Greg ""Gadget"" Abbot who lives in his motor home and builds EV conversions no matter what obstacles lay in his path.

Director Chris Paine's POV in Revenge seems to be from the ""inside looking out"".  The motives of each segment, be they self-serving or altruistic, are examined.  The fact that the Big Auto Giants decided to get serious at the same time as the economy is collapsing turned the drama into a kind of Greek Morality Play with the American Government playing the part of the Deus Ex Machina.

The film tells the story of how each segment either got started or recovered.  Nissan's Leaf is seen on the start of its cross country expedition ending on Electric Alley at an auto show.  Ghosn is also seen with plans to open a battery factory in the South.  Tesla gets a line of credit from Daimler & $465MM from the Feds.  GM starts its uphill climb after the bailout subsequently putting Lutz out to pasture and Gadget finds a new home to continue his conversions.  In the end all of the players seem to be Survivors in the current round of eliminations.  I personally am rooting for them all and wish them well.",1327622400,3,1775,4.593650793650793
