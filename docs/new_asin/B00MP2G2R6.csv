6598488,4,B00MP2G2R6,My friends keep telling me to buy this anime and I got it. It's not that bad. But case came busted up top. Got to spend another 10 bucks on a case. Oddly the broken off parts where not in the package. Hope it wasn't mailed off like this.,1505174400,,237,3.857142857142857
6598489,3,B00MP2G2R6,"Okay, The anime itself I give 5 stars, but the seller technically screwed me over on the box part. The disk came in tact but the Blu-rays were supposed to come with a cardboard like box that holds the casing. Mine didn't and I know it was supposed to. I have the other two season and as someone who has the whole set but missing only one ""box cover"" because the seller didn't send it is something I believe to be nonsense.",1504656000,,422,4.158536585365853

6598493,5,B00MP2G2R6,"Otaku John, the super-fan of anime, manga, and light novels here to review High School DxD New (season 2).  Lets get down to basics, for Anime fans, either you love High School DxD or you hate it, there's no in between. For True Otaku like me, you either love High School DxD, or you REALLY LOVE it!  Needless to say, I REALLY LOVE this series. Sure, it's pure comedy, fan service, fun, and never takes itself seriously, but that's what's so great about it. There's also plenty of action and believe it or not, a great plot, with in-depth characters that are each unique with great backstory. Animation is top-notch, voice acting perfect. This series is worth every penny. As far as this second season is concerned, it ups the ante from season one, and keeps you wanting more! Buy it, you won't be disappointed. I also highly recommend reading the Manga for this series too...  And if the light novels ever become available in the USA, get them, because they're the best!",1503878400,,971,4.601156069364162

6598909,5,B00MP2G2R6,"High School DXD was a delight. The sequel could have been a disappointment but it wasn't. It's a huge success. All the elements that made the original such a delight are there. The fan service is a clear part of this and one which can't be ignored. The characters keep their strengths and in the case of Akeno and Rias develop their complex relationship to each other and Issei. The series has two main plot arcs. The first concerns holy swords and is probably the stronger of the two. It allows the development of Kiba and adds another character, Xenovia.
The second arc develops the complex world story and the conflict between the angels, fallen angels, and demons. It also introduces Gasper (the third ""wise man"") as an additional male character after Kiba and Issei.
High School DXD New keeps the strengths of the first series. It is action packed, the girls are lovely (especially Akeno), the plots are strong enough and, most importantly, it keeps it's sense of humour and fun. If you liked the first series then this will not disappoint. Let's look forward to series 3.",1419984000,,1077,4.703703703703703

6598936,4,B00MP2G2R6,"After going through season 1, I was pretty impressed with this ecchi anime to where I needed to get Season 2. While Season 2 was not as good as Season 1, the final battle and preparations for future seasons got me excited for the future.
The overall story arcs for both of the main storylines were fairly lackluster. While they did introduce some new, main characters to the harem, they honestly were not that interesting. I never thought I'd say this but the major storyline that revolves around angels, demons, and fallen angels just wasn't that interesting this time around. The main character never went through a ""Let's Train! OMG"" montage that's become the norm for other more action oriented animes, and he never really developed as a character. I was honestly disappointed with the series up until the final battle sequence that was really good. While the anime was never going to be entirely focused on action, I was fairly glad to see them finally give Issei, the main character, a chance to really shine at the end as he never really did anything but be impressed by boobs the rest of the time.
In the end, the final battle sequence really saved this season for me and gets me excited for future episodes. The Dub here is good in the fact that it is really funny and I found myself laughing at some of the things that were said more than a few times. While it may not be great, I would still recommend watching the Dub. They got things right as far as the tone and when to take things seriously.
I'd definitely recommend this to people who have seen the first season and were fans. But this will not make you a fan of the genre is you didn't already like it. It won't sway people who don't already like the ecchi subject matter, especially since there is definitely alot more full-on nudity in this season than the previous one.",1419638400,,1839,4.508982035928144

6598941,5,B00MP2G2R6,"This show is about one tentacle short of being hentai!  If you're offended by... well, pretty much anything, you might want to give this one a pass.  It's full of constant nudity, constant references to sex (although strangely, no one ever seems to actually have any), various activities some might consider perverted (finger sucking, spanking, etc.), and some pretty sacrilegious themes.  Heck, even the opening and closing credits are R-rated!

It's basically a harem comedy with a thin plot about a 3-way war between devils, angels, and fallen angels wrapped around it.  The main character, Issei, dreams of becoming a big-shot devil and having his own harem.  One of his primary battle skills is being able to blast the clothing off of female opponents.

6598957,5,B00MP2G2R6,"Funny, action-packed, and non-stop fun. I can't wait for season 3 now. This is official in my top 5 favorite anime series of all time.",1417737600,,134,4.4
6598958,5,B00MP2G2R6,"Although it was not my first anime, Highschool DxD stands tall as the greatest anime I have ever watched. Not because it has an unprecedented story or deep subjects, but because it's one hundred percent, unadulterated fun. Following the resurrected Issei Hyoudo as he works as a devil for the house of Rias Gremory, DxD New continues the saga as Issei begins to delve deeper into the world of the gods. He learns more about the past lives of his devil pals and begins to truly unleash his inner dragon.

If you're new to the series, I highly recommend you watch season 1 before you buy this. You'll need to get used to the characters, but mostly you should just watch it because it's just as great as this season. Plus, you kind of miss the relationship developments between Issei and all of his friends and foes, meaning you'll definitely be lost if you just dive in to season 2 blindly.

One for the reasons this series is so fantastic is its perfect blend of comedy, action, and perverted moments and scenes. Issei is a massive pervert with a heart of gold, so while he may dream of groping a harem all the live-long day, he endears himself to you because, despite loving boobs more than anything, in the end he cares for his friends and will fight for them until the bitter end. I find him to be incredibly relatable, to he point where I can usually see myself doing exactly what he does throughout the series. I also want to bring up that, because he is a pervert, there are not only dirty jokes involved, but also MASSIVE amounts of uncensored topless shots and bare female rumps. Don't worry, you can't see any genitalia, but there are nipple shots galore (especially when you've got Issei's magical clothes-destroying special technique around).

But the dirty hero isn't the only reason why the show is so great. From President Rias, struggling with other-worldly politics and jealousy over the other girls, to Akeno's budding feelings, Kiba's troubled past and more- this show's got a cavalcade of memorable characters. I've pretty much got the cast's mannerisms and names memorized at this point, they're so unique. The villains are great as well; Freed Selsen (Selzen? Selsen? not sure how that's spelled) always steals the show when he's around, not to mentioned Vali and Azazel are both great characters. I will say that the villain they threw into the last two episodes felt shoehorned, but I have a feeling the next season will expand on that escapade.

This brings me to my last point- DxD is endearing. I can't help but root for Issei, and given that the subject matter is basically ""take the Christian mythology of angels and demons, amp it up all the way to eleven, and then throw it into a blender with Dragon Ball Z and some topless anime girl pictures"". The comedy keeps me rolling through every episode, the harem antics keep me rooting for our luckless Red Dragon Emperor, and the drama and action keeps me on the edge of my seat as Issei smashes his fists into anything that dare raises its fists against his friends and family.

Overall, I give it the absolute highest score I can give it. Unless you disapprove of dirty jokes and sexy anime girls, you should definitely check out Highschool DxD AND Highschool DxD New. And hope upon hope that you can sate your hunger for the series with that, because I haven't been able to. I've bought the translated graphic novels (light novels, as they are called) and I even downloaded the first six episodes of DxD New in Japanese for free simply because I couldn't wait for this Funimation release. A season 3 has already been announced- I just hope upon hope that it gets out ASAP. Trust me, when you watch it for yourself, you'll understand just how great (not to mention addicting) Highschool DxD truly is.",1417651200,,3777,4.6482035928143715

6598962,5,B00MP2G2R6,"First off, High School DxD is a fan service show.  It lives and breaths female nudity, and any chance the show gets, it will get its female characters naked to some degree.  Now, it wouldn't be all that entertaining if all there was nudity, so High School DxD also loads the show with plot.  Lots of plot!

It is shocking how developed the world of the show is.  From the three major factions (Devils, Angels and Fallen Angels) to how the interact, and the different powers and weapons available to them, High School DxD manages to tell a compelling, fun dark fantasy story while also building a detailed, thought out supernatural world.  While the first season focused more on the workings of the devil world, this season expands its focus to include focus not only on the church and the angels, but the fallen angels, and the three way war that created the creaky truce that is held by the three sides.

Somehow the show manages to handle all of that plot, plus character development, and yet still throws in a near constant barrage of boobs.  Yes, this show loves female chests.  If you are not seeing them (and those are rare moments), then you are hearing about them.  So, be ready going in for a near constant stream of female flesh.  Even if the episode itself is light on the fan service (and during some of the more battle heavy episodes, that does happen) the episode bumpers feature the female cast (and one male cast member...) in seductive, half naked or totally naked poses. This is how earns its TV-MA rating, although never fully slips into hentai territory, as the actual act of sex is only briefly joked about.

The art for the show is beautiful, with strong, colorful character designs.  Obviously, most of the focus is on the female characters, but the show does manage to also make its male characters equally attractive.  The animation is pretty good during fight scenes, but there are also a lot of pans and recycled animation.  Still, when it needs to, High School DxD has some very attractive action scenes.

I watched the show dubbed, after enjoying the first seasons cast very much.  The cast returns, and everyone seems very comfortable in their roles.  The dub isn't jaw dropping amazing, but it holds its own.  The DVD/Blu-ray set is packed with a bunch of extras, although sadly there are no episode commentaries this season.

If there is one complaint I can make is that the show ends with a set up for a third season.  There is a TON of story covered in these twelve episodes, and I hope that a third season happens, because there are so many places these stories and characters can go.",1416700800,40,2619,4.601293103448276

I just wish for once that when they go into English that certain characters speak in a different manner. I don't enjoy any of the stories that make out the young hero to be either effeminate or totally focused on boobs to the point that it becomes stupid. Perhaps someday there will be a character that enjoys the female body to the fullest without having to resort to the tired clichs and nose bleeds. Someone like that would definitely have the complete harem type attention without seeming like a pervert.",1416441600,5,595,4.622641509433962

6598976,4,B00MP2G2R6,"As far as harem anime/manga goes, this is probably the best one in every possible way. The art work is excellent and the story is good enough that most people will not notice or care about the stuff that makes no sense, like Issei acting shocked when Akeno reveals that she is Baraqiel's daughter in episode 10 despite Kokabiel clearly telling everyone that she is Baraqiel's daughter in episode 6. Unlike other similar titles (e.g. Freezing), this author does not try to take his story too seriously and mostly focuses on fan service, fighting, and the relationship/interactions of the main characters so, unlike in my review of Freezing I will not harp on the  inconsistencies in the story.

Instead, I will harp on the shockingly lazy work on the part of Funimation in adapting this work in English, both the sub and dub versions (which most people will not care about since most of the people who will buy this version do not speak Japanese or know much about Japanese culture). Some of the things Funimation did/changed were good. For example, downplaying Azazel's mental condition was probably necessary since most Americans do not understand what ""chuunibyou"" is, and those that do for the most part think it simply means delusional (I blame the handful of anime/manga that are about this condition for that). Also, the part where Akeno gets excited after Issei calls her by her given name would not resonate with Americans since it is customary for Americans to call even strangers by their given name so changing it to her wanting him to say she is naughty was necessary (and funny).

My main problem with this is lazy translations, like general-governor instead of governor-general, sacred treasure instead of sacred gear, and getting names, like Ophis wrong. Also, Serzechs is a given name, not a title and name put together (i.e. Sir Zechs) so the scene with him and Issei in episode 7 (english sub/dub) where he asks Issei to call him by his name and Issei refuses and asks to call him Serzechs instead makes no sense. Also, they did not bother to dub the bonus material, which is only about 20 minutes which was pretty lazy, but standard.

Finally, the English writers should stop trying to make the dialog (especially Motsuta and Motohama's) sound like realistic teenager dialog. Real teenagers do not say things like ""tots,"" ""cray-cray"" or ""dirty dirty freak freak"" in regular conversation (unless they are being tongue-in-cheek), those are things you hear is crappy songs where the artist is too lazy to think of words/phrases that rhyme and make sense so they make stuff up. Then, older people hear that music and think that is how young people actually talk. It is just stupid and they should knock it off.",1416355200,8,2725,4.8412017167381975
6598977,5,B00MP2G2R6,"Rias, Issei and the rest of the occult research club are back and they'll quickly learn there's no rest for the wicked! Once again old animosities from the great war between the righteous angels, deranged fallen angels and devils of the underworld reemerge, but this time around the occult research club will be pushed to their very limits.

Some may not be able to look past the excessive amounts of fan service in this series, but those that do will discover an absolutely amazing story with great characters. The animation is gorgeous, the characters are compelling, the story is intriguing and the English dub is excellent making this series a must own for any anime fan and still one of my favorite animes!

Be warned this anime contains some profanity and excessive amounts of fan service so it isn't suitable for children! Fan service involves bouncing breasts, skimpy bikinis, revealing clothing, glimpses of panties, brief nudity, sexual innuendos and suggestive themes.",1416182400,9,979,5.074534161490683
6598978,5,B00MP2G2R6,"High School DxD New, may not be for everyone or every anime fan.  But if you enjoyed anime such as Sekirei, Rosario + Vampire, To Love Ru, Date A Live, Heavens Lost Property & Countless others in that genre it's something to check out.  Heck, even if those titles didn't interest you, this anime has its own humor that is amazingly funny.
High School DxD New continues the story of season one following Issei but it adds so much more story, perversion, and humor.
If phrases or the words like ""Blonde and busty gets me lusty"", ""Breasticles"" or ""Harem King"" make you giggle even a little bit, this is something to definitely take a look into.
I'm sure you can get enjoyment from season 2 even if you haven't had the pleasure of season 1 yet.

8673726,4,B00MP2G2R6,"This show has a lot of fans and is one of the best in its genre and while I don't like everything about it, I do love the characters except the main female rias (who most of the fans like strangely enough). The show in my opinion has an average or slightly above average story and the combat is silly and not really appealing. The show excels in two areas
- character development
- ecchi /  harem / fan service
the show also is somewhat unique focusing on demons, angles and fallen angels which is kinda rare in anime and the fact that the show has this and is good is even rarer.
This is an easy decision to buy for yourself or as a gift, an anime doesnt get this many seasons by not being good ( especially when in this genre. If you've watched anime long you'll know that most anime end after the first season even the good ones.)",1522972800,,833,4.1419753086419755
