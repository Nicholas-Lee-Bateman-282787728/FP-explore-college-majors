7900619,3,7887630584,"""Dream of Red Mansions"" (HLM), with its extreme psychological realism and relative lack of dramatic action, poses difficult problems for anyone attempting to present it on the screen. While director Li Shaohong manages to hit some very nice notes over the course of the show's 50 hour-long episodes, her adaptation ultimately succumbs to fundamental problems with the quality of her actors and actresses.

The director clearly has worked very hard to present the material faithfully and intelligently. The dialogue and narration is taken straight out of the standard (Renmin Wenxue) edition of the novel, and it's really fun to finally find out roughly what the dialogue would have sounded like as spoken by the characters in the novel.  Li's inclusion of live performances of the Kunqu opera mentioned at various points in the novel is wonderfully done, and occasionally even adds new insight into the events of the novel as the opera scene unfolds in tandem with the plot.  The extreme attention Li's portrayal pays to the details of the characters' material lifestyle is useful for admirers of the novel, such as myself, who sometimes have difficulty understanding the book's fine-grained descriptions of things like 18th century Chinese dinnerware. At the other extreme, the director does an excellent job conjuring up a dreamlike ambience throughout the series, and the series successfully conveys how similar HLM's ""spookiness"" is to that of Pu Songling's contemporaneous Liaozhai Zhiyi.  Finally, all the pivotal moments in the novel are carried off without a hitch: the renditions of Lin Daiyu's poetry on her handkerchief and Ping Er's brief retreat to the garden are particularly moving.  I'm sad that the charming story of Xiangling's study of poetry under Lin Daiyu didn't make it in, but perhaps it was a few shades too literary for inclusion.

One of the main draws for me was Li's decision to use teenage actors and sidestep some of the problems the 1987 version has with casting 30-year-old women as young teenagers.  Unfortunately, these child actors are very much a mixed bag, and the overall poor quality of the acting ultimately makes it impossible to fully immerse oneself in the lush, painstakingly crafted environment. Yu Xiaotong does a great job of bringing Jia Baoyu's antics to life (right down to the dopey chuckle - perfect!), but Jiang Mengjie's halting delivery of Lin Daiyu's lines robs her performance of almost all emotional impact.  Some fuss has been made over Ms. Jiang's less-than-bone-thin physique, but this is only a real problem the one or two times during the run of the series that Daiyu's thinness is alluded to explicitly.  Ms. Jiang actually does have an air of Daiyu-ish melancholy about her; it's just a shame she fails to deliver her lines with Daiyu-ish sharpness.

Matters only get worse once the child actors are replaced with adult versions, starting roughly in Episode 33 (excepting Lin Daiyu - which makes sense - Xiren, and weirdly Jia Huan).  Yang Yang seems to speak the lines of the adult Baoyu with half a mouthful of porridge, completely ruining the effect of the pivotal ""Hibiscus Elegy"" scene, and  Zhang Xinyu's Jia Tanchun comes off as older than both Li Wan and Wang Xifeng.  It's not at all inappropriate, given the theme of the book, for the adults to be so much more dull than their child versions, but this further decline of the acting quality unfortunately weighs down the highlights (most notably, the kite scene) of the ""canonical"" first 80 chapters. That being said, Bai Bing does a stellar job in the final few episodes of portraying Xue Baochai's brief happiness, as all of her forbearance seems to pay off in a brief union with Jia Baoyu, and her final grief as Baoyu slips away.  Bai's genuinely moving rendition of a character I never much cared for prompted a re-thinking of my interpretation of the character based on the book: definitely a good sign.:)

And I must say that the experience of the film version of the last 40 chapters is considerably better than that of actually reading Gao E's (or whoever's) conclusion to the book, probably because the far inferior literary quality of the last 40 chapters is not as evident on the screen.  Readers seeking closure for their experience of the first 80 chapters may wish to explore this film version of the last 40 as an alternative to slogging through the continuation, especially as in the later episodes Li Shaohong relaxes her strict adherence to the text in a number of ways that actually improve the progression of the plot.  One scene, involving the consummation of the marriage, is particularly beautiful.

All in all, this version is a welcome, new attempt to present HLM to television audiences.  While problems with the acting mar much of the core plot in the Garden, there is much to admire in the director's often successful efforts to bring the world of HLM to life.  Hopefully future versions will maintain the same high standards of textual fidelity and keen directorial sensibility, while improving on the acting to finally do this novel justice on the big screen.",1410566400,,5115,4.967213114754099
