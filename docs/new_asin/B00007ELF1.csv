1807908,5,B00007ELF1,"This film, by far, is one of my favorite Robert Duvall films. I'm proud to own it on dvd and you should get it as well, if you don't have it already. It starts off a bit slow at first, but then it kicks in and never lets up! Also starring Farrah Fawcett and Billy Bob Thornton. One of the best.",1078272000,4,294,3.8360655737704916
1807909,5,B00007ELF1,"""The Apostle"" staring Robert Duvall is a film that you will remember long after your viewing. The story of Preacher ""Sonny"" Dewey is one man's quest to live for the God he loves and his
fight with his own sinful nature and those he loves.
When Sonny's wife is caught in infidelity, Sonny commits a crime of passion and the story takes you with him as he battles for
his redemption.  My heart broke for this man many times in this great movie as his pain and suffering were so greatly crafted
upon the screen that they etched their way into your heart.
This is a movie that will leave you deep in thought and will
have you searching your own soul concerning your own redemption.
Well worth your time!",1063756800,3,699,4.376923076923077
1807910,5,B00007ELF1,This movie is very good. Robert Duvall did a great job directing and acting. This is a great depiction of how fragile a person's faith is in bad circumstances. A very good heart felt film!!,1055808000,3,189,4.428571428571429
1807911,1,B00007ELF1,"I seem to be in the minority, but I did not like this movie at all.  ""The Apostle"" is just a showcase for Robert Duvall to rant and rave and run around.  The main character is suppose to be complex, but Duvall doesn't really take the time to go into details to show us this.  Sonny's own church votes him out, but Duvall never shows us why, we just see Sonny feeling sorry for himself.  I think we are suppose to feel sympathy for Sonny, but the man is an abusive husband. This is shown in the way his wife flinches every time he moves toward her in the scene in their living room when they are discussing their marriage.  It is also shown in the way he grabs her by her hair and drags her off the ballfield.  He picks up a baseball bat and kills a man and the only thought he gives it is, ""Uh oh, I'm in trouble.""  He runs off and starts a new church so that he will have a stage for his performance.  A ""new love"" in his life was mentioned by one reviewer.  His only interest in her is to see what he can get from her.  He tries to manipulate her and force himself on her.  He never shows any real concern for her at all.  Sonny is a man obsessed with himself.  He doesn't learn anything on his so called journey for redemption.  He never shows any remorse.  He never accepts responsibiliy for his actions. And when the law finally does catch up with him, Sonny sees it as Satan coming for him.  The move was way too long, and actually kind of boring.  Don't bother.",1051315200,11,1468,4.076923076923077
1807912,5,B00007ELF1,"...Christianity.  Many Christians I know despise this film. I think it's mainly because The Apostle shows the bitter truth behind the men and women who serve God. This film is not apologetic or remotely reverent; it is brutally honest and actually, when considered closely, quite refreshing.
  Rovert Duvall, in a role that was destined for him, plays the part of a eccentric preacher who is running from his problems. His problems, and there are many, force him to leave his mega-church and flee from police. His actions - which I won't spoil - are shocking but somewhat justifiable.
When out of town, the Apostle begins a multi-racial church in the deep south, cutting cross dividing lines while vigorously regaining his passion for the Lord. In it is in these moments, when he confronts his own lusts and fears, that the character of the Apostle shines through in honest, heart-bursting segments. He is a broken man, but still a man of God, just as many of the men and women of the Bible are. Bruised, battered, yet still willing. That's what I loved about this film. It is a true depiction of people who follow Jesus. We have misgivings, tempers, pride and lusts, yet, when it's all said and done, we can still move on.
There is one segment, when a racist bigot - played handsomely by Billy Bob Thorton -threatens to tear down the mult-racial church. The scene ends with Thorton's exclusionary character on his knees in deep remorse and weeping for forgiveness. It's a beautiful thing to behold.
This film is ruggedly honest and will make the pious and self-righteous crowd cringe with prudent dissaproval. But hey, those of you who are in touch with reality will probably love this film.  I'm a preacher's kid and I know an honest attempt when I see one. This is it. Enjoy!",1045180800,116,1778,4.725806451612903

If you've never seen it, do not hesitate to add it to your library.  Supporting actors are also extremely gifted and suited to their respective parts.  Farrah Fawcett truly astonished me with her acting - - she does not play her usual glamorous part, and her acting ability is certainly showcased in this marvelous film.  Of course, Billy Bob Thornton is also amazing.  Being born and raised in the deep South, I've actually known preachers like the apostle.  I would surely give an academy award to both Duvall and Fawcett.  It's the movie you will watch time and time again.",1464480000,5,694,4.540322580645161

 At first, I was afraid the movie would make the Church look like a bunch of nuts and hypocrits, you know 'Hollywood', but he showed the Church with all its eccentricities and flaws as completely loveable.  I mean, I think Duvall understands that Jesus came to redeem people, not just lie and say they are all perfect when He and they know we are not!

He found some really great people for major and supporting roles who came off as real - one had to just love them all, and he captured the flavor of that part of the country.  It was a wonderful experience.",1426204800,2,718,4.197080291970803

Being a notable television evangelist, he was chosen to coach Robert Duvall for this role and they became good friends. He was just like this in real life and was known in his hometown  as ""the happy pastor"".

1808110,5,B00007ELF1,"In this film, Robert Duvall plays a character that in real life I would walk across town to avoid. I would prefer to have lived in Afghanistan under the Taliban than in the communities depicted herein. I say this to clarify that I came to this film with a great deal of disgust and hostility toward the subject matter.

So it's to Duvall's credit that his presentation appealed to me in its honesty and complexity. ""Sonny"" is not an angel, but neither is he a psychotic religious fanatic as several other recent films and television shows have employed as a cheap villain. Through his many shortcomings, including murderous rage, Sonny is always, and sincerely, trying to do better, and trying to help those around him do better. Of course his faith is simplistic and absolutist - his personality requires simple and absolute rules to keep his rage under control. One can only imagine what he would have been like without the modifying influence of religion; probably a hitman or a mob enforcer. His struggle makes him sympathetic, no mean feat for someone like myself who finds people like Sonny repugnant.

Altogether a remarkable and genuinely affectionate achievement, and Duvall's most impressive role so far.",1403222400,,1214,4.946078431372549

1808115,5,B00007ELF1,"I know lots of people that didn't like this movie because Robert Duval's character - the Apostle E.F. - has some flaws. That's one reason I like the movie. E.F. comes with the whole package - the desire to serve God with all his heart, and depiction of the character with all his warts. Can't we see ourselves in this - sinners saved by grace? It's real.

It's also real because a lot of the actors/actresses are local church people just being themselves. That gives the movie an authenticity not seen or felt in other movies. The scene where Sammy gets saved is the closest to the real thing since Eric Estrada played Nicky Cruz in ""The Cross And The Switchblade.""

And the conclusion isn't all sweetness and light. I won't spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen this movie, but I just love the fact that he never, ever gave up. This is a lesson for all of us, shown rather than told. Never, ever let your dream die. There's always one more chance in God.

Duval paid for this film out of his own pocket, that's how much he believed in it. That gives it believability for the viewer.

How refreshing it was to see a man with high ideals and with low places in his own soul. Perfection is the goal, to be sure, but let's not pull the wool over our eyes so we can't see the plank there. Thank you, Robert Duval, for telling it like it is.",1395360000,3,1334,4.260869565217392

Robert Duvall lights the screen on fire as Apostle E.F. and is a metaphor for the human condition that is always in constant flux and chaos. At every single moment we are being pulled between choosing to do right and wrong, to hate or to love, to destroy or to be kind to.

This film shows one man who sinks to the depths of human behavior but then finds the strength and will and channels it through Christianity to rise above and choose to be a decent human being. We all have different ways of finding strength and using that strength to do good whether it be through religion, spirituality, being inspired by our parents, role models, friends, etc or just the simple, human desire to be a better person based on empathy and survival.

At it's core the Apostle is a story of redemption, which is a universal story, and this is one of the finest stories about redemption you can hope to experience.

1808140,1,B00007ELF1,"I suppose I could give it more stars for the sake of it's technical merits and acting but then I would feel guilty lending something like approval to it's representation of Believers in Christ.  But I saw nothing in the film worthy of the truth in Christ.  What I saw was a representation of a gospel aimed at sensual gratification in the name of the Lord.  A gospel that avoided entirely any exploration of the spiritual message of the Bible!  Although I am not surprised really that people loved this movie, it does however sadden me greatly that so many actually see an ""honest"" representation of the gospel! Because all I saw was a slice of some of the very worst of Christendom!  Sensual gratification without confronting the truth which is that a person can not do ANYTHING to obtain the mercy of God except that a person might be humbled by God to plead for mercy and might be humbled to seek Him with a broken a heart and might by the sovereign will of God be granted wisdom and knowledge of the truth in the The Lord Jesus Christ according to the Bible ALONE and in it's entirety.  But that is not something given to showing in movies I think  Understanding that I really don't know why I bothered to watch it even...I don't know what I thought might come of it and it made me curious what on earth they could come up with so far as showing the viewers some interesting perspective.  All I saw was a bunch of deceived people encouraging themselves amongst themselves that they had things right and the profile of one more sinful man at a loss to make sense of his faith and Hypocrisy while seeming to force it on God as good enough as in ""this is what I believe Lord, it is right and thank you that it is right"" Is that humility?  Is it not only pride?  Can we have any confidence in our best thinking?  Or at the end end of day is not vanity?  But what do I know? Let God be true and every man a liar.  Trust in the Lord with all thine heart and lean NOT on thine own understanding.  Lord I believe, help thou my unbelief.  In sack cloth and ashes I beat my own chest and beg ""Lord have mercy on me a sinner""  My hope lies only in the mercy of God the Father through the finished work of the Lord Jesus Christ ...I stand or I fall according to His perfect will.",1376956800,,2271,4.210161662817552

But we get it done, don't we?'

1808156,5,B00007ELF1,"""The Apostle"" (1997) is a film that I've appreciated more as I've gotten older. Writer/director Robert Duvall had to make it independently because studios didn't want to touch the material. The story's a character study of a Southern Pentecostal preacher, Sonny (Duvall), whose wife wants to leave him due to his infidelities (Farrah Fawcett). She now has a relationship with the youth minister and they're taking over the mega-church in the Dallas suburbs. Sonny reacts foolishly and is forced into exile. He changes his name and goes into the backwaters of Louisiana to eventually start a rural church that attracts the poor. Wherever Sonny goes, he can't seem to part with his ""calling"" and ""anointing"" -- to lead people to the LORD and motivate believers.

If you can't handle Pentecostalism and all that goes with it -- hyper praise & worship, charismatic gifts, evangelism and prayer -- I suggest staying far away from ""The Apostle."" I also suggest you stay away if you're not into seeing deptictions of Southern poverty or nigh-poverty since large portions of the film take place in this environment.

Duvall's idea was to do a modern take on the King David tragedy -- a man of God who falls into adultery and, then, possibly murder, albeit unintentional. Even so, Duvall stated in a 2010 interview that Sonny's sins aren't half as bad as David's since there's a huge difference between involutary manslaughter and outright (indirect) murder.

""The Apostle"" is the greatest kind of character study because it evokes strong opinions and discussions. Is Sonny a genuine but seriously flawed minister or just a phony who doesn't know it? Put another way, can a Christian be a ""man (or woman) after God's own heart"" and still commit serious sins? Does Sonny legitimately repent or does he evade repentance? Is the theology presented in the film shallow or heavy? Is resorting to righteous anger or corporeal punishment sometimes appropriate for the New Testamen believer or should Christians always be lovey-dovey doormats?

FINAL WORD: There's nothing like ""The Apostle"" in cinema. It's truly a unique film and it gets better with repeat viewings because a lot of what is conveyed is subtle and wordless. There's just the right amount of ambiguity that keeps the viewer guessing and the movie open to interpretation.

1808165,5,B00007ELF1,"Duvall's work, The Apostle, was an art vision love child of his for decades.  He first got the vision to write, produce, direct and star in this story from a church visit on a research trip to the south, to a little town and church in Hughes, Arkansas in the 60s.  The 1998 work, The Apostle (Robert Duvall, Farrah Fawcett, Billy Bob Thornton) is similar to his 2011 Get Low, also a story which takes place in the south. He told Christianity Today in a interview in the summer of 2010 that The Apostle was a piece of Americana that Hollywood would never be able to tell without making fun of the Pentecostal and Holiness faith practice of the southern states.

In my faith practice, preparation and contemplation of death--finishing well--is something you do from your Baptism forward.  Duvall gets this, states his faith in what he brings to both Felix Bush which he plays in Get Low, and Sonny, who he plays here in The Apostle, a flawed but passionate preacher on his road with God.  Both are well written and are neither feel good or feel bad flicks.  But they will get you thinking.  These are not films you soon put out of your mind.

The old cliche from WWII is that no atheist can be found in a foxhole.  Duvall is now 82 years old and his foxhole is closing in no doubt.  Yet he has three film projects he's working on.  Got to love that.  Facing age, mortality, death; yet all full of life.  My kind of man. I've liked the heart and soul Duvall brings to his characters ever since he played Gus McCrae in Lonesome Dove, a role he says remains his career favorite.  He puts his faith in his work and yet does not look for a ""message"" to portray.

I loved the part where he wakes the neighborhood praying angrily to God while living with his mom,estranged from his wife and kids.  And where his mom, played by June Carter Cash a few years before her death, takes a phone call from a perturbed neighbor, asking her son to pray more quietly.  Wonderful stuff.  I also loved a warm ecumenical moment I found dear in a place in The Apostle where Duvall's character looks at a Catholic priest up river, blessing a small flotilla of boats with holy water as they make their way down in a church ceremony.  In reference to the priest, Sonny is a bit amused at the shaking of holy water on the people, which he finds odd.  Yet he says out loud to himself as a prayer, ""You get it done your way.  I get it done mine.""  Several pithy lines like that make for a wonderful screen play and writing by Duvall, a man who obviously walks with God.

Another favorite scene that says a lot about the writer/director/producer/main actor: when Sonny does a Protestant version of Last Rights for a dying man in a car accident by the side of the road.  Amazing, especially the part where he gently boots the cop away behind him while staying focused on finishing his pastoral prayer for the boy on the edge of eternity before his eyes.  And the cop seem to understand, boot and all.

Finish well.  It's important.  Work toward this goal in the best humanity you can muster.  This seems to be what both these movies--The Apostle and Get Low--are saying without directly trying to saying anything; which I liked as much as the movie.

I'll not soon forget this flick.  I didn't expect to like it as I'm not warm to the theology of the Pentecostal South.  But specific theology is not the point of these films.  Five stars from me here for The Apostle.",1331251200,,3435,4.393026941362916
1808166,5,B00007ELF1,"Robert Duvall is my all time favorite actor and this is his masterwork.  He wrote it, directed it, financed it, produced it and starred in it and it's damn near perfect.  He doesn't make Sonny Dewey out to be anything other than an imperfect man who has an unflinching, unfailing belief in God and whose appetites often get the best of him.

The movie doesn't advocate faith or denigrate it.  All it does is give faith and those people who have it respect and tells a story that is rooted in a person of total faith.  He faith is so total that he literally gives up his current life and all of his possessions to walk randomly believing that God will put him where He wants him to be.  Oh, and he's also running from the law.

See what Duvall does there?  The atheist will say he's just running from the law and using the ""God-thing"" as an excuse to get away from the cops.  The devout Christian will say he's showing true faith by putting his life in God's hands and totally trusting Him.  Who's right?  Depends on your point of view, but Duvall will never judge either viewpoint.  He just created a fascinating character and inside of a fascinating sub-culture that is rarely viewed dispassionately.  The Revivalist sub-culture is often caricatured as either as superstitious, uneducated idiots or sacred warriors whose work cannot be criticized, but Duvall just treats it, and the people in it with respect.  Yes, it's clear he has an affinity for many of the people in it, but he also shows some of the dirty sides of them as well.

The part that fascinates me the most about the movie is the use of non-actors in many of the roles.  The film is completely set in a charismatic, Pentecostal, revivalist sub-culture and he uses actual members of that culture to provide an authentic look and feel.  He then inserts a handful of phenomenal actors (Duvall himself, Billy Bob Thornton, Miranda Richardson, Walton Goggins) and goes to town.

The result is a damn near perfect movie.  Watch it.  Enjoy it.  I have, many times.",1327622400,4,2024,4.582172701949861
1808167,5,B00007ELF1,"Written and directed by Robert Duvall as ""Sonny,"" a gifted Southern Preacher who goes bad as a result of murdering one of his wife's lovers and church rivals. This very much under-rated film is a devastatingly honest biopic of the unacknowledged dark side of small town Southern Christian church life.

It is the story of Sonny's redemption as he is on the run as a fugitive from murder through the back roads and swamps of Louisiana.  A gifted ""Snake oil Salesman"" of the Southern Baptist ministerial persuasion, Sonny is a ""Jack of all trades"" kind of man -- but especially the trades of seducing women, preaching and building churches - and in that order.

Against his own worse self-destructive instincts, he succeeds in rebuilding a church along the back roads of the Louisiana Bayou in a place called Bay Boutte. There he finds peace, a humble and fulfilled life, where he redeems himself in the eyes of god even if not in the eyes of the law.

Billy bob Thornton as always knows this environment like the back of his hands and brings this picture alive in ways that no other actor could. Thornton's genius is as under-rated as is this movie. It was Duvall's debut as a director. Too bad there have been no more like this one since 1999. There are just too few honest films. Five Stars",1327363200,2,1291,4.6

Duvall's character E.F., a supposed preacher, goes around the whole movie having to say 'Jesus' and 'God' in ever sentence, and constantly quoting from the bible, and then kills a man, abuses his wife, and other very non-Christian activities. After a while, it just becomes painful to watch, and E.F. just becomes a joke- I just started laughing at a lot of the movie and how ridiculous it became. I will say that at least this is probably one of the more realistic portrayals of a religious fanatic I've seen- the typical 'Do as I say, not as I do' type of Christian you see on the news every night. I am so sick and tired of seeing these kind of nut jobs in the world who think everyone should live the way THEY believe.

DuVall was nominated for an Academy Award for this film and was robbed.  He is absolutely brilliant as the charismatic evangelist Sonny.  If you have never been inside a fundamentalist church, this movie could be an eyewitness account.  DuVall is spot-on in his speech and mannerisms as are all of his followers.

There is so much to like about this movie. It is visually stark, mirroring the doubt and confusion in Sonny's heart.  Although he has committed murder, he still believes that he has been called by God to save others, thinking that it is the key to his own salvation. There are plenty of twists and turns in the plot. When you think that Sonny is turning his life around, he reveals the darkness in his soul when he pursues a woman out of his own base desires and weakness. His charisma masks his manipulative deceit, and even to the end of the movie you believe that his parishioners would gladly follow him to the gates of hell.

The movie has an amazing cast of actors: June Carter Cash as Sonny's mother (who has one of the best scenes in the movie); Farrah Fawcett as his estranged wife; and Billy Bob Thornton as the unbeliever who challenges Sonny and is ultimately ""redeemed"".

Even if you are not a Christian, you should see this movie if only to gain an appreciation for what really goes on inside the movement.  You will not be disappointed.",1322611200,3,1430,4.533073929961089

1808182,5,B00007ELF1,"Robert Duvall certainly knows how to write an outstanding screenplay. ""The Apostle""'s tells us almost nothing about what's going on in the characters' minds. It's left to the actors to show us -- a chunk of acting meat any good actor would leap at. (Acting is about embodying the character, not reading the lines.) This necessarily leaves the film open for interpretation. Here's my perspective.

Though Euliss ""Sonny"" Dewey might honestly feel he has a calling from God, he too-often sees things in terms of how they relate to him and his interests, not God. This is apparent in continually referring to the churches he founds as ""his"" churches. When he takes Toosie (Miranda Richardson) out for dinner, his pre-meal grace includes a self-serving thank-you to The Big Fella for ""the spiritual companionship of a good man and a good woman"". Whether Sonny intends to get her into bed isn't clear, but he obviously doesn't understand Jesus's response to the man who called him ""good Master"" -- ""Why callest thou me 'good'?""

Indeed, like most self-professed ""Christians"", Sonny understands almost nothing about his religion. When Reverend Blackwell tells Sonny that he's experienced two heart attacks while preaching, the issue of why a loving God would so punish a person who was doing His will never comes up. That it makes no sense doesn't seem to cross either's mind.

Sonny is as much a fake as Elmer Gantry -- he just doesn't know it. The ""Christianity"" he preaches is a lot of noise, failing to convey the practical Christianity Jesus taught and practiced. Sunny's protracted sermon at the end has been criticized as overly long, but its /empty/ length makes clear that Sonny has nothing useful to say. He's little more than a religious entertainer who knows how to please his audience.

The characters talk about the Devil making them sin, and God always placing them where they need to be. This effectively denies /any/ responsibility for their behavior. Significantly, there is /no/ point in this film where Sonny explicitly or even implicitly takes responsibility for his actions. It's as if his murdering a man was part of God's Plan for his life, and thus implicitly forgiven. He is never redeemed, because there is no /need/ for redemption. When the police take him away, he asks a pointless question about why they're driving Chevys when most police departments have switched to Fords. ""Oh, well, I'm always sayin' /something/..."" Whether divinely inspired or not -- mostly the latter.

""The Apostle"" /is not/ a sympathetic portrayal of pentecostal ministers. It is a brilliantly subtle attack on the cheap, theatrical religion they preach. Sonny is likable enough, and often does good -- but when push comes to shove, he breaks the rules of his religion, then makes excuses that appeal to a human sense of how things are or should be. He does not follow in Jesus's footsteps.

Though mostly dead-serious, there are several comic scenes, including Sonny's mother (June Carter Cash) pretending to have a seizure. Another is Duvall dragging a geezer alky out of a bar and encouraging him to quit drinking. The last scene reminds me of the last scene of ""The Producers"". (!!!) Max and Leo are selling shares for their new production to the prisoners, and Sonny is doing much the same with his fellow criminals on his work detail -- he's got them participating in a call-and-response.

Regardless of how you interpret ""The Apostle"", it's a great film, with one of the finest performances you will ever see at its center. Robert Duvall is arguably the greatest actor this country has yet produced, and unquestionably one of the greatest actors of all time. Watching him act is like watching Fred Astaire dance, or listening to Mozart's music. The LV's liner notes call him ""the consummate actor -- regarded as peerless by his peers"". It is difficult to argue this (though Marlon Brando and Ned Beatty come close).

1808184,4,B00007ELF1,"Sonny Dewey (Robert Duvall) is the charismatic preacher of a fundamentalist Texas church, until his short temper gets him in serious trouble.  He runs off to Louisiana, becomes part of a small community, and starts a new church where he brings hope and salvation to his loyal followers.

Robert Duvall is a powerhouse; he wrote, directed, produced, and starred in this movie - and it's wonderful.  He is so convincing as the southern evangelist that it really surprised me to hear him speak in his normal voice in the Extras.  Sonny is completely devoted to saving people and spreading the Word, but we suspect he may have a violent and unsavory past, and that dichotomy keeps our eyes glued to Duvall at all times.  As Sonny, he's driven, tireless, and simply inspired.

While Duvall gets excellent performances out of many local, non-actors in small parts, there were several casting choices that didn't seem right to me:  Farrah Fawcett plays Sonny's wife and she's so recognizable as a former ""Angel"" and glamour girl that it was hard to buy her as a quiet, plain-Jane.  June Carter Cash plays Sonny's mother although she is only two years older than Duvall - and looks it and that was distracting.  And Billy Bob Thornton has a very small role as a troublemaker that was never developed; I kept expecting him to show up again and do something important and worthy of his stature.

The term ""tour de force"" can certainly be applied to Duvall's performance; he is riveting, charismatic, and utterly believable.  Interestingly, the story makes him neither a hero nor a villain; it is left up to the viewer to decide who exactly ""the Apostle"" is. Highly recommended.",1306281600,,1667,4.814035087719298

So when I view a movie I am interested not only in being entertained, I am interested in the movie as an art form, & in the writing, acting & directing of the movie as well. Since I became a born-again Christian at the age of 34, & was subsequently called by God into ministry, street evangelism & missionary work especially, I was interested in this film from that standpoint also. God has moved me around a great deal & had me involved with different Christian denominations and Catholics. I am also very well acquainted with Pentecostalism as portrayed in this film. Duvall did such a good job in the all the aspects of this film - writing, acting, directing - that the result is as if cameramen followed a Pentecostal preacher around recording his daily activities.

I had been avoiding it, to be honest. I assumed it was a film which was making a mockery of Christianity. However, I was very, very wrong.

""The Apostle"" is one of the the best films I have seen. When I started watching it, I thought I might be disappointed. I was not. I have enjoyed the other films I have seen Robert Duvall in, but this was his best performance of all. He brilliantly captured the part of the the charismatic, Southern preacher. I have seen preachers like that in person, and there were times we felt were in church, or seeing them on television. We had to remember we were watching a movie.

The thing about this film that appeals to me most is how Sonny is a man who really loves the Lord. However, he is not perfect, nor does he pretend to be. So many of we Christians can be so arrogant, thinking we are above everyone else, it is an annoying turn-off. He has cheated on his wife, and kills her lover by beating him with a baseball bat in a fit of anger. He is kicked out of his church. He even lashes out at God when his wife leaves him. It is a very realistic portrayal of a man who has deeply rooted issues, yet at the same time, he is still a Christian. It shows you do not have to be perfect to serve God, and to love Him. This movie does not belittle or disrespect Christianity. It makes it real and honest.

After Sonny's attack on his wife's lover, he flees to a small town in Louisiana, where he decides to start his life over. He baptizes himself again, declares himself an apostle, and takes on the name ""The Apostle E.F."" He founds a new church, which starts off very small, then quickly grows into a larger, racially-diverse congregation. It is a close-knit group. Unfortunately, Sonny's ex-wife hears him on the radio, and contacts the local authorities. One night, after a touching, uplifting sermon, he is arrested for murder. He embraces some of the members, as they sing. He then walks out of the church, and surrenders to the police, relinquishing his jewelry to be sold for the benefit of the church. In prison, he is still preaching the gospel, and influencing the other inmates.

The rest of the cast includes Farrah Fawcett, as Sonny's ex-wife Jessie, June Carter-Cash as Sonny's mother, John Beasley as Brother C. Charles Blackwell, the man he builds his new church with, and Billy Bob Thornton as a racist troublemaker who initially comes to the church to start trouble, but is converted by Sonny in the end.

1808215,5,B00007ELF1,"Although I have mixed emotions about this film, which created quite a stir when it came out, I have always enjoyed watching it and find it utterly fascinating.

This is a powerful story of a very flawed-but very sincere Pentecostal preacher from Texas who flees after fatally slugging his adulterous wife's lover with a baseball bat! As it turns out. ""Sonny"" (Robert Duvall), winds up starting a rural church from scratch in a small town in Louisiana, and, what happens after that I won't say, but it's interestng.

Duvall gives a tremendous acting performance in here, one of the best I've seen on film. He dominates the picture from start-to-finish. There are some good messages in here, too.

By the why, I don't know ANY minister (or priest) who would do all the bad things you see in this movie,  including his wife and youth minister, but it makes for a good story, film-wise.  To those anti-church readers out there, I'm sorry but this is not the way it is, by any means.

Yet, despite all that, this is not your typical anti-Christian film ,which is why no major studio would fund this movie. Duvall had to put his own money into this. Hollywood didn't want to back a film in which ""people being saved"" means a great deal. There even s a dramatic conversion scene with Billy Bob Thornton, of all people! Hey, with God all things are possible.

The more I watch this movie, the more I appreciate the cinematography in here. I enjoyed the music, too. This is a strange film full of ""good"" and ""bad"" people and their actions and a movie, I suspect, people would either love or hate. I loved it and now would like to see it on Blu-Ray some day.",1232236800,4,1648,4.510067114093959
1808216,5,B00007ELF1,"It's an amazing movie, one that Robert Duvall acknowledges as a career peak in the accompanying documentary. It's amazing on so many levels that when the long road to financing the film is revealed (Duvall made it on his own dime), you want to look toward Hollywood and ask ""What were you THINKING?"" He reveals that his award for ""Tender Mercies"" made him think that a window of opportunity might open. However, ""The Apostle"" was to remain in Duvall's ""theater of the mind"" for a few years longer.

The casting is perfect. Walton ""Shane Vendrell"" Goggins (The Shield) really stands out as Sammy. Duvall discusses Sammy's ""born again"" scene, saying that Goggin's whole body was shaking as he knelt...it was as if he were actually witnessing a man being born again. Fans of The Shield and its DVD commentaries know that Goggins is the ultimate method actor, isolating himself prior to scenes being filmed, psyching himself up one thousand percent for the performance. He does not disappoint here. He tackles the role of a simple man with a good heart whose life is transformed after encountering a complex man with a stain on his soul (Apostle E.F.).

John Beasley's performance as ""Reverend Blackwell"" provides a reason to watch the movie all by itself. Sometimes in life we feel that we've given it all, it's time to rest, and the best is behind us. Then we are called to bring about something bigger than we'd ever imagined. That's Reverend Blackwell's fate, and he plays against Apostle E.F. magnificently.

Miranda Richardson as Toosie, the love interest...after Duvall's crime of passion, he attempts to rebuild his life, brick by brick. At one point he tells Toosie (who is separated from her husband) that all he needs is to hold someone who wants to be held. That's his agenda, not hers. She is there when the curtain comes down, but Apostle E.F. ultimately learns that redemption never comes before repentance.

Farrah Fawcett manages the impossible...viewers can sympathize with her marriage to a complex, troubled, controlling man like Apostle E.F. while having mixed feelings about her affair with the youth pastor. There is one chilling scene in which Fawcett, off-camera and in a voice-over, surveys the damage in her marriage (and beyond). She's an anti-hero...flawed, but in a manner that differs from her husband. Two flawed people in a doomed marriage, which sets up the underlying conflict that drives the story.

As if that weren't enough, the late June Carter Cash (as the Apostle's mother) delivers an elegantly understated yet powerful performance. Her presence is fitting as the hymns she sings throughout add to a powerful, masterfully assembled soundtrack.

Note to Robert Duvall: You financed the movie out of your own pocket, and it was worth every penny. Your audience is in your debt.",1228953600,5,2813,4.9872068230277184
1808217,4,B00007ELF1,"This portrayal of a pentecostal preacher is the most realistic I've seen; others have capsuled it, so I won't here. Duvall plays Sonny (the preacher) with such humanness that you can't walk away loving or hating him - or if you can, it'll be both. I could never tell if Sonny was a genuinely God-touched person, or a gifted man making a place for himself in the world through preaching. No single incident in the story played it one way or another. He unquestionably had a gift in bringing people together, giving them purpose and redemption. But he also did some bad things, including (but not the worst), hiding the truth of what he'd done from his congregation. This piece was shown through the character of a young mechanic who overheard Sonny's story as he told it to another preacher, to fairly devastating effect. Every actor's portrayal was great, Duvall's most of all. It asks questions - what does it mean to be human, to suffer, to want, to hurt others, to be well, to be loved, to be in community? And how does God and the church play a role in all this... and do they? A great movie well worth watching.",1227571200,7,1116,4.502463054187192

At the beginning, I honestly thought those were his GRANDCHILDREN and June Carter Cash was his wife. (Alot of Southern men call their wives ""Momma"": annoying but true). Duvall plays a VERY VERY flawed haracter.  Several reviewers would have you believe that he is somehow ""redeemed"" at the end. Really? Because he so-called saves Billy Bob Thorntons character and that other young man? Give me a break! Speaking of BBT, he gives an extremely wooden performance, even worse than the too low-key Farrah.  The preaching throughout this movie can be spellbinding but the last sermon Duvalls character gives is way too long and how come no one in the congregation notices or seems to care that the cops are there?

1808220,5,B00007ELF1,"Robert Duvall is without exception one of the best actors in this period, in my opinion.  The Apostle is a movie about a man who, as a young boy, experiences highly charged evangelistic preaching, and in turn, becomes an evangelist.  His Mother is his biggest supporter in his ventures.  Even though he truly believes in Jesus and is a Christian, he commits unforgiveable sins, and is fully knowledgeable about what he has done, so he escapes from the place where the crime was committed, and, with very little money, strikes out to begin a new life.  He only gives people his initials, and calls himself the Apostle.  He manages to obtain a small church, and many willing workers to help him renovate it.  He eventually draws a large crowd of followers, mostly African Americans.  You almost hope he can go through life preaching to this simple group, but his past overtakes him and he soon has to pay the price for his crimes.  this is a mesmerizing story, thanks to Duvall, and you will be totally captured by his phenomenal portrayal of the Apostle.",1214265600,,1053,4.684782608695652

1808222,5,B00007ELF1,"...and I say that as a Buddhist.

I both live and work in Hollywood, and this must have been a very tough picture for Robert Duvall to get made.  ""The Industry"" tends to treat religious faith with contempt and ridicule -- Hollywood can't believe there are people who actually place their faith in anything besides fame and money.  Religious people end up being treated in film as either comically delusional or slick confidence artists.  Hollywood lives in a cultural bubble of its own making and just can't understand any other set of values.

In contrast, this film really reflects the Pentacostal communities of Texas and Louisiana, and does so without looking down at the people who live there.  How refreshing.  I'd be very curious to know how this movie works for people in the UK or other countries.

This is one of my favorite movies - I have seen it several times.
I really admire Robert Duvall for working to make this picture a reality.  The character he plays is a three-dimensional, flawed human being who is ""on fire for the Lord"".  He'll minister to anybody, anywhere.  And he's most at home with a shoutin' congregation in a shoutin' church.

Jack Nicholson won the Oscar for Best Actor in 1997 (""As Good as it Gets""), and I think Duvall got robbed. R-O-B-B-E-D. Robbed.

1808224,5,B00007ELF1,"If ever there was a movie that relied so much on a single performance to reach greatness it is this movie.  Seriously, `The Apostle' could have easily gone camp had Robert Duvall's performance been off key.  Well we can all praise Jesus (ha) that Robert Duvall invested his heart and soul into this amazingly spirited performance.  As Sonny he completely becomes absorbed into this man, into this role of his career and delivers a brilliantly controlled and emotionally fleshed out performance.  This is coming from someone who has never really cared for Duvall and felt he was an overrated actor.  It's funny because my best friend idolizes him and swears up and down he's the greatest actor ever and I just never saw it, until last night, and now I get it, or at least now I realize that when he's good he's pretty darn perfect.

In `The Apostle' we meet Sonny, a charismatic somewhat obsessive Texas preacher who has all but driven his wife away due to his philandering ways.  We watch his life fall apart as his wife leaves him for another man, a youth minister, taking his children and eventually his church away from him.  In a fit of rage Sonny attacks his wife's lover with a baseball bat sending him into a coma and forcing Sonny to leave town.  Sonny winds up in Bayou Boutte, Louisiana, a small town that seems to soak up his eccentric style.  Claiming that the lord sent him, Sonny dons the persona of The Apostle E.F. and starts to build his church from the ground up, enlisting the help of a former minister in the area.  He begins to move forward with his life, corralling the community together for the lord's work, even going as far as to strike a relationship of sorts with a young woman in the town.  His past though cannot stay buried forever and as the condition of his wife's lover worsens the intensity to find and charge Sonny increases.

The supporting players here are all at the very least decent, but no one is really given the limelight aside from Duvall.  Farrah Fawcett does a fine job as Sonny's ex-wife and Billy Bob Thornton does an excellent job as a local troublemaker out to destroy Sonny's newfound church but neither of them is given more than a passing glance of screen time.  June Carter Cash is deliciously effective as Sonny's ailing mother and she does more in her few minutes of time than the whole of the supporting cast put together.  I was not as impressed with Miranda Richardson as critics appeared to have been, I felt she was a bit too childish in her performance, but then again maybe that's what she was going for.  I didn't like it.  John Beasley does a fine job as Blackwell, the minister who gives Sonny a helping hand, and Rick Dial and Walton Goggins are both well used as townsfolk immediately drawn to Sonny.

Really though, there is no actor here that deserves mention more than Robert Duvall.  His performance is downright perfection.  In fact, played any other way and this movie would have been a failure.  It would have been so easy for a film like this to become nothing more than a laugh riot, especially when you're subject matter is that of the bible thumping extremists, but Duvall is so serious, so devoted and so convincing that he manages to keep with the dramatic tones of the film and deliver to us a well constructed and effortlessly mesmerizing portrayal.  His performance won all kinds of critics awards and quite frankly should have won the Oscar.  `The Apostle' was truly a labor of love for the actor who also wrote, directed and even financed the film himself when no studio would greenlight it.  Sure he was reimbursed when the film took off but regardless, that shows devotion, and that devotion is what helped bring his performance to new life.

It shows a complicated man, played by Robert Duvall, who is not a perfect man, but who is in fact, well, he did something that's a felon, we'll say.  But here he is desperately trying to redeem himself and that of his small flock in a small town in Louisiana.  This is a really wonderful, sincere, and at times, spellbinding film, one that shows a much more nuanced, complex, and quite moving portrayal of the deep South, something that Hollywood never offers.  Films that show the complexities of faith really scare Hollywood and the left, as they dismiss anyone of the Chrisitian faith as a right winger hater.  While many calling themselves Christians (preachers of the ilk of Falwell and James Dobson) embrace the ""god hates fags and abortions"" line (and ignore everything else in the gospel), they do so simply to attain political power more than anything else, and have no real desire to help their fellow man spiritually.  Duvall's character here isn't like that at all.  He is a man who truly wants to be delivered and saved, and that makes a lot of people who dismiss faith very uncomfortable.  I really loved this film, as it makes you feel and think, an excellent combination.

This movie also crosses racial divides by showing the South as it truly is - honest and hardworking people that really do love one another regardless of race.

1808229,5,B00007ELF1,"I don't think I've ever seen a clearer portrayal of the charismatic psychopath than Robert Duvall playing the part of Euliss ""Sonny"" Dewey.  Do not think that psychopaths are mad-dog killers - only very few are and they could be considered ""unsuccessful"" psychopaths.

 Some people think that psychopathy is the result of some attachment or bonding difficulty as an infant but psychopathy expert, Dr. Robert Hare, has turned the idea around.  After all his years digging into the background of psychopaths. He says:

  ""In some children the very failure to bond is a symptom of psychopathy. It is likely that these children lack the capacity to bond readily, and that their lack of attachment is largely the result, not the cause, of psychopathy.""&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Without-Conscience-The-Disturbing-World-of-the-Psychopaths-Among-Us/dp/1572304510/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Without Conscience: The Disturbing World of the Psychopaths Among Us</a>

In other words: they are born that way and you can't fix them.

The differences in how psychopathy manifests does have to do with family background, however.  How one is raised determines how the psychopath expresses himself in life.

 A psychopath who grows up in a stable family and has access to positive social and educational resources might become a white-collar criminal, or perhaps a somewhat shady entrepreneur, preacher, politician, lawyer, judge, or other professional. Another individual with the same traits, and a deprived background might become a common con-artist, a drifter, mercenary, or violent criminal.

A psychopath born into a very religious background, having the early experiences with evangelism that are depicted in the movie, would very likely grow up to be exactly as Sonny is portrayed.

The point is, social factors and parenting practices only shape the expression of the disorder, but have no effect on the individual's inability to feel empathy or to develop a conscience.

All of these issues are depicted in this movie: Sonny is traveling most of the time and often cheats on his wife, but considers himself to be basically a ""good guy.""  His mother falls on the floor in a weak spell and he just walks out the door and says he'll see her in a few weeks. His barely controlled aggression against his wife when he discovers that she is cheating while he's on the road (also cheating, as he admits), and later when they discuss the break-up of their marriage, finally culminating in a violent break-out where he scares the bejeebies out of everybody by going berserk at a kid's softball game, inflicting a fatal injury on his wife's boyfriend, are all clues to the seething selfishness that drives Sonny.

Sonny also exhibits what psychopaths DO have that is truly outstanding: an ability to give their undivided attention to something that interests them intensely right now or in terms of setting up a situation where they have power and authority over others.  Some clinicians have compared this to the concentration with which a predator stalks his prey.  This quality is abundantly evident in Sonny's drive to preach, to ""have a church,"" and the work he is willing to put into acquiring that status.

The qualities of the psychopath are also on display in Sonny's talents as a preacher with a mastery of hypnotic techniques. Psychopaths are naturally interesting as all get out - even exciting! They exude a captivating energy that keeps their listeners on the edge of their seats (and they talk a LOT!). Even if some part of the normal person is shocked or repelled by what the psychopath says or does, they are like the mouse hypnotized by the torturing cat. Even if they have the chance to run away, they don't.  This is evident in the movie in Toosie's fascination for Sonny even though she is also repelled by him.

Many Psychopaths ""make their living"" by using charm, deceit, and manipulation to gain the confidence of their victims. You see that clearly when Sonny travels to Bayou Boutte and tells an out and out lie to Rev. Blackwell that ""God sent me to fellowship with you.""  The viewer knows that he learned about Rev. Blackwell from his cousin whom Sonny met while on the run from his criminally violent behavior. In fact, this scene is the dead giveaway that we are watching a psychopath in action.  With all his praying, self-baptizing, Bible reading and thumping, and assorted other self-righteous activities, Sonny sits there and tells a bald-faced lie to another minister and ascribes it to God. (Well, he probably convinced him that it WAS God, that this was how God directed him, but that's really stretching it.)

The fact is, many psychopaths can be found in white collar professions where they are aided in their evil by the fact that most people expect certain classes of people to be trustworthy because of their social or professional credentials. Preachers, lawyers, doctors, teachers, politicians, psychiatrists and psychologists, generally do not have to earn our trust because they have it by virtue of their positions. But the fact is: psychopaths are found in such lofty spheres also, and more often than most people suppose!

At the same time, psychopaths are good imposters. They have absolutely no hesitation about forging and brazenly using impressive credentials to adopt professional roles that bring prestige and power. They pick professions in which the requisite skills are easy to fake, the jargon is easy to learn, and the credentials are unlikely to be thoroughly checked. Psychopaths find it extremely easy to pose as financial consultants, ministers, psychological counselors and psychologists. It may even be due to the fact that the science of psychology is infested with psychopaths that truly helpful research on psychopathy is never funded despite the fact that psychopaths cause more damage to society than any other psychological problem.  This film is an example of that very sort of damage.  Multiplied millions of U.S. citizens are subjected to this kind of hypnosis/evangelism which twists and warps their minds.

 Another clue to the reality of Sonny Dewey is that psychopaths make their way by conning people into doing things for them; obtaining money for them, prestige, power, or even standing up for them when others try to expose them. That's what they do and they do it very well as Sonny demonstrates with just about everyone he comes in contact with. What's more, the job is very easy because most people are gullible with an unshakable belief in the inherent goodness of man.

Manipulation is the key to the psychopath's conquests. They will feign false emotions to create empathy, and many of them study the tricks that can be employed by the empathy technique. Psychopaths are often able to incite pity from people because they seem like ""lost souls"" as Guggenbuhl-Craig writes. So the pity factor is one reason why victims often fall for these ""poor"" people.

One of the chief ways psychopaths prey on others is to make use of the normal person's need to find meaning or purpose in life. They will pose as preachers, grief counselors, or ""experts"" of various sorts that attract followings of people who are looking for answers. They are masters of recognizing ""hang-ups"" and self-doubts that most people have, and they will brazenly pander to them to gain a follower to use later.

This is what Sonny was doing, and doing masterfully with the character played by Billy-Bob Thornton.

It is that kind of mind that we are dealing with when we consider such as Euliss ""Sonny"" Dewey and his ilk, and the millions upon millions of people that follow them and become their armies of hate in the guise of ""brotherly love.""

Definitely get this movie and watch it for the simple reason that you need to know about psychopaths, how they operate, and how to spot them and you need to teach it to your children.

Besides, it is a darn good movie and VERY well done!  I grew up in the deep South and I KNOW people like that; heck, I have some in my family! The film characterizations are brilliant and nothing is exaggerated; it could almost be a documentary!

As they say in ""The making of the Apostle"": Sometimes we didn't know if they were acting or it was real. I don't think there can be a more honest approach to the work of Christian evangelizers in American film history. Simply put, it's a great film, very emotional, very spiritual, and very human. Robert Duvall plays a Texas preacher whose wife cheats on him and fills for divorce. Then she even takes away his church from him (I didn't understand how that happened, though). The course of events sets him on a journey to meet his fate, which is no other than to continue giving out the Word in the holy name of Jesus.

Duvall plays an honest and true Christian preacher, but at the same time a very real man, with his own flaws and temptations. Eliminating the darker side of this man from the story, I think, wouldn't have paid a better tribute to truth, not would it have made a better film. The important thing that comes up here is the honesty (the reality) of Christian worship. There is no mockery of Christians. There is no intention to evangelize either. This is not a Christian film; it is a film about Christians, true Christians, spirit filled followers of Christ.

Even if non believers can't find anything here to move them closer to the Lord, at least they will have an insider's view of a Spirit filled church. So many people are put off by religion, but this is not about religion, as you see in liberal churches, this is the real Thing. All the characters are played superbly.

I believe this movie, while not painting a Pollyanna picture of Christianity, was still not anti-Christian enough to be politically correct and thus lost the award.  Duvall put out his own money to get this picture out.

From Tent Revivals to a Christian Men's Conference, the spirit of Pentocostalism comes across almost like a documentary at times. Almost reminiscent of the 1972 Academy Award winner ""Marjoe.""

 A remarkable study of an obviously sincere man, falling but attempting to start over anew by God's saving Grace. Yet in the end, as so many ""believers"" often forget, along with Grace comes God's Justice. A reminder that we are sinners saved By Grace, and still trying to walk daily in Christ's footsteps.

 A moving story of Christian struggles often forgotten by Hollywood. Who ever knew Robert Duvall was such a good preacher? An outstanding cast of players.",1158192000,4,1197,5.03030303030303
1808248,5,B00007ELF1,"After most movies I watch, I say to myself ""That was a pretty good movie"", and then I never think about them again........not this movie. Once you watch this one, you'll never forget it. I watched it about 5 years ago and it is still as clear as the day I watched it. As a conservative Christian, I do not subscribe at all to the pentecostal faith or their worship practices, but the portrayal of all these things in this movie is very realistic, regardless of how you view these matters.

As a movie, this is a brilliant work; as for the acting, Duvall's performance defies description. A quick scan of the reviews here will give you the picture.

This is undoubtedly one of those ""love it"" or ""hate it"" movies. As a movie, I loved it, but it probably has to be understood to be loved, otherwise it may completely miss you and you will find yourself scratching your head.

I have read some of the reviews and found a little of what I was afraid I would find, i.e. those attempting to either evaluate this as a ""Christian"" movie, or those using it to disparage Christianity. This is misguided. There is no attempt at Biblical teaching in this movie nor any attempt at a political message. This movie is portraying a man and his journey.

When the movie opens with the holiness service where they are all shouting and screaming Jesus' name, it nearly turned me off about the whole movie, and I am sure there were many who saw this and were tainted from that point on, I nearly was.  Again, however, this is probably a pretty realistic portrayal of the pentecostal holiness worship. In any event, this part is soon over and the movie really begins after that.

I was born in the ""north"" and still have much family that are Yankees, and I know pretty much what they believe and how they think. I have also lived in the south most of my life, part of this time in the deep south, and I have seen firsthand the differences in cultural beliefs and attitude between the two parts of our country. I have also seen the religious differences between the 2 as well. And frankly, as others have said, you must have some understanding of the local setting, including this particular aspect of the pentecostal religion before you can fully appreciate this movie and Duvall's character. For what it depicts, this movie is as real and accurate as it gets. Again, however, the Pentecostal religion is just the setting, not the main plot.

Duvall's performance is beyond words so I will not attempt to describe it, except to say that despite my comments about knowing the setting and understanding the culture in the movie, if you appreciate good movies and good performances, you shouldn't miss this.",1158192000,4,2683,4.5654885654885655
1808249,5,B00007ELF1,"One of the most beautifully written, most powerful movies I've ever had the joy to watch. Robert Duvall & the cast hit it right on the head with this film. It's hard to top this one. Watching it is worth every second of your time!",1154390400,5,230,4.133333333333334
1808250,5,B00007ELF1,"This is one of those films that gets better and better every time you watch it. It has so many layers of reality built into it that you really **need** to watch it more than once, just to pick-up all the subtleties. This is especially true if you're from the South and/or have had some exposure to Pentacostal evangelism. ~ I read somewhere that Robert Duvall wanted to get this story made into a movie for many years before he finally managed to find a studio that would accept it and do it the way he wanted it. I can't praise him enough for this effort - and the patience it required.  I don't want to give away the plot, but this movie is probably the best demonstration of the intricacies of human nature I have ever seen on film. Put simply, we see a preacher who makes a bad mistake in an unthinking moment early in the story but who is so driven by his faith and his calling to preach that he decides to keep following this calling anyway. As the story progresses, we also see that a preacher is just as human as we all are, with our similar quirks, weaknesses, and temptations, along with - sometimes - astounding strengths. The climax near the end of the story will tear your heart out; but the final scenes will put it right back where you want it to be. ~ Nothing I've written here can do justice to this wonderful film. Buy it - and watch it at least two or three times. Even if you're a pagan or an atheist, you'll still find much to enjoy and appreciate about this movie.

1808251,4,B00007ELF1,"As fine an acting performance as you will see anywhere.

Despite many rewrites, they did not get the screenplay quite right, as there is no subplot and an inadequate backstory.  But what remains is a thoroughly compelling portrayal of a morally ambiguous character, a fundamentalist preacher of extreme views and actions.

Watching the movie, you tend to think, OK, I get the point about the preaching, I see how charismatic he is, now let's move on.  Instead, there is more preaching.  Duvall seems so wrapped up in the performance that he is reluctant to let any plot developments interrupt the flow.  This makes it less of a movie than it could have been but, I say again, the performance is monumental and has to be seen.

As usual, Amazon divulge much of the plot in their editorial review, presumably to protect you from nasty surprises when you see the movie, and many reviewers here have repeated the favor, just to make sure.  I expect it's too late, but if you haven't read them yet, don't.  Just see the movie.",1148169600,,1021,4.659217877094972

I think Duvall really wanted to do justice to a character most people in Hollywood would stereotype as either crazy or perfect.

1808254,1,B00007ELF1,"I saw this movie because I hadn't seen a single movie Robert Duval was in that I didn't like, until now. WOW! If you can stay awake and you are very religious you might like it. I've got a strong religious background and I understood the underlying ideas behind this movie but this is on the top of my list as the worst movie I've ever seen. You could try to find something less intriguing but I doubt you'll find it. I watched this with my religious mother and my not-so-religious father and both agreed it was horrible. My mom left 3/4 of the way through and said she didn't care about seeing the rest, she did laundry instead. My dad and I had the best laugh at the end when we both looked at each other during the closing credits and asked simultaneously ""is it just me or was that the worst movie you've ever seen"". You may like it and to that I say good for you. If you question whether to buy this or not look at the cast. Farrah Fawcett? Was EVERY other ""actress"" in hollywood not available? To say she was awful is an insult to the word awful. The acting is so bad from EVERY character that I lost respect for Robert Duval. I believe he wrote and directed this movie. Sly Stallone wrote all the Rocky and Rambo movies and I'd rather sit through a 24 hour marathon of Rocky 5, another horribly acted movie, than TRY to watch this again. Like I said if you are very religious you may like it and you may be able to see through all of the bad acting, poor writing and the fact there appeared to be no director at all.

1808255,5,B00007ELF1,"I've done my time in rural Texas and in urban Texas too.  Tender Mercies, Duvall's brilliant film about a country western singer got it absolutely right.  And this film, The Apostle,,is bold, uncompromising and unforgettable in its portrayal of a minister who truly loves the Lord whom He serves, and will not give up his ministry and his vocation even when his own faults nearly destroy him.  This is a remarkable departure for ""Hollywood"" which so often presents evangelical and other conservative Christians in a cynical nasty light with shameless abandon.  The film affirms faith; it's complex; careful; fascinating, and completely gripping.  All performances are terrific, and Duvall of course is The Apostle through and through.  This film brought me closer to God, and closer to commitment to God.  It's also a film that non-believers will find entertaining and beautiful because it is so well done.

1808257,5,B00007ELF1,"I had seen this twice in the theaters when it first came out. i loved it then and I loved  it now. Duval weighs in with one of the most riveting performances of any actor in years. I can't recall who won the Oscar that year but the performance that won could not have been any better than Duval. And as a director he coached great acting from the supporting actors, including the amateurs who played many of the smaller parts. The radio station owner notbably is memorable, as are some of the Bible thumpers in church. The two black women who don't really like each other--both amateurs, and wonderful performances. No matter what your inclinations are spiritually, this movie is worth seeing. For the performances, for the message of redemption it offers, and also for the balanced and complex way it portrays the Christian right, which was not in power when the movies were first relesaed but now have substnatial influentce in our government. this movie could have been turned into horrible cliches about sin, salvation, right and wrong but it did not do that.",1125187200,4,1063,4.71505376344086

Robert Duvall plays a preacher who is in the midst of a political battle to remove him from his pulpit. He then finds out his wife is more than friends with the youth minister. Duvall snaps and lays a baseball bat upside the head of the slug that is sleeping with his wife.

Duvall then leaves town and goes under the radar screen to hide from his crime. I won't give away any more details from the movie.

The Apostle is a must see for movie buffs and fans of good acting and stories that don't have car chases and all the usual Hollywood cookie-cutter clichs. Bravo!",1122940800,8,839,4.2974683544303796
1808259,5,B00007ELF1,"This is one of my favorite Robert Duvall movies & is also one of the most inspiring movies I've ever seen. It's really a testament to the amazing talent of one of the greatest actors of all time. I can't believe Duvall didn't win an oscar, but it IS a religious movie & those are not too welcome in Hollywood. Anyway, the dvd has some great bonus features: commentary with Robert Duvall, a documentary on the making of the Apostle, the trailer, & cast biographies. If you haven't seen this & think it might be cheesy, trust me it's not. I felt the same way before I saw it but I quickly realized that this is a movie everyone should see. This movie helped me more than a dozen sermons would've. The performances are heartfelt & very believable, the pacing just right, the scenery is beautiful.

1808260,3,B00007ELF1,"Robert Duvall has made himself a real unique film here, as he takes the lead role of a preacher.  Aptly named Sonny, maybe a throwback to Godfather, the preacher leads a fervently religious life.  Yet, there is a history of sin.  After a passionate fit of anger Sonny takes his bible elsewhere, to find his religion all over again.

 Duvall does a very good job at playing the disheveled husband, and does equally well in playing Sonny's almost bi-polar self, the reverent preacher.  The problem with this film is not in the characters, but the time it takes to flesh out the plot.  After the first hour, I was surprised that the movie had not finished yet.  Now maybe this movie just does not relate to me, because Sonny preaches in a unique fashion.  Then again, maybe the movie is just slow.

 With the theme redemption all around, this movie redeems itself of three stars.  Not superb just decent the movie does deserve a watch or two.  Anyway, this is the most riled up I have seen Duvall since Apocalypse Now.",1093737600,3,1015,4.541436464088398
1808261,5,B00007ELF1,"The Apostle (1997)
Robert Duvall, well known for his charismatic character Gus in Lonesome Dove, both stars in and directs this film.  He plays the charismatic character of a minister named  Sonny, who later renames himself through the sacrament of baptism: The Apostle E.F.  The baptism through a rite of the church which should be attended by others is self-administered with only nature attending the event.  The baptism does not change all of Sonny's ways and neither does his name change. It does however allow him to follow and live out his calling to evangelize for a time as an apostle; one called by God to do a specific vocation in the church, or in this case outside the established church.  Like others in our society who have deluded themselves into the belief that by changing their name and geographical location they can escape justice for acts committed against the law and society.  But eventually when the past catches up with them, as it does with E.F., then justice prevails.
A question that comes to mind is who pays or who is to blame?  Is society to blame?  Or are the constructs within society the culprit?  There are usually two sides, if not more to every action.  What Duvall accurately portrays in this film is that the double standard of the patriarchal system is still very much alive.  His charismatic style which attracts others to worship at church is also used in another way in his home.  His wife Jessie Dewey (Farrah Fawcett) knows his style of manipulation quite well as she refuses to pray with him when he asks, begs, and then orders her to.  She resists thus asserting her independence from him.  She is no longer a victim to and of his charm and charismatic ways.  Thus the stage is set for his later behavior; drunkenness and jealous action.  He tries to take by violence what he believes is his, by right of marriage; his wife and children.  The act that he commits causes him to go into hiding, by running and covering up his identity.  Yet his conscious gets to him, as he calls a friend several times to check on conditions at home.  During this time of self-imposed exile he has no contact with his former life except through calls he makes to a friend.  This friend informs him of two deaths; that of his former youth pastor and his (Sonny's) mother.  The self-imposed exile cut Sonny off from his mother, to whom he was deeply devoted.
What caught my voyeur's eye is that Duvall successfully brought belief and faith to the film.  Faith and belief in something outside of one's self will sustain and nourish a person; whether it be a relationship with a friend or God.  People need the construct of community to live up to their full potential.  Sonny proved this as his alter ego E.F. brought a caring sense of community to a depressed people, which helped them to restore and renew their own sense of worth, and relationship to God.  In this way he lived up to the call of God within him, without the vanity of his former life as Sonny the Evangelist.
This film is a must have for those who would like to really see the reality of Christianity and faith lived out.",1086134400,13,3117,4.572972972972973
1808262,5,B00007ELF1,"Had I been reviewing this film a year ago, when I first saw it, it may have gotten 2 stars. With my first viewing, I wasn't able to give this film full attention, and this really is a film that demands ones attention, for its nuances of character and flavor. In other words, this is not a plot film - it is a film about character, local color, and a drama so 'under the surface' that if you're not careful, you'll miss it entirely. So this time, I watched with care and I loved every sweet minute. That's why I give it a 5, rather than a 2.
Sonny, a traveling preacher based in Texas, hasn't been the greatest of husbands and hasn't the greatest of wives. Before you know it, he discover's that his wife is seeing someone else, and want's him gone. What happens next, I won't say, except to tell you that now, Sonny is running not only from his past but from the law as well. Starting anew in Bayou Boutte, Louisiana, we watch Sonny build a small new congregation from the ground up with pure determination and a drive that is made all the more intense by guilt. Sonny, now called ""The Apostle E.F."" knows it is only a matter of time before his past and the law catch him, and he is intent on making every minute count. Has he succeeded?
What makes this picture shine is not plot or action, but characters and flavor. Duvall is quite simply one of the best there is and he (as writer, director, and actor) brings out the true subtle beauty in the character, his spirit, and the music that is country preaching (we get quite a few extended sermons and even to a non-believer like me, they are riveting).
What's more, Duvall went out of his way to cast mostly non-actors and becasue of that, the flavor of Bayou Boutte and the life of a country congregation really shines. Except for Duvall and Beasley, all of the preachers, even, are not only real preachers, but are giving real sermons. Because of all this, this film has all the complicated beauty of life itself, that usually go unnoticed untill a film like this brings them to the forefront for us to take a splendedly fresh look at. The results are simply marvelous.
To conclude, this film is true art. Art, that is, that taks the real and makes it beautiful again (with out prettying it up). The character of Sonny, Bayou Boutte, and ""The One Way Road To Heaven"" congregation are not images you will soon forget.",1080691200,9,2368,4.384090909090909
