What should be a simple transaction develops into something sinister when Antonio leaves and a bizarre man arrives. Franca grows increasingly frightened as the man reveals more about himself and why he's interested in the carpet. THE HOUSE OF THE YELLOW CARPET is not the giallo-type thriller I'd expected. No, this movie is far more interesting than the typical hunt-and-slash film. There is a building atmosphere of unreality and madness that disorients and adds to the overall mystery. Just when I thought I had it figured out, some new twist would occur!  I had a lot of fun watching this one! This movie also includes a few creepy characters who inject an uncanny, nightmarish feel to the proceedings. Definitely, expect the unexpected!...",1405814400,2,897,5.0608108108108105
