Jennifer Walcott & Carmen Electra are both favorites of mine.  I like Walcott with dark hair & it's as dark as ever so that makes it pretty cool for me.  Carmen's nipples ""show"" thru her tight little top quite a bit making this easily the most fun segment to watch.

Wendy Culp was cute & seems very nice.  This is the only video I have her on & I am a wrestling fan so I could def. appreciate Jerry Lawler's segment.

Ardy Lang was kinda funny & Lindsay Vuolo has some really nice natural breasts so that segment was okay too.

If you're not a big fan of any of the models or celebrities, this is at most a rental.  If you are a fan, like me, it may be worth a buy esp. as cheap as you can get it now.",1282780800,,795,3.9873417721518987
8154515,2,B0000A9GJS,"This is a video about Dale,Artie,Jerry n'tired ol Carmen...and so of course the Beautiful, Amazing Playboy Models get short shift!  Sadly this is the real world and Playboy has to make money.  That said you get to see the Outstanding,Wonderful,and Heavenly Dahm Triplets for what seems like SECONDS...ok about 10 quick minutes. The other models featured are just as amazing but their portion is also too short!  The worst feature is the ""music video"" NOT!  There is NO ""Music Video"", just more interviews with the models, what the????!  Oh Well, you were warned!",1117324800,7,562,5.0
