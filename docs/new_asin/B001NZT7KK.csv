8328535,5,B001NZT7KK,"This DVD set is a companion to The Grape Grower: A Guide to Organic Viticulture by Lon Rombough (a long-time HortIdeas subscriber who has been quite active in the North American Fruit Explorers), which we reviewed quite favorably in the December 2002 HortIdeas. We wrote in 2002 that ""The Grape Grower does a superb job of achieving its author's aim of `demystifying' grapes."" These new DVDs further demystify an aspect of grape culture that is rather difficult to cover in print: training and pruning for high yields and healthy vines. The video format enables Lon, using plants in his own vineyard, to demonstrate appropriate techniques (not just for his own area and cultivars, but ""for any
and all situations""). We recommend that you first view the last ""chapter"" (around
four minutes long) on the second DVD, titled ""The Results of Proper Pruning,"" to (literally) see the importance of good pruning annually--desirable positioning and densities of fruit clusters later in the year, as well as proper preparation of the vines for subsequent years. The images of luscious grapes will provide ample motivation for putting into practice the recommendations of the first DVD (around 52 minutes long), including spur and cane pruning, cordon training, and a brief introduction to layering to establish new vines. A lot of material is covered here, and you'll probably want to repeat some parts of the video to make sure you understand completely. The high technical quality of the video allows details to be discerned easily. On the second DVD are two additional ""bonus"" chapters. The first chapter (around 11 minutes long) should be quite valuable for growers in locales subject to late frosts (like us). It shows how to delay the growth of some buds in the spring by delaying pruning. Lon says that bud growth can be set back by up to about a week using this method--enough to allow an escape from frost damage in some situations. The second chapter on the second DVD (also around 11 minutes long) goes into detail on both simple and more sophisticated (approach-grafting) ways to propagate grape vines by layering. In the past, we  have praised instructional videos on fruit grafting; these DVDs show how helpful the video format can be for teaching fruit pruning. Good work, Lon!

8328536,5,B001NZT7KK,"I first learned of Lon Rombough through his incredible book 'The Grape Grower: A Guide to Organic Viticulture'.  I had boughten numerous other winemaking and grape growing books that were highly recommended; however nothing touched his book. It was the first I read while the others lay on my desk waiting to get to.  I contacted Lon and asked him some questions and he mentioned his new DVD video 'Proper Pruning of Grapevines'.  I had to have it!  I was deeply impressed with his book and after watching both DVD's a few times since I received them the other day, I am even that much more respectful for Lon, his work, and his knowledge.  The Videos straightened me out for many aspects of pruning, cordons and spurs upon first viewing.  Subsequent viewings were even more informative.  I cannot wait to watch and study them again to get stuff i missed.  Lon's deep understanding, clear and cogent explanations, and the incredible video close-ups enhance his explanations and descriptions beyond anything you see on the internet.  Excellently presented and produced, it is a' must have' for grape growers.  It is worth every penny!  Matter of fact, I just bought another copy to give to a dear friend who grows grapes and makes his own wine.

Do yourself a favor - Get this video NOW!

The Quality of the material (information/presentation) and the actual video is Incredible!

8328537,5,B001NZT7KK,This 2 DVD set contains so much information. I have watched it 3 times already. I would highly recommend them to anyone wanting to start growing grapes or anyone wanting to increase production from already established vines. It is well documented with closeup videography showing you exactly what he is talking about. I believe I will get more than my money's worth out of my grape production just this year.,1229990400,2,408,4.8428571428571425
8328538,5,B001NZT7KK,"Lon's practical hands-on approach to teaching the proper practices of pruning grapevines really makes it easy.  This video cleared up a lot of questions I had about the proper methods and gives some excellent tips for pruning to avoid late frost damage, and how to propagate vines quickly using layering.  Even though his book is an excellent and complete must-have reference, this companion video on pruning teaches the techniques in a more direct way that is difficult to capture from a book.  This video really shows you how to do it, while he explains the reasons why.  I highly recommend this video for anyone who has a grapevine and wants to learn how to prune for best fruiting results.",1229644800,2,693,4.798319327731092
