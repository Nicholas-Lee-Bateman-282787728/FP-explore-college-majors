It begins with excerpted videos of drug advertising. In 1967 there was a conference of psychiatrists that planned total control of human emotions, functionality, and mental status. [Does this remind you of Brave New World?] They wanted a range of psychiatric drugs for most people. Tens of millions of people are using these drugs today. They want everyone from children, teenagers, adults, and the elderly to buy these drugs everyday. Are there any scientific tests that show a physical need for these drugs? No! These drugs cause heart attacks, liver problems, immune system problems, etc. to unsuspecting patients. They estimate over 3,000 deaths per month from these psycho-tropic drugs. Most of these are prescribed by general physicians because of marketing, not scientific tests. Business is booming. They produced 44 drugs in 1966, and 174 drugs now. Its a lucrative business!

They mention bad examples of prescriptions. Psychiatrists cant cure mental illnesses, they treat or control it. [Does this mask physical illnesses?] They explain how the DSM was created; it is not based on physical tests. This is used to collect $72 billion a year from insurance payers. Chemical imbalances in the brain is their marketing tool. There is no test for this! There is a cost in human lives: about half of all suicides were on psychotropic drugs! [Remember when going postal was linked to Prozac?] Do psychiatrists know what a chemical imbalance is? What does the FDA do about this? Nothing! There is a conflict of interest there. Congress passed a law in 1992 (PDUFA) to push out new drugs. [How much were they paid for that law?] Theres no money in health but big money in disease. Would this cause fictitious disorders to be invented so more drugs can be sold? Yes. [Is this a form of political repression?] New disorders have to be invented to sell drugs, such as Social Anxiety Disorder or Bipolar Disorder, which are part of human emotions. When a patent runs out the drug is renamed to get a new patent! Perfectly legal.

Old drugs are repackaged for new conditions even if they don't work! The worse your health gets the more drugs you need. Disease mongering? How are these drugs tested? Are they safe? Trial and error. Patients are being tested to see if it is safe. It is pure marketing, not scientific testing. Statistics are manipulated. It can cause suicides. There are NO long-term studies of the effects! Drug companies hire psychiatrists to peddle them to other psychiatrists [peer pressure?]. They can bring in $500,000 a year. They also influence medical schools. Studies are planted in scholarly journals written by company employees but signed by paid psychiatrists as their own. Trusting doctors are fooled by this. Psychiatrists who prescribe these drugs are rewarded by drug companies (kickbacks). Drug companies also advertise to the general public, a form of thought control, to create a demand. The FDA allowed this in 1997, a violation of an International Treaty. Drug companies pay for lobbying. Are some problems due to poor nutrition? Yes.

Surveys are rigged to provide a need for drugs! Teen Screen is one example which has no scientific basis but is used to push drugs. The side effects of these drugs are carefully hidden away. All drugs have effects, calling them side effects is a way to hide or minimize them. Some of them can kill! [Does this explain the rising violence in America?] Are the side effects worse than the disease? Such as diabetes, kidney failure, tremors, etc. This creates a market for drugs to cure the side effects. This is often the case for senior citizens. Children are the latest targets! Their doctors have a legal loophole to escape blame, the standard of care. Its the law. They estimate 42,000 people are killed each year (thats twice as many as those murdered by firearms!) Its all about the money. Psychiatry is pseudo-science, just look at the evidence. Use your right to Informed Consent.
1) No psychiatric disorder is an actual disease.
2) Psychotropic drugs do not resolve mental problems.
3) Psychotropic drugs mask symptoms and have long term side effects.
4) Psychotropic drugs create dependency and addiction.
5) Most mental problems are caused by an underlying physical illness.
6) There are effective non-drug options for mental problems.

You can report problems to MedWatch, the FDA Safety Information and Adverse Reporting Program for adverse effects. They ask you to contact CCHR*org about psychotropic drug problems. The booklet that comes with this DVD provides a summary. There are no scientific tests to confirm a diagnostic. The more disorders that can be invented the more drugs that can be sold to unwary patients. There has been a forty times increase in bipolar disorders since 1994. Anyone with mood changes is considered bipolar even though this reflects actual life conditions. These drugs are toxins that create a lifetime of damage.

The movie The Fugitive tells how a drug company was pushing a product that did not work as advertised. Steps were taken to eliminate this truth from getting to the public. This is the key to the story.

In December 2015 the news is that the use of Prozac, Paxil, and Zoloft by pregnant women is the cause of autism in their children.
WHO will do something about this? The FDA? Not if they are in the pockets of the Big Drug Companies!",1447372800,,5414,4.955947136563877
