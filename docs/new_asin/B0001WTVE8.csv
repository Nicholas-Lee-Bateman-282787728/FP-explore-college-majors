8017265,3,B0001WTVE8,"Looks cheap, terrible acting and it reeks of early 90's cheese.
Seriously, this movie looks like a pornograhy flick with how cheap it looks and nobody here will convince you that anything that's going on is actually happening. Gotta love Gary's silly haircut and the cheesy music. I'd suggest cheap purchase ONLY IF you like bad movies.",1392940800,,336,4.912280701754386
8017266,2,B0001WTVE8,"In retrospect, it's surprising how long it took Gary Daniels to become a successful solo action hero...or at least how long it took him to land some good vehicles. By most standards, it wasn't until he began working with PM Entertainment that he began to shine as a standalone star. Before that, he was limited to supporting roles and the whims of directors like David Huey (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Legendary-Muay-Thai/dp/B003TO5J4Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Legendary Muay Thai</a>) who put him in some very weird movies, ""Full Impact"" among them. Nevertheless, as generally bad as this one is, it may be worth a look for fans of Gary, if only to get a taste of the surreal things our hero could get caught up in.

The story: policeman-turned-bounty hunter Jared Taskin (Daniels,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bloodmoon/dp/B000034DDT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bloodmoon</a>) hunts a serial killer targeting women.

What stands out most is how poor this one's production values are, the likes of which are nowadays generally limited to independent features. The lighting is bad unless a scene is being filmed in direct sunlight, the boom mic is prominently visible throughout at least one scene, the actual film quality has a dirty, sandy look to it (this may have just been my copy of the movie, but I don't think so), and - inexplicably - I'm pretty certain that the entire picture was filmed without sound, only adding it later in post-production. Like a bad Hong Kong picture, the results of this are not only awkwardly-inserted sound effects and voices whose inflection doesn't always match the acting of the performers, but an uncomfortable absence of real-world sound effects. This is particularly apparent in scenes with little dialogue, like when Gary searches for a corpse in the latter half of the film: he's covered his mouth and nose because of the smell, and the filmmakers sell this by having someone breathe like Darth Vader, unnaturally loud and clearly detached from the scene.

One of the few things that director Huey does correctly is realizing that the selling point of this one is having Gary do a lot of fighting, and the results aren't dreadful. About eleven fights abound, and while their staging could have been worlds better, the strength of Daniels' forms shines through. His co-stars, however, have less success: Ron Hall (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bloodsport-2/dp/B00005MM61/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bloodsport 2</a>) has a short yet decent match with Gary, but Gerald Okamura (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Power-Within/dp/B000C8STMG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Power Within</a>) has a rather ridiculous kung fu fight with Rod Kei and Graciella Casillas (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fire-in-the-Night/dp/6302241618/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fire in the Night</a>) endures an entirely meaningless and overlookable kickboxing match. Worse yet, the final battle is a textbook example in overlength: (SPOILER) Gary fights Kent Ducanon (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/American-Streetfighter/dp/B0001WTV8E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">American Streetfighter</a>) in a warehouse and on a rooftop, and the dang thing goes on for ten minutes - longer than it takes for both performers to go through their physical repertoires - and ends with a burning mannequin falling off a building.

There's nothing to be said about the acting or the screenplay, other than that more than one character insults Gary over his long, curly hair (could that be why he wears it so short these days?). Even if you're one of the aforementioned fans who want to watch this movie, I suggest doing so only with a firm grip on your remote control, so you can fast-forward the film's many tedious parts. Purchase with extreme caution.",1381968000,,3998,6.0583038869257955

8017268,2,B0001WTVE8,"This is episode 12 of FIP and this show is devoted to crowning the first ever FIP Tag Team Champions. Normally there would be a tournament or something for new champs, but that's not the case here. FIP's tag teams, as well as a bunch of the singles guys randomly teaming up. They say all throughout the show on commentary that it's NOT A TOURNAMENT! Basically all of these tag teams compete in random matches, some teams fighting several matches in one night, and most of them back to back. So it's a little confusing. The main event is a 3-team elimination match with the 3 teams that did not lose a match that night.

Carnage Crew vs. Heartbreak Express - 9:53 - 2/5
Carnage Crew vs. Dunn/Marcos - 2:03 - 1/5
Roderick Strong/Jarelle Clark vs. Homicide/Cordell Walker - 20:41 - 4/5
Brian Kendrick/Sal Rinauro vs. Jamie Noble/Steve Madison - 17:48 - 4/5
Jimmy Rave/Eddie Vegas vs. Evan Starsmore/Aaron Epic - 2:14 - 1/5
Jimmy Rave/Eddie Vegas vs. Dunn/Marcos - 9:43 - 2/5
CM Punk/Don Juan vs. Brian Kendrick/Sal Rinauro - 8:46 - 3/5
MVP vs. Jared Steel vs. Rainman (3-Way Dance) 7:19 - 1/5
CM Punk/Don Juan vs. Roderick Strong/Jarelle Clark vs. Jimmy Rave/Eddie Vegas (3-Way Dance Tag Team Title Match) - 9:59 - 3/5

Positives:
*If you love tag team wrestling, espescially in FIP than this is for you
*2 Great 20-minute tag team matches

Negatives:
*Lackluster, quiet crowd
*Poor lighting (the rest of the shows are very well lit)
*Lack of tournament system, not the best idea.

All in all it's not bad, but the rest of the FIP dvds are much better, may wanna try a few others.",1338163200,,1577,4.581560283687943
8017269,3,B0001WTVE8,"I am a really big fan of Gary Daniels. I liked the Martial Arts in this movie. But I have to give it a Three. I will now tell you why. That is because they said it was a second movie to American Streetfighter starring Gary Daniels. Number One it is wrong. Number two it had different people in this one. Number Three it had a totally different story to this. It was saying he was a cop, and he was divorced, and thought his child was dead to a accident. The way he talked the kid was just born. Four, this is where the American Streetfighter is totally different from Full Impact and Full Impact cannot be a second movie to it. The First one, Gary Daniels runs, but comes back to save his brother, and he finds out about his son mainly finds out he is a father and his son is already a teenager. Five, this child has not even reached Five years old. Finally, Someone who knows movies Like I do tell me how this is a second movie to American Streetfighter, only thing both has Gary Daniels being the star but it is no American Streetfighter 2 it is its on movie.
But I liked the martial arts, I thought Gary Daniels did a excellent Job in what he was doing, I just cannot rate it a four or Five what I would have Liked to have done basically it was not a second movie to American Streetfighter. I would suggest if anyone likes Gary Daniels Movies they should buy it and I think they would like it if they are into Martial Arts movies Like I do watching them.",1242691200,,1457,4.11578947368421
8017270,2,B0001WTVE8,"B-Action martial arts actor Gary Daniels (City Hunter, Bloodmoon, White Tiger) stars in Full Impact, and is honestly my only reason for checking out this film.  If this were the first film of his I had seen I would not be all that impressed.  While Daniels supplies the movie with plenty of fight action, the fights never awed me one bit - even for a B movie.  As for the movie itself, ugh, I don't think it could have ended fast enough, however, I am pleased to say it actually got better as the film progrssed, for whatever that's worth.

Daniels stars as Jared - a former cop now bounty hunter.  Already on everyone's bad side at the station, it only escalates when Daniels gets involved in solving the mystery behind a new killer on the loose.  I actually was determined to finish the movie to discover who the killer was, though it wasn't too difficult of a guess however it made for an interesting final showdown between he and Jared.

When the movie began I already knew I was in for a long and boring ride once the cheesy credits began to roll as Gary Daniels posed with a gun and practiced some katas in the street.  The dialouge, acting, and characters were about as bad as a B movie could get, and the fights weren't that much better, even though there was quite a variety from ally fights, street fights, club fights, ring fights and warehouse fights.  The choreography stunk and half the time sound effects were way off.  Gary Daniels displayed a few nice kicks that he is capable of, but still limted to what I've seen in his other films.  Fortunately the final fight was good, well, at least compared to what most of the movie had to offer.  It lasts a surprising 9 minutes, though half of it was composed of running and chasing around town.

It took everything I had to sit through this movie straight through, but things got a bit better as time went along.  The fights improved as did the story, but in the end I can't say I have any desire to watch this again.  Check out some of Daniel's much better B movies such as Bloodmooon, Rage, White Tiger or Deadly Target.
