8468793,1,B005ENCISK,"A no-budget Western that defies logic. The ludicrous hero is half-Mexican and half-Irish, but ""Professor Paul Blackman"" steals the show with his one-man-band number. Who writes this stuff? For bad-movie aficionados, ""The Irish Gringo"" (1935) is hard to beat.",1362528000,,258,5.641025641025641
8468794,4,B005ENCISK,"Some have called this the worst B-Western ever made. It's pretty bad, but like most of these early 1930's no-budget talkies, it has a strangeness about it that I like. It's kind of like watching a home movie featuring grown-ups playing cowboys.
The acting is either very broad or nonexistent, with Pat Carlyle's Irish Gringo performance being very much the former as he hams his way to the point of annoyance. The ""make it up as you go along"" plot has to do with a map of the Lost Dutchman gold mine being drawn onto a shirt that a little girl wears when grandpa gets shot and she wanders off only to come upon The Irish Gringo and his pals who save her.

The director is credited as William C. Thompson (his only effort) being best known as cameraman on Ed Wood Jr's many terrible films (PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE, GLEN OR GLENDA, BRIDE OF THE MONSTER, among others). This film has the look and feel of an Ed Wood movie, though Pat Carlyle himself may have directed some of it. Carlyle doesn't give himself billing credit in this or the earlier CALL OF THE COYOTE (1934) in which he pretty much plays the same character, Don Adios. Too humble or too embarrassed?
However, I did enjoy watching this mish-mash for whatever insane reason that I just cannot explain. And I especially enjoyed the final gunfight between the Irish Gringo and the leader of the badguys. They back away from each other, counting, poised to draw, when...
No spoilers here. You've got to sit through this thing to find out, but I'll tell you this: it's one of my favorite scenes in B-Westerns.",1330473600,,1648,4.4784053156146175
