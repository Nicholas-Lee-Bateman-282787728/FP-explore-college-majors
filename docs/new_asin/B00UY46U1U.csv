7071925,1,B00UY46U1U,"I used to love Downton Abbey.  But in season 4 they spent who knows how much to bring in Kiri Te Kanawa the famous opera singer to play Nellie Melba the famous opera singer who was too big a star to play house parties to play a house party, the only dramatic purpose of which was to drag everyone into one room so that Anna Bates, a beloved character, could be brutally raped in the kitchen of a house where otherwise no one ever had any expectation of privacy and her screams couldn't possibly not be heard.  That's just cheap, sleazy soap opera emotional manipulation, not respectable drama.",1428537600,5,593,4.481481481481482
7071926,5,B00UY46U1U,This series is absolutely remarkable. I was thrilled to finally get the entire series (1-5) to add to my collection. You will love it just as much as my family and I do.,1428105600,9,169,4.151515151515151
7071927,5,B00UY46U1U,A masterpiece!!!  We will watch one episode three times a week so we can enjoy over a longer time...one of my most valued purchases from Amazon.....,1438387200,,148,4.6923076923076925
7071928,5,B00UY46U1U,"I was a bit wary of ordering the DVD's as an earlier reviewer complained of missing episodes.  Happily all the episodes are there and I gave this series a five-star rating.  Downton Abbey tells the story of the aristocratic Crawley family, beginning with the sinking of the Titanic in 1912.  Season 5 ends in the mid-1920's.  Like many viewers, I am sad that Season 6 will be the last.  Stepping into the world of Downton Abbey is pure enjoyment.  While Season 4 suffered due to the absence of Dan Stevens, the series rebounded nicely.",1437868800,2,535,4.638297872340425
7071929,5,B00UY46U1U,I watched seasons 1-5 in one week.  I couldn't stop.  This is a fantastic series.  The only thing that is hard to believe is that the Lord of the Manor is so ignorant of what is going on in his own house so much of the time.,1437782400,,224,3.723404255319149

7071937,5,B00UY46U1U,"Series 5 of Downton Abbey follows the established tradition by being closely followed by the DVD set covering all the episodes to date. This includes the 43 episodes so far. There are seven episodes from the first series, eight each of the others, plus the 2011 - 2014 Christmas specials of which the first was a dramatic masterpiece, but the others have struggled to reach the same heights.

The five series so far have taken us from 1912 to 1924 and an exciting ride it has been. Series 1 started just after the sinking of the Titanic and a major feature was domestic concerns such as finding suitable partners for the Downton daughters, whilst the second series took us into quite different territory as Downton was converted into a convalescent home for injured servicemen. This series took us on to the end of the World War in 1918. We then enjoyed the first Christmas Special Edition which was probably the strongest single episode, and featured a very dramatic trial.

Series 3 went from 1918 to 1920 as the family adjusted after the war and life returned to more as it was in Series 1. However, there were financial pressures on the estate and it was clear that it needed to adapt to survive. Some members of the family embraced change more than others. The following Christmas episode saw the Crawley family in Scotland but finished in an unexpected tragedy which cast something of a pall over Christmas Day for those in the United Kingdom who saw it on the day.

Series 4 takes us further into the 1920s and it is clear that there has been some adjustment to the boundaries between those above and below stairs in terms of the rigid division which was clear in Series 1. The Christmas Special concerns the `coming out' of Lady Rose which is a quaint English customs by which young aristocratic ladies are introduced to society. Finally Series 5 is set in 1924 just after the election of the first socialist government in the UK. Romance is very much in the air, and in rather unexpected places!

To my mind Maggie Smith as the family matriarch has been the outstanding performer throughout with her witty and caustic comments although there have been many strong performances. Hugh Bonneville (Earl Grantham), Michelle Dockery (Lady Mary) and Jim Carter (Carson) spring to mind, but to single these out is to do injustice to many others. The extra features on the individual DVDs of the individual series are also included here so there are several hours of these in addition to the screened episodes.

If you have been an avid follower of Downton Abbey since the beginning then four years on it is probably an excellent time to revisit the earlier episodes as we are currently doing. However, if you are not acquainted with the series then you really should get hold of this set. You don't know what you are missing!

As a final thought, sadly we now know that Season 6 will be the last so some may prefer to wait for the box set containing that series too.",1435017600,6,2968,4.643809523809524
