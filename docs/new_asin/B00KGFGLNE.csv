6425233,5,B00KGFGLNE,"This collection reflects the ""goodness"" of TV in the 1950s, wherein families could watch and worship together, and enjoy wholesome television.  Sadly, this type of great music and the words of God's praise cannot be found on modern, mainstream television.  I am glad to have it in our home, as it brings back sweet memories of how our families worshiped and believed in the Saving Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ.",1432944000,8,412,4.788732394366197

8658359,5,B00KGFGLNE,"I'm so glad we found this.  Being from Ford's TV variety show from many decades ago, I expected the sound to be pretty bad, but  it has really been done very well.  I rarely like to play a lot of hymns sung by the same soloist/singing group, but this is an exception.",1453075200,,267,4.096153846153846
8658360,5,B00KGFGLNE,"Wonderful, treasured gospel hymns sung by Tennessee Ernie Ford with his deep bass voice.  One can realize how much he loves his God, family and country and one knows WHERE he is NOW that his earthly life is over!  I think this DVD of him and his love for ""the Old Rugged Cross"" and his family is evident by his selection of gospel hymns and also the appearance of all of his children and even his German Shepherd dog!  I've been watching this DVD on the Gaither channel on t.v.  And I plan to order this for my cousin and his wife and send it to them.  His DVD is a true testimony of his love of Jesus and the God of the Universe!  It is so comforting, as we all have so many concerns ""these days"".  It will truly bless you if you order it and listen to it. It will be a blessing to anyone who hears these all-time gospel favorites!",1449446400,3,832,4.067484662576687
8658361,5,B00KGFGLNE,"A more inspiring gospel DVD would be hard to find and a more inspiring singer would almost be impossible to find, too.  Ernie Ford's rendition of each of the songs found on this DVD.  I have loved his voice for years and decided to get a DVD of him singing the most loved songs of my childhood.  The only song I ever learned on the piano was The Old Rugged Cross, taught to my by my grandmother, and it was sung at her and my granddad's funerals.  It is the most beautiful of all of Ernie Ford's songs.

And the Just A closer Walk With Thee is superb.  There Will Be Peace in the Valley  and Rock of Ages are all terrific vehicles for Mr. Ford's deep melodic voice, all sung from his heart.  I can remember him singing a gospel song at the end of each of  his variety shows and I can still see him without a lot of big show production for each number, just Tennessee Ernie by himself singing all of the old time favorites.  Ernie was what you saw, just a common man with a whole heap of talent and a gift of a beautiful voice.",1445040000,6,1026,4.059701492537314
8658362,3,B00KGFGLNE,Mr. Ford has an amazing voice and you can hear his sincerity in singing hymns.  I play these and sing along in my car.,1438300800,,118,3.9166666666666665
