8216931,3,6301648536,"I thought this was a very good telling of Frank Cavanaugh's life at that stage, with some fine acting all round.  A little slow, perhaps in places, but that timing is far more important to me than the modern flash/dash directing which doesn't allow me to absorb the details at times.  The story was easy to follow, the locations were extremely well  photographed, and the quality of the black/white film itself was excellent.",1359504000,2,425,4.794520547945205
8216932,4,6301648536,"THE IRON MAJOR is a film about the life of Frank Cavanaugh from his days as a football player at Dartmouth through his triumphant career as coach at Boston College and Fordham. In between he coaches at Cincinnati and Holy Cross and also tries his hand as a lawyer.
When World War I breaks out Cavanugh enlists in the army and is wounded leading an artillery battalion in France. By surviving his wounds he earns the nickname of the ""Iron Major."" His career at Boston College and Fordham follows World War I and lasts until he gradually loses both his sight and his health.
THE IRON MAJOR is above all a patriotic movie about football and war made at the height of World War II. Pat O'Brien plays Cavanaugh and Ruth Warrick has the role of his sturdy wife who is also the mother of their nine children. The supporting cast includes Robert Ryan and Leon Ames.
Ray Enright directed NAUGHTY BUT NICE and RETURN OF THE BAD MEN in addition to THE IRON MAJOR and several other films.",1062460800,6,976,4.4581005586592175
