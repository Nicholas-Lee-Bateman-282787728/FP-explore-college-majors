8170043,5,B000MMMT7I,"I really loved this movie.  I saw it when it ran on TV originally back around 1998.  I always wanted to get it on DVD or tape.
An  interesting plot  and exciting ending...I am glad I finally was able to find this on DVD.",1485561600,,220,3.9318181818181817
8170044,5,B000MMMT7I,Not a bad storyline and subject.  Similar in concept to the TV show Sliders.  Had originally seen it on TV,1374796800,,106,4.25
8170045,3,B000MMMT7I,I have seen it a long time ago. Not a bad movie Just think if we could do that. Not a bad buy,1358985600,,93,3.0869565217391304
8170046,2,B000MMMT7I,"Weak plat, predictable script, average special effects and ineffectual acting. What else is there to say.",1210896000,,105,5.625
8170047,5,B000MMMT7I,"Back in the 1990's I saw it on ABC. It was good, but I can'f figure out how the machine teleports to the alternate dimention. Like sliders on

Sci-Fi channel they used a photon generator. Going through dimention in space means going through the black hole. On earth when we sleep we dream that we are in a alternate dimention. I can't wait to watch the DVD to find out how it works.",1169510400,3,382,4.232876712328767
