7834500,5,6303031463,"Really wasn't prepared to like this film as much as I did.  The print is not that good - the images are too dark in the dark scenes to see the details, which is a loss considering the way some of the murders are committed.  Ah, there's nothing like a good ole' Greek Tragedy - inappropriate sibling affection, debt, inheritance, desperation.  Jeffrey (George Hamilton - young, so dashing, so sensitive, such a comedian) is in debt to his very sinister friend/loan shark Angelo (Cameron Mitchell - playing his role to the hilt);  he's also got the mutual adoration of his sister Sarah (Luciana Paluzzi - ""Five Fingers"" ""Thunderball"") although she's become engaged to the wealthy Nikos (Thodoros Roubanis - ""Oso yparhei erotas"" ""Imperiale"").  I was intrigued by the Greek location, more Greek dancing, dish smashing, singing, and scenery than in ""Zorba""!  A wealth of authenticity.  Produced by Hamilton, script by Christopher Wicking, Directed by Gordon Hessler.  Well-paced, well-acted, decent script, suspense, and dark, imaginative deaths just when you want one.",1418947200,3,1064,5.2176470588235295
7834501,4,6303031463,"I'm going to have to give this a four on the bad movies scale because there were a few things that set it apart and it was memorable.  And it stars George Hamilton! George Hamilton is awesomely hammy and he does do a great job portraying a weird, weird character.  He likes poodles, sequins, strangulating lovely ladies and his sister!  Could you imagine anyone else in the role?  Like most Italian movies this makes little sense, but at least it makes more sense than most.  By the way, George and the beautiful Italian woman play brother and sister who grew up together, but have totally different accents. Go figure. Best with aspirin and friends who like bad movies.",1364342400,,670,4.6440677966101696
7834502,1,6303031463,"It should be bad enough that this movie makes no sense, but to compound things filmmakers have made ""Medusa"" hopelessly slow and dull. On top of that, George Hamilton gives his inept impression of an actor.",1363737600,2,206,4.75
7834503,1,6303031463,MY FAULT THIS ONE I GAVE IT AWAY IT'S THE THE MOVIE I THOUGHT IT WAS.SO IT'S MY FAULT AND I DID NOT WATCH IT ALL THE WAY THROUGH.,1349049600,,129,3.4827586206896552
7834504,1,6303031463,"Brother and sister Jeffrey (George Hamilton) and Sarah (Lucianna Paluzzi, who had a long career until this movie with movies that included the James Bond film ""Thunderball"" and the science fiction B-movie ""The Green Slime"" - which I liked because it was so corny) are dead on a yacht.  The movie then flashes back to how the two got where they are.

The plot of this movie is nice and simple.  Jeffrey owes money to Angelo who borrowed the money from the mob.  Everyone knows that people like these ""encourage"" repayment of loans.  The only way Jeffrey can repay Angelo is with money inherited from his father.  However, Jeffrey's father wrote a new will before his death and Jeffrey faces the possibility that his father might have disinherited Jeffrey.  Suddenly, people who could have knowledge of the will's location start turning up dead.

The bulk of the movie bounces around, trying to develop characters without giving away the details of the ending for as long as possible.  One problem I had was that the movie just succeeds in being boring.  Sure, there are some bloody scenes and even moments of tension, but the movie is unable to sustain any sort of tension for very long and I longed for the movie to end.  Another problem I had was that Jeffrey was not a sympathetic character.  George Hamilton has never been one of my favorite actors and the level of his obnoxiousness in this movie hardly commends him as any sort of hero.  Sadly, the only thing the end of this movie did for me was to cause me to say ""hurray,"" I can watch something that I hope will be better.

One thing that seemed weird to me is the relationship that Jeffrey and Sarah had.  The movie did its best to show that Jeffrey and Sarah's love was more than the love of a brother and a sister for each other.  You watch, you decide.

Some side notes:  The title of the movie seems as though it might be horror or fantasy.  The movie is nominally a ""thriller,"" but the only horror is realizing that you paid money for this turkey.  The sound had some issues, but with the exception of a couple of places where I backed the movie up to try to figure out what someone had said, I was generally able to understand the dialog.  The picture was also somewhat murky, but generally watchable.  Keep your expectations low.  Both the sound and the picture would benefit from being updated using modern technology.

About the only recommendation I can provide for this movie are for those who are collecting the movies of one of the principal actors.  If only there was one single thing I could point to and proclaim that yes, there is a reason to watch this movie; sadly, there is not.  I certainly do not plan to watch this movie again; at least, not without coercion of some sort.

Good luck!",1295740800,2,2766,4.51307847082495
7834505,3,6303031463,"MEDUSA & THE MCMASTERS from GENIUS ENTERTAINMENT is a slimline-cased product similar to ones you often see in places like WALMART for a buck each. There are absolutely no extras, not even chapter access.

The Post-Civil War western THE MCMASTERS (1970) is in quite decent condition visually. Headphones reveal an unfiltered audio track with ambient hiss and occasional film crackle-- but the sound is full-range, clear and strong.

MEDUSA is in similar condition: no repaired breaks, decent audio. Eastmancolor here isn't as vibrant as the unidentified stock of ""McMasters,"" and it's a bit hazy by comparison.

Since this product's description adequately cover plots, let's just say that ""Medusa"" is an absolute turkey (unless you're a fan of the Greek music featured in spots). George Hamilton comes across as laughably bad in this tedious crime story.

""McMasters"" is several cuts above by comparison, has an interesting cast, is well-made and this item is recommended STRICTLY for that picture alone. Its transfer quality and bargain price are certain to satisfy.

Parenthetical numbers preceding titles are 1 to 10 imdb viewer poll ratings.

7834506,3,6303031463,"George Hamilton (Love At First Bite) stars as a frivolous, quite possibly psychotic playboy, who, along with his sister, stands to inherit zillions from his ""greek tycoon"" father's will. That is, unless a new will has cut him off completely! People involved with said will are murdered in front of him by a mysterious strangler. Even fellow psycho and loanshark, Angelo (Cameron ""The Demon"" Mitchell) is no match for this shadowy figure! Will anyone survive? Perhaps. Can this all end happily?? Of course not! MEDUSA is a dark, twisted tale of greed, violence, and death. There are some memorable scenes, like Angelo's swimming scene. Let's just say that I hope he can swim long-LONG distances!
