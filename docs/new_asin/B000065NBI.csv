7961509,4,B000065NBI,"Actually, if you want to be picky, Elmo Lincoln was NOT the first actor to play ""Tarzan of the Apes."" Gordon Griffith plays the younger Tarzan before Lincoln, a former Arkansas police officer, takes over the role as the adult Ape Man. This 1918 film directed by Scott Sidney is fairly faithful to Edgar Rice Burrough's popular novel, which had only been published a few years earlier.
Actually, the plot really follows the novel more closely than does any other Tarzan movie. John and Alice Clayton (True Broadman and Kathleen Kirkham) are marooned by mutineers on the coast of Africa, where their son is born. After his parents die, the newborn Tarzan is adopted by Kala, one of the Great Apes. As he grows up, Tarzan finds his father's knife and is able to use it to become King of the Apes. Tarzan meets up with Binns (George B. Finch), the sailor who saved his parents, and then Professor Porter (Thomas Jefferson) shows up to investigate the unbelievable story of the white man raised by apes. Tarzan kills the native who killed Kala and rescues the Professor's daughter, Jane (Enid Markey) when she is kidnapped.
Unlike Burrough's novel, the film version does not put off the happy ending between Tarzan and Jane for another day. ""Tarzan of the Apes"" is crudely made, but does remain true to the novel, something that would become less and less true of the dozens of Tarzan movies that would follow in its wake. Plus, the movie does it all in under an hour! However, if anything, Lincoln looks TOO muscular to be the jungle hero. Still, this film has a special place in the history of Tarzan and all fans of ERB's novel should check this one out sometime.",1068422400,2,1661,4.633898305084746
