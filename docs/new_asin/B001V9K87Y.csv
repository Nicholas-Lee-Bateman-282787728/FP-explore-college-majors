3820139,4,B001V9K87Y,I have to admit.  I  enjoyed the series when it was on the history channel and jumped on it when i saw it for $4.00 on Amazon.  It is what it is.  Nice scenes will lots of arguing.  Like one of the reviewers said.  I was half expecting a lion to jump out and eat Pasqually when he was trying to go through the brush and seemed clueless where they were.  Would I spend $20 for it?  No!  $4.00 yes.  I enjoyed it!,1319932800,,411,3.8433734939759034
3820140,1,B001V9K87Y,"I really thought this would be a great true life adventure program/show, instead it was a long, 30 day hiking trip with the participants doing not much but arguing the whole darn time. It was like a bad reality T.V. show in my opinion and I was ready to see somebody get voted out! There was little about the guides mentioned too and it seemed they were just after thoughts when all said and done during the whole expedition. There was not much in the way of history mentoned along the trip either as I would expect and would have liked. I found it odd too that boats and donkeys were always just available when they were needed in the middle of knowhere. It was a real bad idea adding the part each time the four explorers jumped into a Subaru (sponsor I guess?) that had well panned camera shots of the vehicle before they drove off and around populated areas. May as well had Subaru stickers on their foreheads the whole trip and by the way, what happened to the others in the expedition? Did they get into a cattle truck for their ride or did they get a Subaru too!  They just seemed to arrived somehow at the other destination. It also seemed like it was an after thought as well to include the guides and poreters in the celibration at the end of the trip at Ujiji.  I would think that Bombay, Sir Richard Burton and Speke's explorer African guide, must have received more kind attenton. Expedition Africa could have been a great program but fell terribly short in my opinion. Bummer!!!",1308182400,7,1492,4.421818181818182
3820141,3,B001V9K87Y,"I have traveled to Africa many times (South Africa (3), Kenya (3), Mozambique (1) and Zimbabwe (1)) and read a biography on explorer David Livingstone within the past year.  Knowing this, a friend recommended this DVD to me.

The concept is great, recreating Stanley's expedition to find Livingstone.  But the reality show format gets old quick.  There is too much time spent listening to the latest ""drama,"" some of which appears to be made up or exaggerated.

I felt that of the four characters, Benedict and Kevin were weak.  Kevin was billed as a seasoned war correspondent.  He seemed way out of place and in over his head.  So, the billing seems exaggerated.  And Benedict just seemed to not be focused or engaged.

I also did not like that much of the journey was covered by car (to be able to cover the 970 mile journey in 30 days).

The travels across Tanzania were interesting enough to get me to finish the DVD.  But I was left wanting much more.",1303776000,3,957,4.564705882352941
3820142,3,B001V9K87Y,"The Expedition stops every few minutes so that the team can share there feelings/complaints/ fears.  After awhile it gets very tiring (perhaps like a real expedition) - but like the Blair Witch Project you find yourself cheering for something to (please) come out of the darkness.  The hiking had to be arduous and dangerous - but all of the second guessing and bickering makes for miserable viewing.  You wonder if the director scripted some of the drama - or simply encouraged the team to talk about it every five minutes. However, for the excellent footage of the African scenery the dvd set is worth three stars.",1295827200,10,616,4.7924528301886795

8345807,5,B001V9K87Y,"We very much enjoyed this series.

Many reviewers are hating upon Pasquale, yet fail to understand that it was his job to lead this expedition. He was the Navigator with all the experience and knowledge. Pasquale had to push everybody forward, including the porters. Each member of the party had a specialized job to do. One was the Survivalist, who had to know which foods to eat and which trees to avoid burning in a cooking fire. One was the Wildlife expert (Mireya) and the other was the Journalist (Kevin).

Yes, there was a lot of bickering, but what reality show doesn't have that? This expedition faced hunger, thirst, torrential rains, sickness and Malaria, personality clashes, whispers of mutiny, snakes, wildlife and a host of other dangers as they made their way across Africa. It's as near to the real thing as most of us will ever get. This is a DVD that we'll rewatch over and over for decades to come.",1447804800,,918,4.660493827160494
8345808,5,B001V9K87Y,Wonderful product and great turnaround on purchase.  Pleasure doing business,1407369600,,76,6.6
8345809,5,B001V9K87Y,I found this worldly band of explorers to be intriguing on many levels.  The expedition was as astounding as that of Stanley.,1388707200,,125,4.681818181818182
8345810,1,B001V9K87Y,"Tis is the one of the worst shows i have tried to watch in a long time. I lasted for three hours until i refused to watch more. The worst part was the so called wild life expert Mireya Mayor. She decides to wear a sleeveless and nearly backless undershirt that looks like it is 2 sizes too small and intended for a peep show. It looks like she wanted to look like a cheep looking cheer leader romping around trying to get young boys aroused. I tossed my copy in the garbage. This show is boring, tasteless and lacks decor. The scenery is negligible at best. My entire family will sit down and watch RIVER MONSTERS and MAN VS WILD for 2 or 3 hours while eating popcorn or ice cream. We love these types of shows. It would be great if the BBC , DISCOVERY CHANNEL or National Geographic would do a show on the great Livingstone and Stanley episode. Dr. Livingstone i presume? This is really cheesy stuff. You could call it BENNY HILLS GOES TO THE JUNGLE.",1384214400,6,951,4.259668508287293
8345811,1,B001V9K87Y,"I had high hopes for this video. These hopes were soon dashed. Got less than an hour into the first episode, and had to turn it off. Excellent concept, and it turned out to be reality tv b.s.

Constant cutaways from the group to people being interviewed separately and complaining about each other. Very very VERY annoying! Then, the group footage got worse, and showed yet more stupid conflicts, and then yet more interviews and complaining. I'm guessing if a group really acted this way out in the wild, they'd all be dead pretty soon.

This film was, I thought, supposed to be important.. tracing the expedition to find Dr. Livingstone.. something that I think should have been treated with respect.

But just about all I saw was stupid reality tv drama, with poor editing and overly intense music. I could have done without any of the music. A good expedition program would not need ridiculous background music to be exciting. And, a bad show, like this one, is made even worse with dramatic music.

I'm used to PBS and BBC programs.. shows generally done right, not this garbage.

Very very disappointing. Good thing I got this from the library and didn't spend any money on it. Bad enough to waste my time. Would have been even worse if I'd wasted my money as well.",1351382400,3,1271,4.631111111111111
8345812,2,B001V9K87Y,"If you're interested in history, then pass on this production, as there's very little of substance in it. You won't learn much about either Stanley or Livingstone, nor Stanley's expedition, which isn't followed faithfully. And you certainly won't learn about this part of Africa at that time. What you will learn about are the supposed travails of the four so-called ""explorers."" Of course, they weren't really exploring, as the area traversed has been well known for a long time. Then there are the contrived dangers, notably those of food and water. Neither could have been much of a problem, given the presence of the film crew. If you like bickering, then you'll be happy, as it dominates the story. Also, contrived? The stars of the film are the Africans, especially the two Maasai who complete the journey to Ujiji. I will admit that the photography is spectacular, especially the night scenes, when, out of necessity, the lights had to be on to keep the cameras rolling. In fact, maybe the best way to watch Expedition Africa is to turn off the sound.",1325030400,2,1058,4.818681318681318
