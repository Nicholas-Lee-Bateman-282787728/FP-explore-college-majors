7803573,1,6300155277,"This VHS tape is defective.  Within Section 1 of the tape, the screen goes blank.  At that point the tape will not forward or reverse.  Very disappointed about this purchase since I was looking forward to getting a new copy of her workout routine.",1363737600,,247,4.568181818181818
7803574,5,6300155277,"Great Kathy Smith workout! I mean, this is one of my favorites from Kathy Smith. Easy to do moves, nice atmosphere (as always) and the whole video I have fun while doing the workout. There are alot of different parts to this video (most on aerobics) but towards the end there are I think 2 seperate parts on posture which are floor excersises. And it sounds boring, but actually she really explains and shows you how to stretch out your areas involved in your posture and how to sit right and all. It was REALLY interesting and helpful to me. If you are looking for an excersise tape aimed for aerobics and to help with your posture (which is so important) then this video is excellent and fun!",1269648000,,694,4.4296875
7803575,4,6300155277,"The title of the tape pretty much says it all.  I was brand new to aerobics when I started this video, and it was relatively easy to pick up the moves while still getting a good workout.  Kathy Smith shows you different levels of intensity that you can do the moves at, so that you can progress as you learn the routines.  She also teaches you about proper posture and stretching.  It's especially helpful that she provides closeups of footwork so that you have a chance to really see what's going on.  The film is outdated, but still pretty good.  For a beginner, you'll be sweating by the end.",996105600,4,595,4.412844036697248
7803576,3,6300155277,"this workout is great for beginners because it is not too intense or lacking in intensity. It is divided into two sections. The first section is a really nice aerobics section. During this section, Kathy does easy low impact aerobics. She even has ""foot looking"" for the people with two left feet (like me). The second section is the body awareness section. It is a nice way to relax the muscles after the aerobics section.",970012800,7,423,4.653333333333333
