8459145,5,B00562WNB6,"I liked this film because it concentrates on just what the title suggests, incredible visual footage and good tunes. The surfing footage shows a lot of longboarding, but doesn't leave out short boards and with the occasional Alaia and mini simmons. What I liked most about it was there were no conversations about philosophy and lifestyle....just surfing! There was nothing that needed to be said, the surfing said it, It was refreshing and I enjoyed it.
This film is for people who already know why we surf, leave the talking for the campfire.",1374364800,,544,4.860215053763441
8459146,4,B00562WNB6,"best surf video Ive seen in forever. No lame comedy shorts, to FF thru like in all the Thomas Campbell films. Lots of different boards being ridden, the music fit the footage and isn't worn out 60's stuff or whiny EMO,even if you mostly listen to Oi or punk the sound track is good. Truly fantastic scenery in the Maine segments and great footage in Mexico with Tyler warren on mini simmons and logs, Kasia Meador and others. You can have the video on with your kids in the room and it just makes you wanna go surf. In a word its a no BS surf film thats just not the same ol same ol. Highly recommend it.",1326844800,,604,4.127118644067797
8459147,2,B00562WNB6,"If you like movies like the JOB,  Bruce Movie, Modern Collective, Trilogy, High5, Intersection etc. , I don't recomend this movie. I was expecting more after a local surf shop owner gave it the thumbs up. The surfing is very fair/poor and the waves in general were just ok. I understand big budgets produce high quality wave shoots, like JOB,  but this is just not impressive. I have surfed over 30 years and seen every video part so I am not trying to be a jerk. Just honest review.",1313107200,2,483,4.415730337078652
