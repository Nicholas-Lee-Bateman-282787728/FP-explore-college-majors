5942863,5,B00ESZZOMM,since this is the only company that still had that movie and it was all my wife talk about ws this movie and no one had seen it so when I found it I brought it for her for Christmas.,1388448000,3,182,3.575
5942864,3,B00ESZZOMM,"Realizing the director of THE NAKED CAGE also gave us CHAINED HEAT, it would have been nice to have this given the same restoration as HEAT and put on Chained Heat/Red Heat/Jungle Warriors release in place of JUNGLE WARRIORS. Oh well. What we get here is a topped-up full frame port from the video master. OKay, it's not widescreen, but it's decent enough looking, and a big step up from the VHS with just a wee bit of visual tinkering and adjustment with your flatscreen to suit your visual needs. Sadly, the same can not be said for the transfer of SAVAGE ISLAND, which looks just awful! The soft focus, washed out color picture is little improvement, if any, over a VHS copy. Strong daylight footage fairs better than anything night or indoors, and overall it pales in comparison to the acceptable Naked Cage picture. And as most of Savage Island is shot outdoors, the full frame format is brutally noticeable and really leaves you wishing this had been widescreen. Historical note: This film shares a lot of the same footage with ESCAPE as both were shot back-to-back. Differences? In this film Anthony Steffan plays an officer as opposed to a drunken doctor in Escape. Scenes of sex & violence in Savage Island, but not seen in Escape, include a gory bullet extraction, a more extensive drowning scene, three gun brawls, and an entire prison yard riot. Conversely, many sexual shocks, like Christina Lai's rape, are missing from this print. And of course Linda Blair was shoe horned into the beginning and provides some narration here.",1387756800,16,1540,4.793233082706767

Candice Rialson stars in the campy CHATTERBOX, a decent compliment to the two. ANGELS FROM HELL is a rather lame biker.",1442448000,,361,4.323529411764706

5942890,4,B00ESZZOMM,"This is a very uneven collection of films with no common theme. Three are entertaining. One is a perplexing throwaway.

The best of this lot is ""Angels From Hell,"" and I have to admit my surprise in saying so. The oldest in the collection (released 1968), it lacks the sex appeal (i.e. nudity) of the other three, but does feature some stunningly-gorgeous women including the jaw-dropper Arlene Martel who I am convinced is among the most beautiful women in history. It does have an interesting story, if you could call it that, and is very well-acted. A biker (Tom Stern) who plays by his own set of rules returns home and retakes control of his old motorcycle gang. There is really no linear plot beyond that, but it held my interest for the duration. I was especially impressed with Jack Starrett as the tough-but-fair sheriff.

""Chatterbox"" (1976) is the oddball of the collection but then again, in cinematic history, ""Chatterbox"" ranks among the biggest oddballs anyway. It's about a woman's vagina that one day begins talking and singing. The woman (the gorgeous Candice Rialson) is more or less along for the ride as her genitalia becomes a star. Funny (often in an ""OMG"" kind of way), entertaining and lots and lots of Rialson topless. Unfortunately, never bottomless. Not really, anyway. So we never actually get to see the ""Chatterbox"" in question, which is my only real qualm.

""The Naked Cage"" (1985) is a women-in-prison movie that really is about five to eight years behind its time. Follows a young women wrongly accused of partaking in a bank robbery and murder, and the effort of the woman who actually orchestrated it to kill her while both are behind bars in a prison that, from the looks of things, isn't any more secure than a car impound lot. As you might imagine there is a substantial amount of nudity and violence, including some kind of disturbing subplots involving a serial rapist crooked cop. This is an OK release to me, but I'm not a fan of WIP.

""Savage Island"" (1985) is the one here that I could do without. It's another WIP, but a really bad one. I haven't studied the history but it appears as though the jungle prison portions, which are dubbed, made up an entirely different (and, I suspect, much older) movie that was glued together with bookend footage of Linda Blair, who is enacting revenge on the jewel magnate who profits from the prison. None of it makes any sense and there isn't even enough quality nudity to hold my attention span. Not only that, the quality of transfer is pretty atrocious.

Overall, though, considering that these movies aren't readily available, this is a strong collection.",1397174400,19,2643,4.762008733624454
5942891,2,B00ESZZOMM,I'm only giving it 2 stars for the nudity. There's not much here. Linda Blair was on screen for about 10 minutes and didn't do much. I wouldn't recommend these films. Chatterbox was ridiculous. Angels from Hell was the only movie worth wasting time on. And Naked Cage was as advertised. No Oscar winners in this group.,1395705600,,318,4.5964912280701755
5942892,5,B00ESZZOMM,it is a great book. i loved it. it is great. even my husband read it. now my friend is.,1391731200,4,87,3.4
5942893,3,B00ESZZOMM,"Even though Linda Blair is only used to bookend the  foreign movie with bad dubbing, it's worth it just to see her shoot Penn Jillette in the face.",1390176000,12,147,4.25
5942894,5,B00ESZZOMM,"Well to tell the truth I didn't want the four pack but only one, so to get what I wanted I had to buy all, Now the other three movies are D grade something to watch at a later day but the other one, the naked cage is great. Because of  another persons statement a young woman is sent to prison  innocent of all charges. But trapped on the inside with all to hell to go along with it. With the action that follows is thick and fast, Plenty of suspense and thrills not knowing what's coming next, edge of the seat entertainment. The cast did a fabulous job with the storyline making it even better. Different and worth watching for sheer delight. I rated this an A grade for the motives and ideas that were created in the movie. Now I have told you something about it it's time to get a move on for the popcorn, plus a chair to relax on with  your feet up intriguing, unusual  so different from other shows a grand classic, A fantastic show waiting to be watched.  Enjoy!",1389484800,6,969,4.188172043010753
8609122,5,B00ESZZOMM,I think this pack was a definite surprise four absolute films of in the hot seat and of the wall.  The Cycle Psycho deliver the goods of returning to a home that could not help but shift back into the same uphill battle.  Our star almost broke out of his reality but could not survive another round of over the top rough luck amazing he got that far.  On another not Chatterbox just would not let you enjoy the perks for absolutely cracking me up with the uncanny.  This one had to be the gynecology joke of centuries. On to tails of the wild at heart this one is better yet left in the so close to a real manila folder till you could not tell if you could go up or down. The Naked Cage definite take the hotter than norm femme fatale to the edge.  The final film is no stranger to the hot and exotic with views of the chart and the action to match.  The Savage Island will definitely make the edge go from going to your average chic flick.  Post it loud women empowerment the hot way.,1523923200,,985,4.098958333333333

8609126,4,B00ESZZOMM,"I know some people have complained that ""Chatterbox"" is in this set because the subject isn't close to the other 3 titles. I think it fits in with the 42nd St. feel they were going for (there were many odd pairings there and in other 2nd run theaters around.)

1) ""Chatterbox"" - The singing vajayjay, 70s comedy. It has it's place but doubtful it will win over many new, younger fans. Candice Rialson is well worth watching.

2) ""Savage Island"" - Really only for WIP completionists only. Tame (this version appears to be cut) and Linda Blair is barely in it.

3) ""The Naked Cage"" - Personally, this holds up well in the WIP genre for me. I actually saw this in the theater back in the 80s. Fast pace, tons of nudity, and revenge. Well worth watching and owning.

4) ""Angels From Hell"" - The main reason I wanted to see this for years (was only available on a way too expensive, oop VHS) was because I used to work with one of the actors (Angry Annie in the movie) and she told me not to bother looking for this. Decent entry in the biker genre and Tom Stern is excellent in the lead.

Overall, image quality is good (Savage Island is the weakest here), extras are non-existent. Good value for your money if your into these types of flicks.",1482278400,,1239,4.346320346320346
