First you can easily tell this ""seminar"" takes place in front of about 30 people who obviously attended for free...Why? because no one would pay to sit through a hour listening to this guy talk.  Complete silly nonsense.  After 30 minutes it was good for a laugh and that's about it.  Motivation factor - ZERO.  Covering your face and shaking your head - YEP.  I paid $90 for this, what a rip.  Enjoy my money big man in the red sweater - Merry Christmas.",1291161600,3,550,4.3861386138613865
