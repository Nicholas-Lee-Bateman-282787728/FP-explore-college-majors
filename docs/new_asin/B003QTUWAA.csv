8402616,5,B003QTUWAA,"An early talkie effort, ""Going Wild"" (1930) is an amusing comedy which takes a little time to build up. But when it does, it's hilarious. The fun is watching Joe E. Brown's ""lies"" get himself way over his head into an aerial contest which climaxes the film. The homemade simulated flighted contraption has to be seen to be beleived; his medical exam is quite funny; and the ""real"" simulation has Joe hollering his tradmark yell.
Great flick.",1349481600,3,441,4.740259740259741
