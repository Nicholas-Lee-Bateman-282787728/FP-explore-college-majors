1811360,4,B00007GZR3,"""Countess"" was Chaplin's final film and sadly I think it has been labelled as being awful. This is not the case. I feel that the main reason for people believing this to be a bad film is that they don't understand it. Chaplin always created fantastic stories out of simple ideas and this is not an exception.  It is written and directed with such subtle elegance that some of the simpliest visual gags turn into the most hilarious situations.  There are fantastic actors all round: Brando himself, Sophia Loren looking gorgeous, Sydney Chaplin showing that talent does run in the family and Patrick Cargill as the butler. Chaplin himself pulls a cameo and does a great job at not hogging his screen time, a mistake made by directors like Tarantino.  The result is an amazingly gentle film that shows people from a fresh human perspective, a breath of fresh air by todays standards.  You will be missed Charlie.",990057600,52,910,4.7405063291139244
1811361,5,B00007GZR3,"This is a great romantic comedy and should be taken for just that. Though  Marlon Brando does a great job he was an odd choice for this role, so his  fans would probably not enjoy this. It's very different from anything he  has done. I have seen this movie many times and enjoy it more and more each  time. The music is wonderful! I searched for many years for the soundtrack  and was rewarded a few years ago. It's very light and easy comedy with some  great chemistry between Loren and Brando. Originally when it was released  it had some not so great reviews, but a lot of that was due to the many  problems that plaqued the set and the cost. See the movie and judge for  yourself. If you enjoy the old romantic comedies with Doris Day and Rock  Hudson you should really enjoy this one.",965865600,9,789,4.27027027027027
1811362,4,B00007GZR3,This film has been trashed mostly by people who are holding this up to Chaplin's earlier masterpiece films.  It is easy to see this one isn't like  his other movies and it wasn't meant to be.,959817600,25,191,4.277777777777778
1811363,1,B00007GZR3,"The main reason why I bought (!) this movie is because I wanted to collect all of Brando's movies (I'm a Brando fan, U see). Though this movie filled one of the collection slots - I was extremely disappointed with the quality  of the movie. The only Brando movie I watched by fast-forwarding along way  ! Worst of all Brando's Movies.  You wouldn't believe that the Great  Chaplin created this movie - poor closure to a near perfect film career. No  wonder Brando picked this movie purely out of respect for Mr. Chaplin.  There is just nothing good about this movie, very primitive in everything.  Monotonous Music and Camera work, and the worst acting job by all actors  involved. What a mega waste of talent and time.
Even if you are a huge  fan of Brando/Chaplin - DO NOT Rent/Borrow/Buy this movie - JUST NOT WORTH  IT ! ...unless you are a collector like me :)",935366400,9,865,4.487179487179487

1811375,4,B00007GZR3,"A Countess from Hong Kong is a comedy film and the last film written and directed by Charlie Chaplin and his only color film. The movie starred Marlon Brando, Sophia Loren, Tippi Hedren, and Sydney Earle Chaplin, Chaplin's second son.

The story is based loosely on the life of a woman Chaplin met in France, named Moussia Sodskaya. She was a Russian singer and dancer that ""was a stateless person marooned in France without a passport"".

Wealthy American diplomat Ogden Mears (Marlon Brando) is sailing from Hong Kong to Hawaii, where he hopes to meet and reconcile with his estranged wife Martha. However, while the ship takes on passengers in Hong Kong, a stowaway slips into Mears' suite. Natascha (Sophia Loren) is a White Russian countess who was forced to flee the country following the revolution and ended up in Hong Kong, where she earns a meager living as a dime-a-dance girl in a sleazy ballroom. When Mears discovers that Natascha is an uninvited guest in his quarters, she begs him to help her emigrate to the United States; when he refuses, Natascha tries a new tack, threatening to tell Martha that they've been sharing a stateroom if he doesn't cooperate. Mears grudgingly allows Natascha to stay with him and keep her secret until he can figure out a clever way to get rid of her.

While many considered this as Chaplin's worst effort,it was still a lovely film. It may not be an excellent movie,but it is still a pleasure to watch for Brando and Loren alone.",1451088000,,1477,4.717054263565892

1811377,4,B00007GZR3,"Sophia Loren and Marlon Brando in a fun sexy romp on the high seas. Marlon seemed to be playing 2 roles, one was the staunch rich diplomat which he did very well and the mushy funny guy which in the very beginning with all the hiding in the cabin was very funny. Sophia pouts and also has a  great deal of fun the rough seas and cigar scene is terrific. Sophia is an expatriate Russian Countess who flees to Hong Kong and is little more than a dance hall girl, she meets Marlon and his group and stows away in his cabin to run to the U.S. Lots of fun and the support cast is magnificent. I don't understand why this movie is getting such a bum rap? It is well acted and has some good laughs and good acting.",1439769600,3,707,4.05
1811378,3,B00007GZR3,"Chaplin's last film was much maligned when released in 1967 as being old fashioned and poorly produced, but time has revealed this film to be nowhere near a disaster.  While the dialog can be stilted, the physical gymnastics occasionally inappropriate for sophisticated actors like Loren and Brando and the film too ""small"" for the widescreen process, there is a simple charm about it.  Chaplin's use of color (his first) was called ""washed out"" in the 1960s, but viewed today, looks much more realistic than many of the candy-colored films of the late 1960s.

This is no masterpiece, but a respectable film which supplies considerable entertainment value.

By the way, Chaplin's little on-camera appearance as a seasick steward and Margaret Rutherford's bit as a cranky passenger are worth the price of admission.",1436918400,,814,5.190839694656488
1811379,5,B00007GZR3,"Light hearted fun and comedy abound in this tale of Natascha, a White Russian ""Countess"" played by the beautiful Sophia Loren, who stows away in the cabin of a very, very rich American diplomat, Ogden Mears, played by Marlon Brando on a luxury sea voyage from Hong Kong!  Natascha wishes to make a new life for herself in America and is discovered in his cabin in very short order.  She is gorgeous, determined and broke!  He is shocked, put out and frightened of discovery by the press and, eventually, his wife Martha, played by Tippi Hedren, who is to join the voyage in Hawaii!  Misunderstandings and complications arise to such an extent that Natascha finds herself being asked to marry Ogden's valet, Hudson, before she is discovered by Martha!  The problem is that Ogden Mears has fallen in love with Natascha through all of the subterfuge!  Enjoy this romp on the high seas.  Charlie Chaplin and his brother, Sydney, both appear in the film in cameo.  Charlie Chaplin wrote the screenplay and directed the film.  He also penned the words and music to, ""(Love) This Is My Song,"" eventually recorded by Petula Clark but used in the film in its instrumental version only.",1424908800,,1176,4.753694581280788

Old fashioned comedies are my favorites.  Probably because I am old.  What is so good about this movie?  The script is good, the acting is superb, and it has one of my favorite female actors.  I laughed so hard I fell off my chair and chocked on my drink.

1811392,5,B00007GZR3,"Although you can see that Charlie Chaplin used some of the tricks he used in his silent flicks, the story line and the acting was great.  Brando was perfect as the man to fall for the semi-soiled dove as portrayed by Sophia Loren.  Sophia had terrific timing for the comedy bits as did Marlon Brando neither of which was known for their comedy chops.  Tippi Hedren as the rich B@#$& soon to be ex-wife pulled it off perfectly.  Sidney Chaplin was good as the sidekick/secretary and watch for a cameo of both Charlie Chaplin as a steward and his daughter Geraldine in a brief bit.",1387497600,5,579,4.485714285714286
1811393,2,B00007GZR3,"In Charlie Chaplin's last film, made when he was 78, Marlon Brando is an oil barons son trying to enter politics. He has a night in Hong Kong, his ship departs, and he finds countess Natascha stowed away; a white Russian cast adrift by the Russian revolution, she forces herself into his life as a tragic, beautiful war refugee. This is a Chaplin film, and theres all sorts of comedic situations. But with the screwball romance that was one with the times, this is really more of a Billy Wilder film than a Chaplin film; and given that this is his first attempt to do a colour film, it does look like the cards were stacked against him. The story is a bit flat, with Brando mumbling his way through the drama, and we seldom feel that theres love growing in him for this nutty chick whos appeared in his suite. Most of the drama is enacted in Brandos two-room suite, with Loren scrambling for the toilet every time theres someone at the door. Some funny scenes include a crazy night of wave-swept storms, and some intermingling with the ships passengers, including a strange scene stealing Society Girl, played by former Bond girl Angela Scoular, who talks about the immortality of the soul, and begins phrases with Daddy says Another funny interlude with the batty Miss Gaulswallow, who the hopeful young men on board the ship mistake for Natascha. Chaplins son Sydney plays Brandos business manager Harvey, and his daughter Geraldine is one of the other society girls on the boat (other daughters Josephine and Victoria also turn up). Tippi Hedren shows up as Brandons estranged wife, and theres all sorts of nonsense getting Sofia Loren to marry his butler, Hudson (played masterfully by Patrick Cargill), and Chaplin turns up at age 78 in two scenes, where hes only seen peering in the door. Excellent cameos, not a great film overall, though.

One of the other reviews notes that Chaplin made the film when he no longer had his own studio, hence less artistic control. Brando and Loren are not comedic actors. Yes, this is all true. It's also a bit sad that so little of Hong Kong is shown in the film! But... oh well...

Its interesting to learn that Chaplin had initially tried to make this film in 1930 with Paulette Goddard.",1381795200,2,2232,4.66243654822335

Maybe if he starred in it it would have been different and we could still watch the master at work. I found both Marlon and Sofia to be stiff and unconvincing. The regular gags didn't work with them. Perhaps if he picked two comedians it would have come off better. This film shows you that movies stars in the caliber of M and S can't save a film from doom, even under the master mind of Chaplin. See it if you want to confirm my review, otherwise save your money. The saving grace of the film is watching Sydney Chaplin in his supporting role. Too bad the others gave no support to his performance. I purchased it in the hope of seeing just one more masterpiece. I was sadly disappointed.",1371168000,2,777,4.328767123287672

1811411,5,B00007GZR3,"I recently bought the film ""A Countess from Hong Kong"" that was the last film directed by Charlie Chaplin.  Even though I am an admirer of Charlie Chaplin's acting and directing talents, an admirer of Marlon Brando's acting achievements especially in ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" and ""On The Waterfront,"" and an ardent admirer of Sophia Loren's voluptuous beauty that is equally matched by her acting ability, I was discouraged from buying this DVD by the movie reviewers who declared that Charlie Chaplin's last movie was a flop.  Luckily, I was encouraged to buy this DVD on the basis of the previous three perceptive reviewers of this movie.  As they note both Sophia Loren and Marlon Brando live up in ""A Countess in Hong Kong"" to their lifelong ability to create three-dimensional characters who have both a dramatic and comic awareness of the situation that they are in.  There is a definite chemistry between Marlon Brando's and Sophia Loren's characters in this movie.  It is entirely believable that the two would fall in love with each other given each of their character's circumstances. Marlon's character is trapped by a loveless marriage, by his inheritance of his father's wealth as a Texas oil tycoon, and by his attempt to have a political role to play in the U. S. Government even though his political posturing is expressed by empty, uninspired rhetoric and lacks sincere personal conviction.  He is truly trapped by his marriage, his wealth that he inherited but had no role in making, and his unfulfilling political ambitions.  Marlon's character becomes increasingly moved by Sophia's character's seemingly hopeless predicament of trying to flee from her life of prostitution in Hong Kong by stowing away in Marlon's character's suite on board the ship that is travelling to Hawaii.  Because she is traveling without a passport and is a stowaway on the ship, her desperate plight brings out Marlon Brando's compassion for her past, present, and future circumstances so that love very convincingly blossoms between them.  Marlon's character's desire to help Sophia's character becomes the evidence of his deep love for her.  At last he is able to achieve a worthwhile and a unique goal in his life that consists in his making his life and Sophia's character's life more happy.  He tries to use his wealth and political connections to help achieve her desire to start a new life in America.  This movie is certainly not a light frothy comedy; there are humorous physical moments especially when the two main characters continuously run about the rooms in the cabin suite to hide from either ship officials, aides, and servants in the bedroom, bathroom, and sitting rooms as well as cleverly written verbal humor and verbal sparring that is written by Charlie Chaplin for the two main characters, but there is a dramatic core to this movie consisting in Sophia's character's and Marlon's character's mutual desire to make each other lives more truthful and more fulfilling. In the numerous close-ups of Sophia's character's face, the viewer is entranced by her warm and passionate eyes and luscious lips that are convincingly at different moments in the movie able to react to Brando's character's initial selfishness and his later compassionate generosities to her.  As romantic partners Marlon Brando's broad-shouldered 5 foot 9 inch or five foot ten inch build is a perfect match for Sophia's similarly curvaceous and statuesque 5 foot 7 inch built.  Add two or three inches to the high heels that Sophia's character wears and both actors are able to look directly into each other's eyes.

Having read David Lean's biography, I recollect the author telling us that Sophia Loren encouraged her husband Carlo Ponti to produce David Lean's movie ""Dr. Zhivago"" (released in 1965) in the hope that she could play the part of the Russian woman Lara, but that David Lean insisted upon Julie Christie appearing in this role.  Therefore, it is interesting that Sophia when ""A Countess in Hong Kong"" was released in 1966 played a Russian woman who was forced to flee from Russia to find a political refuge in Hong Kong in the furor created both by the aftermath of the Communist Revolution and by World War II.  She seems to have applied the passion that would have gone into her portrayal of Lara's character into that of her character in ""A Countess from Hong Kong.""

Also it is interesting that Sophia Loren who emphasized the importance of discretion if a married woman was to have an affair years later in one of her television interviews is echoed by Marlon Brando's character's statement in the movie ""A Countess in Hong Kong"" when he also emphasizes the importance of discretion when pursuing an extramarital affair.  Yes, I definitely believe that there was great sexual chemistry both in character and out of character when making ""A Countess in Hong Kong.""  These two heavyweight actors doing both their physical and verbal sparring on screen keep the viewer's attention throughout the movie.  This movie should be regarded as Charlie Chaplin's final motion picture triumph since the serious and comic sides of his characters in ""A Countess from Hong Kong"" are as emotionally compelling as Charlie Chaplin's relationship with the blind girl who eventually recovers her sight due to Chaplin's character's help in ""City Lights"" and the romantic relationship between Charlie Chaplin's character and Paulette Goddard's character in ""Modern Times."" The three romantic relationships between a man and a woman in ""City Lights"" and ""Modern Times"" and ""A Countess in Hong Kong"" have all in common the desire of the male and female protagonists to help one another in a world that can often be too tough, too cruel, and worse yet too indifferent.",1332374400,13,5757,5.026260504201681

The whole concept of let the Russian stowaway (Loren) hide in the would-be ambassador (Brando) cruise ship cabin gets tiresome rather quickly, especially with the many failed attempts at high jinks and the no chemistry tag between the two stars. Yet despite it all you just can't help watching these two onscreen misfits make a fool of themselves as the plotline gets sillier and sillier.  Sure, the film ends up resembling an amateur play, and sure, director Chaplin tries his best to make it look all glossied-up (and he sometimes succeeds at it, like the change partner dance routine scene for example), but as a whole THE COUNTESS FROM HONG KONG is definitely bad cinema; but still fun enough to be hailed as camp.

There were scenes that were supposed to be funny but were merely embarassing (consider the scene with the cigar smoke and ask yourself, Why?).  The acting was uninspired and that's hard to say about Marlon Brando.  I was disappointed in everyone although I understood Chaplin's purpose; he spotlighted his offspring although they were uninspiring as well.  Even the two songs he composed for the movie were played too much.  I'll continue to watch other works of Charlie Chaplin and Marlon Brando because I know what they're capable of.

1811443,5,B00007GZR3,"This movie is so bad, it's good. As a matter of fact, it is collectible! You will enjoy seeing two of the sexiest, hotest, most attractive people on earth move around each other as if they were furniture pieces from different sets, with absolutely no sensuality, or attraction of any type whatsoever, as a matter of fact, when Brando finally grabs Sophia for a kiss I thought he was going to slap her.

Sophia looks gorgeous in every scene and outfit, which includes two different sets of Brando pajamas, one of which comes in an unusually strident shade of yellow that is particularly hideous. Her hair is perfect, eventhough she is staying in this cabin with nothing of her own as she arrived wearing an evening gown and a small purse that could fit a lipstick, maybe two. Yet in every scene she looks as if she had walked out of Alexandre de Paris' salon for a blow and dry. Noticing the capricious falling of her curls or the twist of her hair endings was my pastime in this movie that has one of the worst scripts ever written.  She acts her part as a Russian Countess fallen on bad times in the Orient very nicely, there is an iceness to her character that she conveys quite well. At her staged wedding with Brando's valet, which she has to go through to get entry into the US, she looks amazing in a pale green dress that is five times bigger than her size, but she manages to wrap it in a knot at the waist front , folding the long sleeves chinese style for a few minutes in which she makes you believe this is haute couture. When Sophia dives from the ship to her freedom she is wearing a perfectly tropical-patterned bathing suit and, yes, her hair dries out PERFECTLY in place, as if a hair-dressing angel was doing it for her.

The furniture and sets in this film are the epitome of bad taste. Everything looks cheap, including the wood paneling in the boat's 'lavish' suite' where most of the action takes place. The pale-lavender sofas of the suite can only be imagined in the context of a provincial funeral parlor. The mustard coloring of the ballroom of the ship and the unfortunate costumes in most of the first class passengers can only be described as painful. Warning: The latticed work in most of the wall spaces in this film, as well as ""tropical"" rattan cheap-furniture can induce vomiting if you have not been frequently exposed to suburbian furniture.

Brando was exasperated with his character, as he always looks bored and on edge. His pale-coral-rose lipstick and bronze makeup really show up in high definition and it looks funny. His clothes are particularly unattractive, except for his tux, yet he always looks great. Tippi Hedren plays Brando's wife Martha, and we could see here an early prototype for Albee's Virginia Wolf: A spoilt, unhappy, bitter and consistently annoying privileged creature who comes into the picture with two closets of luggage and a french maid that looks more like a lesbian companion or top model in between jobs, as a matter of fact her name in the credits is simply ""Balbina"" so she was a model or a well known courtesan. Tippi enjoys her role and plays it to the hilt, making a strong case for the failure of marriage in modern bourgeois society, her brief dialogue concentrates on denigrating Sophia's character, her husband, or both. Her presence is consistently bitchy and in seconds one can understand why her marriage is on the rocks, though it probably already started there. She does come out at one point with an exquisite Indian silk gown with gold patterns to match her conversation about Saudi Arabia which marks her only redeeming contribution

It was a schock for me to discover that Charles Chaplin was the director, as I thought this was the definitive bad Holywood movie, but then again, doesn't this depth of things wrong point to greatness?? The theme song, composed by Chaplin, which I loved, and later discovered was a GREAT hit, is also a reason to watch this movie, over and over.",1271635200,5,3967,4.637268847795164

1811445,2,B00007GZR3,"Countess From Hong Kong(1967) is Charlie Chaplin's final directorial feature and a rather sad swan song to such a magnificent career. The film is an outdated romantic farce about how a son of a succesful tycoon(Marlon Brando) finds a beautiful stowaway in the form of Sophia Loren, who he met in China and now finds aboard a ship with him. A romance develops, though you won't believe it. Obviously, both actors are excellent but are VERY miscast and add to the discomfort of viewing the picture as a whole.
Brando cannot seem to capture the nuances of romantic/screwball comedy and is totally out of league in a role clearly intended for a Cary Grant, David Niven or even a Rock Hudson. His character comes across as cold and unfunny throughout and never gains audience sympathy.
Loren looks gorgeous, like usual,but seems out of place in the role of the naive Countess. She does have a nice scene in a sarong, but that's about all that could be reccomended from her in this picture.
Charlie makes a cameo appearance as a steward, but it is too little and not enough. Tis a shame, because this film really could have used a true comedian.
Compared to many of the sex comedies this film feels antiquated and dosen't even have the charm of the earlier films it wishes to emulate. This is one worth skipping.",1259798400,6,1306,4.633620689655173

This is probably a good case of miscasting between Brando and Loren, there is no spark to their performances when together --- Another character to the film is This is My Song one of Charlie Chaplin's famous tunes from this film --- 'This Is My Song' reached number one after a week in 1967 when sung by Petula Clark --- She recorded the tune in French, Italian, and German --- Don't regard this film as Chaplin's best work, but it is far from being a bad film --- All in all not bad for a director 77 years young!

1811447,3,B00007GZR3,"First of all, I love Brando, love Sophia Loren. I saw this in the theaters when it first came out and I wanted to own it. It wasn't so much that this is a good movie; it's just entertainingly bad. The editing is choppy, the actors move around like they are pieces being placed on a chess board, Brando is obviously BORED and he looks as though he over-acts on purpose in some of the scenes. The extras are AWFUL...the whole movie has an out-of-date feel to it (and not in a good way). There is NO sexual tension between 2 of the sexiest movie stars ever. So, what do I like about it? The absolutely gorgeous love theme ""This is my song', watching Sophia Loren's luminous eyes fill with tears, and Marlon Brando doing a semi-tango at the end (although he messes up at one point...watch closely). Yeah, I bought it, still watch it...it is one of my favorite bad movies.",1225324800,4,867,4.3580246913580245

1811449,2,B00007GZR3,"Chaplin's final film is alternately a beautiful and meditative love story, and an old-fashioned (in the worst sense of the word) film that shows the limits of its director's abilities.

The lead performances depend on the direction that Chaplin was able to provide. In some scenes, Brando manages to mimic Chaplin perfectly, and it works. In other scenes, he still mimics Chaplin, but the result is less effective. (As a devout Method actor, Brando repeatedly clashed with Chaplin, whose directorial style consisted of having the actors mimic his movements and delivery exactly). Sophia Loren is well-cast as the former Russian countess-turned-dance hall girl who stows away with the newly-appointed ambassador to Saudi Arabia (Brando). Aside from a major error in Chaplin's script (that is, that Loren's character is supposed to have left Russia in the revolution of 1917, which would make her character quite a bit older than she is), Loren plays the role with a comic grace that is both captivating and charming. The supporting cast have their moments: Sydney Chaplin as Brando's friend and advisor, Tippi Hedren as his estranged wife, Margaret Rutherford, in a delightful cameo as an elderly passenger aboard the ocean liner, and in a particularly memorable standout performance, Patrick Cargill as Brando's valet. Cargill shows a gift for comic timing and understated delivery here that makes the viewer wish he had been given more opportunities to demonstrate his talent. He nearly walks away with every scene he's in, and remains perhaps the most memorable part of the film.

Chaplin's use of color and widescreen is appropriately understated in keeping with his style. However, it is in Chaplin's direction that we begin to see the limits of his filmmaking ability, at least in his later works. The cinematography is appropriately understated; however, it is in the editing that the pace of the film begins to bog down. Scenes requiring a frantic pace are edited entirely too slow, losing much of the comic rhythm between the performers. Many scenes are played out in single, long takes, without much interaction between the performers within the frame (they instead appear to have been instructed to stay ""on their mark"" and deliver their dialog).

Perhaps the film's most memorable aspect is its lush orchestral score composed by Chaplin, and featuring the great ""This is My Song"", which re-appears throughout the film. Chaplin's abilities as a composer at this point had perhaps outmeasured his abilities as a filmmaker, and-fortunately for future audiences-he spent the next decade composing scores to his silent features of the 1920s.

Universal's DVD of ""A Countess from Hong Kong"" is an excellent transfer in anamorphic widescreen. The colors are rich and the image sharp. It boasts a clear mono soundtrack, and features a trailer as an extra.",1203984000,13,2858,5.193058568329718
1811460,3,B00007GZR3,"1967. Written and directed by Charles Chaplin. Last film of the British genius. Not a masterpiece but still with scenes that seem to have popped up from a silent movie. After all, I liked it and that's all that matters to me.",1192320000,4,225,4.380952380952381
1811461,5,B00007GZR3,This is a great old movie. Setting is dated but the story and acting are great. Marlon Brando could do comic acting! Has a very good scene about seasickness on a cruise ship. Buy it.,1173312000,4,182,4.228571428571429

1811463,2,B00007GZR3,"This film is not without some merit, but overall, it's pretty disappointing, considering it's a Charlie Chaplin film.  Out of Chaplin's five sound films, this is the one to avoid.  It seems Mr. Chaplin was trying to put Marlon Brando in a role Chaplin himself would have performed in his heyday.  But Chaplin was obviously too old to play the tramp (he was 77 when he made this), so he put Marlon Brando and Sophia Loren through the antics.  There are a few funny moments, a lot of doors slamming, some nice humanistic touches, but most of it just seems tired.  The supporting performances are very subpar, the editing is quite awkward, and the atmosphere of the film is almost dirge like.  A rather sad experience, especially if you're a Chaplin fan.  It's not the worst film ever made, but it's very disappointing....",1169942400,7,819,4.685314685314685

because Loren an Brando do not have the greatest chemestry - it

makes it even funnier. I like the type of comedy from these days

and it cant be compared to our times - I judge it positively for a movie from these days. Love it much!",1102809600,8,359,3.8904109589041096
1811466,1,B00007GZR3,"""A Countess From Hong Kong"" (1967) is painfully unfunny and depressing to sit through, particularly since it was Charlie Chaplin's cinematic swan song. At age 77, he was out of touch as a filmmaker and no longer enjoyed the creative autonomy of his own studio  hence the overall static quality. Marlon Brando and Sophia Loren are expected to do little more than Chaplin imitations. Both performers appear ill-at-ease with the weak romantic-comedy material. If only Chaplin had allowed a documentary to be shot on the ""Countess"" set  it would have been more enjoyable than this leaden farce.",1099008000,6,590,5.072164948453608
1811467,4,B00007GZR3,"A COUNTESS FROM HONG KONG was director/comedian Charlie Chaplin's final film.  In this film he is the director, writer and composer.
The story concerns a beguiling Russian countess named Natascha (Sophia Loren - HOUSEBOAT), a young woman forced into prostitution in Hong Kong, when she happens to meet an American politician named Ogden Mears (Marlon Brando - A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE, SUPERMAN).  She stows away in his stateroom aboard a ship headed back to the States, where she belives she can escape her miserable life.
The usual battle-of-the-sexes ensues, when Natascha and Ogden are forced to spend the entire voyage together, bickering and fighting over their different opinions and tastes.  But its soon evident that they are in love.  Things become complicated when Ogden's icy wife (Tippi Hedren - THE BIRDS, MARNIE) joins the ship at Hawaii, while Natascha finds herself marrying Ogden's valet in order to gain an American passport!
This is a film that feels a little old-fashioned for the 1960s, but it is a rather charming and engaging romantic comedy.  Perhaps the film is best-known for launching the hit single ""(Love) This is My Song"", made famous by Petula Clark.  The movie also stars Sydney Chaplin, Patrick Cargill and Margaret Rutherford in a rather-clever cameo.
The DVD includes the trailer.  (Single-sided, single-layer disc).

1811468,2,B00007GZR3,"I see there's several reviews already for this film, but here goes my two cents worth.  Even though this is Chaplin's last film, it's his first and only film in color and widescreen.  The movie is old fashion to say the least, it might of been better in b/w.  Brando and Loren are completely wasted, the supporting players fair much better.  Chaplin is quite good in his cameo role (makes you wish he'd given himself a bigger part).  At the time, Chaplin took the negative reviews as almost a personal threat.  He really defended the film, even going so far as to say he thought it was the best film he ever made!  However several years later he admitted it wasn't very good, he said the actors where great but the story was really thin.",1051401600,8,737,4.4148148148148145
1811469,2,B00007GZR3,"This is the final motion picture written and directed by Charlie Chaplin. He was 78 years old when it was released and had been in political exile from the United States for the past 15 years.
Although the movie features two of the biggest stars of its time, Marlon Brando and Sophia Loren, and was written as an old-fashioned comedy, it is rather slow and ""talky."" It has plenty of curiosity value, but I'm sorry to report, not a great deal of entertainment value. The once mighty Chaplin, had simply run out of gas. Working with Brando (who openly made fun of Chaplin during filming) and a script he had first drafted in the 30s for Paulette Goddard, Chaplin was out of his element.",1046995200,7,684,4.524193548387097
