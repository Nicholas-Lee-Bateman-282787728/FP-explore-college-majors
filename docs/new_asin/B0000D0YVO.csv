1921192,3,B0000D0YVO,"I've seen plenty of movies like this one.  It has a neat story line in it, but for the obvious reasons that hinder B-movies, it falls short of its potential.  ""The Bone Snatcher"" starts off well enough, with three miners being attacked and stripped of their flesh by some ""thing.""  A group seeks out the three missing individuals and come upon two of their skeletal remains.  The third member of the party is accused of murder by one of the search party members.  Tracking his footprints, they find his remains as well.  They decide to hunt down the real murderer, which leads to a classic B-movie scenario of the team members being picked off one-by-one as the group slowly comes to realize what they are chasing.  Though this is considered a horror film, there isn't much to horrify you in this picture.

The actual ""Bone Snatcher"" creature looks pretty good considering there probably wasn't much of a budget for the flick.  Most of the acting is done in a very stiff fashion, though a couple of the characters, especially Magda, do manage to connect with the audience.  Scott Bairstow is mediocre, especially considering that he is the ""star"" of the show.  His acting isn't very convincing to me.  In fact, he looks like he doesn't even want to be there.  Rachel Shelley is a beautiful lady, and I hope that her career moves beyond this type of ""B"" fare.  Her character is pretty interesting, but it's pulled off in a confused sort of way.  The rest of the cast is cluttered with stock ""B"" characters placed on the screen for the sole purpose of being the next victim.

The story moves along at a snails pace, and the action is thin and spread far apart.  The best scene involves the ""snatcher"" and a team member in a sleeping bag.  The CGI is along the same lines as those in ""The Mummy Returns.""  That's pretty good considering the funds available for this flick.

So why did I give it three stars?  First of all, it's an above-average B-movie with a really good story, even though it drops off as the movie trudges along.  Secondly, the creature effects are done very well despite a low budget.  Finally, the scenery is shot very well, making the best of the desert surroundings.  Overall, this movie is worthy of two to three viewings, and then it will collect dust on the shelf.  If you like standard Sci-Fi channel fare, then this movie will suffice.  Recommended to hardcore sci-fi fans who relish in B-movie schlock and know what to expect from such films.",1097712000,19,2468,4.590389016018307
1921193,2,B0000D0YVO,"I thought from the reviews that this movie would be better than it was. It looks like a movie that was made for the Sci Fi Channel. It's okay if your flipping through channels for something to watch, but I wouldn't spend money on it. It's not scary or even tense. I think the person who wrote wow must have been in the movie or had a friend in it. I don't see anyway anyone could watch this movie and say wow. I try to see every horror film I can. I don't scare very easy, but I don't think even a child would be scared by this one.",1088294400,,532,3.889908256880734
1921194,3,B0000D0YVO,"Beautifully filmed in the African Desert; superior CGI effects; and realistic background music are the high points of this otherwise tedious and confusing picture.  Three employees of a diamond mine factory are viewed in the prologue; they rip a hole in one of the sand dunes and out pops something that kills all three, mercilessly scraping all the flesh from their bodies.  Enter an American scientist (played lifelessly by Scott Bairstow) who journeys to the site for some reason or other?  Rachel Shelley is there as the initially cold and unfeeling Mickie McGee; Warrick Grier is the usual jock stud; and Adrienne Pearce does nicely as the truck driver Magda.  BONE SNATCHER has some truly unnerving scenes and the ant effects are original and frightening.  However, the plot is so muddled and irresolute that when it's all over, it's what did I just watch?  Didn't Bairstow kill the queen?  So what's that in the taxi?  Nice try but not as fulfilling as it should have been.",1084147200,3,980,4.86144578313253
1921195,4,B0000D0YVO,"This is a slick little film.  The B-Movie plot is backed up by location shooting and some high-grade special effects.
Three prospectors are out in the Namib desert.  They get an interesting reading that looks like a volcanic pipe but can't be.  While there si no hope of diamonds, they still check it out.  They find a large mound surrounded by poles, fetishes and other occult-looking warnings.  They break open the mound, one is sucked in, and the rest are not heard from again.
Meanwhile the company they work for is having some hostile-environment-survival software trouble.  The designer is sent against his will (he is a code man and not a field person).  He soon finds himself dropped in the middle of nowhere by a cab.
We quickly meet the rest of the cast that includes a militant who seems only interested in being mean enough to be hazardous to the operation.  The programmer also has a nifty new prototype device that can detect water from up to 100 feet away (""so will a good stick"" declares the militant).  The cast then sets out to find the missing guys from the movies opening and to deliver supplies to another facility.
Now that we have everyone alone in the desert, we can run into the title horror.  When the missing men have been found they look to have been dead for far longer than they have.  Then their bones are stolen.  The nifty water detector seems to react to the creatures presence.  It seems to be small things that pull together into a larger form around the bones they have stolen.
We later learn that the beasties seem to be ants and have been around and feared for a very long time.  The original victims had disturbed their nest and their queen.  They are now on the move to find a new safe location.
Many of the characters are very two-dimensional but that was expected.  Some are typical in this sort of movie, like the programmer who may be brilliant in the computer lab, but is totally helpless in the field.  We also have the tough truck driver and the take-charge female love-interest.
All in all it was a pretty well-done film with the plot being revealed steadily throughout the film.  The creature(s) was(were) interesting although the ending could have used a little more explanation when the cab returns to the middle of nowhere.  An original and fun movie.",1082332800,,2304,4.602941176470588
1921196,3,B0000D0YVO,"The prologue of ""Bone Snatcher"" begins with a scenic shot of the Namibia Desert in Africa.  3 Geologists on a special assignment are killed and sucked in to the earth by a mysterious force.  Meanwhile in Vancouver, British Columbia a young Canadian scientist is sent on a field research assignment to try to locate potential water sources in the desert.  As he arrives in the desert post, he is aided by a crew of five on their own mission, to relocate the 3 missing geologists.  As the crew etch further into the barren desert wasteland, their truck breaks down.  Panic mounts as the crew find out the desert is not as barren as they thought for there are creatures out there, creatures hungry for bones...
An interesting b-movie this certainly is, a South African and Canadian co-production shot entirely in the deserts of Africa.  Comparisons to films like ""Tremors"" and ""Pitch Black"" would not be unwarranted however this film reminded me most of ""Nemesis 2"", another good cheesy desert sci-fi film.  I was surprised at how slick the production of this film is, it looks polished and not as amateurish as I thought it would.  More like a quality late-night cable TV movie.  The cast are a likeable lot, especially actress Rachel Shelley, who I would most definitely like to see more of in the future.  The only character that annoyed was the main character, the Canadian scientist, who comes across as a total incompetent in his field and seems more preoccupied with surfing sand dunes and hitting on Rachel Shelley than doing his job.  The rest of the crew are actually better at drawing scientific conclusions than he is, but I guess this was probably an intentional thing, to have the comedic benefit of a character who thinks who knows it all staggering around like a clueless dope.
The movie really picks up speed once the crew are forced to abandon the safety of their supply-heavy truck and begin a slow treck by foot across the seemingly never-ending desert.  Typical of these types of movies, the crew start getting picked off one by one by mysterious creatures.  The creatures are certainly quite special to say the least, slimy packs of bones, with a skull for a head who all seem to be shaped differently one from another.  Whoever designed these creatures gets a nod in the originality department.  I have noticed many horror fans lament the use of CGI in modern films.  For the most part, I agree that gore effects are usually best left to qualified make-up effect artists than computers.  However, Bone Snatcher benefits greatly from CGI technology.  When the creatures suck the life out of victims, they grow meat to their bones; when they get shot, they disintegrate into a pile of jittery black sand.  The CGI effects that were used to translate these images to the screen look quite remarkable.  I heartily recommend ""Bone Snatcher"" although I will not pass it off as a great movie, it's too unintentionally dumb in many aspects for that but it certainly is a fun movie.  The scenic desert shots, the electronically-flavoured tribal music filled with African chants as well cool CGI monster effects are the best reasons to give ""Bone Snatcher"" a go.",1082073600,,3172,4.78348623853211
1921197,3,B0000D0YVO,"Okay, so this wasn't the greatest film I've ever seen, but I didn't expect it to be. The editing seemed patchy to me, and the dialog got tedious at times. So why three stars? Well, sure it's loaded with clich&eacute;s and plot holes, but the concept is pretty cool and seeing the monster(s) in action was fun -- very clever idea. Besides, half the fun of watching a cheesy horror film is in laughing at the inconsistencies -- for instance, it cracked me up to watch one of the actors very, very carefully remove a vial of nitroglycerin from its padded container, only to have the other actor (after carefully carefully closing the lid) toss it into the truck. Obviously, this is special horror film nitro, created to explode only in proximity to a monster.
I was particularly confused by one scene, which I am about to describe in detail, so if you want to watch the film, you might want to stop here.
Our Heroes are huddled around a dead tree, waiting for the Horrible Monster to appear. We hear it approaching, we see it (gasp! it's hideous!), it can't cross the barrier of gasoline Our Heroes created, but then it rears back and seems to fling killer ants OVER the barrier at Our Heroes! Yikes! Fade to black, cut to next scene as Our Heroes awaken, yawn, stretch, and everyone is fine. One of Our Heroes has even been sleeping while sprawled comfortably on the sand, away from the protection of the gasoline barrier. I was so confused that I watched the scene a couple more times. Where did the Horrible Monster go? What happened to the killer ants? Why the heck didn't the thing just step over the gasoline? Did it just run away? Perhaps the gesture that I interpreted as ant flinging was actually a fist shaking, ""oh if I could get over there you'd be SO eaten alive"" gesture of frustration. Ah, B-horror films, what would life be without you?",1079913600,,1849,4.522388059701493
1921198,5,B0000D0YVO,"Clearly Mariann has far too much time on her hands. She could me more usefully employed training rabbits to swim or something. Me? I enjoyed this cracking camp romp through the desert. Having spent large tracts of my childhood watching my socks and sandals father puring boiling water from an old grey whistling kettel (cf. Basil Brush - The Whistling Kettle and the something Cat - anyone? Somebody/ Somewhere? No. just me and Lazzwell and Dazzwell under the mystic spell of the singing fox and his liquid gold tonsils then) on winged ants on the one day of the year when they sprung from the cracked concrete yard in our home, I have always had a soft spot for termites and so was drawn to the film before I'd seen a frame of its deliciously unwholesome horror pop shots. My children squealed with pleasure beside me while we watched it, but that's another story. A thoroughly enjoyable way to spend your time : I have seen this film three times now and thought the porducer was so hot I married her. Live a little? Live a lotto? take the plunge with Bonesnatcher : it's a grower, it's a growler, it's a groover. So long Mariann.",1077494400,,1131,4.521951219512195
1921199,4,B0000D0YVO,"Kept me guessing, at least once the movie gets going. Some interesting character set up in the first 20 minutes or so and from then on a mix of mood, style, action and suspense with careful and very effective use of CG effects at different key points in the film. I've never seen a film set in the Namibian desert before and actually I hope I do again because this thing was gorgeous. Once or twice the writing felt a little tired but overall I've got no complaints. In fact I'd reccomend this film to anyone who likes to be scared for a couple of hours and wants to see some serious style as well. Plus some great music from a couple of Brit composers.",1072310400,3,653,4.232
1921200,4,B0000D0YVO,"I hadn't read much about this very slick film but I'm glad I caught it because it was a terrific couple of hours and in fact I'd love to see it again. First of all it's an original story idea but still works as a classic supernatural thriller horror kind of thing. Secondly you've got some great actors, quite a few new ones actually that I didn't recognize, and almost all of them give very convincing performances. And then of course you've got a load of action, special effects and good ol' scares all the way through. Basically its about some diamond prospectors who go missing and a security corps is dispatched out into the Namibian desert to find them. That's when everything starts to get crazy and slowly the situation gets out of control because of some kind of mythological and evil presence that's out there in the dunes. Some love stuff happens and then it's just down to three of them plus a pretty good climax down in an old abandoned mine.",1072310400,,955,4.494252873563219
1921231,3,B0000D0YVO,"Bone Snatcher, thankfully, is nothing like Bone Eater or Skeleton Man.  Bone Snatcher is essentially The Thing meets Pitch Black in the Nambi Desert.  Clive (Sean Higgs), Paul (Langley Kirkwood) and Harvey (Jan Ellis) begin the film as diamond prospectors who encounter the Esikulu AKA The Bone Snatcher.  They'll be back later in the film with considerably less flesh on their bones.

The movie shifts to Vancouver, where systems analyst Dr. Zack Straker (Scott Bairstow), tasked with doing field work in the desert.  Since Eland Mining owns the rights to the area, Straker tags along with a security team looking for the three prospectors.  There's hot chick Mikki (Rachel Shelly), Karl (Warrick Grier), Titus (Patrick Shai), Kurt (Andre Weiman) and tough gal Magda (Adrienne Pierce).

In between long shots of the desert, the truckload of victims' truck breaks down.  And you know what that means...cue the shooting and the screaming! The remaining survivors must figure out the creature's biology (hint: it involves chemical scents) and then track the queen to its lair so that it can never threaten humanity again.  Unless of course the obligatory ending leaves it open for a sequel, in which case it may well threaten humanity again.

Bone Snatcher reveals its hand early with a monster that looks like a guy loping around in a rubber suit...until you realize that's intentional.  On the surface Bone Snatcher doesn't look like much, but it gets under your skin.  Once the true nature of the thing is revealed it becomes clear that shooting at the thing isn't going to do much. The CGI effects are competent enough to convey that this thing only mimics the shape of a man...

Bone Snatcher's not going to win any awards in the acting department, but what it lacks in charm it makes up for with creativity.  Unforgiving terrain, plenty of testosterone, and an interesting beast make for a fun monster movie.",1295740800,,1912,4.952978056426332
1921232,3,B0000D0YVO,"Renting this from Blockbuster I had pretty low expectations, but I was pleasantly surprised. This movie isn't half-bad and in fact has a charm all its own.

I loved the sandy desert locale for this piece and felt genuinely creeped out by the isolation. Yeah, we've seen this storyline before but this perspective made for an interesting viewing.

The ""Bone-Snatcher"" looked pretty gnarley when he finally comes to light. The CGI wasn't too bad given the low-budget of the film. All other technical aspects of the film are all up to par and the acting is fairly decent for the most part.

While at times this movie is a bit hokey (that might be an understatement), it's still very entertaining and worth a rent.",1283990400,,710,4.709677419354839
1921233,1,B0000D0YVO,"The Bone Snatcher (Jason Wulfsohn, 2003)

It's kind of scary that I watch enough movies in a given week that I can come up with a solid ""best movie I saw this week"" and ""worst movie I saw this week"" (with at least three in the middle, usually six or seven) more weeks than not. This has actually been a kind of light week for me; I've only seen five so far since Saturday night (it's Tuesday afternoon as I write this). I must say, however, that I can't imagine I'm going to see anything stupider for the rest of the week than The Bone Snatcher, a no-budget laugher from South Africa that begs to be a Sci-Fi Channel Original Movie (whether it was or not I've no idea, I actually rented this). I'm not sure whether I ever codified it, but I'm doing so now. I have a new rule: when a film uses CGI blood splatter, if it looks like black fireflies, that movie is guaranteed to suck. (If you've seen a few of the aforementioned Sci-Fi Channel etc., then you know what I'm talking about. The same effect is also used to depict insect swarms.)

In any case, plot: three prospectors in the desert find something that seems as if it might be an abandoned diamond mine. One of them breaks open a bubble in the ground, exposing the tunnel to the light, and is summarily dispatched by, well, something. Fast-forward to the arrival of Zack Straker (Tuck Everlasting's Scott Bairstow) at the prospectors' base camp with some newfangled earth-analysis equipment. Since a team is getting ready to go out and look for the missing guys, he joins them. Long story short, the whole bunch find themselves stalked by whatever killed the guy in the opening scene. Karl (Shark Attack 2's Warrick Grier), the loudmouth of the group, is convinced it's some sort of wild animal, while Titus (Red Scorpion's Patrick Shai) thinks it's a local boogeyman. The team has to discover what it really is, while keeping themselves from ending up like the prospectors.

Terrible acting, a completely unconvincing (and underdeveloped) romantic subplot, a whole lot of stereotypical characters, and black-firefly blood spatter, what could possibly go wrong? On the other hand, what could possibly go right? This one hurt my head to watch. I suggest you avoid this miraculous migraine-inducer and watch something marginally less stupid, like maybe Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever. *",1260403200,,2337,4.723039215686274

The desert location sets the perfect tone of isolation / desparation. The characters make a good team, banding together to fight whatever is hunting them down and stripping their skeletons bare. What makes this movie better than most is the creature itself. Very different. I found the idea behind it to be extremely imaginative and downright scary. Plus, there's an interesting reason / purpose for the skeletonization of the victims that makes sense in the context of the story. These aren't just random deaths.

1921239,4,B0000D0YVO,"The Bone Snatcher is basically a story like all cheesy sci-fi movies - there's a creature killing people, and it needs to be stopped.  This time it's in the desert, there's a scientist, and the monster devours prety - beheading and cleaning the bone after each kill.  The acting, plot, and special effects are fairly good for this type of movie.

Replete with stunning desert visuals, completely riduculous electronics, and a monster that sees like the Predator, only worse and with a more rainbow huge, there is nearly no downside to this movie.  It's creepy good, and has a sort of better-than-B-movie feel to it.  Maybe it's a B+ movie?

Since the setting is South Africa, there is the mandatory witch doctor and voodoo angle, complete with a legendary tale about an ancient beast of some kind that takes life in exchange for immortality.  Apparently, the monster uses the bones of its victims to recreate life and walk around, like Lindsay Lohan.  Otherwise, it assumes a black ooze of some sort, like Whoopi Goldberg.

Well, the monster turns out to be a hive of ant-like things, a la Marabunta, and is controlled by some sort of pulsing, glowing brain, kind of like Starship Troopers.  It's afraid of gasoline, lives under ground (Pitch Black), and needs to keep killing.

OK, so the serious horror/sci-fi buff will recognise numerous hat-tips or rip-offs during the Bone Snatcher (Them, Alien, The Thing, Blair Witch, Forbidden Planet, Tremors and many more spring to mind), but it still pulls the right strings and certainly is a well-made, entertaining and memorable movie.

A sandy desolation is not an overused scenario for this genre and I found it made for a delightfully evocative and creepy backdrop to this hefty dollop of grand guignol gore.

The entity, being constructed from human remains is cadaverously grotesque when it finally makes an appearance, and its method of infecting the humans (especially the unfortunate Titus and the poor guy in the sleeping bag) is suitably nasty.

The pace of the move is spot on; an opening shock gives way to a measured section devoted to scene-setting and characterisation, before the real gore-fest begins.

Reasonable acting (although some of the testosterone-fuelled  posturing came over as a bit OTT) and the very non-Hollywood accents made for a refreshing change too!

Not bad at all!",1133049600,10,1083,5.22543352601156
1921252,3,B0000D0YVO,"Dr. Zack Straker (Scott Bairstow, ""Party of Five"") shows up from Canada to do some research at a mining camp in South Africa, but that becomes pretty irrelevant when a group of geologists searching for a diamond mine in the desert of Nambia disappear.  So Straker heads out to do search and rescue with the rest of the film's potential victims, Karl (Warrick Grier), Mikki (Rachel Shelley), Titus (Patrick Shai), Kurt (Andre Weidermen), and Magda (Adrienne Pearce).  They find the corpses of the three missing men and are stunned to discover the bodies have been reduced to virtual skeletons in just six hours.  Since we caught the title of the movie, we know that the culprit is ""The Bone Snatcher.""  Of course, this would make more sense if the creature took the bones and left the flesh, but do you want to sit through a film called ""The Flesh Snatcher""?

Actually, the South African title for this film, which also had backing from the UK and Canada, was ""Sandmother,"" which actually fits the plot better than ""The Bone Snatcher.""  I did not know that diamond mines were found in the desert, but the Nambia Desert is the home of some infamous diamond mines discovered in 1908.  But the titular creature of this 2003 is found beneath the beneath the sands and not in mine caves, although is she were expecting the relationship between the monster here and the sand to be similar to that between the shark and the water in ""Jaws,"" you will be sadly mistaken.  This is one of those horror movies where the mysterious monster shows up, people die, and the star of the movie explains the unexplainable before they kill the monster and he kisses the girl right before the fadeout.

The cinematography is pretty good for this film, which has an unusual problem in that it spends half the time trying to create a sense of horror in blinding bright light on the hot sands of a desert, which, you have to admit, stacks the odds against you.  But there are night sequences where things get more conventional.  Director Jason Wulfsohn does a more than competent job as long as you are not paying attention to the uninspiring acting by the cast playing out their stereotypical roles and the less than stellar CGI special effects.  This DVD has the trailer for the film but nothing else in terms of special features, which makes sense because this film is nothing special.  I never really got into it, not even to get some pleasure from taking it apart, although I did entertain rewriting the lyrics to the Monkees' song ""Star Collector"" to do the plot, but it was just not worth the effort.

Zack Straker, played by Scott Bairstow, is an engineer assigned to a remote mining camp in the South African desert.  On his way to camp, they find two bodies stripped of all their flesh.  Our band of characters start looking for the person or persons they think did these murders. All the while finding more stripped bodies on the trail they follow. All stripped of their flesh.

Needless to say I went in not expecting much. Although it wasn't scary it still wasn't a complete waste of time. The acting, while not extraordinary, is still believable. Although there is a lot of cliche to this movie. For instance, every horror movie always has that one person who defies good logic and chases whatever the movie is about, this has a guy like that. There's also always the guy who knows something about it and warns his friends/colleagues but they refuse to listen, this has a guy like that. Despite all of that though this is a pretty original movie, not necessarily good, but not bad.

The plot centers around Alex. He's a scientist who is called upon to venture to the desert despite his hatred for field-work. Skip forward about 15-20 minutes the group comes across some bones stripped of flesh. They recall hearing that a few prospectors went missing and come to the conclusion that these bones belong to at least one of them. The 'monster' in this is quite eery since you never get an extremely good look at him. Alex soon finds out what has killed the prospectors when he wakes up to find the 'monster' staring him dead in the face. The movie then wanders for a bit having the group come across another set of bones and an interesting run-in with some sand flies that resemble ants. They are then led to the creatures lair and chaos ensues, I use that term lightly by the way.

Overall this movie isn't ground-breaking by any means, just your typical run-of-the-mill horror movie that ceases to scare you in the least. Don't go into this movie thinking you're going to see some good special effects or gore, there isn't any. The bones stripped of flesh I mentioned earlier consists of red bones. The goriest part is when two members of the group are swarmed with the sand flies which eat their flesh, and even that's not enough to scare you. The reason this movie got three stars is because of Scott Bairstow and Rachel Shelley. These two are the only ones holding together this less than stellar plot.",1108944000,3,2172,4.552429667519181
1921257,3,B0000D0YVO,"The premise for The Bone Snatcher is farfetched, of course, but imaginative.  Ant-like creatures that eat human flesh, then join the bones together and walk like a man.  Which is the more frightening, small creatures in swarms, or a walking skeleton, is debatable.  The execution of the story is better than expected.  The development of the characters isn't bad.  Although definitely a ""B"" movie, this one does make it possible to suspend one's disbelief, even if for a short while.",1106956800,,483,4.9875
1921258,1,B0000D0YVO,"At first I thought the words ""The Bone Snatcher"" applied to my nine year old dog Charley and his propensity to get a little impatient when I offer him a treat. Then I suddenly remembered I don't have a nine year old dog named Charley. Oh well. I do have a nine year old cat but he shows little interest in old bones. He does, however, show an inordinate amount of interest in the bones in my hands and legs since he's spent his entire life trying to peel the flesh away to get at them. Alas, I digress. ""The Bone Snatcher"" is a movie shot in South Africa, specifically the Namib Desert region. I'm a bit leery of films made by South Africans or in South Africa since I witnessed a horror film going under the name of ""Slash"" last year on the Fourth of July. That film was also South African in origin, and it wasn't very good. In fact, it was far less than good and far less than original. It starred Steve Railsback, usually a good character actor and quite friendly to the horror genre. He was about the only good thing in ""Slash,"" now that I think about it. Again, I apologize for drifting off topic; I needed something to flesh this review out. ""Pad"" might be a better word.

""The Bone Snatcher"" sees a Canadian scientist named Zack (Scott Bairstow) sent on a useless mission to South Africa by his boss. So far so good. The problem with this mission concerns a group of diamond hunters who disappear in the desert after discovering some strange cone shaped structure in the sand. Predictably, one of these lunkheads cracks a big hole in this thing, sticks his head in to take a good look around, and something (we don't see what) leaps out at him. Scary, or so the filmmakers hope. Then Dr. Zack arrives on the scene to do his...er...thing. Right from the start he meets up with a bunch of uniformed goons ostensibly working for his employer, guys that make the inmates in ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" look like senior fellows at a think tank. ""The Bone Snatcher"" presents us with tough guy Karl (Warrick Grier), a beautiful British scientist named Mikki (Rachel Shelley), a taciturn fraulein called Magda (Adrienne Pearce), a superstitious black guy referred to as Titus (Patrick Shal), and Kurt (Andre Weideman). A fun bunch, this group. Before Zack can even get around to introducing himself, a fight breaks out between two of these guys over some mundane relationship issue. It's obvious they've spent far too much time filling their buckets with sand, and Zack's caught right in the middle.

The missing diamond hunters inspire this group to head out on a rescue mission, which means Zack must come along for the ride. Have you ever seen a film about a road trip through the desert? The whole film? Sure, the scenery looks cool to those of us unaccustomed to such arid climes, but a big truck filled with Type A meatheads grinding along a deserted desert road becomes an exercise in staring at the old wristwatch faster than you can say, ""When is this thing gonna end?"" Before you can say, ""I'll bet the truck breaks down,"" the truck breaks down. This is usually a sign that the hostilities are about to begin, or so I hoped. Sure enough, someone stumbles over heaps of human bones in the desert. And soon thereafter, the group puts two and two together and figures out that the diamond miners bit the bullet. What they can't figure out is how the flesh disappeared so quickly. Enter superstitious black guy Titus, who begins mumbling a bunch of bunkum about some old desert entity that uses bones to actualize a physical presence. Of course, he signed his death warrant as soon as he imparted his arcane knowledge to the rest of the group because this very creature emerges out of the desert to wreak havoc on our merry band of Alpha males. Zack and the survivors must battle this monster, find its lair, and wipe it out using only their wits (a tall task for this group of rocket scientists)

Actually, ""The Bone Snatcher"" isn't a total loss. The gore scenes, involving a melted arm and other assorted nasty stuff, looks pretty good for such a low budget production. Unfortunately, there isn't enough sauce to save the picture. First, the CGI effects used to depict the bone snatcher just don't pass muster. In fact, they look incredibly cheesy and cheap. Second, the performances are at best lackluster and at worst lackluster. Throwing in Rachel Shelley as the obligatory eye candy certainly helps, but not enough to draw my eyes away from the testosterone fueled antics exhibited by Karl and the others. However, bad performances aren't enough to sink a film in the view of this schlock lover, and the acting chops on display here aren't nearly as bad as the atrocities I've witnessed in hundreds of other films. Third, and finally, the movie is boring because the pacing lags horribly. I felt like I could have read the collected works of Leo Tolstoy and Vladimir Lenin in the time it took me to watch ""The Bone Snatcher."" This baby just didn't move the way a horror movie ought to move.

Trailers for ""The Bone Snatcher,"" ""Between Strangers,"" and ""Hollywood North"" are the lone extras on this disc. I feel I can only recommend ""The Bone Snatcher"" to lovers of crud cinema, although it's entirely possible other audiences could see a few things worth watching here. Overall, I think I can live with myself giving the flick two stars since the gore and Rachel Shelley do give it a nudge in the right direction. At least I hope I can live with myself...",1105660800,2,5472,4.5920245398773005
1921259,3,B0000D0YVO,"I was pleasantly surprised by this movie.  My expectation for watching this was to suffer through bad acting and bad storyline just to get to ""the monster"".  By setting the story in the desert, the production value was spent on the CGI monster and better actors than I thought would appear in a movie like this.  To be sure, this is a ""B movie"", but it performs as well as some of hollywood's mainstream offerings.  The cast are all Australian/British and unlike Mad Max or Crocodile Dundee do not have super ""over-the-top"" personalities. The other movies tend to make you focus on the accents and mannerisms in an attempt to add some value to their storyline.  The plot is pretty straightforward: Specualtors in the desert uncover something nasty and get killed.  Some reseachers happen upon them and then the fun begins...  There are only one or two ""cliche"" moments in this movie, (the awkward boy-girl kiss) & (""i can't kill the monster, I'm a scientist and I must STUDY it"" *hoofa*) which is why I have to ding it a star, otherwise I'd have given this movie 4 stars, by simply over-achieving on a low budget.  I recommend it for renting or if you have 5 bucks burning a hole in your pocket at the DVD discount rack.",1102464000,10,1220,4.564220183486238
8000022,3,B0000D0YVO,"A couple of diamond prospectors are tapping around on hard places when one actually caves in. Naturally he has to look inside and you can guess who disappears.

Mean time Dr. Zack Straker (Scott Bairstow) shows up and has fun learning the culture and different quirks of the employees of a local mine consortium.

They run into the empty pit and signs of the missing prospectors. We also are reminded that on Zack arrival we see a mysterious native with a strange fetish. Evidently there is more to the story than some missing people. To add to the mix is the beautiful Mikki (Rachel Shelley) to add to the potential love angle.

There may be something ancient that snatches bones for nefarious purposes or is it all one big bugaboo?",1504915200,,733,4.623076923076923
