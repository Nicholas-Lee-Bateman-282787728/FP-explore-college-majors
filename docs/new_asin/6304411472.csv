864582,5,6304411472,"Undercover Blues is one of those movies that are the first of its genera; so you are pleasantly surprised the first time you view it. Later you will want to view this movie again to pick up on the hints that tell you what is to come next.

Kathleen Turner and Dennis Quaid are the perfect couple on maternity leave in New Orleans. They do everything together and even involve their baby daughter (Louise Jane or Jane Louise.) They are so perfect that the local bad guy (Stanley Tucci) is constantly trying to get even with them. They are so perfect that the local authorities suspect them of being there on business. Are they and what business might that be?

This movie has lots of action and takes many unexpected turns. It is tightly made and every action has implications later in the movie. Oh, did I mention that it is down right funny?",1502928000,,842,4.461038961038961

864839,4,6304411472,"Had never heard of this one before coming across the DVD, it looked interesting so I gave it a go.  It's definitely not a believable movie, but it's not at any time trying to be, and it's definitely a lot of fun!  As soon as two street thugs pick the wrong victim with their extremely low act of robbing at knife point a father pushing a baby in a stroller, and get humiliated by the father, I knew this was just going to be sheer fun!  The only thing I didn't like was Larry Miller's police character having a speech impediment, which didn't add anything to the film, other than making him hard to understand.  He wasn't funny, if they'd got an actor who actually has a disability in real life that would have been fine, but they didn't and not being able to understand him played no part in the plot.  I loved seeing a younger Obba Babatund&eacute; (for stuff I've seen him in) who is a fun character, everything I've seen him in he is a serious grumpy angry the world has let him down and owes him character, so it was refreshing seeing him in as the main New Orleans police officer character.

Kathleen Turner and Dennis Quaid are quite good as a young couple with a newborn, who used to be top secret agents, and are not about to let a street thug who wants vengeance interrupt their daily outings or hotel stay. It's a bit hard not thinking of them as older, since they are both still going strong appearing in stuff today, but they make their roles pretty fun.  Undercover Blues hit the screens in 1993 but it's still a lot of fun to watch today!",1483920000,,1553,4.2979452054794525
864840,5,6304411472,Great older movie.  We had this on VHS and watched it many times.  Wife got it as a Christmas present and we enjoyed watching it again on our projection system.,1483660800,,160,4.3

864883,5,6304411472,I really enjoyed this film.  The actors are great and the comedy between the two and other actors is wonderful.  It felt as if Kathleen Turner and Dennis Quaid were really married in real life because the chemistry between them is so realistic.  They are very resourceful at thinking on their toes and making split decisions quickly.  The plot is great and the comedic action will keep you interested all the way through.  The action builds up nicely for a terrific ending.  I would definitely recommend this film.  It will remind you of other comedic crime capers such as I Love Trouble with Julia Roberts and Nick Nolte.,1479945600,3,622,4.703703703703703

On the technical side they did a good job fixing the resolution on this blue-ray, where the DVD was a disappointment (Bad DVD Editor, bad, go sit in a corner), this one was great. Some folks mentioned that there was some issues with stock shots getting integrated, maybe, but I did not spot any of those problems, and neither did any of my  family (repeat viewing) and the couple friends (first time viewers) who watched this with me.

The Blues are a married couple who are trying to have a normal family life with their new baby, but their government employer keeps asking them to take on spy missions.  They are on vacation, when the local police catch wind that they may be on some government mission and choose to keep their eyes on them.  Meanwhile a local thug named Morte (for ""death"") keeps trying to mug or attack them (mostly because of wounded pride,) but the Blues are too skilled for him, so he is in over his head.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Undercover-Blues/dp/B016BSROJO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Undercover Blues</a>",1466812800,2,692,5.4485981308411215

865565,5,6304411472,"EDIT BELOW: I finally got mine and gave it a watch (I give some Video & Audio Details in the EDIT section below).
ORIGINAL TITLE:
""This twenty @ BB or thirty @ Amaz pre-order price is a JOKE.  I have very fond memories of this movie, but that's insane!""

Pre-order pricing on this movie is RIDICULOUSLY INFLATED!  This is a four to five doll-hairs price Blu-ray in the end.  I understand there are costs involved in bringing these old titles to life on Blu-ray, but this is gouging territory by leaps and bounds.  Ten to Twelve buxs NEW at release would be doable for some.  So tired of these money grabs.  They want more than the brand new Avengers 3D-2D+Digital Copy released for and that was over priced, this is well just silly.  Moving on.

On to the movie.  It's a silly light heart-ed comedy with a little thrill in there for some extra fun.
My Name is... My name is .....  (No real SPOILERs) if you have seen it then you know the missing words likely by heart.  It is my favorite line of the movie and has been stuck in my head ever since I first saw it.  It's not command performances by any of the actors nor does it pretend to be; it's just pure juvenile escapism that adults should give themselves permission to enjoy once in a while.  Kathleen Turner and Dennis Quaid made a believable pairing as a Husband and Wife CIA couple on a ""vacation.""
The movie isn't going to make you think or leave you with any un-answered questions.  It has running gags through out the movie and plenty of fun that should be suitable for the whole family (I don't remember anything naughty or ultra violent though memories can be tricky).  I look forward to owning this movie again if the price gets over it-self in a hurry.

EDIT: Finally got the movie in my hands and gave it a watch.

Overall: The Video quality is a good upgrade over the DVD SD run for sure (as one would hope & frankly expect).  Throughout the movie there are scenes where you get close ups of characters & extras' faces and you can really see the detail (pores, blemishes etc.).  On that end of things, its a very pleasant upgrade over the SD to the original film's high definition.  It's not too grainy with too much sharp detail nor is it dull or lacking in detail.
STILL ON VIDEO QUALITY: However, and this is quite noticeable (most noticeable) in the very first scene where the extras are dancing there is an extraordinary amount of film debris and defects in the film frames on the screen.  Including hairs, spots (some dark black some white), little sections of frames of the film that are missing (light pass through) or if there was processing failures they made some tremendous mistakes.  I have A.D.D. so to me it's like a hungry hawk seeing a field mouse darting about just10 feet away; it got so distracting that I paused the film and began going frame by frame just to see how bad things were.  I am not trying to be a film snob, just reporting that I got that OH NO feeling there for a brief time.
With that said once the main characters came on the screen and the dialogue began that video noise & interference seemed to go away.  I was intent on NOT letting distractions ruin this film or purchase for me, but at this point I believe that the worst was just in the beginning scene as I mentioned and that they did a much better job throughout the rest of the film.  Like going from a D- to a B+/A-.  It's almost as if they simply didn't bother fixing that first scene.  Who knows maybe [Olive] felt it was a really un-important scene/(s).  During most of the movie I DID NOT notice very many spots or film issues, the movie had taken hold of me and I was immersed once again like a one sided conversation with an old friend I hadn't seen in a long time.  Only on a rare few occasions did anything pop off and ever so briefly catch my attention but it was not a cascade like in the first scene these were separated/isolated video events.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:
I was disappointed that the ONLY audio track was 2Ch audio.  This movie's audio was originally was done by a subsidiary of LucasArts... it wasn't THX certified (nor did it need to be it is for the most part a 90% dialogue movie) however 5.1 Dolby Digital would have helped with the immersion into the film and with some of the action sequences at the very least.  The 2Ch audio was very clear and the dialogue was easy to hear & more importantly understand throughout the movie.  So although I was slightly disappointed the important part of this movie which is the dialogue and banter is there with no issues and that along with the improvements in video quality make this a pleasant watch on blu-ray.
I am more than disappointed that there isn't any Closed Captioning what so ever on the disc this can be done without adding any cost to a movie through sponsorship and it's frankly inexcusable on any releases.",1444780800,5,4851,4.395296752519597

Here's the thing - given all the martial arts training, which, as everyone knows, is meticulous, and given the care given in movies to non-human animals, etc., why was the baby allowed to slip and slide through a mess of clutter on the floor, and with parent close by - most likely cut into the movie - but even the industrial sites in this movie are meticulously clean.  So, here's the baby taking first steps, and instead of getting up on her always-seen long legs, and moving the crap out of the way so the baby doesn't slip and hurt herself, she grabs a camera.

865941,5,6304411472,"This DVD is difficult to find. There must have been a limited release of the DVD back in the 90s. It got poor reviews, I guess at a time when movie-goers wanted hard action and deep thought. This is NOT that kind of film. It is a very light comedy.

In this viewer's opinion, the charm of it eclipses any continuity or other problems.

This is one of those films I would watch over and over. I already had the DVD but ordered another to share with some friends.
Dennis Quaid and Kathleen Turner play very well together. Their interplay and banter is reminiscent of the romantic screwball comedies of the 40s.

Gotta give props to Stanley Tucci. I have seen him in so many roles, he is truly a wide-ranging character actor. In this, he plays ""Muerte"", a street thug who preys on NOLA tourists. The Blues view him as a minor annoyance, and actually get some use out of him.

It would be interesting to see the Blues now, retired, leading a ""quiet"" life. Louise Jane (or is it Jane Louise?), the infant in the 1993 film, should be a big girl now, and with the training and encouragement of Mom and Dad could probably do just about anything.",1407024000,2,1137,4.374407582938389

Kathleen Turner & Dennis Quaid are at their best in this film as spies, who have now retired because they decided to start a family. Vacationing in New Orleans trying to keep a low-profile as a ""average"" couple they soon find themselves recruited for one more job... Stanley Tucci steals every scene as ""Muerte""- the local, unrelenting petty thief, out to get Quaid's wallet and get revenge for spoiling his attempts to rob him. Look for Dave Chappelle in a early acting role as ""Muerte's"" partner. EVERYONE in the supporting cast is excellent & contribute in a big way in making this movie as fantastic as it is.

If you hate slapstick humor - no matter how funny you probably won't like this. However, if you enjoy cleverly done slapstick you will enjoy Stanley Tucci's characterization of the incredibly inept ""Muerte."" It portrays a husband and wife CIA team - Kathleen Turner and Dennis Quaid -  enjoying a vacation with their baby daughter in New Orleans.  The dialogue is clever.  The action sequences are well thought out and choreographed. ""Muerte's obsession with getting his revenge on the Quaid - Turner characters simply displays his increasing ineptitude and frustration.

I am not usually a fan of action movies, but this one is not only an action movie, but a very funny comedy with a bit of romance thrown in.  It should appeal to both men and women.  It is not a chick flick.  I love the relationship between the main characters played by Dennis Quaid and Kathleen Turner.  This movie was my first introduction to Stanley Tucci.

866736,4,6304411472,"Take Kathleen Turner's sex appeal and Dennis Quaid's roguish grin, then Stanley Tucci's hilarious turn and the sheer enchanting cuteness of the baby, and, okay, the movie's premise - and what you get are the saving graces of UNDERCOVER BLUES. It's an interesting take, what this movie's going for. In pairing up Quaid and Turner - both of whom have dialed up the charm - the flick strives for that witty, urbane Nick & Nora Charles chemistry. And your buying into it (or not) depends on whether you can keep in mind that UNDERCOVER BLUES is intentionally shooting for farce, and not so much with the believability.

Just a reminder that before Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt brought the sexy to the beautiful but deadly married couple thing in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mr-Mrs-Smith-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000AP04FG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mr. & Mrs. Smith (Widescreen Edition)</a>, Kathleen Turner and Dennis Quaid were there first. Jeff and Jane Blue are American secret agents who are holidaying in New Orleans, on an 18-month leave from the espionage game and cooing over their months-old baby daughter. But the Blues are called back into action when an old adversary gets her hands on a supersecret plastic explosive device, and I kind of dig that they take on the mission, not out of some sense of patriotism, but for bonus pay and an extended maternity leave. Toss in two persistent but out-of-their league New Orleans cops who suss out that there's something peculiar about the Blues and also a bumbling petty thief brandishing a disproportionately grandiose demeanor and who keeps trying to take out Jeff Blue, and it's still not enough to make our deliriously happy, ultra-competent couple work up a sweat.

I think that Turner and Quaid play off each other beautifully, despite that there isn't much character depth or development and that the repartee given isn't as sparkling as the writers of the screenplay would have you think. But the easy-going appeal of the leads pushes aside those shortcomings. This is the sort of film which lets you know early on that there's no need to get concerned about the protagonists. There's not a lot here that's entrenched in reality. No one dies, or no one important anyway. The tone here is so determinedly breezy and arched that whatever potential gravitas there is is rendered inconsequential. There's only one scene, really, in which the Blues' unflappability wavers, and then it's only a fleeting moment (and, as it turns out, part of the plan).

- Stanley Tucci's character, about to mug Jeff Blue: ""My name... is Muerte!""
- Jeff Blue: ""I'm pleased to meet you, Morty. My name is Jeff.""

There's a peppering of familiar faces, but Stanley Tucci easily stands out from the crowd. Tucci's talent for physical comedy (which I didn't know he had) is on full display here. Tucci's character, that poor sap, in dogged pursuit of payback, just keeps on taking his lumps. But the howlingly funny parts simply have to be whenever he lets out that girly squeal. Some of the sorry stuff that happens to him, it reminds me of what those crooks in HOME ALONE went thru. Saul Rubinek and an underused Tom Arnold also pop up, as does an extremely annoying and lispy Larry Miller.

Some of the comedy works; there are some pretty good one-liners. Tucci, as mentioned, is hilarious. I bought into Quaid and Turner as two secret agents in love, and they have the physicality and athleticism to pull off the action sequences. As for the Blues' constant sheer disregard for all possible threats and the fact that they persist in bringing their baby along in their investigations, I did have to remind myself a time or two that, hey, this is meant to be a farce and not a serious thriller grounded in reality. Going back to one element in the six Thin Man whodunit films, Nick and Nora Charles in many of their scenes together acted as if no else in the room mattered, partly because they were so in love and partly because the supporting character seemed interchangeable (the cops, the villains, the suspects) and so weren't worth taking seriously. Turner and Quaid affect this same obliviousness, and their nonchalance is so marked that at times there's a chance of a disconnect between the film and the viewer. So, keep in mind - farce.",1254009600,3,4325,4.96
866737,4,6304411472,"There are enough laughs to make this worth seeing. There are enough odd characters, too. That's no surprise when you see the supporting cast: Stanley Tucci, Larry Miller, Fiona Shaw and Tom Arnold. All of them put added spark to the film.

Tucci, as ""Meurte,"" is most obvious as he continually tries to mug the leading couple, played by Kathleen Turner and Dennis Quaid. Miller plays a weird cop with a lisp and a very weird accent. I guess you could call this movie ""quirky.""

Turner and Quaid are so smug as modern-day Nick and Nora Charles, you want to root for ""Muerte"" to succeed. Frankly, I never found Turner, except perhaps in ""Body Heat,"" to be that alluring. However, I think she is an underrated comedienne.

As a whole, this comedy is a little rough in spots, hence the PG-13 rating which often means more profanity than R-rated films. This is not for the kiddies, but adults will laugh.",1245628800,,899,4.60625

866784,4,6304411472,"1993's ""Undercover Blues"" pairs up Dennis Quaid and Kathleen Turner as recently retired spies and new parents, on maternity leave in New Orleans.  Their characters seem unable, however, to avoid muggers, run-ins with skeptical police, and their former bosses, who want them to do one last mission.  Despite their best efforts, they become enmeshed in an arms smuggling plot while juggling child care and the local police, who think they are criminals.

Lest this seem like a less than promising storyline, execution is everything.  A persistant but hapless mugger, played to perfection by Stanley Tucci, tries to be a tough guy but repeatedly falls prey to the superior skills of Quaid and Turner and to his own clumsiness.  Quaid and Turner thmeselves seem to a practiced routine down for every form of danger, from generating an instant but convincing cover story for each encounter with the police, to fending off muggers with martial arts and a baby carriage, to derailing the arms smuggling plot with comedic finese.  Tom Arnold adds to the comedy in a nice supporting role.

However the idea od retirement  cant keep good agents down, especially when Muerte (Great comic relief by Stanley Tucci) keeps trying to kill the Blues. Character actors Tom Arnold & Park Overall play friends who don't know the Blues are spies.

You get a married couple, who actually love each other, where a slightly older women catches a younger man and they decide to focus on their family. Oh how horrible!!!

Kathleen Turner and Dennis Quaid (definitely under-rated) are likeable with great chemistry. Stanely Tucci steals each scene he is in with his desparate desire to be considered ""Death"".

Yes, the story line could have been a tad tighter.  However, this is one time where the actors rose of above the material and delivered a Gem!

The movie also benefits from some great supporting actors: Dave Chappelle as Muerte's side kick, Larry Miller as the patsy's patsy and Fiona Shaw as the villaness. A toned down Tom Arnold appears with Park Overall as tourists who shares their vacation with the Blues.

866869,3,6304411472,"There isn't an actor in Hollywood more underrated than Dennis Quaid.  His chracterisation skills and ability to express emotion are incredible.  He's good eye-candy too.  So why he is constantly handed second-class roles to second-class films remains a mystery to me.

I was prepared to love ""Undercover Blues"".  The film featured a hard-working cast, some wonderful comic tones, a reasonably interesting plot, and great New Orleans location shots and local color.

The film became tiresome about 45 minutes through for me due to the constant pervasive feminist statements delivered with all the subtlety of a sledge hammer.

Some reviewers have complained that Turner seems too old for Quaid.  I agree that she does and that it's actually a positive for creating the convincing partnership between them.  Jane is the dominant spouse, clearly more skilled in the workplace as well as in worldly wisdom while Jefferson is more her sidekick, prone to screwing up in a charming good-natured and pacifist fashion.  In this clear case of reversal of traditional marriage roles it makes sense for Jane to be older (or at least to seem older.)

It becomes more and more irksome, however, as one discovers that all the mistakes (poor planning, endangerment, forgetting infant formula, etc.) can be attributed to Jefferson whereas Jane is literally Miss Perfect.  In fact, all the male characters are consistently depicted as overly serious, ""no fun,"" workaholic, incompetent types.  The exceptions are Jefferson Blue and one effeminate lisping police officer.

The film seems like a corny take-off on earlier crime films where the female lead is depicted as ridiculous and silly next to the action hero/leading man.  The problem is this film is just as annoying as those films were and for the same reasons except in reverse.  Instead of depicting women as chronically silly and inept the males are being bashed for it.

Not even the excellent chemistry between the leads and the interesting supporting characters can make up for those unfortunate tendencies or for the typical error of not-in-the-know writers and directors who like using New Orleans as a setting.  Anyone who has visited or lived in New Orleans knows the locals do not use the honeyed drawl common in most of the South.  (For a more realistic portrayal of various New Orleans accents check out ""The Big Easy."")  Nor are cafe au lait and beignets sold in the Meditarranean Cafe.  They are served in the Cafe du Monde two blocks further down Decatur Street.

The film is laughable (at times for better reasons than others) and I give it three stars for casting, cinematography, and storyline which is genuinely funny.  The over-the-top men-bashing took some of the fun out of it for me, however, and I'm not even a man.  Enjoy!",1136419200,4,2786,5.032751091703057

Stanley Tucci as ""Morty"" steals the show as a ne'er do well thug out for revenge while Larry Miller with his comic southern accent holds his own as an out-of-the-know Nawlins dectective.  Watch out for the seen with Saul Rubinek as Turner & Quaid talk over his head.  Some gags, like the bank van go ridiculously over the top, but it's supposed to be a fun movie, not for deep thinking!

You rarely see this movie mentioned by them or by people who write about them. But yet, this small movie proves to be highly entertaining, fun to watch and I enjoyed the rapport between the two leads.

You can probably classified this as ""action comedy"" movie and both plays a huge part in making it work. Stanley Tucci who played the local thug virtually steal the movie whenever he appears, often playing the fall guy in each and every occasion. Unlike the previous reviewer, I thought there was pretty good chemisty between Turner and Quaid and they played up to their ""happily married couple"" routine very nicely. Both played a government super spies, on vacation but called back to duty to recovered some nasty high explosives. They are follow by Stanley Tucci who want revenge on them so badly that he ends up praying to God for assistence...that an irony of a scene. And couple of New Orleans' finest also trail them as well thinking they are up to no good. Its a fun, action packed movie as Quaid and Turner goes the movie being bit smug and all together very happy.

Well directed and well acted, the script isn't very good and the story can be considered bit weak. I mean what pair of New Orlean's police force have that much time trailing two person who basically haven't broken any law?? But overall, this is fun movie, its weaknesses can be overlooked because the movie is entertaining to watch.

The DVD issue of this movie was a so-so effort. The anamorphic widescreen image quality is decent but not exceptional. It also come with full screen option as well. No extras to speak of, only a movie trailer. The sound is basic stereo, no 5.1 DD or anything like that. Overall, a super basic DVD issue of this movie.",1120176000,4,1831,4.576219512195122
866936,1,6304411472,"The reviews were so good we bought this. We all agreed it was a major disappointment. It obviously depends very much on your comedic taste. So as a balance to other reviews:

Kathleen Turner looks far too old for Dennis Quaid so there is a visual jarring that makes it unbelievable these two ever got togather. They have less that zero chemistry. I think they were going for 'fun banter' as in older romantic comedies. This seemed to mean throwing lines at each other while maintaining a fixed silly smile. They had the remarkable ability to hug or say 'I love you' as if commenting on the weather (and with less passion).

I wasn't sure whether they were going for 'supremely confident' with Dennis as he walks through his fight scenes or for grinning sociopath (which if it hadnt been a comedy it could have looked). Perhaps he was doing a Harrison Ford type cynicism but if so it didn't have enough dimension to come off.

The addition of the baby didn't work for us. It is hard to mix 'cute and fragile' with the potential for violence that the baby is walking into.

Stanley Tucci is very good but forced to play one-note slapstick.

The police offsider puts on an irritating 'south with a lisp' accent that makes it hard to understand his lines at times and again sounds silly. Was the lisp meant to be funny in itself?This was not the finest moment for Kathleen or Dennis (who we have liked in other movies) and we found it unfunny.

As many other reviewers found it otherwise, I'd advise trying to view it before you buy it - or be prepared to toss it if it isn't you - as we have.",1118966400,,1589,4.406143344709897
866937,5,6304411472,"This movie is so good, I feel compelled to dedicate to it my first Amazon review ever. The majority of the other reviewers are right about this little gem; it is a totally underrated sleeper hit, and I believe the only reason it didn't get much attention at the box office is that it was overshadowed by the cinematic giant known as ""Jurassic Park"" (1993). Seriously!

This film is both smart and silly, in all the best ways. The dialog is witty, and both Quaid and Turner exude confidence and charm, yet they are not plastic or artificial. They both have real concern for the other's safety and wellbeing, and especially that of their baby daughter (who is adorable!).

Plus, it features something rare in modern entertaiment: A married couple who love each other passionately and are extremely attracted to eachother, don't cheat on eachother or fight with each other (except for the occasional playfully bantering disagreement), and who just generally display a positive attitude toward married and parental life! This is a concept that Hollywood should explore and celebrate! (Please pardon my little happy rant.) ^_^;

And then there's Muerte (or Morty, as the Blues like to call him). Stanley Tucci very nearly steals the show with his comedic performance, which provides a perfect slapstic counterpoint to the Blues' confident composure and snappy banter.

If there are any caveats to this film, they would be the single use of the f-word (Which alone is responsible for the PG-13 rating) and the somewhat foul mouth of the police detective (frequent exclamations of ""God-D*mn!""). Also, there is bit of suggestive flirting between Mr and Mrs Blue that references their love-life, but it's actually rather refreshing to see this in a married couple on screen.

All that said, rent or Buy this movie (especially now that it's on DVD)! Undercover Blues is at the very least enjoyable, and I wish it could have had a sequal!

866938,4,6304411472,"I love this movie, and it is with great reluctance that I'm rating the DVD with fewer than five stars. However, it seems that little work was done digitally mastering the film: there's a lot of grain and artifacting on the DVD (to be fair, the VHS doesn't look great either, but the blur of the tape reduces the grain in the image; on the DVD you get nice, crisp speckles and blotches). Basically this is a 5-star movie with 2-star production values, split the difference and round up, you get four stars.
The plot provides a so-so post-Cold War backdrop for the actors to do their thing. There hasn't been such a breezy, fun-loving, crime-fighting couple since Nick and Nora Charles. Dennis Quaid's dazzling smile and cheeky attitude brighten up the film, and Kathleen Turner provides a street- and book-smart turn as the brains of the operation. Add in Larry Miller's supporting role as the lisping, soft-spoken Detective Sgt. Halsey (that'th eth-ee-why, not eth-why), Stanley Tucci's shrieking tough guy, Muerte, and Fiona Shaw's devilish Paulina Novacek and you've got ninety minutes of comedic gold.
Unfortunately, along with the straight-from-video transfer, no expense was spent in providing extras on the DVD. There are a handful of trailers and that's about it. The menu screens look good, but if you go to a restaurant and the best thing you can say about it is ""nice menus,"" odds are you won't be eating there very often. That's a shame really, because this is a good movie that's getting a raw deal from poor packaging and a lousy transfer.
If a remastered version of this disc comes out - with or without all the bells and whistles in the bonus department - swoop on it without delay. In the meantime, VHS is actually your best bet: the film's flaws aren't as noticeable and you've been making allowances for such things for years now anyway.",1074902400,3,1855,4.781931464174455

Dennis Quaid and Kathleen Turner have a wonderful chemistry as Jeff and Jane Blue, Fiona Shaw is perfect as the evil Novacek, Obba Babbatunde and Larry Miller are delightful as the hapless detectives, Park Overall and Tom Arnold are great as the ""normal"" couple, and Stanly Tucci absolutely steals every scene as Muerte (""as in Death"") the would-be mugger.

I bought this movie to watch the likes of Bacalique Kathleen Turner and that movie star, Quaid. I saw them--with a baby to tend-- try to stage a spy-comedy story, but strangely the outcome reminded me of 101 Dalmations.  REALLY! Lucky for an audience was this comic character, Stanley Tucci, who stole the show. Otherwise, Turner and Quaid--CIA Undercover--were too, too suave for spy characters.  Their James Bond quip comedy lines just didn't work. Here is another movie that couldn't make up its' mind: is it  a comedy, drama, suspense, mystery, n'importe quoi kind of story.  Nevertheless, for all of its' flaws, UNDERCOVER moves along and keeps your attention. You are going to laugh somewhere along the line.  And keep your eye out for Cruella.

Dennis Quaid and Kathleen Turner are terrific and the supporting cast is hilarious, too. Morty/Muerte is a riot and the ending is perfect. With the exception of one use of the f-word, there's nothing objectionable since most of the violence is somewhat light-hearted, from the stroller self-defense right down to the mud-fight at the end.

Most movies these days find themselves stuck in a single genre.  Action films are one explosion and gun fight after another. Comedies are becoming dry with many punch lines, but a lack of setup.  I'm sorry but it seems like Hollywood is running out of ideas...
""Undercover Blues"" is a espionage comedy like no other.  It blends action and adventure with the class and wit of a truly great comedy.  Kathleen Turner and Dennis Quaid (Jane and Jeff Blue) are a hilariously unstoppable duo trying to stop an eccentric international criminal mastermind and recover the world's most dangerous plastic explosives, C-22. While at the same time, trying to raise their year old daughter.
Along with the couple's wit and charm, Stanley Tucci plays a ""feared"" street thug who is constantly stopped by the Blues with little effort and plenty of laughs.
""Undercover Blues"" may not be the greatest film of all time, but it is a fantastically fun movie, and defiantly a great film to own and treasure for years to come.",993513600,5,1007,4.803468208092486
867107,4,6304411472,"Watch ""Undercover Blues"" and meet an amiable husband and wife spy team (played by Turner and Quaid) who are on leave in New Orleans soon after the birth of their first child.  Turner is a crack shot and master of disguise, and Quaid is, well, he's just a bit cracked.  Along the way Quaid meets up with a local wanna-be bad guy (played by Tucci - the hidden jewel of the movie!) who calls himself ""Muerte,"" and their paths continue to cross throughout the movie.  The scenes with Muerte provide laugh-out loud comic relief.  You'll love their first meeting -- including the knife fight.
Well, it's not long before Quaid and Turner are called back into service to take care of a potential international incident involving former eastern block intelligence agents and smuggled military secrets, among other things.  This part of the story is pretty ho-hum, but Muerte keeps things hopping.  You'll also enjoy the good old time that they have with the New Orleans Police!  Great fun.
This movie is definitely worth 5-stars for fun, but other aspects of the storyline drop the overall score to around 4 stars.
My favorite line is when a police lt. says to Quaid, ""You think you're smarter than us don't you!?""
Quaid responds, ""Oh, not much.""

I would definitely have this film on the top of my list of recommended movies.  It's funny, romantic, full of good ol' fashioned action, and it's something anybody can watch.  There's really only one word of profanity in the entire movie.  The cast is incredible and I don't think you could find that kind of chemistry in just any movie.  Quaid and Turner are fantastic together, and Tucci makes the most of a character that most people would blow off.  I don't think the original critic watched the same movie I'm praising (the couple has an 11 month old girl, not a one year old boy, for clarification).

Somthing tells me that the Amazon Editorial Reviewer didn't  pay much attention to this gem of a movie. For one thing, the baby is an 11  month old girl, not a year old boy. In fact, one of the running gags is the  parents' inability to agree on a name for their precious daughter (Jane  Louise or Louise Jane). The action is anything but formulaic. How often do  we see a man holding a baby successfully defend himself against two  knife-wielding muggers?
The cast is wonderful. Dennis and Kathleen are  perfectly matched as quick-witted, devoted spouses. Their on-screen  chemistry is delightful. Stanley Tucci's inspired performace is hilarious  and scene-stealing. Tom Arnold turns in a funny and understated supporting  part, and Larry Miller has quite a bit of fun as the bumbling Sgt. Halsey.  Herbert Ross deserves a special Oscar for helming this movie!
There are  few movies that I can watch over and over again and still adore. The  Princess Pride, Pride & Prejudice, Speechless, and Undercover Blues top  a very short list.
I've recommended Undercover Blues to all sorts of  different people and every single person has adored it. Ignore the critics  and see it for yourself!",964137600,22,1251,4.85781990521327

Turner and Quaid, obviously enjoying themselfs in  their somewhat unusual roles display an unexpected talent for comedie and  the movie has a better plot than one would expect. Now some fools may think  that all comedy must be in Jim Carey style, but personally I much prefer  the calmer, better organised style that Herbert Ross achieved here.
