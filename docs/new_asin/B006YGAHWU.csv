8506470,5,B006YGAHWU,"I received this as a gift last year, and I will admit I was skeptical. I mean, could it really be possible? Boy, was I wrong. I now can get my vaccinations, which also cause autism, without concern of contracting this pandemic disease. I am living proof of such!

Thanks!",1408838400,,271,4.42
8506471,5,B006YGAHWU,"This fact-filled DVD was so totally engrossing that I defecated myself rather than leave to use the bathroom...I couldn't even stand to put it on ""pause"".  I knew the government and the CDC were hiding these facts!  I'm almost 100 percent sure the author and originator of this DVD is alien, and being very helpful to humanity.  I can now confidently remove my tin-foil hat, knowing that all of what I've supposedly ""imagined or hallucinated"" (as told to me by my court-appointed psychiatrist-quack) is true!  I've thrown away all my anti-psychotic meds, since I never really took them anyway...they made me feel strange.  The voices tell me this was a good thing anyway.",1377388800,54,671,4.902654867256637
8506472,5,B006YGAHWU,"My cancer too. the only thing is, it left me with terrible flatulence, and now by city ordinance, I have to sell my home and go live on a deserted island.

That wouldn't be so bad, but the island has no electricity and I think it has deer ticks, and I would therefore be likely to contract Lyme disease. Please advise.

I think my Autism just came back, too.",1377302400,61,358,4.173913043478261
