3993090,2,B002USF1VS,"JENNIFER'S BODY isn't a bad movie, exactly...but I'm not certain that it serves much of a purpose.  It's a horror movie that wants to be funny and knowing (like SCREAM) and it's also a teen-comedy that wants to be a horror film.  The result is a movie that is not remotely scary and only offers occasional laughs.

I know the main reason to see it was to see if Megan Fox, she of every magazine cover of the year, can do anything beyond look vacuous in TRANSFORMERS.  For me, I was interested to see what screenwriter Diablo Cody would cook up after her Oscar-winning success with JUNO.  What she's concocted is a film that's very proud of its snarky attitude (which JUNO sure had)...but it lacks humanity.  While I wouldn't have hoped for the rich characterizations we saw in JUNO (or the rich performances of Ellen Page and company)...I hoped for a little heart and a little wit.

Megan Fox is Jennifer.  She's a high-school girl who is SO attractive (and knows it) that she can walk around the hallways in slow motion and simply drip disdain for everyone around her.  She's the kind of girl who has ""outgrown"" high school ""boys.""  She has a foul-mouth.  And she has a best friend from the time of her youngest childhood...Anita, whom everyone calls ""Needy"" (BIG LOVE's Amanda Seyfried.)  Needy has a nice, steadfast boyfriend that is clearly destined to be her husband one day.  She's shy, but generally studious and well-adjusted.  She's only diverted from her nice, safe path by the lurid pull of her old friend Jennifer.  Their friendship is not particularly believable...at best, we assume it's just an old habit.  Jennifer has pretty much alienated everyone else at school anyway.

One evening, the two girls go to a local club to watch and up-and-coming indie-emo-rock act (fronted by Adam Brody, in a performance that actually straddles the line the film wants...he's funny and vaguely horrifying).  A fire breaks out, many folks die, and Jennifer is whisked away in the hubbub in the grubby van of this rock band.  She returns soon enough, but she sure is acting strange.  And Jennifer then lives up to her name of ""man-eater.""

I won't share more of the plot.  Not all that much happens in the film...it's hard to believe the few plot turns take up over 100 minutes of screen time.  There are a few charms.  JK Simmons pops up in a few scenes (which he promptly steals) as a Canadian-accented teacher with REALLY bad hair and a very bad idea of how teens might react to the shock of losing so many classmates.  Of course, in this film, the kids DON'T react in a believable way.  Cody isn't interested in the rest of the school...she focuses almost entirely on Jennifer, Needy, her boyfriend Chad and a couple of other guys.  We don't really get a strong sense of a teen society.  And we don't get a strong sense of adult society either.  As is typical of these kinds of films, geared TOWARDS teens, the adults are barely present and usually quite clueless.  Amy Sedaris makes a pointless cameo as Needy's mother, and Jennifer's mother shows up for exactly 15 seconds in one scene.  The world of JENNIFER'S BODY feels far too sparsely populated.  A local club burns down and a dozen or more people burn to death.  We're TOLD the national media has swarmed the town...but we see nothing of that.  I guess the film had a low budget...but it feels remarkably unpopulated.

Amanda Seyfried, who is excellent in BIG LOVE, acquits herself as well as possible.  She's a striking looking actress, and I think we naturally root for her...even if her character is mostly a bit boring and not well-written.  Megan Fox delivers some of her off-color lines with the gusto you'd expect if you've ever read any of her silly magazine interviews.  But there is just so little going happening on her face that resembles emotion of any kind.  She appears, to me, to be DEEPLY SHALLOW.  She COULD therefore make a decent scream-queen...but the fact is, the more she talks and interacts with others on screen, the less you like her.  If we're supposed to feel bad about the turn Jennifer's life has taken, Fox gives us nothing to cling to.  True, the part is poorly written as well...but unlike Seyfried, Fox can't wrestle anything worthwhile from it.

I was disappointed mostly in Diablo Cody.  But director Karyn Kusama (GIRL FIGHT) did nothing to help either.  The film has little visual style, and is often VERY slowly paced.  A movie like this usually clocks in at barely 90 minutes...this one is 10-12 minutes longer, and you feel every extra moment.

Cody is obviously a witty person.  I just hope she stops mistaking a smart mouth for believable dialogue, and can craft something better next time.  Seyfriend deserves a better film role than this (or MAMMA MIA) and Megan Fox simply needs to fade away.",1253404800,7,4800,4.684210526315789
3993091,5,B002USF1VS,"this movie is not genre defining. its not intelligent, only VERY mildly suspenseful, and youll find urself laughing through at least half the movie. but if you pay attention to the previews thats exactly what it was supposed to be. crazy action, disturbing scenes, and TONS of cheesy one-liners. no doubt if this movie is a success it will definitely be because of the sexy megan fox. but once you give it a chance youll find it to be entertaining, not amazing, but entertaining. if this country can create blockbuster hits out of garbage movies like twilight and spiderman 3 then what is so wrong with giving this movie a chance. the preview for this movie is a perfect portrayal of what to expect and if you walk out of the theater disappointed then you only have urself to blame. i love not having to take movies too seriously so me loving this one was a no brainer for me. megan fox took a huge risk taking this role because shes a sexual icon and still isn't afraid to make a movie with some crazy disturbing scenes, i applaud her efforts. want fun on a friday night? go see this. if ur an anal movie critic? just wait foer the next batman. (on a side note i heard megan fox might be playin the next bat girl, keeping my fingers crossed)",1253404800,4,1242,4.380952380952381
3993092,4,B002USF1VS,"Let's cut to the chase here. Watching Megan Fox strut her stuff will be reason enough for half the people who plan on seeing Jennifer's Body to buy a ticket. Sadly, you don't actually get to see much of her body, but she looks great and oozes sexiness as expected. Her acting is a different story. While she is much better here than in both of the Transformers movies (not really saying much), her voice and line delivery seem very amateurish at times, especially when trying to hold her own with Amanda Seyfried. Amanda turns in a fine performance and it's really her movie, despite the title. Now, I would be lying if I said I didn't enjoy Juno, but Diablo Cody seems obsessed with writing dialogue that no person in reality would actually say. It's not as glaring this time around and some of the lines made me laugh, but lets hope for a little more moderation in the future. This is a horror movie, though it's not very scary and lacks the buckets of blood you would expect from an R rated flesh-eating demon tale. A few creepy moments can be found, but the horror elements seem nothing more than an afterthought. There are some minor gore and gross-out scenes, but nothing as unique or inventive as the well received Drag Me to Hell that came out earlier this year. I think the entertainment value of the characters, dialogue (most of the time) and the eye candy that is Megan Fox makes Jennifer's Body work.

This is a 3 and 1/2 star movie at most, but unlike the Twilight craze going on, guys and girls will like different aspects of it, so I think it deserves a little something extra for including everyone in the fun.",1253232000,6,1627,4.459731543624161
3993093,2,B002USF1VS,"High school can be hell. And Jennifer's Body makes sure to illustrate this point with tortured friendships, devilish betrayals, and demonic violence, but it also tries too hard to be hip and clever in both its dialogue and its parallels to teen life while it hammers home the comparisons. It also focuses so much on its self-absorbed wittiness to pay much attention to the slasher aspects, and we're left with a film that's part parable, part comedy, part horror, part exploitation, and ultimately not too much fun. At least the two female leads can share a passionate kiss undeterred by the absence of reason and plausibility.

Nerdy, reserved bookworm Needy (Amanda Seyfriend) and arrogant, conceited cheerleader Jennifer (Megan Fox) are best friends, though they share little in common. They share even less in common when Jennifer mysteriously gains an appetite for human blood after a disastrous fire at a local bar. As Needy's male classmates are steadily killed off in gruesome attacks, the young girl must uncover the truth behind her friend's transformation and find a way to stop the bloodthirsty rampage before it reaches her own boyfriend Chip (Johnny Simmons).

""I wasn't always this cracked. I used to be normal,"" insists Needy at the start of the film. Unfortunately she's unable to convince us during the course of the next two hours in which Jennifer's Body ensnarls a pitch-black comedy, thriller, horror slasher, and teen drama into a hopelessly weird mess. If the trials and tribulations of female high school life can be equated to bizarre occult, demonic possession, then writer Diablo Cody has penned a masterpiece. However, few may agree with her method of proof, especially when the humor is often lifeless, the jump-scare manipulation is timeworn, and the contemporary dialogue is forced.

The purportedly hip lingo spouted from nearly every character (except J.K. Simmons, a solid character actor who has found his way into many recent films) is Cody's trademark; yet outside of the light-hearted dramatic territory of Juno, it's completely ineffective. ""Jennifer Speak"" includes a few nominally clever phrases such as ""salty morsels"" in reference to attractive teens, ""lime green Jell-O"" for jealousy, and ""sea cucumber"" for... you figure it out. Most of it isn't nearly as catchy or epigrammatic as it is simply peculiar.

And finally, everyone interested in the film purely for the ample measures of Megan Fox will be disappointed to learn that no real nudity emerges in the film, except for a slow-motion, unrevealing skinny dip and a gratuitous girl-on-girl makeout session between Fox and Seyfried. There isn't a large enough body count for a slasher, not enough high school angst for a teen dramedy, not enough debauchery for exploitation and not enough original material for entertainment.

3993128,4,B002USF1VS,"Released in 2009 and directed by Karyn Kusama, ""Jennifer's Body"" stars Megan Fox and Amanda Seyfried as curious best friends in Devil's Kettle, Minnesota. I say ""curious"" because the former is a hot cheerleader and the latter is a geek. When an up-and-coming band from Minneapolis plays at the local bar Jennifer (Fox) disappears in the band's van and returns beat up and evidently malevolent. As bodies start piling up, Needy (Seyfried) and her beau (Johnny Simmons) try to solve the mystery.

Fox is superb in the title role. She's undeniably foxy, but she's not my type. The same goes for the too-thin Seyfried, although Amanda certainly has a stunning face. While ""Jennifer's Body"" isn't as good as I expected it to be, it's good enough to marginally recommend if you like horror flicks in the high school/vampire vein. The tone is odd in that it tries to be serious while not taking itself too seriously. There's also a questionable subplot obviously derived from the tragic Station Nightclub Fire of February 20, 2003.

The film runs 102 minutes (107 minutes unrated) and was shot in the Vancouver area and Devil's Kettle Falls, Minnesota.

I was able to get past that and enjoy the movie, though, as the movie's dark sense of humor, especially with respect to the ""bad guys"" and their motivations, is very entertaining and unique.

3993281,1,B002USF1VS,"So this was supposed to be Megan Fox's break out movie where she proved that she could be a movie star without having to stand next to Shia LaBeouf or a giant CGI robot.  However she just bombed horribly in this movie.

I could tell you the plot of the movie, but honestly the trailers give it all away and in the first 10 minutes of the movie, you know how it's going to end, so what's the point?

The only thing that would draw a person to want to see this movie is Megan Fox wearing skimpy outfits like that cheerleader outfit she is wearing on the cover of the DVD.  And really, that's not enough to make me like a movie.  I need more than Megan Fox dressed like she's going clubbing and jiggling around on the screen for 90 minutes.

The only person in this movie that actually did a good job acting was Amanda Seyfried.  She actually pulled off the 'nerdy best friend,"" fairly well and made me like her character.  Where I really rolled my eyes in the movie was when we had the character ""Needy,"" going to the school library and doing research on demonic possession, devil worshiping and a succubus.  I have a hard time believing that any high school library would have those books on their shelves.

In closing the movie is dumb, the plot is tired and recycled from other horror movies, the acting is lame and the lead actress can't act.

Skip this one.",1423008000,2,1360,4.31496062992126

3993313,3,B002USF1VS,"Coming from Diablo Cody, I expected a movie with plenty of witty barbs and a lean towards the satirical. I got that. But I also expected a quality horror film. In that regard, Jennifer's Body didn't measure up. I think Cody was going for less '80s slasher fare and more 90s teen fright fest. It felt like the movie wanted to be Scream, but it kind of ended up in I Know What You Did Last Summer territory.

While Megan Fox has the role of Jennifer, she's really a supporting character and antagonist to Amanda Seyfried who plays Needy, Jennifer's best friend. Needy tags along with Jennifer to a local bar to see a band from ""the city"" Jennifer discovered on MySpace (are people still using MySpace?). When the place catches fire and mayhem ensues, Jennifer is whisked away by the band and sacrificed to Satan to ensure the band's success. They think she's a virgin, but she's not even close and winds up being resurrected by a demon to become a bloodthirsty, boy-hunting temptress. This is followed by a few vicious murders, Needy's shocking realization her friend is evil, and the inevitable showdown.

I really wanted to love this movies, preconceptions be damned. I liked Cody's first film, Juno, so I felt it unfair to dismiss this one because of Megan Fox snagging the spotlight. But Fox is not a talented actress and whatever sizzle there is with regards to her current it-girl status is drowned out by the fact that she brings nothing remarkable to the role or the movie. Amanda Seyfried is the star by far, as she takes a character nearly equal in vapidity and breathes life into her. Mind you, there is an awful, tacked on clairvoyance with the character that's never really explained or explored, and I thought really dragged down the movie for me.

The highlights are the gratuitous schoolgirl love affair moments, the witty barbs in the dialogue, and J.K. Simmons as a feckless high school teacher. The low points come from the almost by-the-numbers approach to the horror elements. Dimwitted boys get killed off, which is a reasonable juxtaposition--I suppose--from the usual dimwitted girls getting hacked to death by maniacs. It's just a shame that the movie doesn't aim higher, rather it takes a lateral approach by simply reversing gender roles. If that's all that's needed to improve and progress horror as a genre then I shall take this time now to weep.

For all my gripes about Jennifer's Body, it's still better than the majority of teen horror romps I've watched over the years. I'd hardly call that high praise, though. Diablo Cody's second crack at the bat was a swing and a miss, in my opinion, and I shall keep my fingers crossed on her third script. I think there's enough movie here to recommend as a rental for slumber parties and horror movie marathons. I just wish there was more to love.",1421193600,,2821,4.704453441295547

I'm aware of all the things that aren't brilliant-- the dialogue is rarely as funny as it's trying to be, the horror and comedy tones don't quite mesh, and the pacing is a little odd-- but throughout the movie I wanted to see what happened next, and a lot of ""campy"" teen films cannot do that for me.

I think the horror in this film is a lot stronger than the comedy.  The demon! Jennifer scenes have good visuals, and Megan Fox acts the creepy thing well.  The acting is convincing in general, with Amanda Seyfried probably standing out.

As a girl, I found every guy in the movie to be fairly adorable, so that's a nice thing.  Well, the evil band members aren't really that cute, but the lead singer's ironic/deadpan delivery provides most of the actually funny moments of the film.

I enjoyed Jennifer's Body as much as the average horror/comedy thing, and far more than most straight up formula horror films.  The story is better if you think of Jennifer's succubi tendencies as a punishment by proxy for the males who murdered her, but whether that's the intent or not the plot is solid and easy to follow.  I like Roger Ebert's quote: as a movie about a flesh-eating cheerleader, it's better than it has to be.  Megan Fox as a semi-lesbian cheerleader who eats people has SOME appeal no matter what, but Jennifer's Body delivers enough substance that you don't feel vaguely guilty about watching it for that premise.",1417392000,4,1475,4.574144486692015

3993334,4,B002USF1VS,"The Supernatural Elements in this are Powerful.

A band used Jennifer as a sacrifice and they botched the ritual.  Jennifer rose from the dead as a Succubus.  Her new demonic form had instant healing, super strength, and levitation - she could hover in mid air.  She also had an insatiable craving for sex, and human flesh.

She'd been friends with Needy since they were small children.  As children they'd unknowingly performed a ritual of their own.  Needy had drank Jennifer's blood, linking the two of them together.  After Jennifer turned Needy was plagued by visions, she saw Jennifer's victims die - she saw them through Jennifer's eyes.

When Needy survived being bitten by Jennifer she absorbed some of the Demonic power, without turning all the way.  She gained super strength and hover power.  At the very end she used her new powers to hunt down the band.  She slaughtered them, to avenge all of Jennifer's victims, herself and who Jennifer had once been.

The bond between Jennifer and Needy was also powerful.

Even without the supernatural elements that would be a good story.  They'd known each other since they small.  Jennifer had grown to be popular and dominant.  Needy had become supportive and clingy.  Also there was a strong sexual vibe between them, both before and after Jennifer changed.

After Jennifer changed Needy covered for her and tried to save her.  She tried to deny that her friend was gone, and only a monster remained.  Needy finally turned on Jennifer when she seduced Needy's boyfriend, and then killed him.  The final straw in their relationship was when Jennifer took Needy's guy from her.

The movies climax was both supernatural and emotional.  Needy fought the Heartless Bitch Jennifer had become, and was bitten in the process.  Emotionally Needy crossed off Jennifer, and physically stabbed the demon in heart.",1414800000,,1858,4.973941368078176

3993340,3,B002USF1VS,"Jennifers Body

This is a teen horror flick.  An inde band decides as a career enhancing move to sacrifice a virgin to Satan.  How common this is in the music business I don't know.  Their plan comes a cropper when Jennifer (Megan Fox) turns out to have lost her place in the virgin sack races in middle school.  The sacrifice to Satan goes awry.  Jennifer is well and truly sacrificed, but her husk, Jennifers Body, becomes inhabited by a demon.  The demon needs a regular supply of human flesh to keep in shape.  This works a hardship on high school boys who can be lured into isolated spots by a beautiful girl, all of them in other words.
 Fans of cheep special effects and gore, fans of Megan Fox and fans of quick, quirky writing will all enjoy this movie.  The writer is Academy Award (thats the Oscar folks) winner Diablo Cody.  Cody is a former stripper who scored the gilded statue for writing Juno.  There are plenty of teen gore-fest movies but the crisp script and insider teen dialog will keep a smile on your face, in spite of the blood lapping and what not.
 Fox plays a pretty girl that boys like.  This is not a stretch for her.  This is her second feature film this year.  She is quite rightly making the most of her short time in the gas lights.
 Jennifers Body dbuted this week at number five.  The one hour and 42 minute film brought in a scant $6.8 million over the three day week end period.  Still, the producers will take heart.  I think word of mouth will bring people into the theater to see this, and they only spent $16 million to film this light weight two saw blade teen flick.

  It delivers less scare & more teenage girl angst than I would have liked.  I mean come on!!!  What is scarier than a Egotistical, homecomming queen type, cheerleader that is possessed by a flesh eating Succubus?!  Right?  This fails miserably.
  What it does turn out to be is a thinly diguised way to get us men to the theatres (& blu-ray/netflix on the homefront) to watch Megan Fox & Amanda Seyfried duke it out & have a lesbian scene.  Which it works wonderfull on that front.

Wasn't really shopping for it but I kept seeing it in the blu ray bin at Walmart and bought it through Amazon to complete a $35+ order. I haven't received my blu ray copy yet, but I did watch it through Amazon video sreaming since they offered it free (I hope) with the purchase.
 As for the film itself, I personally wish I had spent the money on a different movie. But I'm sure that younger people in their mid to late teens and into their 20's might enjoy it more than I, so I won't completely bash it. There's been worse ""scarey"" movies made. Megan's character was a little more foul mouthed than she needed to be. For that reason I wouldn't recommend kids much under 14 or so. I would like to see Megan Fox playing a quality character closer to her actual age for a change. Seems like a waste to keep portraying her as a teen.

Seems a little far-fetched? It gets crazier. Because the sacrifice is not made with a virgin (because the band took Jennifer's word that she was a virgin when she was not) some weird, flesh-eating demon enters her body and makes her a cannibalistic monster, eating anyone who dares fall for her beautiful, seductive mannerisms. Eats a few kids, and then when she devours her 'best friend's bf, suddenly everything takes a turn for the interesting paranormal affects.

By no means am I disappointed in this movie. The effects were interesting, the lines were corny but funny. And Amanda and Megan kiss. Being a girl, I wasn't all 'woohoo' about it but I found it really...enticing. I like this movie because it gives a different look of what's high school evil and what's pure, demonic evil.

3993383,5,B002USF1VS,"This movie does as much to make fun of the horror genre than it does to actually be a horror movie itself.  It is definitely not typical in that it also tells the story of two lifelong friends that have grown apart, and the one only realizes it after the other is possessed by a demon and starts killing off the boys in high school.  It is not just a hack and slash kind of movie, and if that is something that you need in a horror movie, then best to just skip this.

There are funny moments, gory moments even dramatic moments in the story and they all work well.  The acting is decent, and I think the script was good.  Better than what you get in a lot of horror movies.  There is not the gratuitous nudity that you get in a lot of horror movies. Megan Fox is in some skimpy outfits, but everything stays covered up.  There is however a good two-minute sequence of her and Amanda Seyfried making out which is as spectacular as it sounds (if you are into that sort of thing).

The A/V quality of the movie on blu ray is very good, and for those who do get the discs there are quite a bit of behind the scenes and making of material.  You also get the theatrical and unrated versions of the film.  The unrated version just adds a little more footage in, but is not radically different than the theatrical version.  Ultimately whether you like this or not is going to be totally subjective.  I don't think you have to like it because Diablo Cody wrote it, or a particular actor or actress is in it, but chances are if you are fans of any of the individuals involved, and the horror genre (depending on your tastes) you will like it.",1372982400,,1633,4.198717948717949

Firstly, the violence apart, great acting and lively performances is what you will find here. Fox and Seyfried make a great team together and it can be noticed right from the start of the film. While Megan Fox delivers very decently and seductively, its Amanda Seyfried who delivers one of her very best. The rest of the cast do justice to their roles and no matter what the critics have to say, the film does entertain you and there is no such moment where you will be bored.

The other girl featured who was Jennifer's friend was butt ugly.  Geez.  No thanks.  Another stupid movie written by a some foolish idiot I am sure.  So many of the movies these days suck, and this is no exception.  Take 'Dracula 2000' for example, that was much better.

3993398,4,B002USF1VS,"Jenifer's Body is  a return to the 'horror' film. The name 'Horror' in Hollywood had become a 'dirty' word. No film company wanted to say they were making a horror film. It was either a thriller or an adventure film etc, etc, etc. Finally, the producers of JENNIFER'S BODY came right out and said ""We're making a pure Horror film"".

JENNIFERS BODY stars the ever lovely Megan Fox as Jennifer. She attends a concert with her female friend and at the end of the concert goes with the band alone. What she doesn't know is they are planning on sacrificing her so they can get a demon to do their every wish. (When has that ever worked). The surprise payoff comes at the end of the film. However, she needs a human 'snack' every once in awhile and many of her schoolmates become her prey. Except her best friend who feels guilty for abandoning her with the band.

Things go downhill rapidly, of course, (always seems that way when a demon is involved). To tell you anymore would ruin a great little 'horror' film for you. And the ending is still a surprise, a nice little touch you don't get very ofen. The price is right and it's a good movie. You won't go wrong with this one. I promise.

3993403,5,B002USF1VS,"Megan Fox and Amanda Seyfried do a SUPERB job with this movie.  I was
both creeped out and totally entertained throughout.  The chemistry
between Fox and Seyfried works, as does Seyfried's chemistry with her
onscreen boyfriend, Chip (J. Simmons).  I loved the supernatural meets
Beatrix Kiddo kickbutt vibe with both Fox during the movie, and Seyfried
at the end.  Good stuff.

As an aside, where is Megan Fox nowadays?  Looking at her in this movie
would make any red-blooded human male's heart ache.  She is sooooooooo
beautiful.  And I think she's a talented actress, so I hope we get to see
more of Megan Fox in the future.

At any rate, the BFF relationship between Fox and Seyfried really works.
And the horror aspect of this film not only works, but is pretty unique
and cool.  I watched this film twice, back-to-back.  I liked it that
much.  For any horror movie fan, this film is a must.  I'd actually say
it's a future classic, and how anyone could give this movie 1 star is
absolutely beyond me.  Watch this movie, and judge for yourself.  You
won't regret it.....

3993411,5,B002USF1VS,"Okay.
When I initially saw the previews for this movie, I thought it was crap. I thought it was going to be another terrible teenage horror movie filled with dumb eye-candy, bad dialogue, and a nail-on-chalkboard plot.
I was wrong. Sort of.
A friend was telling me about it, and I was just kind of ignoring her, when she told me Diablo Cody was the writer. My ears perked up then, as I've loved just about everything she's written. I love the way she uses satire in her films, I love the subtleties she works in, and I love her playful, ""whatever"" attitude towards sexuality (she worked as a stripper while writing Juno, simply because she thought it'd be a fun thing to do). I then started to have high hopes for this film.
Jennifer's Body is a terrible teenage horror movie. I feel like it's done so, however, with a great sense of satire. I feel like Diablo Cody wrote Jennifer's Body as a terrible teenage horror movie to poke fun at the genre. The dialogue is super campy, chock full of clich&eacute;s, and stuffed with large quantities of terrible teenage slang, but it WORKS. The characters are just transparent enough, and the plot so ridiculous that what looks like a terrible, stereotypical mess of a movie turns out to be wonderfully well done.
If there wasn't that subtlety and satire, this would be a Grade F movie. As it is, however, this movie is fantastic.

Even though Megan Fox looks like a sloppy kisser and it makes me want to puke, it was still a good movie. I like Amanda Seyfried, which I've said before, and she plays a great role in this film. I think the story line was good, everything about the movie adds up, and I didn't feel like there were any gaps or anything.

'Jennifer's Body' is about this chick named Needy. Her best friend falls victim to some crazy, demonic, ritualistic type of stuff by some amateur band people. So after...whatever happens she goes on this crazy killing spree because she has to feed on people so she can stay young and beautiful looking. I don't really want to ruin the movie for anyone who hasn't seen it and wants to so I won't say anything else about it.

I thought that 'Jennifer's Body' was a great movie. Like I said, everything adds up, there aren't any plot holes that I noticed. I think it's definitely worth watching and I'm glad that it's part of my collection. It's not scary or anything but there is a little bit of gore...I guess.

The plot skips along carelessly while you're left wondering what the hell is happening and whether or not you should become invested in characters. The acting is lifeless, bland, and just plain bad.

Power, popularity, great hair, or even catapult your band to the top!
The storyline makes sense. It has it's little humor twists and pokes along with real dialogue.
Megan Fox IS HOT (can't deny it and I won't try) she plays her part well and in a 'high schooler' vibe.
Amanda Seyfried is not hard on the eyes at all either! Very convincing as the 'average girl' and as the movie
progresses you see her become stronger and more self confident in herself.
The end of all this is great and somewhat unexpected.

The extras are okay, not as packed as most DVD, Blu-Rays but entertaining with PSAs and commentaries from
the director and writer (both women).  A great deal for the price in my opinion.

3993418,1,B002USF1VS,"Someone should print the script for Jennifer's Body in 48-type face font, double-spaced lines, on cardboard, wrap it in plaster, and beat Diablo Cody within an inch of her life.  That's how bad the script for this film is.  I have never heard such forced hipness in a film with 20-somethings playing teenagers.  It makes the dialogue from Disturbing Behavior almost Shakespearean.

Beyond the unignorable script is a braindead plot that involves a little bit of Carrie, some faux Devil worship, and Megan Fox in a lot of outfits that make viewers wish that some of the fabric covering her body were covering her mouth.  Simply put, she shouldn't have made Spielberg mad, because the well of roles she is allowed to butcher is running dry, and she'll soon have to abandon her no-nudity clause if she hopes to get work.  Hint, hint, it sadly doesn't happen in this movie.

Countering Fox's hotness and inability to act is Amanda Seyfried's awkward cuteness and decent acting.  Word to Hollywood: We're all tired of the ""add glasses to cute girl and make her unattractive""-nonsense.  If you want an unattractive counterpart, get Rosie O'Donnell.  All other characters are pointless and forgettable, which should tell you all you need to know.  If not, I'll spell it out for you: Megan Fox doesn't get naked and is the second most important ""actor"" in this atrocity.  Pass.",1324857600,6,1369,4.878787878787879

3993420,2,B002USF1VS,"I guess I was expecting ""Jennifer's body"" to have something to do with the story. But no, Jennifer isn't even the main character here. The protagonist is actually Amanda Seyfried's character, you know the actress given second billing. Marketing I guess.  Jennifer/Megan Fox and her body would sell more I suppose was the thinking.

Anyway, Seyfried and Fox are supposed to be BBF's I guess. We know this because we are told they share ""sandbox love"", whatever the hell that is. Apparently ""sandbox love"" involves children sucking blood from each others cuts which leads to a psychic link. Yeah. This is supposed to explain why Seyfried's alleged nerd status (ala Hollywood's idea that any girl with glasses is automatically a ""nerd"") and Fox being the most popular cheerleader/slut in high school, allows them to be best friends.

So this unlikely pair of stereotypes head off to a bar to see a boy band called Low Shoulder. These boys are looking for a virgin it seems and  for reasons beyond comprehension they decide that Fox is the most likely candidate. Apparently Seyfried used her psychic powers of  ""sandbox love"" to hear this plan being discussed from across the room in a crowded noisy bar. Despite this, the members of Low Shoulder will whisk Fox away anyway.

At this point the bar burns down and the two girls narrowly escape the fire that kills several of their classmates. Fox is then taken away by the boy band, we assume for sex. But Fox returns later, covered in blood and puking up black goop. But that's ok, she's fine the next day. This is where the ""mystery"" is supposed to start.

Then the film goes off on a watered down detour through Heathers country as the high school students go through grief counseling. Seyfried suspects something is wrong with her friend now. I suppose it's because Fox is slightly more callous/manipulative/shallow than she used to be. Turns out Fox is some sort of demon/vampire/werewolf/succubus/whatever the hell she is thing now and she eats the Stereotypical Dumb Jock.

Next on Fox's hit list is Stereotypical Goth Emo Kid. Seyfried has shown an interest in this Goth kid despite already having a nebbish boyfriend under her thumb. Apparently Seyfried has a thing for weak, easily controlled men. At any rate Seyfried gets some psychic impressions of the killing while she and her boyfriend are having sex.

At this point Fox decides to tell Seyfried all about her transformation ""cause they are BBF's"". The boy band tried to sacrifice her to Satan in exchange for fame and wealth but since she was not a virgin, she became this weird monster. (but the band gets famous anyway) End of ""mystery"". Yeah, what mystery. There is no reason this could not have been shown to us right away as it being withheld has no bearing on the plot. Seyfried is horrified but this does not stop the two of them from having an inexplicable lesbian makeout session in the middle of this revelation. (???) Maybe Fox has hypnotic powers or something. Whatever.

Now Seyfried breaks up with her bf  ""to protect him"". But what do you know, this all leads to Fox getting her mitts on him. Psychic Impressions to the rescue though as Seyfried senses this and rushes to save the dude in distress. (Isn't all this subversion of the genre clever?! No? Yeah, not really)

Seyfried finally figures out what we knew all along: that Fox has never really been a good friend/person. (Yes, the women in this film are only marginally less completely stupid than the men. Is this supposed to be empowering?)  Not before Fox kills Seyfried's worthless boy-possession though. He ""was dead before she got there....but Seyfried's voice brought him back just long enough to say goodbye..."" and impale Fox with a metal pole. Which prompts Fox to ask if Seyfried has any tampons.  No, really. Of course the boyfriend  missed Fox's heart (the only way to kill her apparently) and she just runs off.

Time for the big showdown. This involves lots of lame callback dialogue quips, Seyfried getting bitten, and breaking Fox's BBF chain necklace which seems to render her powerless enough for Seyfried to stab her in the heart. Unfortunately Fox's mother bursts in and Seyfried is shipped off to the mental institution, where she becomes known as ""the kicker"", you know cause she now kicks people's teeth out for making harmless comments in her direction. You see, the bite Fox gave her has transferred demonic powers to Seyfried, who breaks out and goes on a quest to destroy that evil boy band that caused this whole mess. Cut to end credits sequence showing her decimation of the band. I guess Satan wins? I'm not really sure. But that Seyfried sure can kick a lot of butt so...whatever, dude. Awesome and stuff.

Boo.

I hope teens don't actually use the witless slang that is peppered throughout this film. It's so uncreative and direct that it comes across like bad puns. ""Groovy"" may not be a great word, but it's better than ""you give me such a wettie"" or ""You need to move on...dot.org."" That doesn't even SORT of make any sense. Seriously, please tell me actual teens are more imaginative than this.

It's ridiculous how many songs are shoehorned into this movie's soundtrack. I lost count. Some songs don't get more than a few seconds worth of play before another one kicks in, one after another. I assume it's suppose to seem ""artistic"", but it plays more like they couldn't decide what song to play over a scene so they just used them all.

The film is good on a technical level. They know how to work cameras and such. But basically its just a dumb teen slasher/monster movie with some ""genre subversion"" involving role reversal. Which isn't really anything new in slasher films. Woman as heroine is basically a staple in this sort of film. I'm told the woman who wrote this thing won an Oscar for Juno so, she must be at least competent. Are these people just ignorant?  It's as if they assume people who might like a horror film are dumb, so their idea of elevating the genre is to just feed them the same generic crap with a some ""clever hipster dialogue"" and ""genre subversion"". Just to get the kids thinking...subliminally...about...uh, something. It's sort of condescending.

Or maybe their agenda was no more than ""horror movies tend to be cheap to produce and make money"".  Either way, this movie is just awful.",1324252800,3,6339,4.758432087511395

3993422,3,B002USF1VS,"Oh how I wish Jennifer's Body (the movie) was as appealing as Jennifer's (Megan Fox's) body.  Unfortunately, it isn't; what we have here is basically an average horror film that plays everything pretty straight down the middle and never really tries to do anything that would set itself apart from the pack.  I wouldn't even give it an R rating - there's no real nudity (sigh), the blood and gore isn't overwhelming, and the story certainly doesn't produce much tension, let alone vicarious scares.  If Megan Fox weren't so incredibly hot, I don't think this movie would be getting more than a handful of good reviews.

As if the storyline isn't predictable enough to begin with, the movie opens with Jennifer's best friend locked up in a mental institution, reflecting back on the events that put her there.  Anita ""Needy"" Lesnicky (Amanda Seyfried) and Jennifer Check (Megan Fox) are a veritable best friend odd couple.  Jennifer's is smoking hot and promiscuous, while Needy is reserved and nerdy.  Their dysfunctional relationship begins to change the night that a local bar burns down, killing several of their classmates.  Jennifer had dragged Needy there to see a new band called Low Shoulder and to meet the lead singer, whom Jennifer finds incredibly ""salty.""  After the two escape the burning building, Jennifer decides to join the band in their bus and take off to who knows where.  Upon her return, she's changed into an uncaring, self-obsessed person.  She's also a murderer and a cannibal who must feed to maintain her strength and good looks.

The plot never ventures far from the tried and true path of horror predictability.  Indeed, the only surprises I met along the way came in the form of brief appearances by Bill Fagerbakke and Amy Sedaris.  The steady supply of quips gets old pretty quickly and what should be the most serious scene in the movie is played as pure comedy, leaving the viewer unable to take any of the action and dialogue seriously and robbing the film of any chance at generating any sort of atmosphere.  Watching Jennifer's body is like riding a roller coaster that only goes up and down a few small hills over the course of the entire ride.  There's just nothing to get excited about here.",1323043200,,2232,4.818897637795276

I absolutely loved how the school gets the band's intentions wrong and poor Needy is stuck with the only valid point: ""you weren't even there"" Its a great statement on how media spin can turn a demonic evil group of musicians and turn them into saviors.
Amanda Seyfried does a great job with this movie, and while Megan Fox cant act at all, she really doesnt need to in this campy, colorful film.",1320883200,,606,4.419642857142857
3993424,2,B002USF1VS,"They say that the way to distinguish good wine from bad wine is by drinking lots of wine; in the end though, it is entirely up to the person to determine what he/she liked about a particular bottle. Who will admit to liking a $5 bottle of wine at a gathering? Movies are a lot like wine in this same way, and we all have our guilty pleasures - you know, that movie you really enjoy but hate to admit liking to friends & family because it may be contain nothing but gratuitous violence, sex, etc.

This movie has the capacity for serving as a guilty pleasure for lots of people because it's a teen flick disguised as a horror flick. Megan Fox's character (Jennifer) is a girl who not only enjoys using her body to get what she wants (drinks, etc.) she relies on it. She sees no problem using males as well as females such as her best friend Needy - Needy has been instructed never to look better than Jennifer on a night out together.

Of course, Jennifer's sense of entitlement and years of abuse to others are about to catch up to her in a very unusual way. Her appetite for preserving herself as the `it girl' of the school, town, county, etc. becomes a physical one and it is this unrelenting hunger that leads to her destruction at the hands of her best (and only) friend Needy, played by Amanda Seyfried. Needy is genuinely concerned for her friend but her awakening of herself as a person with a voice becomes clear when her boyfriend's life is threatened.

It's easy to see how Diablo Cody has masked the teen drama as a horror movie by adding enough gore to keep the average male entertained, not to mention the kiss/lesbian scene between Fox and Seyfried. And really there is no harm in that - you can appreciate it at face value because the movie is not asking you to take it seriously. Proof of this lies in the campy acting and less than cleverly-written dialogue.

The tone, look, feel and non-existent content of the movie are not enough for me to recommend it but if you enjoyed the movie `Idle Hands', you love Megan Fox or you're just in a funny mood and feel like watching gross-out senseless scenes of varying degrees, you will likely revel in Jennifer's Body.",1320796800,2,2179,4.412935323383085

Horror comedies are a curious genre, a good balance of laugh and gore is hard to accomplish, though The Evil Dead Trilogy and Shaun of the Dead come to mind. Recently ""Drag Me To Hell"" tried it's hand at horror/comedy, and the effort though entertaining at parts wasn't too great overall.

""Jennifer's Body"" from the trailers and on the surface seems like a self serving vehicle to feature Megan Fox in all her gorgeous but stupid glory. Some of the movie is that but there's a good no make that a great amount of humor mixed with gore.

The story is very basic, Jennifer (Fox, The Transformers Movies) and Needy (Amanda Seyfried, ""Mean Girls"" and ""Mamma Mia"") are best friends and one night they go to a bar for a concert from a band named Low Shoulder and the lead singer Nikolai (Adam Brody, ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" and ""In the Land of Women"") take a liking to Jennifer.

A fire breaks out during a song, Jennifer, Needy, Low Shoulder and a few others escape. Nikolai invites a dazed Jennifer to his van and they drive off. Later that night Jennifer shows up at Needy's house covered in blood and after this night Jennifer starts acting very weird. Somedays she's fine other days she acts out especially towards Needy. It's obvious Jennifer is possesed by something evil but Needy has a hard time convincing anyone it's true.

There is plenty of blood, but even more humor and lots of it is dead on and just drop dead funny (pardon the pun). Fox is extremely and I mean extremely hot and plays a narcissistic girl to a tee, though the real star here is Seyfried as she's gives plenty of punch and laughs to an otherwise typical role.

Fox pretty much plays herself or how she thinks some people perceives her and she does a competent enough job.  I find it peculiar that the Razzie Awards nominated her as worst actress but then I remembered that a lot of these nominations, like many things, just have to do with the fact that said people don't like Megan Fox because she's pretty and they're not.

3993437,4,B002USF1VS,"Utilizing bright warm colors, occasional surreal imagery, and smooth camera work, director Karyn Kusama creates an ironic dreamy atmosphere for this cruel high school horror/comedy.  Screen writer Diablo Cody uses dead pan humor and macabre supernatural elements to craft an ultimately tragic exploration of the intriguing complex relationship between two adolescent girls. While the story itself is straighforward, there are some interesting themes to be found. The effects are minimal but convincing, a subtle mix of make up and CGI for reptilian eye and mouth morphing.  The violence is stylized and usually off screen, the camera often lingering on the gory aftermath instead.  Nudity is teased but never shown, and the film's most carefully staged erotic moment is as suspenseful as it is alluring. Theodore Shaprio and Stephen Barton`s  heavy metal guitar driven score is sometimes distracting , however the memorable main motif is a cool mood setting throwback to 80s slashers.

Much of the comedy comes from the dumb but amusing teen dialogue but there is also a great deal of twisted pitch black gallows humor. The horror of the film generates more unease than creeps but surprisingly it's the melodrama and superb acting that makes this one so worth while.  All of the main characters are sympathetic and the spacious but impactful death scenes carry a surprising amount of weight uncommon to the genre.  As the conflicted and heart broken lead, Amanda Seyfried conveys much of her emotional arc with her huge expressive eyes.  As the title character, Megan Fox's dark sex appeal and effortless charisma are naturally iconic, but it's her ability to hint at repressed vulnerability that elevates her above your average evil babe.  Veteran character actor JK Simmons draws a chuckle with every modest screen appearance as a clueless but well meaning teacher.

The visuals are not bad, admittedly, in places.. but it can't save a lurching storyline with poorly drawn characters, and soundtrack which strives for smooth and hip but only manages jarring and out of place.
Overall, interesting idea, which could have been a quirky and trendy teen Gothic horror with black comedy overtones.. but only manages to raise laughs for the wrong reasons, with the only horror the discovery that Juno really must have been a one off for Diablo Cody's writing talents.

Synopsis
Jennifer and ""Needy"" head out to a seedy bar one night to see a band they found on MySpace. The bat mysteriously catches fire, and the lead singer offers Jennifer shelter in his van, leaving Needy to watch them drive away. Jennifer later shows up in Needy's house covered in blood and smiling all weird. She eats some chicken off of the floor and proceeds to make some crazy wild boar noises and vomit up some spikey black stuff. Obviously something is wrong. Jennifer then goes on a killing spree while Needy tries to stop her.

Review
Megan Fox play a heartless man eater, oh wait, that's her actual personality.
Actually, this movie has some very hilarious moment in it like:
""I'm in survival mode, I think we need to get someplace familiar, like my van.""
""It's true, it was on their Wikipedia.""
In all honestly, this movie is incredibly funny, and not nearly as gory and disgusting as I thought that it would be. :)

My Recommendation
This is totally an 18+ movie, but I give it very high praise for what it was. 4/5 - Wait for a sale/coupon",1279411200,,1070,4.510309278350515
3993452,4,B002USF1VS,"Jennifer's Body is a pretty good film, but it's actually quite the mystery just WHY I like it so much.  It has suspense, but it's not a particularly interesting or satisfying kind of suspense.  It has an atmosphere, but it's lacking compared to the kind of terrifying atmosphere you'd experience in a REAL horror film.  It tells a story, but it's not a really captivating one.

Geez, I make it sound like the film stinks!  Sorry!  It's honestly pretty decent.  It's definitely a movie that teens would like above anyone else, though.  That's a fact.  An adult would laugh at something like this, and a child just wouldn't find it very appealing.  This is because it covers all your usual teen subjects such as boyfriend and girlfriend issues, hanging out with the cool kids at school, listening to heavy rock music, etc.

The storyline is definitely weak (and doesn't make much sense either) but I found myself not completely hating it.  It's about one of the teenage girls who becomes an invincible blood-sucking demon.  She craves the blood of boys, but she has this one friend who she's pretty close to.  The story is actually told from the perspective of her friend.  In fact, her friend seems to be involved in the majority of the storytelling.

It's interesting enough for teens, but everyone else beware- you probably won't get into it much.",1279411200,,1348,4.745689655172414
3993453,5,B002USF1VS,"Sexy Megan Fox stars in this movie!
What else needs to be said?
What more can you ask for? :-P

Megan Fox plays a hot high school girl, Jennifer, who was wrongly killed in a dark ritual by a power-seeking boy band. The slipshod sacrifice was impure and Jennifer returns as a comical man-eating monster. Dark humor surrounds this movie, but who cares about the plot or anything else for that matter when Megan Fox plays a seductive transformer?",1279324800,,443,4.6075949367088604
3993454,3,B002USF1VS,"Ok, I finally did it.  I watched Jennifer's Body last night.  I can't believe how badly the movie was trashed while it was in theaters.  It really wasn't that bad.  Actually it was a decent horror flick, and Megan Fox held her own in her first leading role.  Granted this isn't Shakespeare, but people, the movie is absolutely worth watching.  I do question the writing with lines like, ""You give me a wettie"", ""Put it in"", ""Am I too big"", ""Am I hurting you"" and my favorite line, right after Megan Fox was stabbed with a 10 foot pole and blood was squirting out of her gut says, ""do you have a tampon?""  It jumped pretty quickly from a true horror flick to a comedic spoof I believe.  I must have missed the leap though.

Jennifer (Megan Fox) is a high school cheerleader and by far the hottest girl in school, now this doesn't take a stretch to believe.  She hangs out with her best friend Amanda Seyfried and the two lean towards lesbianism, even though Amanda has a long term boyfriend.  Sorry, but I might have to watch the movie again based on the above sentence alone.  I do have to throw a snapshot in here as well about the kissing scene.  It might be one of the all time best girl on girl kissing scenes in any movie to date.  OK, now back on track.  Jennifer and Amanda head to a bar for a night out, and that is where all hell breaks loose.

It appears that the band worships the devil and they need a virgin to sacrifice in order to push their career over the edge.  They choose Megan Fox; now how they thought she was a virgin is beyond me.  With her already having experienced sexual relations, in several different ways according to her monologue, the sacrifice goes badly and our darling Megan turns into a flesh eating demon.  How can you fault her for getting a little carried away with her dietary supplements?  She is Megan Fox after all.  Let her feast on as much flesh as she would like.

So things start going a little whacky when half eaten bodies begin to show up, and in the end it really begins to piss Amanda off.  She might be the nice book worm side arm to the smoking hot Megan Fox, but even she has her limits.  Once Megan threatens Amanda's boyfriend the war commences and the girls start to battle.  I guess that long drawn out passionate kiss they shared did little to heal the animosity a demon can stir up in the loins.  So crazy girl Amanda does her best and without giving away the ending, if that matters, you do get to see a little blood spilled before the finally curtain call.

Again, not an Oscar level movie, but not a bad showing for what the movie was intended to be.  I do think the writers and director should have made it a little more clear cut on whether it was a comedy or an all out horror flick.  It really did seem to flip too suddenly and the comedic undertone almost seemed unintentional.  It is worth taking a look at if you get bored one evening.  Don't expect anything ground breaking but you will be entertained for a couple of hours if you like seeing smoking hot girls, lots of blood and listening to one liners like Megan saying, ""My tit"" and Amanda responding, ""No your heart"" when she stabbed her in the chest with a box cutter from Home Depot.",1279238400,18,3212,4.294509151414309
3993455,4,B002USF1VS,"Before I get into the film Jennifer's Body, I want to flash back a couple of years to another TIFF, when a little-known gem called Juno burst onto the big screen, winning rave reviews, and garnering some major awards, thus becoming the Little Movie That Could, and capturing hearts all over the place.  I saw Juno premiere at TIFF that year, and had chosen it simply because of its lead actor, Ellen Page.  The girl had already impressed the heck outta me in Hard Candy and, though I sort of feared her, I also wanted to see what else she could pull off when she switched to another genre.  I wasn't disappointed, to be sure.  But that year, that screening, also managed to spark an unexpected love in me for its writer, Diablo Cody.

So when The Hatter told me that Diablo was writing a horror movie, I was instantly on board.  Nothing else mattered other than the fact that one of my new favourite writers was writing a script in one of my all-time favourite genres.  I was sold from the get-go.

 I kept half an eye on the film as it developed, but didn't want to know too much.  I wanted to be surprised. The first chance I got, I quickly bought my ticket for the screening, and eagerly awaited the film's premiere as TIFF's opening night Midnight Madness selection this year.

The film centres on odd-couple BFF's who, in addition to being complete opposites in life, also happen to be a little...closer...than most.  There's Needy, the mousy, nerdy quiet girl that (with the exception of her boyfriend, Chip) every guy ignores, and Jennifer, the hot, spontaneous, outrageous, confident and rebellious girl that every guy would die for.

And, as it turns out, they get their wish.

 Without giving too much away, everything changes for both girls one fateful night at a local bar, where they've gone to watch a 'salty' band from the city perform. Tragedy strikes, suddenly and unexpectedly (as it does), and changes the lives of everyone in their little town.
 Adam Brody is hilariously self-absorbed, slightly vacuous, and ultimately focused all at once...though with perhaps a mildly creepy fascination with his van...

Anyway.

Aside from the possible crazy circus of having a Megan Fox as the title character (in fact, she actually turned out to be sort of perfect for the role, and pulls it off with a finesse one may not realize she was capable of), and beyond the quiet brilliance of Amanda Seyfried's performance as the lead, and of course not discounting the solid direction of Karyn Kusama bringing out the best in everyone who graced the screen in this film - ALL of that aside, I was really there primarily for Diablo Cody.  Her unique and singular voice can tell a story like no other, and few can touch her in the one-liner department.  She's beautiful, quirky, intelligent, unashamed, unapologetic and completely irreverent.  Cody has carved out a new voice in the world of horror, simultaneously paying homage to the classics while somehow also managing to create something no one has ever seen before.  In a world of Hollywood-ized remakes, where a film's soul can literally get lost in the translation, Diablo Cody and Kusama together have accomplished what horror fans around the world have been aching for, and yet finding so little of, particularly in more recent years.  They've created something new.

Written and directed by women, and featuring two strong women in the lead roles, this film is, refreshingly, for everyone.  As producer Jason Reitman put it, the film's premiere played like a rock concert.  Personally, I can't wait to see it again.",1277251200,,3578,4.786644951140065

Initially when I walked past this in the video store; I thought, it's probably going to be a stupid movie about zombies.  But, I finally decided to get it and see what it was like, because I like Megan Fox from the Transformers movies.  And as it turned out, this dark comedy had tons of blood, guts and gore; like the part when Jennifer (Megan Fox) was bent over the Colin kid, drinking blood from his torn open body, that was just disgusting or her puking up that rank grey crap all over Needy's kitchen floor.  Yuck!  But, I have to say, I liked this movie.  It was more comical than horrorifying.

Check out all the comical one-liners and different hilarious quotes:

* ""Hey Monostat, What's up, Vagisil"".
* (Chip stabs Jennifer in the stomach and she grabs it, pulling it out and then looks down) ""Ow, ow, ooow... you got a tampon.  No.  Thought, I'd ask, you look like your plugging""
*  ""Hell is a teenage girl"".
*  ""Do you buy all your murder weapons at Home Depot? God your butch.""
*  ""It's freak-tarted.""
*  ""I'm going to eat your soul and s%*t it out Lesnicky!""
*  ""My tit.  No your heart.""
*  ""And now, I'm eating your boyfriend. See? At least I'm consistent.""
*  ""I thought you only murdered boys?  I go both ways!""

As for everyone referring this movie to Juno, I've never seen that movie, so I don't know what any of you are talking about.  And the writer/producer, did an excellent job with the concept of the movie.  I like the idea that the teenage hottie town b*tch was basically sacrificed because the stupid band, Low Shoulder thought she was a virgin.  A hot girl like that, never stays a virgin for long.  And, what I thought was weird is that the band didn't have a clue she ended up alive, after the lead singer basically savagely murdered her and the ritual didn't go as planned because of demonic transference, which means- because she wasn't a virgin, the soul wasn't pure and instead of dying, the soul was lost and an impure soul went in return, to allow the sacrifice to successfully work for the band .  I mean, they ended up getting what they wanted, wealth and fame, but their ignorance basically ruined a friendship, and that's sad.  I mean, Jennifer feeds off Needy's bf and it kills him and Needy goes crazy because of it and intends on killing her, when in fact it's not really Jennifer doing it, it's the demon wanting blood.  But, I like the idea at the end, when Needy realizes the necklace is what bound Jennifer and Needy and rips it off of her, and they both fall from the air and Needy stabs Jennifer in the heart.  I also like the ending, when Needy gets part of the demons powers, because of Jennifer biting Needy.  I don't think there will be a second movie to it; cause, just because he has powers doesn't mean she's a demon like her bff.  And I like the ending, where Needy finds the knife that lead singer stabbed Jen with and sets forth on the goal to off the man and the band, basically- do unto others as they would do unto you.  She did everyone a favor by killing them, so that their greediness wouldn't kill another living soul.  They got what they deserved.

All and all... I'd give this two thumbs up and 5 raving stars.  As stupid as I thought this would be, I liked it very much and want to buy it- so that I can veg out Saturday nights and watch it, laughing my butt off.  I like a good comedy, but this isn't just an ordinary comedy, it's a dark teen comedy!  Plus, you get to see two beautiful girls, making out and Amanda Seyfried get revenge!!!

3993462,1,B002USF1VS,"""Jennifer's Body"" is the kind of film that should remind us all that it takes a lot more to be clever, hip and interesting, then merely spouting a few modern slang terms and a sexy pout. They try to play up a campy teen angst kind of thing here, but it never rings true. It's more like pseudo-angst, thought up by a focus group of Hollywood suits, that tries to play to what they think teenagers would find ""cool,"" only to fail miserably in the attempt.

The premise of this tale, is about how a teenage babe (played by Megan Fox) is sacrificed to Satan, by a loser indie band in the hopes they may be granted fame and fortune, only for her to become a flesh eating demon, because she wasn't a virgin when she was sacrificed. No, really, that is the basic plot outline here.

The film tries to come off as an edgier mix of ""Mean Girls"" and ""Scream,"" but ends up as merely a putrid pile of trash, that is way too self-absorbed and into itself, and comes across as thinking it is way more clever and hip than it actually is. Most teenage horror-comedies are an extremely superficial affair, but this one is shallow at BEING shallow. There's nothing here beneath the surface at all. No insights, no meaning, no message. Heck, there's no real laughs or scares, either (unless you count the row of 18 year-old guys up in front of me, who giggled at the make out scene with Fox and Seyfried). Like some vapid teen pretty girl, the film never looks out of it's own self-induced tunnel vision, thinking itself way too smart and cool, and the film loses any chance to be relevant or entertaining. It's not just style over substance, but a self-deluded and half-formed idea of style over substance. Why have a coherent story and plot? Look, Megan Fox is swimming naked in a lake! Isn't that just so awesome?!

It seems little thought was put into the script, direction, or anything else. It is merely a vehicle for Megan Fox to look ultra-sexy (in that slutty way she usually does). No one ever bothers to go beyond this, as everyone else is just some stereotype or cipher character, used for the demands of Fox's character, who looks like she has a totally vacant expression throughout the whole movie (the very same one you'll probably have, after you watch this crap). The only thing it goes to show, is that Fox is truly a horrible actress and is certainly not up to the task of headlining a film. It takes a lot more than a few cute slang terms being thrown around, and some pathetic attempt at controversy (with a little girl-on-girl make out moment), to make a worthwhile story. Honestly, the thing feels like it was written by a couple of 13 year-old boys, who got a look at their father's Playboy collection for the first time, and thought this would be a great idea for a film. It is just a blatant attempt to appeal to the ""teeny-bopper"" crowd, who love films like ""Twlight"" and the like, and has absolutely no regards to the intelligence of the target audience (or any other audience, in general).

This is, without a doubt, the worst movie I've seen all year. If this doesn't register on many a film critics and film fans ""worst of"" lists for 2009, I fear for the mental sanity of the industry. ""Jennifer's Body"" is honest as a title for this travesty of celluloid, though, as the only thing the film ever concerns itself with is how ""hawt"" the title character looks. Unless you are a hormone-raging teenage boy, with Megan Fox as your ultimate fantasy plaything, avoid this dreck at all costs! Heck, even if you are one, you should avoid it, as even hormone-raging teenage boys deserve to be marketed to better than this.",1272585600,2,3625,4.487878787878788

This IS a really GOOD movie in my opinion. I think that, for a teen-horror film, they injected way too much humor into it. But hey, it was scary and funny LOL. The only part of the film that I honestly didn't like is when the goth and/or emo kid gets killed. I really did not want him to die.

Ok, if you're going to bring religion into a supernatural demon satan horror movie, and as a side note, discredit Christianity with ""they said I should except Jesus into my heart...but it didn't work""...(Jesus the Christ who historically did a lot of demon butt kicking...not to mention satan) and then have the possessed girl (Megan Fox) ""transfer demon power"" to her best friend...well the story line becomes ignorant...like Miss Fox's statements last year.",1269820800,2,674,5.081081081081081

Much to my surprise I was consistently engaged by this flick.  This is no sophomore jinx for scribe Diablo Cody.  Her script is at turns witty, literate, sexy, funny, and scary.  The film at times teeters at being a parody of horror films but ultimately it can rest with some of the better ones.  Megan Fox star should rise in the title role because she successfully alternates between spooky and seductive.  Amanda Seyfried is equally fine as Jennifer's friend Needy who is torn between helping her and stopping her reign of terror.

3993467,4,B002USF1VS,"Megan Fox and Amanda Seyfried star in this chilling tale about demonic possession.

Jennifer (Fox) and Needy (Seyfried) are best friends, but they couldn't be more different.  Jennifer is the cute cheerleader type, while Needy is the class nerd.  But, they've been friends since childhood.  One night, the girls decide to go to a local road house to see a new band called ""Low Shoulder"".  Jennifer and Needy try to impress the lead singer (Adam Brody).  Soon, the music starts, but then a fire breaks out, killing several people and forcing the others to flee.  Jennifer and Needy manage to make it out alive, but Jennifer mistakenly accepts a ride in the band's van, leaving Needy alone.

Later that night, Jennifer shows up at Needy's house covered in blood and vomiting mysterious black goo.  However, the next day, Jennifer appears perfectly normal.  But is she?  In the days that followed, several male students were brutally murdered. All were seduced by Jennifer.  In the meantime, Needy has begun to suspect something strange about her friend.  Will her suspicions prove to be true?

I found this movie to be very good.  Megan Fox does a good job as the sexy Jennifer, and Amanda Seyfried is good as the loyal friend Needy.  The special effects are well-done, too.

I recommend this movie very highly.  Horror movie fans will enjoy this one.",1269216000,3,1349,4.842105263157895

Having pretty much the same taste in flicks as them, I passed this by for a while. Then I took a chance and added it to my NetFlix queue. Boy am I glad I did.

It could have been that I had such low expectation of it, but this movie really was fun. There are a few movies out there that make me feel like a kid again. Disturbia, Juno, Where the wild Things Are, and now Jennifer's Body. I love the little high school comments, clicks, how everyone talks and acts.

The movie takes place in a smaller town. I come from a semi-small town, which has grown into a small city since they put up the second largest Wal-Mart on the east coast about 10 years ago. I can relate to some of the stuff, which makes it even more fun.

It is by no means my new favorite movie. However, it is rare for me to have so much fun with a movie, and a horror movie at that.

If you are a 17-year-old boy who is in love with Megan Fox, you may want to pass on this one. I thought she was kinda cute in the first Transformers movie, but after this, she just grossed me out. You'll see.",1269216000,,1219,3.9836065573770494

These days its all about shock factor and sometimes I just wanna see a good old fashioned fun scary movie. This is for sure a hilarious and fun movie that has been long overdue! I reccommend this movie to anyone who wants to take a break from all the rape scenes and torture devices in most of the scary movies made today.

Because if you gave Jennifer's Body 4 or 5 stars, there aren't enough stars for you to give the movies on my Amazon Listmania List of 19 Flicks Guaranteed To Leave A Permanent Impression (see link as the first comment to this review).

I mean really, 5 stars for Jennifer's Body? Teehee. That's a doozy! Jennifer's Body had a few good scares; it had some witty lines and dialogue. It even had Megan (what a) Fox. But overall it was just dumb. Director Karyn Kusama was able to put together some cool scenes and a potentially neat story. But her ability to weave it together in a believable way failed miserably. And I think Jennifer's Body was supposed to be funny--like dark comedy funny--at times, but that was lost on me too.

The flaws are just too plentiful to start listing in this story about a girl who becomes possessed after getting too close to a Satan worshipping rock band. Let's just say that after watching Jennifer's Body you might think that the 80's B Horror movies that you're so glad are gone may unfortunately be trying to make a revival.

I'll tell you one group of folks that should stay away--far away--from this movie are the folks affected by or familiar with the 2003 tragic fire in Rhode Island at The Station night club. There is an early scene in this movie that is eerily reminiscent of that horrible fire. I'm sure that Director Kusama had no intension of mocking or making light of that incident in this film, but the folks in Rhode Island may not agree.

The dialogue in this flick is some of the most idiotic I've ever encountered. It's cringe worthy at times and will insult your intelligence at every turn. Avoid at all costs.

STARRING: Amanda Seyfried, Megan Fox, Johnny Simons, Adam Brody, J.K. Simmons, Kyle Gallner, Josh Emerson, Chris Pratt, Sal Cortez and Ryan Levine

WRITTEN BY: Diablo Cody

DIRECTED BY: Karyn Kusama

Rated: R
Genre: Horror / Comedy
Release Date: 18 September 2009

I never thought I'd see the day where Megan Fox would actually bring something positive to a movie. I can honestly say that Jennifer's Body would not have been as good if Fox wasn't in it.

Don't get me wrong, I still think she is quite possibly the worst actress out there, but she is perfect for the role of Jennifer. Did her acting improve? No. Why do I give her so much praise for her performance then? Because she isn't exactly acting; she's more or less playing a version of herself: the stuck-up, rude, snobby and ignorant, pretty girl that every guy would love to sleep with... prior to her opening her mouth.

Seriously though, Fox did a better portrayal of this character than any other actress could have. Her ridiculous personality and limited vocabulary is what the character calls for; and it's what makes the movie work.

The story focuses on a teenage girl known as Needy (Amanda Seyfried). Her best friend is Jennifer: the hottest girl in school. Needy is considered to be less attractive and kind of a loaner by high school standards; but the two are best friends nonetheless.

Despite the fact they haven't graduated high school yet, the two are permitted into a bar where a popular band called Cold Shoulder, is playing. When Needy won't accompany Jennifer to the band's van afterwards, Jennifer goes ahead without her.

She returns to Needy hours later, covered in blood and seems drastically different. She has a strong demonic presence to her and Needy is frightened but still agrees to be her friend.

Needy soon discovers that Jennifer has been eating boys from their school. Yes, literally eating them... to death I guess you would say. Something traumatic happened to Jennifer when she got into that van with those creepy guys, and now she's taking her aggression out on any and all male adolescence.

Their friendship begins to change as Jennifer becomes even more selfish and cruel than before and Needy can't stand it any longer. Jennifer has to be stopped. She's simply killed too many boys.

One of the best scenes in the film takes place between Needy and her boyfriend Chip, played by Johnny Simmons. She explains to Chip ""Jennifer's evil"", he responds with ""I know"", to which she adds, ""No, I mean she's actually evil... not high school evil."" That one line pretty much sums up the film's premise.

Director Karyn Kusama has created a unique film from Diablo Cody's terrific screenplay. It has elements of a great comedy and a chilling horror film. Jennifer's Body has some vividly detailed cinematography as well.

Kusama has made a film both guys and girls will appreciate. Guys will love watching because she goes to great lengths to show how `hot' Megan Fox is. I can't even say that, I'm going to change that to `physically hot' because that's really all she is. Girls will enjoy laughing at the underlying themes that most guys will miss; regarding how cruel teenage females can be to each other.

Another good quote from the film comes from Jennifer herself. As she tries to kill Needy, she reminds Jennifer ""I thought you only murdered boys"", and Jennifer replies, ""I go both ways."" Seeing it in text, does it no justice. Fox's delivery is priceless.

The film is filled with countless other innovative one-liners thanks to the artistic mind of Diablo Cody; the Academy Award winning writer of Juno, who by the way, used to be a stripper. She will probably forever be the only person to go from stripper, to Academy Award winner. I wonder if any Academy Award winner will ever turn to stripping. I wouldn't put it past Megan Fox, but she'd have to win an Oscar first.",1266796800,,3892,4.767857142857143
3993475,1,B002USF1VS,Anything made by the pathetic Diablo Cody (juno) needs to be in hell itself with hime and every copy of Juno.  As for this film it's nothing special and every prediction you have when seeing the cover is obvious and correct.,1266710400,4,224,4.463414634146342
3993476,2,B002USF1VS,"Jennifer's Body is a movie with one goal, to make Megan Fox sexy even when she is devouring high school boys. Yes, she is still stunning even with blood dripping from her mouth but I wanted so much more from this movie! Like maybe actually being somewhat frightened.
My expectations going into this movie were low to begin with. Megan Fox is this movie's only redeeming factor. Jennifer, once a normal teen, now has an ungodly appetite for human flesh, especially boys. Why an appetite for human flesh? The answer made me roll my eyes and laugh. I won't spoil it for you but I found it cliche and unoriginal.
I will give credit for some good acting. However, this movie lacked even one truly scary moment. After all my negative critiques I will give credit to a somewhat unexpected ending.
I don't know what occasion I would recommend this movie for. Possibly if you're bored or the horror section at Blockbuster is rented out, then maybe you should watch Jennifer's Body.",1266537600,,972,4.656976744186046
3993477,3,B002USF1VS,"For all the guys (and girls) that have ever declared they were buying a copy of playboy or penthouse to read the editorials, there is now, ""Jennifer's Body.""  Let's be honest, to watch this movie and criticize its plot development or cinematography is like kicking and screaming about a Kryzstof Kieslowski trilogy for lacking in Transporter-style car chases.  You're not being honest with yourself.

If you have seen this movie, rented it, or bought it, you're only here for one and only one thing: Jennifer's Body.  For guys (and some girls), it's obvious.  For girls, it's purely to check out the competition and how hard we now have to work to live up to what everyone else considers the current gold standard. (Megan Fox is presently voted the World's Sexiest Woman, unless you live in Kenya or Java)

Fox delivers, definitely demonstrating that she deserves the throne more than her predecessor Angelina Jolie.  Although....Amanda Seyfried (of ""Dear John"") puts in a hysterical display attempting to look like an unattractive geek (she is not).  Johnny Simmons fills in the duties of the trendy, omniscient Seth Rogan Syndrome, providing hope to all lifelong single nerds that they can, indeed, land a hottie like Seyfried (they won't).  Amy Sedaris, IMHO, steals the show as Seyfried's mom.  Sedaris, as the notorious Jerry, of Comedy Central's biggest outcast, Jerry Blank of Strangers with Candy, here becomes the concerned parent.  Like mother like daughter, because Sedaris, like Seyfried, barely succeeds in hiding her good looks.

The acting is horrible, the goth is of the Hot Topic variety, the soundtrack music covers are laughable, and the fear factor is about as suspenseful as the next Macy's sale (every 23 hours).  On the aforementioned departments, the movie gets a 1.  But as I have said before: NONE of us are here for anything other than to ogle and gauge Fox's hottie index and Jennifer's Body: how we covet, lust after, or have to live up to or be compared with the most prized geometry of present day.  Here, Megan Fox and Amanda Seyfried scores a 5.

How we rate each film is based on what we are looking for.  So the median here would be a 3.",1266451200,3,2172,4.842818428184282
3993478,3,B002USF1VS,"Not quite the horrorfest I hoped for, but still bloody and gory with a touch of satanism.  Fox's character is a typical pretty, popular mean girl, only in this case she's friends with a girl next door type.  Then one night she is sacrificed and a demon enters her, making her even more evil with the need to feed.  Her best friend is the only one in the know and no ones believes her, so it is up to her to stop Jennifer.  The worst part is we know all along whats basically going to happen, since the movie opens with Seyfried's character in prison.  I dislike when movies open with the ending as it ruins a lot of the suspense.  But all in all, great acting on Seyfried's part and Fox worked her assets, but it could have been better.",1266105600,,736,4.184397163120567
3993479,3,B002USF1VS,"I first heard about Jennifer's Body (2009), the horror film inspired by the Hole song of the same name, in July. I saw the red band trailer for the film and it called attention to all of the things a movie like this wants to market: the promise of hot girls kissing each other, and gruesome slaughter. It seemed as if the audience for this film was fairly clear: teenage boys. Nevertheless I decided I should give it a shot.

When I entered into the theater several thoughts went through my head. The film was already receiving lackluster reviews online so I was beginning to doubt the movie's ability to truly deliver. Deep down inside I wanted this movie to succeed! The yearning for success was not help Megan Fox's career, but to aid Diablo Cody (the film's writer) in proving she wasn't just a one hit wonder riding on the proverbial coat tails of her debut effort Juno (2007). No doubt the woman knew how to turn a phrase, and make hilarious pop culture references, but could she deliver it again. The answer: partially.

The writing in Jennifer's Body is too deliberately stylized. The phrases and pop culture references that Cody uses seem to be present for the sheer sake of meeting a quota. It is as if she undertook the painstaking task of reading through the script and inserting one of these signature quips every ten minutes. The phraseology overkill was a big turn off for me.

I also didn't understand or like the brief introduction of Jennifer's police cadet boyfriend in one of the earlier scenes. It was pointless. Actually I thought he died in a fire at the rock concert and then she references him later.

But that is not to say that the film does not possess some redeeming qualities as well. The heavily talked about salacious same sex smooch between Megan Fox and Amanda Seyfried definitely lived up to the hype and after hearing Cody justify it's presence in the film I am sold on it. It did indeed emphasize the romanticism associated with the relationships of teenage girls.

Cody also makes a brief cameo in the film.

Although generally I feel like Jennifer's Body had a lot more bark then bite it was not terrible. I don't feel like I wasted my time of money like I did at the end of Transformers 2. Hands down the best scene in the film is when Jennifer barges into her best friend's house covered in blood and attempts to tear apart a Boston Market chicken on the kitchen floor. Once you've seen Megan Fox do this it kind of takes the sexy down a couple of notches. Not to mention she then spews what can only be described as ""pure evil"" all over the floor and runs off.

It is the kind of film that they could have done a lot more with in my opinion. Overall I believe Jennifer would describe the film as ""salty. On a scale of 1-10 I would rate this film a 6 for valiant effort. Is it bad that the whole time I was watching the movie the Hall and Oates song ""Maneater"" was going through my head?",1265932800,,2928,4.421150278293135
3993480,5,B002USF1VS,"Horror-comedies are one of the hardest hybrid genres to do right - the contrasting elements tend to choke each other out.  Now, a lot of horror movies haves touches of humor added in that work well (although I can't think of too many straight-out comedies that add in brief scenes of horror - that probably wouldn't work out at all).  But Jennifer's Body is one of the rare exceptions that other hopefuls in the field could take a cue from.  With perfect casting, it stars Megan Fox as popular, super-hot head cheerleader Jennifer and Amanda Seyfried as her adorably nerd-ish best friend, nick-named 'Needy'.  Interestingly, although a lot of comedies work at making their leads precisely fit their stereotype niches, both the lead characters have more depths and between-the-lines character traits than might be expected.

  The title ""Jennifer's Body"" refers to the possession of, well, Jennifer's body by a demonic entity, but rather than the demon taking over entirely, the result is a being who's a mix of the demon's personality and Jennifer's original personality.  For the storyline beyond that, it's difficult to know how much to say.  The movie is designed in a way that you don't necessarily 'get' what's really going on until later in, although the trailers and promo material revealed an awfully lot of it well before the movie even opened.  In trying to walk a line between giving away too much information and not saying anything at all, I'll say that the plot involves a Satanic sacrifice gone wrong (leaving aside the question of whether there's any such thing as a Satanic sacrifice gone right?)  The motivation behind the sacrifice and its exact nature would probably sound quite stupid if I wrote it down (I thought it sounded stupid when I first heard about it before seeing the movie, but it works vastly better on screen than it sounds) but suffice it to say that this angle would never have worked in a more or less 'straight' horror movie, would never hae worked in a comedy, would Only have worked in a movie that expertly balances both those elements and managed to have them complement each other, not cancel each other out.  The botched sacrifice generates results that the killers had hoped for - vast personal gain - but also an unexpected result: a town resident walking around with a real, hellspawned beast living inside them.

  Again, its horror-comedy nature works to the movie's advantage, allowing it to explore contrasting directions that it otherwise couldn't have.  It's funny, bloody, sexy, creepy, surreal and at times unexpectedly touching.  One particular scene stands out in my mind as one of the most visually iconic scare moments in a while, and another stands out as one of the most memorably and movingly beautiful images.  Very well acted, with an unexpected finale to die for.  Definately one of 2009's most under-rated movies.",1265846400,8,2880,4.925465838509317
3993481,4,B002USF1VS,"While FOX promotes all the other movies on its roster, the movie at the bottom of their agenda, may have been the one that should have been at the top. Don't get me wrong, it was a bad year for FOX, but JENNIFER'S BODY, while it may not be intellecual or have top known actors in it, it is, for all intensive purposes, sheer fun and constantly interesting.

Dismally promoted, JENNIFER'S BODY was shrugged off by its studio as a disappointment, but in the end, JENNIFER'S BODY will probably be one of the movies where, in a few years, or a few months, people will still be watching it. People will still have to get it off the shelf and check it out again and again, because its fun. It isn't all that scary, although it has some scary stuff in it. It's more along the line of 80s movies like NIGHT OF THE CREEPS. It's fun. It's eye candy. It's plain and simple, entertaining.

Amanda Seyfried and Megan Fox are two of the hottest actresses in hollywood right now, and I don't mean HOT as in HAAATTT! I mean HOT as in, getting jobs and getting good jobs and continuing to deliver time after time. Especially Seyfried who is fast becoming one of my favorite actresses. She preys on the audiences natural reaction to find her adorable and cute and then does things either sexy or shocking and it works in JENNIFER'S BODY like a charm. She plays Needy, a nerdy girl who everybody thinks is a lesbo, except for her, who watches the world around her, including her friend Jennifer, become stranger and stranger as dead bodies keep popping up. Is she crazy? or is she just a gulible friend?

JENNIFER'S BODY has everything it needs and more to be a movie that will stand the test of time, despite the poor promotion it received from its studio. Unlike most movies that are forgotten as soon as the credits hit, BODY is a repeat viewer and a fun trip with two actresses who will be around for a long long time.",1265500800,10,1903,4.385269121813031
3993482,3,B002USF1VS,"You might think, judging from the commercials, that Jennifer's Body is about some high school queen bee that uses her unholy popularity to cut a bloody swath through cliques and clich&eacute;s of all types.  Alternately, you might think it's basically soft-core porn featuring Megan Fox.  None of these marketing approaches served Jennifer's Body well. Please note: this review contains spoilers!

Diablo Cody, who earned a reputation for smart dialogue from Juno, isn't interested in writing a horror flick.  She wants to delve into the issues of friendship and sexual maturity, as viewed through the lens of demonic possession.

Right, about that. In a fashion similar to Ginger Snaps (which combined lycanthropy with puberty), Jennifer (Megan Fox) is now the sexiest girl in high school.  Her best friend, helpfully identified as ""Needy"" (Amanda Seyfried), has nothing in common with her.  In a twist on the old trope, it's Needy who has the boyfriend (Chip, played by Johnny Simmons).

The two end up at a dive bar for an emo band, Low Shoulder.  Low Shoulder is actually a band of amateur cultists who believe, on the strength of Jennifer's transparent lie, that the hot chick oozing sexuality is in fact a virgin.  This leads to a hilarious misunderstanding with hell, in which Jennifer is sacrificed only to return from the dead as a succubus.

Jennifer's Body waffles between horror tropes of stupidity - the band believing Jennifer's lie; Jennifer's ability to get away with murder; victims doing really dumb things - and mood-killing reality checks.  The murders are drawn out over time, such that the high school deals with them in a realistic way reminiscent of other real-life high school tragedies. Midnight vigils are held, jocks cry, and camera crews roll tape.

Although Jennifer's Body is supposed to be about its namesake, we get precious little insight into Jennifer's thoughts.  The film is actually about Needy, who is a typical ""Final Girl"" of horror movies.  Like the legions of Final Girls that have gone before her, Needy is psychically connected to Jennifer in a way that's never explained.  This movie is much more about Needy, her boyfriend, her ""nerdy"" persona that's never convincingly portrayed, and her awkward relationship with Jennifer.  Jennifer's Body tries hard to imply there's some chemistry between the two of them, but it just doesn't click.  Jennifer comes off as uniformly one-dimensional and Needy as a disconnected cipher.

The pacing in this film is incredibly jarring; at various points, Jennifer just jumps out the window and exits a scene.  The movie starts to feel more like a series of vignettes than an actual plot.  Cody uses the Lovecraftian technique of ""I was there!"" that is no longer in favor because it saps a film's momentum.

The ending, such as it is, is something of a foregone conclusion - we know that Needy is committed to an insane asylum because as narrator she tells us in the beginning of the film.  But don't worry, Jennifer's condition is some kind of super-virus (you can ""get succubus"" on you, apparently), which destroys any pathos around Jennifer's transformation and turns our Final Girl into a superhero who can fly.  That's right, fly.

Still, Jennifer's Body isn't terrible.  Slickly produced, with competent special effects, the movie tries hard to be both sexy and cool.  All the navel gazing around why it ""failed"" is unwarranted; Jennifer's Body made back twice what it cost to produce.  It's just that Jennifer's Body, despite using lots of ""hip"" dialogue, wants you to like it so much that it throws everything at you: a contrived horror plot, prolonged seduction scenes, a lesbian kiss, and a superhero revenge sequence.  In the era of the Internet, that's not enough to make a great horror film anymore.  It could just have been easily called Needy's Movie.",1265241600,2,3846,5.020504731861199

3993486,4,B002USF1VS,"JENNIFER'S BODY isn't a great horror film; it isn't scary, it isn't even meant to be scary.  What BODY is, however, is a good ol' creature feature, in the vein of such cheesy classics as CARNIVORES and CRITTERS, only with teenagers and quite a bit more gore.  (It even features a cameo from Lance Henriksen, king of cheesy horror films.)

Jennifer is the popular girl--she's hot, she's feisty.  And for some reason, she's friends with ""Needy,"" a rather unglamorous girl who tends to remain on the sidelines.  When Jennifer talks Needy into going to a rock concert, she goes along reluctantly.  And then the club catches fire, people die, and Jennifer is taken away by members of the band.  When Jennifer returns, she's soaked in blood, spewing black bile, and has a rather unappealing appetite.

Amanda Seyfried and Megan Fox give surprisingly strong lead performances; say what you want about Fox's acting (you'll probably be right), but she's got this role down pat, and Seyfried gives a wonderfully understated performance; one almost wishes this wasn't a horror movie, so we could enjoy her acting more.  But it IS a horror movie, and no matter how strong the performances are (including great supporting turns from J.K. Simmons, Adam Brody, and Johnny Simmons), it's the gore and humor that are the main features, and we get both aplenty.  Diablo Cody's script is at times a bit too rooted in pop-culture; we get references that, in JUNO, were kind of cool (but not really), but here are just mundane and, honestly, expected.  Still, the script is solid--the humor is more hit than miss, and there a few laugh-out-loud moments--and Karyn Kusama's directing is spot-on.  JENNIFER'S BODY may fall flat on many audiences; but ultimately, it is a throwback to the creature features of the seventies and eighties, and never really tries to be anything more.  As such, it is a welcome entry in the horror genre, not necessary viewing but not regrettable either.",1264204800,,1960,4.903030303030303

But, if you below the surface, you find an interesting relationship between two BFFs. OK, so what's this about? We are first introduced to two BFFs who have grown differently: one (Megan Fox) is the campus queen cheerleader and the other is not so beautiful or popular. So, it is interesting to watch these two during the movie. Back to the shallow stuff: Fox's character gets kidnapped and turned into a demon who gets food by killing and eating boy-bodies. Well, you can guess the rest of this... There is plenty of blood, guts and body parts. Strategic photography implies alot but shows nothing. Fox is totally hot and worth watching.

3993492,4,B002USF1VS,"A cheesy horror flick focused on teenage lust, violence, and pop-culture?  Sounds cliche, does it not?  Throw in the fact that the main ""monster"" of the film is a smoking hot girl turned into a Succubus and the plot sounds aimed at teenagers even more.  The film was not entirely directed at teenagers, although the entire cast plays up teenage cliches, the story is quite good.  I viewed this film more as a classically styled ""spoof/exploitation"" film such as the many that existed within the 80s.  The acting is not on par with other horror films, but upon viewing the movie you get a feeling that it's supposed to be that way.  It adds to the spoof feeling I mentioned earlier.

The plot begins by showing us an average teenage friendship between two teenage girls.  One of the girls is the stereotypical ""nerd"" while the other is the stereotypical ""cheerleader"".  The two have grown up together, and the film tries to show just how close the friends are.  One night ""Needy"" and Jennifer decide to go to a local bar in order to watch a local band by the name of ""Low Shoulder"" perform.  In the midst of the concert, the bar catches on fire, leaving dozens of people either injured or dead in the wake.  The lead singer of the band offers to give Jennifer and Needy a ride, an offer that Jennifer gladly accepts, but Needy quickly declines.

A few hours later Jennifer is discovered by Needy, covered in blood, leaving the audience to wonder what happened to her.  She suddenly begins to feed off of human flesh almost on a daily basis.  With her amazingly good looks, it is quite easy for Jennifer to seduce teenage boys to the point of total vulnerability, allowing her to feed off anyone she desires.  Every kill makes her more powerful, and more beautiful, renewing her flesh and energy in the process.  However, at the same time, it appears as if Low Shoulder is becoming more popular at the same rate, feeding off of the tragedies of the town to gain stardom.

It turns out that the band Low Shoulder were searching for the perfect way to become famous.  They used their feeling of greed and their need for stardom as a Satanic trade-off for the life of one virgin.  However, unbeknown to the members of the band, Jennifer lost her virginity several years before their encounter even occurred.  What does this mean?  This means that by sacrificing a non-virgin to the Dark Prince that her body will become infused with the spirit of a demon, making her crave blood and forcing her to feed to stay alive.  Feeding off of young hormonal boys, Jennifer has an easy time picking a victim anytime she wants by using her body to arouse her prey and then feed on them when they are most vulnerable.

The story is quite compelling, but the movie is never truly ""scary"".  It contains some scenes of intense violence, but not enough to make you turn away in disgust.  Megan Fox was the perfect actress for the role of a Succubus and she did a great job at portraying the character quite well, despite the overall ""cheesy/spoof"" feeling that the film portrayed.  Perhaps if the film took the idea more seriously and delivered itself in a true ""horror"" sense, it would be more respected; but the current state it was made may turn a few people away who think it's just ""another teenager film"" and there's not much embedded within the film.  If you're a fan of films such as ""Idol Hands"", ""Evil Dead"", and other spoof style horror films, check it out, you may like what you find.",1262908800,2,3475,4.552334943639291

3993497,3,B002USF1VS,"Male critics like Peter Travers, Richard Roeper and Roger Ebert all gave 'Jennifer's Body' glowing three star reviews praising the smarts and wicked wit in Diablo Cody's script. Pretty much everyone else hated the film and claimed it proves Cody got lucky with 'Juno' since she can't write. I loved 'Juno' and not only think Diablo is a clever writer but is pretty hot as well. I was psyched to see 'Jennifer's Body' until I started reading all the negative reviews. I worried it was as bad as people claimed. After seeing it a couple of times I discovered that it is and it isn't. I totally agree with Diablo's detractors who say her hipster slang has to go. It misses more often than it hits and it distracts from the movie. The actors trip over themselves trying to say her lines just right. As if the writing wasn't bad enough, Diablo is one cocky chick. I compare her to someone like Quentin Tarantino. Both came out of nowhere and were immediately hailed as the freshest voices to emerge in Hollywood in years. Personally I feel both are overrated and both have an annoying tendency to take themselves so seriously as artists. All bitching aside I really enjoyed the movie.

Jennifer Check (Megan Fox) is the hottest girl in Devil's Kettle High School. For whatever reason she pals around with a nerdy but cute girl named Needy (Amanda Seyfried). Even though Needy denies it to her boyfriend Chip (Johnny Simmons) she's more than willing to do whatever Jennifer tells her. This includes sneaking into a sleazy bar to watch an indie band called Low Shoulder. As soon as Jennifer sets her sights on lead singer Nikolai (Adam Brody) she's a goner. Needy is more hesitant  after she hears Nikolai mention to his bassist that Jennifer is probably a virgin and would make an excellent selection. The bar mysteriously goes up in flames and Jennifer escapes in Nikolai's van much to Needy's horror. Jennifer returns to Needy's house hours later covered in blood and seriously out of it. She also growls and pukes up black stuff that looks like ""roadkill and sewing needles"" according to Needy. Needy isn't aware but Jennifer is possessed thanks to a demonic sacrifice gone awry. All she can do is look on in horror as Jennifer stalks every guy who has a crush on her and then eats them. When Jennifer sets her sights on Chip all bets are off as these two former best friends face off in a final showdown.

If the film sounds like a rip off of 'Ginger Snaps' that's because it kind of is. Several shots have been lifted from that film but it doesn't matter since 'Snaps' is funnier, sexier and scarier than 'Body'. (The film also rips off 'Heathers'.) Regardless, 'Jennifer's Body' has a lot going for it. The film is hilarious whenever Brody or J.K. Simmons are onscreen. If you loved J.K. in 'Juno' wait till you see him here. As for Megan Fox she's good looking but Seyfried is cuter and a much better actress. Like all the negative reviews predict this feminist take on the horror film will probably become a cult classic in time.

The DVD offers Theatrical and Unrated versions of the film. Each version gets it's own commentary track. Director Karyn Kusama is joined by Cody for the theatrical version. Diablo introduces herself by her real name Brooke Busey and keeps her comments to a minimum. She sounds deflated and bored, perhaps a sign the backlash got to her. Kusama does a solo track for the Unrated version. Running a little over 30 minutes it covers only the differences between the Theatrical and this new cut. Don't get your hopes up for any Megan Fox nudity in this version since there is none. The film's marketing campaign is a major tease.

'Jennifer's Body' is an entertaining film that, while not for everyone, is pretty fun. As one of those male Diablo Cody fans I can't wait to see what she does next.",1262736000,2,3824,4.6259204712812965

Of course it's another film with actors in their mid 20s playing high schoolers which doesn't help... unless the people in that town are as dumb as this flic.",1262736000,5,514,4.537634408602151
3993499,3,B002USF1VS,"Megan Fox has taken over Hollywood by storm, all based on the sex appeal that she has to offer. Tons of pre-adolescent boys had their jaws drop when they first glimpsed her in short shorts in TRANSFORMERS. The fathers who took them to see the film did the same. And now Fox takes her sex appeal image and uses it to full advantage in the film JENNIFER'S BODY.

In the town of Devil's Kettle, Needy (Amanda Seyfried) and Jennifer (Fox) are the best of friends and have been since their early days in the sandbox. Now high school age, the pair is inseparable. This seems strange to some as they are as different as night and day.

Needy is the terminal geek, the blonde who wears glasses and is shy. Jennifer is her polar opposite, the hot brunette the boys drool over who always seems to be the center of attention. While Jennifer is out playing the field, Needy has a steady boyfriend named Chip (Johnny Simmons).

One night, Jennifer convinces Needy to go with her to the local watering hole to catch an up and coming band playing there named Low Shoulder. As the band plays (and as the lead singer's eye catches a glimpse of Jennifer, a girl he believes to be a virgin), Needy notices the place catch fire. Most escape the flames with a few exceptions, among them the band who Jennifer hooks up with for a ride in their van.

Needy drives home only to later be confronted by a blood covered Jennifer who raids the fridge and then spews forth some nasty black bile on the floor. While this might seem a problem at first, it gets worse as Jennifer begins chowing down on the boys from school in order to keep her radiant beauty alive.

Needy investigates what could possibly be the cause and discovers (with a bit of information provided by Jennifer) that the band had taken her to a secluded spot, the namesake of the town (a whirlpool at the base of a waterfall that goes nowhere), and sacrificed her in order to become mega stars. The plan worked with the exception of the fact Jennifer was far from being a virgin which I turn changed her into a succubus, a female demon who keeps from changing by eating the living. Now if Needy can only find a way to stop her.

The night of the prom arrives and everyone is ready to go. Needy tells Chip not to show, even though the pair of consummated their affections for one another and Chip wants to be there with her. Then again this is a horror film and when was the last time anyone took the sage advice of someone stalking a killer? Of course Chip goes, only to be confronted and led astray by Jennifer. Can Needy save him?

The movie offers one thing different than most films and that's a female protagonist who preys upon helpless macho males instead of cowering and screaming like a baby. In this film it's the boys turn to scream.

But while being different, it's the same in other ways with the seductress leading males to a grisly end. From SHE to QUEEN OF THE DAMNED this has happened before. And horror films that dealt with sexuality have been made before, including a bi-sexual scene between Needy and Jennifer that compares to Deneuve and Sarandon in THE HUNGER.

The best this film offers is some witty dialogue and new setting to a familiar tale. The worst is that it offers relatively nothing new in the horror category. Not only that, it takes on a cartoonier atmosphere than one might expect. It does contain gore, titillation without nudity and a nice opening and closing (Needy tells her tale from the confines of a mental institution). But other than that, not much.

If you're a Megan Fox fan, you'll want to own this. If you're a horror fan, you'll want to watch it perhaps once. All others might want to just steer clear.",1262649600,,3692,4.4482248520710055

3993501,3,B002USF1VS,"In 2009, the dark comedy horror film ""Jennifer's Body"" would mark the return of award winning writer Diablo Cody (""Juno"", ""United States of Tara"") and would feature a collaboration with director Karyn Kusama (""Aeon Flux"", ""Girlfight""), actresses Megan Fox (""Transformers"" films, ""Hope and Faith"") and Amanda Seyfried (""Mamma Mia!"", ""Veronica Mars"", ""Mean Girls"").

""Jennifer's Body"" which cost around $22 million to make, earned around $33 million worldwide and has received mix ratings from a variety of critics but earning praise from Roger Ebert and Peter Travers of ""Rolling Stone Magazine"".

Now ""Jennifer's Body: Unrated"" is released on Blu-ray with a special unrated version which includes both the original theatrical version of the film and also an unrated version.  The Blu-ray release also includes a digital copy of the film.

Some of the bass you hear from the film comes from the music but for the most part, the film is front and center channel driven.

JUDGMENT CALL:

I suppose that there are horror fans who felt cheated that ""Jennifer's Body"" was less of a horror, teenage slasher film (despite it having horror elements) and was more of a film that was character driven and really focused on the relationships between Needy and Jennifer.

""Jennifer's Body"" is quite interesting because Diablo Cody is pretty good of writing films, her way, her style and it's a carefree style of showing school popularity and the cruelness that happens amongst students.  And what better way to take on the role of Jennifer than Megan Fox who has wanted to play this type of role.

But ""Jennifer's Body"" for the most part is not a great film nor is it the worst film ever made.  I suppose it all comes down to the viewer and what they were expecting.  Looking for a slasher/gory type of film, well ""Jennifer's Body"" has scenes that look quite disgusting but for the most part, it's not a scary film.  In a way, ""Jennifer's Body"" plays more like a ""Lost Boys"" style of film with the music, dark groups of students in town where bad things happening.  Also, the film manages to incorporate dark humor to the violence, teenage life and relationships.

But everything comes full circle at the end of the film and I really dig how ""Jennifer's Body"" ends so rock n' roll but with tragedy.  A possible sequel in the future?  Who knows.

Megan Fox did a fine job, this may not be the role that utilizes her in a non-sex kitten serious role but for Amanda Seyfried, she really shined in ""Jennifer's Body"" portraying a variety of emotions from anger, fear, sadness, you name it.  It was really good to see her play the character of Needy since her previous films tend to showcase her in a more ditsy type of role.  So, it was good to see her utilized in the film emotionally in a variety of ways.

If you enjoyed the film ""Jennifer's Body: Unrated"" comes with a good amount of special features and you get both the theatrical and extended versions of the film and a digital copy.  But I really enjoyed how the Blu-ray release also gives us a much more in-depth glimpse of the writer Diablo Cody and her involvement in film.  You don't get to see her shown all that much, so it was really cool to see several features with her.

Personally, for ""Jennifer's Body: Unrated"", it all comes down to the viewer. If you are a guy who wants to see Megan Fox, you'll dig the film.  If you are a big Diablo Cody fan, you'll dig this Blu-ray release.  If you're wanting to see the film for a scare, well... ""Jennifer's Body"" is not exactly that scary.  But if you are wanting a popcorn flick that has elements of your favorite teen film and horror elements, you may find the extended version included on this Blu-ray release of ""Jennifer's Body: Unrated"" more to your liking.",1262563200,49,6700,4.841688654353562

3993504,4,B002USF1VS,"I can't help but feel a lot of people out there just didn't get the point of this movie. Its SUPPOSED to be silly, its SUPPOSED to be cheesy and the acting is SUPPOSED to be over the top. Not to mention the dialogue is SUPPOSED to be as idiotic, exaggerated and laughable as it is (Heathers for example). You're supposed to laugh at all these things...the movie makes fun of itself. Its a throw back to 80s horror and its a horror/comedy. While I agree that other horror/comedies have been better (Drag Me To Hell for example) I didn't think this was as bad as many say and I feel it achieved what it set out to do. It sounds to me like many people took the entire thing WAY too seriously, like the creators and the movie itself did not.

Also, I've seen many complain that its just another stupid, failed teen horror and they're sick of that crap...the trailer and the previews made it look like exactly that though. But I was surprised it was a bit more. Maybe that just isn't your thing and I kind of wonder why you were interested in wasting your time and money to see this in the first place?

I thought it was silly, campy fun. One of those movies you can watch and just laugh at. Its filled with over the top gore, some entertaining death scenes, a great soundtrack and some pretty funny one liners...is it an award winner? No. Don't analyze it as such. And if anyone judges a movie based on Megan Fox's acting ability alone...you may as well not bother anyway because, yes, we all know the girl is an abomination to the acting world. Just another in a long line of actors and actresses that get by on sex appeal alone simply because it sells. A tree has more emotion.

I can think of some people I know who would give it 0 stars.  So let me tell you what I liked about it.  1. Megan Fox.  2. It was written by Diablo Cody (Juno) and is filled with her signature style of sarcasm and clever dialogue.  3. I actually laughed out loud and nearly jumped out of my seat.

In the 80's the movie company went out and got Arnold Schwarzenegger, and boom you'd at least get a few million people to see the movie. When I first saw who the main actor they got for this movie I had that feeling all over again. Don't get me wrong, she does make watching a movie more enjoyable, but seriously I'm not stupid enough to waste time and money just to see her with a poor script.

So, that's my view of this movie, at first. I thought hot woman with an awful script. However, after viewing the movie I have to saw I was shock at how good this movie actually was. I had a bad feeling at first that One Tree Hill or some other lame show had made a horror movie. But boy once things got going, it really got going. You should really give it a chance. The best way to go about this movie is that really it's another teen comedy/horror movie, and trust me, this movie will appear more enjoyable",1262304000,,1025,4.074257425742574

Megan Fox is perfect for her role and clearly does not mind getting ugly for the film. Fox's work here is legitimate, she shows range, depth and a knack for Cody's hip dialogue all while keeping her sexuality in check. She shows a professionalism that most people wouldn't expect when seeing her work in Michael Bay's Transformers franchise. Amanda Seyfried is equally good, as always, she delivers a strong performance. The plot is far from stupid, it keeps you entertained, interested and it's never boring. This is fun stuff and I don't want to ruin any of the surprises that Jennifer's Body has in store. Yes, this film is funny, creepy, hip and ultimately loads fun!

Movie:  3.5/5  Video Quality:  4.5/5 Audio Quality:  4.5/5  Extras:  3.5/5  Overall:  4/5

I wasn't expecting much out of this film; I bought it purely to see...you know...Jennifer's body...and maybe some blood and guts! On that level, the movie delivers pretty well; Megan Fox is hot, there is quite a bit of gore, and the movie has some really perverse parts too!

Though the story and characters seem a bit average, they have nuances and elements of their own that distinguishes the film as a unique horror/comedy hybrid.  It ultimately provides an entertaining (and somewhat poignant) reflection of high-school life.  Acting and writing are decent.  The movie is well-filmed with solid photography.  The movie has some interesting transitions and editing effects that make it seem hip, but it is never over-done.  Production design features good sets, props, and costumes.  Music is alright.

This disc does have decent quality.  The video looks very clean, sharp, and detailed, with superb color and contrast.  Film grain is intact and unobtrusive.  Sound quality is good (5.1 DTS-HD).  Extras include a commentaries, deleted scenes, some featurettes, a gag reel, and a digital copy.  This disc includes both the theatrical and unrated cuts of the movie (don't know what the difference is).",1262131200,3,1310,5.2270531400966185
3993511,5,B002USF1VS,"'Jennifer's Body' is a fun, teen horror comedy from the mind of 'Juno' writer Diablo Cody. Megan Fox plays the title character Jennifer, a popular teenage girl who gets brutally sacrificed and later possessed by a demon which requires her to feed on boys. The film is actually centered around Jennifer's best friend, Needy (as played by 'Mean Girls' alum Amanda Seyfried), who takes it upon herself to stop Jennifer.

Jennifer's Body is filled with quirky dialogue and slang that Cody previously made famous in her hit 'Juno', and contains a perfect amount of horror combined with the comedy of that of a teen film. The humor in Jennifer's Body is dark humor, similarly to 2009's 'Drag Me To Hell'.

Overlooked at the box office with disappointing numbers, hopefully this little gem will get the recognition it deserves on DVD and Blu-Ray.",1262131200,2,839,4.901408450704225

The most horror I go is Bubba Ho-Tep/Evil Dead so you know my taste) and sorry boys although very beautiful Megan Fox just doesn't draw me into the box office. I saw the commercials and thought gory cheesy horror flick with pretty girl running around half naked, NO THANKS!
My friend wanted to see it so I went to the Rotten Tomatoes. mixed reviews. I was about to give up when I read a review that said something like Mean Girls meets Heathers meets a horror comedy... hmm that got my attention so I decided to go!
To my pleasant surprise it was a great movie. I love Amanda Seyfried and she is really the main character through the whole movie and she rocks this movie. She and Megan should both be on the poster! It does have some campy moments otherwise the script is witty, funny, and smart. Fox isn't annoying at all in this role, she fits it well and didn't mind not looking unattractive in some scenes. Amy Sedaris was a fun surpise, I wish she was in it more. BUT it still had enough freaky/scary/twist to keep me on the edge of my seats many times yet cuts away on most of the gory stuff. I'm hoping that now it's coming out on DVD a lot more people will see it and see what they missed! I hope it becomes a cult movie! The only thing that kind of annoyed me was what annoyed me about Juno (but wasn't as bad) just some of the teen lingo it just seems like she is cramming in as much as she could.. don't get me wrong I love Juno too.

3993516,4,B002USF1VS,"Jennifer's Body is strictly cult film material with all kinds of pop culture references - both obvious and obscure - to those savvy enough to spot them. In a refreshing tweak of the horror genre, it's not the girls who are the victims of the monster but boys instead. It's not surprising that the film was not a mainstream hit and those obituaries on Diablo Cody and Megan Fox's careers that their critics seemed to take so much delight in writing may be premature.

On the theatrical version of the film there is an audio commentary by director Karyn Kusama and writer Diablo Cody. Things start off slowly as the two women get caught up in watching the film. Kusama praises the ""totally unique"" structure of the script and briefly touches upon what drew her to the project. Naturally, she and Cody talk about the relationship between Jennifer and Needy - the dynamic that plays over the course of the film. They point out that they didn't want to make the boys in the film deserved of punishment - just clueless.

On the extended version, Kusama returns to do a commentary on her on. Thankfully, it jumps to specific moments in this version that differ from the theatrical one. Kusama says that this version more accurately reflects Cody's original script. She explains why this footage has been put back in and, in some cases, why it was not in the theatrical version.",1261526400,3,1370,4.6570247933884295

3993520,4,B002USF1VS,"Jennifer's body is movie about a girl who gets sacrificed to the devil by an indie rock band who wants to make it big, but because she is not a virgin, instead of dying she comes back as a daemon and begins feasting on the boys in her high school. the main character of this movie is Jennifer's best friend, Needy (Anita), who is the complete opposite of Jennifer. Jennifer is the stereotypical popular girl in high school. she's a cheerleader, she's hot/ borderline slutty, and has slept with several of the popular boys. Needy on the other hand is a stereotypical nerd, complete with glasses and a less than conscious fashion sense. she also has a cute boyfriend who is devoted to her. the story is told from the perspective of the friend Needy as she watches Jennifer change.

the story was a decent one... but was suspiciously like the film 'Ginger Snaps', a werewolf horror with the exact same plot. the difference was that ginger snaps was done better, the plot ran a bit smoother and the character relationships were done a bit better as well. the character of Jennifer was portrayed in regards to her sexuality most of the time. even before she was turned into a daemon she talks casually about sleeping with various boys in their high school and uses her body to get what she wants. after she gets changed into a soul-sucking monster, we don't really see her change, just emphasize what was already there. in Ginger Snaps however, Ginger morphs from a social outcast into an animal, riding on her instincts. of course, if i'd never seen Ginger Snaps i wouldn't be overly critical of Jennifer, but i have and i prefer the growth displayed by Ginger to the cardboard sexpot Jennifer represents. but i would like to say that at the end of the movie when Needy 'broke up' with Jennifer, i felt that Jennifer was really struggling with the fact that she was no longer human and no longer had control over her actions, that was the only time i was interested in Jennifer's character on an intellectual level. the character Needy's struggle was more evident as she was the story teller and the audience had to witness the change through her eyes. we get to see how she changes because of her relationship to Jennifer and having to deal with what happened. but again.... Brigette from Ginger Snaps did it better. she was less a victim and more a proactive... fighter of the paranormal. Needy on the other hand was... well, needy. she obeyed Jennifer before the change, and after the change sniffles and goes emo for a bit. she researching possible explanations for Jennifer's behaviour and tries to fight her at the end but i didn't really buy it. Needy was a much more dynamic character than Jennifer was though. and her boyfriend was sweet.

overall i'd say it was a decent movie. i thought that the actors did a good job of playing out their roles and i don't have any issues with the plot despite a few inconsistencies. i would watch it again and would probably enjoy it, but it's not the best movie in the genre, and is not even an original in the genre. i like the genre though, so it's ok. for people who haven't seen Ginger Snaps though... i recommend that you see it, as it is what this wanted to be.",1259798400,5,3210,4.5327586206896555
3993521,4,B002USF1VS,"""Hell, yes!"" In the fall of 2009, I happened to see ""Jennifer's Body"" on the big screen when it was released in movie theaters. I'll be totally honest. I took a chance on this movie and was very skeptical at first. But I really, really, really loved this movie! The reason why I liked it is because I understood it. Like the dark comedy, ""Heathers"" (1988), which loosely inspired it, ""Jennifer's Body"" is a dark supernatural coming of age story. (Both movies contain lots metaphors.) At the time when it was released, reviews for ""Jennifer's Body"" were mixed; a reflection of the fact that many movie reviewers were confused by the story. Is it a horror movie or a comedy? They didn't understand that it is a mixture of both - a coming of age story disguised as a teen horror movie with some black comedic elements, set in a high school.

But the real horror is not the killings shown on screen, but the pain of adolescence. It's not the girl who becomes possessed by a demon and turns into a serial killing machine that is so horrible, but rather that high school can be a mean, vicious, cruel, brutal, and very scary place. (Not for everyone, but certainly for some.) The real monster of the story is not the possessed cheerleader, but what some people transform into as they grow older and leave behind the innocence of their childhood. If you understand that, then the entire movie makes sense. However if you don't understand that or you are expecting a slasher movie which this isn't, you will be disappointed. (Look for the metaphors to understand what the story is really about!)

But ""Jennifer's Body"" is also a lot of fun. My favorite line in the movie is: ""She can fly?!!"" The humorous moments are intended to give the audience an occasional break from the oppressive darker aspects of the story, which deals with a difficult painful age for young people.

The writing and dialogue were really good, as was the directing. As for Fox's acting - she was fine and did a great job bringing the main title character to life. One of the strengths of ""Jennifer's Body"" is that it is a breath of fresh air in the era of massive ""reboots"", prequels, sequels, and remakes. It tried break away from the current trend of movies by doing something totally different. I respect the makers of this film, writer Diablo Cody and director Karyn Kusama, for what they tried to accomplish with this movie. Unfortunately there are way too many filmmakers in Hollywood who keep recycling the same old material again and again. Yet when Cody and Kusama tried to do something new and original, they got viciously attacked for it. Screw the naysayers! As far as I'm concerned, ""Jennifer's Body"" was one of the better movies of 2009.

What shocked me the most was not the content of this movie, but the way some critics had brutally attacked it. It should be pointed out that Roger Ebert, one of the most respected and best reviewers out there, gave ""Jennifer's Body"" a B / Three Stars! (As for all those reviewers who bashed this movie, it is clear that they certainly didn't understand it. I'm so glad that I didn't listen to them and saw this movie on the big screen anyway.)

Although this film may not have done very well at the box office, that is NOT an indication that it is in anyway a bad movie! (Some of Hollywood's greatest movies were not a box office success, while some of its worst were.) J.B. will live on and definitely develop a strong cult following. Not only am I recommending ""Jennifer's Body"", but bought it as soon as it was released on DVD and look forward to watching it again and again! (For other diehard fans like myself, there is also a 112 page companion graphic novel to ""Jennifer's Body"" by BOOM! Studios that expands the story with additional new material.) My one and ONLY complaint about ""Jennifer's Body"" is the DVD commentary could have used a little more energy from the commentators.

I really love this movie and wish there were more movies like it. As the ads for this movie indicated, hell is definitely a teenage girl!!!",1259712000,3,4049,4.593360995850622

3993524,1,B002USF1VS,"Jennifer's Body (Karyn Kusama, 2009)

After I first watched Jennifer's Body, I opined that while I had seen movies as bad as this in 2009, I hadn't seen any that were worse. After a couple of days of reflection, I've revised that sentiment. I haven't seen any movies as bad as Jennifer's Body in 2009.

Karyn Kusama, who directed the incredible Girlfight, seems to have hit a slippery slope right after that. First came Aeon Flux, which was silly, if at least watchable. Now comes Jennifer's Body, sporting an almost unintelligible script from Diablo Cody (Juno), almost no cast with any acting ability whatsoever, and a plot so ludicrous most studios wouldn't have touched this with a ten-foot pole had Cody not gotten an Oscar nomination for Juno. In this one, Jennifer (Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen's Megan Fox) is your typical (in the movies, anyway) restless small-town glamour girl, keeping a geeky friend, Needy (Mamma Mia!'s Amanda Seyfried), around to make her look better and spending most of her time trying to find a one-way ticket out of town. She thinks she may have found it in indie band Low Shoulder, but the band have a different idea; they're looking for a shortcut to success and need a virgin to sacrifice in order to make a deal with the devil. A well-timed lie by Jennifer convinces them that she's their girl. Unfortunately, the band finds out that when the girl they try to sacrifice isn't a virgin, bad things happen...

The first problem with this movie is that while Cody's attempts to write hip, cynical teen dialogue were at least a little constrained in Juno, she's thrown off any sort of inhibition in that regard here. This is not only the worst dialogue I've heard in a movie in 2009, I can't remember the last time I heard dialogue this bad. Starship Troopers and Highlander have Oscar-worthy scripts compared to this idiocy. If you find humor in the line ""you need to just move on dot org, Needy!"", then (a) you'll like this movie a whole lot more than I did, and (b) please stop reading my reviews, because you and I watch movies for entirely different reasons. The second problem with it, as mentioned earlier, is that Megan Fox can't act her way out of a paper bag. I've been hearing for years about how awful an actress she is from younger people, but I've never seen her in anything, and I have to admit I take anything my daughter says about anyone's acting talent with an entire salt lick. In this case, however, she's spot on. She has a repertoire of two expressions, at least in this movie, and delivers every line in a monotone. (She probably would have worked quite nicely in Surrogates.) She's backed up by a cast of actors who are competent at best; Seyfried is by far the most talented person in the cast. As an aside, and this is a far less objective complaint, this is yet another movie where the casting director messed up; for some reason, in movies where there's a glamorous lead and a frumpy sidekick, they always cast the hotter actress as the frumpy sidekick. (Janeane Garofalo is better looking than anyone she's played that role against, for example.) Amanda Seyfried is hotter than Megan Fox any day of the week and twice on Sundays, even when the makeup department frizzes out her hair and gives her supposedly unattractive glasses. (Note to Hollywood: girls in glasses? Hot. End of story.)

I would rather feed myself into a woodchipper than ever have to sit through this monstrosity again. I want back the hour and a half of my life that I wasted on it. I'm sure worse movies have been released this year. I hope to god I never run across one. (zero)",1259539200,36,3622,4.610852713178295

However, Cody decided to go in a completely different direction with a completely unexpected genre: horror. It's a bold move for Cody but a smart one seeing how most would pigeonhole her into a genre if she kept writing the ""Juno""-style films then did a 180. Unfortunately, though, as much as I wanted to like this film, I just couldn't fully get into it. And it wasn't the old school theater I saw it in with its malfunctioning projector or one set of operational speakers or the bitter cold A/C or the chirping crickets that added their own dialogue throughout the film. No. It was none of those things that made me feel the way I did about ""Jennifer's Body"" (taken from the Hole tune off their album&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Live-Through-This/dp/B000003TAY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Live Through This</a>).

I get the entire metaphor here for how evil high school girls can be and transforming that meanness into a horror flick. And, believe me, I love women as the villain (I'm a big fan of Glory, evil Willow and Faith from one of the best TV shows ever created; and if you need me to tell you, then stop reading this review right now. Seriously. Stop.), but there was something that just didn't seem to click here. The dialogue that worked so cutely into ""Juno,"" well, here it doesn't work ... at all. Every time one of the actors spit out Cody's attempt to capture teen speak, I rolled my eyes and threw up in my mouth a little. Now, it did work in ""Juno."" I don't know why. Maybe it's the setting of the film, maybe it's the genre, or maybe it's the actors. Regardless, it just didn't work here. I felt like Regina George from the movie that perfectly -- and greatly -- captures the metaphor of teen girl meanness/evil,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mean-Girls-Blu-ray/dp/B001QU9RTS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mean Girls [Blu-ray</a>], wanting to shout: ""Diablo, stop trying to make (insert lame teen slang word here) happen! It's not going to happen!"" The one who was able to pull off every scene he was in was Adam Brody (""The O.C.""). He has impeccable comedic timing and great screen presence no matter what he does, but he wasn't used that much in here. Maybe that's a good thing. Sadly, three great actors who definitely should've been used more, but weren't are Chris Pratt (""Everwood,"" ""Wanted""), Cynthia Stevenson (""Home for the Holidays,"" ""Dead Like Me""), and Amy Sedaris (""Strangers With Candy,"" ""Sex and the City""). All great actors but poorly underused in this movie.

Director Karyn Kusama's (""Girlfight,"" ""Aeon Flux"") photography style strongly shows hints of John Carpenter's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Halloween-Blu-ray/dp/B000UR9QHQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Halloween [Blu-ray</a>] mixed with Dario Argento's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Suspiria-2-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B000S0GYRU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Suspiria (2-Disc Special Edition)</a>, Carpenter's classic suspense POV with the gore of Argento's gore is prevalent throughout, and while that may satisfy or wow some filmgoers, it didn't do much to impress this one. Fox herself has said many times in interviews that her acting chops haven't fully been put to the test yet in the roles she's received, and, sadly, this role is no different. Amanda Seyfried (""Mamma Mia!"", ""Mean Girls"") does a great job as protagonist Needy, at times channeling Jamie Lee Curtis` Laurie Strode, making it easy for the audience to root for her. But despite the likeable character and the gore, there was something sorely missing from ""Jennifer's Body.""

Or maybe there were some things that could've been taken out. Like the gratuitous making-out kissing scene. Now, I just got a bunch of boo's and hisses from a majority of guys out there. But let me explain. While I definitely understand why Cody put the long kiss in the script, I simply can't grasp the length of the scene, along with the unnecessary close-up. I can't help but imagine a table of studio execs watching the scene and getting a hard-on for the scene, thinking, ""YEAH! We'll get a million just from this scene alone!!!!"" Well, I thought the scene was a waste of time and if Fox thinks she's going to stretch her acting muscles with roles like this, she's sorely mistaken. However, I don't think that's Fox's fault. I think most of the only roles offered to her are of the ""sexy young girl""-type. She and her agent need to broaden her horizons -- take a few indie roles -- and, hopefully, she'll find a role with the substance that she knows she has.

I will say that the soundtrack rocked (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jennifer-s-Body/dp/B002GHHJU4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jennifer's Body</a>) and Cody's overall plot adhered to the usual horror movies with which our generation (70s and 80s) grew up. It's got the flash, fun and edge of a contemporary horror flick, but it doesn't match up to any of the classics. It's not cool enough to be&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Scream-Dimension-Collector-s-Series/dp/630521610X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Scream (Dimension Collector's Series)</a>, but it's also not serious enough to be ""Halloween.""

Nevertheless, there still have been horror movies that -- scary or not -- still are impressionable enough to get high marks.

While this film certainly wasn't great, it was entertaining. The ending was predictable and something to be desired, even though it was interesting to see it play out. But if you're a horror fan, it's definitely worth a rental at best ... since there's nothing special about seeing it in the theater. I can only hope that Cody's next venture will be into another genre with less teen-speak and a little more concentration on plot and acting.",1258502400,9,6917,5.8786069651741295
3993528,5,B002USF1VS,"Now... I know what you're all thinking, what makes a good film and what makes a good movie. Movies are mindless, you sit there and pop popcorn. Films stimulate your brain, make you think and put you in awe. My DVD collection included both 'There Will be Blood' and 'Labyrinth'. A good film, the other a good movie.

I feel like 'Jennifer's Body' was a bit rushed. There were elements, however, that still has my friends and I quoting it weeks after we've seen it. I'm a nineteen year old girl from the suburbs. Diablo Cody writes movies that resonates with people like me. The concept of the movie is, in my opinion, genius. A girl is sacrificed to the devil by a rock band in hopes that they can become famous. And may I say that Adam Brody pulled that role off splendidly. Only problem? Jennifer lied about being a virgin and now she's possessed by a demon, so whats a girl to do? Eat the living to stay alive, of course! The movie is funny. There's nothing really scary about 'Jennifer's Body'. I hate horror films, this isn't one. It's a farce, a play on teenage problems (my best friend uses me, my best friend wants my boyfriend), it has moments of comedy gold. Sadly... Megan Fox only pulls the rabbit out of the hat once or twice. She has moments of brilliance, but they quickly fade.

That is pretty much the entirety of 'Jennifer's Body'. It has moments of brilliance. Some parts are just too funny, too smart, too clever that it makes up for where it lacks. The beginning of the movie, parts of the climax, how it sloppily comes to an end. But... would I tell you to see it? Hell yes. If you take it at face value, it's a great movie to watch on a Saturday night with a bunch of friends and goof off. And really, shouldn't movies be about having fun?",1258502400,13,1761,4.333333333333333
3993529,4,B002USF1VS,"Let's cut to the chase here. Watching Megan Fox strut her stuff will be reason enough for half the people who plan on seeing Jennifer's Body to buy a ticket. Sadly, you don't actually get to see much of her body, but she looks great and oozes sexiness as expected. Her acting is a different story. While she is much better here than in both of the Transformers movies (not really saying much), her voice and line delivery seem very amateurish at times, especially when trying to hold her own with Amanda Seyfried. Amanda turns in a fine performance and it's really her movie, despite the title. Now, I would be lying if I said I didn't enjoy Juno, but Diablo Cody seems obsessed with writing dialogue that no person in reality would actually say. It's not as glaring this time around and some of the lines made me laugh, but lets hope for a little more moderation in the future. This is a horror movie, though it's not very scary and lacks the buckets of blood you would expect from an R rated flesh-eating demon tale. A few creepy moments can be found, but the horror elements seem nothing more than an afterthought. There are some minor gore and gross-out scenes, but nothing as unique or inventive as the well received Drag Me to Hell that came out earlier this year. I think the entertainment value of the characters, dialogue (most of the time) and the eye candy that is Megan Fox makes Jennifer's Body work.

This is a 3 and 1/2 star movie at most, but unlike the Twilight craze going on, guys and girls will like different aspects of it, so I think it deserves a little something extra for including everyone in the fun.",1258156800,7,1627,4.459731543624161

There is a very funny surprise guest appearance from a Juno cast member.  And come on, Adam Brody from The OC plays the lead singer of a devil-worshipping emo band!  How can you say no to that!??!

People, this film was never set out to out-do the infamous Juno or further increase writer Diablo Cody's fame. The way I see it, Diablo Cody loves old campy horror films and she tried to bring them back to the theaters. In my opinion, she succeeded. The film uses all of the old elements that Halloween and Friday the 13th from the insane asylum to dopey teenage kids to a virgin sacrifice. And in this reviewer's opinion, both the director and screenwriter pulled the film off beautifully. Think about it, would you really, really think that the epitomic bitch at your school was a ravaging succubus? No, hence the humorous tone taken when Seyfried (Needy) tries to expose Jennifer. The awkward teenage sex was spot on and the murders were smart so people wouldn't suspect anything. The film was smart, funny and overall a successful campy horror film.

3993534,5,B002USF1VS,"It's hard to explain what's so great about ""Jennifer's Body"" really, especially considering its total fail in the box office. Maybe we have to start with origins. For everyone who isn't aware, the scriptwriter and producer of the movie is Diablo ""Juno"" Cody. For me that name was enough to give a totally different perspective to a movie I'd otherwise probably never even watch.

""Jennifer's Body"" is a dangerous mix of dark comedy, horror and smartass teeniness. Dangerous because it not only works well very rarely, but it's also very hard for the audience to get the right mindset to appreciate it. And obviously the movie failed spectacularly in that last regard, but I honestly believe it wasn't its fault. Because it's DAMN good! Sure, it has its hick-ups, but ""Jennifer's Body"" is smartly written (sometimes TOO smartly), it oozes sexual tension and has one of the best OSTs of the year. It doesn't really try that hard to scare you, but that doesn't stop the scary bits from working really well. And then there is the tampon line...

I don't have any illusions that I'll somehow turn the tide of hate around. I just wanted to put in my two cents.",1256774400,8,1154,4.707920792079208
3993535,4,B002USF1VS,"Jennifer's body is movie about a girl who gets sacrificed to the devil by an indie rock band who wants to make it big, but because she is not a virgin, instead of dying she comes back as a daemon and begins feasting on the boys in her high school. the main character of this movie is Jennifer's best friend, Needy (Anita), who is the complete opposite of Jennifer. Jennifer is the stereotypical popular girl in high school. she's a cheerleader, she's hot/ borderline slutty, and has slept with several of the popular boys. Needy on the other hand is a stereotypical nerd, complete with glasses and a less than conscious fashion sense. she also has a cute boyfriend who is devoted to her. the story is told from the perspective of the friend Needy as she watches Jennifer change.

the story was a decent one... but was suspiciously like the film 'Ginger Snaps', a werewolf horror with the exact same plot. the difference was that ginger snaps was done better, the plot ran a bit smoother and the character relationships were done a bit better as well. the character of Jennifer was portrayed in regards to her sexuality most of the time. even before she was turned into a daemon she talks casually about sleeping with various boys in their high school and uses her body to get what she wants. after she gets changed into a soul-sucking monster, we don't really see her change, just emphasize what was already there. in Ginger Snaps however, Ginger morphs from a social outcast into an animal, riding on her instincts. of course, if i'd never seen Ginger Snaps i wouldn't be overly critical of Jennifer, but i have and i prefer the growth displayed by Ginger to the cardboard sexpot Jennifer represents. but i would like to say that at the end of the movie when Needy 'broke up' with Jennifer, i felt that Jennifer was really struggling with the fact that she was no longer human and no longer had control over her actions, that was the only time i was interested in Jennifer's character on an intellectual level. the character Needy's struggle was more evident as she was the story teller and the audience had to witness the change through her eyes. we get to see how she changes because of her relationship to Jennifer and having to deal with what happened. but again.... Brigette from Ginger Snaps did it better. she was less a victim and more a proactive... fighter of the paranormal. Needy on the other hand was... well, needy. she obeyed Jennifer before the change, and after the change sniffles and goes emo for a bit. she researching possible explanations for Jennifer's behaviour and tries to fight her at the end but i didn't really buy it. Needy was a much more dynamic character than Jennifer was though. and her boyfriend was sweet.

overall i'd say it was a decent movie. i thought that the actors did a good job of playing out their roles and i don't have any issues with the plot despite a few inconsistencies. i would watch it again and would probably enjoy it, but it's not the best movie in the genre, and is not even an original in the genre. i like the genre though, so it's ok. for people who haven't seen Ginger Snaps though... i recommend that you see it, as it is what this wanted to be.",1256688000,,3210,4.5327586206896555
3993536,1,B002USF1VS,"This film was heavily promoted and it was sure to top the box office for the weekend it was released. It landed number 5 and quickly disappeared into oblivion. Maybe it was because kids snuck into the movie instead of paying for it, hoping to see a naked Megan Fox. I knew Fox would not get naked in this movie, so I knew that when I sat down to much this movie. I wanted to walk out within half an hour of this dreadful, so called horror movie. I cannot call it a horror movie because it lacked gore or suspense, I really don't know what category to put this movie in. Amanda Seyfried looked like a grown up Dakota Fanning and she was annoying to watch and her laughable run towards the end made me laugh. It's offical though, Megan Fox is the worst actress in moderen cinema. She cannot held a movie and this just proves it. She is good looking but you can stay home and look at her pictures for free online. She shows no emotion when acting, she'd be better off doing softcore porn rather then mainstream films.

Avoid this film, Megan Fox sucks and not in the good way. It's not a horror movie and I will not be sucked into the ""unrated"" dvd version when it's released. I don't care if it promises to show Fox naked, it's not worth the time.",1255824000,6,1245,4.2092050209205025

I think like most people we were drawn to Megan Fox's hottness, but in the movie she doesn't show ANYTHING special that we haven't already seen. When I was at the theater I heard many moans of dissapointment... And the dialog was ridiculous, what was probably meant to be semi-pornstar turn on...turned out to be downright creepy. Some of Megan Fox's lines were ""He's totally salty"" meaning good looking/desirable? And my personal favorite ""You totally gave me a wetty"" meaning she had a female turn on... I don't think the writers meant for this to be hilarious, but me and my husband got a HUGE laugh out of it.
The story really made no sense, it could have been better I think but it was totally thrown in the wrong direction thanks to Fox's over slutty attitude. I mean everytime she speaks in this movie her words drip with a teenage pornstar tone, and that made it more stupid than it was.

3993538,3,B002USF1VS,"From listening to the reviews, I really wasn't sure what to believe about this film. Half of the reviews I've read have been positive, the other half were negative. For all practical purposes, the enjoyment level of the film depended on how much you liked cheezy horror films & your tolerance level for Megan Fox.

The film follows two best friends, the sexy Jennifer & the wallflower Needy. After a late night visit to the local dive goes horribly wrong, Jennifer decides to hitch a ride with a traveling indie band. After that, Jennifer starts acting incredibly strange & demonic, eating whatever young men strike her fancy. It's up to Needy to attempt to figure out what's going on with Jennifer & how to stop her.

I have to say, this film wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. I love cheezy horror films, but the ones put out nowadays don't have quite the same pizazz that it's predecessors seemed to have in the 60s & 80s. I went into this film expecting that at the very least it would end up being something that would be so bad that it would be funny. After watching the film, I think that it's a good thing I expected to movie to sort of suck.

While Diablo Cody's quirkiness did make Juno great, at the same time it somewhat backfires on her in this film. Cody has the teens saying things that I just couldn't imagine any teen saying even if they were the type to make up their own words. (And the character of Jennifer didn't seem creative enough to make up her own words.) While there are a few cute jokes, the delivery of them just weren't punchy enough at times.

Some reviewer said that in the end, the biggest flaw of the film is that it bogs itself down at times & that's pretty much the main fault of the film in a nutshell. It's a good film & when it's moving along, the film is awesome. It's just the slow moments that remind you of exactly how long you've been sitting in your seat.

Overall, the film is pretty decent. It's worth a rental for when it comes to DVD, but otherwise I'd wait to watch this- it's just not worth paying a whole lot of money for unless you are sure that you'll like it. Horror fans of this type of flick (cheezy horror) will probably like this flick, but others will probably be better off if they skipped it & went for something else.",1255132800,2,2286,4.306976744186047

3993541,2,B002USF1VS,"I'll get the big questions out of the way right away.

1. No, you do not see anymore of Megan Fox than you could see at any public beach (or behind the Beverly Hills 7-11 for a dollar) and 2. Yes there is a brief make-out scene between Megan and Amanda Sieyfried, although I think they used stunt tongues.

  There that should take care of most of the people who are interested in this movie. Unfortunately, if you are interested in this movie because of its screenwriting pedigree, well, you're going to be disappointed. It's the ""anti-Juno"" in all the worst ways.

  Megan Fox plays Jennifer, a gorgeous, shallow somewhat condescending and manipulative prom queen type. Amanda Seyfried plays ""Needy"" her nerdy but deep best friend. One night through a combination of bad judgment and blind ambition, Jennifer is sacrificed to the devil, but resurrected with the spirit of a demon in her body. (I think) She needs to eat a male every so often to sustain herself and it isn't long before some of the local lads begin to lose their hearts to Jennifer, literally. Needy starts to put 2 and 2 together and figures out something isn't right with her friend, what with her(Jennifer) constantly showing up covered in blood and bile. When demon Jennifer goes after Needy's sainted boyfriend, well that makes it personal!

  I've read that this movie is supposed to be a metaphor for why teen-age girls use sex to validate themselves. I guess you could say that, although I've seen the same theme handled much better on many a TV sitcom. Seriously, if Blossom or even iCarly vomited a little more blood they'd have this movie beat all to hell. There are of course a few clever parts. There are a few funny digs against the music industry and a little snazzy writing. But the metaphors and insights are pretty ham-fisted. I probably wouldn't judge it so harshly if Diablo Cody hadn't written it, but she did, and for better or for worse people expect better of her. I think she wrote the screenplay on the can while she was taking a break from writing her ""real"" Oscar contending screenplay yet to come.

  This is pretty standard horror stuff, and a bit uninspired at that. There are a few scares and creepy parts, but that aspect is nothing special. You'd think a writer named Diablo would know more about horror movies and devil worship. But then again you'd think an Oscar winning screenwriter could come up with something better for her Oscar follow-up. There's nothing wrong with her choice of topic. If she had just made a fun, sharp, scary little movie that would have been a fine choice. But this movie is neither fun nor sharp nor scary. Aside from some good, solid acting by Amanda Seyfried and JK Simmons, who is pretty funny as the ""square"" science teacher who is representative of the ineffective school system, this movie isn't worth more than a rental fee. Jennifer's body may be near perfect, but her shenanigans just aren't that interesting.",1253577600,8,2950,4.6937984496124034
3993542,4,B002USF1VS,"Yes, once again, a young newly donned Oscar winning screenwriter turns their attention to the horror genre.  The genre that still doesn't get the respect it deserves.  The genre that has its name changed to something pointless like ""psychological thriller"" when it stars Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins.  A genre that in many a viewer's eyes is only one notch above porn.  Yet, when a studio needs to make a quick buck to finance their next sweeping epic they churn out another horror flick garunteed to make its budget back and turn some sort of profit no matter what.  Jennifer's Body is the current horror release, and while it's not very scary, it's really blackly funny, witty, and FUN.

I know, know, how could something in the horror genre be FUN?  I guess ask John Landis, Sam Raimi, John Carpenter and many others for a good answer.  This is the first film that Meghan Fox has had the lead in.  She's been in three films prior and is already a household name, but this is the first time she's played a title character and had to help carry a movie.  Does she pull it off?  Yes, sorry haters, she does.  I don't know much about her beyond the films she's been in.  I've never read any interviews with her, though I've heard she's said some snarky things.  Good for her.  About time somebody with personality outside the Disney, Myley Cyrus pre-packaged, approved for Christian consumption came along.  I hope she continues to rock the boat, but more in the roles she's in and less for her tattoos and off screen life.  Now I know tattoos are really nifty, cool and interesting...umm, wait, they're not.  My mom is 58 and she has three.  Yeah, it's officially lame and barely worth talking about anymore.  Sorry.  Fox plays her character, her high school's 'it' girl/cheerleader/vapid sex-pot, completely straight and without a wink.  I've met girls like Jennifer.  Unfortunately, I've even dated some like her.  It's a broad characiture but it rings true.  I don't know what depths Fox can plunge for any future roles but this film shows that she DOES have presence on screen and she is capable of playing something believable beyond the window dressing of the next dumb Transformers film.

This film was written and produced by the new Hollywood fad girl Diablo Cody.  So, it's got more in common with Heathers and less in common with A Nightmare on Elm. Street.  So expect tons of witty dialogue and new to the ear vernacular.  Also, don't expect the plot revolving around a man-eating demon girl to be the main focal point or to be taken that seriously--our film's Satanists got their ritual off the internet!  This film is more about sexual and teenaged girl politics in high school.  The demon subplot just seems to be the outrageous catylist that sets the whole thing in motion.  A lot of folks, well not the real critics that are literate and have writing jobs, seem to have a real problem with Cody's turns of phrases and how witty her characters can be.  Why?  Why in this country do so many people feel so threatened by stories revolving around clever or witty people?  ""Nobody talks like that"", is something I hear as a criticism when referring to this film and Cody's other screenplay for Juno.  No, I think what they are trying to say is that THEY THEMSELVES or the people they surrond themselves with don't talk like that.  Sorry, but I've met tons of witty people who talk different and pull a turn of phrase like breathing for air.  Stop bashing wit and intelligence.  Just smile and enjoy.  Lots of great screenwriters have employed such techniques from Quentin Tarantino, David Mammet, Daniel Waters, Kevin Williamson, John Hughs(most likely Cody's main inspiration), and the always reliable Coen Brothers.  Maybe Cody only gets crap thrown at her because she's a woman who writes for primarily female characters.  GASPS and GOD FORBID!

The acting is fun all around.  Beside the main cast we get some moments provided to us from Amy Sedaris(Strangers With Candy), as Needy's mom, and J.K. Simmons(OZ, Spider-Man trilogy, Juno) as a teacher who seems to have had a bad run in with some sharp objects at some point in his past.  Amanda Seyfriend plays Jennifer's BFF, Needy(this is a nick name of course) and she really pulls you into her situation despite how silly and ludicris it is.  I've seen Seyfried on Big Love and I always thought she had a really neat gawky awkwardness.  This movie takes full advantage of this quality and plays it to the hilt but without becoming a stereotype.  She feels like a real teen girl.  The girl who was smart but not too smart, cute but not really into making her self up for hours.  Her big blue fish eyes further the trick by some large framed glasses her character adorns.  I'm not aware of the actor playing her boyfriend, but he is really good too.  These two play a believable couple, and their chemistry is infectious.  Their relationship seems so honest that when the horrific stuff kicks in you really start to worry.

There's some great social satire involving a Marroon 5 wannabe band(THE HORROR, THE HORROR) using Satan as a way to get out of their Indie Band situation and into the big leagues.  It's very funny, and very Heathers-ish, the way the band starts a bar fire, that kills a bunch of people, and then claims they tried saving eveyrone, and then they get famous off of writing a theme song for the tragedy.  It made me laugh very much, and reminded me of all the theme songs past and present that have been written for charity and around tragedies.  It's so mannered and gross that it felt right and really...really American.  Yeah, if you don't believe me, go spin a Toby Keith tune from the last six years.  The idea of a band sacrificing a virgin to Satan to make it big in music was very funny, but it has sort of been done before.  There's this flick called Trick or Treat, which is on DVD, that has a similar horror/comedy plot line.  It's really good and has some cool Kevin Yagher designed make up and creature effects in it.

Bottom line is this film isn't as good as the writer's previous work Juno, it isn't as good as the director's earlier effort Girl Fight, but it is fun and breezy and a very dark, modern, stab at social pratfalls for girls in the teenage set during high school.  No scares here.  The director seems more concerened with the black humor and mood then actually grossing out or scaring anyone to death.  So be warned if you're a narrow-minded, ""hardcore"" horror fan, this isn't your cup of tea.  This film has the wit of Wes Craven's Scream, but not the intensity or scares, so that should tell you something.  It will be a worthwhile rent in about three months, but as far as going all the way out to the theatres, make sure it's a matinee....",1253491200,5,6762,4.608040201005025
