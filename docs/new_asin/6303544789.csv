7849997,5,6303544789,"This tape contains two of my favorite Bosom Buddies episodes: The Pilot and Macho Man.  The comedic genius and talent of these two actors, as well as the whole ensemble cast, is timeless.  I occasionally pull out my old tapes to watch an episode or two and always ending up laughing hysterically.  If you want to be in a good mood, watch this show.",979084800,5,348,4.40625
