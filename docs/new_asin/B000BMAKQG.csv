8088779,5,B000BMAKQG,"It was 1965 when five young men from Chicago became The Buckinghams. Best known as being named ""like the fountain"", they left familiar city streets behind them after their record ""Kind of a Drag"" went to #1 in the country in 1966. Until 1970 the group performed nationally, with over 300 dates in 1967 alone, while adding and dropping a band member here and there. The music stopped in 1970, but in 1980 thanks to Mayor Jane Byrne, 3 of The Buckinghams reunited and broke attendance records with a concert on Navy Pier's Rooftop Stage. After 2 more years, founding members of The Buckinghams, Carl Giammarese and Nick Fortuna, began touring again and performing across the country in earnest, adding new musicians to travel with them on their way.

The 30th anniversary of The Buckinghams performing in concert was captured on film, and is still available from time to time on VHS from private sellers. Directed by L. A. Franicich, the concert footage is powerful, on target, and fun to watch.

What's distracting is the vignettes with one band member skating up and down the sidewalks of Chicago streets (probably lakeside sidewalks), and several silly bits 'behind the scenes,' with two former backing musicians that could have well stayed on the cutting room floor.

The best part of the video is strictly the concert footage. That's what The Buckinghams do best. They could have omitted all the funny segues and still had a solid video. It was interesting to see some of the video from Chicago neighborhoods but for the most part, it was 'filler'. Most people just want to hear the music, and it was covered well on this video.

In ""Off Their Rockers"", Keyboardist Bruce Soboroff shows his vocal and musical talents in several favorite solos. Drummer Tom Scheckel is captured often on camera and the audience definitely knew 'when to watch' for the expected drum stick toss.

Highlights of this video include Carl Giammarese singing ""When a Man Loves a Woman"" and the crowd loves singing the chorus to ""Susan"" when Giammarese invites them to join in. The celebration of 30 years of The Buckinghams at The Vic came complete with a cake presentation and Nick Fortuna's trademark humor at the sentimentality of the moment.

An unexpected highlight at the end of the show was a black and white version of The Buckinghams performing an unplugged set. Carl Giammarese's guitar playing and vocal stylings, especially on ""I'm a Loser"" provide a favorite version of that song. Nick Fortuna sings, dances, and leads the band on ""Expressway"" and ""Domino"", while Giammarese shows he can play the bass just as well as his lead guitar.

Soboroff has a pleasant demeanor and solid keyboard as he navigates the band through a dynamic, fun show. It's clear that there were many great years together for Giammarese, Fortuna, Soboroff, Scheckel and Abrams. Though the last two mentioned have gone in new music directions, this video is worth watching, and owning, for the serious collector, or if you just want to watch great classic rock at its best one Sunday afternoon.

Glad I still have a working VHS player. Maybe the producers will film the 45th or 50th anniversary concert and release both as a box set in a few years. Set your Amazon alerts to see if a copy becomes available in the future. Definitely the best Buckinghams' video around for its time. The 2009 DVD ""Up Close"" is a worthy successor to this film, which was a great start for Giammarese and Fortuna in telling the story of The Buckinghams these many years.",1278547200,3,3513,4.823920265780731
