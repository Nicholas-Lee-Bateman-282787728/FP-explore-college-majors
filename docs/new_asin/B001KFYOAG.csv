It is not only a fun way to exercise, it encourages children to use their imagination.",1518220800,,264,4.3

8314972,5,B001KFYOAG,"My kids went to My Gym for a few months last year so I knew they'd be thrilled to see Mymo's Adventures featuring My Gym`s mascot Mymo. When I asked if they wanted to watch it, my daughter said ""I want to watch Your Gym!"" The MY part of My Gym always confused her because she thought I was saying it was mine!

My son wasn't that interested in watching but as soon as Paige started getting props to follow the instructions, he was back and begging to participate. They start with a warm up and some dancing. The first activity involves getting a broom, laundry basket, towel and place mats for a race down the river and some frog hopping. Paige LOVED this and by the end both kids were fighting over my only broom.

Luckily the next activity was something they could both do with some tape on the floor as a tight rope. At the end of each activity they get points for completing it. They were so into this point system! They would jump up and down and yell ""I got three points"" and ""I won!"" It definitely brought out their competitive nature.

I know I have a winner when the second it ends, they beg me to start it again. I love it because it gets my kids active and more importantly, excited about being active! The DVD is well put together by using real people to show the activities and cartoons to narrate so it holds their attention but also gives them examples with real people so they know what to do.

If you want to get a break from your kids by putting on a DVD for them to watch, don't put this one on! It does require a little participation on the parents part by helping them get the props they need. If you do want a DVD you can all participate in and keep your kids active then this is the one.

Mymo's Adventures from My Gym is a hit in my house with mommy and kids. I'm glad I have a way I can keep them active inside when they can't go out. Thanks My Gym!",1364601600,,1874,4.109289617486339
8314973,5,B001KFYOAG,"my 4 year old loves this.  It is a fun way to get some activity/exercise for them during winter months, and something they can do over and over again.  I like the fact that you do not need special equipment, and they can use their imagination for objects found around the house.",1259712000,,278,4.326923076923077
