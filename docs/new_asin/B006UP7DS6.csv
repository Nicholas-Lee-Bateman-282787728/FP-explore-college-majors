5020114,2,B006UP7DS6,"Draconis March really hit it with his review, and I need to agree full force. Let me make this clear my low review has to do with the price, not with the content of the show itself. Even if the English dub is as horrible as they say (never watched it), I would be more than willing to buy this if it contained the whole 12 episode show to have it in Japanese with English subtitles.

This series is, to be blunt, amazing. It has that girlish, child-friendly look on the cover, but trust me- if you showed this to a five year old, you might traumatize them. It is a total deconstruction of the whole Magical Girl genre (like Sailor Moon, Card Captor Sakura, etc.), deconstructing and tearing apart even the most fundemental themes of those shows usually kept to heart. I cannot go into detail without spoiling the show, but I cannot recommend the show enough.

.... Then, we have the price.

As I'm sure most interested in buying this series know (or even as a gift), anime is taken much more seriously in Japan than America. They have real plots, real development, and are not your normal Saturday morning cartoons. I'm sure in Japan, die-hard anime fans are more than willing to spend 45 dollars on this- even moreso to buy $200+ super limited collector's edition. In America, however, unless you too are a die-hard who really wants to support the industry, that isn't likely to happen. As I said before, even if it was the English dub, as long as it has English subtitles and I could just switch to Japanese audio, I'd buy this in a second for it's price. In fact, I might have even given this a 5/5 review. But, this price for an American release is outrageous. I could go down to Best Buy and buy a full anime for around that price probably.

This is an amazing series, everyone. It is because of it's worth I'm not giving it a 1/5, out of sheer respect for Puella Magia. However, this deal is not worth it.",1332979200,64,1911,4.389830508474576
5020115,5,B006UP7DS6,"I've loved magical girl stories since I discovered ""Sailor Moon"" in the fourth grade. Now, at twenty-four years old, I'm probably too old for them, but the frilly costumes, magic powers, and romance still appeal to my girly side. These days, however, it's rare to find a series that really piques my interest. The plots and characters are often cliche, and the overused ""monster of the day"" formula gets old fast. But ""Puella Magi Madoka Magica"" is just the breath of fresh air this stale genre needed.

Madoka Kaname is an average middle schooler. One night, she has a bizarre dream in which a lone magical girl fights a losing battle against a terrifying creature. A strange white creature tells Madoka that she has the power to change this fate. The next day, she is shocked when the girl from her dream shows up as a transfer student to her school. What's more, the girl, Homura Akemi, watches her, and warns her to stay exactly who she is. Later, Madoka hears a telepathic cry for help, and she and her friend Sayaka Miki save the white creature from Madoka's dream, called Kyuubei, from being killed by Homura (who is in her magical girl costume). They are caught up in a strange world with malevolent creatures, but are saved by another magical girl, Mami Tomoe. Kyuubei explains to Madoka and Sayaka that he can grant them any wish, but in exchange, they'll have to become magical girls and fight monsters called witches...

This story may sound formulaic, but it takes a dark turn in the third episode. I've heard it described as a ""Faustian deconstruction of the magical girl trope,"" and that description is highly appropriate. This is what gives ""Madoka"" its unique perspective. While there are many parodies of magical girl series, ""Madoka"" completely subverts everything these stories stand for, asking ""what if the power of love didn't save the day?"" And rather than forcing dark elements into the formula, it reveals and engages pre-existing but largely ignored subtexts. What would it really be like for young girls to fight terrifying monsters on their own? Are magical girls really ""warriors of love and justice?"" Isn't there something kind of sick about glorifying fighting with pretty frills and sparkles? These themes make ""Madoka"" artistic and thought-provoking, a magical girl series for adults.

The art here is beautiful. The character designs are fresh and interesting, and the backgrounds are beautiful. ""Madoka"" takes place in the near future, and I love the strangely familiar environments. The scenes with witches are innovative, strange, and artistic, like something out of a Salvador Dali painting. This anime was made on a budget, and short-cuts are noticeable in less important scenes, but that didn't lessen my enjoyment. The music is beautiful, sometimes up-lifting, sometimes spritely, and sometimes haunting.

The characters here are likable and very easy to relate to. Madoka feels useless but wants the power to help her friends. She cries once things get dark, which may annoy some, but I think it's understandable. She also avoids becoming too much of a Mary-Sue because she is not given too much focus, and her character development makes her choices believable. Homura is cold and mysterious, but in later episodes becomes a very sympathetic character. Sayaka is a tomboy with a sweet side who believes in justice, and Mami is a kind big sister type. Kyuubei is... suspicious the whole time, though he acts sympathetic to the girls. I also love Kyoko Sakura, another magical girl antagonistic to the others, but she doesn't appear until episode 5.

The Japanese voice actors portrayed the characters very well, and none of the voices annoyed me. The English dub is pretty good, too, though I prefer the Japanese. Fortunately, the subtitles are excellent, sharp and true to the original dialogue.

The story, like I mentioned, is dark, and it has lots of twists. Some will be expected, others less so. I highly enjoyed it for the most part, though certain elements were implausible.

But the problems with ""Madoka"" are easy to ignore because it is so innovative, interesting, and involving. This series is a real game changer and should have a strong influence on future anime. A must-see for fans of the magical girl genre.",1331251200,16,4267,4.9677871148459385

5020117,2,B006UP7DS6,"It wasn't long ago that I shifted my assessment system for anime to a purely critical perspective.  No matter how much I liked the series, I would give it the score it deserved.  Since then, I've found that Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica is the only anime I can honestly give perfect scores across the board (for story, characters, enjoyment, animation, and sound).  It currently sits atop the pedastel as my favorite anime, and it doesn't look like that will change very soon.  (See comments for my actual review of the series.)

Which is why I REALLY wanted to see the series do well in America.  Sadly, that will never happen.

There is a reason why FUNimation Entertainment and Sentai Filmworks are the biggest licensing companies in North America: They know how to pedal anime.  Japan is not the same as the rest of the world: They place a much higher value on their anime.  We do not.  We are not willing to shell out $500 for a limited collector's edition blu-ray set of our favorite series released in volumes containing only 1-3 episodes.  Instead, FUNi and Sentai charge ~$40 for a complete 12-26 episode series on BD--the same content at a fraction of the cost.

Aniplex of America apparently hasn't caught onto this fact yet.  They're going more the Japanese route: release the series in pieces (4 episodes each), each costing an arm or a leg.  (Each piece costs about as much as an entire series from any other company.) This isn't helped at all by one of the WORST, most grossly misrepresentative trailers I've ever witnessed, ensuring anyone not particularly in tune with the anime scene will immediately be turned away from the masterpiece that is Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica.

Top it off with a subpar (to put it lightly) English dub.  The argument that ""it's okay if the English dub is bad because you can still watch it in Japanese with subtitles"" only works if you choose to ignore the fact that a bad dub means that Aniplex doesn't really care about the quality of the release at all.  The voice actresses they use are mostly all new to the scene.  Of course, this doesn't automatically make them bad.  In fact, some are quite good.  For example, Phantom: Requiem for the Phantom featured quite a few inexperienced voice actors--some completely new to the dubbing scene--but they ended up performing phenomenally--especially when one considers how little experience they had under their belts.  Sadly, this is not the case here.  Acting quality ranges from too much emotion, to not enough emotion, to trying to pronounce names correctly too hard, to trying to employ a voice they clearly aren't comfortable with, to voices completely not suiting the character, to just plain bad.

Add it up.  Combine a God-awful marketing campaign, with an outlandish pricing scheme, with poor English dub quality, and you've got a recipe for failure.

For the same price as 1/3 of the entire Madoka series, you could choose from DOZENS of other options and get the same (or more) amount of material for about the same (or less) cost.  Depending on your tastes, what you bought could even be better.  Said list includes (if restricted only to more recent series):  Casshern Sins [24 episodes], Phantom: Requiem for the Phantom [26 episodes], Angel Beats! [14 episodes], ef - a tale of memories [12 episodes], Clannad [24 episodes] (and After Story [25 episodes]), Claymore [26 episodes], and many others.  I already own most of what I listed on BD, and haven't regretted buying a single one.

Only a niche group of diehard fans that are already aware of how awesome the series is and are willing to shell out the cash for it will end up buying Madoka.  This does not include me.  I would definitely have bought the series if the release wasn't so poor.  Think about that: A critic like me won't buy his favorite series.  That should tell you something.

Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica took the anime industry by storm during its Winter-Spring 2011 run.  It has nearly unanimously been heralded as THE anime of the year 2011.  Here is a partial excerpt from the Newtype Anime Awards 2011 (omitting irrelevant entries):

Best TV Anime: Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica
Best Female Character: Akemi Homura
Best Mascot Character: Kyuubey
Best Leading Actress: Yuki Aoi (Kaname Madoka's voice actress)
Best Supporting Actress: Saito Chiwa (Akemi Homura's voice actress)
Best Theme Song: ""connect"" (Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica)
Best BGM: Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica
Best Director: Shinbo Akiyuki
Best Scenario: Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica
Best Character Design: Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica
Best Filming: Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica
Best Art: Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica
Best Color Design: Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica
Best Effect: Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica

The only awards it DIDN'T win were:  Best Film (Madoka is not a film), Best Male Character (there is only one male character of much importance), Best Leading Actor (same reason), Best Supporting Actor (same reason), Best Mecha Design (Madoka is not a mecha), and Best TV Ad.

With such acclaim, you'd think that the R1 release would be done as tactfully as possible, following a tried and successful pricing model, with a superb marketing campaign, right?  You'd think Aniplex of America would want the rest of the world to really be able to see the light of Madoka's awesomeness, right?  Right...?

It's a shame to see that such a great series will never take off in America.  Maybe Aniplex will learn their lesson and re-release it later properly, but I'm not holding my breath.",1330905600,273,5516,4.883870967741935

5020120,5,B006UP7DS6,"I bought this from a different seller but I bought it seeing some AMV's and reading some reviews that this series was really good and unexpected. I agree with the reviews I read. If you love magical girl series, if you love things that take an unexpected turn much like Revolutionary girl utena or Evongalian then this series is definitely worth your time and a second look (not to mention music from the person who did Hack//sign). This set comes with the blu ray and dvd put in a standard dvd sized case, the sound track is also in a standard dvd sized case separate from the blu ray/dvd. It also comes with a mini poster, four post cards that are pictures of the ending shots of each episode, two stickers, all in a BASIC cardboard box (which is pretty mind you).

I have some slight quams over it being a basic cardboard box with the price you pay for it. I'm just used to fundimation's chipboard LE boxes which are a lot less flimsy.

Aniplex released this series (and Aniplex also was the one who released the japanese sets just a little bit of information for the nerd who wants to know all) and even with this price tag (and the one I paid) we're still getting a deal compared to the two episode a disk release the Japanese got.

It's the most I've spent on a single set of anime (and I picked up all the revolutionary girl utena sets rightstuf brought out) but well well worth it in my eyes. If you're not sure on whither it's worth it still Crunchyroll has the subs being released slowly now too so you can check it out there before you make your buying decision.

The blu ray is vibrant and gorgeous for both colors and just movement shown (and the witch relms are just utterly mind boggling in detail and richness). The dvd isn't bad either but you can definitely tell the difference between the two (even on a dvd player that up converts to hd I could tell between the two).",1329609600,6,1887,4.337110481586402

5020126,5,B006UP7DS6,"I'm going to just call this anime Madoka because it's title is too long. Just thought I'd clear that up real quick.

Madoka is something I personally can enjoy looking back at my childhood of Cardcaptor Sakura. It is deeply moving and is exploitative of the fact that these girls go out and do what they do, yet never actually think about the fact that they could die. It's a heavy concept that Madoka deals out quite well, it comes together and is impactful to the viewer. The problem's with Madoka lie in the ending that leaves me scratching my head. And while I know that I have commended anime for this before, that I enjoy animes with really odd endings, this one is odd in the fact everything comes together somewhat, but it's such a mish mash and so many things just happen and so many of the final scenes are so forced and unimpactful because of that force, that the anime ends with you half feeling good, half wondering what the hell just happened. Especially the after credits sequence that completely leaves me bamboozled and if anyone can explain that final forty-five seconds or so to me, please do.

Madoka shines in the story department. It's a well thought out system of magic and as the story progresses, it certainly maintains a sad tone that just gets sadder, it also exudes an air of hope. It's also an anime that seems like it will be predictable, but characters are totally different from what you'd think and you are constantly surprised. That's not to say you are always surprised, the story does have some ""duh"" moments, but overall the story works will for me. It's full of symbolism and I guess there is some inherent message it is trying to get across that I'm too lazy to mull over at the moment because it's approaching one o' clock and I'm sleepy, but it all works well up to the ending that seems to tie everything up at episode eleven. Then episode twelve comes and it's necessary, especially the first half, but after that it becomes a confusing mess. I don't want to spoil anything for those who haven't seen it, but I will say that the forced parts where Madoka meets with her friends just don't feel right and don't have the same emotional impact as when Homura spills her guts and cries on Madoka's shoulder at her house. That part was genuinely sad and made a tear come to my eye, but the rest of the ""sad"" scenes just didn't work for me.

The animation for the show is a mix of traditional and LSD inspired insanity. The traditional side looks good, but isn't anything to write home about. Characters look like loli girls and background all look good. Action is fluid. The LSD inspired action sequences when the girls battle the enemy witches are fantastic and I personally enjoyed the different styles and it was one of the best parts of the show to see what the next witch hunt would bring to the style.

Great voice actors compliment the show and bring emotion to the characters. The opening is good, though I thought it was too upbeat for something like this show. At least Elfen Lied had that terribly gothic and kind of sad opening with the bells and the lady singing in a very creepy yet soothing voice. This one has a J-pop opener that seems to be trying to make things happy. I mean, the lyrics aren't happy, but the song is too upbeat for an anime so seriously depressing. The ending is at least a bit more depressing.

Here is my biggest fault with this anime. The characters are...not the best. Not that they are bad, but most fall under traditional conventions and I couldn't attach myself to any of them besides Homura who I found to be the most fleshed out character of them all and the most likeable. Madoka is a good character, but she is kind of cliched up until the end when you see a very strong figure. The supporting cast is decent but most are just conventional-type characters who are put in a terrible situation.

(SPOILER)As I said in the story section, the relationship between Homura and Madoka is the best in the show. Madoka has her friends and they have decent relationships, but I found Homura and Madoka's friendship to be very, very touching and probably the series best point was when you find out Homura has been fighting to protect Madoka, unbeknownst to Madoka, for so long. And when Homura spills her guts to Madoka inside her house, it's a very emotional scene that does bring a tear to the eye. This relationship is great, and works well with the ending of the series.

Madoka is a good anime. It is well done, and you will feel bad and depressed for these characters while, and even after, watching it. Despite the flaws in the cast (generic characters mostly) Homura still stands out as a great character and it does have one of the most powerful scenes I've ever seen in an anime. Despite this, the anime really loses points from it's forced ending. It should have been sad, I should have really felt bad, but instead it's just a bunch of randomness that never congeals into something I can understand clearly. I know what happened in the end (minus the after credits thing), but the ending is just so hard to clearly understand. You'll get the gist of it, but you'll feel like your missing something, a lot of things, both because of the forced nature of the sad moments in the last episode, and the random scenes that just don't add to anything and confuse even more.

This is a good series. It is definitely something you should check out if you haven't already, a fantastic new take on the ""Magic Girl"" genre that is sure to please even those who have never seen a ""Magic Girl"" anime before. But be warned that while the ending does complete the series, it is also where the series starts to lose it's touch.

5020128,2,B006UP7DS6,"I was turned on to this series at an anime convention I went to. This adorable little girl here has an amazing story.
However, the price is terrible. I've never seen such robbery even for this company.
With prices like this I really don't want to see the company whining about people pirating it (which is something I would not recommend).
You might find this worth buying if you are a die-hard otaku with terribly internet service who can't stream it from Hulu (A legal site to watch different TV shows).
Personally, I don't think it's worth the price, no matter how good the anime itself is.
Just for the quality of the product (and I'm talking about the English Subbed Version) I'd give it an easy 5/5.
The English dubbed would still get a 3/5 even if the voices are laughable.
But throw in the awful price and I'd give it a 2/5.

This is not worth getting if you can stream it on Hulu.",1358121600,4,889,4.355421686746988

PROS:
-BluRay looks amazing compared to just DVD
-Artwork on box looks fantastic.
-Artwork on BluRay/DVD looks fantastic.
-Soundtrack is great! over 10 songs.
-Interviews with the creators and voice actors was fun to read and think about while watching.

CONS:
The posters are all folded up and have deadly creases in them.
The boxes aren't very sturdy, it is very thin and white, which looks great, but I think they could get stained very easily since there is no protective plastic film or anything.

OVERALL:

5020130,5,B006UP7DS6,"Giving the SERIES 5 stars.  the price is absolutely ridiculous however.

I've seen this series 18 times.  One of those times being at the movie theater when they were showing the series in movie format, which was even more incredible in terms of production and animation being kicked up a notch.

Everything about this anime is my favorite.  The soundtrack is my favorite anime soundtrack, the characters are my favorite anime characters, the art style is absolutely beautiful and certainly my favorite of any anime... this is certainly an anime I would recommend to anyone.  I've recommended it to multiple friends, only to have them all fall in love with it as I have.  I'm not going to discuss the plot or anything, because if you're already here looking at this, I'm sure you know enough about the series, plus, any explanation I give would NOT do it justice.  it's simply too incredible.  It's certainly not an anime to look at and say ""OH MAN, that's SO edgy hurrr hurr"", but it DOES have it's dark tones, which is good.  It's good that a series involving magical girls can take itself and it's audience seriously.  The series isn't afraid to kill characters, and isn't afraid to make them suffer through horrible things.  just remember, these girls are all 13 years old, so, it's gotta be pretty hard on them to be going through this stuff.  To be completely honest, the english dub of this series is actually better than the japanese dub in my honest opinion.  I know most hardcore otaku anime fans would cringe at the thought of an english dub being superior, and I am often the same way, but honestly, it's just that good, much like Haruhi Suzumiya's english dub.  in particular, Kyoko's incredible in the english dub and cusses a lot more, as opposed to her japanese counterpart.  Not to say that her Japanese voice isn't good either, it just doesn't fit her as well.  Sayaka's incredible in enlgish and has much more emotion than the japanese voice actress (again, both are great).  Mami may be the only one who I personally think sounded better in Japanese.  Madoka... to be honest, she sounds the same!  in both versions, she has the same type of voice, so honestly, I don't mind both in her case.  In Homura's case, I'm a huge fan of Cristina Vee (bite me), especially on her K-On! work, so, when I heard she did Homura, I was excited, and she sounds great!  She's very calm and collected, but when she finally breaks down, you can hear the emotional frustration in her voice which is incredible.  Japanese Homura wasn't bad at all, but personally, I think english takes the cake.

anyway, this series is my favorite anime series of all time.  The characters are cute and you can really latch onto them and understand what they're going through.  You become emotionally invested into them, which personally, I think means the character is well made and developed.  The music is beautifully composed and EVERY song is increidble (except Mami's theme in my own opinion... i just don't like hers).  The animation is absolutely stunning. my favorite anime scene of all time, due to its blend of music and art style is Sayaka's fight with the witch Elsa Maria towards the end of Episode 6.  It's such a beautiful scene and the way the characters are completely silhouetted, only outlined by their main color (madoka=pink, sayaka=blue, kyouko=red, etc), looks incredible against the all white background...

aghh, sorry.  enough of me rambling on about how great I think this series is.  Do yourself a favor and watch it.  Personally, I think it SERIOUSLY picks up after episode 3, so, at least give it til then.  Never forget the 3 episode rule!",1354752000,3,3655,4.712933753943218

However, if you know that you'll be overly obsessed with another short-haired magical girl, or you know that the price of this Limited Edition will go up by leaps and bounds in just a couple of years and you would like to make an investment(just search for Lyrical Nanoha and Cardcaptor Sakura in this website and Ebay and you'll get the picture), well, this is for you.

This Limited Edition contains the Region A Blu-ray, Region 1 DVD and first of its soundtrack, plus postcards, omake manga bla,bla,bla as explained in the product description.

The differences between DVD/Blu-ray and the fansub are already discussed elsewhere, and in the first LE box, the difference is the 'deceptive' ending song in episode one and two (the 'difference' in the final episode is the most 'enjoyable').

Plus points:
- I'm operating a video rental shop. Can I put this BD for rental?
- Very close to the Japanese release
- No trailer of other anime (is this a plus point?)

The animation style is unique and beautifully done, and the English dub is very good too. I really enjoyed this anime. It is a more mature magical girl anime than some of the other ones. I am really impressed. The only complaint I have is that this particular Blu-ray release only has 4 episodes on it. I think I would be happier if they put 8 or 9 on it.

Madoka is one of the best anime around in the last 10 years.  While it appears to be a typical magical girl anime on the designs and opener, they twisted the idea drastically as the series unfolded to tell a tale about power having a price.  The price is deadly.  The first episode will fool you into believing Madoka is just another ""Cardcaptor"" series, but in the third it takes a very dark turn and the story reveals a new aspect the world each episode.

I have the feeling this series was supposed to be a lot longer, but was probably shoehorned into lesser episodes due to budget; it shows as they cram in a lot of story and characters to a small span of time.  Overall, the art is strong, the HD version is excellent and crisp, the creativity of this small series is enchanting.  It's one of the few anime a non-anime person won't easily forget.  Madoka is wild ride for girls expecting kooky, magical ephemera.",1337126400,2,1163,4.362790697674418
5020137,1,B006UP7DS6,"Puella Magi Madoka Magica blew me away. It's stylistically impressive, the soundtrack is great, and it's a perfect example of well-crafted suspense. If you grew up with magical girl series like Sailor Moon, Cardcaptor Sakura, Tokyo Mew Mew, and Pretty Cure, this is a darker and very creative take on the genre. Even people I've introduced it to who don't really watch anime or enjoy shoujo got hooked immediately. It is an excellent series with well-rounded characters, a compelling story and a lot to say. At 12 episodes, it doesn't overstay its welcome.

I was so excited when I heard there would be an American release, but... come on, Aniplex, really? This is a twelve-episode series, and they're putting only 4 episodes on each DVD and trying to sell them at almost 50 bucks a pop! Sorry, but that's completely ridiculous-- especially when part of what I'm paying for is a nails-on-chalkboard English dub. The dub falls into the same trap that many do in the pursuit of ""authenticity""-- the VAs try to ""sound Japanese,"" speaking with unnaturally squeaky voices. It hinders their ability to act and it destroys the emotional resonance of the story. It's an infuriating trend with dubs in recent years and I blame sub purists, for demanding ""accuracy"" above all else.

If US anime distributors want to keep making money, they're going to have to try harder than this, and STOP price gouging. Japanese customers may be willing to pay the equivalent of $150 for a 12 episode series, but that doesn't fly here in the US.",1336262400,58,1521,4.823754789272031

The animation is top notch, and a LOT was fixed within the episodes, it's very beautiful to watch.
The characters can be a bit on the annoying side in the English dub, with Madoka crying at every turn after episode three, and the phrase ""for reals"" being overly used by Sayaka.
The Japanese subtitling is great, it's nearly identical to what I had watched.
I personally chose to wait until another site carried it at a cheaper price, I had gotten mine at about $39 per blu-ray.

5020139,1,B006UP7DS6,"I love this series and think it's one of the best ones out there. However, if you want to buy it, you should got to rightstuf.com to get it because this product is expensive, but it's less expensive on rightstuf. Not to mention, on amazon this product isn't even being sold directly by Aniplex on amazon, it's some third party dealer called ""animecorner"".

Anyway, if you buy the special edition releases on rightstuf, they cost $74.98 each, so you save $64.00 on every special edition box set compared to what amazon wants. Not to mention, rightstuf lists the retail price for a special edition boxset as being $94.98. In other words, if you buy from this animecorner person, you're still going to end up paying $44.00 more per box set than the retail price. (Speaking of that retail price, it's either the price you would pay for the box set in stores or just some arbitrary price they come up with to make you think that you're getting a discount. Either way, it's pretty bad that amazaon/animecorner want $44.00 more than what is considered ""retail price"".)

In addition to the special editions, rightstuf also sells non-special editions for cheaper. All of the releases are broken up into three sets like with the special edition sets. If you want the series just on DVD, the price is $29.99 per set and if you want it just on Blue-Ray the price is $39.98 per set. To summarize, if you're willing to shell out the cash for this series, buy it on rightstuf. I am not sure where this animecorner person gets his/her copies of the series, but I wouldn't be surprised if he/she buys it from rightstuf and then sells it on amazon for almost twice the price because he/she knows that dumb people will buy it. So, if you buy this set on amazon, you're being ripped off.

For the record, the one-star review is not a reflection on how good the series Madoka Magica is (because it deserves five stars) but a reflection on the price-gouging going on here. Even the prices on rightstuf are still kind of a rip-off so it's really an individual value judgement based on how much money you have as to whether or not to buy the series. I agree with another reviewer who brought up the fact that Funimation is successful at selling and marketing anime without the price-gouging. I wish that they had gotten the rights to the series because if they had I would probably already have a copy of it on DVD because even if I buy the regular DVD sets from Aniplex/rightstuf, I'll still end up shelling out $90.00 for the series.",1335830400,20,2511,4.550884955752212

5020141,5,B006UP7DS6,"Madoka rends some of the conventions of Magical Girl animes asunder, while leaving some of the structure intact.  The title character, Kaname Madoka, is presented with a tantalizing offer: the cute little creature known as Kyubei will grant her any wish, anything at all, if she will agree to accept the powers and take on the mantle of a ""magical girl.""  Early on, however, the show alludes to Goethe's Faust, which will put many viewers on their guards: who is Kyubei, and why does he want Madoka to become a magical girl?  What in fact are the full ramifications of becoming a magical girl?  And the intro itself, which opens with Madoka silently crying, is enough to let a viewer know that this show offers something a little different than your standard magical girl anime.

As I often tell friends, Madoka : Sailor Moon :: Watchmen : Superfriends.  The comparison, for the most part, is accurate: Madoka attempts to reconstruct the Magical Girl genre from a more realistic point of view (Magical Girls would not be able to have boyfriends, for instance, could easily perish in the line of duty--with gory results, no less--and will often be alone with the secrets they can never share with normal human beings) and the end product is a magical girl anime with a hard edge.  Some viewers have complained that there isn't enough comic relief to balance the drama, and that the show is ""too dark"" or ""depressing.""  But the fact is that this is an obvious choice made by the creators, and for those who like intense action, realistic drama, and a bit of heartache, Madoka will more than likely satisfy.

[SLIGHT SPOILER]  If I had to select a highlight of the series, I would have to pick the utterly show-stopping Akemi Homura. Witnessing her psychological transformation later in the series defies description--definitely my favorite episode, and one that really played the ""gritty magical girl"" concept to the hilt.

If, on the other hand, you heard some good things about this series and are trying to decide if it's worth the $70 price tag, then do yourself a favor and stop reading reviews right now.  The most important thing is that you avoid spoilers, and if you keep doing what seems like reasonable research for a purchase like this, you can end up ruining the experience.  For goodness sake don't read the Wikipedia article.

I'm like you, and I normally will read up on a series before I buy it, but I lucked into this one without doing any research at all, and I'm so glad that I did.  I'm a 42 year old male anime fan, so you might think I'm outside the demographic for this show, and so did I.  I've been collecting anime since 1988, yet I've never even finished a single episode of Sailor Moon.  I loved Tenchi Muyo, so I was able to stomach some Magical Girl Pretty Sammy, so I'm not completely unfamiliar with the Mahou Shoujo genre, but it's really not my thing.  I only watched this because Christine Cabanos, the English voice actress for the main character was going to be at a local anime convention and I wanted to be familiar with her work before meeting her.  I did absolutely no research whatsoever.  After watching the first two episodes, it was headed in exactly the direction I expected it to be going, and I wasn't too excited to hit play on episode three, but I'm so glad that I did.  The first two episodes aren't all that interesting to watch, but believe me, you will enjoy them a lot more when you re-watch them, and you will.  Once you finish episode ten and realize just what has been going on, a re-watch is practically mandatory.

I've already told you how important it is to avoid spoilers, and even revealing the nature of the show is a major spoiler, but you do need to know one thing:  Give it at least three episodes.  The end of episode three marks a major turning point in the series.  To say that the plot gets serious at that point is an understatement.  Everything changes; the story loses its frivolous nature, the art, settings and even the music change to suit the new dramatic nature of the plot, and it's at this point that you should make your judgment on whether or not to finish the series.  Don't get me wrong, this is a Mahou Shoujo anime to the end, but if you are a fan of extremely well written stories, and I mean on the level of Shakespeare, Goethe, and classical Greek legend, then this is for you, regardless of whether or not you like Magical Girls.

Lets break it down:

ART:  8/10 I've seen better animated shows.  Especially close-ups on the character's faces leave something to be desired, but still, this animation is above average.  The use of backgrounds and lighting to set the mood for the scene is done with masterful skill.  The use of a completely different art style to set the witch labyrinths apart from the real world is jarring at first, but you can't deny it IS effective.  Every image is meaningful.

STORY:  10/10 This is the real selling point of the anime.  Since I started watching anime in 1988 I have never come across a better written show, bar none.  Again, I'm not going to give anything away, so I'm just going to ask you to trust me here.  I can say that if you have heard that this is a deconstruction of the genre, then you heard right.  It asks questions that other shows in the genre don't ask, and plays out the consequences of the character's actions and choices in a fully serious and realistic manner.  However, its more than that.  It borrows heavily from the classics to give a surprisingly deep and well thought out story.  One that stands up to analysis, and if you're a writer yourself, prepare to be inspired.

MUSIC:  10/10 If you have never really paid attention to Japanese composers, this show may change that.  The music is absolutely perfect.  Where the show wants to be light and uplifting (mostly in the first two episodes) the music does that quite well.  Where the music really shines is in the dramatic scenes and the action, where the music can set the tone for a scene equally well, if not more so, than the visuals.  This music can lift your spirit or crush your soul, whichever is required for the scene.  Previously, my favorite anime composer was Yoko Kanno, but after watching this, Yuki Kajiura is now top of my list and not likely to ever be deposed.

THE DUB:  8/10 Not bad.  Some other reviewers have given Christine Cabanos a bad rap, but I don't agree.  She may be new to the voice acting scene, but she does a good job here as the main character Madoka.  The role was demanding, with a LOT of emotion, and I think she delivered that emotion believably.  Christina Valenzuela does an outstanding job as Homura.  Her character is almost the opposite of Madoka, with little emotion (at least in the first half of the series) and an intensity that doesn't really suit a middle school student, but once you have seen the full series, you will understand that this is exactly what her character called for.

OVERALL:  9/10  Now, I own the DVD and have seen the Netflix version.  I haven't seen the Blu-ray version, but I have heard that the animation was upgraded, with a lot more detail added.  If that is true, then I could see giving this a near perfect score.  Perhaps I will update this review if I ever do watch the Blu-ray.

RECOMMENDATION:  If you are looking for a light, fun piece of entertainment, then this may not be for you.  I wouldn't recommend this for younger audiences either.  It really is written for a more mature, discerning, intelligent audience, and may even be off-putting, if not inappropriate for young viewers.  Hint: Parents, don't buy this for your eight year old daughter.  Now, by inappropriate, I don't mean it has a lot of blood, gore, and sex.  In fact it has no sex, only the briefest nudity (like during transformation sequences, as is typical for Magical Girl anime), and although it does have violence, it isn't all that bloody and definitely not gory.  Still, the story deals with very serious material, and the realities of being a Magical Girl are atypical of the genre to say the least.  This is a deconstruction of the Magical Girl genre in a similar sense that Unbreakable was a deconstruction of the Super Hero genre, and Madoka Magica contains no laughs.

If, on the other hand, you grew up with Sailor Moon and would like someone to write a Magical Girl story for your now older and more refined tastes, with a story that will change the way you look at the genre, then get this.  If you just like well written stories, that don't pull any punches and make you feel like you've been on an emotional roller coaster by the end, then this is definitely for you.

Sadly, it's Aniplex, so it's expensive.  It may be available on Netflix or Hulu as other people have pointed out, but titles on those sites come and go.  I have a feeling that after experiencing this series, you will want to own it, like I did.  And if, by the time you are reading this, it isn't available from those sources anymore, then take my word for it, it's worth the price of admission.",1416614400,5,7247,4.463470319634703

Won't say no more (don't want to give away spoilers), but definitely check out Madoka Magica! I doubt you'll regret it!",1410393600,3,512,4.13
8504655,5,B006UP7DS6,Great anime which turns the genre of pretty sailor girls on its end.  Mature plot with death and violence make it not a kids story.,1406160000,,131,4.24
8504656,5,B006UP7DS6,"As a fan of all things with a dark twist, this anime has everything that I've been looking for! The animation, storyline and the characters are all original where it turns the magical girl genre on it's head. I have never watched it in English dub, and I have no desire to. Fortunately the DVD is available with the original Japanese audio with English subtitles. Most reviewers on this usually give this product a low rating simply because of the English voice actors, but if you just ignore the English audio and just watch it in the original Japanese, then it's worthy of all 5-stars. Kurobuchi-san, the creator of this anime as well as many others, has truly created a masterpiece that has redefined the magical girl genre forever.",1394409600,,735,4.705426356589148
