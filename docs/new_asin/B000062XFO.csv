Yeah right, this [stank]. DVD quality bad, special effects [stink], and the swordplay [stink]. My advise, overlook this one and get some Bridgette Lin flicks.

1686761,5,B000062XFO,"I bought this film without knowing a thing about it.  After viewing it, I was completely satisfied.
THe Assassin is a great swordplay film.  The director filmed it focusing more on art content rather than action, but it still delivered the action with finess.  I would put the style of the film along the lines of Bride with White Hair, but with more action.(The Assassinn has at least 7 cool fight scenes which all seem to have their own style)
The plot is good, and free of comedy.  The actors are well suited to their roles.  Particuarlly Max Mok, with his wild hair style as he assassinates his targets.  The background music also compliments the secens.
The English dubbed feature is quite good, if you don't like subtitles. Their is also a Vietnamese, Cantonese and Mandarin, language track if your curious about language versions. Tai Seng is getting better with its releases.
For the price, The Assassin is a great pick.  It's short, about 81 minutes, but you'll probabally want to view it more than once to take in the story, art direction, and of course the fight scenes.
My wife liked this film too which is rare.
If you're curious about The Assassin, try it out, I'm sure you'll like it.",1019347200,3,1199,4.627358490566038

7958141,4,B000062XFO,"GREAT CRIMES AND TRIALS OF THE 20TH CENTURY is simply one of the best Documentary Series ever made. Produced between 1992 and 1996, and originally broadcast on BBC2, this fascinating series examines some of the greatest criminal cases in history. Bizarre Deaths, Unsolved Murders, Serial Killers, Legendary Trials, War Criminals, Gangsters, Kidnapping Cases, and more are profiled in these fascinating episodes. Solely making use of archive footage, stills and interviews, GREAT CRIMES AND TRIALS OF THE 20TH CENTURY was produced in an era when ""true crime"" television was dominated by dramatised reconstructions, a genre that became popular in the 1980s. Everything about this series is great: the many different cases covered, the narration, the information given to us, the special ""atmosphere"" created by the music and the voice of the narrator... This is a wonderful series and I highly recommend it to anybody having an interest for True Crime, murder cases and Real life mysteries. Enjoy !

On this VHS you'll find two episodes: the assassination of John Lennon & the assassination of Robert Kennedy. Each episode is 26 minutes long.

Episode 1: Assassination of John Lennon
It was December 8th, 1980. John and Yoko were just returning to their home in The Dakota. It's a posh apartment building that looms at 1 West 72nd Street, in Manhattan. The happy couple just finished recording the song ""Walking On Thin Ice,"" for the follow up album to ""Double Fantasy."" They neared the entrance, and John turned when he heard someone call, ""Mr. Lennon!"" Mark David Chapman, 25, placed the album that he had gotten autographed earlier, on to a planter, then fired five shots from a .38, into John Lennon's back. John staggered into the building saying; ""I'm shot!"" Yoko called for help. Two police vehicles arrived in minutes, and one rushed John to Roosevelt Hospital. Mr. Lennon died in transit. Chapman made no attempt to flee. He was arrested standing next to the gun he dropped, reading a copy of ""Catcher in the Rye"".

Episode 2: Assassination of Robert Kennedy
Robert Kennedy was assassinated just after midnight at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles following a victory speech for the California Primary on June 5, 1968.  He spoke to an enthusiastic crowd and then exited the stage through a door that led to the hotel service hallway, a short cut to where the press were waiting in the nearby Colonial Room. The shooter was later identified as Sirhan Sirhan, a Palestinian born in Jerusalem who had emigrated to the United States when he was twelve. When motive for the shooting was sought, Kennedy's support for Israel in the June 1967 Six-Day War was suggested based upon an article found on Sirhan's person. Investigations revealed Sirhan Sirhan was fascinated with the occult, particularly the practice of hypnosis and mind control. Sirhan has always maintained, even under repeated attempts at intensive hypnosis, that he has no memory of the crime. In the 1990s, Sirhan proposed the theory that he had been brainwashed - suggesting he was truly a ""Manchurian Candidate"".",1351036800,,3084,5.06496062992126
