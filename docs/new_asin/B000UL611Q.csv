8213644,2,B000UL611Q,"Definately for the beginner!! I bought this thinking it would be a fun way to exercise. This was not even a workout for me. I am by no means in shape. But I am up moving all the time at work and at home. I get easily bored with your basic workout videos and was looking for something different. Not hip hop as I would think. If you are someone that is looking for something as an alternative to walking or something simple like that then this would work for you, but if you are looking for a real workout look somewhere else. I ended upgetting Billy Blanks Tae-Bo Cardio workout and THAT was a workout. I don't want to say this is a bad video because it's not, it just is made for certain people and it wasn't for me.",1248566400,3,717,4.092198581560283
8213645,1,B000UL611Q,"I am a huge fan of the Quick Fix series and own all of them.  This,however, is not worth the money. #1- You spend so much time trying to put your feet on the dots while doing the routine. #2- The routines aren't even routines.  The first segment is basically circling the dots. I'm afraid that my neighbors will see me turning in a circle irratically the way she leads, and they'll think I'm performing some weird sacrificial ritual.

Save your money and buy quick fix hip hop released a few years ago.  Also good is Quick Fix Cardio kick.",1210809600,6,539,4.36
