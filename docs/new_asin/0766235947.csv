7788520,2,0766235947,"In spite of the ""Defenders of the Faith"" title to this set, and the subject being Catholic saints, I wouldn't call these ""religious"" films. You could show it on secular TV or in a public school without raising any eyebrows. I don't agree with the other commentator that it is very good for showing at a Catholic church. The production values are high but there is not a great deal of effort at religious accuracy in the visuals, this aspect of the film is a wash in terms of communicating anything about Catholic Christianity. The commentary and narration is not very ideal either. If you have to have a movie about Saint Patrick, that's the one that is probably more worthwhile than the other two in this set.

In Joan of Arc a male narrator claims women are ""outside the social order"" and for this reason when they step into society to take action they are agents of change--what on earth kind of feminist nonsense is this (I am persuaded there is no ideology in our society more misogynistic than feminism, later in the film a Chicago university professor feminist claims women had ""no rights whatsoever"" which is just untrue--but Chicago is historically a center of these types of misrepresentations)? It has nothing to do with a Catholic perspective which sees women and men as essential in the social order. Joan isn't trying to change anything, on the contrary she just wants to save France! We are told that medieval people believed in something they called ""the Divine""... is religious faith a historical, medieval phenomenon of the distant past? One commentator in the film is a writer for the TV series ""Joan of Arcadia"". This is a showbiz production (for the Hallmark Channel apparently?) and it has some things about it that are stupid (like where ""Joan of Arc"" narrates that she had a banner with Our Lord on it that she loved, and in the dramatization it has a white-haired old man in the center... did the props guy not understand that to a Catholic Christian ""Our Lord"" means Jesus? The religious aspects which are so significant in the actual story are minimized and gotten wrong pretty much every which way). The one upside of the format is that the historicity of Joan of Arc and her story is attested to. Incredible as it is, it is completely unambiguously a matter of historical record and not a charming ""legend"". The trial scenes and even the execution scene are presided over by a bishop garbed as if for solemn high Mass, which is completely unreal, preposterous, basically offensive and presumably meant to make him seem more intimidating. There are no benevolent, sympathetic priests or nuns in the entire film. And far be it from these filmmakers to let us suspect she was devoted to Jesus Christ, sight or mention of Whom is nowhere to be found (remember even her flag in the film depicts someone other than Jesus)! Finally, when she is burning on the pyre, the tyrannical filmmakers let her cry out the name of Jesus once. They should have pointed out that even scattering her ashes is a violation of ecclesiastical law, which requires a body (or cremated remains) to be buried, both then and now. The proceedings against Joan were simply and completely against ecclesiastical law, as the film DOES state clearly in the end. A retrial examined the transcripts of the original trial and found she never said anything contrary to Catholic Christian faith, cleared her name and she is now a beloved Catholic saint.

_Patrick_ has an ideal star narrator, Liam Neeson. It also seemed to have more religious Catholics involved in it, compared with the Joan film. I thought this film was a bit better than the one on Saint Joan, I liked it pretty well till the last third when the film takes a bizarre turn by suggesting Patrick has wrongly been portrayed later as a ""standard Catholic bishop"" by mentioning anachronisms that later ""legendary"" lives and portrayals of Patrick introduced into his life story, like wearing a miter. This part was a bit confusing or even risking being deceptive. The first 2/3 of the story made it obvious Patrick was a Catholic bishop doing what saintly bishops do. It is a truly impressive story of a great missionary bishop of the 5th century. It also did not make any sense why they seemed to want to ""debunk"" the perfectly reasonable idea that Patrick used a shamrock to explain the Trinity, on the basis that this tradition is not mentioned in the earliest surviving written record. Why not just say more neutrally that this is traditionally associated with him but not mentioned in the early sources?  This section seemed to want to criticize traditional iconographic representation of Patrick, which is stupid, because portraying Patrick in a miter and holding a shamrock has a meaning and is not identical with literal portraiture. There is a particular European Saint (Willebroard?) who is always portrayed holding a church in his hand, not because this was a literal thing, but this has an iconographic significance in regard to his holy life. The way you make it obvious in a picture that Patrick is a bishop is to put a miter on him, and you visually refer to him bringing Christianity (including knowledge of the Trinity) to Ireland with the shamrock. In Shakespeare's historical plays, he dressed characters in the garb of his own time even though he knew full well that Julius Caesar wore a toga and not Elizabethan garb. Moderately educated Catholic adults may be able to easily parse the poor choices in the film, but it's less ideal for children.

The Francis film is based on the book ""Reluctant Saint"" which I did read at some time in the past, and it is not one of the best books about Francis (the book you really want to read is the one by Fr Augustine Thompson, OP, this is superior in research and historical accuracy, far superior in understanding of the religious aspects of Francis' story, and better written too). For Catholics there is a laugh out loud moment when Franciscan Father Murray Bodo comes on screen, he is a very liberal figure who has written some not very good books about Francis and spirituality. There is also theological/spirituality author Bernard McGinn. For some reason Mario Cuomo, former Governor of NY, is in it. Like I said, these are showbiz films. As with the other films, the religious aspects are kept pretty vague even though this Francis was obviously an incredibly devout and obedient Catholic profoundly devoted to the Eucharist. Maybe this is partly because the films assume the viewer has no knowledge of Catholicism and has no intention of teaching us anything? In a bizarre moment that simply misrepresents the story of Francis and his role in the Church, the decadent Church is ""in stark contrast with Francis who preached a simpler, more personal faith."" This is preposterous and contrary to the basic reality that Francis was reforming within the Catholic Church, ie powerfully calling people to holiness and Catholic fidelity, a ""sign of contradiction"" to ""the spirit of the age"", but NOT a figure ""in contrast to the Church""--there were other mystical and ascetical sects operating at the time who did see themselves that way and that were disunited from the Church, but Francis is utterly Catholic and committed to fostering Catholicity in others and you cannot miss it if you read his writings and examine his life. He was also obviously not preaching individualism, he was telling people to go to Mass, go to Eucharistic Adoration, go to Confession. But this film, like the others, does not seem to have been crafted by people knowledgeable about Catholic Christianity to be able to fully understand the Saint they are trying to tell about, Francis' ardent Eucharistic devotion is incredibly enough ABSENT from this film. One speaker claims that when Francis went to Rome to meet the Pope ""they're going to a quite different kind of church than the one they represent..."" No, this is not well said, there is only one Church. It is the Body of Christ, a visible unity with a hierarchical organizational structure. Francis was totally an advocate for ornament and richness and beauty for everything related to the Eucharist (vestments, sacred vessels etc)--which the film in contrast to the real Francis seems to want to falsely portray as decadence. This film is not ill intentioned. It hits on the basic points of his biography. But this is not a good representation of the life of Francis, and especially for Catholics this is not a satisfying, accurate or adequate presentation. Since so much has been written and so much filmed about this important Saint, surely there are better options than this.",1410220800,,8631,4.8297297297297295
