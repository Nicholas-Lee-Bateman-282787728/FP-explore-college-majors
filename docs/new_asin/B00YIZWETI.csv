7222738,3,B00YIZWETI,You've got to give them credit for great atmosphere and superb monster makeup. The movie was well shot. The script may have suffered from a plan to do multiple episodes and then settling on a feature film version. A good try.,1446854400,,225,4.512195121951219
7222739,3,B00YIZWETI,it was ok but not like the Universal,1446595200,,36,3.625
7222740,3,B00YIZWETI,"Like the recent House of the Wolfman, this black and white seeks to capture the spirit of the beloved Universal horror movies of the 30's and 40's.  The problem with both, and Tales in particular, is something those old movies had--a plot which moved the story along.  Granted, sometimes the plot did not always come out clearly--see Ghost of Frankenstein, which made Ygor's blindness as the monster a huh? moment, but the story pulled you along.  In this movie, lovingly trying to recreate that time, and those types of pictures, jumps from piece to piece without much cohesion or flow.  The insertion of some parts are an afterthought (yes, you Wolfman), and the ultimate showdown with the Count and Van Helsing is such a slam dunk by the Count that you wonder how Van Helsing lived as long as he did.  The look is fine and the effects are great for a low budget flick, but ultimately the story leaves you unsatisfied.",1440460800,3,920,4.654320987654321
7222741,4,B00YIZWETI,it was a very good movie the characters that played Dracula was good and father Thomas was a very good actor to it was a good job Stan,1435622400,2,134,3.8214285714285716
7222742,4,B00YIZWETI,"ordered this movie from Oldies.com. Has a good storyline and was great to see Frankenstein, Dracula, and the Wolfman back in action. However, the acting seems slow and unfulfilling. But on its merits, i give it 4 stars. Good for a rainy night.",1434585600,2,243,4.674418604651163

8718415,3,B00YIZWETI,"I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie.
Its not the worst horror movie Ive ever seen.
It could have been better.  Ok for its type.",1519862400,,136,4.037037037037037
8718416,5,B00YIZWETI,"A Brilliant Adaptation of the Universal Horror Film Masterpieces of the 30's, 40's, & 50's !Director JOE DeMURO does a Masterful Job with a Low Budget but a Great Script & Fabulous Actors !

WAYNE W. JOHNSON attacks his role as ""Dracula"" in a Powerful performance, with the Incredibly Lovely GRETA VOLKOVA as his Concubine ""Ilona""; & SHE's as Talented as SHE is Beautiful !

COURTNEY BENNETT will make the Feminists Proud as the Determined & Enterprising ""Dr. Victoria Frankenstein"", Grand-Daughter of the Monster- Maker Victor Frankenstein . Her Loyal Monster is Played by JOE DeMURO, & ""The Wolfman""/Creighton Reed Role is Enveloped by TOM DELILLO !

8718417,4,B00YIZWETI,"Not a Spielberg movie, but still a fun little monster trip back in time.",1473465600,,72,4.214285714285714
8718418,2,B00YIZWETI,"Filmed on a very very low budget which should have made it good, but sorry it wasn't, came quickly though",1469232000,,105,4.3
8718419,3,B00YIZWETI,"Typical low budget monster movie, hoping for more monster battles",1467072000,,65,5.6
8718420,2,B00YIZWETI,"Two stars for effort. The Wolfman and Frankenstein make up is impressive for a low budget film. ""Tales of Dracula"" suffers from pedestrian acting.  Lastly, the product is a DVD-R that freezes up in some DVD players.",1465516800,,215,4.8108108108108105
8718421,3,B00YIZWETI,was not up to par of the oldies it represented there is no dupulcating that,1451779200,,75,4.066666666666666
8718422,5,B00YIZWETI,"Was truly astounded they could match the intensity of the old masters of horror tales in the nineteen-thirties. This film is money well invested in a great masterpiece of thrills! If only Boris Karloff, Long Chaney and Bela Lagosi could sat in a cinema palace and viewed this film themselves, they would have been done proud for this g-g-g-g-r-r-r-r-eat movie! Own a copy and if my acquaintances what to see it, will tell them where they can buy it and watch it as often as they like, this is one DVD I refuse to share, its mine, all mine, you hear? Eat your hearts out! Better order now as Christmas is two days away, you definitely need to have this under the Christmas tree, folks!",1450828800,,684,4.48
8718423,3,B00YIZWETI,"First copy had a bad spot where it stuck in chapter 2.  New copy came before I had a chance to send back the first one, great service!
Should have been titled ""A Tale of Dracula,"" because the ending left you too much up in the air, abrupt, and too obvious for a sequel which would have left you ready for another tale!  The makeup was exceptional for the Monster and the Werewolf but, I'm sorry, the long-haired Dracula was too young and should have been thinner to be a real convincing vampire; especially for a black & white classic style flick.  A little more editing could have improved the film by taking out the many pause spots that didn't work during the conversations.  I'm not trying to be too critical but I love the old b&w flicks and good editing can make or break a film!  I'll be waiting to see the next tale.",1448668800,,824,4.290322580645161
