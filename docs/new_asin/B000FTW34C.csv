2587469,5,B000FTW34C,"You so can't go wrong with any of the Popular Mechanics For Kids series. They are very interesting, loaded with fun facts and experiences, and are carried out in an excellent format. The kid actors are friendly and enthusiastic and none of it comes off hokey or juvenial. I can't imagine a kid who wouldn't absolutely love watching these.",1167868800,,338,4.745762711864407

My 5 year old boy loves these programs. The first two were so enjoyed I bought the rest of the series.
This as a series on tv at one time. I hope they package the rest of the programs because the show was fab.
Each dvd has 4 episodes that are somewhat related. The 2 kid hosts explore different aspects of each subject.
Some are surprising but all are interesting and informative.",1260057600,,625,6.352941176470588
