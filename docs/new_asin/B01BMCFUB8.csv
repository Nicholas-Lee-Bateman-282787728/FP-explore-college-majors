Bought them all.",1502755200,,52,3.8181818181818183
7664247,5,B01BMCFUB8,"Very witty and well-written, as only the British can write comedies. The zingers and situations they get into are really funny and always surprising.  Not sure everything will 'translate' for Americans, but if you like rude jokes, and the woes of teens growing up, this is for you. Philip Jackson (formerly Inspector Japp of Poirot fame) is brilliant as Grampy and shows just what a talented actor he really is.  Hilarious. If you want a sarcastic take on modern life as only 'Wolves' can do it (in Wolverhampton, the Midlands of England), you will love this.",1483056000,,559,4.8125
7664248,5,B01BMCFUB8,"One of my new favorite series.  Even when I miss a word or two due to speed of dialogue and what I assume is regional or age-related slang, I still find this raucously funny and occasionally poignant.  I'm delighted and astonished that this highly varied and multi-talented ensemble can often make me care about these characters, accept their bizarre behavior and styles, ...and then the next day realize that they are utterly unrealistic.
Each actor convinces me to accept her (and his) exaggerated traits and problems, at least while I'm fully engaged with that episode.
I'm eager for a 3rd season, but I might re-watch the first two if it doesn't arrive soon -- or ever.",1482796800,,673,4.793103448275862

7664251,5,B01BMCFUB8,"Please, please Series 3. Enjoying laughing out loud at a TV show.
The girls, Della, Grampy, and the The Babbies are welcome in my house any time.
Of course, it's British, all the best shows are. I would actually buy a TV if they made shows in the U.S. as good as the British do.",1480464000,,278,4.072727272727272

7664253,5,B01BMCFUB8,"Thank God for Amazon's Acorn Add On Subscription! I loved Series 1 of Raised by Wolves and I'm Loving Series 2 as well. As soon as they become available to buy in the US I'm getting these bad boys.

Della has 6 kids of different ages and they have all kinds of crazy stuff going on. From boy love, lust, homeschooling, their crazy grampy, their tough as nails mother, ways to save money. It's just hilarious and so so good!
