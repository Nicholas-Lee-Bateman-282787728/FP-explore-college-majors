I ordered the original version Japanese only, the Set comes with a booklet and a sturdy box, this version is mostly designed for the eastern Market  check the Sub titles provided. In the Eastern Market Fan service gets whited out to meet Chinese and other Regions Morality standards. I run into this problem with other Movies and series ordered produced, subbed for China and other eastern regions. If you want to have the good version you have to wait until Funimation has the license to Sub the Movie.",1478649600,,541,4.6947368421052635
