2091040,5,B0002F6BJW,"You've read some of these reviews by now but, nobody has as of yet, mentioned the ""fracturing"" of the Erich Von Stroheim film ""The Great Gabbo"" in Episode 14. This one had me gasping for breath, it is incredibly funny!(Yes this is where Matt Groening of The Simpsons got the name for Krusty's rival in the ""Krusty Gets Kancelled"" episode.) Re-titled as ""Hymie und Me"", it is the story of WWI Colonel Erich Von Stucker getting out of the military and going into show biz with a midget known as ""Shorty Woods"". Bill Scott does his best ""Fearless Leader"" voice from Rocky and Bullwinkle"" as Von Stucker and Paul Frees does a ""Charlie McCarthy"" type voice as Shorty Woods. As with the early episodes of the show, there seems to have been more work put into matching up voices and dialogue with lip movement, a very difficult thing to do! Episode 13 has a scathing parody of Walt Disney in ""The Dalt Wizley Program"" from Wizley Land..""Folks, this is Wizleyland my Magic Dictatorship..a real favorite with the kids is the submarine ride where they can actually see floating paper cups and beer cans under water."" says Bill Scott as Wizley. According to Keith Scott's book ""The Moose That Roared""..buy it, it's cheap and loaded with Jay Ward info..the staff was under incredible time and money constraints.

If you watch all of the shows back-to-back, then it does get a little exhausting trying to absorb all of the one-liners and use of repeat footage. Remember, this show was on once a week and that's how they hoped it would be watched!

I give the shows five stars because I appreciate the hard work that goes into creating a show like this. Kudos to Bill Scott, Paul Frees, the fabulous June Foray, Hans..call me Hansel..Conried and all of the very very talented writers, editors , sfx people and other production staff.

If you like really off-beat humor..Gary Owens fans I can hear you gnarfing out there.. then you gotta get mom and dad to buy this dvd. Or at least get grandma to leave it to you in her Will..or her Larry whichever comes first. And thanks to VCI for acquiring the shows for dvd release!!",1119916800,30,2107,4.628342245989304
2091041,4,B0002F6BJW,"""Fractured Flickers"" was a noble if short-lived TV series of 1963-64 that ""fractured"" vintage silent movies with humorous voices, narration, and sound effects. Those who like their silent movies uncut and in the proper context should be warned: the irreverent scripts are often hilarious, and the show is paced so quickly that some of the jokes are just blackouts, with edits lasting just a few seconds.

Hans Conried is outstanding as the live-action host; he uses his cultured diction and dignified bearing for maximum comic effect, especially when he makes snide and self-conscious remarks about the show itself! Conried also chats on camera with guest stars, many of whom enter into the spirit of the show: Rod Serling, Edward Everett Horton, Pat Carroll, and especially Conried impersonating a beatnik for Bob Denver's benefit are memorable.

The voice-over cast consists of only three actors: Paul Frees, Bill Scott, and June Foray, all versatile and all familiar from the Rocky and Bullwinkle cartoons. Some of the offbeat voices are surprising, like Scott's impersonation of Bob Newhart; Newhart actually appears on one of the later shows to protest!

This set contains all 26 episodes of the series, which should probably be watched one or two at a time. The format does get repetitive and the hectic, bang-bang-bang pacing could possibly wear an audience out after an extended viewing. The show's treatment of dramatic footage is obviously better than its handling of comedy footage (Buster Keaton, who appears frequently, doesn't need voice-overs to be funny). But the new twists on the old films are often ingenious, and the show is definitely of interest to Bullwinkle fans and old-movie buffs. Technical quality is excellent except for episode #1, which has audio problems (no fault of the DVDs, that's how the surviving elements are).",1119225600,7,1849,5.197986577181208
2091042,5,B0002F6BJW,"I am a Jay Ward fan, and I've collected some episodes of ""Fractured Flickers"" on 16mm film at a cost of several hundred dollars. Films from this series are a serious collector's item, and they've never sold for cheap on eBay. As such, $35 for this DVD collection is an incredible bargain

And the show is an absolute scream! Hans Conried shines as the stoic, but not unflappable host. In one show, Conried sardonically compares his hosting duties on a silent film show to ""doing a show live from Forest Lawn cemetary."" The best skits include ""Dinky Dunston, Boy Cheerleader"" (Lon Chaney's Hunchback of Notre Dame is endowed with Dudley Do-Right's voice) and a terrific re-editing of Fritz Lang's ""M"" (Peter Lorre tries to give up smoking. It's topical treatment of the Big Tobacco industry was decades ahead of its time.)

If you're tired of sitcom mediocrity full of brainless idiocy, phony families, hackneyed plots and stupid pratfalls, you DESERVE this series on DVD!!! There has been no series like ""Fractured Flickers"" before or since!",1100908800,49,1041,4.942857142857143
2091043,3,B0002F6BJW,"What a treat it was to finally be able to see this favorite TV series from my childhood once again. It wasn't hard to see why a 10-year-old kid would have loved it so much, although I would have to admit that seeing it again as a 50-year-old was a somewhat different experience. Several of the segments were so good, they're still among my all-time favorite moments in TV comedy (mostly from the series' first few episodes, I noticed). But I'd have to say that a surprising number of the program's segments misfired. I think that part of the problem with the series was that it pretty quickly veered away from the premise it set for itself in its earliest episodes (i.e. wacky truncated versions of actual silent movies like Valentino's Blood and Sand, Elmo Lincoln's Tarzan, Fairbanks' The Mark of Zorro, etc.) and simply began cobbling together disparate footage, mostly from silent comedies, that would have been funnier WITHOUT the Jay Ward treatment. For this reason, I thought that those first few humorous versions of silent dramas and serious action films (see the above) worked best, while the Fractured Flickers versions of actual comedies were much less effective. I mean, why on earth ""fracture"" a classic comedy like Buster Keaton's ""Cops"" when the original version was totally unimprovable for generating laughs? On the other hand, the Fractured versions of deadly serious films like Lon Chaney's ""Hunchback of Notre Dame"" (see the hilarious ""Dinky Dunston, Boy Cheerleader""), Conrad Veidt's ""The Hands of Orlac"" and John Barrymore's ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"" worked so well because they weren't comedies to begin with. Consequently, all of those great Ward studio voices, music cues and silly sound effects resulted in some pretty big laughs at the expense of these straight dramas and action films. Why this obvious fact escaped the notice of the program's makers really mystifies me. An even bigger surprise to me than the uneven quality of the ""fractured"" film segments, though, was how many of host Hans Conreid's on camera remarks and scripted celebrity interviews fell totally flat. He and his guests often appeared visibly uncomfortable having to mouth such weak material and that made me uncomfortable for them, the very last response they were probably aiming for. Yes, this long awaited release is definitely a mixed bag, but I would still recommend it to anyone with enough patience to hunt for the series' better moments. There are more than enough to warrant a rental or purchase, especially if you've always wanted to show your friends, kids or grandkids how you happened to come by your own warped sense of humor. These three crazy DVD's will explain A LOT. I know they did for me!",1096675200,58,2711,4.960439560439561
2091044,4,B0002F6BJW,"When the premiere of this series was advertised on a TV station in my area, I immediately recognized the voices and sound effects as those of the ""Rocky and Bullwinkle"" cartoons, immediately strongly catching my attention!  Every week for the year the show was on, I tuned in on Thursdays and laughed my head off at the non-stop spoofs of 1920s silent movies!  Over the decades I never forgot this series, even buying bootlegged video cassettes from other fans.  Now for the price of this three DVD set, original fans and curious younger Bullwinkle fans can see the entire series from start to finish.

I think the series has an almost subversive, slightly sinister, Gothic quality to it. The self-deprecating jokes about the series, the scratched-up, ancient silent movies, the tiny low-budget set design, and the now-almost-forgotten interview guests make the series seem downright strange nowadays. There was nothing like it on TV at the time.  Producer Jay Ward and Bill Scott were utterly unique television producers.

The producers of this DVD set have done a fine job, minus the absence of closed captioning or on-screen captions.  The release of the first year of ""Rocky and Bullwinkle"" cartoons on DVD made me hope that Jay Ward's other fine TV shows might make it to DVD.  This DVD set is a wonderful first step.  Now we need to see ""The Nut House"", ""George of the Jungle"", ""Hoppity Hooper"", and ""Crusader Rabbit"" all on DVD!!!!",1096675200,10,1438,4.88477366255144

2091139,3,B0002F6BJW,"When I stumbled across this collection of the 1960 series produced by Mike Ward (best known perhaps for creating Rocky and Bullwinkle) it brought back memories of nights of my teenage life which I just couldn't resist re-living.

Say to say but like many things in life's past, some things remain better in our memories.

Seeing this series again after so many years, I was disappointed that the overdubbing of horse operas and numerous other B Movies of the 1930's and 40's somehow wasn't as funny as I remembered it.  Perhaps it's that my tastes in humour have changed over the years or maybe it was the novelty of this kind of zany comedy, but although I still found the series to be entertaining it isn't the side splitter I recalled.

Having said that, it still is a good trip down memory lane, and where else can you find interviews with such oddball guests as Allen Sherman (of My Son the Folk Singer fame) among others.  Come to think of it, why would you want to find them?",1430611200,3,982,4.49438202247191

The host was a popular voice actor and you can see the beginnings of the Rocky & Bullwinkle shows in the attitude, voice work, jokes and art work. Many of the people involved in the camp classic were involved in producing this series. I recommend it to anybody who loves MST3K or Rocky & Bullwinkle. You'll get it. If these camp classics leave you cold, your sense of humour may be of a different vintage or type.

2091210,4,B0002F6BJW,"I remember these as a relatively sophisticated kid. Though ""Howdy Doody"" occasionally showed snippets of silent films with non-sequitur narration, Jay Ward seems to have been the first to build a show around it. * I laughed my head off, and FF still remains pretty funny.

As others have remarked, the show was most successful when ripping apart specific films. ""Blood and Sand"" becomes an epic about an insurance salesman, while ""Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde"" is a saga of the soft-drink industry. ** Almost everything else is less-inspired and of lower quality. The inimitable Hans Conried is the ideal host, but most of the material given him is (by modern standards) overly mannered and self-aware, not showing him off to his advantage. However, his interview with Edward Everett Horton -- an R&B coworker -- is a pleasure. They know and like each other.

The worst thing -- the thing that comes close to ruining the show -- is the canned laughter. It repeatedly kills any natural laughter from (at least this) viewers' lips. One must assume that this was forced on Jay Ward, as his career shows he respected the audience's intelligence.

Nevertheless, ""Fractured Flickers"" is minor gem. Even if there's only one disk's worth of really funny stuff in the set, it's worth the asking price. Recommended.

* Ernie Kovacs hosted a half-hour show, ""Silents, Please!"" that presented edited versions of classic silent films, with narration. It was serious, though.

I love Hans Conreid, and his guests are handled with comedic flash. The dubbing of old silent films, quickly cut like a more modern MTV short-attention-span style, is excellent.

As someone else also pointed out, if you watch this series at all, do is sparingly. Watching episode after episode gets to you and makes you never want to watch it again.
Too bad. It IS an original idea. And there ARE some entertaining clips, but overall I can't suggest watching these.
Another bad thing about this set is that you never really know WHERE a particular clip is located. So if you're looking for Dinky Dunston, for instance, unless you know it's in the same episode with Annette, you would have to search every episode for it.",1334448000,,831,4.333333333333333

It is hilarious, even if sometimes the jokes and silent movie scenes do repeat and repeat, although with different narration and dialogue.  It is still hilarious to watch, and if you are in need of several good laughs, I highly recommend Fractured Flickers to fracture your funnybone.",1274486400,,418,4.805555555555555
2091245,5,B0002F6BJW,I used to try to get home from school to watch these. Hans Conried was excellent with an acerbic wit as the host of this crazy series and the guests were equally odd. It is interesting to see some of the old silent pictures- and some are even funnier with the voiceovers that I have heard in other Jay Ward programs.,1273708800,,316,4.19672131147541
2091246,4,B0002F6BJW,"One of my favorite actors was Hans Conreid.  He was a prolific performer in old time radio, with almost countless guest appearances and even recurring roles such as on My Friend Irma.  On television, he was especially memorable as Uncle Tonoose (?) on the Danny Thomas Show.  He did some nice work on I Love Lucy as well (used furniture dealer, English teacher).  He could play any character:  foriegner, snooty snob or wise guy!  He was an asset on Fractured Flickers, a wacky show worth watching for the pure entertainment value almost 50 years later.",1263859200,,553,4.768421052631579

I enjoyed the flicker about Peter Lorre trying to quit smoking (and the response of the ""Mad Men"" of that error, that should be era!) and the ""Believe It or Don't!"" routines (sendups of Ripley's work).

2091268,4,B0002F6BJW,"I remembered this show from when I was a kid, one of several early, mid-60`s lookbacks at the 20s-30s comedy.
The slapstick style was still very funny despite the very dated surroundings.
Poor quality film, Model T cars and careless editing often showed up,but basic comedic genius well executed still made you overlook the shortcomings
This show`s use of Hans Conried was a great marriage of talent to subject.
It`s easy to overlook his skill,but he had an amazingly deft touch to his humor that was a great compliment to this material.
Long before film restoration was widely regarded as valuable, this show`s use of old stock probably was responsible for savingf several of the great silent classics.
It`s worth a look for that as well as an offbeat, often zany look at film humor.",1211673600,,784,4.814814814814815

2091271,4,B0002F6BJW,"I had never seen these before. Being born in 1965, I watched Bullwinkle of course, but never saw this show. I love classic TV, weird humor, silent films, etc, and HATE almost everything on cable TV. Reality shows, remakes, predictable sitcoms, trash...not my style.

These shows are hosted by Hans Conried, whom I always think of as Wrong Way Feldman. Silent movies are shortened, then funny lines are added. Some film clips are made into fake commercials, others are voiced over with phony direction, fake documentaries, etc. We really enjoyed the first discs, but it was apparent that they didn't have enough old footage back then to use fresh everytime. Certain clips were used over several shows, ie, the plane crashing into a barn, guys balancing and dancing on top of high buildings, and Colleen Moore's famous eye spazz. We see many old time stars get fractured, but I mostly noticed Valentino, Fairbanks, Langdon, Moore, Turpin, and Keaton. (I can never get enough Buster Keaton, so that's no complaint!)

Plus the show spent a few minutes interviewing stars of the day, and you'll see Barbara Eden, Bob Denver, Zsa Zsa Gabor, Ursula Andress, Bob Newhart, and more.

If you like old movies (with the exception of those snobbish types that would consider this sacriligious), or just like oddball humor or MST3K, and love good old black and white, go for it.

Oh, by the end of the 1st DVD you'll be fast-forwarding through the theme music. it gets REALLY annoying after awhile.

What happened to Hans?",1154390400,15,1508,4.875
2091272,5,B0002F6BJW,"This show was an original idea, to take old movies and ham up the language to make them funny and wacky.  This whole show was played to the max to be hokey.  It aired in the 1960s (those of you under 45 may not want to apply) and seeing it now on DVD includes a bit of nostalgia to watch these shows again.  These shows were played for laughs, with Hans Conreid, the host, doing the most along this line to play along.  To explain the theme of this show, they took old movies and with a lot of effort created wacky dialogue to ""update"" the silents and make a plot (?) out of them on a completely different thesis than the silent movie once showed.  I have no idea how they found so many old movies to ""improve"", but it was amusing then (in the 60's, when this show aired) to watch this and it is now too.  If you like Rocky and Bullwinkle, you'll like this show from essentially the same group of, uh, artisans(?).  It's not Seinfeld-style humor, nor stand-up comic humor, instead this is a sort of very hokey, consciously self-pretentious, over-done sort of humor that makes you laugh as much at their silliness as at their puns and at their frankly funny adaptations of old movies into absurdities with the dubbed dialogue. It's an interesting combination of old silent movies and the added-on dialogue. Not for everyone, great for some of us.",1147219200,13,1345,4.421052631578948
2091273,5,B0002F6BJW,"Like others writing on this site, I fondly recall gasping for air and rolling on the floor for the original Fractured Flickers; would tell anyone who'd listen to me that it was the funniest show ever on TV; and searched for years to find it on VHS, DVD, etc -- no luck.  I even emailed Jay Ward Productions and asked about it, repeatedly, each time getting a generic ""thanks for being such a great fan"" answer, until finally one of the responses mentioned something about lawyers.  I figured that was it, until a few weeks ago I idly Googled FF and up came the complete collection collection on DVD at Amazon!  I plunked down my $$, waited breathlessly, got the package, waited for the right Fung Shui, and -- with the charged anticipation of other reviewers -- popped it in the DVD player with trembling hands.  Forty-two years after I'd last seen it.  And laughed like a maniac all over again.

2091274,5,B0002F6BJW,"This product is not for everybody. Many of the bits will not be perceived as humorous unless one possesses the necessary political or cultural history background that supports the punch-lines. Fractured Flickers will appeal to history buffs. The old films represent a wide variety of genres from dramatic to documentary. There is much detail to be gleaned from the films. The guest interviews are also most interesting and humorous. The guests are all familiar faces to anyone who lived in the 1960's or before. An interesting program could be created from these historical interviews alone. Finally there is Hans Conried and the Jay Ward production crew and their values surrounding the entire production. It seems to me that anyone who enjoys Rocky and Bullwinkle will also enjoy Fractured Flickers, but I know that some people today do have problems when viewing black-and-white.

The interview sections do seem weak, but the joy of seeing Anna Maria Alberghetti, Fabian, Bob Denver (beardless and speaking Ivy League as a foil to Conreid's beat patois), Roddy McDowell (fresh from Cleopatra! and on a family show, too!), and Ruta Lee outweighs the weakness of some of the jokes; plus, in today's in-your-face world, self-deprecating humor may seem lame but is delightfully refreshing!

2091276,4,B0002F6BJW,"I too grew up watching this show and thought it was the funniest ever.  As I recall, my parents liked it too (but they may have been humoring me - I thought for years that my dad loved cream soda, but apparently he was just pulling my leg).  When I saw the DVD set I could not resist, but I knew it might not stand the test of time.

I was pleasantly surprised to find it really quite enjoyable.  Some of the bits (notably Jekyll & Hyde recast as a story of Soda Pop and the Hunchback of Notre Dame as a football saga) were side-splittingly hilarious.  Other bits ranged from very funny to ""nice try"" but overall I found the set quite wonderful.  In addition you get highlights of loads of great old silent films that you might not otherwise see.

Mention should be made of the marvelous Hans Conreid who introduces the segments in a marveous pastiche of low-brow puns and lofty thespian articulation.  What a great guy!

Each show also features an interview with a personality of the time and although they are mostly throw-aways, it's fun to see Alan Sherman, Rod Serling and Fabian trading wit with Hans.  Edward Everett Horton even cracks up when Hans tosses off ""consanguinity"" without batting an eyelash.

The usual Jay Ward voice talent is in full flower here as well.

That said, these were not meant to be watched straight through for hours at a time and the concept begins to pall a bit if you watch too many in a row.  Take a break for some Bugs and Daffy or even Monty Python once in a while and you'll find this set charming.",1125532800,13,1538,4.373239436619718

Suddenly, I found this collection on Amazon and I was in heaven. When it arrived, I ripped it open and started to watch.  I fell asleep before I got through the first episode. I was crushed.

An absolute blast from my childhood past and something that over 50 years later ( or maybe more) wanted to see again in my dottage.

Even though it's a pleasure watching again at last, must admit that as the episodes go on, the amusement is getting low as a lot of footage is used over and over again. Of course screening it weekly would make a difference but daily?

Anyway, Hans is a pleasure to watch and I'd had completely forgotten about his guest star interviews. There are only 26 episodes are about 25mins long and feature the voices of the late great June Foray and Paul Frees.
