1620248,4,B00005KH3A,"Image's release of Celestial's remastering of this Shaw Brothers' classic should quench the thirst of those who waited for years for a decent version on DVD.  This flick makes the top-10 list of a lot of old-school critics.  In that capacity I think it's a little overrated, but if you like classic kung fu movies, it's a must-see.

It's now the 1900's and the world is changing.  The Industrial Revolution has thwarted any last attempts the world has of living in harmony with nature.  Misery loves company and China is full of potential labor and natural resources, so goons from all over the world are pestering them to join in the carnage.  The country is divided.  Groups of rebels are trying to preserve China's way of life, but meet with resistance from the preferred weapon of the westerner... the gun.  Still believing that the right amount of kung fu training will overcome the rifle, the Spiritual Sect continues to sacrifice pupils in perfecting the art of deflection.  Lei Kung (Lau Kar Leung, directing the film and the fights) tires of watching his brothers die needlessly.  Eventually realizing that these changes are inevitable, he decides to leave the sect.  Not content with letting him go peacefully, the sect's leader (Lau Kar Wing) dispatches 3 fighters (Gordon Liu, Kara Hui, and Hsiao Hou) to find him; though the only one who is aware of the other two, secretly sympathizes with Lei Kung.

This movie is very different and one of Lau Kar Leung's better directed films.  There are a lot of cool, brief, ninja-like exchanges between the major players before the captivating extended finale involving the 18 members of the film's title.  There is also a long comic sequence with Alexander Fu Sheng pretending to be Lei Kung in an attempt to draw out the old master.  Though it's an odd mix, it is well done if you're patient enough between fights.  I wasn't real big on the hypnotism kung fu, but it's brief and adds to the individual flavor of the movie.

The picture is as crisp as a new dollar-bill and will disappoint no one.  Celestial has done an amazing job on all of the Shaw Bros. flicks, but some really stand out; this is one of them.  Kara Hui don't hurt none neither.  The language tracks include the original Mandarin and an English dub.

1620249,2,B00005KH3A,the fight scenes are awsome in this movie but it could have been alot better they have some A list actors in this film for it to be dull as it is the plot sucked in a way but the best part of the film was the end the dimestration of the diffrent weapons used.....,1186444800,,263,3.8
1620250,5,B00005KH3A,"When I first saw this awesome movie on Drive-In Movie (channel 5) back in the day I liked it.  However, it didn't have those familiar Australian voices, it had these new voices on the dubbing.  Many Shaw Brother flicks that were made after 1980 had these different U.K. voices, and they sucked big time.  It actually affected the acting negatively.  Now, Image Entertainment changed all that.  It's like a whole new film.

Along with ""Master Killer"" this is one of Liu Chia-Liang's (Lau Kar-Leung) best.  This one also stars his half-brother Gordon Liu, but Liang (along with his other brother, Liu Chia-Yung a.k.a. Lau Kar-Wing) take on the lead roles.  Co-starring are Chu Tieh Wu (the villain from ""Jade Claw""), Hsiao Hou, Kara Hui Ying-Hung (both were Liang's students) and the late Fu Sheng.  Widescreen, beautiful, crisp picture.  Awesome original Chinese track (even includes the English dub), and a bunch of trailers showing the rest of the growing catalogue of Image acquisitions.

I'm not really going to go into the plot because if you're reading this, all you need to know is it's from Shaw Brothers.  It takes place during the Boxer Rebellion, and this movie even reveals the hoax of witchcraft, magic and being bullet-proof toward the end.  Absolutely amazing martial arts (choreography by the Liu brothers, Hsiao Hou & Ching Chu), especially the fifteen minute end fight, which includes everything from hand-to-hand to the 18 weapons.  It also includes the name of the weapon appearing on the screen when one of the Liu brothers use it.  Yeah, I know fu, too.  I hope this is a sign of things to come from Image Entertainment.",1174262400,6,1641,4.891304347826087
1620251,5,B00005KH3A,"This movie IS a legitimate classic.  Liu Chia Liang's skills are disgusting.  I don't know why everybody is so disappointed in this movie.  It may be lacking Gordon, but it's more of a showcase of Liu Chia Liang (who in my opinion is 10 times better, just watch his technique).  The plot may get a little thin at times, but do you really watch kung fu movies for the plot?  It's loosely based on the Boxer's (from China's Boxer Rebellion - refered to as Pugilists in the movie) and their belief in the use of magic w/ kungu.  I own over 200 kung fu movies, and I rank this in my top ten (take that for whatever it's worth).  If you're more into fast, stunt-type Jackie Chan stuff you might not like this too much.
If you did like this movie, try to find a flic called ""My Young Auntie"".  I don't think it has been rereleased on DVD or video yet, but it's every bit as good.  Take a trip to a Chinatown, a local kung fu movie spot, or E-Bay and try to find it.",1017878400,4,959,4.0855614973262036
1620252,1,B00005KH3A,(...) The very reason i had purchased this movie was because many people gave it good reviews i thought this was a Gordon Liu movie it wasn't but he was in it. Big deal! that didn't help because this movie was weak no matter what. Im thinking this movie would be more serious but there were a lot of goofy characters and they kept talking about pugilism whatever that is i don't know if its magic or what. Because this movie is dubbed that makes it seem to have nothing to do with what it is about. And what it is about (...) I do not know cause it is silly and makes no sense to me. (...),1008460800,,589,4.0
1620253,3,B00005KH3A,"The fights in this movie were pretty decent, and there were a lot of them.  I understand what the plot is about (various factions trying to eliminate a former kung fu school leader), but the translation to the screen is confusing to say the least!  I was only barely able to follow this movie.  There are too many characters and their motives/alliances are unlear.  Oh, I suppose it is all in there, but I am not sure this is a movie of the caliber of Swordsman II where it is worth it to make sense of things.
The video quality is pretty poor, and the dubbing is about average (for a kung fu movie anyway).",1005436800,,607,4.252173913043478
1620254,2,B00005KH3A,"I first read about this film in the book _Sex and Zen & A Bullet
In The Head_, which was one of the first books to take a serious
look at the Hong Kong film industry.  This is not a great or even
a good film, despite the glowing reviews both the previously
mentioned book and some film fans give it.  The plot line is
surprising thin, even for a Hong Kong film....  The whole purprose
of the film seems to be to construct a flimsy story to show off
the ""18 Legendary Weapons of China"" that the film keeps talking
about.  The great Gordon Liu makes a glorified cameo appearance
in a vain attempt to save this film.  Despite top billing, he's
only onscreen for about 5 minutes, although he does have one
fight scene.  Maybe it's just me, but I found it very difficult
to keep up with some of the characters and I often confused the
kung fu master every one is trying to kill with his brother.
Did all 18 Legendary Weapons get used?  I have no idea, but I
suppose so.  The ending could not possibly be more abrupt than
it was and the dubbing is fairly poor.  I give it 2 stars instead
of 1 only because of some decent fight scenes.  _Shaolin Master
Killer_ is a much, much better movie and Gordon Liu really is
the star of it, unlike this one.  ...I don't recommend it.",999475200,3,1266,4.1687242798353905
1620255,4,B00005KH3A,"LEGENDARY WEAPONS OF CHINA (1982, aka LEGENDARY WEAPONS OF KUNG FU, the actual onscreen title) is another kung fu masterwork from director Liu Chia Liang (aka Lau Kar Leung), best known for MASTER KILLER, DIRTY HO, and DRUNKEN MASTER II. This is an unusual variation on the genre in that it features several fights involving people in hiding and in close quarters, including a bout between two people in a crawlspace above an inn where they have been separately spying on a third.
The plot involves a search by four competing members of a secret martial arts society to locate and assassinate Lei Kung, a kung fu master who had abandoned their sect and gone into hiding. Converging on the town where the master is residing, they expect to draw him out by provoking him to show off his kung fu, but he is too clever for them. It takes a while, but two of the four become allies of Lei Kung, who eventually comes out of hiding and fights the other two, including a final battle with the sect's current head, Master Ti, involving the 18 weapons of the title. All the fights are imaginatively staged, most notably one in which Master Ti uses his hypnotic powers and a voodoo-type doll to manipulate an impersonator of Lei Kung (played by the great Alexander Fu Sheng) to fight off a bunch of attackers.
The standout cast is headed by director Liang himself, in the role of Lei Kung, while his own brother, Liu Chia Yung (aka Lau Kar Wing), plays Master Ti. The two fight each other in the final contest of legendary weapons. One of the four sect members is played by Kara Hui Ying Hung, a beautiful fighting femme employed frequently by director Liang. Gordon Liu (MASTER KILLER) plays a Shaolin monk seeking out Lei Kung and has one of the final battles with him. The cast is rounded out by Liang regular Hsiao Hou as another sect assassin who becomes an ally and a funny performance by Fu Sheng in a smaller part.
Director Liang frequently sought to infuse his films with authentic styles of kung fu; he was particularly enamored of stick and pole fighting and features some elaborate weapons in the final battle, including a three-section staff. While the available DVD of this title is not the highest quality--for one thing, it's not letter-boxed--it remains the best current way to see this expert kung fu film.",996883200,9,2313,4.630170316301703
1620256,4,B00005KH3A,"First, let me clear something up...  This isn't a Gordon Liu movie as the cover would suggest.  This is obviously a marketing ploy to sell more (it worked with me).  He is in the film, but it is really only a very small role with virtually no fighting.  After getting over the fact that I had just bought a DVD with the idea that I would be watching ""the Master Killer"" as the star I watched with a new curiosity.  This is a fantasy film and it should be taken as that.  So if you are looking for an ""on-the-ground-fighting"" realistic kung fu movie then maybe this isn't for you.  Now I'm not saying the actors and actresses aren't very skilled; they are without a doubt (the opening credits display their martial arts skills in a long, very diverse way). Realistic martial arts fans will enjoy this long opening because it is almost the only part where this type of fighting is displayed without some type of magic or supernatural skill.  The general plot runs as this... A government official is traveling around visiting different branches of a ""pugilist"" magic sect and having assassins from each sent to find and kill an ex-branch leader who defected and disappeared.  There are two main assasin characters, a male and a female.  Gordon Liu happens to play the female's uncle in the film..also looking to kill the defector.  Lui comes and goes in the film like the wind.  These assassins converge on the assigned town and begin their search.  Everyone is a suspect at first.  Eventually the male and female stars team up and search together.  When they find the defector what happens...  Do they kill him?  Is there a change of heart?  Watch and find out!!",996537600,,1661,4.591836734693878

7943400,5,B00005KH3A,"This film starts off with the ubiquitous in Hong Kong cinema at the time, the staged credit opening, with a pause on the credits and a non-descript background (usually one color). This gives you a taste for what is to come, but is not part of the storyline. You might notice that a bow is used here which later in the film is not used as one of the 18 weapons in the film (though is used during the scene with Master Mo), though it has been considered one of the weapons in older lists. The most hilarious aspect of this is how much Kara Hui seems to enjoy killing off people. My favorite part is Hsiao Ho's winning a double dao (type of sword) dual by being really, really flexible.

 Lui Gung (Lau Kar-leung) was sent to Yunnan three years previously to start another branch of the Boxer Gang. He disbanded it because of his disbelief that spiritual fighters can learn to block bullets. He is now considered a traitor to be drawn and quartered and his descendants killed so that the Empress Dowager Cixi will not hear of this (I would date the film about 1900 given these facts.) Chief Li visits Magic Fighter leader Tieh Tien (Chu Tit-wo) for him to send a fighter Tieh Hau (Hsiao Ho), who will have to be sacrificed whether he succeeds or not, to kill Lui Gung. Li visits the Earth Clan, whom have been practicing diligently on getting themselves killed by bullets*, to send their own representative which will ultimately be Ti Tan (Gordon Liu.) They are to look for anyone who has skills in the 18 weapons and has a propensity to show off their skills.

 Meanwhile Fang Shau-ching (Kara Hui) from the Heavenly Clan was also sent (or else she went on her own; still not sure about this; she says she received her orders but we never see that). I would say that Kara Hui has one of the worst male disguises I have seen except, but there are too many instances of this to count in Hong Kong cinema (like Wing Chun; countless Bridget Lin roles; The Spiritual Boxer; etc...) And just like in The Spiritual Boxer it later uses the plot device I just touched a male booby so it must be a female (I feel a little sorry for tubby guys or guys with gynecomastia.) However, Tieh Hau does not know about Victor/Victoria being on the same side as him which leads to some nice battles between the two early on. The best is the cramped attic sequence which I wish they elongated.

 Master Mo (which reminds me of the old book The Book of Master Mo by Mao Zi), a con-artist played well by Alexander Fu Sheng, in a supporting role, is paid to impersonate Lui Gung by his brother Lui Yung (whom I doubt very much would kill himself if he was successful.) However, he ends up impersonating Lui Yung when he is made a surrogate fighter when Yung takes him over via a Mao Shan doll (analogous to a scene in Dirty Ho where Kara Hui is also like a marionette.) I do love that scene and add in potty humor and it adds even more excremental goodness.

 Now who is this woodcutter named Tien Gung Yu with trembling hands and the ability to lift heavy objects? I think we all know who he is and soon all the characters do as well. But does he survive his unmasking? Is his brother on his side? Does he win over any converts? Is the last half hour an awesome amalgam of weaponry (at least 18 weapons worth with Chinese characters stating each one like it is a fighter in a wuxia film), fighting, long takes and superb martial artists? Are my questions rhetorical?

 Speaking of non-rhetorical: this movie does ask important questions that other films rarely go into. Do you ever wonder how they learn to rip off their own genitalia? How do they practice? I find it hilarious that after the self-emasculation scene you see an object fly up into the air and descend. I also wonder if ripping out your own eyes is actually fatal (analogous to biting off your own tongue in several films). I do not want to try it myself though. During the we can block bullets scene I was also wondering would not it be smarter to first attempt shots on non-lethal areas on the body. Once you pass that test than you can try fatal shots. It is funny that Hsiao Hos character gets sick from the feces infested lavatory water (eau de toilette) but I wonder if Fu Shengs character does since you no longer see him in the movie and he spends more time looking for the money in the cesspool.

 For the most part the early scenes are too short in their fighting to satisfy connoisseurs of hand-to-hand combat. I think because of one of the main bouts with Fu Sheng is technically a fake fight that it is not as interesting to some, but it is still one of my favorite staged (in the cinematic world) scenes because of how good it looked, how funny it was and of course the Chang Cheh reference with pushing the guts back in and fighting on -- Fu Sheng has had his midsection previously pierced and bandaged (Disciples of Shaolin for example). When the fights are elongated they are superlative. This is where Lau Kar-leung's direction and action choreography (along with Hsiao Ho and Lee King-chu) help tremendously. Plus the fact that he works with tremendous martial art talents, uses longer takes than most directors and often uses real weapons.

 There are a few negatives to the film are the sometimes obnoxious electronic score and the plot that could have used a little more editing especially in dealing with the relationships between Magic Fighters and Spiritual Boxers (the subtitles also add Mao Shan, but Spiritual Boxers tend to be Mao Shan correct?). However, there are additional positives to the film. The non-action choreography and editing is nice as well. One of my favorite short scenes of this type about 16 minutes in goes from a transitional cut to a full-screen fan with Chinese characters to it folding with a zoom to Lui Yung.** There are a lot of little scenes like this when you pay attention (usually after a few watches when you are not concentrating on the action or humor.) Lau is underappreciated as an auteur. Lau has another film that deals with some of his favorite topics like authenticity and identity. Obviously in his approach to martial arts mentioned above. But also look at how many films of his deal with impersonators, doppelgangers (both real and supernatural), woman as men, westernization, peons as masters and masters as peons. This film has all of those so much that I noticed it has confused several reviewers. Of course it does not help that Lau Kar-wing does look like his brother Lau Kar-leung.

 I am going to go with the critical consensus on this and state this is one of the better 1980s Hong Kong films regardless of studio. I have had a lot of fun with the plot, I think the action is quite good (though not enough of it) and the ending(s) is superb. I love seeing so many weapons used so well. I could have even watched Lau Kar-leung practice with all of them and elongate this film. I have rewatched this several times and should rewatch it again in the future.

 I have the R1 Image release and it has English subtitles (no dubtitles). It comes with the Mandarin mono and Mandarin 5.1 dub only. This really should have had the Cantonese language dubbing which is the preferred dub of this film. The IVL R3 release has that dub. The bonus material is rather light. You have Shaw Brothers Trailers (11 of the Image/Celestial releases) and Other Titles You Might Like (13 and some of them like Shaolin Family Soccer you might not like.) The print is rather good, especially compared to a lot of other Image releases which suffer from ghosting. This looks to me to be progressive as well. I believe the IVL release is a few minutes shorter because of a crummy PAL-to-NTSC conversion. The Image release, for me, came with two inserts: Asian Cinema Catalog No. 1 and a postcard you filled out to receive advance notice of future releases.

 * In Lau's first released film The Spiritual Boxer he has a similar scene to start the film with.

 ** David Bordwell has a nice write-up in Planet Hong Kong (2nd Edition; pg. 144-145) on how a non-action choreographed scene uses a pause/burst/pause pattern prevalent in Hong Kong cinema.",1492128000,,8136,4.512907608695652

It takes a real Kung Fu movie snob to hate this film. Not quite family friendly being that some people die quite graphically
in the beginning, but I suppose you could use it as a tool to show kids guns are dangerous not toys.
