916273,5,6304672969,"I originally bought this video with the actual step, but misplaced the video.  This first-in-a series of Step Reebok videos really encourages the beginner. It has a review of all the steps performed at the end of the  video and is extremely easy to follow. Intermediate and advanced steppers  will enjoy the power required.  I like this video mostly because of the  excellent warm-up and cool-down, and the repetiveness - I don't need to  constantly keep my eyes glued to the set. Some of the later videos have a  ""count-down to finish"" clock, which this one lacks. I even got my  husband to do the video with me and he admitted it was a great workout!",916099200,3,652,4.560344827586207

7876375,5,6304672969,"I bought this tape last year when I was new to step, loved it and I'm sad that I can't find it on DVD at a good price. This video includes a mini-tutorial at the end of the tape that shows the moves which are included on the workout. My VCR/DVD player stopped working and replacing that was way more expensive than buying a new DVD player. Anyhow, if you remember how cool it was to workout in these clothes, the ""modern stage"" and the music, then this dvd is awesome!! Watch the trailer on collagevideo.com. Gin Miller's cueing is great. The workout is very intense but the moves are not tricky, and the choreography is athletic, not dancey like the new dvd's out there!! Perfect for begginers, intermediates and advanced step people who want to feel the cardio burn wthout dancing!! It's also a great complimentary video to Step Reebok: Power Step, also by Gin Miller.",1242259200,,870,4.547770700636943
7876376,5,6304672969,I love this tape.  The instructor talks when necessary but she's not over talkative and she gives direction at the perfect times so that you can follow along easily.  I use the tape every day and still am not bored with it. You will definitely work up a sweat.  Results were visibly noticed within 3 weeks of daily workouts.,1100044800,,324,4.4576271186440675
7876377,5,6304672969,"With limited time to go to the gym, I've been trying out ways to work out at home and finally purchased the Reebok step system, which came with this video.  It definitely possesses a different feel that most workout videos.  I really like the lit platform and the cool strong moves performed by the muscular participants.  I love the rhythmic percussions - they seem to mirror the pounding of my heart as Gin Miller gradually works me up to a sweat.  To make the upper body segment more challenging, I hold 2 lb dumbbells.  I've been doing step for many years and would've liked to see more complicated routines, but that's just me - I get easily bored.  Gin also cues very well - which is a must for step aerobics.  I've done this video several times and still enjoy it, and I always get a great workout by modifying the steps & adding power moves.  Overall, a very nicely made video.",1083456000,,885,4.419753086419753
7876378,5,6304672969,"I have had this for a long time, through several fitness fits.  It doesn't matter if you can only do the first 10 minutes or you go through the whole thing, it's a great tape!  I agree with other reviewers of this and other exercise videos--having a perky, chatty, oh-so-cute person leading the exercises is ok and even amusing the first or maybe second run-through.  After that, I want to hit them over the head with the step.  Gin Miller is perfect. It's a just-do-it, you don't have to smile, workout.  And I actually like the background as a nice break from the pastel set-looking appearance of the others.  It adds to the ""we're not cute little pixies here"" feel of the thing.",1067126400,2,681,4.495934959349594
7876379,5,6304672969,"I love this video.  It combines a nice beat with simple but effective moves.  I hate when an instructor changes to a new move after only doing two moves in a row.  I like that this trainer doesn't do that.  In fact, she really prepares you for each move without yelling.  It is also nice to have the effect of a live band playing the music.  My husband likes this video too.  He has no dance talent and this video caters to his ""manly man"" exercise philosophy.",975974400,9,460,4.218390804597701
7876380,5,6304672969,"If you're tired of cheery non-sweating women smiling and cheering you on through your workout, this is the video for you. Very direct. And none of that ""I know you can do it!"" stuff. The drummers and the unusual  music are right out of a music video. It's my favorite step tape and I've  got many!",948153600,6,297,4.285714285714286
7876381,4,6304672969,"As a heart patient,I found this video was exactly what I needed to speed up my aerobics. The commands are good and so are the movements.  However,the drums would give a person prone to migraines a fabulous  headache.  I can do without the drums and the fancy camera moves that seem  to move at a crucial time and I did not care to see the drummers, let alone  hear them.  I would like to see an exercise video where the camera focused  on a few people and did not block the view at times as this one does. Gin  Miller is really great.",940896000,4,534,4.116504854368932
