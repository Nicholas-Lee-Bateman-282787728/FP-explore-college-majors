3711763,5,B001N6FPQY,"First, let me just say that I know some people are arguing about whether it's best to buy the entire series, or individual seasons.  (Being an anime fan, I've heard similar arguments.  I'm amongst those who don't want to have to sit and wait months, or years, for the next edition.  Since it seems that it will be released both ways, both group of fans should be happy).  Secondly, I am also extremely happy that it IS BEING RELEASED BY SEASONS, and at an affordable price.  Why?  Because I didn't know that this series was even available until a friend gave this to me for my birthday!!!  (And I doubt they would have bought it if it were only available as an entire series).  I LOVE this series!!!  However, I love the original cast (before things got weird and some of the original vocal artist were replaced).  I am a huge Lorenzo Music fan.  (Have been since the animation 'Twice Upon a Time', and used to listen to him as 'Garfield' all the time).  So, when the cast changed, it was a bit jarring for me.  I continued to watch, but not with the same enthusiasm as before.  I miss this series, and hope that the other seasons are released soon for the sake of all those waiting for it!  (Can't wait for the season with ""Drool the Dog Faced Goblin""--one of my favorites!!!)  Soon, let it be soon!!!",1238803200,,1302,4.384937238493724
3711764,5,B001N6FPQY,"I got this dvd set for my birthday. Its got alot of my favorite episodes in it. Time life did an amazing job with this set the title menus are great,The commentary is funny and the documentary is very interesting. Im very happy with it. I might buy the box set someday but Im broke right now. If your tight on cash like myself this is the best volume dvd set to start with.",1238630400,,373,4.054054054054054
3711765,4,B001N6FPQY,"The Real Ghostbusters was a difinitive series in that it was a major predacesor to the first TMNT animated series and was considerably dark for a Saturday morning children's cartoon. Some of the Ghostbusters' ememies were borrowed from popular mythology,(ie the above mentioned Boogeyman, Sandman and Samhain, the spirit of Halloween, and even the four horsemen of the apocolyps), and some of the ghosts were down right scarey. I agree with my fellow reviewers, this is a great set for those who are tight on cash but would like to enjoy some good ol' 1908's style ecto plasmic skull bustin' as Ray might say. Power up your Proton Pack, dust off your PKE Meter and get ready for ghost busting nostalgia at it's best.",1236729600,12,716,4.782258064516129
3711766,5,B001N6FPQY,"It's about time they released this show the way they did. I've always been a fan, since the first few episodes aired on network television. I will be purchasing the complete series available at the Time Warner website. Thanks a and smurfwreck, for the heads up. Don't get me wrong, the way times are right now, it is nice to see that Amazon is providing the show seasonaly at a resonable price. I'm just impatient, plus the complete box set looks bananas! The animation was pretty sweet for it's time. I'm going to have a lot of fun getting my niece and nephews to get freaked out by the excellent stories. A must for any DVD animation library!",1236643200,3,644,4.466101694915254
3711767,5,B001N6FPQY,"I bought the complete series from Time-Life, which includes this first volume in the exact same quality Steel Book packaging.  The show has been beautifully treated -- cleaned up and enhanced with occasional visual commentary tracks, brief episode introductions, and other special features.

Arguably, this first set marks the absolute best of the entire series.  I am inclined to agree, though I am a completist at heart and wanted to enjoy the entire series, bonus DVD, and cool packaging that was offered from Time-Life.  If you are a fan of the show, I would really recommend going that route, particularly when you can make a series of smaller payments instead of one lump sum.

For the most part, the show itself has withstood the test of time.  It's not quite as wonderful and creepy as it was twenty-plus years ago when I devoured it as a child, but it's fun to watch and I look forward to sharing these quality shows when my daughter when she gets a bit older.",1230854400,2,969,4.670588235294118
3711768,5,B001N6FPQY,"This is a great set for the fans of Real Ghostbusters. I don't know if they'll repackage this set but it comes with a steelbook, which is a nice touch. There are a few problems with the set

The show sometimes goes light and dark. Not alot of episodes have this problem but there is a few I noticed. Also, the episodes look good but its not the best quality. Looks like they put them on dvd and didn't bother remastering it.

The pictures on the dvd are the same for all sets.

I say buy this set if your a fan but you'll have to wait for the rest of the volumes to come out. Then when its all released, will they release it as a whole box set? I say either buy it as a full box set now for a few extra dollars or wait if your nota huge fan. I had a choice- save money or buy this set for two hundred dollars. I grew up on this show; My parents taped this show for me and I watched it until this set came out. I go with buy it now. Plus, you won't get the bonus dvd that came with the complete set and it also came with a nice booklet with every epsiode. You choose.",1230595200,2,1066,3.81447963800905
3711769,5,B001N6FPQY,"Finally. After some meager single disc releases and a two-episode tease on the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ghostbusters-Double-Feature-Gift-Set-Ghostbusters-Ghostbusters-2-and-Commerative-Book/dp/B0009RCPY8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ghostbusters Double Feature Gift Set (Ghostbusters/ Ghostbusters 2 and Commerative Book)</a>, The Real Ghostbusters finally makes a proper arrival on DVD, and does so in style. This isn't some hack release thrown together for a quick buck - Time Life and Sony really went all out to give RGB the proper treatment, including Steelbook packaging, visual commentaries, interviews with the key talents, and more.

As mentioned by other reviewers, you can already grab the complete series set from the Time Life website, which has all 5 volumes, an exclusive Firehouse box and bonus disc. But if you're low on cash or only want a little RGB to satisfy that nostalgia craving, Volume 1 arguably gives you the most bang for your buck out of all the volumes. This set packs 30 episodes, the first 13 of which are the classic ABC season 1 shows, including memorable ghosts the Boogieman, Samhain, and Sandman. The Ghostbusters go Hollywood, Janine gets a genie, and Peter tells the story of how Slimer came to live in the firehouse. The other 17 episodes start the Season 1 syndicated package, including the episode ""Knock Knock."" The animation is at its strongest, Lorenzo Music and Arsenio Hall are on the cast, and the writing is at its best.

Individual volumes or complete series set, The Real Ghostbusters is a must buy on DVD. The show holds up much better than most 80s fare, and is great for original and new fans alike.",1229126400,60,1701,5.538461538461538
3711770,4,B001N6FPQY,"For those who don't know, Time Life picked up the rights to release the entire Real Ghostbusters series (including the Slimer & the Real Ghostbusters episodes), and are offering a complete series set available only on their website (with an MSRP of around $175-180.)  Luckily for fans that don't want to drop 2 bills on the complete series, or for those who just want a single season of the show, they've decided to also release (at least) the first season as a separate set available at most retailers including Amazon.  This is the perfect option for those who weren't happy with Sony's Best of discs, and are ready to mortgage their home for the complete series.  Here's to hoping they release the other seasons separately as well.

As for the show, it's an interesting entry in the genre of 80s film cartoon spin-offs, with well written episodes and generally interesting animation.  Though the show is visually a little different from the films, it's a great expansion of the characters and world.  This 5-disc set contains the first 30 episodes, 5 commentaries, a collectible booklet, and a very nice steel case package.",1228867200,25,1126,4.869109947643979
3711771,1,B001N6FPQY,"Do not buy this product. It is not worth the money. While you continue to wait for the future 4 volumes to be release, you could be enjoying watching the whole series.  For $180 plus S&H, you can from Time Life's website you can get the complete collection including a bonus disc and booklet(containing series info and episode synopsis) And that bonus disk include a never before seen pilot video, alternate beginnings and endings, and more.  This whole collection is contained in a firehouse shaped box, which by the way will fit on your DVD shelf.

Anyone who is looking to buy the Real Ghostbusters on DVD must be a big Ghostbuster fan and you will be more satisfied with the complete collection. It is well worth the 2 bill you will have drop, so don't give the single volume release any thought of purchase

Buying it in store at $40 dollar a pop plus tax will cost more then buying the complete collection at $180 plus S&H",1228867200,6,928,4.505952380952381

3711773,3,B001N6FPQY,"Well 12 out of 13 episodes isn't bad I suppose?

Yes I'm afraid much like Volume 2 has the episode 'Adventures of Slime and Space' missing from it, this release also has a missing episode. This time it's Slimer Come Home. :(

The episode however is present on the Digital Download version of this volume and on the UK/Australian Season 1 DVD sets. So it's really strange why Sony would keep skipping episodes like this?

The other 12 episodes from ABC's first season though are on this disc however, still it's a shame that Sony couldn't have treated their product with a bit more respect then this.",1481500800,,599,4.579439252336448
3711774,5,B001N6FPQY,"YAAAAAS!!!!! My kids are obsessed with the new 2016 ghostbusters movie. My 4 year old insists she's a ghostbusters. She's been watching the movie over and over again, but then my husband and I remembered this show from our childhood!! What a trip. I was overwhelmed, in a good way, with nostalgia. My littles love watching this. And I love having it on in the background. They think it's super funny that the real ghostbusters have slimer as a pet. I was a little bummed by the $10 price tag for the whole season, but that's less than $1 per episode, as there are 12 episodes. I don't know if we'll order the 2nd season, but we're pretty stoked with this one!",1479859200,,659,4.409836065573771

3711776,1,B001N6FPQY,"My grandson watched the latest ghostbuster movie and so wanted to see the tv series. It was a mistake. There is truly ugly stereotyping in the show that is, in my view, biased and racist. I will not watch any more of these shows and had a discussion with my grandson about the ugliness of racism and stereotyping based on nationality, race and other factors in terms of how one refers to a group or how a character is portrayed through looks, speech patterns etc.",1474675200,2,463,4.458823529411765

3711782,5,B001N6FPQY,"My kids love the Ghostbusters so I bought this for them, mostly for them but a little for me because I love the Ghostbusters also. Every single episode in this season is great and entertains my kids. They love watching their favorite characters and even act out some of the parts. They want to be Ghostbusters when they grow up so they can be like their favorite characters from the movie and this show.

 The Real Ghostbusters season 1 is perfect for any Ghostbuster lover and would make a great gift. It's great for kids as well as adults and it brought back lots of childhood memories for me since the movie came out the same year as I was born. Each character is lovable in this series and although I do love the brand new Ghostbuster movie (with the females) nothing will beat the original. The Real Ghostbusters series has all of the original Ghostbusters, including the beloved Harold Ramis (Egon) so it's perfect for those that love the nostalgia from the original movie.",1470700800,,979,4.588571428571429

3711809,5,B001N6FPQY,For halloween we bought Ghostbusters 1 and 2 so we could introduce our kids to some fun movies from our youth. They had a blast watching them so that made me wonder if they would enjoy the old Ghostbusters cartoons....spoiler alert: they did!  They had a couple of questions about the differences in the characters but they had fun watching. The tin case that the discs come in is pretty awesome.

3711852,5,B001N6FPQY,"This show came out around the same time that Filmation came out with their 'Ghostbusters' in which I watched both shows. Filmation's show I felt was more kiddie-kiddie, as opposed to ""The REAL Ghostbusters"" that had a sort of element of darkness, even though it was a Saturday morning kids' show that also appealed to adults. I remember back then my Dad would sometimes watch it with my Sister and me. I love reliving my childhood by watching all these DVDs that I've collected through the last few years. It's just absolutely awesome! I recommend this for the ultimate Ghostbuster fan. If you have children, let them check it out while you experience some nostalgia.",1387843200,,667,4.808695652173913

3711859,5,B001N6FPQY,"Loved the early '90s when this show was on. I looked forward to it every day. Any fan of Ghostbusters needs this to breathe. The animation looks great on a Blu-ray player, even though it is a DVD. My son got hooked when I first showed him an episode on youtube, and from that point on I knew what to get him for his birthday. Don't be surprised if you feel like a kid again and don't think your kids won't like 'The Real Ghostbusters.' The cheesy jokes are still funny.",1374710400,,469,4.164835164835165
3711860,5,B001N6FPQY,"I'd been watching some of these episodes on YouTube and finally bought the first season set.  The set comes in a cute tin that fits on the shelf with other shows (I was afraid it would be too tall).  The DVDs seem to be in there securely.

If you've never watched this show with your kids, do it now!  Nightmares, monsters under the bed, creatures from the darkness - all of these and more come to haunt New York City, but the Ghostbusters always save the day.  The show might be made for kids, but the adventures and the often trippy animation give adults plenty to enjoy.",1363305600,,573,4.317757009345795

3711862,5,B001N6FPQY,"What's not to like about this....? We're talking about The Real Ghostbusters. A cartoon from the 1980's, which is a animation adaptation of a box office movie hit! For those that are not familiar with Ghostbusters or know little about it. The Ghostbusters are the 4 main characters, each w/ their own entertaining personalities. Winston,Peter,Ray & Egon. They run around creating larger than life adventures, hunting down and containing variours forms of the paranormal! Along with the 4-man team. They have a receptionist (Janine) which is always trying to get close w/ Egon. And also they have a pet ghost (oddly enough) named Slimmer! In this animated set. You'll see the Ghostbusters provide action,comedy,creativity, and fun. This DVD set has some great episodes like; ""When Halloween Was Forever"", ""The Boogieman Commeth"", ""Mr. Sandman, Dream Me A Dream"", ""Look Homeward, Ray"", ""Ghosts R' Us"", ""Xmas Marks The Spot"", and others. It has 5 discs. Disc 5 has 3 episodes and then bonus features. Volume 1 has a great tin case. The case has great artwork, front to back! Inside, the case has clear plastic that holds the DVD's. A part of it is hinged. And can be turned back and fourth like a page in a book. Behind thw clear plastic is more artwork (in black & white). It also comes along with a booklet which lists everything. Growing up as a kid in the 80's this was one of my favorite cartoons (and movies). The animated series holds up great to this day! My 9yr old son loves the Ghostbusters cartoon,movies, and even toys. I hate to sound like a old man bickering....But this cartoon (as well as many others from the 80's-early 90's) is much better than what you see on TV today. The sound and picture is obviously somewhat dated. Being that the episodes are over 25yrs old. None the less, they are overall solid. I personally watch them mostly on my  Blu-ray player and LCD bigscreen. And it comes out visually adequate. Same goes for the sound...Overall adequate. Or if you have a older TV & DVD player. It'll look and sound just as you remember it in the 80's too! I'd highly recommend this Ghostbusters set to anyone that grew up in the 80's,90's, and up to current days. Especially to those that enjoy old school cartoons & Ghostbusters in general.",1357776000,,2260,4.7215189873417724
3711863,4,B001N6FPQY,"One day while in a grocery store, I seen this collection on sale for a fraction of the normal price. Having been a kid when the series debuted more than 25 years ago, I had to get this. I remember either waiting for Saturday morning to watch this on ABC or watching the syndicated episodes after school.

& now I have this collection. You'll be getting the 1st 30 episodes (13 from the 1986 ABC season, the rest taken from the 1987 syndication package) spread over 5 discs in a steel DVD case. Watching the episodes again brings back some fond memories. One of my favorite episodes which made it to this set is ""Crime Busted"" in which the Ghostbusters go from ghost busting to crime fighting. The episodes are digitally remastered-they're great to look at on screen. My nephew & nieces,  who seen the 2 Ghostbuster movies also enjoy watching the cartoons in this collection as well.

While I wish the collection had Ccs (closed captioning), I'm a bit disappointed with the special features. They include intros (from people who worked on the show), visual commentaries (in which the people in them don't talk at all about the episode they appears in), a disappointing 30 minute doc on the series, some artwork from the show & episodic scripts & storyboards in PDF format (of which you'll need a computer to access it.) The latter of these I found to be the most interesting, seeing actual scripts & storyboards to some the episodes in this set.

Since this release, TimeLife has released the entire series in one collection. That would be for the ultimate Ghostbuster fan. For those who remembered or loved the show but not enough to put down more than $160 for the whole series this is the way to go. FOUR STARS",1356739200,,1712,4.60327868852459
3711864,5,B001N6FPQY,"Bought this because I remember watching it as a kid. Now that I have kids of my own I figured I'd see if they'd like it since they love the movies so much.

3711865,5,B001N6FPQY,My step-daugher absolutely loves these.  She wants to watch them for 2 hours straight when we take long trips.  It's nice to see the younger generation getting excited about cartoons that I once loved.,1353369600,,201,4.882352941176471
3711866,5,B001N6FPQY,"I couldn't afford the pricey complete series, so I waited until Volume 1 was released. I grew up watching the cartoon and the episodes are still great to watch today. I love the tin case that contains the five discs and episode guide booklet.

3711869,5,B001N6FPQY,"What can I say about this product that hasn't been praised about already (and, furthermore, where to start)? At about $25 after tax and shipping, you're getting 30 episodes (and the best ones of the entire series, in my opinion, might I add) from this awesome cartoon that left such an indelible impression on all of us when we were younger. That pricing adds up to less than a dollar per episode that you will own forever. They're preserved just how you remember them. The sound and DVD menus are great quality. Additionally, there are special features for virtually every single episode on each disc in addition to an extra DVD solely full of special features as well. This tin comes with a booklet that contains summaries and facts/tidbits about every episode. The packaging is way cool and you're really getting a gem-of-a-product here. Seriously, heed all of the other reviews of this product and go pick up this awesome little collection! Did I mention that this is an awesome product??",1308614400,2,992,4.807017543859649
3711870,4,B001N6FPQY,"Well, I wasn't exactly the biggest Ghostbusters fan. I saw the 2 movies, but they didn't stick with me.

But that said, I really enjoyed the 1st season of the cartoon. And I think if you're stuck in the 80s or just want a now and then 80s night, this is essential. (Along with of course ""Duck Tales,"" ""Galaxy High,"" some 80s heavy metal, and the MOST IMPORTANT element: (""The Goonies."")

Well, moving on to the subject at hand, our 4 heores (5 including Slimer), go around busting ghosts and protecting NYC and some other places. But while the ghosts are certainly part of this, it's not just the ghosts that make this a classic.

What really makes this a classic is the unforgettable hilarious interaction between the over enthusiastic Ray, the superstitious but also hilarious Winston, the computer brained Egon, and the street wise Peter who holds them all together.

(On a side note, I think the end of this show was sealed when Arsenio Hall and Lorenzo Music gave up their positions.)

Moving on, we can easily see that there is an adventure in that somewhere a ghost has to be 'busted.' But it's almost like a 4 man (+ 1 sliming ghost) comedy act with a climax.

While the show is usually very funny, some episodes have a surprisingly disturbing climax. (2 good examples are ""Ghosts R Us"" and ""Mrs. Roger's Neighborhood."")

It's probably wrong to end this review without paying a moment of attention to Janine. (The sassy secretary.) She is really sassy. But we are allowed some sympathy for her in that she is so often trying to win the attention of Egon. (A nearly impossible task being that Egon is very much in love with knowledge, facts, and figures.) But in one episode she gets her chance. (""Janine's Genie."")

A previous reviewer put it well when he said that this gives you a lot of 'bang for your dollar if you are after some 80s nostalgia.'

A lot of good episodes. But I would say 'Killerwatt' is a strong contender for the best episdoe.",1302480000,,1955,4.562857142857143
3711871,5,B001N6FPQY,Just as I remembered it each episode on this set. It was short lived on broadcast tv but this brings back memories. I have enjoyed it alot.,1302048000,,139,4.185185185185185
3711872,5,B001N6FPQY,"I bought this DVD set for my 4 year old, who loves to watch ""scary"" movies....whatever that might be to a 4 year old anyway, lol.  She loves the movie Ghostbusters, but some of it was just a little too scary for her, so I thought this would be perfect for her!  She loves it, and I have to admit, I love it too!  I remember watching this when it origionally aired, and it's just as enjoyable as an adult!
I love the metal case!  I read some of the other reviews before I ordered this, and most of them were positive.  I don't know, or care really, about the quality of the digital remastering, or any of the technical stuff, so I don't really have a comment for it.  I DO know that it's just as I remembered, and it has been fun reliving some of the good ole days and being able to share them with my child.  Definitely worth every penny, and MUCH cheaper than if you were to purchase the entire set from another site (upwards of $170.00)  It's 30 episodes of fun!  I hope this was helpful.

3711878,5,B001N6FPQY,"Now I love this set.  Tremendous packaging, and great overall productions values.  I only have 1 question.  Why in the episode ""Knock, Knock"" did they change the music in the scene where the Ghostbusters are fighting the ghosts while riding the subway car.  Instead of the orignal music they overlayed the stock track of the theme song.  The only reason I noticed the change is because I still have the original video tape of the episode and have watched it a few times over the years so I know the whole episode almost by heart.  The only reason that I can come up with is the fact that the same song they played during the subway car scene was heard previously in the Boogieman episode.  Other than that I can think of any reason for the change.  Anyone have any ideas???",1253145600,,773,4.432624113475177
3711879,5,B001N6FPQY,"Yeah, so, I love the ghostbusters. I was hooked as a kid, and now, after letting my kid peep a few episodes, he's completely hooked too. It's insane. I didn't think he'd get so Ghostbusters crazy (he's only 4) but he's in deep, man! He knows all the lingo (like, what the P.K.E meter is, what the containment unit is, he knows that the Ecto 2 is the helicopter thing etc.) He's got all the names down too! I'm really sorry that I don't have all the old toys anymore to give him, I had a TON! And they're all gone now. The kid proceeded to make his own proton pack out of a backpack and a wiffle ball bat! So cool.

I had really wanted to get the five volume firehouse set, but in no way could afford to drop that much cash at once (plus I have no credit card to order it from Time Life,,, I'm sort of a scumbag in real life, don't tell nobody...)  SO these one shot volumes are key. It is a total pleasure to watch these with my kid. Theres thirty shows on volume one. The ABC first season was on Demand for a while, so we had already watched those episodes a hundred times each before we got this,,,basically that whole season was perfect, except for maybe the Christmas episode that I never cared for... but the syndicated episodes on here are just as good. Theres some legitimate classics on here! I love the New Jersey Parrallelogram episode, with Peter Venkmans father! Or the one with the ragtime band in New Orleans! So good!

I really really hope they don't cheese out on releasing the next volumes. I gotta have all five, and I can only get them one at a time. We still can watch this set over and over (he can and WILL, this thing plays non stop!!!) but I'm definately ready for some new ones too... This thing rocks though. Ghostbusters are the best! Bring on Volume 2.",1248307200,,1780,4.229411764705882

3711883,5,B001N6FPQY,"Set a year after the Ghostbusters fought Gozer, the awesome four known as Peter Venkmen (Voiced by Lorenzo Music), Ray Stanz (Voiced by Frank Welker), Winston Zeddimore (Voiced by Arsino Hall) and Egon Spengler (Voiced by Maurice LaMaurre) now joined with friendly ghost Slimer (Voiced by Frank Welker) and with secretary Janine (voiced by Laura Summer) to fight the many forces of evil in the world.

A truly brilliant animated spin-off of the classic 1984 hit movie that suprised everyone around the world. In 1985 Columbia teamed up with DiC to do an animated series based on the movie as it premiered in 1986 to great ratings and acclaim from kids to adults thanks to the brilliant smart writing, excellent characterizations, humor and of course quality animation. It lasted from 1986 to 1992 as it became the true best cartoon of the 80's besides ""Transformers"" and ""G.I. Joe"", DIC's truest great cartoon show besides ""Inspector Gadget"" and ""Sonic The Hedgehog"" for it holds up very well thanks to Youtube viewing.

3711884,5,B001N6FPQY,I absolutly love this cartoon. It really brought back a lot of great memories about waking up early on saturdays so I could see what situations these guys got themselves out of. I loved the movies and this cartoon is a wonderful extension of them. I just wish that there were more episodes available.,1242086400,,300,4.574074074074074
3711885,4,B001N6FPQY,"I always wanted the full seasons released and it's about time. I like how it's 30 episodes of the first season and just not half of the first season like what's being done with the Smurfs. I just hope it doesn't take as long as it is for more Gummi Bears since I'm hooked to the show once again and need more now! lol. It's sometimes corny and some of Peter's lines are annoying. But the voice work is well done and they have chemistry, that is if cartoon characters can have chemistry lol.",1239753600,2,490,4.223404255319149
3711886,5,B001N6FPQY,"I grew up watching this cartoon. Now, instead of putting in a 20+ year old VHS into the VCR, I can just pop in a DVD. Many of my favorite episodes, like ""Knock, Knock"", ""The Boogeyman Cometh"" and so many more are in this set. I can't wait for more the rest of the box sets come out! Please release them soon!",1239321600,,308,3.9838709677419355
3711887,5,B001N6FPQY,"I was a huge Ghostbusters fan growing up in the 80s, and still am to this day.  This cartoon left such an indelible impression on me that throughout the past 20 years different quotes or musical cues from the series often sprang into my head for no reason at all.

I purchased the individual discs that Sony put out a few a few years back but was just left pining for more.  I was ecstatic when I heard the entire series was being released.  I purchased the entire box set from Time Life a couple months back.  I considered waiting until volume 1 was released on it's own but once I saw the firehouse packaging and the bonus disc that was included, I had to get it.  Besides, I'm not very patient.

The extras are plentiful and the menus are nicely done.  Some episodes have introductions, some have isolated score and sound effects tracks, and some have commentary.

Each volume comes in a beautifully decorated solid steel book case and contains five discs per volume, aside from volume 5 which has only four discs.

The episodes all look and sound great and are each shown in their entirety, including the talking logo that was used when going to and coming back from commercial breaks.  In fact, if I were to have one complaint about the set, it's that the talking logo grows a bit tiresome.  With six or seven episodes per disc, and the talking logo showing up about five or six times per episode, you're looking at having to see it around thirty to forty times if you select the `play all' option.  I think it should have been featured as a bonus gallery.  However, that complaint is so minor that it doesn't take anything away from this release.

This set truly sets a standard that other `complete series' sets should strive to achieve.  With the release of the entire animated series and the upcoming releases of both the original film on Blu-ray and the video game in June, this is shaping up to be a very big year for us Ghostbusters fans.",1239235200,3,1950,4.466101694915254

I only watch the first season because I'm a loyal fan of the original Janine Melnitz, the sassy one with pointy glasses and a attitude!

When they replaced the actor who voiced Peter Venkman with Dave Coulier, the show went downhill and stupid fast... They are difficult to watch from how awesome it was. Slimer is even very obnoxious and very annoying. The music is the same for every episode lol.",1493337600,,388,4.63768115942029
