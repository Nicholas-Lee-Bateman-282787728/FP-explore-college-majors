3482185,5,B001B43IW6,"A well acted drama with some inconsistences, but well worth watching.  It got me interested and kept me watching in spite of myself and a few logical problems with actions and inaction on the part of individuals and institutions involved in this drama.  Probably not entirely realistic but compelling and very watchable.",1243555200,2,320,5.134615384615385
3482186,5,B001B43IW6,"This series reminds me of the 'Prime Suspect' series.  Amanda Burton does a great job in providing the viewer with a three dimensional character.  The series is well written, well acted, has suspenseful story lines and all in all kept me very interested.  I look forward to watching the Set 2.",1241308800,2,293,4.705882352941177
3482187,5,B001B43IW6,Amanda Burton - what a compelling performance - strong dialog and in depth stories - Lynda LaPlante obviously has the lion's share of credit here but her choice of Amanda brings it alive and gives us that; in your face emotion. When will we ever see DVD set TWO??? The wait will be far too long.,1236211200,4,295,4.285714285714286
3482188,4,B001B43IW6,"This show is a excellent example of a realistic U.K. crime drama.
The show features a flawed and foolish leader whose hormones get in the way of common sense. We have seen this in real life in every profession over and over and on the screen with many a movie. What's interesting here is that is a ruthless police chief who is a woman and  who is stumbling here.  And her ruthlessness isn't a sign of corruption , it's just how she has risen to the top. The cast is first rate and it pulls no punches and that makes for a better acted show too.
Of course most female commanders in the U.K.  are not this foolish but the author of the book this came from specializes in troubled police women. See the excellent ""Prime suspect"" series for a even better show about a british policewoman who is flawed badly but still a good cop.
Like all recent british detective shows the quality is very high and they can compete with any top show made anywhere.  If You like cop shows that are HEAVY on personal drama with murders as the backdrop then this show will be a good bet for you.",1232668800,4,1072,4.266009852216749
3482189,5,B001B43IW6,"This is good, similar to all other police procedurals, but doesn't have personal relationships among police themselves.",1230076800,2,119,6.0588235294117645
3482190,5,B001B43IW6,"This is a brilliant series. I couldn't be torn away from it -- I was in its thrall for about 4 days, when I watched all 10 hours of it and couldn't wait to get back to the TV to watch more. The casting, acting, directing, photography are all superb, and the plot is complicated and compelling. My only (slight) reservation is that the last disk is a disappointment. It has nothing to do with the three previous ones, and seems like an add-on. (My inspiration to buy this was an interview that I heard on NPR with its author/producer, Lynda LaPlante, which is available on the internet. I recommend it highly.)",1227830400,15,609,4.446428571428571
3482191,5,B001B43IW6,"I highly recommend this boxed set, it is a terrific series.  My only complaint is that  this US release contains the episode 'Blacklight' & the earlier UK release didn't. so now all of us who bought the UK set have to buy this set also.....not happy Acorn Media",1226448000,16,261,4.416666666666667
3482192,4,B001B43IW6,"Clare Blake, (high praise for Amanda Burton's acting) takes the leadership of the Murder Review Team, but immediately does something that assuredly was in the ""Commander Manual"" in red lettering, #1 under the ""DO NOT DO"" list.  Blake has a sexual affair with a murder convict just released that she herself had help get convicted. This affair gets publicized and creates a situation interfering with each the the murder investigations for the rest of the four episode, 570 minutes of top-notch murder mystery.

The 4-star rating is due to this UNBELIEVABLE action by the newly appointed Commander Blake. The movie even had the nerve to make this main character a female ""BLOND"".  Would anyone in their right mind, especially the traditional conservative British population, make such a terribly wrong judgment error after a 20-year career of making the right decisions that get you appointed to the top leadership position?

Okay, now, getting beyond that initial event, the rest of the series is on-the-edge-of-your-seat, bewildering intrigue, plots braided together holding thrilling mystery, and 5-stars. Each of the 4 episodes (About 2 1/2 hrs each) have a new primary murder to solve.  The MRT actors/actresses remain the same in each, additional cast in introduced related to the complex plots, Blake's affair with Murder Lampton resurfaces, Blake's family situations get involved, and the outcome will not be guessed, until the DVD does the disclosing.

There was the police shooting of a suspect, Cripps, that went awry and covered up for 4 episodes. Blake's blunder with the Lampton affair was further aggravated by her entrapment attempt. Will she never learn? The commander's sister gets cancer at the same time someone hacks into a hospital records system and begins murder blackmail. A special deputy, ""Blackdog"", is assigned to look into both the Lampton affair and the Cripps shooting.  Plenty of police cover-up to go all around. And finally, date rape murders begin appearing with the first London victim being, of course, Commander Blake's goddaughter.

The DVD box warns about graphic scenes and nudity. Plenty of nasty victim scenes, so beware. There is no captioning so ""Blackdog's"" words are sometimes a bit hard to catch, but the rest is not bad.

Summary: worth watching for murder mystery fans, once you accept the dumb-blond syndrome of the Commander's initial ""misjudgment.""",1224201600,24,2401,5.248041775456919

3482228,2,B001B43IW6,"COMMANDER is reminiscent in plot and character to INTELLIGENCE:  Unfortunately the similarities cease in the main characters of these two dramas.  The main character in Commander fails the expectatioins of common sense and common decency as depicted in an episode where she allows herself to fall into a suffocating ""Fatal Attraction"" with a delusional ex-con and murderer .. vulnerability w/o principles always leads to a dead-end life .. disappointing because I was left with the depressing feeling that the Commander never grew up and still needs a baby-sitter .. not exactly what we want to aspire to in our own lives .. sad.

In ""Commander,"" I was hoping for something along the lines of ""Intelligence"" set in Vancouver  .. two attractive and striking characters finding a mutually beneficial relationship while seeking the ""high-road"" in both their career choices and life .. a great mix of reality, adventure, leadership and inspiration .. a good guy caught up in the corruption of the times, trying to make the best in a back-stabbing, cut-throat world where the main character reflects the courage and leadership of Alexander, the judgement and quick reflexes of Don Corlione with the compassion and love of a devoted yet vulnerable father and family man.  Too bad ""intelligence"" did not survive even though I consider it to be the best depiction and definition of ""leadership"" we can all aspire to regardless of the times we live in.

3482237,3,B001B43IW6,"Amanda Burke carries the role well, she displays a very adaptable level of acting talent which carries the shows to three stars, perhaps a little more.

The series is focused around London's Metropolitan Police, who themselves are a very mixed group to whom controversy and corruption are far from unknown, written with the present Leveson in mind.

What makes it difficult to comprehend in this heretofore male dominated world is how a woman could advance as she did with the personal character flaws so ably displayed.

The crime plots were acceptable, the overall acting of above average quality, the scenes, costumes and backdrops accurate. They picture they try to paint has really been very well represented.

Initially the story is intriguing and becomes more so as the personal aspects of the Commander's life begin to intertwine with her career, but for me as the series progressed there was just a bit too much of the personal to make it totally credible.

If you enjoy police shows, or just good drama that are not exactly mainstream, this could be something you'll enjoy and watch many times, but if you prefer the focus to be case related and the drama in the bedroom to be kept seperate from the drama in the office you might want to consider carefully before making this purchase.

In the end, I have to agree with the principle caracter herself, she questions how she can be so stupid as to compromise everything she's spent a lifetime working for, and she asks and is asked that question more than once.",1340668800,,1520,4.782442748091603
3482238,5,B001B43IW6,"For those of you who don't recognize him, the convict released early from prison who just wrote a book, is none other than Hugh Bonneville of Downton Abbey.  He plays the father in that because he is older than he is in this series.  He is marvelous in this role.  I really don't care how improbable it is that a woman police chief would have an affair with an ex con who had murdered his girlfriend.  She is highly repressed, highly dutiful.  She is also attracted to danger.  He pushes all the right buttons in her so that she is falling madly in love with him.  Has he reformed or does he like murdering women and will eagerly return to it?  It is a lot of fun finding the answer to this question.

As a subplot, one of her underlings is plotting against her throughout the episode and wants her to get fired.  She provides him with the perfect opportunity to take her down with this controversial romance. I enjoyed this a lot but may not have with a lesser talented male lead.

I just watched it on netflix streaming.

3482239,5,B001B43IW6,"London's Met has officers at the rank of Commander overseeing large case loads in selected areas.  These commanders are aided by retired senior officers who help them work the files and the cases.  (Think ""New Tricks"" but without any smiles or humor.)  The author of the series, Lynda LaPlante, toyed with the idea of focusing on the area of Terrorism but settled instead on the area of Murder.  A Murder Commander would handle approximately 140 cases at a time.  There are few women commanders in the Met--4 at the time that LaPlante began the series.  Her Murder Commander, Clare Blake, is played to a fare-thee-well by Amanda Burton.

Clare is smart, bureaucratically-savvy, tough and comfortable in her role.  Unfortunately for her, she is impulsive.  Her principal problem--which looms over the first three episodes (approximately 7 hours of programming)--concerns her affair with a man she once arrested for murder.  He claims to be rehabilitated and an upstanding citizen, but bodies are turning up and he's in everyone's frame but Clare's.  The murderer is played by Hugh Bonneville; yes, the Earl of Grantham himself, flashing some nude backside and exhibiting some deviant behaviors.

Within the supporting cast there is a faithful old copper who is in love with Clare, though she capitalizes on his loyalty without reciprocating his love; an ambitious young constable newly promoted to inspector, with whose partner the Commander occasionally sleeps; and, finally, a male DCI (played by Matthew Marsh) with whom Clare continually clashes.  He would love to see her brought down, but when the going gets tough he realizes that they both need one another.  The dynamic between the two of them is superb.

Think: Prime Suspect, but with raging hormones, more bureaucratic in-fighting, more human frailty, more bending of the Met's rules (and of the law) but with equally fine writing and equally fine performances.  This is a little less heroic, a little more realistic, but always engaging and entertaining.  The stories are based on real occurrences, the production values very high.  Welcome to New Scotland Yard.",1333670400,4,2124,5.178885630498534
3482240,4,B001B43IW6,"I bought this strictly because I loved Prime Suspect and figured this might be as good.  Turns out that was really good thinking!  This series is intelligent, suspenseful, fun, well-plotted and a sheer delight to watch.  My only beef is with one of the critical plot points which has a seasoned police vet like the commander sleeping with a convicted killer and murder suspect.  I almost gave up on it because of that unbelievable premise, but it is a testament to how good this show is that I was hooked despite it.  So worth it!  Really excellent show!",1330387200,,554,4.6020408163265305
3482241,2,B001B43IW6,"This set really disppointed me.  I consider Lynda LaPlante's Prime Suspect series some of the best stuff ever on TV, and so I was very interested in this series after reading that she'd written this one, too.  But I not only didn't care for The Commander set, I really didn't care much for the 'heroine' at all!  I had little sympathy for her...and very little respect for her; she's definitely NOT what I'd call a heroine!  Prime Suspect's heroine is flawed for sure, but she has character & integrity in spades; the woman in this set is a bit too smug and I didn't find her to have much integrity at all, spending far too much time trying to dig herself out of the hole she'd dug for herself without much plausible reason (in my view) for having fallen in to begin with.  If I'd rented the set, I would probably have stopped after 1st segment, but -- given I'd bought the set based on the high review rating, I plodded on, thinking that surely it would get better.  It didn't, in my opinion.  By the end, I didn't really care if she succeeded in saving herself or not.  Too bad I had ignored the few more negative reviews in light of the majority of great ones; I wasted way too much money on this set!  I would not recommend it to anyone.  Far better are any of the Prime Suspect series (my faves are 1st and 6th), the Cold War era Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy set & the Smiley's People set (I think these are my absolute favorites of any TV mystery series I've seen), the House of Cards trilogy, and to just a little lesser degree, Reilly Ace of Spies. A Very British Coup, and the terrific Inspector Morse series (the last episode of which actually brought me to tears as I'd grown to care so much for the main character).",1258675200,15,1727,4.318885448916409
3482242,4,B001B43IW6,"I like the stories and the acting, but the premise of a commander being this hands on in so many cases is not feasible.

8281846,3,B001B43IW6,"I was really prepared to love this series.  LaPlante, Burton, how could it be anything other than excellent?

Sadly, it is.  One thing I usually love about the work of both of these women is the portrayal of strong, successful women in a man's world.  In this series, though...wow, this woman is stupid.  Mind you I am only on the second series (out of five) but in both stories now, Clare has compromised her career and her integrity for nothing more than a quick roll in the hay with the WRONG man.  And yeah, that should be in caps.  I mean, wow, lady.  Seriously?  How did you manage to succeed so well in so many things with this combination of poor judgement and lousy self-esteem?
