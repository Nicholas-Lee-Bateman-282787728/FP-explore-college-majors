7824385,5,6302308704,"In her triumphant return following a tragic bus accident in 1990, a fully recuperated Gloria Estefan embarked on an ambitious world concert tour showcasing her latest album: ""Into the Light.""

All in all, based upon my viewing, this fantastic compliation is a vibrant, 90-minute concert highlight reel of Gloria's Miami Sound Machine captured during the Holland portion of the tour, including her poignant rendition of the inspirational ""Coming Out of the Dark.""

Rating: 10/10 (Outstanding!) -- Hopefully, the DVD upgrade will again ""see the light"" someday.

P.S.  As a companion piece for Gloria's fans, there is also out there a prequel out-of-release VHS, ""Coming Out of the Dark,"" which insightfully focuses on Gloria's lengthy recuperation and her spirited, behind-the-scenes preparation for the Into the Light project (including music videos and the tour).  If you can still find it, it's really a gem!

Update in 2014: Please consider locating the ""Gloria Estefan on Tour - Live in Concert"" DVD available on Amazon.com.  Produced in Brazil, this official 2011 re-release (not re-mastered, but it is not a bootleg) provides the same live concert performance (indicating it was filmed in England, not Holland) as a 20th anniversary of the concert tour.  Especially, at a low price, it is highly recommended!",1268870400,,1313,5.309178743961352
