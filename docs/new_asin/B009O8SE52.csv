8543285,4,B009O8SE52,"There's been a few movies where dolls come to life and are baffled by the human world, but this is the first movie I've ever come across where that doll has been of the blow up bedroom companion variety.  Basically this movie can be compared to an alien arriving on earth movie, or a robot developing awareness film who learns about humans, our faults and our pluses.  Well mainly faults.  The plot of this one is that a blow up doll who it's lonely human owner has not just made love to each night, but also loved it, bathing it and washing its hair with expensive shampoo, buying it a number of outfits, sitting it at the table while he eats, greeting it when getting home from work and having one sided conversations with it.  So the doll has developed a heart and slowly becomes alive.  It has some sort of awareness enough to not move and keep up it's stiff limbed persona while its owner is home and also to put back on the same clothing and position itself where it was when he left.  But as it becomes more aware and fascinated by things like rain drops it decides to venture outside of the apartment it lives in. Being that it's purpose as a doll was to be useful it strives to do so in a number of endevours.  While trying to learn information and coming across a variety of people, it wrongfully assumes some are also blow up dolls and offers advice such as this conceals lines which isn't always appreciated by the recipient.  It gets a job at a DVD rental store where it learns about movies and has this new feeling for one of the coworkers that it has never experienced before.

It's more of a drama coming of age story for the doll rather than a comedy, although there are a few fun moments in it.  But it's mostly drama, if you were looking for a funny movie this isn't it.  It's also not a bedroom activity movie if you thought a film with a blow up doll would be that.  At the start we do have the owner thrusting into the blow up doll and then cleaning the detachable bit, and there's plenty of topless scenes with Doona Bae who plays the doll when human, as she puts herself back into the poses the doll was left in. There's another clothed sex scene with a guy taking advantage of her naivety where she thinks that's what she's supposed to do to be useful but that's about it.",1478131200,,2297,4.267281105990784
8543286,5,B009O8SE52,"Mesmerizing and heartbreaking, Air Doll is an honest look at love and how it can affect us all, and cautions to not tread lightly. Highly recommend!",1384646400,,148,4.730769230769231
8543287,5,B009O8SE52,Enjoyed the tongue in cheek unusual story that ticked all the boxes of traditional Japanese story telling while seeming to be a voyeuristic romp of unusual sex. The observation of Japanese society was quite devastating.,1365120000,,219,5.285714285714286
8543288,4,B009O8SE52,"If you're thinking: ""Oh, those wacky Japanese. A movie about a blow-up doll who, keenly aware that her function is to provide sexual pleasure, comes to life. That'll be fun!"", you will be surprised, if not disappointed, by this film. Du-na Bae does a few scenes in her birthday suit, and spends most of the rest of the film in cute little outfits with very short skirts--one of them being the maid's uniform you see in the poster--but there isn't much that's erotic, let alone prurient, about this film at all. It's sad and melancholy. And innocent.

In a masterstroke of casting, Du-na Bae plays the Air Doll. It's hard to think of another actress who could have made such a success of the role. Bae is a fearless, talented, versatile actress and she also somewhat looks the part with her large expressive anime inspired eyes. She's also Korean, giving her a head start playing a fish out of water in this Japanese film. There are few actors who can convincingly run through a range of several emotions in a matter of seconds without moving a muscle in their faces. Bae is one of those actors.

Air Doll has a slow pace and a number of characters seem to just float by without explanation but when it's all over they will have made sense. The central conceit of the film doesn't hold up to scrutiny if you think about it too much so if either of these things bother you, take a pass. There is also an extended scene where the Air Doll meets her maker. The director seems to have wanted to use this meeting to explain the film, ""Aren't we all just empty vessels""? Although the scene is a touching one, I could have done without it, not only because it would have tightened up the film, but also because I don't like it when directors make beautiful films and muck them up with verbal explanations of what they are trying to present metaphorically.",1357084800,5,1847,4.494047619047619
