2301327,5,B0009ML1SE,"The World at Their Feet  is an excellent look at the Women's National Team. It goes all the way back to 1985 when the team was originally formed through the 99 World Cup. The quality and production values are excellent. I am a long time fan of the WNT and have several documentaries and The World at Their Feet offered new insight and a lot of behind the scenes footage and photographs I had not seen elsewhere. I would recommend this for soccer fans, parents with young athletes and anyone interested in a compelling story.",1121731200,19,524,4.515789473684211

While this DVD is well done and does get the facts across, it is not nearly as enjoyable to watch as Dare To Dream.  If you are trying to decide between the two, I would definitely recommend choosing Dare to Dream over The World at Their Feet.",1309478400,8,327,4.190476190476191
2301408,4,B0009ML1SE,"The content of the DVD is really great. It chronicles the story of the team from beginning to end. Hitting every major highlight. Great, great DVD! The only reason that I didn't give it 5 stars is because of the narrator. I felt it was too dry. She has a narrator's voice that is more suitable for the sex ed. movies they show at school. Other than that, awesome DVD. Awesome story!",1290643200,,382,4.319444444444445

2301411,5,B0009ML1SE,"First, let me state that I'm Greek-American; therefore, I am a soccer nut. Soccer is the original football and, in Europe, it's rarely called soccer - it's called football. The game is 90 minutes with a 15-20 minute halftime. Hands are not used - only the legs, feet, head, and shoulders. There are no downs, no outs, no tangle of bodies. A beef with a ref will get you a yellow card and another beef will get you a red card, meaning you will sit out the next 3 games and your team must play 1 player short. The US Men's team needs to be as gutsy as these women - they kick for goal 50-75% downfield, and their teammates go after that ball. They take 200% more risks than the men - and they're better.

However, the core of this documentary, aside from it being the departure of several members at once because of injuries, age, and ""it's time"", is their genuine camaraderie, love of the game, and love for one another. They mentor the new players and cheer them on.  They truly LIKE each other and you don't see petty rivalry. One demonstration of their feelings for one another is when Mia Hamm lost her older brother to cancer and was with her family when a major game was being played. Every one of her teammates came onto the playing field wearing a black armband as a symbol of their mourning for her loss.

Babies come to soccer practice while their moms are getting back into shape and other team members take care of them. Those who retired, retired at the top. The new team, with still some of the older members, has learned the meaning of friendship from these women. They really do like one another, and that's what makes a good team. In fact, I can't even recall any players ever receiving a yellow or red card, or a foul.

I love European men's soccer and watch it all the time, especially the teams I really like. Men (especially the US Men's team) take heed - you can learn a lot from the US Women's team. THIS is how soccer should be played.",1181520000,,1958,4.3269754768392374
2301412,5,B0009ML1SE,"Well-needed, long overdue story, very inspiration to all young people involved in soccer today.",1167868800,,95,5.857142857142857
2301413,5,B0009ML1SE,My family really enjoyed this DVD.  It was informative and interesting listening to the players perspective of the sport.  Our daughter has been playing soccer for the last 14 years and we have followed the U.S. Women's team.  We really enjoyed this DVD.,1155513600,8,254,4.8604651162790695
2301414,5,B0009ML1SE,"This is a magnificent story that must continue to be told.  This story is for young athletes (starting at 8) and for their parents.  Young women soccer teams should gather and watch it together and try to imagine a world where they would not have access to their sport.  It is so easy to forget how far we have come during this generation encouraging and celebrating our female athletes.  Since the advent of Title IX in 1972, we have begun the journey of equality for girls and young women in access and participation in sports, availability of college athletic scholarships, and access to professional sports careers with fair pay.  The young women in this video were pioneers and heroines and what a story they created as they made their way to the World Cup and the Olympic games and pioneered the women's soccer league.  The archived footage used to tell the story is magnificent.  A video of a similar genre but with a story that predates Tile IX is the documentary ""Billie Jean King: Portrait of a Pioneer"".  You have to see this one, too.",1152316800,12,1046,4.616216216216216
2301415,5,B0009ML1SE,"I am a male and I am not a soccer fan.  The last time I played soccer was probably at recess in sixth grade.  But I am an athlete, a huge sports fan and an American.  For a reason unbeknownst to me, I was watching the 1999 World Cup Final live on TV.  I can say without a doubt that, with the exceptions of maybe McGwire's 62nd and Gibson's 1988 miracle, it was the most exciting sports moment I have ever witnessed.

In June 2006 I watched ""Dare to Dream: The Story of the U.S. Women's Soccer Team"" on HBO. Since that documentary was not out on DVD, I bought this one. This DVD does not disappoint.  It covers the history of the team - from their days of toiling in anonymity through the historic 1999 World Cup run, when an entire country rallied behind them.  I found it inspiring to learn how a group of teenagers (Mia Hamm was 15 when she joined the team in 1987) persevered for so long while getting paid so little, all for their love of their game and each other.  It was neat to see the rise of women's soccer from the first crowds of a few hundred to the 1999 World Cup final game crowd of over 90,000. Several people were interviewed  for this DVD, including several team members, the coaches, family members, sports writers and even former President Clinton.  They all share different perspectives on the team which are neat to hear.

This DVD offers insight not only into the team but also into some of its players individually.  It was cool to see the bond and cameraderie that existed between them which I am sure had a lot to do with their success.

For me, this DVD was eye opening because I didn't know a whole lot about the team other than that I respected and enjoyed watching what they did in 1999.  I can admit that I don't often watch women's athletics, but I can say that I now have a whole new respect for women's soccer.  I'd recommend this DVD to every soccer fan, any sports fan and any patriotic American.

P.S. I'd also recommend getting the ""Dare to Dream: The Story of the U.S. Women's Soccer Team"" DVD when it comes out.",1150761600,44,2052,4.290909090909091
2301416,4,B0009ML1SE,"It is a great DVD for anyone who is interested in Womens soccer especially how womens soccer came to be so big in the USA. It shows who put in the hard work and what they did for their sport, for womens sport, and how the first world cup in the USA (99?) suprised them all with the huge support they had. It shows the true characters of all involved, golden. Recommend for anyone interested in USA Womens soccer.",1127952000,11,412,4.227848101265823

The film chronicles the 1990 team in which Michelle Akers was the star. It moves in through their highs and lows and what they had to endure in a sport that still was not very popular in the United States. The World Cup in China was a huge event back in 1990. The girls were on the cover of newspapers in China and there was a tremendous amount of notoriety. When they returned home there were only four people waiting for them at the airport, that's it. All that hard work they did to win and no one noticed in the United States. When they played in the World Cup in 1995, it felt like amateur hour compared to China. The film also chronicles their grassroots growth going into the 1999 World Cup as each team  player had to sell tickets. It highlights the entire 1999 team and you'll discover that Mia Hamm wasn't the only star of that team. In order to appreciate soccer today, you have to understand what the women went through in the past. This is a great documentary for every soccer player who has dreams of making it onto the world stage. I have a whole new respect for the foundation laid by Mia Hamm, Julie Foudy,  Carla Overbeck, Michelle Akers, and the rest of the 1999 team. Soccer coaches should to have this as a mandatory viewing for all the players.",1474934400,2,1584,5.019011406844107

This is such a great story and really highlights the struggle for recognition that women have faced in the world of sports.

8063286,5,B0009ML1SE,"THE WORLD AT THEIR FEET (2000) tells the story of the creation of the first U.S. Women's National Team (WNT) in 1985 and their amazing success through-out the 1990's. This story is told chronologically by many of the players using high quality video clips (and sub-titles are available too). It covers all the major events, from winning the 1991 Women's World Cup, winning gold in the 1996 Women's Olympic Football Tournament, and ends after winning the 1999 Women's World Cup. What makes this 60 minute video so enjoyable is that the players tell their own story, with high quality video clips of the games, coaches, and even the Clinton's contribute comments. Michelle Akers, Mia Hamm, Julie Foudy, Brandi Chastain, Kristine Lilly, Joy Fawcett, Carla Overbeck, goalie Briana Scurry and many others tell the story in this video (all the speakers are also identified in this video).

It might not give us all the details (only 60 minutes), but it does give an accurate representation of the feelings and happenings at that time and tells a complete story. I recommend this video to be enjoyed by those interested in the best Woman's Football Team in the World. If you are a big fan, you should also watch the DARE TO DREAM video, often shown on HBO channels.",1436745600,,1258,4.824074074074074
