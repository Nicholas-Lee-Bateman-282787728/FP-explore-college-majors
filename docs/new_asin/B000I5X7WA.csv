8144098,5,B000I5X7WA,This is a GREAT movie for my mom and I to watch together. It arrived before the estimated time and my mom was surprised...thank you!,1401840000,2,132,4.32
8144099,5,B000I5X7WA,"I love this movie because of its twists and turns, not to mention a terrific cast headed up by the matchless Candice Bergen.",1366761600,3,124,4.434782608695652
8144100,1,B000I5X7WA,"I must absolutely agree with the one other reviewer here, so far, who also gave this one star.....this ""movie"" WAS a TV production, and even in that genre, one of the worst examples I have ever seen.  What was evident from the outset was the combination of terribly orchestrated histrionics from the lead ""star"", Bergen, the nevertheless largely wooden presentation, and the unbelieveably predictable, telegraphed plot line, and presentation.  My wife and I turned it off after 10 minutes.  Cannot believe Amazon charged $4.32 for this, when Amazon otherwise so often presents real bargins on this site, including the free passes for those of us on Prime.",1359158400,,655,5.102803738317757
8144101,3,B000I5X7WA,"I'm a big, big fan of Ira Levin, the late, great novelist (ROSEMARY'S BABY, THE STEPFORD WIVES, THE BOYS FROM BRAZIL, etc.) and playwright (DEATHTRAP, Broadway's longest-running thriller). That said, I wasn't really delighted by this 2003 TV-movie version of his unproduced 1996 play, FOOTSTEPS. What might have worked on a stage--one set, 5 characters, a tense situation with a few surprises--doesn't really make for a compelling film, despite everyone's best efforts.

Well, maybe not their best. Director John Badham (WAR GAMES, SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER, STAKEOUT, and the wonderful 1974 TV movie, REFLECTIONS OF MURDER) has certainly done better in the past. And the star, Candice Bergen, isn't all that convincing as a phobic, traumatised damsel-in-distress; her obvious intelligence and strength make her a bad fit for the role. Bryan Brown, Bug Hall (I love that name!), and Michael Murphy are the three sinister men in her life, and they've all done better work elsewhere, too.

A bestselling mystery writer (Bergen) with psychological issues (she feels responsible for a recent, real-life murder in which the perp copied one of her books) is all alone one dark-and-stormy night in her isolated island retreat. She finds a crazy teen fan (Hall) hiding in her closet. Then a local cop (Brown) arrives, and he acts even more suspiciously than the kid. Where is her beloved pet terrier, which has mysteriously disappeared? And where is her concerned husband (Murphy) while these strange men menace his fragile wife? There follows a tense series of events involving drugged drinks, incriminating videos, underwater swimming, and a flare gun, leading to a ""surprise"" finale that isn't much of a surprise.

I guess I enjoyed FOOTSTEPS on a superficial level--I'm a sucker for ""old dark house"" mysteries. But I expected more from the great Ira Levin. It's okay, but not nearly as good as it might have been. Recommended mainly for Ira Levin completists--all others, go watch ROSEMARY'S BABY or the original 1975 film version of THE STEPFORD WIVES again.",1355270400,,2050,5.187311178247734
8144102,4,B000I5X7WA,Came across this on Fox Movie Channel.  Caught my attention right away.  Wife and I watched whole thing.  Has some minor laps in logic.  Still seems to hold your attention.  Enjoyed it very much.,1354924800,,195,4.617647058823529
8144103,1,B000I5X7WA,"I can't believe Candice Bergen was in this movie...hello!!!!  The acting was terrible, the plot was so..whatever.  I believe we've been there and done this before.  According to the synopsis, it should have been like a newer version of Misery.  But it was NOT!  Terrible acting by everyone.  Please, leave this one on the shelf.",1250899200,,328,4.872727272727273
8144104,5,B000I5X7WA,"A phobic female mystery writer (Candice Bergen) arrives home late one night to find her dog missing and an intruder in her house. The intruder says he's a fan and met no harm. But then a cop appears, invites himself inside and chases the kid off. But soon the writer begins to suspect the cop may not in fact be a cop, may be a hit man instead, and the plot begins to thicken.

This story is written as a play, so there are few characters, a lot of dialogue and more than a measure of surprises and intrigue. Candice Bergen provides a sterling performance as does Bryan Brown. I'll watch this movie again.",1163721600,12,605,4.307017543859649
