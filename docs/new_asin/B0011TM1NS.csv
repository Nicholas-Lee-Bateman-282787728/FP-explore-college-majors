8242270,3,B0011TM1NS,"The DVD is okay, but it has far too much concentration on temples and not enough on sight-seeing.  The DVD consisted of about 60% temples and Buddhism, 10% Taiwanese Aborgines and only 30% on sight-seeing attactions.  In my opinion, could have been done much better.",1264204800,5,266,4.888888888888889
