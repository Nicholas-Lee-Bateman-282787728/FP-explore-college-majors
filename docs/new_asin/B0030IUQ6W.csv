4046471,5,B0030IUQ6W,By far Dr Ravi Godse's best movie yet.  An entertaining mystery thriller movie that is a must see!,1264204800,3,98,4.444444444444445
8385922,1,B0030IUQ6W,"I'm shocked at the 5 star ratings. Those are probably family members ratings....

The acting is terrible. Not much to say beyond that, just horrible actors.

The story line is confusing, abrupt and not funny in the least.

The humor is completely lost on me... Nothing funny about making fun of suicide or schizophrenics",1522195200,,320,4.888888888888889
8385923,5,B0030IUQ6W,"Anyone giving this a bad rating is missing the point. This is bad, in the best way possible. It is the movie that out Rooms The Room. It is hilarious, not just when its trying to be but constantly. Terrible acting, horrific dialogue, and absolutely great because of it. I have no idea why this hasn't become the midnight showing cult classic it deserves to be.",1520726400,,360,4.46969696969697
8385924,5,B0030IUQ6W,"There were a few things that are narratives about ourselves.  Bias,  not racism.  It was NOT poorly acted and mostly, I was a voluntary patient and I can relate to being a 72HR patient.",1515888000,,185,4.382352941176471
8385925,5,B0030IUQ6W,"I watched the entire movie. I laughed almost the entire time.

Also, I ate some pot food and I'm stoned AF.",1485734400,,107,4.095238095238095
8385926,1,B0030IUQ6W,"I don't think I'm offended easily, but the only way these kinds of jokes are funny, is if they're done right. This is a bad movie with nothing good in it.",1435708800,4,154,4.0
8385927,2,B0030IUQ6W,"Wow, bad acting, bad script, bad direction, stupid premise and not funny. I was looking for something about schizophrenia. Seriously, a ""comedy"" about suicide and schizophrenia as a vehicle for a movie about racial stereotyping as a comedy? terrible",1390348800,3,249,5.410256410256411
8385928,3,B0030IUQ6W,"I chose this one because again most of the women I work with have mental illness and in order to make them understand their mental illness I use video, lecture, discussion, workbook, speakers, and group therapy.",1362960000,2,211,4.888888888888889
8385929,2,B0030IUQ6W,This movie was not very good.  It will go out in our next yard sale for $1.00 and we're hoping we'll get that much for it.  The description sounded like it would be a cute movie but it was a waste of time & money.,1334620800,2,213,3.7111111111111112
8385930,5,B0030IUQ6W,"This is an entertaining, suspenseful, and occasionally funny independent film that centers around a doctor (played by Dr. Ravi Godse) who is accused of negligence after a patient commits suicide. Following a media frenzy surrounding the accusations against him, Dr. Ravi voluntarily checks into a mental facility, only to check himself out of the facility after learning the whole truth. It's up to Dr. Godse, his flamboyant attorney, and a wisecracking detective to solve the case.

This film represents a humorous take on varying stereotypes that exist in the medical profession, and Dr. Ravi comes across as a very likable character. The courtroom scenes, despite having very serious implications for the film's characters, also manage to be quite funny, along the lines of other court comedies such as ""My Cousin Vinny"" and ""Trial and Error.""

The film is very entertaining, wastes little time (88 minutes in length), and is helped greatly by a few big plot twists. It will make you think, but not to the point where it is confusing. The plot is easy to follow, and the cast does well in transition, pulling off the twists and the conclusion convincingly. I would highly recommend this film to those who like independent movies that feature suspense, mystery, and humor.",1280188800,5,1274,5.061904761904762
8385931,5,B0030IUQ6W,"Independent filmmaker Ravi Godse has done it again with this movie - it made me laugh and kept me on the edge the whole time.  Definitely one I am going to watch again and again.  Im looking forward to his next work - If it Aint Broke, Break it - with Steve Guttenberg and Richard Kind, which was debuted at the Pittsburgh Film Festival this year.",1267315200,5,347,4.242424242424242
