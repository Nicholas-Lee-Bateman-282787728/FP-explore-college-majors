Seriously, they are so much more interesting and REAL than so much of what HC is showing these days.  What would it take to get them available on DVD?

7788626,5,0767012437,"This is an absolutely wonderful documentary series produced by the History Channel.  There are four different episodes included in the set: Tecumseh, The Dream of Confederacy deals with the Shawnee leader's attempt to unite the eastern tribes into a grand scheme to push the invading whites back east across the mountains and secure their homeland.  Rogers Rangers is concerned with the famous exploits of Major Robert Rogers and his band of frontier rangers during the French and Indian War.  Pontiac's Rebellion deals with the major Indian uprising in 1763 following the end of the F&I War in the Great Lakes region.  Long Knives tells the story of George Rogers Clark and his amazing campaign to win the Northwest Territtory from the British during the American Revolution.  Thsi is a great series and I wish the H-channel did more of them!  Highly recommended to anyone with even a passing interest in American History.",1017705600,3,923,5.0394736842105265
