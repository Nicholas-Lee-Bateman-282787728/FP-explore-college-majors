1665723,4,B00005UM2Z,"I bought this movie mainly for footage of Ali and his contemporaries, and therefore wasn't expecting much of a plot or a very deep documentary.  For this reason I wasn't disappointed.  Keep in mind that this film was primarily something for Ali to do during his exile that would make money.  It's full of interesting quotes and clips that show a closer side of Ali and make for an enjoyable viewing.  At times it slips into an argument with famed boxing trainer Cus D'Amato over whether or not Muhammad Ali is really the best boxer of his time (D'Amato thinks otherwise) that is a little pointless as it is never resolved.

I think this film is best as a companion to other films, such as Ali, The Greatest, and/or When We Were Kings.  If you love Ali, you'll like this.",1203033600,11,770,4.464285714285714

1665760,5,B00005UM2Z,"Five stars is not enough. Ali was the greatest both inside and outside of the ring. All Americans, and anyone anywhere that hold that freedom and human rights must be universal, should see this video. Ali was a moral giant with a stalwart internalized sense of right and wrong. He would not, and did not, bow down to a racist establishment power structure that offered odds vastly against him sustaining himself if he stood against it. He was willing to risk all of the fame and fortune that he had miraculously achieved, to suffer being barred from his profession forever if necessary, and even to go to jail. He intended to follow his spiritual/moral core beliefs no matter what. He did so and he paid dearly. He lost what many believed might have been his best 3 years in the ring when he was barred from fighting for that period of time, he had difficulty in making a living, he drew chagrin for being a black Muslim...but, when the smoke cleared he came off of the ropes victorious. This story is a salute to the human spirit of a true champion of the human race and I'm not referring to his superb boxing. His courage and dedication was an inspiration and to the benefit of
humanity. He was, and will remain, a true hero. Everyone should see this video. It should be mandatory in schools.",1440979200,3,1294,4.51063829787234

1665769,5,B00005UM2Z,"A.K.A. Cassius Clay is a time capsule documentary look at the life of Muhammad Ali before he was reinstated by the US boxing commission for refusing to be drafted during the Vietnam War.  The film takes us from the early life of Ali until the present day (circa. 1968).  One of the highlights of this film is his look at the older fighters along with Cus D'Amato and his demonstration of the Ali Shuffle.  His conversion to Islam and the affect it had on his career is documented as well.  If you're a fight fan this is a must for you.

Highly recommended",1233187200,3,555,4.349514563106796

1665771,5,B00005UM2Z,"Released in '70,  before Frazier, Foreman, Spinks, etc., it's amazing how much substance there already is. The first third of this legend's story, as told here, is more than the Mike Tysons of this world will clock in with for a lifetime.",1209772800,,238,4.666666666666667
1665772,4,B00005UM2Z,"Sin ser un documental que trate en profundidad la trayectoria o la vida de Ali, tiene la gracia de ser contemporneo a l, de modo que la pelcula tiene una esttica y una manera de narrar las cosas que es particular de los 70s (si no te gusta este estilo, ya puedes ir borrando una estrella).
La pelcula trata muy brevemente la trayectoria de Ali, con algunos detalles (que se agradecen) de sus inicios an no profesionales, para luego ahondar en su momento actual (recordemos que la pelcula se filma cuando Ali est en pleno problema legal-militar-religioso). Vas a encontrar algunos rounds de peleas importantes, pero quizs este aspecto no es tan bueno como en otros documentales.

Lo bueno: Algunos detalles de su vida antes de volverse profesional. Su intercambio de comentarios con D'Amato, y el hecho que la pelcula tiene ese gustillo de la poca.

Lo malo: Si no eres un verdadero fantico de Ali, o ests recin comenzando a serlo, necesitas algo ms general: ""Ali, The Whole Story"" (te va a fascinar)

Lo feo: Para algunos, la esttica, el hecho que el sonido es Mono, y el que algunos clips de peleas parecen haber sido filmados desde la pantalla del televisor (de los de esa poca me entiendes?)",1207699200,,1194,4.6761904761904765

7954731,4,B00005UM2Z,"The documentary is a bit choppy at times. Part of it is narrated, telling the early career and rise of Ali. The other part is Ali trading stories and discussing boxing styles with the great trainer, Cus D'amaro. It is also a  glimpse into Ali's life while he was banished form boxing during those three years. Despite its flaws it is a must see for any Ali fan or boxing historian.",1467158400,,381,4.366197183098592
