2862855,3,B000R9GM7E,"This is a rare piece of footage, lasting only about eight minutes and showing Mable Normand in the earliest part of her career.  I find it amusing and historically interesting -- especially to see the 1913 state of the art in car racing --, but this sort of thing is obviously not for everyone. The filming technique is so primitive that Ms. Nomand's comedic style is hardly highlighted.  The film quality is not too bad considering that this is such a very old piece of stock.",1261008000,2,477,4.534883720930233
8199734,4,B000R9GM7E,Fast and Furious Silent Gem.  It's great to see Mabel's antics and to see what the landscape of 1913 looked like.  And the cars!  You cannot judge a film made in 1913 by today's film standards so anyone complaining about that should pretty much be disregarded.  You have to love silent films to appreciate them for what they are and at 8 minutes - you really can't go wrong!,1517961600,,374,4.3768115942028984
8199735,4,B000R9GM7E,"Although very short and thus, not much time to develop the storyline, it was fun - especially the facial expressions (and overacting) of the father in the story!  Fun to see the old race cars, too and the slapstick humor.",1466208000,,221,4.525

8199737,5,B000R9GM7E,A wonderful little gem of a short done by one of the best actresses of the Golden Era of film. There were three (?) early famous racers (Barney Oldfield was the one I recognised). Mabel was known and respected by most of her peers long after her death at a young age.,1444953600,,267,4.153846153846154

8199741,4,B000R9GM7E,"As a fan and collector of the films of Mabel Normand, I was happy to find a few films here that I'd never seen.  These are unrestored prints, and as such, the quality varies greatly.  Three of the films--one with Fatty Arbuckle and the two made for Hal Roach--are in pretty bad shape.  But the rest are acceptable quality.  Collectors might want to know that some of the prints use later re-issue titles, but the original titles are also given on-screen.  This is basically a no-frills DVD-R, but the rarity of the films might make it worthwhile for hardcore fans.",1381795200,5,564,4.6
8199742,5,B000R9GM7E,"Great Release. I am really tired of reading the complaints about product like this. Not everyone has the money to restore this material, but it is a niche market. If people want to complain , they can just watch the ""restored"" product, but in doing so, they are limiting their viewing choices.",1350604800,4,293,4.653846153846154
8199743,1,B000R9GM7E,These are not actually printed dvd's. All covers are inkjet printed (with perforated edges) and paper sticker dvd faces. They look exactly like pirated unofficial copies. The movies are copied on purple DVD-R's. I will be asking for a refund immediately.,1285372800,10,254,5.219512195121951
