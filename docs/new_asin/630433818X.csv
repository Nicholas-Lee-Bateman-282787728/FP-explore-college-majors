The cover said he was a master, i think he has not  been playing very long himself. What we need is a video from a real master  accordionist!",943228800,2,313,4.032258064516129
7870288,4,630433818X,"I'm a guitarist who is attempting to learn the button accordion.  This video is serving as my primary means of instruction right now.  Overall it's been worthwhile.  The instructor is a good player, but I have to say  that he does a relatively poor job of explaining what he's doing.  It's  best just to watch the video very closely and keep hitting the rewind  button to figure things out.",933552000,2,390,4.565217391304348
7870289,5,630433818X,"i play regular accordion, and my uncle bought me  a button accordion about 4 years ago.  Try as I  might, I was unable to figure it out and it was  sitting in my closet until last week.  Thanks to  this video, I was able to  get a few songs out of this wonderful sounding instrument.",930009600,,283,4.036363636363636
