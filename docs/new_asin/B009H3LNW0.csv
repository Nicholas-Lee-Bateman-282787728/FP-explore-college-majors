5334731,3,B009H3LNW0,"""Rory Jansen had everything he ever wanted but somewhere the old man was waiting and he could change everything."" Rory (Cooper) is a struggling writer. He has just finished a book that everyone loves but no one will publish. Frustrated he and his wife Dora head to France for a getaway. While there Dora buys him a bag he can use for his work. The bag changes his life forever. To start with this movie is actually very deep and thought provoking. This is the type of movie that makes you feel tense the entire time and you feel more like a voyeur then an audience member. The acting is great in this and the movie is very much worth watching. On the other hand I had a hard time really getting that into it, but my mother LOVED it and talked about it for days. The movie is not really my type. I love the heavy character driven movies that keep you guessing (and this one does), but I just couldn't get into the subject matter. Overall, a movie that is very good and worth watching but was hard for me to relate to. I give it a B.",1355702400,,1031,4.16
5334732,5,B009H3LNW0,"If you do then you don't.  There is nothing to get here.  There is what it means and what it doesn't.  I haven't seen a blurb or review on this movie that even comes remotely close to what i think it's about.  And that's why it's great.

It means something to me but not to you, and that's what art is.  This is art.  I'm not sure why the critics hated it, but i would hazard a guess that maybe it's because it SAYS something.  Maybe they wanted it to say something else.

All that aside, what it does or doesnt mean, what it does or doesnt do aside, it is well done.  Acting.  Script.  Setting.  Those are undeniables.",1355184000,2,619,4.100840336134453
5334733,5,B009H3LNW0,"Lay aside the critical reviews that have filleted this movie, and perhaps even your friends and family that didn't get it.

If you are a writer, you will get it.

The meat of this movie is as much about the struggles living up to expectations as it is about plagiarism. The pressures to have a ""real job"" and the approval you seek from those around you and what price you are willing to pay to hang on to that approval.  When you feel it is your calling to be a writer, you constantly are filled with self doubt.  Will I ever be good enough? Will my writing ever be good enough?

Because these are the driving forces of the film, of course it isn't some after-school special aimed at bringing an end to plagiarism.  It is structured around the choices we make in building our lives. What are we willing to sacrifice for success?

While the nested stories could have gone very wrong, the film is well-executed and not hard to follow.  And while Dennis Quaid was a bit of an odd casting choice for the particular role he plays, and the narration can be a little heavy-handed at times, it does not detract from the story threads.

All-in-all a splendid movie that is most certainly worth owning.",1353542400,293,1192,4.431192660550459
5334734,5,B009H3LNW0,"Already my wife wants another viewing. I'm prone to agree. We're 2 book addicts, drama film lovers, and this film's depth is not often seen in big screen theater. It's about sacrificing integrity for fame and money. It details how an unscrupulous decision can implode and create collateral emotional damage to cherished people. The Words is presented in storyline layers, woven together like literature, not easily tracked by those simply looking at action, FX, and adventure. THE WORDS is intellectual with a capital WOW.

Hammond (Dennis Quaid) writes a story about an ambitious, but not stellar, young writer Rory (Bradley Cooper) who has ripped-off an unpublished manuscript written by an old man (Jeremy Irons) over 60 years earlier. If you don't understand `plagiarism', stop here and don't bother viewing. It's the entire plot in one word. The story progresses in the same fashion as a bestseller novel, layers woven together, scenes jumping from 2012 to 1940 Paris, and back, from one author (reality) to the next (fictional.) Slow going, NO! Just bookish. After all, the film is about writers--and their significant others. In the end the layers converge, but leave the viewer agape.

Rory Jansen's wife, Dora, (Zoe Saldana) is one hot beauty and encouragement to a struggling author. Until... Romantic scenes remain at family viewing level. Also you will love awesome period scenes when the younger life of the old man is told primarily in narration. Actors mostly act, not speak, doing pantomime well. In a novel the words would have been italicized and the visuals would be only thoughts. The Words makes a book come to life before your eyes, like the manuscript did for the author characters in the film.

Applauds for the 3 leads, Quaid, Irons, & Cooper; but also Zoe. Let's not forget the Director/Writers Brian Klugman and Lee Sternthal.

THE WORDS should be required viewing for every writer or reader. For every English, creative writing, journalist, or any writing major student.

5334736,2,B009H3LNW0,"Do you have a plan for your life? Some impressive goal that you've set for yourself? What if, while working toward that goal, you found a shortcut? Would you take it?

  A renowned author by the name of Clayton Hammond (played by Dennis Quaid) is reading excerpts from his new novel to a crowd of anxious admirers. The title of that novel is The Words and the protagonist is also a writer. The writer in Hammond's novel is Rory Jansen (played by Bradley Cooper) and while he earns his living at a literary agency, his official title is mail supervisor. He's submitted numerous works to various agents and publishers, but with no success. Still, Dora (his live-in girlfriend played by Zoe Saldana) tells him not to lose hope. Time passes; Rory and Dora marry, and honeymoon in Paris. France, not Texas, in case you weren't sure. While shopping, Dora comes across a leather briefcase in an antique store and buys it for Rory. With the honeymoon over, the couple returns home to the same trials and tribulations. While examining the briefcase Dora gave him, Rory finds a manuscript inside. It's old; that much is obvious from the paper and the fact that it was typed on an old-fashioned typewriter. What Rory finds when he examines it further, is that it is a beautiful story written by someone whose talent far outweighs his own. Shocked by this and still disheartened by his own prospects, or lack thereof, he decides to type the entire novel on his own laptop just to feel the flow of the story in his fingers. From there things get even more complicated.

  Now, there's a good deal more to The Words than what I've just told you. Hammond, Dennis Quaid's character, has suffered a personal setback that I didn't get to mention, there's the origin of the manuscript found by Cooper's character, what happens once he's entered the entire tome into his laptop. Still, I didn't enjoy it. I can appreciate films about writers, even stories within stories, but there are no truly sympathetic characters in The Words. The actors, Cooper, Saldana, Quaid, Olivia Wilde, Jeremy Irons etc, all play their parts well, they just aren't particularly interesting. I had high hopes, but I was disappointed.",1352505600,4,2191,4.7678100263852246
5334737,4,B009H3LNW0,"Hmmm.... A thought-provoking adult film for grown-ups. Whatever will they think of next? You'll want to pay close attention, because even the intricately plotted back story has a back story, which is appropriate because this is a movie about writers. It's fascinating to watch it unfold.

Not only do directors Lee Sternthal and Brian Klugman play minor characters in this movie, they also share screen-writing honors. In it, a striving author is confronted with fame and fortune after a manuscript he claims as his own enjoys mammoth success. Now he has to deal with the potential pain and shame of exposure, in this PG-13 drama inspired by a couple of notorious plagiarism cases in the recent past.

Some of these characters are supposed to be real:
  * Bradley Cooper (""Hit and Run"") is Rory, our writer, who may or may not be fictitious. Is this talented actor going to suffer the ""Paul Newman Syndrome,"": Too pretty to be taken seriously?
  * Zo Saldana (""Columbiana"") is Dora, the gal Rory loves and marries.
  * Jeremy Irons (""Margin Call"") is The Old Man, who appears in Rory's life, claiming authorship of a long-lost book.
  * Ben Barnes (""Dorian Gray"") is The Young Man, a WWII soldier featured in that best-selling book.
  * Nora Arnezeder (""Paris 36"") is Celia, the lovely Parisian with whom our WWII hero falls in love.
  * Dennis Quaid (""Footloose"") is Clay Hammond, an author who is promoting his book which tells the story of Rory, Dora, Celia, a WWII soldier and an Old Man.
  * Olivia Wilde (""The Change-Up"") is Danielle, the doctoral candidate who will be writing her dissertation about Clay Hammond and his fiction.

We left the theater discussing whether or not we had seen a movie about a book that is about a book, or.... Hmmm.... When you see it, please let me know what you think. It is beautifully done and everyone does a perfectly splendid job. No gunshots, no vehicular mayhem, no blowie uppie stuff and no sweaty bodies, but we were entertained despite those glaring defects...smile... I'll look it over more carefully when I get my DVD from Amazon.",1349481600,,2080,4.781512605042017
5334738,4,B009H3LNW0,"As I am currently embarked on writing a book I went to see this movie not knowing much about it and found that it unexpectedly resonated with me.

Briefly put it's a story within a story within a story. Bradley Cooper plays an aspiring writer married to Zoe Saldana. Life surely can't be that bad if you're married to Zoe Saldana. He sacrifices every other possibility to be a writer and finds that it challenges his manhood not to be living a life on purpose and in struggling to succeed.

Everything changes when he discovers a tattered manuscript within the lining of his black leather attache case. Everyone who reads it acknowledges it as a masterpiece. It enables him to get his other works published and he gets all the acclaim he ever wanted. Only thing is the story is not his and soon the real writer appears played by Jeremy Irons who gives one of the best acting performances I have seen all year.

A parallel story emerges with Dennis Quaid playing a writer telling the story played by Bradley Cooper which raises the question of whether it's truth or fiction and then we have the Jeremy Irons story within a story set near the end of WW2 in France and the events on which the book is based.

If there is one thing I learned from this movie the number one reason to write a reason a book is not for acclaim or money or personal satisfaction, but book groupies in this case amply played by Olivia Wilde.

How much of what a writer writes is imagination and how much personal experience?
The Words poses that question and the answer is worth wondering about and I think the movie is well worth experiencing.

If the story has one weakness I think the resolve is too easy, there's no real test of conscience or dark side.

I think most people will find it thought provoking at least and as most people think about writing a book at some point, you may find some resonance with it as I did. Like most movies it will not please everyone. Hope this was helpful.",1347235200,,1968,4.419889502762431

5334740,3,B009H3LNW0,"I loved the first half of this movie, so much so that I convinced my husband to watch it with me, requiring that I watch the first half twice (also the reason I'm giving it 3 stars and not 2). Sadly what started out as a great movie ended very abruptly with little explanation as to what happened to the characters. Characters, I might add, that the first part of the movie was dedicated to developing and convincing the audience to really care about.  The last 30 min. were so different from the rest of the movie that I thought perhaps it was  directed by someone different, or maybe the studio said Sorry gang you're gonna have to wrap this up tomorrow., when they thought they had 6 months left of shooting.

What they transfer to us is the burden of having something stolen. While the movie can flow slow, depending on the viewer's taste, it really landed with me -- are writers tormented for loving the story, and the evocative power of putting words together, more than those whose lives are entwined with the story as well?

Some comments I read seem dive a little too deep into the issue of plagiarism and how it is played off to not be a big enough deal. To that I say, you missed the point. We all understand as human beings with any morale compass - plagiarism is something that should never be tolerated. The movie is fiction and I truly believe that when we try to dive too deep or spin things to be too negative for our own personal agendas, sometimes we miss the point.

There are times in life where we are faced with decisions and as the old man stated, we choose our decisions and the consequences we deal with, whatever they may be. I think that is the greater point of this story. There are so many other beautiful points woven into this story that I truly enjoyed. We got to see the deep resounding effects of love - so deep that the old man could not be himself in his original home. The pain of losing a child and the tearing apart of ones own soul, emotions and relationships. I could go on...but I don't think that's fair if you haven't seen the movie.

Worth the time, definitely could have been sped up at parts and maybe dived a little deeper in others. The monologue at the end I have to re watch to see if it provides a telling of what happened...but it's something I may just have to live with guessing.",1518480000,,1573,4.184818481848184

Overly complex presentation.  Way too much jumping back and forth in time periods as to result in some confusion keeping up with where are we now.  The show does a decent job of showing the various types of suffering different folks can go through in life.  The main character's emotional journey was interesting.  Potential to have been a great literary thriller, but really fell short of it.  Also there is a story within a story within the main story -- way to much for the average viewer to keep track of -- so most will just lose all the undertones as they are not strongly portrayed based on the writing.  Further, the music is way too loud and becomes distracting from the movie (which is extremely rare in movies).  RECOMMEND with the above caveats.",1504656000,11,913,4.574074074074074

This is left to the free will that each person possess. The hope is that each person will make the right decision.

Plagiarism is a huge character defect to be handled this lightly, but in today's world such defects are not required to be closely examined and the writer of this story spent more time moving the plot along, weak as it is, rather than addressing the actual resolution with change.

Main character (Clay) is a writer who in his early carrier really stole a story. His last book is story about him (Rory) stealing a book (like he actually did) but the old man part is fictional, made up and not true, and its there just to make a trivia, a story line.

SO... basically main character (Clay) is a thief who even lied about how he stole. Clay is a thief and a lier with conscious, judging by the last book he wrote and ending of the movie.

What do you think? What did the last line mean (""Or maybe he sees his own face, and old man is just a story he made up"")",1497744000,,796,4.089743589743589

I do have to credit the directors Brian Klugman and Lee Sternthal for the success of this project though. Directors can take a good story and ruin it. They can take a bad story and make it good.

Many, should I say most, have disliked the ending. I often like some gifts left not all wrapped up in a neat and tidy bow. The filmmakers leave us asking questions and allow us to fill in the end.
I like the ambiguity that makes the audience question who and what is real. The filmmakers trust the audience and allow us to use our imagination as the film ends.

This is a story about a successful author who tells a story about a writer who achieves success only after he finds and plagiarizes an old unpublished, type written novel. The beginning has potential and the cast is smart but it quickly spirals to just a trite, self-indulgent story about writers.  It is neither happy nor sad, nor joyous nor grim.  It is instead tidy and convenient.  Hardly worthy of high praise.",1490400000,,456,4.883116883116883

5335133,4,B009H3LNW0,"Like many others on here I thought this was mesmerizing and beautifully filmed/acted as it switched back and forth between the different layers of the metafictional story, and also thought ""is that it?"" as it seemed to abruptly end before the closing credits rolled.  Instead of sulking about it, I just went ""hmm"" to myself and moved on, but then a few hours later I found I couldn't stop thinking about the film and what it was supposed to be about.

Many viewers may feel that the word ""thriller"" in the film's description is misleading, because they have the expectation of a climax that serves as either a resolution or a revelation of the suspense and mystery, neither of which are explicitly spelled out here.  It's only after you digest and internalize the work that a whole world of things beneath the surface become more apparent.  In this sense The Words is very much in line with the author it's paying homage to.

I'm not going to spell those things out here, but i'll just say pay close attention to the dialogue in the final scene in particular, and think about how it relates to the other stories as well as how both of these characters end up turning the tables and subverting each other's expectations before the end, and decide for yourself how much you want to interpret literally and how much as metaphor, or as both.",1489276800,3,1338,4.605042016806722

The fact that I can only recall actors' names and not the characters' speaks volumes about the superficiality of this film.

5335153,1,B009H3LNW0,"This is a movie about a writer (Dennis Quaid) talking about a story he wrote about another writer (Bradley Cooper) who wrote another story about a writer (Jeremy Irons) who wrote a story. Give me a break. The whole thing was too much.

On top of that, the positives that people attribute to this movie just aren't there. I was wondering where in heck the good acting was. The Zoe Saladana/Bradley Cooper parts were okay. The Olivia Wilde/Dennis Quaid parts were stilted and awful. More than the acting, I though the problem was with the overbearing dialogue. No one speaks like that! It's seemed so unnatural. Actors can only do so much.

And of course this ends with another pet peeve of mine: just ending the movie without any actual ending. I've seen way too much stuff with this problem lately. Pro-tip for aspiring screen writers and novelists out there: if you have a good idea for a story, but don't know how to end it, you don't have a story yet! Keep working. It's not deep or insightful to just abruptly end...it just lets everyone know you ran out of ideas and/or were too lazy to finish.",1487116800,4,1099,4.545454545454546

5335230,3,B009H3LNW0,"I had high hopes for this movie after reading the reviews, however, it ends too soon and unsatisfactorily.  Good acting, great premise, but I felt a little cheated after investing 1hr 30 mins, to find out there were no repercussions for the actions of the main character, or even an exploration of how he continued to manage life well after his decision .... we are just left hanging.  Did he go on to lead a happy and fulfilled life, what happened to his marriage, did he get found out... nothing.  I'm also left with questions about the character that Denis Quaid played as the author... was he the plagiarist he wrote about?  Too many unanswered questions and the other key character that could have really injected some depth and interest died very conveniently after a couple of obvious ""coughs"".

5335326,4,B009H3LNW0,"Great cast, great acting, mindbending screenplay, engaging to the very end, with twists and turns of inner morality struggles and suffering the consequences of bad decisions.  Interesting though, that Rory failed at achieving his dreams.  If his dreams were only to achieve fame and fortune, then he may have succeeded in settling for that hollow, transient goal.  However, the gut-wrenching morality twist that torments Rory is that his dreams were to be a truly gifted, revered writer - and he knows he failed in that by stealing and plagiarizing the writing gifts and talents of another writer, gifts and talents that Rory had to finally admit to himself that he did not possess.  Therein lies the rub.  Layer on top of that Clay's character, and you have real pretzel-logic.  (The irony is that the screenplay of ""The Words"" film itself achieves literary status.)  (I think Luigi Pirandello, the Italian playwright, wrote mindbending plays based on themes of a story within a story within a story within a story.)",1486166400,5,1017,5.017857142857143

As a writer myself, I can somewhat understand adopting someone else's work for your own (though I would never do it.)  I felt a little sorry him because he did not really do it on purpose, but it was still wrong.  At least he tried to make up for it once he knew the situation.  Kinda liked seeing Mr. Cooper with the very thin Zoe Saldana.  They made a nice pairing.",1485734400,,475,4.164835164835165

The acting form Bradley Cooper and Zoe Saldana was so outrageously stunning, it made it very difficult to take your eyes off the screen. They both generally are very powerful performers, but even the rest of the cast were spectacular and went well with everything else, making this movie a MUST see while leaving you breathless and in awe.

5336420,3,B009H3LNW0,I enjoyed this movie except for the ending. I debated giving it 4 stars but the ending was a little convoluted and confusing. There are 3 different stories and time periods that occur throughout the movie. The story starts with a famous author reading to fans from his latest novel. The movie then becomes about the characters in the novel. Within that novel there is another story  that is acted out with new characters. I cared about all the characters in the novel but when they got to the author and his life I really didn't care about it at this point in the movie. The acting is excellent and Jeremy Irons is perfection as always. It was a nice movie for a rainy day and free on Amazon prime so I recommend it.,1481846400,,716,4.343283582089552

Writers write. It's something they do, not something they are. None of the people involved in the making of this film have any idea what that's like.

Also, I hated every character. I hated the smarmy publisher who maundered on with ""this is a work of ART, so we can't publish it."" That is something that publishers do not say. It is something that narcissistic wannabe writers who pester publishers with their precious garbage IMAGINE publishers say.

I hated the other smarmy publisher who discovered Great Art because it was written by a good-looking white guy.

I hated the women who existed to be beautiful and beloved and to have no inner lives of their own.

I hated the self-absorbed immature men who all believed that writing a clich&eacute;d story in clich&eacute;d language was Great Art.

Most of all, I hated the assumption that Art is a Wondrous Thing which exists apart from a system of context and politics and hard work and learning and growth, but just falls into your lap when the circumstances are right.",1481760000,3,1048,4.762430939226519

Aesthetically gorgeous, perfectly paced, the story is told masterfully and reaches into you, pacing within you inspiration and a heightened appreciation for life. The characters are intriguing and possess a human, real-life quality that brings you close to them, into the story itself. Other reviewers say that this film is really a book in video form, which I didn't fully grasp prior to viewing, but the introspection, the charismatic narrators, and nonlinear narrative are aspects of print literature that shine in ""The Words"".  I can honestly say that I have thought more highly of no other movie.

I would also like to add that something about the title of the film jumped out at me while I was scrolling through the top Prime movies. A simple title, full of promise and mystery. I am extremely happy about how I've spent the past 1.5 hours. I wish I could see this in a cinema, for I know I will return many times over.",1481241600,,943,4.7439024390243905

The characters are likable and relatable but mostly one dimensional for a story about a writer's ability to show truth and depth.  Plus, having three timelines just overcomplicates the plot, though they try to tie them all together at the end... But of course don't actually tie things up leaving the watcher trying to decide if they watched anything that ever mattered at all, or a very lack luster, predictable cliche ending.",1478563200,,645,4.801801801801802

The parts of the movie that included Dennis Quaid were clumsy and i think could have been done much more effectively.

5336679,1,B009H3LNW0,"I thought this would be a "" series story"" in which the old man wrote the clay's story, Rory wrote the old man story and the clay wrote the Rory's story... However, in the end, it turns out that it is only the clay's story, and the structure isn't very logical. Firstly, after old man's children died, he should be very supportive towards his wife, rather than having a fight with her. Second logic problem and the biggest one is that, a writter lost a book? He could always write it again! There was this historical event in ancient China that a writer lost his 500,000 words book and wrote it again. What's more, after the old man find Rory, he should't pour the pain at him, since he already seen his wife who was recovered from the pain.. Last but not least, what is the problem with clay? Is he lost in his character? I think this is very strange way to think...

5336746,4,B009H3LNW0,"This movie is about a writer writing about another writer that has an interaction with another writer, so if you are in the writing business, this might be up your ally. The theme is how hard it is to stay authentic as an artist and make ends meat, but even more so it is about the damage that can be done to your ego when you stray from honesty. It also brings up interesting ideas here and there about the creative process such as how great art may need to come from great emotions, so strong introspection is key. How the 3 stories were intertwined was pretty creative and easy to follow at the same time. I wouldn't say this is a great piece, but it was entertaining with a good story. 3 1/2 stars",1476921600,,701,4.2

It's wonderfully acted, directed, filmed and the music is perfect.  The leads and the supporting cast did an excellent job.  It was fun to see so many familiar faces in the supporting cast.  (There was only one actor that didn't seem to fit but I'll leave that up to you to decide for yourself.)
The plot is complicated and I'm undecided if it should have been made clearer.  As it stands, the movie provokes a lot of discussion and questions at the end.  It would be worth watching a second time to see if we can spot the clues to the story.",1476748800,,667,4.246031746031746

5336979,2,B009H3LNW0,"This movie is one hour and thirty seven minutes long.

I was thoroughly engaged in it and excited by every element of it for one hour and thirty five minutes.

Everything about it was well done. The story is well told. It's interesting. The acting is stellar. It's a great movie! The problem is that it abruptly ends right in the middle of the story.

They make all kinds of implications about what is to come, then suddenly within 2 minutes everything wraps up neatly. Everyone is happy. And the credits roll. Meanwhile I'm left wondering what's going on. I even skipped past the credits to see if it was a trick and the real ending was after the credits.

Dennis Quaid and Olivia Wilde didn't even need to be in the movie. Their roles had zero function from a story telling perspective. Dennis Quaid is the author of a book. The story with Bradley Cooper is the book Dennis Quaid wrote. (This is not a spoiler. You learn this 8 seconds into the movie). The Bradley Cooper story has an element to it that is strongly implied as being part of Dennis Quaid's real life story as well. So it's an interesting premise. But then the movie just ends. There is no resolution of the Dennis Quaid element of the story. And where his role was set up to give the story an amazing twist, he ended up just being a guy who read a book to an audience for an hour and a half.

The whole ending just really irked me. I was thoroughly enjoying this movie and then it just stopped.

It would be like if Dorothy, Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Lion all showed up to meeting the Wizard at Emerald City and the Wizard said ""Oh you want to go back to Kansas? I want to help. Let's see what we can do...."" then the credits roll.",1473638400,71,1697,4.271028037383178

Bradley Cooper of all the actors, to me was so very believable in his role. The only cliche in this movie, is they chose Paris as part of the love story. Paris is used far to often and creatively, this is where the story fails to be more imaginative.  Well done, I enjoyed this movie very much.",1472342400,,453,4.524390243902439

5337343,5,B009H3LNW0,"The Words is a beautifully written and skillfully told love story. But the story is NOT between Bradley Cooper's and Zoe Saldana's characters. Their characters serve more as an interface that gives us access to a back end love story that occurred several years before them, shortly after World War II between a french woman and an american soldier stationed in France. Their love blossomed into a beautiful family with a baby girl whose life was cut short. While the woman took a break in the country's side at her parents' home, the man, left in the city during that dark moment, became inspired to write a manuscript that got lost by his wife before it got even published. Bradley Coopers' character - who was struggling as an author lacking inspiration - stumbled by accident, several years later, upon that manuscript and published it as his own writing. He became famous and successful.

This movie is about choices that we make in our life. How those choices affect those around us and how e live with them. The story is presented to the viewer in a way that make him gasping for air. The viewer can't help asking what will be each character's next move once the truth about the real origin and the real author) of that book is known. Will there be a lawsuit from the real author or will he (the real author) 'be taken care of'? Will Bradley Cooper and Zoe Saldana's couple collapse under the weight of such a heavy truth?

Bradley Cooper and Zoe Saldana captivate the viewer's imagination with their talented acting. The movie director through his skillfull way of presenting the story - adapted photography, breathtaking scenery - easily immerses the viewer in a world where any character's uncontrolled emotions may turn what originally started in France as a beautiful love story, into a nightmare from which no one could come out the same way he/she entered in it.

However, watching this movie it led me to believe...never say never. The chemistry between Bradley Cooper and Zoe Saldana is only rivaled by the chemistry between him and Jennifer Lawrence.

The story is narrated by author Quaid as provides a reading of this story, which he wrote.

5337970,1,B009H3LNW0,"The reviews are WAY off on this one.  This movie is horrible.  It starts interesting, then gets bad, then worse, until by the end it has fallen off the rails worse than a train leaving Philadelphia bound for New York.  (Hey, that was pretty good, wasn't it?  I don't normally talk that way.  The Words has INSPIRED ME!)

The problem with the movie is that it is emotionally wrong from beginning to end.  Every feeling and every decision the characters make rings false, and because of that you dislike every one of them.

SPOILERS:

So, Bradley Cooper finds an old manuscript and decides to publish it under his own name.  He struggles with whether it's a good idea.  The real reason he should be struggling is that he wants to be a writer in his own right, and this book isn't his work.  But the movie apparently thinks it's wrong because it's plagiarism or something?  Anyway he does it and gets super famous and then Jeremy Irons comes and says it's actually his book.  Drams!

So, the first act is fine, this movie is billed as a thriller, so now something good is going to happen, right?  WRONG.  The first 30 minutes are interesting but as soon as Irons arrives it comes screeching to a halt.  For absolutely no reason Irons tells his story about when he was in WWII and wrote the story.  Who cares?  No one.  I think Cooper like us thinks there's going to be a point (at the end of the movie he actually yells at Irons for not having a point) so he listens.  Irons meets a woman in Paris, they fall in love (no reason but that she is hot in the way movies think women are hot.  [Another problem with the movie is that Zoe Saldana (sp?) is super hot and the other two women can't hold a candle to her.])  They have a baby, the baby dies, she leaves him, he's upset and writes the brilliant story.

Now Cooper is upset.  Here is where the movie is so wrong.  Cooper is decent, he never intended to hurt anyone.  But the point is exactly that:  he never INTENDED to hurt Irons.  The obvious assumption is the author is long dead.  This found book will allow Cooper to become a writer.  There is no moral quandary here.

He tells his wife and his agent and they both react wrong.  The wife actually leaves him!!!!!  What a disgusting person she is!!!!!!!!!  That is the single biggest failure of the movie.  Then the agent also is shocked and dismayed by what Cooper did, but there's no reason to be.  In real life the guy would have said, ""can he prove it?  No?  Okay, we're fine don't worry about it.""  But this guy--who made the agent millions of dollars--is disappointed with Cooper.  And Cooper himself is not real.  He's upset that the found novel is better than his own writing.  But he and everyone else already knows that.  The entire point of taking the novel was to allow Cooper to be published.  Bob Balaban had TOLD Cooper that his writing was great but in this day and age he couldn't publish it.  The found novel only allowed Cooper to be published.  He had already been TOLD he was a good writer!

False false false.  NOTHING rings true in this movie.  Not much more of any interest happens.

One weird thing in this movie is that the three female leads are horrible human beings.  The old-timey wife leaves the Irons character because their baby dies.  What kind of cliched movie claptrap is that?  Then Cooper's wife leaves him when she finds out he copied the novel.  WHAT?  And he's happy to have her back?!  The third woman, the one for Dennis Quaid, that part of the story is just pointless.

This movie is REALLY bad.  Started bad, got way way worse.",1458259200,2,3576,4.385911179173047

5338066,4,B009H3LNW0,"This is a very interesting story.  It is so much more about a writer's self-doubt, and the pressure to ""make it"" as a writer.  It could be said of struggles of any artist would have to face.  It's about dealing with one's failures.  It's about being able to face one's own identity in life and being able to accept it, and it is about having to live with consequences of one's choices.  This story does not tell you what's ethical or not.  I don't think that's the point.

The real writer, played by Jeremy Irons, did not demand for any monetary compensation even though his story was stolen.  To him, his life was over anyway.  It did not matter anymore whatever fame or recognition he would get, even though the story being a big success would be a validation of his talent as a writer.

There is no real ending, either.  They don't tell you how or if ever the main character resolves conflicts within himself.  Maybe that's point about life.  Sometimes you don't know if or when some things would get resolved until you have peace about the choices you've made in life.",1457222400,14,1072,4.463917525773196
