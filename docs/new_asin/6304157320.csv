7863526,5,6304157320,"The Ketchup Vampires 2 was among my favorite films as a child. and today i still enjoy watching it. However, i think that this movie should have been the first and the first should have been the second as the plot pre-dates the plot in the first film. The movie is great for kids of all ages- even little kids won't be scared of the movie (unless you've got sissy kids- then i can't gurentee anything)- in fact, i watched this movie with my nieces and nephews who are between the ages of 3 to 5 and they all enjoyed it and it kept their attention. This film like the first is narrated by Elvira.",1273017600,,595,4.182608695652174
7863527,5,6304157320,"As a kid I probably rented this thing atleast 20 times. Now I've finally buy it 10 years later and it's... well its not as great as I remember, but its still pretty good. The dailog is a little weird and the acting is a little over the top and there is this one character that is so annoying it makes me want to break my tv screen... but your kids probably won't care. And after all, it is a pretty cute kid movie.",1139788800,3,414,3.9404761904761907
