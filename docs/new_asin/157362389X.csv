193652,2,157362389X,"MEET WALLY SPARKS, a disappointing comedy, features an excellent performance from David Ogden Stiers, playing a decent politician whose life is turned upsidedown by a trash talk show host (Rodney).  Stiers makes you  care about what's happening to him, a good family man who didn't ask for  trouble.  The rest of MEET WALLY SPARKS is leagues below the level of  Stier's performance; it's as if the actor's part was edited in from a  different film.  As for Rodney, he delivers a number of funny one-liners,  but that number isn't high enough to make MEET WALLY SPARKS memorable.",922233600,,578,4.88659793814433

193817,5,157362389X,"I guess if anybody else attempted the same ridiculous gags, they might be insulting, but Dangerfield is truly a comedian, as much as he is a comic.  It's so important from time to time, to forget the cerebral and the allegorical, and instead, just cut loose, and laugh like an idiot.  As an example, the gig with the three (older) gals playing bridge, then suddenly (after a Rodney brings a few fifths over), they're doing choreography in their bras/panties, had me laughing like an idiot.  And then, when the Governor walks in and sees them face down in the gutter drunk and in only their underwear, including his wife Emily (Williams), and Rodney says something to the effect of ""Hey Governor, you can take her upstairs now, she's ready!""; even my wife (who isn't a Dangerfield fan by any means), laughed out loud.  There's a lot of those moments. I never even liked Cindy Williams before this movie, now I love her!  Only Rodney could paint such great pictures.
Finally, I heartily agree with a previous review I read here on Amazon about this picture where he stated (paraphrasing), ""It's too bad Rodney's not still with us to do more hilarious light-hearted stuff for us"".  Ain't it the truth.

Monty Wolley plays Sheridan Whiteside, the gruff, bossy, have-it-my-way guest, who disrupts the lives of his host family and several others.

193823,4,157362389X,"Crude. Crass. Lowbrow. These words describe both the film & its title character. A real life fan of shows like ""Jerry Springer"", ""Meet Wally Sparks"" was obviously subject matter Rodney Dangerfield was anxious to base a comedy on. Just by watching the outrageously insane montage of the opening credits, you know immediately that this is not a ""sophisticated"" comedy...what would you expect from mining humor from the crazy world of ""tabloid"" talk shows, in which anything can--and usually does--happen? Rodney is, of course, obnoxious T.V. personality Wally Sparks, who is pressured by network top brass (Burt Reynolds) to ""clean up his act or else"". In desperation, he tries to arrange an interview with a distinguished Southern Governor (David Ogden Stiers, who was doing his share of silly comedies around that time with ""Doc Hollywood"" & ""Jungle 2 Jungle""), who despises Sparks. Through plot twists--and Sparks' own deception--Sparks becomes an almost permanent houseguest, systematically wrecking the mansion & pushing the flustered Governor to his limits. Then Sparks stumbles upon a scandal which could destroy the Governor's career & personal life. Amidst all the loud craziness is a genteel message: Which is more important--your career or your children?
The film is chock full of cameos from all kinds of celebrities. Debbie Mazar is wily & typically bewitching as Sparks' assistant, who becomes his devil's advocate. Cindy Williams has some amusing moments as the Governor's somewhat dippy wife. Reynolds, unfortunately, doesn't have enough screen time to make an impact. Some of the comedy is heavyhanded & obvious: Sparks accidentally emasculating a male statue; Sparks ""loosening up"" Williams & her bridge-playing partners with Long Island Iced-teas; and Reynolds' bumbling network assistant trying--and failing--to expose Sparks' shenanigans, most of his attempts looking like a poor man's Inspector Clouseau. Most of the time, the film tries to get laughs from having a room full of people run around & scream. What you can rely on is Rodney himself. He tosses out some pretty good--and racy R-rated--one-liners like the pro he is. He seems to be having much fun during the surrounding chaos. Certainly, MWS is not Rodney's best, but not his worst either. If you want crude belly laughs in the tradition of ""Caddyshack"" or ""Easy Money"", then this one's for you.",1252368000,,2377,5.324468085106383
193824,5,157362389X,"In my humble opinion, an excellent off-the-wall outrageously funny movie about an all-too zany talk show host Wally Sparks (Rodney Dangerfield). One thing I liked about this flick was that every character had their share of good lines. Things go nuts when Sparks rides into the Governor's mansion riding a horse - then gets injured, having to recover in a guest room at the mansion. Then, everything really gets out of hand when the 'Wally Sparks Show' gets broadcasted from the mansion as the whole place gets transformed into a media circus. Couple of the others that have a vital role that show up here are Wally's sexy assistant Sandy Gallo (Debi Mazar), Governor Floyd Preston (David Ogden Stiers) - his wife Emily (Cindy Williams, still cute after all these years following Laverne & Shirley) and the deceiving porn actress Lola Laura (Cindy Ambuehl). Mama-mia! They rarely come along any hotter than this one. Highly recommended.",1223164800,,936,5.006410256410256

I'm hoping to put up a website with a picture of this tree soon so keep your eyes peeled.
Also, be warned: this DVD is in the overrated widescreen format.  I was one of the very few supporters of the tallscreen format that enjoyed a mild popularity in mid-late April 1996 (only 3 films were shot in this unusual aspect ratio-""The Tall Guy,"" ""Tall Marge,"" and ""Big & Tall"").  Needless to say, on my Tall-Screen Television set (60 inches high by 5 inches wide), I have to put up with enormous black bars at the top and bottom of the screen.
