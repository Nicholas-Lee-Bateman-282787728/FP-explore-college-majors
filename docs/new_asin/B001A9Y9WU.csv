8276498,5,B001A9Y9WU,"This film really explained what the difference is between one kind of water and another -- and why you should be drinking structured water.  I have been watching The Genie Show for almost a year, and she always has interesting guests.  This film explains why you can be drinking lots of water and still be dehydrated if you aren't drinking the right type of water for your body.  Healing Water explains that water is not all equal, and when you get the right kind of water, everything begins to work right inside your body.  I highly recomend this film to anyone who is wondering what kind of water is best for themselves and their family.  It also has the right GREEN message, in helping people get off their dependency on bottled waters.",1213833600,2,739,4.568181818181818
8276499,5,B001A9Y9WU,"I have been educating myself and researching the many modalities to water purification / enhancement that we have available to us. I like this idea, it makes sense. I would like to try this water and see for myself. I've seen some YouTube videos about the MRET water and its use.
Dr Marc Melton is an expert in that he has used MRET water to clinically
document his clients' results.
The information contained in this interview can be backed up with documentation and follow the dots to the science.
Sounds like the previous reviewer has a personal axe to grind.
Looks like I'm still on my journey of discovery and enjoying every minute of it. Be Well with whatever you decide.",1212364800,3,677,4.603305785123967
8276500,3,B001A9Y9WU,"This is basically a disguised infomercial for the BioPro iWater device. Lots of claims, some based on science, some based on pseudoscience, which lead to the conclusion that tap water, and bottled water, is deleterious to your health and that you should be drinking ""structured water,"" as is produced by the iWater device (or, as it is marketed, the i-H2O). BioPro is a multi-level marketing company, most famous for its ""EMF harmonizing chips"" which are little knickel-sized stickers (at around $30 each) which you put on all your EMF emitting devices (cell phone, microwave oven, computer, LCD clock radio, etc.) in order to cancel their harmful EMF waves. A little searching on the web will find you many debunkers of BioPro products who claim it's all snake-oil. You should research and come up with your own opinion. This movie may be useful to give you a better sense of some of the complexities in water, but beware, its main purpose is to point you in the direction of the iWater device, which you can buy at a BioPro representative's Tupperware-like party for as little as $950. Genie Joseph is one of those BioPro representatives. Marc Melton's official credentials are never stated, so I'm guessing he doesn't have any. He's just referred to as an ""expert."" Who is he? The regional rep for Biopro, maybe? Who knows? Like many infomercials, this ""film"" actually has the appearance of simply being an interview of a guest on someone's regular television show (in this case, episode 33 of the Genie show). Believe what you will. I find no record of such a show. I think I remember reading that Ted Turner once said, that if he had his life to do all over again, he would go straight into multi-level marketing instead because that's where the money's to be made.",1212364800,14,1770,4.787581699346405
