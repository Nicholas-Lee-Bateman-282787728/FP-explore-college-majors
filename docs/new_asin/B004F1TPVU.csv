8427711,4,B004F1TPVU,"We enjoyed this, not because it is great drama, but because John Thaw did such a good acting job, and thus made it into very good drama.  Without him, I think that it would have been a flop",1407369600,,189,3.973684210526316
8427712,5,B004F1TPVU,"This set encompasses many venues: wars past and current, diplomacy, medicine, family. All informative and entertaining. Difficult to put down.",1397779200,2,142,6.15
8427713,5,B004F1TPVU,"Perhaps my favorite episode is ""Ancient History"" where Kavanagh is a prosecuting attorney in a war crimes trial about a Polish immigrant doctor who is accused of conducting medical experiments on Jewish inmates of a concentration camp.  His skillful questioning of a mentally fragile Jewish woman reveals the truth and the doctor finally admits his role in Nazi atrocities with a chilling recital of how such ""medical experiments"" were necessary.  Kavanagh's son finds Nazi war crimes gripping and aids his father with intensive online research.",1384819200,2,545,5.4
