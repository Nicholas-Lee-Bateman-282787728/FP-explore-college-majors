2053337,4,B00020VZVG,"Amid the entertainment super-stars of the twentieth century--Carol Channing, Lauren Bacall, Joan Collins, Barbara Walters, and more--the white-bearded, bright-eyed Al Hirschfeld cuts a humorous and humble figure.  This visual historian doesn't make the stars beautiful in his drawings; he makes them interesting.  ESP-like, the line of Hirschfeld's pen reveals an essential and vital character within each of the performers he draws, capturing the rare exuberance with amazing specificity: the gestures, the movements, the facial expressions-all become playfully recognizable as the spirit manifest.  What the documentary does especially well is show Hirschfeld at work, and talking about the work.  He was 90 years old when interviewed in the film, but seems almost childlike in his delight for his life-long passion.  Hirschfeld emerges as the century's most beloved cartoonist, truly earning him the title of The Line King.",1111449600,8,926,5.779411764705882
2053338,5,B00020VZVG,"It's not often I write ""thank God someone made this"" in my notes while reviewing a film. But Susan Dryfoos' ""The Line King - The Al Hirschfeld Story"" deserves such praise and more.

A lovely biography of entertainment caricaturist Hirschfeld, this film is a fascinating look behind the pen of a man who transcended his genre to become almost an art form unto himself.

Dryfoos thankfully showcases hundreds of drawings throughout the film as entertainers, artists and others discuss a man who described his goal as not to make a subject beautiful, but interesting.

Hirschfeld, of course, being the most interesting character of all. The camouflaged ""Nina""s, the barber chair in which he created decades of work, the almost Santa Claus-ish look of the artist - all add up to a man that, if he were imagined by a Hollywood writer, would be deemed wholly unbelievable by cartoonists such as myself.

Myself being a stay-at-home-dad, I was fascinated to learn that he was raised by his father while his mother supported the family. I also connected with his respect for his wife's editorial abilities. My wife is often consulted (OK, harangued) about my latest cartoons and her advice is always spot on, even when I don't like to admit it.

There are a few goofy moments, Hirschfeld's surreal bongo solo and his attempts as using a computer and graphics tablet, but overall the film is a wonder from beginning to end. A fitting tribute to an artist whose work was both interesting and beautiful.",1096675200,15,1492,4.858267716535433

8019755,5,B00020VZVG,"Al Hirschfeld (1903-2003) was the caricaturist for the New York Times Sunday Arts and Leisure section who made the Broadway theater come to life with his brilliant line drawings of actors and actresses. In the DVD ""The Line King"" (1996) we are given a beautiful documentary that shows the evolution of this great artist. He traveled a great deal in his lifetime and spent long periods in Russia, Bali, Tahiti, Japan, and other places. As he grew older the lines in his drawings became simpler, leaner, more minimalist, and more refined, as if he discarded everything but the purest and most essential lines to capture the true essence of his subjects. It was amazing how accurately in a few lines he caught the essence of a celebrity.
Over his lifetime he worked in many modes and types of art but whatever art he created showed his talents and genius. He spent long hours each day in his studio trying to get things exactly right. He was a perfectionist whose precision showed. He worked in an old barber chair in his studio, and until her death, his wife was his constant loving companion.
 He immortalized his daughter Nina. Remember looking at his pictures trying to find the Ninas he had noted numerically were contained in each drawing? He had an amazing career and worked for a number of employers including stints as art directors at movie studios, before ending up at The Times. He was an even-tempered, humorous man who loved the theater and was often seen there.
 The film shows many of his drawings, and I was amazed to find how much of my own Broadway theatergoing was relived in those sketches. Various celebrities are interviewed, and we see drawings to match them. Commentators talk of his frolic of line, his effortless grace and wit, and how he captured the adrenaline of actors in his drawings.
 He would sit in the middle of an empty theater, watch rehearsals and make his drawings. At performances he would even have a pencil and paper in his pocket to jot down things tactilely in the dark.
 His work is sorely missed because in the old days, often it was his drawings that drew audiences to the plays. About living, he said, ""You make it up as you go along.""",1301788800,,2181,4.642487046632124
8019756,3,B00020VZVG,"This is a wonderfull DVD account of one of the entertainment industry's most gifted artists. For someone like me who, as a child thought I could draw a bit , this man is an absolute genius. The lightness of touch in capturing the very essence of the theatre and film personalities is a wonder to behold. He nails their personalities with every stroke of his pen, and the accompanying background interviews and film clips makes for a very entertaining programme, and a must for any serious theatre buff. Highly recommended . Garry Stewart, Melbourne, Australia .",1290816000,,561,4.854166666666667
8019757,5,B00020VZVG,"This is a documentary I would watch over and over again.  It has so much in it, that each time I watch it I see something else.  It covers each decade and this man is such a joy to watch.  Highly recommended.",1277942400,,208,3.9047619047619047
8019758,5,B00020VZVG,"Those of you who missed growing up looking at Al Hirschfeld's drawings in the NY Times and counting the 'Nina's missed a lot.  He was a superb artist who could capture a performer's likeness and entertain you at the same time.  To watch the DVD, The Line King, adds depth to his legend.  Not merely an artist, he was a character, a corker, a real piece of work.  He makes our current crop of political cartoonists look like also-rans.  If you're interested in art or the stage, your library is not complete without one of the books of his drawings.  The DVD is frosting on the cake.",1265155200,,582,4.392523364485982
8019759,5,B00020VZVG,"If one enjoys drawing, art, or interesting people, this is one great DVD.  I have appreciated his work for many years but never realized what a truly interesting individual he was.  This is highly entertaining and inspires me to do more with my feeble efforts at artwork.  I just regret that I did not get it earlier.",1260230400,,317,4.526315789473684
8019760,5,B00020VZVG,"A very good documentary on one of the best American 20th century portrait illustrators.

Aside from being an artist, I miss Al's Sunday New York Times weekly theatre illustration, within which were hidden the name of his daughter,
""NINA"", and the number of the ""NINA's"" in the line drawing entered by his signature.

The 5 stars are for all of us who grabbed Section 2 on Sunday morning, (or Saturday night),
and begun reading the Sunday Times by searching for the NINA's. If you first read the headlines, minus perhaps .5 stars, the most.
If you grew up with the ""NINA's"", you will enjoy this documentary.
An excellent supplement provided is a follow up of the artist several years after this documentary was made.

If you had no idea what a ""NINA"" was when you first begun reading this review, but have interest in line drawings, illustrations, accomplished illustrators, etc...
I would say it is a recommended 4 star diverting documentary.",1260144000,,942,4.838509316770186
8019761,5,B00020VZVG,"Mr Hirschfeld is one of the inspirations for my work, this documentary tells the story of his life, loves, influences, and subjects.  The history of theater and entertainment in New York City through most of the twentieth century are there too. For me, the close-ups of him working illustrate the real effort in producing those elegant simple lines.  A long, creative and productive life.  Bravo.
