6898664,5,B00R4JLIKQ,"Great, easy, but effective workouts.  The 10 minute full body bonus workout is perfect when you are short on time - it stretches and energizes you!",1477612800,,147,4.653846153846154
6898665,4,B00R4JLIKQ,"Eddie isn't really a big part of this. He doesn't instruct or lead, merely does yoga along with you, as lead by an instructor. Not bad.",1437696000,3,135,4.230769230769231
6898666,5,B00R4JLIKQ,"I'm really enjoying this. These videos can stand alone or be a whole hour and twenty minute workout. I've been doing yoga since 1996 and I teach as well but I enjoy following along with an instructor digitally when I can. These classes aren't difficult- many are basic flows and are geared, I think, to people and athletes who have minimal yoga experience. I have a lot of yoga experience and I like it! I would classify these as a vinyasa style- there are many flows in the sequences. I like that I can watch along on my amazon app- I think I'm going to get the others!",1431993600,3,570,4.287037037037037
8694043,2,B00R4JLIKQ,"Inspirational that a pro-athlete is doing Yoga, however I wanted to hear more from Eddie George.  Too many words of encouragement from instructor and not enough verbal instruction.  OK if you can look at screen while doing the moves.",1528502400,,233,4.948717948717949
8694044,5,B00R4JLIKQ,This is exactly what I've been looking for in a morning and post workout yoga routine.,1525564800,,86,4.4375
8694045,5,B00R4JLIKQ,"I love this entire series.  My favorite yoga.  No spirituality, just great exercise.",1520035200,,84,5.384615384615385
8694046,5,B00R4JLIKQ,"The Gaiam yoga for athletes series is fantastic! Only 20 minutes a workout, I don't feel like the Tin Woman anymore and look forward to a gentle day. It would be a good idea to know some of the basic yoga moves like downward dog, cobra, warriors, and triangle. Kent's voice and instruction are soothing and clear. And I love all the athletes! I've been doing these almost daily for 6 months and am over 55. I often modify the pose, so as not to injure myself. Highly recommended!",1518566400,,479,4.393258426966292
8694047,5,B00R4JLIKQ,This video is a hit with me and my son. We are able to do these exercises together and have fun doing them. The fact that it is a professional athlete doing the exercises helps my son to want to do it more often. All blocks of exercises are basically 20 minutes which is rather easy to do morning or night. It provides a good workout in a short time.,1515801600,,350,4.014285714285714
8694048,5,B00R4JLIKQ,Great flexibility routine; I also have the dvd's with Kevin Love and Jermaine Jones.  They seem a bit more geared to athletes than a typical yoga dvd--exactly what I'd been looking for.  Hope they put out some more!,1512518400,,215,4.631578947368421
8694049,5,B00R4JLIKQ,Arrived on time and is great for travel and at home exercise.,1508284800,,61,4.166666666666667
8694050,4,B00R4JLIKQ,"Good program, would help a beginner loosen up and gain mobility.",1498608000,,64,4.909090909090909
8694051,5,B00R4JLIKQ,"So I started doing yoga to help my running. I love yoga classes, but they can get $$ and the times offered aren't always a good fit in my schedule. I bought 4 of these Giam Athletic Yoga DVDs and I am very happy that I did. I admit it can be hard to get yourself motivated to use them, at least with a class you have to be there and if you paid you don't want to waste that money. So sometimes I do struggle with using these regularly enough. It has helped having spent 2 years going to yoga classes to have a better understanding of what they are doing in the video, bc I feel at some points they go a little fast. I haven't quite gone through EVERY single sequence on all DVDs yet, but I do feel there is a bit more overlap than I would prefer, I would want more unique sequences so I don't feel I'm doing the EXACT same routine every time. But overall, these are fantastic and I recommend  them!",1496620800,2,898,4.016759776536313
8694052,5,B00R4JLIKQ,Great workout dvd. My husband and I both enjoy this. I like mixing the 20 minute workouts up for variety.,1485648000,,105,4.3
