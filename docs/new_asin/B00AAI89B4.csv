8549174,5,B00AAI89B4,"A wonderful disc of Sara's easy style of teaching yoga. Short workouts, or you do several at once. Very good for those busy days when you have just a few minutes to practice yoga.",1490227200,,179,4.294117647058823
8549175,5,B00AAI89B4,"I purchased this for two reasons-I am a fan of Sara Ivanhoe's ""Yoga on the Edge"", one of my favorite yoga dvds and because my hubby wants to try to integrate yoga into his more athletic lifestyle and get the benefits from the stretching and peace/centering that yoga brings.  He is not one to want to do an hour of yoga though so I have found that short practices were a better bet.  This is just the ticket because each session is about 5 minutes long.  There are also 3 sessions at the end that integrate a few of the sessions together to make a longer sequence. Here's a run-down of each:

Wake-Sun salutations to get the blood flowing and to get you limbered up for your day and breathing deeply.

Shed-Down dog, crescent and plank positions

Burn-Chair pose, standing forward bends, warrior 2

Cleanse-spinal twists (sitting, prayer twist in a lunge & squat with a twist)

Firm-plank pose, side plank, sphinx, child's pose

Core-Boat pose, lying on back doing a scissor movement with legs, slow bicycle

Work-Arms for the Eagle pose, sitting twists shoulder rolls, done while seated on a chair

Tail-Cat Breath, hand and knees balancing poses (arm out in front of you with opposite leg out and same brought to the side of you)

Chill-Deep relaxing breaths, child's pose and threading the needle, shavasana

Sleep-Soles of feet together, knees to the side with deep cleansing breaths, spine twist while lying with one leg straight and one bent, shavasana (corpse pose)

The longer programs are a combination of the following:

Slim-a combination of wake, shed & burn
Strength- a combo of firm, burn & cleanse
Rest-a combo of chill & sleep, a perfect way to end your day before heading to sleep!

I would recommend this for practitioners of all levels, they are short programs to help introduce you to the benefits of yoga and are for those who already practice and can only fit in a little bit of yoga into their day.  I love this because I do many forms of exercise and with the short programs I can now add in a little yoga every day if I like.

Once again Sara provides calming narration, a beautiful and peaceful set and appropriately soft music (singing and also some chanting).

If you are looking for three longer programs at the intermediate level I also would highly recommend ""Yoga on the Edge"".

Enjoy your practice!",1370044800,,2331,4.666666666666667
8549176,5,B00AAI89B4,"I have been using Sara's DVDs for the past 5 years. I have found this one particularly refreshing in that it addresses the needs for those times when we have other obligations that often detour from our practice. You may click on the each of the 4 to 5 minute segments individually or use them in a full session of sequences. Her genuine dedication to the philosophy within yoga comes through clearly with her asana practice. I continue to alternate with Sara's DVD's to continue keeping my practice fresh and renewed. I highly recommend that you obtain your copy so that you may enjoy it as much as I do. If you enjoyed ""Yoga on the Edge,"" you will certainly love this DVD as well. Namaste - Steve Goodwin",1361923200,3,706,4.48062015503876
8549177,5,B00AAI89B4,"This is a very serene practice with ten short ""tastes"" which can be selected individually or organized under 3 programs.

Slim:
Wake (4:51)
Shed  (9:51)
Burn  (14:41)

Strength:
Firm (4:06)
Core (8:57)
Cleanse (13:45)

Rest:
Chill (5:59)
Sleep (11:51)

Individual only:
Work (3:47) - chair poses, by which I mean you'll need a chair.  This would be good at work for those lucky few of us who get to sit behind a desk all day.
Tail (5:05)

If you are looking for something more athletic, you would be better matched with Sara's Body Makeover series or her
or her Yoga on the edge, which are filmed in the ultimate beautiful locations of Maui and the Bahamas.

If you don't have time for a full workout in the morning, or need something to relax after a hectic day, then this DVD might just suit your taste.  Guided by the soothing voice over from your teacher, who has published articles on yoga practices for sleep, this might just do the trick to unwind the body and mind to prepare for a good night's sleep.",1360972800,3,1009,4.4945054945054945
