8289251,3,B001CU5PIO,"This DVD is one of the History Channel's ""Automobiles"" series which are usually pretty good.

This is a good video - but not of the E-Type. The video is a history of Jaguar automobiles (including their LeMans racing cars) from the company's founding until the early 1970's. As such it does a very good job.

The video chronicles Jaguar from its beginnings as a maker of motorcycle sidecars to a maker of excellent British sports cars. Many models are highlighted by this video and the E-Type is just one of many shown. It does show the development of the E-Type and its modifications as time went on.

The problem for me, as a buyer of this video, is that it's not what I thought I was getting. What I got was not ""as advertised"". The E-Type only gets about 15 minutes of a 50 minute video.

For that reason, I give this DVD only three stars. If you are looking for a history of Jaguar as a maker of automobiles and their racing heritage, it would get one more star.",1309046400,4,966,4.35
