8387488,5,B0032GV4H2,"What can you say about Guy.  Everything that he does is incredible.  I can watch his shows over and over again.  He makes food for guys who watch his shows, so you know that the plate will always be full.  The way that he presents his finished dishes appeals to both women and men as well in order to keep their attention and keep them entertained.  So far I have bought everything that this ""GUY"" has put out and I can say that I have never been disappointed.  I can actually say that I met him on his road show and the way that he is on his shows is exactly how he is in real life.  It is refreshing to see this, because it can help you relate even more to him.  Hopefully more seasons of Big Bite and Triple ""D"", come out on DVD, but until then keep watching his shows and help him have continued success.",1335052800,,808,4.037735849056604

I would like to start off and say that I have been waiting YEARS for a DVD set to come out. Guy is one of the best chefs that will create the best sounding food ever. I have been a avid fan of his show since it has been on the air. Guy has a real good way of explaining what he does and why he does it.

Product-

DvD comes in a single DVD case with 3 discs inside. There is nothing fancy here but I an one who could care less about useless goodies that they usually include. Show looks great on my upconverting blu-ray player that my mouth waters.

Thank you Amazon and Food Network for bringing us this product that I will enjoy for a long time!",1294012800,3,685,3.978102189781022
