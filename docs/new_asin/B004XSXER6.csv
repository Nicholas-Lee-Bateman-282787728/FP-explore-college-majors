8447425,1,B004XSXER6,"I recieved the DVD case cracked, Also it was missing one of the 4 Dvds that should have been included. I tried to communicate with the seller and through amazon. But I missed the time allowed to argue this case. So I guess I can only write about it here. Over all I just wanted to see if I could get the missing Dvd. I wasn't asking for a refund initially but I feel as if I got cheated on this purchase. This is the first really bad purchase I have ever made on amazon.",1380067200,2,470,3.957894736842105
