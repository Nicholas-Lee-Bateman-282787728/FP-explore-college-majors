8034625,3,B0002Y69UY,I am a Corvette Buff..So.. of course Some of the footage there was already available from a VHS i have called Corvette 1988.. that vhs had some mistakes as well..and so does this dvd. The only update being a different announcer and some facts left out. and of course the C5. (its up to 1998) Its also basically the same America's Favorite Sports Car VHS 1998 Corvette(RED COVER). Nonetheless.. Cheap and Ok Dvd.,1233100800,3,411,4.6438356164383565
8034626,2,B0002Y69UY,"This video is about 50 minutes long.  The first 5 minutes cover the history of the automobile before covering the Corvette.  It does not go too deeply into detail on any of the models, and some of the information presented is wrong.  For example, when covering the C4 corvette, it talks about how an auto club in France loves the Corvette and they have a 1983 that they drive around.  The only 1983 in existence is in a museum in Bowling Green.  Then, it talks about the custom paint job on a 1982, when the car is obviously a C4.  Because of these errors, I questioned all of the information presented.  They seem to stray away from the subject and then back onto it.  It's worth a few bucks, but no more...",1208822400,4,708,4.3106060606060606
