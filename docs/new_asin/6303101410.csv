558549,5,6303101410,"As a recovering alcoholic myself, I find this movie an accurate and moving portrayal on the life of Bill Wilson and the early history of Alcoholics Anonymous.  James Woods is always a marvelous actor, but here he delivers a tour de force performance as Bill Wilson.  Also in the cast is the ever-delightful JoBeth Williams of Big Chill fame.  James Garner plays Dr. Bob Smith, who, along with Bill, founded A. A. in 1935.  Garner also co-produced the project.  This was originally aired on television as a Hallmark Hall Of Fame movie in 1989.  Very inspiring!",1033257600,69,559,4.770833333333333
558550,5,6303101410,I have watched this movie at least 6 times and never tire of it. As a recovering alcoholic it could be me in that movie and it makes me remember what it was like. I am also a proud member of AA and Thank God for Bill W. !!,1011916800,17,222,3.5510204081632653
558551,5,6303101410,"An excellent depiction of the true insanity and ultimate recovery from alcoholism. I really enjoyed watching this film a few years ago in early sobriety and can't wait to see it again and again. James Woods does a great  job at depicting the hopeless and helpless alcoholic which many of us  became. His rise from the depths of hell is not to be forgotten. 12-stepers  will never forget the ""Keep it simple"" phrase which Dr. Bob gives  to Bill on his death bed.",964224000,13,461,4.518072289156627
558552,5,6303101410,"This movie is about the history of Bill Wilson, co-founder of A.A. (Alcoholics Anonymous). It is a wonderful story of how Bill and Dr. Robert Smith (Dr. Bob) met and started the fellowship that has kept millions of  people sober around the world. The story also gives as a look at Bills  experience, strength, and hope. This story will diclose in a general way,  what he used to be like, what happened, and what he is like now. His wife  Lois is also featured in this movie. My Name is Bill W. is a film that you  will be sure to remember for the rest of your life!!!",923270400,36,567,4.212962962962963
558553,5,6303101410,The movie helps people understand the disease of alcoholism and how great the pull is to allow the person is affected to believe they are okay. Also it shows the affects on the family. Being a spouse of an alcoholic I  understand what exactly Lois went through with her husband. I finally was  able to be more helpful to my husband after I saw the movie.,916444800,9,354,4.348484848484849

He got so bad that years later they had to create a squad of men that kept him from going after the new younger women. This film makes him look like a saint.

558960,1,6303101410,"Watch ""The Thirteenth Step"" instead. That film was closer to what I experienced as teen forced into AA and treatment by my pot smoking parents after I snagged a little too much from their stash. There was a 40 year old ""councillor"" and ""sponsor"" at that facility that would take every male under the age of 20 to his office for a private discussion about the possibility that the reason we were ""using"" was that we were ""closeted."" He was always there and ready to help out us younger addicts. He was such a prince of a guy. AA = platitudes and pedophiles.",1500508800,,556,4.407766990291262

559292,5,6303101410,"This movie is an EXCELLENT movie, that shows how AA originally started. It shows the history of how it all began  back in the 1930's. It is actually very compelling, bu showing the seemingly ""innocent"" drinking"" and how social drinking, for some people may turn into a full blown addiction, alcoholism. It shows how seriously the person who is alcoholic can be in denial, as well as their loved ones, who think their family or friend ""can't really be an alcoholic, those are people living under a bridge, uneducated, or homeless"" type of myths. It accurately describes the ""disease concept"" of alcoholism, and shows how people with severe alcoholism can get help from AA, and how well it works, It shows the growth of popularity in AA, as it has evolved and spread to be an International phenomenon, with excellent results for those who put their  heart into following the ""12 Steps"" of recovery. It also introduces the concept of how ""Al anon"" came  to be in existence. This is a very touching story, very well done, compelling.  I have used it many years as a tool to teach clients and family members in rehabilitation centers, and it helped them really get a grasp on what they were felling and how to get help. It also does a great Job of reducing the ""stigma"" surrounding alcoholism, and may make it easier for people considering to get help, to actually try going to a meeting!",1482796800,7,1383,4.655737704918033

The disease of alcoholism is harmful and deadly; this is the story of the two men who started Alcoholics Anonymous in 1935.  But the movie starts before then, when Bill Wilson was still drinking.  At first, he drank like most everyone else.  But in the throes of his success as a stockbroker, he started drinking more, and it soon became apparent he drank more than the average person at each occasion.  His adventures in drinking are well portrayed, as is (the important part!) his story of recovery.  Thank God for Bill and Dr. Bob; frankly, they've saved millions of alcoholics around the world not just from death, but from worse -- living in hell.",1472688000,5,793,4.661870503597123

My disappointment with the DVD is technical -- specifically, the audio for the movie is terrible.  This should have been corrected when it was put on DVD.  The dialogue is too soft to hear, so I cranked up the volume, and then had to immediately turn it down anytime the music started because it was significantly louder than the dialogue.  I then checked the ""language"" settings to turn on the captioning - but there is no captioning for the deaf & hard of hearing, only French & Spanish.  I only watched about 5 minutes of the movie because of the audio problems.  I'm sure there are settings on my TV to adjust for this type of problem; but, I had planned to show it to my high school Health class during our drug & alcohol unit, and I would not have been able to adjust the audio settings in the classroom.

560889,5,6303101410,"This is an excellent movie primarily about Bill W. one of the two co-founders of Alcoholics Anonymous. In the opening scene Dr. Bob, the other fonder of AA is on his death bed and one of them remarks to the other 'look how much our lives have changed because we just don't drink ...no matter what.' Another remarks 'keep it simple,' and 'one day at a time.'

The next scene is of a young Bill W. fresh home from WWII a decorated combat veteran of the great war. He is in a bar and celebrating having survived. A commissioned officer, probably a college graduate, he remarks in the bar flushed with victory...[the war]...'was the first thing I was really good at.'

Bill W. goes into the business world after the war.

He quickly develops a big ego.

He quickly looses sight of the fact that a career in business is really just a better ends to caring for and providing for himself and his new bride.

His drinking and womanizing have a ruinous effect on his life and that of his bride. She miscarries and he may have even given her an STD which results in her having an operation on her reproductive organs that forever leaves her barren.

Despite this Bill W. goes onto continue to drink despite promises to the contrary. He continue to engage in underhanded business practices, where he trades on loyalties placed in him by his employers apparently trading or even selling insider information to competitors.

He continues to drink to excess and gamble on stocks like a craps or roulette player chasing a rush.

Both drinking and gambling are addictions as is now known that are controlled by a part of the brain named the ventromedial. Alcoholics and addicts have damaged vetromedials. Bill W. who was both almost certainly had a damaged ventromedial in my opinion. What is ironic to some extent is that I personally believe that those with damaged ventromedials or ones that are vulnerable to being damaged may give some people like Bill an incredible capacity for risking not just with drink or money but possibly even with their own lives in physical combat on the battlefield. That latter part is just a personal opinion and is partly born  out in this movie by the fact that Bill W. was a combat decorated dough boy who once risked his very life to save a friend.

Bill W. by the time he was 34 was a full blown alcoholic. He continued his marriage infidelities despite being married to a wonderful women who had a tremendous capacity to forgive him. In his busines dealings he continued to shoot every angle possible knowingly violating the spirit of business laws while not maybe the letters themselves. In short his drinking had led him to become a pretty terrible person.

By the crash of 1929' Bill was a total hustler. A complete operator solely out for himself. He was completely selfish; the hallmark of an addict or alcoholic. in every aspect of his life. He had by 1929 made $500,000. dollars a veritable kings ransom.

In the 29' crash do to his selfishness, alcoholism and gamblers mentality he loses everything and is reduced to being a drunken hobo.

But there is hope. He is married to a wonderful women who despite everything he did to himself and he; she can still see the good in him. The good man she married.

He is such a desperate man, such a desperate alcoholic that he is a frequent flyer at mental wards trying to sober up...literally losing his mind do to alcohol induced psychosis. He begins to admit to underlying personality defects, such as social awkwardness, low self esteem. And that they were temporarily washed away by alcohol...temporarily...this is the beginning of both introspection for Bill and maybe just maybe the beginning of recovery.

He has hit bottom.

He is visited by an old life long friend. Bill is still drinking. He asks the friend 'how long have you been sober?'
'4 months' responds the friend.
'whats you're secret ?' inquires Bill
'I got religion' responds the friend who at that time was going to a group known as the Oxford Group. Which was founded by a Christian missionary named Dr. frank Buchman out which grew some of AA's founding principles.

Bill continues to drink. He is sardonically opposed to the notion of God, or even spirituality. He makes numerous trips to mental wards due to his alcoholism; including being placed in restraints.

Finally, at his last mental ward Bill W. has a spiritual awakening. It is after which as if he were given a new lease on life. Personally, I have a theory about finding spirituality or God. I had years ago partly read a book that states that there is a part of the brain that is sometimes referred to as the 'God helmet,' some believe as do I that it is the part of the brain that controls or God gave us that allows us to experience his presence. I theorize that if this part of the brain can be engaged it might off set a damaged ventromedial. How exactly it is engaged is a something of a mystery you may want to speak to a spiritual leader of you're own choosing. Very shortly after this he finds sobriety.  He quickly begins to reach out and try and help other alcoholics in an almost evangelical fashion.

Although Bill is championing the nascent cause of what will come to be AA. He and his wife are having difficulties trying to balance a happy marriage, working, providing for his family, and championing the righteous cause of what will come to be AA.

More over Bill is still bedeviled by preexisting character defects that even non alcoholics have . While on a business trip to Akron Ohio. Bill W. in a case of extreme serendipity contacts Dr. Bob. the other co-founder of AA. They quickly become fast friends.

Bill and Dr. Bob while mulling over what will come to be the founding principles of AA in one scene see two hobos in an alley during the great depression one helping the other up and dusting him off. Dr. Bob remarks that 'that makes you realize that drunks care for one another drunk or sober.' This makes, me at least realize, that AA or NA must be a fellowship of drunks or addicts who continue, although now sober, to care for one another. Too may drunks and addicts partly became so so they could get over there social awkwardness and make friends around the keg party or bar. They must replace that now in order to get better with healthier relationships at AA meetings or at other healthier locals like a coffee shop or some other sober place.

Bill W and Dr. Bob began to build the groundwork that would come to be AA the cornerstone of which is anonymity for all involved.

Bill and Dr. Bob begin to help other drunks beginning with another 'Bill' who was hospitalized in a psych ward for his alcoholism. They explain to him, correctly, that will power alone, or fighting it alone will lead to almost certain defeat.

By 1940, five years after AA was founded by Bill and Dr. Bob AA was beginning to take off. It builds a growing following, its founding 12 steps are founded and its 'Big Blue Book,' is published.

Dr. Bob on his death bed reminds Bill W. ' keep it simple.'

Even after years of bringing hope and sobriety to thousands, even hundreds of thousands of drunks Bill W and his lovely wonderful wife had to wrestle with balancing marital responsibilities and spreading there message of sobriety to other drunks.

Bill W. died in 1971.

At the time of the release of this movie 1989 there were 'more than 75,000. AA groups in 115 countries around the world.'",1417046400,,7412,4.581254724111867

561188,5,6303101410,"This is a really classic film of the history of the co-founders of Alcoholics Anonymous, Bill Wilson and Dr. Bob Smith. I work in a treatment center and show it to my clients who seem to like it as many of them have heard of Bill and Dr. Bob but don't know much of their amazing story. The actors, James Woods and James Garner  are top notch  though some of my colleagues from another 12 step fellowship have termed the movie kind of ""corny"". I haven't heard that from any clients I showed it to, they were more amazed that Bill and Bob let newcomers actually live in their homes with them while helping them sober up in the early days of AA before there were formal treatment centers.
The film also has an interesting vignette showing Dr. Silkworth of Dr's Hospital who later wrote ""The Doctor's Opinion"" in the AA Big Book. A definitive  point in AA and, really medical history in which he states that to achieve sobriety the alcoholic must have a spiritual experience. He also goes on to talk about alcoholism as a disease, comprised of an allergy of the body to alcohol combined with a mental obsession; that the first drink sets up a craving  and that only this spiritual experience, in his opinion as a physician has been effective in helping ""certain hopeless alcoholics"".
The film also shows the relationship between Bill Wilson and his wife, Ann who later founded Alanon Family Groups. Ann is played by Jo Beth Williams.",1413158400,4,1429,4.5703125

I saw this for the first time during an AA Event I was assisting with and it is truly a spectacular movie, unlike documentaries this movie has a great mix of antics as well as sticking to the story of how the program had originally started in Akron, OH and followed along the Oxford Group footsteps to create a program that has become a worldwide program that has helped many people pickup the pieces and dedicate their lives to sobriety. While this movie does not include the mention of other 12 step or support groups such as Al-Anon, Alateen or Narcotics Anonymous this movie is worth the money spent if you are interested in knowing more about the history of the program.

It's about a troubled drunk who through the grace of God, confluence of events, has  a spiritual awakening  and eventually starts the fellowship of AA. The acting is exceptional. Tells its story well, it feels real and it transports you in time back to the time period ( 1915-1950).",1385251200,3,540,4.556701030927835

The ""choice"" is not whether one can stop drinking on their own, the choice is to ""choose"" to get the proper help that you need to stop drinking and keep choosing to stop.  It is a livelong process.  I am so pleased with my husband who is now 6 months sober, taking it one day at a time.

It is true that the person dealing with this disease first have to admit the problem and then act.  I have seen the biggest difference when reaching out to help others and find others in your same place.  Sharing their story does heal and gives purpose for living.

As a film, I think it is good; as a ""docudrama"" I think it leaves
out some things that may leave one unsatisfied. Many AA's already
know more of the history than is presented here. But in any case

562536,5,6303101410,"This is a wonderful movie on many levels: good story, award-winning acting, great message.

Those that have ever encountered 12-step programs have likely also encountered the intriguing story of Bill W., the founder of Alcoholics Anonymous. A successful businessman, Wilson nearly lost all to alcohol - family, health, career - to alcohol, later regaining all of these (along with his sobriety) through his work in founding A.A.

Even if you're not in a 12-step program, this is a good story; if you enjoyed biopics like ""Walk the Line"" and ""A Beautiful Mind,"" this is a good movie for you. You get the added benefit of gaining knowledge; most of us will encounter someone who suffers from alcoholism or some other addiction in our lives and it's best if we do so armed with knowledge of what they're experiencing. If you are in a 12-step program (even if it's not A.A.), you get the added benefit of this movie helping your sobriety. I found myself inspired and helped in my own recovery from bulimia and prescription drug addiction. Whether you're new to program or not, this book will offer you strength and hope in your own journey towards recovery.

The production values of this movie were very solid, and I can see why James Wood got an award for his performance (which was really a highlight of the movie for me); I also thought the actors playing Lois Wilson and Dr. Bob were especially well-suited to their roles and delivered solid performances in their respective parts.",1308441600,,1482,4.803921568627451

562669,5,6303101410,"My Name is Bill W. is in our film library at our Retreat. It is required watching for our guests as they begin to learn about the disease of alcoholism, and to learn about the solution to the disease. Like personal favorite family stories, or beloved stories from Scripture, the Bill W. story never seems to become stale. Although the co-founders of AA worked very hard to stay humble and anonymous, inevitably  for people who have recovered from a seemingly hopeless state of mind and body, the story of AA's birth and early days has an iconic reverence to it. We love to tell it, read it and watch it again and again.

I have the pleasure of hearing the Bill W. movie reviewed very regularly by our guests, and it is always well-received and enthusiastically discussed. As our guests struggle with the damage of alcoholism in themselves, watching James Wood and James Garner portray with empathy and compassion the co-founders, they begin to accept themselves a little bit more. My favorite scene in the film is when Bill W. is coming off a bender, and he standing by his living room window, staring out at it. His wife, and co-founder of Alanon, Lois asks Bill, ""Why do you do it?"". Bill looks at her with such dismay and resignation and answers truthfully, ""I don't know"". The point just drives home, that there was no recovery program for Bill W. or Dr Bob to phone up and ask for the nearest meeting. They were doomed to an alcoholic death - until their divine intervention.

A great film, well acted, sensitive, and true to the story of the Bill Wilson as I understand it.

It depicts how Alcoholics Anonymous was formed and by whom.  I do believe the story line was close to accurate, however, the actors had no real personality and their characters seemed a little strained to fit the parts (with the exception of James Garner.  If not for him, this movie would have been a total FLOP).  In honesty, I laughed when Ebby staggered down the road.  Who really likes to see a drunk stagger, let alone someone doing a rather bad inpression of one while trying to be serious?  It was almost humiliating and uncomfortable.
This movie will always have a limited audience.  It is geared for those already interested in Alcoholics Anonymous AND are impartial toward ANYTHING positively related to it.

562842,5,6303101410,"James Woods won the 1989 best-actor Emmy for his performance in this film about the founding of Alcoholics Anonymous. The film received six other nominations, as well. So, beyond its value as a fascinating look at the origins of one of the most important spiritual movements of the 20th Century -- it's simply good movie making!

But there's a lot more to learn in exploring the roots of Alcoholics Anonymous. Once thought of as isolated from the realm of religion -- scholars of religious movements now regard the founding of AA with its reliance on a ""Higher Power"" as a major milestone in the evolution of American spiritual movements. This is especially true in newer books like Phyllis Tickle's ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Great-Emergence-The-How-Christianity-Is-Changing-and-Why-emersion-Emergent-Village-resources-for-communities-of-faith/dp/0801013135/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Great Emergence, The: How Christianity Is Changing and Why (emersion: Emergent Village resources for communities of faith)</a>"" Tickle argues that ""AA opened the floodgates to spirituality by removing the confines of organized religion.""

Think about its influence for a moment. Here is a massive national network formed around essentially spiritual principles that cut across religious boundaries -- and even manages to include non-religious people who define ""Higher Power"" in other ways. The movement was founded and grew with great success -- not as a branch of some traditional religious group -- but as a new way of bringing people together and organizing their reflections.

Not much could be done for an alcoholic in those days.  Today, there are many 12-step programs and treatment centers that are able to offer hope to the suffering alcoholic or addict.

The above to qualify myself as an authority on AA. Don't know if Woods has the problem or not but his portrayal of one with that monkey on his back is chilling. The film of wise necessity skirts the spiritual aspects of total surrender and acknowlegement of a ""power greater than ourselves."" Until some other power is acknowledged it remains ""alcohol. No psychiatrist can possibly understand that though many are helpful in steering the addicted to Alcoholics Anonymus. This film presents the power of self analysis, self desire to overcome, and the wish to be members of a tribe of happy, redeemed usually gifted people. I rank it up there with ""Lost Weekend,""

and ""Days of Wine and Roses,"" both Jack Lemmon's and if you are old enough Cliff Robertson's performance on live television where I was on the set doing commercials not yet realizing they were talking about me.

One of the many scenes in the movie that stands out is when Bill calmly acknowledges that although alcohol is ruining his life all he can think of is another drink. Contrast this to a subsequent scene when Bill and Dr. Bob first meet. Bob states that others have tried to help him but to no avail, etc. Bill interjects and tells him that he isn't there to help Bob but rather himself. This gets Bob's attention.

It really doesn't matter. This movie, regrettably is available only on VHS, will give you insight, understanding, and hope. Hope, that most fragile of words, is the basis of this incredible made-for-TV motion picture.
Bill Wilson comes home from World War I a hero. He then conquers Wall Street. He marries the love of his life, Lois. He then discovers both a new god, a new lover, a new idol; the bottle. This unflinching film looks at the descent of of alcoholic into hell, and his journey back, guided, not by the spirit of Virgil, but by another alcoholic, Doctor Bob. Together, they find a ""cure"" for an ""incurable"" disease. The disease of alcoholism.
Neither could cure themselves, but together, they could find the way out of hell into if not paradise, at least life; life on life's terms.
This film has been called the AA ""Roots."" I won't take up that guantlet. This film stands alone. The performances by James Woods, JoBeth Williams and James Garner stand on their own merits. It tells the story of one man's descent into the hell of addiction < and YES, alcoholism is an addiction >, and his return to the land of the living.
Woods plays Bill W. with remarkable restraint, not denigrating into the hystrionics of Jack Lemmon in ""The Lost Weekend""; as brilliant and well-meaning as that film is. Nor does this movie fall into high camp, as did ""Reefer Madness"" in the late Thirties.
Instead, in ""My Name Is Bill W."", we see a man driven to the depths of despair. A man beaten is beaten into the dust. To quote Cecil B. DeMille, ""the dust from which prophets and holy men are formed. . .""
Yet, this film is not preachy. It tells a story. A true story, all the more frightening, because it is true.
Watch this movie. Listen to its message of hope, of truth, of honesty, openness, and willingness. Hear the story of the damned, who somehow, someway, found salvation.
