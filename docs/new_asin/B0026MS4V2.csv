3854504,5,B0026MS4V2,"This is JUST excellent! Whoever buys a Blu Ray disc wants it to be as good as it gets, with High quality picture and audio, and this is not always guaranteed. But the Iron Maiden movie is an outstanding piece of midia. Also, there is A LOT of content in this disc. After the 1:50h documentary, there is still a 16 song list of live performances. FANTASTIC!!",1248134400,,357,4.343283582089552
3854505,5,B0026MS4V2,"Iron Maiden Videos of the past have often suffered from poor video or audio editing and rarely captured the energy of an Iron Maiden concert, but apparently those days are over.

Flight 666 hits you with some of the finest concert video ever captured by any band, and has the audio mix to back it up.  Thick and moody just like being there.  Steve Harris' bass will shake the dishes off your counter top if you've got the sound system to release it.

As always, Iron Maiden is just a fun group of guys to follow around, entertaining and candid interviews with all band members at various stages of the tour, and occasional comments from stage and support crew make for some of the best 2 hours you can buy if you're a fan of this band.

After 30 years, finally an Iron Maiden video that completely captures the essence, the energy, the massive sound, and the humor of the best rock band in history (my opinion, not theirs).

Even my non-metal friends have commented on what a great video this is, simply because it shows the humanity, and the pressure of putting together a tour of this scope... And in fact I've converted a couple non-Maiden friends into fans with only this Blu-ray.

If you're a fan, don't think twice.  If you're not a fan, hell, don't think twice, this will open your eyes to who this band, and their fans REALLY are.",1247875200,,1338,4.454918032786885
3854506,4,B0026MS4V2,"Image quality: pristine. Audio of concert tracks: awesome. Behind the scenes stuff: very, very cool.

The only thing keeping me from giving this 5 stars is the audio mix between songs and normal dialogue. You'll turn your audio up on your 5.1 to properly hear the talking bits, and when the music comes in it's gonna be freaking loud. Okay, well, that's not a problem for me, but in general you don't want to have audio sources mixed like that & better to normalize it all together. I'll have a look at my 5.1 setup again, but I think it's coming off the disc in a somewhat not great way.

That's the only gripe I have. The rest is really amazing stuff. The songs chosen for the disc are all performed amazingly well, the behind the scenes stuff isn't throw-away garbage they just threw on there.

I've watched Live After Death about 50x, I'm sure I'll end up watching this more times than that.

UP THE IRONS!",1247616000,,910,4.431137724550898

3854508,5,B0026MS4V2,"Iron Maiden...

Just Thank You.

Thank you for letting down the guard that so often separates reality from the ""glamours"" of stardom. Seeing how ""real"" the band is, understanding what Iron Maiden is all about, feeling the ""soul"" of the music---it's all lovingly accomplished in this wonderful documentary. Even if you're not a fan of Iron Maiden (you will be), you will enjoy this film. ""But there's more..(!)""...

Seeing the tears in the eyes of the people of Latin America. Wondering what was behind those eyes...

Seeing Bruce actually fly the band around the world in a 757. Umm...wow. That is certainly a first.

Seeing Steve and the musicianship, the family, the love for what Iron Maiden represents, and the integrity to hold on to that.

Seeing the absolute, nonforced, unabated JOY on the faces of the band, who truly seem to appreciate their audiences throughout the entire tour, in the face of the 2000's cynicism that pervades what passes as ""popular music"" most of the time today...

Thank you to Iron Maiden, to the filmmakers, and to the audiences of this tour for making something real, something tangible, and something to believe in. Kudos to all of those involved. 5 Stars all the way.",1246924800,4,1204,4.84390243902439
3854509,5,B0026MS4V2,"If you are a fan of Iron Maiden, this is the biggest no-brainer in the history of mankind.  Watching this concert in 1080P projected on a 133"" screen is awe inspiring.  The DTS-HD MA audio mix is appropriately aggressive and captures the band's sound perfectly.  It definitely helps that the band is obviously having fun with the enthusiastic crowds, and are in fine form, especially vocalist Dickinson, who sounds effortless hitting all of his signature high notes throughout the set.  I may be crazy, but he appears to have even better control of his voice now than on earlier concert films like the classic ""Live After Death"" when he was barely 26 years old (and theoretically in his prime!).  Impressive indeed.

Drummer Nicko McBrain literally puts on a drum clinic on several songs, and the set provides some great angles of his playing, especially a particularly well edited segment of ""Rime of the Ancient Mariner"" which had my jaw on the floor.  The guitar playing is also pretty great throughout, and surprisingly very tight considering there are 3 guitarists in the line-up.  It's hard to pick ""highlights"" because the whole set is basically guitar riff heaven!

As others have stated, this is a great concert to introduce people to Iron Maiden.  Oh, and there is also a pretty good documentary on the disk as well... ;)

The actual documentary is pretty light on content, and emphasizes fun moments more than shedding any real light on the inner workings of the band.  I was ok with that, even as a pretty huge fan of Maiden since the 80's, but I can certainly understand where someone that wants to know what color underwear Steve Harris wears would be disappointed here.  Ah well, you can't please everybody!  And apparently there is a mountain of footage not used, so I'm sure we'll eventually see it released in a retrospective of some sort when the band gets to that point in their careers (10 years from now would be my guess).

But for now, I can't recommend this disk highly enough.  Do not hesitate- even if you are only a casual fan- buy this NOW, especially if you have a good sound system and a 1080P display.",1245974400,27,2133,4.693548387096774
3854510,5,B0026MS4V2,"The first time I saw Iron Maiden was in San Jos, Costa Rica; I can`t believe how many people were to the concert; and how many people came for others countries.  The show was fantastic, and they come back again a few months later. That was the best show I've witnessed in my life, can not wait for the departure of the Blu Ray.",1245715200,,327,4.109375
3854511,5,B0026MS4V2,"On January 30th 2008, Maiden embarked on the first leg of their most adventurous tour: the ""Somewhere Back in Time"" tour. Their means of transportation was a Boeing 757, which carried the band, the fans, and the crew, as well as up to 12 tons of stage equipment. The pilot? Vocalist Bruce Dickinson.

Flight 666 is an incredible documentary that documents the first leg of this adcenturous tour. Made by Samm Dunn and Scot McFadyen, the geniuses behind two other awesome documentaries, ""Metal: A Headbanger's Journey"" and ""Global Metal"", this film is a treat for all Maiden fans.

During the 112 minutes, we see the band travel from country to country, with some breathtaking shots of the plane flying, and some great footage of the band when they're NOT on stage too. We even get gootage of the band on the plane, having fun as usual. They do such things as go golfing, visit the Mexican pyramids, and much more too. Thbe band are their usual selves with their usual sense of humor, which is expected! Of course Nicko has his usual hilarity too!

The concert footage is flat out amazing. Real up-close-and-personal footage, it gets my blood pumping every time I think of it. No overdubs in the audio as well, and the great audio quality is enough to make you feel like you're at the concert. Watching this movie made me think back to when I saw them on the second leg of the tour, and what a magical night it was too.

In short, this movie is a must see for all Maiden fans, and all fans of good music in general. It's a must-own too! I own the blu-ray, and have already watched it 3 times! But you know the deal, 3 times is never enough... not even 1000 times is enough!

The Blu-Ray quality is stunning. The picture quality is the best Blu-Ray quality, no doubt. There is an added grain in some shots, but that is to add a dramatic documentary look. Everything looks AWESOME here. The concert footage is awesome, makes you feel like you're there. The sound quality is stunning too- the DTS HD audio is awesome, if you have your system hooked up properly you can feel the music as if you're at the concert! The bonus concert footage is awesome as well. You get the full songs, with footage of the cities the songs are performed in before the songs.

So do NOT miss this film, and especially do NOT miss this blu-ray release too!",1244592000,16,2330,4.470588235294118

3854522,4,B0026MS4V2,"The documentary is so much fun. Lots of behind-the-scenes stuff, amusing commentary from band members and crew, and Bruce's piloting Ed Force One is impressive. The concert---which actually consists of song-by-song excerpts from many different concerts from around the world---is also very enjoyable. Bruce's voice was in top form on this tour. I deduct one star, however, because the editing of the concert footage annoyed me. Way too much cutting from shot to shot too quickly. If someone is playing a killer guitar solo, in my opinion, the camera MUST remain on the guitarist, including his face, for the duration of the solo. Especially when the guitarist is Dave Murray, who makes some of the best ""guitar faces"" ever. I don't want to see a shot of the audience right in the middle of an amazing guitar solo! I also can do without Janick Gers pulling out all the laughable moves from the 1980s Guitar Tricks playbook. At times I wondered if he was stretching his hamstring or playing guitar in a rock show. He should spend less time on his ""moves"" and more on practicing his solos.",1432166400,,1086,4.781914893617022

I was watching this BD last night and had the thought why don't i turn off the rear channel amp and see how that sounds.  WOW!  No more 25,000 screaming fans, just the boys playing loud and proud.  Great job of post production on this as well.  Some if not all lead guitar parts have been dubbed, that and Bruce's voice is a little prominent in some spots.  Drums are well recorded or dubbed on some tracks and seem lost in the mix on others.  Still a great concert video of Bruce and the lads on what was probably their last hurrah.  I was in TX last year or the year before when yet another IM tour was underway and the reviews of that show were not good to say the least.

3854555,5,B0026MS4V2,"This is a truly fantastic documentary of the heavy metal gods that are Iron Maiden. My parents, in there 50s, were not big fans of Iron Maiden going into the movie, probably because of what they associate with a heavy metal band. When it was over, they both said that they have much more respect for the band, and seem like minor fans now (my dad will even wear the Iron Maiden biker shirt I got him). They discovered that Iron Maiden are a bunch of very talented musicians who simply love performing for their loyal fans. Between shows they will play tennis, soccer, or golf...they only hit up the pub occasionally. They are not in a drunken state that many rockstars might be portrayed as. They are real people, which you get to see in this movie. They also sound great at the concerts on this particular tour. In fact, Bruce Dickinson sounded evern better than he does on this film when I saw them on their 2010 Final Frontier World Tour, and the guitarists couldn't be better, proving they have many years left in them.

3854556,5,B0026MS4V2,"If you are watching this on Blu-Ray the picture and sound are amazing.  The concept of playing nothing but classic songs, basically ""Live After Death"" with a few songs from later albums, and each recorded in a different country/venue is a solid endeavor.  I would have skipped ""Moonchild"" for something like ""Running Free"", but overall a strong song list.  Maiden finally delivers what fans want to hear - the old stuff.  The documentary is very well done and the whole DVD is exciting to watch from start to finish.  The actual ""concert"" itself is fantastic, but the unbearable part is Janick Gers with his absurd guitar swinging, playing from his hip, and butchering some songs particularly Adrian Smith's solos.  I don't know why he is playing some of Adrian's solos - Adrian wrote them, and his erratic style of play does not do Adrian's precise structure any justice.  Adrian Smith's role has been sadly reduced since he rejoined the band, and Janick should be lucky to still be with the band - who really needs three guitarists anyway?

3854562,5,B0026MS4V2,"Am a 39 year-old guy. I've always been a rocker and forever will be and Iron Maiden is one of my favorite ever since. Last year when I found out that the Maidens gonna have a concert in Irvine Meadows, Irvine CA which is near to the the place where I live I tried looking for a ticket online that very day of their concert coz I knew it's gonna be a lifetime experience. I was so lucky I got one and I was just a few yards away from the stage right at the middle. It was a great concert as whole. The music,the voice,the showmanship, the changing backdraft, the lights, the props and the pyrotechnics were superb. I've been watching a lot of rock concerts here in CA and in Vegas but having watched that one I said to myself,""I'm ok if I will never ever watch a concert again in my life coz that was the best.""We'll about this dvd actually mine was a blu ray coz twas cheaper than the dvd,I bought it coz I was hoping that the one I watched was included I mean that venue but unluckily they didn't include it. I also wanted to keep something special in addition to my concert collections and I wasn't wrong. All the places where they played during that tour was as awesome as where I've watched and I could reminisce that feeling as I'm watching this film. Plus the special feature which you'll be able to know about them and their experinces through the entire tour. We'll so much for that. Just buy it and you'll see what I was saying. I can guarantee you'll be satisfied with it,even the famous ones watched their show in LA like Dio, Larsh Ulrich of Metallica and more. Go get it!",1262131200,,1584,4.231023102310231
3854563,5,B0026MS4V2,"Amazing !!!
Everytime when I watch the Show or the Documentary, I really understand what means the fan's passion, and for heavy metal there's no boundaries. Great Documentary and the Live performances too !!!
Essential for Maiden fans !!!",1258243200,,238,5.128205128205129
3854564,3,B0026MS4V2,I received yesterday this blu-ray and the Rush's Snake and Arrows blu-ray. I saw pieces of them. The video and sound quality of 666 is just regular and the voice of Bruce is very bad recorded !!! I realy can't understand why! Then I put Rush ... the video and sound is much better !,1257552000,2,282,4.1454545454545455
3854565,5,B0026MS4V2,"Great to see the maidens in blue-ray. Wish the other video titles of maiden are available in blue-ray. Price was reasonable. So far, very satisfied.",1255737600,,148,4.96
3854566,5,B0026MS4V2,"I'm not a big fan of Maiden, but i do like a lot of their songs. I watched the preview of this Bluray, and I felt i had to get it. So I did.

The bluray features 2 ways to watch the concert:

- a film, half of it is the live performances in the diferent countries for each song, and documentary footage in between each of the songs, where you can see the band doing different kinds of stuff both at the country of the concert and in flight, interviews, backstage, you name it.
- full concert, what you were expecting to see, the songs played back to back, no interruptions.

Video quality is absolutely amazing, one of the best i've seen for a live concert dvd. Crisp, clear picture. one of the best in my collection. (maybe I'm still overwhelmed by the blu-ray quality)
Audio quality is great, it sounds very good in my 2.1 system, very clear sound. I bet in a 5.1 HD would sound amazingly good, but that's for you to find out.

I had a lot of fun watching the whole film, an interesting and never before seen documentary of the things a band would do, and that you have always wondered. Perhaps that is the suprise about this film, since you realize these guys do just the usual things normal people would do.
The song selection was amazing. You can see  most of their big hits, and you can feel the power and energy deployed on stage by these great musicians playing their own songs

I give this Blu-ray 5 stars because of the excellent video and audio quality, because it is a fun movie/concert to watch, the good edition, and the great song selection.",1254268800,6,1556,4.311643835616438
3854567,5,B0026MS4V2,"Iron Maiden has been my favorite band since...well...let's just say a long time.  The documentary portion of the Blu-Ray was top notch; it really captured the individual band members' uniqueness and quirks.  And to see Bruce at the helm of a 757; let's be honest, that is surreal!

The concert itself was perfect.  The Blu-Ray precision, crispness and sound quality are simply amazing.  It is inspiring to see these guys, who are ""older"", approach the stage with such enthusiasm and charisma.

Great product for all Maiden aficionados and for all those who still love Metal!",1254182400,,574,4.989473684210527

3854570,5,B0026MS4V2,I saw Iron Maiden live on this tour and the DVD brought back memories.  It's packed full of features and the Blu-Ray video is stunning.  All the songs you want to hear are on this disc.,1249776000,,185,4.111111111111111
3854571,5,B0026MS4V2,"This is an INCREDIBLE Blu-ray.

For mere 15 dollars, you get an amazing movie documenting the latest tour of the band, and more important, documenting the true love that this band has from its fanbase, specially here in South America. This movie is fun, exciting and endearing!

Besides the documentary, there are also 16 full songs, which are shown for one or two minutes during the movie but are available full on a separate part of the disc. On the DVD edition you have to change discs (1 for the movie and 1 for the concert) but on Blu-ray it is all in one single disc, with GREAT picture and GREAT audio qualities. Iron Maiden has many live DVDs and discs, but in my opinion this beats them all, since the quality is so high and the set-list is just PERFECT (16 of theyr best tracks from earlier days).

As a Brazilian and an Iron Maiden fanatic (I attented 2 of the 16 concerts shown on this disc) this has been the purchase of the year. Even if you are not such a hardcore Maiden fan, it is still worth it just to add to your Blu-ray collection, since image and sound are really sharp and the band is at its best, (even though they are way over their 50's).

The sound is some of the best I've heard for live concert footage on DVD/BLU RAY.You can really crank this one up to 10!I've been waiting patiently for a quality metal blu ray and this is it,hands down so far..unless your NOT a Maiden fan(then your just nuts anyways!)My wife is even stunned by this disc(because she's an awesome metal-head like myself) Don't even think about buying this if your a fan..DO IT.IMMEDIATELY.This will be watched close to a hundred times at least while I own it!!",1248134400,7,728,4.832
