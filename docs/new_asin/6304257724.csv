8216604,3,6304257724,"For someone who has some knowledge about aircraft this maybe a good video to acquire, it explains the basics about the air accidents but lacks the depth that some air enthusiasts may expect. The video clips were interesting but most were dated, clips of 707s, DC-8s and early 737s. I wouldn't say that this video is disappointing, however if one is looking for up-to-date and breathtaking clips I wouldn't suggest it. If you are interesting in the aftermath of a crash and the proceedings then it would be enlightening.",999907200,,519,4.842696629213483
