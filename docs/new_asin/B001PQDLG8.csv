8334367,5,B001PQDLG8,"If you have seen Borgen - Series 1, you'll probably love this film starring Borgen star Sidse Babett Knudsen as an opera singer, along with Borgen co-star Lars Brygmann who really is the star of the show playing the unpopular husband Jan. Jan must be one of the most detested employees around and his co-workers can't wiat to see the back of him. He is sent on a course by his ferry company boss where he meets two people with similar issues. One of these two people is played by Nicolaj Kopernikus (Vagn - The Killing - Series 1).
Sidse and Lars are excellent in Til dden os skiller as the unhappily married couple with Lars having some very good scenes as the idiot Jan in the workplace and Sidse displaying her full range of acting abilities with her shouting and singing.
Funnily enough, the ferry company where Jan works is a company that ferries passengers to and from Denmark to Sweden. In the story we see that ferry business is being lost to the Oresund Bridge mainly (as Jan's employers put it) because of Jan himself. Jan eventually seeks work as a toll collector on the Bridge and still manages to annoy the travelling public. In reality, soon after the bridge opened, ferry journeys became no more as motor vehicles and trains cross the bridge with great ease (and considerable expense) between the two countries. The Bridge is another Nordic series set around a murder on the very same bridge.
Sidse and Lars were definitely the stars of this film and makes it worthy of a rewatch sometime in the future.
Enjoy!",1340236800,,1525,4.589743589743589
