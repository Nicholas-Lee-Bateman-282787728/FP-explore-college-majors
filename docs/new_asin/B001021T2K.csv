This is back when Ian Anderson still had his voice and in my opinion was at his peak.
The Band is very good and extremely tight.
He does versions of Fallen on Hard Times and Pussywillow from Broadsword and the Beast.
He also does Jack in the Green from Songs from the Wood and He does Heavy Horses from the album of the same name. Heavy Horses has always been one of my favorite live songs. When he does it live you hear him play an acoustic guitar which is not heard on Heavy Horses.
Hunting Girl is another song from that era.
Black Sunday is included, and any chance to hear Black Sunday live is a pleasure. He goes into Aqualung and Locomotive Breath and a Reprise of Black Sunday and Cheerio. What a way to end a performance.
The DVD closes with some appearances on German television with earlier recordings.............This is a must for any Tull fan and interesting for those who want to get to know Jethro Tull.......Cheerio",1213142400,,1049,4.384615384615385
