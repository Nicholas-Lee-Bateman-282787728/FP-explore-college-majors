1257615,3,B000034DE2,"I am not an expert on movies, but I do enjoy most biblical dramas. A long time ago, I recorded this movie off TV; (not a very good recording), so I was very thrilled to find that it is availlable on DVD. When it arrived in the mail, I sat down to watch it right away. I was surprised at the poor quality of this reproduction. The colours are kind of pale and keep fading in it out. However, I did enjoy the story and it is still watchable. Hopefully, some day they will release a better reproduction of this movie. Be aware of low priced DVD's, I will be in the future.",1145923200,2,569,4.04424778761062
1257616,4,B000034DE2,"Most of the movie centers around political intrigue between Constantine and those in Rome who want to usurp his power and prestige. There is a good amount of Roman battle scenes (Civil war). A very small part of the movie is also taken up fighting the barbarians.

However, it is a good example of just what Christian Martyrs by the tens of thousands had to endure (death) before Constantine came on the scene. Some here say that it is not factual. Yet evidence from antiquity is strong that Constantine did have a conversion due to divine intervention. He was alone among emperors to fight for religious freedom.  Constantine did not convert immediately after seeing the cross in the sky. But the stage was set.  His mother (Helena/to Catholics: St Helena) is portrayed very well in this movie.

In this movie, I was glad to see that we see in the Christians of the time, a sincere, unwavering love for Christ.  How else could they go so willingly to their deaths.

At such a very small price for this fully restored and digitally enhanced film, you just can't go wrong.",1134432000,5,1071,4.64021164021164
1257617,1,B000034DE2,"The worst movie ever made, EVER! It is SO boring and stupid and it has no point or plot. Its picture is terrible and so are the actors! BAD MOViE!",1089244800,3,146,3.9
1257618,3,B000034DE2,"I ran this film (which was called CONSTANTINE THE GREAT here in the UK)in May, 1963, when I was a cinema projectionist. At the time, Italian historical spectaculars were very much the in thing, just as spaghetti Westerns would be a few years later. At the time, I thought it was quite good and a more elaborate example of the genre and particularly liked Mario Nascimbene's score. Looked at today, however, over forty years later, I have to agree with the sentiments expressed by the above reviewer. Despite amazon.com saying the film is in black and white, it's actually in Eastmancolor and TotalScope, an Italian form of CinemaScope. Unfortunately, this video transfer is one of the worst I have ever seen of a Scope film and whoever at VCI Home Video is responsible for it should be sacked. The ratio is all wrong and the anamorphic film has been transferred to video semi-squeezed, so that all the characters look tall and thin. It hurts your eyes after a while. The 35mm copy it was transferred to video from is a badly worn original exhibition print and full of splices, especially at the beginning and end of each reel, with scratched in queu marks jumping about all over the place. Presentation is everything with a film like this. It badly needs remastering properly from a brand new print and the picture correctly stretched out to its intended ratio of 2.35:1, so that there is no more image distortion. Conversely, the sound quality is excellent.",1071619200,14,1458,4.766798418972332
1257619,3,B000034DE2,"The vast majority of this movie that centers on Constantine's personal life is pure fiction.  However, that is not so bad;  ""Gladiator""  re-wrote history, too, but was nonetheless a great movie.  And this movie  does not fabricate history just to fabricate, but rather it does so with  the objective of tying Constantine and Christianity together.
One of  the more notable scenes in which historical fact comes together with a  fudging of Constantine's life is the arena scene.  In this segment,  Constantine jumps down into a pit where Christians are maliciously being  slaughtered.  Historically, the feeding-the-Christians-to-the-lions motif  is right on.  Under the emperor Galerius (ruled 305-311 A.D., shortly  before Constantine ascended to the throne), Christian persecution was at  its height.  While it is untrue that Constantine slew lions to save  Christians, the arena scene nevertheless serves as an excellent depiction  of incidents which really happened.
The really notable quality of this  movie lies in its portrayal of major historical happenings.  As a previous  reviewer noted, Diocletian and Maximian really did abdicate the throne in  308. It is also true that his mother, Helena, was a Christian (although the  details re: his relationship w/her in the movie are fictional).  He did  marry Fausta (although he had her and his eldest son Crispus put to death  for treason in 326 - long after the time period covered in this movie).  The inclusion of Constantine's ""divine vision"" before his battle  with Maxentius is essential;  perhaps one of the defining moments in the  entire history of Christianity.  The actual battle itself is also given  accurate treatment as Maxentius' cavalry was ambushed and trapped by  Constantine's forces, just as the film claims.
Now, for the bad news.  I  found the acting of the females in this movie quite well done, but the male  actors were stilted, overly-dramatic & pretty much downright awful.  The quality of the film itself also leaves quite a bit to be desired.  All  of the scratches and skips are amplified by the DVD picture.
All in all,  this film is most definitely not for everyone.  However, it is well worth  the time for anyone who is interested in Roman history, world history or  the history of Christianity.",966470400,52,2286,5.145205479452055
1257620,3,B000034DE2,"Now joining the crowded field of budget DVD makers is Diamond Entertainment Corp.  And like some of their ilk, the results are mixed.  Which is better than most of their ilk, who are just plain lousy.
I  first saw Constantine and The Cross three years ago on an EP recorded  videotape released by DEC.  Now with the DVD, I've noticed a few changes.  First, the main titles and prologue were rife with print damage: tears,  scratches, etc.  It looks like they've gone back and cleaned it up by  running still images of each title card over the original music.  The  prologue text following it looks video generated, evidenced by the black  dropshadow that wasn't there in the original text.  Otherwise, the DVD is  about the same as the tape, with the faded color and print damage mentioned  by the first reviewer.  Also worth mentioning is how the movie(both DVD and  VHS) is letterboxed at a ratio significantly less than the 2.35 to 1 ratio  of its Totalscope process.  2 to 1 at best, and everyone is a little on the  thin side, suggesting then that the anamorphic print was not fully  ""unsqueezed"".
The technical issues aside, I must say that  Constantine and The Cross is a good movie that separates itself from other  Italian spectacles with an intelligent script and capable actors.  The  production values seem higher than most of that era, though it does suffers  from lethargic and poorly staged battles like other peplum.",960854400,5,1432,4.742857142857143
1257621,3,B000034DE2,"I first saw ""Constantine and the Cross"" when I was maybe 8 years old, 34 years ago. The scene where Constantine sees the flaming cross in the sky became imbedded in my memory, and from then on I had a fascination  with Roman history that led to my current career (I sell Roman coins and  write historical novels for a living!). Ever since then, I've wanted to see  the movie again, but to my immense frustration, it seemed to disappear  completely from any TV playlists.  I also could never find it on VHS  videotape.  Imagine my delight when a friend picked up a newly released DVD  of ""Constantine and the Cross"" and loaned it to me! ""Don't  expect much,"" he told me. ""It's pretty awful.""  Despite this  warning, my hands were almost trembling as I slipped the disk into my new  DVD player...
Well, how does it stack up 34 years after the first  viewing?  Suprisingly, not as badly as I would have thought. It's an  Italian-American co-production starring Cornel Wilde as Constantine and a  bunch of Italian sword-and-sandles stock players, made circa 1960 to cash  in on the ""Ben Hur"" biblical epic craze. The budget was obviously  pretty slim, and the cinematography, costumes and sets all have the  standard Italian budget production look.  Despite this, the script is  suprisingly literate.  I was amazed at the amount of real history the  makers crammed in, resisting the temptation to ""dumb down"" one of  the most complex and fascinating eras in history, the early 4th Century AD.  At any one time, there were as many as six Emperors ruling different parts  of the Empire, and the scriptwriters make a creditable stab at sorting  through this confusion.  My favorite was the scene where the co-Emperors  Diocletian and Maximian jointly abdicate their thrones and name four new  rulers--an event that actually took place pretty much as depicted!
They  even had enough extras to field a pretty good size Roman army, although the  battle scenes are all pretty hokey by ""Spartacus"" or  ""Braveheart"" standards.  Cornel Wilde gives a suprisingly nuanced  performance as Constantine, starting out as an arrogant young hothead and  maturing into a man bent on creating a free and just Roman Empire.  The  actress who plays Constantine's love interest, Fausta, is pretty luscious,  and the Italian actor who plays Maxentius, the bad guy, is silkily  effective (and looks pretty much like the real Maxentius, whose face is  still recognizable from his coins--likewise for Wilde as Constantine).  Anyway, I watched this whole film with a huge grin on my face, reliving the  spark that had set me on my life's course.  My only real complaint is the  state of the film itself--the color is very washed out, and there are  numerous scratches, blips and color blobs--this looks like a print that was  scored from a High School AV closet.",954720000,25,2830,4.861052631578947

It was constantine that ordered his priests to bind the OT and NT together and to quote unquote, make it fanciful. This man created simon magus christianity and then persecuted all christians who refused to adhere to this heresy. Movies like this make me laugh as they are just total propaganda hoping to teach you history without you knowing it. Constantine was a vain seflish man who was a member of a very naughty non christian secret society that claimed to  worship the sun itself but seemed to be more spirit worship and was ok with human sacrifice as long as it was not important people anyway.
This man did alot to reduce jesus to a marketing tool to recruit but that no one seems to listen to. He also set the stage for the pope declaring himself god until god returns. Also the early church fabricated documents to assert that constantine gave the church all his worldly empirical powers and bestowed them upon the church, which is false but they like to print fake documents to justify claims. Constantine was a pagan who worshipped spirits and was in sol invictus cult, to call this man father of anything is just scary.",1423267200,4,1248,4.672727272727273

Yes Constantine was a pagan but how many thousands and thousands of Christians did he save ? Plus it was he that organized the Council of Nicea which gave us the Creed and in this Council the Catholic Church gave the world the Bible.  Of course over the past 1700 years or so every Protestant denomination has changed the Bible to fit their own theology.

1257703,2,B000034DE2,"I really wanted to like this film - but I simply couldn't. Below, some more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

First, the technical aspects. This is a very bad transfer from a clearly very heavily used tape. Both images and sound are of rather poor quality. Also, this film was initially turned in Italian and English dubbing is par moments ATROCIOUS! But all of that would be secondary, if the film was good - but it is not...

Now, being Christian myself I was very eager to watch the only (to my knowledge) film about Constantine the Great (272-337, Roman Emperor 306 to 337) and especially the miraculous event which occurred in 312 when following a prophetic dream this young emperor decided to adopt Christian cross as the sign of his army for the incoming decisive battle before the walls of Rome. Constantine's life and adventures before he became emperor in 306 are already a great tale, but everything what happened after is even more incredible - sometimes even stranger than things we can see in ""Game of Thrones""... But for some reason, there is only one film telling this story - and to my considerable regret it tells this story poorly.

Although the real story of Constantine's life was extremely interesting, here director and scenarist managed to make it into a standard-issue peplum, with incredibly stereotyped characters: noble and generous Constantine, villainous treacherous Maxentius, brave heroic sidekick Hadrian, virginally immaculate young Christian Livia (played by German actress Christine Kaufmann - who was once Tony Curtis wife - lucky b@st@rd!), etc. etc. The only little touch of originality comes from the character of Fausta, Constantine's wife (and Maxentius sister!) played by sculpturally beautiful Belinda Lee (who tragically died in a car accident immediately after this film was finished). Everything here is predictable, dialogs are lame and we heard them all one thousand times before, all form of humor is missing in action, etc. etc.

Fighting scenes are also the same thing we saw a thousand of times. There are however some unwillingly funny moments - when at one moment a Roman general dies in battle, well, even if this is not the most ridiculous scene I ever saw, it definitely must qualify into the Top 5...))) Also, at one moment it really becomes amusing how all Romans wear armor (helmets included!) everywhere and for every occasion...))) And finally, the scene of the ""Miracle of the Cross"" and the key moments which follow are shown in such a lame way, with Cornel Wilde giving such a wooden, tired, unconvincing ""I am saying this just because they made me - I do not believe one word of it - but if I do not play the script I will be fired"" way, that at that moment I really felt sorry that I forced myself to watch this film...

The only reason I give to this film two stars instead of one are two scenes of Christian persecutions. They are pretty strong and they give a good idea of the horrors inflicted by pagan Romans to the first Christians - honestly those two scenes shocked me greatly... And I do not think I will ever be able to laugh again at any jokes about Christians and lions...

Bottom line, this is a bad film and watching it is mostly a loss of time. And it is a pity. I do not think I will keep this DVD for any future viewings. And I really, sincerely hope one day somebody will make a super production about Constantine the Great and the ""Miracle of the Cross"" thanks to which Roman Empire became Christian which allowed Christianity to spread (much) later to other continents - and make world a better place.

1257708,3,B000034DE2,"Constantine was as cold as they come:  a shrewd and ruthless manipulator of power, he never hesitated to massacre his adversaries without even the appearance of honor or scruple.  This  portrays him as a heathen with a conscience,  who from observation and conviction is converted to Christianity.  In the end, according to the film, he established religious tolerance for the first time in the Roman Empire.  This is very close to the ""official version"" - Christianity was in fact persecuted in Rome because it denied others (and esp. the patron gods of the city) any validity whatsoever (afterall, it was monotheistic and messianic).  Rome, before Christianity, was one of the most tolerant societies in religion as well as morals that had ever existed to then.

That being said, this a very good dramatic film.  You see a Constantine who struggles both within himself and against psychopathic seekers of power.  His righthand man, Hadrian, falls for a Christian girl, and is converted. Constantine resolved a great personal conflict that defined his life, which is a spoiler if revealed in detail, and receives a religious vision that enables him to win an unlikely victory.

While I disagree with the historical perspective, this really is a fun film.  And it is stimulating:  my kids were asking lots of questions, always a good sign.

For example, Hollywood will INSIST on showing horsemen of this period using modern stirrups whereas these were not known until a bit later (horsemen on the later FEL TEMP REPARATIO coins of Antioch are shown using a rudimentary stirrup). But this film shows the riders are they were - no stirrups. Also the cuirasses of the emperors and caesars are exactly that - cuirasses (= made of LEATHER and not of Hollywood's beloved, shiny chrome which looks like it could be part of some US glam car)..
And all this rubbish which Hollywood spreads, about C. making his troops paint their shields with a chi-rho (something which is not documented anywhere in historical papers)? Not in this film, they don't.

1257711,3,B000034DE2,"In CONSTANTINE AND THE CROSS director Lionello de Felice brings to the screen a period of time in Western history that is much misunderstood and even less recognized in history texts.  The Roman Empire in the early 300s was a strange and unwieldy quilt of multi emperors all of whom ruled various subsets of what had once been a unified empire.  There was an emperor for the Eastern provinces and another for the western.  And in both there was a sort of junior emperor called a caesar.  Cornell Wilde is Constantine, son of one of these caesars.  His father is killed in battle, and Constantine is soon elevated to the emperorship as a result of a smashing victory over a barbarian army.  The film is historically accurate in many areas, but suffers from an inexcusably poor job of transferral to DVD which includes blotches and blips aplenty. De Felice captures the historical sweep of events that must have seemed confusing even to contemporaries but due to a deft hand behind the camera never manages to lose the interest of the viewer.

Wilde begins the film as a hothead, who seems to be unwilling to heed the advice of his caesar father.  As event follows event, we can see his slow maturation on several levels.  As he moves to Rome to get embroiled in the power struggle that will later elevate him to emperor, Wilde becomes more astute as one who gets on the job practice as a young emperor to be.  He meets and later marries Fausta, fetchingly played by Belinda Lee, who in real life died in a car accident just a few months before the film was released. Fausta is a woman who is torn between her love for Constantine and her knowledge that her brother and he must soon collide in a lethal duel for the crown.  The film has several dramatic highlights. The much discussed scene of the moon morphing into a cross stands out. Further, De Felice had to stretch a tight budget so that a few hundred extras could sub for the tens of thousands that were seen in other films like Ben Hur and Spartacus.  The film does not mention that in real life Constantine executed Fausta for fear that she had cuckolded him with a son from a prior marriage. The historical Constantine is mostly remembered as the first Roman emperor who made Christianity as the empire's official religion. Wilde is convincing as a ruler who slowly comes to value acknowledging a faith that places peace over mindless war.  CONSTANTINE AND THE CROSS is one of those rare films that entertains even as it instructs. It succeeds well enough for one to overlook the admitted flaws.

7916623,3,B000034DE2,"I'm surprised no cult following has developed for the stunning Belinda Lee, the major British movie star(no 10 uk star of 1957)who died at 25 in 1961. This was her last film-released posthumously. i'm surprised it is a grade B film- since Belinda's 3 previous Italian films were biggies. Fantasmi a Roma / Ghosts of Rome (1961) teamed her with Marcello Mastroianni, and  she was the female  lead in the classic,
I magliari / The Magliari (1959) with Alberto Sordi, The italians left an everlasting beauty of a film(it has got to be a classic),La lunga notte del 43 / The Long Night of 1943 (1960) to best remember Belinda by She is,in this unforgettable film, stunning, talented and charismatic, a total star. I wish i could find a decent qualitty of this film, and I think the other B movie Belinda made before this , Joseph and His Brethen. But, in this form, the movie is a trial to sit through.",1506643200,,898,4.537037037037037
