Greg Lake is a excellant preformer as well. Never followed there music and rush to put on there music, But Live in Concert no 1 touches them,And Ive seen them all from Zepplin to Pink floyd. Only Concert Ive ever been to where a 12,000 seat Arena shook. Memories they never Fade",1314230400,5,470,4.292134831460674

4532748,1,B0052Y0FCC,"As a big ELP fan who saw them many times ""in the day"" this DVD is a HUGE disappointment. Somewhere I read that one of the lads didn't want it ever released and I see why.

Let's try to deal with Carl Palmer,shall we?This is a excellent concert. Let me consider the most popular criticism to date. Greg Lake needs to lose weight. I agree. Greg Lake is no Elvis. If you don't think he's up for it,get somebody else;perhaps a L name. He is Greg Lake. Carl Palmer?Who let him play for Asia?Keith Emerson?His knife-play on the keyboards in Pictures at an Exhibition is simply spine-tingling. I do have one complaint about the concert and there is little anybody can do about it. They should of had the longer intro for Fanfare for the Common Man.",1442275200,,693,4.596774193548387

4532760,5,B0052Y0FCC,"I give it 5 stars for energy. Although the sound track has lots of the sound reinforcement system bleeding through - well, you get that stadium sound - the performance is electric. Carl Palmer still in top form on drums; Keith Emerson close to bursting into flames at the keyboards. Greg goes along and delivers a few good lines, just to show that he still has ""the voice.""",1408147200,2,373,4.5
4532761,4,B0052Y0FCC,Great to see this very recent concert of ELP and still performing very well in spite of their ages.,1404691200,,99,4.2631578947368425

4532763,5,B0052Y0FCC,This is a great performance from ELP! It's good to see that Keith Emerson was able to get back to playing as good as ever. The band is very tight. Video and sound quality are excellent. Recommended to any ELP fan - you won't be disappointed!,1403308800,7,241,4.260869565217392
4532764,5,B0052Y0FCC,"This was a great addition to my collection. Video and audio was great. Yes Greg has ballooned up but for his age his voice is still pretty good. Keith still has the chops and Carl, in fantastic shape, still has it all !",1402358400,4,219,4.116279069767442
4532765,5,B0052Y0FCC,"Maybe it was because my expectations were low going into viewing this live performance, but whatever it was, Emerson Lake and Palmer live at High Voltage completely blew me away.  I think my reservations were rooted in the fact that the fellows were not going to be nearly as good in 2013 as they were in 1972.  Is Carl Palmer trying to relive past glories with his overlong drum solo's? yes.  Is Kieth Emerson guilty of the same thing by stabbing his keyboard with knives? yes.  Is Greg Lake starting to resemble George Wendt from Cheers?  Absolutely.  Do I care?  Not one iota.  The fact is, although ELP are not as uniformly tight as they were in the 70's, they are still a musical force to be reconed with in  their 60's reminding all of those that came after them in the world of progressive rock to respect the technical virtuosity that was on display at this performance.  The best thing about this performance is the set list.  So many times when watching these classic bands live I am let down by the song selection.  ELP wisely play the stuff the people want to hear.  When Take A Pebble goes into Tarkus I almost lost my mind!  What a brilliant idea and what flawless execution!  They also cover most of Pictures From An Exhibition.  Greg Lake cannot sing as well as he did back in the day but most musicians from that era cant.  He truly did have one of the greatest singing voices of all time.  Emerson and Palmer on the other hand are absolute beasts at their craft.  Carl's aformentioned drumming is utterly stunning and a treasure to behold on my surround sound.  This concert is a must for the not to picky and fans of the band.",1401062400,16,1645,4.42
4532766,4,B0052Y0FCC,"ELP is a very rare concept(Keyboards,Bass guitar, and drums).Greg Lake looks very well fed and Carl Palmer looks like he is in ok shape for getting older, and Keith Emerson has slowed down considerably,understandably. IT is a REUNION and not a regularly rehearsed group here. Emerson's playing is noticeably slower and the whole band is noticeably not quite there....To me it is like watching older football players play football NOW. But it's still interesting overall. I just am NOT watching this and shouting out YEAH BABY!! Like some former videos of this band I have and have seen...",1396828800,2,588,5.010204081632653
4532767,4,B0052Y0FCC,"This is a good concert DVD, the band was in good form throughout and they are a really good rock trio, very original.",1390780800,,117,4.130434782608695
4532768,5,B0052Y0FCC,"I chose this rating because the emerson lake and palmer 40th anniversary edition has a great concert,and great behind the scene footage exclusively of the band. they play lots of classics like from the beginning,karn evil 9,lucky man, and many other hits and etc. I would like the amazon.com customers to buy this product because it is something they would enjoy and like. The reason why I'm telling the amazon.com customers to buy it because they would enjoy the full length concert and the special features. The concert was filmed in scotland 2010. So I want to give this dvd digital video disc a 5 to 10 stars with a 100% rating.",1388880000,3,632,4.651785714285714
4532769,5,B0052Y0FCC,"My favorite group of all time-- first saw them in 1971 at Madison Square Garden - good DVD of their reunion - yea, they are a little slower, a few off key hits but Welcome Back My Friends......",1388448000,,193,4.105263157894737
4532770,5,B0052Y0FCC,"It was a great concert in my opinion. Wish I was there!  I have had a love of ELP for 35 years. Ok, So yes it's true...Greg is probably the heaviest we've ever seen him here. The guy has always struggled with his weight it seems as have many of us and to me he will always be Handsome and the beautiful person I grew to admire. His voice is deeper but I find it more manly and mature and still quite stunning. No one can imitate his diction. He still tears up that bass and acoustic guitar as well.  Carl of course plugs along and is unbeatable.
  Keith is obviously struggling a bit here...I have read that he has carpal tunnel as well as some other issues with his hands  but honestly...These Gentleman  are still better than most of the new headliners out there today and put on a  better show...even on their C game.  Alot of the overly produced, auto tuned acts out today really need to study ELP's career and respect them for the World class musicians that they are...older and chubbier aside.",1377648000,4,999,4.333333333333333
4532771,4,B0052Y0FCC,"I have been a huge ELP fan for years.  I had seen them a number of times in their prime,  most notably the show with full orchestra at Madison Square Garden during the summer of 1977.  Truly the pinnacle of my concert going experiences. (now why didn't they do an official release of that concert?  instead of the hacked up Montreal release?)  Sadly this DVD left me very flat.  I didn't think the performances were very inspiring and seemed a bit sloppy like they hadn't gotten enough practice in.  I think it best that I remember ELP from its pre-1978 days.

I would like to point out that it was nice to see a NEW release from ELP.  (which is why i gave this 4 stars)  Their recent trend of doing endless releases of compilations and ""greatest hits""  along with trying to cash in on those unauthorized ""bootlegs"" is just obnoxious.  The trading community has supported ELP when they weren't doing a thing for years to keep the band alive with its truest fans.  Releasing bootlegs makes the band a few bucks but does nothing for their stature.",1374537600,,1045,4.49468085106383
4532772,4,B0052Y0FCC,It was fun to relive the sights and sounds of ELP. I used to catch them in LA {mostly the Greek or Hollywood Bowl} in the 70's and 80's. They were great then. They're great now. But OLDER. Aren't we all.,1371168000,,203,3.975609756097561
4532773,2,B0052Y0FCC,I bough this DVD with a lot of enthusiasm but was deceptioned.  Voice of singers are lost.  A lot of mistakes while performing.  Sound quality is poor.,1366156800,,151,4.518518518518518
4532774,5,B0052Y0FCC,"OK-long time ELP fan, here we go-the video and audio quality-excellent. The mix has all the keyboards a bit low for my taste. Performance-as with another review, I didn't feel they were quite together, or warmed up enough? the first few songs. Just could not get into the ""deeper"" voice of the now,much wider bodied Greg Lake. Emerson seemed to struggle a bit to keep tempo, I am forgiving, hope I can do as well at ANY age:) Carl Palmer-one of the best, actually does better performances before, and after this show with his own band_now called Carl Palmer legacy),at the closing number(fanfare) his drum rack to the right started to want to jump off stage, affected his playing, and noticably his attitude while yelling to a drum tech to push it back, and try to pull carpet back out. This affected what I presumed was his intent to jump over the drums onto a box in front of his riser(which he did in ASia live in Asia,1983
It's all good. They did seem like 3 separate people,instead of a group(shame on Greg for coming and going, waa-but thats another matter altogether.) Still, as the last ELP performance were likely to ever see- I still say-Bravo!-and would recommend to all collectors. Too bad we didn't have film of this quality from the 70;s!",1362441600,4,1252,4.618834080717488

4532777,1,B0052Y0FCC,"I'm a huge ELP and Progressive Rock fan, but how anyone who views this video can claim it's anything but utter garbage, I don't understand. I bought this blu-ray DVD at Best Buy, very excited to view it. To my dismay, I couldn't even get through the first song. Keith Emerson CANNOT PLAY anymore. He was awful. Carl Palmer was OK but Greg Lake (he looks as big as a lake, lake Michigan) wasn't as bad as Keith, but that's not saying much. If you love this band DO NOT PURCHASE THIS DVD. It will only diminish your memory of this once great band.",1359244800,5,545,4.25

4532779,2,B0052Y0FCC,"Poor audio, video is crisp, sound engineering was not done well and there is no vocal range or the originally quality is gone. Bass was booming even when Lake was playing it? I tried adjusting my 5.1 system but not possible to get a good sound and given today's technology it should have been easy. I am not a super fan but I especially like their their ballads which were either missing (such as Still You Turn Me On) or done poorly. The vocals on Lucky Man had to compete with the crowd, a good engineer would have cleaned it up.",1353715200,5,531,4.267326732673268
4532780,5,B0052Y0FCC,"My wife & I stumbled on this broadcast on cable when we were on vacation. I was blown away at the performance. Some reviews say; well, he doesn't have the range he used to have. SO WHAT??? This is guys in their 60's that can perform circles around much younger groups. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.",1353456000,,306,4.032786885245901
4532781,5,B0052Y0FCC,Audio and video are great .  Incredible music !  If you like ELP you'll love this. Palmer is great on drums.,1353283200,,108,4.095238095238095
4532782,2,B0052Y0FCC,"I have put off reviewing this DVD as I thought I might feel differently about it after repeated viewings. You know, Give it a chance and all. After all, these guys are not the young guys they once were. I was lucky enough to see them live, both with Carl Palmer and with the late, great Cozy Powell. They were terrific both times and are certainly one of the most important progressive bands in rock music.

Having said that, this is not a great concert. While I agree that the sound and picture on this blu-ray are first rate, the performance is not, and I cannot muster more than two stars simply because this is the legendary ELP. High def only accentuates the band's shortcomings that much more, sorry to say.

Right from the beginning, so to speak, the band sounds sloppy, unrehearsed and generally tired. As others have pointed out here, cues are missed and several of the songs are simply played too slowly, seeming to drag ultimately.
Greg Lake is noticeably overweight and unhealthy looking, and while his playing is fairly solid, his singing is sometimes flat or sharp. I concede that time takes a toll on vocal chords and I certainly don't expect perfection, but I cannot help but feel that Greg is weaker for his physical condition. Whatever his issue is, it's more than just monitors.
Conversely, Carl Palmer looks and sounds great, although his performance is by no means perfect. One wishes he didn't feel the need to take his shirt off during the drum solo.
Keith Emerson has some moments here, but it would seem that he is the weakest link, musically speaking. He screws up noticeably throughout the performance (mostly with tempo) and this seems to derail the whole band at times. Someone here mentioned that his hand was bothering him during this performance, so why choose to release this particular set? I simply do not believe that this is the best this band can sound, even now, so why immortalize this as possibly the last live document of the once mighty ELP?

It's not all bad though. After a plodding and lackluster opening ""Karn Evil 9 (1st Impression - Part 2)"", things get a bit better as the band warms up. As I pointed out earlier, the sound and picture are crisp and clear and the set is a decent mix of material. Most fans will hear at least a couple songs that they like. Lighting is well done throughout, and Keith and Carl's solo bits are pretty good. ""From The Beginning"" is ok, if not a little subdued. ""Farewell To Arms"" is decent.

I received this DVD as a Christmas gift and I have to admit that if I had paid for it I would probably be pretty disappointed. It's a shame that we didn't have the option of high def while some of these bands were still at their peaks.
But we didn't, so we're stuck with this.
Die hards will probably feel that they need this and may be able to overlook the glitches. Casual fans shouldn't run out for this DVD. It's hard not to feel like the band simply needed money with this particular release. More than anything it's kind of a quaint nostalgia trip.

My idea of an amazing set from an older band on blu-ray?
Check out Rush's R30 tour and be amazed.
Ridiculously good.",1353196800,3,3145,4.510526315789473
4532783,3,B0052Y0FCC,"Time has flown by as we see ourselves especially those who have followed ELP since the beginning. It is
amazing to see how time affects some and not others...Carl Palmer still looks great and has the vitality
after all these years. This DVD is a great reflection of one of the great groups of the 70s.",1353110400,,301,4.392857142857143
4532784,4,B0052Y0FCC,"Have seen ELP many times over the last 40 years...This particular concert is not one of there best, however it is still vintage ELP...unfortunately Greg Lake has put quite a few pounds on and looks like he is ready to explode...still has that great voice!",1351641600,,255,4.688888888888889

4532786,5,B0052Y0FCC,"I guess some people will complain about anything.  Maybe it's because I didn't expect them to perform like they were still 20-something, but I thought this concert was fantastic!  Does Palmer have the same ripped abs ... no.  Is Lake's voice strong as a bell ... no.  Is Emerson as energetic behind the keyboards ... no.  And I've missed more than a few cues myself lately.  But even this ELP beats the heck out of any band today.  This concert did not disappoint my memories of a half dozen live concerts from 1973 to 1997.  I'll pay good money to see them again anytime!  Fantastic!",1348704000,10,584,4.485714285714286
4532787,5,B0052Y0FCC,"After all these years, these three men were inspiring. ""After all these years"", they were quite impressive. Let me see vids of you misanthropes in your 50's /60's. Show us your talent...",1348617600,,186,4.84375
4532788,1,B0052Y0FCC,"I am sorry for what I am about to say as I have seen ELP 10 times and been fortunate to meet all of them twice. I had such high expectations after 12 years of waiting only to be disappointed by sloppy playing and missed cues. To be fair, there are a few magic moments, but only a few.
When Pink Floyd regrouped for ""Live 8"", they still had that powerful sound.  ELP in comparison sounded like a bad cover band.
I have heard others mention Keith was suffering from a bad hand. I can understand some changed tempo, but I think we would all be better off had they not done this show if Keith was not up to it. Enjoy the 1997 Montreaux DVD instead. That is ELP.",1348358400,3,657,4.053846153846154
4532789,5,B0052Y0FCC,"If you were ever a fan of Emerson, lake, and Palmer, this is a treasure to have. Forty years after the release of their self-titled first album, they reunite (after 12 years of not performing together) to create a one-off thank you to all of their fans. It is amazing to think that some of this music was created between thirty to forty years ago.

These three are the very best at what they do.
No one could touch the genius of keith Emerson and his magic talents on the keyboards. The fusion of classical, jazz, and rock. Here he is in his mid-sixties, as incredible as ever.
Carl Palmer delivers the inspired percussion that set this three member band apart from most others.
Greg Lake has matured in his voice. His voice is lower and deeper than in those early days, but the voice is still there, as is the talented guitar and bass. People forget the incredible songs he created like Lucky Man, From the Beginning, and so many more.

The chemistry, the energy, and the joy of being together is quite evident.

This is one of those DVDs that you can watch over and over again. It will bring you back to a time when the best music, and the best bands were not necessarilly in the top forty.",1335052800,5,1192,4.36036036036036
4532790,5,B0052Y0FCC,"I received my copy of the ELP (Everyone Loves Potatoes) concert and it was absolutly fabulous. I've seen these lads 5 times live over their career and they seem to get better every time. For not have played together for 12 years they out performed my expectations. Sure there were a couple minor (barely noticable fumbles), a very minor sound problem and gosh their voices have changes a bit because they're older but what the heck they are in their sixties.

I particularily enjoyed their interaction with the crowd. Over the years they've always been a bit reserved so it was great to her a bit of banter between eachother and their guests (us).

Truly memorable.",1329868800,,665,4.724137931034483
4532791,2,B0052Y0FCC,"Always loved these guys but age has taken it's toll...all the music has slowed down. Lake's voice is not what it use to be, Emerson's hands are no longer as dextrous, even Palmer's slowed down..I have great memories of ELP in their prime and that's how I choose to remember them.",1325116800,4,279,4.490196078431373
4532792,3,B0052Y0FCC,"I've been a huge fan of this band since the 1970's.  I own all of their albums as well as their other incarnations (Asia, 3, EL Powell).  I've seen them in various configurations many times.  Die hard fans will appreciate the show but this band's legacy should NOT be defined by this gig.  It's obvious that 2 of the original members are not up to par; Keith Emerson's medical (hands) issues have limited the once virtuosic and simply amazing performer to a shadow of himself and Greg Lake is simply now..... the BIGGEST front man in progressive rock.  He could play ""Pizza the Hut"" in a ""Spaceballs"" remake.  Carl Palmer's timing is a bit off too; apparently due to the short rehearsal time given to this gig and also because he's used to touring with two young kids in his own band who perform this material up to original speed and in that setting, he's fantastic (see his band if you can, and the venues are usually small so you get the up close and personal viewing treat of an all time great!).  The HD video is nice but the sound man at this gig should have been fired.  What a cluster eff given the money and people involved.

Basically, you get a small taste of what this act used to be but are slapped in the face by the reality of the aging process, the medical issues of Keith and the self induced sloth of Greg.  If you want to understand what this music used to be all about, you have several options.  (1) Listen to the records.  They set the standard of musicianship during that time period.

4532795,2,B0052Y0FCC,"I grew up as a 10 year old watching the Beatles on Ed Sullivan and have followed every rock band since. If ELP wasn't one of the biggest, best, bands of the early 70's they were close to it. Unfortunately this performance was horrible. As others have stated, miscues, sloppiness, bad timing, and sounding like they just got together after not playing for years makes it painful to watch. I've read they only had 2 weeks to practice for this show and it shows. As a musician who has played in bands my entire life, NOBODY can put together a tight group in 2 weeks. 3 months rehersal is the minimum before playing live in my opinion, and then fine tuning equipment, sound, lighting etc while playin out for several more months. THEN you make the video. Look at the ALLMAN BROS FILLMORE concert. Perfect, and that's because they spent the previous 1 YEAR on the road.
I loved ELP growing up and looked forward to seeing this BluRay concert. I still love them today. Unfortuneatly they were extremely dissapointing on this video only because they didn't rehearse enough to get tight. And now it lives forever on BluRay. That's sad. I'm sure the talent is still there, but they needed to put the effort in to get it done right, or don't put it out at all.",1321747200,6,1250,4.4868421052631575

Having seen them many many times throughout their incredible career, in their many incarnations ( e.g. ELPowell,3,Emerson-Lake 2 months prior to this show),I wish I had been there to see this one; for I believe this one-off reunion concert is also their SWAN SONG. Having only a couple of weeks to rehearse and get back in the groove again painfully shows here. There are missteps, missing notes,equipment malfunctions and a classic that's played an octave lower than it should have been. Having said that, the concert overall is worthy of a place in any ELP fans' collection. Just don't play ""Isle of Wight"", ""Cal Jam"" or ""Live in Montreaux '98"", then this one.

The show has great sound & the camera work is pretty good too . I really enjoyed seeing and hearing them together again and any ELP fan should feel the same way . Overall the concert was great the only thing being that Greg Lake's voice can't handle some of the delicate songs (Take a Pebble) and they should have figured away around that . Musically the band still turns me on . I don't think any longtime fan will be disappointed . Would love to see some touring , one can only hope !",1320019200,2,642,4.0234375

They were not tight at all - as if they hadn't even prepared for the show.  Emerson's playing was especially sloppy and off time often.  Palmer's playing was decent, and his usual flamboyant solo was up to par, but missing ques in the compositions due to the sloppiness of Emerson.  Lake wasn't even trying to hit notes higher than middle C.  I was very disappointed with this DVD, but now that I've seen it I don't feel so bad about my decision not to travel to the UK to see this show at the time which I had been tempted to do.",1319587200,12,644,4.333333333333333

4532801,3,B0052Y0FCC,"I have just about everything that has ever been released by ELP, except maybe those Manticore Bootleg releases from several years back.  I guess I'm not entirely compulsive about ELP, but they were always an important part of my life.

This concert was okay to watch. As always, Keith and Carl show a great deal of energy with their art of performance.  But, they did sound a little slower in their performance for this show, which is expected of any artist performing at their ages.  If they were to release this concert as a CD only, I would recommend that they speed up the tape a little bit.  Then, it would probably sound just fine.

I feel like I've really watched Greg Lake grow up.  I've seen his little changes in his appearance and his probably questionable health issues, all his life.  He was definitely a handsome young man in the early seventies.  I envied him, as well as admired him, back in his earlier days.  He was my hero, and I guess he still is.  I mean, we are all grower older, and some of us are a little thicker than we use to be.  So Greg, please, take care of yourself and get some exercise, and start eating right.  If you're hanging out with Steven Seagal and hitting up all those ""all you can eat"" buffets up the road, then you need to stop that. I could stand to lose about 20 pounds myself, but you should try to lose about 40.  I'm not criticizing you, Greg, I'm just concerned for you.  One day, you're not going to be able to perform because of your health, and that will be a sad day for all of us.

Anyway...

This concert did seem like they tried to stick to the limitations of what they've chose to do on stage for the last 20 years.  They always seem to open their show with ""Karn Evil 9"", a few of the same few songs that they feel are the fan's favorites, like ""Lucky Man"", ""Knife-Edge"", ""From The Beginning"", ""Tarkus"", ""Pictures At An Exhibition"", ""Take a Pebble"" and the such, and of course, they'll end the show with an extended take on ""Fanfare For The Common Man"" with a snippet from ""Rondo"" and Keith and Carl will do some stage theatrics to entertain the eyes as well as the ears of the audience.

Many of the songs here are the same songs on your Blu-Ray of ""Live at Montreux"" from 1997, so there really aren't any serious surprises here except maybe ""Bitches Crystal"", and ""The Barbarian.""

I have all known DVD's and most all CD's of ELP.  I've seen them live in Detroit twice in 1977.  First the Works Tour with the orchestra, then they returned as just the three in December of 1977.  Then I saw them in Sacramento in 1992 do their comeback ""Black Moon"" tour.  I even have a piece of Victory Records stationary with the signatures of all three of ELP.  I truly cherish this because this band is my life.  And they are the Godfathers of all Progressive Rock.

So....long live Emerson, Lake, and Palmer!",1318723200,29,2856,4.359848484848484

4532803,4,B0052Y0FCC,"I started watching this with some trepidation, after reading some of the negative reviews here. Yeah, I've known about Keith's hand-dexterity issues, and I'm well aware that Greg is as big as a house now, and has lost some of his vocal ability. At the same time, there isn't a lot of full-length video concerts of these guys, so I was thrilled to know that this was out. Sure, there are a few flubs...Greg's voice isn't what it once was...not everything is perfectly tight. But as Greg points out in the documentary, here they are at sixty-plus years old, playing complex music written and performed when they were in their twenties. Going into this with that conceit, I thoroughly enjoyed this concert. For the most part, these guys still perform near the top of their game, and yes, this is music that is often difficult technically, and would pose a threat to any musician half their ages. And to hear them do most of Tarkus, as well as the bulk of the first album was worth the admission alone. Sure, I wish there had been more from Trilogy and Brain Salad, but they apparently had to cut their set due to time constraints. Anybody who watches this expecting perfection from sixty-year old musicians who hadn't performed together for twelve years is giving this show short shrift! (And Carl Palmer?? Still the third greatest drummer in the world to me, behind just Neil Peart and Bill Bruford!)",1317427200,19,1398,4.686991869918699

I had the pleasure to see them at concert in Sao Paulo, Brazil, on 1993.
The picture of this BD was excellent, but I can't say the same about the sound.
It was so poor. I believe that the 40th anniversary should be commemorate

4532805,4,B0052Y0FCC,"To pull together 3 of the most innovative musicians for a '40 year' Anniversary concert was no small feat.  It has been 12+ years since ELP had played together, and while this filmed concert had it's share of typical live event problems, the guys really pulled off a great show.  It was great to see that legendary left hand of Keith's up close.  Carl was in top form, and though 'life' had filled out Greg some, the voice was spot on (unlike some senior rockers)  Had I known about this concert, I might have booked a flight to the UK. I have seen ELP every time they have been in the LA area since 1975.  Cal-Jam, Anaheim Convention Center (where I purchased 12 seats right in front of the FOH mixing desk and had to round up 11 friends to go with)  Last time was Irvine Meadows, where I introduced my kids to ELP.
The 'making of' video is a nice addition - explaining how this all come about.  I don't know if ELP will do anything like this concert again, but I thank them for doing this DVD.  It's so hard to describe their music and performance to those who have never experienced it.  It was great to see all varied ages in the audience - and all seemed to be very serious fans.
Technically, the video was well shot, but the Dolby 5.1 mix was a bit uninteresting. A dts or a Blu-ray disc with Dolby-HD would have been fun to listen to, as ELP have always been very inventive when it comes to their sound (live or in studio).
If you are an ELP fan, you need this DVD.  If you would like to see and hear 3 guys play really complex rock/jazz/classical based music with NO sequencers and NO auto-tune, check'em out. (The proof is the Moog Modular still can't stay in tune...)",1316476800,5,1677,4.261829652996846
4532806,4,B0052Y0FCC,"The band was offer the opportunity to play a reunion concert on this High Voltage festival where all began for them in 1970. So they accepted, even if they didn't play together for 12 years. They only had 5 days of rehersal, we know how it can be difficult to play on a open air festival and have a great sound. I didn't expect the band to play at his highest level as they did in the past, so i simply try to enjoy the show. First i had problem with the sound, it was so low that i have to put my volume up, and then i realise that it was a single audio-track 5.1 sound. For a Blu-Ray, you expect a DTS-HD sound, but i don't know why they didn't do it. The picture quality is excellent like we have never seen ELP in this kind of clarity. The band had some problem with their equipements, but never to a point of being a distraction from the overall performance, who was not perfect, but very enjoyable for any ELP fans. The band add a time constrained, so the concert was short (91 minutes).

There is also a 29 minutes interview with the band, some journalist and people who worked with the band. One interesting comment came from Greg Lake's mouth, when it said : ""if we had not took the orchestra turn, we could have made more innovative albums..."" The question is why they did that turn? A commercial move? And why they lost what it takes to make innovative albums when they came back as a trio with ""Love Beach"".",1316304000,4,1419,4.197802197802198

First, why not use Dolby TrueHD? A band such as ELP should have demanded it! In a way, not using the BEST quality audio was a blessing! The CROWD NOISE RUINED this show!!!!! These guys were meant to be enjoyed with NO outside noise. It's the WORSE BD I own; I would have given it zero stars if possible! I'll give it away to someone and even then I would feel as though I'm screwing them! SAVE your money for something good; there are many others out there that are good.

This concert is almost like they are just going through the motions. The miscues and lack of cohesion is disappointing. Granted...these songs are not a piece of cake and demand great musical strength and dexterity. Carl really needs to keep his shirt on at this stage (reminded me very much of Paulie ""Walnuts"" Gualtieri from the Sopranos)....Greg's vocal and intonation sounds fine......Keith is the master but sometimes I feel he is overplaying the set and struggles to get all the notes in. I thought the sound and video on the Blu-Ray were great! The performance is another story. Simply put, this is not the best representation of ELP.

The Blu-Ray version of their concert greatly lacks the visual quality one expects from the medium. The sound options are for 2.0 and 5.1 Dolby. Even when listened to via the 5.1 setting the sound was awful compared to the many other Blu-Ray concerts in my collection.

4532812,3,B0052Y0FCC,"I bought this DVD because of the positive reviews; I am not as happy with it as the others. It is clear that all them show signs of aging and a loss in their talent; however, considering they have been at the top of the musician's world, a loss in them still leaves them with plenty of musicianship to be admired. Greg Lake's voice is still admirable, though his highest range is gone; Keith Emerson's precision and mastership is not as crisp, though his flare, theatrically (and perhaps narcissism) still shines; Karl Palmer still displays the strength, power and coordination to put on a drum solo which many twenty somethings could envy.

Great concert. I was at the show and was about a dozen people in front of Greg. Brings back a lot of memories.
A shame Greg shouting ""Feedback, feedback, feedback"" has been cut during Tarkus due to well...feedback.
It's on the original High Voltage CD Soundboards and is now down in history on some ELP forums :)

Brilliant picture and just a shame they didn't apparently have time to do the planned encore of Pirates.
They had to cut their set short due to overuns by previous bands so I'm told.

4532815,5,B0052Y0FCC,"I have seen some other video of these guys and also bought the ELP Beyond the Beginning ripoff and none of them come close to this. The only thing better in some ways is their shortly filmed performance at Isle of Wight.

Song selection of this is good. Half of their first album and Bitches Crystal off of Tarkus are represented here. We also get Pictures at an Exhibition which is announced just like on the original live album of the same name. I have a few hundred concert DVDs but hardly any come close to two hours of solid well perfomed music.

Even Lucky Man is performed this time like it was on the original album complete with drums and the moog solo at the end (it stands out so much that I do dare call it a solo).

Very good and I thought Live at Montreaux was going to be the last. I just have to thank these guys for putting this on at their ages. Carl Palmer is very fit and Emerson looks better than I have seen him before. Except for Lake, these guys almost appear more youthful than at the beginning of the Black Moon era.

Greg, I am sorry but you need to start pedaling that bike old man. I love your voice from the early years and you try very hard here and do achieve for the most part. If you were 100 pounds lighter I know you would blow everyone else away but good enough for me on this performance.

I do really respect Lake and do not mean to appear cruel here but when you have gifted talent like him, I believe you should hone yourself like a marble statue. Palmer is a very solid skinsman and has amazed over the years, he always been consistent.

And finally after years of pondering, who is better; Emerson or Wakeman? A hundred years from now, the music of Wakeman will thrill the ears of many but he will sound like lots of others and will be confused with other composers and keyboardists.

Emerson takes keyboards, turns them into instruments of rock and roll and plays classically tinged music on them. His playing will never be confused with anyone elses.",1314576000,63,1995,4.289893617021277

Anyone who has heard that their performance was less than expected needs to buy this DVD and judge for yourselves. Given the difficulty of their material, practicing for only two weeks prior to the show, not playing as ELP for 12 years and having their set time squeezed by the prior ""warm up"" band, I think the guys did fantastic. If you couldn't make the show this DVD is a close second. If you did go you might see yourself in the audience (hope you were up close)!",1314403200,4,576,4.293577981651376

Staged at the High Voltage Festival London in 2010 for their 40th Anniversary reunion. Doing a show of this proportion in an outdoor venue is definately not the norm for ELP. The audience was not your typical aging baby boomer crowd, I was surprised at how youthful the crowd was. This DVD has exceptionally clean and crisp audio and video. Great camera angles, the special effects and lighting are second to none. The overall performance makes this a spectacular show. The set list is excellent. This show just seems to keep gaining momentum, and literally goes out with a BANG with the pyrotechnics at the end! I hope this was not their last performance.

The song listing is the same as the double disc CD that came out late last year. You can still hear the squeals and screeches that were heard on the CD. However, the squeals do not seem as annoying to me on this DVD. It's not a perfect concert. It does have its mistakes. The picture quality is suberb, with the images clear and crisp. Really nice use a camera angels make this show all the more pleasing to the eye. Great lighting as well. Nice visuals. Additionally, the color schemes are very good. According to the info on Amazon the single disc runs 210 min., however that is not correct. A bit of a typo, I'm afraid. Total time is 120 minutes. The concert runs 91:45, and the new documentary runs 28:15. The documentary consists of Emerson, Lake & Palmer along with the live concert director, the DVD editor, and the producer as they talk about various ELP related topics. The documentary is not one of those discussions with all the participants sitting around some table, instead each person is at a different location, interviewed, then edited as a whole piece. It is well done, though at this moment I've only seen a quick sampling of it. This concert may indeed be their last. Highly recommended for any music fan.",1314403200,62,1338,4.487704918032787

8454769,5,B0052Y0FCC,"People get old.  Bodies get stiff.  Voices change.  What was once limber and flexible becomes much less agile and fluid.  Taking all THAT into account this is a pretty good disc.  No it wouldn't be a 5-star performance for a bunch of 20 somethings, but for folks on the high-side of their 60s who had a pretty decent career of making great music (with a few clunkers, I'll admit), this is a nice send-off recording of the band (especially given it was a one-off performance, as I understood it).

Positives?
- The video and sound quality in bluray.  Great picture and great sound.
- Some interesting tweaks to the standard ELP arrangements.  Nice that they changed up some of it, though I expect part of that was out of necessity
- There is a certain positive energy with this performance that was lacking in some other videos of ELP gigs (likely because they weren't fed up with touring with each other yet)
- It's just a another chance to enjoy a band I like quite a bit

Negatives?
- Yep, the band and the performance is a little rusty in places, despite that energy in the performance
- The arrangements are a little over-simplified in places

It's only fitting that ELP's final show would be in front of a huge outdoor crowd since they started at the Isle of Wight and then headlined at California Jam.",1487203200,,325,4.344262295081967
8454776,5,B0052Y0FCC,Great video. I have been looking for any ELP music since the passing of Keith Emerson and Greg Lake. If you are looking for a great concert this will fill the bill,1485820800,,163,4.125
