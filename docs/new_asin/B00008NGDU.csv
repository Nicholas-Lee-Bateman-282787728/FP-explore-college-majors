7985655,4,B00008NGDU,I wish they made more movies like this. Twisted with heart. Production is not great in some parts but I love Jeff Fahey. Also check out Lawnmower Man.,1472947200,,150,4.392857142857143

Jeff Fahey seems to have a gift for portraying these innocents convincingly.  Joseph finds what I can only call his salvation in Beth, who agrees with him on the purpose of killing, and seems a bit more sane, maybe.  She grounds him and gives him a purpose.  Joseph was not insane, he had a clear reason for doing the things he did, but his handicap saved him from the needle.

The cover art and description led me to believe that the movie was going to be a gore fest.  A gore fest for simple gore fest's sake is a waste of time.  A bit of ""gore with a purpose"" comes across quite differently.  There are the right ones to kill and the wrong ones.  When the right ones get it, it somehow feels good.

Production quality was better than many of Fahey's movies.  The humor fit perfectly.

The superhuman strength was one stretch I couldn't make.  However, this was not meant to be a true-story-documentary, was it?

In the final analysis, after seeing Joseph's last scene in the movie, you are suddenly stricken to realize that this is, in reality, A CHICK FLICK!

Every woman wants the kind of devotion and adoration Joseph gave Beth.  I got the impression that his effect on her was just as profound.  A movie ""he"" and ""she"" could both enjoy - together.",1233446400,,1347,4.4105691056910565
7985657,2,B00008NGDU,"My friend insisted that I watch this... he has a crush on the now deceased Kelly Waymire who appears in this film.  The movie has the schizophernic quality to it.  One minute, the production value is okay and the story line seems okay... the next your watching an awful student film.  Jeff Fahey and Kelly W, provide the only solid performances as convicts in a private correctional facility.  The rest of the performances are uninteresting or just plain laughable (especially the warden and the 'matron')  The plot revolves around Joe and Beth (Jeff Fahey and Kelly W.) as they break out (and break back in) prison.  This mess has alot of ""you can't be serious... your filming this?' moments.  Out of respect to my friend's choice, I didn't tear this movie a new one, but it really deserves it.  The plot isn't so bad... the way its broken up into ""acts"" is kinda neat... but the glaring plot holes and production shortages are just too numerous to give this thing anymore stars.  If this thing had about 5-10 million more added to it... it could have made for a good movie.",1152144000,,1075,4.5863874345549736
