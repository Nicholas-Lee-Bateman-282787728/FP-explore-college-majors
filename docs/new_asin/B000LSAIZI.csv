2713126,5,B000LSAIZI,"We got this for our 14-month-old son.  He had already learned a few signs at day care and with us but only about 3 before he saw the DVD.  We watched this with him on the day it arrived.  He was absolutely riveted.  He laughed at the puppets and paid close attention.  He watched it all the way through - and 30 minutes is an amazing length of time to hold his attention at this age.  Within a few days, he was signing more words.  This DVD definitely enhanced our communication with our son by helping him and us know more signs.

As an adult watching it, I found it very well done also.  My husband and I both learned signs we didn't know and we're using them routinely now.  The teaching method involves a great pattern of doing the sign, saying the word and showing the word.  For example, they say, ""baby"" and do the sign for baby, then they show a baby (no speaking or signing), then they do the sign for baby and show a baby, then they show a baby and say ""baby,"" etc.

Marlee Matlin was excellent - great energy and very fun with the puppets.  The parents with their children were also nice.  And having the children do the signs was wonderful - my son found that totally enthralling.",1175212800,12,1192,4.24
2713127,2,B000LSAIZI,"I checked out Signing Time DVDs from the local library for my daughter.  She LOVES them.  I thought she would like this too.  She does, but not me.  I agree with another reviewer about the ""filler""--too much time showing the pictures but not enough for the signs.  The music and scenes make it somewhat entertaining for little kids, like other Baby Einstein DVDs, but not very educational.  So if you shopping for DVDs teaching sign language, there are better options.",1174780800,14,468,4.7875
2713128,2,B000LSAIZI,"I have taught all of my hearing grandchildren to sign and I was hopeful that this third DVD in the Baby Einstein ""language series"" would be added to our language library.  Although the word selection is better than the previous two videos in this series, I was disappointed with the format.

The format does not hold the attention of my grandchildren and it is does not offer the repetition necessary to learn spoken words or sign language.  Several words and signs are presented in rapid succession followed by extended scenes for each word. Then the same words and signs are presented again by a child who is clearly old enough to be speaking.  The program also lacks a tutorial for grandparents and parents who are teaching their babies to use sign language for the first time.

All of my grandchildren have learned to sign and speak from the ""My Baby Can Talk"" series and I would recommend this series for babies who cannot yet speak or are just learning to speak.",1174608000,41,968,4.637426900584796
2713129,3,B000LSAIZI,"This video is more of a typical Baby Einstein video with a few signs thrown in here and there. They don't teach the signs, just show them quickly, followed by pictures of what the signs mean. Way more ""filler"" than signs, which was disappointing. It's a cute video, but I think there are much better signing videos out there. Baby Signing Times for example.",1174521600,6,357,4.59375
2713130,5,B000LSAIZI,"Here's the idea: a video for toddlers age 6 months and up that teaches them sign language, so they can communicate ""mommy,"" ""daddy,"" ""kiss,"" ""baby"" and ""I love you"" before they can talk. If that alone doesn't melt your heart -- if your mouse hasn't yet forced itself over to that ""Add to Shopping Cart"" button -- then here's a brief description of what you get.

Hosted by Marlee Matlin, this sweet 30-minute video uses puppets, live-action video, stills and children to teach the signs for 20 words. The signs are easy to learn, as the videos really drive home their message. For each word, Matlin demonstrates a sign, then video images reinforce it. For example, for the word ""kiss"" a 30-second video shows a girl kissing her mom, a boy kissing his dad, another dad and son doing the sign together, a painting of a mom kissing her infant, then more video clips of moms and dads kissing their kids, then the sign again, then a boy kissing his big stuffed dog, then a girl kissing her grandmother, then a little girl kissing her doll's baby bunny! There is no narration, in fact no spoken dialogue at all except for the words themselves. Other words include ""cereal,"" ""milk,"" ""eat,"" ""drink,"" ""play,"" ""help,"" ""friend,"" ""ball,"" ""sleep,"" ""bath,"" ""story,"" ""blanket,"" ""please"" and ""thank you.""

The production values are first-rate. Everything is well-lit and in focus; the clean sets are simple yet vibrant. And the sign language is the real deal: a combination of American Sign Language (ASL) and Conceptually Accurate Signed English.

There's no Scene Selection, so you can't cherry-pick favorite words to play, but a two-minute bonus feature (Sign with Me) reviews them all, and Matlin appears on two one-minute features with some additional words (including ""happy,"" ""sad,"" ""potty,"" ""sorry"" and ""love""). Other bonus features include five cute puppet shows (three minutes total).

All of these Baby Einstein videos are so good  -- so gentle, colorful and interactive, with nothing but positive messages -- that it's easy to forget that, technically, kids shouldn't be watching them. That the best way to promote ""proper brain development"" in kids under 2, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics, is ""talking, playing, singing and reading together."" But during those times you can't be actively engaged with your child (let's see, that would include cooking, cleaning, laundry...) the series is a great way to give your rugrat a rewarding experience. Plus, you are supposed to be watching this WITH your child. And it's only 30 minutes (though the menu does include a ""Repeat Play"" option).

Does it actually work? Absolutely, especially if you watch it together. Even if your child doesn't learn anything, you'll be there smiling at his or her happy little face, talking, playing and singing together... it's just what the doctor ordered!",1174089600,106,2846,5.031847133757962

Having raised children since 1988, I can say with assurance that this is the only DVD I have ever seen that holds the attention of a baby, starting at 3 months of age. My grandson dislikes everything but this. He is 11 months old now and starting to sign. I love this. It is also not annoying for the adults in the house.

2713150,5,B000LSAIZI,"I like a lot of baby Einstein products, this one is no different. My son picked up sign language very quickly and allowed him to communicate before he was talking. It was truly a life saver, as my son was a late talker and was getting very frustrated that he couldn't communicate. Starting sign language helped to promote talking and he transitioned to talking soon after learning to sign.",1436227200,,389,4.6521739130434785

2713163,5,B000LSAIZI,One of our favorite Baby Einstein videos. The signs are very clear. They are shown many times with examples because repetition is so key for little ones. All the signs are ones we actually are learning to use!,1416096000,,209,4.526315789473684

2713170,3,B000LSAIZI,"First of all, the seller said it was like new.  Nope, not even close.  Anyhow, as for the dvd itself, it does teach some signs, but the main reason I wanted it was to find out how to start to teach signs to my baby.  It doesn't even touch on that.",1403654400,,247,3.803921568627451
2713171,5,B000LSAIZI,"whoever has children ,parents and grandparents. this DVD is excellent for different age groups. I would recommend to any one.",1399075200,,125,5.3

2713175,4,B000LSAIZI,"My daughter signs already, due to Signing Time and Baby Signing Time. When I got this video I was excited to see how she would react to it. It has a lot of the same signs as Baby Signing Time but is not as interesting as the teaching sections are very much a memorization lesson. At 14 months she did pick up new signs from this video and that is exciting.

Things I like:
Music/Pictures to draw baby's attention
New signs for little one
Clear Words visually and verbally

Dislike:
Shows too many signs at once, confusing baby
No order to signs or grouping
No grouping to make it easier for baby to assimilate signs into daily world

I would recommend this video to young children. However, it does not hold my little one's attention as long as I would have liked. It is one of our favorite of the Baby Einstein video series. We recently passed on to my sister and she enjoys it as well.",1393632000,,887,4.299401197604791
2713176,5,B000LSAIZI,My toddler and I had lots of fun learning signs.  It was easy. It made communicating with my non verbal child so much easier.,1391126400,,125,4.208333333333333
2713177,4,B000LSAIZI,My grandson likes the informational characters displayed by the actors in performing the basic sign language words.  He loves to watch the toddlers performing the sign language.,1390176000,,177,5.555555555555555

2713179,3,B000LSAIZI,"Some of the signs are too complicated to be First Signs.  This video is sort of mind numbing, so its probably best to put on when parent needs to cook or otherwise distract child.  The video was most helpful getting me to learn the signs. It does not seem to hold the attention of my daughter.  We bought this when she was 11 months old, she is 13 months old now and still really isn't captured by it.  The signs she does know she learned by watching me and having me reinforce in our day to day lives.",1386806400,,502,4.091836734693878

The dvd covers to teach basic needs in sign language, my baby is only 3 months but already watched so when she is around 8 months her brain will be more familiarized with the signs and she will be able to communicate.
my older son learned it too, specially when his grandpa is actually deaf, makes him proud.",1377648000,,386,4.301369863013699

2713190,3,B000LSAIZI,"Not nearly as captivating to my baby as ""My baby can talk"" videos. I do like that they showed ""Please and thank you"" in a little skit. My daughter has learnt over ten signs from my baby can talk videos and no signs from baby Einstein video. She doesn't get excited for it either. I do like the signs they teach though, perhaps can be considered more useful than the my baby can talk ones.",1359158400,,388,4.1866666666666665

She caught on after about 3 weeks. by 6 months she learned most of them. and now she uses them to tell me what she wants. I recommend it to all parents for babies and kids and yourself.

2713194,5,B000LSAIZI,Video is simple and has good repetition which is good for children catch on quickly.  When toddlers start to talk and it is all gobbley gook it is easier to understand and communicate when they sign their words as well.  I greatly recommend,1351382400,,240,4.558139534883721
2713195,5,B000LSAIZI,My grandson has been learning sign language since birth and this was really helpful to him and myself as I am trying to learn along with him. It is something we can watch together and sign along.,1347840000,,195,4.297297297297297
2713196,4,B000LSAIZI,"The video covers simple words including eat, friend, mommy, daddy, play, sleep, ball, cereal, milk, drink, more, baby, blanket, and bath, stop, and go. After watching this twice in a row the first day and twice in a row the second day, my son said the words play and mommy and signed the word friend, for the first time! After his 5th time watching he was able to sign blanket and bath. My only complaint (and reason why it gets 4 stars) is that no one in the video is shown SAYING the words. This video uses an unseen narrator, so you do hear the word and see it written on the screen in nice big font, and see children and parents signing, which is wonderful. My son needs to read lips as well as hear the word. I understand this video used deaf children/parents, I just wish they had included at least one or two hearing people who could say the words with a close-up of their mouths. I ordered a baby babble dvd as well so hopefully that will help my son a little more with his specific needs. This is a great video for deaf or hearing kids to learn simple sign language, and it's one of the few videos my 21 month old will pay attention to (he prefers this to Sesame Street!). The way I use the video is I have my son sit in my lap and I move his hands and say the word when it appears on the screen. Sometimes his daddy sits in front of him and signs the word and says the word as well, so my son is able to see people on TV and up close signing the word, while having his hands moved in the correct way. This is an extremely effective method, I didn't expect the results to be so fast. My sister in law is buying this for my 6 month old niece.",1329609600,,1650,4.033536585365853
2713197,5,B000LSAIZI,"I love this DVD and so does our 7-month-old son! It's so cute. He is too young to practice the signs just yet, but he watches the DVD at least once a day, every day. It's short enough to keep his attention the whole time and he actually giggles with the puppets. My sister-in-law uses Baby Signing Time DVD's with her children 2 and 3 year olds, but our baby hasn't really shown an interest in those. I think this Baby Einstein singing DVD is geared more for the little, little ones and is a perfect introduction to basic signs. I'm sure his brain is processing the information and within time we'll see results. :)",1322524800,2,615,4.356521739130435

I read that some parents complain that Baby Einstein videos are too short...too boring, etc. I think that this is the whole idea...not to overload those developing brains...sometimes I think that even Sesame Street is too much for very young babies and toddlers...and kid's shouldn't spend all day in front of TV anyways...I let her watch it once in the morning and once in the evenining and that's it!  No more TV.",1319155200,,623,4.822429906542056

2713200,5,B000LSAIZI,I first bought this DVD for my nephew when he was 6 months old (now 8 years old). I took sign language 1 year in middle school and 4 years in high school so was fluent in signing. This DVD was a ton of fun and he learned very quickly and still knowns most of the signs today. I will be purchasing a new DVD for my now 2 month old daughter very soon due to the fact that I've lost the other because it was so long ago!! I can't wait to get started with her!!!,1313366400,,458,3.731958762886598
2713201,5,B000LSAIZI,I got a real kick out of the CD myself. I look forward to more Signing CD's in the future for my daughter through Amazon. I love this CD and it was so worth it. thank you for a wonderful sale.,1310256000,,192,3.707317073170732
2713202,5,B000LSAIZI,"Hi Everyone, my son is 4 months and this video really engages him. I actually looked at several different videos online before choosing this one. I liked the adorable puppets, and was not disappointed. Actually a friend had recommended this video to me, and my son was getting bored, so I gave it a try. He loves watching this and I can almost hear his cogwheels turning. You will be glad you got this, it gives you some peace of mind that you aren't wasting his brain cells by putting him/her in front of a tv.",1307577600,,511,4.333333333333333
2713203,5,B000LSAIZI,"I rented this video through Netflix and decided I had to have my own copy. There is just enough talking to say what the signs are but mostly relies on images to teach signs. Great for your first signing DVD and also for deaf or hearing impaired kids. The video is simple and easy for my 9 month old to follow. He loves the puppets and squeals when he sees them. They teach eat/hungry, drink, milk, more, play, friend, ball, tired/sleep, mom, dad, kiss, blanket, bath, baby, and probably some more that I can't remember right now. There are also several other signs used once but are not necessarily part of the curriculum. I really like this DVD.",1305676800,,646,4.483050847457627

Our neighbor who also has a little girl owned this and I was surprised to see both of the girls absorbed in ""My First Signs"" Not only was it fun for them to watch, it has a lot of useful signs that helped them communicate better before they could talk. (Useful for the parents to watch as well)",1304035200,,388,4.1866666666666665
2713205,5,B000LSAIZI,"I searched for a long time to find a sign language video that had useful signs for a young child to learn.  Many videos taught you how to say things like ""airplane,"" animal signs, or other non-essential words. I didn't feel these words were as useful as words that expressed her needs/desires.  I wanted something that would facilitate communication and express needs before she was able to do so verbally.  This video teaches words like ""Mommy,"" ""Daddy,"" ""milk,"" ""blanket,"" and many more useful words.  Our daughter loves this video.  She is entertained by the puppets and is picking up the language.  This is a fabulous video for anyone that wants their children to learn words that express their needs/desires through sign language.",1302307200,,735,4.983606557377049

2713208,5,B000LSAIZI,"This is a MUST BUY! for all parents. My daughter and I started watching this dvd a few months ago, when she was 8 months old. At first, she didn't really understand anything going on, but would laugh when the blue guy and the duck would do funny stuff. Now that she is a year old, my daughter is able to understand a few of the basic signs. She still hasn't quite figured out how to sign for herself, but if I sign something, then she does understand. It has been a great tool in helping me communicate more easily with my daughter.",1289174400,,532,4.174757281553398
2713209,5,B000LSAIZI,"We first offered this to our daughter at about age 6 months,  but she wasn't as interested in it as she was with her Baby Mozart, Beethoven, etc.  However, she developed more interest at about 10 months, when she became more ""verbal"".  Although she never really uses the signs on their own to communicate with us, she began verbalizing the words first by identifying the objects (Mommy, Daddy, baby, cereal, ball, etc.) whenever she saw them, and then using the sign while verbalizing.  She often starts the ""sign game"" by calling out words and signing them back and forth with us.  She also responds appropriately to us when we sign instructions to her (e.g., ""sleep"", ""eat"", ""drink"").  This DVD still holds her attention, with its clever use of calm but happy  music, and puppet shows in between the signing sequences. We also get more use out of it by using the Bonus Features to learn additional words, or for a quick viewing of puppet shows only.  As with the other Baby Einstein DVDs that we own, we also enjoy the diversity of children in the scenes so that all children will ""see themselves"" when watching this. This was a great addition to our daughter's library.",1284508800,2,1172,4.682926829268292
2713210,5,B000LSAIZI,"My daughter is 10 months old.  I bought this DVD earlier today because we're going on a trip where we'll be in an airplane and I wanted a DVD to entertain her during the flight (without sound).  Baby Einstein products (i.e. play mat) have been a good standby and I've been trying to use sign language, so this seemed like a good choice.

This evening she has been very sick with a stomach virus (she threw up 4 times today) so I caved and popped the DVD in instead of waiting until the flight since she's just been laying in my arms.  She is usually not a cuddler and is very active (already walking).  Much to my amazement, I was rewarded by laughter *every* time the puppets made an appearance!  I give the DVD 5 stars just for making this very sick gal laugh.  Also, it seems to cover the most useful signs (milk, eat, more, bath, sleep, mommy, daddy, ball, story, baby) and I like the way they repeat the signs and show different images of people/babies/children signing followed by the thing they are signing about.  Seems like a good learning DVD, especially if you watch it with your baby and use the signs and say the words during the DVD as well as during the day with context.",1282780800,,1186,4.359090909090909

2713218,5,B000LSAIZI,"First, this dvd is a great tool for parents wanting to sign with their children. The words taught are words that you would use every day (sleep, mom, dad, eat, water). Different children and adults perform each sign and there are different pictures showing the word.

As for the reviews that said this will hurt your child's language development - studies have actually shown that signing will help your child with their language development. If you are teaching your child to sign, you are saying the word as you sign it. When your child is able to start speaking, many of the words they first say are words they have signed. Children that learned to sign as infants/toddlers have larger vocabularies and better comprehension as they get older. If you are not constantly talking to your child, that is when their language development will be delayed. As you watch any dvd with your child, you should be talking with them about the dvd. Dvd's are not babysitters. When my daughter and I watch this particular dvd, I am signing with it, and working on her hands to make the correct shape, talking about the word, the sounds in the word, and the pictures on the screen. As I spend the day with my daughter, I sign while I speak and show her the signs to words I want her to grasp (eat, milk). She is starting to sign because of the interaction her father and I do and she is only 8 months old.",1239408000,,1391,4.4763779527559056
2713219,5,B000LSAIZI,"My 18 month old loves this video every time I play it.

All very helpful.",1238630400,,321,4.278688524590164
2713221,5,B000LSAIZI,"I also love that it has the option of Spanish and French. So, you don't just hear and see the signs, but the words come up in the languge that you choose. I agree with a previous reviewer that there should be a library of additional volumes with advanced signs.",1237939200,,261,4.24
2713222,5,B000LSAIZI,This is another excellent DVD in the Baby Einstein line of videos.  It is exceptionally entertaining and educational.  I was worried that the signs would break up the entertainment value too much however I was wrong.  My daughter loves it and this video lives up to the Baby Einstein high standards.

The music is less upbeat and just doesn't seem to grab her attention like some other videos.  The signs are however great signs to start with, the interaction between babies, kids and parents is great for her to see.  When you read a book to a child, you have to read it with a bit of enthusiasm.  The DVD just doesnt have that extra kick to it.",1228003200,,614,4.407079646017699

2713235,2,B000LSAIZI,"It is my own fault for not doing the research ahead of time on this. I bought the item in the rush of being a new parent and should have stopped and thought about what I was doing. My clarity came while watching the video. Almost immediately I realized my mistake and knew that this is not what I wanted my child exposed to. The video was returned and I have since purchased the Garcia Baby Signs book and corresponding DVD for the parents, and am pleased with it.

Children should not be plopped down in front of a TV as a learning tool. It's nothing more then memorization and skips the development that is critical to a full education. Sure they're quiet for a bit and you do see some small improvements, but the damage that you do to their overall learning abilities negates those small returns.

For those of you who will immediately claim that I am so lunatic who is citing garbage research, please see a small sample of what I read below:

""The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has recommended that children younger than 24 months of age not be exposed to television."" From Anderson, Pempek. Television and Very Young Children. American Behavioral Scientist. 2005; 48: 505-522

It would be nice if signing could be taken for granted and included in children's programing as a matter of course.  Our granddaughter does now look for hands to mean something and Signing seems to be a stronger language for her than verbal instruction.  She usually smiles when she signs to us because for her it seems to be both a game and powerful. ""Adults"" get it when she signs.  This DVD did make a huge difference getting her started.  We have a deaf daughter (25) so it is important in our family to have these materials around for everybody.  This DVD was a positive fun start that made an immense change immediately for her at only 10-12 months.",1184544000,2,1011,4.54696132596685
2713254,5,B000LSAIZI,"This is an excellent introduction to using sign language to communicate with your baby.  It is so entertaining that my 14 month old son can sit still and watch a lot at a time.  And what is more, its not obnoxious, so you as a parent will delightfully watch and learn in tandem with your child.",1183766400,,294,4.232142857142857
2713255,2,B000LSAIZI,"It is impressive how my son, now 15 months, gets completely absorbed with all the Baby Einstein products my wife and I have previously purchased (My First Moves, Neighborhood Animals, Baby Beethoven, Baby Mozart). With this one, though (which by the way said was precisely for children in that age range), his attention was only captured for the first 5 minutes. Analyzing it from a non-target customer standpoint, I think it is not in the same category as the other ones I've seen, quality wise. Maybe my expectations were too high but I can honestly say I was a little disappointed with this product. Maybe someone can recommend other BE products that are as good as the others. Thanks.",1182988800,9,688,4.7899159663865545
2713256,5,B000LSAIZI,"My 6 month old loves to watch this video. He hasn't started using any signs yet, but i believe it is never too early to start learning. He sits in his high chair and will watch the whole video. The video is designed well to teach vocabulary and signing, and there is great, peaceful music throughout. I hope Baby Einstein comes out with a new signing video soon so we can use it to learn more signs.",1182470400,,399,4.194805194805195

Just wish the would have told us old folks,we could't understand & she was not happy. We now have both the other kids,and grandma & granpa are learning it to. I wish they had this back when we raised our boys. It's the closest thing to instructions for kids you'll ever find. Will be getting them all to passaround.",1180569600,,474,4.21978021978022

She already knows all the signs in it and uses them regularly.  My younger daughter (15 months) also loves the videos and is just beginning to use the signs.  I feel good about putting on a video that I know she's learning stuff from.  If you're looking for more sign videos from baby einstein try ""Baby's Favorite Places Around Town"" and ""Baby Wordsworth"", both of those have been great too.",1178928000,,539,4.505154639175258

2713272,4,B000LSAIZI,Fairly decent CD but would be better to buy a book to also teach your child such as sign with your baby by Joseph Garcia.,1178928000,,121,3.88
2713273,5,B000LSAIZI,"I purchased My First Signs for my nephew when he was 5 months old.  It is a great movie for parent/child (family member/child) interaction.  He immediately recognized that I was parroting the signs from the television screen, and attempted in his own "" I am still working on my fine motor skills"" way.  You can definately see the familiarity in his face when we play it.",1178668800,,370,4.575757575757576

2713275,5,B000LSAIZI,"I really like the format of the video, the way it teaches a few signs in a group, shows the concept in many different ways and then moves on to another group of signs.  My son, who has Down Syndrome, is almost 2 and he loves to watch this video because of all of the children and babies they feature!  His therapists have encouraged us to teach him sign language and this just might be the perfect tool for doing so!",1178496000,,416,4.1234567901234565

2713277,5,B000LSAIZI,I purchased this DVD for my 2 1/2 year old.  She loves Baby Wordsworth but I found that one to be long with too many signs.  This DVD offers an intro to sign language with a few signs per catagory.  My daughter picked up the signs within one viewing.  I reccomend this one over Baby Wordsworth as a starter.  Get Baby Wordsworth a little later when attention spans are a bit longer.,1178409600,2,382,4.25
2713278,5,B000LSAIZI,My daughter LOVES this DVD and beyond its entertainmkent value she has learned a great deal from it. I started teaching my daughter sign language at a year old and she knew a very limited number of signs. Once we got the DVD she's taken off! Now she communicates daily with signs and it has made life easier for all of us! Whenever she wants to watch it she points at the TV and then does the sign for baby. This DVD is a hit!,1178409600,,426,4.023529411764706
2713279,3,B000LSAIZI,"This video teaches some good first signs, but there is so much filler and that time could be spent in better ways. This video will achieve its goal, but it is not as efficient as others.  Check out Signing Time instead.  They have a 2 series Baby Signing Time that goes over many more useful signs that you and your baby will need. They also have a children's geared 13 volume series that my baby has been watching since 7 months.  Signing Time often played on PBS for free.",1177718400,63,474,4.303370786516854
2713280,5,B000LSAIZI,"I am gathering educational toys and books for our daughter to use with her in working on developmental milestones.

There is a lot of literature out that suggests signing is an excellent way to communicate with baby, and by using ASL you are giving your child a life skill that could be helpful when they get older as well.

I was really trying to stay away from DVD's because I think that kids get too sucked into TV nowadays.  However, books don't cut it with sign language.  It is much more helpful to see the signs demonstrated repeatedly by people who know what they are doing.  And Marlee Matlin is the best model for signing that they could have chosen for this DVD.

This DVD is engaging.  The filming is of good quality, it shows the signs in context with imagery between each of the ""lessons"".  And throughout the show, there are little puppet skits which kind of go with the show but also, in my opinion, provide a little break from the learning to keep the kids engaged.

I have watched other ""Einstein"" videos where I stopped and asked myself ""What WAS that supposed to be, they wanted HOW MUCH money for THAT?"".  However, that was not the case with this video.  My daughter and I enjoyed it and we are learning something useful together.

The only improvement I could think of would be to make subsequent volumes of videos like this with expanded vocabulary.  This particular video only covers very basic words such as mother, father, kiss, more, sleep, baby, blanket, and a few others.  I think the content is just right for a ""First Signs"" video.  And I don't think a small child's attention span could take much more than this at one time.  But it would be nice if they offered a library of progressively advancing signs on other discs.

I would highly recommend this DVD to parents interested in signing with their children.",1176768000,29,1842,4.567073170731708

I should have known that it would be just like all the other Baby Eintein videos...very poorly put together.  The signs are not shown enough for an infant or toddler to grasp them.  There are too many ""filler"" scenes and pictures.  It also did not hold my son's attention.  I have heard very good things about the ""Signing Time"" videos.  I found out that our public television station is going to start showing them beginning in April 07.  I am going to record them and watch them with my son.
