480510,4,6302510007,"There's a lot to say about the eighth Bond film.  Obviously, it begins the Moore era of Bond films; the stunts are more ridiculous, the women are sexist comic relief, the chase scenes are laughably absurd.  Connery's world-weary double-fisted agent gives way to the slick '70s playboy superspy.  The Moore Bond films are about over-the-top toungue-in-cheek fun.  Why go looking for anything more in them?
For one thing, LIVE AND LET DIE actually introduces one of the most developed and compelling of the Bond girls, Jane Seymour's impeccably-played Solitaire.  A fantastical character with profoundly weird motivations and supernatural powers is portrayed with a depth and humanity that contradicts the above stereotype of the Moore films.  Another actor turns in a great performance; with minimal screen time Roy Stewart manages to do justice to DR. NO's Quarrel.  Yaphet Kotto's villain, too, is interesting and even textured, accentuating the absurdity of the explosive way he is dispatched.  The extremely long speedboat chase puts to shame DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER's moon-buggy silliness.
That said, there are ways in which L&LD is problematic.  It is obviously a reaction to the success of the Blaxploitation films, which themselves often borrowed from the Bond series.  L&LD, with Harlem and New Orleans as background, makes heavy use of the cars, costumes and conflicts around drugs of the Blaxploitation genre.  In absorbing these tropes, however, the roles are reversed; the corrupt authoritarians and gangsters are Carribean and African-American, while it is the European who knows what is best and saves the day.  The cultural stereotyping doesn't end there.  Clifton James overacts every Southern cop cliche with his Sherrif J.W. Pepper character, an incidental role which wastes so much screen time one will be reaching for the ""fast-forward"" button.
Enjoying L&LD demands, in its way, a certain kind of tolerance, both for the emerging goofiness brought into the Bond films in the '70s and for sitting through the sexism, racism and colonialism of this particular episode.  For someone with that tolerance, there are a number of thoroughly enjoyable moments in this installment.  Those looking for a more serious Bond, however, should look earlier in the series, or later.",1051142400,,2284,5.340782122905028
480511,2,6302510007,"I never saw LIVE AND LET DIE when it was released in 1973. Now, thirty years later, I have the disquieting thought, ""Might I have loved it back then?"" Surely not. But what will I think thirty years hence of Pierce Brosnan's recent Bond films, some of which I regard with a modicum of favor? There's a good chance I'll be dead and won't suffer embarrassment.
In this 007 thriller of the post-Connery era, Roger Moore plays James Bond up against the evil drug lord Kananga (Yaphet Kotto), who's already managed to liquidate three British agents. Kananga lurks behind a voodoo facade, and his own actions are guided by Tarot cards dealt by Solitaire (Jane Seymour, in her film debut). The ostensible locale of much of the action is the Caribbean, perhaps so the solitary, bikinied Bond Babe can avoid goosebumps.
LIVE AND LET DIE has the quality of a made-for-TV-movie, and not a very good one at that. The gadgetry is minimal, the acting sometimes deplorable, and the one extended chase sequence remarkably soporific. Roger Moore is no better than third behind Connery and Brosnan as the intrepid and resourceful Commander. Kotto as Kananga is uninspired. And the caricature of a southern sheriff by Clifton James is both unnecessary and excruciatingly overacted. Perhaps the only reason to see LIVE AND LET DIE is Jane Seymour, who is, in my opinion, one of the most exquisitely beautiful actresses ever to grace the Big Screen. And animal lovers will enjoy the plethora of snakes, sharks and crocodiles.",1049328000,8,1503,4.875
480512,4,6302510007,"LIVE AND LET DIE marks the advent of the 13-year, 7-film Roger Moore Era of the James Bond Legacy.  Moore is the third actor to step into this illustriously dashing role, and it's plain to see from the get-go he cuts a fairly sharp contrast to his predecessor, Sean Connery.  Gone are the smooth, easy mannerisms of our hero of the 60's - Connery's unconscious charm - the burly pitch of his voice, the fluent expressiveness mingled with a somewhat rough, dour edge unique only to him.  No, Moore is a whole different Bond altogether.  However, that's not to say he's a bad one - his demeanor formal, his chiseled features essentially inexpressive, his voice balanced, refined and imbued with an astute droll dry wit, he's the quintessential British gentleman.  Not once during the entire coarse of this film does this Bond lose his cool; he is unshakeable, never missing a beat.  Never does even a hair on his head get tousled out of place.  His take on 007 is, in fact, very apt for the era.
Even the villains here are of another variety:  for nowhere are the likes of a Blofeld or a Goldfinger to grace us with a fantastical Save-The-World Challenge for Bond to sort out.  No, the villains here are a sinister all Black ring of international drug smugglers.  LALD commences with a rather unique pre-credits sequence:  for our favorite spy doesn't even grace us with his presence until after the fiery opening credits are razed - in consummate style by Maurice Binder's swarthy & spooky main title design: touched up in fire and skulls, intense wide-open staring eyes, against the backdrop of Paul McCartney's bizarre, piquantly invigorating title song.  The pre-credit events involve the killing of three British agents:  the first at a consulate in New York, a second during a jazz funeral in New Orleans, and another in a voodoo ceremony on the Caribbean island of San Monique.  Agent 007 is assigned the task of getting to the bottom of these crimes, which leads him first to New York, thence onward to San Monique, New Orleans and the surrounding Louisiana Bayou, on the trail of the sinister Doctor Kananga (Yaphet Kotto), the menacing Mr. Big, and a mysterious woman called Solitaire (Jane Seymour), who can foresee the future in her Tarot Cards.  Perhaps one of this movie's most enjoyable scenes takes place in Bond's first meeting with Mr. Big and Solitaire in the back room of a Harlem restaurant. Yet for this movie, scenes like that are rare; it's mostly action to be found here - and maybe too much action, actually.  There's plenty of car chases, including one fairly entertaining pursuit in New York involving a taxicab, a pimp-mobile and a freeway full of 1973 Chevy Caprices and Impalas; there's an exceedingly exciting boat chase; there's also a great scene in which Bond, wearing crocodile-skin shoes, prances atop the heads of the crocodiles strewn malevolently across a sweltering bayou.  Ha! Now, that is hot - quite hot!

But as for Roger Moore's first mission, he not only had a hard act to follow, but also a great many first-time occurrences to contend with. And it's apparent that he was yet just taking tentative steps into feeling his own way into the role.  He's the only Bond who never ordered vodka martinis ""shaken not stirred.""  This is the first (and fortunately only) Bond film since DR. NO lacking any appearance whatsoever by ""Q.""  It's the first time John Barry's deep, lush compositions are absent from the score.  And first black Bond girl, Rosie Carver (Gloria Hendry) sparks the first interracial love scene with Bond.
LIVE AND LET DIE has some undeniably curious aspects.  First of all, Solitaire's ability to foretell the future in her Tarot Cards is apparently real.  Dr. Kananga's henchman, Baron Samedi (Geoffrey Holder) is eerily menacing with his terrifying deep laugh and lurid association with the arts of voodoo.  This is the first, and I think only, instance of the supernatural woven into a Bond adventure.

Though DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER, Connery's last official Bond film, appeared in 1971, it still very much retained the 1960's feel that had epitomized each of the first seven in the series.  It's actually LIVE AND LET DIE that strode the 007 series, with a firm and sure step, into the blithe and spirited 70's.",1047340800,2,4272,4.824417009602195
480513,2,6302510007,"Yes, the most boring James Bond flick of them all.  The action scenes are dull as wood compared to the over-the-top stuff you see in the Connery films and in Moore's better efforts like ""Moonraker"" (Moore's most under-rated 007 film, and the movie that made me a Bond fan in the first place, way back at the tender age of 10) and ""The Spy Who Loved Me.""  It takes at least half an hour before James even kills anybody!
The film also suffers from Q's (Desmond Llewellyn's) hiatus.
What's more, the Wings' title track is okay, but it's over-rated!  It blows my mind that, and the title track to ""A View to a Kill"" are the most popular Bond songs of all time, yet they accompany the two dullest Bond films of all time.
Too much time wasted on voodoo schlock as well, especially the closing bit with that laughing creep.
Roger Moore did much better with the aforementioned titles . . .",1040688000,,881,4.392638036809816
480514,2,6302510007,"This movie bites! It's too comical to be a Bonds movie and i seen them all. Bond is not too intelligent and not too wise, because the villians are something off of a Shaft movie, and didn't really scare me like the villians of previous bonds with Connery. Also, i don't like Roger Moore as Bond so that didn't help either lol. He make a good Q replacement but not Bond. The movie is so corny its shameful. That plastic green snake in the beginning of the movie just before the music intro was so [unrealistic], ...You didn't even see the bite mark on that guy before he fake his death. And agents getting stab on a corner, not once but it happen twice it too much. What i like about this movie, solitair played by jane seymore and the paul mcartney song 'live and let die' at the beginning. It's probably the best song next to the Octapussy song by Rita.  If your a bond fan, watch it but don't say i didn't warn ya.",1039219200,2,916,4.204545454545454
480515,3,6302510007,"This film introduced Roger Moore as James Bond. Three agents are killed; Bond is sent to NY to investigate. The action starts when his driver is shot. You get a chance to see those old dinosaurs that soon became extinct with skyrocketing oil prices. We see strange exotic places like Upper Manhattan, and then a small Caribbean island where the action occurs.
There is the novelty of an oracle who predicts the future through tarot card. An agent is revealed as a traitor, and dies. Bond inserts himself into a carefully guarded place and meets the oracle; her future is changed. They trespass, and are chased by cars in scenes that are less intense than in earlier movies.
The scheme is to give away two tons of heroin to put existing suppliers out of business, and assure a monopoly to Mr Big. The existing suppliers and their political allies don't like this! Bond again acts as a trouble shooter to eliminate the upstart competition. He fires their drug refinery, and escapes in a motor boat. This chase is more fanciful than ""From Russia With Love"". The actor who played the Sheriff won a part in the next film...
This film has lower production values than the earlier films in the series. As if they didn't want to risk too much money on a new replacement star.",1034726400,,1267,4.610619469026549

Solitare plays the bond girl that uses her special powers to help Kananga. Of course 007 uses his own powers on her and the stage is set for boat chases, crocodile escapes and voodoo ceremonies!

480517,2,6302510007,"Live and Let Die, released in 1973, was the 8th James Bond movie, and the debut of Roger Moore as agent 007 (third actor to play the character). It sure ain't that great for a Bond film. The film's story seemed just ridiculous. I mean, the villains alone have as much gadgets as Bond himself and always seem to know where he is. They seem to capture Bond on several occasions so easily. Bond is a secret agent, so how how do they about him?
Not the best debut for Roger Moore as Bond, but his performance as 007 would get better by latter films in the series (1977's The Spy Who Loved Me), but still, his performance as Bond in Live and Let Die is a change after the departures of Sean Connery and George Lazenby. Jane Seymour (TV's Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman) plays Solitaire, the Bond girl in this film. Yaphet Kotto plays the villain, who is an international drug dealer.  There's still some great action sequences as usual for a Bond movie.",1028332800,,943,4.388571428571429
480587,5,6302510007,"Just like Octopussy, Live and Let Die continues to be one of the most underrated movies in the James Bond series. I have seen every Bond film at least once(not including NSNA and CR)and many of them multiple times and even though some people couldn't stand LALD, it continues to entertain me each time I watch it.
I really liked the part when Bond and Rosie Carver were up in the hills (down there) and as they are getting intimate, Roger Moore (my favorite Bond although Dalton and Connery were both great) takes out the Queen of Cups and tells Rosie that she is a lying, deceitful woman.  Only a few seconds later, she sees a scarecrow and lets out a scream. Bond responds ""That used to be a convincing act, Rosie but its wearing a little thin now.""
Everything was terrific in this movie.  Jane Seymour was a stunning Bond girl.  Yaphet Kotto and Julius Harris were terrific as Kananga/Mr. Big and Tee-Hee respectively (and Kotto was also one of the best actors on the great NBC tv show, ""Homicide"").  Actually, one of my least favorite characters was Geoffrey Holder as Baron Samedi, who has tended to recieve many compliments from this movie.  The locations were excellent, as usual.  And the title song by Paul McCartney is one of my favorites, up there with Carly Simon's ""Nobody Does It Better"" from TSWLM, Rita Coolidge's ""All Time High"" from Octopussy and Shirley Bassey's ""Goldfinger.""
Now on to the movie itself.  The beginning was rather slow, up until Roger Moore leaves the voodoo shop and pursues the brown car in the cab.  The cabbie, who doesnt have a name, was one of my favorite characters.  There was something about his personality, unlike most of the other bad guys' personalities, that made him a very upbeat and likable minor character.  I liked some of the dialogue that he carried on with Moore.  ""Cabbie: Uptown?...you headed into Harlem, man.  Moore: Well you just keep on the tail of that juke box and there's an extra twenty in it for you.  Cabbie: Hey man, for twenty bucks, I'll take you to a Ku Klux Klan cookout.""  This probably won't go down as one of the most politically correct movies, but it fit the times (1973) really well.
Many of the action sequences were also awesome, including ""Bond driving the double-decker bus into the low bridge, the sequence in the airplane with Mrs. Bell, Bond jumping on the alligators backs to escape, the boat scene (although I agree it could have been condensed), and the second last scene when Bond fights Kananga.
There were numerous one and two-liners throughout the movie that I also enjoyed.  ""A genuine Felix Leiter. How illuminating."" ""Names is for tombstones, baby. Take this honkey out now and waste him."" ""Let's just wing it."" (the airplane scene) Kananga: ""So, what shall we drink to Mr. Bond?"" Bond: ""How about an earthquake""
I love almost all of the James Bond movies (with the exceptions of YOLT, AVTAK, and TWINE) but Roger Moore shined in his Bond debut.  The reason I think Moore was better than Connery is because Moore  naturally had the quintessential smoothness and amiable personality while Connery often tried to be the same.  For example, in Goldfinger, when Connery activates the metal spokes in his tires to slash Tilly Masterson's tires just to meet her, well, that is something Roger just wouldn't have done.  He would have met her in a far more practical way.
Anyways, LALD is number one in my book, followed by Octopussy, Goldfinger, and TLD.  By the way, if you were wondering what place FRWL is in, I ranked it #14.  Before long, I will explain how FRWL is, hands down, the most overrated Bond movie.
LONG LIVE ROGER MOORE!!!",1015545600,,3630,4.694006309148265
480588,5,6302510007,"1. The best Bond theme song ever---""Live and Let Die,"" by Paul McCartney and Wings. Urgent, chilling, and recurs a lot in the movie. Unlike other classic themes like ""Thunderball"" and ""Goldfinger,"" it's simply too unusual of a song to have attained any camp value, and thus still commands our attention.
2. The most beguiling Bond girl ever---Jane Seymour (as ""Solitaire""), in her first appearance ever on film, by the way (at the age of 20). With apologies to Ursula Andress, Barbara Bach, and Diana Rigg, Seymour is the finest and most complex of the back-in-the-day Bond girls. Only Michelle Yeoh (""Tomorrow Never Dies"") is as riveting, but in a very different role.
3. The most comical non-Bond character in a Bond movie---Clifton James (as ""Sheriff J.W. Pepper""). His appearance in this film made him so popular that he reprised the same role in ""The Man with the Golden Gun.""
4. The best Bond villians---The big baddy is played by the estimable Yaphet Kotto. The sub-baddies are the most memorable Bond has ever faced, with the steel-clawed TeeHee, the subdued Whisper (with his dartgun-equipped pimp mobile), and the deliciously insane Baron Samedi (played by Geoffery Holder, known to most Americans for his ""Crisp and clean, no caffeine"" Seven-Up commercials in the 80s).
5. The most dated premise---Of special appeal to Americans is the early 70s setting of this film. The bad guys are all African-American. They wear pimp costumes. They speak G-rated jive. They drive tricked-out Cadillacs. They eat at the ""Fillet of Soul"" restaurant. They call Bond a honky. Every black person in the movie seems to be in on the plot. No evil anti-Bond organization is so deliciously outdated and silly as the one we're expected to buy in ""Live and Let Die.""
The only strike against this movie is that James Bond is not played by Sean Connery. However, Roger Moore (in his first Bond movie) is restrained and charming and doesn't detract from the film's atmosphere.
The whole is not perfectly equal to the sum of the parts, but the parts alone are enough to make this my choice for the best Bond Movie ever.",1007856000,7,2103,4.860724233983287

480592,3,6302510007,"LIVE AND LET DIE traded Sean Connery, SPECTRE agents, nuclear missles, and plans for world destruction for Roger Moore, drug dealers, voodoo, and fortune telling. Throw in some crocodiles and snakes and you have LIVE AND LET DIE. I do believe that for the most part we the audience got the fuzzy end of the lollipop in this very average Bond outing. In his 8th adventure, Bond (now Moore) is to investigate the powerful diplomat Kananga (Yaphet Kotto) who has a devious plan to corner the drug market by putting 2 tons of free heroin on the open market. After putting other dealers out of business and increasing the number of addicts, he will make billions with his supply. Kananga at the same time depends on the tarot card reading power of the lovely Solitaire (Jane Seymour) to do his business and gets worried when she cannot perform her duties. This movie moves with the feeling of a comic book adventure and has only a few true fast and fun spots before the movie gets going, which by then is halfway through, and at the same point we are given (thankfully only for a brief stay) the spitt'in and swear'in Sheriff Pepper who gives the movie a very un-Bond feel. Moore's attitude as Bond is much more playful but he loses Connery's more rough and tumble nature, and Kotto does make a charismatic and decent villian for Bond to tackle. The few highlights to this film are the very flashy opening credit sequence which is fitted with Paul McCartney's hit song LIVE AND LET DIE, and Kananga's thugs which include Teehee a hitman who is constantly smiling and has a killer metal arm and claw, Whisper, a rotund goon who seems to have terminal larengytis and Baron Samedi, who is a true enigma.  There are plenty of better Bond movies out there, but I'm afraid that this isn't one of the better ones, it is above average at best. DR. NO, FOR YOUR EYES ONLY, and THE SPY WHO LOVED ME among others are all much better fare.

480595,4,6302510007,"This is an excellent movie.  So it's not traditional Bond, and it's certainly not the heaviest in the series.  Actually, it seems to lack depth in some places, it's kind of long,  and the plot seems to really deviate about 90 minutes into the movie.  But if you're looking for a fun,  not-so-involving movie, this is it.
This one has an altogether  different flavor than the others in the series, probably because it's set  mostly in America (and 70's Harlem at that!).  I'd like to see 007 make a  return to the U.S.
Roger Moore, in his first turn as 007, gives a very  offhanded, lightweight, amusing performance.  Yaphet Kotto does the best he  can with the writing Mr. Big was given, and Jane Seymour (her first film)  is very good as Solitaire.  Julius W. Harris made a formidable Tee-Hee, the  henchman with a mechanical arm and a hook for a hand.  And I am still not  sure of Baron Samedi's importance to the story, but Geoffrey Holder was  very memorable in the role.
This is far and away the funniest Bond I've  ever seen.  The laughs start kind of slow, then they keep coming.  First of  all, to see James Bond, crisp, white, British secret agent, in 1973 Harlem  is a blast in itself.  He looks so out of place, it's actually funny!  I  think that was meant to look that way, though.  Moore did a good job at  playing a Bond who was trying not to look like he felt out of place, but  nevertheless obviously was.  Check out the first taxi scene and the  following scene where he enters the Fillet of Soul--this defines the whole  fish-out-of-water thing.  Inside the restaurant, Bond talks to his waiter  at his table, and as he asks him for information, the wall revolves with  Bond still at the table!  Watch how Moore tries in vain to get up from his  seat, and how the waiter, unfazed, spins on his heel and walks away  drinking Bonds drink.  If you don't laugh at that, you don't know humor!
Then, a little over halfway through, there's a big detour in the film  itself.  Bond is in New Orleans with Solitaire, and one thing leads to  another and there's a big chase scene with 007 driving a double-decker bus.  Somewhere after that long comic chase, portly, balding, tobacco-chewing  (and -spitting), profanizing, pants-hiking, hillbilly redneck Sherriff J.W.  Pepper enters the picture.  Clifton James gives a hilariously classic  performance as the uber-stereotype, and the time he spends onscreen  (although irrelevant to the plot) is among the film's best.  From the  moment he strides up to the speeding Harlemite's car, cocks his hat, hikes  up his pants, and says that no one pulls one over on Sherriff J.W. Pepper,  you'll be rolling in the aisles, trust me!  What follows is another wild  (and even longer) demolition chase scene with Bond in a speedboat that is  humorous as well.
After it's felt like two hours, then there is some  action with Bond and Solitaire over a shark tank, with Mr. Big laughing at  their plight.  I thought it would have been more fitting to use the  crocodiles that were already in the movie instead of bringing in a new  animal, personally.  (Although it is interesting to note that 007 helper  Felix Leiter, who appears here, was eaten by a shark--partially, anyway--in  his only other appearance in ""Licence to Kill."")
I know I haven't seemed very kind in my review, and acknowledge that it has many plot holes and things.  But it is a very good movie, and very fun.  Just don't go looking for this one if you want the Bond that everyone knows.",948758400,23,3501,4.588617886178862

LALD is a truly entertaining film-just  watch the (overlong) boat chase if you don't believe me. But there are  aspects which are clearly lacking as well. The film generally lacks depth,  and it looks fairly dated as well. Bond looks totally out of place in  Harlem, and as for Sheriff J.W. Pepper, he may be funny but he adds nothing  to the film. This was Roger Moore's first time out as Bond, and he is GREAT  in the role, although I think ""The Spy Who Loved Me"",  ""Moonraker"" and ""Octopussy"" provided him with better  opportunities.

Jane Seymour is indeed hot, but her character is weak.  The theme song is incredible, and sets the stage for a wild ride. Overall,  it's really just formula Bond, but who cares? As stupid as it can be  sometimes, it looks like Gone With The Wind compared to Tomorrow Never  Dies.",944092800,2,743,4.212765957446808

Voo doo plot is a little too out there, but Yaphet Kotto actually takes an underwritten character  and turns it into one of the better Bond villains to grace the screen.  Evil and fun!  He was always an under rated actor, unfortunately.  But he  shows his stuff here.",940723200,,390,4.347222222222222

Something that this movie needed was a scene with  ""Q"".  Bond's gadgets needed some backup from this master of the  technology.  Overall I gave this movie 3 stars.",938390400,,335,4.593220338983051

7827564,5,6302510007,"LIVE AND LET DIE is the one film in the James Bond series that stands out from the rest. This is Roger Moore's first film as James Bond the British agent with the ""007: LICENCE TO KILL"" and he keeps the body count going up. In many ways it does not even seem like it is part of the series. The character of James Bond was totally revamped in LIVE AND LET DIE. Bond seems to have traded in his cigarettes for cheroots. Gone are the Martinis shaken not stirred, the Dom Perigone, Bond's worldliness and sardonic wit. It's all gone. Even his wardrobe is over-the-top. But it is all a facade. Bond's appearance as a fop and dandy are only a ruse, a deception. If you examine this film you will see that Bond is no perfunctory agent. He dispenses lethal doses of vengeful comeuppance with his urbane charm. The film's lighter approach under Guy Hamilton's direction actually makes many of the scenes of violent and contorted death more palatable. On closer examination this film is a highly stylized piece of action filled nonsense that delivers outrageous thrills, characters, dialogue and humor in a well-choreographed non-stop bit of filmmaking.

LIVE AND LET DIE is a distinctive James Bond film taking the series in a new direction first seen in DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER.",1413849600,,1267,4.681614349775785

7827566,5,6302510007,"This is one of my favorite Bond film with Roger Moore. The reason why I liked it is because it's not like any other Bond film ever. It takes the viewer from New Orleans to the darkest depths of Haiti. It involves the mysteries of voodoo as well as twists and turns throughout the movie. It's a Bond film that every 007 fan should watch.

7827570,5,6302510007,"This is Roger Moore's debut as James Bond, as 007 plunges into the world of voodoo. Venturing into the heart of Louisiana, USA and the Caribbean, to take on the empire of megalomaniacal drug lord, Dr Kananga (Yaphett Kotto), who could just as well play a vicious Third World dictator, and G-D knows there are a lot of those around. In 2004 the co-called Non Aligned Movement is made up predominantly of insane, bloodthirsty Third World despots.

A thrilling boat chase and run-in with crocodiles are some of the treats in this film. A gorgeous young Jane Seymour plays Solitaire the alluring young seeress kept captive by Dr Kananga. She makes an extremely endearing damsel in distress, and I would vote her the most appealing Bond girl: A wonderful combination of innocence and potent sensuality.

My favourite scene is where Bond rescues Solitaire from an evil mob of voodoo cultists about to sacrifice her.  The bizarre voodoo rites are very well done-both terrifying and transfixing. This Bond never loses the viewers interest-it is a delight to the senses, well complimentary to Paul McCartney's amazing theme song.

This could only have been done during the magic of the 70's.",1092873600,,1182,4.954545454545454

More truck driver language though. When trying to get away from Kananga's henchmen Bond got in a plane at a flying school with an old lady in it. The bad guys went to shut the door in a hangar. Just feet awy from getting half of the wing shopped off the old lady said ""holy sh**"".",1072224000,,453,3.9347826086956523
