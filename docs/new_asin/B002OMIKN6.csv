3962104,4,B002OMIKN6,"On the days I don't want to do cardio but still feel like exercising, this is a great workout. I love that it seems to target my muscles deeply, even though some of the movements seem small. The legs workout I can definitely feel later. I bought one for my mom also.",1275264000,16,266,4.134615384615385
3962105,3,B002OMIKN6,"I excercised with Denise 20 years ago while watching her Get Fit program. My home excercise routine was getting boring so I started excercising with her Body Makeover Mix DVD and it's good for me because I am in good shape so I am flexible enough to keep up with her program, so I am able to keep toned and have fun. Of course I will have to purchase another excecise DVD soon to add to my collection.",1266364800,8,401,4.153846153846154
3962106,4,B002OMIKN6,"This video is great for anyone who, like me, has limited time to work-out.  The 3 15-minute workouts are just the right length to allow me to get in some exercise without having to tie up my entire evening.  The short lengths also make it more likely that I'll keep up my work-out regimen.",1265155200,6,289,4.333333333333333
3962107,4,B002OMIKN6,"I purchased this video from Target yesterday not sure if I should take the risk but I did and I am glad.  I was concerned that it would be just a run of the mill toning/weight workout without interesting/fun movements. I am happy to say that I had nothing to worry about.

The workout has many flowing movements I have yet to see in a workout. Many are ballet and Pilates inspired.  Lots of movement....fun and inspiring movement.  I am very confident that I will enjoy this workout and it will be a nice addition to my collection.

The only thing I am not thrilled with is the music. The trailer played a very different kind of music that is not on the DVD at all that is more inspiring and fun.

But it is still a wonderful, fun, flowing toning workout that is worthwhile to have.

****************************

I wanted to add an update. I am mostly a Kundalini yoga/regular yoga, dance type of workout person.  ""Toning"" is not my first motivation (I am toned enough) but I mostly exercise for energy and well being.  I did this tape yesterday when I just wanted a quick pick me to feel better before I got on with my day.

It worked. I did the whole thing and I felt wonderful afterwards. I did make some changes.  Sometimes I went without weights (sometimes the weights strain my back) and sometimes I chose a different exercise with more stretch (I have a large repertoire in my mind because of all my exercising).

I also learned something.  Yoga and dance does tone you but if toning is your first goal...then I would go to this DVD and other Denise Austin toning workouts for that.  After doing the DVD yesterday I felt a toning I have not experienced doing yoga alone.  And it felt amazing.  I really think she knows her stuff and if you are looking to get toned fast, while experiencing the mind body benefits of exercise, I would go with this.",1263513600,13,1855,4.424778761061947
3962108,5,B002OMIKN6,I thoroughly enjoy this dvd.  The exercises are specific and targeted so time is not wasted;she gets right down to business.  Each 15 segment is just enough to fit into a busy day.  Denise has definitely improved over the years.,1262736000,34,228,4.65
3962109,5,B002OMIKN6,I liked the new routines.  I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for some new spins on daily work outs.  Lower body was fairly easy while the abs and upper body were more challenging.,1260057600,35,193,4.333333333333333

3962215,5,B002OMIKN6,"I really love the Denise Austin workouts in my fitness DVD library.  I would recommend this one and her boot camp workout.  She  knows exercise physiology, and it shows in the explanations given during the workouts as well as how they are choreographed.",1430956800,,253,4.837209302325581

3962237,3,B002OMIKN6,"It's an alright video - Denise Austin per usual... sometimes she's off beat or loses count, and the workouts really aren't that challenging. Would be better for a real beginner or someone who is more limited. I'm 26 and relatively athletic and this was kind of boring for me.",1421625600,,275,4.63265306122449
3962238,5,B002OMIKN6,This is actually my second time buying this workout mix. I had it years ago but somehow it got lost. I had to find it and get again so that has to tell you how much I liked it. The workouts are not too hard and not too easy for me and I feel like they are beneficial to a beginner or an intermediate person.,1421107200,5,307,3.7384615384615385
3962249,5,B002OMIKN6,This video served me well. Its great for basic body toning but of course it can only take you so far. Perfect for the beginning to medium fitness type person.,1418256000,3,158,4.3
3962250,5,B002OMIKN6,"I really loved this video. It has a Pilates feel to it and Denise puts a little different spin on the typical toning workout! It is a great video to do on your off-aerobic days.  The music is very soothing, her voice is calm, explanations are clear so you don't have to be watching the screen, and she includes great stretches in all three segments.  It is not too difficult but feel it works all the parts of the body well,  I did them all in one session. I have owned it for awhile and put it in to do this morning for the first time on a whim!  So glad I did, I will be doing it regularly.",1415750400,,592,3.9495798319327733

3962253,4,B002OMIKN6,"When I was younger, a Denise Austin video was the first work out video I've ever done and to this day she still stays true to what she does and the results she gives you. Believe me, you'll feel everything. I gave it a 4 cause I wish there was some cardio in there but it's still a good DVD.",1404259200,2,291,3.8666666666666667
3962254,2,B002OMIKN6,Just not my style and what I was looking for in a work out.. was looking for an intense full body work out with minimal impact on my joints.,1403654400,3,140,3.8620689655172415
3962255,4,B002OMIKN6,"I really like how they put this DVD together. You can do one full workout (upper body, legs, and abs) or you can split up each section and focus on the areas you want. Each individual workout is about 15 minutes and she does several moves in each segment. Before I purchased this, I looked on youtube to see if I would like it. The only reason I am not giving this 5 starts is because when I select all the workouts at one time (so one will pop up right after the other), the DVD stops and I have to start over. I am not sure why this happens. It does not happen when I a select each section individually. I think this is a good DVD for any physical level.",1403481600,3,656,3.977272727272727
3962256,5,B002OMIKN6,"She is excellent and this is a great workout.  It can be done in segments or all at once, but no matter what you chose, you will benefit from it all.",1402876800,2,149,3.806451612903226
3962257,3,B002OMIKN6,"I bought this DVD because I have been doing Jillian Michaels DVDs for 3 months and wanted a change. I found these exercises to be too easy...and I am by no means in great shape. She only does a few reps per exercise. I did the 15 minute abs and 15 minute arms back-to-back and did not break a sweat or feel ""worked out"" in any way. I was not sore at all the next day either. I'll stick with Jillian.",1400716800,,399,3.9382716049382718
3962258,5,B002OMIKN6,Another great overall workout video by Austin. No socks and shoes required. Enjoyed the hand weights exercises. It works all the target zones I need. You will feel the burn the next day.,1398643200,2,186,4.666666666666667
3962269,5,B002OMIKN6,I've had some of Denise's training videos in my routine since days of VHS. She always delivers a good mix.,1398124800,,106,4.35
3962270,5,B002OMIKN6,I like how each zone workout is only 15 min. Who can't set aside 15 minutes a day to start toning the body?!?!,1395273600,,110,3.8260869565217392
3962271,5,B002OMIKN6,"This gave me a new respect for pilates and ballet barre workouts, ouch. It looks easy if you just watch it but this will get you burning. I like this because it's no impact and I'm seeing toning results after a few weeks. Think pilates is easy-think again! It's worth it and she's my favorite, always has been.",1392422400,2,310,4.362068965517241
3962272,1,B002OMIKN6,I was disappointed with this DVD.  Too much yoga for me.  I like to move and feel my workout.  Not happy with this one.,1389139200,4,119,3.875
3962273,5,B002OMIKN6,"i had borrowed this workout from the library system to see what it was like, liked it, and then decided to purchase a copy for myself.  A good workout that you can do along with to your ability.  She uses 2 light weights, but you can do without them.",1389052800,2,250,4.081632653061225
3962274,2,B002OMIKN6,"Boring, not what I expected:( indoor exercise proving to be difficult for me. This just wasn't the answer for me",1388188800,,112,4.65
3962275,4,B002OMIKN6,"I like Denise Austin. I know she annoys some people, but I find her easy to follow and positive. I use her workouts on easier days, when I am not running or doing some sort of class at the gym.

They are good for when you don't have lots of time. Anywhere for 15-30 minutes. She does work areas that I don't usually work.

I think it is a good DVD for beginners, but if you are more advanced, she offers ways to make the exercises more difficult.",1383091200,,446,4.056818181818182
3962276,5,B002OMIKN6,"I love the way Denise keeps up with fitness trends.  I love Lotte Berk ballet barre toning, and Denise includes that here in the lower body section.  Very effective!  I usually do 2 of the 15-minute segments in a day, and it doesn't matter how you mix them, the workouts give quick results.  It's a bonus to me to be able to get the best exercises out there, delivered by a cheery, likeable Denise, who I've been working out with since she first started doing her TV shows way back when.  She's become an old friend, and I've come to trust her for enjoyable, effective, safe workouts.",1382486400,10,584,4.420560747663552

3962278,5,B002OMIKN6,"I was looking for a great workout video that focused on strength training since I use a treadmill for cardio. This is a perfect complement to a full workout regimen. As always, Denise Austin has simple, but challenging, exercise routines that work all the muscle groups. Love it!",1380844800,,279,4.833333333333333

3962280,5,B002OMIKN6,"I really like this DVD.  I had seen Denise years ago on TV but had not tried her exercise DVDs.  It is very straight forward with the 3 15 minutes workouts for upper, core and lower body.  I am 54 and not an avid high energy exerciser but not a  slow / beginner either.  This is just a nice calm, energetic but not extremely fast paced.  For me, it was just right and not too hard on my knees but still a great workout.  I have noticed improved muscle tone since I began using this DVD",1379548800,4,485,3.9895833333333335
3962281,4,B002OMIKN6,nice and easy workout for home in less than an hour. no cardio so it won't make you sweat but a light strength training video,1376438400,,125,4.04
3962282,2,B002OMIKN6,this DVD was okay but not really for me. I found the exercises to be a bit boring. This may suite others but not me I need something more,1375747200,,137,3.7586206896551726

3962285,4,B002OMIKN6,"I was skeptical to try this - don't know why but I thought Denise would be too 'bubbly' for me.  Boy was I wrong - her voice stays controlled, almost soothing thorough this workout.  I was able to do most of the moves the first time and thought it was maybe too easy but the next day I definitely felt it in my thighs- which is my worst problem area.
I was very pleased to be wrong and I will continue to work out with Denise.  Definitely recommend you get this one",1372636800,,465,4.032608695652174

toned up.",1372118400,2,376,3.9473684210526314

3962293,4,B002OMIKN6,"It's comprised of three 15 minute workouts - upper, lower, and abdominal.  I felt like the upper body section was too easy (the sets are quick), but then I was a little sore a day later! Abs section was good -- sort of a pilates-focused routine, rather than the typical crunches/sit-ups.",1367366400,5,287,4.627450980392157
3962294,5,B002OMIKN6,I have been using this exercise by Denise Austin for a long long time! She was the reason I started using Stability balls in my workout.

3962299,5,B002OMIKN6,Heard reviews everywhere and head it was a great dvd. Just didn't end up needing it but go for it if ur looking for a good workout,1364860800,,130,3.8518518518518516

3962301,4,B002OMIKN6,This is done in parts so if you don't have time to do it all you can do whichever part you like. I especially like the upper body workout.,1363737600,,138,3.793103448275862
3962302,5,B002OMIKN6,"Love it.  When I can't go to the gym, this dvd brings the gym to me!  Highly Recommend.  Thank you!",1363305600,2,99,3.85
3962323,3,B002OMIKN6,She is kind of weak with her work out...I didn't realize this until I started the 30 day shred. Her voice is not motivating enough. I use this DVD when I'm on my sore days,1363219200,,171,3.914285714285714
3962324,5,B002OMIKN6,Very easy to follow.  Lots of fun to do.  Denise makes you laugh. Had  a nice soreness the next day.,1362355200,,100,3.9
3962325,5,B002OMIKN6,"I generally like my aerobics, strength & abs all intermingeled into one workout but I do like this disc too because if you only have a little time you can do one by itself, if you have more time you can do all three in 45 minutes. But my favorite part of this one is the ab routine - its my new fave of all ab routines - variety of floor work, standing ab moves & plank ab moves.",1362096000,4,379,3.810126582278481
3962326,5,B002OMIKN6,"I say nice because Denise Austin is 55 and looks fabulous! She doesn't try to kill you with this video! The exercises are perfect and can be done by a beginner or experienced exercise guru. Her teaching style is relaxed, and as a teacher I like that. I also hate counting and she doesn't do a lot of that. Thanks from one Denise to another! Now I can exercise every day!",1362009600,2,370,4.225352112676056
3962327,4,B002OMIKN6,"I am not a big athlete/gym rat but nor am I terribly out of shape. I don't particularly care for exercise but I do it because it feels so very good afterward. I'm also terribly uncoordinated so aerobic classes and the like are beyond stressful for me. On days I can't make the gym, I like to work out at home. So, with that in mind, I have to say I like this video a bunch. It doesn't require brain-twisting fancy footwork, it definitely targets the core, and has some great thigh/butt exercises in there. It's also not hardcore, so if you're looking for boot camp, this ain't it. But at 40 mins, it's the perfect little workout to get some blood flowing in all the right places.

As for Denise Austin, I'm sorta mesmerized by her spooky smokey voice. Is that a plus? I don't know; but it's different! Gonna try another video of hers today...",1360800000,7,842,4.3630573248407645

3962330,5,B002OMIKN6,"Great DVD.  Highly recommend.  The arm workout is great.  A lot of new and different moves.  Same thing with the legs and abs.  The legs segment is like a ballet bar workout at first and then down to the floor.  The abs section also has some diifferent exercises that are great.  I do all three after doing cardio and while that means 45 mins of weights and toning, it is worth it.  Do this DVD three times a week and it will whip you into shape.",1357948800,5,446,4.104651162790698
3962331,5,B002OMIKN6,"I ended up canceling my gym membership and just buying a bunch of workout DVDs. Several of them are from Denise Austin, and this is one of them. I like that it's several short workouts, so even if you don't have a lot of time, you can get some exercise in. And on days when you're not busy, you can do all of them together. Just like in all of her DVDs, she's really friendly and motivating. I did P90X last summer, and it was a great workout, but I'm not an athlete and I don't need to loose weight, I just want to be active and tone my muscles a little. I think this is great. It's a great workout and you feel it, but you don't feel like you're going to drop dead at the end.",1336694400,23,678,3.920289855072464
3962332,4,B002OMIKN6,"I bought this and used the video once so far. The lower body workout was the easiest, but I did find it working muscles that I don't normally feel during my workouts. I found the ballet inspired exercises quite fun! I normally work out with 8 - 10 pound hand weights on other workouts, but I found the 8 pound weights too challenging for this workout, and I might need to back down to a 5 pound weight for that one. The ab workout is challenging, and is definitely something that I need to work up to!",1325462400,3,501,4.175257731958763
3962353,5,B002OMIKN6,"This is one of the best fitness videos I've tried, and I've tried oh so many.  Denise is my favorite instructor for several reasons, but I love how consistently motivating she is.  I appreciate her calm, reassuring style, especially these days when more and more instructors are going the gruff, tough love direction.  The intimidation route doesn't appeal to me at all.  This video is great because the workouts are simple yet effective, and I don't have to dress in head to toe gear to get it done.  I do this in pajamas and bare feet when my kids go to bed!  You can't make excuses for not doing at least 15 minutes of this each night.  This video is suitable for all levels and requires only a light set of hand weights.",1322611200,8,724,4.398496240601504
3962354,5,B002OMIKN6,"I've used this only a few times so far, but am enjoying a new DVD to add to my collection of exercise DVDs by Denise Austin.  I like her enthusiasm and actually look forward to doing the exercises.",1319760000,,197,4.184210526315789
3962355,4,B002OMIKN6,"I think my favorite thing about this workout is that you can choose to do just one of the workouts or choose which ones will play so you don't have to go back to the main menu for each workout.
 The arms and legs sections are well done, you can see what is happening at all times, the stage is well lit, and Denise and her workout buddies are dressed so that you can see everyone easily. I like the upper body portion as you can make the exercises easier or harder by changing the amount of weight you use - although she does not give you much time to change if you want to use a different weight for different exercises so you have to plan ahead a bit. I found the lower body section to be somewhat challenging, but I can't say I ever really broke a sweat doing it.  Both sections used exercises I haven't seen before, and some that are not used very often in other videos which is great!
The abs portion I'm not so thrilled with.  There are exercises in it that the beginner cannot, and should not do, and she does not offer modifications for most of them.  This portion almost begs the beginner to quit from low back injury or sheer frustration.  It kind of surprised me that Denise doesn't have this section fleshed out a bit better since this is in no way an advanced workout, one would expect that beginners would pick it up.  I would have given this dvd 5 stars had it not been for this section.
I have only owned a few of Denise's videos over the years, but she seems a bit subdued in this one.  Her voice is calm and mellow, and she almost reminds me of a yoga instructor in this one.  I found her very pleasant in this workout.  Whether or not someone else would like it would depend on what they like in an instructor.  If you like super perky instructors or ones who are barking out orders (I gotta admit, depending on my mood sometimes I want someone who is more extreme than she is here), then you're not going to be happy with this one.",1319328000,18,1951,4.1786666666666665
3962356,5,B002OMIKN6,"This video is both fun and effective.  I usually combine the abs with the upper workout one day and the next the abs with the leg workout.  I disagree that the leg workout is ""too easy"".  It is actually quite effective and based on ballet bar exercises.  (As a former ballet dancer in my youth, I can tell you they are a challenge if done as instructed!)  A fun workout that will keep you motivated and fit!",1312761600,10,407,4.233766233766234
3962357,5,B002OMIKN6,"This was exactly what I was looking for - an effective, time efficient workout. Although I've been using it several times a week, I haven't tired of it yet, and even have others in my family loving it too.",1302825600,7,205,4.282051282051282
3962358,5,B002OMIKN6,I love this DVD.  It provides a very good targeted workout to all areas of your body.  Even though I'm not losing any more weight my body is changing & looking better.  My husband loves my thighs & rear end after doing this workout.  And it doesn't take very long to see results.,1299974400,9,279,4.2075471698113205
3962359,3,B002OMIKN6,"I got This DVD consists of 3 15 min workouts (upper body, lower body, abs&core). I have done all three and didn't even sweat. Definitely didn't feel it in my muscles afterwards. Way too easy compared to my usual workouts (Jillian Michaels and Jackie Warner). She doesn't even do regular push-ups, you are supposed to do an easy version with your knees on the floor, just a few reps of each variety. A joke. Also, I find her talk a bit annoying, but fortunately you can switch her off and have music only. Stretches in the workouts are nice though, so I might incorporate her entire 15 min as a cooldown phase after my regular workout.  The workout doesn't have to be this easy if it is only 15 min. For example, Xtreme Crunchless Abs is two 15 min workouts (one standing abs one on the mat) but those you can definitely feel. I suppose this might be OK for complete beginners, and something to do from time to time to improve flexibility a bit, but I don't think this is particularly effective for toning and staying in shape.",1293494400,6,1026,4.428571428571429
3962360,4,B002OMIKN6,"This is an excellent video for overall body toning.  For 45 minutes, you can't beat that!

What I noticed first about the video is she uses new exercises.  She uses weights in the upper body section which tend to tone a combo of muscles with each exercise instead of 1 muscle at a time.

The lower body section uses a lot of ballet movements using a chair for support and then takes it down to the floor for more exercieses.  They are very comfortalbe movements, not too challenging.

The abs section is pretty decent for new exercises as well as overall toning using light hand weights.

This is NOT Rigorous toning, but easy toning.",1284595200,10,634,4.508771929824562
3962361,5,B002OMIKN6,"This is a challenging and innovative strength training workout. For those who don't like Denise's chirpy style, she is much calmer and more subdued in this DVD.

8376183,5,B002OMIKN6,"I have always loved Denise Austin.  I began my ""workout at home"" regimen with her many years ago and now that I am older, I find that I use her workouts more and more.  I have hundreds of workout DVDs but I cannot do many of the ones I have anymore because they are too strenuous.  But all of my Denise DVDs are still in use.  Not only are they effective, the workouts don't leave you feeling ""pooped out"".  You can use them everyday - most are only 20 to 30 minutes - so you can fit them into any work schedule.  I will say that I began a second career as a teacher this year and it has been the toughest year of my life.  Extremely stressful and exhausting; physically and mentally.  As a result, I ended up gaining 10 lbs and I became very unfit - I never had time to workout or even to eat right!  So, I once again am turning to Denise Austin to help me get back into shape and hopefully to feel better about myself.  I have been very depressed and unhappy as a result of the weight gain - a state of mind that is not usual for me.  So, not only do Denise's workouts work; I find that Denise lifts my spirits - she is so bubbly and cheerful and positive - honestly, I know this is going to sound corny but it's like having a friend come over when I workout with Denise.  I also really enjoy reading her fitness books because they help me get through my day!  So, yes...if you are struggling with weight gain, having a tough time sticking to a fitness plan and need to get your diet back on track - Denise is the way to go!  I can't emphasize enough how important it is to workout with someone who can really help in so many ways!  Thank you, Denise for everything you do!",1525046400,,1675,4.048632218844984
