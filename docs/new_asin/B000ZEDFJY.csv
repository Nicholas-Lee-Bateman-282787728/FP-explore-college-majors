8637504,5,B000ZEDFJY,"We bought the Toby Golf system which included the video, 7 iron and putter in 1995 through a mail order golf equipment catalog.  It was designed by an LPGA teaching pro.  My girls loved the video and watched it over and over, singing the songs and learning their lessons.  After several moves, I can't find the video or clubs anymore, but my 20 and 17 year old daughters still remember the lessons they learned and remember the songs as well.  Excellent quality instruction on the swing, rules and etiquette in a fun format - lessons for a lifetime of golf enjoyment.  Just ordered the VHS again, wish I could find the clubs as well as a DVD copy.  The perfect way to introduce your child to golf.",1331769600,,697,4.448818897637795
