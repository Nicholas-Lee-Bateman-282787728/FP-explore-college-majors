4392541,3,B004K4FUY8,"Purchased for my two year old and some of the cartoons bored him because it was only looking at the book. What I mean was that it wasn't a cartoon where the characters move, it was just opening page by page of the book.",1369958400,,219,4.0
4392542,5,B004K4FUY8,Great idea to put books on DVD. These come in handy when you lose your voice and need something to read to the students in your classroom.,1364947200,,138,4.148148148148148
4392543,5,B004K4FUY8,"My grandsons (ages 3 & 5) have stories read to them EVERY night by their parents.  However, these tapes help settle them down in bed as they relax listening to some of their favorite books. They are upbeat and help distract them from those fears that young children sometimes have at bedtime.",1362268800,,292,4.615384615384615

4392545,5,B004K4FUY8,"I am both an elementary teacher and a grandmother, and I have used these videos at school and home.

4392546,5,B004K4FUY8,"We LOVE this dvd, my 2 yr old and 5 yr old girls love the stories in this dvd! My husband and I thought they were very cute and we love the read along feature it has. I actually picked this up in a cvs as a last minute valentines gift for our girls, and Im glad that I did...I will be ordering more for our trip back home. This is a great collection, theres a story about a little mouse that gets lost and my 5 yr old was streaming tears when this happened while my 2 yr old was saying uh oh uh oh! the whole time, my 5 yr old is very sensitive and felt much better after the mouse was reunited with its family and now its one of their favorite 'stories' (the mouse one doesnt have words)",1329350400,7,688,3.852112676056338
4392547,5,B004K4FUY8,"After reading about this product on the Oppenheimer website, I decided to try it (esp. given the good price on Amazon). The stories are presented in the way they are on ""Between the Lions"" so if you're familiar with that you will know how this DVD works. My children are totally captivated. They ask to watch them over other movies. This is especially pleasing since the two children who watch these are the two youngest, so they have seen more at their age than their older siblings did at the same age. I even see my older ones watching when they are on. I love them and so do my children.",1325894400,10,591,4.333333333333333
8432328,3,B004K4FUY8,"Received package before I expected to. Packaging was excellent. The product was not. There are 3 dvds in box. Two were so smeared and nasty. Had to clean them. One DVD looks like it was scrubbed on the concrete, I'll try to have this repaired or buy a new one. This is for my granddaughter's movie collect. Very disappointed with the condition of the DVDs. Once cleaned worked just fine except for the badly damaged DVD.",1473120000,,420,4.5394736842105265
