8331617,5,B001OW5MHE,Powerful. These are friends of mine. I wasn't here when it happened. I hate to see people I love in such pain. This documentary captures it all. Well done.,1444867200,,155,4.379310344827586
8331618,5,B001OW5MHE,I saw this film at the Sarasota Film Festival many years ago.  It was an amazing story with a very powerful message. Highly recommended !!,1427673600,,138,4.52
8331619,1,B001OW5MHE,"I lived, worked and socialized in this area of Isreal at the time of this suicide bombing. Although I frequented Mike's Place a great deal (it's an awesome place with talented live music) you will find this documentary semi interesting only if you knew the individuals in it. I was disappointed with the content even though I was acquainted (socially) with the victims and individuals featured. The focus tends to repeatedly deviate way left field from the intended subject matter and to individuals not knowing the crowd and or Mikes Place employees at that time will be downright bored.",1403395200,,588,4.94949494949495

8331621,5,B001OW5MHE,"This documentary shows just how people's lives can be changed forever or ended in just a split second. This film is powerful, bold and sad at the same time. This is straight up reality, nothing staged or faked. It shows people's determination to keep going and staying strong even in the face of death. This should be mandatory viewing for anyone even thinking of becoming a filmmaker!",1306454400,,385,4.7611940298507465
