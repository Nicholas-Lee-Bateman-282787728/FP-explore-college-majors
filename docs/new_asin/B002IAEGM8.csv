8370767,4,B002IAEGM8,"I liked his stuff,but it seemed like rehashed speeches, but added a few new things. I thought I was watching ""will the anunnaki return in 2012"" lecture again. It wasn't until up around the middel of the lecture is where he actually added his new findings. I like his work on how the creation of man and how the universe was created. It all makes sense, but the rest of his interpretations are quite questionable like how God seemed to only care for the white man because he was ""different"" from the rest. The hopi legends state different that all races were created at the same time and we were all one color at one point. If you don't believe me about the white man part just read up the book called ""the lost book of enki"". It seems Enki just got fooled by another alien race in my personal opinion. The Anunnaki are smart individuals,but lack common sense and believing anything they are told.......wait it is almost just like now a days with humans. Indeed they did create us in their image and their likeness....",1302048000,,1017,4.473118279569892
