7399608,5,B014HFML6E,"Watching this performance last night left me thinking that it was the finest opera performance I have ever experienced over 50+ years of attending opera and watching videos of same. The singing, the acting, the staging, the sets -- all contributed to a perfect performance.

Macbeth was the first opera I ever heard; it was a Met broadcast that I hit upon spinning the car radio dial while driving my sainted mother on various errands. It was a ""love at first sight"" (or hearing) experience for one who had no previous exposure to either opera or classical music.

Although while I prefer traditional staging, I can accept any valid changes that do not do violence to either the story line or the intent of the composer and librettist. This Macbeth was staged by Adrian Noble, a former artistic director for the Royal Shakespeare Company.
It appears to be set in recent era Eastern Europe is semi modern dress, including firearms rather than swords. Yet it works splendidly! The heart and soul of Shakespeare's play, which so impressed Verdi, remain intact.

And, gentle reader, the singing and the acing must be experienced to be believed!

Anna Netrebko does more than ""hit it out of the park""; she blasts it into outer space! Lady Macbeth, along with Abagaille  (Nabucco), contains some of the most fiendishly demanding music in the soprano repertory. It requires a solid bottom, an extended top, as well as the ability to negotiate some tricky coloratura. The character herself is a totally evil woman with little ""redeeming social value"", and as such can be difficult to portray, since most people are incapable of expressing the venomous nature which is Lady Macbeth's. Netrebko is chilling in the role.

Zeljko Lucic as Macbeth also does a splendidly first ate job. His last act aria, ""Pieta, rispetto onore"" is sung with a delicacy and intensity that is hard to describe. The quality of vocalism and dramatics (even with closeups!) is amazing, even to these experienced ears.

Rene Pape and Joseph Calleja are similarly splendid in all respects.

The concept of the witches as frumpy bag ladies was brilliant, along with the addition of some young girls as ... ""witches in training"".

The balance of the choral work was up to the Met's high standards, as was the orchestral performance Fabio Luisi conducts with a marvelous pacing and control.

Quality of the disc is perfection, both as to picture and wonderfully detailed HD MA sound. The disc is NOT region 2 as listed on Amazon's product page, but is an ""all region"" disc, playable on US Blu ray (but not DVD) players.

I purchased my disc from an retailer in England to get it before the US release date AND at a much lower price.

Gentle reader, please do not pass on this performance; it is splendid in all respects!",1444435200,17,2781,4.8071278825995805

7399620,3,B014HFML6E,"A crap production, this is Shakespeare and the time and place is Scotland between the 7th and 8th centuries, having Banco and others running around with pistols and rifles was totally ridiculous as for ending up with a truck well the less said the better,as for Macbeth wearing a dinner suit and a bow tie, right at the start we have the chorus and the witches prancing around like a bunch of bag ladies complete with handbags, stupid, but that aside the cast is outstanding Anna Netrebko as usual is brilliant singing and acting, Zeljko Lucic was an excellent Macbeth, Rene Pape as Banco was as we always expect of him was terrific in the role, for the singing and the effect all the cast portrayed they were excellent, I watched this once, now I turn off the picture and listen to it as a sound only production and that way is is a magnificent Macbeth, the acting/singing cast are to be admired for their wonderful performance. I like opera productions set in the time the composer set them, some operas can be altered to earlier or later times but Verdi/Shakespeare particularly Macbeth cannot, my opinion of course.",1453852800,7,1119,4.656565656565657

7399622,5,B014HFML6E,"Long ago, in 1998, a smart San Francisco critic went to a recital and wrote of unknown, 26-years-old soprano from Russia: ""Anyone fortunate enough to have been in attendance witnessed a historic event."" Opera lovers who have always felt that Anna Netrebko is not just an excellent singer, but a great one, have no doubt about it after this Metropolitan Opera performance.
To have a ""great night at the opera"" all efforts must succeed - orchestra, singers and concept. Here, conductor Fabio Luisi shapes an intensive Verdian sound and the singers are nothing short of possessed.
Excellent German bass Ren&eacute; Pape in a small role of Banquo is luxury casting which few opera houses can afford.
Joseph Calleja's golden tenor in a role of Macduff shone and rang among dark and menacing voices of his colleagues.
And the principals, Zeljko Lucic and Anna Netrebko, gave us truly historical performance. Brilliant, nuanced and powerful singing from these two and the chemistry, interaction between them is what elevates this performance to the stratosphere of operatic Macbeths. Netrebko's Lady Macbeth is vicious, unstoppable femme fatale (here a noirish blonde) who puts a tremendous pressure on her husband until he succumbs to her will. Macbeth as sung by Lucic is almost gentle in duets with Netrebko; he may be a strongman, lord who commands armies, but alone with his wife, there is no doubt who is more ambitious and more driven to seize and keep the throne. King is the first to have a psychological breakdown and all that ensues is too much even for his forceful lady. In the end, Lady Macbeth crumbles under stress as well, but not Netrebko. After all that terror and singing of difficult arias, she emerges at curtain call smiling and waving to enraptured audience. This is what diva looks like. This is what opera can achieve. Unforgettable!

7399624,5,B014HFML6E,"Gripping; stunning; mesmerizing, all-star live performance for the ages. Netrebko has over 40 albums to her credit. If everything is lost, with the exception the live DVD of La Traviata from the 2005 Salzburg Festival, and this live DVD of Macbeth from the Met, these two DVDs will suffice to place Netrebko in the pantheon of  the greatest opera singers.

8730762,3,B014HFML6E,"I usually hate operas that are updated to a later time period, especially operas I count among my favorites.  Here we have Macbeth updated to mid-20th century, specifically I would guess 1961, based on the prevalence of cat-eye glasses on the ladies.  I will have to ask my older sis what year she got hers, but in the meantime, I think that time period sums it up adequately.

Well, this updating seemed to be OK, in a way.  First because I guess I am so jaded by Euro-trash in general, it seemed quite mild in comparison to most.  Also because I could be convinced that Verdi, like Mel Gibson, really had no idea how medieval Scots dressed.  In which case a generic military uniform from two or three generations ago would pass as well as any.

So I am glad the Met did their encore broadcast in theaters tonight, and I enjoyed it to a point I actually did order the Blu-ray.

What was the turning point?  Well, I like realistic drama.  And the 2nd witches scene, the opening of Act III, was very good.  I wondered how they would portray the witches around the cauldron, a la 1961.  Well, I thought it was very tastefully done.  There was no cauldron, rather the witches (actually bag-ladies) had a large chalice to pass around.  They would take items such as eye of newt, toe of frog, wool of bat, tongue of dog etc. and rather than boil them in the cauldron, they proceeded to force-feed these ingredients to certain children in the chorus.  Then the children would get sick and come forward and puke into the chalice, and the witches would mix it together and drink it all up.  I thought that was very tastefully done.

And now for the 'piece de resistance'.  I could swear the theater actually reeked of throw-up as this was happening on screen.  Now, I do not believe in magic per se, nor do I believe in Smell-o-vision.  Rather I believe some kid had actually heaved in the theater earlier that day, and there was some sauce and chunks left over, perhaps 10 or 15 rows away, that hadnt happened to get cleaned up yet.  I do not have the precise details of exactly how it happened, but all I can say is, it worked.  It was beautiful.  The actual smell of vomit, as kids were vomiting on screen.  It was one of those once-in-a-lifetime miracles that happens only once or twice in a lifetime.

So I did order the Blu-ray, and I hope it is the same as the theatrical release.  I don't know if the experience will be same without the aroma, but if I am in a plain vanilla, non-revolting, non throw-up mood, I can always just turn off the picture and enjoy the soundtrack, which is excellent.  Although I also have to admit, Madama Netrebko's acreage is also a good draw.

UPDATE:  Now that I have received the disc, I do enjoy it very much, but I can't imagine watching it without audio-synch correction.  It is off about 40 milliseconds, just enough to be annoying.  And no, it is not my system--many DVDs and most Blu-rays do NOT have this problem.",1499385600,3,2953,4.4230055658627085
8730763,4,B014HFML6E,"Marvelous singing but the staging and the costumes are, to me at least, a little off-putting",1478304000,,92,4.8125
8730764,5,B014HFML6E,"I am not an unmitigated admirer of Anna Netrebko and often feel when I'm watching her that she tends to choose roles that don't fit her extroverted temperament. But Lady Macbeth was by far the best, most exciting thing I ever saw her sing, and I'm so glad it was preserved for posterity. Netrebko's voice is now of a size and richness where she can do justice to this challenging role. And oddly, her voice has acquired enough flexibility that it didn't have in years previous that she can also dispatch the coloratura runs of the role well. As for her acting, it's over the top, it's campy, and it's fun! ""La luce langue"" is maybe the best example of how much Netrebko's voice has changed -- it now has an almost cavernous mezzo richness.

Zeljko Lucic in the title role is not quite on Netrebko's level. His voice tends to get stuck in his throat and the sound is too monochromatic to color Verdi's music to the maximum degree but he's musical and a Macbeth that is overshadowed by Lady Macbeth makes sense. Rene Pape as Banquo and Joseph Calleja as Macduff are luxury casting. Fabio Luisi leads a brooding, sensitive account of the score. It sort of takes away from the raw vigor of early Verdi, but can't complain about the quality of the musicianship.

The production is updated to around WW1 and is nothing special but it doesn't really detract from the opera. This opera has to be one of Verdi's greatest. It's early Verdi but already one can hear the masterful way he weaves music and drama together. The act one concertato besides being a great tune is also a wonderfully dramatic way of expressing the horror of Duncan's murder. But Macbeth and Lady Macbeth are still strong, still singing boldly with the guests. By Act Two's finale Macbeth has fallen apart, and Lady Macbeth is chillingly determined to keep up appearances by singing an oom-pa-pa type melody. Thus Lady Macbeth's Sleepwalking Scene comes as a shock -- no more oom-pa-pa melodies. It's now almost a stream of consciousness, as Lady Macbeth herself has fallen apart.

Great opera, but it needs great interpreters. Anna Netrebko in this series of performances more than does justice to one of Verdi's juiciest roles.",1467676800,6,2192,4.703125
8730765,5,B014HFML6E,Do not hesitate to buy this one because of updated costumes and firearms.  I myself prefer the traditional but when you watch this MacBeth the excellence of the production just overwhelms you so that you are not distracted in the least by costumes or firearms.
