7767545,4,B01GSMPG4I,Good program. Very interesting and well done for the most part.  Not heavy on any particular school of christian theology and a pretty even handed approach to the stories and events in the Bible.  Good seeing the places where things actually are believed to have occurred!,1501718400,4,272,4.891304347826087
7767546,5,B01GSMPG4I,You can't go wrong with Dave Stotts! Every Drive Thru History series is fabulous so I knew this would be no different. Highly recommend!,1499385600,2,136,4.708333333333333
7767547,5,B01GSMPG4I,"My wife and I bought ""The Gospels"" as part of our preparation for our first visit to the Holy Land.  We watched several segments at a time and found it hard to turn it off and go to bed.  This series does a fine job of weaving together the strands of ancient history, cultural context, comparative religion and Scripture.  All of it comes together in an engaging narrative, neither pedantic nor oversimplified.  I passed it on to a pastor friend who is preparing to go and I plan to send more sets to other friends.  When we were in Israel, especially around the Sea of Galilee and in Jerusalem, we felt very prepared.  This series deserves to be an enduring resource for decades to come, not just for travelers but also for serious students of the Bible.",1498089600,,755,4.474452554744525
7767548,5,B01GSMPG4I,Really enjoying this series!  Like taking a trip to the Holy land but with great info and a sense of humor you don't often find.  Delightful and reverent and very informative.,1496793600,2,175,4.612903225806452
7767549,5,B01GSMPG4I,Awesome series.,1490140800,3,15,7.0
7767550,5,B01GSMPG4I,"Had to purchase second set as my Family enjoyed it so much that they ""Borrowed"" it and I know its not coming back anytime soon. A really good production that shows a lot of proofs about the Savior we believe in.",1490054400,3,211,4.170731707317073
7767551,5,B01GSMPG4I,"A fantastic, top of the line, teaching and learning resource for sure, the grandkids along with us grandparents just completed the 18th episode together. This comprehensive and engaging exposure to the Gospels brings to light many true historical aspects in concert with Scripture and in a captivating manor too, which add to the richness of the Truth of the Gospels; Visually viewing where it all took place ads a very powerful dimension when teaching kids. We read the associated Bible readings before watching the DVD and did the Q&A after the video, just as laid out in this great presentation.  Thank you to Dave Stotts and DTH team for another valuable and entertaining Truth tool.",1489363200,5,687,4.973913043478261
7767552,5,B01GSMPG4I,"Every time I sat down, I was amazed at what I learned. I just finished watching the 18 newest episodes of Drive Thru History. Their newest series, The Gospels, is in my opinion, their most compelling yet. If you're not already familiar with Drive Thru History with Dave Stotts, its a series that traces the stories of history by going on location to the places where history happened. In Drive Thru History: The Gospels, that means going on location to where Jesus was born, preached, died, and rose again. But this isn't your routine tour of the Holy Land. This is a 9-hour series that incorporates verifiable history at every turn. From archaeological finds to the records of ancient historians, Drive Thru History: The Gospels presents the extraordinary life of Jesus of Nazareth in a clear and compelling way.

The eighteen episodes explore:

The Historical Landscape
The Announcement
Jesus is Born
Jesus Grows Up
Jesus Starts His Ministry
Jesus Returns to Galilee
Jesus Begins His Miracles
Jesus Teaches with Authority
The Sermon on the Mount
Jesus Travels the Sea of Galilee
Jesus Travels North with His Apostles
A Final Trip to Jerusalem
Jesus Arrives in Jerusalem
The Last Supper
The Trial of Jesus
The Crucifixion of Jesus
The Resurrection of Jesus
Who is Jesus?

My family could not wait to watch each episode. The time that passed while we watched each one was the fastest half hour of the day! There are so many incredible aspects of this series that it is hard to mention them all. Here are some of the ones that struck me:

Biblical: Dave does more than expound on the Gospel text. He ties together passages from throughout the Bible to help modern listeners hear and understand Jesus words the way His first followers did.

Historical: Who were John the Baptizer, King Herod, Pontius Pilate, Caiaphas, and the many other men and women who are all part of the Gospel story? Youll learn about the times they lived in, the lives they led, and their place in history.

Archaeological: Dave travels to over 50 ancient sites to show the physical evidence that corroborates the story of the Gospels.

Relational: In addition to the DVDs, Drive Thru History: The Gospels comes with a discussion guide and suggested Gospel readings that are great for families, small groups and Sunday school classes, or homeschools.

Visual: This was one aspect I didn't anticipate. Ive seen many historical specials, but Ive never seen one with the breathtaking quality of this presentation. The shots are sharp. There are overlays with key words and visual aids that are crisp and clear. There is artwork that comes alive as you watch. This is more than a special; its an experience.

Personally, I am already looking forward to watching it again because I know I have only just begun to absorb all the truths that the series shares. I encourage you to check out Drive Thru History: The Gospels for yourself.",1487721600,2,2900,4.830645161290323

7767555,5,B01GSMPG4I,"I am a pastor in Florida and I love this series! It is so well done, very professional and the research is spot on. It was filmed on location in the exact places where Jesus walked while on this earth, and it was shot in HD using awesome camera angles from helicopters and drones. This is such an unique series. I don't know of anything else like this on the market.  Coldwater Media spared no expense in making this top notch. It is filled with Scripture and makes the Bible come alive. While watching it, it makes you feel like you are right there on location with them. Superb!
We watched it as a family and it held the attention of my four children (ages 3-12) when I showed it to them. They were excited to watch every episode. My wife and I watched it before our trip to Israel and what a blessing for us to get all of that detailed history before we stepped foot in the Holy Land. I would highly recommend this for every family, every small group, and every church Bible study. It will not disappoint.",1486944000,,1008,4.277486910994765

7767566,5,B01GSMPG4I,"I'm always surprised that Dave's zany humor, apparently aimed at teens, draws me in every time. I learn and retain tremendous amounts of information packed in each episode,  tears of mirth flowing the whole time.
Our family learned loads of new facts and ideas from this well made, absorbing, visual treat.
The only drawback is that it will leave you hungry for Texas ""carbecue""...",1475193600,6,381,4.953125

7767568,5,B01GSMPG4I,"Absolutely love it.  Best buy.  Although bits and pieces of this series can be seen on both youtube, cable and TV, there is no substitute for owning the entire series.

The host was easy to follow and I found myself engaged with the amazing sites shown in the show.  My kids enjoyed the series and it became a source of quality family time away from our phones.  Whoever wrote this series did a great job and they should probably get a raise. I will recommend it to family and friends.,1471392000,,430,4.4743589743589745
7767571,5,B01GSMPG4I,"Traveling through the Gospels with Dave Stotts is a journey packed with fascinating adventures as well as a trip filled with enlightening discoveries. Art builds deeper understanding. History confirms scriptural inspiration. Archeology validates biblical truth. Skeptics beware. Daves humorous insights entertain, educate and energize as he guides teenagers in exploring the extraordinary life of Jesus.

7767572,5,B01GSMPG4I,"Incredible!  This is the definitive teaching for the Gospels in the 21st century!  Sure there's good teachings out there but compared to Dave Stotts they are soooo boring!  What's better than Truth and Humor?!?  Whether it's for you, your spouse, your kids, teens, extended family, parents, new believers, pre-believers, or long time believers this is hands-down the single best way to enjoy the awesome biblical scenery of the Holy Land while learning more than you can imagine!  I have seen nearly everything in the last 15 years as the CEO of AllAboutGOD.com--this is THE BEST presentation of the Gospels I have ever seen!  Candy and I could not stop watching ""just one more!""  Do yourself a favor by starting the first show early in the night otherwise it's going to be hard to get up the next morning!",1468800000,4,806,4.797101449275362
7767573,5,B01GSMPG4I,"What an exceptional series! We are loving The Gospels! We have used Drive Thru History as a supplement for our homeschool curriculum in the past. However, this series has been so great for our family devotions in the evening. The whole family is really loving it (even my little ones are sitting still and watching). Personally, I think this is their best work yet. The videography and photography is just stunning. I highly recommend this series!",1468368000,3,447,4.894736842105263
7767574,5,B01GSMPG4I,"Dave is back!  I love this new Drive Thru History series.  The Gospels is the best video tour of Israel I have ever seen.  The new 18-episode format with the discussion/supplement curriculum makes it perfect for bible studies, family devotions, and homeschool bible curriculum.  So much fun.  So educational.  If you love Drive Thru History, this new series is the best one yet!  If you haven't heard of Drive Thru History, you're in for an adventure!",1466380800,9,451,4.855263157894737
8763425,5,B01GSMPG4I,It's always good to see bible in life. Dave Stotts made good video in bringing life to bible study. The video will help to emphasise your impression of the events and stories in the bible. Highly recommended.,1538438400,,208,4.648648648648648

8763427,5,B01GSMPG4I,"""The Gospels"" is by far the best and most important documentary I've ever seen.  You will be informed, entertained, and visually mesmerized as this video takes you back in time and drives you through an unparalleled adventure into the unique birth, life, death, and then resurrection of Jesus of Nazareth, the Messiah, the greatest man of all time.

This is nothing less than an amazing video about the prophesied Savior who would be uniquely born to fulfill the requirements of the Old Testament Law and then face His spiritual destiny written about long ago, for you and for me--for anyone who chooses to believe, as it says, ""Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and you will be saved.

Of all the videos I own, this is by far the one that I cherish the most.  Im really looking forward to the next documentary.",1533686400,,811,4.65034965034965
8763428,3,B01GSMPG4I,"Dave Stotts seems like a knowledgeable and nice gentleman. I only learned a few things from watching all the videos. Some stuff came across that I do not agree with. Plus some guess work. I would not spend the amount of money I spent on it again. Try to rent, check a local library, or buy used. Or do your own research.",1529971200,,320,4.17741935483871

8763434,5,B01GSMPG4I,"This is a great series.  I've read the Bible all my life.  My wife and I read it and study it everyday but Dave Stotts even said some things that opened our eyes to the scriptures.  The segment on feeding the 5,000 and the 4,000 shed light on the entire passages.

Please get this.  You will not be disappointed.  Besides the scenery is breathtaking.",1502409600,5,350,4.390625
