7553411,5,B018J28232,"This season did amazingly at what two previous seasons - Redemption Island and South Pacific - tried and failed.

The editing is spot on. At last, the returnees this season are edited based on what they do and not who they are.

Redemption Island and South Pacific were both hyped as OMG ROB VS. RUSSELL and COACH VS. OZZY and the season seemed very much about them, instead of focusing on the 16 other castaways who were there with them.

Philippines got this right. The returning players are not legends like that of Rob or Ozzy, and as such the players are not caught up in the limelight. Their story also feels like a truly real and good extension, rather than unnecessary.

And as for the newbies, casting kicked it out of the park. Nearly everyone who made the merge is a standout character, and you really find yourself cheering for them, instead of just the returnees.

The season also is helped out greatly by the wonderful return of the 3 tribe format. 3 tribes allow for a much more personal feel, and tribes have a much better focus. With large tribes of 10 people each, the focus only tends tone on three or four players because of the sheer size. With three tribes, every person matters, and there are almost no invisible people this season.

This season is a 9.5/10, and anyone who loves Survivor's classic seasons will love this one.",1448496000,12,1349,4.553719008264463
7553412,3,B018J28232,"Read the other reviews before posting mine here.  Glad to see I was not the only one who's dvd cut out at final tribal.  That just sucked.  Every season has its good and bad, so I won't post my opinion on the actual players.  My only gripe has to do with the DVD and the fact that it is as defective as everyone else's.  Not cool.",1489190400,2,330,3.9393939393939394
7553413,5,B018J28232,"Survivor ""Philippines"" was an excellent season. Loved the different personalities. Hated Johnathan, and Abby. Liked Malcolm and adored Lisa. Denise you took my Lisa's crown. You take the good ,you take the bad. The facts of life. LOL",1489017600,,233,5.157894736842105

7553420,4,B018J28232,I love the show.  The DVD problem is that the bonus scenes did not play on my DVD player and the final tribal council did not play all the way through.  It also took extremely long for the DVD to actually be available to purchase.,1480809600,2,230,4.088888888888889

I have bought every last Survivor and these last two are a huge disappointment!!!!!!!!!! And I just found out ""when I got to the end of Survivor Philippines that it went blank at the end...........you guys don't take much pride in your work anymore. I would like this DVD set replaced or I am not buying anymore Survivor DVD's",1475452800,4,458,4.464285714285714

With that being said, I am EXTREMELY disappointed with the horrible effort out into the quality of these DVDs. If I pay $35 for a NEW DVD, I expect it work when I watch it. Seeing this is a constant problem, is disheartening.
Please fix this problem.",1515110400,,302,4.224137931034483

With the unbeatable combination of obnoxious Abi, heartthrob Malcolm, level-headed Denise,  analytical and conniving Jonathan, and the rest of the crew, there is literally never a dull moment from Day 1 to Day 39.",1497052800,2,263,5.238095238095238
8742497,5,B018J28232,I have been a Survivor fan since the beginning.  Wish I wasn't so old so I could apply to be a contestant.  Wouldn't even care if I was the first one voted off - it just would be so exciting just to be chosen to play.  The only episode I did not watch was the reunion when Cochran won.  He makes me ill.  Wish the latest DVD's would be released soon.  I have them all except the ones Cochran appeared in; not buying those two because he is in them.  So far I have watched them all from the beginning two times.  Guess I am an addict for this show.,1491696000,,547,3.909090909090909
