The ""Equator"" series is a wonderfully filmed, written and narrated nature series. In quality is matches, if not surpasses, the later and much more hyped ""Planet Earth"", ""Life"" series's. Unfortunately, the producers and/or distributors did not market it as successfully. As to the DVD releases, they also made a few blunders:

1. the cover of these DVDs are too gaudy, it makes one think of them as cheap children films. But they are not; they are professionally made nature shows.
2. they did not release them as a box set. In fact, it is very hard to find all the DVDs in the same series.

There are:
1) Power of an Ocean: The Galapagos and Palmyra ...
2) Battle for the Light: The rainforests of South East Asia ...
3) Rivers of the Sun: The mighty Amazon River ...
4) Paradox of the Andes: In Ecuador the equatorial sun ...
5) Reef of Riches: tropical jungle and on the coral reef ...
6) Challenge of Change > the Great Rift Valley ...

One day I will add all of these to my collection.

Note to Discovery: please release a box set of Bluray DVDs!",1292025600,,1119,4.360576923076923
8344132,4,B001UL4HKW,"I liked this disc, in spite of a few problems with it (e.g., the background music tends to drown out the narration at the beginning of the disc). The main location for the story is Borneo. Some amazing footage towards the middle of the disc, especially the weirdest-looking caterpillar I have ever seen. It reminded me of the well-known fossil species Hallucigenia. Also, a mantis that looks like a flower (no kidding!). Recommeded.",1247443200,2,432,4.931506849315069
