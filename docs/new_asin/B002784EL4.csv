8354169,1,B002784EL4,"I watched this movie because it was filmed completely in my hometown. I spent $3 renting it, and I can say that it was a complete waste of my money.",1478476800,,148,3.966666666666667
8354170,5,B002784EL4,"Do you remember watching West Side Story and midway through realizing you're actually watching Shakespeare? That this isn't 1950s New York City, but actually Renaissance England? These Puerto Ricans are actually Capulets and these Italians the Montague?

The Bracelet of Bordeaux is the same thing, but with the French Resistance taking place in a suburb of Houston.

Palatable to children, but with a deep message about the psychology of the Nazi rank and file and collaborators, Bracelet is a true gem. Throughout the tale, we're presented with a deep analysis of why people chose to follow Hitler.

Normally, World War II is too heavy a topic for a kids movie, but this is told in a way that tempers the horror, while still getting the story across. The heroes are flawed, and yet still every bit heroes. When the Americans come and save the day, and the French provide the means for the Nazis' defeat, by way of the titular bracelet, you can't help but cheer.",1475971200,,963,4.789156626506024
8354171,2,B002784EL4,"Oddball as hell.  We made it through maybe 1/2 hour.  Strangely enjoyable for a while....kind of like bad science fiction.

I could easily have rated this movie 1 star, but I've seen much worse!  Ok, and it has a cute dog....but no stars for that.",1423612800,,247,4.4222222222222225
8354172,1,B002784EL4,"It's cheesy, poorly written, chopply shot, badly acted and frankly for those with very simple minds. Might make for a great movie if one has knocked back a lot of drinks or Mystery Science Theater. The only person who enjoyed it was my 5 year old.",1420848000,,247,4.391304347826087
8354173,3,B002784EL4,"This is definitely a low-budget film.  The special effects are made-in-basement quality.  The acting is OK to good.  The script is simple and at times bumpy (doesn't flow well).  The family dynamics are bizarre (they try to make the mother only concerned about her appearance to the community, but it isn't well done).  All of the negatives aside, it is cute and relatively tame and my youngest liked it.  Older kids (anyone over 9 or 10) will be bored out of their minds.  Would rate it 2.5  stars if i could.",1407628800,,510,4.527472527472527
8354174,5,B002784EL4,"Trying to find quality films for nieces & nephews that don't involve superheroes, zombies or vampires is a challenge, so this one
is a true FIND--kids in my family loved it, so will yours, & I thought it was very well written & produced",1374105600,,236,4.386363636363637
8354175,4,B002784EL4,"A strange kid movie that plays off a child's sensibility of the world offering dogs, goofy characters, threatening situations, a bit of magic, and ultimately enpowerment for the little ones.

A young girl and her family move to Texas(lots of poking fun at Texas) where she befriends a french girl(?), and discovers a dognapping ring that ends up stealing their dogs.  They set off to get their pooches back with the help of a magical bracelet that the french girl's grandmother used to fight the Nazi's during WWII.  Whoa!

It sounds pretty heavy duty.  They deal with not only the mob, punkers, and other crooks, but also with everyday stressers, e.g, the obnoxious ice cream seller, a cranky, old neighbor lady, a bully of a shop owner, insects, etc.
Everything is from a child's perspective.

The film makes fun of it all, and of course, the kids win out, but what an ordeal.  It reminds me of childhood, and how the simplest things could be so exagerated and worrisome.  Of course, here there are physically threatening situations with real bad guys.

As an adult, my overall review: ugh!  Get me out of here!
As for my elementary aged children: they were glued to this movie and all the close-ups of the dogs, silliness, and how the girls were going to eventually triumph over the next dilemma.  A big thumbs up!

Cons: Kind of weird with the Nazi thing and lots of child endangerment- even though everyone knows that everything is going to be fine.

Suggestion- to save your sanity, let the kids watch this one while you and the spouse pop in a film of choice in another room.",1346630400,2,1582,4.627240143369176
8354176,4,B002784EL4,I really loved watching this movie.  It's got fresh new stars like Kelsey Edwards and a very kid friendly script.  The fact that this movie didn't have a multi million dollar Hollywood budget makes it even more amazing because the quality is very good.  In my opinion the kids in this movie will go on to do many more acting jobs in the future.  My kids loved this movie and your kids will love it too. It's just good fun to watch for the entire family.  ENJOY!,1278115200,,461,4.252873563218391
8354177,1,B002784EL4,"I have to admit, I've only watched about 30 minutes of this movie, but I just can't take it anymore.  The script is dreadful, the acting is amateur, and even the music is off.  On the other hand, my kids are still watching it.  Apparently if you are under the age of 10, you can take almost anything with a cute dog in it.",1258848000,5,322,4.0
