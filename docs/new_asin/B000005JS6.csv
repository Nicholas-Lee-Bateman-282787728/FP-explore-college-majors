8507267,5,B000005JS6,"Bauhaus defined dark, poetic imagery in music way before ""goth"" was a household word as it seems today. It's a shame this collection is so hard to find, as I spent my impressionable teen years emulating the stark visuals found here. This is pure art reflecting the music's soul, not the typical billion dollar budget pop and flash of today's MTV culture. Peter Murphy thrashing at the end of the chain between the crushing walls has to be seen and the lightbulb as a major prop is highly underrated these days. Fossil goths, come back to your roots. Little gothlings and Mansonites, here's where the art of darkness lies.",971568000,,621,4.706422018348624
8507268,5,B000005JS6,"A collection of Bauhaus' unique videos, including the legendary low budget ""Mask"" filmed in a parking garage (or something like that), perhaps the darkest most distubing video I've ever seen.
If you're looking for something other than the mainstream malarky shown on MTV. Look  into this collection. If you are a fan of bauhaus I am sure you will enjoy  it.",950400000,2,357,4.836065573770492
