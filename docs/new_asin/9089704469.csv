1172833,5,9089704469,"This DVD has so many kinds of sea life - they're all so beautifully filmed, the DVD mesmerized me. I especially love the jellyfish - I can watch them endlessly and not tire of them. The DVD has 12 different kinds of aquariums so you see a LOT of variety from tiny fish up to and including stingrays and even sharks!  It's just an amazing film. I love the music track, not a fan of waves for underwater scenes, but I just mute it if I don't want to listen to anything. I watch it for the fish, not the accompanying sounds. This was filmed so clearly that you seem to be right in there with them. Great Job!!",1407456000,,606,4.092436974789916
1172834,5,9089704469,Absolutely fabulous.  Took me a little time to figure out how to program tracks. But I'm tech challenged.  Played it as background for an ocean themed party.  Added nice ambience.  Next day stared at it for probably an hour.  The jelly fish are mesmerizing.  I am sure I will have it on while I work at home. Very relaxing.  No criticisms.,1407196800,,339,4.459016393442623

aquarium. The picture is so beautifully done.  Very vibrant colors. Makes a perfect gift for people who like the ocean.
I honestly thought I might even get a little water on me if I got too close.

1172841,5,9089704469,"This is a wonderful experience for all ages.  It was watched by seniors and tots and all ages inbetween.  There is something quieting about observing the activity within the various aquariums.  The energetic 2 year old was caught up with the movement and colors.  The adults seemed happy to stop and relax and share this awesome viewing of nature in the sea.  I played it for a dinner party, as background music, and found the room quietly sipping their wine, in appeciation of the beauty.",1361491200,,489,4.705882352941177

7901414,1,9089704469,Don't waste your money. Badly produced.  Music won't play in all scenes.  Junk.  Returning would cost more than CD.  Trashed it.,1486684800,,128,4.9523809523809526
7901415,2,9089704469,"Love the music and sound but the picture quality is not so good.  I have 2 very expensive HD T.V.s and tried this CD on both and the picture is not clear or HD.  Was hoping to get the ""real"" fish aquarium look.  Not at all.",1440979200,,223,3.8043478260869565

7901418,5,9089704469,I do wish a couple of the segments had the sound of bubbles instead of waves but on the whole this video is beautifully done and very relaxing to have on while company is visiting or for some quiet time while reading or just some background sounds.,1418947200,,248,4.297872340425532

7901420,5,9089704469,"Wow!...12 aquariums to choose from.  I like to put it on play all so that it rotates through all 12 of the tanks.  Bright vivid colors...I love that.  You can choose between natural sounds or music.  To me, the music is very soothing and it gives a peacefulness to the entire home.",1418428800,,281,4.346153846153846
7901421,5,9089704469,"This is really one of my favorite DVD's. Very, very relaxing music as is the video. Just calm and gentle music. We use this in our children's play area at work. It really helps to calm down the environment and gives the kids a break from energetic play. They will stop and watch the fish.",1416268800,,288,4.254545454545455
