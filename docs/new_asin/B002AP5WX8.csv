I have a Mac and from what I read in this other review for the Character Design, it won't play on a Mac.  Unfortunately, I didn't read the review here before I bought it and it and nothing in the specs say it's for PC only. I haven't gotten a DVD that only plays on one machine since the last century. It amazes me that Gnomen would create a product for animators that can't be played on a Mac since a Mac is what is usually used by industry professionals.",1394409600,,547,3.8839285714285716
8359945,4,B002AP5WX8,"The video itself was a bit difficult to deal with at first and required me to call Gnomon Workshop to be able to actually get to the information (I am using a Mac) of how to access the files to watch them. It sounds weird, I know, but it was not very user friendly. Once I was able to watch the videos, it was worthwhile.

To start with, I did enjoy the process that Gil went through to create the two characters in this video. He is very talented and I actually will use this video for other purposes such as value drawing and color adjustment. So it was money well spent.

As I teach character design on the university level I am looking for different ways to introduce my student to character design. There are several different ways you can approach drawing the characters, but design is design, whether you are designing a toy, food processor, car, or characters. You research, then start small and coarse with the drawings. Through iteration and experimentation you work through the process adding more and more detail as you go through the process. Gil followed the design process very well. The method that he used to answer some of the design issues were different than I had seen used before. Since he is a very talented and advanced artist, he appears to jump into the finished rendering part of the process very quickly. He used value rendering in his process to work through the structure of the character to be built in 3D. This threw me off a bit at first. What he was doing was following a good design process, but he was using is his rendering skills to get through that process and answer the design questions. For someone that aspires to or has thawt great drawing skill, this is wonderful. Many of my students do not have that fine of drawing skills, so this method may not be used as much...but I will still show it to them and maybe they will come up with a hybrid of this method that works for them.

Although this was not exactly what I expected, it is still a good video, especially for people that do have that fine drawing skill. Our program at the university is still growing and hopefully get to that point where our artist will have that similar skills to Gil (so much to learn in only 4 years). He has given us one more method to use to follow the design process and a higher mark for use to reach as artists.",1358640000,,2340,4.387096774193548
