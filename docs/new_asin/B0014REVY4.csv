8256199,5,B0014REVY4,"Great DVD Series. It has some 10th Planet techniques on it like the Rubber guard and other stuff. I don't think this is the best DVD for a beginner but if you know already the basics and want to add something new give it a try, I learned some techniques and moves that I didn't know so I'm happy with it...5 stars.",1468540800,,314,4.080645161290323
