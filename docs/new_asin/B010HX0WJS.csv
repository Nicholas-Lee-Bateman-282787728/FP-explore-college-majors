7313428,5,B010HX0WJS,"After reading KOTH Season 11 reviews and making a few comments I finally bought the season to see what was the issue with the screen size and so here is what I found.
First I want to preface with my setup: Samsung LNT4665F 46"" 1080p LCD HDTV, an XBOX 360, and a Samsung BD-H5900 3D Blu-Ray Disc Player. The reason I list these is because I think this is key to the conversation.
I tested KOTH seasons 7, 11 and 12 on both the XBOX 360 and the Samsung Blu-Ray player. Each season preformed exactly the same when I tried changing the picture size. On the Samsung Blu-Ray player I was not able to change the picture size AT ALL with the tv or the bluray controller. It simply locked the picture in its proper aspect ratio which is 1.33:1. When I tried all three seasons in the XBOX 360 I was able to use the tv's controller and change the picture size from ""Just Scan"", 4:3, 16:9 and wide fit modes. I was able to do this with Season 11.
I'm writing this so that the folks that are having trouble changing the size to a wide fit mode (to completely fill a widescreen tv) I encourage you to try a gaming console. I find nothing different with Season 11 than with the others.
So the reason I note my setup is because it may be possible the picture size option on certain players is not compatible with Season 11. With my bluray player I can't change it at all on seasons 7, 11 or 12. It could be that those players need to be updated (mine is though). I have no idea. The point of this ""review"" is to say and show proof that you can change the picture size on season 11. The pictures are taken from season 11, episode 1 (The Peggy Horror Picture Show) at 0.50 seconds into the episode.",1444435200,7,1680,4.172307692307692
7313429,5,B010HX0WJS,Season 11 of  K.O.T.H was very humorous and good. I really enjoyed it.,1443744000,,70,4.384615384615385
7313430,5,B010HX0WJS,Love this show so much!,1443484800,,23,3.8
7313431,4,B010HX0WJS,"Sure the size of the picture is small, but its still the greatest cartoon. I am glad they fixed it for season 12",1443052800,,112,3.9130434782608696

7313435,3,B010HX0WJS,"Same as others have been saying, the picture only displays in 4:3 ratio as opposed to the widescreen ratio. It is very annoying, but at least these seasons are finally out on DVD.",1442361600,4,179,4.454545454545454
7313436,1,B010HX0WJS,"I am very disappointed in Olive Films. They are going with the sad trend of putting black bars on the left and right side of the picture on 4:3 fullscreen DVD's.
I could understand if this was a Blu-Ray, but this was just a standard DVD release, so the black bars was NOT necessary!
My biggest complaint is the other DVD's were not like this. In my opinion, they were PERFECT. Why change what everyone was already happy with??
I definitely won't be buying Season 12 and 13 if they have the same issue. I can't stand watching fullscreen TV in a black box.
And yes, I do have 3 16:9 TV's, it's not that I have an old TV. It's the fact I want my TV's to have full picture, not to be forced to watch shows in a black box. With this DVD, you are forced to watch the episodes with the annoying black bars on each side of the screen.
When I realized that was the case, I couldn't even sit through 2 episodes.
If I wanted to watch the episodes in an annoying box guys, I would just watch it on Netflix.
Even when the show airs on Adult Swim, they don't put it in a box. Usually 16:9 TV's have the option to let you add the black bars if that's what you want, so I really don't see how this was useful.
Olive Films, PLEASE make this right. I am not asking for a refund, I'm just asking you guys to SELL people a copy that is like the other releases, without the obnoxious black bars.
Judging by the reviews on here, I'm not the only one who is disappointed with this release.
From now on I definitely won't buy anything from Olive Films that is originally in 4:3 Fullscreen.
I hope they at least correct this error for the fans, because to me this is just totally unacceptable.
When I asked Olive Films about this they just gave me instructions how to change my Blu-Ray/DVD player to 16:9, and that isn't the problem here. Regardless you're stuck watching the picture with a black bar on each side of the screen, thanks to whoever decided it would be a good idea to burn them in the picture. Not everyone likes watching 4:3 TV this way, I definitely don't.
This situation just forces everyone to watch it with the black bars, even if you hate them.
Just so everyone understands, I've attached an actual screenshot from the Season 11 DVD release, the black bars are encoded on the raw picture, it's not something you can get rid of.
This is exactly why I'm so disappointed with this release.
Be sure you don't mind watching TV in a box before you decide to purchase this DVD.
I'm very disappointed with this release, and I hope they decide to fix this.",1442361600,6,2542,4.2541322314049586

I don't believe these come with any extras, but I wasn't expecting any. DVD quality is good, it's all in a single case with those flippy insert pieces to allow for multiple discs in one container.

8722521,5,B010HX0WJS,"I tell you what, man, back in 2006 Fox released the sixth season of KOTH on dvd and shortly after that they announced that they scrapped their plans to release any more seasons of KOTH. Dang it, man, Dang it! The fans went crazy and petitioned Fox to please release KOTH but we just got ignored. That is just bad business Fox, dirty pool, Fox, dirty pool. Now listen up Fox, at Strickland the customer comes first. That is right, the customer comes first. I reckon Fox needs to be schooled on that lesson.

Flash forward to 2014. After nearly nine dang years of praying for this to come out, Olive Films comes to the rescue and starts releasing KOTH on dvd. Now I read some reviews on here and I got mighty scared to buy this, I tell you what. People were saying that their screens would just go black after an episode and not return to the menu, or the dvds wouldn't play, or there are black lines on the side of the picture. I don't know if they got bad copies or what but the set I have plays perfectly. There are no freeze ups and my dvds go back to the main menu after each episode. Every time, man, every dang time. That is all good BUT THERE ARE black bars hard matted on the image like other reviewers mentioned. Someone at Olive done gone and messed up but my friend Ron2900 thought he found a fix, I tell you what. I'm going to let him explain in his own words...

Boomhauer isn't always that easy to understand so we thought I should explain this. When I have a full frame 4:3 dvd I will watch it in 4:3 mode on my tv and there will be black (in my case, gray) bars or I can watch it in 16x9 or screen fit and the image stretches with no black bars. With this season the black bars will not go away in 16x9 or screen fit and when I watch it 4:3 there are black bars in addition to the gray bars on my set so the image is scrunched and the image is too tall and skinny. Someone messed up at Olive and I'm going to contact them about re-authoring these and getting replacement dvds but in the meantime...

I was able to fix the same problem with the Season 12 set and view the show ""normally"" just like the previous seasons by changing the tv type setting in the menu on my Sony dvd player from 16x9 (I have a 16x9 tv set) to the 4:3 letterbox or 4:3 pan and scan setting. You would think it would work with this season too but all it did with Season11 is create a black border that surrounds the entire picture. The only way I could get rid of the black bars was to set my screen resolution to 1280x720 from my dvd player and then set my tv to zoom 1. It is not an optimal solution because the top and bottom of the picture gets cropped but that is the only one I found if you want to fill your entire tv screen. If anyone has a better solution or any questions about setting their player, feel free to comment or email me and I will try my best to help y'all. Back over to Boomhauer...

Those dang ol' Fox flipper dvds, man. No worries, man, no worries. All 12 uncut episodes of Season 11 are on two single sided dual layered dvds. Let me break it on down for y'all:

Disc One:
01 The Peggy Horror Show
02 Serpunt
03 Blood And Sauce
04 Luanne Gets Lucky
05 Hank Gets Dusted
06 Glen Peggy Glen Ross

Disc Two:
07 The Passion Of The Dauterive
08 Grand Theft Arlen
09 Peggy's Gone To Pots
10 Hair Today, Gone Today
11 Bill, Bulk, And The Body Buddies
12 Lucky's Wedding Suit

Video: Black bars aside, the episodes are presented in a solid 1:33 transfer just like they aired. The colors pop and for the most part everything looks good. Sometimes I'll notice some jaggies in certain scenes but it isn't too dang bad or distracting.

Audio: English 2.0 and Spanish 2.0. The audio is clear sounding and I have no complaints.

Subtitles: English

Extras: Boy, I tell you what, man, this dang ol' set just has the episodes and nothing else. Dang ol' bare bones dvd. Dang it!",1501977600,3,3876,4.135458167330677
