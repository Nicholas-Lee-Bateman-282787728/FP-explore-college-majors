8637034,5,B00HX3IA36,"Some time ago I have watched the movie ""Anglique"" by Ariel Zeitoun and must say that I liked it very, very much, more than I expected. Admittedly, the plot differed much from the book and for fans of Anne Golon, who expect a rendition true to the novel this might be a somewhat irritating aspect. If my opinion on this thing is concerned, I think that films are always adaptations and works of their own. But that's up to everybody's personal preferences, of course.

The main strength of this production and people, who carry it on their shoulders, are the two magnificent main actors: Nora Arnezeder as Anglique and Grard Lanvin as her husband Joffrey de Peyrac.

To me Nora Arnezeder was the ideal choice for Anglique, she not only acted very naturally in this complex role and showed the character just like she was in the books by Anne Golon, as a strong, intelligent and independent young woman, but also looked exactly like I pictured Anglique when I read the books and had her aristocratic and fresh beauty. Coming to Grard Lanvin, I had, before watching the film, my doubts concerning his age (in the book Anglique is 17 and Joffrey 29 years old, whereas in the new movie Anglique's age remains unchanged, but Joffrey is forty years older than her), but from the moment I saw his performance my doubts completely disappeared. For he played the character with great sensitivity, charm and charisma and made Joffrey de Peyrac a true grand seigneur that this personage was in the novel.

Strangely enough, the big age difference between Anglique and Joffrey wasn't palpable at all and their love story very credible. I was indeed very surprised by this, for I thought that an age difference that big would be impossible to bridge, but Nora Arnezeder and Grard Lanvin have done the impossible.

Furthermore, there are in particular two very moving scenes, among quite many of that kind, where Nora Arnezeder and Grard Lanvin reach the height of acting skill: the scene where Joffrey is arrested and says goodbye to Anglique and the scene, in which Anglique visits Joffrey in the Bastille. These moments brought tears to my eyes and I have never experienced that before when watching a movie!

Also worth mentioning is the beautiful scene where Anglique and Joffrey make love for the first time. It was very sensual, but also full of tenderness and the viewer could feel the budding love between Anglique and Joffrey. Kudos to the director of photography, Peter Zeitlinger, to whom I will come later, who filmed that scene aesthetically and in good taste.

The nature of the relationship between Anglique and Joffrey progresses however differently than in the book, i.e. Anglique realizes only much later what her husband really means to her.

Coming to the visual side of the film, what is especially noteworthy to me is the fantastic photography by Peter Zeitlinger, shot almost entirely with the use of natural light!

The realistic sets, decorated with much dedication and attention to detail, and the costumes, in case of which the designers, Edith Vesperini and Stphane Rollot, worked with great care in regard to every single item of clothing, like corsets, stockings and chemises, caused that I felt like transplanted into the 17th century.

In my praise I would like mention the enchanting music by Nathaniel Mchaly, which added much to the atmosphere of the production and to which I could listen with great pleasure, even with no picture, only with headphones on.

To sum things up, I think that ""Anglique"" is a beautiful, engaging and immensely romantic rendition of the ""Beauty and the Beast"" fairy tale motive. I'm holding fingers crossed for next parts and keep waiting for them impatiently!

8637035,1,B00HX3IA36,"As an avid fan of the Angelique books and movies (starring Michelle Mercier) of over 30 years I am totally appalled by what has happened in this adaptation. Its hardly possible to follow , is clumsy, and without any depth. As a screenwriter myself I think that the script killed it. I think perhaps Nadia Golon wanted too much control over a book her father wrote - this is conjecture - but it has all the hallmarks of an amateur screenwriter. I would recommend anybody who wants to appreciate this amazing series should either stick to the novels or the original film series .",1474675200,3,577,4.5576923076923075

WARNING: FANS OF THE 1964 FILMS OR THE NOVELS MAY HAVE PRECONCEPTIONS THAT MAKE THIS VERSION MORE DIFFICULT TO ENJOY -- IF WATCHED AS A COMPLETELY INDEPENDENT WORK, YOU MAY FIND IT VERY ENTERTAINING  (see more notes on this below)

NOTE: You can find the Region 1 (Canadian Release) with English subtitles on AMAZON USA here -&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Angelique/dp/B00K801ABA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Angelique</a>

INTRO:  This stunning period adventure has a little feel of Alexandre Dumas with some hints of Leprince de Beaumont (Beauty and the Beast) thrown in. It is gorgeously filmed and well acted (though some in France didn't like the casting).  Despite the overtones of Beauty and the Beast I mentioned (Angelique has to adjust to the less attractive Peyrac), this tale is blended with a much broader adventure story worthy of romance adventures past.  Though there is a nice romance at the center of this tale, there is plenty of sword play and tons of court intrigue as well. It's based on the novel series by Anne and Serge Golon.

THE PLOT (no spoilers):  Beautiful and independent Angelique has been betrothed to the wealthy Count de Peyrac in order to restore her family's strained financial situation.  It is said he is disfigured and unattractive despite his grand wealth and ancient name.  Angelique goes reluctantly to her new life and informs Peyrac that she is her own woman.  To her surprise, Peyrac is quite intelligent and progressive. He has no intention of forcing her into a physical relationship though he is smitten by her wild beauty and independent nature.  Part of Peyrac's wealth comes from his mine and ability to separate the gold using a technique not known in France.  This makes him a target of jealousy for other nobles, the inquisition based in Toulouse (the same region of his holdings), and even the king himself.  As their relationship develops, powerful forces are moving against them.  However, Angelique unwittingly becomes the real target as a terrible secret comes to light.  Through a series of events, it becomes known that Angelique was witness to a plot to kill King Louis IVX when she was a young girl.  Further, she stole papers from the plotters which hold their names.  Young Angelique had to hide the papers before being caught, so she did not see who the plotters were.  They also did not know who she was until she tells the story to a confessor and is unknowingly betrayed.  The rest of the tale is a process of discovery and tenderness between the Count and Countess de Peyrac, and the conflict that is forming to destroy them.

WHY SOME VIEWERS DIDN'T LIKE IT:  This movie was not well received by the French public and critiques alike.  However, the reasons are those that may not affect many American viewers.  The movie has far too short of a run time to be very faithful to the novels.  Also, there was a movie series beginning in 1964&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Angelique-Collection/dp/B0013XZ6MU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Angelique Collection</a>&nbsp;which was very well beloved and created many preconceptions of what each character should be like.  This movie did not match those expectations despite competent and popular actors.  Peyrac is also quite a bit older in this version where in the books I believe he was around 27.  However, his age (maybe mid to late 40's) in this version suits his level of education and experience.  The movie also skips from one stage to the next with not quite enough connection or story construction.  It cold have used a little more development.

FINAL THOUGHTS:  Despite the nit picks here and there, this is still a terrific story with gorgeous cinematography and costumes.  One of my favorite little castles was used in the filming though it's actually in Belgium (Chateau de Beloeil).  The castle used for Peyrac was also just plain gorgeous!  If one can accept the sometimes unceremonious scene changes and lack of comparability to book and original film, this is still an excellent period adventure.  The romance at times is actually on the edge of eroticism and there is a fairly sensual love scene.  This would generally fit an R rating.  Nora Arnezeder is stunning and does a terrific job of projecting the intelligence and willfulness of Angelique.  Again, I won't give anything away, but realize this movie only covers part of a much greater story of Angelique.  There is absolutely closure given at the end so you don't have to worry about that, but it may not be exactly what one expects.  If this movie interests you, I suggest watching before going back to the 1964 movies or reading the books.",1447977600,5,4806,5.101152368758003
8637037,5,B00HX3IA36,"Anglique, the literary child of writers Anne and Serge Golon, got me interested in history back in high school.  Each of the novels are passionate, exciting, and all the adventure I could hope for, and the stories were true!  Anglique herself was not a real person, but Louis XIV, Desgrez, Monsieur, La Voisin, and all the other characters were taken right from the history books, and much in the books that was researched by the Golons was far too racy to be in any history book.

Then to see that someone had made a new film of my favorite heroine was a delight!  It's a lavish production, and I bought the Canadian version for American DVD players, and it was subtitled in English, too.

I cannot recommend this film and heroine highly enough!!!",1415318400,5,748,4.593984962406015
