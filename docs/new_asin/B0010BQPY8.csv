One of the best parts is that the video shows the settings that work best for each type of video and for each place you place your videos.

Using the correct setting is the secret to having great looking videos that are simple to post online.

Watching this video saved me a lot of time and prevented many mistakes. I'm glad I didn't have to learn all of these techniques the hard way.
