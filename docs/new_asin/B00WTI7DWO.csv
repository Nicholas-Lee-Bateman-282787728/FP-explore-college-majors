8714216,4,B00WTI7DWO,Another great PWG show! I'd give it five stars but the self indulgent Chris hero matches are getting old. Otherwise an awesome card!,1437004800,,132,4.782608695652174
8714217,5,B00WTI7DWO,Absolutely incredible. Main event was insane as well as the rest of the card. Another must buy from PWG,1435190400,,103,4.473684210526316
8714218,5,B00WTI7DWO,"Zack Sabre Jr. was challenged at the previous show by P.W.G. Champion Roderick Strong & accepted it here in a match that featured many sequences of counters & reversals along with each man focusing on a specific body part with Zack using unique submissions while Strong was very impactful but calculated.  P.W.G. Tag Team Champions World's Cutest Tag Team faced off against the Beaver Boys in a non-title match that saw both teams use double teaming as Beavers be very aggressive trying to isolate one teammate from their partner while the champions took their opponents to ""Balls-plex City.""  Other matches include Monster Mafia against off against Matt Sydal & Chris Sabin in a clash of mat-based wrestling against athletic aerial style, Biff Busick vs. Brian Cage in match where both showcased some impactful & intense style, Mike Bailey vs. Trevor Lee saw what was definitely the most painful move I've never seen done on a ring apron, Tommy End facing off against Chris Hero in a match that was MMA/kickboxing oriented with strong strikes from both men while Excalibur went into ""professor"" mode on commentary giving the history of Tommy with the most knowledge on a competitor than I've ever heard before, ACH vs. Tomasso Ciampa in a competitive match that saw cameos from ""Stone Cold"" & ""Mutumbo"", and Andrew Everett vs. Ricochet in a heavy athletic & high flying encounter.

This was your typical P.W.G. show where you saw a hybrid of different wrestling styles throughout the night & was a fun enjoyable show I recommend.",1433635200,,1530,4.945525291828794
