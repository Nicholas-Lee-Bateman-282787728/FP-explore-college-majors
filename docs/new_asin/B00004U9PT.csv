7923839,4,B00004U9PT,"The Naxos Musical Journey DVD's are a nice way to relax and also to see places most of us may never get a chance to visit. Or they are places we have been and want to remember.  The music is
well performed and the visuals are usually nice to look at.",1008288000,8,250,3.9019607843137254
7923840,3,B00004U9PT,"Starting with a typical norwegian waterfall, this DVD brings us Griegs  Folk and Dance Melodies and the Piano concerto in A minor Op 16. The Sound  is available in DD 5.1 and DTS 5.1 where the DTS sound slighty sounds  better. The picture quality is rather poor - but not the most important  part. To speak about the sound. It is clear and and shows dynamic in the  lower and higher parts but it is not as good as a true Grieg lover might  want it to be. So i reccomand it for starters who want to get in touch with  Griegs music and for the others i hope we get a real high end recording by  a world famous orchestra sometimes (not the usual eastern europe radio  symponic orchestras)",969321600,8,685,4.207692307692308
