7179535,2,B00XQ2EQH2,"I wish I could say something other than ""terrible"" but I can't. Complete waste of these fine actors' talents.  Heart-breaking in beginning, and, after maybe five minutes worth of happiness, it goes downhill from there.  I was looking forward to something entirely different. A big let down!",1438473600,2,290,5.148936170212766
7179536,1,B00XQ2EQH2,"I love the actors, they did a good job, there was no hope.  I cried from the beginning when Carol's dog died.  The romance between Sam and Blythe was moments long before he died.  I drug my husband to this movie telling him it was a comedy.  Sad, sad, sad movie.  Again, the actors did a great job, love them all, but very depressing film.  Don't go unless you want to cry because you are sad...",1438300800,7,395,4.131578947368421
7179537,1,B00XQ2EQH2,"Okay, I talked my husband into going to this movie for a date night.  Hey - older stars, love story - can't go wrong, right?  Yes, Blythe Danner is charming as a widow on her own.  Yes, it has Sam Elliott. .But this is not a romantic movie (maybe her coming out as a lesbian made her not want a romance with a male star?) and its actually just some really good actors stuck in a sad, somewhat boring script. ""Pointless life, continued"" is the best way to describe this.  I pre-ordered this, based on the commercials and, after seeing the movie, cancelled the order.",1437696000,8,565,4.352380952380952
7179538,5,B00XQ2EQH2,"This is an extraordinarily restrained and nuanced movie.  Succeeds by not trying too hard -- to make us laugh or cry or leave us with some epiphany.  I wanted to see it because of Blythe Danner and she was everything I expected and hoped for.

The movie had its obligatory cliches -- the curious pals, the I've seen this a hundred times scene of the ladies who get stoned and then get stopped by a cop.  But OK I can live with it.  The rest of the movie more than compensates.  Without hitting you over the head, the movie delivers the message that it is better to be open to messy  love and loss than to live in a tidy and insulated safety.  This is a sad movie but no sadder than life itself.

There were some loose threads (why is Carol so distanced from her daughter?) and to the movie's credit, it does not try to tie everything
 up with a bow.  This movie has some of the obligatory trappings of a rom com but it is at its heart a tender and perceptive portrayal of loneliness and aging.  I hoped it would be good: it was better than expected.",1436400000,2,1049,4.164179104477612
7179539,3,B00XQ2EQH2,"I saw this today in our local old, run down theater.  Maybe it was the lack of atmosphere, I don't know.  I've enjoyed Ms. Danner in other films, as well as Sam Elliott,  but something was missing.  Maybe there just wasn't enough of the movie.  I won't spoil the ending, but Sam Elliott sure got short changed.  I think they should have cut out some of the wine drinking and hanging out with Lloyd and focused on Sam Elliott's relationship.
A good looker like that with a boat!  How could that have gone wrong?  They should have sailed into the sunset together.",1436227200,2,561,4.431372549019608
7179540,5,B00XQ2EQH2,"""I'll See You in My Dreams"" fortunately focuses on the lovely Blythe Danner, the Tony and Emmy winning actress, portraying Carol Peterson in the lead role which I found her overdue for. She easily brings us a quite diverse woman who has been married to the love of her life for years and is now two decades widowed. She has a generous amount of grand friendships in Sally (Rhea Perlman), Rona (Mary Kay Place) and Georgina (June Squibb) whom I first saw in the movie ""Nebraska"" (She was brutally amazing to me in Alexander Payne's film). Along with these three girlfriends who wish for her to move into their community setting, are male admirers, a special friend along with her daughter, Katherine Peterson (Malin Akerman). She needs to come back together with their relationship; to reconnect on many different levels along with her own self. But of all of these very important relationships, she has her dog ""Hazel"". Many people feel that their pet goes through life with them for years and are a part of each memory of the small and huge events which happen to them. The significance of Hazel is imperative to Carol.

I didn't know much of anything about this movie upon going to see it, except for the delightful ensemble cast along with my long amount of time spent looking at the movie poster. Little did I know that this movie, written by Marc Basch and Brett Haley then directed by Brett Haley is an absorbing character study of Carol's day to day life which answered the questions raised to whether she is happy and in sync with it. For me, this was thought-provoking; a drama which also added an appreciated thread of subtle humor running through it along with just the right amount of romance to keep the storyline tight. She is content in her own home filled with the amenities she has naturally grown to love and is comfortable with over the years. Carol has no qualms about living there alone while developing an interesting friendship and sharing wine with Lloyd (Martin Starr, one of the stars of the sitcom ""Freaks and Geeks""); her depressed friend. He now cares for her pool and offers her some illuminating conversations to ponder. After a devastating incident for Carol, which is neither underdone nor overplayed but perfectly rendered emotionally, she has much to now reconsider. She does take the stage at a night of Karaoke as she comes from a musical background and opens up as she is beginning to see that aging does open up a world of new possibilities and joy. This is never simply an ending of her story, but the desired purpose for broadening it out.

A chance meeting with Bill (Sam Elliot) allows her some stimulating new company and steers her journey in ways in which she may begin questioning for her own direction in life. He lives a life of self-involvement, does not believe in saving his large amount of money but spending it on whatever it is that he wishes to do. Basically, he does just as he pleases. It is an exciting and heady experience for Carol to be with Bill. Will she now wish for another man to enter her life to fill a void in her single life? After all the different things that just may lie in front of Carol and all that is behind her; is everything that she has now at this juncture in life, the people she knows and loves while staying put truly enough for her? It is Carol's time and Carol's choice. It is easy for the viewer to see that her age is simply a number but the total of her experiences, no matter the number, are always countlessly enriching by their nature for the way which Carol views her world while going forward.",1435449600,103,3589,4.562790697674418
7179541,5,B00XQ2EQH2,"Brett Haley wrote (with March Basch) this little jewel of a film and directed it with such sensitivity that it becomes a tender study of aging and what matters in a life lived and now in a holding pattern. Yes, the film rests solidly on the extraordinarily capable shoulders of Blythe Danner as the central character, but the entire cast is so well in tune with the message of the film that it is an experience that should be seen by a very large audience.

Carol (Blyth Danner) is a widow and former songstress whose best friend is her aged dog and when that dog dies she discovers that life can begin anew at any age. With the support of three loyal girlfriends (June Squibb, Rhea Perlman, and Mary Kay Place), Carol decides to embrace the world, embarking on an unlikely friendship with her pool maintenance man (Martin Starr, a very fine young actor), pursuing a new love interest (Sam Elliott), and reconnecting with her daughter (Malin Akerman). Not everything turns out well but Carol rescues an unwanted old dog from the pound and reflects on a life of ups and downs and a lot of memories  and the circle of life continues.

So many beautiful moments in this quiet little film suffused with sensitivity, possibilities, humor (her fellow elderly friends are very funny) that it is one of those films to be remembered. Grady Harp, June 15",1435449600,73,1344,4.638655462184874
7179542,4,B00XQ2EQH2,"And this is the main reason to see this movie - to see Blythe Danner in a challenging lead film role. I've been watching Danner since the early 70's turning in one terrific acting performance after another - in mostly small supporting roles. I believe the first thing I ever saw her in was an old episode of M*A*S*H, where she played Hawkeye's ex-fianc. She was very good in that.

But at any rate, in general, this's a very entertaining, if predictable, movie that is obviously aimed at the geriatric set (but I can't see any reason why anybody of any age wouldn't be able to enjoy it).

Let me see...what else...oh, yeah, I hadn't seen Rhea Perlman, best known as Carla from Cheers, in anything lately and she is very funny in this playing very much a Carla-type of character, complete with the Carla-like sarcasm and accent. Hilarious. Sam Elliott also contributed an admirable acting performance as well.

But the main reason to see this film is to see Danner in a lead role that she is able to sink her teeth into. Very good performance. Not one false note. Much recommended.

Postscript - Written June 10, 2015

My original review is located above the above line. I originally gave this movie only three stars because I felt that it was fairly much predictable throughout and because the story really didn't seem to offer anything in the way of originality and/or of depth. But I knew there was something there, it was just having trouble coming to the fore.

I think I figured out what this movie had to offer, at least to me, in terms of something in the way of originality and/or of depth.

(I guess I should indicate that the following should be accompanied by a spoiler alert. If you haven't seen the movie, you should probably skip reading the following.)

The movie starts out by showing the elderly main character, played by Danner, living by herself, widowed, for the past 20 years, with no one but her faithful dog, Hazel, by her side. Then something happens to Hazel, and Danner finds herself living completely alone. With a bit of nudging from some of her lunatic friends, she decides that being in a relationship with a new guy probably wouldn't be such a bad thing. So she hooks up with a guy, and they wind up getting about as deeply involved as a couple can within a short period of time. But then something happens to the guy, and Danner finds herself alone again. So what does she do? She winds up getting another dog.

But here's the thing. If this were your typical movie of this ilk, it would show Danner bored and lonely out of her mind, taking her loyal and loving dog, Hazel, for granted. She would lose the dog, but it wouldn't have much of an effect on her, because she was taking the dog for granted. And then along comes a guy, and there are fireworks. There are fireworks galore and she emerges from her shell and she's almost literally dancing in the street. But then when she loses the guy, she falls back into her melancholy. End of movie. You're driving home wondering what is going to become of this poor woman. She had been living in that shell for 20 years and emerges only to be clobbered over the head. Will she fall into a deep, dark depression or will she gather the strength to go out and find another guy?

Isn't that the way movies of this ilk usually work? You've seen a whole bunch of them like that, right?

But that's not how this movie proceeds. What a breath of fresh air. A bit of reality. When Danner lost her beloved Hazel, she was devastated. The scene in which they showed her in the vet's office, sitting right in front of Hazel as the dog is being put down, is devastating. It really grabs you by the throat. And it reminds you of all the times in your life when you've thought to yourself, ""I'd rather spend a day with my beloved, loyal dog than with most people I know."" And then there's the courtship with the new guy. She hasn't seen anyone or been with anyone since her husband died. It's firmly established that she had had a wonderful marriage, and she sincerely and seriously doubts that he could be replaced. So at any rate, she meets this guy, and he's a peach of a guy and they get along quite well, and she's having a good time, but there isn't much in the way of fireworks. She's not dancing in the street, and she takes being in this new relationship in stride. Then he goes away, she loses him and misses him, and she decides that it was a nice interlude, and she enjoyed it, but that she was going to go back to the company of a dog.

And what is wrong with that? Was she ever in a shell in the first place? She has a nice relationship with her daughter and she hangs out with her lunatic friends, her friends who keep her on her toes on a regular basis. Was she ever in a shell? I don't think so. I don't think it was wrong of her to think that her husband couldn't be replaced. I really don't. It seemed so much more realistic. And she paid a price for getting involved with the new guy, just as she paid a price for gettting involved with Hazel in the way that people get emotionally involved with a beloved pet. In the end she decides to go back to her old way of life. It was not a life of living in a shell. She had lived a full, satisfying life. She took a brief detour down a road and experienced a little bit of adventure and romance and then decided that she would go back to her old life. It all just seems so much more reasonable and realistic and balanced.

What can I say. I've decided that this movie had something of depth and of originality to offer me. Consequently, I'm bumping it up to four stars. Whatever.",1433721600,20,5697,4.418493803622497
7179543,5,B00XQ2EQH2,"This was a very touching and sweet drama by Brett Haley.  Blythe Danner's performance is worthy of Oscar consideration.  There is nothing over the top in this movie.  Blythe plays a widow who is left well enough off that she belongs to a country club, plays golf with her female friends (supporting cast is also excellent), enjoys good wine, and is basically able to live life as she chooses.  What the movie does really well is to show you how settling into a routine and becoming complacent isn't really living.  New people enter her life (Starr and Elliott) and new friendships are forged that cause an awakening in Carol (Blythe Danner) that is life-affirming.  A great film with a great cast!  A must see!",1433116800,32,710,4.67741935483871

It turned out to be a very heartwarming movie about a woman who is not as content being alone as she tries to convince herself she is. Because of the pain she experienced when her husband passed away, she refuses to let herself become too emotionally attached to anyone or anything. At the very end she finally let's go of the fear of loss. For those reviewers who said there was no point at the very end, they clearly didn't understand why she chose a dog that she knew would die in a year or two.

7179636,4,B00XQ2EQH2,"My husband and I enjoyed watching this movie, although it might not appeal as much to a younger audience.  Blythe Danner does a fine job in her role as Carol, a still attractive long-widowed woman.  Carol lives alone and has had to have her beloved dog put to sleep which makes her even more sad and lonely.

She has three old friends she visits in a retirement community to plays bridge with. Carol becomes friendly with her much younger pool cleaning guy and he takes her to a karaoke bar one night.  She was a singer as a younger woman and belts out ""Cry Me a River"" there.  Her friends convince her to join them in a senior speed dating session at their retirement home.  She hates it.  Then she accepts a request for a date from Sam Elliot.  (Who wouldn't?)  He takes her out on his boat that he calls ""So What"".

That's all I'll tell you about the story.  I expect it will be best enjoyed by an audience of middle age or older.  Younger viewers probably won't get it.",1504569600,2,973,4.285714285714286

The story line had promise, and veteran Blythe Danner is first-rate, however, it was evident she didn't have her heart in this role.
The 'characters' were bland and character-less, particularly, Lloyd.
How much did we get to know them? A bit of back story, yes, but character is revealed through conversation, quirks, personality, opinions, passions, dislikes, all that flavorful stuff that makes character was lacking here....so why should we care about them? They were cardboard cut-outs.
Even the brief love affair was dull and without heart. The morning the two lovers wake together in bed, they're quite a distance from each other, and the scene is shot from the over the foot of the bed...weird.
Nearly every scene was rather awfully done. When Carol finally lets go her reserve and lets her grief wash over her, she seems ... tentative. Grrrr!

Some reviewers obviously took this very differently than I. To me, it was hopeful, generous, and warm in its assessment of the resiliency of the human character. And Blythe Danner's portrayal was reflective of her own response to life's challenges.

A solid release. I enjoyed the film, and though it's a tad on the melancholy side, there was a nice bit of humor to help it along. Some reviews peg it as too sad, too self-centered, not plucky enough... but this isn't really a romance. It's a story about a woman who has dealt with everything life has thrown at her, but never really dealt with herself. Maybe her struggles aren't all that monumental, but they don't really need to be. I would watch it again.",1498003200,2,554,4.55
7179702,2,B00XQ2EQH2,"Sad from beginning to end and drags horribly. Makes growing old seem like pure torture and boring while Blythe Danner plays the key role like she is sleep walking.  And if you care about animals, it is really depressing with her dog dying at the very beginning and even a cute rat being collected to be killed.  Only good at the very end when she rescues and adopts a dog from a shelter (instead of going to a pet store or breeder thank goodness!).  Then the misinformation about medical marijuana is really poor, portraying it has having hallucinatory properties which it does not.  Overall, not an uplifting movie and I guess that was the point to portray aging ""realistically"", but failing.",1497916800,,693,4.702479338842975

This movie makes me REALLY regret that. She's amazing in it from start to finish (and will make you laugh and cry interchangeably). Some reviews I read beforehand made me nervous I was getting into some sort of It's Complicated meets Something's Gotta Give romcom, but that is not what this is at all. It's about the character's (Carol's) life, and how she navigates feeling lost- a theme perfectly paralleled by Martin Starr's Lloyd (another brilliant performance).",1497484800,,612,5.009803921568627

7179744,4,B00XQ2EQH2,"I won't give 5 stars because of the characters using the Lord's name in vain, constantly drinking and mocking the people who showed up for the speed dating occasion. Rather ridiculous that Carol wakes up by alarm clock. What 's that all about? She's retired, nothing is going on in her life that requires being up and at 'em. Not only that, but old folks have an inner alarm that wakes them up early anyhow. Okay, that's out of the way so I'll endorse the film and write that I loved the story, the chemistry between Blythe and Sam was delicious. Sam was charming, attentive and Blythe was gorgeous and mildly flirtatious. Her relationship with the younger pool guy was endearing. I really loved the film but do not believe anyone could drink as much as Carol did and still look that good and still be standing upright. It's a sweet movie.",1495497600,,839,4.526315789473684

The writer tried to make it funny but to me it was still depressing and I thought the ending would get better.  It never did.  I hate bad endings.  If you are over 50 and single this movie is NOT for you.  Depressing to say the least.  Not one of Sam Elliott's best.

Even though she had friends she was still lonely.  Then she met Bill and that hard shell around her started to crack.

Spoiler Alert - I am a romance author, and as such, all romance stories must have, if not a happy ending, at least a satisfying one. It's a rule of the genre. Four old ladies deciding to go on a cruise to Iceland is not my idea of a happy ending. Nor is the heroine of this story having a lovely several dates with a sexy man, then having him die shortly after they've had a night of incredible sex. It just shouldn't be done. Here's how I would have ended this movie. Carol and Bill would have married. The pool man, Lloyd, and Carol's daughter, Kath, would have fallen hard for each other, and the final scene would be Carol singing in the karaoke bar to the enjoyment of all.  And of course, everyone would live happily ever after. That's how you end a romance.",1480809600,,914,4.376470588235295

7181134,5,B00XQ2EQH2,"Spoiler Alert.
Carol (Blythe Danner) is woman of a certain age who lives alone in an upscale residence in Southern California.
 She was a teacher and singer, was married to a man killed in an aircraft accident twenty years ago, has a grown daughter who lives in New York, and has led a reclusive life since then, apparently living from her husbands insurance benefits. One can conclude that she has above average intelligence, and over the intervening 20 years should have made some friends in her professions and availed herself of their support resources, sought companionship, developed a closer relationship to her daughter, and expanded adult interests. These activities would sustain healthy grievance resolution and empathetic character development. She has not pursued them.
Her pet dog becomes terminally ill, and we are privileged to witness his euthanization in the vets office.
In the following scenes, we often see her use alcohol, in what some would think excessively for a senior.
One of the recurring weaknesses in this film is its failure to develop character in the supporting cast that contributes to appreciation of the films objective. For example, Carol befriends a young pool maintenance man at her residence, goes to a karaoke bar with him, where she drinks, and sings for him. His character is two-dimensional and the actor who plays him does without emotion. One wonders where could this relationship possibly go.
A message on her telephone answering machine from her daughter Katherine advises her of a planned visit. One would expect Carol to have confirmed the visit, but she did not, placing the relationship at risk. When Katherine does visit, in what is just short of a cameo appearance, the opportunity to understand their relationship and nature of their character is lost in a brief conversation.
Carol reluctantly attends a speed-dating episode at the local assisted living residence. The stereotypic depiction of participants is demeaning, and precludes the chance of making a successful date.
At the assisted living facility, she is sought out by Bill (Sam Eliot) a well-to-do retired entrepreneur. He romances her in a low-key fashion. We have no further knowledge of his character. On the third date they have apparently unprotected sexual relations at her home. What STDs he was harboring we could only guess because a man of his stature, wealth and demeanor could attract younger sexually active partners who have an increased occurrence of these easily transmissible diseases.
Subsequently, Bill dies suddenly.
She buys an older rescue dog.
Nowhere in this story does Carol introspectively examine her circumstances. There is not even a hint that she understands that she is responsible for her own happiness and the consequences of her poor decisions. Without character development, empathy for her plight is hard to come by. Character development in this story was generally inadequate, suggesting deficiencies in casting, film direction, and script.
Based on the above analysis, there is much to be learned from this film.  It is a story of how not to approach seniority.",1478563200,6,3117,5.219560878243513
7181135,1,B00XQ2EQH2,"I watched this movie for one reason only: Sam Elliot. Sadly, the film is obsessed with the musings of its dull-as-nails main character, Blyth Danner (ever hear of her? Didn't think so) a self conscious, sad, but otherwise good natured, high primp,  late septuagenarian single with very bad hair. To round out the fascinating screenplay, she has an innocuous, shallow, undefinable relationship with a pool boy and is terrorized by a tree rat that enters the house to her extreme agitation and horror....--The thing is, Sam Elliot, who has all the charm and acting acumen any movie could dare hope for, gets a cameo, pretty much, with about 40 lines to his credit before he is mysteriously killed off. Her dog dies, Sam Elliot dies, and the tree rat that terrorized her is live captured by the pool boy and allowed to live. Sad that everything dies, so, let's at least let the rat live. If this is a film about aging gracefully and picking up on the cheerful breadcrumbs of life...well, it does accomplish one thing: it takes the term ""depressing"" to a new record high.",1478563200,,1067,4.705882352941177

I like to think that these 3 fine actors (Danner, Elliott & Pearlman) found themselves in such a situation with this dreadfully shallow, predictable and trite fabrication.  There can't be any other explanation!

Don't wast your time unless you want to end up feeling as hollow and depressed as the plot and overall tone of this cheap piece of fluff.  So disappointing -- and I'm a dog-lover!",1478476800,,612,4.912621359223301

How Gwenyth Paltrow came from Blythe Danner, I'll never know. Blythe is the ""anti-Gwenyth"".  She's authentic, she's talented, she's beautiful, she's classy.  Her acting seems almost too real.  As if she's not acting, because she's just that way in real life.  I really enjoyed her voice when she sang, and loved the way Lloyd looked at her.  I love everything about Blythe. I want to be her.
Sam Elliot  His voice and mustache will go down in history as the BEST.
The story of Carol was wonderful, and honest.  I loved the cast and how they interacted with each other. The opening scene with Hazel, broke my heart within the first 5 minutes.  The pot scene, the munchies store scene, the cop scene.  The scene on the boat with Carl.  Kareoke with Lloyd, who by the way has come along way since the nerdy kid with thick glasses in Superbad :) Seeing Rhea Pearlman again made my heart smile as well.",1477699200,,958,4.485549132947977

7182016,4,B00XQ2EQH2,"Nice film - off beat and fresh. Blythe Danner is always a solid presence and she proves to hold the screen and viewers' attention well in this film. The story isn't anything outrageous - just a 'senior' woman making it through the challenges life brings after 60. Husband and I are mid fifties, so we thought the movie would be relatable to us and it was. No storyline cliches, which I ( as a writer myself ) appreciated. Worth the rental!",1475539200,,439,4.432098765432099

7182082,3,B00XQ2EQH2,I liked most of the movie and would recommend it but the ending just drops off and doesn't finish well.

Or shops or does anything else. She meets Sam Elliott. He is charming and alive. They sleep together. Once. He dies. She gets depressed. And drinks and then buys a dog. The end.

 Who cares? I didn't. I really, really wanted to. But after 90 minutes of wishing it would get better, I wanted to kill myself. I'm 59. If that's what's left, forget it. And she had duck lips!!! Don't watch unless you like to be depressed.",1470182400,,763,4.291666666666667

7184627,3,B00XQ2EQH2,"Although the pace of this movie is kind of slow, it's an accurate representation of what older American women go through in their lives. Blythe Danner has always been one of my favorite actors of all time and Sam Elliott's portrayal of her love interest is his usual cowboy self in a grayer package.
The scene where Danner's best friends get together to play cards and Danner asks Rhea Perlman if she still has medical marijuana--then these older women get stoned and raid the local grocery store for junk food because they have a super case of the munchies and while they walk back with a shopping cart and the cop stops them to ask why four older women are walking alone in the streets that late at night--well, it's one of the funnier scenes I've seen in latter-day movies.
(Spoiler alert!) The movie winds up ending just about where it started. We older Americans aren't the usual party-hearty animals we once were and prefer a life dominated by quiet and routine. Once we hit our 50s we don't think about relationships or sex that much anymore, but when we find something that expands (and contracts) our world, it's sometimes nice to feel wanted or needed again.
The one thing that caught my eye in this movie was the daughter. Nowadays, it's not the norm that children stick by their parents when they're older. The portrayal of the daughter was thoughtful and caring about her mother, but just not realistic.
Overall, the ensemble cast meshed together like older women tend to do and was a believable portrayal of upper-middle class retired people.
Oh, don't miss the speed dating scene, especially when the older man man tells Danner about how important sex is in his life and doesn't care if she has herpes or aids. BELIEVE ME when I say there are more horny older men out there who would practically beg for the opportunity to have sex with anyone. Women don't see the sex as a primary motivation for a relationship, but men are men and they always lead with the small head.",1468022400,,1985,4.626062322946176

It had tears, laughter, friendship and the coming to terms with being alone, yet being quite well adjusted and having a full life. What more could you ask for? PS Yes, the loss of her dog at the beginning caused me to weep uncontrollably, but that is part of having an animal as part of your family. I think it was part of her heart from the get go...showing her journey and her sensitivity. I have animals and could seriously relate to the vet scene. It had me weeping.

My husband will witch a lot of romantic comedies with me but I'm not sure the pace of this would be fast enough. But that's what I liked about the movie, the gentle pace. And they did a great job developing the quirky pool guy's character.  And my husband is also not going to sit and drool over Sam Elliott with me. Sam is definitely aging but I don't care.

7185393,5,B00XQ2EQH2,"This movie, as other reviewers mentioned, did not have an easy romantic fun ending, however it was still hopeful. It felt true to life to me, and while sad, also beautiful and full of love.  If you like slow, thoughtful, heartfelt movies with excellent acting, and portrayal of realistic experiences without any violence, explicit sex, or any even any cursing that I can remember, then you will probably enjoy this movie. It was a rare treat for me because of the beauty and gentleness with which it explored the main character's life experiences as she tried to figure out how to find more meaning and live in the moment more. I am 33 and even though the life experiences matched my mother's more closely than mine on the surface, I could relate with everything she was going through.  I so wished she could find a romantic relationship again before the end of the movie, but it just wasn't that kind of movie...it was more like a movie that is grappling with the loss involved with aging and loving, and also I think ultimately saying that it's worth it to put yourself out there, have new experiences, and grow attached to people and pets, even if you risk getting hurt. It is saying that new experiences and love (all kinds) are what make life worth living.",1465948800,4,1261,4.6

She loses her husband years ago and then her dog more recently. She goes about life meeting her friends, dealing with a rat in her residence, singing karaoke with the pool boy, trying speed dating and then being romanced by an older guy (Sam Elliot). At times funny the movie seemed a bit flat to me though the acting was fun to watch. It was pleasant but not great, enjoyable but not awesome and yet perhaps far more realistic then similar movies where we all deal with aging.",1464912000,,646,4.391666666666667

Two things had us turn it off: 1. Blythe Danner is a good actress, but this was boring and because of that 2. The sound was not working. The background sound and music were overpowering the dialog. We could hardly hear what was going on. Therefore, a waste of our time. Other films and TV shows on Amazon that same night did not have this issue, so we chalked it up to this film (we have had other shows and films with this same issue and as with this, others at the same time did not, therefore we chalk it up to these in particular).",1464652800,,737,4.082758620689655

A little further into the movie and she meets and goes on a couple of dates with Sam Elliott, is starting to like him and then he dies !

7186719,2,B00XQ2EQH2,"The film portrays the lives of a group of seniors, active yet without faith, facing their final years, living on a decent retirement income, lonely, without true purpose, without hope, but accepting this as the way things are. The bleakness of this film is gentled by the insertion of moments of connection, a pet dog, a romance though of course the sex-without-marriage agenda is pushed, friends around a card table, a friendly pool guy - everyone is stuck and/or un-tethered. While it portrays the issues which face those who transition from the schedule of the working world to non-working, it doesn't show healthy ways to adapt and move forward. The best it offers as a way to cope is to drink and get high, maybe take a trip or do some karaoke while you and your loved ones move inexorably toward death. The acting is ok - good to watch actors one hasn't seen in awhile. Great photography, some lovely images of SoCal. Because of these positive qualities, I kept waiting for it to get better. The best I can say about the movie is it is a reminder of how some people face their final years. I am sure that those who wrote and directed it think they are providing a slice of realism. I am thankful that this is not my reality nor is it the reality of many who have so much more to live for at every age.",1463875200,,1307,4.404958677685951

Having sincere friends starts in your youth if you can bond then,  ""Can you keep them in your future""?. Most people make friends  in school  then in the workplace but when they move on to a new living location, or a new job  they seldom stay in touch. Those that know how to maintain friendships are truly bless people especially if they can communicate through the thick and thin. Of course now a days texting may be the force that keeps people more in touch today alone with Facebook.

7187086,3,B00XQ2EQH2,"I did in fact very much enjoy this movie, but it was like an unfinished work of art. The story was quite promising, but the artists felt that ambiguity, much as in real life, was the better part of this screenwriters vision. It was not bad, but it felt unfulfilling in the end. I want to add that the acting on everyone's part was superb, and if not for the ambiguous ending, it might have been a minor classic. It is rare that I have felt that a movie felt so ""real"" in many ways, capturing young and old, wisdom and folly, hopes and despair, all so very well. Kudos to Ms. Danner for taking on the role and performing so well. For me, the many details missing in the lives and motivations of these respective characters could be forgiven to a degree, but to not tie things up in a more revealing and meaningful way at the end was kind of a lost opportunity. Most people will not enjoy this movie, but I did feel it had it's shining and humorous moments. The older ladies getting ""high"" was pretty funny, as well as listening to Mr. Starr's character sing ""I think we're alone now"" at Karaoke night. Oh God, that was just plain awful, just like in real life. You definitely could watch worse movies.",1463184000,,1200,4.314159292035399

7187088,2,B00XQ2EQH2,"slow, depressing and not worth an hour and a half of your time.  The movie focuses on loss, and the inability to replace serious losses.  As the title suggests, only in your dreams do things improve.  The scene with four seniors getting high looks like something out of a movie aimed at teens, and adds comic relief, but is not credible, and adds little to the plot line.

Or maybe when Carols friend came over and thought she was sleeping with the young pool guy. Ok maybe the movie as a hole. You are just going to have to watch it. Great acting, Great story.

I'm not a fan of movies that...just end.  Blythe, Martin & Sam did a wonderful job allowing you to become attached to their characters in such a short amount of time.  The writing isn't always enough, you need great actors to pull it off.  An eye opener on how to look at life and remember that most of us are running the ""rat race"" and don't take the time to live life to the fullest, until it's too late.  I couldn't imagine living my life without my husband.

Blythe Danner is both stunning and heartbreaking in the portrayal of a realistic older widow who yearns for companionship and love.  My daughter who is only 25 years old and I (58 years old) fell in love with this movie because it is touching, sweet, sad, heartbreaking and hopeful.  Ms. Danner deserved to be nominated for and should have won an Academy Award for her breathtaking performance in this role! She is so realistic at conveying a deep, emotional sense of longing and loneliness. Sam Elliot is so charming and affable as Bill. They are so adorable and sexy together - a real chemistry rarely seen on screen these days.  I'l See You In My Dreams is a gem that is not to be missed! If you want car chases, continuous violence & mindless stupid sex jokes than this is not for you. However, if you wish to experience an emotionally satisfying journey of love, friendship, joy and sadness - this is the movie for you. It is the Best Movie we have seen in years!

I am not going to give anything away here, so I just wanna say that if you are a young person - say under 40 - you will find this movie quite boring - otherwise check it out! It has some of my favorite actresses in it (besides Blythe Danner - Mary Kay Place from Mary Hartman - Mary Hartman and Rhea Perlman from Taxi (among others!) and then there is the new love interest - oh geez I cant think of his name - but many years ago (before that white hair) he played The Lifeguard!

7187519,4,B00XQ2EQH2,"A quiet movie. I thought it rather accurately showed how different people deal with changes and possible loneliness in their senior years. Companions and spouses die, you scale down, you question the meaning of life, you establish different social circles and routines and choose ways to keep on going. The main character and her friends each had different outlooks and approaches. Blythe Danner's character is proud and reserved and does not want to become ridiculous; others who are easier on themselves seem to have quicker access to joy. But it makes the case that proud is okay too. I was thrilled to see Mary Kay Place and Rhea Perlman again; both delightful.",1462492800,,665,4.946428571428571

However, while she is always appealing and carries the movie well few other things about this film are notable.  They have picked a funny time frame, 20 years after her husband's death, on which to focus. Danner's character, Carol, is so attractive, smart and cool, it made me wonder why she leads such a lonely existence?  Flimsy characters come in and out of her life, she has a glass of wine with them, and that's pretty much it. I say ""flimsy"" because none of the relationship are developed, be it her daughter or card-playing girlfriends...a waste of three other fine actresses (Rhea Perlman, Mary Kay Place, and the June Squibb). The men she meets get a bit more fleshing out, but just a bit. I found it very unsatisfying.",1462492800,,808,4.683098591549296

Did she and her 3 ""interesting"" female friends really need to experience medical marijuana?  Too many scenes of alcohol consumption.  And after she gave herself away to a ""sexy"" guy, wasn't it nice that he said ""I really like you.""  Then within a few days, he died and her educated remark was, ""What made his body say, 'I'm done!'""  Wouldn't recommend it unless that's what you get out of life, too.

It takes the viewer on a meaningful ride with many interesting twists and turns along the way.  Blythe Danner is spectacular.  The only unrealistic part is to have someone as beautiful and personable as her not date anyone in two decades and then for her to suddenly be so open to dating someone and be so remarkably at ease with it.  The movie ends a bit unfinished, but I suppose most good movies do.  You will enjoy this story so much that it will make you want to go out and make a new friend.",1461801600,,653,4.347107438016529

But it was worth it to see that old Sam Elliot charm... Will it ever stop? I prefer light-hearted, but this was more like my life... and reality...  I used to see a tatoo on the arms of some very sad looking individuals that read, ""Life's a bitch... And then you die."" That could easily be the tagline for this movie.",1460592000,,454,4.341176470588235
7188768,2,B00XQ2EQH2,"This is a very depressing movie. I love Sam Elliott and I like Blythe Danner, so I thought I would enjoy this movie. However, the plot and the characters were undeveloped. The director didn't allow you to care about these people or about what was happening. As another reviewer said, it started out depressing and ended depressing. But I would add, it was depressing just because the plot was sad, it was depressing because I just couldn't care about the lead character. The cast and the plot idea had great potential, it just missed the mark",1460505600,,542,4.65625
7188769,3,B00XQ2EQH2,"Retired woman has a very quiet routine ho-hum life with her dog and weekly card game friends. One day the dog dies and turns her life upside down. She doesn't know what to do with herself. She is lonely. Things are not routine. But she is older with most of her years behind her. She reacts.

I would have given this 4 stars but of course the latest Hollywood push is drugs. So of course they have to have a casual drug scene in this movie to ""teach"" us it is all ""OK"". You know funny . . . games. ""No big deal"". Drugs and alcohol are never OK.

Anyway, this movie reminds me of ""Enough Said"". It is filmed in LA. It shows perfect little houses with quiet streets. All white people just living plain simple lives which is a contrast to the chandelier swinging, partying you see in most LA-base movies. Anyway I guess the movie is about nothing but life. I really didn't see anything special in it which makes it special I guess. After overdosing on explosions, spy/espionage, grandeur/opulence, etc simple is good I guess. I don't know if I would call this normal. But I guess it is normal to some. Perhaps it was about getting old and adjusting. But not really. Perhaps it is about being lonely. But not really. So you see my point? It was simply about life I guess. Grass is always greener. She has nothing to worry about. No problems. Has everything. Peace. Beautiful home. Nice car, clothes, health. But still has problems. Dunno. That is what I saw in this. Made it worthwhile, over all.

However you gotta love what a moral train wreck these characters are. ""I barely even know you"" as she lays in bed after having sex with the guy. LOL. Then why would you think to have sex with the person? The most intimate thing you can share with someone? Exchanging DNA? LOL What wacko morality American cinema/urban lives show.",1460419200,,1823,4.435820895522388
7188770,5,B00XQ2EQH2,"Heartwarming and a tearjerker. I cried three times. But I wouldn't call it depressing. Just very real. Love, and loss, and connections. Gentle and sophisticated. Something I plan to talk to my girlfriends about tomorrow at the Senior Center, in the Crafter's Corner. I will recommend this show to them. I'm 52, and I say it was a nice ride, a nice drama. A show worth watching, unlike so much that comes out of Hollywood these days.",1460332800,,432,4.623376623376624

7188792,1,B00XQ2EQH2,"I'm not sure I saw the same movie as other reviewers. Yes, Blythe Danner was amazing. She's a magnificent actress. The cast is stellar. But if you're looking for an uplifting movie about becoming engaged in life again after a certain age, this is not it. It is depressing right from the beginning. About 20 minutes in my husband asked me if I thought it was going to pick up. I told him about the great reviews so he was looking forward to it as much as I was.  It shows promise when Sam Elliott enters the picture, but that part of the story turns into a cruel twist of fate. It's not at all the uplifting, life affirming story I thought it would be.",1460246400,,651,4.208

7188821,2,B00XQ2EQH2,"This is a movie about a group of women in their 60's and 70's with Blythe DAnner about the same age. EXCEPT she has obviously had a face lift , so instead of looking  the age she is in real life and is supposed to be in the film, she looks 50 ..... why oh why do American actresses want to play older roles with reworked faces. European actresses look the age they are supposed to be in their films. Furthermore she plays the role like an ingenue, with this cutesy fey attitude, better suited to a 20-ish young woman.

And there is no chemistry whatssoever with the love interest...it looked like each of them were kissing cardboard. THEN, after one or fwo dates, SPOILER ALERT, th e y sleep together once and then he dies.  Outside of this being a dumb plot, she grieves as if they had a long term relationship.

Then there is the young pool guy, a real dolt and it appears that no one knew how to continue that plot line, so they leave it hanging.

And finally there is a dog named Hazel that everyone refers to as he or him.",1459641600,5,1027,4.192893401015229

It is intriguing to see what it can be like after one loses a spouse or when someone is finally ready to make a commitment.  The relationships we have we our children when we get older and the same from an adult childs point of view.  We see that life isn't always easy but we do keep going.  We accept what we can't control.  Would I watch this movie again?  Yes, I probably would.  I enjoyed watching the relationships among peers.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: Carol Peterson [Blythe Danner] has been widowed for 20 years, having lost her husband in a plane crash in 1994. Shes raised a daughter [Malin Akerman] along, and now shes lost the only surviving piece of her old life, her dog Hazel. One would think that deep loneliness and sadness would be the most common reaction, but her own lack of sadness disturbs even Carol Peterson. She has her friends Georgina [June Squibb], Sally [Rhea Perlman] and Rona [Mary Kay Place], but there just doesnt seem to be much zest in her dealings with them anymore. Carol Peterson goes through the motions, but the heart just isn't there. Realising that something is missing from her life, Carol Peterson begins an unintended reimagining of her life.

Forming a friendship with the local pool boy Lloyd [Martin Starr], she gains a little bit of her old life back. Going out on platonic dates to the local karaoke bar, the two gain some much needed comfort and perspective from the other. Lloyd is frustrated and young, thinking there is nothing ahead of him in life due to the limited experience that he has had so far. Trying to live in the now, he cant seem to find any happiness, except in the friendship with Carol Peterson. Carol Peterson, on the other hand, has lived a lot, seen a lot, and just cant seem to reconcile the fact that there is anything left in life for her to enjoy. Meeting her polar opposite in the form of Bill [Sam Elliot], a retiree with a lust for life, Carol Peterson soon finds out that there is so much more in life, even with the limited time span she has left. Bill is vivacious, full of life and has no desire to waste what time he has left on this earth. Forming a whirlwind romance with Carol Peterson, he teaches the retired school teacher/singer that its not the amount of time you have left that counts, its all about what you make of that time.

I really enjoyed ILL SEE YOU IN MY DREAMS as it resonated with me in a very personal way. Ive watched family members live the rest of their aging lives in a sense of despondency and futility. Thinking that their looming mortality means that there is nothing left for them. They see what they have LOST over the course of the years instead of all things that life has to offer. Carol Peterson fits that mould to a T at the beginning of the film. Carol Peterson sees her lost husband, her lost dog, her lost youth, and that depressing weight keeps her from enjoying what time she has on earth. This alone becomes too much and her spur of the moment friendship with Lloyd sets off a chain reaction that will change her life for the better.

Both the characters of Bill and Lloyd are charming and poignant, each unlocking a piece of her that the other couldnt. I loved the chemistry that went on between Bill and Carol, as Sam Elliot is enough reason to watch any movie. I don't care, but if Sam Elliot winks at you and asks you out on a date, then you GO! While Bill and Carol Peterson were solid, the really enjoyable relationship was between her and Lloyd. I full expected this to be a love triangle with Lloyd falling for the much older woman, but Brett Haley kept the relationship platonic, allowing for the two broken people to heal each other without the unnecessary trappings of a forced romance of the age gap. Lloyd offers her a sort of youthful freedom, while Carol Peterson can impart her own wisdom of trial and error, with both characters drawing support from the other in their own seemingly stalled life.

The film is a slow burner, with a nice steady progression for Carol Peterson, but the only real flaw that I can take away from this viewing that I did not want the film to end; it was that fantastic tour-de-force. It almost seemed as if the director didn't really know how to tie up the ending of the film, and instead he just let it coast on until the end credits. Because we wanted to know of Bills fate, as well as Lloyds change in jobs seemed and what his future held for him, especially with is relationship with Carol towards 15 minutes at the end of the film, rather than the actual ending, which left me feeling like there was just something waiting around the corner. Its not a deal breaker by any stretch of the imagination, but the great crescendo never happens, which is ever so slightly disappointing. But what I did like is the songs that were used in the film and they were: Ones Who Love You; Walking on a Dream; Trampoline; I Think We're Alone Now; Shotgun; Cry Me a River; Groovin'; Don't Go to Strangers; Let's Be Still and I'll See You in My Dreams. But what really moved me to tears is when Carol Petersen [Blythe Danner] sings karaoke in the bar live to the song Cry Me a River, and it is one of the most emotional thing I have seen in a film, especially as Blythe Danner sings it live and also moved the patrons in the bar and I would of liked to of seen Blythe Danner sing another song live.

Blu-ray Video Quality  Its become a strong pattern recently that most modern films look good to amazing on this 1080p encoded image Blu-ray, as well as a very nice 1.85:1 aspect ratio. ILL SEE YOU IN MY DREAMS has very exceptional detail, strong contrast levels and some amazing colour levels. The fine detail is never in doubt, with every fibre and wrinkle on the aging actors bodies and clothing are always visible, and the while the contrast is pushed to the high end of the spectrum, it never washes out the blacks TOO much. With that being said, I did notice a couple of times where said contrast gave the blacks a slightly washed out hue, but those were mostly at the beginning of the film, while the rest of the film sports deep and inky blacks. Colours are warm and natural, with cheery blues, greens and pastels to fill out the image with a good feel to the film.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  The 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio track on board sports great fidelity from the centre channel, which carries most of the weight, and features a good balance with the rest of the track but you know what to expect from your average drama in the audio department. The music adds the most activity to the surrounds, and listening to Carol Petersen [Blythe Danner] sings Cry Me a River is worth the price of admission alone. Theres a decent amount of ambient activity to keep the surrounds in use the whole film, but the majority of the work is really handled by the centre with some support by the mains mild, but perfectly acceptable for the genre, and even adds some low end weight thats quite noticeable, especially with the cop car pulling them over, or the trip out on the ocean in Bills boat.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Special Feature: A Look Inside I'll See You in My Dreams [2015] [1080p] [1.85:1] [3:27] Here we get with this extra is a short type of promotional reel with interviews with the cast and crew, discussing their characters and the film's central themes and those contributors included Blythe Danner [Carol Petersen]; Rhea Perlman [Sally]; Brett Haley [Writer/Director]; Sam Elliott [Bill]; June Squibb [Georgina]; Mary Kay Place [Rona] and Malin Akerman [Katherine Petersen]. It was really nice to hear all their views of the actors talking about their characters in the film and especially about being old and their outlook on life. I just wish there had been more to this, considering the truly amazing cast. As a bonus you get lots of clips from the film.

Theatrical Trailers: We get to view two Original Theatrical Trailers at the start of the Blu-ray and they are as follows: Pawn Sacrifice [2015] [1080p] [2.20:1] [2:30]. Danny Collins [2015] [1080p] [2.20:1] [3:02].

Finally, ILL SEE YOU IN MY DREAMS is a beautiful, rich film, which is also a very sweet and endearing film with a purpose and a confident know-how in its approach to complicated and emotional material and one that pulls at the heartstrings and delivers some good laughs. The characters are all amazing and it's so much fun to go on their journey with them, leaving you wanting to spend more time with each and every one of them. There are no action sequences here or big explosions, but this film proves you don't need any of that to have an excellent film that is as simple as having a conversation with friends and the ones you love. The video and audio presentations are both top notch, however the one extra lacks substance, but video and audio qualities satisfy greatly and I didn't want the film to end, it is that brilliant. Highly Recommended!

7190266,4,B00XQ2EQH2,"This was a very relatable movie.  I am probably close to the age that Blythe Danner's character is suppose to be.  Although the circumstances of her life are very different than mine, I can still relate to her character.  As you grow older you begin to question your life and the choices you made, the ""what ifs.""  But what I really liked about this movie is that she is not a victim of circumstances.  She takes what life gives her and makes the best of it.  She is a strong woman that keeps on going despite losses and sadness.  She creates her own happiness without any apologies. She is a strong, everyday woman.  Every woman can be her.",1457308800,,641,4.372881355932203

7190303,5,B00XQ2EQH2,"I don't know why it took so long for Hollywood to give the wonderful Blythe Danner the lead role in a movie. As she has always been, she is magical in this role. The film is fairly slow going, so if you get impatient waiting for some shoot-'em-up excitement, this is not the story for you. Instead it reflects what many people face as they reach their ""senior"" years: change of status, loss of loved ones and friends, free time, lack of direction, and unexpected and sometimes awkward new relationships. Incidentally, I kept waiting for the old song, but there's a new one with the same title.",1457222400,,593,4.5514018691588785

Again, no real response. Her husband was also brought up a few times, but then that story line was left on the floor, so to speak.

You'd think the women in this movie were 100 years plus, instead of their 60's. Danner's character is vibrant, healthy, compassionate and attractive. , yet she sits around playing cards with her friends, but not dong much else.  Right from the start, this entire movie is so directed towards age, as if;  it's a bad, depressing, fearful thing and nothing else. There's no balance in this movie  Her life was one sad event after the next.  Way too one dimensional. I was turned off.  I'd tell her....get a job. create a job. go to school, find a challenge, travel, learn something new;  instead of sitting around playing cards and talking about what was.....when you're still healthy and strong. Yet you sit there, because the numbers read 60 and ""somebody"" told you that means you're old.  Sitting in the past is what makes you old and eventually sick and tired.  Then you become old.  I skipped right through it.  If you like Danner and Pearlman, you may want to watch. They are good actors, but again the storyline and characters are not developed.  So, it's a bad movie from that standpoint, too..

7190432,4,B00XQ2EQH2,This is an interesting film about a widowed middle aged woman who doesn't realize how lonely she is after losing her husband. She tries not to think about it by spending time with her female friends. She meets a young man who has taken the place of her regular pool guy and the two form a friendship although I feel the young man wants more after talking with her and discovering they have music in common. She doesn't indulge him though and then meets a older man played by Sam Elliott which is why I wanted to watch the film because I am a big fan. Sam pursues her and they spend the night together after a couple of dates but then he starts discussing marriage and she finds that he has awakened something in her that hasn't happened in a long time.

I liked it and I barely tolerate Blythe Danner (because she produced & raised a doofus...) but she's very elegant and she's a good actress, so I'm happy that i chose it.

7190988,4,B00XQ2EQH2,"This isn't an ""up"" movie, but rather a closer to life movie, the issues of growing older portrayed deeply by Gwenyth Paltrow;s mother, Blythe Danner (you can't help but compare the two, Blythe Danner reflecting back on her days when she was Gwenyth's age).  Sam Elliott still looks good, and still plays the cool dude, using and enjoying his retirement money on a boat just ""to get away from the noise"" while he camps out now and then on the ocean.  No home or big savings account compounding for him.  Blythe Danner is independent, like Elliott, and wants nothing to do with a care facility either, despite many of her friends being there (she plays cards with them).  Her family is distant, her husband gone long ago, and about the only thing growing faster than her stubbornness is her loneliness.  But this somewhat plodding movie, much too slow for a younger audience, will hit a few truths with an older audience.  As friends and family fade away, will love ever return?  One hopes so...but sometimes it is only a dream.",1455667200,,1026,4.666666666666667

7190999,3,B00XQ2EQH2,"I love both Blythe Danner and Sam Elliott, but I just could not feel for these characters the way I would have liked to. As I sat and watched, it occurred to me that the real subject of this story is mortality and time. A character study of random people who are towards the end of their lives and who know that the end is in sight. The issue I had with this film is that the writers and directors never really gave us enough to go on. Who were these girlfriends? How long had they been meeting for cards and wine? Does Carol even have a relationship with her daughter? Why a poker-faced hipster poolman?

And spoiler alert... the only character we're willing to connect to and feel for, Bill, dies. Unexpectedly, with no warning. I cannot believe that she did not say she was a fiancee or whatever was needed to see this man one last time. But all in all, that is how I felt about the entire Carol character - who is this strange woman who lacks depth, common sense. Has she lived alone so long that she's forgotten that deep connection is what is needed for relationships?

I suppose that when most of your life is behind you, what does having everything (or ANYTHING for that matter) really mean? That must be the proposed question in this slow moving look into a lonely woman's uneventful life... I watched wanting to love this woman, and I left the film feeling sad and sorry for her lonely existence.",1455667200,,1406,4.383141762452107

I enjoyed the basic plot, however, I kept waiting for more....more back story about their lives.  It also could have used a little more comedy with the 'girlfriends'.  I also was hoping for more time in the relationship with Danner and Elliot.  It seemed just a 'surface' film....barely skimming the top.  I believe the talents of Danner, Elliot, Rhea Pearlman and the others were wasted.  All of these actors have so much more to give.  When I see a film with these wonderful actors I'm hoping for more than, 'I needed the money.'  Because that's what it felt like to me, they all needed the money.
If you have an hour or so to kill while waiting for a flight or waiting in the doctors' office, it may be ok, but definitely don't invite girlfriends over hoping to get good dose of Sam Elliot!",1454284800,,878,4.44375

He really aged gracefully, still so handsome.  Without giving too much of the movie away I was not at all happy with the story. I wanted to see more of him.  Maybe he will make another movie.  But, from what I saw, I did like the movie (especially him) and her 'girlfriends' were too funny, just loved them all, especially when they wheeled that shopping cart full of munchies home and got stopped by that cop!!!

7191727,3,B00XQ2EQH2,"Well, I'm not sure!  My first criteria in a critique is whether I watched it to the end.  I did, so number one out of the way.

Characterization - good.  Scenery - good, especially if you include Danner and Elliott in the scenery category.  They are both aging very, very well, as is Mary Kae Place.  Nice job on the makeup in that Danner brightens considerably after Elliott comes into the scenario.  In fact, no argument about any of the casting.  They are excellent.  (And let''s face it, listening to Sam Elliott's voice is always worth the price of admission.)  So far, so good.  I feel a bit snarky in saying the plot is a little light, but that's the way I felt.  (Still, I watched it to the end, so I can't be too critical on that.  I did want to know what happened.)

Another criteria for me is whether I would watch a movie again.  It was definitely worth the first viewing, but I don't think I would watch it again or buy it.  .",1454198400,,939,4.220338983050848

7191768,4,B00XQ2EQH2,"Reality TV seems to have inured us to what I call 'the stare'.  Just folks staring, pseudo-meaningfully, into the camera or at each other.  I don't get it.  What is that supposed to mean?  kardashians do it, rachel zoe does it, Investigation Discovery actors do it nonstop...to name just a few!! Ok, yeah Blythe Danner is an A-lister, not one of 'those people'.  & Ergo ipso facto, her 'stares' in this movie are automatically translated into a 'nuanced performance'.  (As are her loooooow energy, one-to-two word responses to the Sam Elliot character--interaction which could have been more lively.) Ok I get it, she's being subtle, and subtly transformed by the events & people around her... But again, when does 'nuance' turn into 'catatonia'?! (a word I just kind of made up there...kind of like ""Alphonse"".  ok, that part in the movie was funny. I admit).  I dunno, maybe it's just me.  But I would have rather seen more of the animated Rhea Pearlman character, than the slo-mo introspection/nuanced responses/thinkum moments of Carol. (To be fair, pool boy had his share of sad, freighted stares as well...)  Honestly, if Carol were in the 'real world', someone would probably gently suggest, that she maybe might want to, you know, perhaps go ahead & perhaps get checked out, by a doctor, perhaps screened, just as a precaution, for maybe early onset of....the A word.  yeah, her actions skewed a tad in that direction, for me anyway...I don't want to offend anyone. (plus her hairstyle just didn't do her justice as a chic 'older' woman-- who in the heck was styling Danner for this part?!?)  Anyway - I just think there was so much wasted potential here--because there was also so much that resonated with me, as a very-similar-in-age/demographic/socioeconomic standing/etc to Carol, that I would have liked to have seen more done with the character.  I mean at a minimum, more of her talent re-awakened...  Geeze just one song?  Cry me a river.",1454112000,,1954,4.896656534954407

I kept wanting to see more of her character because she was one of the liveliest. Danner is beautiful, but her character in this movie was little too melancholy.

Blythe Danner is a pleasure to watch, especially in the company of Sam Elliot. She is content to allow human connection to exist on its own on screen without having to telegraph anything to the viewer. The film is built on basic kindnesses shared easily, and without guile, expressed in everyday interactions between the barely acquainted, who become unexpected friends. There is an unselfconscious ease in the relational landscape of the film which comes as a relief in a plethora of hit-you-over-the-head media. ""...in My Dreams"" breathes and lets humanity rise to the surface. The movie takes a hard left that I never saw coming, which, in retrospect, is a pivotal moment that reverberates emotionally long after the credits have rolled.",1453766400,,971,4.890909090909091

7191938,5,B00XQ2EQH2,"I had no expectations for this.  It is a quiet, thoughtful, and truthful little film that deals with some sad, some tragic, some very funny realities of being an 'older' woman.  Husbands are gone (to younger women, to the grave, to an inevitable recognition of difference), children are grown and away, friends are dying off, and each day has its minor joys and tragedies.  That sounds awful, I know, but the actresses here bring a reality to living in a 'senior housing center, the need to maintain constant activity in a pretense of youth, and the dignity of being alone while structuring a life of quiet dignity.  This latter is, of course, disrupted by re-emerging love...and the film ends with very happy but unromantic love.  I'm 'that' age, and thought it excellent.",1453593600,,773,4.825757575757576

I found the editing from scene to scene to NOT flow at times. The scenes with Carol (Blythe Danner's) female friends were good. The relationship with Carol's daughter leaves questions so could have been better developed, and the relationship with Bill (Sam Elliott) also left unanswered questions. He is suddenly in the hospital and dies. WHAT? So I was very disappointed in the ending. Should have been Carol and Bob adopting the dog. This is one of the movies that needed at least one alternate ending if you don't like the original one.

It deals with the reality senior women (and men for that matter) face in losing spouses, pets, friends, etc. in their golden years.  And it speaks to the courage of picking yourself up and trying again.  I like very much that it ended with a positive outlook - as long as you can breath, you can move on.  The story was more about a widow and her group of friends than it was about men and I felt that it depicted older men mostly in unattractive stereotypes.  Thus not five stars.  Also I wish there had been just a tad bit more character development of the main characters.  But mostly I really liked this movie.",1453593600,,679,4.299212598425197

7192001,4,B00XQ2EQH2,"This is a well done movie with an entertaining story line about people in their twilight years, except for the sad portion of the movie later on that threw me off since I expected a pleasant story, not a tearjerker. Sam Elliot is great, as usual, as the rugged, soft-spoken, handsome, white haired, 70 year old Southern gentleman, who's in terrific shape for his age, and who I've always liked since his '76 movie ""Lifeguard,"" plus he's been in many Westerns as the good guy. Blythe Danner as his widowed girlfriend is excellent along with Rhea Perlman, who was Carla in  '82 in the TV series Taxi, Mary Kay Place, who I haven't seen since her appearance in ""The BIg Chill"" movie back in '83 and everyone else in the movie. It was also good to see the now bald Max Gail in the flick also, who played Detective Wojciehowicz, or Wojo, in the 70's TV series Barney Miller, when he had all of his hair. All in all this was a very good movie only hampered by the sad ending.",1453507200,,969,4.3535911602209945

7192045,1,B00XQ2EQH2,Terrible movie. Turned it off after five minutes. Starts off with detailed scenes about Ms. Danner's character having her dog put to sleep. Gross!!! I watch movies to try forget sad things.,1453507200,,189,4.9375
7192046,3,B00XQ2EQH2,"It was nice to see a film about older women but as per Hollywood they were all pretty well off.

The dialogue was good and Sam Elliot's role was good as was the actor's who played Lloyd.

Few surprises in the film but Blythe Danner was great.",1453507200,,242,4.127659574468085

7192048,3,B00XQ2EQH2,"Despite good acting, a mediocre plot and truly depressing story was a real downer. I'm not sure that I saw the point of the story.  The lead female character lost her beloved husband 20 years previously. Not entirely credible that she has not dated since even though she was youthful and beautiful. Makes me REALLY want to avoid moving I to a retirement community!  There has to be more to life than this.",1453507200,,405,4.534246575342466

7192055,2,B00XQ2EQH2,"It got the extra star cause I love Sam Elliott, but even he couldn't save this flick.  This is one of the weirdest movies I have ever seen.  The plot started out sad and never got much better.  To believe the writer and director, getting older just plain sucks!  Why would anyone want to film a movie about one miserable week?  Don't waste your time.  Sam Elliott lovers, he isn't in the movie long enough to struggle thru the whole,ovine for. ",1453507200,,444,4.407407407407407

It's not even clear how many times.  Widow seems to have no many interests other than unenthusiastic golf, bridge (?) w friends. They do have sex (as a Gynecologist, and same sex, social class (almost), very unlikely w/o visiting your doctor for menopausal vaginal dryness, safety, etc.). The other man in the movie is the college educated pool guy (this one character more endearing, they have more in common, he's more useful). Alcohol overrepresented. Cannot say more w/o a spoiler.

I had read a decent review of this movie but the spoiler they mentioned made me wonder how it would be. Well, life throws most people lots of curve balls by the time we reach 60 or so years and are thinking of retirement and life and the aging process. I thought the story was believable and down to earth, I like that. The characters were all well played and brought a lighter, love of life feeling to the film; what happened made me think more deeply on the subjects I mentioned.

Carol (Danner's character) has been widowed for twenty years and has had no love interest during that time. Her daughter lives out of state and her primary companion in life is her dog Hazel. She has a small group of women friends and a life that follows some simple routines. Hazel dies. A man comes into her life . . . and leaves it before she has really even had a chance to savor the experience for more than a few days. There are no easy answers here. But then, life as it is truly lived provides no easy answers. As a widow myself and as a woman in her sixties, I found the movie believable, charming, and poignant.",1453075200,,799,4.161290322580645

Love this entire movie the story felt real and the actor really sold it to me.

The beings we allow into our lives that give it meaning both human and canine.  Your kids may think you are too old and self absorbed to be enjoying life, but it is only because they haven't arrived where you are...yet.  If anything, I think the younger generation should take a look in the mirror today because in 20 years they won't understand how they got so old.

I liked that it wasn't about the young, the lost and the needy, but rather about life and how we choose to live it.  It also reminds us that life is precious, life is short and life is ever so fragile.  Enjoy it!  Message received.",1452470400,,825,4.170886075949367

It looked at connection in the later years colored by experience and understanding obtained only by advancing with time. I did love the way the ""older"" women could get away with things because it was unexpected based on stereotype. It's always fun to see the surprise when folks realize a stereotype is wrong.  Blythe Danner was wonderful and natural as usual. Gotta say though, it's a lucky woman who's last years are so financially privileged, healthy and attractive to men in her own age group.

ONE detail however, pulled me out of the film: Hazel. The movie establishes the main character's quiet, gentle life with her dog Hazel. We see their close bond. Then during the inevitable scene with the vet, the verbal play by play of euthanizing Hazel, the vet refers to the dog as HE. "" I am giving him shot, his heart will stop , his heart has stopped...""  .His? Hazel? Then later in the film, she tells Bill about losing the dog and HIS age.

This is the second movie I've watched since becoming an Amazon Prime member about senior citizens and I found them both very memorable.  I think the writing for this movie was perfect.  It's about ordinary people so they talk like ordinary people do.  Capturing that is good writing.  What this movie also captures is the reality of growing older.  I read once about the usual movies being made today that people go to the movies to see themselves on the screen and they don't.  Well in this movie and the other one I saw about seniors the reality of the senior experience is captured.  I enjoyed seeing it.  Hope to see more movies on Amazon Prime about authentic human experience.,1451779200,3,780,4.586956521739131
7192267,5,B00XQ2EQH2,"I hesitated to rent this movie because of some of the negative reviews criticizing both the writing and storyline. I always enjoy Sam Elliot, and like Blythe Danner also, so I took a chance; I'm glad I did. Some people commented about how depressing this movie was, but I didn't see it that way at all. Did the main character suffer loss? Of course. Getting older and coming to terms with your mortality is very challenging. The movie reflected those challenges, and that's what I loved about it. I also loved that it wasn't trashy, and didn't attempt to be slick or edgy. In the end, like al of us, Carol has the choice to perpetually say ""Why me?"", and endlessly focus on self-pity and loss. Or, she can decide to skip the destructive drama, and just get on with things. The simple ending reflects her choice perfectly. In the end, for me, the moral of the story is one that I never tire of: play the hand you've been dealt, and roll with the punches.",1451779200,3,953,4.420454545454546
7192268,4,B00XQ2EQH2,"A sweet, uplifting film.",1451692800,,24,5.25
7192269,4,B00XQ2EQH2,"Had this movie been more successful financially, I suspect you would be hearing more about Blythe Danners remarkable performance.  She plays Carol Petersen, a widow for 20 years who still endures aching memories.  She hasn't dated since and her social life seems to consist of playing bridge with her 3 best friends.  Georgina (June Squibb), Sally (Rhea Perlman) and Rona (Mary Kay Place) all single but live in the same 55 and over housing complex.  They have been trying to get Carol to move there to but she wants to hold on to her longtime home.

The film opens with Carol experiencing another sad time as the cycle of life takes another close friend.  Her state of melancholia is lifted when she befriends her pool maintenance man, Lloyd (Martin Starr).  After some awkward moments, they become good friends, even going out for a night at a local Karaoke bar.  And yes, Ms. Danner can carry a tune.  Carols boat gets rocked both literally and figuratively when she meets Bill (Sam Elliot).  And for the record, Im one who believes that all men should want to be Sam Elliot.  And I suspect most women wish the men were too.  The guy just makes a movie.

The lady friends are very funny, individually and as a group.  Their confrontation with a policeman (Reid Scott from TVs Veep) after a night of pot smoking is hilarious.  While the film has plenty of humor, the film carries a message that aging is inevitable.  Things change both in the way one feels and what is important.  It is an emotional movie, but thanks to director Brett Haleys guidance and Danners performance, it comes across with grace and elegance.  The movie is likely targeted for an older generation, but there is a message for all.  Recommended.",1451692800,,1720,4.673333333333333

The black rat seemed to symbolize ""death""it scurried in sight at the times she experienced loss and fear of loss, even running her out of her own home.  After suffering more loss, she adopts another dog, an aged one at that. Carol overcomes the fear of loss and commits to love and facing the future again.

{{{Spoiler Alert!}}} My only complaint is that the ONE sex scene with Sam Elliott was far too short. We older ladies have fantasies, too! {{End of Spoiler}}

The actresses/actors are all good and I especially like the lead character who wants to expand her group of friends, but is not willing to abandon all caution to do so. She is careful, a tiny bit salty, and vulnerable, all at the same time. I liked the story tease of whether she would begin a romance with her pool man. I had no expectations of this film when I checked it out from the library, but of the five movies I checked out this is by far the one I most enjoyed. The story is modest but the lead character is nuanced. She is nice enough but not overly sweet and cuddly, reflecting more what women are like in real life than you find in most film characterizations. She is still a character but a more realistic character than most. Well done writer and lead actress (actually, all the actors). 3 and 1/2 stars.",1445731200,,1084,4.266990291262136

The movie was just so hard for me to relate to that I just didn't enjoy it as much as I had hoped.  The main character Carol has apparently been widowed for 20 years.  And also stopped working after the death of her husband.  She apparently hasn't had any relationships during this time and all of a sudden is swept off her feet by Bill played by Sam Elliott and after a couple dates has sex with him; yet when he talks about a possible future, she claims she hardly knows him but had sex with him knowing barely more than his name.

I don't mind emotional movies ... but  I found very little content that gave it meaning ... or brought anything up-lifting to an older widowed woman, living alone, facing her own mortality and that of those around her ... without really showing the joy in life ... not even really diving into the joy from younger years ... no hope for joy in older years .... just a lonely movie about facing mortality without any of the meaningful things that long life and health can bring to us even as we age.  I am only 49 ... so I'm not looking at my own mortality and facing a personal emotional connection in that sense that turned me off ... it was just a downer ... left me feeling empty and as if I had wasted my time ... But if you like sad movies about facing mortality in a monotone - numb way ... this could be for you.  In fairness... the acting was very good and it was well made.  There are some humorous  parts that were one liners and short lived ... enough to bump content up to a 3 star ... It just was soooo not for me... but like I said.  Well made, good acting and probably holds truth for many people ... It would have been a good movie - in my very humble opinion - if there would have been something up-lifting ... some lesson ... it did not even try to show how not to live your life .. it did not show how to live your life ... it did not show how to improve your life or think outside the box ... as I write .. I'm not sure why I gave it three stars ... I guess after watching another movie that was a free ""Prime"" movie that had a 4 star rating that really was a 1 star B movie ... this one was a 3 star for me in comparison ... lol... anyway, that is my take ... now I have to find something up-lifting or interesting to get me out of this empty sort of down feeling this movie left me with.  - I just re-edited and had to move it to a 2 star....  just a waste of money and time.  THE TRAILER IS THE BEST PART OF THE MOVIE AND IS MISLEADING",1445040000,4,2134,3.8963133640552994

There was little humor in Blythe's character and, indeed, her choice in the end just left me feeling sad. Very depressing story with no hope.

It starts off with the main character's long time pet dying and as her life begins again after being alone for about 20 years (husband died), she meets Bill. They fall hard for each other but then he suddenly dies. Sorry to give that away but the movie leaves you sad and some what depressed. Great cast! Really didn't understand why they picked the title.

Blythe Danner as the central character, Carol, is luminous and realistic in her role as a beautifully aging woman who is cut off from her own emotions despite having friends and a grown daughter.  Her life is coasting in neutral and she seems unwilling to change the status quo until the intrusion of a rodent into her well-ordered abode shakes her psyche as well as her confidence in her ability to control things.  When handsome stranger Bill (Sam Elliott) enters the scene, she is almost ready for this sort of excitement.  The events that follow are both touching and predictably unpredictable.  This film avoids the easy jokes about aging and manages to have some humor despite the serious events in Carol's life.  A treasure of a film.",1443312000,,842,4.772413793103448

Her dog Hazel, (male dog) is put to sleep for an illness they never go into. She has a semi-romantic attachment with the young poll guy. She sleeps outside because of a rat no one sees except her. Then Mr. Elliot walks into her life and 30 minutes into the romance they kill him off.

Was looking forward to a feel good movie. Definitely not in that category.
It starts off with putting her dog to sleep.
Urn of her deceased husband on the mantle ; followed by her deceased dog remains on the mantle;
followed by her deceased friend's cigar on the mantle.
New man in her life - Sam Elliot- dies unexpectedly.
Interspersed with senior living moments; retirement atmosphere;
keeping busy while waiting for the inevitable.

The movie had some okay moments (good introspection within Carol's character about life and the previous choices she made) and I enjoyed the dynamics between Blythe Danner and Sam Elliot (as short as they were) but  I would have opted for a happier ending. Given their limited time together on screen, you never got the full utilization of the acting ability of these two marvelous actors and where this story COULD have gone. Rhea Perlman, Mary Kay Place and June Squibb do a good job as Blythe's best friends but the story could have been fuller. There are not many late-in-life romance stories out there as it as so I was disappointed in the ending and left feeling sad and empty.  What could have been a hopeful and positive movie for men and women who find romance in their golden years instead seemed to have the undertone of very bitter and pessimistic writers who felt that a happy ending would be too shmultzy.  They must have deemed it necessary to snuff out the last chance at happiness for two people who finally found each other. Haley and Basch must have felt a reality check was in order I guess. When I watch movies believing they're supposed to be entertaining, I don't want to feel depressed and think that the credits are rolling by like obituary notices in the newspaper.  I certainly don't want the last thing I recall to be what everyone is bringing as a dish to the widow's house.  What's wrong with a happy ending for a change?",1441843200,8,1523,4.564102564102564

Yes, it did move a little slow, but I liked that, and not every movie is Terminator. Yes, the dog died, but dogs die, and we could be facing that in the next few years with our own beloved pet. It is called life. Maybe the reviewers that didn't like it are young and don't won't to look at getting old - maybe not. As my mother said, ""old age is not for sissys"".

Could have been a great movie.... talented cast, important message suffering the losses in life we all experience, and living life to the fullest no matter what, etc., even nice music.  However, Hollywood had to incorporate the obligatory marijuana scenes and pretend they are humorous, plus the mandatory bedroom scene to prove older people are still sexually capable/normal. Why? They did the same with It's Complicated and other movies which could have made it on the quality of the main message without incorporating these politically correct but unnecessary scenes.

7192898,3,B00XQ2EQH2,"3.5 stars

A sweet film, but it dragged for me. Blythe Danner plays someone much like herself, in her 70's, husband died, long dog friend dies, plays bridge with 3 friends who live in a retirement commute, plays golf once a week, and talks with the pool man.

She meets a new man, they have a spin and then we'll, see for yourself. Her daughter comes for a visit, some old issues unsolved, I gather. They talk and all seems well. Carol, played by Danner, goes back to talking with the pool man.

This is a sweet film, characters are every day sort of people, but not with any great message, itjust is.

Second, even though the acting was wonderful, the script it self was was not. The story was slow and seemed at times disconnected. If you are considering renting or buying this movie, don't base it on the trailer, you will be disappointed.

On top of that she hasn't worked since he died cause she lives off his life insurance. And she doesn't do any charity work or have any interests but her dog and a group of girl friends who play cards once a week.  Oh and she doesn't return her only daughters call right away even though it's about her visiting in a couple of days.  Another ridiculous scenario.  Only a man would write this kind of movie.  They made her so one dimensional it's like she lived only for her husband and once he was gone she was a shell.  Wow men have egos.  I don't know any women in my life like that and I'm in my 50s. To top it all off, she finally meets an interesting man and that plot line ends as soon as it begins.  They kill the guy off before anything interesting happens (no, the fact that they had sex was not interesting, it was predictable). The way he died was ridiculous as well.  This movie could have been so much more. I'd like a chance to rewrite it. I actually bought it (which I never do) as it wasn't rentable just so I could see it with my elderly parents.
