7938062,5,B00005CBSV,I love this show even now that I am in my early thirties and these DVD's put out by voyager just keep getting better and better.  Now that the price has dropped it's an even better buy but you might consider getting the box set because I believe you will save yourself some money in the long run that way.  But none the less a great show and well made DVD.,1276128000,,356,4.0
7938063,5,B00005CBSV,"I found the extras on this DVD a pleasant surpise, each disk contains alot of extras that any star blazers fan will enjoy. Also, I originally bought series 1 on video tape and the picture quality wasn't that good, but the DVDs look good. So if you are a star blazers fan, check this disk out.",1051660800,,292,4.232142857142857
7938064,5,B00005CBSV,"Star Blazers:  The Quest for Iscandar Part IV, contains episodes 14-17 (out of 26) of the first season of the cult-favorite Americanized Japanese Anime series from the early 1980's.
For the uninitiated, here's a rundown of the plot.  In 2199 Earth was under attack by an ""evil"" alien race called the Gamilons.  The Gamilons bombed earth with ""planet bombs"" which destroyed the planet and emitted high levels of radiation, thus driving mankind into underground cities.  In one Earth year the planet would become uninhabitable.  Queen Starsha of Iscandar offers mankind hope in the form of the Cosmo DNA which would cure all mankind from the radiation sickness.  She sends Earth a message along with powerful technology that will allow mankind to travel to Iscandar to get the Cosmo DNA.  Earth's youngest and brightest come together to form Star Force to travel to Iscandar to fetch the Cosmo DNA.  Their faithful battleship is the Argo, a renovated WWII era navy battleship remade into a Starship.  There is just one minor problem though, Iscandar is 148,000 Light Years away.  No one has ever traveled that far before.  More importantly, the Star Force only has one year to travel there and back for a total of 296,000 Light Years...
The story picks up steam as the Star Force ventures throughout deep space battling unknown menaces as well as the Gamilons.  Perhaps the greatest enemy of all though is the crew's own psychological health.  In addition we also see some powerful character development among our heroes.
Here is a summary of the four episodes included on this DVD:
Episode 14:  The Star Force plays the waiting game as they wait out a galactic storm at the Octopus Star.  Plus, tensions run high among the crew (particularly Wildstar and Venture) as restlessness and homesickness kick in.
Episode 15:  The Star Force is caught between a rock and a hard place as they try to prevent against being sucked into a ""space whirlpool"" and as they try to ward off an attack from General Lysis' space armada.
Episode 16:  IQ-9 and Nova land on the planet Beeland looking for supplies and come up against a race of Bee People, who are being manipulated by the Gamilons.  Plus, IQ-9 shows his ""human"" side to Nova.
Episode 17:  Wildstar steps up to the plate when Capt. Avatar falls ill.  General Volgar summons the power of the Balan Force to combat the Star Force.
Voyager continues to make leaps and bounds with each DVD volume.  This volume by far has the best design in terms of navigation and screen design compared to the previous volumes (particularly the pitiful Part I).  The audio and video quality is also vastly improved from the previous three editions.
Included in the DVD special features:
1. ""An Overview of the Gamilon Empire.""  Beautifully designed and rendered you can explore and learn more about the Gamilon Empire.  The history section provides a great background story including WHY the Gamilons declared war on Earth.  You can also browse through profiles of the Gamilon characters, look at drawings/pictures of their space vessels, weapons, mecha, etc.  In all, this is, in my opinion, the best DVD special feature yet (except for maybe the Yamato clip from Part II).
2. Yet another shameless plug for part 5.
Here's my rundown:
Great:  The Gamilon Empire Overview in the special features section.  Star Blazers itself.
Good:  Improved navigation.
Sad:  The continued shameless plugs.  (Of course, you can't blame though...)
Overall, this is the best installment yet in the series.  The ""Gamilon Empire Overiew"" has a particular treat, almost worth the price of admission alone. The collection of episodes in and of themselves is pure gold.
Summed up, if you were ever a Star Blazers fan, give this (and Parts I, II, III & all the future volumes) a watch.  It's great for a trip down memory lane.  If you've NEVER seen Star Blazers, give it a try.  It's a cult classic from the 80's (along with other Americanized anime greats like Robotech, Voltron, Transor Z, etc).  The animation may look slightly dated, but the storyline still holds its own very well against anything out there today.  Due to limited distribution this show may have slipped by the radar of a lot of people but it caught on like a fire with those who did catch it.  Give it a watch and see what all the rage was about.",993600000,7,4320,4.811397557666214
7938065,5,B00005CBSV,"It has been real nice being able to after 20 years watch a series that I remember getting up early before school to watch.  The animation may not be as good as things that are coming out now, and the story line may be kind of lame, it is still a good story.  It was one of the first anime shown on american tv that actually kept most of the whole series intact, without letting the american cenors at it, which as those of us that watch toonami on cartoon network know about what they do to a series.  I am really looking forward to being able to complete this series, and to hopefully continue on and get the next two series.  Also it would be nice if they released the Japanese version with subtitling on to dvd so I could see how the original series went.",988243200,8,758,4.136054421768708
