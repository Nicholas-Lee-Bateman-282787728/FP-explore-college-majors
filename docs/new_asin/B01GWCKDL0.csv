8763909,4,B01GWCKDL0,"It is time for the East India Trading Company, vigorously trying to stamp out piracy. The nine pirate leaders must unite or disappear. Unfortunately one pirate leader Captain Sparrow, dead and gone, must be retrieved from Davy Jones' Locker.

A positive character that had a lot of potential is Naomie Harris as Calypso, the sea goddess. She get a big buildup and just as she is about to strike she becomes crabby.

This film has too many plots and sub plots. Too many characters and too many sub characters. Too much graphics and too many Johnny Depp's.

Why can't we get on with the story?
And if this is a trilogy then why all the loose ends that never get tired?",1497139200,,666,4.487603305785124
