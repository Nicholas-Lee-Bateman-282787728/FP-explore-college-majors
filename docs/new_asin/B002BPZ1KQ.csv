8361814,1,B002BPZ1KQ,"I have been searching for Muppet Babies for my kids to watch as it was a favorite so I ventured here first. I saw many call these DVDs a bootleg and one person appalled by it being called a bootleg so I researched it and found that there is indeed no actual release of Muppet Babies. One explanation I found was:

""Muppet Babies made extensive use of clips from popular movies and Hollywood shorts as part of the effect on the imagination efforts of each Muppet. Because of problems with royalties and licensing, these clips have kept this show out of syndicated reruns or seasonal DVD releases, and this problem is unlikely to be resolved any time in the foreseeable future.""

Being that Disney owns everything now, there is a chance that they might be able to release eventually! In the meantime you are better off watching these cartoons online.",1448928000,32,848,4.6466666666666665

8361818,1,B002BPZ1KQ,"Please. Do not buy this dvd set. It's a really obvious bootleg. There is no real Muppet Babies set, as they can't get the rights to some of the clips that were used in the show.",1252108800,159,177,3.9444444444444446
8361819,5,B002BPZ1KQ,"This has been a favorite of mine for as long I can remember. It's the muppets like you'd never see them before. As toddlers. They live in a big house with a nursery where all the action takes place at. They use their imagination to explore their own adventures without leaving the nursery. Their guardian is Nanny a middle aged woman who's identified with her large green socks. Her face is never shown through the whole series. Those who like Muppets will love this series. It's an All Age show. And perfect for kids and adult who grew up watching it.  12 episodes in total.
