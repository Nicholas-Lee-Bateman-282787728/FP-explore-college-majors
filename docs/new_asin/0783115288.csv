8180536,5,0783115288,"Filmed on location in Thailand (the home of Muay Thai Boxing), this film has the atmosphere and authenticity that cannot be faked in the studio. The film has the perfect combination of attributes that makes it one of those  rare classics. The skills of Van Damme are trully spectacular to watch.  This film focuses on real telent rather than stupidly expensive Hollywood  sets and effects for the retard. If you ain't seen it, and you appreciate  everything mentioned, then you simply MUST watch it. Trust me; you won't be  dissapointed. Oh, almost forgot, no. 2 is a 1 star film.",960768000,3,580,4.76
