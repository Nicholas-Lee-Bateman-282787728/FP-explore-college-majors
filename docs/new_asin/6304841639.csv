7879761,5,6304841639,"This is absolutely the best National Geographic Video I ever showed my geography classes!  The footage of erupting volcanoes in Virunga National Park is awesome!  Also, the Carl Akeley biographical sketch describing how he founded Virunga National Park to protect the rare and endangered mountain gorillas is a worthy tribute to a great man who tried very hard ot protect his beloved apes.  This is a ""MUST"" for any teacher to show geography, social studies, environmental science classes from middle school through college.  Great video!  They should make it available in DVD.",1329436800,,577,5.228260869565218

7879763,4,6304841639,"First off I would like to say that Fire and Ice by Frazetta and Bakshi is an excellent addition to any fan of the fantasy genre. This area is sorely lacking in any entries.  I liked the movie because of Frazetta's art Which  translates very well onto the animated screen. The only problem with it was  that when characters are running it looks fairly awkward. The fight scenes  are excellent, but the sorcery seems to be lacking in potency. I must say  that this is one of the best examples of animated fantasy. Of course there  aren't many other examples to compare it to. It's too bad they didn't do  any more.",961372800,4,612,4.410714285714286
