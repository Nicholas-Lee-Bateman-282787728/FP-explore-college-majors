8012114,4,B0001GH6SC,"Good documentaries usually do a fine job of dispelling myths, establishing truths and enabling a more sensitive portrayal of their subjects. This documentary does a good job of that, but also, it gets the little things right. You see things like a turtle and a shark fighting, and the turtle winning. Or a shark on the hunt after some prey, only to be eaten itself by a killer whale.

  This documentary also has an excellent section about stingrays, which is probably the most artistic part of the program.

  It can get a little tedious, which is why it gets four stars instead of five.

  Beginning the DVD, you expect the usual spouting of facts, underwater shots and blurbs about ongoing research, but instead, in this DVD, there is always something fresh and unexpected around the corner.",1156550400,10,794,4.779411764705882
