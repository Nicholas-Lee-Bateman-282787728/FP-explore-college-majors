8614919,4,B00FEMNYMK,"'The Mechanic' is an excellent movie (although in my opinion Jason Stratham's recent remakes are even better)., Death Wish 3 is good (lots of violent action) although some of the minor acting is quite lame and Mr. Majestyk is okay (worth watching once or twice but not Mr. Bronson's best effort IMO).  I am glad I was able to get this used vintage collection at such a great price.  I would be disappointed however if I paid a premium price for the collection in new condition.",1497225600,,477,4.534883720930233
