8416970,5,B004648VYI,"My grandson is almost 2 and he really enjoys watching the Shalom Sesame movies! Children learn basic customs, Hebrew numbers and letters from various characters (human and puppets) and also learns from other children. I recommend the Shalom Sesame movies!",1360368000,,255,5.4

We love the content, they are fun and entertaining and she has even learned some new Hebrew words.",1339977600,,247,4.166666666666667
8416972,5,B004648VYI,"We love these DVDs! We had gone to a promotional event at our local Jewish Community Center and saw one episode and loved it. They are perfect for Jews of any denomination. I love that my children are learning about Israel, holidays and Hebrew from the makers of Sesame Street and with the great characters from it! I would recommend for any Jewish family!",1318118400,,356,4.578125
8416973,5,B004648VYI,"Great DVD!  I knew nothing about Shavuot before watching the video and now I know a lot.  I enjoyed watching the characters celebrate Shavuot and learning about how scrolls on mezzuzot are written.

I really appreciated the part where a child used sign-language to read a poem.  It shows children that some children have different abilities than others.  I commend Sesame Street for adding this segment to the show.

I also enjoyed watching the skit about Moses and the Ten Commandments.  It made the kids laugh that watched the show with me.",1306454400,3,542,4.826086956521739
