947577,1,6305005893,I really liked this movie.  I thought it was very funny.  It also had 2 cast members who where later in the 2nd Harry Potter movie.  Tom Felton (a very young Tom) and the guy who played Mr. Weasley.  He was the exterminator.  There was one part that I thought was falling down funny.  I won't say what it was but it had to do with Tom Felton. He must have been about 7 or 8 years old in this movie.  His name was Peagreen Clock.,1073088000,4,428,3.9069767441860463
947578,2,6305005893,"The only way to enjoy this film is if you haven't read the wonderful books by Mary Norton. The characters share the size, but few of the memorable traits of Pod, Homily, and Arrietty, the wonderful family that lives under the kitchen. This adaptation is more of a cross between MOUSE HUNT, HONEY I SHRUNK THE KIDS, and HOME ALONE than anything in THE BORROWERS books. I was very disappointed, and could not get involved in the story. For little kids only, although you should really read them the books and skip the film.",1040688000,37,521,4.553191489361702
947579,4,6305005893,"This movie is a great one for everyone to watch together, as it can interest anyone, from very young kids to adults.
The miniaturization effects didn't seem particularly advanced - I wasn't wowed by any technical advances I saw. But I would say that they were very imaginably used, making for some cute scenes that were refreshing. They were also carefully done, minimizing the ""fakey"" feel and letting you concentrate on the story.
The DVD version has a cool ""making of The Borrowers"" featurette that shows how the special effects were done, which is fun to watch after you've seen the movie.",997660800,12,593,4.823529411764706
947580,5,6305005893,"John Goodman always has a way of making me laugh.  Seeing him abused and tortured by little people is too much!!!  He brilliantly portrays Ocius P. Potter in this adaptation of the classic children's series of books.  Quirky, quaint and tons of fun for the whole family, this should be on everyone's video shelf.",994464000,,312,4.7407407407407405
947581,4,6305005893,"If you want to watch something original but still interesting, watch this  show.  This is the movie of ""The Borrowers"".  If you haven't read  the books yet, go grab them too!  I have known about the Borrowers when I  was a kid after reading ""The Borrowers"" by Mary Norton.  When  ""The Borrowers"" movie was about to be aired, I was really  excited.  It turned out to be really entertaining and funny.  The movie  also has exciting parts where the Borrowers were escaping from human  'beans'.  You would pray with all your heart that they would not be caught.  The movie was not really like the story, I mean the story in print.  The  Borrowers in the movie looked more modern and their dressing was pretty  weird too.  Enjoy if you gonna watch this movie of little people.  Remember  to put yourself in their shoes and you'll enjoy the movie more!",964656000,,846,4.506666666666667

Within the first 30 seconds, I realized it was completely different from the book. Different human characters, Pod and Homily also have a son besides Arrietty, and Arrietty is not very likable.

947863,5,6305005893,I've just watched this movie in the early 1990's. John Goodman was great in this movie. Universal Studios is not my favorite movie company. But I would give them an A+ for this movie. The movie was based on a book by the same name. These little people have a code of conduct. They only take what is needed. The second rule is never be seen. You won't go wrong by purchasing this movie. I intend to watch it many times,1459555200,,417,4.160493827160494

948567,4,6305005893,"This movie is awesome because it's really funny and cool to see the little people living in the house with the big people.
This movie is all about a kid named Pete Lender who is determined to find out why all the stuff in their house keeps disappearing. He eventually finds Arrietty who is a Borrower and she explains what Borrowers do. The Lenders have to move out of their house because a mean man named Ocious Potter wants to build an apartment building in its place. The Borrowers try to go with the Lenders but the kids fall out of the truck and have to travel through the city to find the new house that is by the old church.

Some of the main characters in the movie are Pete Lender, Arrietty Clock, Ocious P. Potter, and Exterminator Jeff. My favorite character is Pete Lender because he really cares about the Borrowers and is really funny. Exterminator Jeff is on Ocious P. Potter's team at first but then wants to help Pete and the Borrowers.
My favorite part in the movie is when Peagreen Clock fell out of the truck and landed in dog poop. I like that part because it was really funny and I think that a lot of people would think that was funny too.  Another part I really like is when Ocious P. Potter got squirt with cheese. The Borrowers pushed the lever to squirt the cheese because he was after them. It worked and the Borrowers got away!

I would recommend this movie for all ages 3 and up because there are a couple of scary parts but not too many and it is a really good movie. Reviewed by Anthony A,  KIDS FIRST! Film Critic",1351468800,,1546,4.284246575342466

In fact, it takes many liberties with the original storyline, and even the characters do not live up to the wonderful characterizations depicted in the books.

Having said that, the movie will appeal to young children who have not had the books read to them nor read the books themselves. My first grader loved the movie and was captivated by the fantasy tale of a family of ""borrowers"", tiny people who live under the floor, staying alive by keeping out of humans' sight, and ""borrowing"" whatever they need from their oblivious human hosts.

The story moves quickly with lots of action scenes depicting the borrowers in peril, and some scenes can be too unsettling for younger viewers like the scene where one of the young ""borrowers"" gets pushed into a machine, presumably to be squished! John Goodman is credibly wicked as the developer who wishes to turn the home where the borrowers reside into an apartment complex. His performance contrasts nicely with the benign borrowers, though I found the mix-match of British and American accents a bit distracting.

It starts out all right, filmed in an amber glow, in a house full of mid-century appliances and kitch, and great sets of life on a miniature scale lived between the walls and out of sight.  Then, just as you are settling in, Hollywood rips out the rug, throws out the book, and reverts to a standard action plot:  Big bad guy steals the house and the good (little) people have to make it right!  Hoo Ya!

Not really.

Even the heroic music, pounding its way through the action, driving the viewer forward lest he fall asleep or try to hold an independent thought, fails the film.  In the end, almost all the movie is out in the big world, with tired old stunts and Hollywood acting as if more will make it better.

It was fun to view how these ""borrowers"" move about, using ordinary household items to propel themselves around a normal-sized house. It's all pretty ingenious.

John Goodman plays a cartoon-like role, a role that is generally funny to watch. The cast has a mixture of American and English actors, with a setting of 1940s Britain.

The humans are being evicted by a greedy bad guy (a lawyer) who wants to make a condominium.  The Borrowers take an interest and help the humans to save their home.

Great fun for everyone!  I highly recommend ""The Borrowers.""",1178668800,3,834,4.7622377622377625

I then reread the books with my daughter [who is now 32 years old] when she was about 12 years old. We wanted to share this DVD of The Borrowers with her son, my 4 year old grandson. That is why I purchased this item. We FORCED ourselves to watch almost half of the DVD, and then we all said, ""Yes, let's shut it off."" And we haven't watched any more of it. This new version is very contrived, with not much connection to the original story! I would like to perhaps buy a copy of the old original version sometime, but this version has soured me for a while on The Borrowers.",1163030400,10,732,4.273381294964029

948898,2,6305005893,"The movie is very loosely based upon a book by Mary Norton about the Clock family, small people (about six inches tall) who live underneath the floorboards of a house, surviving by borrowing things from humans ""beans"". When they are discovered, they are forced to move.

I was very disappointed with this movie. The only way to enjoy this film is if you haven't read the books. The acting was good, if over the top, but that was the kind of acting needed in a film like this, which seemed to be a combination of ""Home Alone"" and ""Mouse Hunt"".  But the direction was very odd. The movie seemed to be set in the 1950's, yet characters in the movie used a remote for the (black and white) TV and a cellular phone. The costuming was also odd. Yes, they had to make do with what they could ""borrow"" to make clothes, but their outfits, and the really odd hairdos, made them look like creatures from another planet. Also, have the cast was British and half was American, which added to the confusion about what world the movie was set in.

On the other hand, the special effects were quite good. The best part of the DVD is the sequence that shows how the special effects were done. It was very interesting, but it used too many clips from the movie and not enough clips of how they did the special affects. There are also interviews with the cast, with the exception of John Goodman.

Little kids will like this movie, but adults should stay away.",1093824000,7,1441,4.406015037593985
948899,4,6305005893,"I just had the opportunity to see the film The Borrowers starring John Goodman as the evil Mr. Potter.  Overall the movie is fun and entertaining and it has been so long since I read the books that I can't be sure the weak points originate in the movie (although I believe they do).
The movie is based upon a series of books by Mary Norton about a race of small people who live in the cracks and walls of the world and are known for borrowing things from humans (or beings).  The story centers around one borrower family who are the last of their kind in an old house.  Their existence is threatened when the evil Mr. Potter sees to kicking out the being inhabitants in order to knock the house down.  There then follows a series of adventures as borrowers and beings alike try to save the house from destruction.
The weak points in the movie concern anachronisms.  For the most part the movie is set decades ago as in the books.  But annoying anachronisms pop up such as a cellular phone and an in-door ice maker.  Considering the vintage of the vehicles on the street these items really stand out.  But despite the anachronisms the movie remains entertaining with some very good performances from Goodman and the rest of the cast.",1088380800,31,1232,4.46875

7880474,3,6305005893,"If you click on see all formats, you'll see Amazon is combining the different versions of movie adaptations of Mary Nortons books on the one product page, combining the ratings and reviews.  This is a review of the 1997 version (although the region 4 DVD I watched was released in 2017) which starred John Goodman as the lawyer villain, with Hugh Laurie as the policeman.

The movie to me was okay, but was obviously fairly budget.  It's obvious the miniature actors aren't sharing space with Goodman, and that one or the other is in front of a low pixelation green screen.  There's not a lot of depth to this plot, basically Goodman is a lawyer who a grandmother had trusted to draw up her will and leave her house to her freeloading kid and their family who are already living there.  But he's claiming she changed her mind and left it to him.  He plans to knock the house down in a couple of days and build an apartment complex in its place, so has served the rightful inheritors an eviction notice (that in movie world is a couple of days to move out).  Unbeknownst to that family, also living for free in grandma's house is a family of miniature red heads, who survive by stealing food and items such as batteries (they justify their theft by calling it borrowing, but you can't exactly return food or flat batteries) from the beans (real sized humans).  The teen red head is starting to get rebellious to the rules she has to live by and by being reckless coincidentally gets herself seen and caught by the bean boy the night before the removal truck arrives.  He wishes her no harm though, and lets her go back to her family where she informs them about the house's soon to be demolition.  The boy plans on taking his new friends with him but this goes wrong resulting in the rebellious teen and her younger brother going back to the house.  There they find Goodman's character gloating and singing to himself about what he has done and learn that he has the old lady's will, that will prove who the rightful owners are and stop the demolition of the house.  They must of course get it back!

The movie okay but nothing special compared to other either shrunk down to miniature size humans, or really tiny human like creature films.  The miniature people in this one drop some considerable distances for them that would be the equivalent of falling from a four or five story balcony. Yet they are not injured at all.  Likewise you'd think they'd freeze quicker in freezers and the like.  I would think also mice, spiders, cockroaches and all kinds of predators would be an issue to, but we just don't see them in the movie.  You also wonder why the villain doesn't just step on them or pick them up and squish them in his hand, rather than going for elaborate 1966 Batman villain type plans where he leaves the room before he sees that they're dead.  As I said the greenscreen backdrops are obvious but the film is also let down by things like a vacuum supposedly powerful enough that they need to hang on to a wastepaper basket, but that doesn't move their clothes towards the sucking vacuum head.  The acting by most characters, especially the miniature ones, is overthetop, therefore unnatural, but that could be the fault of the writers and director, the actors may be performing like that because they were told to.

For such famous books with a ready made audience (so certain cash returns), you'd think they could have invested more money in this thing to make it a better film.",1518825600,,3492,4.539074960127592
