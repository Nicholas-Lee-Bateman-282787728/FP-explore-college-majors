8149779,3,B000JBXXZY,"This is an OK thriller that reminded me of how corrupt and seamy Mexico turned out to be last time I visited. I like Eric Balfour and Alan Tudyk. The production values are up to par. Admittedly it's a break from the blockbuster action genere that's been sucking up all our better actors.

But to go on and on as many of these reviews do about nuanced performances, excellent music, brilliant directing, and stunning cinematography is excessive. While these elements were professionally done as part of a generically entertaining film, I suspect the overstatement is because people will never again get the chance to see something like Bertolucci's 1900 on a Cinerama screen [about 4x the size of Imax] and literally don't know any better.",1459900800,,738,4.904

8149783,5,B000JBXXZY,"Three friends (Eric Balfour and Lauren German from THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE remake, and Colin Hanks from 11:14 and ALONE WITH HER) travel to Mexico to attend a big party. Of course, there's another reason for crossing the border, involving drugs and lots of them! RX is a tragic thriller / cautionary tale. From very early on we get the idea that things won't end well. Lies are told, crimes are committed, and the stakes balloon to enormous proportions for the unfortunate trio. I sat there wanting these folks to make it back to the states, knowing full well that they were probably doomed! RX is up there w/ classics like HARSH TIMES and REQUIEM FOR A DREAM. Watch it...",1280793600,2,676,4.641666666666667

8149785,5,B000JBXXZY,THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE MOVIES! A THRILLER IN SOME PARTS SAD IN ANOTHER OVER ALL IT'S A GOOD MOVIE I WOULD RECOMMEND TO EVERYONE!,1242604800,,132,4.115384615384615
8149786,5,B000JBXXZY,"I first saw this movie on cable. I don't know why I watched it because I'm 76 and hardly concerned with drugs or teens. However, I found the movie excellent and not the usual slam bang drug movie. I was familiar with the main character because he was in Six Feet Under. I also was impressed with him in another movie (the name escapes me now) about a sexual encounter.

Well, back to the ranch....RX somehow got lost in the media shuffle but deserves a much wider audience. I bought this movie after viewing it for the 2nd time for a library I support. This should deter any drug selling wannabes in the teen crowd.

If you have not seen this movie rent it, buy it, TIVO it. The drug them aside...the acting and storyline is very well done.",1207353600,4,740,4.316546762589928
8149787,5,B000JBXXZY,"How is it that ""Rx"", perhaps the best film made on the Us-Mexico Drug Racket's influence upon young people, is so unknown and so underrated? This 2005 film disappeared from the radar upon release, and those of you who discover it will find a smart, amazingly directed thriller that never lets up. For the record, this is very much shot like an indie film, but with the taut feel of one of the Bourne films.

The standout is obviously Eric Balfour. This unsung actor is at his best here, lending the role a subtle believability far surpassing his years. Colin Hanks (Tom Hanks' son) is also in fine form as the cool and deranged ""Johnny"". Special mention should be made of the lovely soundtrack - mixing the best of the Indie Rock and Electronica scene with some of the best Mexican folk music. I wish they'd release the soundtrack!

The movie follows these three friends as they travel to Mexico, and unbeknowest to the girlfriend, the two boys decide to smuggle drugs by swallowing 450 pills a piece. Obviously a bad idea. The rest of the movie shows them dealing with the overdose, and trying to make it safely across the border. I especially liked that there was no happy ending here - that would have been too easy, and what happened was far more realistic.

Full Marks to the Director for working well within an obviously limited budget. Some minus points for unnecessarily obscene dialog, and there is no gratuitous sex or bloodshed either, so thats a plus in my book.

Indie films like this deserve a wider audience, and if you're looking for a tight thriller that has replay value, this is certainly the movie for you. I'd rather buy this than rent this, its that good.

Five Stars.",1197590400,12,1690,4.601328903654485
