8099321,2,B000CNDJP8,"I did this both while pregnant and post partum.  It's a little slow paced and at times boring.  And we all know as a pregnant woman, we like to sneak in a nap where we can and you have opportunities to do that during this video.  Would recommend looking for alternative pregnancy video's.",1321056000,,288,4.39622641509434
8099322,1,B000CNDJP8,"Pregnant women obviously shouldn't do too much strenuous exercise. However, this DVD almost put me to sleep. There is no actual exercise as would be found in a ""regular"" exercise DVD, only her talking incessantly about kegels and how do to the moves. Most of the moves aren't even modified all that much from the regular way the exercises would be done. Luckily, I didn't have to buy this one to figure this out-a friend loaned it to me. Do NOT waste your money; save it for diapers.",1260662400,,483,4.5
8099323,1,B000CNDJP8,"I know you aren't supposed to exercise heavily when pregnant, but this video I wouldn't even consider exercise. It was not at all what I had hoped it to be.",1223424000,,156,4.233333333333333
8099324,2,B000CNDJP8,"I have been doing pilates for about 3 years and felt this video provided ENTIRELY too much instruction and not enough actual excercise.  The instructor was incredibally boring and the video was too slow paced for me.  I am not looking for a major workout or anything, but rather something to relax me but at the same time provide some fitness to help keep my body in shape and ready for L & D.  Also, the beginning of the video provides a rather extensive list of warnings, most disturbing of all... this video was not designed for those who are pregnant!  WHAT?  I thought that was the point!  At least it was only 9.99!  My search will continue!",1185753600,3,647,4.432203389830509
8099325,4,B000CNDJP8,"Before my pregnancy I was a frequent pilates practitioner and believe strongly in the benefits of core strength.  I wanted to know how to modify pilates once pregnant to continue to reap the benefits, and this DVD is pretty good for that.  The instructor is very thorough in explaining the moves.  I have been surprised by how gentle all pregnancy workouts seem to be, including this one, so that was a surprise but apparently not that unique.  The moves shift position frequently from lying to sitting or standing so that is good for the body and baby, although a little bit of a pain to keep arranging everything you'll need (towels and pillows).  This DVD also contains Kegel-style exercises, which is a nice feature.  I do not regularly follow along with this DVD as a workout, but it was good education for someone like me who already had a repertoire of pilates and wants to learn to modify it.",1178582400,,900,4.628930817610063
