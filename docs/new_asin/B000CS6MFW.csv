8443700,4,B000CS6MFW,"I have just recently started the FIRM with the Transfirmer and of all the tapes I recieved with the step I think I like this one the best, even though it's the shortest one.  Quick, to the point, easy to follow and you will sweat a bit, even if you are advanced.  It's one to do if you only have 1/2 hour to spare but want to get in a quick workout!",1135814400,,349,3.8333333333333335
