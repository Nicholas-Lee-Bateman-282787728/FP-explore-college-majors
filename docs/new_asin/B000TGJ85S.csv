8208942,4,B000TGJ85S,"Autumn Moon is a light, offbeat indie-like drama with small doses of humor. It's set in Hong Kong involving a twenty- or thirty-something Japanese man and a 15-year old Chinese girl. The man is an itchy new arrival in Hong Kong, itching to find the best food from local restaurants. While he's out experiencing unproductive moments of fishing, he meets a naive highschooler and they start up an awkward communication as they try to speak in two different languages. At his urging, they begin conversing in English and quickly start teasing each other as if they were old friends. From this point onward, the movie is interspersed with Cantonese, but English is the dominant dialogue. For the filmgoer suspecting that this friendship develops into something more, rest assured. Sex of the ""consenting adults"" type is the only kind depicted. Don't expect much drama or anything fancy from Autumn Moon. Most of the film occurs at a relaxed pace and usually takes place in intimate settings. From time to time the movie drags a bit, but overall, it's a charming picture. Don't let the spiteful ""just plain boring"" 1-star review below discourage you. (3.5 stars)",1510012800,,1157,4.969072164948454
8208943,4,B000TGJ85S,"I saw this movie at the Sundance Film Festival, and still consider it one of the better finds from that year. As another reviewer has written (about the DVD version), nothing much happens in this movie. But if you like a certain kind of foreign film, of the sort like those made by Ozu or Kiarostami, then you'll probably like this movie. It's about the brief intersection of two characters, one worldly and world-weary, lost and casting about for his purpose, and one a young girl just figuring out who she is, having her first crushes on boys, on the verge of emigrating from Hong Kong to Canada. Nothing even remotely romantic ever happens between them, but they manage to become very unlikely friends who bring warmth and kindness to one another during difficult periods in both their lives. It's by no means a typical feel-good film--it's not sentimental in the least. It's a very quiet movie, with a deft touch, but in the end I found it very moving.",1291593600,5,956,4.629411764705883

8208945,1,B000TGJ85S,"Autumn Moon is a Hong Kong 1992 film that is not easily understood, simple with no substance, dragged out, and just plain boring.  This is clearly a film that many will not enjoy, including devoted foreign film buffs.  The viewer cannot attach to the characters, nothing to like or dislike, nothing to feel.

And, I believe viewers may miss the intention of the director, Clara Law.  According to the brochure insert, Clara Law is a storyteller of displacement and transmigration.  The two words relate to the photographer who has come to Hong Kong and meets a 15 year old girl whose family has left for Canada.  They speak English throughout the film and of nothing important; she takes him for a dinner at her home where her aging grandmother lives.

But on the other side, the photographer is looking for food and bargains in Hong Kong, and he also finds sex with an old girlfriend's sister.  There is a sexual act and some nudity.  So, the story goes back and forth, two the young girl and then the girl he has sex with.  So, nothing exciting occurs.

What is interesting is the way this film was shot, all in a pale blue light.  There are no vibrant colors, just images of blue.  Also, the background shots hardly represent the bustling overcrowded Hong Kong.  What you see are wide shots of buildings galore, bluish oddly shaped or unique buildings.

Again, this is a strange and/or boring movie!!  .....Rizzo",1284681600,,1415,4.668016194331984
