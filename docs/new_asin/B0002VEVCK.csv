8033447,4,B0002VEVCK,"The University of Michigan and THE Ohio State University have played 100 games of college football since 1897.  This DVD covers most of it (through the 2002 season; could they not have waited until the 100th game last year?) and while it would seem a daunting task to try to detail the entire rivalry on a game-by-game basis, the highlights of some of the more significant games are given precedent.  There are some obvious oversights, the first coming to mind being the dedication game between the schools at then-new Ohio Stadium in 1922 (won by Michigan) and the Miami-Boston College impersonation carried out by both teams during the 1988 game in Columbus, the only time in 100 games when both sides tallied over 30 points in the same game.  But more obvious are the games that are featured...Michigan Stadium's dedication in 1927, the Snow Bowl in 1950, Woody Hayes ""Hang 50"" games in the '60's, Bo Schembechler's initial game and one of the most amazing upsets ever...Archie Griffin in the '70's, the unheralded Tshimanga Biakabatuka (I hope I spelled that right) shredding the Buckeyes' National Championship contenders for over 313 yards, Charles Woodson's heroics on the way to the 1997 National Championship and Heisman Trophy, and Jim Tressel's restoration of pride (and consecutive wins for the first time since the first years of the Reagan Administration)following Coach Cooper's...well, legacy is probably not the word Buckeyes fans would prefer.

If you have followed the series for an time at all, there is a good chance that a number of your earliest memories will be brought back instantly.  For me that would be the 1970's and Rick ""The Peach"" Leach, still my favorite college football player of all time.  Seeing him interviewed (among others including '60's OSU stud QB Rex Kern, Archie Griffin, and Bo Schembechler) now as a 40-something non-combatant was interesting...somehow I always considered him eternally around the age of 25-27 after graduating and leaving Michigan Stadium behind him for a career in Major League Baseball.  It is obvious even now that the rivalry still holds a special place in his heart, which is the way it should be.  The interviews (splices of which appear in the main program) add a lot to the depth of rivalry

The only glaring disappointment for me is Pat Summerall's narration.  It sounds at times that he may be somewhat inebriated, unfortunate in that he has had a serious problem with the drink for decades.  Keith Jackson would have been the more natural choice for the voiceover, but it's a negligible complaint.

Definitely the perfect gift for your favorite Wolverine or Buckeye...it will add an entirely new level of appreciation for a football series that everyone concerned thinks they know plenty about.",1097020800,25,2771,5.026200873362446
