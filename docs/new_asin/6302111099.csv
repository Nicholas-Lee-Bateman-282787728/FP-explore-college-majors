422616,4,6302111099,"I love seeing George Sanders play someone not only not villainous but not even suave. Here he plays a bright but uninspired nebbish, and he's great at it. Geraldine Fitzgerald is horrible as his jealous sister -- which is just right. And Ella Raines seems much too sophisticated, beautiful and clever to fall for poor Harry -- but this is fantasy, after all. Many may not like the way things turn out, but the play's the thing.",1470700800,,427,4.558441558441558

422697,4,6302111099,"This was a fantastic movie...right up to the last five minutes.  After you see how it ends, you will not be surprised that the producer quit Universal Studios out of disgust.  Do yourself a favor: turn the movie off after one of the lead characters makes a final appearance (you'll know which one).  That is how the movie should have ended.  Instead, they tacked on an abominable ending because test audiences found the proper ending too dark.  What a waste.  Maybe some day they will come out with a ""Producer's Cut"" where that last scene is excised.  We can hope....",1452297600,,568,4.62

422719,2,6302111099,"It was an excellent movie and George Sanders was terrific.  So, why two stars is because it has the worst forced ending I have ever seen.  I couldn't make sense of it.  The ending is worse than the endings of The Bad Seed, Frankenstein by James Whale, and the original Body Snatchers.  These endings were also also forced by the studio but, at least the forced ending fit in with the logic of the story.  It is a 4 star movie until the last minute that destroys the story.  It would had been better had it been done later.  Like what happened with Intimation of Life.  Okay attempt in the 1930's but, the 1950's version shines.

If you want to see or even just hear George Sanders you would be off with Dorian Grey or the Jungle Book.",1433289600,,734,4.260869565217392

422721,4,6302111099,"I would have preferred a different  ending. I  think  they should  have  left  it dark  and  not  tacked  on  that  happy  ending.  I would  have written  it  so  that  Sanders realizes  he  can`t  function without  Letty,  that  his  life  is  empty  without  their symbiotic relationship,  He  didn't` really  want  to  marry  anyway.  It  was  a ploy  to  test  his  sister`s  love.  Realizing  that  he`s  left  alone  and  can`t  function  with  out  Letty,  he  drinks  the poison  and  ends  his  life.",1432771200,,509,4.6
422722,5,6302111099,"Robert Siodmak, one of noir's most important directors, has given us a wonderful b/w gem. The usually suave George Sanders plays against type and gives one of his best performances. And Geraldine Fitzgerald, playing his too loving sister, is perfect as the foil to Ella Raines who is in love with Sanders and threatens to take him away from the control of his sister. The ending may have been due to studio interference but it's a well-earned conclusion and I didn't see it coming. Too bad there are no extras included. A documentary on the work of Siodmak and Sanders would have been well-deserved and overdue.",1432512000,,611,4.773584905660377

422736,4,6302111099,"Always interesting / enjoyable to watch the slow, measured, and deliberate acting style of George Sanders. However even allowing for the era in which it was set. I found the storyline somewhat unbelievable. That of a near middle aged single man. Living with his 2 adult single sisters, in a quite life of reasonable domestic bliss. Until a young woman comes on the scene. Who develops a domestically destabilising, strong romantic attachment,to Sanders. Unfortunately the ending was was disappointing, if not somewhat unbelievable......Pity.............",1430697600,,553,5.674698795180723

422756,4,6302111099,"I thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie. Uncle Harry has two sisters who he lives with. One is a bit flighty and funny, but the other one is downright clingy and always acts sickly. When Harry gets a girlfriend, the clingy sister gets jealous and tries to ruin everything for the happy couple. This is a good film on a few different levels and provides food for thought afterwards-unlike many other films from the 40s that just help you go to sleep. George Sanders plays Uncle Harry as he runs to his sister's side whenever she takes ill. Harry's girlfriend is a breath of fresh air who's unconventional lifestyle really threatens Harry's sister and she offers him an ultimatum-after the girlfriend's ultimatum and possible engagement to another man, things get really interesting.

I get tired of TV and can never find much to watch these days. I enjoy watching old films and I found the quality and sound of this one is very good on Prime. The acting is fine and the story is entertaining with a twisty end that the studio had to warn viewers not to disclose to their friends lest they ruin it for them. For an old noir picture, this one is a good choice to spend a hour or so watching. I wish there were more quality films like this one to watch.  A lot of them have bad audio or video or are just boring.",1425945600,,1309,4.45
422757,4,6302111099,"I really enjoyed this film, and I appreciate Amazon Prime for digging up these wonderful old films and making them available to the public (I don't work for Amazon--I don't know the politics behind these films, if any--I just appreciate being able to see these films, and most for free). I'm a huge fan of George Sanders, who was wonderful as usual, and yet he did not overshadow the fine work of the female cast. The ending really threw me--a very, very strange twist--looking back, not completely unpredictable--but completely unexpected given traditional b/w films.  No ribbons and bows for Uncle Harry! This film is certainly worth watching.",1425254400,,645,5.02803738317757

422760,4,6302111099,"Uncle Harry is an intriguing nourish tale dealing with perhaps the most sensitive and forbidden relationships.  To see the subject broached in the mid 1940s is truly surprising.  Excellent and convincing performances by Geraldine Fitzgerald and George Sanders serve to solidify this sad affair.  The film is marred only by a contrived ending all too obviously edited in to satisfy the censors in the Hays Office.  Film historians have documented that producer, Joan Harrison, resigned from the project after Universal Studios opted for the cowardly conclusion of the film.",1418860800,,572,5.393258426966292

422765,4,6302111099,"Harry Quincey (George Sanders- REBECCA, THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY) lives w/ his kooky sisters, Lettie (Geraldine Fitzgerald) and Hester (Moyna Macgill). All is well, until Harry begins dating a beautiful woman named Deborah Brown (Ella Raines). This sets Lettie's teeth on edge, bringing out an ugly, ultra-possessive side of her personality. When Harry announces his engagement to Deborah, Lettie takes it... badly. When she wrecks Harry and Deborah's plans, it becomes clear that she has no intention of releasing her hooks from Harry, and desperate measures are taken. Of course, plans don't always turn out as... planned! THE STRANGE AFFAIR OF UNCLE HARRY is a showcase for Sanders, allowing him to show his dark side! The idea of having Ms. Raines to bedazzle us is a major plus! Alas, this loses a star for the cop-out ending, designed to wrap things up in all-too-sweet fashion! Ugh...",1412985600,,893,5.081632653061225
422766,4,6302111099,"This is a psychological study of a seemingly normal family that is actually quite dysfunctional in ways that are compelling (sometimes uncomfortable) to watch.  Like a lot of film noir it builds slowly, taking its time to reveal the motivations that drive the characters to the inevitable mistakes that create the real drama of the story.  The final third of the film is where the real payoff comes, with some interesting and unusual twists along the way.  The coda to the film is a terrible mistake, forced by the censorship codes of the mid-40s, and just one more example of why regulators ought to have nothing to do with the creation of art.  You can find a copy of the original play (""Uncle Henry,"" by Thomas Job) on Google books, and I'd recommend reading the end of the original to wipe the bad taste of the film's ending from your mind.  It's actually a 4.5 star story but for the ending, which drags it down into 3 star territory, so 4 stars on balance.",1411257600,,962,4.505747126436781

I did not think I would like it at first - oh, yes, here's George Sanders playing the smarmy bad guy again -- but he won me over about 1/3 of the way through.  Geraldine Fitzgerald absolutely shines in her role of a narcissistic sibling, and Ella Raines bound the family dynamic together artfully.  I kept seeing a face (one of Harry's friends) and voice that I knew I recognized from my childhood - it was Harry von Zell, from early television!  Not big news to most, but I didn't recall having seen him in movies before, although I'm sure he did.  At any event, give this movie a chance!  When it was over, I wasn't sure what had happened, and I had to think about it a bit before it all came together.  I really liked that!  Try it!",1404950400,,792,4.198675496688741

He, as I recall, always had a strong presence in all of his movies, not the least being that strong voice and stature. As a whole, the movie was entertaining from start to finish due to the unusual plot and the surprising ending. I'm still wondering about that. It will remain on my watch list to watch it again.

422789,4,6302111099,"I particularely am interested in 1940s movies because I was a kid then (5-15 years old) & remember (& have been re-viewing) movies my parents took my sister & me to see.  ""The Strange Affair of Uncle Harry"" was not among them, but of course debonair George Sanders was in many others that I remember.  Geraldine Fitzgerald made quite an impression in ""Wilson"" & Ella Raines appeared in other thrillers & film noir. This film is a gem & of course the ending was ""tacked on"" but so what. It's worthwhile watching.",1373068800,,511,4.543478260869565

He was very good as usual. Love the entire movie.",1373068800,,127,4.12
422793,3,6302111099,"This movie has a great story.  The incest situation is handled well.  It's not too blatant but obviously there.  However, it's all ruined by a really lousy ending, truly unbelievable.  How are dead people suddenly resurrected?  No explanation.  Weird!",1271203200,,251,5.3076923076923075

7820955,4,6302111099,"I agree with many of the previous reviewers, and thought the acting was superb.  I especially enjoyed seeing younger versions of B actors who later ended up in some of my shows from childhood (Petticoat Junction, early Gunsmoke episodes) but two things really bothered me.  1) Here you have this progressive female who is smart and 'onto' Harry's sister.  If she waited over 6 months for her sister-in-law to be to find a house, why not wait a half and hour and drive to the hospital where, presumably old 'Doc Adams' would conclude that Lettie was faking it again.  2) I was so impressed with that dark ending and the true evil/narcissist personality of Lette coming out in the jail scene.  I kept thinking ""is he so weak  minded he will not get over it?""  or ""Will he hop a train to NYC?""  When they cut to the next scene of him sitting in the chair with the poison I half expected him to take it and would have been disappointed...however, when they did that ridiculous final scene with Geraldine coming back and the sister coming back to life I immediately thought, ""Ugh!  Dallas scene take 1...'it was all a dream"")...I was certain that back in the day some executives sat around discussing the ending and decided it wouldn't be palatable to the general public to have such a dark ending and thus.....Dallas 1.0 Dream scene was
decided upon....pablam for the masses....so, for me, the ending was very disappointing.  However, it is worth watching and I did like it...it just left me feeling like I needed to rewind the last scene to check and see if he was dreaming or not...",1472169600,,1580,4.590747330960854

7820957,4,6302111099,"Entertaining Noir.  If you're not paying attention at the end, you will be confused by the ending.  I had to re-play it to understand.  Someone else posted that the ending was forced on the producer because of 'societal'  pressure and if true, the very ending, though confusing, then fits, albeit, uncomfortably.",1471564800,,312,5.0588235294117645
