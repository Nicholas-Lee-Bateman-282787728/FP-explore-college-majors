It will be a phenomenal addition to the curriculum for students to learn about Bachata Music, the countryside of the Dominican Republic, family values, and a life lesson about following one's dreams.  Thank you so much for creating such a wonderful documentary, I do believe it will be a blessing to many!",1395014400,,458,4.7594936708860756
8389281,5,B0035WTXP8,"I really enjoyed this film. It gives a great insight into the world of bachata as it describes the dreams and struggles of Joan Soriano to make it doing what he loves.  This movie also made me see how powerful music is, and how music belongs to everyone regardless of social status. I would recommend it to anyone that wants to learn about bachata more.",1385942400,,353,4.430769230769231
8389282,5,B0035WTXP8,"I have been listening and dancing to bachata for many years now.  I have been a fan of Joan for quite some time as well and have had the pleasure of seeing him live.  I have known of this documentary for quite some time and have seen clips here and there but had never seen the full film.  I have to say for someone who didn't think he could possibly love bachata anymore, this documentary made me fall in love with it all over again!  Not only does this give you a personal and intimate look at the artist (which is always a pleasure when you are already a fan because it connects you more) but it gives a great insight to the lifestyle and culture in which bachata music was created!  Adam does and amazing job of catching personal moments and making you feel as if you are with him and Joan every step of the way.  Whether you are a long time fan, new comer, or just a lover of music in general, I highly recommend this informational, insightful, inspiring, and refreshing documentary!  You will not be disappointed!  Great job Adam!",1381190400,,1036,4.331606217616581
8389283,5,B0035WTXP8,I love this film.  Adam was one of the first to document the roots of bachata.  Joan Soriano and his family are so pleasant and I enjoyed seeing images of the Dominican Republic.,1381190400,,178,4.363636363636363
8389284,5,B0035WTXP8,"This documentary of Joan Soriano, is a must see for all Bachateros as well as for anyone who enjoys listening to and dancing bachata. As a bachata instructor and having travelled to the Dominican Republic five times already to study the dance, this video has given me more appreciation and understanding for bachata as well as for Joan Soriano.  I met Joan Soriano on one of my visits a couple of years ago and will not forget him singing along with his songs on his car stereo as we drove to a club to do some dancing.  A well produced Bachata documentary by Adam Taub.  Caution: Watching this video will make you want to get up and dance bachata!!! :)",1379376000,3,653,4.425
8389285,5,B0035WTXP8,"I saw this documentary after I started learning bachata, the dance, and had had an opportunity to meet, see and hear Joan Soriano.  Over the years I grew to appreciate the film more and more and have watched it many times.  I became a student of bachata, the history of the music, the music and the dance over the years. In 2011 I travelled for the first time to the Dominican Republic to a bachata festival.  I was able to meet up with Joan on his turf, traveled around the city and countryside with him and friends.  The trip was highlighted by a visit to the farm where he grew up where I met his father and mother and others in the family. When we drove into the property and I saw the house with its neon green wall and spent the afternoon visiting, eating and dancing at the farm. I had to pinch myself. This was not just one of the ""sets"" of the documentary, it was real life. More important was that it clarified to me how accurately Adam Taub portrayed the way life is there and how the music is intertwined with it and especially ""El Duque"".  It is the way it is.  The warmth of the Joan and that of his family seen on the video is not just on film - he and his family are truly just that way.  His music speaks that way, his own musicianship and singing oozes feeling one cannot put into words, and if it truly resonates with you, it vibrates your soul.  The film can be easily understood and felt by anyone, but if you are one who enjoys the genre - it brings it closer to home.",1378425600,2,1490,4.131487889273356

Don't worry if you don't know what the word 'Bachata' means... you will after you follow Joan Soriano and his journey to bring his bachata music to the States!  Based on the viewing&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Duke-of-Bachata-Institutional-Version/dp/B0035WTXP8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Duke of Bachata, Institutional Version</a>, I was determined to see him live and now I am hooked!!  He is as kind, generous and wonderful in person as he is in the documentary!!  I now try to see him in concert whenever I can.

Thankfully, I was also able to meet the director, Adam Taub, and hear the behind the scenes making of the movie, learn some dance moves and expand my world to include Dominican dance, music and culture!  Everyone would enjoy this movie- but I am warning you....you will see the movie- then you will want to buy his CD, then you will want to see him in concert, then you will want to learn how to dance Bachata!  ;-)",1378425600,,1053,5.269461077844311
