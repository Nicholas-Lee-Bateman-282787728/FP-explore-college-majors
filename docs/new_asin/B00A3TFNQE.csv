8546558,3,B00A3TFNQE,"crime scene is a pretty good film. it definitely tries to play as a serious true crime program, i.e. anything aired on Discovery I.D.

it was a little boring in parts, too many interviews. and random photo montages. but still pretty fun.",1406160000,,237,4.642857142857143

when that German girl talks. Check it out.",1403568000,,113,4.7
8546560,5,B00A3TFNQE,"now i watch a lot of crime documentaries i literally have thousands , i have to be honest, i watched the first half an hour thinking i was watching an actual serial killer documentary featuring some of the most comical weird charachters i ever seen on tv, after literally laughing out so loud at one part i thought to myself this can not be a real
call me whatever you want but seriously i cant wait to play this when people come over pretending this was actually a  serious documentary and pranking others with it

this is a must see from crime show documentary addicts like myself :-)",1378166400,,586,4.416666666666667
8546561,3,B00A3TFNQE,"If you watch true crime shows like American Justice, you may get a kick out of this video, which replicates all the quirks of such shows - the unphotogenic friends and relatives of the offender, the irrelevant clips from old television shows and movies, etc. The only thing is, it's actually too good an imitation to be funny - unless you consider sex murders, violence against women, child abuse, and cruelty to animals funny. (No real cruelty to animals appears in the movie - all of the animals shown being mistreated are plastic toys.)  If you are at all sensitive, skip this movie. It's definitely not for young children.

If you want to see a very funny spoof on crime documentaries - without the cruelty - get hold of the old Woody Allan film TAKE THE MONEY AND RUN. I found it much more enjoyable.",1362787200,,805,4.544827586206897
