3923174,4,B002FOFX9M,These guys have the same chemistry and formula from the Friday movies but with another twist. I'm from Modesto and the cold part about this movie is it's somewhat true.

I was crying laughing hahahaha I watched it two or three times back to back I need to watch it again it's on my wishlist to buy for the collection,1355097600,,470,4.413793103448276

3923176,3,B002FOFX9M,"Racial stereotypes and the accoutrements of hip-hop culture come in for some gentle ribbing in ""Janky Promoters,"" a fairly innocuous though still relatively entertaining comedy written by and starring Ice Cube.

It's a tale of two second-rate music promoters (Ice Cube and Mike Epps) trying to stage a rap concert in Modesto, California, and the many personal and financial hurdles they have to jump over to pull it off. It's not a slashing satire by any stretch of the imagination, but a game cast (including an entertaining Young Jeezy who brings a great deal of charm to his portrayal of himself) and a few genuinely funny moments make up for its overall blandness.",1354233600,,668,4.911504424778761
3923177,5,B002FOFX9M,"Ice Cube and Mike Epps, this was one of the funniest movies since Friday 1, 2 and 3!  Cube and Epps are so funny and keep you laughing.  I think even if you don't relate to the characters, you will still find it very funny.  Here you have two men trying to make their dreams come true the best way they know how and run into all kind of drama making it happen.  In a world with so much crazyness going on, this movie will definately take you away from things and have you LAUGHING!  Love it.",1347235200,,491,4.020618556701031

3923210,5,B002FOFX9M,"Come on, people! This movie is soo funny. There is a lot of subtle humor in this film and it actually gets funnier and funnier the 2nd, 3rd, 4th time, etc. I actually bought it 4 times lol just to support Ice Cube & Mike Epps. I grew up on Cube's music and love everything Mike Epps does (even stand up) and they did not disappoint in this movie! Just the opposite. I LOVE IT.",1322006400,,376,4.026666666666666

3923212,2,B002FOFX9M,I loved iced cube back when he was with NWA but he really can't do comedy like he use to.  He's more of a diverse father figure type now a day's....Now Mike Epps is funny cause he get's hype over little things.,1290038400,,210,4.0
3923213,5,B002FOFX9M,The combination: Ice Cube and Mike Epps are very funny.  Ther is nothing more to say.  WATCH & ENJOY THE MOVIE.,1276041600,8,111,4.238095238095238
3923214,2,B002FOFX9M,"""Janky Promoters"" is the latest gleefully low-brow buddy comedy pairing Ice Cube and Mike Epps.  Here, the duo star as a pair of improbably incompetent concert promoters.  Cube (Russell Redds) and Epps (Jellyroll) have just struck a deal with popular hip-hop artist Young Jeezy (playing himself), and have less than 24 hours to finalize the logistics, despite the fact that they have less than $1,000 between them.

Thus begins a series of increasingly grating misadventures, as Russell and Jellyroll seek to con their way into having a successful show.  The filmmakers could have made the lead characters more likeable, despite their slacker status.  As it stands, despite the efforts of Cube and Epps, Russell and Jellyroll mainly come across as boorish clowns that you want to fail--Russell steals his fiance's checkbook to pay his share of the concert costs, and Jellyroll brags to a reality-TV crew that he's sleeping with a married woman (Character actors Tamala Jones and Glenn Plummer are wasted as the unfaithful wife and her cuckolded husband, respectively.)

It's hard to sympathize with most of the characters here; they to be reflexively foul-mouthed and defiantly ignorant.  Among the parade of eccentrics are star-struck hotel maids and a mom who prepares crack like it's Sunday dinner.  One of the few bright spots involves Russell's teen son `Young Seymour' (James ""Lil' JJ"" Lewis), an amateur rapper who nonetheless thinks he's entitled to a room-crowding entourage.  Russell's unabashed encouragement of Seymour's dancers to rump-shake more inadvertently highlights the recurring critique of rap-as-sexploitation.

Taking into account such film phenomena as American Pie, Wedding Crashers and The Hangover, `slob comedies' clearly have a place and an audience. Still, ""Promoters"" isn't likely to entice viewers beyond the converted.  Looking at the broader themes in the film, it could have been a more clever satire of behind-the-scenes goings-on in the hip-hop music industry (screenplay credit goes to Ice Cube.)  Yet the film functions as an unofficial sequel to the Friday movie series--in fact, given the cult popularity of those films, it's unclear why the filmmakers didn't go that route. Unless viewers are Ice Cube or Mike Epps completists, ""Promoters"" is a rental at best.",1270425600,,2302,5.363888888888889
3923215,5,B002FOFX9M,Ice Cube + Mike Epps = FUNNY... you can't deny the chemistry between these two once the camera starts rolling it's time to start laughing. You can put janky promotors right up there with the friday's series.,1270339200,,207,4.621621621621622
3923216,4,B002FOFX9M,"These two together always equal good entertainment. You will never be disappointed with this one because it surely is Janky Entertainment. Mike Epps, IceCube, young jezzy, and many more hilarious characters you have to watch this movie to see what Im talking about.",1262995200,,265,5.186046511627907
3923217,3,B002FOFX9M,"While this film is watchable, I definitely would rate this as the least liked of the corroborations between Cube and Mike Epps. I would also say it falls towards the bottom when you throw in the Friday series, and the other movies he's played a hand in creating. As a big Cube fan, musically and theatrically, this is hands-down one of his worst (which explains why it was never advertised before being released to the theater, and then quickly released to DVD). It has its moments, but those expecting the same quality of work will be disappointed.",1262476800,4,549,4.670103092783505
3923218,5,B002FOFX9M,"OK Ice Cube & Mike Epps at it again!  This is a cool movie. It's very very funny and not a ""low budget"" type flick.  I feel it's a quality movie (meaning good lighting--not dark where you can hardly see anyone).  The movie is funny all the way through!  Highly recommend for anyone!",1261526400,,282,4.264150943396227
