4069942,4,B003552QWW,"Robert Benchley was one of the great American humorists of the 1930s. His shorts were popular additions to the movies shown in the 1930s and 1940s, with commentary and observations on modern life which were popular at the time. Most of his jokes still resonate today, although at times Benchley's delivery leaves something to be desired. A fun set of ""miniatures!""",1313366400,2,364,4.983606557377049
4069943,4,B003552QWW,"All the MGM Robert Benchley Short Subjects are here. All 30 of them.
If you have a nostalgic memory of sitting in the theatre many years ago, viewing these ""gems"" of
observation, here you go!(or catching them now and then on TCM today)
Includes a Academy Award Winer for best Short Subject.
For all Benchley fans!
If only TCM would release the Pete Smith Specialities to accompany the Benchley Shorts and the Behind The 8 Ball/Joe McDoakes classics.
Here's hoping!!",1297641600,17,465,4.825
4069944,3,B003552QWW,"If you are a fan of Robert Benchley's writing, of course you need this to complete your collection, which is why I give this three stars. His humor doesn't quite translate to the screen, probably because these short films by their nature depend a bit more on images than snappy repartee. Many of them are a bit stodgy compared to Benchley's sharp, quick, written humor. So...first step, any anthologies of his humor articles you can find. (Bonus - hysterical illustrations by Gluyas Williams.)Second step, his brilliant theatre reviews. Then, complete your collection with this admittedly rare anthology of shorts.",1264377600,15,614,5.212121212121212

4069952,5,B003552QWW,"I've loved Robert Benchley from the first time I saw him on the late show, providing comedy relief in countless movies.
So when his ten minute movie shorts, which delighted moviegoers in the 1930's and 1940's, began running on TCM,
I tried to record them whenever possible.

So you can imagine my delight to find them finally released on this DVD set.  Benchley's sly, tongue-in-cheek style is  as funny today as it was when these were first filmed.  And the subjects are still topical, and some are especially so
(income taxes, political campaigning, etc.)

For those who are not acquainted with Robert Benchley, here is a perfect introduction.",1398297600,3,645,4.935185185185185

4069954,5,B003552QWW,"Classic Benchley. Sometimes subtle, sometimes obvious, the humor holds up all these years later. How to eat is a personal favorite.",1387152000,2,131,5.285714285714286

8388686,5,B003552QWW,"Although little remembered nowadays, Robert Benchley (18891945) has long been one of my favorite humorists. (Even his better known colleague at ""The New Yorker,"" James Thurber, was in awe of his talent.) I've waited a long time to see these classic one-reel comedies on DVD and am not disappointed. This is quiet wit from a gentler era of movie-making (the 1930s): few belly-laughs, but many chuckles. Not farce, but mirth. What you miss in these films is the inspired silliness of Benchley's published humor; what you gain is Benchley himself, in all his droll gentlemanliness.

I noticed that a fellow reviewer entitled an entry, ""Bob Benchley's Shorts."" I can only imagine how broadly Benchley would have smiled at that phrase.",1506211200,,730,5.083333333333333
