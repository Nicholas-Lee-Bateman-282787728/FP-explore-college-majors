2438388,5,B000BR9LY8,"Wow! After reading a few of these reviews, I have to say that we disagree at our house. First of all, we love the option to have the words displayed at the bottom of the screen so our kids are being exposed to words while enjoying this pleasant DVD.

While ""Father Abraham"" has somewhat ""creepy costumes"" and doing the traditional movements would be nice, the thing I like about this DVD is that it's not filled with animation. There's no movement/animation that can potentially lead to ADD/ADHD. There are real kids singing and moving about. While some think it's unrealistic for a child to be on a playground singing and dancing, well, they haven't seen every style of kid out there.

My daughter (4 yrs old), for example, loves to sing while she plays on our play scape out back. Of course, my son (only 11 months) might be completely different. While the kids facial expressions might be a little unrealistic, so is a veggie that talks with an odd little voice. I like the ""Veggie Tales"" main purpose to tell Bible stories but they can be a little more aggressive than what we expose our kids to... monsters and vegetables fighting with swords are more than what we want them to see. The world is filled with enough hate that they will learn about all too soon. For now, we like the sweet, little, real kids singing and ""appearing"" to be happy and loving life. After all, if we show them this positive way of behaving maybe something good will come of it.

With all this said, our DVDs are finally worn out from traveling with them and watching them over the last 2 years. We are getting ready to purchase another set so, yes, she can stop checking them out from the church library.",1258934400,25,1686,4.503267973856209
2438389,5,B000BR9LY8,"My daughter loves these DVDs.  Yes the ""action"" songs DVD isn't a mini gym class, but that's not what I bought it for.  My 3 year old learned lots of good Bible songs & I can actually stand to listen to them, unlike most children's singing productions that are high, screetchy, & untrained.

There are clearly 2 groups of kids, the ones that have musical training & sing the songs in the studio and the ones that are there to be cute in the video.  There is a little bit of mismatch between the audio & video sometimes, but no little kid watching is really going to notice or care.  Some of the outfits are a bit out of date, but it just makes it more interesting to watch.  The video scene isn't always very relevant, but again makes it interesting to watch.",1248220800,3,759,4.2727272727272725
2438390,4,B000BR9LY8,"I won't get into all the specifics of the videos themselves,,sure they should have actions that go along with the songs.  The reality is that my son loves these!!!!  Anytime he is having a rough time or is wound up, we turn these on, he calms down immediatly.  He has a great time watching them, as well as my two neices who are older.  My son who is now 18 months, is a typical active rambunctious boy, has been spell bound by these vids ever since he was very tiny.  I highly recomend them, not because I like them, but because my son does.",1224460800,7,542,4.173076923076923
2438391,1,B000BR9LY8,"I agree with missionary from RI!  We were VERY disappointed in the quality of these DVDs.  The Bible Action Songs were full of songs that had little or NO accompanying actions, just kids singing the songs, walking around, with very plastic-y expressions, and then here or there some random unrelated footage of kids playing, apparently while still mouthing the words to the song.  In fact, this is the case for all three DVDs in this set.  They're all boring, with very random footage (kids sitting, walking, playing while singing).  It's too bad, because we'd love a DVD with ACTIONS accompanying these well known songs.  (Anyone know any??)",1220313600,2,642,4.953271028037383
2438392,4,B000BR9LY8,"My 2 year old niece loves these DVDs.  My sister in law uses them at church in Argentina with the little ones who love the Spanish dubbing.  They are upbeat, my niece dances or wiggles along with them, and they are songs with a positive message.

I would suggest buying one, and seeing if your kid likes them before investing in the set.  I can see where some kids would prefer the motions, but some kids just make up their own. The CDs are great for car trips, all 5 of my nieces and nephews like those.",1213488000,3,504,4.164948453608248
2438393,5,B000BR9LY8,"I think it may depend how early you introduce these DVDs to your kids as far as how well they will like them.  We bought this for our daughter at 13 months and she thoroughly enjoys watching the kids singing the songs.  She loves to clap/dance as she watches.  The music is very pleasant and easy to listen to.

Update:  My daughter is now 3 1/2 and I now have a son who is almost 2.  They both still enjoy these Cedarmont DVDs.  We have added more to our collection and there is not one DVD preferred over the others.  All we have seen have been done well and are very interesting to my kids.  We also gave some of the DVDs to my niece (4 yrs) and she loves them as well.",1212969600,19,672,3.992481203007519
2438394,2,B000BR9LY8,"My wife and I were disappointed with this purchase. We depended on the reviews on Amazon. We assumed with 5 star ratings, we would get good quality. So, hopefully giving our opinion will help balance it out for future customers. I won't be too picky. I could say more, but I will just give what I think potential buyers would want to know.

With one of the DVD's labeled ""Bible Action Songs"", I would have expected to see the kids doing physical actions along with the music throughout all the songs. This was my wife's primary interest in getting the DVD's. It was just the opposite. There were some actions here and there, but very little compared to what you would expect. ""Father Abraham"", for example had nothing (as far as actions you can teach your kids) in the whole song. In fact, you feel like you're losing brain cells while you're watching that song. There are three kids wearing these ridiculous- even scary-looking costumes that make you only able to see their legs. the rest of the costume looks like somebody took a large bed sheet, wrapped it around them, did a big sloppy paint job for eyes, nose, and mouth with paint brushes, and then threw a wig on it. The kids spent the entire song turning back and forth so that the cloth arms of these costumes would swing back and forth. Finally, they all fall to the ground. There is no ""right arm, left arm, right foot, left foot, chin up..."" It was a complete waste of time. There was also the song...can't remember the name, but they say ""I'm inright, outright, upright, downright happy all the time"" or something like that. The kids literally just do flips the whole song. That's it- they just flip.

Another thing is that the video usually does not match up well with the audio. I don't know if this was the fault of the editing though. Of course, you would expect them not to use the kids voices while they were dancing. That should be done in a recording studio. It just looked awkward though- like the kids are not actually singing...just mouthing the words. And while some of these kids were cute, there others that made you think their parents said, ""alright, here's your chance to make it on the big screen. Give it all you got."" So, the kids are performing in an exagerrated way wearing sometimes dorky clothes or costumes. Terrible- they looked ridiculous. I hope I don't sound horrible for saying that. I don't think I am being too critical, but there are some songs I just can't watch. There's especially the little girl who will not stop turning her head back and forth. Ug!

One last thing- probably most important. On one of the other Cedarmont DVD reviews, one of the parents said her kids love the DVD's and enjoy having their friends over where they watch them together. The most disappointing thing about these DVD's to my wife an me is that our son does not really like them. The music is okay- you know, the basic Sunday School songs (and they have it with Spanish overdubbed which I like), but if we want something that he will actually sit down and watch, we put in Veggie Tales, because he is just not into the Cedarmont DVD's. I wonder if maybe the other reviews were a little biased- maybe friends or fellow church members of the people who put the videos together.

Sorry Cedarmont- I am just trying to give an honest review.",1212537600,7,3315,4.52
2438395,5,B000BR9LY8,This was our second Cedarmont Kids purchase and we are very pleased.  The tunes are catchy and clear so our little ones can learn the songs and sing along.  The video also keeps their attention.  Great for trips in the minivan.,1183939200,13,227,4.487804878048781
2438396,5,B000BR9LY8,"I found these videos on YouTube, and my two-year-old daughter loved them so much, I decided to purchase the set.  ""Sunday School songs"" is what she requests instead of Daniel Tiger these days, which I love!  She is always singing these songs around the house now, which is exactly the kind of thing that I want to be filling her head!  Although outdated, I think that these are sweet videos.  I like the fact that there are real children singing the songs.  As a music lover myself, I appreciate that the songs themselves are very well recorded and sound very nice.  I don't mind hearing them each day!  We are definitely getting good use out of these!",1454457600,3,652,4.521367521367521

2438413,5,B000BR9LY8,"We bought these for our granddaughter for her first birthday.  She enjoyed them then, but loves them much more now, at 18 months, than she did then.  Anytime she is grumpy, we can put a Cedarmont DVD on and it cheers her right up, and makes her happy, and that's what's important to us.  She and my daughter (her Mom) no live with us while Daddy is in Afghanistan. Many an evening these DVD's buy us enough time to get dinner ready, whereas without them, she would be ""OVER THE EDGE"" (and I think most Moms and Grandmas know exactly what I mean). Her favorite song is ""If You're Happy and You Know It Say Amen....Clap Your Hands....Stamp your Feet....""  She makes us sing it OFTEN when the DVD isn't on.  She isn't talking much yet, but when she wants us to sing it, she comes up and stands right in front of us, points one foot and stamps it over and over.  We know what to do!!!!!  Anytime she thinks we're not as happy as WE should be, she will require us to sing this song!!!  And I have to say, it works! I'm not sure if that song is on one of the DVD's in this collection, or on an individual Cedarmont DVD we bought separately (also from Amazon) because we just have a hundred CD's and DVD's loaded into our player and we just pick the number of what we want to play, so I'm not sure which ones came in this set and which were separate.
Grandma, Granddad, Mom, Dad.....none of find these songs obnoxious to listen to, even after they've been on for a while.  We can't say that about a LOT of other CD's and DVD's.
We do wish they did more of the hand motions that go along with the songs, the hand motions I used to teach the little ones in Children's Church 30 years ago!!!!  But they keep our granddaughter's rapt attention nonetheless, so if she's happy.....we're happy.",1396051200,3,1780,4.255192878338279
2438414,5,B000BR9LY8,My kids grew up watching these with great enjoyment. I had to buy these when another little one came along a few years after I had passed on our original videotapes.  Our 23-month-old loves the Christmas DVD already.,1387929600,,216,4.684210526315789
2438415,5,B000BR9LY8,Cedarmont anything is great.  Buy the DVD's first and get the children hooked on that for a long time - then buy the CD's and you'll find they've learned all the songs.

2438420,5,B000BR9LY8,"This has to be the realest collection of Bible children's video I have ever viewed. I first had one of these DVD's about 10 years ago and couldn't get enough of it (oh, and the kids liked it too lol).

I recently decided to order it again and was pleased to find three of the discs all in one package! I think Cedarmont did a really nice job on shooting and editing their stuff. It wasn't too silly like all those live-action technicolor children's shows out now.  The lyrics were of serious old time hymns yet the pairing with young people either acting out scenes or just playing at the park made it relaxing and enjoyable to watch.

I really love this collection.",1366502400,2,666,4.3983739837398375

It has adorable kids singing great songs (including some Christmas ones on one dvd). Sure the outfits and kids are from a couple years back, but my kids love it. I highly recommend this collection. My son weekly requests ""100 Bible Songs."" He has learned so many and loves dancing around and singing to it. Cedarmont Kids provides exceptional products at exceptional prices. We have this and a bunch of their other products- love love love love them!",1344038400,2,557,4.752577319587629
2438425,5,B000BR9LY8,"Like Bob said at the end of DVDs, my children 3 and 2 have watched these DVDs over and over. They learn many songs from singing along with the Cedarmont kids. For some, this may looked outdated as it was filmed quite long ago, but I still love it because my kids get to see how kids in the past look like. I also bought their song books and play them while my kids singing. As a pianist, I love the arrangements, simple yet creative. Nowadays, there are a lot more DVDS made that have kids singing. My kids also watch and love some of those; however they learn most of the songs from the Cedarmont because there's less animation. SOme may like something more animation, action, and more complicated instrumention. It's just a matter of taste, I guess!
I always recommend Cedarmont to my friends who are looking for Christian DVDs to buy for their children.",1334448000,2,856,4.45859872611465

All the words are clear, so it's easy for the kids to memorize the songs. I don't advocate putting young ones in front of the TV, but this dvd is the exception, even a 6 month child will enjoy the music and the movement of the children. I love the gospel songs.",1334016000,2,409,4.466666666666667
2438427,5,B000BR9LY8,"The first time I put in the Bible Songs DVD, my 12 month old son went from cranky and crying to completely captivated.  Then about 5-10 minutes later, he was sound asleep.  I thought the fact that it was something new to him was the reason he responded so well to it.  But every time I put in one of the discs from this set, he stops whatever he was doing and stares.

And yes...the dvd's are SUPER cheesy...BUT WHO CARES?!  My sister and I can't help but laugh at the outfits (I'm an 80's child so I feel their pain!) but apparently my son could care less about the dated choreography and wardrobe.  He just loves the music and singing.  The children really do have beautiful voices.  I'm guessing that's why this DVD is such a hit.",1325030400,3,733,4.260869565217392

The videos are not for adults, but for toddlers and young children.  One of the reasons I bought this DVD series is because the entertainment is geared towards the children.  Too many TV shows on TV are geared to catch the parents' eyes and then have them show it to their children.  I also chose Cedarmont Kids over other children videos b/c it had real children instead of cartoons.  Although the children are on the TV screen I feel that it engages her more than a cartoon would.

I want my nieces and nephews to experience the same but I am not sure what kind of teachers they may have, as some of them don't have the opportunity to go to Christian schools.. I'm glad I've come across these CEDARMONT DVDs in my online browsing.  I purchased the ACTION BIBLE SONGS first, brought it to my home country, and voila! Not only my nieces and nephews enjoy it, but our neighbors and our friends in the neighborhood.  This may be pricey to me, but I don't mind.  I feel good to hear them singing the songs so happily and perfectly!  While I was in the kitchen one time, I heard somebody was talking in the living room where our TV was. When I checked, I was so surprised!  It was my niece talking.. I couldn't believe she could also learn a beautiful accent, and learn English through the songs, as there are captions/subtitles available!

Some of the kids do have overly exaggerated expressions and actions, but I love the message, and my baby loves the kids and music, so that is what matters to me.

I would enjoy it if the action songs had more actions for the kids to copy, as mentioned by other reviews, however, with that not being the case, they still stand on their own for what they are. As for the quality issues, I have never thought the quality was BAD. Obviously they are not recording the singing while shooting the actions, but this is a kids video, not MTV....I like it puts plainly but brightly colored kids in everyday circumstances, like on a farm or on a playground, and just shows them kids having a good time.
