8528974,4,B008MIOSVY,"Shanghai is interesting in that it's a remake of Costas Gravas' Z but it doesn't quite feel like it. You can see all the bits and pieces but you don't feel like you're slogging through a retread. A similar situation would be William Friedkin's remake of Wages of Fear with Sorcerer.

Basic plot, a politician shows up to give a speech and gets run down by a car. It's clear that there's probably fowl play and a white supporter of the politician and a random shady guy on the street team up to prove it. Unfortunately for them, there's a bunch of extra corrupt politicians using their supporters to try and stop them, which mostly seems to add up to trying to killing them because go big or go home.

It's hard not to write sarcastically about this movie because the movie is sarcastic itself. It's a Bollywood film so there are of course musical sequences. Except here they're a bit more integrated into the plot at hand and usually connected with moments of corruption or madness. Adding insult to injury for some is the rather tongue in cheek nature of some of it. I understand one of the songs got censored in India so if you're into bizarre cultural artifacts like that then this might be more up your alley. The sarcasm works is the thing. When you make a movie about possible cultural corruption, there's the danger of being one note and the sarcasm helps break that up.

If there's one thing to recommend this movie on, it's that it's the sort of Indian movie you can show anyone. Think David Fincher remaking The Game with a much smaller budget and a few musical sequences tossed in and you'll begin to get the idea. It's also surprisingly concise just barely clocking in around 2:10, which is shorter than the average Christopher Nolan or Hunger Games blockbuster at this point. So, if you're looking to get some people to be more adventurous with their viewing, it's a good start and that's the most anyone can hope for.",1423440000,,1931,4.543103448275862
8528975,4,B008MIOSVY,"Dibakar Banerjee's film Shanghai focusses on the promises made by political leaders in India to turn poor towns in to bustling megapolises such as Shanghai. The development brings jobs and aspirations are met but there is a cost. It is based on the Vassilis Vassilikos' novel `Z',. The film is set in the town of Bharat Nagar. An ambitious development is expected to turn around the fortunes of the town. The leftist Dr Ahmadi( Prosenjit) realizes that it would lead to the displacement of a lot of people and tries to warn them becoming a thorn in the sides of chief minister ( Supriya Pathak) and her coalition partner ( Kiran Karmarkar) He is met with an accident and a committee is set up to investigate the case, headed by T.A. Krishnan headed by Abhay Deol. Jogi Parmar ( Emraan Hashmi) a porn film maker has some footage that will be damning for the government but the fight is not that easy.
The film is extremely slow but to see major stars in such a movie is a treat, the last 20 minutes of the film are very engaging and what has become the hallmark of all Dibakar Banerjee's films it is the last twenty minutes and the end that is truly shocking.
Banerjee has made some great films in the past,  such as Love Sex aur Dhokha easily one of the most influential films of the last decade. With Shanghai, the bar is set higher again. The song Bharat Mata ki Jai is great. The acting and the story are good as well. This is a different film and will appeal only to a select audience. Four stars.",1349568000,3,1501,4.379928315412187
