8069047,4,B0009X6ROQ,"This is the story of the sinking and subsequent discovery of the Frau Maria, a small cargo ship that sank in 1771 carrying a treasure trove of art and paintings from Holland to purchaser Catherine the Great of Russia.  The ship sank in the Baltic in a storm at night after being blown off course and then hitting submerged rocks.

There is great footage of the intact wreck, with it appearing that the hold is still stuffed to the gills, with much conjecture as to if any of the artwork could have survived, and what would be the best procedure to bring it to the surface.  Not to mention who actually owns the wreck and its contents.  Maybe I missed it, but it is unclear if the diving is being done by John Chatterton or if he is narrating dives undertaken by others.  The diver who actually located the wreck is miffed that the wreck has been taken away from him by the authorities.

There have been some subsequent postings on the Internet that the wreck has been claimed by Russia, and that there are plans in the works to salvage the wreck and/or its contents, although these are mostly from 2008.  So it might be worthwhile to do some more research to see what the status of the wreck is at present.  Overall, an interesting video, but not nearly as intriguing as one that is yet to be produced as the contents are salvaged, identified, and conserved.",1313625600,,1358,4.44758064516129
