4486498,5,B004WE731Y,This DVD is a reassuring piece of modern history showing the love towards the human race and the earth by a group of women who have paid their dues in life and still love it. It is a reverent piece honoring wonderful women of age.,1347062400,,230,4.133333333333334
4486499,3,B004WE731Y,"The movies has a good heart, the grandma's do too.  There just isn't a clear plan or message here.  It's not a movie on specific problems.  It doesn't have anything resembling a coherent plan.

The grandmothers do share their life stories and rather specific accounts of the larger global problems of human and environmental exploitation and destruction. It does have 13 grandmothers sharing their spiritual visions and eating hallucinogenic mushrooms.

If you're looking for a documentary on modern shamanism with a hint of environmentalism and humanism.  This would be it.

If your looking for a documentary about the real problems facing future generations and what you can do to help there are better ones out there.",1339459200,4,720,5.155172413793103
4486500,4,B004WE731Y,Some nice information here and it's inspiring to see these grandmothers persevere. It shows a wonderful movement that is leading the way into a new shift in consciousness. The video quality could have been better but there is great footage to be seen.,1330300800,6,251,4.8604651162790695
4486501,5,B004WE731Y,"Awesome footage of women who believe strongly that they are called to invoke a brighter future for us all...includes a visit with the Dalai Lama by 13 relatively unknown women called together by spiritual visions and the gifts which their own grandmothers have possessed for many generations.  Includes intriguing interactions with husbands, sons and other men in leadership working in tandem to acheive balance between the sacred masculine and feminine...A MUST SEE... for all who wonder what our future holds...HEARTWARMING. ~mmf",1329350400,11,531,5.555555555555555

8445046,5,B004WE731Y,"I recommend reading the book first, then follow up with the DVD.  The DVD shows more of what you read including the expressions, the sharing, the feeling. The DVD gives you more than what you read about including experiencing the ceremonies, the meetings, etc.  I was moved.  I cried as I felt it all too. I will share this with those closest to me.  I have already shared the book for Christmasa gifts.  Recommend this to everyone who gets the book.",1417651200,4,450,4.506172839506172
