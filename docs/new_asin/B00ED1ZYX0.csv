8604115,5,B00ED1ZYX0,"Absolutely first rate miniseries on the German experience in World War II.  Basically, a German ""Winds of War"" or ""Band of Brothers.""  The production values are first class and the battle scenes are amazing.

Other reviewers have dinged this series because it is in a foreign language.  Yes, it is subtitled!  That is not a reason to give it a low review.",1428969600,3,355,4.661290322580645
