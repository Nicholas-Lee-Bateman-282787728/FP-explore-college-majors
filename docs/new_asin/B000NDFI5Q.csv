8177369,5,B000NDFI5Q,"When Master Leung tries to rob Wong I-Hsia of a precious cargo he must protect, Wong I-Hsia fights him off with the iron palm and makes his escape. Too old and weak to continue his mission, Wong I-Hsia entrusts the cargo to his eldest son, Wan Fu (Peter Yang Kwan, Knight of Old Cathay, Flying Swordsgirl), who wastes no time in proving his fighting skills as he slays 50 of Master Leung's men, fighting off a forest ambush. But Wan Fu soon learns he is not a one man army, as he is wounded by Master Leung's archers, and falls, with his cargo, out of reach of the bandits and escapes with the help of a powerful swordswoman who will not give her name.

When the beautiful and infamous Pi-Ku, known as the Golden Dart reveals herself to be Wan Fu's rescuer, the truth about the connection between their families, and an oath of vengeance begins to be revealed, only to reignite a bitter blood feud which separates father and son, brother and sister. Families find themselves at the point of each others swords, in this non stop Wuxia sword film.

From Director Joseph Kuo (Mystery of Chess Boxing, Seven Grandmasters), Son Of Swordsman, employs groundbreaking filming techniques, and high-speed action sequences.",1348617600,2,1212,4.712264150943396
