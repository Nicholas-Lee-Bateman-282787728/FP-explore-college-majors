1890520,5,B00009V7PY,"This is absolutely the best workout video I've ever owned.  Broken into 15-minute chunks that fit the little cracks in my daily schedule, these workouts are fun and rewarding.
My favorite is the abs workout.  I also own the Ab Workouts For Dummies video, and I figured this segment of the 15 minute tape would just duplicate the other video.  I was thrilled to see that it was a new ab workout.  Sure, every ab workout is going to have a few variations on crunches, there's no getting around that.  But there were several new exercises included, and the presentation was completely different.
I've been recommending this video to just about everybody I know.  If you want a great workout that's fun and fits your schedule, give this one a shot.",1084233600,22,744,4.641221374045801
1890521,4,B00009V7PY,"This series of 15 minute workouts is good for toning.  There is a section each for thighs, arms using hand weights, glutes which is mostly exercises on the floor, and abs.  Each session has a good warm up (better than most quick toning workouts) that lasts for about five minutes and actually increases my heart rate. The exercises are simple and easy to execute.  There are modifications to make them easier as well as harder though they usually just involve either using a chair or adding weights respectively.  The exercises are quite repetitive and do get a little boring, but they are effective.
I found the little tips that come up on the screen using the icons like in a ""for dummies"" books somewhat annoying.  Then information was mostly obvious or at least things that I had heard before many times, and sometimes it comes up when I was doing exercises on the floor and had no real way to read it anyway.  I'm sure that part of the DVD will get annoying quickly, and once I learn the moves I'll listen to my own soundtrack.  All in all, these workouts (two or so at a time) make a great addition to my cardio routine.",1075939200,4,1126,4.463414634146342
1890522,4,B00009V7PY,"I enjoy this DVD and I think its great for beginners. The exercises are very easy to follow and not too hard to do. Gay speaks clearly and explains the moves well. I also enjoy the extra tips, and it shows you ways to make the moves more basic or more advanced. You get a good workout but do not feel overly tired. This is also a great DVD for you if you're looking to do strength training and become more toned.
The only thing I dislike about the DVD is that the warm-up routines are hard to follow. Gay does them very quickly and doesnt really show you how to do them. But after you watch them a few times you catch on.",1066521600,7,621,4.016129032258065

1890524,3,B00009V7PY,"My only real complaint is that you go straight into the the workout and then halfway through, she tells you the modifications or intensifying actions you can do half way through the routine for that movement.

1890525,5,B00009V7PY,One of the most complete and effective body workout routines. My wife started using it and I joined her out of curiosity and I wanted to try something new. This program will smoke your buns and your guns and you will notice a difference in inches with persistence and proper diet and cardio implementation. Adding weights to the program will challenge those advanced fitness types for sure.,1386547200,2,390,4.835820895522388
1890526,5,B00009V7PY,"This is the most effective work out video I've ever used. It's great for arms and abs. The workouts are short, but very effective so you see results relatively soon. I would definitely recommend this video to anyone.",1383696000,,216,4.7105263157894735

1890528,5,B00009V7PY,"I JUST STARTED USING EXERCISE VIDEOS TO EXERCISE.  I REALLY LIKED HOW THIS VIDEO TARGETS FOUR AREAS OF THE BODY (ARMS, ABS, BUNS, THIGHS).  THE FIRST TIME I DID THIS VIDEO I WAS SORE FOR DAYS, BUT THAT LET ME KNOW THAT I WAS REALLY WORKING MUSCLES THAT I USUALLY DONT.  I THINK IT IS A GREAT VIDEO, ESPECIALLY FOR BEGINERS LIKE ME.  GAY GASPER DOES A GOOD JOB KEEPING YOU MOTIVATED WITHOUT BEING SUPER CHEESY AND ANNOYTING.  THE ONLY CON I WOULD SAY IS THAT I THOUGHT IT WAS QUITE HARD TO FOLLOW THE WARM-UP PART OF EACH SECTION.  GAY GASPER GOES VERY FAST WITH THESE.  AFTER DOING IT A FEW MORE TIMES I AM CATCHING ON, THOUGH.

1890530,5,B00009V7PY,"I've been very pleased with this.  The exercises are easy enough to do yet also somewhat challenging and they bring forth results.  I have gotten compliments on my body since adding this workout regimen to my working out stable (I do it about 3X a week).  I usually don't do the thighs one as some of the moves hurt my knees but the other 3 15-minute exercises are great.  This is also informative and well done though there are a few slight errors that I'm surprised they didn't edit out.  That said, it helps me feel more like I'm in a class - it's not too glossy or overproduced.",1312156800,,582,4.302752293577981
1890531,2,B00009V7PY,"I started with the ""thighs"" section, and it was lightning speed switching between all sorts of different exercises, a couple of one, a couple of another, like dancing but nobody showing you the steps first. How about one exercise at a time. Show how to do it. Then do the reps of that one until it's finished. Then proceed to do the same with the next one. What is the purpose of mixing and matching them all up? I don't feel like watching it a dozen times through just to be able to follow it. Anyway, I found it frustrating and hard to follow.",1306713600,5,545,4.25

1890535,4,B00009V7PY,"I purchased this DVD so I can get a decent overall workout in 15 minutes. What I didn't know is that this workout dvd contains four different 15 minute workouts to foucus on major parts of our body: thighs, arms, buns, and abs. I was pretty disapointed when i realized this and didn't use this dvd for over a year, it didn't help being that the workouts were confusing. But I came back to when I felt i needed to muscularize my thighs and abs- and so that is what I've been doing: the 15 minute workout for thighs + the 15 minute workout for abs which gives me a combined workout for 1/2 and hour which is pretty darn good timing for a pretty darn good workout. The first time you try this dvd it will be confusing but I assure you that after using the dvd 3x's a week u will get the hang of it!! and when u do the results will show!

1890539,5,B00009V7PY,"I was sedentary from a long bout with cancer which lasted many years, cluminating in a bone marrow transplant.  Needless to say, I was very out of shape.  My sister sent me this video to help get me back into shape.  It was difficult at first, but it is fun and rewarding.  At first, I was only able to keep up by just barely going through the motions, trying to get through as best I can.  I have exercised to the video 12 times now, 3 times a week.  I feel great all over and back on track to being fit.  As a 45 year old, I don't like other videos featuring silicone enhanced females, hip hop, pole dancing, belly dancing or the other stuff that is now popular.  This is a great video for my generation featuring a modest, pleasant, friendly woman.  An additional bonus, my back pain is gone, which was a result of my being overweight.  I'm still overweight, but my abs and back are much stronger and the pain is gone.",1243468800,2,921,4.211428571428572

There are 3 settings Basic, Regular, and Challenge.  Everyone from a beginner to a long time exerciser can start right at once.  You can do one part or all 4 parts.

Of course there's the ultimate proof that it does help(at least myself) with weight loss, stress relief, and blood pressure.  You don't need a Nautilus, only two sets of hand weights.

The main issue I have with this dvd is that the warm up routines are too dancy(I can't think of a better word).  Modification is necessary for myself.

If someone were starting an exercise program; this dvd is a good start.  For the long time fitness buff, this can be used on recovery days.",1243382400,2,1178,5.636363636363637
1890541,4,B00009V7PY,This is a great work-out (don't worry about following the somewhat complicated warm-up exercises step-by-step; it's just important to warm up).  The actual exercises are a really good addition to any routine,1241308800,,207,5.46875
1890542,4,B00009V7PY,Arrived on time and in good condition. Easy to follow and keep up with. Provides good supplemental information while working out. Gay Gasper is pleasant to follow and inspirational.,1240876800,,181,5.275862068965517
1890543,3,B00009V7PY,If this is for dummies then I am dumb.  It is very bland and boring.  The instructor routinely changes moves before she says what she is going to do. I found myself constantly trying to guess what was going to come next and then ended with less of a workout because I wasn't following it entirely. I constantly had the wrong arms or legs because she changes up so quickly and without notice. It's too late when your arms are already going up in the air to make then now go down at a seconds notice or to try and follow some seemingly random pattern of alternating moves. I did not like this video for that reason. She could have better explained what she was doing. I guess if you did this often enough then you would know the next move but this is supposed to be for dummies! I am not a novice at exercie and wanted this for the 15 minute workout periods.,1235952000,3,856,4.181818181818182
1890544,2,B00009V7PY,"The warm-ups in this video are not for dummies. They are too quick and too complex. I do a Leslie Sansome exercise dvd for my warm-up and skip the warm-ups. It's really good that this dvd is set up so you can do that. The strength training exercises are much easier to follow, but she does not demonstrate a basic version of the exercise until about halfway through. Basic versions are shown only briefly. This would be an excellent dvd if the warm-ups were simplified and the basic versions were demonstrated at the beginning. It would also be better if another person demonstrated the basic version throughout the exercise.",1224288000,3,625,4.743119266055046
1890545,5,B00009V7PY,I love this DVD because you can do a quick 15 minute workout in the morning even if you don't have much time.  Then if you do have more time you can do 2 or 3.  Exercises aren't too difficult and it does show advanced and more simpler moves.  The only thing I don't like about this video is the name.  No one is a dummy if they are making an effort to workout!,1223251200,2,360,3.824324324324324
1890546,5,B00009V7PY,"I love the whole ""For Dummies"" line of workouts, books, etc. This dvd is instructional (basic, intermediate, advance); and it provides helpful facts and comments that has helped me to trasfrom my body.

1890547,5,B00009V7PY,"I bought this DVD two years ago and STILL use it. It's better than any weight machine I use at the gym (particularly the abs workout).
The warm ups can get confusing but they only last a few minutes so don't get discouraged! Keep trying and eventually you'll catch on like anything. This video is intense but is not intimidating. I've gotten amazing result in as little as 15 minutes a day! Seriously! It also has some recipes and ideas on how to eat healthier and cut calories. It really is a gem for those who are willing to invest 15 minutes a day at least 3 times a week. Highly recommended!",1199923200,4,595,4.321428571428571
1890548,5,B00009V7PY,"It should have been called 15 Minute Strength Training Workouts for Dummies. I really thought this was going to be more of a series of cardio, heart-rate raising exercises. However, as an at home weight-lifting/strength training plan, I think it's excellent.

The instructor is good at explaining the moves and not irritating, and, while there are a lot of basic moves that you'd expect like squats and lunges, there is also enough variety and different movements that it has kept my interest.

All in all, this is a great supplement to a cardio routine.",1194912000,2,554,4.882978723404255
1890549,5,B00009V7PY,"I love this DVD.  I consider myself to have very high standards for workouts and DVDs and very few get the cut in a high rating.  This DVD is challenging enough for a person who has been working out for years, yet simple enough for someone who is just starting out.  Here are my thoughts on the positives:
*One of the great things about this DVD is that you don't get bored.  Gay will combine 2 or 3 exercises into one which makes the workout quicker and you get less bored.  (Ex, combining front raises with lateral raises.)
*You get just enough of a rest in between certain reps to allow you to do more.  For example, on the squats, you do 2 in a row, shuffle to the left or right and do 2 more.  This way you get a 1 or 2 second rest and are able to do considerably more squats than you could alone.
*She only has you do 10-15 of each exercise.  This is great because, especially on the ab workout, it is completely do-able. You know ahead of time you only have to do 10 so it makes it so much easier to do all ten vs. a trainer who has you do 20 or 25 of an exercise.
*The ab workout is amazingly challenging yet completely do-able.  I have never been able to do a complete ab workout with any DVD.  I have always needed to rest; yet on this DVD, I could do the entire thing. I felt completely challenged.
*The ab moves are totally new.  Half of them I have never heard or seen, which actually made them FUN!  I actually look forward to some of the ab moves!

There are a few negatives that pop into my head for this DVD.
*The leg workout does not include anything but the thighs.  No hamstrings or calves.
*The warm up is incredibly hard to follow.  I skip over it and warm up on my own for 10 minutes before jumping in.
*There is no cool down whatsoever.  After each mini workout, Gay has you stretch for about 30 seconds.  After working that hard, it would be such a reward to get to spend 5 minutes cooling down and relaxing.
*While the pop ups are incredibly cheesy and annoying, they also provide a nice distraction, so I would consider them a neutral point.

I could go on for several more points, but the basic sum up is this is a great DVD.  A beginner could for sure do this workout, just with very light weights, and an oldie could easily get challenged and continue to get challenged.  While it does have a few flaws, these are easily overlooked and do not in anyway take away from the positives.",1192147200,4,2412,4.146236559139785
1890550,4,B00009V7PY,"I like the breakup of lower, upper & ab workout.  I really like Gay Gasper. She's no nonsense and gets it going.  Some of the moves are geared to the more intermediate person.  I know they show basic moves but it doesn't appear until she's gotten started and could turn a novice off.",1184716800,,283,4.30188679245283
1890551,5,B00009V7PY,"I bought this workout to make my son exercise but found it very useful for me as well. The exercises are very simple and clear - so it is intended for dummies. However, I am an exercise freak and found it that works for me too - the best thing is to keep it simple and this DVD does just that.

So, if you find yourself  you have no time for going to the gym or the gym is too expensive - this tape might be the solution.

I love the instructor - she is upbeat and fun without being fake.  You can tell she's having fun.  She is very experienced so you really can trust what she's saying, and she gives very helpful tips on technique so you know if you're doing it right or not.  I'm surprised at the other reviews because I found her warmups to be very well-explained and simple to follow.  I like that she moves fast because it keeps me pumped.  The music is fun and upbeat, and the workouts go by so fast and you really feel the burn afterwards!  I have gotten a lot of satisfaction out of this video, as well as her ""Fat Burning Workouts for Dummies"" video, which I recently bought.  She is the first instructor on tape that I really like.  Plus, it shows how to adjust the intensity level to whatever works for you.  I started with 2 and 3 pound weights, and now i'm using 5 pound weights for all the arms exercises.  I look forward to my time with these workouts, and they're so short that i can do two right before i go to work each morning.  Definitely a great pick in my opinion!!!",1159747200,7,1218,4.131914893617021

I have been fairly fit for most of my life but have gotten rather sedentary in recent years.  Just started a walk/run routine and want to do something to help maintain my weight and tone the fat into muscles.

The routines do take a few times to get down but if you stick with it, you can pick them up and begin to see immediate results.

I hadn't been exercising for quite some time.  25 years ago, I did dancergenics; 18 years ago, I worked out at a gym.  Since then?  Eh.  Some walking, maybe.  So, to get started, 15-minute workouts were just what I needed.  I could manage to make myself do a mere 15-minute routine.  The exercises are just challenging enough without being impossible or injury-inducing.  Before long, I found to my amazement that 15 minutes wasn't enough -- I actually wanted to do more.  Imagine!  And after only two weeks of doing two routines (30 minutes a day), family & friends started commenting on the difference in the way I looked.  True, it can take some time to be able to follow her warm-up routines, but if you could do it all right away, it would be time to move on to a more advanced DVD.

She keeps adding steps without a whole lot of explanation and making it look easy, which seems a bit baffling considering that she's talking to a bunch of people who think they are ""dummies"" at fitness!

The ab exercises were WAY too hard! I couldn't even make it halfway through that section. She does give ""basic"" modifications for some exercises, but even the basics were too hard for me.

To be fair, I think this program is probably pretty good--and I will keep working on it as I progress in my weight loss program--but if you are are a true sedentary beginner and looking for something to get you started, you might want to try something else first.",1122768000,30,779,4.47887323943662

So, I modify and once she tosses in more steps than I can manage I just do the first couple she teaches repeatedly until she is done with the warm up.

The work out portions are much easier to follow and I like the 15 minute time frame-- that is indeed my favorite part. I just remind myself that even I can make it for 15 minutes...

Suggestions for modifications are also provided if you require more of a challenge. I've had this DVD for a year and I still use it several times a week. It's a video that I have been able to grow with, simply by incorporating the modifications and using heavier weights to keep myself challenged.

1890562,5,B00009V7PY,"""Common don't quit!"" ~Gay Gasper

Gay Gasper is an internationally known fitness presenter who loves exercise and has been teaching for over 19 years. She has appeared in 27 fitness workouts and has a high-energy style. Each movement has a purpose and she doesn't waste anytime between exercises. This is why I'm going to say this might be intermediate. If you have been exercising for a few months, and are familiar with the use of dumbbells then you might be ready for this workout.

Some favorite features:

15-minute Workouts for Abs, Arms, Buns and Thighs
The countdown clock - motivation to keep going to the last minute

Aerobic sections between the weight lifting - This makes the workout feel like an interval training style workout. If you do all the exercises one after the other.

Challenging modifications for advanced users - you can add weights at some point.
Icons - Jargon alert, Myth Buster, Tips, Beware and Remember Icon.

If you are looking for a nice challenge, you can do all the 15-minute workouts and make your way through all 26 toning and shaping exercises. If you want to take exercise breaks throughout the day or just want to spend 15 minutes each day - that is also an option.

The tips were interesting and Gay gives advice like using a sponge mop for balance.

The music is highly motivating, the set is uncluttered and Gay's personality and voice are pleasant and inspirational. She also uses humor throughout the exercises. Her professional attitude towards exercise makes you feel confident and you can really trust her advice.

What will you need?

A space large enough to do lunges
Two sets of weights.

You could use 3-5 lb weights or even start with smaller weights and in a few weeks you will notice you are ready to move onto heavier weights. 3lb weights sounded right to me, but they say you can use two eight-pound dumbbells. It is better to work slowly into using weights and see gradual results. I started with one-pound weights and in about 30 weeks I was up to using 3-5lb weights. I no longer believe that faster is better. If it takes you 30 weeks to get to a point where you are really proud of yourself and you are keeping with an exercise program, then that beats a quick fix any day.

15-Minute Workouts for Dummies might even become a staple in your exercise video collection. I loved it and will keep doing this workout because it is highly motivational and the exercises are very effective. You are increasing muscle that eventually helps you to burn more calories each day. If I am ever having trouble feeling motivated to exercise, I just put this video in the VCR and within minutes I'm in the mood to burn some calories.

I got it from the limited selection at the library and used it while on vacation. Despite having done Jillian Michaels, Bob Harper, T25 and P90X recently, I could not keep pace with her and often couldn't figure out what she was telling me to do.

I imagine this is meant to help start people working out, as it's in 15 minute increments, but this was confusing and would definitely NOT make me feel empowered to exercise regularly.",1421625600,,477,4.546511627906977
