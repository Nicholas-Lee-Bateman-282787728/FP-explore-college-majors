675255,5,630354195X,"Set in 1348 in Cumbria in North West England during the plague this is an outstanding tale.
There are many reasons why the film is outstanding, the mix of black and white and colour photography is beautifully balanced, even to the extent of mixing within individual scenes,this all adds to the mythical qualities of the story. The desolate snow swept landscape of Cumbria (New Zealand doubles up for Cumbria)are stunning and the perfomance by Hamish McFarlane as the visionary boy is suberb.
It is partly about time travel, the boy with a small group of his fellow villages go through a mine to find themselves in a modern day New Zealand city, that essentially is more barren than where they came from. They are in search of a miraculous church and their quest is to place an icon on top of the steeple. There are some nice gags but essentially the film is about the boy's vision. Did in fact the travel through time actually happen or was it part of the boy's spirituality.
Is in fact the film a subtle allegory that,without preaching, equates the plague with Aids and the barreness of the landscape and the villagers on the edge of not surviving, a post nuclear apocalyptic vision?  The film was made in 1988 when these possibilities dominated. Equally though, these possibilities are as relevant today.
A lyrical but disturbing fable.",1012521600,10,1338,4.767241379310345
675256,2,630354195X,"I have reviewed this film previously, and have waited for the DVD...alas, it is a big disappointment. No widescreen and no extras...in otherwords, a waste of time and money. Small, but important films such as this are poorly served by production companies who serve up a barely adequate product. This is a very good film, but the DVD is a dud. Buy the VHS in protest!",985305600,21,367,4.575757575757576
675257,3,630354195X,"The film is really wonderful as the others wrote. But this DVD is really disappointing. It doesn't have any supplement like a director's commentary. It doesn't have any subtitles. (I'm not from a English speaking country and it was really hard to understand the old English accent.) Moreover, it's not widescreen.
4 stars for the film, no star for this DVD. Really disappointing.",985132800,2,379,5.031746031746032
675258,5,630354195X,"Deep, resonating messages and stunning, haunting visuals contribute to the power of this film which is so completely independent of any genre that calling it a sci-fi or a fantasy does not seem to do it justice; rather, such stereotyping is more of an insult. The best eye-candy in this film is  its shoestring-budget special effects (read: no REAL special effects) and  its cinematography (it was directed by the same guy who did ""What  Dreams May Come,"" which is a poor modern cousin full of hypocrisy).
At any rate, The Navigator is real and raw. And a classic. It reminds me  of the Dutch film version of MEDEA. It's fascinating the same way AKIRA  might be fascinating: you simply cannot believe that such a fantastic story  can work in such a simple narrative. The filmmakers of Navigator trust  their audience to be receptive of that which is truly bizarre.
Not for  the shallow of heart! I've read other reviews of this film and must agree  with one in particular: if you feel intellectually stimulated by  Independence Day or Armageddon or other such mindless fluff (even the  Matrix), you will get nothing from this film....
Other  films that remind me of the Navigator: The original Highlander movie  (especially the low-res, poor-quality version on Beta Hi-Fi), Ladyhawke,  Eraserhead, In the Name of the Rose (that weird monk movie with Sean  Connery and Christian Slater), Medea (the scratchy Dutch version), and even  Monty Python and the Holy Grail (not so much for the humor, but the general  film presence).
Enjoy!  But not too much.",960768000,20,1551,4.8773946360153255
675259,4,630354195X,"The Navigator is a great movie, although the plot seems cloudy at times and the movie too short. After watching it I was left wanting more. I would definately like to see a higher-budget remake of The Navigator: A Medieval  Odessy. The idea of pious medieval peasants really time traveling to the  modern day makes for a story of adventure and fantasy. One full of human  moments and perhaps even a little humor. How will modern day priests react  to these pilgrams? and their story? These are just a few things I was left  wanting to see. I recommand renting this movie first. Then decide for  yourself if its worth owning.",954633600,5,624,4.576576576576577
675260,5,630354195X,"This is definately one of the best movies I have ever seen. The actors do wonderful jobs of portraying the emotions felt by their characters, and the sense of hopelessness and helplessness that must have been felt during a  medievil plague! The black and white shots were visually stunning, and the  music is almost celtic... ancient-sounding, poignant and lilting. This  movie made my heart feel crampy with wist for some long-lost time of  inherent fantasy and myth. This is truly one of those gems-in-the-roughs,  as far as movies are concerned. It is more a piece of moving modern art  than a slap-stick Hollywood movie, however, and is lacking many of the  guady and visually stressing noise-makers and whirly-gogs that so many  directors like to thrown in their scenes, for the sheer hell of  them.
Rent this movie before you buy it, though. It is sort of an aquired  taste. It may be slow-moving like a snail for some people, but it delighted  me!",948240000,8,954,4.791411042944786
675261,4,630354195X,"vincent ward upped the ante for the follow up to his masterpiece ""vigil"" and pulls it off-almost! again the visuals are exceptional, and the story,(by ward), a remarkable fantasy. this one needs  to be on dvd- with a director's commentary. ward seems to be determined to  break the visual bounds of what is possible in a film like this, and just  about succeeds.style over substance intrudes periodically, and that's why i  don't give it a gold medal-but if only we had such style!!see this movie  and be awed!",921110400,4,510,4.75
675262,5,630354195X,"About five years ago, a former roomate rented this film one night.  Having nothing better to do, I decided to watch it with him.  Needless to say, this movie appealed to both my sense of fantasy and the medieval.  The  visuals were stunning, the actors were absolutely wonderful getting even  the accents of the time correct.  But what struck me the most was the  soundtrack for the movie. As for the movie, if you haven't seen it,  do so NOW.  It will be time well spent.",912729600,5,472,4.395348837209302
675536,5,630354195X,"I saw this movie for the first time about ten years ago, and was absolutely impressed on every level. The acting done is fantastic, and far beyond what you would expect from such a small budget. The directing leaves you with memorable scenes and the point is clearly made, big money does not equal big talent. Do not let this movie pass you by! This version is NTSC and will play on any US dvd player. It is the official Brazilian release, very good quality and has a fair price. Don't get fooled by the other guy who thinks that anything that is made in a foreign country is bad by definition.",1184630400,3,594,4.3125
675537,1,630354195X,"The only official version of ""The Navigator: Medieval Odyssey"" ever made for Region 1 (NTSC) was the Hen's Tooth DVD, retitled ""The Navigator: A Time Travel Adventure"", and that's out-of-print. An Australian company, AV Channel, released the only official PAL version.

(The 1-star rating is for this dubious DVD release; the movie itself is a 4-star.)",1179446400,5,352,5.285714285714286
675538,3,630354195X,"The USA release of this DVD costs upwards of $100.00... So this version is a suitable alternative... although the image quality is not the best... it's well worth the price.

This is the story of a boy in small village surrounded by the black plague... he has a vision that the villagers should tunnel through the earth to escape the plague... which they do... and emerge on the other side of the globe... in 20th century New Zealand...

beautifully shot...",1178496000,3,457,4.7
675539,1,630354195X,"I can appreciate a film that is more art than entertainment.  Heck, I have watched ""Citizen Kane"" multiple times, which alone ought to qualify me for a medal.  But this movie was painful to watch.  I kept waiting, hoping, praying for it to get better with the thought: ""No movie can really be this bad..."" constantly running through my mind.  Sadly, I was mistaken.  This film was officially placed on my ""Top Ten Worst Films"" list.

I might someday purchase a used version to give as an excellent gag gift however...",1165795200,,517,4.626373626373627
675540,3,630354195X,"Vincent Ward is one of those directors who make films that are easier to admire than to enjoy. The Navigator: A Medieval Odyssey is an excellent example - striking visuals, harsh landscapes, painful accents that make key plot points incomprehensible and a big idea that doesn't work quite as well as you'd like it to. Kicking off in a harsh black and white Cumbria in the early 14th century, an isolated village is persuaded by a boy's visions that the only way to keep the plague out of their village is to tunnel to the other side of the world and erect a cross on the great church tower before dawn - only to find themselves in God's city (or New Zealand circa 1988 to us), a world of colour and lights crippled by its own plagues, redundancy, nuclear proliferation and AIDS. Blinded by television and information overload, the boy loses his ability to see beyond the knowledge that one of them will die in the attempt... There are a lot of pluses, not least the great faces in the cast, many of which look like they've literally stepped out of a Renaissance painting, but it never really engages as much as you'd like, leaving you an almost disinterested observer.

The Australian DVD is much better than the shoddy NTSC release, boasting a superb anamorphic widescreen transfer, trailer and trailers for Ward's Vigil and What Dreams May Come.",1150588800,,1347,4.659663865546219
675541,5,630354195X,"The premise was so intriguing, of course I rented it. And it became an instant favorite. All these years later it's in my top 5. I bought the dvd soon's I could. (Considering what a dvd copy seems to be fetching these days I wish I'd bought 5 or 6. Oh well.) Whatever in the plot seems like it just couldn't be, never mind, just go with it. It's a time-travel adventure not by machine but rather in the mind of a child, and all the how-come will resolve quite naturally. It's a beautiful uplifting (and heartbreaking) story. It's a whole-family film like no other.",1120867200,4,564,4.380952380952381
675542,3,630354195X,"I purchased this disc in May 2004.
I has a VHS copy -taken from  pay TV. While the DVD was a bit  cleare/less grainy ,the video was 1.33:1 ,not 1.85:1 as advertised;also  the sound was MONO ,not Dolby Surround as advertised. A good film but a technically inferior disc.

675543,5,630354195X,"""The Navigator"" is a film that truly explores the depths of the human mind and the heros that keep our existance in tact without us recognizing them.

675544,5,630354195X,"As a PhD student in medieval history, I usually approach films set in the Middle Ages with no small sense of trepidation. The Navigator: A Mediaeval Odyssey is the exception. It is a visually stunning, well-written well-acted little film that manages to be both thought-provoking and entertaining. What I found particularly worthy of note is Vincent Ward's use of imagery. His choice to film the medieval scenes in mid-winter and in black and white conveys the bleakness of medieval peasant life and the muted colours of the modern scenes have a mystical feel to them. The film actually feels medieval, and since it does not refer to an historical event more specific than the Black Death, there's no opportunity to get annoyed with historical inaccuracy (a curse of all we would-be professional historians!) I recommend it highly to anyone who likes fantasy and adventure.",1039046400,33,873,5.069444444444445
675545,4,630354195X,"I rented this film at the local Video Store in the most casual manner: by scanning the box art for a clue to something different, knowing nothing of the movie or its creators. It turned out to be the most haunting cinema experience I have ever had. Images from the film have never left me. A modern city is magically transformed and redefined through the eyes and spirits of people from another time.  The  quest for protection by a higher power highlights a universal need.  This is a wonderful film.",1026691200,8,501,4.544444444444444

7849681,2,630354195X,"This review is not about the film but the DVD itself. The film is great and worth having in whatever format you can get... let's move on. If you're looking for the original release of this film it will be on Hen's Tooth Video. There are numerous non-legit copies, some PAL versions, and some Australian versions on a different region format (I think it's Region 4) but Hen's Tooth was the only company that released an official legitimate US/Canadian version on NTSC (but it seems to be all-region).

Now, if you're looking for the proper Hen's Tooth release then you've gotten used to the big price tags attached to the deleted DVD. There's probably good reason why this is deleted - apart from Hen's Tooth no longer existing - and also some reason to avoid this copy. While the film is fantastic and worth desiring it turns out the Hen's Tooth version is a terrible print. It's so bad that you'll be surprised it was digitized to DVD format at all. It actually looks like the print was lifted from a 2nd generation VHS - no exaggeration, it really looks like a bad analog print. If you want to own the film (and who wouldn't really?) then consider looking for a better VHS version or settle for the various cheaper non-region versions that exist out there. The prints are just as bad or only slightly worse but this Hen's Tooth version isn't worth any big bucks.

This film is a minor classic which was well received and well reviewed at the time of it's release in the late 80s. It also won a bunch of Australian film awards so it's not like it should live a life of being shelved like a lost ""cult classic"". It's a real shame there hasn't been proper print in so many years. Perhaps someday some company like Criterion or Zeitgeist will make the effort to restore the film to a worthy digital print. There's enough cinematography and visual ambience in the film to warrant a better treatment. Here's hoping. Until then we have to live with the substandard videos but take my advice and don't invest in the ridiculously gouging prices of the secondary market for the Hen's Tooth version.",1274313600,4,2090,4.555851063829787
