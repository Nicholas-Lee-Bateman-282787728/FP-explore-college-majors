5927572,5,B00ELQHV42,"Great movie. It scared me because sex-trafficking is a very real problem in Eastern Europe, as well as other countries. According to U.S. estimates, 4 million people find themselves modern day slaves each year--especially in the post-Soviet war torn Balkans. People don't like to think about this sort of thing, so it's often presented in a way that makes it forgettable. This movie is different in that it dares to go into real life human horrors. Face your fears of what humanity can be like and watch it.",1386892800,28,507,4.7727272727272725
5927573,4,B00ELQHV42,"this actually turned out to be a good movie, its about human trafficking in war time, and other then that I won't give any spoilers, but I will say I sat through it and found it to be worth the rental, Rosie Day did an amazing job playing Angel.",1386806400,15,245,4.020408163265306
5927574,5,B00ELQHV42,"This is a bold and shocking movie filled with brutal rape and violence towards young girls so not everyone's type of movie, despite being horrible in content it is a very well made film and amazing to watch, the story is about girls who are snatched and taken to a remote house where they are drugged and prostituted to military men, one of the young girls who works for the man in charge is mute and branded with a facial birthmark making her unusable so she looks after the house as a prisoner, then one day she finds her moment to fight back and get revenge on them all for what they have done, then the movie gets real bloody, there is some brutal gore scenes in places, the cast is amazing the lead girl Rosie Day is fantastic, and Sean Pertwee is brilliant as always playing a badass soldier who's a bit of an evil man, overall this is a little gem and for a small budget film its well worth the money if the subject matter doesn't put you off, great picture quality and has features, commentary and behind the scenes.",1382313600,5,1024,4.310880829015544
5927575,4,B00ELQHV42,"The aftermath of an Eastern European war is that young girls are forced into prostitution. Angel (Rosie Day) is a young mute girl who is taken to such a place. Viktor (Kevin Howarth) who runs the place has taken a liking toward her and has her in charge of shooting up the other girls. She befriends one of the girls who knows sign language.

The soldiers who come there are mean and cruel. Angel, makes Fiona Apple look obese, as she crawls through air vents like my cats do when I yell at them for changing the channel. The first half of the film is slow establishing the characters and scenario.

This is not the exploitation film one expects from the cover and title. I enjoyed the dark irony of the ending which was worth the wait.

Worth a view if you liked ""The Whistleblower"".

5927576,3,B00ELQHV42,"Good movie, but couldn't give it a higher rating because the dvd was moving around inside and the box was damaged!!",1455840000,,115,4.523809523809524
5927577,5,B00ELQHV42,"I will start off my review by saying that I have seen some of the most disturbing films ever created those of which being ""The Human Centipede"", ""Martyrs"", ""A Serbian Film"" twice, ""I Spit on Your Grave"" and ""Hostel"" along with many others so I'm very calloused when it comes to not flinching when watching Graphic Content but this movie hit my core like a punch from Saitama. I will now start with the story which is about a girl named Angel who is a deaf mute who is forced to work in a prostitution house in the Balkans of the late 1990's. The story progresses when she meets the soldiers that killed her family at the house and fyi that isn't a spoiler that is in the base synopsis of the movie. I will now head to the acting department which was cast Superbly seeing as I didn't know anybody outside of ""Sean Pertwee"" whom I love as an actor. The main protagonist Angel who is played by ""Rosie Day"" was Absolutely Amazing in her role and everyone else did a tremendously great job. I will move onto the action which is hard to define so I will combine but action with psychological aspects. I mean the action scenes are among some of the most grueling and painful to watch scenes I have seen for an extremely long time and very bloody. I will now go into the psychological aspects of this movie. I mean I had a hard time watching this film and as I mentioned prior I have seen a ton of stuff. I mean the subject matter and what it portrays on the screen is harsh,grim,cruel,heartless and incessant the whole time. I literally had to force myself to watch it until the end. I wanted to go through the screen and kill these sick individuals myself. The location was shot very well in a disused Air Force Base doubling as a brothel house so it mainly stuck to the one house the entire movie. I will close by saying this is Paul Hyett's second movie I have seen but his first movie made because I watched ""Howl"" the other night and it was Incredible. I will finish with this and that is that this movie is gut-wrenching to watch and will more then likely make you feel there is no longer any hope for civilization if you haven't already lost that but this is a Must-Watch movie that will question everything you hold dear considering this still happens in today's society all around the world. I'm honestly at a loss for words but just prepare yourselves for one of the the most unsympathetic and barbarous films you will ever watch and have a wonderful day.",1453161600,,2458,4.357298474945534

The movie revolves around a brothel made up of imprisoned girls during wartime. A deaf mute girl that has more freedom than the other girls sees the one girl she cares about being viciously attacked by a soldier and decides to stop it, by sneaking in through one of the vents she travels through and killing him.

From here it becomes a cat and mouse game of revenge and survival. There are some very graphic scenes of violence and some gore. I found it to be very entertaining and intense. I think people will be surprised at how good the production value is.

5927606,3,B00ELQHV42,"This movie is sad. It's the type of horror that makes you feel all kinds of emotions and sadness for the characters, which is not really my thing - but I can still appreciate a good movie. I thought The Seasoning House had a great story that felt very realistic, which made it even scarier. You know this stuff happens in various places around the world, this torture and abuse by the hands of human beings around us, and that's the kind of ""horror"" this movie is. I'm more of an 80's-slasher kind of girl, so the rapes and broken bones and torture in The Seasoning House was just a little much for me, but it definitely makes you feel something deep within. That's worthy of 3 stars in my book. The ending left me even more sad, still rooting for that ""Final Girl"" to continue surviving.

5927621,3,B00ELQHV42,"The Seasoning House (Paul Hyett, 2012)

From everything I had heard about it, The Seasoning House was not at all what I was expecting it to be; while I would not call it a great film by any means, I believe that those who are dismissing it as just another torture porn film are giving it short shrift that it doesn't deserve. In the seventies, it would have been considered a revenge thriller, and it certainly has more in common with I Spit on Your Grave than it does Train or Grotesque. For example, it actually has a plot.

Angel (Sixteen's Rosie Day) is a mute girl who has been kidnapped with a number of other girls and taken to the Seasoning House, which seems to be a kind of Serbian version of the Comfort House from World War II-era Japan. Dimitri (Blood and Bone China's David Lemberg), chief pimp in residence, takes a shine to Angel and keeps her apart from the prostitutes, instead giving her a job cleaning the place and preparing the girls. She is pragmatic enough to know she's not getting out, so she resigns herself to her fate until two things happen in quick succession: first, a new shipment of girls contains Vanya (Britannia High's Dominique Provost-Chalkley in her first feature appearance), who knows sign language and thus can communicate with Angel better than anyone else in the house, and second, the band of mercenaries who killed Angel's mother and kidnapped her, led by the sadistic Goran (Event Horizon's Sean Pertwee), stop over for a bit of R&R. Suddenly, Angel finds herself both with something to fight for and an opportunity for revenge...

The first half of the moviethe setup for the big Revenge Thriller set piece that comprises the second half (no, you shouldn't be thinking 13 Assassins here, as amusing as the idea is)is actually really impressive. Hyett, who co-wrote, takes the time to set up his characters and the often-fragile dynamics between them, at least his main characters. Then comes the second half of the movie, and I can think of at least a half-dozen things to compare it to...all of which do it better. I saw one wag on the IMDB message board say that the second half was like an adult version of Home Alone, and s/he's not too far wrong; my thinking was a blocky, pixellated Boarding Gate. In other words, thought in the first half and action without thought in the second, and the end result is that it's a pretty tough sell for both cerebral thriller fans and action fans because of the abrupt shift in tone. But whichever half of the movie you find appealing, that half of it should make the other half at least bearable for you. The easily-triggered should be warned that the movie contains a few scenes of violent sexual abuse. ** ",1400457600,,2699,4.616666666666666

You can't help but root for her survival when you see the conditions that she's trapped in. It could understandably make the toughest (sane) person give up. The plot, setting, events, costuming, cinematography and music all contribute to creating a cohesive script with nothing that should have been left out. This human horror was well written and superbly directed.

From the first, Paul Hyett, the director made me care about and feel compassion for the main character and what was happening to her. This was all done without creating or turning her into a victim. I loathed her conditions and the experiences that she was forced to endure, but her spirit was something to see.

As far as villains, Goran (Sean Pertwee) and Viktor (Kevin Howarth) are a girl's worst nightmare!

5927632,3,B00ELQHV42,"I hadn't heard of this film until recently. I read others commenting on the film's violence and brutality, so I was immediately interested. I can say that I was definitely surprised on how good this movie actually was, especially since it is a fairly unknown, lower budget production. The plot is pretty simple. An enslaved deaf and mute girl, called Angel, is given the role of ""caretaker"" to a house full of sex slaves, who are prostituted to the military. She befriends one of the girls there, which eventually leads to her revenge and escape from her ""employers"". I will admit, the first half or so of the film, can be a little slow. And the whole film is dark and bleak from start to finish. The last 30 minutes or so, the film picks up the pace. And when the film picks its moments to be brutal, it is just that, brutal. The special effects were great, which was a big surprise to me. The ending I thought was just so-so. I thought it was just a little too ironic how unlucky the main protagonist was, in that that she seems to running into 'bad' people that were somehow connected to the very same people she was trying to get away from. But even with that being said, I was still impressed with this one overall. The acting, production, and story (though simple) were all good. But the violence/special effects were really the strong point and the most effective part of the film to me. I recommend this one if you're interested in revenge-type of films. It's not on the same level of brutality or violence as a ""I Spit on Your Grave"", but it does pack a bit of a punch.",1394236800,10,1578,4.389078498293515

The movie starts which the girls being taken and brought to the house but it doesn't say where they are or who the soldiers are...also for it to be a profitable prostitution place, there are not a lot of customers nor a lot of bouncers.

5927638,5,B00ELQHV42,I am normally a horror movie buff but this movie caught and kept my attention. It is sad as I contemplate that this is the true situation of many children.  Maybe if many watched and developed a heart then child and women sex trade would become obsolete.,1391299200,,254,4.404255319148936

5927641,4,B00ELQHV42,Great movie. Intense and well made with an outstanding performance from the lead actress. Walks the line between exploitation and intense film making perfectly.,1390867200,,160,5.708333333333333
5927642,3,B00ELQHV42,It had a good storyline. I didn't like how gruesome it was though. The acting was good also and overall it was entertaining.,1390867200,,124,4.434782608695652
5927643,5,B00ELQHV42,"Most of us, if not all, are aware of the women forced into prostitution and used in violent ways we can't even imagine. This movie had me in tears, and even fury and the savage way they were used for some beast's sexual desires.  At more than one point of the film, I was going to stop the movie and delete it, but I kept on, until the end that gave me some hope for just one young woman. This type of savagery may continue forever. It is prevalent in many countries, and I suppose the authorities ignore most of it. Be warned that this movie is incredibly savage, and yet, so important",1390262400,2,586,4.185840707964601
5927644,1,B00ELQHV42,Skip it. This is not a creepy horror movie or even a thrilling vengeance movie. It's a sad movie about abused and tortured little girls. I  found it thoroughly depressing.,1390262400,4,171,4.7

5927648,5,B00ELQHV42,This brutal plot about kidnapping and rape  is very well done. Girls are prostituted out to a group of military men who are animalistic in every sense of the word and one little girl proves to be skilled in survival. See it ! Very well acted .

5927650,4,B00ELQHV42,"Now, I read another review that said,"" very disturbing"" that is very much the truth. This movie highlights the error of high trafficking of young girls; the brutal beating, rape, exploitation and killing. The movie had some very good actors and the story is believable. I would watch this movie again . The main character did a wonderful job playing the deaf girl; I might mention.",1388880000,9,381,4.787878787878788

5927652,5,B00ELQHV42,"I watch so many movies, can't keep count. When I started watching this one, I thought it is going to be good, I could tell. There were some bloody scenes, and some pretty nasty, cold, beat up building in the UK some place, I think. I hope men were not like this during any of the wars or during any time.  Just filthy & wrong. Talk about spreading diseases, poor, poor, poor young girls/young women.  I was on the edge of my seat, biting what was left of my nubby finger nails, and thinking, please let these disgusting, abusive, men get paid back in a bad way for the  abuse, beatings, and humility they caused these poor girls/young women. And without saying too much. I LOVED IT. Well done. The ending was a trip too.",1388361600,4,720,4.318518518518519

5927654,4,B00ELQHV42,"I had no previous knowledge of this film before watching it, so I was not prepared at how incredibly visceral the movie ultimately was. I have seen many movies on the horrors of brothels and sex slaves, but I was taken aback at how terrifying some of these places could be. Whomever was responsible for such a convincing cast and location, as well as special effects that actually made me cringe, such be commended. This film will leave you shaken, disturbed, and wanting to know more about what girls like this have gone through. It makes for great entertainment, but also leaves you thinking about the film for days after you have watched it.",1387756800,30,644,4.657894736842105

8606729,4,B00ELQHV42,"This movie is surprisingly good but you don't hear much about it, which is sad. It used to be on Netflix and I had never heard of it but I watched it (since Netflix generally sucks after you finish all the tv shows you're interested in) and really liked it. This makes the second copy I've bought since I left my first copy at an old friend's house. If I bought it twice, you should at least give it a chance and buy it once. Some parts may be hard to watch if you're sensitive to abuse, but if you're here because you're a horror fanatic, you've definitely seen worse.",1513987200,2,569,4.181818181818182

8606736,5,B00ELQHV42,"If you have a weak heart skip this one.
If you expect something sexual with a lot of nudity, skip this one since this movie has no nudity. The director avoids to show woman's naked body and only shows the man's even during rape shots to avoid to make the audience enjoy the moment and rather make them painful to watch the moment feel what the woman feel.

This movie is a big surprise horror thriller movie happening in somewhere in Balkan area.
People are kidnapping women and rope them, dope them and make them prostitute. They are nothing but a piece of property for them. If they die they just dump them.
Most of the customers not just have sex but brutally punch the woman and enjoy the pleasure of violence.
So the girls are becomeing in a really bad condition. They are not even able to eat properly.
They are living deads.

Now there is this girl who happens that this guy loves and she was lucky enough not to become one of the woman.
She happens to be able to work as a cleaning lady, who does all the injections, cleaning, cooking. She knows how to travel through this tunnel some kind of an air hole which is connected to each room since she is thin and all.
And plus she is a mute and happens to meet this girl who can do hand talk. She becomes friends with her.
But she got sick and she wants to help her. But she coudn't.
When the deaf girl witnesses another brutal rape of this customer she cannot help and happens to kill the guy.
Then the whole fight begins.
She has to kill all of them or else she will die.
The customer is a bunch of soldiers since it is a war era and they are enjoying here.
They are trying to kill this deaf girl for revenge of their colleague.
The fight is against the deaf girl and the soldiers plus the owner of this house.

This is a hell of a scary gory movie that all the horror fan will die for.
And the great ending too.",1469059200,2,1868,4.154696132596685
