2620642,5,B000GYHRHE,"This documentary will enrage people who care about democracy, or lack thereof, in the USA. It does a good job of showing how there is still widespread discrimination in the electoral process. It also shows how the mainstream media tries to subvert any meaningful discussion of the topic. Rep. McKinney is one of the few members of Congress who has consistently attempted to have a thorough investigation of the way elections are carried out in the this country. This is not a partisan issue in any way to her. It is a human rights issue and an American issue. Even her own party has abandoned her on many occasions.

The documentary traces her political career up until her defeat this past election. The wonderful thing about it is that it is not so much a biography of Rep. McKinney, but also an investigation as to the problems with the election system. There are some enlightening bits about the way the media distorts and censors people who speak out against unchecked power.

The extras are interesting because they delve into her mishap with Capitol Hill Police and show segments deleted from the final film. There is an interview with four Capitol Hill Policemen who discuss the racism inherent in the department, and gives added perspective on the incident involving Rep. McKinney. The deleted scenes address such topics as AIPAC and the way the media covers politics and war. There are also some other extras that add value to the package.

Anyone who wants to get to know what makes Rep. McKinney tick should watch this film. She is not a loon or traitor, as her critics try to portray her, rather she is an American citizen who wants to see the system become stronger so that it can better serve all Americans.",1166832000,4,1722,4.714285714285714
2620643,5,B000GYHRHE,"When you hear the name ""Cynthia McKinney,"" it probably draws images of madness and lunacy. Why wouldn't it? After all, ever since she was elected to the Georgia state legislature, the media and moneyed forces across America have spent their time slandering her with every accusation possible. They don't want a woman who asks too many questions, who demands too often to stand by the downtrodden and oppressed. That's just dangerous.

This film explores the life and career of the Congresswoman as well as the voter suppression in 2000 and 2004. Congressman John Lewis is interviewed, and explains the struggles he went through as an activist to get voting rights for ""colored"" people -- only to have them being systematically stolen again through computerized voting machines and, as the BBC's Greg Palast calls it, ""election apartheid.""

What kind of liberal democracy are we living in when thousands are turned away from the polls because their district's voting records are controlled by rich people far away? What kind of nation are we living in when simply questioning the President's motives get you casted as a lunatic ""conspiracy theorist"" (to be vindicated years later when leaked documents show you were right)?

We need to make this a country ""of the people, by the people, and for the people."" McKinney will continue that fight, even as a non-legislator (although as the movie shows, she is well-capable of winning back her seat once a dirty campaign and Republican votes unseat her once).

Watch the film, educate yourself, and join the fight. We need to save any ounce of American democracy left.",1158883200,40,1611,5.022471910112359
2620644,5,B000GYHRHE,"this is a very informative film on what the voting and political process in this country has become. from the parties themselves to the media and money influence behind them. the political practices shown in this film i myself unknowingly have been subjected to. a lot of these practices have been used in my community and without knowledge our votes are not counted and voices silenced. when a revolutionary voice for the people began to speak, canons come to bear from those in charge to silence and cover the truth. i hope ms mckinney continues her struggle to have the peoples voice heard. this film is a must see for all Americans, and a must have for all Black Americans. how loud is my voice if my vote is not heard.",1214179200,,723,4.526717557251908
2620645,4,B000GYHRHE,"Ian Inaba's American Blackout:The Lynching of Cynthia McKinney is a powerful film about the erosion of civil rights in America. The film follows former Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney on her search for the truth concerning the voting irregularities in both the Florida 2000 and Ohio 2004 elections.

McKinney is nothing if not controversial. She takes on the government, big corporations, and the media in order to get at what she believes is the truth. In this aspect her work needs to be applauded. The thesis that there is a concentrated effort to diminish Black and Latino votes is a relevant one which needs more discussion.

The film is a powerful one that makes its viewers think. The problem with a film of this type is that it is often not seen by a large segment of the population. This is a small film that is worth looking for. See it for yourself and encourage others to see it. Let the debate and discussion begin. It's time to end the blackout.",1211760000,4,958,4.662721893491124

2620647,5,B000GYHRHE,"I first saw this video in my black history class and it left me dumbfounded. Most of us knew of some fishy stuff went on in the 2000 and 2004 presidential election, but most of us didn't know it was to this extent. This dvd is a real eye-opener and I recommend it to everyone! Its not meant to enfuriate you (even though it will) but to educate you. Cynthia McKinney is amazing! She asked the tough questions and she wasn't afraid to do it. She went there. If you want the truth, get this dvd! And don't ever let anyone take your vote, your voice!",1202774400,,547,4.169811320754717
2620648,5,B000GYHRHE,"American Blackout is an incredibly enlightening documentary and it is very well made. What is so shockingly exposed is the rampant racism and outright criminality that pervades every aspect of the American Political system.

I don't feel this film is in any way insincere or short with the truth. It simply shows first hand the abuses that certain Americans face when they want to perform their inalienable rights.

This is not solely about race but rather epidemic corruption. The black electorate being deprived of their votes is simply one of the many tools by which the Bush administration can consolidate its power and wealth. Cynthia McKinney was not political lynched because she is black but rather because she questioned the Bush administration and their knowledge of the attacks on 9/11.

The fact that American blacks are constantly maligned and disenfranchised in modern America is appallingly obvious. The treatment of blacks in New Orleans being a perfect example. What is so striking is how little integration seems to have worked in America and how separatism is the given norm. Racism seems to have become an even greater problem than it has ever been before and part of the responsibility for this sorry state of affairs has to rest at the feet of the intolerant and insuppressible Bush administration.

I absolutely recommend this well-made documentary but I assume it has a small but enlightened audience.",1194048000,3,1425,5.103004291845494
2620649,5,B000GYHRHE,"Thousands of miles across the Pacific, Aussies have also felt the political consequences of the 2000 and 2004 US elections: Our Prime Minister is one of the staunchest allies of President Bush; we have committed troop to Iraq and have backed the US on Kyoto and other treaty issues. Nevertheless, it is reasonable to assume that watching from Down Under and being a couple of degrees removed from domestic US politics may have diminished my enjoyment of this wonderful documentary, but not so.  It is a powerful and brilliant exposure of one of the most insidious forms of political corruption - the racially inspired, debasement of the electoral process itself.  There are consequently lessons for all of us to learn from it.  There is also an excellent presentation of the courageous work of Cynthia McKinney, who is not well known here, but obviously deserving of high praise for her steadfast attachment to fundamental democratic principles. One of the best political documentaries I have seen in a long while.",1193184000,,1014,5.023809523809524
2620650,5,B000GYHRHE,"No scripts, no special effects, no big budget production.  American Blackout captures the events of the 2000 and 2004 elections.  It also documents the struggle in Washington, D.C. for a black congresswoman who is trying to serve the country that she loves.  The program documents the facts surrounding the fixed elections, the rest is (recent) history.

Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney was always a lightning rod for controversy.  She was the only person who had the courage to stand up for what is right, even though it was very unpopular at the time.  Years later we now know that McKinney was right from the very beginning.  The United States wouldn't be on the verge of collapsing if we had only listened to Cynthia McKinney.  Our education system has failed, our health care system is imploding, our government is corrupt at every level, we've let our veterans down, and we have lost the war in both Iraq and Afghanistan,  Where would we be today if we had not only listened, but stood up and demanded the truth like McKinney?

I'm proud to say that I was a Cynthia McKinney constituent and supporter.  American Blackout should be viewed by history buffs, and for anyone who is interested in knowing what REALLY happened.",1189123200,2,1226,4.846153846153846
2620651,5,B000GYHRHE,"What is the most positive message from this video is that when the Black, African American's vote as a block, they determine elections. That's clearly why they were denied the chance to vote in Ohio, and Florida. The story is also the political lynching that Representative McKinney got for speaking out against the Bush Administration. The twisting of her questions by FOX news and the wing nut bloggers.

Now of course that the information, who knew what and when did they know it about September 11th is clear to everybody. And of course instead of looking like a nut case conspiracy leader, Representative McKinney looks like a freedom fighter in the best sense of the word, a person who uphold the American Ideal of Freedom.

But don't take my word for it, watch the video and decide for yourself.

Then remember why you vote, then don't forget come next November.",1188172800,3,869,4.78
2620652,5,B000GYHRHE,"AMERICAN BLACKOUT is an extraordinary documentary that focuses on the election loss of 2002 of Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney (D. Ga.) and the regaining of her seat in 2004. In a larger context AMERICAN BLACKOUT is an expose of how Republican operatives conspired to steal the presidential elections of 2000 and 2004 by Black voter suppression and the theft of Black votes. In addition to Cynthia McKinney, also featured is Greg Palast, author of THE BEST DEMOCRACY MONEY CAN BUY.",1180483200,2,480,5.0886075949367084

2620655,5,B000GYHRHE,"Cynthia McKinney is - like so few of her fellow politicians - clear, frank, honest and uncomprimising.  She may rattle a few cages, upset some folks on the Hill, but America's children need to see people like her to realize that there is a way to buck the trend, to fight for yours and others rights and to do it selflessly.

Highly recommended.  I especially liked the clips of a grotesquely coiffered Tucker Carlsen repleat with bow-tie (soooo tacky...) pontificating about the 'outrageous' Cynner.  I often wonder if he ever had to take one for the team....",1174521600,5,560,4.742268041237113
2620656,5,B000GYHRHE,"The villians are smiling happily as they've disenfranchised the black voters while the Big Media Dumbed Down the citizenry. This has all been done for a very good cause: Big Business' bottom line profits, and WAR IS THEIR RACKET. More power to the crony capitalist, the big media, and the military industrial/congressional complex.  Congresswomen Cynthia McKinney took on the enemy of the American citizens. The price was either: go along and take the people for what she knew was a ride, OR FIGHT FOR OUR RIGHTS.
She questioned the Bush Regime's involvement in events that led to 9/11. A recent Zogby poll has over 40% of New Yorkers asking her same questions. Still no answear! The Republicans spent One Million Dollars investigating a blue dress & $3,000 on 9/11! They don't want the truth found!  The family members of 9/11 who tragically lost their loved ones WANT AN INVESTIGATION! WANT THE TRUTH!
Kathryn Harris and Blackwell fixed the elections and were REWARDED by the GOP!
Gore won in 2000. A USA GOVERNMENT COUP took place in Florida with the suppression of the black vote. It happenned again in 2004 with Ohio.
Good books on this are Greg Palast's Armed Madhouse & Mark Crispin's Fooled Again.
The Extras in this DVD are good including: Capitol Hill Police Officiers Speak Out On McKinney Incident.

2620661,5,B000GYHRHE,"This DVD is well worth obtaining.  Cynthia McKinney has been called all sorts of names and accused of being aggressive, abrasive and rude because she continually insists on representing her constituents and the American people in Congress (what a daring stance in the era of Corporate control of our government).  She won't bend over or back down to the corruption.  Cynthia McKinney tells her side; you see her in her home having hide behind curtains and locked doors due to death threats; bravely campaigning against an ocean of money for her opponents who 'toe the line', asking the questions of Rumsfeld we all would like to know and being set up by the police with a phony charge.  The police around the Congressional building are a real treat to watch as they continually pretend they do not recognize Cynthia (after years of being in Congress) as a sort of put down to her for her 'uppity-ness'.  She represents the American people, and refuses to 'shut up'.  This woman has an admirable amount of courage and it shows by how she lives her life and does her job.  If you want to watch a video showing determination, courage and stamina in the face of overwhelming odds, this is the one.  The opposition did it again in 2006, poured in money to her district to defeat her.  But she'll be back.  She is a hero, and deserves to be re-elected.  Maybe the senate next time?  Be a great improvement overe what is there now.",1167868800,5,1424,4.607142857142857

8135106,5,B000GYHRHE,"Cynthia McKinney is that special and rare politician who is not afraid to stand up against the status quo, she spoke out against the hijacking of the 2000 presidential election by former President Bush, she was the only one in Congress to call for an immediate investigation into the matter of 9/11, she also spoke out against the hijacking of the 2004 presidential election. This is why I am glad and proud of voting for Cynthia McKinney in the 2008 presidential election she ran under the Green Party ballot, that is right I did not vote for President Obama in 2008, I will again vote for Cynthia McKinney in the upcoming 2016 presidential election even if I have to write in her name.

Especially powerful was the evidence of the state of Ohio's alleged fraud against the citizens in Colombus.  After a slow beginning, the documentary ends on a powerful, emotional note.
