3853654,5,B0026IBRRO,"I'm reviewing this DVD based on its content, not the fact that its a subset of the complete season to be issued November 3rd, 2009.  The Season is a must buy, but that doesn't mean these DVD's aren't a great sampler for the casual fan or newbee.

The Clone Wars is the crowning achievement of the Star Wars franchise, at least as far as I'm concerned.  The stories are better, the acting is better, and the computer animation is simply amazing.  Be warned: there is plenty of violence, and most episodes are easily PG-13.

This set contains the Ryloth Trilogy, a war heavy set of stories. There's plenty of space clashes and ground battles - many featuring classic Star Wars vehicles. If you are looking to be astounded by great computer animation, this is a good place to start because the Star Wars folks perfected CGI for things like ships and weapons many many years ago.",1253059200,,875,4.583333333333333
3853655,1,B0026IBRRO,"I made the terrible mistake of buying ""A Galaxy Divided"", the first disc released for ""The Clone War"" TV series. The description did not tell you that it contained ONLY FOUR episodes and not the full season; I thought it was the entire first season. Don't make the same mistake I did; don't buy either ""A Galaxy Divided"" or this disc. They never should have been released. Wait and purchase (or pre-order) the complete season instead at:

1 star for releasing season 1 in such a form.",1245715200,6,111,4.55
3853657,5,B0026IBRRO,It's worth buying if you can't wait till later in the year - awesome stuff just love this tv series .,1245628800,2,101,3.857142857142857
3853658,1,B0026IBRRO,This is a complete waste of money.  4 episodes?  Wait until the entire season is released.  Don't buy this!,1245110400,14,107,4.526315789473684
3853659,1,B0026IBRRO,"So this is the last four episodes.
You would have to be crazy to buy this. Its much better to wait for the complete season. If the complete season is being delayed to release this junk lucasarts must have gone insane.

Anyway, this certainly feels like a test to see if people will buy anything.

Show the studios what for, wait for the real thing.

Honestly if the complete season was out now Lucasarts would be swimming in money. This is just weird.",1244764800,45,451,4.409638554216867

3853661,2,B0026IBRRO,"As if volume 1 containing four episodes wasn't a big enough insult to fans, now comes vol. 2 with only four more episodes. These episodes aren't even in anamorphic widescreen!

3853671,1,B0026IBRRO,"This is one of the better series to come out in a long time. But breaking up the season and getting us to pay more for it this way is a slap in the face to the fans. Don't reward this greedy behavior, or you can count on this type of rip off in the future too. Buy the full season for the more reasonable price of $30, instead of 6 x $10 each:
