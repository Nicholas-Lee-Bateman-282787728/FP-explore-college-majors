4041971,5,B002ZMZBCS,"I don't know if it was a conscious decision of the production, or not, but this movie was presented like a straight comedy about an het couple, Louise and Paul, who is struggling with a newborn relationship, and the fear of Louise to have found once more a gay in the closet as boyfriend. But since the first scenes, Louise and Paul go in the background and the story is really about two gay couple, William and Lawrence, at the beginning of their relationship and with the need to find a balance, and Harry and Alex, who instead are already in a long term relationship, that basically is good, but since they are not content with their life outside their relationship, obviously also their private life is on the risk.

Said that, this is really a nice comedy, with a bit of drama, but after all not so much to kill the romance. The actors are handsome enough without being out of the ordinary, and their stories are common but with a bit of ""chic"" (artistry type, nice enough houses, night clubs and so on).

Mr. Right is a low budget but good romance, and the actors are all very good: in the end, it's the straight couple, the one who is more advertized, that is the less interesting.",1278288000,,1188,4.420091324200913
4041972,2,B002ZMZBCS,Not a comedy. Tries to be a drama but has so many dull characters in it I could not pay attention all the time. Unrealistic portrayal of gay men - unless this is how they act in England. The story starts out slow and gets slower as it progresses and it finally stumbles to the end with a contrived ending that can be seen coming a mile away.,1276300800,,341,4.029411764705882
4041973,4,B002ZMZBCS,"There are not a lot of ""family"" films like this out there...there could have been more character development but I will watch this one again.  Great cast and characters...enjoy",1273276800,,176,5.068965517241379
4041974,4,B002ZMZBCS,"""Mr. Right"" does a slight genuflect in the direction of the 1950s classic, ""La Ronde"", but is otherwise a well-written and decently acted romantic comedy with a gay core.  Credible casting with attractive and solidly professional actors (mostly) and good production values make the film engaging and way above average overall for the genre.

Basically the story of several gay couples and their female friend in common, ""Mr. Right"" focuses on what draws people together and, conversely, what works to drive them apart.  The story's greatest strength is in its portrayal of the characters and how they evolve as individuals when they enter into relationships.  It often breaks down to the pairing of the relatively mature and secure with the relatively immature and insecure.  Without going very far into detail, in this flick (British, by the way), you have a successful and wealthy artist paired with a hunky and calculating drone; an aspiring but talentless younger actor with a successful but restless TV producer; a well-meaning but nervous single father with a rising soap opera actor; and female friend with ""eHarmony""-matched jock.

""Mr. Right"" has plenty of good moments and several non-cliched endings that make it well-worth watching.  Recommended.",1270771200,8,1258,5.291457286432161
4041975,3,B002ZMZBCS,"you won't be overwhelmed by this good entertainment, but pleased for sure, and you will enjoy the story if you like romance made out of intricated and mixed feelings. That's an intelligent film, moving sometimes. Go for it.",1270598400,2,223,4.894736842105263
4041976,5,B002ZMZBCS,"This is a film that looks like it had a large budget - nice sets, great actors.  I first saw it on Netflix and decided I wanted a copy to keep, and I've watched it twice.  Consider it similar to a soap opera, but of a higher quality.  There are three couples here who interact i positive and negative ways, like most couples, but one couple make up most of the story.  Won't reveal the end, but it was not what I expected.  I do recommend this movie highly.  As I said, I've watched it twice already, and now that I have the DVD I'll do so again in about a year.",1363305600,,562,3.9732142857142856
4041977,5,B002ZMZBCS,"Good film to watch when you just want to sit back and relax - wonderful, fun characters - and humor.  First viewing, a bit disappointed in lack of even a minimum of overt sexuality - but now don't care.  These people are a trip!  Love 'em all - even the mothers and brothers and fathers.  Worth watching just for these interactions with their gay sons, brothers . . .",1360368000,,367,4.27536231884058

But to those of us who get it right with Mr. Right, here's to us. My partner and I have 13 years behind us and even more ahead of us. This movie is a tribute to those who love and last and show us it is not always an easy road to travel.",1325980800,,411,3.577777777777778
4041979,2,B002ZMZBCS,"I am so Thankful this film came on Sundance for had it not I would have made the error in buying it for my collection. Really there was what could have been a ""real story"" here but that did not happend. Instead the director took this film on what seemed to be a if you will ""trip"". It went here, there, everywhere, leaving you saying what the heck is this so called film I'm watching. Then the so called female friend still doesn't know the difference between a gay man & a straight man with all the gay men she is surrounded by. Please if ""anything"" rent this film do not buy it. If someone elese were to take and rewrite this script it would be a great story and done without spending a ton of money as well. Simply the director failed at telling any kind of story here. If your bored or a lazy Sunday afternoon take a peak but remember even if it's a lazy afternoon you can not get back the lazy time you gave up by watching this film.

Peace & Blesssings,

Hope This Helps someone from buying.",1298592000,3,997,4.160621761658031
4041980,2,B002ZMZBCS,"Mr. Right is a story of looking for ""that one"" - a second half, a love of your life, etc.(choose the right one).
We meet a gang of gays and one fag hag. All of them are looking and looking and...With better or worse result.
After I watched the movie I was really torn. It is not a low budget production, so the picture and sound are good.
The acting is not bad either...
It must be the plot and the characters. As a viewer I couldn't associate myself with any of the characters. There is a male h***ker, and a sad, ugly fag who must pay him to have sex (both annoying like hell). We have one gay father who is terrorised by his own kiddo, another camp who cannot shut up for a single minute (every moment this one appeared on the screen I felt like throwing sth at the tv) and another who is ""an soap actor"".
With such bunch of ""interesting"" characters I couldn't wait to see the end titles.

Better to rent, than to buy.",1294790400,3,921,4.116666666666666
4041981,3,B002ZMZBCS,British accent is a bit difficult to keep up with at times.  All in all a good movie that gets you involved emotionally and intellectually with the characters.,1284854400,2,159,4.678571428571429
4041982,4,B002ZMZBCS,"The idea of showing concurrently the lives of several characters which are more or less connected with each other is as old in gay and lesbian cinema as anywhere else. Unfortunately, usually it is done better as ""Goldfish Memory"" or ""Love and Other Disasters"" amply prove. ""Mr Right"", although not necessarily an indy movie (some actors are actually recognizable, at least for the British audience) seems to be the work of a rather indy-minded screenplay writer.
""Mr Right"" aims at presenting a variety of ways in which gay (and sometimes straight) people are looking for their perfect companions in contemporary London. This is a good place to start and the movie takes off nicely and then... it gets stuck. The story-lines do not complement each other in a very meaningful way, the characters are not necessarily very interesting, and their life choices sometimes require a lot of suspension of disbelief to be accepted. The ending seems quite forced and not fully credible, I am not quite sure whether it will come up to most people's idea of happy ending.
Having said that I must say there are good parts to the movie - I found especially touching the story line of an art dealer who has to find a way to make his young daughter accept a candidate for her daddy's significant other. But it is a well known truth that kids always steal the show ;)
In short - it may not be necessary the right movie for you but spending an evening with Mr Right is not the worst option. Just don't look for a deep and meaningful structure, it's more like a handful of scenes and story-lines from which you must choose what interest and touches you and discreetly disregard the rest.",1284508800,,1668,4.657627118644068

4041984,3,B002ZMZBCS,"I was somewhat disappointed by this film, not because of the acting, quality or production, but rather the scripting. The film in essence follows the lives of a group of gay friends and their respective lovers, attempting where possible to address their failings, desires and personal demons. This is done verbally as opposed to visually, and as a consequence a great deal of effort is spent on the characters and their communications.

Through a series of lengthy monologues and verbalised thoughts, the central characters discuss their emotions, lack of direction and obsessions. The tragedy is that whilst many a man may think intensely on aspects of his life, he seldom verbalises those thoughts in a manner which amounts to a confusing litany of expressions that have neither direction nor purpose. Nor is it conceivable that a person would speak out loud in such a way as to ignore the presence of others, merely to verbalise what he or she is thinking. At times these verbalised thought processes are confusing, and it takes great effort to stay focused. After some time you wonder whether there was any point to what was said, and your impression is that the character is overwhelmed by his own neurosis. The net effect is that many of the characters are nothing more than self-obsessed thinkers, concerned more with their own thoughts than the opinions of others. Their lovers are casual (and often disinterested) observers who like the audience are forced to listen to these lengthy emotional explanations, without having any opportunity to participate therein.

Ironically one of the features of the DVD are two short stories, which are introduced by the writer David Morris. If you watch the introduction you will understand the scripting, as he himself seems to say a great deal in that introduction, often repeating himself. I ended up fast forwarding to the actual short films, only to find both of them much the same as the film. That is, single characters discussing their emotions, thought process and beliefs ad nauseam.

In all fairness however, there are some good moments in the film, and I commend the direction (also David Morris) as this must have been difficult. It is not easy to portray conversations in film, and they are better suited to the theatre (where the audience expects to participate in the characters thought processes). As a film however, I am not sure it succeeds.",1278460800,,2406,4.980099502487562

8385171,1,B002ZMZBCS,"Don't waste your time on this idiotic, disjointed mess.
The movie's synopsis ""implies"" that it is about a gal who's boyfriend finds her gay male pals just a bit too attractive.  That sounds like It could be an entertaining, clever premise doesn't it?
The movie, however, has absolutely nothing to do with that.  Rather, it's a sprinkling of gay guys, all going through their lives and peppered with problems along the way, but it's not even done or presented in an entertaining manner.  I can't even say the movie is somewhat episodic because that wouldn't be an apt description either.
The actors chosen here for the roles each display a marginal amount of acting talent, marginal being the operative word here.  I rented this last night because there was literally NOTHING to watch and it seemed like a light-hearted, innocuous movie.  It's not even passable, I can't even find the kindness to at least say it's ""ok"".  I don't even know how they came up with the title ""Mr. Right"" - and, you don't have to worry about a ""spoiler alert"" here regarding the plot because there ISN'T any plot - just gay guys all ""20 or 30ish"" (since evidently gay guys are never allowed to be much older than that) living out their self-centered shallow lives.  I really wanted to LIKE this movie, it started out with a cute scene between a mom and her son and his perspective boyfriend of whom the mother obviously doesn't approve of.  That scene, although lacking, showed comedic promise but even that fell flat.
In short, if you're looking for a clever, lighthearted, heartwarming cute movie about gay couples, keep looking.  While I'm on the subject, why are gay themed movies almost always so dreadful - it's indeed a rarity to find one that is entertaining and well-acted.  I wish that more major studios would take a story inclusive of gay characters and transfer it to the screen in an entertaining fashion.",1454889600,,1897,4.738601823708207

But this is really a story revolving around three main couples, all friends, who keep intersecting.  Several messages are observed throughout the story: taking back your independence, escaping an old habit, learning its okay to be happy for yourself, and taking a risk with new love.
