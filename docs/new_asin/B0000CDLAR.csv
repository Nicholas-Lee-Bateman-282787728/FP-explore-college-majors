7998988,3,B0000CDLAR,"I've seen worse, but I generally like low-budget films with beautiful girls in it.  Traci Bingham is hot!  I'd like to look for more of her movies.  Maybe she's got something else out there that may be worthy of owning on DVD.

And why is everyone making a big deal out of Master P's very minute participation in the film?  The way I see it, his whole role, and the whole Las Vegas input was totally unnecessary to the story.  In fact, it made it seem like more of a ""ghetto gangsta"" film having him in it, which makes it seem ever more low budget.

Well, earlier this week I saw another low-budget film with gorgeous girls in it, call ""Senorita Justice.""  This movie ""Bad Bizness"" is nowhere's near as bad as ""Senorita Justice"", although they both have outstanding gorgeous girls in it.

Now, if you'd like to see gorgeous girls in movies, but with a bigger budget and a more interesting story, check out ""B!tch Slap!"", ""Sucker Punch"", ""Man of the House"", ""D.O.A.: Dead or Alive"", ""So Close"", ""Cloud 9"", and ""Chasing Papi.""  Now, these films promise to be more entertaining if you like to watch gorgeous girls on film, as I do.  If you have any suggestions for me, I'd really appreciate it.",1318118400,,1191,4.493023255813953
7998989,2,B0000CDLAR,"I don't know why they even put Master P on the cover? He only got 4 SHORT scenes! The actin is not that good. This movie is like pamelas show V.I.P. Traci Bingham look like a black pamela. Movie is not good, TRACI IS COVERED UP THE WHOLE TIME, she doesnt show! Alot of other nudity scenes tho. Movie is a 2.5/5",1076889600,4,310,4.016129032258065
7998990,5,B0000CDLAR,"Bad Bizness is just what the title dictates... something utterly horrible.  The film is a cleverly ridiculous attempt at a murder/erotic thriller.
Master P, who is specifically on the cover as to indicate that he is the ""starring role"" in this film, is in the film for a
total of 5 minutes.  He appears in the film approximately 3 times throughout the movie, calling from Las Vegas.  You are immediately aware that it is a scene where Master P will definitely be shown because of the hard core rap in the background that overtakes the ""well thought"" dialogue that Master P is trying to read... I mean, perform.
Also, they make sure you understand that he is in Las Vegas by the flashing scenes of Las Vegas scenery, the 2 minute flash of the huge ""Las Vegas, Nevada"" sign and the fact that Master P wears a visor that says ""Las Vegas"" on it... I think Master P is supposed to be in Las Vegas.
Please don't let me forget to tell you the horrendous acting of Traci Bingham.  It hurts my brain to think about her and how she seems to be trying to act so I will move on to the greatest parts of this movie.  1) It's pretty much a soft core porn...
scenes of pointless soft core porn are inserted into the film (some of which is stolen from ""Final Examination""... a recommended film on the DVD special features); and 2) The movie's plot is wrapped up in a record breaking 8 minutes.
I call this a Love/Hate Phenomenon because I love to hate it but can't stop watching horrible B Films... It's a love/hate relationship.
If you share my passion, I highly recommend White Fire (starring Robert Ginty) and Street Knight (starring Jeff Speakman).  Although, Trans World films aren't thoroughly distributed, I highly recommend Ninja Squad and Ninja Terminator (both starring Richard Harrison).  Trust me that you will NOT be disappointed!",1074124800,2,1827,4.585889570552148
7998991,1,B0000CDLAR,"Ok, from the title, this movie sounds like a ghetto movie, far from it, its sort of an erotic thriller but the cheapest u can find around. Im surprise that Master P's name in his the credit when he's rarely seen in the movie, its horrible, it shouldnt be out for rent it belongs to the garbage",1070582400,3,293,4.157894736842105
