4597629,4,B0057P4SAQ,"the DVD came in perfect condition, nice shipping and I was happy with that. I got a little bored watching some of the shows, but that is just because I'm not a hard core western fan. I hadn't really ever seen John Wayne so I wans't like a huge fan that bought the DVD just for that. But if you love John wayne and old old westerns you have a winner! You can tell that the stories are older because of parts in the first couple stories are somewhat bad quality... but that is expected out of that old of movies. I wasn't dissapointed in the product. As I said: if you Love John Wayne or old westerns, I'm sure you will be more than satisfied!",1360022400,2,641,4.095238095238095
4597630,4,B0057P4SAQ,"This DVD contains 23 B films of mostly the early 30s.  It also shows Angel and the Badman, and McClintock which had not been ""renewed"" but still is decent quality.  The early films show a continually developing Duke...you can actually see how his acting style, riding, fighting, etc. improve through training of people like Yakima Canutt, who is in a good many of these. It also shows, little by little his adding his own, later to be famous, traits that made John Wayne the star he was.
But, one of the best aspects is an interview of Pappy Ford that I had not seen.  It is done with Hank Fonda, Duke, and Jimmy Stewart in Monument Valley, probably the last time Pappy was there...sort of his ""Goodbye"" to his favorite place.  Hank actually HUGs Pappy and Pappy allows it!  The DVD is worth THIS alone! For a paltry amount of money, this is surely a CLASSIC DVD if you are looking to learn about Duke and the beginning of his development of what would become the greatest Western movie actor ever.

4597631,4,B0057P4SAQ,"We got this collection for my father-n-law's birthday. He loves the ""Duke"" and so we knew we couldn't go wrong. We also picked up a DVD player at the same time. He is sitting in his recliner enjoying them now! Some of the footage is quite dated but, hey, my dad doesn't mind and neither will yours.

4597633,3,B0057P4SAQ,"I don't see any list of films for this collection.  They are probably ""oaters"" (low budget westerns) he did in the 30's, but we won't know from this site.  How about a list, Amazon?",1328832000,7,181,4.294117647058823

4597635,2,B0057P4SAQ,"I do have this DVD Collect, bought from Wal-mart bad thing to do on my behalf because I buy my DVD'S from AMAZON, The price was much higher then Amazon, Amazon has good decient prices, at the time I seen it at Wal-mart wasn't thinking because though the price was great!! NOT!! Buy from AMAZON better prices, better products, Fair and good people you deal with at AMAZON. Won't happen again price wasn't good as I thought it was and the movie NOT!!So much worth the money I spent and to top it off I had .to pay Taxes not with AMAZON in most and many states",1321142400,3,557,4.214953271028038
4597636,3,B0057P4SAQ,"As movies go, these early oaters of the Duke's were not artistically good.  The plots were simplistic, pure good (John Wayne) vs. evil, and good always won.  They were shot in the southern California desert, and the sets were just a bit flimsy.  The characters were easy to follow--no contradictions.  In short, these just aren't very good.  If it were not for the fact that Wayne eventually made some good westerns, I doubt that these would have resurfaced or that anyone would have bought them.  Still, they have some interest, if only as curiosities, as examples of what boys liked to see in the Great Depression.",1317600000,6,616,4.764150943396227

4597668,5,B0057P4SAQ,"These old, old films may not have the greatest video quality, but I can't get enough of them.  Going into a collection of movies from the 1930's, I really wouldn't expect crisp, clear images anyway, but I don't have any trouble enjoying these DVD's despite the jumpy, grainy look of most of them.  I don't have any trouble following along with the dialogue or the action, so I'm not going to complain about getting twenty-five movies that are 70 to 80 years old for five bucks.  Each person has his or her own standards when it comes to what you can deal with in a video, so if you need your 1930's films to look pristine, search elsewhere.  But if you want a very affordable way to acquire a large library of early John Wayne films, this is the best deal I've seen.  I especially like the old serials ""Shadow of the Eagle, ""Desert Command,"" and ""Hurricane Express.""  Oddly, ""Angel and the Badman"" from 1947 is slipped in, not to mention ""Mclintock!"" from 1963 and the documentary ""The American West of John Ford"" from 1971, but all the other movies range from 1932 to 1937.  If you're into fun, old-timey cowboy adventures and/or John Wayne, and if you're not super picky about the picture quality of Depression-era movies, you should get hours of enjoyment out of this set.",1407283200,3,1275,4.565789473684211

4597670,1,B0057P4SAQ,"We also purchased the John Wayne Film Collection which has a very similar picture on its cover. However, that is where the similarities stop. The John Wayne Film Collection (not this Tribute Collection) is very nicely packaged with special fold out booklet with pockets for each CD and pictures all throughout. The video and sound quality is great even for the old Red River and The Big Trail movies . However this CD set titled 'John Wayne - The Tribute Collection' is nothing like that even though the picture on Amazon would make you think it will be of identical quality packaging and identical sound/video quality. Now I know why this one was 75% lower in cost than the John Wayne Film Collection. It almost seems as if it were a bootleg version the packaging and video/sound quality are so poor. Who knows? In any case....very disappointed.",1392163200,20,846,4.761904761904762
