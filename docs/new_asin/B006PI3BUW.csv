5012759,3,B006PI3BUW,"Bleach is an inspired series, because there are many diverse characters who must act in concert to get through the trouble they are in.

This movie gives that integral structure a mere nod and then goes on with battle after battle after battle. Yes, I expect that but lots of movies have effective battle scenes I expect more from Bleach.

Perhaps the trouble was in the subtitles. They ranged from medicore to poor so that one needed to pause the movie on occassion & ponder what the character really meant to say. (Once the dubbed movie come out I am sure the dialog will make much more sense and my review will be better.)

Finally, the movie copies and slightly rewrites scenes from the series. The first scene with Ichigo being taken driectly from episode 1. It is not germane to the plot, Ichigo could have been introduced in a way that moved the plot along instead of just falling apart at the end.

Bleach the movies & the show rely on the fantastic & unexpected to achieve its effect. This was expected and is not brilliant like the other 3 movied.",1338768000,,1057,4.489583333333333

5012761,4,B006PI3BUW,The Bleach franchise is excellent anime. This particular title has a few glitches in the subtitling and if you don't mind Japanese sound with English subtitles you will be fine. Otherwise the movie is visually astounding and the clarity if upconverted or just regular dvd is outstanding. Mild violence that is not appropriate for anyone under 13. Very good movie and great for the price.,1330905600,,387,4.969230769230769

5012783,3,B006PI3BUW,"Just finished watching ""Bleach - The Movie - Hell Verse.""
I believe this is the fourth, non-canonical movie to be set in the Bleach Universe.  I also believe that this takes place early in Ichigo's career as a Substitute Soul Reaper, though I'm not sure because the chronology in this particular movie is slightly skewed - a problem with all the non-canonical Bleach movies.
Sinner's from Hell launch a diversionary attack on Ichigo and his friends while they're in school, preventing them from realizing almost too late that the real target is Ichigo's sisters, who will be used as bait to force Ichigo to break the gates of Hell in order to release all the sinners there back into the Mortal Realm.
Yet an unexpected ally appears to help Ichigo, a sinner from Hell who wants to prevent the other sinners from escaping and he is willing to take them to the depths of Hell.  Yet, be careful of who you trust in Hell, Ichigo, for everyone in Hell has their own particular motives.
Not a great movie in the Bleach cannon, but not a bad one either.
Recommended for Bleach fans.

5012818,2,B006PI3BUW,"I'm a huge fan of Bleach. However, I do like a bit of story with my slicing and dicing and ultra violence. This is the usual fare, Ichigo has to save yet another female (this time his little sister, even though dad is former Soul Reaper captain, he always seems to be elsewhere) from a fate worse than death. The cast of characters is smaller this time around with only the core friend group making an appearance, and only Renji and Rukia and Uryu getting in on the action. No real planning on this rescue just jump in and fight.  The Soul Society makes a brief appearance, and no Con or any of Urahara's group Sigh...... not the best work. But if fighting is all you're into then it's an ok effort, with Ichigo showing some new talents.",1405468800,,737,4.340579710144928

5012853,4,B006PI3BUW,"After watching Movie 4 it has become my new second favorite Bleach movie  prevoiusly movie 1 was second favorite with Movie 2 being  and still is my number one favorite. Movie 4 does have its pros and cons which I'll list below.

Pros:
1) The Story is so good it keeps it at the edge of your seat threw the hole movie you can't wait to see how Ichigo and his friends are going save Karin and Yuzu from their kidnappers.

2) The Music is outstanding, Shiro Sagisu  did an awesome job picking songs from the show and 3 other movies to mix in with the new songs he composed for Movie 4.

3) The Voice acting in the english version is beliveable and full of emotion, Ichigo's VA for example does a fantastic job of making Ichigo sound like he is really  cares about what happens to his sisters ,his VA is so beliveable and full emotion in his performance you'd think Karin and Yuzu where his real live sisters.

4) The Picture and sound quality are outstanding I could see ever gorgous detail clearly and hear every litttle sound perfectly on my 42 inch 1080P  Sanyo HDTV.

5) the animation is outstanding,it is very fulid and detailed especially during the fight scenes.

Cons:

1) Viz messed up the subtitle tracks, when you pick the english dub with dubtitles you get the movie in english but with subs for the japanese version I tried to change it with the subtitle button on my Blu-ray player's remote once I started the movie  but Viz made it so you can't do that for some reason.

2) Again Viz has forgotten to put music on the menus ,I don't why know every since the Rurichiyo arch dvds  Viz all of sudden stop putting music on their dvd menus.

3)Viz could of  given us better special features then the two art galleries like a interview with the english dub cast and crew about their work on the movie,a blooper/gag reel , A commentry track with the english dub's ADR director and some the voice actors.

4) I loved the story but I have two problems with it . one being where is Issin and how does  he not noice when Karin are Yuzu have been kidnapped, Why didn't  they have him help Ichigo instead of useless Orihime. Maybe this movie came out in Japan before the episode where Ichigo finds out his dad is a Soul Reaper  aired and the writers wanted leave that special moment for the anime. Two being the Lack of Toshiro and Masumoto two of my favorite characters who  appear in like two scenes the whole movie and do nothing to help Ichigo and his friends.

5) they finallly show Rukia naked but it's a let down because they only show her naked  for about 2 or 3 seconds and you can't enjoy it like you could the Masumoto and Orihime bath scene in the anime

I'm just trying to make it simple here ok. ^_^

With an anime production by Studio Pierrot, the film is directed by Noriyuki Abe (""Bleach"", ""Ninku"", ""Ghost Stories"", ""Flame of Recca"") and a screenplay by Masahiro Okubo (""Sugar Sugar Rune"", ""Tantei Gakuen Q"") and Natsuko Takahashi (""Bleach"", ""Prince of Tennis"", ""School Rumble"").

VIDEO:

""Bleach the Movie 4: Hell Verse"" is presented in 1080p High Definition and ""Bleach"" looks fantastic on Blu-ray! Granted, it helps that this is a film and not the TV series, as there is much more detail in the actual character designs, more emphasis on fluidity on the action sequences, especially during the ""bankai"" segments. But this is what I enjoy about seeing the transition of popular TV series for film, a higher production and also the fact that animators have more time in production and quality of the animation and art backgrounds than the typical quick turn around that they are expected to do on a TV series.

Wonderful PQ and because many shots are in Hell, and a lot of reds and oranges, I personally didn't see any banding issues.  For the most part, ""Hell Verse"" looks vibrant, colorful, sharp and fantastic on Blu-ray!

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

For ""Bleach the Movie 4: Hell Verse is presented in DTS-HD MA 5.1 English and Japanese.  Great use of surround during the more action intense sequences and because there is so much action, good amount of immersion from the surround channels and also moments of LFE.

Subtitles are provided in English as optional during the English soundtrack and also featured in the Japanese soundtrack of the film.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Bleach the Movie 4: Hell Verse"" comes with the following special features:

JUDGMENT CALL:

December is the month for a ""Bleach"" animated film and as the U.S. DVD release is trying to catchup with what is being released in Japan, the fourth ""Bleach"" movie ""Hell Verse"" features a non-canon storyline and takes Ichigo Kurosaki and friends to a new area to fight in...Hell.

For ""Bleach"" fans, the storyline may seem inconsistent timeline wise with the manga and TV series as after the Arrancar arc, Ichigo Kurosaki has lost his powers.  But animated films inspired from the TV or manga series are typically side stories that are not mean to be part of the series' cannon.

For ""Bleach the Movie 4: Hell Verse"", it's rather interesting because we are given a scene between Ichigo's fight vs. Ulquiorra and the truth is that during that time of the Arrancar arc, not much is known about Ichigo's mysterious power that he gained during that fight.  We know he tapped into something mysterious, perhaps something that may not be good at all but we do know it's the most powerful transformation that he has been in and something he has no control over.

And while the TV and manga series tend to focus more on the battle between the Soul Reapers vs. the Arrancars during that arc, suffice to say, there was not as much Ichigo Kurosaki featured as the goal was to show an all out war featuring as many people as possible.  And it became one of Tite Kubo's most exciting, action-packed arc thus far in the ""Bleach"" series at the time.

But for ""Hell Verse"", it's nice to see the animated film bring back that uncontrollable power and transformation of Ichigo Kurosaki and while a battle in Hell will provide new antagonists and a whole new world that Ichigo Kurosaki and friends that have never ventured, hardcore Bleach fans know that the Soul Society would probably not have let Ichigo Kurosaki be that reckless and endanger the World of the Living for the sake of his sister (for those who are familiar with the Deputy Soul Reaper storyline in ""Bleach"", those fans will know what I'm talking about).

Otherwise, for an animated film and for fans with no familiarity with the series, it is a standalone storyline that is accessible to fans and non-fans as it focuses on Ichigo and friends trying to save his sister.  Showcasing as much action as possible and even integrating an emotional, tragic scene, longtime ""Bleach"" writers Masahiro Okubo and Natsuko Takahashi are really taking the characters, especially Ichigo Kurosaki into unknown territory and experimenting with situations that are not seen in the manga and also the anime series.

But that is the beauty of anime films, they tend to be standalone stories independent of the series and for the most part, ""Bleach the Movie 4: Hell Verse"" was entertaining, action-packed and enjoyable.

As for the Blu-ray release, picture quality and lossless audio quality was fantastic and that is another plus for animated films versus its TV counterpart and that's better production value, better picture quality and in this case, a wonderful, immersive lossless soundtrack.  Special features are sparse, but they have always been like that for ""Bleach"".

Overall, if you are a ""Bleach"" fan or an anime fan looking for an action-based film on Blu-ray, you don't have to be a longtime viewer of ""Bleach"" to understand this film, you just have to be a fan of action anime.  And if that is the case, you'll definitely enjoy ""Bleach the Movie 4: Hell Verse"".",1364601600,,5719,4.885093167701863

Well this time its Yuzu, Ichigo's little sister, and he has to go to hell to save her! I've always wondered if there was a heaven or hell in the bleach universe since apparently one goes to the soul society when he or she dies, but here we learn that hell is a place where the worst sinners go and there are a group of sinners who want to break free from hells grasp and are basically bribing Ichigo to break the very gates of hell in exchange for his sister's soul. I really enjoyed this movie, I would say it may be my favorite bleach movie so far. The animation is awesome, and I just think the concept is just perfect for a bleach side story. The bluray had amazing picture and sound, but featured very little special features. Just a small art gallery and a couple trailers.
Overall, awesome. You've been to the soul society. You've been to hueco mundo. Welcome to hell.",1355270400,8,978,4.320652173913044
5012896,4,B006PI3BUW,"So, in this movie we get to explore Hell.  Of which we've only seen the gates once back in Ichigo's early days as a substitute soul reaper.  Of course that glimpse had left me curious...well now I am pretty satisfied on that part.  We certainly do learn a lot more about Hell and how it works.  Rukia and Renji both explain about soul reaper's involvment with this prison, that was a tidbit completely new and interesting to find out about.
  The animation and sound were crisp and clear.  The fight scenes were spectacular, fast paced and more intricate than usually seen in the serial anime, and that's a given for a movie.  However, because this was made before the end of the war with Aizen, a couple of the battles just (SPOILER---rehashed our hero's techniques and the counters to them. Aside from seeing darn near apocalyptic superpower from a hollowfied Ichigo, an example would be the cutting off of Ichigo's hollow mask's horn just like Ulquiorra did to stop him,  and Rukia's battle that almost mirrored her fight with the ninth espada in Hueco Mundo. End SPOILER)  In that regard, excepting seeing the abilities of the bad guys in Hell, those two battles weren't that interesting because they weren't different enough from what I'd seen before. As for the rest of the battles, they were pretty good, especially the last one where Ichigo goes back for his friends and a surprising thing happens to him. You'll just have to watch to find out about that!
  Overall, I did enjoy this movie, and if you are a fan of Bleach  and liked the other movies, I believe you will enjoy this, too.",1355011200,2,1594,4.629893238434164

5012899,4,B006PI3BUW,"A group of men escape Hell briefly. In that time, they attempt to kidnap Ichigo's sisters. Chad is able to save Karin, but Yuzu is taken back to Hell when the kidnapper's are pulled back in by their chains. Chad is seriously injured while saving Karin, so Ichigo, Renji, Rukia, and Uryuu go to Hell to save her. The kidnappers are stuck in Hell because of the chains that bind them. They witnessed Ichigo's hollow transformation and they believe that he has the power to break those chains. They will return Yuzu if he cooperates. The battle in Hell is intense and the danger of never being able to leave is high. Especially for a weaker girl like Yuzu.

This is a good movie, but it's my least favorite Bleach movie. The other 3 movies had a pretty good bad guy. The 1st movie had a great character, Senna. You can really get into some of the enemies in the Bleach movies. This one is different. The bad guys are really stupid and have ridiculous looking bodies. The main bad guy is ok, but not very impressive either. The animation, action, suspense, and Ichigo's Hollow transformation are all as cool as you would expect. But this is definitely the weakest Bleach movie yet. That being said, I did enjoy this one, and I think other fans of the series will too.",1354579200,4,1263,4.467532467532467
5012900,5,B006PI3BUW,"Compared to the other Shounen movie adaptions of Bleach this is the best one yet in my opinion. Most shounen movie releases are long one big boring filler, but not this one.

It had battles left and right, AWESOME quality and animation (I own the Blu-ray release so I can't speak for the DVD version)and a great plot in general if I say so. I won't get into the plot of the movie because you can just look that up on Wikipedia for yourself and be your own judge on if you'd like to buy this movie or not, I'll just be pointing out the flaws and what I enjoyed about the movie. I'll also give a basic overview if what you'll be getting when you purchase this release - plain and simple.

This movie received the same treatment Viz Media gives all of their other releases: bare bones minimum. The only add-on you receive is a piece of paper advertising the companies new Neon Alley streaming service for the PS3. As for the discs actual extras all you get is the 2 original Japanese trailers (they are NOT subbed or dubbed, they are raw) and the English voice cast list (no voice changes were made in this movie from what I heard myself) - You get the usual recyclable Blu-ray/DVD case as well. (-_-)

What I didn't like about the movie /and this is the only thing I didn't like/ was that the final battle between Ichigo and the overall villain (I'm not stating his name because it is a major spoiler) was very fast/rushed and sort of boring.. Once Ichigo returned to hell to rescue Uryu, Renji and Rukia it all went by very fast, the battles that took place before Ichigo returned to Karakura before going into hell for the final time were MUCH better and enjoyable, in my opinion.

SPOILER: Ichigo does get a new form/suit type of thing that is given to him to help aid in his final battle by the guardians of hell, but it is never seen past this movie so it is kind of a movie exclusive.

So overall I found this to be a very enjoyable movie,
the best out of all 4 Bleach anime movies if you ask me. I strongly suggest picking this release up, the dub cast was spot on and sounded fantastic in this movie, not that the cast doesn't always sound great in the normal episodes.",1353888000,3,2175,4.2822384428223845
5012901,5,B006PI3BUW,I have always preferred Bleach in Japanese. I also got this well before the American release so that was cool too. I really liked the movie. The drawing was great. The music was great. I'm so glad I got this.,1353801600,,208,4.225
5012902,4,B006PI3BUW,"I typically don't like non-canon Bleach anime - namely the movies and arcs that don't follow the manga. This, though, was rather entertaining. As the fourth Bleach film, it certainly is a step up from Diamond Dust Rebellion and is as good if not better than Fade to Black (though I am still a fan of Memories of Nobody). The story is interesting, there is a good dose of what every Bleach movie should have - fluidly illustrated fight scenes - and not a lot of wasted time of fuzzy, emotional appeals (the downfall of Diamond Dust Rebellion). And there is the added perk of finding out just what the world beyond that terrifying gate is actually like - and believe me it isn't a cheerful place. The story also has a few twist that keep things entertaining. Bleach is at its best when showcasing all its cool abilities and fights and this movie puts them on display. Very entertaining, especially for Bleach fans.

A few drawbacks: 1. there is a woeful lack of other characters in this one. The core squad is all there - Rukia, Ichigo, Renji, Chad, Inoue, and Ishida - but the other big guns only get cameo appearances. Byakuya has an awesome entry, but that's it. One of my favorite parts of the series is seeing the whole gamut of characters get in on the action, so that is a little bit of a bummer. 2. As per usual, someone at some point pulls the ""it's all your fault that we weren't paying attention and you suffered for it"" line. Although, the saving grace in this instance is that Ichigo won't have any of it. Go Ichigo. 3. The ending is a *little* far-fetched. bet hey, it's Bleach.",1350864000,18,1590,4.426621160409557

8502796,4,B006PI3BUW,"In this Bleach movie we get to see hell. Even though it's not canon I thought it was an interesting take on it. I have the last arc of the manga to read still so I don't know if we ever get to see it for real, but if not that makes this even better because ever since we only got that tiny glimpse into hell from the manga I've been intrigued.

The animation is great with only a couple of background choices that seemed stale, but overall no real complaints on it.

I do wish they'd strayed from standard past battle tropes a bit more. One battle was almost a copy of a previous one with just the bad guy changed out.

Not that I don't like Yuzu, but I wish the kidnap victim had been someone I liked more. Ishida would have been awesome, but Karin would probably have been a better choice.

The bad guy didn't surprise me at all, but he was still decent.

Still I really liked the movie and will probably watch it again.",1526342400,,922,4.1

I removed the stickers before taking the pictures but you can see the small tear in the last pic;still great nonetheless.",1489622400,,389,4.131578947368421
