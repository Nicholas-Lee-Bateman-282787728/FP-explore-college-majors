8225847,3,B000WVZ9A8,"The Coming of Amos (Paul Sloane, 1925)

Paul Sloane's career is no more than an historical footnote these days; he made some noise during the silent era, but when talkies took over the scene, he found himself relegated to directing B-westerns until his retirement in 1939. (He attempted a comeback in the early fifties; it didn't take.) He started out in Hollywood as a writer, first in scenarios, then graduating to direct screenplays, and thus it made sense that when he hopped over into directing, he'd write most of his own material. Thus, it's ironic that one of the few surviving Sloane films is one he had no hand at all in writing; it's a film that's more notable for what it's not than what it is. Cecil B. DeMille originally optioned the book, written by William J. Locke, a very popular writer at the time (and still adapted occasionally; the Judi Dench vehicle Ladies in Lavender, released in 2004, was adapted from a short story of Locke's). Locke accepted on one condition: DeMille would neither adapt the book nor direct the film. You can imagine how well those terms went over, but eventually, DeMille acquiesced; the book was adapted by James Ashmore Creelman and Garrett Fort, two writers who were relatively unknown quantities in Hollywood at the time, but with enough experience to do the job correctly. (Both would go on to become household names in the thirties, Creelman with King Kong and Fort with Dracula; Fort also scripted the 1930 remake of Tod Browning's Outside the Law, the original of which is reviewed earlier in this issue.) Sloane, on the other hand, was complete unknown; he had done his first directing earlier in 1925. While I can't say the film is an unqualified success, and it's certainly not as good as what DeMille had done previously or Creelman and Fort would do on down the road, it's mildly amusing and has a great concept.

Plot: Amos Burden (silent film superstar Rod La Rocque) is an Australian sheep rancher who journeys to the French Riviera to find his uncle. He and his backwoods friends ridicule the idea of the high life, but two months after Amos gets to Paris, he's as much a socialite as the rest. Of course, he has an ulterior motive: the love of Nadia Ramiroff (The Forbidden Woman's Jetta Goudal), a Russian princess who has fled to Paris after being forced into a loveless marriage. She's free of that, free of the Communists, and now on the market, but every man who attempts to woo her turns up dead. Will Amos be able to figure out who's killing her suitors before he becomes the guy's next victim?

As a mystery, it suffers from a lot of the problems early mystery films do (and, for that matter, many of today's as well), all of which can be found in Ebert's Movie Rules (it's pretty obvious who the killer is simply by process of elimination, for example). As a romance, it's sweet, if over-the-top; it is a melodrama, after all. Where it truly suffers, though, is on the back end. Neither Creelman nor Fort had really come into their own yet as screenwriters, and judging by this effort, Sloane was a workmanlike director at best. Still, looked at as an interesting archival B movie, it's worth checking out. ** ",1297209600,,3183,4.658362989323844
8225848,4,B000WVZ9A8,"This is a nice and above-average silent film in the romance/adventure genre, and being a Cecil B. DeMille production, it has a fair share of exotic, unusual or glamorous settings and costumes.  The first scenes already grabbed my attention because they are set in Outback Australia, complete with sheep, kangaroos and a boomerang-throwing hero who then heads off to the French Riviera to mingle with royalty and high society.  If that's not enough, throw in a beautiful Russian princess and a villain played by Noah Beery, and you have one of the many silent films featuring Rod La Rocque, of which, unfortunately, only very few are available at this time.  This makes ""The Coming of Amos"" somewhat special, and if Rod La Rocque's performance in this film is anything to go by, then we can only hope that more of his early, silent films will see the light of day before too long.  As Amos, Rod plays an Australian cowboy who visits the Riviera to meet his long-lost uncle - and in the process learn to be a gentleman.  While not quite a `Crocodile Dundee' character, he does have a suitcase full of huge boomerangs and other Australian sheep-shearing paraphernalia, but it's his boomerang-throwing which really impressed me; first in his native Outback, then in his uncle's luxurious villa to demonstrate the skill to members of the aristocracy and high society, and finally to incapacitate the bad guys who try to abduct his beloved princess.  Not even we real Aussies can do that!  There are other fun and light moments balancing out the dark side surrounding the mysterious deaths of three of the princess's admirers and suitors.  Amos finds himself in danger, but like all good -and somewhat predictable - romance adventures, defeats the bad guys and wins the girl in the end.  While nothing outstanding or special, this film is well done with good acting in interesting locations, and the overall picture quality is quite good with only a small degree of too much whiteness, which is common with old films.  The musical score has not been specifically composed for this film, which means various recordings, mostly classical, orchestral, have been put together to accompany the film, and for the most part they match the scenes quite well, especially in the beginning where some traditional Australian folk tunes are played to accompany the Outback scenes.  But the highlight just has to be those boomerangs!",1211846400,2,2413,4.933333333333334

Jef films can be a little pricey but they do release obscure titles. music score is very good quality on this one. The print quality is not bad and is from direct 16mm reduction print transfer.",1207440000,2,327,4.290322580645161
