6104565,4,B00GRZPRB4,I saw it on Netflix. It was pretty good to me. it was not the best but it was pretty good for a wall mart bargain bin movie.,1398211200,3,124,3.4642857142857144
6104566,4,B00GRZPRB4,This was actually pretty good. It really exposed the brutality found in both genders. Typically we only see this kind of behavior in shows like Oz or Lock Up. Women can be just as tough.,1396396800,7,186,4.3428571428571425
6104567,3,B00GRZPRB4,"If you're looking for a poignant drama about the prison system and a girl's struggle against the odds to survive in prison, then this movie may not be for you.  If you're looking for ample on screen sex and gratuitous nudity then you've come to the right place.  It's not a terrible movie, it's not terribly acted out, but it doesn't quite deliver on the drama aspect.  Then again it's from The Asylum so it's not expected to be Oscar material.  If you like Skinemax movies and jail sexploitation then you could do a lot worse than this one.",1395878400,36,541,4.434343434343434
6104568,3,B00GRZPRB4,"Anna Nix (Sara Malakul Lane) kills her step father in self defense. She is sentenced to be in a nubile prison sexplotation film filled with drugs, shower scenes, a rapist warden, and girl/girl action. Oh yeah, she plays a cello.

The acting was what one would expect from an Asylum film as they used their regular stars. The dialog wasn't great, but if the object is to watch 30 year old Sara Malakul Lane undress looking like 17, then the film achieved its goal. There is no watching the film for any deep underlying message, nor would I call it a film about redemption. It is a prison girl film. Not as great as ""Chained Heat"" but meets the requirements.

Perv guide: F-bombs, sex, rape, girl/girl full frontal nudity (Sara Malakul Lane, Erin O'Brien, Jennifer Robyn Jacobs + others)",1392854400,166,785,4.640287769784172

6104645,2,B00GRZPRB4,"""Jailbait"" is only a mediocre film from 2014. it is currently available on NetFlix Instant Download Streaming. Anna is a nice girl, a good student, plays the cello and is raped regularly by her old stepfather. Her mother pretends nothing is going on. One day when he again tries to rape her she pushes him away into a window, the pieces sever his carotid and he dies.

Anna ends up in jail. Her cell mate is also nice and just keeps to herself reading books but develops a romantic interest in Anna. Anna attempts to mind her own business and not bother anyone which doesn't go well in jail. But she quickly catches the attention of Kody, the leader of one of the inmate groups. But Kody only has relatively good intentions when it comes to Anna. The leader of the rival group also notices Anna but she is only interested in beating her up.

Reluctantly Anna joins Kody's group as refuge. But they can't help her with the warden who seems fairly nice on the surface but quickly takes advantage of her. Kody introduces Anna to drugs but sticks only to smoking. Anna meanwhile keeps getting herself in trouble, rejects the help of Kody, ends up in solitary confinement repeatedly, and starts injecting hard drugs. Things quickly go downhill for Anna. She becomes addicted, ends up in a longer stint in solitary, tries to commit suicide, ends up in the psych ward, the warden continues to abuse her. To help her though he gives her a cello to practice for the talent show. Anna has a parole hearing coming up and the warden promises to put in a good for her if she continues doing him ""favors."" When the day arrives, of course, he doesn't keep his word which forces Anna to think of another way out. I was only able to give it 2 stars. Dale Haufrect",1434153600,2,1746,4.470219435736677

In there, she tries to survive from a perverted warden, all inmates and situations involving rape, prison showers, girl-on-girl action and trying to stay alive to get out. Based on a graphic novel and originally titled ""17 & Life"", This movie seems to get what everything that women-in-prison movies from the 70's and 80's don't have and lack of. No offense.

The producers of this one weren't entirely sure whether or not they wanted to copy ""Orange is the New Black"" or go for a more R-rated sexploitation approach --- and so they tried both and didn't really succeed at either level.  Still, the girl on the DVD box-cover is certainly pretty, and with a few decadent predatory-lesbian prison guards, inmates, and/or warden added this one might have been awesome.  As is, it's passable-at-best, just not all that great.  The campy, FANTASY-approach to women-in-prison films is always the best way to go, but there simply aren't all that many talented & creative directors/writers/producers out there who understand this!",1423180800,,768,5.071428571428571

6104670,5,B00GRZPRB4,"Sara Malakul Lane has the leading role in this film as a coy young musician named Anna.  Sara has an exotic & yet innocent beauty, which makes her PERFECT for this part.  She is incessantly molested by her stepfather and one day accidentally kills him in self defense (this is hardly spoiler material as it happens in the opening moments of the story).  As a result she is sent to prison;  a grave injustice.

Like Pepper in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Orange-Is-the-New-Black-Season-1/dp/B00HW3EXCE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Orange Is the New Black: Season 1</a>, Anna wants to keep a low profile, be left alone, do her time quietly and get out.  Unfortunately, also like Pepper, her stunning beauty makes her the ""center of attention"" in a prison where none of the other women can really compete with her lovely visage.

Such is the backdrop of the story.  Sara has an exquisite body and is not shy about showing it off.  It has a higher ratio of nudity than a lot of WBB movies, and in my book that's a very good thing!  This is what also gears it towards being a more ""mainstream"" softcore women's prison flick than what ORANGE is.

If you're a fan of the WBB genre, then this 1 should be @ the top of your list.  It is erotic, sexy, disturbing and alluring all in one.  If you're not in love with Anna by the end of the film, then you must not be anything like me!!",1416268800,20,1418,4.7860082304526745

6104680,3,B00GRZPRB4,"This is a women prison movie.  Shower scenes are standard.  Sex scenes are stimulating and imaginary.

The story, to me, laughed upon Court Justice.  A teen musician was nearly raped.  In her struggle, she kicked away an old and drunk man whose head got hit and died instantly.  A good opening?  The judge did not take her words.  This girl was sentenced to jail.  A bad opening instead.  Where was the detailed investigation on her self defense from police?  This movie plays no role into it.

Inside a prison, she shared a cell with one roommate.  Gangsters pushed her for same-sex.  She was often beaten for not doing as told.  Worst, the warden in his 50's was a rapist.  She had been medically treated by a in-house nurse several times.  This nurse, to me, was a bonehead.  Without outside help, she tended to believe her patient's story and offered verbal help to disclose the
evil events.  Guess what?  In a locker room, an inmate killed this nurse from behind.  Again, there was no detailed police
investigation on this murder cover-up.  Ah, the evil warden continued raping his prisoners.  In the last twist, he himself was arrested by the appeal board.  Watch this movie to find out how.",1412208000,5,1197,4.671497584541063

6104695,3,B00GRZPRB4,"""Jailbait"" is not as good as ""Reform School Girls,"" but does stand on its own.  Do not look too closely at the gaping holes in this piece. Girl from a poor family must endure abuse from her drunken stepfather.  Yet, the heroin has a perfect boob job.

She gets her ass kicked and his covered in bruises.  She returns from the nurses office to engage in some sex with her cell mate.  All of the black and blue marks have magically disappeared.

She is also able to produce magic money (that comes from someplace) to get herself strung out on drugs.  No rhyme or reason, the film tries to shock with hits and misses.  Some of it just so silly it will cause the viewer to laugh out loud.

The film has so many holes, it is like a piece of Swiss Cheese.",1404086400,16,749,4.181818181818182
6104696,3,B00GRZPRB4,"Watching this movie, I wondered why someone so sweet and pretty and clean looking as the lead actress kept doing nude scenes.  This movie is similar to those 70s exploitation films made in the Philippines and often starring Pam Grier in terms of cheap bare sets and spare dialogue and kind of nonsensical but horrible situations.

And then the contradictions in the storyline made me think that this is the companion to I Spit On Your Grave which was famous in my high school years but I never watched until about a year ago and I advise that everyone wait til they are older to watch that movie.

There is NO WAY that anyone would star in I Spit On Your Grave out of narcissism.  I think it was an act of kindness on the part of the female lead to further expose the lies about rape and blaming the victim by really showing brutality towards someone so pretty that you would have to be a real dirtbag to hurt them.

That's why Sarah Malukul Lane is cast because you just want to smooth her hair back and buy her a creamy cable knit sweater not hurt her as she is repeatedly hurt in this movie.

PLUS the people who hurt her also offer her a helping hand because they LIKE her so that is definitely addressing the claims by rapists and mutilators that actually they just had a bad day or they actually lurve their victims.

This movie is more than its nude scenes but those nude scenes say a lot about the actress willing to make them because throughout she is really nice as a person and very vulnerable and she keeps being hurt as if - as the Chinese say - the sky has no eye.

It's kind of stunning that three movies together tell a tale, make a statement about rape and respond to the excuses and lies of rapists and those who are pro-rape.

In order, you should watch

I Spit On Your Grave

6104698,4,B00GRZPRB4,"As fan of 'women in prison' flix I found the movie ""JAILBAIT"" to provide a very acceptable, albeit rather 'by the numbers', modern foray into the venerable WIP genre of exploitation movies. Pretty much all the 'stock' action that one has come to expect and enjoy from the incarcerated females scenario are present: a 'wrongfully accused' heroine, the de-rigeur humiliating body cavity search, lotsa communal showers, a despicable warden, inter-racial tensions, lesbian love-ins, bad cafeteria food, AND full nudity abound.

The lead actress (Sara Malakul Lane) does a credible job as the sexually abused teenager (with outstanding cello playing skills!) who gets 'sent up the river' after accidentally killing her lecherous step dad while he is in mid molestation mode - though her purported 17 yr old persona is somewhat challenged when she removes her clothes (which she does A LOT!) to reveal a body that looks like it's got a few more years on it than advertised (but is VERY pleasing to behold, nonetheless!). She's got great freckles, and can even act - as her 'character' must come to grips with the brutal realities of prison life.

The plot moves forward with a satisfying predictability and decent performances all around - nothing really 'new' here - but then why mess with a successful formula?! A light weight and enjoyable viewing experience if you are a fan of women in the slammer flix.",1401926400,38,1402,5.012875536480687
6104699,4,B00GRZPRB4,"The only thing I know about The Asylum as a studio they tend to have a representation of making bad or gulity pleasure cinema  - kind of like how Troma use to be back in the 1980s and early 90s.  This is the first time I've watched any movies by this studio and to my surprise I was quite pleased with it's effort.

Jailbait pretty much wastes no time with it's gritty nature.  The character Anna is cello player and also makes good grades at school, but end up in prison over defending herself when her step-father tries to rape Anna in her bedroom.  Anna's mother even defends him and is glad Anna is in prison over the crime since he was the breadwinner in their household.  Anna is faced with scary realities of prison life: gang attacks, rapist warden, and drug addiction all in the matter of a 1 1/2 hr film.  Oh, and let's not forget, her fair share in lesbian sex!

While Jailbait is fast paced affair, the acting isn't Oscar worthy and has a basic plot - prison is no social gathering especially for a 17 year old girl.  I still found it entertaining to pass the time.",1401321600,3,1077,4.292079207920792

6104702,3,B00GRZPRB4,"The first time I saw this movie, I was working on a document and half paying attention to it.  In that regard, I found it interesting.  The story is what you would expect of the horrors of prison and what it could do to good people.  It reminded me of Orange is the New Black show.  It was interesting enough to watch it a second time with my full interest.  It was here that it fell apart.  I found the acting to be good, along with the camera direction.  The story, however, was too much.  There was nothing wrong with the elements, there were just too many of them, and split among time, each major event seemed to pass by too quickly and without the needed weight.  As for the nudity, I am a fan of the female form, but the ladies seemed to be stripping down too often for reasons that did not advance the story.  Some can be used to illustrate the loss of normal boundaries in prison, but much more could have been eluded to, or covered with camera angles.  I was also suspicious of the ending, but with no knowledge of the realities of such a situation, I could not comment on it.  Overall, I enjoyed it in that I did not hate myself for watching it.  I would not recommend to buy it sight unseen, but if you like an over-sexual prison stories, then I suggest a rent, but if you are looking for a good prison story, I would suggest elsewhere.",1400284800,11,1348,4.198443579766537

6104705,4,B00GRZPRB4,"Bad prison movie as it depicts juvenile prisons completely WRONG.  It is hard for corrections officers much less administrators to do things to juvenile prisoners.  THEIR safety is first and VERY guarded in every state.  They can't just use MACE whenever they want.  The way they break up fights saying ""play nice"" is RIDICULOUS and spraying mace on a girl not even fighting is HYSTERICAL.  CONFINEMENT is hardly used because of STUPID rights groups.

Also the juveniles have more drugs in the prison than in the real world, NOT real.

BUT the main character have BIG ASS TITTIES!! REALLY nice and PERFECT.  It's probably how she got the job, and they really took liberty with those as every time there's an opportunity her shirt gets ripped off,  RIIIIIGHHHT OFF!  YIPPEEE!!

I was disappointed with one thing in particular.  There are many naturally looking beautiful women in this film, however, the lead, Sara Malakul Lane, is not one of them.  There is a scene where she is forced to strip and her breasts look so artificial.  I found the other women in the film to be hotter.
