8319760,5,B001LTZ5MW,Great start for learning face painting. Basic techniques explained simply and clearly. There were many things about the process I assumed wrong before viewing this DVD that were corrected by it. Kudos to the author. Halloween is going to be a lot more interesting because of this vid. :),1499040000,,287,4.877551020408164
8319761,4,B001LTZ5MW,This is for my daughter who wants to start painting faces and she is watching it over and over again. So far she has learned a few pointers and so I am just letting her do her thing.,1476057600,,182,3.8157894736842106
8319762,5,B001LTZ5MW,"This DVD has a lot of great technique and instructions on how to apply paint, what kind of paint to use and what kind of designs to use. I got this DVD for my daughter that does a lot of fairs around town and she does a lot of different things but she wanted to get into face painting. After only one watch she was already much better.  The little tricks that you learn are great. A must have if you do a lot of face painting and want to put out the best product possible.",1474675200,,472,3.9166666666666665
8319763,5,B001LTZ5MW,"Love this DVD and it's going to be handy in our party business as we've really started to ramp things up with around 3-4 parties every weekend. What I really love about this DVD is that it not only covers fairies, harlequins and butterflies but it demonstrates a number of different variations within each. Easy step by step instructions that are simple and great for anyone looking for some inspiration or a base to create their own individual looks. Highly recommend!",1415491200,,469,4.802469135802469
