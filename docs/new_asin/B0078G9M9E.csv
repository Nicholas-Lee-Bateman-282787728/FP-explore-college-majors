8532726,5,B0078G9M9E,"From Joel, Frank, Trace, Josh and MaryJo of MST3K fame. The movie is awful as usual but the riffing makes it hilarious and that's why the fans watch. If you like, or love, Mystery Science Theater 3000, you'll love Cinematic Titanic, the aforementioned 5's new project.",1363996800,,268,4.8478260869565215
