8543798,5,B0085O88DO,"One of the most underrated movie stars today! Luke Goss is a truly amazing actor!  Sexy, talented, and committed - Luke Goss is a God on screeen.  All of Goss' movies has thoroughly entertained and fascinated me, and Interview With A Hitman is no exception!
Like a haunting symphony, Interview With A Hitman, plays to its audience with pure raw emotions and elemental sanctions. Drawing its viewer upwards into a cresendo of pain of a young boy living in squalor, making the decision of survival he is recruited (and excels) in the underbelly of Mob culture. Goss' intonation of the lyrical-esque art of assisination and stealth sent chills down my spine.
Perry Bhandal weaves a tale of strength, vengenance, survival and will leave you begging for more.",1355443200,5,754,4.929133858267717
