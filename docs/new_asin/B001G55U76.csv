3595679,4,B001G55U76,"Ferry certainly works well with a variety of musicians. The two concerts included make this well worth the price of admission, also these are not mere copies of each other, each Ferry concert video encompases a different style even though some of the songs may be the same.",1284249600,2,273,4.708333333333333
3595680,5,B001G55U76,"I wore out my copy of the VHS version of New Town, so I jumped at the chance to get this on DVD.  And to getting a 2nd concert is an extra treat.  If you're a Bryan Ferry/Roxy Music fan, you won't be disappointed.",1271289600,8,213,3.8181818181818183
3595681,4,B001G55U76,I owned a VHS copy back in 1990 and I wore it out.  This is a perfect introduction to Bryan Ferry.  It's a must have for any Bryan Ferry or Roxy Music fan.  I love the way the original concert was filmed.  It highlighted Ferry and the band very well.  The performance was intoxicatiing and in my opinion probably one his better filmed projects.  The only thing that would have enhanced this package would have been behind the scene footage or interviews or even rehearsals.  I would reccomend this whole heartedly.,1269043200,10,514,4.582417582417582
3595682,5,B001G55U76,"All I can say is that Roxy Music and Bryan Ferry are among my top three bands of all time. These two concerts are prime examples why Bryan Ferry is a master. I also highly recommend ""Roxy Music Live At The Apollo"" if you don't already own that.",1256083200,3,244,4.104166666666667
3595683,5,B001G55U76,This was Bryan Ferry's finest moment. Thanks to Importcd for ending a 20 year wait,1243296000,8,82,4.533333333333333
3595684,4,B001G55U76,"In my opinion this dvd is worth purchasing simply for the inclusion of ""The Thrill Of It All"". Lucy Wilkins' violin brings so much to this live track.  The dancing girls who double as back up singers (although I can't be sure they are actually singing) are a cute touch and are reminiscent of the Sirens from Roxy Music's Siren tour.

The Bete Noir tour section has some of the best live Ferry performances I have ever seen and a nice mix of Ferry and Roxy Music tunes. The standout for me is ""The Chosen One"" Although there is an amazing performance of ""Ladytron"" included as well.",1240272000,7,582,4.429906542056075
3595685,5,B001G55U76,"I was well pleased by this German-made disc featuring shows from 1988 and
2002 by the undisputed ""Coolest Living Englishman,"" Bryan Ferry, and his
handpicked backing bands.  If you are tired of the mediocre music stars
of today, a dose of Mr. Ferry tingles like a refreshing Bombay Gin and Tonic
with lemon at Raffles Hotel Bar of Singapore (a favorite Ferry haunt).

  The concerts plumb Ferry's (and Roxy Music's) catalog of wonderful,
sophisticated rockers and torch songs dating back to 1972 (when the
""Roxy Music"" debut album offered a bracing new direction away from the tired
""long-haired hippie"" blues-rock of the sixties).  Bryan Ferry was the first  singer
of hard rock to dare to wear a tuxedo over his aching heart, like Bogart in ""Casablanca.""
  He fashions for the listener a fantasy world of cool cars, gorgeous women, elegant art,
  exclusive clubs, & Savile Row suits, none of which can stanch his exquisite anguish.
  He is like nocturnal James Bond gambling and smooth-talking dolls at ""Le Cercle"" Club.

  Ferry's anguish delivers our delight as he croons and roars hits from
""Ladytron"" to ""Avalon.""  It's a pleasure to report he looks just as
dashingly handsome in the 2002 show as he does in the 1988 one.  The 140
minute disc has excellent sound and picture quality.  Only by adding
Phil Manzanera and Andy Mackay (of Roxy Music) could this have been better.
You will see Roxy drummer The Great Paul Thompson's round face looming like
an orange full moon just above Mr. Ferry in the 2002 concert, thanks to a
telephoto lens setting.  One wonders what Bryan thought of this visual choice.",1238112000,17,1610,4.852941176470588
3595686,5,B001G55U76,"THe NTSC version is available from Amazon Canada!!  'Made in Canada' by Virgin, this is an essential dvd for the Ferry/ROxy fan....Why it's not released or available through US merchants befuddles me.  I've been waiting for this ever since dvd format came out.  I'll keep this short.  Both concerts are amazing. The '88 tour is the old New Town VHS, but greatly upgraded. The '02 show, shot in Munich is awesome, Ferry the class act pulls off a great performance, mind you 30 years into his career. It's very similiar to Roxy's Live at the Apollo dvd...I watched this show 2 nights in a row!!! Get the NTSC version, it's out there!!!!",1232582400,14,634,4.633928571428571
3595687,5,B001G55U76,"This DVD contains some stunning performances and slightly disappointing ones as well. The standout are New Town, Wasteland-Windswept,Limbo, essentially all of the Bete Noire tour. The Konixxtreffen concert is an outdoor performance and sounds very dry. Also,Ferry seems fatigued. At any rate, this DVD is a must have for any Roxy Music/Ferry fan.",1232409600,7,346,5.547169811320755

3595689,5,B001G55U76,"I had the previous version of this, when it was only one disc and this compilation is even better. If you're a Bryan Ferry fan, you're going to love it! If you aren't one yet, this will convince you.",1416182400,,199,4.128205128205129

3595692,5,B001G55U76,"I had the original ""New Town"" 1986 video on VHS and had been waiting for it to finally be released on DVD...... and here it is with a differtent title! With an added Konixxtreffen 2002 performance (in much better video quality). Great recording on both. Video quality is not the best on the 1986 performance but they didn't have to technology they do today.",1396396800,,357,4.59375
3595693,5,B001G55U76,"Burn Fiery strikes again. Anyone seeking to pick fault with this magnificent DVD really has their work cut out for them. Not only are the performances simply top notch, the song selection is almost faultless. Yes, there are a few more titles I would like to have seen here but this massive track list is a stunning cross section of the man's epic contribution to the world of music. This is a visual and aural feast for the Brin Fury fan that I cannot recommend highly enough.",1380758400,,476,4.482758620689655
3595694,4,B001G55U76,"Bryan Ferry has always been a favorite of mine so Id thought I would get this dvd and see how it is. The dvd has 2 concerts on the disc. The first concert was back in 1988 on his Bete Noire tour and it is the best concert out of the two. It has a lot of his best songs on there, and his band playing behind him are amazingly talented. The only problem with the first concert was the footage that was shot was really grainy and old like they copied the concert off an old vhs tape, but other than that everything was awesome including the sound which sounded really good! The second concert on the disc was I believe from 2002 and I thought the show was put on really bad. While watching the second concert I was watching the audiences reaction to Ferry and they weren't getting into his music at all, they all had a look on their faces like, ""Who is this guy and what is he playing"". There was just no energy in that performance at all, I know that Mr. Ferry didn't have his energy and charisma like he did in the 80's concert, but still, people should of respected him more and had more fun with him cause after all he is a very talented singer and musician and alot of people have forgotten about him especially in the states. It's a great dvd to own if your a fan as long as you skip the 2002 concert and just watch the one from the 80's, I guarantee you will love that one.",1367625600,,1377,4.0661764705882355
3595695,4,B001G55U76,"I was lucky in NYC in 1988 to see Bob Dylan at Radio City, Leonard Cohen at The Beacon Theater, and Bryan Ferry at Radio City. All three artists were at peaks of their performing career. The ""Bete Noire Tour"" is a fleshed-out version of the old VHS tape ""New Town"". The '88-89 performances are more energetic & intense. I remember thinking when I saw the BF show, that there was absolutely no reason for him to play obscure old Roxy Music songs like ""The Bogus Man"", ""Ladytron"" & ""Casanova"", except to delight his intense fans like me (and because he obviously loves them). Those songs were not hits in Europe or the US, but he delivered stellar versions. Great band, except the big-haired, flashy, metal-styled guitarist is a little out of place. The 2nd guitarist is much classier, & BF is all about class. Andy Newmark is a killer drummer, & the percussionist is obviously having a lot of fun. A lot of smiling at the thrill of it all.

The bonus 2002 performance is fascinating, if a little more erratic. The band is much the same as for the Roxy Music reunion that would follow a year later, except without the essential Phil Manzanera & Andy Mckay. Though Paul Thompson has turned into a scary-looking lug, he is still a phenomenal drummer. Ferry delivers strong versions of Dylan's ""It's All Over Now, Baby Blue"" & ""Don't Think Twice it's Alright"". Miles above his mediocre ""Dylanesque"" DVD. Bryan sweats a lot at this gig, & you wish someone would hand him a towel. (Though we all wish we could look & sing that good at age 59.) I think somewhere after the half-way point, the energy starts to flag. ""Jealous Guy"" is always strong, but ""Let's Stick Together"" sounds strained or off vocally, & ""Love is the Drug"", just perfunctory. Nice setting though, outdoors at night. For $13 out-the-door, this 2.5 hour DVD was a screaming bargain. Roxy Music ""Live at the Apollo"" & ""Musikladen"" are both recommended too!",1358985600,5,1916,4.635294117647059
3595696,5,B001G55U76,"First of all as soon as I saw this on dvd had to get just for the upgrade from VHS, which happen to get worn out from to much play. Sounds excellent plus you get a bonus concert from Mr. Ferry, although not quite up to snuff as ""Bete Noire"", there is still some nice tracks especially from the Roxy days. Always loved ""flesh + blood"" to hear ""my only love"" and ""oh yeah!"" were worth the extras alone. But back to the excellent  ""Bete Noire"" the standout tracks for me(every song is great by the way) were ""In every dream home a heartache"" and the amazing ""Avalon"" where even Mr. Ferry is amazed by the extraodinare vocals of Ms. Etienne.",1357603200,,637,4.264462809917355
3595697,5,B001G55U76,"I know this DVD has been out for a while but it was NEW to me. I was CRAVING some NEW Ferry/Roxy PERFORMANCE DVD's(with 5.1 sound preferred!)Enter the BETE NOIRE TOUR dvd.....with the use of grainy film stock(color&B/W)combined with the atmosphere of Ferry's musical vision make for ONE OUTSTANDING ""Home Theatre-5.1"" EXPERIENCE!The only DISSAPOINTMENT here is the LACK OF of ""optional"" LYRIC below the the VIDEO PERFORMANCE.I'm an avid fan who got to meet BRYAN FERRY way back in 1985 at the ""HARD ROCK"" in Dallas a few years before the BETE NIORE(Black Beast)Tour. I BELEIVE THAT ALL CONCERT PERFORMANCE DVD's SHOULD ALLOW THE VIEWER TO ENJOY THE POETRY(lyric)AS AN ALL ENGAGING PERFORMANCE EXPERIENCE!So it may cost more for MUSIC LYRIC PUBLISHING but I ask you...(ALL MUSIC LEGENDS)...Don't you want your COMPLEAT MUSICAL CREATIONS to be PRESERVED for ""FUTURE GENERATIONS""?Some of my FAVOURITE music concert DVD's...(Roxy at the Apollo,Clapton at Hyde Park and Roger Waters-Live in the flesh)ALL ALLOW You to experience this which I speak. MY ONLY HOPE IS THAT THE DVDMUSIC PRODUCERS WILL IMMEDIATELY MAKE THIS THE ""STANDARD"" and NOT the EXCEPTION!...but I rant,The BEST PART OF THIS ""DBL. CONCERT DVD is the UNRELEASED concert from 2002 ""KONIXXTREFFEN BENIFIT"",musically RAW(2.0)& SIMPLY AMAZING!THIS ONE PERFORMANCE IS WORTH THE PRICE OF THE ""BETE NOIRE TOUR '88/'89 TOUR.....ENJOY AS I HAVE.

3595698,5,B001G55U76,"Seemed to take forever for them to put this gem on dvd. Had it on vhs. Waited and waited. Bryan is at the top of his form with fantastic band. Good camera work, great sound. This has it all. Bonus is an extra concert not on the vhs.",1293753600,,232,3.8541666666666665
8303872,5,B001G55U76,"I have never been a big Bryan Ferry fan, but I really enjoyed this DVD.  The arrangements and Ferry's intensity lens an air of mystery to the performances. The backup singers are excellent.  One of them is Ednah Holt who appeared in Stop Making Sense with the Talking Heads 4-5 years earlier.  Note:  comments are only about Bete Noir concert.  I haven't watched the 2002 concert includes on the DVD yet.",1497052800,,404,4.633802816901408

8303874,5,B001G55U76,"I guess I'm getting old!  I bought the dvd not realizing this is the same as my VHS of ""NEW TOWN""... but that's ok.  We don't have a VHS player anymore, so it was great to see this 1988/89 concert from the same tour I saw (when he played Boston to support his, then, new album).

28 years later, the Bete Noire film is, frankly, over-produced and does not show enough contiguous on-screen Bryan Ferry.

Hold on though! What I absolutely love about this dvd is that the bonus 2002 concert is one I have not seen before!!
The 2002 concert has a more live video appearance.  There's lots of Bryan Ferry (poor guy works hard- can't someone give him a towel?).  Paul Thompson is on drums.  The guitar playing and supporting musicians are great.  The song selection is great.",1472342400,,769,4.442857142857143
