8436010,4,B004MFFB4E,"This is the story of a handsome local veternarian, his romance, the horse ranching community he serves, and a deadly disease outbreak among the horses. It starts off told from the point of view of a visiting friend who is a novelist. This film also features a Cairn Terrier among the ranch's animals. Although the writing and romantic chemistry are a little weak, there are plenty of plot twists, lots of silly science, cute kids, handsome actors, lovely animals, and open air western sets. Fans of the young Ronald Regan will be pleased.",1354665600,,538,4.795698924731183
