8271279,4,B0018V9BSM,"My Daughter's Secret has quite a stupid scenario, a couple of not too bright brothers drag the wussier of the two's school aged girlfriend along with them to rob the jewelry store that her mother works at which she had no idea was about to happen.  They then tell her she is an accessory so better not tell on them or she'll go to jail too.  Why they brought her in the first place makes no sense but that's the scenario for the movie, the kind to her and her mother jewelry store owner was shot so she has that playing on her guilt as well too. As the aftermath gets worse the angry psychotic brother puts more and more pressure on his wussier brother to keep her in line or else.

Stupid scenario aside, the girl (Nina Dobrev) playing the school kid does a pretty good acting job dealing with the trauma of finding out your boyfriend is an armed robber, the fact she could go to jail and being the daughter of a single mother who had already forbidden her from seeing the 21 year old man and is concerned she is affected by the aftermath of the robbery simply because her mother worked there and they knew the owner well.  The mother (Jennifer Grant) does an okay job too, the robber brothers and police actors, not the best though, for a film made in 2007 none of the actors from the main two to the minor parts seem to have gone on to much since then but I'd watch another film with either the mother Dobrev or Grant in it.

The movie follow a pretty predictable per robbery plot for the scenario.  The ending is pretty laughable and not realistic at all but again you pretty much saw that coming too.  But this is a movie if you're likely to be coming across for a few dollars at most in the budget couple of dollars stand at a chemist, supermarket or discount store and if you've looked this up to see if you should get this over one of the others, definitely give it a go.",1447027200,,1879,4.217270194986073
