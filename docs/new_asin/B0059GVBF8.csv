4620859,5,B0059GVBF8,"I got this DVD about a week ago, and I already have the songs in my head!  I even found myself walking down the street humming ""I Just Can't Sleep on Christmas Eve""!  It's not that these songs are too simple, but they are so very catchy!  And I especially love the Twelve Days of Christmas.  Anthony always makes me laugh.  And Sam is so beautiful on ""Cherry Tree Carol"", ""We Three Kings"", and ""Little Drummer Boy"".  All in all, great job, Wiggles!  And, dare I say it, it's just a hair better than Ukulele Baby!",1323561600,,512,4.270833333333333

4620862,3,B0059GVBF8,I bought this video and was very diappointed that my baby was not into it..and she worships the Wiggles! It is a good video for much older kids...it is just over the little ones heads and is more entertaining for adults if you ask me...Not enough Wiggly songs and movement and color to keep my little one interested..I think they tried too hard to do something different.,1323216000,5,371,4.552238805970149
4620863,5,B0059GVBF8,"This is a great DVD. My kids love it. I particularly like ""The Twelve Days of Christmas"", and Anuna, the Irish choir who feature on four tracks, really add something special to the sound of the songs. Well done Wiggles! Ireland never looked more beautiful.",1322870400,,256,4.711111111111111
4620864,5,B0059GVBF8,"What a Wonderful NEW DVD from The Wiggles.  The Wiggles never fail to create an awesome DVDS.
This new DVD features some beautiful new and old Christmas tunes.  My favorites were
Miracle In A Manger, Jeff Just Can't Sleep On Christmas Eave and the one Anthony does called, The
Twelve Days Of Christmas.  The entire DVD was entertaining.  There were a few wonderful guests
on this DVD, including a group from Ireland that sing beautifully.  There are lots and lots of
wonderful songs and special treats.  There are not enough positive words to describe this DVD.
There was a beautiful rendition of one Holy Night...sung be a member of N'Sync as well.
If you love Christmas and if you love the Wiggles.  You will NOT be disappointed!

4620865,5,B0059GVBF8,"I have been waiting for another Christmas video, from the Wiggles, to come out.  This video is great.  I pre-ordered it on Amazon and since it has come my kids have watched nothing else.  Even my 'I'm too cool for Wiggles' 11 year old loves to sing and dance along with this video (her favorite song is Jeff's ""Just can't sleep on Christmas Eve"").  We also like the other Wiggles Christmas videos and watch them every year.  Thanks Wiggles!",1320537600,3,440,4.518987341772152

4620878,4,B0059GVBF8,"this was an Angel Tree  gift for a child that requested Wiggles (general request).

4620887,5,B0059GVBF8,"My kids have watched this so many times I've lost count. Really a lot of fun, and it hasn't gotten old yet (i.e. I haven't gotten sick of it, like I thought I might have by now). The animated Santa bonus is fun too.",1347840000,,215,3.909090909090909
4620888,5,B0059GVBF8,"Our 1 1/2 year old is addicted to this DVD... it's been a month since Christmas and she still requests it daily.

This video is mostly songs, with spoken segments introducing each one, so it keeps our toddler's attention the whole time. The songs are about half baby Jesus songs and half Santa Claus songs, some old and some modern. The arrangements vary between rock'n'roll and folk, but they all sound great with Sam's voice and the guest singers. The music is well arranged and recorded and the traditional carols included are among my favorite versions of them, childrens album or not.

Visually the album is enjoyable to watch, with lots of smiles and group dancing the Wiggles are known for. A variety of settings are used, from studio sets to pretty locations in Ireland and Australia.

It looks like this video is going to go in our list along with A Charlie Brown Christmas and the Rudolph and Frosty videos as must-see every Christmas season, although from the looks of things this one is going to get played more times than all the others combined!",1327104000,4,1059,4.682795698924731
4620889,5,B0059GVBF8,"My kids are always riveted to the Wiggles and this Christmas DVD is no exception. The music is sometimes beautiful, sometimes fun, and dynamic.  Another thing I liked is that this DVD doesn't go out of the way to make sure to represent all religious holidays.  Make no mistake about it; this is a Christmas DVD- and there's nothing wrong with that.",1327104000,3,348,4.596774193548387
4620890,5,B0059GVBF8,"Cute video, great scenery, and wonderful Christmas songs. I'm a grandmother, and I enjoyed them along with my granddaughter. Some of the songs are very catchy and will revisit your memory at times. The video is also about the true meaning of Christmas...and as such, I was truly grateful.",1325980800,,288,4.8979591836734695
4620891,5,B0059GVBF8,I love this movie. My toddler is a big wiggles fan. The songs are catchy and fun to listen to. If you like the wiggles this will definitely get you and your kids moving.,1325808000,,169,4.0
4620892,4,B0059GVBF8,This item was a Christmas present for a 5 year old and according to her mother she played it over and over again because she loved it so much.,1325203200,,142,3.9310344827586206
4620893,3,B0059GVBF8,"My two and a half year old absolutely loves the Wiggles, but he lost interest in this video pretty quickly.  It is not the typical Wiggles with goofy and catchy songs.  Don't get me wrong, the Christmas songs are great and may interest older kids more.  The Irish choir was fantastic.  But, the choir and all the guest singers really lost my son's attention.  On top of that, there were some actual costume changes (not sure I've ever seen the Wiggles wear anything except the 4 colors before) and some performance scenes/video with the Irish choir.  At one point, my son even said ""is this Wiggles?""  Dare I say, the video is not low budget enough.  It's not consistent with the simple songs and skits that my son is used to.",1325030400,,726,4.488549618320611
4620894,5,B0059GVBF8,"My son really likes the Wiggles, and this latest DVD did not disappoint.  Very sweet and fun way to learn about Christmas around the world.",1324252800,,139,4.56
4620895,5,B0059GVBF8,"My 23month old loves this. Also enjoyable for parent to watch over & over & over. In one day he was hooked in by Little Drummer Boy & 12 Days of Christmas, specifically Captain Feathersword screaming ""5 Golden Riiiings!"" I can't stand it, but it makes him happy! Also the Bobby wants a puppy dog -- my son loves anything DOG on our TV. My husband & I can't stop singing the title song ""It's Always Christmas with you."" VERY catchy, and in true Wiggles-fashion I cannot get it out of my head. Love all the shots in Ireland & hearing all the traditional Christmas music, like ""O Holy Night."" SO glad my 2yr old is learning these songs! THank you wiggles!!!!! :)",1323648000,,659,4.365853658536586
