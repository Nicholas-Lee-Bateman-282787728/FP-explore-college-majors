2336838,5,B0009Y275S,"This film has a very retro 80s style of film making.  It's got some great 80s style synthesizer scores and the whole film has that great 80s feeling.  The film is slower-paced and it has a much lower body-count than its sequel, but I thought it's the better film.  The sequel was very good, but the gore scenes in this film are more effective and it has a memorable ending gore sequence; The sequel's ending was very disappointing compared to this film. It does have some flaws like becoming a little bit too talky in some spots and it should've had a higher body count because the main reason for seeing this type of film is for the gore, but it's still a classic. The story involves a couple moving into an apartment which was home to an evil deceased alchemist. Once there, he meets a tenant in the apartment who introduces him to something called ""Himalayan Yogurt."" When he eats the yogurt, it causes him to have these episodes that have him being consumed by slime because he's being slowly possessed by Zachary the alchemist. When he kills, he temporarily stops oozing slime and returns to normal. The slime guy goes after a homeless man and a hooker who displays a laughably bad acting performance when she's killed by the slime man. He then gets a thug in a gore scene that copies John Carpenter's THE THING. He also goes after another guy and then there's that really gruesome and prolonged sequence when he's killed at the end, and the only sex scene in the film has no nudity because they both have their clothes on. I personally didn't think the film delivered much in terms of atmosphere or interesting scenery. In between the gore there's character development, some suspense because you wonder when he'll start oozing slime again, and dialogue; some may think that some of this dialogue is boring. Whether or not you get bored during some parts may depend on whether you like Lamberson's directing style and if the films characters and story are interesting to you. His directing in SLIME CITY MASSACRE will probably be more appealing to many people; his directing in this is more geared towards fans of 70s and 80s low-budget horror.

I thought the DVD quality is great.  They did a good job with a cheap film that was made decades ago.",1346457600,,2253,4.6084788029925186

2336840,1,B0009Y275S,"Slime City (Greg Lamberson, 1988)

If you're a fan of cult horror films, you've probably heard of Street Trash, an infamous 1987 splatter comedy by Mike Muro. The year after, sleaze merchant Greg Lamberson made his debut with Slime City, a picture that rips off Street Trash in every conceivable way save the plot. Which, if you think about it, is kind of impressive; you take everything else from a movie and attach a completely different plot to it? I like that. Not enough to change my original rating, because it's still a low-budget piece of tripe with no worthwhile actors, fumble-fingered direction, and the most godawful soundtrack this side of Ravenous, but you've got to admire the guy's gall.

Plot: Alex (Robert C. Sabin, who aside from debuting in I Was a Teenage Zombie, has appeared in nothing but Lambersom flicks) moves into a new apartment in a not-so-good neighborhood. On the way in, Alex and his pal Jerry (T. J. Merrick, who never acted again) are greeted by Nicole (Ghoul School's Mary Huner), and they both immediately fall in lust. Which makes life kind of tough for Alex, who has a girlfriend (also played by Huner!) who just won't go there. So he's trying to keep his hands off his new neighbor, but she's coming on strong. Meanwhile, Roman (Dennis Embry, who also never acted again), who lives upstairs, invites Alex up for a meal and feeds him something Roman calls ""Himalayan yogurt.""It's not, of course; in fact, when Alex wakes up the next morning, he's covered in slime and has an almost irresistible urge to go out and kill people. Obviously, there's something very wrong going on in this building besides the rent-control corruption...

That Lamberson was able to lure Kealan Patrick Burke, one of the fastest-rising horror authors on the planet, to star in the sequel, 2010's Slime City Massacre (which I haven't seen yet), is some testament as to the lasting effect this movie has had, on at least one consciousness anyway. But man, is this movie awful. The acting isn't all that far above grade-school level, the direction not any better. Even the lighting is bad enough that there are times the movie looks as if it was shot on DV (and I don't mean that as a compliment). This is an amateur film in every respect, and not a good one at that. (Charles Pinion released Twisted Issues the same year, also an amateur film, but so much better than this.) You may want to watch it if you stumble across it just for some of the unintentional hilarity, but you'll regret that you wasted ninety minutes of your life on it afterwards. *",1299542400,,2565,4.682926829268292
2336841,5,B0009Y275S,"Slime City is a funky little b-movie along the lines of The Toxic Avenger and Class of Nuke Em' High. In fact, if the movie would have had some nudity, it would have had all the ingredients of a classic Troma movie. It starts out a little show, but this is one of those movies that gets better as it goes along.
Toward the end, Slime City becomes a gory, funny splatterfest. They just don't make them like this anymore. Actually they do, but not on a regular basis like they did in the 80's. If you want a movie full of gore, slime, and gross-out gags, Slime City is for you. If not, then why are on this page anyway?",1251504000,5,617,4.107438016528926
2336842,5,B0009Y275S,"SLIME CITY is a fantastic little micro-budget indie, right up there w/ BASKET CASE! Robert Sabin is Alex, the newest tenant in an apartment building full of oddballs. Alex is a nice guy w/ an equally nice girlfriend named Lori (Mary Huner). Of course, all this niceness cannot last, so Alex is soon seduced by his sultry neighbor, Nichole (also played by Huner); and winds up doing naughty things. Alex also has dinner w/ another neighbor named Roman, who serves him some green gloop and a strange liqur, supposedly left by a deceased alchemist named Zachary. Well, Alex wakes up one morning covered in slime, and has an irresistible urge to kill! Kill!! KILL!!! The gore effects that follow are very inventive, especially when considering the low-low budget! Alex is a tormented soul, and Lori must face him in the unbelievable climax, complete w/ dismemberment, decapitation, and a crawling brain! All setting my little black heart aquiver! Director Gregory Lamberson has fashioned a slippery classic of sickening (in a good way) proportions! Also included as a bonus feature is Lamberson's NAKED FEAR. In this one, Robert Sabin stars as an agoraphobe who hasn't left his apartment in ten years. He decides to take in a roomie, only to be caught up in a blood-drenched killing spree! The bodies pile up while the oblivious Sabin character finds love through a 900 number! NF is shot on video, yet has decent direction and enough of a story to make me overlook it's shortcomings. Both SLIME CITY and NAKED FEAR are perfect midnight snacks...",1196812800,3,1542,4.911877394636015
2336843,2,B0009Y275S,"""Slime City"" is best described as a student film. The effects, camera work, acting and overall production are on par with what one would expect from a bunch of film students tasked with making a feature film. There are a lot of missed opportunities that would have made this film much better. For one, the film is played seriously, where comedy in the vein of ""Re-Animator"" would have been a better idea. The story is similar to many other ""strange goings on for a new tenant in an apartment complex"" type films. The new tenant is surrounded by oddball neighbors and soon becomes engulfed in a bizarre plot to allow the rebirth of some long dead occultist. The main selling point of the film is its gross-out effects as characters are consumed by a slimey substance that causes them to kill to retain their human form. The effects would have worked better if this film had played as a comedy as they are too over the top to be realistic. The DVD is well done with an additional feature by the same director as well as commentary and four trailers. There is also a making of segment. The effort in making this film is commendable but the film itself just isn't very good. The print used also has some damage and scratches, etc. throughout. I guess if you are into low budget films like ""The Corpse Grinders"" and ""Blood Feast"", you might like this.",1129334400,8,1346,4.520491803278689

8070038,3,B0009Y275S,"Some of my favorite scuzzy, low-brow flicks from the 80s are Basket Case, Brain Damage, and Street Trash. I love when movies have that ""seedy underbelly of the big city"" atmosphere. I had high hopes that Slime City would be up there with these gritty low budget gems, and in some ways it is. Ultimately though, it's finest moments are greater than the sum of its parts. Don't get me wrong, I dig Slime City. When it picks up it's fun, entertaining, and charmingly bad. I won't be the 800th reviewer to go into the plot but the flick definitely holds its place in the pantheon of gritty, gory, low rent exploitation films like the ones I mentioned. There's some really solid moments of cheap gore and slimy, melty madnessespecially that gloriously gory climax scene! Unfortunately, its biggest downfall is that it moves slow in between the fun stuff and takes its time to get there. The Shock O Rama SE DVD comes with a bonus Greg Lamberson flick called Naked Fear (1999) which I haven't seen, but can't wait to check it out. In typical Shock O Rama form there's also a ton of extras and trailers. The way I know a film has left a positive impact on me is if I can see myself watching it over and over throughout the years, and Slime City definitely has that quality. I'm glad it's a part of my collection.",1475539200,,1305,4.441666666666666

8070040,4,B0009Y275S,"No nudity, but rather violent and featuring some of the worst acting the genre has to offer.  So, yeah, I liked it!

There's something about the dregs of indie 80s horror that breeds an uneasing atmosphere.  The writing and direction is awful and the acting can be completely stale.  But this manifests something of a horror-appropriate awkwardness at times, doesn't it?  Such is the case with Slime City, a film that doesn't go easy on the weirdness gas pedal.

When we meet Alex (Craig Sabin; Naked Fear, Slime City Massacre) he is looking for a new apartment with his girlfriend in hopes that this privacy from his old roommate will break his lady's chastity.  His frustrations are apparent and he seems to be getting tired of her, but he's quite interested in his promiscuous rocker down-the-hall neighbor who is actually played by the same actress as his girlfriend (Mary Huner; Undying Love).

Yearning for company Alex accepts a dinner invitation from an emo poet neighbor who serves green Himalayan yogurt for dinner and, somehow, Alex readily accepts a glass of some mysterious green fluid that was prepared decades ago by a purported alchemist!  He is told this directly right before he decides to take a sip.  Whatever bad stuff happens to him, he has it coming for being stupid!

Writer/director Greg Lamberson (Killer Rack) seems to follow hard in the footsteps of such delightfully stupid, gory, smutty and brutal predecessors as Street Trash (1987), The Toxic Avenger (1984) and Class of Nuke 'em High (1986).  After Alex's weird green yogurt and beverage dinner date, he has a clothes-on sex session with the slutty girl next store and wakes up covered in some manner of perhaps sexually transmissible slime.  His body is falling apart, oozing and leaking, with his skin about to slough off. Strangely, the only cure for this malady is to brutally bash in a hobo's head with a lead pipe!  Then, POOF!  He's clean, slimeless and normal again.  So, evidently Alex is now a raging were-slime monster.

As if taking after The Wolfman (1941) a fortune-teller gypsy warns his girlfriend of danger.  Meanwhile, Alex wanders around like some hooker-soliciting mummy wrapped up in gauze, secreting mucous.  He's like an addict.  He can't stop drinking this alchemical concoction that makes him slime out, and then he must subsequently kill to appease the evil slime.

Much to my surprise, there was no nudity at all.  And good for them, I guess.  While there is clearly a place in cheap horror for gratuitous nudity, this flick brings enough gore to the table that the women need only disrobe to put on a clean, slime-free blouse between scenes.  The real entertainment comes in the form of super gory sludgy scenes including mimicking The Thing's stomach mouth, a crawling brain, and an attacking headless animated body like The Reanimator (1985)there's a lot for gorehounds to enjoy here.

It turns out there's a greater plot afoot.  It involves Satan, the occult, resurrection, and all the jazz.  Kinda' dumb.  But for fans of ultra-low budget 80s horror and gore-slathered messy schlock, this should entertain you.",1466899200,,3125,4.957692307692308
