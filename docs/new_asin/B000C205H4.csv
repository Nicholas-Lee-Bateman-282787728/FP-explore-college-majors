2452126,5,B000C205H4,I still get the creeps as a gay man should I make myself remember certain scenes from this AAA+++ gay drama.  Really reveals the truth behind the mythos of gay men hitting on you straights!  Hahaha!  Just goes to show the extent to which the Gay Community has to go in terms of mythos and prejudice bashing!,1221955200,,307,4.350877192982456
2452127,2,B000C205H4,"Jason Paul Collum both wrote and directed this little film that resembles a gay 'Fatal Attraction' without the benefit of a tight script, good actors, suspense, or sophisticated effects and camera work.  Sadly it boils down to a fifteen-minute story spread out over an almost interminable 2 hours.

The story involves on Corin (Sean Michael Lambrecht), a 30-year old ad exec in a five-year bumpy relationship with 23-year old party boy Jake (Jeff Dylan Graham).  Corin's boss and friend Nancy (Brinke Stevens) understands Corin all too well, appreciates his relationship, but in attempting to relieve his work duties hires an assistant Elliot (Jerod Howard), a gender confused nerdy lad who is engaged to his lifelong chum Marti (Tina Ona Paukstelis) in a push from his mother (Judith O'Dea) to make things 'right'. Elliot is befriended by Corin, brought into Corin's and Jake's friendship, and Elliot and Marti and Corin and Jake begin socializing.  Elliot falls for Corin, comes out of the closet to the extreme dismay of Marti and his mother, and despite Elliot's friendship with Corin and Jake, he begins to stalk Corin.  Corin's rebuff of his advances leads to disaster and the film tumbles downhill from there.

Yes, some may view this weak little foray as being full of statements about love, obsession, relationships, and friendships, but all of that has been said far better before and without the seemingly tacked on genre of a horror film.  The acting from the women in the film is good, but the men are blunted stereotypes.  Everything about the film screams low budget.  One annoying factor - a music score that sounds like lessons on electronic keyboards and obscures a lot of the dialogue - turns out to be a blessing in that the weak script is covered frequently.  Most viewers will utilize the fast forward button to get through the repetitious dialogue and race for the end, a predictable, stagy tableaux that really doesn't resolve anything.  Not worth two hours of your viewing time.  Grady Harp, August 06",1155859200,7,2026,4.961538461538462
2452128,4,B000C205H4,"October Moon is a film that was made with a modest budget, yet still manages to tell a story from a unique (and seemingly untapped) genre: Gay Horror.

The charming Judith O' Dea (Night of the Living Dead) has a great supporting role as a nagging mother while Scream Queen Brinke Stevens lends her talents to the production as well.

Special Features include a commentary from the director and one of the leads. There's also a featurette where Jason Paul Collum discusses the film, and some of his own personal issues. I felt that by him opening up and talking about his own struggles it pulled me in even more as an audience member. Photo galleries and a few trailers round out the extras on the DVD.

Despite the cost of the film, there was some fantastic locations used. Racine and Kenosha have never looked so beautiful. The area used for the camping trip was gorgeous, and it was the perfect backdrop as the lead character reveals the explanation of an October Moon.

October Moon is a story about love. Love of different kinds and on different levels. Gay love, straight love, obsessive love. Some characters are likeable while others are more villainish, but whatever their conflicts, whatever their problems, they deal with them underneath an October Moon.",1144800000,8,1264,4.784403669724771
2452129,1,B000C205H4,"OK, so imagine a cross between The Blair Witch Project, Misery, some really bad, low budget Romeo and Julliet thing and The Shining.  Now, remove all the GOOD parts from those.  Take that whole mix and make it look like it was filmed by a bunch of 8th graders who borrowed daddy's camcorder and you'd be about half way to how bad this thing really is.

The acting is at best poor, and at worst is so completely laughable that it's not even funny.  This movie has bad writing, bad staging, silly camera angles, an amazingly annoying score and a completely predictable and overdone storyline.

Heck, even the presence of some shirtless boys and a single bare buttocks shot of the main character doesn't even help this piece of tripe.  The movie isn't remotely scary, but I suppose as a silly movie with which to practice your MST2K shtick, it might have value.

Don't waste your money on this thing.  If you do, consider using the DVD as a nice coaster or a shiny playtoy for the dog.  The producers of this movie should be ashamed of themselves.",1140307200,9,1044,4.51063829787234
2452130,4,B000C205H4,"Thirty-year old Corin (newcomer Sean Michael Lambrecht) works in an ad agency in south-east Wisconsin and is working on his five year relationship with 23-year old Jake (Jeff Dylan Graham).  Corin's boss, Nancy (Brinke Stevens), helps out by hiring him an assistant, Elliot (Jerod Howard).  Elliot, an awkward fellow, is engaged to marry his long-time only-friend Marti (Tina Ona Paukstelis).  Corin's gaydar picks up a vibe from Elliot that triggers invitations for Elliot and Marti to spend some time with Corin and Jake.  Elliot's mother, Emily (Judith O'dea) disapproves strongly.  Nevertheless, rather rapidly, Elliot finds his real attraction is to Corin.

Not having learned how to make friends, Elliot presses in, gathering souvenirs and taking secret photographs.  Eventually Nancy, Jake, and Corin do something about it, but not in time to prevent Elliot from making his sudden move.  The film moves to its violent climax, including Christian symbolism and decorated with the words of twisted journalism.

This inexpensive independent film does manage to do a good job telling the story of Elliot's reorientation and decline into obsession, showing a gay couple negotiating their relationship, and having the supporting cast framing the action well.  There are scenes showing how straight bars, gay bars, and traditional religion reflect and shape values.

The acting was fairly good, with Brinke, Howard, and O'Dea doing the best.

The four knifing scenes all have makeup and effects that are reasonable.  The film is not centered on showing violence per se.

Attractive Corin has substantial skin shots.  Jake has a background one.  There is a hunky farmer and a gay club dancer for extra eye-candy.

As extras, there is an audio commentary by the director (Jason Paul Collum) and Jerod Howard, there is a small making-of featurette, some spicy photogalleries, and two trailers.

""October Moon"" fills a unique niche.  Both straight and gay viewers should find it worthwhile.",1140134400,15,1986,5.327974276527331

2452134,1,B000C205H4,"Implausible, unbelievable, unrealistic garbage.  This is one of the worst films I've ever seen.  Amazing, how infantile writing and riduculous character actions can ruin what could have otherwise been a decent story.  I can only think that those that give positive reviews to pieces of trash like this are those that have something to gain, like producers, directors, distributors, or their friends.  Charging for this travesty is tatamount to stealing.  Amazon and lying reviewers should be ashamed.",1355875200,,500,5.441558441558442
2452135,5,B000C205H4,"You won't want to read this review if you haven't seen the movie.

This movie had a profound effect on me.  I really found that I could relate to Elliot in alot of ways.  I grew up without a father, in a conservative community surrounded by homophobia.  I didn't have alot of friends in high school.  I didn't know other gay people until I was in college.  As most gay men can tell you, the coming out process can be very painful, and poor Elliot had about the worst coming out possible.  Corin, the first gay man Elliot ever met, knew immediately that Elliot was gay.  Knowing how difficult it can be, Corin wanted to help, and became friends with him.  Little did he know that his compassion and kindness toward Elliot planted a seed for Elliot to become extremely obsessed with him.  Of course Corin was already in a relationship with a guy named Jake, rocky of course, but committed to making it work.  I can relate to Elliot in this way too.  It is very painful to love someone who doesn't love you back.  Even though you knew from the start that this person is not available, you can't help who you fall for.  This was especially true for Elliot considering the circumstances that led to this point. As more time goes by, Elliot becomes more and more obsessed.  His misery is compounded when his fiance and mother discover his secret.  He is kicked out onto the street, alone, and miserable.  When I came out to my mother, I didn't get the support that I had hoped for, but at least my mother didn't reject me.  I can't even imagine how that felt for poor Elliot.  My heart ached for this poor guy.  The pain he felt from this multiple rejection quickly spiraled out of control resulting in a tragic ending.  While I don't condone his actions at the end, I somehow understand why he went down that path.

I give this movie 5 stars becuase it is very rare to find a gay themed movie these days that doesn't look cheaply made with horrid acting and lame story lines.  I thought the acting was good. The picture was high quality for a low budget, and of course the storyline struck a nerve.  I loved the realistic feel to the story.  I have to say great job to the actors, and everyone behind the scenes for bringing us a high quality gay themed movie.",1294963200,4,2255,4.362980769230769
2452136,3,B000C205H4,"I was expecting a supernatural horror flick and instead it was a gay version of Fatal Attraction. The production value is atrocious as is most of the acting. I did like the guy playing Corin, who is fairly attractive.

Overall I would say this is a good film to watch if you're drunk or if you want to laugh when you shouldn't.",1243728000,2,327,4.274193548387097
2452137,2,B000C205H4,"This is an extremely amateurish movie, even for a low-budget indie, but it's not the very worst I've ever seen, so I gave it two stars instead of just one.

2452139,5,B000C205H4,"I have watched this movie several times since I got it and every time I notice something new. Its a very compelling watch with characters you really learn to care about...so much so that when things begin to get dark you find yourself hoping that the characters will make it out unscathed! Of course in a movie such as this that cannot possibly happen...blood IS shed and some characters do not survive.

The good news is that you will have a lot of fun watching these events unfold...and also the sequel has been released just this week with the return of all surviving characters and appearences by some not so much alive characters! I am just waiting for amazon to get my copy to me, I cant wait to see the next installment!",1239840000,,727,4.466165413533835
2452140,1,B000C205H4,"I bought the movie expecting something else, I guess, say a serious drama dealing with real life problems of gay men. But this film has little more to offer than cliched ideas (e.g., gays are the products of homes with dominant mothers and weak or absent fathers - an idea that has long been discredited) and actions that didn't seem to follow from any form of rational motivation. The actors were earnest amateurs at best and the budget was minimal but those are things I could accept if the writing had been better and if it had more accurately presented gay people. I would not recommend the film to anyone other than maybe students at a film school studying how not to make a movie.",1235347200,,686,4.496
8095209,4,B000C205H4,"Good indie with some surreal segments, but a dramatic take on ""Fatal Attraction"" theme.  The acting is what one would expect with an indie vs. big-budget film casting [with some exceptions], so here the storyline is the thing.  There is a good story--engaging, attention-grabbing.  While the progress begins slowly, the story-telling pace picks up and leads to an expected climax with surprising resolution and conclustion.  The film title derives from a soul-revealing moment of the main character.",1514678400,,499,5.441558441558442

8095214,4,B000C205H4,"The reviewer below who mentions October Moon is a lot like Fatal Attraction is spot-on!  It's basically the same thing, but involving two men who prefer each other instead of a woman and man.  Corin and Jake are two lovers who don't always see eye to eye but they truly love each other.  Corin believes Jake's the right man for him.  Corin's 30 years old and Jake's 23.  Despite the age difference, they're determined to make the relationship work (even when Corin says to Jake he's only hanging around because of Corin's bank account.  Jake doesn't voice disagreement!)

At work Corin and his boss Nancy have several lengthy conversations and jokes.  Nancy actually says several lines that could be interpreted as humorous but would probably be offensive to the homosexual community.  I don't really know for sure since women can get away with this kind of conversational talk better than a straight guy could, and I can't exactly provide examples or amazon would delete my review!  Let's just say, one line is that Nancy implies the reason Corin got such a good job is because of... sexual favors!  The way she words it though-between honest and joking- is what makes her hilarious.

Meanwhile we have another character who applies for the office job named Elliot.  You know come to think of it I don't think the movie ever mentions what Corin does for a living besides office work.  Anyway Elliot's about to get married (to a woman).  He plans for the wedding but as soon as he gets the job and hangs around Corin long enough, he becomes infatuated with Corin.  To the point he takes pictures of Corin and can't stop thinking about him!  Elliot begins to invade Corin's privacy such as when Corin and Nancy are sharing a drink at a restaurant downtown and Elliot thinks it's okay to drop by and see what they're doing.  This affects Elliot's relationship with his girlfriend who eventually gets fed up and says he's spending more time with Corin than with her!  And that Elliot's talking more about Corin than the wedding!

The invasion of privacy intensifies when Elliot begs Corin that he go on a trip with him and Jake.  Corin's against this at first because he's trying to better his relationship with Jake, but reluctantly agrees.  This of course leads to awkwardness as Jake, Corin and Elliot have trouble striking a conversation and walk together with nothing to say.  Talk about an elephant in the room!  When Elliot spots Corin alone observing an empty field ahead, Corin considers this his private place to get away from the hectic nature of his office job and city life.  Elliot comes out and admits he likes guys.  Corin says he already knows, and describes how awkward it is for a guy to admit his preferences for the first time.  Elliot then describes what an October Moon is, and it's funny in a way that this tiny bit of information is supposed to be significant enough to name the movie after it since you'd have to think outside the box to see any connection between the movie title and the storyline.

Eventually Elliot's girlfriend discovers pictures of Corin hiding under the bed and this not only destroys the marriage with Elliot and his girlfriend, but Elliot realizes he can't control his obsession for Corin and kidnaps him to an abandoned farmhouse where coincidentally another murder took place.  By this point Elliot's mother already wrote him off because she's strict and won't accept men who like men, especially when it's her own son.  She even mentions her dislike for men being with men earlier during a dinner conversation with Elliot and his girlfriend.  She slaps Elliot which belittles his confidence.  She makes her son swear that he'll never bring up his man love in front of other family members.  He's now an emotional mess.

The story finally gets suspenseful when Elliot has Corin tied up in the farmhouse, and Jake -after having a conversation with Elliot's girlfriend at her house concerning the anger he feels towards Elliot for stealing his boyfriend- follows her to the farmhouse.  Of course the girlfriend feels the same betrayal, perhaps even stronger since a marriage was planned and now destroyed.  Now it's time for something odd!  Upon the girlfriend arriving to the farmhouse where Corin's tied up, Jake gets angry and screams she knew Corin was here all along.  Jake then beats her on the ground.  This raises some questions.  How *did* Elliot's girlfriend know Corin was being held here?  If Elliot left clues behind for his girlfriend to see where he's going to take Corin (or simply clues explaining where *he's* going) I must've missed them.  That was a puzzling moment for sure.  I also think the story should've mentioned more about this supposed other murder that occurred in this farmhouse several years earlier but it never does.

Anyway SPOILERS!  With Corin tied up in the farmhouse basement, Jake walks in and Corin admits he's never going to love Elliot.  Elliot gets upset and stabs Corin to death.  This leads to Jake running after Elliot who's now an emotionally fragile mess of a man (Elliot that is).  Jake catches up to Elliot and strangles him to death.  I thought for sure the girlfriend was going to interfere since she wakes up from the beating Jake gave her outside the farmhouse and has a knife in hand, but she doesn't show up until after Elliot is strangled.  Perhaps she waited a few extra seconds on purpose given the betrayal she felt that her soon to be boyfriend liked men and destroyed the upcoming marriage!  Hey who knows.

Like I said though, the first half of this movie contains what many would interpret as humorous jokes but are probably offensive to those who prefer the same sex.  Lots of male on male sex joke humor.  There's also other moments of humor that I enjoyed such as when Corin, Jake and Elliot went to vacation.  Corin likes to spend hours alone outside just staring at the empty fields and trees.  When Elliot asks Jake where Corin is, Jake says ""He's doing that outdoor John Denver thing"", LOL!  Another funny moment is when Corin thanks Jake for making supper... and it's just a pizza sitting on the table, LOL!  Yeah, it takes a lot of work taking a frozen pizza out of the box and throwing it in the oven!  Maybe Corin was being sarcastic here, who knows.

Another moment I can't figure out whether it's funny or disturbing is when Elliot finds Corin's underwear, so he picks the underwear up and sniffs them.  He then tucks the underwear in his pants and steals them.  Not sure if that's funny or deeply disturbing though.  Later on Corin wonders where his missing underwear went, implying Jake took them.  Meanwhile Elliot's standing close by not saying a word!  Sniffing underwear is weird yo!

October Moon does a pretty solid job building a compelling storyline.  Corin, Jake and Elliot are all very good characters.  Sure the movie's on the low budget side which is obvious by the way these characters interact with each other, but the story is solid enough that the weak acting can be forgiven.

On a final note the movie implies this white-haired guy who we at first see standing by a car watching Elliot get into the car with his girlfriend is significant in some way but he never is.  We see this guy again at the bar dressed up as a woman and approaching Elliot.  I think his presence is to add more confirmation for Elliot's preference for men, but the tone of this man's presence feels like he's going to be a threat in some way but never is.  This same man criticizes other men at the bar, and does so in a way where I'm not sure he's completely serious or not.  Also, Corin, don't imply straight people can't be big Madonna fans!  I love her music!  At least her 80's stuff.  Not too crazy about her 90's-current stuff.",1499212800,,7753,4.68319763138416
