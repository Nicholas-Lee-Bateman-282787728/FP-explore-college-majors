8576422,5,B00C28WX80,"Lots of fun here. A broke New York family heads off for a new beginnings in California. Imagine a spoof of Grapes of Wrath and it would be similar to this. Pushed onward by the beautiful Bessie Love, the family heads out, pursued by Bessies ex-boyfriend in a car with no motor. Dont ask. This probably was filmed around Southern California but you sure get the feeling of a cross country road trip complete with camps along the way. Included on the dvd is a very funny Snub Pollard short,  California or bust. Another winning offering from Grapevine.",1469577600,2,550,4.612244897959184
