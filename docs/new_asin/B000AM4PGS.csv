8078824,3,B000AM4PGS,"Okay I bought this for 2$ and I certainly was not expecting much. But I got a lil more than expected. Let's just delve right in.

Meinichi: I'm sorry I couldn't even keep attention to this one. It's mainly: family moves in to house, little girl who lived there died, younger sister to main character becomes victim to the ghost girl. And let me tell ya. She's hardly a ghost. It's just a lil girl in a red and white dress who walks around with a crutch. She looks perfectly normal. Ehhh.. It's not great.

Cruel Kidnapping: Basicaly, it's about this guy Toshio, who really is kind of a scumbag. He cheats on his wife while she looks after their daughter, etc. Well one day he comes home and finds out that the daughter has been kidnaped, to which the mother is pretty much like ""aren't you a man? Save our daughter"". I won't go too much into what he does to try to get the money because it's so great and horrible. But what made me like this one alot was the twist towards the end that's so horrible and dark, it's fantastic.

Desire To Kill: This is indeed probably the best one. A woman is alone at home with her son when a young man tries to rob them after killing his stepmother. There's a few reasons why I like this one. You can sympathize with the characters. The guy turns out to be a kid that's in way over his head and the two end up bonding. It does indeed have a shock ending but it doesn't just come out of nowhere without reason. It's well built upon right from the start and through out. When I think about it, it's pretty well written. I also think it has some social commentary about how gossip and rumors impact people and their decisions.

not bad. for Desire to Kill alone it was worth the 2$. Just make sure that you go into it not expecting too much. There's definetly worse out there in my opinion.",1376179200,2,1821,4.239193083573487
8078825,3,B000AM4PGS,"The first story was good, even though the acting sucked. The second one, I had no idea what it had to do with horror. It was about a guy whose daughter was kidnapped and demanded 30,000 yen. Then he kidnapped his friend's kid and pretended to be the kidnapper, demanding 50,000 yen. He abandoned the child at a child's center, run by nuns. When they returned for the child, the nuns told him that the child had passed away due to pneumonia. The third story was my favorite. I would recommend this to people who enjoy Japanese films, only because of the third story.",1189900800,,565,4.4423076923076925

A good-looking family of four approaches their new house and is met by a family friend (or maybe the real estate agent?). Everyone seems happy to be moving into the new house, which will be a welcome breathe of fresh air from the hectic Tokyo home they left. But the main reason seems to be for the benefit of one of the family's two daughter health. That daughter, Minako, had a complete breakdown after her boyfriend is killed, and seems to wonder through life in some sort of comatose, hazy daze. With a twisted grin. Her sister, Yukio (Asami Mizukawa; Dark Water, Shibuya Kaidan), begs her sister to go on with her life but the morose Minako is visited by the ghost of a young girl who used to live in that house. What stands out immediately, from the first images that appear, is the camerawork. Most of the shots are in frame, but the ones that aren't are badly out. The action and the actors are shot far too close also. That's not saying the video is poor, on the contrary, the definition is crystal clear; so much so that I felt as if I could reach right into the movie to grab a banister or push a door open. Those positive attributes aren't nearly enough to save this amateur escapade. I'll try not to mention that almost nothing is explained in this ""episode"" and only the most superficial motives are apparent. Combine that with lack-luster, cheesy special effects, and you have an almost entirely forgettable experience.

Laughably bad in every way. A dim-witted, bumbling, former big-shot money-man gets himself embroiled in a kidnapping plot that involves not only his own child, but the child of a well-to-do acquaintance. In order to get his baby back safely, he must come up with 30 million Yen (just over $250,000 US & $300,000 CAN). But his ""brilliant"", spur-of-the-moment strategy to find the funds puts him into a very bad position. The story is easy enough to follow, although it's barely worth doing so. A few comical scenes and takes from the Toshio character.

Desire to Kill

The best of the three in this volume. It follows a middle-aged woman, Rei, who lives in a cramped apartment building. Her immediate next-door neighbor is constantly lording over the other tenants and poking her nose into their lives; seemingly waiting for the other tenants to do something ""wrong"" or hounding them inexplicably. One day, Rei refuses to throw out a bag of trash because her old, bitter neighbor is seen rifling through people trash. She wants to time the service pick-up just right so she can avoid the old lady's interest. Alone at home, (her husband is out of town on business), she grabs an umbrella and rushes into the stormy night to pitch her garbage and gets pushed back into the apartment by a dark stranger, no sooner had she opened the door. With just her sleeping son with her, she has to make it through a tense night with a young man who has killed once already that night. A fairly good ""episode"", all told, but suffers from the same level of tedium as the previous two ""episodes"". It's only redeeming element is the hint of a genuine story and a mild Twightlight Zone -ish ending.",1147392000,6,3368,4.632550335570469
