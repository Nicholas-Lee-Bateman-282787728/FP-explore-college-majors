8205386,3,B000SIWHC8,"This is a bizarre collection of short films - very Euro, bizarre scenarios. Ozon is a French filmaker of some reknown in France but not in the States. Unless you are a fan of offbeat plots, unknown actors with the exception of Garrel then this is not for you. The only viable short is the one with Garrel however that's a bit disapointing compared to any of his other works.",1302220800,,374,4.357142857142857
8205387,5,B000SIWHC8,"I found this to be a fascinating and admirable film. The plot seems simple but the dialogue contains insights about life that are confirming and enlightening. It is an ingenious film. In a short time, with a simple story, it reveals much about human nature. I saw it on the Sundance channel and knew that I would want to share it with others so I am purchasing it.",1239062400,2,364,4.367647058823529
8205388,1,B000SIWHC8,This is the most pathetic video I have ever purchased. I will probably never buy a french video after this experience.,1237161600,,118,4.666666666666667
8205389,1,B000SIWHC8,"Skip this if you have seen it on the filmfest circuit, it's not worth a repeat viewing.",1202688000,4,87,4.176470588235294
8205390,5,B000SIWHC8,"This is an amazing shorts collection from one on France's best young directors. They're smart, sad, funny, sexy and each short has the emotional impact of a feature film. Especially Little Death. With UNDER THE SAND, Ozon gets better and better with the seeds of genius clearly apparent in these short masterpieces!",1198195200,10,315,5.076923076923077
