7011600,3,B00TJFXGKS,"I was disappointed with the 2nd season,it seem like it was a  different show then the first season. They took the punch out of it. Thandie Newton was the main focus the first season,now iam trying to figure out if they are trying to make the show a family show or what.",1439856000,3,269,4.173076923076923

7011608,3,B00TJFXGKS,"This second season promises much but doesn't deliver as expected.  Story is good but there are too many points when believability is strained when ""understanding"" is applied rather than a bullet. Ending clearly leaves the main protagonist with another season coming around the bend. Will hope that third season, if any, will be as good as the first one.",1452902400,2,353,4.983050847457627

8702063,4,B00TJFXGKS,"The second season of Rogue tells, mostly, an entirely new story, based on a group of ex soldiers (led by Cole Hauser), and 10 million in stolen money.  Thandie Newton returns as Grace, at first in a handler role for an undercover agent, and then ultimately going back undercover herself.  It continues to tell the story of her family life (mainly between her daughter, and her mother who basically comes to live with the two for most of the season.  There are a couple tie backs to the Laszlo story line from season one, which could, be tied into future seasons if the show runners want (I have not watched most of season 3 (just the first few episodes) which are still currently airing as of this writing, so I am not sure if any of that has been worked in).

Like the first season, this one is short, and the writers dole out elements of the story very well throughout the 10 episodes.  While we as the viewers are ahead of a lot of the characters in the story for a long time, the full reveal of what exactly happened with the money, is not known until the final episode.  And the season ends on a big cliff hanger which is clearly setting up a continuation of this seasons story going into season 3.

For those who get the discs, there are some deleted scenes and a series of behind the scenes and making of features (about 49 min worth in total).  Good for what is there, but not as much as was included in the season 1 set.  The show is still very much for an adult audience.  While the sex and nudity was toned down a bit from season 1, it is still there, and there is a lot of violence and swearing.  So if that turns you off to a show then you should skip this.  While I personally do not think it was as strong as season 1, I do think they did a good job changing the story up, while still providing a progression for Grace and her family.  I think a few more season 1 characters could have been tied in somehow, the the few that do reappear (even of just for cameos) are worked in well.  All in all it is a well written and acted show that is worth checking out.",1462752000,2,2073,4.15
8702064,5,B00TJFXGKS,I honestly do not know why I bought this series.  But it was entertaining.  Would I buy season three.  Yes.,1461024000,,107,4.25
8702065,4,B00TJFXGKS,This is not 4 discs.....it is a 3 disc set...don t know why everyone advertises it as 4,1457049600,,87,3.888888888888889
