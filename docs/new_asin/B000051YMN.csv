1388109,4,B000051YMN,"This movie by Carlos Saura is an ambitious attempt at recreating the life of celebrated Spanish artist, Francisco Goya. The cinematography is spell binding as the artists works are recreated masterfully,  only to be matched by the magnificent time period recreation. The acting is very good, good enough to garnish a Goya(Spanish equivilent of an Oscar) for leading actor and actress. Veteran actor Francisco Rabal, who bears an uncanny resemblance to the real Goya and Maribel Vernu as Cayetana, the Dutchess of Alba, both won a Goya for their performances. If all this reference to Goya is confusing it is because I'm laying the foundation for the problem with this movie. The story of Goya is told to his daughter through a series of flashbacks that are at times very perplexing. It is not so much that they are confusing but that no explanation is given to the circumstances of Goya's life. Saura makes the leap that everyone knows about Goya rather than explaining. Maybe everyone in Spain knows about Goya but not all viewers are Spanish. It helps to be up on your Spanish history prior to viewing to understand the political nature of the times and the reason for his self imposed exile to Bordeaux in his later years. I did some reading afterwards but it would have been better to know the why before viewing. Anyway the sets and lighting are works of art in themselves as the paintings and walls in one sequence come to life. These hallucinations are part of the torment that Goya suffers and is reflected in his art. Some insights are given into the life of Goya but it is hard to distinguish fact from fiction. Goyas mixing in the royal court and hob nobing with the rich and famous are perfect backdrops for his cavorting with Cayetana. Saura has created a work of art in his homage to one of Spains  master painters. Goya's life and death, as represented in this film, is the end of an era linked to Velasquez and the birth of modern art in Spain. Recommended for art enthuisists with deep pockets.",989798400,52,2011,4.661971830985915
1388110,1,B000051YMN,"Director Saura has obviously seen Raul Ruiz's extraordinary adaptation of Proust's novel, 'Time Regained'.  His plot - an old man looks back at his life and the way it shaped his art - and narrative techniques - the blurring of history, dream, memory, imagination, art; the easy weaving through time, where the same character at different ages walk in the same frame, or a character looks from one decade at a scene from another; the shifting mise-en-scene emphasising artifice, a lack of solidity, fragility, provisionality.
Comparison with Ruiz only reveals Saura's faults - his stylistic heavy-handedness; the banality of his ideas; his reduction of everything to dance (there is a massacre sequence here of gobsmacking inappropriateness); the visual timidity (unable to match Goya, he defaces his works); the inability to construct compelling narrative or character.  The one constant in Saura's career has been great music, and the insistent period dance rhythms almost convince you that you're enjoying yourself.",981676800,7,1018,5.436708860759493
1388111,4,B000051YMN,"The society tends to think of artists as selfish, solitary and detached from reality.  ""Goya in Bordeaux"" shows the surprisingly human and sympathetic side of the great artist.  The film is not just about Goya's genius.  It's about his earthly loves.  After a lifetime of moderate promiscuity, Goya settles down into unexpectedly conventional domesticity with his wife and daughter.  His concern for his family is genuine and tender.  Goya agrees to discontinue his disturbing paintings, because they scare his daughter.",1137801600,2,520,5.4375
1388112,5,B000051YMN,"The legitimate pride of  Huelva -Carlos Saura- reached a cosmic height with this unbeatable artwork in a theatrical stage around the last days of Goya in Bordeaux. The picture elapses in two well definite times and spaces: the young Goya and his love affair with La Duquesa de Alba, his beloved and unforgettable love Cayetana.

The cast is incredible. Francisco Rabal that monumental actor got perhaps his most admirable feature through his memorable career. Jose Coronado as the young Goya is impressive, and the sensual Maribel Verd ignites the screen every time she appears.

An introspective portrait in which the memories are the invisible fellow partners, despite he is surrounded and supported by her family until his last breath.

All the Prizes for this film were deservedly won. Consider this film as one of the best ten Spanish films ever filmed.

A superb masterpiece.",1114300800,5,881,5.090277777777778
1388113,5,B000051YMN,"Not only is ""Goya in Bordeaux"" a movie *about* Goya, his life, and his times, but it is also another movie *by* Carlos Saura.  To fully appreciate this movie, it helps not only to have a little knowledge of Spanish history (19th c.), art, and music, but also to have seen other Carlos Saura movies (Bodas de sangre/Blood Wedding, El amor brujo, Carmen, Flamenco, and Tango--all of which I recommend).  It is a Saura specialty to mix music, choreography, stage settings, real life and lives, and inner turmoil into a frankly confusing recursive pastiche of story-within-story, life-imitating-art-imitating-life, and so on, to the point where the viewer can become thoroughly confused.  The proper attitude for the viewer is ""Well, I may not understand where we're going but any trip with Saura is well worth the effort.""  On top of that, he is (my opinion) the greatest of all dance cinematographers.  While ""Goya in Bordeaux"" somewhat de-emphasizes dance as dramatic narrative when compared to Saura's other movies, the fandango scene itself is worth the price of admission.",1110153600,3,1074,5.114285714285714

1388115,5,B000051YMN,"After seeing this film twice at the Vancouver Film Festival, visiting from my home in Mexico, I could hardly wait to own it, even though it was only available in VHS. I find it fascinating and disturbing that Saura's masterpiece, as non-linear and right-brained as any great work of art, should be maligned by critics such as Roger Ebert, and others. Here's to those who've written their praise for the film on these pages!
This is extraordinary creation, a fusion of both outer and inner realities that the logical mind cannot grasp - and why must it? Does it really matter what happened factually to Goya? Aren't those fiery skies and the music of Boccherini,  reflecting the fire and brimstone in Goya's mind, enough to tell us that the film is mythic? Shakespeare did the same thing with his tragic heroes because the Elizabethans and the alchemists believed in ""as above, so below"". Macbeth's turmoil is reflected in the storms outside, and the bloody battles raging around him. Yet that's fiction and we believe this world is reality..
I buy few films, and I cherish this one. I'm still longing for  ""Providence"" to come out on DVD because Resnais  interweaves life and art from the same perspective...an old man, a writer, dying among his living, breathing creations. I live in an Mexico's oldest city, on a street named ""Cinco de Mayo"" Every day I'm reminded of Goya's painting, and this film is shown at least once a month on TV because the Mexicans love it - the Latin world has no problem suspending reality in the name of art - which is why Andre Breton called Mexico the ultimate surrealism. Thank you Saura, once again.",1078185600,22,1633,4.722807017543859
1388116,3,B000051YMN,"It seems that the director approached making this film on the pretext that the viewer knows something about Goya, his art, and the time in which he lived. Without some of this background information, it may be rather difficult to watch. I wasn't particularly fond of the use of scrims, but it was interesting to see how their use translated on film-in fact, the whole film is approached more like a staged work than as cinema. In the end, it works. Incredible acting, great music, good representation of Goya's works.",1042156800,3,517,4.7555555555555555
1388117,5,B000051YMN,"This film is not only amazing cinematically, but also in context.  The story follows the life of Francisco de Goya very well, and I feel it successfully conveys the emotions (and insanity) he went through at the end of his life.  Artistically, every scene is visual perfection in composition and effects.  Contextually, the philosophical and psychological motifs are deeply insightful.  This is definitely one of the best films I've seen in my lifetime.",1026691200,,453,5.164383561643835
1388118,1,B000051YMN,"Horrible, boring film from one of my top 10 favorite directors.  The only thing worth seeing is the amazing ""tiara"" of candles that Goya (supposedly?) uses to paint at night.  BORING!!",1013040000,2,184,4.903225806451613
1388119,3,B000051YMN,"Carlos Saura, one of the finest and most distinctive filmmakers in the Spanish cinema, wrote and directed this biographical epic concerning one of Spain's greatest artists, the painter Francisco de Goya y Lucientes. On his deathbed, Goya, attended by his mistress, Leocadia and their daughter, Rosario, is plagued by hallucinations and frequent visions of the beautiful Cayetana as his mind reels through the events of his life. As a young man, Goya became the court painter to King Charles and the Royal Family, where he created technically skillful but uninteresting portraits and was invited to a number of royal functions. At one such affair, Goya first met Cayetana, the Duchess of Alba, and he was immediately smitten; they became lovers, and she was both the subject and inspiration of several major works, including ""Desnuda"" and ""La Maja Vestida."" Goya's work developed a dark undercurrent after Napoleon invaded Spain and he took up with Leocadia, creating disturbing images that alienated his patrons and frightened his children. In time, the decline of the court and a changing political climate forced Goya to seek exile in France in 1824, where he would die four years later. Goya In Bordeaux was a project that Saura had dreamed of filming for years, and he was ably assisted in recreating the look of Goya's paintings by master cinematographer Vittorio Storaro.",1003795200,19,1377,5.151785714285714
1388120,4,B000051YMN,"This film is an artistic masterpiece. Absolutely beautiful cinematography (i.e., the transparent walls), superb costumes and recreation of the time/place, beautiful musical score, and fantastic acting. The girl that played Goya's daughter was outstanding.
Therefore, it is no surprise that this film earned four Goya Awards (spanish equivalent of the Oscar, ironically named after the master painter himself). This is not a strict biography of the great master; it is cinematographic art interwoven within an old man's (Goya's) recollection of his life.",1000080000,7,553,5.7560975609756095

7929685,1,B000051YMN,"I actually went to a theatre to see this piece of art house trash. I don't know where to start, the brief synopsis is what got me interested in the first place but this film is totally pointless, very, very dull and the characters are void of any relevance to the film itself.

Beware, the film starts off relatively promising enough but spirals quickly into complete stupidity, minus 3 stars. Why I watched the whole thing is still a mystery to me. Its a disturbingly senseless film with a lot of tedious footage that drives you to despise what you're looking at and in some cases I walked away for a while; however, I think causing those feelings in the viewer was part of the intent of the filmmaker and the film leaves you to ponder utter boredom.

Most of the screen time is spent by a 500 lb old geezer who's lost his brain. The art direction is appalling, probably worked on by a Spanish grad student in pastel colors. I wish the filmmaker would have cut more of the meaningless scenes in the editing of this film though but then he wouldn't have a film left. It just went on too long and had no purpose, much like Ayn Rand's so called philosophy.",1387756800,,1154,4.362790697674418
7929686,5,B000051YMN,"This story is set in Goya's later life after becoming deaf, while in self-imposed exile in france. Spain was under great political turmoil during Goya's life, and he created artwork which reflected the atrocities witnessed. His view of the world is portrayed in a surrealistic and romantic fashion through this piece. The film manages to arouse deep empathy for the painter, fully absorbing your attention and heart. Overall very surreal, beautiful and tragic. One of my favorites!",1320710400,,481,5.259740259740259

Synopsis: An old man awakens in bed confused and bewildered. After wandering through a house he doesn't recognize he ends up out on the street impeding traffic and pedestrians until his daughter Rosarito (Dapne Fernadez) comes to his rescue and takes him home. The old man is the legendary painter Goya now in the twilight of his life. Through the eyes of age and experience his life unfolds in a series of flashbacks revealing his passion for painting, his one true love Cayetana (Maribel Verdu) and his homeland Spain.

Critique: Released in '99 `Goya in Bordeaux' is an artsy film heavy on visual presentation but somewhat lacking in character development. It has the feel of a stage production except for the few sequences filmed outside. Most of the film is shot indoors within the confines of the home or studio of Goya. The settings are extremely minimalist, containing just enough furniture as necessary. The cinematography gives the impression of a stage providing just enough light to allow the audience to follow the action but dark and shadowy around the edges to give the impression of more space than there really is. The atmosphere created by the director is indeed unique but just didn't appeal to me.

Making matters worse, I also found the cast to be stiff and uninteresting, except for the lovely Dapre Fernadez in the role of his daughter and care giver. I simply couldn't get caught up in the storyline and ended up watching mostly for the well conceived sequences when Goya's paintings came to life to haunt and fascinate.

My rating: One viewing was plenty for me. My rating: -3 Stars-.",1184976000,2,1648,4.875
