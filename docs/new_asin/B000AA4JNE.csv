2382742,5,B000AA4JNE,"This DVD, containing 13 new episodes of Creature Comforts is a joy to watch.  Like the original, it features claymation animated animals speaking dialogue taken from interviews of British citizens.  The animation is beautiful, making the characters really come alive.  The humor is typically dry, and like Wallace and Gromit, you will probably either love it or hate it, with no in between.  The extras are a wonderful look into the process involved in creating such a work.",1131062400,51,474,5.038461538461538
2382743,5,B000AA4JNE,"Absolutely genious. In traditional Aardman form, they bring clay to life like nobody else can. I'm a fan of animation, and have been waiting for the US release of Creature Comforts since I first saw it at the Ottawa Animation Festival in 2004.

It amazes me how the clay creatures really ""live"". Even as an animator, I don't find myself analyzing their processes, but rather falling in love with the characters, and every once in a while saying, ""Oh yea, they're not real..."" Human actors have a hard time achieving such subtlety of emotion.

It was also great to see the extra DVD stuff showing the human actors taping what they wanted the characters to do.

I love it.

2382744,5,B000AA4JNE,"The premise of the original short, Creature Comforts, was to take interviews with ordinary people & transform them into comedic animal representations via the medium of claymation. Nick Park & his team developed this brilliantly funny concept through an entire 13 episode series.

This dvd is amazingly funny - even what may be perceived as the weaker episodes have their sparkling moments. If you're a fan of Wallace & Gromit or just a fan of funny animation, this dvd is for you. The format has no definite story line, but rather is a topical discussion - kind of like Dr. Doolittle meets Oprah. Addressing such questions as ""Where do we come from?"", ""Are there aliens?"" and ""Cats vs. Dogs"" - these installments will leave you in stitches. The animation is flawless, the interview editing superb. Just an overall delight.",1128038400,118,823,4.920863309352518

2382796,5,B000AA4JNE,"The first season of this clever series shines on this DVD. You get the first 13 episodes of the series, with hilarious claymation animals talking in the voices of The Great British Public about any number of interesting topics. It sounds like the makers interviewed ordinary British citizens and then took the best bits and animated a character for each voice.

The premise is awesome, but what truly brings this to brilliant new heights is the skill and loving care with which the series was created. I guffawed my way through the first one, watching in disbelief at how clever and funny it was, and finally dragged my unwilling boyfriend in to watch it with me. After about ten minutes he was chortling along with me and we enjoyed the rest with great enthusiasm.

This is meant more for teens and adults than children, because the humor is often subtle or dry and the accents can be hard to understand for Americans. But there isn't anything unsafe for younger kids in here as far as I could tell, I just don't think they'd really ""get"" it.

If you like Wallace and Gromit and want to try something new, give this winner a try - it is well worth the money and is one that I intend to watch over and over again.",1169856000,12,1213,4.454954954954955

It is not an example of the boisterous humour of Wallace and Gromit, but it certainly has all the elements of beautifully executed plasticene animation that you would expect from Nick Park and his colleagues.

These are real people.  Wouldn't you think it hilarious if your self-important coworker's opinions about life were being told by a fat, lazy, condescending cat reclining on one arm on a tacky sofa?

Remember how you made Mom read the same story over and over?  This is the grownup version. You catch something new each time.  Part of the delight is learning a new language and never mind how similar you think it is to English.

For fans, I'd agree that there are some clips deliberately chosen for the music of the dialogue, and are almost impossible to hear everything.  But, when a bowl of clams chatter to one another, who cares if you miss a few words?",1146441600,7,835,4.7972027972027975

The creators have interviewed random Brits on the street and then created mini Mockumentaries as if animals are being interviewed.  The animals hold forth on a range of topics, from whether they believe in aliens to what motivates them to perform in the circus.

One of the more charming lines from this brilliant series produced by Aardman (of Wallace and Gromit fame).

The producers went out into the British population and conducted interviews -- hundreds of hours' worth. Then, they paired the interviewees to plasticene animated animal characters and animated them in a series of 15 minute episodes.

One view is not enough, either, because there are a lot of subtleties within the context of each episode. I also liked the special features.

However, a lot of the charm comes from the British accents in the given context.  I don't believe that this would work with different American accents only because the characters would probably become ""too cool"" in the way that cartoons today have no soul.  This is definitely a highly recommended series to watch whether you are a Nick Park fan (Wallace & Gromit), into animation, or just like to hear social commentary from normal people.",1141689600,5,576,4.846938775510204

From a garden slug to a polar bear family, from a hamster to a circus elephant, from a worm to a cow, they're all here and more.  What these creators have done is brilliant.  Recording voices from all over England and matching them to various animals, they really humanized the creatures so much you actually look forward to hearing what they have to say.  And the imagination of the scenarios and interviews is excellent.

The bonus features are all very interesting and worth viewing.  All in all, this is great viewing on every level.  All ages will find something they like about this collection.",1141516800,7,822,4.9416058394160585

2382815,5,B000AA4JNE,"Firstly-this is NOT, as the Amazon reviewer states a ""Mockumentary"".  Rather it is genuine interviews with real people.  The real humoue comes not just in what they say or the way they say it, but in how voice is matched to character.  Imagine a stern sounding lab mouse talking about working in a lab or denouncing growing an ""ear"" on the back of a mouse as said mouse walks behind him and looks at him quizically.

The humour is subtle as you recognise human traits in the creatures, especially if you watch the making of feature and see the director  acting it out as reference for the animators.

And yes, some American viewers may struggle with British regional dialects but give it time and maybe watch it again and really listen.

My favourite characters are Pickles the guide dog,  Captain Cuddlepuss and Trixie, a married cat and dog relaxing on a sofa, and Sid and Nancy the rats.  Animation fans won't be disappointed.",1140912000,7,929,4.6503067484662575

As far from reality TV as you can get, this series combines first rate claymation with decent scripting and superb delivery to fracture your funny bone.

The attention to detail is a delight. Each scene has background activites and ploys to keep your attention. The mannerisms of the clay characters are spot on as they raise an eyebrow, or scratch their back, or roll their eyes making them more real than half the people in the check out line at your mega store.

The only drawback is the too thick British accent at times. But that is a small challenge to the major mirth marathon burned on this DVD. My dog even enjoys it. 5 stars",1138665600,13,765,4.536231884057971

I saw the '05 Christmas special and loved it, and I was thrilled to get Season One on DVD.

The thing I love about the characters is the great detail and patience which obviously goes into every one of the vignettes (the bonus documentary on the DVD shows you just how it's done).  I especially love how they show human emotions in the animals, things you normaly wouldn't pick up on talking to a person, you see much more clearly with the creatures (eyebrow raises, movements of the face and body, etc.).

And the fun thing is they didn't have to write any of it!  The Great British Public is a howl when it comes to the asking of mundane questions (What's It All About, The Beach).  Cute, funny, sometimes thought provoking, you can't help but laugh all the way through.

I was first in line for tickets for Return of the Where-Rabbit. I love the humor, the slapstick, all of  Wallace's crazy inventions, and of course the claymation. None of this is to be found on this series of interviews with clay animals. The settings change (the vet, the circus, etc.) but the premise remains the same. The British accents of the different animals are at times hard to follow, as is the dry British humor. Imagine Wallace never leaving his chair telling the entire story ""A Close Shave"" - it wouldn't be the same. My 6 year old son couldn't follow the interviews, and I could barely make out anything funny. This alone may not be so bad, however the clay animals are fairly un-animated. They just lie or sit or stand there and talk into a clay microphone. Occasionally a dog might bat a ball with his paw, but slapstick it's not. Perhaps as an added feature to another Nick Park DVD, this might sit well, but at 133 minutes it drags on and on.

 I would love nothing more than to enjoy this disc as much as I do Park's other accomplishments. My suggestion is to save your money and buy some cheese, perhaps Gorgonzola!",1135900800,6,1294,4.360995850622406

2382824,5,B000AA4JNE,"I am just adoring Creature Comforts, the BBC series by Nick Park. If you've never seen the original short, you must.

Not too long ago I found out that Aardman Animation did this  series with the same concept. In the original Oscar-winning short, people visiting a zoo and living in a nursing home were interviewed, and their responses to the questions were edited and animated so you get to hear animals at the zoo talking about life in the zoo. In the series, that same concept is taken into every other aspect of animal life--animals in the garden, at the beach, in the sea, working jobs, flying, and even discussing evolution and the origin of the species...es.  What's the plural of Species? Speci?

When I read the reviews at Amazon.com, I was surprised to see several folks say that ""it gets old fast."" But I figured I knew what that was about, so we've been rationing ourselves since a friend plucked this DVD off my Amazon.com wishlist and had it sent to me for my birthday.  We've been watching no more than three or four a night, including the original short, which is also included on the DVD.

There are some real characters that you get to know through the series. A rat couple sitting out front of their house, relaxing and enjoying the sun. A dog and cat that lounge about on a sofa and have lived together for so long that their comfort together just couldn't be greater. A terrier with an amusing outlook on life and an infectious laugh. Two performing circus monkeys that... hehehe... well, to the educated listener, you can tell they're a little kinky. *snort* It's just so fun!

The wide variety in dialects available to the interviewers and animators clearly helped them with creating these characters--each animal is an ideal choice for the voice and content of its comments. If you didn't know about it, I highly recommend putting it on your list.",1133654400,35,1871,4.651515151515151
