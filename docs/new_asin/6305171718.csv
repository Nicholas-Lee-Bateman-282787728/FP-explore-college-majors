986143,5,6305171718,"In today's times it is often difficult to find a movie in which all family members can watch and enjoy.  Dr. Doolittle is a movie for all.  The audience is immediately captivated with its good humor, and interest. The  movie reaches out and grabs the heart of all animal lovers.  The film  focuses on the lives of every  animal species.  After seeing this film I  paid more attention to my animals.  They were a bit spoiled before, but now  even more so.  I highly recommend this film.",913161600,,485,4.459770114942529

986145,4,6305171718,"I really liked this movie.  It was funny and yet different considering what people usually expect from Eddie Murphy.  He was not rude or used a lot of bad language.  It shows that he is a very versatile actor.  He can  do good roles an roles where he hast to be the crudest person on earth.  Anyway, I thought that having the animals really talking and their lips  were in sinck with thier voices was a job well-done.  Some of the actors  that you think would never be good as a voice were pretty funny.  John  Legazamo was good as one of the rats.  The drinking monkey was also  hilarious.  Well, I can say nothing but good for this movie.",911260800,,640,4.225

My kids loved it and I paid the money because I was sick of what we had and the kids had the flu, so I caved.  The newer movies I can understand a little, but the older ones, specifically child oriented ones should be at no additional cost.

986400,3,6305171718,"Released in 1998 and directed by Betty Thomas, Dr. Dolittle is a family comedy starring Eddie Murphy as a doctor in San Francisco who re-encounters a curious talent he had as a child, the ability to understand the speech of animals. Kristen Wilson plays his wife while Oliver Platt and Richard Schiff are on hand as his colleagues. Peter Boyle plays a businessman who wants to buy their practice.

With Eddie Murphy and talking animals, I expected Dr. Dolittle to be better than it is. Its okay; there are some fun moments, but it never rises above decent. Kids should like it though.

The film runs 85 minutes and was shot in San Francisco, Busch Gardens and San Bernardino National Forest, California.

986481,5,6305171718,This a funny film for adults. I've added it to my movie collection because it entertained me. I like the idea of talking animals. I wish our pets could talk to us. Because there would be a lot less lonely people in the world. It would be nice if we could come home from a hard days work & sit down with our pets & carry on a real conversation with them. Your pets would always be understanding & always take your side cause they wouldn't know any better. LOL I loved this movie. I like Eddie Murphy too. Worth buying.,1474329600,,517,4.128712871287129

986550,1,6305171718,"HATE IT!!! My kid, age 10, HATES it! We hate it so much we decided to review to warn people. If your idea of humor (for you or your kids) is having a dr. put a thermometer up a dogs butt, by all means watch. Then there's the fat patient lady, who gets a shot on her fat butt. There is zero plot. Sex jokes that are inappropriate for kids and the list goes on. The author of Dr. Doolittle must be screaming out from his grave over this one. Truly depressing to see such sickness hoisted off as entertainment, particularly for kids. If there was a possibility of an infinity of negative stars for rating movies here, this one has won the grand negative prize! :(",1462147200,,660,4.2047244094488185

I think it's much better than the original, although the original was a musical and is hard to compare the two versions because of that. I am partial to musicals. This version added some very funny elements to the story that kept it moving at a good pace with frequent laughs. Good family fun!",1459036800,,421,4.410256410256411

While I will never get rid of the original (I have very fond memories from childhood (where I apparently chose seriously bad cinema) or my tastes have changed drastically!

987306,5,6305171718,"Dr. Dolittle is perhaps one of the funniest Eddie Murphy films around.  Let's be honest- those of you who own dogs and cats, you've probably wondered what it would be like if they could communicate with you.  Obviously they can't talk to you, but animals can feel so HUMAN sometimes, that sometimes you believe you can actually understand what they want and need.  That's what makes this movie so funny.  A variety of famous comedians do the voice overs for many of the animals in the film, and most of the time the movie maintains a humorous pace.  I was laughing on several occasions, especially with the dog that Eddie accidentally hit with his car that triggered the whole ""He can talk to animals"" storyline (again).

The pigeons were also funny, who were communicating with each other like real husbands and wives who don't get along, and they actually went to Eddie Murphy for some kind of marriage counseling-type thing (I kid you not!) I also enjoyed the tree owl who had a stick stuck to his wings, and the drunk monkey.  I think my favorite scene in the film was when word got around throughout the animal kingdom that Eddie could understand and help animals, and so Eddie opened the door to a variety of different animals storming into his place, demanding help since Eddie was the famous animal doctor.  It's really a strange movie, but I had a good time laughing and enjoyed just about everything.

As you can probably guess, Eddie Murphy was the only person who could understand the animals, so whenever an animal talked to him and he talked back, the people around him were looking at him like he was crazy!  That's another thing that made the movie so funny.  A solid film that's funny from beginning to end.",1184025600,2,1724,4.619672131147541

987348,3,6305171718,"A remake in name only, 1998's Dr. Dolittle casts a mercifully non-singing Eddie Murphy as the vexed vet. He regains his long-forgotten childhood power to understand the thoughts of animals after accidentally hitting a dog with his car one dark night (he hears the dog yell, ""Bonehead!"" before it gets up and scampers away). Suddenly a psychic radio wave is beamed to all animals, everywhere, and they flock to Dr. Dolittle for medical advice. Unlike the tuneful Rex Harrison character, Murphy's Dr. D is reluctant to accept his gift and goes to such great lengths to hide it, that those around him begin to suspect that he's got bats in his belfry.

When a circus tiger (voiced by Albert Brooks) falls seriously ill, Dolittle decides to do the right thing. Other animals include a drunken monkey (voiced by Phil Proctor), a flatulent rat (voiced by John Leguizamo), an obssesive-compulsive mutt (voiced by Gilbert Gottfried), and a thorny owl (voiced by Jenna Elfman). A sequel, also starring Murphy in the title role, was released in 2001 (with Steve Zahn giving voice to a lovelorn brown bear).

987352,4,6305171718,"Based on the children's story and brought to life in a new way, Eddie Murphy in DR DOOLITTLE is a cute kids comedy and a pretty good comedy in general.  And there's a lot of funny parts with the animals in this movie and it's very touching as well.
As a kid, John Doolittle (Murphy) didn't have too many friends but the friends he did have were special to hum because he was the only who could understand him.  Why? Because they were animals.  He could talk to and understand animals.  But after he got in trouble for talking with the family dog, he was forced to stop talking to animals.  Now as an adult, after an accident where he hit a dog, he realizes that he heard the dog talk to him.  Now he realizes that he still has his gift and now it's a question if he can keep his sanity and if he can do the right thing and help everyone that needs him, including the animals.
This one is really cute and kids will love this one.  Plus it's pretty funny as well.  And of course there are plenty of other celebrities pitching their voices for this movie like Pee Wee Herman, Chris Rock, Norm McDonald, Jenna Elfman, John Leguizamo and Albert Brooks to name a few.  The soundtrack to this movie is also very good as well with Aaliyah, All Saints, Wu-Tang's Raekwon and more.
The kids will love this one and this a good comedy for the entire family.  It's very clean and there isn't any swearing or any adult themes at all.  It's a very fun movie.  Check out DR DOOLITTLE and don't forget to check out DR DOOLITTLE 2.  Enjoy this family comedy!",1042156800,2,1540,4.25085910652921
987353,3,6305171718,"When my grandchildren brought over to my house the movie Dr. Dolittle, I shuddered to think what kind of language might be on the video.  I kept my hand on the remote control, ready to change channels at the first sign of Eddy Murphy's colorful lanugage from his past movies.  But I was surprised to see that wasn't to be.  Most of the language my grandchildren didn't understand anyway but they enjoyed watching the animals talk.
The Dr. Dolittle movie is a great escape from our everyday life routine.  I have watched this movie about 15 times and each time I crack up laughing at the scene where Eddy Murphy (John) wakes up in bed and realizes something is crawling on his chest.  John lifts the sheet to find Rodney (the family's guinea pig).  John lets out a terrifying scream.
John along with his two partners are trying to sell their medical practice for a large sum of money.  John is married to a very supportive wife and they have two kids.  Pressures from the sell of the practice and all of the talking animals are taking a toll on poor John.  Everyone thinks John is cracking up.  John checks into a medical center.  One thing after another happens, which I will not reveal because you need to watch this movie yourself.
John medically treats the talking animals anywhere from plucking a twig from an owl""s wing to operating on a lion.  Eddy Murphy could not have done such a good job without all of the star menagerie voices of:  Chris Rock, John Lequizamo, Norm MacDonald, Albert Books, Garry Shandling and Ellen DeGeneres.  Talking animal movies have been done before but they are what makes this movie seem exceptionally funny.
Dr. Dolittle is a ""must"" see movie, there is a moral to the story.  It can teach children that just because you might be ""different"" does not mean you are ""weird"".",1033948800,3,1808,4.588785046728972

In terms of being a childrens' film, all I can say is that I was truly embarrassed to be sitting there with my 8 year old companion. Luckily, the jokes fairly much went right over his head. Has Murphy pushed the boundaries? A resounding yes! As the society we live in becomes more primitive and unkind, we can thank ""entertainers"" like this one for helping it slip down a few more notches.",1021766400,15,634,4.669642857142857
987412,4,6305171718,"Like a lot of people who believe themselves to be worldly, I put my little barriers up when I encounter a film like ""Dr. Dolittle"". When you think of yourself as a sophisticate, it's hard to reach the child within. You hope the kid left long ago.
The truth is that few people grow up entirely. Halfway through this movie, I threw in the towel and decided to admit I was enjoying this adolescent gem. It's infectious.
Eddie Murphy's Dr. Dolittle is not recognizable as the character in the Hugh Loftis book. He's been totally updated. The only element left from the novel is Dolittle's ability to talk to animals. He understands them. They converse. Thankfully they do not sing, as they did in the dreadful Rex Harrison musical comedy thirty years ago. That film lost a fortune for Fox Studio. At this late date, Mr. Murphy and friends seem to have recovered its money.
It may seem like a gift to be able to communicate with guinea pigs, owls, dogs, pigs, pigeons and other creatures. This gift could be a one-way ticket to the funny farm, which is the problem Dolittle faces.
One of the best things about ""Dr. Dolittle"" is that it's short. The producers were wise enough to get in and out before the audience realized this was basically a one joke, one special effect story.
Murphy seems to have undergone a personal transformation in the last few years. Now he is completely at ease and in control in gentle comedies like this and ""The Nutty Professor"", just as he was in the sexy and crime-driven vehicles that made him a movie star in the 1980s.
It was bathroom humor that earned this picture a PG-13 rating. It may have deserved it, but kids seem to learn this stuff younger these days. Maybe they are just more open than my generation was. This touch of crudeness helps ""Dr. Dolittle"" to work. Full of smart remarks, these animals are survivors. They are also endearing. They assure that the movie never becomes sickeningly sweet. Besides, nobody expects Eddie Murphy to give up his bad boy image completely.
One element I found interesting is that, despite all the advances in digital special effects, when you see a lot of animals talking on screen, it doesn't look any more real than it did in the days of Francis the Talking Mule. It just cost ten times as much to create the effect.",1017273600,,2292,4.579075425790754

Yes, the animal voices are very well-done and are the movies bright spot.  All the stars do a great job and they are really the only reason to see the film.
Unfortuantly, when it comes to the human cast and the writing, Dr. Dolittle is less interesting than the origional film.  To begin with, this has got to be one of Eddie Murphy's weakest performances ever.  He's just boring.  His family is fairly dull as well ranching from bland to obnoxious.  The script isn't that great either.  In the Nutty Professor, many excused the toilet humor because of Murphy's great performance or because of the occasional, witty line.  This is simply not the case here and the movie is simply boring.
I judge a comedy on how much it makes me laugh and Dr. Dolittle failed miserably in this department.  It's simply not funny.",994550400,2,895,4.54375
987417,4,6305171718,"This movie is definitely low-brow humor, but then you don't expect Shakespeare from Eddie Murphy. That said, I enjoyed this outing immensly. Eddie is his at his hilarious best and the supporting cast of animals is also very funny. If you like Eddie Murphy, see this movie.",993772800,,272,4.808510638297872
987418,1,6305171718,"Eddie ""Egomaniac"" Murphy needs to sit down, or pay someone to sit down, and think of an actual new movie that he can star in. It is been shown that he can make money off of murdering old movies and making them ""his own"". The real truth be told, these films are painfully unfunny. The Nutty Professor series is one that needs to be put to sleep. With a sequel planned for this film, it further demonstrates the fact that Eddie ""Egomaniac"" Murphy is tired of trying new things, he just wants to do the same old stuff, and then sit at home and count his money. All i have to say is that Eddie ""Egomaniac"" Murphy is just trying to con hardworking Americans out of their money. I say that we stop giving it to him.",977011200,5,709,4.182481751824818
987419,5,6305171718,"This very funny remake of the 1960's classic stars Eddie Murphy as Dr John  Dolittle, a busy physician, who, when he almost runs over a stray dog, is  forced to recall his long forgotten gift - his ability to hear the voices  of animals.  A great family movie without all the sshtick of a usual Eddie  Murphy feature, its humour, admittedly a tad corny and lame, nevertheless  hits the mark as it delivers a stableful of belly laughs.  If only animals  could talk - they'd probably be more honest than humans are!",968284800,,513,4.5

987458,4,6305171718,I say this movie has fresh and old funnyness. But this is the type of movie where you have to leave your head at the door other wise you will find this movie stuped and not funny or bathroom humor so to speak. This  movie is worth a watch but this is not the type of movie you want to add to  your colection.,957139200,,308,3.796875

Oh yeah, this movie is wayyyyyyyyyyy better than the original, get with it  people, it's the 90's (no offense! ). I reckon there should be a sequel.

987464,4,6305171718,"This is one funny movie - without the trashmouth stereotype Eddie Murphy flavour.
I don't know if I was in silly mode when I first watched this one, but I was crying whilst laughing. The dog plays a classic role, with  the voice overs bringinga fantastic laugh. If you need something to pick  you up, or plain want a good, and reasonably clean, laugh, then this is for  you. Eddie plays Dad (Doolittle) and ends up helping a tiger that no one  else cared about.
A good, and very funny family flick.",945302400,,498,4.380434782608695

This movie, however, like most Eddie Murphy movies, contains situations, and humor, that is very much directed at  adults.  I took my son (7 years old)to see this movie, and HE asked to  leave early.  I was totally disappointed.  Bring back the original Dr.  Dolittle.",920505600,,375,4.765625
987523,5,6305171718,I really liked Doctor Dolittle it was so funny especially with Eddie Murphy in it.  I like the story line of how a 5 year old talks to the animals then as he grows up he forgets and then as he is a vet he heards  noises and its the animals they are actually talking to him.  At first  people think hes gone crazy and insane so they lock him up in a hospital  then after he proves he isn't insane and the animals are talkin to him he  winds up a hero and a good vet.  I recommaned this movie its a great family  movie and its so funny.  Eddie Murphy played the vet real well and  I don't  think that with out him in it it would be as funny as it was.  I just love  Doctor Dolittle and think it was a very great movie i give it a thumbsup.  I would see it over and over and still it would be funny to me.  I  recommaned people see it with there families,917568000,,851,3.75
