8367704,2,B002EIJ9A8,Got this as a gift form a non music friend. I was excited until I played it to find it in a totally different language. Very sad I gave it to my friend that was client German and he loves it. Sucks for me though.,1361491200,,212,3.7333333333333334
8367705,1,B002EIJ9A8,"WHY NO CONCERT OF THEM ANYWHERE????????? Videos,Documentarys,all this ""Stuff"" and not a full length concert ANYWHERE!!!  WHY????",1264982400,4,128,6.529411764705882
8367706,2,B002EIJ9A8,"In the description of this DVD, it says that the language is English and subtitles are in German.  I thought I would be able to turn off the subtitles or that they would be printed at the bottom of the screen, when in fact, the Def Leppard members are speaking in English and a reporter translates in German over them, so that all one can hear is the German language--the band members voices are ""drowned out.""  The DVD begins with an event honoring the group, then goes to a studio where one sees them interviewed.  That's really all there is to the DVD.  If you want to complete your Def Leppard collection, then get it, but if you want to understand the comments of the band members, then you may want to reconsider.  Maybe this will prompt me to study German. LOL",1254960000,20,767,4.373239436619718
