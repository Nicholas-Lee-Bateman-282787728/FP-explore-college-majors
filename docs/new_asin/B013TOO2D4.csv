My favorite thing about it is the bond between the two main characters, Marin and Kanon. The girls seem nothing alike at first, but they become friends anyway, and must work together to seal away Sedna, an ancient evil. But as their quest goes on, they discover that what they've been told may not be the exact truth...

Another great thing about this show is the music. A lot of it is gentle piano music that can easily lull you to sleep. The opening song, Violet, is also of this nature and is a joy to listen to. The visuals are fantastic as well, especially the magic effects!

My all-time favorite thing about this show, and what makes it stand out for me most, though, is the lesson at the end. In a lot of magical girl shows, darkness is synonymous with evil. Some evil characters may be sympathetic, but they're still on the 'wrong' side. That isn't the case here. In Umi Monogatari, everyone has darkness within them, and THATS OKAY. Accept your inner darkness, your fears and flaws, because throwing it out or fighting the emotions won't solve anything. That simple idea has helped me so much in life, and I want to rewatch this show as a reminder, so I can be a better me.",1454025600,,1251,4.383620689655173
8728765,5,B013TOO2D4,"Fantasy that at first seems a standard good vs evil story line but it is much deeper than that. Yes the animation and the storyline could be a little better but nonetheless it is worth  watching. Realize this is about feelings and sorrows and they do not always lend themselves to perfectly logical events. I will however take issue to two previous reviews. Firstly, 'non Enblish hard to understand' Of course it is not in Enblish it is a Japanese anime but the sub-titles are in English and perfectly understandable. The other review is one which seems to be of Amazons description of the show rather than the series, though the reviewer fails to state this. No where on my copy of the DVD, or at the Nozomi Entertainment site, o at a couple of other retailers I checked does it state this has an English Language soundtrack. Do not review DVDs on the basis of Amazon's Description without specifically saying that is what it is and review the show objectively. So overall this is a watchable and entertaining series maybe not outstanding but nonetheless pretty good.",1448409600,10,1068,4.711229946524064

8728768,1,B013TOO2D4,"This Said that it is Dubbed in English, but the defention of english dub in regarding to english dubbed ANIME is.

(n)/(v). A type of Japanese anime that has its original Japanese voices removed and replaced by English voiceovers by English voice actors. This is different from subbed anime, which has english subtitles while still preserving the unchanged and more natural Japanese voices of the original anime.
But if it had been in English Dub I would have had so much more to say.",1446595200,4,484,4.761904761904762
