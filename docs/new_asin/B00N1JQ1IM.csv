6605247,3,B00N1JQ1IM,"I am a fan of a number of the main actors in this film, and how it got by under my radar this long, I don't know. But, I did just finish watching it, and I wanted to make sure I posted a review while it was fresh. I should note that, in addition to my affinity for Beckinsale and Kingsley, I am also a fan of the Victorian/pre-1900 (if only just, in this case) period (yes, a bit of a Steampunk aficionado) - especially period thrillers. So, with those biases clearly stated... I found this film compelling, both visually and with regard to the unfolding plot. The characters, on all levels, were interesting, even the minor players in the asylum in which the film is set. I don't like to offer spoilers, even with alerts, so my reviews tend to be brief and to the point. In keeping with this, I enjoyed this movie and would recommend it without hesitation for anyone who finds the aforementioned interesting.",1414281600,,909,4.416666666666667

6605249,4,B00N1JQ1IM,"METHOD OR MADNESS --- A DARK ASYLUM TALE THAT PLUMBS  THE BLURRED LINES OF MADNESS AND THE SOMETIMES INSANE TREATMENT OF THE MENTALLY ILL - CIRCA 1900 TO CREATE ITS ATMOSPHERIC PREMISE.

AN HONEST PROS AND CONS REVIEW  -- AND THE ALL TIME CLASSIC IT COULD HAVE BEEN.

THE PLOT (no spoilers):  Very loosely based on a tale by Edgar Allen Poe (The System of Doctor Tarr and Professor Fether).  After a brief scene at a medical school lecture with distraught mental patient Eliza Graves on display, our story switches venue and begins more in earnest with the arrival of recently graduated medical doctor Edward Newgate at Stonehearst Asylum just before new years 1900.  The scene is immersively macabre and more than a little reminiscent of the arrival of Johnathan Harker in Bram Stoker's Dracula.  We quickly see that the hauntingly beautiful Lady Eliza Graves is now an inmate at this asylum, under a different doctor's care.  The very modern thinking Doctor Newgate soon realizes that things are very unconventional at this asylum.  Dr Newgate's idealism is met with odd glances and guardedness.  In one scene, we see a man who believes he is a horse.  The asylum administrator Dr Lamb (Ben Kingsley), with some smugness, explains that they do not attempt to cure people there.  ""why would you turn a perfectly happy horse into a miserable man?""  Twists and turns of plot are everywhere in this tale and everyone seems to have a secret.  Dr Newgate develops an affection or an obsession for Lady Graves which will put more than one story arc into conflict.  Dr Newgate shows great prescience and medical prowess in how he reaches the unreachable mental patients.  But, how will he resolve the darker secrets of Stonehearst and it's residents as they come to light?

One of the great strengths of this movie is the exceptional character creation, from the main players to the cast of mental patients.  The acting, production values are all wonderful.  The visuals of the foggy winter countryside and gothic asylum are very beautiful and evocative.  The story, or I should say each of the story arcs, are very strong and very engaging for the viewer.  Comedy relief comes into play here and there which is very clever and very funny. At times it's in danger of lightening the macabre feel.  However, Poe's tale was also a dark comedy.  Each of the story arcs are masterful.  They all tie together, yet feel a little separate and in competition with each other sometimes.  The final scene was a very nice touch.  Nevertheless, with such a great story, acting, and cinematography, the process of tying all the competing arcs together wasn't as powerful as I thought it could have been.  There is plenty of fog, bleak countryside and dark gothic setting that hint at a horror tale, yet this is not really a horror story.  We explore the controversial medical practices for the insane during that century, but that's not exactly the story either.  We also delve into the obsession of various people with Eliza.  With just a little extra run time I believe all of these elements could have been easily kept, while smoothing out the lurch between each one.  This is a wonderful movie.  All I am asserting is that everything was there to make it an all time classic and one of my very favorite films.  Instead, I have a film that I enjoy greatly and am happy to own.  I would love to see a slightly longer edit with the motivations woven more smoothly.

This is a terrific movie and a first day purchase for me.  I recommend you rent it first rather than buying sight unseen.",1414195200,40,3568,4.715210355987055
6605250,5,B00N1JQ1IM,"Review of Stonehearst Asylum
Hot Toasty Rag, December 2, 2017

On Imdb, Stonehearst Asylum is described perfectly in one sentence: An Oxford graduate takes up a job in a mental asylum, only to discover that the new treatments are inhumane and there is more going on than meets the eye. Thats all you need to know before watching this film, besides the all-star cast: Jim Sturgess, Kate Beckinsale, Michael Caine, Ben Kingsley, David Thewlis, Brendan Gleeson, and Sinead Cusack. This is a fantastic movie, one that I would add to my lineup of Halloween movies, except that I wouldnt want to wait and only watch it once a year!

Jim Sturgess plays the new doctor, and hes mature and charming, which shows a new side to his acting. Fans of his, or anyone who only knows him as the Beatles guy, will be very impressed. Kate Beckinsale is beautiful and mysterious, providing a classy and luminous element to the otherwise spooky setting. Those who have seen Ben Kingsley and Michael Caine together in the hilarious film Without a Clue will be delighted to see them reunited, and with an entirely different screen relationship. . .

While most of the film is scary, its not filled with gotcha scares or gore. Its very tasteful, and puts the audience in a constant state of suspense rather than frightening them so much so that they won't be able to sleep that night. The lighting and sets truly transport the audience to the time period, and Joe Gangemi fleshes out Edgar Allan Poes story wonderfully. Brad Andersons direction includes a wonderful attention to detail, so that when you watch it for the second or sixth time, you're still getting more out of it. With a touch of humorDavid Thewliss character is named Mickey Finnand an incredibly intriguing story, this is a film to treasure. Also, be sure to keep an eye out for Ben Kingsleys son Edmund, in the small role as Kate Beckinsales husband!

Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to some scary scenes, I wouldnt let my kids watch it until they're a little older.",1512172800,,2059,4.727019498607242
6605251,4,B00N1JQ1IM,"Very well-executed.  Images are great.  Acting is great.  Intriguing, thoughtful story.  I rolled my eyes at the (in my opinion, unnecessary) final twist, but I enjoyed the ride.",1510444800,,178,5.25

6605278,5,B00N1JQ1IM,"As noted by many, this film has an engaging plot and excellent cast including the always elegant Kate Beckinsale who puts forth a resonating performance and Jim Sturgess, one of the few current, young, mainstream actors capable of pulling off a certain level of vulnerability and charm.  To the male reviewer who objects to Sturgess's character, he can't deny that he plays the part brilliantly and there are few talented and attractive leading men like him left who are willing or even capable of stepping outside the typical macho, homoerotic stereotype of manhood in the modern Western world to take on what initially seems a somewhat unflattering role and turn it into an understated and nuanced performance.  I'm sure the testosterone-dominated film industry would like to sweep all Jim Sturgesses under the rug as a threat to their masculinity as well as bury a film which portrays a woman who is psychologically damaged as a result of her husband's lecherous and violent behavior.  And due to the establishment typically being opposed to the idea that they are not the best ones to decide who is sane versus insane and the unflinching portrayal of war as having irredeemably ugly consequences, it's a miracle this film ever even saw the light of day.  Despite the lack of marketing, we can be sure the actors saw something worthwhile in the project. It's a beautiful accomplishment, and I applaud and thank the director, actors and other contributing parties for taking the risk.",1480118400,,1486,4.979838709677419

The architecture and costumes were gorgeous. For the most part I would say this is more of a mystery/thriller, with some horror coming in at the end. I really enjoyed all the twists, just when I thought the movie would go one way, it went in a different/better direction.

It really makes you think in regards to who really was the monster/mad person when it came to psychiatric medicine during this era. (And perhaps, still today.) Drugging a person so they don't act differently then what is considered the norm in society, or force feeding someone to eat who does not want to.

This particular one is days away from seeing the end of the 1800s with new years day 1900 fast approaching.  Also approaching the asylum is a man looking for a great opportunity. He's recently been to Oxford University and wants an opportunity for some real life patient experience. He did send a letter telling them he was on his way, he never heard back but surely they'll employ him.  He soon learns that the asylum and patient interaction is nothing like he expected.

6605329,2,B00N1JQ1IM,"...would be as drab and derivative.  Looney bins are creepy.  The nineteenth century's ideas about mental hygiene (and science, in general) are primitive by today's standards.  Edgar Allan Poe made a living writing about the dark duplicities of the human soul and loved to titillate his readers with surprise endings. When you put actors in Victorian outfits and give them operose period dialogue to memorize, their acting seems to improve. If any of these declarations come as news to you, you may enjoy Brad Anderson's extrapolation of Poe's amusingly macabre short story 'The System of Doctor Tarr and Professor Fether,' called 'Stonehearst Asylum' (Icon, 2014), a lot more than I did.  The film slogs along prettily, atmospherically, like a multi-million-dollar resurrection of a Price/Corman plum from the sixties, moving from one chiaroscuro-steeped moment of scenery chewing to the next until we get to Poe's twist, which apparently was inadequate for SA's producers, who proceed to overseason the soup with a couple familiar Freudian subplots and then tack on an unnecessary (and not all that interesting) surprise ending of their own.  All this might seem quaint, or 'retro,' or different, were it not for the fact that it's been done before a thousand times-- nine hundred of them more effectively.  2 stars for the photography and sets, and the variable efforts of a large and formidable cast.

P.S. - I lament whatever's happened to director Anderson, who began his career so promisingly with indies like 'Happy Accidents' (2000), the chilling 'Session 9' (2001) and 2004's overhyped but stylish 'The Machinist,' then descended rapidly into creative mediocrity with projects like 'Transsiberian' (2008), myriad mainstream-TV episodes, 2013's 'The Call' and now this.  Similarly, Kate Beckinsale's screen presence has become so peculiarly bland since her vibrant early work in such films as 'Cold Comfort Farm' and 'Haunted' (both 1995), one wonders if Hollywood stardom has had some neutralizing effect on her ability to emote.  The wages of 'success,' perhaps...",1445817600,2,2075,5.36

'Edward Newgate' (Jim Sturgess) arrives at 'Stonehearst Asylum' seeking .in the field of Mental Illness......
'Edward' appears to have a very idealistic approach and will find the methods adopted at the Asylum very
different from what he expected.
The superintendant 'Dr Silas Lamb' (Ben Kingsley) welcomes his new apprentice, patient 'Eliza Graves' (Kate
Beckinsale) almost immediately catches 'Edwards' attention whilst playing a piano for some of the other
patient.
'Edward' soon realizes things at the Asylum are not right, does he listen to what he is being told to him by
seemingly coherent patients locked behind bars such as 'Benjamin Salt' (Michael Caine) ...what risk to himself
is there by investigating his suspicions.
He is told that the good Doctor assisted by attendant 'Mickey Finn' (David Thewlis) would dispose of him without
the blink of an eye if he suspected what 'Edward's' intentions are....
The problem is....who is there that 'Edward' can truly rely upon ..?
A star-studded cast list in this often dark tale which is based upon a short story by 'Edgar Allan Poe' in which roles
appear to have been reversed..........a story with an unexpected twist in the tail........well worth a viewing.

6605497,3,B00N1JQ1IM,"The old saying about the inmates running the asylum is fully realized in Stonehearst Asylum, based upon the short story  ""The System of Doctor Tarr and Professor Fether"" by Edgar Allan Poe.  Set in Victorian Era England, Jim Sturgess Is Edward Newgate, a recent graduate of Oxford Medical School, who arrives at the secluded Stonehearst Asylum for his first assignment.  Stonehearst is home to mental patients who come from some of the wealthiest families in Europe, including those who are related to royalty.

Newgate meets the asylums head psychiatrist Dr. Silas Lamb (Kingsley) who shares his alternative treatments for treating the mentally ill.  Lamb doesnt subscribe to the many inhumane treatments and medicines that are commonplace of the era.  Despite his seeming benevolent nature, Newgate begins to suspect that all is not as it seems.  His suspicions are heightened when he meets the beautiful Eliza Graves (Beckinsale) who warns him to leave immediately.

Newgate explores the lower level of the Asylum, stumbling upon a dungeon where several men and women are held prisoner.  One of those is a man who claims to be Dr. Salt (Caine) the true head of the facility and that the rest of the prisoners are the asylums staff, imprisoned by the inmates who have now taken over.  Newgate is torn between escaping the hospital and trying to save the staff as well as Eliza with whom he has fallen in love.

Stonehearst Asylum reminds me of one of those 1700s/1800s Gothic novels that concentrate too much on the romantic sub-plots and not enough on the thriller aspects.  Its muddled tone fails to make a connection with the viewer.  While Lamb has imprisoned the true staff of the Asylum, his methods seem to be effective and certainly more humane than those of Dr. Salts.  With whom are we supposed to sympathize?  Theres simply not enough conflict.

Certainly Stonehearst Asylum features a tremendous cast and its not relegated only to its well-known lead characters.  The supporting cast is also exceptional.  It would have been nice to see a few more scenes with Kingsley and Caine together as these two have been titans in the world of acting for so many decades.

This is a gorgeously filmed movie which exquisitely captures the dread and murkiness of the fog-shrouded English countryside, with the massive asylum lurking in the background.  The gloominess of the Asylum itself lends to the pitch-perfect atmosphere.  However the slow-moving narrative and lack of ny tangible conflict keeps the film from realizing its potential.

6605503,4,B00N1JQ1IM,"Inspired by a short story from Edgar Allan Poe, Stonehearst Asylum is a film of a collection of different genres. Previously known as Eliza Graves,it tells a story of a young doctor Edward Newgate arrives at Stonehearst Asylum in search of an apprenticeship. He is welcomed by Dr. Lamb and a beautiful woman,Eliza Graves. Edward gets exposed Dr. Lamb's methods of treating mentally ill patients that leads him to discover various things that are happening inside the asylum as well as the hidden mystery behind Eliza.

While it is far from a classic,it manages to be a fun film of different genres. It manages to balance humor,melodrama,romance,thriller and horror which becomes a wonderful achievement of the director,Anderson. As for the performances,the cast did very well despite the fact that there was nothing really outstanding or award-winning in it. Besides,the cast are known to be outstanding in their careers.

Michael Caine and ben Kingsley are particularly good.  The movie stars out with a very dark premise about various kinds of torture, including shock treatment, masquerading as psychiatry in the nineteenth century, making us first wonder who are the patients and who are the doctors and then wonder if the patients or the doctors and staff are better at running the asylum.  After the first twenty minutes,the film goes slowly downhill as an ordinary Gothic melodrama with a twist ending.  I was hoping for darker, scarier, and more original plot turns.

6605579,3,B00N1JQ1IM,"This is a good one, better than I had expected.

Good script--not familiar with the Poe source material, but hunch little remains of it but the bare outline. If so, that's to the (young, fairly new) screenwriter's credit.

Hats off to Director Dan Anderson, who almost equals his previous good work in Transsiberian (2008)  Anderson keeps it rolling, and sets scenes up really well--especially in the last half.  Anderson's deft hand creates a riveting climax . Even better work to come, I suspect.

The cast is great: Beckinsale, Kingsley, especially; Gleeson, in a small-but-juicy part.  Jim Sturgess is decent in one of his first major roles, the protege of the Asylum's superintendent (lead doctor.)  Michael Caine's a bit wasted, here, though. Producers ""Nice name value...""  Caine: ""What the heck, good to keep working...""

The sets are suitably atmospheric.

What isn't expected is what happens in the final half-hour. THAT is the surprise--and well worth the wait. Which is nice, because about half-way through, we've ""solved"" all but two of the mysteries, and the question is--we think!--""OK, how will this turn out?""  So it's MYSTERY time, not HORROR time--a difference that has eluded some critics who were obviously expected (as did I) more of the latter than the former.

So, some meditation on madness, the nature of ""cure"" and ""assistance"" and an acknowledgement that, with madness, all is not what it seems (the premise of the plot itself!) and, finally, a wistful, resigned coda,

Very satisfying on all levels.",1422921600,,1528,5.112903225806452

Kate Beckinsale has been one of my favorite actresses going on ten years now.  She can do action, drama, and period pieces equally well.  Ben Kingsley has never given a bad performance in his career.  This is an all-star cast of very talented professionals.  In any case, previous reviews have done a good job of summarizing the plot for you.  With that in mind, I chose to focus mine on the acting performances.  The cast is primarily made up of well-known and well-regarded veteran actors and actresses.  Worth watching just for that alone.  However, as has been stated by other reviews, the plot is unusual, original, and suspenseful.  No, you will not find a gore-fest here.  No nudity, unfortunately.  The plot unfolds at a slow pace at times.  But the atmosphere of foreboding and of being caught are constantly present starting from about 30 minutes into the movie all the way to the end.

So, who's really running the show at Stonehearst Asylum?  What is the mysterious attraction between Dr. Newgate and Mrs. Graves?

6605598,2,B00N1JQ1IM,"Brad Anderson's ""Stonehearst Asylum"" suggests an air of class and elegance that the traditional mechanisms of the Edgar Allan Poe adapted story greatly undermine. The initial ""twist"", which comes not even a third of the way into the film, is so shopworn that we feel the naturally intriguing presence of Ben Kingsley and Michael Cain (who do excellent work here and remain consistently watchable throughout) keeping this slowly sinking ship afloat.

  The cinematography, atmosphere all suggest an elegant feel perfectly fitting for a Poe adaption, but after this tired turn in the narrative comes into play the last 2/3 seem obvious, pulling the curtain open to expose the motion picture for the beautiful looking shallowness which coincides with the majority of events after the true chronicle, and character motivations, are unveiled. Therefore, though containing the appropriately subtle overtones, it fails as a mystery, because it has no genuine surprises, and as a drama.

  The last half hour has some life but, amid its chaos is further tedium setting in. This is because the finale is eye-rolling in its wholly predictable manner. Worst of all, it ruins the only chance at building genuine suspense the fairly intriguing first act sets up well, with allure and eloquence, and than abandons in hopes that the grade A cast's incredible and engrossing performances would be enough to recommend it. It's not.

  Just as disappointing is that the last few minutes unveil a few turns in plot which are just as tired and contrived as the one which commenced right before the duration began to fall apart. It wants to be the next ""Shutter Island"", its parallels are undeniable, or any of the legions of asylum tales set in the past that have come and go and ends up relying so much on what we've all seen umpteen times before that it becomes just another shadow in a forgotten corridor populated by intriguing characters that, when all is said and done, we wish we could know better.",1422489600,2,1985,4.954819277108434

6605691,4,B00N1JQ1IM,"Edgar Allan Poe initiated this `which side of madness are you on' tale in a short story that was adapted for the screen by Joe Gangemi  and directed by Brad Anderson (The Machinist, The Call, Transsiberian,etc) . It is a period piece, very dark in theme and in cinematic transformation, and it boasts a huge cast of very highly respected actors.

The time is turn of the century (1899-2000) and a recent medical school grad Doctor Edward Newgate (Jim Sturgess) arrives at Stonehearst Asylum in search of an apprenticeship, he is warmly welcomed by superintendent Dr. Lamb (Ben Kingsley) and a mesmerizing woman by the name of Eliza Graves (Kate Beckinsale). Edward is intrigued by Lamb's modern methods of treating the insane until a series of unusual events leads him to make a horrifying discovery, exposing Lamb's  utopia and pushing Edward to the limits of his conscience - a recent, horrifying staffing change. Lamb is the mad one and the true staff of the asylum are locked in the boiler room as Lamb's prisoners. How Newgate discovers and addresses this issue is the gist of the bizarre story. And there are some terrific surprises in store....

LIkrly the film would not have worked so well under less competent actors hands, but Anderson was wise in casting David Thewlis, Brendan Gleeson, Ben Kingsley, Michael Cain, Sinad Cusack, Jason Flemyng, as well as Kate Beckinsale and Jim Sturgess. It may at firs seem like another Brad Anderson thriller, but there are some twist and turns that alter the story into a truly psychological examination of just what is insanity.

6605721,3,B00N1JQ1IM,"If you liked the movie ""Shutter Island"" and Tim Burton's ""Sleepy Hollow"" and things of that sort which go bump in the night, this might be for you. It's not bad. It's flawed, because this film lures you in with the promise of a gothic horror tale, and that is actually not delivered. But I should be fair, and say that this is an engaging thriller, and marvelous to look at.

This movie was directed by Brad Anderson (he also did the creepy psychological horror cult film ""Session 9"" in 2001, one of my macabre favorites, and also the delightfully unsettling and surreal ""The Machinist"" in 2004) and written by Joseph Gangemi, based on the short story ""The System of Doctor Tarr and Professor Fether"" by Edgar Allan Poe; featuring Kate Beckinsale, Jim Sturgess, Michael Caine, Ben Kingsley, and David Thewlis.

After a brief introductory sequence, an ominous fog settles across the countryside and the stark forest during Christmas time in 1899, eerily obscuring the spooky-looking behemoth that is Stonehearst Asylum. A young doctor has arrived, to begin work at this sprawling place ... and his arrival scene is nothing short of 'Universal Studio monster movie' goodness. I thought to myself, This is for me.

I won't ruin things with plot details. Suffice to say that before long our young Dr. Newgate learns that something is wrong at this place, and his delving into the asylum's secrets could cost this man a great deal. The acting was solid (how could it not be, from this cast?) as is the production design and period details and sets and costumes and all that turn-of-the-century gloominess. The atmosphere was very pleasing. Plus, any movie that can make use of Saint Saens' ""Danse Macabre"" in a fun way is okay in my book.",1419033600,6,1733,4.789297658862877

6605723,5,B00N1JQ1IM,"Touching and thought-provoking, the story line has touched my heart and continues to linger on my mind. The movie brings to light the ancient question of insanity - what is madness and how it can be treated. Should it be treated altogether? The theme raises so many heart-wrenching questions and contains no simple answers. Mr. Kinsley who plays Dr. Lam is superb - the role of a wise doctor becomes him; think ""Shatter Island"" which has similar theme and topic. This movie is inspiring me to delve into reading more of Edgar Allen Poe.",1418947200,2,536,4.712765957446808

6605740,5,B00N1JQ1IM,"When we first see Stonehearst Asylum it is shrouded in fog, and there is a raven croaking at the gate. A freaking RAVEN. That was the first sign to me, that this movie was not going to be your run-of-the-mill period chiller. And you know what? It delivers on every level. Start with a masterful cast playing vibrant, lurid characters, throw in a fast-paced, surprisingly fun script with enough twists to astound even the most astute viewer, and saturate it with some excellent atmosphere and mood, all shadows, secrets, and flickering candle lights!

Let's talk about the cast first, because what a cast it is. Jim Sturgess leads as Dr. Edward Newgate, who with his wimpy mustache and thick spectacles, seems the most unlikely-looking romantic lead in Hollywood. But its also a brilliant and stunning performance filled with surprising gravitas. Kate Beckinsale shocks everyone with a vulnerable and subtly beautiful performance as a 'chronic hysteric'. But it is Sir Ben Kingsley as Dr. Silas Lamb that electrifies the entire screen and steals all of the scenes. All of them. I haven't seen a good actor have this much fun since Coppola's Dracula. Sir Ben is an acting BEAST in this movie. David Thewlis, Michael Caine, and Brendan Gleeson - all some of the greatest actors all to step in front of a camera, have memorable side roles, all hiding dark secrets and captivating the audience.

The performances are so electrifying, so subtle, so powerful and of so high a calibre, they elevate what could have easily been overblown Gothic camp or a boring chiller, into a thrilling spectacle unlike anything we've seen in a while. There are no black-or-white heroes or villains; the doctors are sometimes cruel, the lunatics are angry but pathetic. This allows for some unexpected real drama and truly interesting characters.

Then there's the plot, which is apparently an elegant and terrifying confection of madness, secrets, and twists and turns on every front. The setting could not be more ripe for horror. I mean, a Victorian lunatic asylum perpetually shrouded in fog and thunder? With RAVENS croaking at the spiked iron gates? But thankfully, STONEHEARST ASYLUM eschews the jump scare for the subtle build-up of dread, and blood and gore for mind games, dark secrets, hidden passages, and classy tension. Until that is, the Asylum and everyone in it goes mad. There's something timelessly macabre about two hundred lunatics madly dancing round a bonfire, or dancing to classical music, some swaying, some twitching, some manic, some merely pathetic.

STONEHEARST ASYLUM ain't perfect. There's some irking plot holes, and everyone's motivation is a bit muddled. There's one character who can apparently survive having a half ton of coal dropped on his head... But this is a really top-notch psychological thriller, which doubles as a moving discourse on madness and sanity, and the cruel practices of Victorian medicine. Not for those who like their films light and snappy, cool and easy. But if you like horror, suspense, Gothic, Edgar Allen Poe, or just a good old-fashioned, scary psychological thriller, I can't recommend this movie ENOUGH.
Five utterly mad, completely bonkers, absolutely insane stars.

6605768,5,B00N1JQ1IM,"Dr.. Edward Newgate (Jim Sturgess) visits the Stonehearst Lunatic Asylum. He is attracted to patient Eliza Graves (Kate Beckinsale) who does not like human contact. The opening claims it is based on  Poe story, so you should know the early twist [Early plot spoiler] that the inmates are running the asylum. But it gets more fun.

Newgate constantly finds himself between the proverbial rock and a hard place. The former doctors were cruel and mistreated the inmates who not only overthrew their ""captors"" but have improved considerably. Eliza complained of intimate and humiliating torture by the doctors. Newgate wants to make things right,  but his road is a madhouse.

I liked the view of the asylum from the outside: fog, thunder, lightning, and a wolf howling. Classic 50's horror film. The Poe twist was expected, but there were more twists which made the film well worth viewing.

The film is listed as a thriller, but due to the subject matter, it is a bit funny too. Great actors giving their all for what may be considered an expensive ""B"" movie.

6605790,5,B00N1JQ1IM,"Based very loosely on Edgar Allan Poe's short story, 'The System of Dr Tarr and Professor Fether', Stonehearst Asylum proved to this skeptical viewer its worth as a darkly humorous gem of cinema, replete with twists and turns that will certainly send shivers down the spine of the most seasoned of horror aficionados. Blood and gore need not apply here, however. The atmosphere which set the stage for the psychological mind-twists that occured throughout, along with a supremely proficient cast of actors who were nothing less than mesmerizing in their believability, are the ingredients that qualify this as the consummate gothic horror film - and whilst it deviated considerably from 'Tarr and Fether', was a fitting tribute to the author and his work.

Aside from providing a taste of the finest acting I have viewed in quite some time, the characters, even seemingly minor players, were every single one of them lively and bold. Extremely well scripted it may have been, but this was nothing if not a character driven story. In a nutshell, we are introduced to the mysterious Dr Newgate, who, shortly before Christmas 1899, makes an appearance at Stonehearst Asylum, whereupon it immediately becomes apparent something is amiss with the idiosyncratic doctors and patients alike, and that there is more to this unorthodox alienist who has turned up on their doorstep in search of hands on experience.

Newgate, we learn early on, seems overeager to pry and rather too interested in the stunning Eliza Graves, a seemingly normal patient with a flair for the piano. His curiosity takes him deeper into an abyss of literal and metaphorical nightmares (for if one follows very, very closely the threads of this movie, and knows precisely what to look for, woven into its fabric is a thought provoking commentary on post-modernistic ideologies), and as each new horror unfolds, yet another mystery is presented. Meanwhile, Newgate, with his nonconformist methods, is stirring the status quo at Stonehearst, and the two main plotlines come to a head with the asylum's New Years celebration, an elaborately rendered example of suspense that was the crowning jewel of the entire movie. That tension lasts quite literally until the very last minutes, when, just as it seems we have everything figured out, we learn absolutely nothing is at it first appeared.

If I have not made mention of this, the actors exuded authenticity, while the lush period costumes were to die for. Jim Sturgess (Dr Newgate) in particular was just incredible; he can give you goosebumps with a whisper. And that he did, on too many occasions to count. With a premise so utterly original on all accounts, I cannot lavish enough praise on this movie, which I believe Poe himself would have been proud of.",1416960000,45,2774,5.026086956521739
6605791,4,B00N1JQ1IM,"To summarize - Dr. Newgate, who has recently graduated from Oxford, shows up at Stonehearst very eager to pursue a career as an asylum doctor. The administrator, Dr. Lamb decides to take the young man under his wing. Although he is initially intrigued by Lamb's unconventional treatment methods, Newgate almost immediately notices that something is amiss at this institution. It might have had something to do with psychotic patients being allowed to run around freely all over the place. Who knows? Any inkling he had about getting the hell out of there went out the window upon meeting Eliza, a patient that he becomes completely enamored with. To complicate matters more, Newgate stumbles upon some patients in the basement who claim to be the real employees of the asylum. So the mystery ensues...

This movie has a lot going for it. For one, it has a fascinating storyline that is loosely based on Poe's short story, The System of Doctor Tarr and Professor Fether. It also has an amazing cast, including Ben Kingsley, Kate Beckinsale, and Michael Cane. I especially enjoyed Kingsley's performance as the enigmatic Dr. Lamb, which was nothing short of awesome. The 1900s style asylum setting and the costumes were also pretty cool. I had some mixed feelings about the ending. However, I appreciate how entertaining all the different twists and turns were.

6605818,4,B00N1JQ1IM,"Decent little thriller - with that cast, though, you'd expect a lot more. I liked the moral ambiguity of a lot of the plot...don't want to give away too much, but sometimes you do have to wonder who was sane and who wasn't back among the patients and doctors in Victorian Asylums.",1416355200,,280,4.403846153846154
6605819,3,B00N1JQ1IM,Interesting dark show. Nice mystery/thriller twist at the end of the movie. Great setting at the insane asylum and great costumes and actors. Story lagged at some points. I won't be buying this show....but it was a good rental. Enjoy.,1416268800,,234,4.875

6605821,1,B00N1JQ1IM,"Please take note that the only people giving this movie 5 stars ARE WOMEN!  That's because it ends with some extremely cheesy, nauseating and completely UN-realistic, fantasy, fairy tale, poor execution of some lovey dovey dancing love angle.

All women and there whipped men need to hear is ""I love you!""  FIVE STARS!!!!

It could have been a good movie, should have been a good movie, but it fell way way way short.

This insane person, somehow gains enough sanity after seeing a woman to break away from orderlies, steal the CHEIF DOCTORS possessions, then has the capacity to locate the woman and go to her...(really?  Where did he get the money to travel?  How did he go from being slumped over conked out in a wheel chair to suddenly having a enough capacity to impersonate a doctor?)

But women don't care, as long as there's a love angle....5 STARS!  I was very disappointed obviously and even more obviously annoyed by these reviews.

Women and whipped lover boys....enjoy!",1416182400,5,982,4.791666666666667

6605846,1,B00N1JQ1IM,"There's certainly much promise here:  late, late Victorian era (1899) spookiness, Big Money Production, one more-than-compelling story line going in (a rarity with most Big Money Productions any more), its cast of high-line pros, coulda shoulda woulda.  But...yeah, but...the protagonist, a ""young, idealistic doctor"" taking on his first clinical practice, is such a pussy that I couldn't stand the sight of him halfway in, just a coward thru and thru.  Even Kate Beckinsale couldn't quell my nausea at watching this whiny chickens**t get bullied, insulted, punked, played, with nary a show of balls (hey, even one ball, like he lost the other one in combat or an industrial accident, something man, something, what the hell's wrong with you?)  I say ""might"" because, hey, it's Kate Beckinsale.  Tough call.  Even the wondrous Ms Kate couldn't help me here.  As portrayed, the protagonist is a good bloke, kinda guy I'd like to have doctoring me.  But man, if some dude I'm plausibly convinced (via the story-line) is a lunatic impersonating a psychiatrist, ""commands"" me to give electro-shocks to another guy I'm convinced (via the story-line) is an innocent, being held against his will by Dr Whack Job, there's gonna be a problem and Dr Whack Job's gonna get his nose re-arranged.  Or, hey, one better, get electro-shocked his own self, right out of that bogus lab coat.  But not Pussycat.  He electro-shocks away.  Yeah, there's pain in them doe eyes.  Why, o why, Cruel Fate?  Must I, Savage Reality?  That was it for me.  This limp mess, with its Lame Kitty Cat stage center, had me asking ""Man, what the hell's wrong with you?"" once too often.",1415750400,8,1650,4.945454545454545

6605852,3,B00N1JQ1IM,"""Believe nothing of what you hear and only half of what you see."" Edward Newgate (Sturgess) has just graduated medical school and takes a job at a mental institution. When he gets to know his fellow doctors he isn't sure what to think. Little by little he begins to uncover secrets about the asylum and the more he finds out the stranger things seem. This was a good movie but at the same time it was also disappointing. I liked the idea of this and the twists were perfect and placed at the right time. None of them seemed too far fetched, but that also could have been because the movies was about an insane asylum. With a cast like this however I was expecting something a little bit better. Kate Beckinsale, Jim Sturgess, David Thewlis, Brendan Gleeson, Ben Kingsly and Michael Caine are all big name actors but the movie never rose to their level. This is a movie that is worth watching but it's best to temper your expectations when you see the cast. Overall, a movie that is good and worth seeing but with this cast I feel it could have been better. I can see why it wasn't a big theater release. I give this a disappointing B-.",1415145600,2,1135,4.3584905660377355

6605880,4,B00N1JQ1IM,"An interesting film, which bears little resemblance to the short Poe story, The System of Doctor Tarr and Professor Fether, upon which is it purportedly based, save the underlying story premise. This film has a top-notch cast and the characters were well portrayed, with an especially good performance by Ben Kingsley. The twisting plot keeps you fully engaged up until the end, even though it has the potential to drift into a routine, bleary-eyed, love-lost story at some points.

For me the best part was that, as the characters unfolded, you start to see things in a new light and question who is right, who is wrong and the nature of madness and its treatment, however misguided or well-intentioned.

There were a few irritating aspects, such as the Bulgarian landscape being not totally consistent with Yorkshire, and some fairly clumsy plot hooks that I won't give away but I would guess they were needed to ensure the story flowed on screen, as is often the case.

Overall, a good film that leaves you thinking.",1414800000,6,1019,4.844827586206897

8675588,5,B00N1JQ1IM,"This 112-minute film is based on a short story by Edgar Allan Poe which was only 25 pages long. It has an entirely different plot than the short tale.  See my review of the Poe tale.
According to the film, it is 1899, and the mad-house contains about 200 patients. Virtually all of the patients are from prominent families, including one who is a cousin to the queen. The doctor who is the superintendent is against harsh treatment of patients. He allows the patients to roam freely, as long as they stay in the grounds of the house. He says that the old treatment used in the past - water boarding, cold showers, beatings seclusion, huge doses of opium, and strait jackets - has been discontinued.
A man appears at the mad house identifying himself as a doctor who came to observe the methods used at the house by working at the house. From the start, it is clear that he is interested in a beautiful inmate who claims she is not insane, although she exhibits some acts of a mad person. The visitor soon discovers that matters are not what he is being led to believe.",1521936000,,1068,4.4213197969543145
