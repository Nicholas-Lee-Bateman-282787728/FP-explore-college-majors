8548099,5,B00A8305UE,"Tegami Bachi: Letter Bee makes use of a lot of the elements that make a good anime: Engaging characters, an original plot, comedy, drama, cool action scenes, and of course, crazy hair! I need not expound on the plot, as you already have a decent product description, so I'll spare you of that.

The show is beautifully drawn, with an equally beautiful color palette to go with it and as mentioned, the action scenes, while not as frequent as in other anime, are fun to watch. Tegami Bachi's biggest fault animation-wise, however, are the CGI Gaichuu (gaint armored bugs), which look horribly out of place in their (mostly) 2D animated world. But the writing makes up for it.

This is a shounen series (aimed at teenage boys), so expect some action violence, a little profanity, and the occasional immodestly-dressed girl. Later episodes also have some nudity, but the naughty bits are covered up. There's also at least one Letter Bee Academy short that has a bit of off-color humor. The packaging says TV-PG, which more or less translates to PG-13.

Overall, I enjoyed this anime very much.",1373155200,,1090,4.818181818181818

8548101,5,B00A8305UE,"This DVD series is moving along nicely. Just like the first volume, Sentai has released an excellent-quality set with crisp native resolution, good sound, and good subtitling. I also love the fact that the average release interval for these discs only seems to be approximately 7 weeks. This is a wonderful change from other distributors who keep the wait times deliberately long so they can build up anticipation, or cram their product with pointless filler in order to drag out the story and maximize profits. Kudos to Sentai for keeping it real, and for keeping the volumes grouped according to the Letter Bee/ Reverse storyline.
As with the first set, there are a couple of episodes in this volume that don't occur in the manga, and the sequence of events gets changed around a bit, but that's just the way the anime was made. These discs are streamlined, with only the Letter Bee Academy shorts and clean opening & ending as additions.
Keep `em coming, Sentai. I'm eagerly awaiting the release of the Reverse arc in volume 3 in April!",1362009600,2,1039,4.777777777777778
