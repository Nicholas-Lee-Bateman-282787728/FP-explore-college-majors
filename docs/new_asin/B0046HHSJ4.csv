Even when you start playing dvd still foreign until you click on swedish menu then soundtrack begins in english-!up to that point you have no idea it is an english soundtrack. As I say Daaveedee showed no interest in my complaint etc etc.
Terrible soundtrack and terrible picture. I threw it in the rubbish bin.
I shall not have any future dealings with Daaveedee-not that they seem to care anyway !

The picture is not the best, but it is acceptable. The sound is very good. It is too bad we cant get more of the old miniseries on dvd.",1315526400,,295,3.933333333333333
