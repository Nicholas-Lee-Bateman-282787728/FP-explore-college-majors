1142733,4,7885729478,"Glenn Ford was as good as anyone playing an intense psychotic, which he does here in this above-average western.

 Ford, playing ""Col. Owen Devereaux,"" gets elected to the position of ""judge"" right after his distinguished career in the Civil War. Unfortunately, he has mental problems and this position carries too much weight for an unstable sort such as him to be carrying. His best buddy, ""Capt. Del Stewart"" (William Holden) sees his friend as he is and tries to reason with him and help him out but winds up being alienated, too, by the paranoid judge whose problems escalate as the story goes on.

There's not a tremendous amount of action in here, but it still moves pretty fast and looks really nice on DVD. This is one of the few color films of the 1940s.

Ellen Drew, Ray Collins and Ed Buchnan provide good supporting help in the story. If you like some of the Anthony Mann-James Stewart westerns of the late '40s/early '50s, you should like this one, too.",1237248000,,967,4.637426900584796
1142734,4,7885729478,"This is a taut, well crafted psychological western directed by Henry Levin. The Man From Colorado assembles some of the same cast from Texas. The Man From Colorado was released eight years after Texas & is a better movie. The two films have similarities in plot: William Holden & Glenn Ford are friends from the civil war, they both love the same woman & they end up in conflict with one another. It's there the similarities end; where Texas had a more lighthearted touch, The Man From Colorado is unrelenting & quite serious. The Man From Colorado was released in 1948, just three short years since the end of WWII. Many of the themes examined in this film were affecting the veterans of that brutal war.

Col. Owen Devereaux (Glenn Ford) leads a small detachment of volunteers in Colorado. At the very close of the war (the opening scene of the film) Col. Devereaux has an even smaller band of Confederates trapped. The Rebs raise a white flag but Devereaux orders his cannon to fire killing all except for the Confederate commanding office who escapes without anyone noticing. Capt. Del Stewart (William Holden) is Devereaux's second in command & friend for years. Capt. Stewart finds the white flag, choosing to bury it & not raise any issues. Stewart has suspected for a while that his best friend has been adversely affected by the war but chooses to remain silent & stand beside him. There's also a scene in which Devereaux is writing in his diary questioning his own sanity & his lust for killing.

The conflicts between Devereaux & Stewart are obvious but well done. They escalate throughout the film until the final showdown. Devereaus becomes more & more deranged & less in control of his urges until he sets fire to a town that jeopardizes many innocent people just so he can root out Stewart.

One of the most interesting facets of this film is the appearance of Glenn Ford. There's something about his face & head that's completely different from his normal appearance. I recognize the difference in his hair style but can't figure out what the other subtle differences are, even his eyes seem to set closer together. The Man From Colorado is a very good film, one of Ford's finer efforts in his early career.",1232236800,3,2223,4.709511568123394
1142735,3,7885729478,"The late Glenn Ford who passed away last year, was a very under-rated actor who never got his due as his son Peter will profess.  This psychological Western shows Ford at his best in one of his few villainous roles (the other being""3:10 to Yuma"").  His buddy William Holden is also excellent as his best friend and the one who sees the chink in his armor as he slowly descends into madness though Ellen Drew is totally wasted as Ford's wife. It's competentedly directed by Henry Levin but unfortunately if the writing were better this would've qualified as a classic (maybe Ford or Hawks could've helmed this).  We know that Ford is aware of his psychosis as he writes in his diary and yet he trys to deny it from his best friend and wife--that doesn't make sense at all as far as the writing is concerned. In otherwards, there are holes in the story which leaves Ford, excellent as he is here, to make the character one-note.  Also we know very little of his relationship to his wife (Drew) or why he continues on his vengeful blood-lust.  Anyway do see it for the Ford/Holden combo since it would be the last film the two would do together (Holden before he died, had called Ford and said he would like to do another Western with him again).",1213056000,4,1243,4.458149779735683
1142736,4,7885729478,"Good yarn and film that deals with how war changes those that fight in them.

His personal emotional problems affect those arouhd him.",1195862400,3,489,4.975609756097561
1142737,4,7885729478,"Moody western set in post Civil War Colorado.  Glenn Ford stars as the tightly wound Union colonel who, immediately after the war ends, returns home and is elected judge for his corner of Colorado.  Ford's first official action is to appoint best friend William Holden a federal marshal.

 THE MAN FROM COLORADO begins a little before these happy ceremonies take place, though.  The movie opens with Colonel Ford forming his men into line of battle against a small contingent of whipped confederates.  At least we in the audience, and Ford with his field glasses, know they're whipped - we both see them waving the white flag of surrender.  Even so, Ford orders the cannons to open fire, and the enemy forces are annihilated.  Okay, so Ford ISN'T going to play the hero in this one.  The likelier candidate, Ford's aide Holden, finds the white cloth tied to the end of a bayonet after the `battle', puts two and two together, and promptly buries the evidence before anyone else can see it.  All this happens in the movie's first five minutes, so these aren't spoilers.

 The emotional core of the movie is the Holden/Ford relationship.  Holden's friendship with and loyalty to his old commander, and life long friend, is severely tested by Ford's increasingly erratic, and violence prone, behavior.  The movie's engine can be found in a secondary plot thread.  After mustering out, the enlisted men in Ford's old regiment find their gold claims have been - legally but unethically - taken over by a big mining concern.  The mine owners have grown fat and rich while the men were off fighting, and the owners attempt to use the law, through their newly appointed judge, to hold and retain their ill-gotten pelf.  There's fodder enough in that situation for two western's worth of violent conflict, and the movie delivers plot-wise.

 I liked THE MAN FROM COLORADO, but I don't think it's a classic, and I'm not going to put it into the heavy rotation, Must Rewatch file.  It's probably more than an interesting coincidence that this movie about displaced and cheated Civil War veterans was made and released four short years after the end of World War II.  The movie stops just short of endorsing the violent and illegal acts committed by the mis-used vets.  Plus there's something brave, or courageous, about a movie from that era that'll set up a plot with a scene of a war crime committed by an officer in the US Army, a crime the officer is never brought to justice for committing.  Another of the movie's strength is Holden's character, who moves from wary loyalty to disillusionment and beyond, is well conceived and wholly credible.  The weakest link in this movie is also its boldest creation played by, arguably, the movie's best actor.  Don't get me wrong, Glenn Ford was very good at playing moody, introspective characters, and he IS very convincing playing someone trying to keep a lid on his explosively violent temper.  The problem he is that's ALL he plays.  The movie spends no time showing Ford at ease, so it's up to Holden and Ellen Drew (wasted here as Ford's bride and underdeveloped triangle love interest of Holden) - it's up to these two to tell Ford ""he's changed"" and for us to believe them.  Blah - the movie's in the showing, not the telling.  As interesting as villains can be, they usually aren't when their kettle's on the boil 24/7.  The movie tells us, rather than shows us, that the Ford character went bad and the war done it to him.  As fine an actor as Ford was, he can't escape a tediously imagined character.  Granted, it's a quibble to complain about Ford's character's one-dimensionality, but with so many other pieces in place it's a frustrating disappointment.  Instead of great, THE MAN FROM COLORADO is just very good.",1174953600,5,3763,4.76661514683153
1142738,4,7885729478,"Henry Levin's post-Civil War western, shot in Techincolor, features real-life best friends Glenn Ford and William Holden (both RIP) as former Union officers who find themselves on opposite sides after Owen Devereaux (Ford) becomes town judge, and who begins to abuse his power to punish anyone who opposes him. Del Stewart (Holden) is made town marshal but he sees that his friend is slipping more and more into insanity (which today would be referred to as Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder), brought on by his experiences during the war. Enemy lines are drawn more strongly as Devereaux marries Carolyn (Ellen Drew), with whom Stewart is also in love. As Owen's mind deteriorates and his madness intensifies, the town is thrown into a uproar and his sadistic, murderous tendencies only grow. Of course, there has to be a showdown that only one man can win.

Ford's son has referred to this film as ""an oddball production"", perhaps because it was a rarity of the time, a psychological western. As offbeat of a role this was for Ford (similar to his Don Jose in ""The Loves Of Carmen"" of the same year, he sports the same longer hairstyle, but the gray on his temples here doesn't quite give the distinguished effect that was intended), he portrays a tortured, jealous man quite well, never more evident in the scenes paranoia sets in, thinking that his wife loves Del and not him. Ellen Drew is effective in her role, although I find her much easier to believe as Holden's love interest, but after seeing Ford with Rita Hayworth, the chemistry would be hard to compare. Different but compellingly watchable, and interesting to see these lifelong friends on screen together for the second and last time (they previously costarred in ""Texas"", in 1941), in another worthy addition to the Columbia Classics collection.  With the recent passing of Glenn Ford, this is another film that adds richness and variety to his legacy.",1157846400,16,1918,4.916666666666667

1142740,4,7885729478,"The late forties saw an interesting subgenre of the Western appear-the psychological Western, which emphasized characters' thoughts and emotions as much, if not more, than action.

The Man From Colorado is one such psychological Western, and is a very good film made even better by its two stars, Glenn Ford and William Holden. Ford and Holden play men who soldier together during the Civil War, and come back to a home town struggling with lawlessness. Holden becomes a marshal, but Ford becomes the town judge. Unfortunately, Ford is suffering from what would now be called post-traumatic stress disorder, a condition gaining attention during the time that this film was made due to the prevalence of World War II soldiers who were diagnosed with this condition. Ford, who had been losing his grip on reality toward the end of the war, now loses it fully under the weight of his responsibilities, putting him on a collision course with his former friend Holden.

The Man From Colorado is a very good film with a subject that still resonates today - how does one learn to put wartime experiences in perspective and lead a normal life?",1146700800,19,1135,4.875647668393782

Union soldiers celebrate the victory in April 1865. But something bothers the Colonel: 100 men killed after the war ended. The enemy could have surrendered (if only they knew). Vigilance must be maintained however. There is a celebration in town. The town rulers pick a candidate as judge. The dance in town attracts most soldiers. One soldier decides to desert (he faced punishment for drinking on duty). The Union soldiers kept the enemy away and saved their gold. Devereaux is named judge [he was elected Colonel of the Volunteers]. A Confederate office tries to shoot the Colonel but fails. Is something wrong? A miner was beaten for being on property claimed by the Great Star Mining company. Federal Law overrules Miners Law, the soldiers lost their claim while in the army. Should one man take over other peoples property?

The Judge tells the Marshal about his wedding plans. The Marshal offers unasked-for advice to the Judge. The marriage is followed by news of a robbery of the gold shipment by two men in uniform. Volunteers form a posse to hunt the robbers then ride out to the country. They chase after two men, one falls off his horse and is captured. The Judge chases the other man but fails. There is a harsh penalty for gold robbers (who deprive people of their earnings). Jericho seeks men to join his gang, some do. Some of the miners were fired because of their friends (guilt by association?). They blame the Judge, who becomes disturbed. Later, masked men rob the safe of Ed Carter (retribution?). There are shots but they get away. The mine owners want action, the Marshal promises they will be caught soon. Men are arrested as suspects. Will one talk? Johnny?

The Marshal will hunt for Jericho alone, and tell him about the danger to Johnny. What will Jericho do? He returns with the Marshal but too late! The Judge tells Carolyn what she must do. She refuses. They prepare to hang the other five men, but a covered wagon drives up to rescue them. There is more shooting. A man was seen at Judge Devereauxs house, he tells what happened to Carolyn - she wants to see Dell tonight. Is this a trap? One man is told to leave town and don't come back. Carolyn reads the Judges diary and goes to see Ed Carter with the book.

The Judge returns to find his diary missing! The doctor visits Dell for a medical exam. There is a surprise for the new Marshal. Will Dell go to Denver to see the Territorial Governor? There is a chase through town, Dell escaped. But the bridge is blocked. [No telegraph?] No one will speak to the Judge or Marshal now. What can Carolyn do? She sees the burning buildings in town! That big landowner objects to the Judges decisions, he owns property in town. Jericho fights with the Judge, a wall stops the fight. There is a happy ending for some.

This is an interesting story that mixes various themes to form a drama. Property conflicts were a common source of conflict. The psychological problems are a new complication. Did it make a better story compared to the classic western movies of the 1930s? It shows how a big landowner or manufacturer can select a Judge (who then favors the man who put him in office).

1142949,4,7885729478,"I added The Man from Colorado to my netflix cue after watching the original 3:10 to Yuma. I was not disappointed. Several other reviewers highlight the fact that this Western is a little different than others since it focuses so heavily on the frail mental condition of Glenn Ford's character. As a viewer you are provided a glimpse into the psyche of the ""hero"" at the beginning when he refuses to accept a Confederate white flag of surrender. William Holder does an excellent job as Glenn Ford's friend who recognizes that he is really struggling after the Civil War's end.

I enjoyed the movie, because the plot was interesting to follow. As I discussed with my sons it is hard to really figure out who are the bad guys in this one which makes the storyline all that much easier to believe. Like most Westerns there are still plenty of gun fights, intense dialogue, and drama. The acting is good, and the story moves along at a good pace. The music is a little over the top at times, but usually helps add to the drama.

If you are looking for a little different flavor of Western, then I recommend this film. The combination of Ford and Holden works well, and you will be entertained. The Searchers is the film that comes most to mind in comparison to this one.",1254009600,,1265,4.495652173913044
1142950,4,7885729478,"The Man From Colorado(1948) is one of the first Noir/Adult Westerns of the post-war period. Where the first wave in the late thirties and early forties had a very epic and fun feel, this second wave was alot more psychological, dark and depressing.

This film is in many ways a subtly made anti-war picture that is a clear allegory on the War that had just wrapped up a few years prior to this film. It may be the very first Hollywood film to deal with what we know now as ""Post-Tramautic Stress Disorder"" and it's reflection here is intelligent and disturbing.

In the picture, Glenn Ford plays a Union Cournal who is slowly losing his mind, evidenced in the opening shots as he orders the deaths of an entire platoon of Confederate soldiers who have raised a white flag. The war ends that very day and him and his command return home. Ford and his men are treated to a warm welcome and the town appoints Ford as Judge of the area. William Holden, his best friend and his second in command, acts as Federal Marshall.

However, carpetbaggers have stolen the land and gold mines of many of his returning troop and Ford sides with the men who took the mines, causing many of the men to resort to robbery and violence to regain there rights. Ford becomes tyrannical and the strain becomes too much for both Holden and his newly-wed wife(Ellen Drew) who feel they must stop the madman from his own personal vengeance and mania.

Ford's performance is chilling and very real. His calm demeanor makes his bursts of violence all the more upsetting and creepy. Holden offsets him well as his Best Friend, who knows too well that his friend is long gone.
Drew dosen't have as much to do as she should, but makes the most of her part as the love interest of both men and her compassion for Ford is touching and adds more to his Drama. Edgar Bucchanan is memorable as the town doctor, who along with Holden, suspects the worst of Ford, especially after a confrontation with a Confederate Officer in the streets turns bloody.

This is an intelligent and well written western overall. If there are any faults, it's pace quickens too much towards the conclusion and the plot is wrapped up so simply and unfortunately, conventionally. No one can deny that the finale is very cinematic and certainly symbolic, but the journey there could have used some more insight and padding.

These are minor quibbles however of what is essentially a very fine first class Western.

Extras include several trailers and one for this film. The print quality is decent, but it would have been nice to have some commentary for this overlooked gem.",1243728000,7,2614,4.620689655172414
