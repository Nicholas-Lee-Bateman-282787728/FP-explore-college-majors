8036789,5,B00061UHY2,"Faerie Tale Theatre freaked me out as a kid, but I loved it. Along with Zoobilee Zoo and all the other weird late 80s early 90s shows/televised plays. Just a handful of these stick out in my mind, this being number 1. Good stuff.",1383868800,,229,4.2272727272727275

Faerie Tale Theatre's adaptation of ""Pinocchio"" is simply average.  The best component of it is Carl Reiner's expert portrayal of the woodcarver Gepetto, as Mr. Reiner adopts an Italian accent, and believably plays a concerned father to the title puppet.  Pinocchio is played much less successfully by Paul Reubens.

The main issue I have with Reubens' performance is that he is playing Pee Wee Herman as Pinocchio instead of doing a separate characterization for Pinocchio.  To be fair, Pee Wee Herman as a character was at the height of its popularity and I don't know if the decision to incorporate his mannerisms into Pinocchio was entirely up to Reubens alone.  Regardless, it was a bad decision because it pulls the viewer out of a character in Pinocchio they need to believe in for the character to be effective.

Also starring James Coburn and James Belushi, Faerie Tale Theatre's ""Pinocchio"" struggles just to be average.  That is a shame, because with such a cast it had great potential to be much more.",1270339200,,1030,4.913294797687861
8036792,5,B00061UHY2,"I always liked this Fairy Tale Theater production the best! Paul Reubens is PERFECT as Pinocchio and with a supporting cast of folks including the likes of James Coburn and Carl Reiner, it can't be beat!

It comes from a time when cable was fun and not full of itself. Get this and be reminded of that time and have FUN!!",1215043200,,321,4.262295081967213
8036793,5,B00061UHY2,"This adaptation is marvelous because of the cast.  Each character is funnier than the next.  Adults will love it.  Great fun for the kids to watch and enjoy. I'd say, we liked this one the best. All of this series is a 'must see'.",1204934400,,230,4.181818181818182
8036794,5,B00061UHY2,"I remember my mom renting these video's from the public library when I was a kid.  I found an old Shelly Duval tape in my basement and had to go research more.  I was so excited when I found the Faerie Tale Theatre.  When I watched them, I was suprised to see how many famous actors have participated in the videos.  I have already purchased most of the videos on DVD and plan to collect the whole set!",1142726400,,402,4.115384615384615
8036795,4,B00061UHY2,"This version of PINOCCHIO from FAERIE TALE THEATRE is a wonderful adaptation of Carlo Collodi's timeless classic, about a wooden puppet who is brought to life thanks to a lonely man's desire to become a father.

Paul Reubens (aka Pee-Wee Herman) plays the title role with Carl Reiner as Geppetto, Pinocchio's loving father.  Lainie Kazan is a sassy delight as Sophia, the Blue Fairy who grants the gift of life to Pinocchio, and James Coburn is fantastic as the evil Gypsy.  Also in the cast are James Belushi and Michael Richards.

One of the best!",1099958400,,549,4.747368421052632
