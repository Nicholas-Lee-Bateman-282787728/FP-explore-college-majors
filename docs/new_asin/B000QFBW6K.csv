2837948,4,B000QFBW6K,"This was one of the best acted and sung Ring's I've seen and heard. Tomlinson as Wotan is fantastic. Anne Evans as Brunnhilde carried things vocally and was an attractive stage presence. For a person who grew up on Hildegard Behrens' belching for The Met it's great to listen to a pleasing Brunnhilde. Siegfried Jerusalem as Siegfried was a pleasant surprise. I didn't like him much in The Met's production, but the Bayreuth air must agree with him. He nails his performances, both visually and vocally. Phillip Kang is decent as Hagen but needs more lung to match the likes of Matti Salminen. Then again, who's better than Salminen? The production is predictably schlocky in that familiar Euro-trash way, but at least the vision is consistent throughout the four operas. Too many modern productions simply don't cohere through the 15 hours, so desperate are directors/producers to rub our faces in their anarchic vision. For me, the stripped down staging in sections like the 3rd Act of Siegfried helped focus viewers attention on the fine acting, so it was no great loss that I didn't see a full blown flaming Brunnhilde's rock. I thought the Rhein maiden scene at the start of the cycle was great. They actually looked like they were swimming in the green light. Stage designers should take greater advantage of modern light projection techniques, including holograms, to build more compelling Rings. How many times has Fafner the dragon looked ridiculous on stage, a problem that's bedeviled production since the first performance when Wagner was alive? The text keeps assuring us that Fafner is the most terrifying vision on earth and then we get flailing paper mache claws and a cartoon head. We the viewers should be scared of Fafner, making Siegfried's bravery more impressive. Modern lighting could project a frightening, almost 3-D Fafner, if they'd just give up on the creaky contraptions. Same thing with Grane, Brunnhilde's horse, an animal that's repeatedly referenced but never seen believably. Project a shimmering version of Grane with modern lighting and forget about hobby horses and other cutesy stuff. Overall, I thought this production the most satisfying I'd seen on video.",1273881600,3,2196,5.102777777777778
2837949,3,B000QFBW6K,"Let's face it.  If you're going to spend 15+ hours planted in front of your television set watching Wagner's epic Ring cycle you're going to want some visual pleasures to rest your eyes upon.  You won't find them in Harry Kupfer's production.
This is a most soul crushingly, ugly, depressing and often vapid production as only Harry Kupfer could dream up.

Here you will find his trademarks on full display.  Gods in raincoats, lucite suitcases, malfunctioning lasers, cement time tunnels, low life heroes and heroines and, generally, a depressive Communist Germany viewpoint of the world at large.
At least we are spared his other best known trademark, tv sets scattered all over the floor, though he gives us a sea of antennas in the Norn scene.

He presents us with a world devoid of beauty, nobility and redemption.  Yes, redemption.  Kupfer's vision of Brnnhilde's Immolation does not give humanity a ray of hope, just a repeat of more of the same, rather like the famous nightmare film 'Dead of Night'.  Humanity is doomed to reiterate the same debcles over and over ad infinitum.  I don't think this is what Wagner had in mind. But that isn't important.  What matters is that the granddaddy of regietheater has splashed his nihilistic vision, once again, all over the screen for our supposed edification and has spawned and encouraged the army of wunderkind regietheatremaniacs who seem determined to destroy all that is good and great in their quest to make their mark on opera production history textbooks.  They are self-ordained educators to the idiot masses and if you don't like what they are doing you are labeled a reactionary philistine.

Thanks, Harry.  The spirit of Ruth Berghaus is now extinct.

I don't mind being edified if the professor is truly interested in the advancement of my soul but not when he is more-or-less spitting in my face, which is what I feel has happened when I watch these operas from Bayreuth.  And it's getting worse on the Green Hill, note the new 'M'singer' and 'Tristan' and, too a lesser degree Herheim's 'Parsifal' which the trendies so adored when it premiered in 2008.

I like modern interpretations of Wagner, in fact, I prefer them over things like the Schenk/Levine production from the Met.
But the only filmed version of the Ring in modern dress that I have found continuous and repeated pleasure in is the Pierre Audi/Harmut Haenchen cycle from Amsterdam.  It's marvellous and way off the map in terms of inventiveness and imagination.

This diss of Kupfer is all the more saddening because Barenboim is an excellent Wagnerian who excels at the late masterpieces, like the Ring, Tristan and Parsifal.  And he has at his command the magnificent Bayreuth Orchestra and even more astounding Bayreuth chorus.  Is there a better chorus on earth in this repertory? No, not the hammy ragtag wobblers and bleaters at The Met, sorry.

His soloists are, generally, excellent, a few misfires notwithstanding.  None of these singers are what I consider to be the 'best' in their roles, with the exception of Birgitta Svendn's marvellous Erda, but they are all top drawer and memorable.

John Tomlinson was, in the early days, the finest Hunding/Hagen I'd seen in the opera house, then he moved into Wotan/Hans Sachs territory and was less successful, though still formidable and not to be dismissed out of hand.
His voice is very dark and gravelly, but highly expressive.  Where he meets his limits is at the top of the range, notably the second scene of Rheingold and the end of Walkre.  He is stretched almost to cracking point, but he gets through because he knows his own instrument so well and commands complete control of his resources.  He never disappoints, so is a major plus in this film.  Gnter von Kannen's Alberich is also very compelling.  He's a little wobbly but his is a powerful, menacing performance, and he's a great actor, like Tomlinson.

I like Nadine Secunde and Poul Elming as the twins, Sieglinde and Siegmund.  I suppose they can be likened to French resistance fighters, given their battle-gear and head scarves etc.  Within this context these two excellent performers create a vivid frisson of thwarted passion and tragedy.  And they are both very good looking people into the bargain, which is always an advantage in filmed opera.  Certainly they are far more plausible than were Gary Lakes and Jessye Norman for Levine's cycle.  Matthias Hlle is an unusually handsome and suave Hunding, which I think is preferable to his being some hairy, filthy operatic Fred Flintstone.  He's almost as seductive sounding as the late, great Gottlob Frick in this part.

Anne Evans is a lovely Brnnhilde with a beautiful voice, but it's one size too small for Brnnhilde.  Fortunately she marshalls her resources and doesn't do any damage to her vocal chords, and she is a decent actress. But I prefer Gwyneth Jones' wild, balls to the wall performance for Boulez.

Siegfried Jerusalem is on better form for Barenboim than he was for Levine.  And he looks very sexy, all sweaty with messy hair.  He's far too neat and clean in Otto Schenk's production.

Graham Clark's Loge and 'Siegfried' Mime are famous and need no recommending.  But don't miss him as Mime The Fly in the Audi production of 'Siegfried', it is unforgettable!  Waltraud Meier is her usual high octane self as Waltraute in Gtterdmmerung.  The voice was, and always has been, slightly vinegary.  But as this isn't Isolde or Sieglinde the strained top notes are not in evidence and she turns in one of the better Waltrautes on record and film.  And she is SO beautiful and such a great actress.

The minor gods, Freia, Froh and Donner are rather outstanding as far as these three small parts go.  Eva Johansson is one of the few non-screamers who've performed Freia, though she's a bit bug-eyed she's quite lovely.  And Kurt Schreibmayer seems the perfect embodiment of an Adonis-like Froh, and he sings very well indeed.  Bodo Brinkmann is less attractive, both vocally and physically, but his brutal voice suits Donner and he acts very well as Gunther.  Eva-Maria Bundschuh made a career of performing Gutrune and this is her best outing in the part.

The rest of Barenboim's cast is adequate, though why Uta Priew, a low mezzo, was assigned the part of the Third Norn, a dramatic soprano role, is utterly baffling.  Surely one of the other Valkyrie singers, like Eva Johansson or Ruth Floeren would have been more vocally comfortable and effective in this part.  Philip Kang is a bit of a washout as Fafner and Hagen, his voice being too soft grained and inexpressive.  This is too bad because his lack of vocal charisma has a muting effect on 'Gtterdmmerung'.

The Rhine Maidens get lost in the flickering laser lights in Rheingold so one hardly notices how they're singing.  Jane Turner is especially good as Flohilde.  They are better tuned in 'Gtterdmmerung' however as they don't have any of Kupfer's technical debcles to contend with.

So, buy it?  No.  Get the audio recordings if you can still find them.  I expect Amazon can scrounge up the original Teldec sets, they are worth looking for.  But the Kupfer production was not worth preserving on film.  If it's a modern version of these operas you seek get the Audi/Haenchen set, I can't say it enough times.  With Audi the spirit of true imaginative insight married to visual beauty possessed by the late, great Ruth Berghaus lives again.",1258588800,18,7426,4.866135458167331
2837950,4,B000QFBW6K,The costume's and sets are a little disapointing at times but I think this Ring has one of the best cast's I have ever seen or heard.,1252368000,,133,3.962962962962963
2837951,4,B000QFBW6K,"This is IMHO the best sounding Ring since Solti.  Barenboim's conducting is wonderfully engaging throughout and the cast, especially Tomlinson as Wotan, equals or bests any other.

One big warning:  the Wagner haters who seem to be in charge of all things Wagner, including Bayreuth, other than the actual poems and music, have here taken one small step further in their campaign to de-Wagnerize Wagner.  The English subtitles do not always honestly portray Wagner's poem as being sung by the characters.  Sometimes this is just to fit in some cheesy, unfunny double-entendre. But elsewhere they actually interfere with the plot and time-line of Wagner's drama.  So be warned.

Kupfer's production is typical Euro-silliness that for the most part doesn't get too much in the way of the music.  But the video director- one Horant H. Hohlfeld- seems to take delight in distracting us at some of the most sublime moments to cut to a close-up of some Kupfer silliness or other.  For example, in Act I of Siegfried just when Tomlinson reaches the climax of the gorgeous ""Auf wolkigen Hoehn wohnen die Goetter"" we cut to a close-up of Mime mouthing the word ""Wotan"".  Wagner makes it clear a few minutes later that Mime has identified the ""Wanderer"" so we really don't need all this childishly over-clever clutter.

And Kupfer often has the characters behave in a way that is the direct opposite of the way Wagner is portraying them musically.  For example, in Rheingold the gods are being portrayed musically as noble and dignified while Kupfer has them ineffectually running back and forth on the stage with no motive either in the Wagner-drama or the Kupfer-drama.  This kind of thing forces the singers to make some choices vocally and interpretively that they would not otherwise, and explains some of the oddities if you've listened to the CD set or the DVD one without watching (not a bad choice).

To show what this is bringing us to, when at the end of the tetrology (or trilogy-plus, if you like) Kupfer does some little schtick with a little boy escorting a little girl across the stage and off I found myself thinking, ""That's kind of touching.""  The thing is, Wagner's original was more than a little ""touching"".

Still, this is the DVD set to get.  The music is superior and all the other productions are even worse- including the Met's, which by at first appearing to follow Wagner's intentions and then failing to do so becomes a fraud as well as a travesty.",1241654400,7,2468,4.81042654028436
2837952,5,B000QFBW6K,"I have seen over 24 live productions of ""Der Ring"" and this is certainly one that stands out over several lesser attempts to put the 15 plus hours of music on the stage.  However, as in every Ring, there are always several aspects that fail.  This is no exception !  Before purchasing this particular version, I would hold off for several months and hope that a BluRay production worthy of Wagner (and not the ONLY ""Walkuere"" currently available) in all aspects will be realized.  However, IF you must have a Ring this week, I do recommend this above the rest of the trash currently available and, for the most part, being offered on the stages of the world's opera houses.",1239667200,3,673,4.583333333333333
2837953,5,B000QFBW6K,"Sorry for such a long review, but Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen is bigger than life.

Das Rheingold

Don't let the Rheinmaidens' 1980s punk-rock look put you off. Their costume style works well with the yellow-green laser lights that set the stage for the Rhein scenes. To handle the difficult staging of Wotan's and Loge's travel to and from Nibelheim, there are endless industrial-stlye stairways. Likewise, in the closing scene of Rheingold, where Wotan and the other gods enter Valhalla, instead of a rainbow bridge, they use a well-lighted, pyramidal elevator.

So with all these unconventional staging surprises, why is this such a great DVD set? The widescreen format and surround sound help us focus on the great singing and acting in this performance.

John Tomlinson is a convincing, energetic Wotan. Alberich is sung (and acted!) at his very best by Gunter von Kannen. Fasolt and Fafner are, as you would expect them, bigger than life. Eva Johansson is a younger than the usual, and very appealing Freia.

Perhaps conductor Daniel Barenboim and director Harry Kupfer chose such a ""modernistic"" way of staging the opera in order to direct our attention to the exceptional singing and acting of the cast, which I should add is matched by the superb quality of the sound that Barenboim gets from the Bayreuth Festspiele Orchestra.

If I could have only one DVD set of Rheingold, this would be my choice.

Die Walkure

Paul Elming and Nadine Secunde are the best Siegfried/Sieglinde couple I have seen.  They bring youth, vitality and joy to their discovery of love scene that Ring viewers have come to love.  At the same time, Barenboim's exquisite control of the orchestra's intensity allows us to hear Wagner's leitmotifs--signature tunes--one after another, in a dazzling way that adds another dimension to the scene on stage.

Just when you think that the highlight of this Walkure will be Siegmund/Sieglinde, along come John Tomlinson and Anne Evans with a Wotan/Brunnhilde that is electrifying.  Near the end of Die Walkure, along with the touching love between Wotan and his daughter, who disobeyed him in order to try to please him, we are treated to perhaps the best-ever introduction of the Siegfried/Redemption theme that we will hear later in Gotterdammerung.

The laser light show used by director Harry Kupfer seems especially effective, augmented by lots of clouds of smoke for the closing scene featuring the Magic Fire music.

You should find this a very memorable Die Walkure, both for the unique stage effects and the superb singing and acting.

Siegfried

If you are familiar with Richard Wagner, then you probably know of the leitmotifs, or signature tunes for which he is well-known. This technique is showcased here, as Barenboim helps the themes come through during the conversation between Mime and the Wanderer, as Wotan describes all the things that he has encountered in the world.

The acting adds immensely to the power of this performance, as is illustrated by the way the Wanderer casually notices the broken pieces of Notung, Siegmund's sword, during his conversation with the evil dwarf. What could top fine acting, singing, and a conductor who makes sure we hear the leitmotifs?: Siegfried's sword forging. Siegfried Jerusalem excels in this supremely challenging role. It's difficulty lies in requiring a combination of singing and acting ability, AND ability as a percussionist. Siegfried's hammer has to tap out the hammer blows in synchronization with the orchestra--not an easy thing to do while you're concentrating on your singing and convincingness as an actor.

Graham Clark joins the ranks of the most brilliant portrayals of Mime. A hero is amplified when the villain is convincing. Graham Clark is one of the most wily and agile Mimes.

Want more reasons why this is such a great Siegfried?: Anne Evans whose Brunnhilde joins Siegfried to really heat up the stage in the Magic Fire music. Really--no one has sung ""Sei Mein!"" (Be Mine!) so passionately, and with all the leitmotifs swirling around you will be dizzied by the heat of their love.

Gotterdammerung

Most productions of Gotterdammerung tend to drag until the exciting finale where Brunnhilde returns the Ring to the Rhein.  Because of Barenboim's diligence in ensuring that all the leitmotif ""signature tunes"" come through, this Gotterdammerung is less susceptible to the dragging periods.  Siegfried's and Gunther's swearing Blutbrudershaft is punctuated by leitmotifs recalling Alberich's curse and the doom that clouds this brotherhood.  It is a reverse image of Wotan and Loge as they bargain with Alberich, way back in Das Rheingold.  Barenboim sees that Wagner's leitmotif reminds us of that.

Just as Siegfried Jerusalem seemed born for the role of Siegfried (at least namesake wise), so Waltraud Meier makes an exceptional Waltraute.  Her admonitions to Brunnhilde remind us of why Gotterdammmerung is taking place:  the gold must be returned to the Rhein.

Gotterdammerung is only as powerful as its Brunnhilde.  Anne Evans delivers that power, maintaining a stage presence and seizing Hagen's spear, even breaking it in two.

Perhaps it's Wagner's reminder to take a look at mankind's history of destruction, but in the bonus section, Daniel Barenboim explains how the final scene was filmed before the terrorist attack in New York on September 11th.  Much as the world watched this horrible destruction on their tv sets, Gotterdammerung ends with ""the cocktail set"" watching the action on tv sets on stage.  Wagner seems to have wanted us to watch and reflect on what we had just witnessed.",1231632000,21,5621,5.141758241758242
2837954,3,B000QFBW6K,"This is a story . . . a 15 hour story, and most of the story is told in a melody that is neither flattering to the modern ear nor interesting, in my opinion. And it is probably a production more suited to an advanced listener/viewer of the cycle.

However, considering the story Wagner is telling, his means and method, it could be appreciated by someone that is not an advance opera aficionado of the cycle. During the long 15 hours required to watch the complete work, it would help to know something about the composition before hand just as it is helpful to have read the plays of Shakespeare before watching them. Here is a link to English translations of the script [...]

Der Ring des Nibelungen (The Ring of the Nibelung) is a cycle of four epic music dramas by Richard Wagner which are loosely based on characters from Norse sagas and The Nibelungenlied (The Song of the Nibelungs) an epic poem in Middle High German, a story of a dragon-slayer Siegfried.

Taking twenty-six years to write, the four operas are Das Rheingold (The Rhinegold), Die Walkre (The Valkyrie), Siegfried, Gtterdmmerung (Twilight of the Gods), and although individual operas are works in their own right, full understanding of the story of the Ring cycle requires viewing or attending all four operas which in total lasts for 15 hours with the first and shortest lasting two and a  half hours, while the final, Gtterdmmerung, can take up to six and a half hours depending on the conductors pace. Wagner wrote for an orchestra of gargantuan proportions, and eventually had a purpose-built theater (the Bayreuth Festspeilhaus) constructed in which to perform this work.

The cycle is the story of an epic struggle of gods, heroes, and several mythical creatures, over a magic Ring that grants domination over the entire world (sound familiar?). For specifics on the cycle such as list of characters, story line and instrumentation I would suggest this link . . . [...]

Repeating tonal patterns and melodies are used consistently in this work and the music reflects the mood of the scene being acted out on stage. The repeating themes become richer and more defined as the cycle progresses. It is these themes at their richest and most well defined that I find as the most melodic and sublime I have heard. On the other hand, the shear length of the work, and Wagner's style of composing the music to reflect the scene creates long internals during the stage action that the music is very dissonant. This particular production is rather abstract and unconventional in the stage props and costuming. A seasoned cycle fan might find this exciting. But this leaves the less seasoned cycle fan little clue to the meaning of the action on stage so for a full understanding one must understand the German that is spoken or more accurately sung, or alternatively have a translation of the script. Fortunately, I have found complete translations into English of the cycle for you at [...]

Finally, there are many highlight recordings of the cycle which focus on the most melodic of the composition if pleasant listening is one motivation for listening to the cycle. It requires a great deal of endurance to watch the complete cycle and probably a good deal of study about the underlying plot of the drama to have an appreciating for the full 15 hours of this work.

2837955,5,B000QFBW6K,"John deWald has given an excellent review, but I think a couple of additions could be made. I would suggest you read this in conjunction with his review.

By the time he had reached the Ring, Wagner had passed the bounds of opera. The Ring is more correctly described as music-drama, for in this work (and Parsifal) the dramatic element is as important as the musical element, an aspect that is hard to recognize from CDs. After years of listening to the work on CD, I finally saw this work via this performance (I was lucky enough to see it on a 100"" screen and hear it through an excellent surround system; all of which helps give an impression of ""you are there""). And it was at that point I realized I was experiencing something greater than what we normally class as opera.

Although this production had four different directors, they revealed a similar conception in understanding the work. And the performers and conductor tied it all together so that you are not really aware different directors were involved.

The presentation is abstract, and once you become aware of the nature of the work, you realize that is the only legitimate treatment for it. I have seen advice that for your first DVD Ring, the Met production might be easier as it is a more traditional staging. This statement suggests the director was apparently trying to treat the Ring as a traditional opera and did not properly understand what he was directing. Let me add, I normally dislike abstract settings, but in this case it is the only option and really works.

This production is justifiably famous. It has a cast of outstanding singers, with no weak link (and Wagner is very demanding on his cast). But they are all outstanding actors as well - essential for a production true to Wagner's intentions. The acting has strong focus on the emotional interactions between the cast and this is where DVD makes all the difference. Add a conductor like Barenboim who shows complete understanding and mastery of the work and there is little more you could ask for.

And that little more is the technical side of things. Apart from outstanding lighting, camera work and video direction, there is no sign of the age of this performance. It dates from 1991-2, but the 16:9 image is crystal clear with perfect color, and the 5.1 DTS sound is of demonstration quality. Balance between orchestra and singers is perfect as well. The impact of this production was of an intensity I have never experienced in a long life of exposure to music. I could only cope with one part a week.

In summary, if you want to understand and gain the full experience The Ring can provide, and in a virtually perfect performance, this set is the perfect choice.",1220918400,38,2711,4.684873949579832
2837956,5,B000QFBW6K,"Creating a filmed version of a work that was intended to be experienced in the theatre is never an easy task, and even the best recordings often disappoint on at least some (even if nonessential) levels.  This recording of the 1991 and 1992 Kupfer and Barenboim Ring Cycle is, without a doubt, among the best recorded versions of an opera I have ever seen, and one of the undisputed highlights of my dvd collection.  Whether because of the wonderful cast, superb orchestra and conducting, or (largely, if not always) enlightening design and direction, this production simply works.  Despite being rather a traditionalist myself, I found the design of this production to be mostly remarkable, visually arresting and intellectually stimulating more often than not.  The costumes and staging have a distinctly modern, largely minimalist feel, yet they nevertheless manage by and large to do justice to the sense of timelessness that keeps Wagner's masterpiece relevant almost 150 years after it was first performed.  There is enough of tradition here to retain the sense of historicity that should be a fundamental part of any good Ring Cycle, respecting its foundation in ancient myth as well as looking simultaneously to the future.  Having said that, there are moments when the production looks to the future in ways that I don't find particularly enlightening.  The whole post-nuclear destruction premise jars in my opinion with what the focus of the Ring ought to be, and the interjection in the final minute of what is purely the director's fancy is in my view completely wrongheaded and distracting.  Nevertheless, new productions wouldn't be worth seeing if they all attempted to merely copy the romantic traditionalism of, say, Otto Schenk's Ring for the Met (which is, as far as traditional productions go, as good as they come.  In that vein, the production is just about perfect, featuring scene after scene of picture-perfect romantic imagery the way the Ring was meant to be performed.  However, I tend to tip my hat to the Kupfer production, as it is, I think, more dynamic and exciting overall.  But both are excellent), and to the most part, Kupfer strikes new ground in ways that are interesting.  And of course, while qualities of a production are important to note in order to differentiate it from others (and on the whole, I do think this one of the best, and certainly my favorite of the 'modern' Rings), any version of the Ring must stand or fall by the virtue of its cast, conductor, and orchestra; and the music itself is marvelous.  I personally love John Tomlinson's Wotan, and he is beyond a doubt among the recording's greatest virtues.  It should be noted that his voice is not one that everyone loves equally in the role; for sheer beauty and elegance of phrasing, one would do better to seek out James Morris in the Met's recording.  However, I cannot imagine anyone portraying Wotan more powerfully on the stage, imbuing him with a stronger sense of the admixture of pride, power, and ultimate world-weariness that exemplifies the character, and I would recommend anyone interested in the Ring at least witness his wonderful performance.  The rest of the cast is of a similarly high quality, with other highlights including Siegfried Jerusalem's excellent Siegfried and Anne Evans's brilliant and heartrendingly poignant Brunnhilde.  The interplay between Tomlinson and Evans is especially striking; one really had the sense of two operatic giants on the stage--theatric spectacle at its best, and alongside Barenboim's lush orchestration, its most profound.  This is, overall, one of the most dynamic Rings, well-acted and quite often thoroughly riveting--which is, ultimately, one of the main reasons I would choose it as probably my favorite despite quirks in the production.
In summary, a masterful production of one of opera's most difficult works to conceptualize and stage well.  Ideally, one would want to own this as well as the Schenk production to pair the best of the traditional with the best of the new; however, for a single recording, one can't do wrong with this one.  Highly recommended indeed.",1198972800,70,4143,5.064705882352941
2837957,2,B000QFBW6K,"By way of background, I have been listening to the Ring for almost 50 years.  I have multiple sets on CD and vinyl, and excerpts from others. I have other Rings on Blu-ray or DVD. I own the scores and use them when I listen to the CD's. I have no objection at all to updating sets or costumes as long as it makes sense and doesn't hurt the drama.  Unfortunately, that was not the case here.

I had a bad feeling when the gods showed up in Rheingold looking as if they were headed to a St Patrick's day party.  When they took a glass elevator to Valhalla, I knew I was in big trouble.  The Valkyries apparently needed black rain slickers, Plexiglas helmets (looked like the top of a bubble gum machine) and shields (resembled the tops from a set of Calaphon cookware) to ward off the mummies/zombies/dead heroes (?) waiting for them, when they landed after their ride (actually, their walk down a stairway).  Siegmund showed up at Hunding's house in camouflage fatigues.  Gunther's vassals had apparently just come from their jobs at the local oil refinery.  The ""acting"" often consisted of aimless walking about and flopping down on the stage for no apparent purpose.  My reaction throughout the performances was laughter.  It was so over the top silly. Almost as if they were spoofing the Ring.

 The immolation scene was ruined by the director by having Hagen continuously and closely follow Brunnhilde around the stage (almost like a puppy)  making stupid gestures to demonstrate how he really wants to get the ring, as if we didn't know that. It was extremely distracting.  Then as Valhalla is burning, and the Rhine is overflowing,  we have a bizarre ending: a bunch of people walk on stage with TV's they are watching.  Two children then walk off hand in hand.  Apparently this is the director's idea of a clever way to illustrate the redemption through love theme which ends the opera. How banal.  The conclusion of the Ring really doesn't need any gimmicks.  These are just a few of the many many problems.

  If the horrible direction and costuming wasn't enough,  there are significant audio problems.  Perhaps owing to the enormous size of the stage, the PCM stereo (I don't have surround) is highly variable as to the singers.  There are dead zones on the stage where the singing sounds like it is coming from an echo chamber at a low volume.  Then the singer moves forward and the sound is louder and of much better quality.  Very distracting.  As others have documented there is a problem with the audio from Siegfried Act 3.  It is about twice as loud as the rest of the recording.  If you are dozing it will really get you up!

  It is a shame the director thought his vision of the cycle was better than the composer's because the singing was excellent, probably 4-5 stars.  I might turn off the picture and just listen to it, were it not for the audio issue.  I'd much rather listen to the Solti CD's.

  Fortunately for me, there was a technical problem with one of the discs, which freezes up during part of Act 2 of Siegfried.  I am returning the set to Amazon.  There is a good reason this set is priced so low.  It is truly awful.",1427155200,27,3153,4.529307282415631

However, this is not possible when I play them on my Macintosh computer using either one of the applications Aurora Bluray Player or Mac Bluray Player. Likewise, on the TV set I can make the disc go backward and forward at different speeds, but this is not possible on the computer. Besides, the bluray video image is not quite what we currently call ""HD"", for rapidly moving bodies do not display sharp contours. Another problem with computer viewing is that the image occasionally pixelates. This happens with all four discs, in scenes displaying sudden flashes of light, such as the beginning of Act III of ""Die Walkre""; therefore I do not think that it is merely feature of a particular piece of supporting material, which I happen to own.

While most reviews indicated a preference for either DTS or DD, I  surprisingly preferred LPCM as the other two attentuated the sound to an excessive and rather artificial degree, particularly the vocals, rendering it rather sterile sounding.

Wagner created his own version of the myths and legends of the Tuetonic/Norse people, and this Ring portrays those story lines beautifully. Sung in German with multiple subtitle options, the vocal work is glorious, especially Sieglinde, mother of Siegfried, and the ""bratliche Schwester"" (bride-like sister) of Siegmund, who also impresses in this heroic role. Wotan (Odin) in this production is the glue that holds all together, and is spectacularly sung and acted. At the end of the day, it is Wagner who is the winner here, and I've never heard a better Ring cycle.

2837971,3,B000QFBW6K,"This is going to be a difficult review and I invite comments. I am relatively new to opera---there's your opening, come and get me! I have built a collection of opera on DVD and regularly view them. I listen to opera on my mp3 player daily. I took a course and read a few books. For fun, I read libretti. That's me.

I have found that I enjoy a wide range of opera from the early works through to modern opera such as Billy Budd, Nixon in China and the Dialogues of the Carmelites. My preference is to see opera performed the way it was written with the stage notes carried out as intended. I do not like ""period adjusted"" performances. In my opinion, that is perversion of the original works.

At first glance, after watching the entire 1980s Met Ring Cycle, I found the sets and costumes appalling in this version. The Rhine scene is tolerable but the first appearance of the gods reminded me of the first episode of Gilligan's Island. Those corny clear suitcases and goofy costumes really do not convey ""gods"" in any stretch of the imagination. Wotan, blind in one eye supposedly, looks like his sunglasses broke in the shipwreck. Well, Das Rheingold is certainly a three hour tour...

By this point, the critic in me came out and I wanted to hate this production. But Wagner is so good, the music so excellent, the themes so powerful that if the music is right, it almost cannot be screwed up. I forced myself to accept this awful costuming and go with the music. The music matters and this music, though at times not well recorded, is certainly superior to the Met's production from the 80's. The voices are stronger.

If you are new to opera and want to venture through a Ring Cycle, go with the Met's 80's production. It's a very traditional delivery.

If you have some experience and spare change, add this to your collection. It will grow on you. It did me. Still, I just can't give 5 stars to this production because I feel too much liberty was taken with the settings and costuming. The character interpretations are very interesting and I think these characters have more depth than the Met's but those damn silly costumes are distracting.

Get this for the sharp, pounding conducting as well. It will thrill you no end. The subtitles also make things plainer than others do. The Levine set is comparable, with Norman and Behrens. But this is more dramatic, powerful, higher in vibartion. These singers believe in what they are singing, and how they sing out, with a kind of primitve sensuality not often heard in Wagner. Most singers tend to yell their heads off in lieu of a voice. Not here. Straight down the vocal line, especially Tomlinson and the exceptional Anne Evans..incredible high notes, seering expressions, dark lighting highlighting crisis after crisis. The Wotan of Tomlinson is gruff and gravely, but on target always with respect to notes and directions in the score. His is a brutal Wotan, hateful and yet crushed by Brunhilde's deception, as he interprets it in his chaotic world. He's in the groove at all times. Great! Evans lunges at him like a lover, imploring, beseeching in ravishing tones, and she is loud, not ever shaving off the tops of those trecherous high notes that come in batallions in this cycle for everyone in fact.
The rest of the cast in this endless cycle are excellent. The Fricka especially, and the confrontation with Wotan is violent and loud and moving all at once. And that music!!

There is a tiny improvement in the video resolution that is insignificant, at least on the upconverting Oppo bdp-93. I could hear no difference in the audio, at least not in the stereo track. I have a very revealing high-end stereo setup. There was also no difference in the audio when heard through a Benchmark DAC1 PRE and Sennheiser 600's.

The initial Kultur DVD issue had a defect in the stereo track of most of act III of Siegfried, which Kultur later corrected. The Siegfried blu-ray seems to have a different kind of problem in the act III stereo track. The Siegfried blu-ray stereo audio track in acts I and II is significantly lower level than the other operas. In act III the volume goes suddenly up so much that you cannot go on listening with the same volume as in acts II and I; you have to turn the volume down significantly. In other words, acts II and I are too quiet and act III too loud. In addition the act III stereo track sounds different even after correcting levels. There is more reverb, the sound is much more forward and the overall timbre is different and more aggressive and unpleasant than acts II and I. It's clear that the act III stereo track is from a different source than the other two acts and is of a lower quality. When I compared the Siegfried blu-ray stereo audio track with the Siegfried DVD, the replacement DVD Kultur sent me for act III of Siegfried has a stereo track that is the same level as the other two acts, but all three acts on the DVD sound more like the lower quality audio on the act III of the blu-ray, but not quite as strident.

Update:I wrote Kultur about this issue, and this is the response I got on 11/13/12:

Dear Mr. Eitan,

We received your e-mail regarding the stereo audio on Act III of the Siegfried disc from the Wagner Blu-ray set.

When we released this on standard DVD, there was a problem in the master tape where partially through Act III the audio changed from stereo to mono.
It was corrected by using the audio track from Warner's original DVD released years ago.

And to avoid the same problem for the Blu-ray, the same audio track was used.  So yes, it was from a different source.
The volume level can obviously be changed by the viewer, but as far as the other things you mentioned such as reverb, or being more ""forward"", the only way that could be changed is if it were re-mixed somehow.  Unfortunately, we don't have any access to the multiple track audio to do that.

I also wanted to let you know that there are no problems with the two surround sound tracks in Dolby 5.1 or in DTS if you have the ability to listen to it that way.

Here are some points which might prove useful for your purchase decision.

0. This Ring Cycle was filmed in the summer of 1991 and 1992 at the Bayreuth Festspielhaus without the audience, after a 5-year period of Bayreuth Workshop. It is the first Ring Cycle recorded in the true surround setting. Perhaps due to the 5-year experience, the performers have the wonderful sense of ""living-in"" the drama.

1. If my personal taste is any guide, this is by very far the best musical performance of the ring cycle ever recorded *in video* to date. Daniel Barenboim proves himself a true Wagner conductor (and a true disciple of Wilhelm Furtwngler) with this magnificently intense performance, probably the best in decades. Here every detail in the score contributes to the drama and no dramatic event is not underlined by the music. He also picked many fresh voices over the established Wagnerian singers. For example neither Anne Evans nor John Tomlinson is your average Wagner singer. Several of the principals had never performed their roles before, including Tomlinson, Jerusalem, and von Kannen. They however deliver their roles with fresh voice and insight. (It's worth noting that Evans and many others in this production had been trained by Reginald Goodall in the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/English-National-Opera-s-Ring-production/dp/B00005LZVY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">English National Opera's Ring production</a>&nbsp;and it shows.) On the theatrical front, Harry Kupfer's probing production can probably share the pantheon with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bayreuth-Centennial-Ring-production-by-Patrice-Chreau/dp/B0009F2EPU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bayreuth Centennial Ring production by Patrice Chreau</a>. At least, these two are my favorite staging of the Ring, with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Copenhagen-Ring/dp/B0019LZ19O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Copenhagen Ring</a>&nbsp;running a distant third. On the surface, Kupfer's unconventional characterization of the characters can seem extreme. However, the inner logic quickly reveals itself (especially on the repeat viewing) and the extremism becomes inevitability. Wagner's music thus reaches its fullest dramatic potential.

2. The previous&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kultur-DVD-release/dp/B005FWO3QK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kultur DVD release</a>&nbsp;has greatly improved the video and audio quality over the preceding Warner Classics releases in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Der-Ring-Des-Nibelungen-7-DVD/dp/B000QFBW6K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Der Ring Des Nibelungen (7 DVD)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ring-Des-Nibelungen-7-DVD/dp/B002G1TSBI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ring Des Nibelungen (7 DVD)</a>. Now with the blu-ray release the video and the DTS sound track  see some further improvements. I have had mixed feeling about Kultur. On the one hand, I am thankful that the company keeps a lot of music films in print at affordable prices. On the other hand, their DVD post-production work is often subpar. Too often, the company chooses low bitrate processing/encoding to fit the film into less DVD discs. As a  result, grainy video with distorted colors and heavily compressed poor audio quality are almost synonymous to Kultur. There, however, Kultur surprises us with this very high quality work. According to the booklet, both video and the audio are remastered from the original high definition master tapes. In order to maximize the video/audio quality of this new presentation Kultur decides to spread the opera into 11 DVD discs, with highest bitrates. The improvements in both departments are nothing less than spectacular. Now the video is crystal clear and the sound has stunning depth, both in LPCM and in DTS 5.1 tracks. Even if you own the previous Warner release, the upgrade is well worth it.

3. This blu-ray edition is an ALL REGION release. So go ahead and purchase it even if you don't live in Northern America.

4. It is worth repeating that even if the resolution of video and sound is identical to the previous&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kultur-s-DVD-edition/dp/B005FWO3QK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kultur's DVD edition</a>, it is just so much more convenient to have one disc per opera/night. Save viewers the hassle of constantly changing discs! Now, with the improved video and audio, the choice is obvious for those who own a blu-ray player.

5. However, this is an early HiFi video recording and there is infrequent streaking in the dark black area. The multi-channel setting also places emphasis on the two main speakers. In terms of technical aspects, you will not mistake this as a new recording. The best reason to buy this set is for its artistic merits.

Most highly recommended.

(*) I was among the first group to have purchased Kultur's release of remastered Barenboim's Bayreuth Ring cycle. Initially, Kultur goofed up in the first release. The LPCM sound track on the second half of Disc 8 was in mono. (That is, Siegfried Act III, Track 11 onward, right after Siegfried's ""Das ist kein Mann!"".) Fortunately, Kultur owns up the mistake: Not only was the problem quickly fixed once the company was notified, but they also sent out free replacement discs when contacted. (I got my replacement copy promptly.)

While corresponding with Kultur's ""John"", I urged the company to release it in the blu-ray format. ""Even if the resolution of video and sound can not be further improved, it is just so much more convenient to have one disc per opera/night!"" And I pledged to purchase the blu-ray version once it is released. (As you can see, I pre-ordered the set!) So consider this review a thank-you note to Kultur.",1346112000,24,6483,6.315254237288135

2837989,5,B000QFBW6K,"This review is an update to the earlier summary review supplied for the DVD box set. I now have received the Blu-ray upgrade and it has fulfilled all my hopes for a markedly enhanced experience. The performances remain the same of course so much of what follows applies to both the DVD and the Blu-ray issues. Nevertheless it must be stressed at the outset that all the usual advantages of Blu-ray are readily to be enjoyed with this latest version of the recording. Those interested in the upgrade may purchase it without fear of disappointment.

The biggest surprise for me when first experiencing this set of the Ring was the effect of considerable movement - much of it fast and urgent. This is a concept far from the old style of `stand and deliver' and it achieves a considerable accumulative effect when followed through the whole set of four operas. For the purposes of this review I will restrict myself to considering the broad issues relating to this set. More specific comments can be found under the individual issues which can still be bought separately on DVD.

Quick movement is important to this production as mentioned above. Considerable use is made of the vast stage at Bayreuth so that the settings can be built on an appropriately huge scale and so that characters can move rapidly around unfettered by limitations of space. This enables this entire production to differ fundamentally from many other conceptions that are more constrained by spatial considerations and which frequently have far less urgent movement and which have to rely upon other means to achieve their purpose.

Quite apart from the purely musical considerations, this set makes extensive use of laser technology. This is often in the form of shafts of light than can vary in thickness from narrow shafts to sheets of colour.

The time period is established as modern to futuristic but of an indeterminate moment. This is achieved via costumes and stage sets which are a mixture of function and abstraction. Key dramatic staging moments are effective - such as Valhalla, the Nibelung realm, toad catching, Mime's furnace, the dragon fight, Brunnhilde's rock etc. The sense of the epic is totally established throughout this set along with the awareness of Wotan's essential instability of character which makes him vulnerable to the errors of judgement which inevitably lead to his and the gods ultimate downfall. This is drama writ large and Barenboim, the producer, the cast and the orchestra fully deliver on all counts.

None of this would be worthwhile of course if the musical values were inadequate. In this case the whole cast delivers consistently high standards with not a weak moment anywhere. Wotan, as an unpredictable and dominant God, is superb throughout and is portrayed by John Tomlinson who was at the peak of his powers at the time and in magnificent voice. Wotan is, of course, very much the central figure in this drama and Tomlinson totally succeeds in delivering a clear sense of the epic while Wotan's mental instability is wonderfully shown through his physical presence. Perfect.

Loge fulfils his distantly scheming role well and Graham Clark has just the right character for this role. Alberich, portrayed by Gunter von Kannen is powerful and delivers his curse effectively as he must and remains a powerful force throughout.  Mime is also a much stronger than often portrayed and more believable character than usual and Jerusalem, as Siegfried, avoids appearing to be just a spoiled and immature bully. He is at the peak of his form and, to my mind, is far more effective here than in the Levine/Met performance. Hunding and Hagen are both satisfyingly menacing and Seigmunde and Seiglinde make a convincing pair. Brunnhilde, performed by Anne Evans, sings outstandingly throughout and is a totally believable pivotal characterisation. The recorded sound fully supports Barenboim's driving energy. In a word - marvellous.

The recording dates from 1992 but has already been digitally enhanced for DVD and now appears as a much improved Blu-ray with sharper image definition and sound (only listened to in DTS surround). What cannot be solved is the considerable amount of trailing light as the film technology of the time could not keep up with the faster actions in the predominantly dark lighting. However I personally find the trailing image effects surrounding the various characters as they move swiftly about rather effective as it emphasises their essentially unpredictable and often unbalanced mental and physical speed. Strange, as normally I would find this a distracting visual problem but it is almost a total positive here. The sound is thrillingly 'real' and is presented in DTS 5.1 (excellent) and stereo (untested)

I unhesitatingly find that this is my benchmark preferred version despite having owned two other highly respected video productions on DVD and Blu-ray and therefore equally unhesitatingly give it the full 5 stars even bearing in mind the 1992 recording issues as described above. This is further enhanced by currently being at an astonishingly low bargain price and now available as a Blu-ray and most definitely enhanced.

This review summary, it must be stressed yet again, has been written after receipt of the Blu-ray set and is not in anticipation of its arrival. This issue, in my opinion, is simply essential. I am absolutely delighted and it has proved to be well worth the long wait.

I would therefore suggest that this very famous set deserves serious consideration as a potential purchase especially in its new Blu-ray format.

---------------------------------
The previous reviews by Todd Kay and Joseph Ponessa have eloquently praised the performance and video/audio quality respectively. I am writing this mainly to provide a few additional pieces of information.

0. First off, this review applies only to the Kultur release of Barenboim's Bayreuth Ring cycle&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wagner-Der-Ring-des-Nibelungen-11-DVD/dp/B005FWO3QK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wagner: Der Ring des Nibelungen (11 DVD)</a>. Warner Classics had previously issued the same performance in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Der-Ring-Des-Nibelungen-7-DVD/dp/B000QFBW6K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Der Ring Des Nibelungen (7 DVD)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ring-Des-Nibelungen-7-DVD/dp/B002G1TSBI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ring Des Nibelungen (7 DVD)</a>.

1. If my personal taste is any guide, this is by very far the best musical performance of the ring cycle ever recorded *in video* to date. Daniel Barenboim proves himself a true Wagner conductor (and a true disciple of Wilhelm Furtwngler) with this magnificently intense performance, probably the best in decades. He also picked many fresh voices over the established Wagnerian singers. For example neither Anne Evans nor John Tomlinson is your average Wagner singer. They however deliver their roles with fresh insight. (It's worth noting that Evans and many others in this production had been trained by Reginald Goodall in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/English-National-Opera-s-Ring-production/dp/B00005LZVY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">English National Opera's Ring production</a>&nbsp;and it shows.) On the theatrical front, Harry Kupfer's probing production can probably share the pantheon with another&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bayreuth-ring-production-by-Patrice-Chreau/dp/B0009F2EPU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bayreuth ring production by Patrice Chreau</a>. At least, these two are my favorite staging of the Ring, with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Copenhagen-Ring/dp/B0019LZ19O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Copenhagen Ring</a>&nbsp;running a distant third. On the surface, Kupfer's unconventional characterization of the characters can seem extreme. However, the inner logic quickly reveals itself (especially on the repeated viewing) and the extremism becomes inevitability.

2. This Kultur release has greatly improved the video and audio quality over the preceding ones. I have had mixed feeling about Kultur. On the one hand, I am thankful that the company keeps a lot of music films in print at affordable prices. On the other hand, their DVD post-production work is often subpar. Too often, the company chooses low bitrate processing/encoding to fit the film into less DVD discs. As a  result, grainy video with distorted colors and heavily compressed poor audio quality are almost synonymous to Kultur. Here, however, Kultur surprises us with this very high quality work. According to the booklet, both video and the audio are remastered from the original high definition master tapes. In order to maximize the video/audio quality of this new presentation Kultur decides to spread the opera into 11 discs, with highest bitrates. The improvements in both departments are nothing less than spectacular. Now the video is crystal clear and the sound has stunning depth, both in LPCM and in DTS 5.1 tracks. Even if you own the previous release, the upgrade is well worth it.

3. This is an NTSC REGION 0 (ALL REGION) release, not region 1 only as claimed in other reviews. No matter where you are, as long as you own a modern NTSC compatible DVD/BD player you can enjoy the Kultur release of this magnificent performance at a stunning low price of $57.

4. For those who don't know: Kultur goofed up in the first release. The LPCM sound track on the second half of Disc 8 was in mono. (That is, Siegfried Act III, Track 11 onward, right after Siegfried's ""Das ist kein Mann!"".) Fortunately, it owns up the mistake: Not only was the problem quickly fixed once the company was notified, they also sent out free replacement discs when contacted. (I got my replacement copy promptly.)

For all these, my kudos to Kultur. Keep up the good work, Kultur, and don't let the quality slip again.

Very highly recommended.",1337990400,5,4758,6.736156351791531
2837991,4,B000QFBW6K,"... an average of 3.5, so let's call it four stars. Wagnerites assured me that it was the best I could get, though not perfect, so I took the plunge. I watched the whole thing, 11 disks, 15.4 hours. I could have attended the ""American"" Ring Cycle recently staged by the San Francisco Opera, or I could have purchased the purportedly ""feminist"" Copenhagen Ring production. I have the impression that every devout Wagner fan has a ""Platonic form"" of the operas in mind, an ideal production in comparison to which any actual staging will be a delusion or a disappointment. This production from the Bayreuth Festspiele surely can't match anyone's ideal.

I've reviewed each of the four operas of the Cycle separately, in more detail.",1322697600,2,729,4.832
2837992,3,B000QFBW6K,"These notes I wrote at the end of two marathon sessions of experiencing the present version of Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen.

I am not an opera expert. I have spent a good portion of my adult life (spanning over 5 decades) in listening to classical music but I have neglected opera somewhat. Wagner's Der Ring along with some works of Bach have given me experiences that I would call ""enthusiastic"" (meaning I experienced god's breath). I cannot put aside my Solti Ring for any appreciable time interval.

I regret that I sat through this production. It will take me sometime to extinguish some aesthetically vulgar visual images. The purity of the images evoked by the Solti Ring as well as Wagner's archetypical conception have been adulterated for me now.

If you are new to Wagner and cannot wait to dive into the Wagnerian world you may be disappointed and even shocked to see the entire opera setting in artistically heterogeneous, cheap settings. You will perhaps be distracted by the fact that a good part of the opera takes place in the shadow of gigantic John Hancock edifices.

Barenboim's rendition is very good, although it lacks the depth of emotion of Solti`s. Singing is excellent. Acting is good. Then there is the stage floor; an aerial view of fields or cobble stones on which the actors like to lie down and roll, sometimes for no apparent reason, no relevance to what is taking place. Iron scaffolds like those used in building, up and down which actors climb, again without any apparent correlation to the nature of the particular scene. These scaffolds pop up here and there, along with rusty half demolished boiler like containers in which actors live, and of course climb on their roof and back down again. In the final opera the Rheingold maidens appear in a grotesque structure which is like a come-from-the-future elevator or maybe it is part of a sewage pipes system. In the first opera, The Rheingold, these maidens swim in the river, electronic works that are pathetically amateurish. The electronic fireworks of this production are horrifyingly ugly. Beams of light that evoke images of kids playing with laser flashlights. The killing of the dragon was visually poor and silly. By the way, the singing of the dying serpent was not dramatic enough.

The actor that impressed me was Gunter von Kannen (Alberich). Jerusalem (Siegfried) was convincing and suited to the role. Wotan (Tomlinson) was good but his physical appearance does not suit the image of father of gods. Mime (Grahan Clark) was good but I wish I had not seen The Cabaret, the movie.

Brunhilde's (Anne Evans) physical profile suited the prototype of a Valkyrie, her singing was very good (it would have been better for me had I not listened to the Solti records (Birgit Nilsson)!). However as an actress she could not at times adequately convey emotions on her facial expression.

It is my thesis that attempts to create modern versions of classical works (I include classical theater plays) tread on very precarious grounds. If they are meant to bring home to today's audiences great works of art (spoon feeding), they fail, for the same reason that translating or explicating poetry fail. Wagner's ring is a dream in the Schopenhauer, psychoanalytic conception, it cannot be explicated, it must be experienced.

The bottom line of my recommendation is that, if you want to see Der Ring on DVD and this is your first visual exposure to this great work, do not buy this. Buy it if you already own other DVD productions of Der Ring, and you want the intellectual stimulation of an experimental version.

Addendum, Sept. 30, 2012

I am pleasantly surprised, and grateful to all of you who found my review worthy of your comments. I am grateful even to those who do not agree with my thesis. Some of you are so knowledgeable that taught all of us things we did not know. I agree with the comments that true Art is produced not only in big cities such as New York or Paris. In fact the greatest obscenities, not only in opera but also in all forms of art including painting and poetry, are produced in such centers, of course, along with monumental achievements.

The question what is good art cannot be answered in discussions like the present one. It takes a lifetime of searching (not only reading or watching but searching like an ascetic searching for god) in order to, hopefully, one would have some insights on this issue. It is interesting that these insights cannot be communicated without loosing much of their meaning. At this point
I thought I might stimulate more discussion, more serious perhaps, by pointing to Wagner's views of the Arts. You may wish to read this book: Wagner, R. Opera and Drama, U of Nebraska Press, Jun 28, 1995, especially pp. 119-
I warn you it is very difficult reading; trust your instinct!

Wagner was influenced by another great book by Gotthold Ephraim Lessing. ""Laocoon: An Essay on the Limits of Painting and Poetry"". Longman, Brown, Green, and Longmans, 1853
Both books are free to read on Google Books, and perhaps archive.org.",1314057600,44,5073,4.818390804597701

2837995,5,B000QFBW6K,"Complete video sets of DER RING DES NIBELUNGEN have proliferated in the DVD era, but it was not terribly long ago that there were only three choices: the Bayreuth centenary staging by Patrice Ch&eacute;reau, conducted by Pierre Boulez (taped for broadcast 1979-80, now on DG DVD); the Met's, directed by Otto Schenk and conducted by James Levine (1989-90, also DG), and this later Bayreuth directed by Harry Kupfer, the orchestra led by Daniel Barenboim (1991-92). All had/have their constituents, and together they still provide a strong backbone for the RING videography. The Met's is the most conservative and literal in taking Wagner's mythic saga more or less at face value, and goes for the most extravagant realism. The Ch&eacute;reau is more provocative and idiosyncratic, treating the work as sociopolitical allegory; the Kupfer is equally provocative in its way, but more of a parable about eternal recurrence, an allusive meditation on ruin and rebirth. Of the three, I could most easily do without the Met's. For a first recommendation, I waffle between the two Bayreuths, which have in common more than their venue and orchestra/chorus. Both feature detailed and committed acting, for example. But the Kupfer/Barenboim does benefit from being the more technically up to date, and it wears its nearly 20 years well, still looking and sounding very good even alongside the post-millennial competition.

Kupfer's greatest strength as a director here is his gift for ""Personenregie."" Every character seems thought through from the ground up. Who is Wotan, Siegmund, Mime, et cetera, not just in some abstract hand-me-down sense but in *this* production, and in relation to all the other characters in his or her sphere? By the time of these video sessions, which I understand Kupfer closely supervised, most of the singers had extensive experience in the production, and this is to the good. The ones who are gifted actors in the first place (such as Graham Clark, indelible both as Loge and the SIEGFRIED Mime) create brilliant portraits, and the ones who are potential liabilities in this department (such as Poul Elming's Siegmund) are brought up at least to a level that their scenes can come off well. Unlike some contemporary opera directors with a strong and not always traditional point of view, Kupfer also has an unmistakably musical ear -- his choices of blocking and action consistently complement what we are hearing rather than ignore or fight it. A list of such episodes in a 904-minute DVD set would be too long, but I think, for example, of John Tomlinson's Wotan and Anne Evans's Br&uuml;nnhilde in the hushed interlude before their great debate in WALK&Uuml;RE, sitting on the stage back to back, facing away from each other -- the anger exhausted, but the hurt, regret, and inevitability seeming to hang in the air. One of the oft-voiced criticisms of this RING is that Kupfer's stage, especially in the earlier chapters, is often ""empty,"" the principal visual motif being a road leading upstage into blackness. But that isn't true, of course. His stage is *full*, not of props but of psychology, humanity, perception. I rewatch scenes here such as the Wotan/Fricka marital quarrel in WALK&Uuml;RE, which gets across not only the surface content but the subtext of a long, conflict-torn, yet once loving and harmonious union, and it almost pains me to imagine people first experiencing the RING via something like the dramatically lifeless multimillion-dollar bore the Met is currently spooling out, with its creaking and malfunction-prone 45-tonne metal planks (""Ticket sales cover less than half the cost of our bad investments, ladies and gentlemen"").

Barenboim's musical leadership occupies some middle ground between Boulez's swiftness and transparency and Levine's ponderousness and expansiveness. Though admittedly a crude measure, the cumulative running times tell something of the tale (Boulez clocking in at 832 minutes, Barenboim 904, Levine 941). Wagner always has been one of Barenboim's strong suits, and he is never less than sensible and pertinent here, often much more. The singing is perhaps as good as it could have been in the period. Tomlinson's Wotan, Clark's Loge/Mime, Linda Finnie's Fricka, and Evans's Br&uuml;nnhilde all leave a positive and lasting impression, as does Siegfried Jerusalem's Siegfried -- both in better voice and more interestingly acted here than in the earlier Met cycle (particularly good as the potion-bewitched Siegfried of G&Ouml;TTERD&Auml;MMERUNG, whom he and Kupfer play as a bit of an entitled sleaze). And what a luxury to have the greatest Wagnerian singing actress of the last 20 years, Waltraud Meier, for the single scene of Waltraute. At worst, the vocal contributions just hover around the adequacy bar: Elming is unlikely to be anyone's favorite Siegmund, and Philip Kang sounds underpowered as Fafner and Hagen.

Barenboim and Tomlinson share their memories of the Kupfer production in a 13-minute featurette taped around the time of the initial DVD release.

There are RING sets that would be no great loss if they vanished from general availability; this is not among them, and its status as the favorite of many connoisseurs is understandable. Its return to the Region 1 catalog is good news. Thus end my comments on matters artistic. However:

IMPORTANT: Exercise caution when ordering! This product presently has three listings on Amazon, a search for ""Der Ring des Nibelugen DVD"" could lead you to any of them, and there is a potential for unpleasant surprise.

The Kupfer/Barenboim RING was initially released on DVD by Warner Classics in 2007. Warner's NTSC release for Region 1, the US and Canada, is now available only for rarity prices (as I write, ""2 new from $699.99""). The studio in the product info for this page is Rhino/WEA.

A separate Amazon page appeared in spring 2011 and seemed to promise an identical item from third-party sellers at affordable prices, the listing even claiming ""All Regions."" The item I received when I ordered from that page was the Warner NTSC release for Regions 2/3/4/5. I do keep an all-regions player as a spare, so I was only minimally inconvenienced, but I posted a brief review under the title ""Warnung"" and attempted (unsuccessfully) to get Amazon to change its product information so other customers would not buy discs they could not view. On the page for the Region 2/3/4/5 set, there is even a scan of the back cover in which ""Region code NTSC 2345"" can be read if one looks closely. The studio in the product info for this page is ""WVI."" You may be reading this review on that page.

Several months later, Kultur announced an October 2011 re-release for Region 1, and a third Amazon page appeared. As often happens when something is reissued, Amazon linked reviews of a previous release (unfortunately, the Warner 2/3/4/5) to the new page. Therefore, not of my doing, my well-intentioned and accurate warning about Warner 2/3/4/5 appeared both on the page where it applied and on one where it did not. Two other reviewers believed I was warning people away from the *Kultur*, and posted corrections and admonishments...and *their* reviews now appear both where they are accurate (Kultur R1) and where they are not (Warner 2/3/4/5). I thought a rewrite was in order, and here we are.

The bottom line: If you live in the US or Canada, do not have an all-regions player, and are ordering this RING, look closely at the product information and make sure you are getting the Kultur reissue scheduled for October 2011. The one from the studio ""WVI"" almost certainly will be Region 2/3/4/5.",1305936000,171,7634,5.1008
2837996,5,B000QFBW6K,"If you want to buy this item, ignore the $500 to $1500 price tag Amazon sellers are dementedly charging for this only-briefly-in-print DVD set and heigh thee to Arkiv Music, where it's going for around $150 in a Region 1 edition. I'm guessing they stockpiled some, so get over there while supplies last.
UPDATE: KULTUR home video are re-releasing the Barenboim Bayreuth Ring DVD in what looks like identical packaging for about 100 bucks, available now for pre-order for a late October 2011 release. Given that the last iteration of this set was only available briefly, you may want to snap it up.  So if good conducting, very good acting, fair singing,  interesting if now dated use of lasers, and otherwise minimalist sci-fi/noir staging interest you in the Ring you can do worse.  The music dramas have been served so poorly on video as in the theater, this version is no worse than much of what's available, and only actually falls below the level of ""watchable"" in the last moments of Gotterdammerung.",1287619200,5,1006,4.837209302325581

Up through SIEGFRIED, this is far-and-away my preferred one for the conducting, the singing (John Tomlinson is awesome as Wotan -- there is no other contemporary performance of the role for me), and the staging.  (Alas, things go off the rails in the GOTTERDAMMERUNG staging, so I switch to the venerable Schenck production @ the Met for that one.)

If, however, you want to confront one of the greatest works of art ever created, in any medium, I urge you to experience this version. The ambition in this staging, by Harry Kupfer, is to lay open the universal structures that animate human relations. The technical possibilities of a modern opera house are used all right, but it is always meaning and not spectacle that guides the work.

For Kupfer, as for Wagner, the political and the intimate are fundamentally intertwined. Power is not a substance external to our hearts; power shapes our innermost aspirations. Kupfer successfully avoids the two traps that commonly undercut Ring productions: the insipid traditional fairy tale set and the equally clichd effort to mold the story into a direct historical analogy. The Ring is not about twentieth-century events any more than it is about Norse gods: it is about the levers of power and love that propel every person, in every modern society. This production is as fresh today as it was at the time of the recording nearly thirty years ago.",1509580800,3,1218,4.912621359223301
8196110,5,B000QFBW6K,"This is my second Blu-Ray of Wagner's Ring, the other being the more recent of the Metropolitan Opera's (with Levine/Luisi), so I will judge it mainly in comparison to that version.

For people looking to buy only one version of the Ring to begin with, I would recommend the Met's version over this one, mainly for the production value. The Met's version was filmed more recently and broadcast as part of it's live HD series in theaters. As a result it has excellent HD visuals. The sound is also quite even and very clear. Some have criticized the Met's staging and the quality of the singers, but the deficiencies of the staging are largely not a problem on Blu-Ray and the singers are fine (and some, like Eric Owens, are really excellent!).

However, I would also strongly recommend this version as a supplement for those who love Wagner, and principally for the music. The Met version suffers a bit from Levine falling ill and Luisi taking over for the final 2 installments (Siegfriend and Gotterdammerung). In this version with Barenboim, though, we get a much more powerful musical performance of the Ring. In fact, watching and listening to this after the Met version is a real revelation. The score comes alive with Barenboim and the Bayreuth Festival Orchestra. There is such power and dynamism in the music. It is incredible! And it works fantastically well in both the purely instrumental parts and the interaction with the singers (who are very good!). For my personal taste, this is incredible music-making.

Sadly the quality of the video and sound recording is nowhere near the Met version. We hear a lot of stage noise, but worse, the way they recorded the vocals is very uneven. We hear too much echo from the hall, and when singers are facing different directions or in different parts of the stage, their voices may drop out almost entirely. Overall, the sound of the singing is just not very crisp -- nor is the recording of the orchestra as even as one would like. (Sometimes certain brass instruments stand out a bit shrilly). This is so unfortunate as this musical performance of the Ring is really, really masterful and amazing.

Another strange thing is the staging itself and costumes, which are modern and quite odd. The gods wear what appear to be lounge suits with green leaf coverings. It looks a bit silly. They ride an elevator up to Valhalla. That was a poor decision, I think. I don't mind modern stagings, but I just don't understand this one at all to be honest. As mentioned, the video quality isn't that clear. Some scenes are very dark, some seem to have odd lighting that distorts the image a bit.

Again, all that is unfortunate, but the music itself is performed and interpreted very very well. So if you like the Ring, it can be whole-heartedly recommended. I am looking forward to thinking about which set to get as a third now!...",1484870400,6,2876,4.709741550695825

I have owned the Laser Disc, DVD and Blu-ray incarnations of this Ring and continue to frequently turn to the performances on this Blu-ray. I corresponded with Warner Classics after the release of the DVD asking if the original somewhat primitive analog high definition video tapes would be used for a Blu-ray release. They assured me they would and explained that they had re-worked the audio quite a bit. The original recording was only stereo. The used a proprietary German system to re-record the sound as played back through high quality loudspeakers in 5 channels. It sounded like a bad idea to me, but the results is very satisfactory. The video is a fine improvement on the original SD release. It IS analog so it has weaknesses we are not used to in modern digital high definition video recordings. But the recording is over 20 years old and we can be very happy it was so well recorded that long ago. For someone interested in buying a newer recording of The Ring I would suggest the 2007/2009 Mehta-conducted Valencia performance on C-Major. The production is alittle quirky, but I enjoy it and the performance (especially the orchestral playing) and the recorded sound are excellent.",1437264000,3,1282,4.8054298642533935
8196116,3,B000QFBW6K,"personally, I find any deviation from ""literal"" not only irritating, but embarrassing. Pretentious grandstanding, that's what, done by and for snobs. So many different takes on this opera have been done now that a director has to nearly break his neck coming up with a new one. That is not inspiration,and it never was inspired to do it. Its simply looking for personal ""glory""; and some like-minded snob usually gives it to them. This is why ""conservative"" literal productions become so rare, this is my feeling

One more thing, If its so friggin laudable to meddle with the staging of this opera, then why don't they just also meddle with the music then? THAT would be a 'new take' too, right? Why is the music off limits, but its perfectly fine n dandy to make the story completely unrecognizable? I guess you folks believe that yes, Wagner was a musical genius, but as far as Drama goes, any HACK from today's generation knows better than he did? I mean, it makes no more sense to change the slightest bit of his staging of drama than it does to replace horns with electric guitars, and THAT is the road they are going down. Soon these charlatans will completely run out of things to tamper with, and it will be the music next! Why not?

Wagner not only had a specific point to make with this opera, a specific meaning, but he had a specific place and a specific time where he wanted that point to be made, this is certainly MY feeling! EVERY single source he used for inspiration was from the same place and time!
But you could ""easily do without"" the only one offered that is set in that place and time altogether.

I got news, there IS no ""post-millennial competition"", only 'post-millennial confusion'. The only competition is to see how much we can water-down a masterpiece

And this all started because the Nazi party made Wagner ""politically incorrect"", or rather, WE made it so after we learned that the Nazis loved it. We needed to stage it somewhere a little less Germanic, boo hoo hoo. The problem is that one of the greatest aspects of this work of art is the manner in which it unifies all of the ancient myths into a national epic, in the same exact manner that Homer did for Greece thousands of years before it. When they alter the staging, they totally detract from that. Nowadays a director feels he hasn't done his job until he has completely butchered the opera and the only recognizable thing is the music.... so far anyway. The more outlandish and bizarre the staging is the more 'original' the director then alerts the media that he is

Very soon the 'literal' staging is going to be seen as the radical version, completely avant garde and unique. The director of a 'literal' treatment will be seen as a pioneering artist by these hypocritical, self proclaimed geniuses. Anything can be great art, all you need do is get a good review, that proves it is great I bet. The directors who have, over and over, tampered with the staging of this most supreme of artistic achievement have proven THAT enough times. Why are they so constantly unsatisfied with the story as invisioned by Wagner originally?",1434499200,7,3123,4.61981981981982
