4489119,3,B004WSA4B6,I bought this for my grandson who is three and a half.  We have four fireman Sam videos and this one is his least favorite.,1312243200,,123,3.92
4489120,5,B004WSA4B6,I would recommend this DVD for any two year old who likes fire trucks and firemen.  My 30 month grandson is thrilled to watch Fireman Sam and his colleagues put out fires and save people with the jaws of life!,1312156800,,209,4.225
4489121,4,B004WSA4B6,"Fireman Sam: Brave New Rescues is the latest release of the Fireman Sam series.  My 5 year old son is obsessed with this show - he found it on Netflix streaming and has watched each of the older ones at least 30 times each.  Unfortunately, this one isn't available on Netflix so I decided to surprise him and he was thrilled.

I love that this is a european show - seems like it is Irish or Scottish - and they haven't tried to Americanize it - they have their accents, it takes place in a small fishing village and Sam is the ""hero next door"".  Norman price is one of the main characters and he is a little boy who always needs rescuing - my son has named his fish Norman Price.  It is a fun little show with no whining from the characters - Norman gets in trouble with his mother all the time.  I can't stand the shows where the kid whines constantly and ends up with exactly what they want (for example - Cailiou).

Educationally speaking, it does teach alot about fire safety and personal safety in general.  My son pointed out to me the other day that the fire station we just passed was practicing ""fire training exercises"".

I recommend this to anyone with a child who has an interest in firemen - a lot of fun!",1311638400,,1218,4.238095238095238
4489122,4,B004WSA4B6,"""Fireman Sam:  Brave New Rescues"" is a great DVD for both boys and girls.  It not only teaches safety and teamwork but it includes firemen which my boys love!  Fireman Sam is also the only show I can think of that features firemen and it also is a show that we always seem to miss on tv.  There are six episodes total on the DVD and it definitely occupies my boys, maybe too much since they want to watch it over and over again!  The DVD is kid-friendly and for ages 2 and up.  Oh and the animation is very bright and well-animated.

Episodes:

  Cry Wolf
  Blow Me Down
  Dily's Big Surprise
  Model Plane
  Open Day

4489130,4,B004WSA4B6,"The primary colors, friendly children voices, the animation, the episode themes are good lessons for children.  Adults will enjoy it too.
The British accent makes some words hard to understand in Norman's mom, some community people and children.  Watching it over will probably make it more clear, as the ear adjusts to the accent.  I did not like the final message in the episode of the remote controlled plane where the community person sends the plane after Norman. This shows the adult to be revenge-seeking, vindictive toward children.  Good discipline sends the message to the child:  the adult trusts the child will learn from mistakes, and you go forward on a better plane of trust and love.

4489134,1,B004WSA4B6,"Stereotyped caricatures, predictable plot lines and totally misguided morality. Ineptitude and poor judgement are always rewarded by a ""get out of jail free"" device. That said our two and a half year old loves this show more than almost anything, he's very into firemen and their trucks so this show satisfies him to no end. The only thing the rest of the family doesn't hate about it is the lovely Welsh accents. Nice concept, but terrible writing and acting.",1393632000,,460,4.8354430379746836
4489135,5,B004WSA4B6,"Fireman Sam is something my two year old LOVES.  I happened on it by accident because he was in a stage where he was obsessed with firetrucks.  We now watch at least one episode daily.  There are 4-6 episodes in the entire 60 minutes.  I believe the series is set in Wales, which makes for some interesting accidents, but he doesn't mind.  It follows fireman Sam and the crew as well as 4 children, their parents and pets in the town of Pontypandy.  Two of those children are fairly mischievous, so there is always a story to tell.",1391385600,,531,4.36734693877551
