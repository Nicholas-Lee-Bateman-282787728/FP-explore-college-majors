3071096,1,B00120LPO2,"I have watched this cyber sunday pay per view since it came out in 2004.  I think it was also called taboo tuesday at first.  It claims that it is the most interactive ppv in wrestling history.  No its not!  Look at all the title matches where us fans supposedly can choose the winner.  But the winner never wins the world title belt:

2004:  HHH vs ""HBK OR EDGE OR BENOIT"".  HBK WINS VOTE, LOSES MATCH.  DOES NOT WIN WORLD TITLE.

2005:  CENA VS KURT VS ""HBK OR KANE OR BIG SHOW"".  OBVIOUSLY HBK WINS AGAIN, BUT DOES NOT WIN WWE TITLE.

2006:  CENA VS BIG SHOW VS KING BOOKER.  At first i thought this would be a history pay per view with 3 titles on the line and should be saved for wrestlemania.  but of course it became predictable:  on raw CENA persuades audience to vote to have booker t's title on the line.  ironically booker t's title is on the line.  does anyone win his title and leave the event as dual champ?  no, booker t retains.  boring.

2007:  ORTON VS ""HBK OR KENNEDY OR JEFF HARDY"".  of course, HBK wins the vote again, for a third time!  that is repetitive, that is boring, that is predictable.  HBK wins via DQ, doesnt win title.  title again does not change hands.

2008:  MATT HARDY VS ""FINLAY OR HENRY OR EVAN BOURNE"".  MATT wins.  no world title change again.

  HHH VS ""JEFF OR JEFF & KOZLOV"".  Jeff wins votes, not title.

sure there was a batista vs jericho match where batista wins the title, but the fans were not able to choose the opponent.  for example:  jericho vs batista or hbk or punk.  it would be nice for the fans to choose who the next champ would be.

WORST PAY PER VIEW SERIES IN HISTORY",1228694400,,1631,4.219672131147541
3071097,5,B00120LPO2,"Cyber Sunday kicks off the event with a WWE.com exclusive Cyber Sunday Preview match between Shelton Benjamin and his opponent voted in by the WWE fans who is R-Truth. The match was too short but I liked it because it was free unlike the rest of the Pay-Per-View. Any it was an exciting match for the United States Championship. Shelton Benjamin wins and retains the title. I give this match a 7 out of 10.

The first official match was a No Holds Barred match as voted in by WWE fans between Rey Mysterio and Kane. This was a very entertaining match and Rey shows everybody escpecially Kane how he is not dead. Rey wins. 7 out of 10.

The second match was for the ECW Championship between the champ Matt Hardy and as voted in by the WWE fans Evan Bourne. A great match no one knew who was going to win but the experience difference took part in the decison. Matt Hardy wins and retains the ECW title. Matt after the match said that anytime Evan wants a rematch he has it. But that won't be happening soon because Evan is out with an injury. Great match. 7.8 out of 10.

The third match as voted by the WWE fans Miz and Morrison vs Cryme Tyme. I didn't care for this. Miz and Morrison win. 6 out of 10.

The fourth match was between Santino and as voted in by the WWE fans the Honky Tonk Man for the Intercontinental Championship. Stupid match. Honky wins by disqualification. 3 out of 10.

The fifth match was between The Undertaker and Big Show in a Last Man Standing match as voted in by the WWE fans. A great match. There were spots where I thought 'Taker was done for but he came back and won. 8 out of 10.

The sixth match was Triple H faced off against whoever the WWE fans chose with that man being Jeff Hardy for the WWE Championship. A great match. There were spots where I thought Jeff was going to win but once again he is one step away. Very good match. 8 out of 10.

The seventh match and the main event was between Chris Jericho and 'The Animal' Batista for the World Heavyweight Championship with the special referee being Stone Cold Steve Austin as voted in by the WWE fans. It was a fun match to watch with the other referee choices getting involved but Batista was able to beat Jericho even though Jericho hit Batista with the World Title belt. Batista finally wins the World Heavyweight Championship he has tried to win back for almost a year. A stellar main event. 8.5 out of 10.

This years Cyber Sunday is by far the best one yet. Every match was decided by the WWE fans whether it was opponents,match types,or special guest referee this event lives up to its expectations. 8 out of 10 overall.",1226188800,2,2617,4.294117647058823
3071098,3,B00120LPO2,"I had low expectations for this show but it turned out to be pretty good.  There was nothing on this show that really stands out and makes it worth purchasing, but there was not much to complain about as far as the matches were concerned (the outcomes are another story).  Overall this was a pretty enjoyable show, and despite being a throwaway ppv leading up to Survivor Series this is a pretty solid effort from WWE.  Matches are rated out of 5 stars (*****).

1. No Holds Barred Match:
  Rey Mysterio vs. Kane

I was a little suprised that this was given the nod as an opener, but this match doesn't dissapoint.  We all know this fued has been horrible and hopefully it ends soon, but there were some nice spots and some exciting near falls at the end. Pretty enjoyable match.  **1/2

2. ECW Championship Match:
  Matt Hardy (c) vs. Evan Bourne

This was a very enjoyable match with some good psychology as Matt Hardy worked over Bourne's lower back and ribs.  Nice mix of high risk action as well, and I believe these two meshed exceptionally.  Some very exciting near falls at the end teasing a possible title change, but in the end Hardy comes out on top.  Definately hope to see more of this in the future, and maybe a little more time to work, but I can't say enough about how talented Evan Bourne is.  ***1/4

3. John Morrison & the Miz vs. Cryme Tyme (JTG & Shad)

I was very surprised and disappointed that fans opted to vote for this instead of actually having a tag team championship match on a ppv, which to me would also have been a better match (that being Priceless vs. CM Punk and Kofi Kingston).  This is certainly not a bad match, but it is very average and seemed pointless, as there was really nothing on the line.  Worth at least a look, but this is pretty much a Raw match.  **1/4

4. Intercontinental Championship Match:
  Santino Marella (c) vs. The Honky Tonk Man

This was an absolutely shockingly poor match.  I understand that this was meant to be comedy, but this was just a poor, poor match, made worse by the DQ ending.  This is not a blessing for fans who actually want to see the Intercontinental title defended on ppv.  DUD

5. Last Man Standing Match:
  Big Show vs. the Undertaker

This was the tale of two halves.  The first half, aside from a couple nice spots, was very, very boring. However, the second half was very good, with some very nice spots including a chokeslam through the ECW announce table, some nice DDTs, powerful chair shots, and several 8 and 9 counts that were exciting.  It must be said, however, that referee Charles Robinson was telegraphing these counts and the finish to the match rather obviously at times, as he was clearly slow counting and waiting for the Undertaker to get up when he could have easily counted him out.  If you watch you'll see what I mean.  Anyway, this was quite an enjoyable and believable slugfest of a match that I wound up enjoying much more than I thought I would.  ***

6. Divas Halloween Costume Contest

Don't Care.

7. WWE Championship Match:
  Triple H (c) vs. Jeff Hardy

These two had another excellent match, but it felt like it was missing something compared to their previous encounter at No Mercy.  It also must be said that this was practically the same match as their contest at No Mercy, but like I said this still felt like it was missing something.  Despite these two rather minor complaints, this was a really good match.  ***3/4

8. World Heavyweight Championship Match:
  Chris Jericho (c) vs. Batista w/ Guest Referee Stone Cold Steve Austin

This was another solid contest, a bit slow at times but with some nice psychology with Jericho working over Batista's knee (which Batista surprisingly sold throughout the match and even the next night on Raw!).  I must say that the booking seems backwards with this, as usually the guest referee is used to stack the odds against the face and not the other way around, especially considering how dominant Batista has been made to look it seems ridiculous to stack the odds against Jericho.  I obviously don't have much time for Batista and Jericho was definately the ring general here, but there isn't too much to complain about.  There was so much interference at the end that I thought for a moment I was watching TNA, and while I normally do not like overbooking it actually helped this match quite a bit.  I was very disappointed with Batista winning the belt as I felt Jericho's heel title reign was coming along extreemly well, and it seems like Batista never loses.  I also thought throughout this fued that Jericho was made to look very weak and unimposing, but I have to say, in this match Jericho got his fair share of offense in and at times appeared to have the match won.  All in all this was a solid match and a pretty good way to end the show, and it's always nice to see Austin get involved.  ***1/4

Well that wraps up another ppv.  I thought this was a very decent show, but there is really nothing here noteworthy enough to warrant a purchase.  I would definately recommend renting this, but I think a purchase would be disappointing.  The title change at the end was the only thing keeping this show from being completely irrelevant, but all in all there isn't a whole lot to complain about here.",1225065600,,5271,4.5190677966101696
3071099,4,B00120LPO2,"Rey Mysterio vs Kane in a No Holds Barred Match: Kane dominates a little but Rey reverses the Choke Slam into his 6:19 splash move to win the match.

  Evan Bourne vs Matt Hardy: This was one of the best matches of the night with many reversals and near pin falls. End comes when Evan reverses the Twist of Fate into a pin, Hardy kicks out and hits the Twist of Fate right after for the win.

  Santino vs Honkey Tonk Man: The 3 Legends look like they got in shape for the match but it was still a waste. Santino is entertaining but still no way should he have a long title reign. It was hardly a mtch because Beth Phoenix tripped Honkey Tonk not long into the match to cause a DQ. Then Piper and Goldust came out to get a piece of Santino. Meanwhile C.M Punk didn't even have a match and the Shelton Benjaman match didn't even air on the PPV! Benjaman beat R. Truth though with his finisher.

  Cryme Time vs John Morrison and The MiZ: That's right, fans actually voted for this over a tag team title match. The same thing happened that has always happens when the 2 teams have wrestled, Miz and Morrison won.

  Big Show vs Undertaker in a Last Man Standing Match: Big Show dominated a lot of the match and could have easily have won if the ref didn't pause in between each number while counting. One time it was clear that Taker didn't even make the count but the ref stood over him waiting for him to fully stand. End comes when Taker knocks out Show with that choke hold of his to win the match.

  Hardy vs HHH: Hardy really deserves to be champ. He took HHH to the limit once again and this was even a better match than their last. I think HHH is just on Smackdown though so he can beat Undertaker at WM. Beating Flair's title reign record and ending Taker's streak at WM would be impressive he wasn't just pushing himself. Anyway end comes when HHH stops Hardy from going high risk and hits the Pedigree.

  Batista vs Jericho with Stone Cold as the ref: This match wasn't a worthy main event to an otherwise really good ppv. Jericho jobbed on Raw the last few weeks, so I was really hoping he'd win this match. He took out Batista's legs a lot, hit him with the belt and JBL even made a run in but boring Batista still won.

  It's just because dumb Cena is coming back so they can wrestle again. Jericho deserved a longer reign though. If he was going to lose it, should have been to HBK. He hasn't even been champ that many times. No way, should guys like Batista and Cena be champ more than HBK. Hell I wish that even C.M punk was in this match over Batista, he hasn't even had a match at a PPV 3 in a row. If anyone was going to be a new champ tonight, should have been someone with actual talent, like Bourne or Jeff Hardy.",1225065600,2,2737,4.1555977229601515

3071126,4,B00120LPO2,"I won't mince words. Let's get to it:

Matt Hardy Vs. Vladimir Kozlov - Not a bad opener.  We know that Hardy can go and while I don't think that Kozlov is main event material, he does have some skills. Certainly better than some of the other big men WWE try to push suck as Ezekial and The Great Khali.

Back to the match, it has some moments and even some interesting submission spots by Kozlov. The Russian Mauler wins with his chokeslam/spinebuster combo after Hardy hit the ringpost with his head.

Rey Mysterio Vs. C.M. Punk - The winner of this match would get a guaranteed WWE I-C title shot against then champion William Regal. This first meeting between these two was almost a Ring Of Honor type bout as they used moves rarely seen in WWE! Also, some surprise submissions such as Rey (who isn't known for them) turned a tilt a whirl backbreaker attempt into a Fujiwara armbar and Punk (who is known for submissions) used a variation of the late Chris Benoit's crossface.

This exciting match ends with a stiff GTS that legitimately breaks Mysterio's nose! OUCH! Punk gets the win and his title shot. Has to be considered 2nd best match of the night!

Finlay Vs. Mark Henry (Belfast Brawl) - Nothing special here but not bad. Its watchable. Finlay wins after Hornswaggle passes him a shelieghly (sp?) to knock out Henry.

Batista Vs. Randy Orton - In one of the most anticipated bouts, ""The Animal"" faced off with his former Evolution mate for the first time in 3 years (Batista DID have a title bout with Orton in 2005 shortly after WrestleMania 21).

Early on, Cody Rhodes and Manu interfered on Orton's behalf but rather than DQ Orton, the ref threw out Rhodes and Manu and allowed the match to continue. From there, it was mainly rest holds and was pretty slow until the final moments when both guys were going for the win. In this one, Batista gets the win after getting Orton in the Batista Bomb from a unique position. Good bout.

Mickie James, Michelle McCool, Kelly Kelly & Maria Vs. Maryse, Jillian, Naytalia & Victoria (Santa's Little Helper Tag Team Match) - This was okay as well. Nothing special though. Too bad then WWE Women's champ Beth Phoenix and Melina (who was injured at the time) wasn't part of this.

Overall, Mickie, Naytalia & Maryse carried this bout. Kelly Kelly is improving but was just okay here. Maria, at this point, is just eye candy and while Michelle McCool is competent in the ring, she's overrated in my view!

As for Victoria, I felt bad for her. In a way, I am glad she's retired because she was being used sooooo poorly! This is the same woman that used to give Trish Stratus the matches of her life and gave other top Divas such as Lita, Jazz and Molly Holly fits and this is how she's being used?! What crap!

Anyway, worth one watch but isn't must see viewing.

John Cena Vs. Chris Jericho (World Heavyweight Title Match) - While not on the level of their two 2005 matches (SummerSlam 2005 & ""Loser Gets Fired"" on RAW), this one was good. Very few men can get a good performance out of John Cena. Jericho is one of those guys!

This one was pretty physical and it came down to The Walls Of Jericho VS. The STFU. This time around, the STFU came out on top as Cena reversed The Walls into the hold! Cena retains the World title.

Edge Vs. HHH Vs. Jeff Hardy (WWE Title Match) - In this Triple Threat bout, all three men gave their all. This match could've easily been at WrestleMania or one of the other big cards. It was that good of quality. We get brief appearances from both Kozlov and Matt Hardy but their interference had little bearing on the matches.

Ends when Jeff hits his Swanton on Edge that knocks HHH off the pin! The ovation Jeff got for his win was overwhelming at the crowd exploded for his win! For wrestling fans, think Ron Simmons winning his WCW title in 1992 over Vader or 2004 when Eddie Guerrero beat Brock Lesner for the WWE title! For non-wrestling fans, think of the ovations that our current president Barack Obama gets. It was that loud!

The only special feature on this is a recap from The Miz and John Morrison. I haven't watched it yet so I can't make a comment on it.

Overall, while this card isn't a must get, it is worth your money!",1232928000,2,4221,4.44559585492228
3071127,4,B00120LPO2,"Matt Hardy vs. Vladmir Kozlov - This was a non-title match with the excuse being that Kozlov never wrestled in ECW to get a title match & that it was a personal issue.  If your used to the fast paced type of opening match then you won't like this one as it was just average & nothing special but I'll give credit to Matt Hardy for giving me a better watchable match than I usually see from Kozlov.

Rey Mysterio vs. C.M. Punk - The finals of the Intercontinental Title tournament here & quite frankly, this was the match that should have been the opener as it was exactly what you would expect from both men & a great performance that was needed from both men after their recent lackluster feuds (like Mysterio vs. Kane).  Early chain wrestling with Mysterio's hurt arm being worked on before building up over time with countering each others moves and really got exciting towards the end with a GTS that injured Rey's nose.

Right around here was a segment explaining the current situation between Shawn Michaels & J.B.L.  Eventhough this was a good talk segment, I always felt like these things should be saved for free TV (RAW) instead of taking time away from the undercard on an event that people payed for because you would have gotten the same effect either way.

Belfast Brawl: Finlay vs. Mark Henry - This was just a decent hardcore match with the usual weapons (trash can, steel steps, singapore canes) being brought in the ring & used to make this a more watchable Mark Henry performance that we usually get but it's nothing special past that.

Batista vs. Randy Orton - After teasing a match between these two since the days of Evolution, they lock up for the first time ever...since the episode of RAW after WrestleMania 21.  This was one of those matches that I honestly felt didn't go past ""first gear"" as they kept the same pace throughout the match with it only picking up at various spots with their impact moves & counters instead of just building up over time but I'll give credit here for telling a story with each move of Orton's being very calculated.  It was a good match but I felt like it didn't live up to the ""4 years"" hype they used to build up this match.

Maria & Kelly Kelly & Mickie James & Michelle McCool vs. Victoria & Natalya & Maryse & Jillian Hall - This was a match where all the divas wore their special ""Christmas outfits.""  It seemed a little unusual to see the RAW & SmackDown divas teaming together after only feuding with each other the previous month for Survivor Series.  As another side note, J.R. & Lawler sound like they haven't missed a step with their commentary together with even Matt Striker getting in on the action making Tazz point out how it was the ""most uncomforable line of the evening.""  The match itself was nice & allowed everyone to get their moments in with McCool pulling off a ""phenomenal"" finisher.  All I'm going to say about what happened afterwards with Khali's Kiss Man is...well, to quote Ron Simmons ""DAMN!""

World Champion John Cena vs. Chris Jericho - I didn't see their Survivor Series match so I can't comment but I know that this match was well worked between both men with Jericho targeting Cena's neck early on along with a bulldog into the steel steps outside at one point.  Good back & forth encounter but missing that intensity & main event feel that their 2005 trilogy had.

WWE Champion Edge vs. Triple H vs. Jeff Hardy - For the second year in a row, Edge is in a main event triple threat for a championship while this is Triple H's 7th multiman main event in a year for those trivia fans.  Some action moments throughout the match like Triple H & Jeff Hardy doing a classic ""Hardy Boyz"" spot onto Edge early in the match, Hardy's wisper in the wind with Triple H holding Edge in an ""electric chair,"" the traditional announce table spot, and that finishing move by Jeff Hardy that you were just waiting all match for him to pull off.  This was the match of the night here with this match doing exactly what the other matches were lacking in that it buildup with getting more intense & fast paced overtime with the perfect World Championship win celebration afterwards that was as perfect of a moment that any wrestler or fan can ask for.

The only DVD extra is John Morrison & The Miz doing a critique of Armageddon & if anyone pays attention to their ""Dirt Sheet,"" this is just as entertaining.

In the end, this event reminded me of most of the WWE PPV's this year in that it didn't have a bad match on here & nothing really worthy to skip over but I can't say it was one of their top PPV's of the year with the drawbacks being that with the exception of two matches (HHH/Hardy/Edge & Punk/Mysterio) that the rest of the matches are lacking ""it"" to really make them standout. In the end, this isn't a PPV that you should go rush out to see but you won't feel ripped off either.  This was a 3.5 star event but I'll be nice & round it up to four so I would recommend this after all.",1232409600,,4972,4.422782037239869
3071128,3,B00120LPO2,"From what I've heard about this event I didn't really expect much. But when I watched it for myself, the event didn't turn out so bad as I heard it was suppose to be. To include the HBK/JBL segment wasn't so bad either. But I do think it was a waste of two very good talents. There were some disappointments but overall I was happy with the event. I do have to say though that every match (including the main event) could have been a lot better. Slightly better for the main event however.

Vladimir Kozlov vs. Matt Hardy
With this match not being for the title you could see who was going to win from the start. Kozlov was applying a few nice wrestling holds on Hardy. The match got better with the last 5 minutes. And thats when the crowd got into it. Not a complete waste at all. 3.5/5

Finals of the Intercontinental Championship Tournament
CM Punk vs. Rey Mysterio
I expected way more from these two. Especially with what these two can bring to the table. Punk wrestled a good match with Mysterio pulling off good counters. I do have to say though, Mysterio wasn't so sharp here. But he did use his high flying offense pretty well. Punk scored with a sick GTS for the win which busted Mysterio's nose. Good match but really expected so much more. 4.25/5

Belfast Brawl
Finlay vs. Mark Henry
In my opinion the weakest match on the card. I enjoyed the Little Santa's Helpers match way more than this. Just a few spots with trash can lids & kendo sticks. This could have been saved for ECW to leave HBK & JBL having a match. 2.5/5

Randy Orton vs. Batista
A feud that has been building for four years. The match was the pretty good. But the video promo did help a lot, I must say. The match wasn't bad but once again I expected so more. Not so much more, but more then what I got. Nothing really out of the ordinary. The ending I think is what made the match but I fully think the wrong man won. The match had a good feel to it too. 4/5

Santa's Little Helper 8 Diva Tag Match
Mickie James, Michelle McCool, Maria, & Kelly Kelly vs. Victoria, Natalya, Maryse, & Jillian
On paper this totally seems like a stupid filler diva tag match. But the match wasn't so bad. As I mentioned I enjoyed this match more then the Belfast Brawl. All the divas has a chance to ""strut"" their stuff. And it turned out to be pretty enjoyable. I could have done without the post match kiss cam with the Great Khali & Mae Young though. 3.25/5

World Heavyweight Championship
John Cena vs. Chris Jericho
This match was so much better then from what I heard what these two did at Survivor Series. It didn't seem to have a main event championship feeling but lasting around the 15 minute mark, it was short and sweet. Cena didn't look sloppy as he usually do. Some nice counters. This is one I can watch again and a few more times. 4/5

WWE Championship
Triple H vs. Edge vs. Jeff Hardy
Now this match did have a true championship main event feeling. All the competitors brought their good stuff to the match. Hardy looked to be on fire and was looking for revenge for what happened at the Survivor Series. Probably the best action takes place on the outside. Good physicalty from all three out there. To include a sick table spot involving a spear to Hardy. I felt the end was a good finish. And the interference was nearly un-noticable. Awesome main event & finally a true crowning moment for Jeff Hardy. 5/5

Overall this was a little bit disappointing. But I don't regret getting this at all. The main event lived up to the hype but I don't think the match alone is worthy of purchasing this event. I say you can probably wait in getting this. No need in rushing out right away.",1231804800,,3658,4.32992700729927

No Holds Barred Match
Kane vs. Rey Mysterio
I was happy with the No Holds Barred stipulation being picked. A couple of good weapon use. Kane uses his size to wear down & counter Mysterio. Rey used a lot of his quickness to counter Kane. The match had a nice counter for the end. I enjoyed this match much as the opener. 4/5

Undertaker vs. Big Show
A very good match up here between Show & the deadman. Some very good weapon use & brawling on the outside with a good table spot. The ref had a slip up & pretty much saved Taker at one point. But still a good match and one that will be enjoyed by many of you. 4.25/5

WWE Championship
Triple H vs. Jeff Hardy
Once again you saw this coming. After seeing a great match from these two at No Mercy I guess people wanted see an encore. And Hardy & Trips delivered another huge match up for the title. I actually enjoyed this match the same as their No Mercy encounter. A couple of good submissions & moves by Trips & solid unorthodox offense by Hardy. The last few moments was excellent & added more to the match. That counter into the pedigree from the top rope is a thing to see also. 4.5/5

World Heavyweight Championship w/ Stone Cold Steve Austin the Special Ref
Chris Jericho vs. Batista
I think whenever Stone Cold is the special referee, he adds so much more to the match. He also would add a special stipulation early on to the match. Jericho starts out by working on the injured leg of Batista & take away that powerful offense Batista possesses. The last few minutes of the match with Orton & HBK coming out made this match feel like a true main event. A solid match with an unexpecting finish. 4.25/5

This DVD was a solid event with the majority of the matches delivering. I recommend checking out this ppv sometime. Its pretty worth it.",1230163200,,3062,4.3690685413005275
3071132,3,B00120LPO2,"This was one of those PPVs where half of it is good and the other half is very forgettable.  There is plenty of entertainment to be found on this show, but when you add in all the bad aspects of it, it brings the rating down considerably.  Lets just get right into it, matches are rated out of 5 stars (*****).

1. Non-title Match
ECW Champion Matt Hardy vs. Vladimir Kozlov

Poor opener, but at least they got this over with first.  This wasn't as bad as it could have been, but this was no classic I assure you.  WWE gave the finish of the match away by making this a non-title match, and they obviously wanted to put Kozlov over.  Kozlov, in case you haven't noticed, is one of the most unimpressive workers currently in WWE.  This match didn't exactly do wonders for the prestige of the ECW Championship. *1/4

2. Intercontinental Championship Tournament Finals
Rey Mysterio vs. CM Punk

I was unimpressed with Mysterio in this match as he seemed very sloppy, but all things considered this was a helluva match.  Lots of great offense from Punk, and I was glad to see him go over.  Very enjoyable match, and the stiff GTS to end the match that broke Mysterio's nose (or at least came close) was pretty awesome.  ***1/2

We then got my goodness me a long promo from JBL and Shawn Michaels trying to explain this whole angle.  Best part of the segment came when fans started a small ""Joey Styles"" chant, which I loved.  This segment most definitely should have been on Raw, I am not a fan in the slightest of having these promos on PPV.  The promo was alright but WWE obviously had time they needed to kill

3. Belfast Brawl
Mark Henry vs. Finlay (w/ hornswoggle)

Nothing but weapons shots and a whole lot of uninteresting action.  This wasn't unwatchable and it was better than their previous encounters but this was not a good match.  Very reminiscent of the terrible hardcore title matches from the late '90s and early 2000s. *1/4

4. Batista vs. Randy Orton

This was a disapointment as I was expecting a lot more from this one.  This match really dragged in the early stages and Batista seemed quite lacking, but it picked up quite a bit at the end when both men started hitting all their moves.  At the end of the day this turned into a good match but it could have and should have (in my opinion) been much better.  **3/4

5. 8-Diva Santa's Little Helper Match
Maria, Kelly Kelly, Mickie James, & Michelle McCool
vs.
Maryse, Jillian Hall, Victoria, & Natalya

Does anyone care? Absolutely shocking match here.  I didn't have to go to the bathroom so I actually watched this match, which was indeed a mistake.  A cigarette break would have been a much better plan. However, I give this match one star simply because Michelle McCool did a Styles Clash to end the match.  *

After this disgraceful match we get a Khali kiss cam segment, which ended up involving Mae Young.  I will say nothing more.

6. World Heavyweight Championship Match
John Cena (c) vs. Chris Jericho

Real good match here, much better than their Survivor Series match.  I enjoyed the fact that it was kept relatively short for a title match (give or take 12 minutes), which allowed for mostly fast paced action.  This was a forgone conclusion match as no wrestling fan on earth thought Jericho would win, but it was still a great effort.  ***3/4

7. WWE Championship Match
Edge (c) vs. Triple H vs. Jeff Hardy

Very good match, match of the night, and I must say I was completely dumbfounded when Jeff won.  I did not see that coming at all, and to say I was surprised would be an understatement.  I'm still trying to decide whether or not I buy Jeff as WWE Champion, but I have to say it presents an interesting situation.  This match had a lot of great action including a great announce table spot, and the go home sequence was fantastic.  I definitely could have done without the Kozlov and Matt Hardy interference, as I feel it did nothing for the match, but this was still a great effort by all 3 men.  ****

So there you have it.  While there was definitely entertainment to be found on this show, and there were 3 very good matches, the rest is total garbage.  I would certainly not recommend purchasing this DVD, but rent this for the 3 good matches if you have nothing better to do on a weekend.",1229212800,6,4283,4.458762886597938

3071134,4,B00120LPO2,"WWE CYBER SUNDAY 2008 is a PPV that never becomes as great as it could've been, but it's a good one that's worth your time & money.  This is the fifth year that WWE has produced an ""interactive PPV""; I usually judge these events by how much does it feel like the fans actually had control over the night's turn-of-events.  If the Phoenix crowd's constant enthusiasm is any indication, then the WWE must've done something right:

_____________________________________________

1) No Holds Barred
Rey Mysterio v. Kane
---It's a good thing this one was booked as the opener, because it feels very similar to the other matches these two have had in the past few months.  Unfortunately, this was one of the weaker Kane/Mysterio outings.  The main problem is that it doesn't feel like a No Holds Barred Match!  Instead, I felt like I was watching a typical ""underdog-Rey"" match, with a few neat weapon spots toward the end.  It's not terrible, and does feature a few neat exchanges & counters.  But if it weren't for the Phoenix crowd's participation, I think I'd be even harsher.
""6.0 / 10""
_____________________________________________

***Throughout the evening, the Divas cut promos for their Halloween Contest.  Frankly, this is a half-good-half-bad deal.  Eight of the Divas look gorgeous, in spite of their embarassing promos.  And the other eight deserve bonus paychecks for looking as ridiculous as they did.***
_____________________________________________

2) ECW Championship
Matt Hardy (champion) v. Evan Bourne
---First off, big props to the WWE Universe for selecting the increasingly-exciting Bourne as the challenger.  Finlay would've been a worthy alternative, and hopefully WWE will notice that despite all attempts, Mark Henry will not cut it for much longer.  Bourne takes some stiff punches, and even harder slams.  But his variety of pinfalls attempts and takedowns give Hardy a run for his money.  What I noticed most was that the wrestlers worked their tails off to make each look good; you can see the hard work from start to finish.  If there's any doubt that Matt Hardy & Evan Bourne are the stars of the new ECW, then this will put out doubts to rest.  I don't think this is quite the Match-of-the-Year candidate most have made it out to be, but it's damn close, and certainly the best contest from CYBER SUNDAY 2008.  So sit back, I know you'll enjoy the ride.
""8.0 / 10""
_____________________________________________

3) Cryme Tyme v. John Morrison & The Miz
---Fans voted for this more than a World Tag Team Titles Match?  Hmm...that's a bit sad.  My basic reaction to this match was, ""What happened?""  I love Morrison & Miz, and Cryme Tyme are a combo with unusual offense.  And the crowd loves to hate and love (respectively) both of these teams.  But these four guys were just off.  Even though the crowd made a ton of noise for Cryme Tyme, it felt like a ""your-turn-my-turn"" tag match.  No psychology, and everything feels like a hot tag.  Like the opener, a passable match, but I think these guys could've done much better.
""6.0 / 10""
_____________________________________________

4) Intercontinental Championship
Santino Marella (champion) v. The Honky-Tonk Man
---I was shocked that even though Santino's IC Title run basically was to challenge Honky-Tonk Man's 15-month record as IC champ, Roddy Piper and Goldust almost got an equal percentage of votes.  Even more surprising was that Honky-Tonk Man moved quite well for his age.  Basic & old-school, more more believable than most retired legends' performances.  Sadly, after about 7 minutes of promos & smack-talk & comedy, the match was about 2 minutes tops.  And the aftermath involving all three potential challengers was a typical crowd-pleasing reunion.  Oh well, maybe this was just for fans of WWE's comedy.
""4.5 / 10""
_____________________________________________

5) Last Man Standing Match
The Undertaker v. Big Show
---I enjoyed this about as much as I have with most of the matches between these two wrestlers.  I'm satisfied, but not blown away.  The boxing-style slugfests between these two are very entertaining, and Big Show has been a solid in-ring performer since he returned earlier this year.  There are a couple of neat spots involving steel chairs, and the match is paced very well, as both men get to control the match for just the right amount of time.  It's too bad that this rivalry has been WAY overpushed, and Vickie Guerrero desperately needs to be removed from TV.  Another problem is that referee Charles Robinson makes a few slower counts because (apperantly) Undertaker took too long to get up.  Also, a couple of the match's key spots --- mainly an announcer table spot --- looked pretty weak.  Overall, the crowd (again) really got into this match, and I still enjoyed myself in spite of my nitpicks.
One more thing:
I'm VERY disappointed that the WWE edited out Vickie Guerrero's embarassing blooper, where she misread the fans' votes and announced an ""I Quit"" Match, and had to do a quick do-over.  Go to YouTube, and look up ""Botchamania 57"" to see it.
""6.5 / 10""
_____________________________________________

***Well, it's time to find out which of the 16 Divas won the Halloween Contest, as voted by the WWE fans.  Mickie James' dressup as Lara Croft is my favorite too.  Somehow, all the ladies end up in a random catfight, with the babyfaces survivng the scuffle.  I'm always amazed that these random Divas skirmishes end up with the ladies SMILING after they've just been in a ""FIGHT"".  Yeah...I'm thinking about this way too much.***
_____________________________________________

6) WWE Championship
Triple H (champion) v. Jeff Hardy
---Whoa!  This vote should indicate that Vladimir Kozlov's impressive physique hasn't gotten over with fans, yet.  Then again, Jeff Hardy's near-successes in championship matches have been pushed for almost a year.  As always, these two opponents have good chemistry, and tell compelling stories with their in-ring work.  I always look for new counters between longtime rivals, and I saw a few nice exchanges from both HHH & Jeff.  Like the ECW Title Match, neither man came out a loser when all was said & done.  I still prefer the NO MERCY matchup, because it felt more like either man could've won the match.  But this SMACKDOWN main event still made me believe that Jeff Hardy might...just might...come out on top.  This match was so good, that I ignored my head, and was able to enjoy just like everybody else will.
""7.5 / 10""
_____________________________________________

7) World Heavyweight Championship
Guest Referee - 'Stone Cold' Steve Austin
Chris Jericho (champion) v. Batista
---Boy, I was really worried about this one.  I already knew about the run-ins (more on those later), but also because of how this match began.  Jericho got the advantage that heels usually don't get until about halfway through a match.  After some initial cowardice from Y2J, he quickly went to work on Batista's leg, and was dominant for a good length of time.  The wrestling contest itself is solid, especially because Batista's improved a lot in the last year or two.  The physical match is better than most Jericho/Batista encounters (my favorite was actually on RAW back in June 2008).  But the real highlights are the interference.  I won't give away what happens when, but both Batista and Jericho get some assistance, and the atmosphere is chaotic.  Just when you think a run-in is going to end the main event, the downed opponent kicks out.  I usually don't like these kinds of finishes, but this time it worked so well.  Plus, it's always nice to see Steve Austin once in a while.  He's still the most popular performer in pro wrestling history - Period.
""8.0 / 10""
_____________________________________________

The DVD also includes the pre-show match that was shown on WWE.COM.  Shelton Benjamin defended the United States Championship against R-Truth (the fans' selected opponent).  I think the match itself is about 6 minutes, and isn't anything special.  R-Truth's offense is NOT innovative, and starting to really bore me.  Shelton is a marvelous athlete, who deserves better competition.  Overall, I give the bonus match:
""6.0 / 10""
_____________________________________________

CYBER SUNDAY 2008 doesn't meet its full potential, but it gets the job done.  The three brands' championship materials were different, and easily the best parts of the PPV.  They are the reason to buy the DVD.  The rest of the card is mildly entertaining.  I didn't vote this year because the WWE charged $0.99 for cellphone votes, so maybe those who paid to vote will get into this more than I did.  After all, the Phoenix crowd paid even more money for tickets, and definitely felt like they got their money's worth.

I recommend buying CYBER SUNDAY 2008.  It's not great, but it's good.",1228780800,2,8847,5.043448275862069
3305593,1,B00120LPO2,"I have watched this cyber sunday pay per view since it came out in 2004.  I think it was also called taboo tuesday at first.  It claims that it is the most interactive ppv in wrestling history.  No its not!  Look at all the title matches where us fans supposedly can choose the winner.  But the winner never wins the world title belt:

2004:  HHH vs ""HBK OR EDGE OR BENOIT"".  HBK WINS VOTE, LOSES MATCH.  DOES NOT WIN WORLD TITLE.

2005:  CENA VS KURT VS ""HBK OR KANE OR BIG SHOW"".  OBVIOUSLY HBK WINS AGAIN, BUT DOES NOT WIN WWE TITLE.

2006:  CENA VS BIG SHOW VS KING BOOKER.  At first i thought this would be a history pay per view with 3 titles on the line and should be saved for wrestlemania.  but of course it became predictable:  on raw CENA persuades audience to vote to have booker t's title on the line.  ironically booker t's title is on the line.  does anyone win his title and leave the event as dual champ?  no, booker t retains.  boring.

2007:  ORTON VS ""HBK OR KENNEDY OR JEFF HARDY"".  of course, HBK wins the vote again, for a third time!  that is repetitive, that is boring, that is predictable.  HBK wins via DQ, doesnt win title.  title again does not change hands.

2008:  MATT HARDY VS ""FINLAY OR HENRY OR EVAN BOURNE"".  MATT wins.  no world title change again.

  HHH VS ""JEFF OR JEFF & KOZLOV"".  Jeff wins votes, not title.

sure there was a batista vs jericho match where batista wins the title, but the fans were not able to choose the opponent.  for example:  jericho vs batista or hbk or punk.  it would be nice for the fans to choose who the next champ would be.

3305594,5,B00120LPO2,"Cyber Sunday kicks off the event with a WWE.com exclusive Cyber Sunday Preview match between Shelton Benjamin and his opponent voted in by the WWE fans who is R-Truth. The match was too short but I liked it because it was free unlike the rest of the Pay-Per-View. Any it was an exciting match for the United States Championship. Shelton Benjamin wins and retains the title. I give this match a 7 out of 10.

The first official match was a No Holds Barred match as voted in by WWE fans between Rey Mysterio and Kane. This was a very entertaining match and Rey shows everybody escpecially Kane how he is not dead. Rey wins. 7 out of 10.

The second match was for the ECW Championship between the champ Matt Hardy and as voted in by the WWE fans Evan Bourne. A great match no one knew who was going to win but the experience difference took part in the decison. Matt Hardy wins and retains the ECW title. Matt after the match said that anytime Evan wants a rematch he has it. But that won't be happening soon because Evan is out with an injury. Great match. 7.8 out of 10.

The third match as voted by the WWE fans Miz and Morrison vs Cryme Tyme. I didn't care for this. Miz and Morrison win. 6 out of 10.

The fourth match was between Santino and as voted in by the WWE fans the Honky Tonk Man for the Intercontinental Championship. Stupid match. Honky wins by disqualification. 3 out of 10.

The fifth match was between The Undertaker and Big Show in a Last Man Standing match as voted in by the WWE fans. A great match. There were spots where I thought 'Taker was done for but he came back and won. 8 out of 10.

The sixth match was Triple H faced off against whoever the WWE fans chose with that man being Jeff Hardy for the WWE Championship. A great match. There were spots where I thought Jeff was going to win but once again he is one step away. Very good match. 8 out of 10.

The seventh match and the main event was between Chris Jericho and 'The Animal' Batista for the World Heavyweight Championship with the special referee being Stone Cold Steve Austin as voted in by the WWE fans. It was a fun match to watch with the other referee choices getting involved but Batista was able to beat Jericho even though Jericho hit Batista with the World Title belt. Batista finally wins the World Heavyweight Championship he has tried to win back for almost a year. A stellar main event. 8.5 out of 10.

This years Cyber Sunday is by far the best one yet. Every match was decided by the WWE fans whether it was opponents,match types,or special guest referee this event lives up to its expectations. 8 out of 10 overall.",1226188800,2,2617,4.294117647058823
3305595,3,B00120LPO2,"I had low expectations for this show but it turned out to be pretty good.  There was nothing on this show that really stands out and makes it worth purchasing, but there was not much to complain about as far as the matches were concerned (the outcomes are another story).  Overall this was a pretty enjoyable show, and despite being a throwaway ppv leading up to Survivor Series this is a pretty solid effort from WWE.  Matches are rated out of 5 stars (*****).

1. No Holds Barred Match:
  Rey Mysterio vs. Kane

I was a little suprised that this was given the nod as an opener, but this match doesn't dissapoint.  We all know this fued has been horrible and hopefully it ends soon, but there were some nice spots and some exciting near falls at the end. Pretty enjoyable match.  **1/2

2. ECW Championship Match:
  Matt Hardy (c) vs. Evan Bourne

This was a very enjoyable match with some good psychology as Matt Hardy worked over Bourne's lower back and ribs.  Nice mix of high risk action as well, and I believe these two meshed exceptionally.  Some very exciting near falls at the end teasing a possible title change, but in the end Hardy comes out on top.  Definately hope to see more of this in the future, and maybe a little more time to work, but I can't say enough about how talented Evan Bourne is.  ***1/4

3. John Morrison & the Miz vs. Cryme Tyme (JTG & Shad)

I was very surprised and disappointed that fans opted to vote for this instead of actually having a tag team championship match on a ppv, which to me would also have been a better match (that being Priceless vs. CM Punk and Kofi Kingston).  This is certainly not a bad match, but it is very average and seemed pointless, as there was really nothing on the line.  Worth at least a look, but this is pretty much a Raw match.  **1/4

4. Intercontinental Championship Match:
  Santino Marella (c) vs. The Honky Tonk Man

This was an absolutely shockingly poor match.  I understand that this was meant to be comedy, but this was just a poor, poor match, made worse by the DQ ending.  This is not a blessing for fans who actually want to see the Intercontinental title defended on ppv.  DUD

5. Last Man Standing Match:
  Big Show vs. the Undertaker

This was the tale of two halves.  The first half, aside from a couple nice spots, was very, very boring. However, the second half was very good, with some very nice spots including a chokeslam through the ECW announce table, some nice DDTs, powerful chair shots, and several 8 and 9 counts that were exciting.  It must be said, however, that referee Charles Robinson was telegraphing these counts and the finish to the match rather obviously at times, as he was clearly slow counting and waiting for the Undertaker to get up when he could have easily counted him out.  If you watch you'll see what I mean.  Anyway, this was quite an enjoyable and believable slugfest of a match that I wound up enjoying much more than I thought I would.  ***

6. Divas Halloween Costume Contest

Don't Care.

7. WWE Championship Match:
  Triple H (c) vs. Jeff Hardy

These two had another excellent match, but it felt like it was missing something compared to their previous encounter at No Mercy.  It also must be said that this was practically the same match as their contest at No Mercy, but like I said this still felt like it was missing something.  Despite these two rather minor complaints, this was a really good match.  ***3/4

8. World Heavyweight Championship Match:
  Chris Jericho (c) vs. Batista w/ Guest Referee Stone Cold Steve Austin

This was another solid contest, a bit slow at times but with some nice psychology with Jericho working over Batista's knee (which Batista surprisingly sold throughout the match and even the next night on Raw!).  I must say that the booking seems backwards with this, as usually the guest referee is used to stack the odds against the face and not the other way around, especially considering how dominant Batista has been made to look it seems ridiculous to stack the odds against Jericho.  I obviously don't have much time for Batista and Jericho was definately the ring general here, but there isn't too much to complain about.  There was so much interference at the end that I thought for a moment I was watching TNA, and while I normally do not like overbooking it actually helped this match quite a bit.  I was very disappointed with Batista winning the belt as I felt Jericho's heel title reign was coming along extreemly well, and it seems like Batista never loses.  I also thought throughout this fued that Jericho was made to look very weak and unimposing, but I have to say, in this match Jericho got his fair share of offense in and at times appeared to have the match won.  All in all this was a solid match and a pretty good way to end the show, and it's always nice to see Austin get involved.  ***1/4

Well that wraps up another ppv.  I thought this was a very decent show, but there is really nothing here noteworthy enough to warrant a purchase.  I would definately recommend renting this, but I think a purchase would be disappointing.  The title change at the end was the only thing keeping this show from being completely irrelevant, but all in all there isn't a whole lot to complain about here.",1225065600,,5271,4.5190677966101696
3305596,4,B00120LPO2,"Rey Mysterio vs Kane in a No Holds Barred Match: Kane dominates a little but Rey reverses the Choke Slam into his 6:19 splash move to win the match.

  Evan Bourne vs Matt Hardy: This was one of the best matches of the night with many reversals and near pin falls. End comes when Evan reverses the Twist of Fate into a pin, Hardy kicks out and hits the Twist of Fate right after for the win.

  Santino vs Honkey Tonk Man: The 3 Legends look like they got in shape for the match but it was still a waste. Santino is entertaining but still no way should he have a long title reign. It was hardly a mtch because Beth Phoenix tripped Honkey Tonk not long into the match to cause a DQ. Then Piper and Goldust came out to get a piece of Santino. Meanwhile C.M Punk didn't even have a match and the Shelton Benjaman match didn't even air on the PPV! Benjaman beat R. Truth though with his finisher.

  Cryme Time vs John Morrison and The MiZ: That's right, fans actually voted for this over a tag team title match. The same thing happened that has always happens when the 2 teams have wrestled, Miz and Morrison won.

  Big Show vs Undertaker in a Last Man Standing Match: Big Show dominated a lot of the match and could have easily have won if the ref didn't pause in between each number while counting. One time it was clear that Taker didn't even make the count but the ref stood over him waiting for him to fully stand. End comes when Taker knocks out Show with that choke hold of his to win the match.

  Hardy vs HHH: Hardy really deserves to be champ. He took HHH to the limit once again and this was even a better match than their last. I think HHH is just on Smackdown though so he can beat Undertaker at WM. Beating Flair's title reign record and ending Taker's streak at WM would be impressive he wasn't just pushing himself. Anyway end comes when HHH stops Hardy from going high risk and hits the Pedigree.

  Batista vs Jericho with Stone Cold as the ref: This match wasn't a worthy main event to an otherwise really good ppv. Jericho jobbed on Raw the last few weeks, so I was really hoping he'd win this match. He took out Batista's legs a lot, hit him with the belt and JBL even made a run in but boring Batista still won.

  It's just because dumb Cena is coming back so they can wrestle again. Jericho deserved a longer reign though. If he was going to lose it, should have been to HBK. He hasn't even been champ that many times. No way, should guys like Batista and Cena be champ more than HBK. Hell I wish that even C.M punk was in this match over Batista, he hasn't even had a match at a PPV 3 in a row. If anyone was going to be a new champ tonight, should have been someone with actual talent, like Bourne or Jeff Hardy.",1225065600,2,2737,4.1555977229601515

3305623,4,B00120LPO2,"I won't mince words. Let's get to it:

Matt Hardy Vs. Vladimir Kozlov - Not a bad opener.  We know that Hardy can go and while I don't think that Kozlov is main event material, he does have some skills. Certainly better than some of the other big men WWE try to push suck as Ezekial and The Great Khali.

Back to the match, it has some moments and even some interesting submission spots by Kozlov. The Russian Mauler wins with his chokeslam/spinebuster combo after Hardy hit the ringpost with his head.

Rey Mysterio Vs. C.M. Punk - The winner of this match would get a guaranteed WWE I-C title shot against then champion William Regal. This first meeting between these two was almost a Ring Of Honor type bout as they used moves rarely seen in WWE! Also, some surprise submissions such as Rey (who isn't known for them) turned a tilt a whirl backbreaker attempt into a Fujiwara armbar and Punk (who is known for submissions) used a variation of the late Chris Benoit's crossface.

This exciting match ends with a stiff GTS that legitimately breaks Mysterio's nose! OUCH! Punk gets the win and his title shot. Has to be considered 2nd best match of the night!

Finlay Vs. Mark Henry (Belfast Brawl) - Nothing special here but not bad. Its watchable. Finlay wins after Hornswaggle passes him a shelieghly (sp?) to knock out Henry.

Batista Vs. Randy Orton - In one of the most anticipated bouts, ""The Animal"" faced off with his former Evolution mate for the first time in 3 years (Batista DID have a title bout with Orton in 2005 shortly after WrestleMania 21).

Early on, Cody Rhodes and Manu interfered on Orton's behalf but rather than DQ Orton, the ref threw out Rhodes and Manu and allowed the match to continue. From there, it was mainly rest holds and was pretty slow until the final moments when both guys were going for the win. In this one, Batista gets the win after getting Orton in the Batista Bomb from a unique position. Good bout.

Mickie James, Michelle McCool, Kelly Kelly & Maria Vs. Maryse, Jillian, Naytalia & Victoria (Santa's Little Helper Tag Team Match) - This was okay as well. Nothing special though. Too bad then WWE Women's champ Beth Phoenix and Melina (who was injured at the time) wasn't part of this.

Overall, Mickie, Naytalia & Maryse carried this bout. Kelly Kelly is improving but was just okay here. Maria, at this point, is just eye candy and while Michelle McCool is competent in the ring, she's overrated in my view!

As for Victoria, I felt bad for her. In a way, I am glad she's retired because she was being used sooooo poorly! This is the same woman that used to give Trish Stratus the matches of her life and gave other top Divas such as Lita, Jazz and Molly Holly fits and this is how she's being used?! What crap!

Anyway, worth one watch but isn't must see viewing.

John Cena Vs. Chris Jericho (World Heavyweight Title Match) - While not on the level of their two 2005 matches (SummerSlam 2005 & ""Loser Gets Fired"" on RAW), this one was good. Very few men can get a good performance out of John Cena. Jericho is one of those guys!

This one was pretty physical and it came down to The Walls Of Jericho VS. The STFU. This time around, the STFU came out on top as Cena reversed The Walls into the hold! Cena retains the World title.

Edge Vs. HHH Vs. Jeff Hardy (WWE Title Match) - In this Triple Threat bout, all three men gave their all. This match could've easily been at WrestleMania or one of the other big cards. It was that good of quality. We get brief appearances from both Kozlov and Matt Hardy but their interference had little bearing on the matches.

Ends when Jeff hits his Swanton on Edge that knocks HHH off the pin! The ovation Jeff got for his win was overwhelming at the crowd exploded for his win! For wrestling fans, think Ron Simmons winning his WCW title in 1992 over Vader or 2004 when Eddie Guerrero beat Brock Lesner for the WWE title! For non-wrestling fans, think of the ovations that our current president Barack Obama gets. It was that loud!

The only special feature on this is a recap from The Miz and John Morrison. I haven't watched it yet so I can't make a comment on it.

Overall, while this card isn't a must get, it is worth your money!",1232928000,2,4221,4.44559585492228
3305624,4,B00120LPO2,"Matt Hardy vs. Vladmir Kozlov - This was a non-title match with the excuse being that Kozlov never wrestled in ECW to get a title match & that it was a personal issue.  If your used to the fast paced type of opening match then you won't like this one as it was just average & nothing special but I'll give credit to Matt Hardy for giving me a better watchable match than I usually see from Kozlov.

Rey Mysterio vs. C.M. Punk - The finals of the Intercontinental Title tournament here & quite frankly, this was the match that should have been the opener as it was exactly what you would expect from both men & a great performance that was needed from both men after their recent lackluster feuds (like Mysterio vs. Kane).  Early chain wrestling with Mysterio's hurt arm being worked on before building up over time with countering each others moves and really got exciting towards the end with a GTS that injured Rey's nose.

Right around here was a segment explaining the current situation between Shawn Michaels & J.B.L.  Eventhough this was a good talk segment, I always felt like these things should be saved for free TV (RAW) instead of taking time away from the undercard on an event that people payed for because you would have gotten the same effect either way.

Belfast Brawl: Finlay vs. Mark Henry - This was just a decent hardcore match with the usual weapons (trash can, steel steps, singapore canes) being brought in the ring & used to make this a more watchable Mark Henry performance that we usually get but it's nothing special past that.

Batista vs. Randy Orton - After teasing a match between these two since the days of Evolution, they lock up for the first time ever...since the episode of RAW after WrestleMania 21.  This was one of those matches that I honestly felt didn't go past ""first gear"" as they kept the same pace throughout the match with it only picking up at various spots with their impact moves & counters instead of just building up over time but I'll give credit here for telling a story with each move of Orton's being very calculated.  It was a good match but I felt like it didn't live up to the ""4 years"" hype they used to build up this match.

Maria & Kelly Kelly & Mickie James & Michelle McCool vs. Victoria & Natalya & Maryse & Jillian Hall - This was a match where all the divas wore their special ""Christmas outfits.""  It seemed a little unusual to see the RAW & SmackDown divas teaming together after only feuding with each other the previous month for Survivor Series.  As another side note, J.R. & Lawler sound like they haven't missed a step with their commentary together with even Matt Striker getting in on the action making Tazz point out how it was the ""most uncomforable line of the evening.""  The match itself was nice & allowed everyone to get their moments in with McCool pulling off a ""phenomenal"" finisher.  All I'm going to say about what happened afterwards with Khali's Kiss Man is...well, to quote Ron Simmons ""DAMN!""

World Champion John Cena vs. Chris Jericho - I didn't see their Survivor Series match so I can't comment but I know that this match was well worked between both men with Jericho targeting Cena's neck early on along with a bulldog into the steel steps outside at one point.  Good back & forth encounter but missing that intensity & main event feel that their 2005 trilogy had.

WWE Champion Edge vs. Triple H vs. Jeff Hardy - For the second year in a row, Edge is in a main event triple threat for a championship while this is Triple H's 7th multiman main event in a year for those trivia fans.  Some action moments throughout the match like Triple H & Jeff Hardy doing a classic ""Hardy Boyz"" spot onto Edge early in the match, Hardy's wisper in the wind with Triple H holding Edge in an ""electric chair,"" the traditional announce table spot, and that finishing move by Jeff Hardy that you were just waiting all match for him to pull off.  This was the match of the night here with this match doing exactly what the other matches were lacking in that it buildup with getting more intense & fast paced overtime with the perfect World Championship win celebration afterwards that was as perfect of a moment that any wrestler or fan can ask for.

The only DVD extra is John Morrison & The Miz doing a critique of Armageddon & if anyone pays attention to their ""Dirt Sheet,"" this is just as entertaining.

In the end, this event reminded me of most of the WWE PPV's this year in that it didn't have a bad match on here & nothing really worthy to skip over but I can't say it was one of their top PPV's of the year with the drawbacks being that with the exception of two matches (HHH/Hardy/Edge & Punk/Mysterio) that the rest of the matches are lacking ""it"" to really make them standout. In the end, this isn't a PPV that you should go rush out to see but you won't feel ripped off either.  This was a 3.5 star event but I'll be nice & round it up to four so I would recommend this after all.",1232409600,,4972,4.422782037239869
3305625,3,B00120LPO2,"From what I've heard about this event I didn't really expect much. But when I watched it for myself, the event didn't turn out so bad as I heard it was suppose to be. To include the HBK/JBL segment wasn't so bad either. But I do think it was a waste of two very good talents. There were some disappointments but overall I was happy with the event. I do have to say though that every match (including the main event) could have been a lot better. Slightly better for the main event however.

Vladimir Kozlov vs. Matt Hardy
With this match not being for the title you could see who was going to win from the start. Kozlov was applying a few nice wrestling holds on Hardy. The match got better with the last 5 minutes. And thats when the crowd got into it. Not a complete waste at all. 3.5/5

Finals of the Intercontinental Championship Tournament
CM Punk vs. Rey Mysterio
I expected way more from these two. Especially with what these two can bring to the table. Punk wrestled a good match with Mysterio pulling off good counters. I do have to say though, Mysterio wasn't so sharp here. But he did use his high flying offense pretty well. Punk scored with a sick GTS for the win which busted Mysterio's nose. Good match but really expected so much more. 4.25/5

Belfast Brawl
Finlay vs. Mark Henry
In my opinion the weakest match on the card. I enjoyed the Little Santa's Helpers match way more than this. Just a few spots with trash can lids & kendo sticks. This could have been saved for ECW to leave HBK & JBL having a match. 2.5/5

Randy Orton vs. Batista
A feud that has been building for four years. The match was the pretty good. But the video promo did help a lot, I must say. The match wasn't bad but once again I expected so more. Not so much more, but more then what I got. Nothing really out of the ordinary. The ending I think is what made the match but I fully think the wrong man won. The match had a good feel to it too. 4/5

Santa's Little Helper 8 Diva Tag Match
Mickie James, Michelle McCool, Maria, & Kelly Kelly vs. Victoria, Natalya, Maryse, & Jillian
On paper this totally seems like a stupid filler diva tag match. But the match wasn't so bad. As I mentioned I enjoyed this match more then the Belfast Brawl. All the divas has a chance to ""strut"" their stuff. And it turned out to be pretty enjoyable. I could have done without the post match kiss cam with the Great Khali & Mae Young though. 3.25/5

World Heavyweight Championship
John Cena vs. Chris Jericho
This match was so much better then from what I heard what these two did at Survivor Series. It didn't seem to have a main event championship feeling but lasting around the 15 minute mark, it was short and sweet. Cena didn't look sloppy as he usually do. Some nice counters. This is one I can watch again and a few more times. 4/5

WWE Championship
Triple H vs. Edge vs. Jeff Hardy
Now this match did have a true championship main event feeling. All the competitors brought their good stuff to the match. Hardy looked to be on fire and was looking for revenge for what happened at the Survivor Series. Probably the best action takes place on the outside. Good physicalty from all three out there. To include a sick table spot involving a spear to Hardy. I felt the end was a good finish. And the interference was nearly un-noticable. Awesome main event & finally a true crowning moment for Jeff Hardy. 5/5

Overall this was a little bit disappointing. But I don't regret getting this at all. The main event lived up to the hype but I don't think the match alone is worthy of purchasing this event. I say you can probably wait in getting this. No need in rushing out right away.",1231804800,,3658,4.32992700729927

But the results lived up to the hype. Many of the matches going in had good hype behind them and they all paid off pretty nicely.

No Holds Barred Match
Kane vs. Rey Mysterio
I was happy with the No Holds Barred stipulation being picked. A couple of good weapon use. Kane uses his size to wear down & counter Mysterio. Rey used a lot of his quickness to counter Kane. The match had a nice counter for the end. I enjoyed this match much as the opener. 4/5

Ecw World Championship
Evan Bourne vs. Matt Hardy
From the contenders for this match it seemed like Bourne was a shoe in but the results were actually pretty close. Bourne adds a lot of excitement to his matches & this was no exception. Hardy & Bourne uses some great & athlectic moneuvers. This was a susplended title match from Ecw in a very, very long time. 4.25/5

Cryme Tyme vs. John Morrison & The Miz
I guess the tag team title match didn't catch the voter's eye. But either way this tag bout delivered. Some nice teamwork & double teaming. Cryme Tyme did a good job of getting the crowd into the match. Morrison looked very good out there. This match didn't disappoint one bit. 3.75/5

Intercontinental Championship
Santino Marella w/ Beth Phoenix vs. Honky Tonk Man
Aww man, you saw this coming didn't ya. Nothing worth noting here. Huge let down & you knew it would be. It was good though to see Roddy Piper in good health & staying fit. 1/5

Last Man Standing Match
Undertaker vs. Big Show
A very good match up here between Show & the deadman. Some very good weapon use & brawling on the outside with a good table spot. The ref had a slip up & pretty much saved Taker at one point. But still a good match and one that will be enjoyed by many of you. 4.25/5

WWE Championship
Triple H vs. Jeff Hardy
Once again you saw this coming. After seeing a great match from these two at No Mercy I guess people wanted see an encore. And Hardy & Trips delivered another huge match up for the title. I actually enjoyed this match the same as their No Mercy encounter. A couple of good submissions & moves by Trips & solid unorthodox offense by Hardy. The last few moments was excellent & added more to the match. That counter into the pedigree from the top rope is a thing to see also. 4.5/5

World Heavyweight Championship w/ Stone Cold Steve Austin the Special Ref
Chris Jericho vs. Batista
I think whenever Stone Cold is the special referee, he adds so much more to the match. He also would add a special stipulation early on to the match. Jericho starts out by working on the injured leg of Batista & take away that powerful offense Batista possesses. The last few minutes of the match with Orton & HBK coming out made this match feel like a true main event. A solid match with an unexpecting finish. 4.25/5

3305629,3,B00120LPO2,"This was one of those PPVs where half of it is good and the other half is very forgettable.  There is plenty of entertainment to be found on this show, but when you add in all the bad aspects of it, it brings the rating down considerably.  Lets just get right into it, matches are rated out of 5 stars (*****).

1. Non-title Match
ECW Champion Matt Hardy vs. Vladimir Kozlov

Poor opener, but at least they got this over with first.  This wasn't as bad as it could have been, but this was no classic I assure you.  WWE gave the finish of the match away by making this a non-title match, and they obviously wanted to put Kozlov over.  Kozlov, in case you haven't noticed, is one of the most unimpressive workers currently in WWE.  This match didn't exactly do wonders for the prestige of the ECW Championship. *1/4

2. Intercontinental Championship Tournament Finals
Rey Mysterio vs. CM Punk

I was unimpressed with Mysterio in this match as he seemed very sloppy, but all things considered this was a helluva match.  Lots of great offense from Punk, and I was glad to see him go over.  Very enjoyable match, and the stiff GTS to end the match that broke Mysterio's nose (or at least came close) was pretty awesome.  ***1/2

We then got my goodness me a long promo from JBL and Shawn Michaels trying to explain this whole angle.  Best part of the segment came when fans started a small ""Joey Styles"" chant, which I loved.  This segment most definitely should have been on Raw, I am not a fan in the slightest of having these promos on PPV.  The promo was alright but WWE obviously had time they needed to kill

3. Belfast Brawl
Mark Henry vs. Finlay (w/ hornswoggle)

Nothing but weapons shots and a whole lot of uninteresting action.  This wasn't unwatchable and it was better than their previous encounters but this was not a good match.  Very reminiscent of the terrible hardcore title matches from the late '90s and early 2000s. *1/4

4. Batista vs. Randy Orton

This was a disapointment as I was expecting a lot more from this one.  This match really dragged in the early stages and Batista seemed quite lacking, but it picked up quite a bit at the end when both men started hitting all their moves.  At the end of the day this turned into a good match but it could have and should have (in my opinion) been much better.  **3/4

5. 8-Diva Santa's Little Helper Match
Maria, Kelly Kelly, Mickie James, & Michelle McCool
vs.
Maryse, Jillian Hall, Victoria, & Natalya

Does anyone care? Absolutely shocking match here.  I didn't have to go to the bathroom so I actually watched this match, which was indeed a mistake.  A cigarette break would have been a much better plan. However, I give this match one star simply because Michelle McCool did a Styles Clash to end the match.  *

After this disgraceful match we get a Khali kiss cam segment, which ended up involving Mae Young.  I will say nothing more.

6. World Heavyweight Championship Match
John Cena (c) vs. Chris Jericho

Real good match here, much better than their Survivor Series match.  I enjoyed the fact that it was kept relatively short for a title match (give or take 12 minutes), which allowed for mostly fast paced action.  This was a forgone conclusion match as no wrestling fan on earth thought Jericho would win, but it was still a great effort.  ***3/4

7. WWE Championship Match
Edge (c) vs. Triple H vs. Jeff Hardy

Very good match, match of the night, and I must say I was completely dumbfounded when Jeff won.  I did not see that coming at all, and to say I was surprised would be an understatement.  I'm still trying to decide whether or not I buy Jeff as WWE Champion, but I have to say it presents an interesting situation.  This match had a lot of great action including a great announce table spot, and the go home sequence was fantastic.  I definitely could have done without the Kozlov and Matt Hardy interference, as I feel it did nothing for the match, but this was still a great effort by all 3 men.  ****

So there you have it.  While there was definitely entertainment to be found on this show, and there were 3 very good matches, the rest is total garbage.  I would certainly not recommend purchasing this DVD, but rent this for the 3 good matches if you have nothing better to do on a weekend.",1229212800,6,4283,4.458762886597938

3305631,4,B00120LPO2,"WWE CYBER SUNDAY 2008 is a PPV that never becomes as great as it could've been, but it's a good one that's worth your time & money.  This is the fifth year that WWE has produced an ""interactive PPV""; I usually judge these events by how much does it feel like the fans actually had control over the night's turn-of-events.  If the Phoenix crowd's constant enthusiasm is any indication, then the WWE must've done something right:

_____________________________________________

1) No Holds Barred
Rey Mysterio v. Kane
---It's a good thing this one was booked as the opener, because it feels very similar to the other matches these two have had in the past few months.  Unfortunately, this was one of the weaker Kane/Mysterio outings.  The main problem is that it doesn't feel like a No Holds Barred Match!  Instead, I felt like I was watching a typical ""underdog-Rey"" match, with a few neat weapon spots toward the end.  It's not terrible, and does feature a few neat exchanges & counters.  But if it weren't for the Phoenix crowd's participation, I think I'd be even harsher.
""6.0 / 10""
_____________________________________________

***Throughout the evening, the Divas cut promos for their Halloween Contest.  Frankly, this is a half-good-half-bad deal.  Eight of the Divas look gorgeous, in spite of their embarassing promos.  And the other eight deserve bonus paychecks for looking as ridiculous as they did.***
_____________________________________________

2) ECW Championship
Matt Hardy (champion) v. Evan Bourne
---First off, big props to the WWE Universe for selecting the increasingly-exciting Bourne as the challenger.  Finlay would've been a worthy alternative, and hopefully WWE will notice that despite all attempts, Mark Henry will not cut it for much longer.  Bourne takes some stiff punches, and even harder slams.  But his variety of pinfalls attempts and takedowns give Hardy a run for his money.  What I noticed most was that the wrestlers worked their tails off to make each look good; you can see the hard work from start to finish.  If there's any doubt that Matt Hardy & Evan Bourne are the stars of the new ECW, then this will put out doubts to rest.  I don't think this is quite the Match-of-the-Year candidate most have made it out to be, but it's damn close, and certainly the best contest from CYBER SUNDAY 2008.  So sit back, I know you'll enjoy the ride.
""8.0 / 10""
_____________________________________________

3) Cryme Tyme v. John Morrison & The Miz
---Fans voted for this more than a World Tag Team Titles Match?  Hmm...that's a bit sad.  My basic reaction to this match was, ""What happened?""  I love Morrison & Miz, and Cryme Tyme are a combo with unusual offense.  And the crowd loves to hate and love (respectively) both of these teams.  But these four guys were just off.  Even though the crowd made a ton of noise for Cryme Tyme, it felt like a ""your-turn-my-turn"" tag match.  No psychology, and everything feels like a hot tag.  Like the opener, a passable match, but I think these guys could've done much better.
""6.0 / 10""
_____________________________________________

4) Intercontinental Championship
Santino Marella (champion) v. The Honky-Tonk Man
---I was shocked that even though Santino's IC Title run basically was to challenge Honky-Tonk Man's 15-month record as IC champ, Roddy Piper and Goldust almost got an equal percentage of votes.  Even more surprising was that Honky-Tonk Man moved quite well for his age.  Basic & old-school, more more believable than most retired legends' performances.  Sadly, after about 7 minutes of promos & smack-talk & comedy, the match was about 2 minutes tops.  And the aftermath involving all three potential challengers was a typical crowd-pleasing reunion.  Oh well, maybe this was just for fans of WWE's comedy.
""4.5 / 10""
_____________________________________________

5) Last Man Standing Match
The Undertaker v. Big Show
---I enjoyed this about as much as I have with most of the matches between these two wrestlers.  I'm satisfied, but not blown away.  The boxing-style slugfests between these two are very entertaining, and Big Show has been a solid in-ring performer since he returned earlier this year.  There are a couple of neat spots involving steel chairs, and the match is paced very well, as both men get to control the match for just the right amount of time.  It's too bad that this rivalry has been WAY overpushed, and Vickie Guerrero desperately needs to be removed from TV.  Another problem is that referee Charles Robinson makes a few slower counts because (apperantly) Undertaker took too long to get up.  Also, a couple of the match's key spots --- mainly an announcer table spot --- looked pretty weak.  Overall, the crowd (again) really got into this match, and I still enjoyed myself in spite of my nitpicks.
One more thing:
I'm VERY disappointed that the WWE edited out Vickie Guerrero's embarassing blooper, where she misread the fans' votes and announced an ""I Quit"" Match, and had to do a quick do-over.  Go to YouTube, and look up ""Botchamania 57"" to see it.

***Well, it's time to find out which of the 16 Divas won the Halloween Contest, as voted by the WWE fans.  Mickie James' dressup as Lara Croft is my favorite too.  Somehow, all the ladies end up in a random catfight, with the babyfaces survivng the scuffle.  I'm always amazed that these random Divas skirmishes end up with the ladies SMILING after they've just been in a ""FIGHT"".  Yeah...I'm thinking about this way too much.***

6) WWE Championship
Triple H (champion) v. Jeff Hardy
---Whoa!  This vote should indicate that Vladimir Kozlov's impressive physique hasn't gotten over with fans, yet.  Then again, Jeff Hardy's near-successes in championship matches have been pushed for almost a year.  As always, these two opponents have good chemistry, and tell compelling stories with their in-ring work.  I always look for new counters between longtime rivals, and I saw a few nice exchanges from both HHH & Jeff.  Like the ECW Title Match, neither man came out a loser when all was said & done.  I still prefer the NO MERCY matchup, because it felt more like either man could've won the match.  But this SMACKDOWN main event still made me believe that Jeff Hardy might...just might...come out on top.  This match was so good, that I ignored my head, and was able to enjoy just like everybody else will.
""7.5 / 10""
_____________________________________________

7) World Heavyweight Championship
Guest Referee - 'Stone Cold' Steve Austin
Chris Jericho (champion) v. Batista
---Boy, I was really worried about this one.  I already knew about the run-ins (more on those later), but also because of how this match began.  Jericho got the advantage that heels usually don't get until about halfway through a match.  After some initial cowardice from Y2J, he quickly went to work on Batista's leg, and was dominant for a good length of time.  The wrestling contest itself is solid, especially because Batista's improved a lot in the last year or two.  The physical match is better than most Jericho/Batista encounters (my favorite was actually on RAW back in June 2008).  But the real highlights are the interference.  I won't give away what happens when, but both Batista and Jericho get some assistance, and the atmosphere is chaotic.  Just when you think a run-in is going to end the main event, the downed opponent kicks out.  I usually don't like these kinds of finishes, but this time it worked so well.  Plus, it's always nice to see Steve Austin once in a while.  He's still the most popular performer in pro wrestling history - Period.
""8.0 / 10""
_____________________________________________

The DVD also includes the pre-show match that was shown on WWE.COM.  Shelton Benjamin defended the United States Championship against R-Truth (the fans' selected opponent).  I think the match itself is about 6 minutes, and isn't anything special.  R-Truth's offense is NOT innovative, and starting to really bore me.  Shelton is a marvelous athlete, who deserves better competition.  Overall, I give the bonus match:
""6.0 / 10""

CYBER SUNDAY 2008 doesn't meet its full potential, but it gets the job done.  The three brands' championship materials were different, and easily the best parts of the PPV.  They are the reason to buy the DVD.  The rest of the card is mildly entertaining.  I didn't vote this year because the WWE charged $0.99 for cellphone votes, so maybe those who paid to vote will get into this more than I did.  After all, the Phoenix crowd paid even more money for tickets, and definitely felt like they got their money's worth.

8243314,4,B00120LPO2,"The Rey Mysterio-Kane-No Holds Barred match was pretty good for a opener. The Matt Hardy-Evan Bourne-ECW title match was a high-flying,hard-hitting,entertaining showstealer. The Cryme Tyme-John Morrison/The Miz tag team match was a pretty good with alot of double-teaming to boot. The Santino Marella-Honky Tonk Man-IC title match was short but sweet. The Last Man Standing Match between The Undertaker & The Big Show was a solid,hard-hitting brawl. The HHH-Jeff Hardy-WWE title match was a back-and-forth,smash-mouth,high-flying bout and the same goes for the Batista-Chris Jericho-World's title match. I give this PPV a 8 out of 10.",1281312000,,634,5.684210526315789
8243315,5,B00120LPO2,"This is one of the best shows in 2008. The HHH-Edge-Jeff Hardy 3 way bout for the WWE title was a really satisfying main event and had a finish that WWE dared not to for very long time. The John Cena-Y2J match for the World's title while not as good as their bout from one month earlier,it was still a solid match. The eight woman Santa's little helper tag team match was cartoonish and a ""dud"" with Great Khali coming in and making it worse thus making it a ""Big Lipped Alligator Moment"" but the rest were still great. I give this supercard a 10 out of 10.",1278374400,,557,4.166666666666667
8243316,3,B00120LPO2,"ECW Champion Matt Hardy VS Vladmir Kozlov: I was surprised at how well this match went. Not a classic but still enjoyable with Kozlov pins Hardy in the end.

CM Punk VS Rey Mysterio: Intercontinental champion William Regal and Layla watches from ringside because this was a #1 contenders match. This was what you'd expect from these two-awesome. The last few minutes were great and the go to sleep was executed perfectly.

Shawn Michaels explains why JBL owns him. Fans didn't really care for this segement at all and could have been saved to be shown on Raw.

Mark Henry VS Finlay in a Belfast brawl: Damn I hate Hornswoggle, cant belive he is still employed while more talented wrestlers are getting cut or fired. Then again the same can be same for Mark Henry. This match just plain sucked as Hornswoggle assist Finlay in the win.

Charlie Haas is dressed as Santa to bring the divas a gift. Anther talented wrestler gone from WWE for no apparent reason. Santina comes in and brags about his Slammy award, picks a gift, and its the Boogeyman. Where the hell did he go? Then Santina opens a door and its Goldust under some miseltoe. Then a bunch of random jobbers sing We Wish You a Merry Christmas. Then Mr. Kennedy does a promo for his upcoming movie.

Batista VS Randy Orton: I hate Orton in this period, he was just so damn boring with an exciting finishing move. Cody Rhodes and Manu are at ringside, so that cannot be good. Orton throws Batista to the outside and Manu and Rhodes attacks him but instead of the usual disqualification, he sends them to the back. Very slow paced, boring match. Nothing i'd go out of the way to watch, considering it's been done several times since this.

Maria & Kelly Kelly & Mickie James & Michelle McCool VS Victoria & Natalya & Maryse & Jillian Hall: Sad to see someone as talented Victoria being reduced to stupid gimmick matches. I skipped over this like i've done with every other divas match.

John Cena VS Chris Jericho: Jericho does his best but Cena makes him tap in the end. Week by week, I hate Cena more and more. Not a bad match but hated the ending.

Edge VS Triple H VS Jeff Hardy: A very good triple threat match with Hardy finally winning the title he's been chasing for the year. I love the ending.

Overall, it was a mixed bag. Hardy/Triple H/Edge and CM Punk/Mysterio were the best matches and Cena-Jericho wasn't too bad but I hate Cena. I know Hardy's title win is on other dvds, so get those instead.",1276560000,,2465,4.484375

2. Final Match in the WWE Intercontinental Chamionship #1 Contender Tournament: Rey Mysterio vs CM Punk
These two high-flyers put on a great match. Lots of action. 4/5

3. Belfast Brawl: Finlay vs Mark Henry I didn't really like this match. It wasn't much of a brawl. 3/5

4. Batista vs Randy Orton This could have been the match of the night. GREAT MATCH! 5/5

5. Santa's Little Helper Tag Team Match: Michelle McCool, Mickie James, Kelly Kelly, and Maria vs Maryse, Natalya, Jillian, and Victoria Just a Divas match, nothing to it. 2/5

7. Triple Threat Match for the WWE Championship: Edge vs Triple H vs Jeff Hardy Awesome match! Hardy finally wins his first WWE Title. 5/5!

8243318,3,B00120LPO2,"No Holds Barred Match: Rey Mysterio vs. Kane - This was just like their No Mercy match in that it was ""David vs. Goliath"" with Mysterio getting some good offense in & being was able to hold his own against Kane here with various weapons like a stop sign, kendo stick, and a chair being used at one point.

ECW Champion Matt Hardy vs. Evan Bourne - Thsi was a very athletic contest here as it was Matt Hardy showcasing his inring psychology throughout the match by focusing on Bourne's back & ribs and even getting a little stiff at times with his slams & kicks while Evan showcased a flashier offense with his high flyin'.  This was one of those matches where regardless of who gets the victory, both men come out strong.

Cryme Tyme vs. John Morrison & The Miz - The battle of WWE website shows ""Word Up"" vs. ""The Dirt Sheet"" here as the fans voted for this one over the mixed tag (understandable) & the World Tag Team Title Match (didn't see that one coming).  This was an average match between both teams that was good but nothing really special.

Intercontinental Champion Santino Marella vs. Honky Tonk Man - This was the payoff for Santino's ""Honk-A-Meter"" he's been using ever since he won the I.C. belt.  All I'll say here is that this ""match"" was just like anything involving Santino Marella, it's just here for comedic purposes only as the match itself was so weak...it's not worth me trying to describe it.  The only good thing was getting to see the Honky Tonk Man on TV for the first time in several years.

Last Man Standing Match: Undertaker vs. Big Show - This was one of those matches that started off real slow as both men tried wrestling a ""striker/MMA"" boxing style match by using calculated punches but picked up after a while when they used the stipulation to their advantage by fighting on the outside and using weapons like a chair & the announce table.  However, one thing that you can't help but notice were times where Charles Robinson was heavily slowing down & even stalling his final 10 count.  Taker is one of the people who can bring out the best in the Big Show but the only real problem with this one was that the rematch took place too soon after their No Mercy match & they didn't top it here.

Throughout the night, you saw backstage promos of the WWE Divas in their Halloween Costumes so right here you saw them all in the ring while they announce the winner before the obivious catfight between the girls.

WWE Champion Triple H vs. Jeff Hardy - I quoted Jim Ross on their No Mercy match in that it was ""one of the most competitve WWE Title matches..."" and this match was no different as far as the inring work as Triple H is the one guy who can give Jeff Hardy the best straight WRESTLING matches in his career.  However, this match wasn't as intense as the previous months and I think this match was missing that big match build since this one was built about Kozlov destroying both men for weeks only for him to not be voted in at all.  Great match but, just like Show/Taker earlier, they're rematch didn't top the one they had only weeks earlier as it was lacking certain things.

World Champion Chris Jericho vs. Batista with Stone Cold Steve Austin as the referee - Unfortunally, this was one of those matches where you knew what was going to happen before the PPV and everything that happened during the PPV confirmed it.  Everyone should have known that Steve Austin was going to be voted in as the guest referee (which he was) and that would right away stack the odds against Jericho (which was being put over with his backstage skits throughout the night) & that was made perfectly clear in the opening minutes of the match when Austin made the stipulation that Jericho could lose his title on a DQ or countout.  The match itself was good between the two with Batista putting in a good performance while Jericho does what he does best in the ring both as a wrestler & character.  The ending had run-ins from J.B.L., Orton, Shawn Michaels and Austin giving the stunner that everyone always pops for.  It was a good match for what it was but the problem was that you knew exactly what was going to happen going into it.

Bonus Match: United States Champion Shelton Benjamin vs. R-Truth - This was originally on WWE's website as a preview match for the PPV but made it's was the DVD as a bonus extra.  The match itself was nothing noteworthy as it was short but a good match for the short time given.

The only other DVD extra on here was Roddy Piper, Honky Tonk Man, and Goldust backstage debating on who was the greatest Intercontinental Champion of all time.  In the end, this was the best Cyber Sunday they've had next to the 2005 edition as there really wasn't a bad match on here (unless you count the Santino segment) with the only fallback being that if you've seen No Mercy than the rematches would come off as almost identical with a few minor changed that either helped or hurt the match depending on your point of view.  In the end, if you already have a copy of the previous No Mercy then you can go ahead & skip this one unless you really want to see the ECW & World Title matches (and the appearences of Austin, Piper, and Honky) then go ahead & pick this one up.",1242604800,2,5224,4.41207075962539
