5026345,1,B006WY0UPS,"Substantial misrepresentation by the seller! This DVD does NOT include ""Birth of a Legend"" as listed here!  I've seen small clips of ""Birth of a Legend"" and loved the wonderful CGI work there - such as the sequences of Titanic on her sea trials - and was so excited to see that it was to finally be available on DVD and immediately ordered it. How excited I was to have this arrive early. And what a complete and thorough disappointment to see that I didn't get what was advertised. The DVD is a compilation of re-enactments titled: 1)Curiosity - What Sank Titanic, 1) Titanic - The Investigation Begins, and 3) Last Mysteries of the Titanic. It is going back for a refund.",1333411200,39,673,4.516393442622951
5026346,5,B006WY0UPS,"Hello,
At last we can all view a fantastic movie about this Great Ship that not only dwells deeply into how this vessel was constructed, but also as to exactly what the 15,000 workers who built her had to endure while doing so in the early 1900's.
Thank you.",1328918400,15,258,4.285714285714286
5026347,5,B006WY0UPS,I purchased this item for a Titanic collector and he was thrilled with the gift.  It was all I had hoped it would be.,1359849600,4,117,3.875
5026348,5,B006WY0UPS,Excellent resource for Titanic buffs.  Good value for the money and very educational.  I enjoyed this book very very much.,1359504000,3,122,5.05
5026349,3,B006WY0UPS,Could have been a lot better for being 100 year anniverrsary. A lttle disapointed.  Kind of a slap in the face like it has already been forgotten.,1351987200,,146,4.407407407407407
5026350,5,B006WY0UPS,"Wow! This fantastic exploration of this famous ship is breath taking to say the least. As the remote controlled vessel enters into chambers of Titanic, piloted remotely by men in a special vessel deep in the depths near by, you are treated to never before sights that had been recreated by the directors of the Titanic movie in almost eerie replication. From the special ""sketch"" cabin with its clock on the mantel and the Middle Eastern style sauna and its unique tiles to the introduction of a new mystery one will be mezmerized as this CD takes you on its journey and reveals many of Titanic's secrets. I surprised my daughter with this CD and a special blue stone recreated by Stauer.",1339977600,3,688,4.647540983606557
5026351,5,B006WY0UPS,"This is another excellent DVD on the Titanic on the 100th anniversary. I saw this on the Discovery channel and thought it was well done. This DVD also contains some previous documentaries presented by the Discovery Channel on the Titanic, which are also very good. I would recommend it to anybody who wants to add to their Titanic collection.",1337558400,5,342,4.813559322033898
5026352,5,B006WY0UPS,Although I've not had time to view this CD I did use it in my display honoring the memory of the RMS Titanic.  It's hard to imagine anything so devistating.,1335744000,2,156,4.2
5026353,1,B006WY0UPS,"I was really looking forward to seeing Titanic - birth of a legend again. It was first screened on British TV but not repeated, and is not available on UK format DVDs so I was thrilled when I spotted it on Amazon.com. Like other reviewers it came as a great disappointment to discover that this excellent documentary drama is not included despite information to the contrary. I am returning my DVD as this was my sole reason for purchase. Another time I'll wait for the first reviews to appear before ordering.",1334707200,8,510,4.615384615384615
5026354,1,B006WY0UPS,"Just watched a portion of this DVD. Seems there is a lot of revisionism passing as fact here. The first episode is supposedly based on survivor's accounts at the Board of Inquiry hearings but no one has mentioned Andrews, the ship's designer, who advised the Captain the ship was damaged to the point of sinking. The few passenger accounts seem to be one gigolo with his mistress, one servant girl soaking in a tub, while the crew consisted of the Captain, Bruce Ismay ,  and a few stokers, engineers, and another fella who cut his own foot off. I'll keep the DVD for grins, but if you're looking for a valid account of the tragedy, I wouldn't get this show.",1333756800,27,658,4.483333333333333
5026355,1,B006WY0UPS,"Like a prior review, if you're expecting Titanic: Birth of a Legend, forget it! It ain't here! The only reason i ordered this was for Birth of a Legend.  Amazon will not accept a refund despite this blatant misrepresentation.",1333670400,26,225,4.769230769230769
5026356,3,B006WY0UPS,"Like a prior review, if you're expecting Titanic:  Birth of a Legend, forget it!  It ain't here!  Amazon needs to act faster than they usually do in these matters, and get an accurate description of the video content, posted, pronto!  The DVD does contain the nice reenactment, with great CGI,  ""Curiosity: What Sank Titanic?"".  But, this would have been a great DVD if it had "" Titanic: Birth of a Legend"", also. Clearly, a missed opportunity!  The second and third programs: ""Titanic: The Investigation Begins"" and ""Last Mysteries of the Titanic"", are ok, but, if it were not for the very good first program, ""Curiosity: What sank Titanic?"", I would have sent it back for a refund.  That program, alone, if you can't find it anywhere else, is still worth the price of admission.  It doesn't matter whether the program description error lies with the DVD producer, distributor, or with Amazon, it needs to get corrected!",1333670400,9,921,4.852564102564102

8505967,3,B006WY0UPS,"I have always been fascinated with the Titanic, and have done much research. I love watching documentaries about it, so when I saw this for only five dollars, I bought it. I also saw that it included a documentary with James Cameron that I had been really wanting to see but couldn't find on the internet. Unfortunately, it was only a portion of the real thing. The other documentaries didn't even look interesting, and I wondered if they were whole thing either. I guess it was a good purchase for five dollars, but I was slightly disappointed that it only included some of the documentary I was looking for.",1390608000,,609,4.5963302752293576
