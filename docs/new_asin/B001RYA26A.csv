3782999,1,B001RYA26A,"I own D & G, season 1, for USA DVDs. Who in his or her right mind would buy the grossly overpriced season two which won't play on US DVDs? Chuck Lorrie is as batty as his friend Charlie Sheen and obviously is too rich from his audience to care about them. Or maybe withholding the subsequent seasons on DVD is another of his cute endnotes about his twisted beliefs. Too bad for Jenna and Thomas, who really did a great for Chuck.",1336867200,4,429,4.180722891566265

3783055,5,B001RYA26A,"The first season of D&G was fun and witty. The second season is where the show hit its stride.

3783067,4,B001RYA26A,"Dharma & Greg is a terrific show, and is much overlooked and underrated, I think.

My biggest complaint, although it is not a huge one, is that the set came on DVD-R discs, and not pressed discs.  Granted, I did know that the set was a 'Manufactured on Demand' product, but I did not really expect it would be DVD-R media.

Yes, the show plays just fine on my DVD player.  Yes, the video quality is good, but the overall look and feel of the set leaves a little to be desired.  I'll keep it, and it wasn't terribly expensive, but it was not quite what I expected.",1428624000,10,563,4.175925925925926

3783073,5,B001RYA26A,"One of my favorites. It's well worth the wait. Jenna Elfman shines but it's the entire cast and crew that made the show so special. A very smart and heartwarming comedy. Was a bit surprised that there are no special features. I also hope the next seasons are released much sooner. And, don't give it one star because of technical difficulties. It deserves better.",1425340800,3,363,4.6875

3783101,5,B001RYA26A,"I've been waiting patiently for years and that day has came.  I'm very thankful that Amazon has brought the second season of this amazingly humorous show to DVD.
The manufacture on demand process doesn't diminish from expected quality.  It looks like any tv show purchase you would buy, case and all.(Note attached photos.) True fans of this beloved show will not be disappointed.
My only hope is that the remaining seasons will be released as well.",1416614400,51,449,4.894736842105263
3783102,5,B001RYA26A,"D&G was the happiest show on TV and my very favorite from the 1990's. I have had people -- friends even -- imply that I ought to consider this a 'guilty pleasure,' but I don't feel guilty about loving it at all. It is sweet and silly, and the writing is snappy and funny. I laugh out loud so often, even revisiting these old episodes. You really cannot ask for more from a weekly escape from reality.

Dharma Finkelstein and Greg Montgomery: not only the best-looking couple ever assembled in the sit-com labs, but also the most innately charming.  If you have never seen the show, the premise is this: Dharma is a happy-go-lucky, new-agey chick raised by hippie parents in that part of San Francisco; Greg is a lawyer in the Justice Dept. from an old-money family in that part of San Francisco; they meet on BART and get married on that same day.  Chaos and hilarity ensue. While the two sets of parents and their culture and values clashes are certainly amusing, it is the chemistry and joy that the two stars (Jenna Elfman and Thomas Gibson) bring to their characters that just made this show must-see TV for me from the get-go.  Dharma was created, as was revealed in interviews on the first season's DVD set, to be the antidote for the unhappy, tightly-wound career woman of the 1990's who was miserable in her personal life.  They wanted to make a character who was simply happy with who she was, absolutely in love, and able to spread delightful sunshine to everyone in her day-to-day life.  I think they succeeded.  And Greg was the perfect complement.

Season 2 continues the fun with many classic episodes and plenty of Jane and Pete to round out the quirky awesome.

I cannot say how grateful I am to Amazon for figuring out a way to get Season 2 on DVD out for us in the US.  I hope all the other seasons follow soon.",1416441600,21,1829,4.465465465465465
3783103,1,B001RYA26A,Great show  another Lorre production canceled early.  But heres the rub.  Only season 1 has been put out.  The stuff from overseas is all rip off.  Dont blame Loree this is the studio.  It makes no sense to anyone but them in Hollyweird.  So many people buy season one and cant get two or  three or even  a box set  is s***.  but  for $120 coming from overseas you can buy it.  This has been cancelled for 10 years  and that fact that you cant get dvd of it  is  a travesty.  You can buy this on amazon streaming  but I want the DVD .  there alot of shows like this  another one  is  Better Off Ted  released first  season but won't release second season and its going on 6 years.  Whats the point.  not going into sydication  let us buy the Seasons on DVD,1409011200,3,756,4.0344827586206895
3783104,1,B001RYA26A,"I did not notice the warning that these DVDs will not play on US players (so that is my fault), but what they did not tell you is that it is also in GERMAN. You have to look very closely at the picture that goes with this to see that the word ""Season"" is actually in German, as is most of the verbiage on all of the packaging (except for titles). But nowhere in the description of this product is that important fact shared.",1398902400,4,424,4.059523809523809
