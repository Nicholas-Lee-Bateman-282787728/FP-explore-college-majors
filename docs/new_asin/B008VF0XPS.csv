IT'S ALL GOOD",1356480000,,123,4.391304347826087
5185034,2,B008VF0XPS,"I've seen many Warren Miller videos. This is the 3rd I've bought. It is not Warren Miller. Jonny, you do a good job. But what I love about these videos is Warren's perspective. His commentary. His voice. Warren isn't in this video at all. It's all fluff. The title is inspiring...and it's true. But if you want Warren Miller videos, get the older versions.",1354924800,3,356,4.578125
5185035,3,B008VF0XPS,"I really liked last year's film Wintervention, but this one isn't really very interesting. The visuals, narration, and dialogue just didn't hold my interest because they are not very good. This one is probably only for Warren Miller Films enthusiasts only.",1353801600,,256,5.2682926829268295

8530854,3,B008VF0XPS,"I've never watched a Warren Miller movie previously and there was some cool footage, but some of it was goofy, tacky music and narration was awful.",1398556800,,147,4.6923076923076925
8530855,2,B008VF0XPS,Didn't care for it. His older films were more interesting and exciting. More culture and facts about the area they were skiing. The narration was not as enthusiastic about the sport.,1385683200,,182,4.903225806451613
8530856,5,B008VF0XPS,Great purchase.  Skiing and riding in the typical Warren Miller style.  Narration by Moosle is good.  Music is awesome.  Camera work is beyond awesome!  Places are awesome.  Cool stuFF!  Shred on!!,1382400000,,197,5.161290322580645
