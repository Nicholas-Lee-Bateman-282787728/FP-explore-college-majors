I would definitely recommend this Blu ray to anyone who likes Heart.",1397088000,,208,4.097560975609756
6131688,2,B00H4BVY3K,"The dvd itself is ok but not one of the best of all of the many dvd's they issued in the passed. The main complaint is the sound quality! On all of the songs, the sound quality recording is below par. The television broadcast sounded better! That should not be the case. Whoever produced this dvd didn't have a clue what they were doing....",1396915200,5,340,4.328125
6131689,5,B00H4BVY3K,"I've been a Heart fan forever.  The Wilson sisters are always awesome, and they still got it!!  Rock on ladies!!",1396483200,,112,4.55
6131690,5,B00H4BVY3K,"The blu-ray comes the closest to actually experiencing the energy & musicality of seeing Heart live. Ann & Nancy have always been amazing live, and they've gotten even better with age - and this concert shows it. The only thing I found strange about this disc is the fact that the performance of the song ""Magic Man"" is included as a bonus feature rather than being included in the full concert. This is a must-have for any real Heart fan.",1395619200,,439,4.5
6131691,3,B00H4BVY3K,"Ann and Nancy (and the band) were great, as per their usual, but this was not the best concert DVD/Blu-Ray.  There's no way this was the whole show.  The tracks all fade to black in between so the show is not contiguous, it appears to have even been rearranged with several tracks left out.  Ann was interrupted (cut completely off) while talking at least twice to rush off to the next random track.  THEN to toss ""Magic Man"" in as a bonus instead of just leaving it in the show, where it belonged... sloppy.  The sound seemed to change between tracks as well (loudness, clarity, etc..) making it feel more like watching a random series of videos instead of the ""FANATIC"" concert I paid for.  I'm now hoping for a DVD/BLU-RAY release of the ""Heartbreaker Tour"" that has not been massacred as this one was.  A DTS track would have been nice-the only audio options are Dolby-5.1 or PCM.

I hate giving Heart less than 5 stars for anything, so shame on whoever put this together.  It is not pleasurable to watch as a whole concert because it, clearly, is not.  I had guests over to watch the show and it was quite a letdown.  I should have previewed it an invited people over for ""Heart clips"".  This should have been epic.

If you love Heart, definitely buy it.  Just don't expect ""a concert"", just a bunch of clips with no flow.",1394236800,29,1327,4.429752066115703
6131692,3,B00H4BVY3K,"Hi Folks,
I LOVE Heart, have since they first shook up the established male driven rock world.  I also own all their DVDs and BR discs and have seen them many times.  This looked to be another interesting addition to their growing catalog but goodness at 1 hour and 11 minutes it's Heartly .. er hardly a whole show is it?  The ""Bonus Feature"" is ""Magic Man"" ... why not just include it in the concert and make it a cool 1 hour and 15 minutes of music?  Of course these gals are getting up in age but they still routinely put on 2 hour plus sets ... so why all this production value and pages of credits in the booklets and release half a show?  My guess is this is from a TV production ... but I've purchased many other BR discs that were done for TV/Cable and they often on the BR put all the songs not broadcast but filmed .... just  a thought ladies.
I agree with the other reviewer who found the sound a bit less than expected as well and the set chosen to put on BR included more ballads than I'd prefer.  I'd also say the string ensemble backing them on some songs , didn't add anything for me and in fact lessened the songs impact....
I'm glad to have this as a long time fan but it isn't terrific as it could have been and as these Hall of Famers deserve.",1394150400,3,1264,4.07258064516129
6131693,3,B00H4BVY3K,"I waited a long time to get this DVD and made the assumption this Blu-Ray would be a top rate production delivering 7.1 True HD.
It was not. It is delivers a mere 5.1 Dolby or PCM. The video is okay with at least one drop out. Nancy's acoustic isn't wired properly in one song and only gets picked up by her mike. Again it was only one song. I had just seen the sisters Wilson in Houston (Woodlands Pavilion) in the fall and was blown away. So maybe my expectations were a little too high. I do like Ann's mature voice over her youthful voice of yesteryear. She never sounded better than she does today. I would still pick this one up for your collection. Who wouldn't want to come over and watch Heart? They are true icons. Pure American rock royalty. I only wish they and their producers had made some better choices. And I'm not talking set and lighting. I am merely suggesting the video and most definitely the audio could have been more worthy of these Superstars. I think the price drop was called for. It doesn't sound bad. It's just mediocre 5.1 audio. Song selection is very good. I even enjoyed the new releases. I hope before they hang it up, they can give us a high quality DVD before I take the stairway to heaven. Which, by the way was omitted from this songlist.",1394064000,13,1277,4.325

8629774,5,B00H4BVY3K,Here is powerful proof that Ann's voice is as powerful and rich and varied as ever.  The band Heart has been fueled by the genius of these two sisters for nearly 40 years.,1407283200,,171,4.181818181818182

8629776,5,B00H4BVY3K,"NICE!  I have been a true Heart fan since day one and obviously still am. This concert ranks as a testament to their continued endurance and still untapped reservoir of talent. I've seen them live, in concert more than a dozen times and they never, ever disappoint.  I'm jealous of the energy Nancy displays and am amazed at the music her hands create. Anne's voice hasn't lost a decibel and still resonates to the bone. The Wilson sisters have always and will always be the titans of rock, and the world is a better place for it.  This concert features mostly material from their latest release and is delivered with the same passion and intensity that we've come to enjoy so much. I watch it at least once a week and has moved to the #1 position in my concert video collection.  No defibrillator needed here!",1400457600,,810,4.527397260273973

8629779,5,B00H4BVY3K,"Excellent Concert. I love the rendition of the song Alone. They did a lot of songs from The Fanatic album, some could have been left off. But I still love this concert. Bonus track was Magic Man. If your a Heart fan, Then you need this Blu-Ray.",1398124800,2,244,4.212765957446808
