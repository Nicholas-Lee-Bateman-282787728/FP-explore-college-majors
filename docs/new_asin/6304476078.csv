7872255,5,6304476078,"I would like to give praise to ""Zebra: Patterns in the Grass"" nature documentary. The footage shot in Northern Botswana by husband and wife, Derek and Beverly Joubert, is an example of a mature work. It describes the 300-mile zebra migration from Lynianti region to Savuti and back. The documentary focuses on all expects of zebra's life, the birth, herd structure and individual zebra status within a family group, migration difficulties, stallion responsibilities and interactions with others, relationship of a mother and a foul and death.  The amazing footage combined with excellent narration really creates an interesting drama of zebra's life set in and around the ancient migration routes in this beautiful but unforgiving region. We experience the crucial first hours of a newly born zebra foul during which the mother tries to hide from her new baby any other zebra's form but her own in order to imprint her unique stripe pattern, which will play the most important part in identifying the mother. This behavior cannot guarantee the survival of the foul since there are many other dangers in the young foul's life, such as high mortality rate from such predators as hyenas and lions, which abound in Savuti march. We are present on numerous hunts of these striped horses by the lions, the pressure of which finally push the zebra herds to move on from Savuti. On route to Lynianti there are nomadic lions following the herds in hope of a meal, as well as men who are in pursuit of the zebra's skin leaving the rest to the scavengers. In the midst of this we experience the drama of everyday life in the zebra society including the great footage of the stallions fight for a mare. The Jouberts manage to bring a viewer a world hidden from the eyes of humans. The story almost makes a viewer to experience the sights and smells of wild Africa while conveying a powerful message about our impact on the natural world in that wild place. It is one of the best nature documentaries to date and I recommend this video to anyone interested in wildlife. It has great footage as well as great story. Great job Derek and Beverly! Definitely worth five stars!",977184000,10,2159,4.7882037533512065
