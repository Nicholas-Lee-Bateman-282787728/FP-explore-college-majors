8480911,5,B005O30W2O,"Winning BIG! is the result of about a year of filming on and off with the great Debbie Bramwell. Both Erika and I used to have our hair cut by Debbie, and it was around January 2007 when Debbie mentioned to me that she was trying out for a pro card in Pittsburgh, and we agreed on filming her during her training and through to the tournament. Getting up at 5:00am in time to film her training sessions was probably the hardest thing I had to do. The people at the World Gym and Derrick Farnsworth, were great, as were all the promoters in allowing us to film Debbie. I think the video tells a rounded story of Debbie's hard work to get to the finals - we hope you like it.",1316476800,2,673,4.106060606060606
