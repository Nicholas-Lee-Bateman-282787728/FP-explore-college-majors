Holly hunter's genuine enthusiasm and awe at her experience with the Cheetahs as well as her obvious respect of these animals was lovely and  extremely touching. When at the end she plays a part in freeing the  chettah, she breaks down, I felt as though I was there with her and could  understand the breadth of emotion that she must have been feeling. This is  a wildlife special that not only teaches but makes you feel as well.",915580800,12,506,4.467391304347826

7789615,4,0780618106,It was more interesting than usual because of the background of what lions have signified in the human world for centuries. Awesome shots close up and real reactions by both Sir Hopkins and his travel companions.,1386288000,,212,4.916666666666667
7789616,5,0780618106,"I really enjoyed this video.  The scene with Whoopi and the baby chimp is worth the price of the video alone!  Even she had trouble holding back the tears.  The only disadvantages are that this is not offered in DVD format and it's not that long--about an hour.  Whoopi is as funny as ever, and if you like her, you'll like the video.",1236297600,,334,4.253968253968254
7789617,3,0780618106,"If you are interested in learning about orangutans, there are a LOT better choices out there.  The film is about Julia Roberts's month-long experience with orangutans, as seen by Julia Roberts, who left the comfortable surroundings normally enjoyed by Julia Roberts.  Do we really need the montage of Julia leaving NYC, with multiple art-school close-ups/silhouettes?  Or so much focus on her Hepburnesque boat making its way up the river?

Still, orangutans being what they are, there is footage to commend this effort.  Seeing the orangutan empty a flooded canoe to make its way across the river and help scrub clothes is genuinely touching.  The closing scene is a piece of real life that is understandably upsetting to Ms. Roberts, who manages a short debriefing of the moment, but is clearly, as she puts it, ""freaked out"".  Then the piece stops--no montage of Julia's boat returning, no more pseudo-spiritual paens from Julia to the orangutans, no shots back in the 'jungle' of NYC.

It would have been very helpful to have someone who knows about orangutans put the experience into context.  As it is, given the abrupt ending, you get left with the impression that following this experience, Ms. Roberts's cooperation with the show ended.

If your attraction to this video is Julia Roberts, you should definitely watch.  If it's more the orangs, look elsewhere.",1215302400,,1368,5.0625
7789618,4,0780618106,"This would be indistinguishable from any random episode of ""Nova"" or ""Nature"" without the stardust sprinkled over the proceedings by the elfin Academy Award [registered trademark!] winner who - as it happened - was the only reason I sought this out in the first place. Consequently, I think I may have learned more about ""actress hollywoodus"" than ""felidae acinonyx"". Ms. Hunter shamelessly twinkles, dramatizes, flirts, and broods - effortlessly capturing the center of attention, whatever the situation. In a word: she's a star - even in the incongruous setting of Africa, whose film associations provide her with one wisecrack that made me burst out laughing. Having spent the night sleeping on open ground in pursuit of the documentary crew's fleet quarry, she sighs over the dishevelled state of her hair and laments in voice-over, ""How come this never happened to Meryl Streep?""",1076976000,,884,5.232394366197183
7789619,4,0780618106,"This is quite an entertaining and educational video - the reviewer above is quite correct in saying that some parts are difficult to watch, but they are not arbitrarily thrown it. Viewers are confronted with images which illustrate the many ways in which species face eradication due to poachers and hunters. It underscores the need for the conservation efforts such as those of the San Diego Zoo, whose work is highlighted here. Whoopi is fun, but the video is not ""funny"" - and it is definately NOT for young impressionable viewers. Great for middle school and up.",1074643200,,566,4.845360824742268
7789620,1,0780618106,"I purchased this video because my young grandchildren wanted a video on baby animals at the zoo.  I was horrified when my 6 yr. old granddaughter was watching it (I wasn't paying close attention) and said that a part was so sad.  I rewound it, and much to my horror, they showed the killing of baby chimps in some third world country.  this was not exactly what I had in mind!!!",1025827200,3,378,4.295774647887324
7789621,1,0780618106,"We get to see more Julia than orangutan.  We did not hear a lot from those who devote their time to  saving the orphaned babies in the wilderness.  We  watch as Julia castes shallow indifference to local people who tell her of  orangutan attacks on women.  Then at the end Julia places herself and the  lives of local workers in danger. Insisting she must meet a male orangutan  who is by nature unsocial, the event is arranged.  After she repeatedly  calls to the male who is ignoring her he begins advancing.  Julia ignores  her sense that a 400 lb wild animal is a dominant creature and stays to  talk.  Next the male grabs her by the arm and begins to place her in the  mating position.  Men are seen intervening as this huge animal is obviously  turning to make a stand.  The tape is cut and Julia assures us everyone  including the orangutan is ok and she is thrilled.  A good reason she  should have stayed home.  I can't believe this was ever published, it  certainly makes me reluctant and more cautious about buying any other PBS  'home' movies.  I surprised anyone outside her family would be interested.",941068800,9,1115,4.51010101010101
