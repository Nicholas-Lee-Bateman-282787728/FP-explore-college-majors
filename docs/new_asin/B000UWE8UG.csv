8215311,5,B000UWE8UG,"This USIS 1948 ""propaganda"" film is itself a work of art by Willard Van Dyke, a great documentarian of his time. Although perhaps a bit ""corny"" by contemporary standards, and lacking a bit in political correctness (referring to ""man"" instead of ""person""), it portrays Weston's role in the history of fine art photography. Made shortly before his career was curtailed by Parkinson's, the film shows him at work in his California environment and contains many useful aesthetic and technical references for further discussion.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-PHOTOGRAPHER-1948/dp/B000UWE8UG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE PHOTOGRAPHER, 1948</a>",1250899200,,688,6.829545454545454
