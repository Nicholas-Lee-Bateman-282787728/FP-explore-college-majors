8100761,4,B000CQQIEO,"Jim Brickman is always good to listen to and when I found this I thought perfect!  Most of the songs were great.  Not all of them are Disney.  The way I read the description, I was led to believe we would be shown around Disney World.  You see Cinderella's castle and that's it.  It was good.  I was just expecting more of Disney World.",1357171200,,336,4.171875
8100762,5,B000CQQIEO,My wife and I attended the taping of the show at Disney World in Orlando Florida. It took two nights to complete the taping. We enjoyed both nights. And the DVD of this program is Fantastic.  If you enjoy Jim Brickman and Disney Music you need to get this DVD.,1180483200,3,260,4.2
