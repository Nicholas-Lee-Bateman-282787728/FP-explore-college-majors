8680934,5,B00NXAA2RK,"This is one cool gripping thriller that keeps you pulled in with a great story and interesting characters, the story is about a man who one night shoots an intruder in his home, he then later discovers it may not be what it seemed as he gets caught up in police corruption and violence, he must do what he must do to protect his family and find out the truth! The movie is well paced and keeps you interested with new twists and turns in the story, the cast is brilliant, Michael C. Hall, Sam Shepard and Don Johnson are great actors, the movie is set in the 80's too which is one of the things I loved most about it, the 80's style soundtrack is awesome especially music by Dynatron, this is really worth checking out if you like a good easy going thriller with a good story and cast, one of the coolest little movies of 2014.

The steelbook is very cool if your a collector, the picture is done in an 80's style VHS cover, with the tape inside cover and retro looking VHS stickers designs for the logos.
Blu-ray picture is great quality, Region B, 1hr-50mins, features include trailer and deleted scenes.",1419379200,,1106,4.368932038834951
