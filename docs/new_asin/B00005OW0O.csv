7949256,3,B00005OW0O,"This DVD contains an early Pride event, PrideFC 3. Obviously, MMA has evolved quite a bit since this event over 10 years ago. And this era of MMA, sometimes referred to as NHB(No Holds Barred) back then, had already done a big metamorphasis since the UFC debuted in 1993.

For this particular event, most matches are ok except for Sakuraba/Newton, which is quite a scientific display of smooth groundwork. Bas Rutten is on commentary along with ""The Fight Professor"".

Although the whole Pride organization no longer exist, you can still enjoy its legacy through DVD's such as these. In fact, rather than getting this DVD, I would recommend getting the Pride Legacy Vol 1 box set which contains Pride 1-5.",1230854400,,705,4.866666666666666
7949257,4,B00005OW0O,"Only get this DVD if you appreciate ground fighting. The Sakuraba fight is amazing. the skill that him and Newton display on the mat is ridiculous. The rest of the fight card is quite boring. If you have the money to spend on this DVD, than you will be treated to one of the most entertaining grappling matches in PRIDE history.",1070841600,,328,4.39344262295082
7949258,4,B00005OW0O,"Pride 3 was on June 24, 1998 at the Nippon Budokan
The first fight is between Lumax Cup 1997 and Pride veteran Akira Shoji and in his MMA (Mixed Martial Arts) debut Daijiro Matsui. This was a great fight and I would like to see a rematch.
The second fight is between UFC 3 veteran Emmanuel Yarborough and in his MMA debut Daiju Takase. Terrible fight but the ending is good.
The third fight is between UFC Japan Tournament winner and Pride veteran Kazushi Sakuraba and Extreme Fighting 2, Japan Vale Tudo and UFC 17 veteran Carlos Newton. This is the best fight of the show.
The fourth fight is between UFC 8 finalist and IVC 1 Tournament winner Gary Goodridge and in his MMA debut Amir Rahnavardi. Good and brutal fight.
The fifth fight is between UFC 14 and 15 heavyweight tournament winner and WVC 3 tournament winner Mark Kerr and International Vale Tudo Championship and Universal Vale Tudo veteran Pedro Otavio. Ok fight but this was mismatch.
The main event is between Pride 1 veteran Nobuhiko Takada and in his MMA debut Kyle Sturgeon. Short fight but decent.
I recommend for who like Pride.",1007424000,8,1099,4.612244897959184
