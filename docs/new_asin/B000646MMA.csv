2165391,5,B000646MMA,"I am a swing voter and I anticipated that this movie would help me better understand John Kerry as a person and as a leader.  It did both and much much more.  Clearly, he is a brave and heroic man for having volunteered to serve his country during war and then to oppose it after returning home and listening to many other vets, that something was dramatically wrong with the U.S.'s position.  With our 20/20 hindsight, we now know many things were wrong with the US's involvement in Vietnam but he had the courage and insight to see it then!!! as a 27 year old!!!  He knew standing against the war would be a potential problem with his political aspirations and he did it anyway because he felt it was the right thing to do.  If this doesn't stand in stark contrast to the draft dodging of the so-called leaders in the White House now, you obviously are someone who cannot face the facts.

Although born to a certain level of status, he served with men from all backgrounds and won their respect.  He has certainly won my respect and my vote and I highly encourage people to see this movie to learn the context of Kerry's background and to watch an excellent documentary of a very difficult time in American History.",1097280000,78,1217,4.454954954954955
2165392,2,B000646MMA,"Clearly, Kerry sees himself as heroic in any endeavor.  This DVD while interesting shows the extent that someone with limited, perhaps no moral substance, can be promoted into something more than they are via editing.  A large portion of the global audience suffers from the lack of critical thinking, and assumes anything in print or in media must be true.  Kerry may be the greatest shame ever pulled on the American public by the media.  More than anything it shows the power of visual persuasion, and challenges that America will continue to face as we gain our entire understanding of life through sound bites on TV.",1097193600,13,621,4.830188679245283
2165393,5,B000646MMA,"Last Friday I saw ""Going Upriver: The Long War of John Kerry."" I saw footage of things in Vietnam, including swiftboat battle footage, that I would have never understood. Same about the Vietnam vets first in the war and then against. I saw politicians delivering messages that have remained with us, and Nixon's ""plumbers"" watching the big Vietnam Vets Against the War demo from atop the White House. I heard entertaining excerpt's from Nixon's Watergate tapes, including the one where they retain Swift Boat Veterans for Lies leader John O'Neill to discredit Kerry. I heard Vietnam Vets describe how they lived the war, and heard Kerry wonder out loud in a letter about a Vietnamese fighter he had just shot. I saw Vets vote on whether to break the law by sleeping, and I heard them tell some of their stories. I saw some stunning photography in Vietnam, and some short, fuzzy, home movie clippings.

This is not an advertising film; it's a documentary - a personality study - by the man who wrote ""Pumping Iron"" about Arnold Schwarzeneggar. At the same time, it dispenses with the Swift Boat Veterans for Falsehood lies simply by talking to the folks who were in the boat with Kerry, whom he protected with personally painful and dangerous actions that really did earn him his medal. The mortality rate in those swift boats was 75% and up, but Kerry's crew members say his quick reactions kept them alive. You can't picture Kerry waiting dumbly 7 to 17 minutes while the Twin Towers are burning.

After going home, Young Kerry showed leadership and maturity as he organized Vietnam Vets Against the War, and helped fellow Vets overcome their trauma and anger to create a peaceful, articulate movement that helped bring the Vietnam War to an end.

I have never considered leadership qualities in choosing a candidate.  That just changed.",1096848000,86,1838,4.843949044585988
2165394,5,B000646MMA,"This movie really put into context how the twisted policies of ""Attrition"" and ""Body Count"" led to our killing of one and a half million Vietnamese civilians during the 10 year war.  It's hard to understand how much worse this war was than the Iraq war is now but it foreshadows what could happen if we stay on our current course in Iraq.

The misguided assumption that the Vietnamese people would see the US as liberators despite the fact that we carelessly killed innocent civilians is an eerie parallel to the problems we are facing in Iraq.  Bush stated in the first debate that it is time the people of Iraq begin to defend themselves.  The irony is that that is exactly what they are doing and that is the problem.",1096848000,58,720,4.473282442748092
2165395,5,B000646MMA,"Before my review of this film, let me begin by saying that I'm 33 years old and have never been very politically active. I've never felt a strong allegiance to either of the major political parties. Both parties have their strengths and weaknesses. Because this year's election holds so much at stake, I felt it necessary to digest as much information as I could, from both major campaigns and for the first time, vote.

Going Upriver is a truly moving documentary. It reminds us of how pointless war destroys both  human life and spirit. The film helped me to develop a new appreciation for our veterans and the price they paid to serve our country.

Going Upriver gives real insight into John Kerry's character and helped me to understand the backbone of his political convictions. Through archival footage, it shows how a young, active college student and natural leader loved his country, believed it's government enough to join the armed services and fought for what he'd been led by them to believe was the right thing to do. John demonstrates his honor in battle, but also sees the ugly side of injustice. After realizing that he'd been mislead by his government to fight in a war which achieved so little at the cost of the lives of so many, the film shows how John Kerry stood up for the good of his fellow veterans and for those who were still stuck in the hell of a pointless war.

To me, the most compelling part of the film was the archival footage of our troops in battle and veterans back at home. It was gut-wrenching to watch the veterans dedicate the tossing away of their war medals in tears and anguish during an emotional ceremony at the nation's capital. It was at the same time very beautiful to see them completely reject the lies told by their commander-in-chief to the degree of throwing away what was for many, all they had to show for their years of service.

After viewing Going Upriver, I feel that I have a MUCH greater understanding of John Kerry's political and strategic tactics. I know that he has exactly what it takes to lead a country in a time or war. He's been through hell and spent a much longer period of time than his political opponent working for the good of the country and his fellow man. He knows what it feels like to be under fire in combat behind enemy lines. After viewing the film and seeing what he's been through, John Kerry's words have taken on a deeper meaning to me. I've never trusted politicians much, as they make great promises only to break them after getting elected. But John Kerry has lived the same convictions that he talks about today for over 30 years. He can back up what he says with his past actions.

Even if you're not politically active, see this film! It delivers a powerful message with regard to what our veterans have gone through for this country.

On a final note, although not completely identical, the similarities between the government's portrayal of and actions regarding the war in Vietnam and the current war in Iraq are frightening...",1096761600,76,3026,4.602968460111318
2165396,5,B000646MMA,"I saw this movie yesterday, and certain scenes are still going through my head, in particular two of the films most wrenching and powerful moments: the first during the Winter Soldier meetings, when veterans came together and talked about their terrible experiences during the war, and the second the moment when the soldiers threw their medals over a fence. That moment had been touched on in the press ad the Republican campaign recently, as the moment where John Kerry ""threw his medals away.""

But you see here hundreds of soldiers, sometimes even family members and mothers of soldiers who had died, going through true agony as they made the choice to throw their medals, which they felt they had earned with their blood and lives, over the wall. The feeling of betrayal, of hurt and fury were made palpable in the film.

These moments alone, which I had never read about in any detail in high school history books, even in discussions of Vietnam War opposition and protest, made the film worth seeing to anyone curious about the war, Kerry's role in it, and the frightening parallels to the war today. But the rest of the movie is very quiet and measured. It didn't fall into blind praise of Kerry as I had expected it would, but really tried to depict how the war affected him, and his transformation from soldier to protester in a way I found compelling. His testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee during these protests is eloquent and compelling evidence of the kind of man he was then and, one hopes, the kind of man he is today.

That testimony, combined with the scenes of the VWVAW protests, especially when you consider how they were in effect spit upon and forgotten in the years since the war, will make this movie an informative and measured antidote to the spewing forth of empty rhetoric and shrill accusations this election season.",1096761600,54,1868,4.7592592592592595
2165397,5,B000646MMA,"I saw GOING UPRIVER today at a small theater that shows independent films.  I thought the movie was excellently done.  It showed just how horrific the Vietnam War really was, and how John Kerry made his way from quiet soldier to charismatic leader of Vietnam Veterans Against the War. It was amazing to watch a man so young take such great risks in support of his fellow troops who were deserted by the government during this turbulent time.  I had no idea that Mr. Kerry had been so active during this period.  All I have heard in the media is how many medals he had earned and whether they were given wrongly or not.  The story you don't hear is the one about the Vietnam Veterans who were basically forced off of the Washington Monument mall because they wanted to protest against the war, or how those veterans were mistreated by the government.  I thought the medal throwing ceremony was very interesting....and sad.

This film was very educational from both the standpoint of John Kerry's background, and about the Vietnam era in general.  This is a must watch no matter what political party you follow.",1096675200,57,1109,4.651282051282052
2165398,5,B000646MMA,"This film shows that John Kerry is the right man, the right time, the right place!

At 27 yrs. of age he led, took risks, he stayed centered, he spoke with clarity and conviction .

Note the conversation between Nixon and Haldeman!

2165399,5,B000646MMA,"See this movie and see where our next President has been and how he looks at the world. He doesn't see the world in simplistic black and white, the back slapping cowboy impersonation, reducing everything to the lowest common denominator.

Kerry sees wrong as try to right them, without feeling that it a sign of weekness to say this is the wrong path.

The movie's beautifully done, a thought provoking look at then and of now. It should be shown in schools all over the country to show our young that it is unnessary to go blind into the world and the voting booth.",1096675200,54,566,4.4326923076923075
2165400,5,B000646MMA,"I saw Going Upriver last night and it helped to clarify the seemingly inconsistent political positions of John Kerry that the Bush campaign is constantly repeating.

It is possible to love your country and disagree with the government and standing up against a powerful government for what you believe is right and what is right for those without power may be the most patriotic action of any American.

A vote for Kerry is not just a vote against Bush.  It is a vote for ordinary citizens to take back our country.  See the film and encourage everyone you know to do the same and make up their own minds.",1096675200,58,605,4.522935779816514
2165401,5,B000646MMA,"I was not alive during the Vietnam war but I wanted to watch a documentary which showed the reality of the struggles our troops faced in Vietnam and when they arrived back in America. I didn't want to see a boring documentary or a movie which tries to ""glamorize"" the Vietnam war.

Fortunately this movie was full of the emotional struggles the troops faced. This documentary starts off with a brief intro into Kerry's childhood. Then it goes into Vietnam and then into the anti-war movement. It is amazing how many parallels the Vietnam war has to the current war in Iraq, here are some lines from the movie:

- We must liberate the people

- We must win the hearts and minds of the people

- We don't do body counts

- We must spread freedom

- I don't understand why we are there (some troops say this)

- The reasons for the war keeps changing

Isn't it just like Iraq? You would think people would learn from a war which happened less than 40 years ago!

Anyway, most of America wanted our troops pulled out of Vietnam but the Nixon Administration did not want to be ""the first administration to lose a war"".  So I guess it was better to let people die than to admit you are wrong. (over 58,000 American soldiers died and 300,000 soldiers were injured!!, 3,000,0000 Vietnamese killed and over half were civilians)

When Kerry comes back from Vietnam, him and thousands of other Vietnam Vets formed a peace group and joined the anti-war movement. The anti-war movement was strong during the late 60s because of the draft. Right now with our Iraq war, there is not a draft so millions of high school/college and University students are oblivious to the war in Iraq.

Sadly, troops are turned away when they protest at the Capitol. A mother is turned away from seeing her son's grave in the Arlington cemetery.  (just like now, 40 families of people who died in the Iraq war were turned away from Bush's State of the Union/ but supporters of the war got great seats and some PR moments).

The Nixon Administration does not like the veterans against the war so he takes John O'Neill and some other Vietnam war vets who are pro-war and forms a ""counter group"". This group is called ""Vietnam Vets for a Just Peace"" - today this group is Swift Boat Vets. Swift Boat Vets were funded heavily from the Texas GOP during the 2004 election but for some reason this didn't cause outrage. Do you see a pattern??

This movie is very emotional and I cried a few times. The parallels to our current war in Iraq were amazing. Please get involved in the anti-war movement, each of us can make a difference.

2165402,5,B000646MMA,"Amoung the smears, fears and distortions of the 2004 presidential campaign, the most shameful episode is that of trying to discredit the honorable Viet Nam service of John Kerry. How the Bush campaign was able to turn a man who pulled out all stops to avoid serving his country into the ""honorable warrior"", at the same time trying to destroy a true hero who served his country with honor, is one for the textbooks when it comes to sleeze. IF you enjoy fiction, read the book ""Unfit for Command""....... if you enjoy the truth, please view this DVD.",1107820800,7,548,4.6020408163265305
2165403,5,B000646MMA,"After seeing this movie, I can't understand how ANYBODY could have questioned John Kerry's ability to lead this country.

I still find it just absolutely amazing that George W Bush could even be seen as being in the same league as this man- and this documentary confirmed it.

Just one thing ached in my head when I watched this DVD two months after the election- Where did the idealistic, charismatic and courageous young man that John Kerry once was go? I came to the conclusion that he was the same man, but just couldn't convey it during the 2004 campaign as persuasively as he did in 1971. Or maybe just that in this era of simplistic 5 second sound bites, he wasn't given the chance.

But make no mistake, He IS the Real Deal. He walked the walk when the President and all of his phony idealogues just talked the talk- then and now. Anybody can wave the flag. John Kerry understood a deeper patriotism, and more than rose to the occasion.

It's too bad this didn't get a wide release before the election. If it got the publicity and marketing of ""Fahrenheit 911"", I really believe it could have made a difference...",1106784000,6,1121,4.5073891625615765
2165404,5,B000646MMA,"George Butler has made another classic documentary. His ""Pumping Iron"" changed the way Americans thought about their bodies and ""Going Upriver"" will change their outlook on war and what makes a hero.

2165407,5,B000646MMA,I just finished watching Going Upriver and was tremendously moved by it.  The scenes of the young men dealing with what happened to them in Viet Nam are an important record of that conflict.  And also an important message for us to consider as the United States is once again involved in a war with no clear exit strategy.  It shows the formative times of John Kerry.  And it shows him as a remarkable young man dealing with serious issues of war and peace.,1099094400,8,457,4.404761904761905
2165408,4,B000646MMA,"""Going Upriver"" documents the experiences during the Vietnam era of current presidential candidate Senator John Kerry that shaped his personal and political life from that point forward. The film was made by George Butler, a documentarian best known for his 1977 film ""Pumping Iron"", that introduced the public to Arnold Schwarzenegger, and  2000's award-winning ""The Endurance: Shakleton's Legendary Anarctic Expedition"". Butler is a 40-year friend of Kerry's, who worked for Kerry in 1969 and co-edited ""The New Soldier"", a book about the Vietnam Veterans Against the War, with him, so this film does not pretend to be an unbiased account. Butler admires Kerry, and ""Going Upriver"" focuses on Kerry at his most charismatic and well-spoken, when he entered the public eye as an anti-war activist in 1971.

Classmates, fellow Senators, historians, Vietnam veterans, and  journalists narrate Kerry's experience as a swift boat captain, patrolling inland waterways in Vietnam, and explain the policies and purpose of the boats' missions. It was apparently the military's ""free fire zone"" strategy that most soured Kerry on the War. This was the tactic of declaring an area a ""free fire zone"" from which all Vietnamese must be cleared or killed without clearly identifying them. There is a surprising amount of film footage of Kerry and other swift boat personnel in Vietnam. I was struck by how much photographed the War was.

Kerry joined ""Vietnam Veterans Against the War"" upon his return from Vietnam in 1969. ""Going Upriver"" focuses on his organization of the very successful ""Dewey Canyon III"" event in 1971, which thrust Kerry into the public eye from which he has never retired. Thousands of Vietnam veterans gathered on the Mall in Washington, D.C. to petition Congress to withdraw the United States from Vietnam and to rally the public to their cause. It was during this time that Kerry testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. We see the testimony that made Kerry an instant celebrity when it was originally televised. Whenever he spoke, the 27-year-old Kerry was articulate, charismatic, and demonstrated considerable leadership ability. It is no wonder that even Senators listened to him.

At times I found it disappointing that ""Going Upriver"" doesn't directly address the accusations and criticism leveled at Kerry by John O'Neill in his book ""Unfit for Command"". But the film accomplishes what it sets out to do. It shows Kerry at his most impressive, the man who persuaded a nation that ending the war in Vietnam was imperative, and it makes the audience understand the personal and political forces that shaped his career. Instead of arguing with O'Neill point-for-point, ""Going Upriver"" includes audio tapes of President Nixon and Chuck Colson talking about recruiting O'Neill to ""destroy the young demagogue before he becomes another Ralph Nader"". Paranoid and dictatorial, but ironically funny in light of Nader's 2004 presidential bid. There is some brief footage of Kerry and O'Neill facing off on television, but I would have liked to hear more from both of them.

The DVD: There is a theatrical trailer and a ""Director Profile"", which is a 4-page text bio for director George Butler.",1099008000,13,3221,5.232558139534884

More than 58,000 Americans, and 3 Million Vietnamese, more than half of which were civilians, were killed in that war, and one has to ask if those obscene figures could have been even higher without patriots like Kerry.

The reviews here convinced me to give it a try.  Up until a few weeks ago, I was one of those people who was against Bush, but not particularly excited about John Kerry, either.  The debates began to change that, and seeing this movie has done it.  I am excited. This just might be a man who could be the president we need! This movie has a great deal of footage of the young John Kerry, both in Vietnam and afterwards.  The film of his interviews and testimony representing the Vietnam Vets Against the War blew me away!  This guy was 27 years old and so eloquent and sincere and powerful!  He seemed more presidential then than W. does now!  There are even tapes of Nixon and his aides discussing him and what an impact he was having.

The movie clearly communicates a credible development of John Kerry as a leader and a patriot and how his time before and after his stay in Vietnam was the vehicle for this personal transformation.  Shame on Republicans & media for discrediting his leadership and patriotism. If people saw this movie they would understand how shameful this misinformation is. This DVD highlights John Kerry's resolve and commitment to bring this country to see the realities of Vietnam at the risk of his own political aspirations and brings out the true character of John Kerry.

2165415,4,B000646MMA,"To get it out of the way, so people can see if they want to keep reading, I am voting for John Kerry.  That aside, this is an occasionally powerful documentary that feels somewhat rushed, and might have been even better if it were not an election year.  That way, the filmmakers could've concentrated more on the Vietnam Veterans Against the War, an organization that has been portrayed inaccurately over these past few months.

One thing I like especially about the film is how Kerry isn't always the most dominant presence in it.  The movie is strong on context, focusing on veterans who joined Kerry in the movement to end the war in addition to those who fought with him.

The use of archival materials such as Super 8 movies shot in the 1960s and 70s, and still photographs and interviews, is understated and effective.  Director George Butler, whose ""Pumping Iron"" is a first-rate documentary, lets the force of the veterans' stories, and voices and images, carry the film forward.

The most powerful moment in the film is the one that should be: footage of the 1971 protest where Vietnam veterans discarded their medals, citations, and other military honors on the steps of the US Capitol.  Butler lets the details of that protest create an extended sequence in the movie that becomes genuinely dramatic.  The film has no narration because, again, the voices and images of the veterans say all that is needed.

As far as the controversy goes, no one can deny that many veterans disagree with John Kerry's stance on the war and his actions 33 years ago.  They have a right to their anger, just as veterans with a different viewpoint recognized the antiwar movement as something they wanted to be in because they wanted to help save lives.  Vietnam Veterans against the War was not simply an angry, reckless protest group.  Their protests were confrontational but not aggressive, and the group also was probably the first organization to offer psychological counseling for veterans with Post-traumatic stress disorder, which is at high levels among Vietnam veterans.",1098316800,10,2071,4.899713467048711
2165416,5,B000646MMA,"At a time when the allegedly liberal mass media was trying to convince itself that soldiers enjoyed dying for a fabricated war, John Kerry and Vietnam Veterans Against the War brought a needed element of truth to the American people.

By this time, they had grown weary with their public officials, but still wondered if opposing the war would be an insult to their families and friends. Could they support these people while opposing the war they were forced to fight in?

Having seen casualties of war for themselves, the soldiers were just as anxious (if not more so than the civilian protestors) to leave Vietnam. Precisely because of their battlefield-earned conscience, these men resented right-wing portrayal of the war as being 'good' and 'just'. They also knew a nation which sends troops only to be slaughtered forfeits the right to a serious discussion on ethics and justice.

Since my generation now faces similar conditions in Iraq, I found this DVD especially moving.

What only might have been a history lesson a year ago is obviously upgraded to a current events resource. Instead of conceding Kerry only documented what other soldiers were previously found guilty of, the modern day right wing is attempting to fabricate history for their own means.

Unlike Michael Moore's much-ballyhooed Fahrenheit 9//11, this movie flows very linear---and would be enjoyable for a broad audience spectrum. In addition to a good format, the film is also blessed with a great message.

Activism which challenges the government's official public statement is hard, but it is important. Kerry eventually sat on the other side of the Senate committee table where he once gave testimony, but he always has a passion for helping other people and thus making America a better place. Even when I don't always agree with Kerry, I am assured that I will not be called a terrorist.

Both the issue-specific content and release context of this DVD make it very atypical election outreach material. Viewers are intentionally encouraged to leave each viewing with many more thoughts than prompted through the prototypical television campaign advertisements and personal appearances.

Whether you want to know Kerry better or celebrate real character and ethical values in your next President, this is a great product.",1098230400,30,2306,5.147058823529412
2165417,5,B000646MMA,"Though made by a friend of Kerrys, it is not completely a positive spin. It is not a ""happy"" film, it is a thoughtful one.

I was a child when this happened and did not understand the politics at the time, though I have known vets with PTSD, and know what a difficult time so many Vietnam Vets went through (are still going thru.) It is obvious from comments here, that old wounds in our country over this time in history have still not healed.

  This film examines the Vietnam Vets Against the War, and a part Kerry played in the group.. I was struck by Kerrys ability to be a ""uniter not divider"" in that role.

However, It is obvious that the Kerry running for president is even more of a Moderate than the young man in this film.

I also left the theatre thinking of all the Vets who never made it out of vietnam ""whole"" even if they were physically in one piece.  I think it is a testament to something in Kerrys character, or his personal faith that he  saw all the death and violence he did there, and came back with his spirit in one piece.",1098230400,23,1049,4.1840796019900495
2165418,4,B000646MMA,"This documentary helps provide a context for many of the statements John Kerry made at the time as well as in his campaign since.  It seems that some of the reviews posted not only didn't see the film but have little or no first hand knowledge of the Vietnam War.

Here's the reality check.  Kerry's testimony before Congress occurred about a month after Lt. Calley was convicted by six combat officers in his courtmartial for the My Lai massacre.  Calley was one of many tried and convicted of war crimes in Vietnam.  The amazing aspect of this is that a certain contigent wants to believe that these things never happened.  They somehow have convinced themselves that atrocities never happened despite mountains of evidence and witnesses from both ends of the political spectrum.  This is patently bizarre.

While Kerry's choice of words may not be outstanding, war crimes occurred.  These things have happened in every war and the prison scandal in Iraq has reminded us that war is ugly.  Ensuring that this small minority of criminals are held accountable is hardly unpatriotic as some have implied.  They are a demonstration that the American system works and, of that, we should be very proud.

Cover-ups are unpatriotic.

I would also hasten to remind those who have a negative reaction to this film that it was a Republican President who finally agreed with Kerry, recognized that the war could not be won and withdrew US troops.  The disgusting aspect of this is not that we withdrew but how long it took for us to come to this end.

The August release of more of the White House tapes features a discussion between Kissinger and Nixon where they clearly state that the withdrawal from Vietnam was unavoidable.  It is gut wrenching when you read their discussion of the importance of waiting until after the 1972 Presidential election because they did not want to offend their political base.

NIXON HAD ALREADY MADE DECISION TO WITHDRAW WHEN KERRY GAVE HIS TESTIMONY IN 1971!

I had a friend, William Pease, who died in Vietnam during that time when we were waiting for the election.  His name is on the Wall.  That my friends is a war crime.

Something else I noticed about the Vietnam war is that the ""left"" wing blood ran just as thick and red as the ""right"" wing blood.

The Vietnam veterans were treated shamefully when they returned home but it was hardly because of John Kerry.  There was a collective feeling of dismay that the country felt upon losing its first war.  There was a feeling of collective shock as Vietnam was the first war to be blasted into our living rooms via television in living color.  And then there were the atrocities . . .

I have given this film four stars as it helps balance the misinformation that spews from some sources.  I did not give it five because I am sick to death of reliving the Vietnam war and both candidates have shameless exploited it.  The difference between the candidates is that at least John Kerry served in Vietnam.

Everyone should SEE this film and judge for themselves.  Being open minded is reading BOTH the Washington Post and the National Review.

PS: Never forget our POWs and MIAs.  Five more bodies were found in just the past few days and are coming home.  God rest their souls.  Let's hope they come home to a wiser America.",1098144000,43,3303,4.677083333333333

They used his words and others like him (Hanoi Jane) to try to propagandize our heroes that the country was against all they had suffered for. Hate Bush, if that's your thing, but don't give this disgrace to patriotism any kudos for causing further damage to what was a terrible tragedy. There's a reason that there's a veterans against Kerry group. It's better to remain silent and be thought stupid, than to talk and remove all doubt.

However, whatever your political view, you owe it to yourself to watch this film. Very shortly into it, you begin to learn about the climate of our country at the time of the Vietnam War, the White House administration, and the frightening parallels to the times we live in today. (The audience in the theatre laughed nervously a few times at chilling similarities.)

Be informed by actual footage of interviews, speeches, and sentiments of the day. You'll hear tapes of a worried Nixon speaking to Haldeman about this young well-spoken Kerry, determining that they must put into place a counterpart. We then see an eager John O'Neill sitting beside Nixon in a still photo, then appearing on Dick Cavett Show attacking Kerry. (O'Neill is oddly the same, except then he's thinner and still fighting acne. Kerry's response to O'Neill - in context - is impressive.)

I had not realized how instrumental Kerry was in putting America on the right path during that time. The record speaks for itself.  Listen to more of Kerry's 1971 congressional testimony (not just the cherry-picked soundbites you're used to).

This man is a leader. More importantly, you get the sense that he'll lead in the right direction.",1098057600,37,1429,5.012658227848101

I'd highly recommend it not because its about one politician or another, but because its just a great look at what was really going on in America during the Viet Nam era both at home and abroad.  It reminds us how the Nixon administration fell into such depths of falsery and manipulation to keep itself in power. Governments aren't supposed to LIE to their people, they are supposed to SERVE them. The parrells to today are staggering. If we fail to learn from the mistakes of history, we are doomed to repeat them.

I really understood the disillusionment of a young man serving in a foreign land, the incredible bravery it took to get up each day in that environment, and the courage to stand up when he got home to the very powerful political machine and say ""ENOUGH!"" Lets face it, he could have lapsed into drug use or alcoholism like so many Viet Nam vets, but he didn't.  He came back and said, ""I have to do something.""

Bush supporters ought to see this to be able to accurately compare their man with Kerry, and if Bush is so great, they have nothing to fear.  In my view, Bush's life, at the same time Kerry was living the portion of his life documented in this film, is a blowing, undirected, useless grain of sand, while Kerry's existence was purposeful, selfless, and yes, heroic.  This film by George Butler moved me to tears, thinking of what the vets went through in Nam and here, and gave me a tiny insight into some clear differences in moral fiber between the larger than life Kerry and the confused mystic Bush.  -  Helen",1098057600,40,856,4.51948051948052
2165423,5,B000646MMA,"""Going Upriver: The Long War of John Kerry"" is a highly accomplished documentary of the trials and tribulations of the Vietnam War era. The documentary focuses on the first 29 years of the current presidential candidate's life, his successive careers as Vietnam War hero and anti-Vietnam War protestor.

For those who came of age in the Vietnam era this film will likely be an unexpectedly cathartic experience. For those too young to have experienced this period, and maybe even more so for those with even parents too young to have told them stories, this film is a reminder of the importance of retaining the historical context of events. The stories, memories, losses, sorrows and reactions rising from the events of that era can only be clearly understood in the context of that time. Removing events from history inevitably distorts their original purpose and meaning. If nothing else, the documentary does recreate the context of these events.

After recounting Kerry's childhood and years at Yale the film turns to the events of Vietnam. Kerry's shipmates, Gunner's Mates David Alston and Fred Short, rear gunner Michael Medeiros, leading petty officer Del Sandusky and Green Beret James Rassmann, the man whose life Kerry saved under fire, very convincingly tell what they saw in Vietnam. Rassmann remembers Kerry saving his life by lifting him from the river with enemy fire all around. Two other shipmates directly recall Kerry's pursuit and killing of an armed Vietcong sniper that won Kerry his Silver Star. Another shipmate recalls that the swift boats were under fire every day and the average casualty rate was 75 percent. In some regions of the river the rate was as high as 90 percent.

""Going Upriver"" then moves into the well-documented years of Kerry's anti-war activities as a leader of the Vietnam Veterans Against the War (VVAW) and as an eloquent witness before Sen. J. William Fulbright's Senate Foreign Relations committee. The film places in context the wider public dissent of the war, the Winter Soldier conference, the formation of the VVAW, Kerry's 1971 statement to the Senate, and the emotional event where soldiers threw away their ribbons and medals. The honesty and immediacy of these moments clarify the emotional intensity and social unrest of the times that cannot be truly embraced or understood from a 2004 perspective.

An unspoken theme in ""Going Upriver"" that might be discerned by the viewer is the parallel between that time and the present. In both cases, Vietnam and Iraq, Kerry began believing in the mission, but after witnessing the reality of the events on the ground, he came to a new conclusion and challenged a president's wartime rhetoric. He spoke out then as now to protect and honor the lives of the men and women that protect our nation. We must never confuse the rhetoric of war with the honor and duty of the warrior.

At the end of the Vietnam War 70 percent of the American public believed the government's leaders had been wrong about the war. Today, nearly the same percentage of the public, over 65 percent, believes the Bush administration is wrong on Iraq. Today as then, some call this anti-American, but most recognize this dissent as the purist sign of patriotism in a democracy.

""Going Upriver"" is a well-researched, calm, and thoughtful documentary that never rings misleading or untrue. Those who dismiss it as a movie-length campaign commercial will miss out on a compelling and dramatic story of a young man and a nation coming of age. I strongly believe this film is worth watching even if you decide to wait until after November 2.",1097971200,54,3612,4.9718543046357615

2165427,5,B000646MMA,"The first I ever heard of John Kerry was on Iowa Public Television which aired a town hall meeting with Kerry before the caucus.  I was impressed with how he listened to the questions directed to him and answered them knowledgably and thoroughly.  Later I went to a Kerry rally out of curiousity and came away feeling good about him because he nailed every issue important to me.  I feel that Bush has radically left the Republican party and no longer embodies conservative or christian values.  I decided to support John Kerry after this rally because, if he keeps his word, he will be an intelligent President with an articulate plan of action.

Then I watched Going Upriver at the theater.  I sobbed after this movie because I'm an activist and I hate needless war, loss of humanity for no desperate cause, destruction of life, family, home, country for politics.  I was truely moved by the leadership and courage Kerry showed in his youth.  He saw the futility of the Vietnam war first hand, and he had the integrity to speak out against it, even if it killed his political future to join a movement unpopular with the government.

You may say the commentary is biased, but I saw the video footage from the time, I heard the words that came out of Kerry's mouth 30 years ago after the war, and I made up my own mind.  This is the kind of man I want leading my nation.  I want a person with this kind of composure and conviction leading us out of Iraq, protecting me from the terrorist threat, and restoring our economy to prosperity.",1097625600,84,1537,4.512635379061372
2165428,5,B000646MMA,"I had some hesitation about seeing this movie.  I thought it would be, as one reviewer here said (who probably hasn't even seen this movie), propaganda, meant to sway your vote.  But it is nothing of the kind.  If you go into this film with a deep hatred for Mr. Kerry, then you will probably still feel the same after having seen it.  If you believe that he committed an act of treason when he came back from Vietnam and protested the war, then this will not convince you otherwise.

This film present you with first hand footage of the events that transpired from about '65 to '72.  It tells of a generation of hopeful and idealistic men who went to Vietnam to fight a war of liberation.  When they get there, they find out that this war is not as it was sold to them.  They find themselves shooting and killing the very same people they were there to save.  It shows that there were many who questioned the tactics of the war as it was happening on the battlefield, only to be summarily ruled out by their commanding officers.  Then they finally leave the war and come home, expecting a hero's welcome.  What they find is a country in turmoil, bitterly divided (as we are now) about the wisdom of that war.

What is not widely known is that both parties officially called for a withdrawal of troops and an end to the war in their platforms in 1968 (but the war would go on for another 5 years).  So, for all intents and purposes, the war was coming to an end, but American boys were still dying, because of a few obstinate people who held out a fading hope that the war was winnable.  When Mr. Kerry came home, he had a choice to make; would he take a stand for the immediate cessation of the war, and thereby save the lives of hundreds and thousands of US soldiers (and also Vietnamese civilians), or would he retreat into the shadows, and go on with his life.  You will be surprised to learn that John Kerry played a pivotal role in the war protests, and was probably single handedly responsible in stopping the war when it did.

One thing that strikes me is that while the people here in the states had the luxury of casually debating this war, there were still hundreds of American soldiers dying and getting wounded.  There are times when we don't have the luxury of time, when immediate action is required.",1097452800,87,2315,4.371495327102804

I had thought it would be little more than a testimonial to Kerry, and, while there is certainly that element in it, the film's focus actually goes well beyond that.  It presents a compelling portrait of the veterans who returned home from the Vietnam War in the early 1970's, particularly those who felt they had to speak out against it.  This is the first documentary treatment I've seen of the Vietnam Veterans Against the War movement, and it's a poignant reminder of the complexity of the issues and emotions that were current at the time.  We have tended to forget and oversimplify what these men went through, both during their tours of duty in the war and upon their return to the States.

We even get to see John O'Neill who recently wrote a book on Kerry which has been proven to be full of lies and general inaccurancies. In the long run, we see that Kerry is a man of his convictions and principles.

8038206,5,B000646MMA,"Going Upriver is a documentary film on U.S. Senator John Kerry that was based on Douglas Brinkley's best-selling novel,Tour Of Duty. It follows Kerry's military service record from his years in Vietnam up to the year when it was released during the 2004 U.S. Presidential elections when he was the candidate of the Democratic Party running against President George W. Bush of the Republican Party.

The film illustrates his contribution to the peace advocacy groups after being honorably discharged from the Navy which had an impact on his political ideologies. It provides significant events like Kerry's famous speech before a Senate committee, historical footage from the Winter Soldier Investigations, and coverage of the Dewey Canyon III anti-war demonstrations in Washington, D.C. The majority of the film is composed of archival footage, with much of it in the original black-and-white format.

Apparently,this documentary is the response to the Bush campaign's Swift Boat attack on John Kerry in the heat of the Presidential election. Too bad that this was somewhat released rather too late - two months before the elections - as it could have given us a great portrait of a man who would have been a great President of the country. While many would have considered it a political advertisement for the Democratic Party's candidate,it still managed to show the great qualifications that he has and the many politicians that do not possess. It also shows how the anti-war movement was effective as it was when it was represented by Kerry. It was obvious that George Butler did his homework to provide a great documentary based on Brinkley's book to provide the viewer of what kind of a man Kerry was. Too bad that not many Americans were aware of it and have failed to see it. It resulted to Kerry losing one of the closest Presidential elections in U.S history by failing to win only the state of Ohio and the narrowest victory of a sitting President by George W.Bush.",1433721600,,1976,4.966767371601208

I don't doubt that the medals many US soldiers receive are of dubious value, but riding a boat through Vietnam during the US invasion is deserving of some respect in and of itself.  After viewing this excellent documentary, I came away with an even higher regard for Kerry and those he experienced that hideous war with.  Kerry also deserves a medal for the effort he made to stop that crime of aggression.  I've purchased several copies of this film and have sent them to US soldiers in Iraq who feel our country is on another unjust mission.  The feedback I receive is interesting, with many expressing resentment towards Kerry bashers like Sean Hannity and Paul O'Neil.

I voted for Kerry, but I sent money to Ralph Nader's campaign because Nader does such a great job of challenging both wings of the establishment.  In one scene of ""Going Upriver,"" Nixon and his associates are sitting around talking about how they can undercut Kerry, because they said, ""we don't want him to become another Nader.""  I thought that was a revealing moment.  With private ownership of our voting machines, I don't doubt that some votes for Kerry and Nader went down some Diebold rabbit hole.

8038211,4,B000646MMA,"This documentary is dedicated to the Vietnam War era and the role U.S. Senator and Presidential candidate John Kerry played during his time in battle and his time as a peace activist. Kerry's early life at Yale, his time spent manning swift boats in Vietnam, and his post- war stint as an anti- war activist are covered in this film. The viewer is taken to the rivers of Vietnam and back to the USA to witness war protests from the 1970's as Kerry takes the lead in speaking out against what he feels is an unethical war.

Many childhood friends, war time acquaintances, and well- known politicians make appearances in this film to talk to the viewer about John Kerry. They are all biased in favor of Kerry, with not one of them making any negative statements toward the Massachusetts Senator. They talk about Kerry's greatness in battle, as a leader, and as a politician. There is nothing negative said about Kerry, and this fact could turn off some viewers who prefer a more balanced viewpoint. This documentary was released about five weeks before the 2004 election, and it was obviously timed this way to help Kerry at the polls.

Probably the most interesting parts of this documentary are those found near the end when Kerry has returned from Vietnam a disillusioned man, ready to let the people know how wrong it is for the United States to be involved in this war. There is one scene, for example, showing Kerry on the Dick Caveat show with Nixon's communication director. In this and other scenes, Kerry shows his knack for communication and articulation. He states his points very well, and his opponents are often left looking stupid, with no idea how to rebut his claims.

Director George Butler did a good job in the production of this documentary. The film flows nicely from scene to scene and many different people are permitted some time in front of the camera. Kerry and others speak (like Nixon, LBJ, and others), but only via archive footage. There are also some graphic scenes of violence taken from Vietnam, and this is the main reason for the film's PG-13 rating.

This documentary moves a little slowly in some places, but there is a good soundtrack of 1960's tunes from artists like John Lennon, Bob Dylan, David Crosby, and others that helps to keep the entertainment level in the moderate range. It would probably have been a better documentary if it was better balanced and/or if it included biographical information from Kerry's later days as a politician. But taken as it is, this is still a documentary worth watching. It shows how one man can speak his mind and make a difference in the politics of his country.",1118361600,2,2642,4.712121212121212
8038212,3,B000646MMA,"Some may feel I've waited a little too long to see this documentary. That it loses some of its purpose after the fact. In case you haven't heard John Kerry lost the election. But despite this I was eager to watch this. I think the subject is a fascinating one and can be enjoyed at any time. Plus, don't forget it's the 30th anniversary to the end of the Vietnam War. But that had nothing to do with why I wanted to see this in the first place.

 Last year there was a parade of political documentaries making their way to theatres. There was of course ""Fahrenheit 9\11"", the best of them all. ""Uncovered:The Truth About the Iraq War"", ""The Hunting of the President"" (this was about Bill Clinton) and ""Bush's Brain"" (about Karl Rove) to me the least effective of these documentaries. But with all these documentaries I learned something. They provide some information I hadn't know. One of the main reasons I wasn't overwhelmed with ""Going Upriver"" was due to the fact it didn't say anything I didn't already know. Because the 2004 Presidential election was so heated I think those of us who considered ourselves informed voters knew all the stories going around about each candidate. This documentary was released at about the time th ""Swiftboat Vets For Truth"" were making their claims, all of which have been refuted.

 As I watched this documentary I was struck by what I saw. I thought what a shame it was that the John Kerry of today could not match the Kerry of yesterday. What a great speaker he was at one point. He had such an eloquent way with words. You could tell he was standing up for something he believed in. It was personal.

 The John Kerry we saw during the election just seemed to lack the ability to stand up and fight. How the Republicans were able to paint a war hero as a coward is beyond me. To hear people like vice-president Dick Cheney question Kerry's wounds and his medals is quite frankly disgusting. But why wouldn't Kerry defend himself? I doubt it would have made a difference in the election results but at least Kerry would have had the satisfaction of knowing he stood up for himself.

 But this documentary doesn't cover any of this material. Kerry is not interviewed. He is only shown on-screen when old footage is shown. The documentary only follows the story about his activites when returning home from Vietnam. No mention is even made that he is running for president. I mention this because it's important that people do not think this was an endorsment of Kerry's nomination. Perhaps the filmaker wanted him to win but no bias is presented. It is a straight foward look at what John Kerry did and his intentions. It was an attempt to set the record straight. Because of this maybe, just maybe some Kerry bashers would be able to watch this documentary and not hate him. I'm not saying it will change anyone's mind, but at the very least it may help you understand him more. Maybe.

 The John Kerry presented in this film was a man who did in fact have the mental capability to lead this country. He expresses himself in a clear thoughful and articulate manner and despite what you may have heard from Republicans showed the abilty to make wise decisions. And I think Kerry showed these qualities during the election.

 I recommend people see this documentary despite perhaps already knowing the information provided here. It is well-made and informative.

 Bottom-line: If you kept up with the election nothing here will surprise you but it will serve as a constant reminder of the man John Kerry is. And for that you should see it.",1114992000,6,3599,4.603125
