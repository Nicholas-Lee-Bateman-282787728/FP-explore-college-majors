8013294,2,B0001JXOMQ,"This version is just okay if you are one who grew up in the 1980s and know about this case. This is not in a ""movie"" format but in a ""video"" appearance version as if it were taped as a news coverage. It focuses only on the court transcripts and it very straight forward. Ellen Burstyn was not casted very well, though, they thought so at the time of filming this one. She is not as world worn or has the slight edge as the actual Jean Harris (the only actress who captured that edge was Annette Bening in Mrs. Harris from HBO). This version will make you feel a bit claustrophobic because it really remains in the courtroom without flashbacks of the crime. The acting is standard overall and does not offer a range to the characters, but remember, it was interesting in the 1980s when it came out and this newer generation may not have the attention span to watch this version. It isn't horrible, it is just very boxed in and doesn't really allow one to explore character depth. So, it is okay to watch and should have been simply released on You Tube rather than to purchase this one. View this one if Amazon will allow you to view before purchasing. If you are truly interested in the court system and want to listen to the actual transcript of what was spoken, then, you may enjoy this for what it is worth because there isn't much on this case for free except for the Barbara Walters interview with Jean Harris after she has been released from prison. It comes in a cheap envelope sleeve and not in a plastic case (which I did not appreciate). You are better off purchasing Mrs. Harris with Annette Bening and Ben Kingsley to get a better overview of what actually took place between the two because you will not find that here. If they attempted to do so in this version, it would have been more interesting and would have added some layers into telling this story.",1474156800,,1870,4.39193083573487
8013295,5,B0001JXOMQ,"I use this ""true crime"" audiobook in a lecture I give on modern female murders.  It's wonderful to know I can get duplicates of the film on Amazon.",1427587200,,147,4.25
8013296,3,B0001JXOMQ,"Ms. Burstyn makes the TV movie watchable. Her great skills and belief in the character save this video filmed outing from being a total mess. Not for a moment did I think she wasn't Jean Harris.  The court room only style looks like Court TV footage and she pulls it off - as she always does - with a sadness and exhaustion that the real Jean conveyed,  Ellen is one of the greatest actresses that ever lived and this performance is no exception.",1405209600,,446,4.36144578313253
8013297,5,B0001JXOMQ,This basically covers the four months of the trial for Jean Harris. There's a lot of details in the movie that were the details of the actual trial. It's an interesting trial and goes on for four months.,1373155200,,203,4.368421052631579
8013298,1,B0001JXOMQ,"This is one of the worst movies I have seen in ages! I could only tolerate the first 10 minutes or so, before I took it out and put it away! It appears as if the filmmaker literally used a camcorder to film. Although great actors were cast, their performance was ""vanilla"" at best.",1369267200,,281,4.222222222222222
8013299,3,B0001JXOMQ,"A Televised drama of the trial of Jean Harris.  The infamous headmistress of an exclusive girls school who shot and killed her lover Dr. Herman Tarnower.  The victim was the author of a best-selling diet book, which brought the case even more notoriety.

This video confines itself exclusively with the trial.  No background on the case is given and only slight introductions to the lawyers and the judge as the drama opens.  Confusing to people who are not familiar with the case and repetitive to those who are.

There are no special features on the DVD

From the video:

""Based on a transcript of the trial of jean Harris. Some of the testimony presented here is not in the same order as given during the trial.

Because the proceedings took more than three months to complete, much of the testimony and lawyers' statements, arguments, and objections as well as rulings and charges of the judge in this case have necessity been abbreviated or omitted.""",1105920000,8,955,4.774390243902439
