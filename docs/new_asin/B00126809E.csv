8244183,5,B00126809E,I'm extremely happy with this CD. It  has the complete opening and ending themes to the series. There's even the theme song for the video game on the disc. If you want to remember some of your favorite moments from the show then this is the CD for you!,1373673600,,252,4.142857142857143
8244184,4,B00126809E,"The CD is really just a collection of the openings and endings from the anime show, movie, and one of the games. It is unique from the other CDs in that it has the unedited songs and the DVD component has the show openings with video (sans subtitles and credits). The artwork on the cover and in the manual are nice (though small in the manual), and look nice in my opinion.

With most of this available elsewhere, I would only recommend to real fans of the show/manga.",1369612800,,469,4.329545454545454
8244185,5,B00126809E,"This is an AMAZING CD/DVD combo for any Eureka Seven Fan!  Granted the videos are only as long as the actual opening or ending, but it's still awesome to have them!  Plus the CD makes up for it by having the full versions of every song!  I couldn't be happier! X3",1359504000,,263,4.117647058823529
8244186,5,B00126809E,"This is just an all around awesome CD. The songs are great, exact one's from the anime obviously, and the one from the game was really good too. I recommend it to any Eureka Seven fan. My only complaint is that in iTunes, the soundtrack is labeled in Japanese per song, but really not a big deal at all. More authentic anyway.",1344902400,,326,4.274193548387097
8244188,5,B00126809E,"One other review mentioned not having all the long versions. This is incorrect. The ""Bonus CD"" has all the long versions of the OP/EDs, the video game theme, and Niji. There is also no ""background music"" though some of the credit songs were used in the background of episodes. The CD alone is worth the price, especially if you're a fan of the anime. The DVD contains the OP/ED animations without credits (which are all the 1:30 versions of the songs) and a cheesy music video of Niji with real footage of ocean waves and lots of shots from the series.",1245456000,,552,4.475247524752476
8244190,5,B00126809E,"I love the cd and dvd. The opening and closing theme songs are on the cd, in full length. The dvd has pictures of the show to go with shorter versions of the themes. Plus, there's the song for the new show.
I love them both!",1232236800,,224,3.891304347826087
8244191,5,B00126809E,"I love listening to all of the opening and ending songs whenever I watch the show, and have wanted to get them on CD for the longest time. However, I didn't want to have to get two OSTs in order to own all of the OP/ED songs, especially if they are the TV versions (from what I've managed to find out).  Luckily, this CD solves that problem, and more.

For those who are curious about what exactly this CD has:
the first disk, the CD, has the full-length (not TV-sized) version of ALL of the opening/ending songs, and also includes ""REALIZE"", the opening to the E7 video games, and the 10- minute version of ""Niji"", arguably one of the best songs in the entire series. (it's the song that played during the last episode, before the Epilogue.)
The second disk, the DVD, contains the TV intro/endings, the intro to both of the E7 games, and has a 10-minute special video of Niji.

If you wanted to hear the full versions of your favorite OP/ED song(s), and have them all on the same CD, then this CD/DVD set is well-worth your money.",1212192000,15,1031,4.387434554973822
