8668087,4,B00LU18BG8,"I believe the everything is awesome version contained 3-D Blu-ray. I paid a few bucks for it so I expected the 3-D  now that I'm examining the box it says Blu-ray plus DVD plus bonus 3-D to be quite honest, I don't know what the heck I'm getting with this edition. Why all of a sudden has the manufactory decided to change the wording to trick people? I don't understand if it's in 3-D say it.",1421625600,,393,4.171052631578948

8668089,5,B00LU18BG8,"This Movie is Awesome! I normally eschew ANY toy movie, and passed on the opening of the film. On a flight, this movie was on,and I begrudgingly switched over from my laptop move to The LEGO Movie after the ""No More Mr. Nice Guy Scene"" WOW!! When I got home, I purchased the Blu Ray/ DVD set as soon as I got home and have enjoyed this modern classic several times since.
This film has great family and personal values with an amazing slice of humor thrown into the mix. If you have a (or still are a) child (at heart) give this film a chance...  You will be pleased with the results.",1412899200,,584,4.168141592920354
