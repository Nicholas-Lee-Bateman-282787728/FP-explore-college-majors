8558436,5,B00AWJ45FA,"I was there, as a member of the Cape Kennedy Firing Room launch team from the first unmanned Apollo flights through and to the Apollo 11 Lunar Landing.  This program captures the drama and significance of that time extremely well.  The DVD is astronaut-centric (primarily interviews).  The Astronauts were very knowledgeable guys, who had committed years of their lives, and their very lives, to these extraordinary missions. Cavuto lets them weave their stories into some great video clips.  It was just 65 years from the Wright Brothers flight at Kitty Hawk to the Apollo 8 mission around the moon.  Looking back now 45 years to that mission, it still astonishes what was accomplished.  The DVD opens that window.",1385769600,,715,5.016949152542373
