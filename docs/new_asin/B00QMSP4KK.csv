6876595,4,B00QMSP4KK,Remembering my youth this was a great kids show. Love the marianation like the Thunderbirds. I believe this came first and it is a treat to see these episodes again. One warning they are not in color as the cover art suggests although it does state  black & white on back of cover. Overall a very nice item.,1427328000,,307,4.293103448275862
6876596,5,B00QMSP4KK,"Review is of Fireball XL5: The Complete Series DVD from Shout! Factory release 3/10/2015.
Nice set. B&W episodes in 4:3 pillar box (with vertical black pillars).  No image stretching to fill 16:9 screen.  Basically, this is as a 1962 TV show should be. Hey, it's not the Thunderbirds but is still a lot of fun.  I would recommend this DVD set.

Note: For the Thunderbirds set, I would recommend the Japanese blu ray (Amazon Japan) Thunderbird Blu-ray Collector's BOX.  It is also in correct 4:3 and has the most beautiful remastering I have ever seen.  It's pricey though.",1425945600,10,572,4.785714285714286

6876599,5,B00QMSP4KK,"I haven't bought this, yet, but wish to ask a question here of my fellow Fireball fans.  I rated it anyway, as I know I'll love the set, as I was yet another ""first generation"" fan of the show and have read most of the decidedly positive customer reviews.  I recorded the audio of several episodes off my TV speaker, back in the '60s; built a model rocket I ""designed"" myself (yes, it flew okay); had a plastic XL5 model and the theme music 45 by Don Gray, on 20th Century Fox Records.  Even built a Space City that rotated.

My question:  THIS set was released in 2015 and is listed here as a 5-disc set with a total run time of 950 minutes....with 39 episodes and extras.  Amazon also offers the 2003 5-disc set, for about 10 bucks more, with a run time of 1,014 minutes (a bit over one hour more than this newer release), also with 39 episodes and what appear to be the same(?) features.

Might anyone know the reason(s) for the differences in run time?  Perhaps the older set's description simply failed to include the run time of the extras?  I'd not mind ordering the higher-priced 2003 release, if it does have more material, although that's doubtful.  Thanks.",1475452800,,1167,4.436619718309859

6876605,5,B00QMSP4KK,"Wow, Another puppet show from my days as a kid in the early 1960's. If you remember these shows (or need to remember), these are still fun to watch over 50 years later. If you can remember these shows and liked them, I definitely recommend them to you and your family!!

Want the modern ""today"" version? Pick up ""Team America"" which was written and directed using 3 foot tall puppets by the people that write South Park. That is really funny!! Great political satire.",1461715200,,467,4.559523809523809
6876606,5,B00QMSP4KK,"So many things that were ahead of their time. AWESOME SHOW! I just never did get used to the building that spins, for some reason....",1458691200,,133,4.36
6876607,5,B00QMSP4KK,"This recent re release of the entire Fireball XL5 TV series from /62 is a wonderful addition to anyone's collection. Everyone considers the musical British Invasion,but no one talks about the TV British Invasion which took place before,during and after the musical one;and all courtesy of the brilliant Sylvia and Gerry Anderson. This was no ordinary slap dash puppetry like some others of its day. The show had a sophistication all of its own. The Anderson's pioneered a form of puppetry,tweaking things as they went,that are still being used today. And speaking of sophistication,the soundtracks to all the Anderson's shows were done by Barry Gray. They were,in retrospect, almost too good for this type of show. But such was the artistry and calibre of show(s) the Anderson's produced. Fireball in particular spawned a top 40 single on the charts sung by Don Spence. Now how many shows of any type can boast that?
The premise is simple. Fireball XL5 is the show's main ship(there are XL1,2's,etc) and was piloted by Steve Zodiac,ably assisted by Prof. Matt Matic and Dr. Venus. They are employees of the World Space Patrol and cruise about the heavens maintaining law and order in the galaxy and beyond. All is not serious as every ep has at least one funny incident to it.
While watching it struck me right away that there were some very close resemblances to what would be appearing on Star Trek three years later. Consider these facts:A)The World Space Patrol has a code of conduct when encountering planets and their life just as the crew of the Enterprise would,B)they have a space engineer named Jock who is Scottish just like the Scottie to be in ST, C) in one ep they use a teleportation device that makes them disappear in one location and appear in another,just like ST, D) Prof. Matic uses a viewing/calibrating device very similar to Lt. Sulu(which would rise out of the console),and  E) there is the creature known as a Lazoon,or Zoonie for short on the show(Venus' pet),he already has the suction cup hands, so make his face ugly and you have the salt creature from the 2nd ep of the original ST series! And finally in one ep it shows Space Station Nine. This of course foreshadows Star Trek's Deep Space Nine. Of all the numbers that could have been picked by the Star Trek producers/writers,they picked that number. Coincidence? And that's just some of the causal observations I made,maybe you could find others. I know of no known direct or indirect mention of Fireball XL5 in any ST literature being an inspiration in anyway for that future show. One never knows,do one?
Speaking of Prof. Matt Matics(a play on ""mathematics""),his voice's affectation is almost a direct copy of Walter Brennan's. Brennan was appearing on a very popular TV series in North America at the time called""The Real McCoys"".
And as you watch the show you will hear terms like ""boss"" and ""tootie"".""Boss"" means real gone,great or fab depending on the context in which it is used. And""Tootie"" just means crazy,silly or stupid,again depending on the context.
All in all this was a real treat down memory lane for me. The eps are wonderfully remastered,so much so you can see many of the strings used during its production. When they first aired, all homes viewed this show on sets using an antenna. The pictures were never as crystal clear as they are today with cable,so there was always some fuzziness or snow. Because of that you saw very few strings.
With this five disc single sided set you will get all the b&w eps plus an interview with Mr. Anderson,commentary on two of the eps,a featurette and a PDF printable publicity brochure. Now that's boss!",1455667200,,3646,4.805732484076433

This is a fantastic show! Sure, it is goofy, but it is a fun goofy. I don't really mind that I see the strings or that the effects are not that great. It is actually quite a deep show for what it is. I recommend it for classic sci-fi fans or for children.

P.S. The music in this show is awesome!!",1444521600,,546,4.0

6876626,5,B00QMSP4KK,"I bought these out of nostalgia,  having watched Fireball XL5 as a kid in the 60's, and in hopes that my 4 year old grandson would enjoy them. I was amazed at good these episodes were! Sure, they're marionettes,  and you can see the strings (which lends a kind of ""Team America"" goofiness), but the writing, sets and dramatizations are quite good. And the science is often very accurate, considering that this show predated the US moon launches by about 10 years. One funny quirk is that when the characters leave the spacecraft,  they don't wear spacesuits. They simply take an ""oxygen pill"". This seemingly also makes one impervious to an absolute vacuum and temperatures of minus 270 degrees. Oh well, they are just puppets ... Overall, I am very happy to note that a show I thought was really cool when I was 4 is still fun for my grandson. The stories and production have really held up well over the past 50 years!",1433980800,16,920,4.5636363636363635

6876630,3,B00QMSP4KK,"""Fireball XL5""(1962-1963) was created by Gerry and Sylvia Anderson who also created ""The Thunderbirds"" and ""Space 1999"". The series is set in the years 2062-2063 and featured the missions of spaceship Fireball XL5 and commanded by colonel Steve Zodiac of the World Space Patrol. The World Space Patrol is based on an island somewhere in the South Pacific at Space City. The crew explores the the galaxy and faraway planets and alien beings. One novelty of the show was that the characters never wore space suits, but instead took oxygen pills that enabled them to survive in the vacuum of space. As a kid I loved the outer space adventures, the futuristic spaceship, the sets, and the puppetry. As a trip down memory lane it's fun to watch some of the episodes again. Though as an adult I prefer some of Anderson's other puppetry series, such ""Captain Scarlett and the Mysterons"", and ""The Thunderbirds"".

The series has 39 episodes all of which are in black and white. The actual dvds look very good and seem to be remastered. There are special features including an interview with Gerry Anderson, and a featurette about the making of the Fireball XL5, as well as audio commentary on two of the episodes.",1432944000,9,1205,4.793269230769231
6876631,5,B00QMSP4KK,Just as I remembered.  Not sure if today's kids would appreciate this.  It is probably for those of us revisiting our childhood.,1431129600,,128,4.7727272727272725

6876633,5,B00QMSP4KK,Great 50's Supermarionation(?) puppet sci-fi!,1429833600,,45,8.2
6876634,5,B00QMSP4KK,"Some may see this as crude but this was positively state of the art in 1962. Considering the size and low resolution of the average television screen back then, the production standards far exceeded what was required, so much so that when viewed on a large screen TV today it looks pretty amazing. Keep in mind I am not a big CGI fan however and my eyes see anything done with models and film as much more realistic than CGI could ever hope to be. One of the things I appreciate most about Gerry Anderson productions are how well many of the sets and scenes completely fool the eye into appearing full-scale and real. Sure there are a few comical moments such as the exhaust clouds of Fireball XL5 casting a shadow upon the sky as fireball takes off, and wires galore, but all in all I still think it holds up as a spectacular achievement and without a doubt say no one could recreate anything half as good today.

Even though Fireball XL5 was geared towards children I still find the stories and action quite compelling and enjoyable today. The fine voice actors bring the Supermarionation puppets to life to the point after the first few episodes you almost don't notice them being puppets at times. Barry Gray's music was years ahead of its time and the pop tunes were solid enough to probably have charted nicely had they been released as singles.

When I originally watched the show in the 1960s my favorite part was Robert and watching the show today I find it very amusing that the only noticeable British accent in the show actually belonged to the robot.",1429660800,,1563,4.539007092198582

6876636,4,B00QMSP4KK,Well gotta admit that it's very crude and laughable but I loved it and could sing the theme all these years later (I'm 58 and must have watched about 50 years ago).
