The DVD is advertised as created on demand, which leads me to believe that Pipin himself is burning this disc in his living room. Amazon, what gives? I live in California, and this DVD should have no problem being played. Amazon quickly replaced the first one, and I'm reluctant to try a third time when returning this 2nd one.
