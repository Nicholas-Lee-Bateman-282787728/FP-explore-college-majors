My Parents Are Divorcing

Mis padres se divorcian (1959) isn't that outstanding, but it does feature Libertad Lamarque (Argentine singer and actress) singing five songs, a few of which were written by the great Agustn Lara (Mexican composer). He's even in the film playing the piano while Libertad Lamarque sings. If you ever are in Madrid Spain, be sure to visit the statue of Agustn Lara, it's in the Lavapies neighborhood. The statue was made by the Mexican sculptor Humberto Peraza (he did a lot of bullfighting themes in his statues). It's in Lavapies, a neighborhood that's supposed to be ""rough"", but it wasn't that bad. Just go in the daytime or with a few friends.

One song that is quite beautiful in the film is,

""Amor, amor, amor, naci de ti
 naci de mi, de la esperanza.

 Amor, amor, amor, naci de Dios
 para los dos, naci del alma.

 Sentir que tus besos anidaronen m
 igual que palomas mensajeras de luz.

 Saber que mis besos se quedaron en t
 haciendo en tus labios la seal de la cruz.

 Amor, amor, amor, naci de ti...""

The film is a mixture of comedy, melodrama and songs. It doesn't really excel in any of them and the constant bickering between Diana Valdes (Libertad Lamarque) and Fernando Guerrero (Arturo de Cordova) gets tiring really quick. They even add a daughter, Alicia Guerrero (Martha Mijares) to add tension. All she does is whine about how nobody loves her. There's a 50's rock and roll scene that was annoying. The ending was highly theatrical as well, since the director added an earthquake that kills the servant, Tomasa, and the family all profess their love for each other.

It's pretty much average stuff and the sound is difficult to hear.

8091155,1,B000BQYX2E,"""Mis Padres Se Divorcian"" is a pretty good film showcasing the multitalented Libertad Lamarque displaying her wares as an actress and as a singer in a script that mixes comedy, drama, the battle of the sexes, unforgettable music and 1950s teen culture.  Arturo de Cordova fits Lamarque like a glove as the philandering husband who seems bored by domestic routine.  No wonder  producers paired the two superstars in no fewer than four features which were all big box office hits. Any DVD product starring these two artists should be received with great rejoicing by movie fans everywhere but again the joy has been taken away by a stupid Mexican video firm. This time is Laguna Home Video which in this DVD has turned the plush Eastmancolor, wide screen production into a horrible looking black and white film.  How they get away with crap like this is beyond me so don`t waste your money and always be careful when you purchase a DVD from a Mexican company. They have no respect for consumers.",1265414400,4,993,4.755813953488372
