The three of us are big fans of the Carrert PanAmericana race so I was bummed for giving a non present for Christmas. Too much time had passed from purchase to the giving and hearing from my friends that I did not try for a refund since I have not got them back in the 30 day time allotment.
Trueley disappointed I was really looking forward to watching this movie with them.
I have a VHS copy of the La Carrera Panamerican race that was produced by Nick Mason of Pink Floyd and was hoping to add this to the collection. If you know of anyone who has a copy on DVD of the Nick Mason video I would love to hear about where to get a working copy of it as well as two working copies of the Rebirth of a Legend as well. Thanks for your time.",1520121600,,900,3.977900552486188

8531987,5,B008XAYNMU,"I watched the movie around six months ago and was just captivated by a race this long. I love racing and endurance style (like 24 hours of Daytona or Le Mans) is my favorite. But a 2000 mile race from southern Mexico to northern Mexico on public roads! Come on man! Pink Floyd guitarist David Gilmore actually raced in this event back in '92. They made a movie about it in 92 but it sucked except for the music sound track (Pink Floyd...imagine that!) Personally, I think this race is more interesting and certainly more challenging then Targa Florio in Italy ever was. This race has something for everyone. Like NASCAR? Bill France and Marshall Teague made this run. As did Mickey Thompson, Indy Car drivers Bettenhausen and Unser heck even F1 champ Phil Hill gave 'er go. Director Steffen Schultz must be a racer because he does a fantastic job of capturing the triumph and the heartbreak of this race though the eyes and a U.S. team. Watching this in HD I felt like part of the crew observing the action without annoying ""reality show"" camera in face feel. My wife and kids are not racing fans, however, the loved the personal feel on this movie. Something for everyone here for sure. I highly recommend this movie! Get it and you'll love it! Plus it's just in time for the next race on 19-25Oct 2012!!!!",1348617600,3,1307,4.5423728813559325
