8391884,3,B00391129K,"What can I say about this lost curiosity from Mexico that, was written (co-written by Jose Revueltas), and directed by Emilio 'el Indio' Fernandez (American audiences may know him from: ""The Wild Bunch"" 1969, and ""Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia"" 1974), and released in 1976. ""Zona Roja"" (""Red Light District""), featured an all-star cast: Fanny Cano, Armando Silvestre, Victor Junco, Maria Sorte, and Emilio Fernandez, along with a bevy of beautiful and buxom women. Popular 'vedettes' from the 70's and 80's like: Grace Renat, Lina Michel, Yolanda Rigel, Mora Escudero, Gabriela Rios, etc., etc. Mr. Fernandez had a prolific career as a director (1942 - 1979), and actor. Here he was trying very hard to recapture Mexico's 'golden age' (40's and 50's). Albeit, without the censorship of that era.

Let me summarize the plot for you: an escaped prisoner 'Juan' (Armando Silvestre), who's in love with one of the girls 'Leonor' (Fanny Cano) from 'El Paraiso' (brothel/cabaret/Mexico), robs a bank, in order to pay-off the debt that 'Leonor' owes the brothel owner 'La Madame' (Venetia Vianello), before they run away together, with 'the Law/Latifundista' (Victor Junco) in hot pursuit. They are then given asylum by 'Pancho' (Emilio Fernandez), in a lush tropical oasis. Literary motifs which are never easy to adapt to film, were lost in the uneven and incoherent plot (sloppy editing too).

What Mr. Fernandez was trying to say (under the radar of the Mexican-censors), and highly disguised as another 'brothel/cabaret' picture was this: 'Juan and Leonor' (dispossessed Mexican peasants) who are beholden to 'La Madame' (foreign interests) and 'The Law/Latifundistas' (wealthy landowners), are given asylum by 'Pancho' (Zapatista and nationalist ideals), but could not break free from the yoke of the past (Colonial and U.S. sponsorship).

BTW: This metaphor can be applied to every Latin American nation, for that matter. (For more on this read Eduardo Galeano's ""The Open Veins of Latin America"".)

Unfortunately, the soap-opera style of acting which was common to Mexican films of this era, blurred the meaning altogether. The film was produced by 'Conacine' (which I believe was either wholly or partially state-owned), and plenty of nudity was provided by the women (in order to insure a decent box-office return, of course!). The film runs about 96 mins., but I believe the film may have been longer and could well have been cut by the watchful eye of the state-censors (the film came to an abrupt end after 'Leonor' returned to 'El Paraiso'). The film was shot in the state of Guerrero (Acapulco) but had an Afro-Caribbean (Cuban) feel to it. This is especially true, during the dance-number (by Meche Carre&ntilde;o), in 'El Paraiso'. Overall, this film has tremendous value, if only as a relic and curiosity from a lost and bygone-era in the history of Mexican Cinema. The DVD is by Zima Entertainment. NTSC format, Spanish (no English subtitles), NR 96 mins. the picture and sound quality is good but not great. Someone should restore these films, and release them in their proper aspect ratio too! Maybe I should start my own film distribution co.?

Love and Peace,

ALL THIS BEAUTY SERVES AS A SHOCKING CONTRAST TO THE STORY OF THE WOMEN OF THE NIGHT. LIFE HAS HANDED LEONOR, THE PROTAGONIST, MEXICO'S EXCELLENT DRAMATIC ACTRESS Ms. FANNY CANO, A FATE SHE CAN NOT ESCAPE. EQUALLY GOOD IS Mr. ARMANDO SILVESTRE, JUAN WHO IS A FUGITIVE OF THE LAW & WANTED FOR MURDER. INCLUDING AN EXCELLENT SUPPORTING CAST, WORTH MENTIONING Ms. MERCEDES CARRENO, A DANCER AT THE BAR ""EL PARAISO"", THIS LADY PERFORMS A 15 MINUTE AFRO-MAMBO, VOO-DOO DANCE NUMBER IN WHICH HER BODY & SOUL SEEM POSESSED TO A CLIMATIC ECSTASY BY THE EXOTIC BEAT OF THE DRUMS. DIRECTED BY Mr. EMILIO ""INDIO"" FERNANDEZ, A MASTER FROM MEXICO'S FIRST & SECOND GOLDEN ERA OF CINEMA, THE MOVIE PLAYS LIKE A CLASSIC FILM NOIR IN COLOR. NOT FOR THOSE OFFENDED BY EXPLICIT NUDITY & DEFINETLY NOT FOR CHILDREN, BUT FOR A MATURE AUDIENCE THAT APPRECIATES A WELL TOLD DRAMATIC STORY.",1298246400,,1250,5.415384615384616
