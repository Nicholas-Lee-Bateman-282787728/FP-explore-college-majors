7016602,1,B00TPN7DVC,"I watched this on Starz. The lack of intelligence was mind numbing.

1) Stop making everything about race. No one cares about race anymore except people that need  scapegoats. If a white person is a good R&B singer, and they make good music, good for them. Who gives a s*** what their race is. They didn't ""steal"" anything.

2) Victims need bad guys. If you've got a ""victim mentality,"" then you'll need people to blame for your victimhood, and you'll make streeeeeeeeches to find them, even if it's just some teenie boppers that like Adam Levine (evil oppressive culter steeing enablers).

3) In a free market, the best talents win. No one gave a s*** about Jim Hendrix's race. They didn't say, ""Look at that black man stealing the electric guitar from the white folk."" He was good, so the market bought what he sold.

The race colored glasses some people wear is a disease that hurts those people the most. This movie feeds that disease.",1462579200,2,939,4.632530120481928
7016603,3,B00TPN7DVC,"That's just about the size of it, not worth talking about because it don't go into details or in other words, grip you or glue you to your seat.",1459296000,,144,4.0
7016604,5,B00TPN7DVC,The film offered great insight into the appropriation of Black Culture and not understanding or giving the originators their true respect.  The idea of being an uninvited guest into the culture and not having the courtesy to say thank you and much appreciated; but somehow putting your own stamp on it as being authentic...Good Honest Stuff.,1459209600,3,341,5.089285714285714
7016605,3,B00TPN7DVC,"Same story now in different times.. James Brown said that this is a Man World. The White Man's world, even white Women complained, that there tiered of men tell them how and what to do with their bodies and minds..",1457136000,3,214,4.375

7016608,5,B00TPN7DVC,Such an inspiring piece that should be broadly distributed... Great work!,1451347200,2,73,5.7272727272727275
7016609,4,B00TPN7DVC,Naturally you will not agree with everything that is said but for the most part I agreed with this documentary. I have coworkers who do not see the influence of African Culture on modern society.,1447718400,6,195,4.6
7016610,5,B00TPN7DVC,"I am not so empressed by what these young people are doing today. However this young man has made a magnificent statement with this film. He has shown that the need for African American to protect there cultual gifts is mandatory and market those gifts to the benefit of themselves and not others is evident.  Over the course of say 100 or so years his people have made outsiders wealthy to the detrament of his own community.  In the film there is an interview, with TI who is marketing his newest find. I went onto the net to see what her talent was and she had none. And while I like TI, does he realize what he is doing?  Banner made a point when it was shown that the biggest R&B singers where not Black anymore, that the new rappers will eventually come from elsewhere, that the top multi millionaires were, LOL, well that one is nothing new.  Young people don't need this film if they would consult with the intelligent portions of the previous generation. Cause while what he has to say is nothing new, they would have at least got a heads up.",1445040000,7,1051,4.374358974358974

8702671,5,B00TPN7DVC,"If you every wanted to watch a docu about the subject of racial appropriation, this is the one. I would recommend watching this, and then go watch Get Out, and you will understand things a whole lot better if your new to this subject. People, especially in America, need to know the true origins of the things today they take so for granted. Knowledge is power!",1522972800,,361,4.484848484848484

8702677,3,B00TPN7DVC,"Not produced very well, unorganized, and stretched a little too thin for an hour-long documentary. They are well-intentioned and well-read with their overview of black music being appropriated, but can only glance over other aspects of black culture. Not confident in anyone's expertise over these topics either. It's an odd assortment of featured commentators.",1471305600,,361,5.703703703703703

8702680,5,B00TPN7DVC,"True true black people as a culture has given away so much with out a thank you or acknowledgement from other cultures that copy take or claim its theirs but when anything comes from Chinese, European, Hispanic, east Asian ,,they will let you know its from their culture and you give honor to them first but when they take from the black culture they never look back and act like they don't have a clue where it came from! Black people stop giving us away say its ours and make people respect it",1462838400,5,495,4.333333333333333
