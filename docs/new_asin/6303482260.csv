7848457,3,6303482260,"This is a good introduction to the sights and history of Prague.  The tape is a little shorter than the advertised 30 minutes, and it would help if they occasionally printed the names of buildings on the screen since it's not easy to understand words like Hradcany or Vltava just from hearing them.  I would recommend this video to people wanting to know what things they should visit on a vacation in Prague.  The videos for Budapest and Vienna are equally worthwhile.",1031097600,9,469,4.695121951219512
