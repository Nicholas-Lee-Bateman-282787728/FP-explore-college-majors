8356933,5,B001E6RFS4,This is a well-acted and suspenseful as well as historically accurate film starring Anthony Hopkins.  It proved very illustrative of key themes to my Global History class at a community college.  It brought the 1381 revolt vividly to life for my students.  Highly recommended.,1498003200,,276,5.2272727272727275
