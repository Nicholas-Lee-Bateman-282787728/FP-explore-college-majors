8610030,5,B00EWCQM6S,"""Way of Life:"" this documentary is powerful. What a wake-up call! [...] and Michael Daube are the new model because one person, in this case Michael Daube, a fine artist, is making a lasting life-verses-death difference for communities - a difference that will flourish for many generations! In a complex and sometimes cynical and corrupt world, I came away feeling that one person really can make a difference in so many lives, especially when ""one person"" collaborates with the sick and poor, citizens, governments, celebrities and most importantly: each of us willing to give whatever monetary amount we can because Citta delivers a thousand fold, to create on-going miracles. Way to go!",1400976000,2,690,5.169642857142857

8610032,5,B00EWCQM6S,"I like the fact that the filmmakers show such respect for the actual process of development of a person, the many things that shape his coming to do what he does, the aspect of serendipity, so-called chance, the spiritual, coincidence - which Einstein said was God's way of remaining anonymous - the artist's early life, playing in the creek, his feeling for the seemingly random objects in his world, his friendships and family. I liked the fact that the projects unfolded without what we would call a plan and without someone coming in to these communities and trying to impose a previously formed idea on them. It was also interesting that the projects seemed impossible at some points.",1392854400,2,689,4.8474576271186445
