2160685,5,B00062DKMM,My girls started using this at age 1. My 4yo still loves it. We do yoga almost every morning to start our day. Be advised this is designed around very young children with short attention spans. Do not expect traditional yoga.

I think I was expecting a start to finish yoga program, but maybe I'm just thinking of it from an adults perspective. My kids seemed to engage in the video well enough, though they have not asked to watch it again whereas they do ask to watch the OnDemand kids yoga programming that is available to us through our cable subscription and that program has less of the animal pictures and other imagery and is more dedicated to completing the movements.",1443657600,,561,4.456310679611651

Maybe this is good for a 2 year old. But my girls want to do ""Mommy Yoga"", which is Jillian Micheals Yoga Meltdown (they do level 1) which is fast paced and entertaining (although I play music over Jillian talking since she's not always child-appropriate ""Who's your Daddy!!??"" which is fine since it's an adult DVD).",1434326400,,470,4.476744186046512

2160827,1,B00062DKMM,"Based on the cover, description, targeted age of audience, and reviews, I thought this would be a fun and upbeat yoga exercise video with clear songs where my son would hopefully get interested in exercising/stretching (since he loves animals) in pretending to ""be"" an animal, pose like them, etc and learn to breathe properly. I found this video actually depressing and my son didn't care for it at all. The music, instructor, and kids are so serious even when they're supposedly being silly, there's a few images of animals here and there, along with other poses like tree, warrior, triangle, volcano, etc. I also can understand ""respect for nature"" and would want to teach that to my child, however, I don't appreciate all the mysticism of ""mother earth,"" other gods, and ugly relief images of warriors, etc for this age group thrown in there. It's very new age-y, but if you like that sort of thing and want your kids chanting ""om"" then I guess this might be right for you. The one positive thing I can say about it is that they did have a good idea for putting a toy on a child's stomach while they're lying down to teach deep breathing and show how it moves up and down.",1411171200,,1176,4.55188679245283

2160829,5,B00062DKMM,Super fun for the whole family. It's helped my son work on his core and myself honestly. There are poses for every level and it's done in a fun way so that kids are willing to do it.,1406592000,,182,3.8157894736842106
2160830,2,B00062DKMM,"the instructions are ok but my 4yo daughter got lost watching the animals between poses and forgot that she was supposed to be doing them. too many interruptions for this age group. She would do a pose then sit back to watch the animal segments. Don't understand the award winning claim on this, nor the misleading phrase ""follow-the-leader approach with safe, expert instruction"" as the woman the ""leads"" is rarely seen in the video - it always just one child showing the pose, sometimes two. Waste of money.",1404777600,,509,4.795454545454546
2160831,2,B00062DKMM,"Unfortunately too slow-moving for my 3 year old nephew and a bit too ""hippy"" / ""crunchy"" for even my rather liberal taste.",1404777600,,122,4.590909090909091
2160832,1,B00062DKMM,This is not something you can let your child do on their own. You have to watch and monitor the cold hardcore.,1404518400,,110,4.045454545454546
2160833,5,B00062DKMM,"I got this as a gift for my 18month old and so did my sister.  My daughter watched it and briefly participated lightly,  my niece didn't care,  she's 2. Now 2 years old and 2 and 1/2 years old they better participate.

My 2 year old loves the silly to calm DVD.  She does most of it,  but doesn't care much for the breathing exercises. She can easily do the moves and they don't spend too much time on a single move,  so she doesn't loose interest.  Although there may be a bit to much time between moves. She's a little more willing to learn and patient than my niece.

My 2 and 1/2 year old niece doesn't get passed the first 5 minutes,  but she is much more energetic and her attention span is pretty short.

I guess my point is to show that it does make a difference what kind of children you are buying these for.  And it took us several times of watching it with me doing the moves before either children caught on. So don't expect to bring it home, put it on and have your children suddenly to be doing breathing exercises on your loving room floor.  Take the time to show them and work with them, even if it takes months, and they will get it.  We put it down for a bit and tried again and now we do it at least once a day in my house! They love it!",1403568000,,1257,3.995983935742972

2160870,5,B00062DKMM,"My children (2 and 3 yrs) love this, more than I thought they would. They ask for it regularly and try a lot of the activities. It has many different poses, though they don't use the real names for many of the poses. They don't hold them too long. They have some focus on breathing and calming down. My kids have started calling themselves yogakids which is cute. they both have favorite poses, my daughter loves butterfly and my son  likes triangle pose. The poor cat isn't enjoying the roaring like a lion though....",1386374400,,518,4.51063829787234
2160871,2,B00062DKMM,"This was as disjointed as a yoga video could be.  Each pose is introduced with a voice over from a kid and the text written on the picture of a sunflower.  Then Mrs. Yoga talks about something, not always the pose at hand, and a kid does the pose.  Then more pictures, a song, and a new pose is introduced.  It gave me a headache watching it.  BUT, for some inexplicable reason, my two and a half year old who was running around the room during the first viewing asked to have the video play again.  He did do down dog when the video did down dog, but that was it.  It didn't hold his attention or mine for that matter.",1379894400,,619,4.066115702479339

2160895,2,B00062DKMM,"I had hoped to use this DVD with my kindergarten class, but there isn't any ""routine"" to it... it's just a collection of individual yoga moves.  It shows kids doing the moves, which is cute, but beware of that too because the kids look to be 3 or 4 years old, and my kindergarteners (oh-so-much-older at 5 and 6... ;P) would have objected strongly to doing a ""baby"" video.  There is also a lot of singing involved -- for the poses I saw (say, downward facing dog) there would be a picture of something similar in nature (in this case, a dog), then a song about dogs, then the actual yoga pose.  This video was way too slow and choppy to work in a classroom, where I only can spare fifteen or twenty minutes to the whole ""morning exercises"" endeavor anyway and want the kids to come out calmer rather than sillier.  It probably would be okay in a home situation, but didn't work for my purposes.  I ended up buying the Namaste Kids DVDs Yoga Motion and Once Upon a Mat instead, and those worked out great.",1373414400,,1004,4.319148936170213

Old music, old methods.  Maybe I was taught a different Vinyasa, or it's changed over the years but even the names of the poses were off the mark.  Even my daughter said her yoga teacher at preschool called them different names.  We were excited to do it together, but we both disappointed in the video. :(",1370217600,,478,4.630952380952381

2160903,5,B00062DKMM,"I chose this beginner yoga dvd for my 5 year old grand daughter because my now 19 year old daughter loved it so much as a youngester. My daughter remembers the vhs tape as being fun, and she credits it with being responsible for her scoring a goal at her soccer game because she did her ""yoga tape right before the game'. A cherished memory for her. So when my grand daughter expressed interest in doing yoga with me, this dvd was the obvious choice. I am happy to report that she LOVES this dvd as much as my daughter did so many years ago. And would you believe that they have the same two favorite poses? Turtle and Lion pose. There's about 7 or 8 poses demostrated for the children by children, with some narration through the pose about how to relate to the pose or how the pose can help in daily life. Not so much how to do the pose. The narrator does tell the kids to just keep practicing, it will get easier. There are also some breating exercises that are nice also, deep cleansing breaths at the beginning, and ""bunny breathing"" near the end of the tape. Throughout the dvd there is some narration about nature and the way humans and nature relate to each other; the narrator does a good job here also. At the end of the dvd they of course say namaste to each other, and the narrator does a great job of explaining why they say this.  So, soothing narration, children demonstrating the poses, some fun moments, some educational moments, and breathing exercises, make this a 5 star dvd for this family.  Hope this helps the future yogis out there.",1355097600,,1556,4.380622837370242

Everyone's description is accurate with the ABC descriptions but I figured there would be a ""Cat Stretch,"" ""Down Dog"" or ""Warrior"" or something to do with yoga. Instead she acts like they are driving a car, hot air balloon or a worm. They don't even keep the letter on the screen, so it's not helping with learning the alphabet either.

2160936,5,B00062DKMM,"I first rented this DVD from our local library, then decided to buy it because my two sons (ages 6 and 4) love it so much!  My older son has ADHD and sensory processing disorder, and in general has difficulty moving his body through space efficiently.  This DVD promotes learning in a natural way--the movement/poses are very child-centered, and do a wonderful job of building up self-esteem.  My son loves the part at the end where she (Marsha) says, ""You are a calm, peaceful, and magnificent child.""  What an incredible message to give to children, especially those with ADHD who probably rarely feel calm and peaceful! My son told me, ""Mommy, this makes my heart tickle.""  I'm not sure I understand the reviews that disparage the DVD because it does not have enough ""routine.""  Children are not little adults--I think any teacher would realize that the spacing and balance between video/poses/instruction is absolutely spot-on for children.  For instance, why would the volcano pose be introduced without images of a volcano?  That connection is imperative for children, and makes the learning REAL.
At any rate, I am a big fan and would highly recommend this DVD as well as the other two volumes to anyone with young children.",1316995200,,1231,4.913043478260869

I work full time and I am in school part time so she mainly does it while my Mom or husband is watching her.) But she likes the music and likes trying to do the poses.  It is SOOO worth $10.  Think about how much you spend on toys or junk food.... this is way more beneficial to your child than an afternoon at McD's. And it is alot cheaper than going to the Zoo or Children's museum! Plus this is part of a foundation for your child to see that working out and being pysical can be fun.

2160966,5,B00062DKMM,"My daughter is two-and-a-half, and she loves this video.

~PARTICIPATION~

My daughter was already interested in yoga, so I wanted to find a program she could do by herself. I hoped this video would help her exercise a bit more.

The first couple times she watched it, she was nervous and intimidated. But as she got used to the video, and as she felt more comfortable with it (you know how toddlers adore repetition), she began to participate. She now follows along with the entire video, and she wants to do it every day. She's actually pretty great at yoga, especially considering she's a tiny kid!

~FORMAT~

Each pose is a separate segment, and each pose mimics an animal (snake pose, flamingo pose, etc.). So, as other reviews have mentioned, it's not a fluid routine. But my kid is two years old -- she couldn't do an uninterrupted routine on her own. She loves watching and mimicking the animals; it keeps her engaged and makes her excited about doing the poses. It's not a chore or an exercise for her -- it's a fun game. That's a plus in my book.

~RELIGIOUS OVERTONES~

There's not much Hinduism in the video, but there's some New-Age or visualization sentiments -- but nothing extreme, indoctrinating, or weird. It's more like, ""Imagine you're holding the hands of every child on earth and together you create world peace..."" (not verbatim) or ""Listen to the sound of your breath inside of you, flowing like the wind, like the waves... you are one with the breeze, the waves, the birds. You are love"" (close to verbatim).

The end of the video might cause concern, but it's fairly tame. The kids do a meditation pose and chant ""Ohm"" repeatedly. The teacher explains (verbatim), ""Did you know that everything has an energy? The yogis say that Ohm is the sound of all things -- kids, grown-ups, rocks, animals, trees, plants, and people are working together in harmony and peace. This is the sound of Ohm. Ohm: One sound, one people. That sounds beautiful.""

Then the kids sing, ""I am you and you are me; I am part of all I see. Namaste. Namaste. Namaste. I am the light and the light is me. Namaste. Namaste."" [etc]",1297728000,,2126,4.618037135278515
2160967,1,B00062DKMM,"I bought this for my 5 year old daughter with ADHD.  A lot of the video she looked at me and asked ""What now?"".

The pose last only a minute then the video moves on to fast moving, very distracting scene or animal to introduce the next pose.

My child started out doing well and then...the fast pace and variety of animals got him going again and apparently it is more entertaining to run around like a lion than to keep switching gears and slow back down for the next pose.

I was hoping that at some point they would put the yoga poses all together to form a cohesive routine, but no such luck.  There is just too much video with no poses - certainly more than half!

My child liked watching the DVD, but did not participate (perhaps at a later time?).  However, my child, who does not watch much t.v., would watch the news if I let him.

The picture on the screen goes from a child doing a pose to an image of an animal or something else and leaves you waiting too long until the next pose comes up. Would have liked to see a yoga routine at the end using all the poses together that my kids could follow through and repeat on their own.,1141689600,,557,4.072727272727272
2161175,3,B00062DKMM,"My boys often see me working out at home to various DVDs, including yoga.  My four year old (who is still at home with me during the day) often attempts various exercises, but quits when the grown-up routines get ""too hard"".  I bought Yoga Kids to encourage him with exercise at a child's ability level.

Yoga Kids was definitely kid-friendly.  The catchy songs and animal shots were entertaining and kept my son's interest.  The poses were not too difficult and I could tell he was enjoying the fact that he could do most of them.

I really would have liked the DVD if it weren't for the uncomfortable spiritualist ""yoga theology"" infused throughout it.  I'm sure it would be subtle to some people, but I just can't get used to the idea of my kid sitting cross-legged in a meditative position chanting ""Om"".

Call me a traditionalist, it's just not for me.",1138752000,,857,4.592105263157895
2161206,5,B00062DKMM,"I bought these for my daughter after I was trying to do my yoga tapes and noticed that me daughter was trying it too. My tapes didn't hold her interest so I thought I'd give these a try. What a hit!!! I do it with her, too. We are both enjoying them. She asks for it by name... ""Yoga kids! Yoga kids!"". I've caught her doing some of the poses and breathing even when the DVD isn't running. Hoping she'll have healthier habits than her mommy!!! :)",1138492800,,446,4.137931034482759
2161207,5,B00062DKMM,"This dvd is great fun.  My kids (5 1/2 and 3 y.o) beg to ""do Yoga"".  I like it that they are moving while watching a show.  I have found them imitating the yoga positions even when not watching, just while playing together.  I recommend this product.",1127174400,,250,4.25531914893617
2161208,2,B00062DKMM,"I found this video to be disappointing.  It mainly just goes from pose to pose without much ease in transition. Also, the music isn't very inspiring for children.

Although it did spark the interest for my children they weren't ga-ga over it.  They prefer my grown up yoga video's to this kid's one(my children are 4 & 7).",1125878400,,322,4.517241379310345
2161209,5,B00062DKMM,"We love this dvd!  I have 5 and 8 year old girls.  The eight year old had been doing this since she was one and we don't even do it on a really regular basis (as we should).  Marsha produced a yoga video some years ago and it was terrific, too.  I wish she would put that one out as a dvd. We lent it out and used it until is was scratchy.  It is also worth having.  This new one has more poses, though.  Even my husband does this with the kids!  A great buy!  Get your kids their own yoga mat and blocks and they will really get into it.",1116028800,,538,3.732142857142857
