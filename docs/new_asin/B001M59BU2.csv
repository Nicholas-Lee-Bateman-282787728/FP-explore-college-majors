8320481,4,B001M59BU2,"This is a reasonably well made video ( it won't win any Oscars) that carefully and throughly explains the Canon 40D.

Each button and feature in is explained in simple clear manner.

I have found one mistake however. They explain how to put your focus screen on a grid setting and they state that they have used this setting in architectural photos.

There is a setting in the camera that says "" Grid display"", On/Off. This setting does nothing. I first tried it and it didn't work. I then took it to Canon professional who called Canon and discussed this setting with them. They all agree that having an electronic grid is not possible on this camera. I am puzzled as to why this was so throughly discussed in the video.

Other than this one flaw, this is a very useful and worthwhile product.",1388448000,,794,4.493055555555555
