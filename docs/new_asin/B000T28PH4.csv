2892150,5,B000T28PH4,Barack Obama has had a very fascinating life. This documentary was very informative and really gave you good perspective of where he came from and how it formed who he is today. This is a very limited updated version to include the Presidential race. I cannot wait until a true Presidential race and Election biography comes out!,1226188800,12,329,4.7894736842105265
2892151,2,B000T28PH4,"I can't imagine buying this lightweight biography of Barack Obama.  I was interested to learn about the man's childhood and his rise to power, but found myself wanting a good deal more.  For one thing, there's little critique at all.  I'm an ardent Obama supporter, but I would have appreciated a more well-rounded discussion.  Furthermore, the producers might have bothered to discuss his legislation, his political philosophy, and his place with regard to the major issues of the day.  But no mention of 9/11, fiscal policies, war, or health care.  Very little is offered other than some biography about the man's family.  In a sense, this video exempflifies the deplorably shallow state of US journali$m today.  Afraid to ask questions of power, US info-tainment ends up only serving power.",1223769600,3,793,5.093023255813954
2892152,5,B000T28PH4,"The Barack Obama Biography was excellent. I intend to show it to everyone who has any doubts of his past.

He has excellent credentials. He is a brilliant man.

I guess if I had one thing to say about the video that I did not like...it would be it was not updated.  They leave you at his election to the Senate.  I would have liked to see it at least up to his entry into the Presidential Race.

Regardless, it was well worth the money and I enjoyed the biography very much.",1218067200,2,474,4.108695652173913
2892153,1,B000T28PH4,"I wish that this biography had more NEW information in it versus what is already easily publicly available via a Google search.  Also, it seems a bit like a plug for Obama versus a factual account of his life and history.",1217548800,17,221,4.390243902439025
2892154,5,B000T28PH4,This is a very well constructed documentary that gives us a glimpse into the man behind one of the most historic candidacies for President that this country has ever seen. A balanced and insightful piece that is a great introduction to this rising star in American politics.,1216252800,9,274,4.851063829787234
2892155,5,B000T28PH4,"AS THOUGH IN ANTICIPATION OF A MAY 19, 2008 NEWSWEEK MAGAZINE FRONT COVER ENTITLED: ""THE O-TEAM: OBAMA HAS SHOWN HE CAN RUN A CAMPAIGN, HE'D BETTER GET READY FOR A WAR,""

ON MAY 7, 2008, IN AN ABC NEWS ARTICLE: ""THE NOTE: `FIGHT IS OVER': CLINTON NEEDED BIG VICTORY, OBAMA EMERGED,"" BY RICK KLEIN WITH MIKE ELMORE:

 FOLLOWING THE NORTH CAROLINA VICTORY BY OBAMA, IT WAS INDICATED:

 ""BARACK OBAMA NOT ONLY NEARLY CLINCHED THE DEMOCRATIC
 NOMINATION TUESDAY NIGHT.

 HE ALSO ANSWERED A BIG QUESTION ABOUT THE FALL CAMPAIGN,  JONATHAN ALTER WRITES: ""THE GLASS JAW THAT HILLARY CLINTON AND
 JOHN MCCAIN THOUGHT THEY SAW TURNED OUT TO BE AN ILLUSION.  IN
 THE JINGLE OF THE OLD TIMEX WATCH ADS, HE TOOK A LICKING AND
 KEPT ON TICKING.""

THE MAY 19, 2008 NEWSWEEK EDITORIAL RAISED THE QUESTION ""CAN THE O-TEAM WITHSTAND AN ONSLAUGHT FROM JOHN MCCAIN AND THE REPUBLICANS, WHO'VE BEEN BIDING THEIR TIME WHILE THE DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN ROUGHING EACH OTHER UP?""

 THOUGH ALSO INDICATING THAT ""PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGNS
  EVENTUALLY SETTLE INTO CONTRASTING NARRATIVES OF THE

 CANDIDATES BIOGRAPHIES, CHARACTER AND IDEOLOGY"" AND THAT
 BARACK OBAMA IN QUESTIONING THE VALUE OF HILLARY CLINTON'S
 ""WASHINGTON EXPERIENCE,"" CONTENDED ""THAT HIS WIDE-RANGING
 BACKGROUND HAS IMBUED HIM WITH SUPERIOR JUDGMENT.""

BARACK OBAMA'S ""BIOGRAPHY,"" PUBLISHED IN 2007 PRIOR TO HIS 2008 CAMPAIGN, IS AN EXCELLENT COVERAGE OF THAT ""WIDE-RANGING BACKGROUND.""

AS THE MAY 19, 2008 TIME MAGAZINE IN THE ARTICLE, ""HOW HE LEARNED TO WIN"" BY MICHAEL WEISSKOPF, CHICAGO, INDICATED:  ""TROUNCED IN HIS FIRST BIG RACE (AGAINST FORMER ILLINOIS BLACK PANTHER PARTY CO-FOUNDER, BOBBY RUSH), BARACK OBAMA RETOOLED AND WON A SENATE SEAT.  HOW THE WARD POLITICS IN CHICAGO GAVE OBAMA  AN EDUCATION THAT HAS EARNED HIM A SHOT AT THE PRESIDENCY.""

I BELIEVE THAT THIS DVD BRINGS OUT ""THE BASIC THEMES"" REFERRED TO BY OBAMA'S CHIEF POLITICAL AND MEDIA ADVISER, A CHICAGO CONSULTANT NAMED DAVID AXELROD, ""THE KING OF CHICAGO POLITICAL CONSULTANTS,"" INDICATED, IN THE NEW YORK TIMES MAGAZINE, APRIL 1, 2007 ARTICLE:  ""OBAMA'S NARRATOR"":

 "" ... ONE OF THE REASONS BUSH HAS SUCCEEDED IN TWO ELECTIONS,"" AXELROD SAYS, ""IS THAT IN HIS OWN ROUGH-HEWN WAY HE HAS CONVEYED A SENSE OF THIS IS WHO I AM, WARTS AND ALL.""  ... ""AXELROD HAS WORKED THROUGH OBAMA'S LIFE STORY AGAIN AND AGAIN, SCOURING IT FOR USABLE POLITICAL MATERIAL AND HE BELIEVES THAT SOME BASIC THEMES COME THROUGH:

""THAT HE IS ""NOT WEDDED TO ANY IDEOLOGICAL FRAME OR DOGMA,""

THAT HE IS ""AN OUTSIDER RATHER THAN SOMEONE WHO'S SPENT YEARS IN THE DENS OF GEORGETOWN,""

THAT HE IS AN ""AGENT FOR CHANGE"" AND HAS THE OPTIMISM AND DYNAMISM OF A FRESH YOUNG FACE.""

2892156,5,B000T28PH4,"Nope!  Uhn-uhn!  No way!  Since I plan on getting on my knees and begging Obama for a job should he become president, I can't sink my critical fangs into this like I would for other productions.  I volunteered for Obama's 2004 campaign and I'm very proud that he represents my state.  But here are some items that may be helpful to other viewers.

For those asking, ""Who is this Obama guy and where did he come from?"", this will answer many of those questions.  It spells out his stellar credentials and demonstrates why it is sensible that he'd run for the White House.  This work gave me visual images for facts about which I only heard.  I heard that Obama's sister was part-Asian and this documentary allowed me to see her.  She pronounces her brother's first name with a Southeast Asian staccato instead of the American schwa on the first syllable.  I've never been to Kenya and you get beautiful shots of that country here.

Many installations in the ""Biography"" series are overly gushy and I wonder if the subject demanded that in order to be interviewed.  Here, rather than sitting in front of A&E's cameras, Obama is interviewed in profile and there's no way to tell if he was only speaking to that cable channel.  The work mentions low points for him.  It states that his first autobiography got ""lukewarm reviews"" and that Bobby Rush beat him substantially in a congressional election.

The work doesn't shy away from the fact that two of Obama's election rivals were felled by sex scandals.  However, I didn't think they critiqued Alan Keyes enough.  Keyes never lived in Illinois until his campaign, yet previously criticized Hilary Clinton for moving to and running in New York.  Keyes upset many when he called Mary Cheney a ""selfish hedonist,"" yet his own daughter shares an identity with Ms. Cheney.

The work ends with individuals saying Obama could run for president, but it does not mention the launch of his presidential campaign, so it must have been produced for that time.  The work has diverse interviewees in terms of race, gender, and age.  The work emphasizes that Obama was one of the few Blacks in Hawaii, yet it never states that the state is very diverse and is the first majority-minority state in the nation.",1194134400,38,2242,4.724226804123711

2892158,2,B000T28PH4,It started off really well.  Got a little choppy and then ended abruptly.  Almost as the rest of the information didn't get transferred to the DVD.  Very strange.  I would be a little concerned about purchasing another DVD made by Bio.,1325721600,,235,4.658536585365853

2892160,4,B000T28PH4,"I will start by saying that I have been a huge supporter of Barack Obama, and was a big participant during his campaign. I love most anything that furthers his message and his cause, but this wasn't my favorite. Some of the other reviews have said it better, and I feel it's a bit overpriced for what you get. I think the ""Biography"" labeling is not so accurate either.",1239580800,,369,4.36231884057971

2892163,5,B000T28PH4,"If you get this DVD, make sure to get the most recent one- the inaugural edition (added footage to previous edition)-good bio that was there a couple of years before all the others even came out!",1234569600,3,195,4.444444444444445
2892164,3,B000T28PH4,"I share the same opinion as many who've seen this DVD. I mean it's alright, but I feel like I wanted to see something that confronted the issues and ideals of the campaign AND talked about his personal story. I've been following and working on Obama's campaign from the very start, and I have to say that it's been a long journey to success. I think that the best DVD I've seen so far has been President Barack Obama: The Man and His Journey. Vivendi Entertainment put it out, and it is really informative and comprehensive. It has the song by Brian McKnight, ""Yes We Can,"" and of course his life story and the road to Congress. There are really good interviews and special features in general, too. Mainly, the story is presented in such a well rounded way, that I was even more impressed AFTER I watched it at how incredible Obama and the campaign have been. It officially comes out Inauguration Day--January 20th, I believe.",1231977600,2,927,4.5568862275449105

2892166,5,B000T28PH4,"This is very well put together. If you don't respect Obama before you see this, you will after you watch it.

It's crazy how far he has come considering the things he faced growing up. It may not look hard to most, but I'm sure for him it was difficult. It is inspirational for me to see a man with his background rise to be the highest office of the land. Nice bio work.",1401667200,,400,3.950617283950617

The problem I had with it is the bad THINGS Obama HAS DONE........THEY WERE OF COURSE OMITTED......Of course they would, being that the intention was fully to make him look good........BAD? He sponsors another invasion of a country, a coup in Honduras, giving arms to the rebels to ""HELP(?)"" Syria......Now helping bastards to STEAL our Social Security, droning and terrorizing nations like Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen, and the list goes on how really BAD he is for America and the WORLD!!!",1366416000,,502,5.134146341463414
