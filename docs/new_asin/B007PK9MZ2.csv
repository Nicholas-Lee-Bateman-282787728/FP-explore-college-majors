But at least we have them. Thank you, bob",1399334400,,117,4.363636363636363

The editorial reviewer apparently didn't watch the movie very closely, however, and got the story wrong on several counts, but the major flaw with this release is the gawd-awful background music.

It was a gift to the perpetrator that they did not mention his/her name.  It is solo piano throughout, sounds like exercises from a second-grade piano student's lesson plan, and was so distracting that I had to turn the sound off.  Apparently no attempt was made to build excitement during the indian attack, sorrow when somebody meaningful died, etc., just the same meaningless slow solo melody/arpeggiated chord bass throughout.  Bleah.

I have more of these to watch, hope they do better with the music.",1359244800,3,968,5.050314465408805
