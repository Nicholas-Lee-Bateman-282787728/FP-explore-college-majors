7795108,5,0982933118,"I bought this DVD set because I've had a growing interest in this subject, I also have an old 80's motorcycle sitting in the carport that might have been part of the motivation for getting this set of DVDs, not to mention the price of fuel these days. The quality of the production is really good, you can tell Mr. Nelson takes pride in his work, and the amount of information is pretty good if you're completely new to the subject like me. However I think there are some areas that could be more in-depth, but all in all I have to give it 5 stars. The big downside to this is the overall cost of this kind of project. Unless you have parts falling into your lap you better be prepared to spend some cash.  Looking up the cost of motors, and controllers, I was a bit disappointed to find that it really wasn't a project that was going to be done on a shoestring budget. But I can't fault the DVDs for that. All in all, if you have an interest in this and are a beginner like me, these DVDs are a great introduction to the subject.",1395532800,4,1030,4.15
7795109,5,0982933118,"Great review of how you can build your own electric motorcycle. Kinda knew most of it already, but Ben really knows how to explain things even for those that are not too tech savvy, which I like. If you're planning on building your own bike (like I am), then buy it. It's one of the best tutorials there are. If not the best.",1363737600,3,325,4.174603174603175
7795110,5,0982933118,This is an excellent DVD that walks you through everything you need to know.  It exceeded my expectations.  Very clear explanations.  I highly recommend it for anyone who is even thinking about converting their motorcycle to electric.  You won't be disappointed.,1336953600,2,262,5.317073170731708
7795111,5,0982933118,Very well done. Informative and helps get you motivated to want to do this.  I just converted my first moped into electric and having this was a valuable resource.  Buy IT!!!,1336953600,2,174,4.580645161290323
7795112,5,0982933118,"This video is an interesting contrast to the same author's DVD on converting an automobile to electricity. While the car video showed a lot of details about taking the old car apart, some of that is abbreviated in the motorcycle video. After the car video I was ready to dive into such a project, the motorcycle DVD left me more subdued.

A motorcycle is a much simpler project than a car, in theory, but since a non-rider may be tempted to learn to ride just to undertake such a project there's an element of risk. (I'm not a motorcycle rider myself.)

This video goes into all that. How to license the bike, what you need to ride legally, etc. This is of course in addition to a lot of details about the electric components and how he converted his bike to electric power.

Not only is this video the only one of it's kind, there's not much in print on motorcycle conversion either. While it doesn't seem quite as inspired as his car conversion video, this is still a superb starting point for any electric conversion project.",1336953600,3,1028,4.4866310160427805
