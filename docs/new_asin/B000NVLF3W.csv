8182097,3,B000NVLF3W,The DVD was advertises as having the included songs sun.  Some were bot> eg: Stars and stripes forever. I was disapointed.,1392508800,,122,4.809523809523809
8182098,4,B000NVLF3W,"Great video for patriotic functions. Got this for our local Elk's lodge to show during Patriot's Week - 9/9 - 9/13. For reviewer's who were unhappy with the menu driven format, there is a ""Director's Cut"" under ""More Features"" that plays all of the songs - some with vocals, some with instrumentals, and one with vocals and lyrics. We are going to play the ""Waving Flag"" loop as people get seated, then will segway into the ""Pledge of Allegiance"" delivered by children all over the U.S.A., followed by ""Famous Quotes"" and climaxed by running the ""Director's Cut."" While I wish the picture quality was better and the editing smoother and more leisurely over specific areas, it was still a wonderful combination of patriotism, spirit, and celebration for a festive ocassion.",1378944000,2,772,4.946153846153846
8182099,1,B000NVLF3W,"When I first saw this DVD I was pretty excited about the patriotic music and video that it has. Unfortunately, it turns out to be a very disappointing DVD. For the price that I paid for, I was expecting at least that all the songs in the DVD to be complete. ""America the beautiful"" and the ""Star Spangled Banner"" are both incomplete. The quality of the picture and the montage of the video is very poor.
In short, I don't recommend this DVD to any patriotic person.",1233705600,3,465,4.35632183908046
8182100,3,B000NVLF3W,"This DVD would be perfect if it weren't for the annoying menus that pop up after every song.  I bought this DVD expecting it to play straight through from beginning to end without supervision.  Unfortunately, you can't do that because it returns to the main menu after each song.  So, you must select a song and then select the version of that song before it will play.  If you're looking for a continuous play loop don't buy this DVD.",1207094400,18,435,4.468354430379747
8182101,5,B000NVLF3W,I sing in a large  choral group (Oratorio). We did a Veterans'Day program and used the  DVD effectively on a huge screen silently backing up the chorus is the National Anthem and other numbers.,1196553600,8,193,4.647058823529412
8182102,5,B000NVLF3W,"This is exactly what I have been looking for to use during the Star Spangled Banner on my elementary morning news show.  Beautiful and patriotic pictures and video, and scrolling lyrics so the students can read the words as they sing.  Highly recommended.",1194480000,8,255,4.906976744186046
