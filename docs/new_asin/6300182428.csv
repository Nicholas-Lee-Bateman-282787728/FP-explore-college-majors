225808,5,6300182428,"Did I say Geeks, I meant readers. Hey I dig the comics like the next guy, but this is a movie. You can let go and stop imagining an unreal comic  universe and pick up this movie and watch a great adaptation with more  substance than 99% of any issue ever made. Banner(David, Bruce, whatever!)  is beautifully played by the late Bill Bixby in what many consider his  finest work.
There is no need to go into the story because most know it.  So please put the comic and candybar down, and order this must for all  Sci-fi/drama fans. If you are a kid reading this ignore my review, but if  you are one of these ""adults"" still into Marvel/DC scene; grow up  already!",969321600,,662,4.282258064516129

225925,3,6300182428,"I'll be writing the same review for all 5 seasons. It's based on the quality of the DVD transfer not the show content (I love the show) .
The transfer aspect ratio is the old pan and scan made for square tube TVs.  In order to get a widescreen view I have to manually change the aspect ratio which ""stretches"" the picture and leaves the top of the screen chopped off.

225926,3,6300182428,"2003 was a popular year for the Hulk and all of his fans. In anticipation of the 2003 Hulk film that would be released in theaters that summer, the Hulk got a lot of media exposure. There were tons of DVD releases of episodes and TV movies from the original TV series, video games, other merchandise, etc. A few months after the 2003 Hulk movie was in and out of theaters, Universal decided to release a 6 disc DVD set of episodes from the Incredible Hulk TV series. The set was contained episodes from seasons 1 through 4 that were considered to be ""fan favorites"". While that might be true to an extent, I highly doubt every episode on here was a fan favorite, but I'll get more into that later. For now, here are the episodes featured on this big collection.

I will say that some of the episodes were listed in the wrong order and there were no special features. I say that if you can get this cheap, then buy it (as long as you, like me, don't intend to buy the whole series). I always enjoyed this series.",1288569600,,385,3.948717948717949

226128,5,6300182428,"If you like the original Universal television series ""The Incredible Hulk"" then this is a great buy. If you are a Marvel super heroes fan I don't believe you would be disappointed. Drama fans (especially the ladies were the major audience for this series which surprised me) might like the sci-fi and human interest stories too! There was a reason it ran for several years. It was pretty good. Sure by today's standards the special effects are not fantastic but the stories really do hold up pretty well. I got my set from an Amazon seller for less than $10.00 brand new! The quality is pretty good no complaints for sound or picture. The episodes are from several seasons but my favorites were included in this set and some I did not know or remember but I and my wife have enjoyed watching. My favorite episodes are: ""The First"" parts 1 and 2 where David Banner meets another ""Hulk"" and this one is a killer (literally). My second favorite is ""Prometheus"" Parts 1 and 2 where the Hulk is mutated by radiation from a meteor and then captured by scientist because they think he is an alien! After all these years I still enjoy watching these. Now the drawbacks: first the original pilot episode ""The Incredible Hulk"" is not included in the set (but the 2nd pilot/episode ""A Death In the Family"" is). Also the three final Hulk TV movies, ""Return of The Incredible Hulk"", ""Trial of the Incredible Hulk"", and ""Death of the Incredible Hulk"" are not included however each of these can also be purchased for very decent prices. I do not own any of the Incredible Hulk DVD full season sets. I am kind of tight with money so I tend to buy collections and if they have more of my favorite episodes (like this one) then all the better. The DVD case this comes in is very nice and sturdy with great artwork (I imagine this set was much more expensive when it first came out). Another drawback is there is no episode listing so you can watch the series in the order they were meant to be seen (the disks are only labeled by number). This was not a bad thing for me. I simply copied a list another user made in his Amazon review printed it in small font on my printer and store it with the DVD case. Problem solved and for the price it is worth it. The features of this set far outweigh the negatives in my opinion. Viewed together with the Pilot episode/movie and three final movies it is like having a ""Best of The Incredible Hulk"" collection at fraction of the cost of some of the full series DVD sets. Highly recommended. A+++",1268438400,,2517,4.426724137931035
226129,4,6300182428,This set set is perfect for the average fan that is not a die hard fan. You get alot of the good episodes. For $8 how could you go wrong. Wasn't a big enough fan of the show to spend the $100 for the complete series. But for you Hulk lovers its out there for you if you want to spend the money. For those of you griping there is no insert get one of the amazon reviews that has episode list & print it. Problem solved. Wow that was real hard.,1262044800,,442,3.8152173913043477
226130,5,6300182428,"As a fun who grew up with the TV series, i am glad i can watch them again... I am enjoying it so far...",1254787200,,103,3.3333333333333335
226131,5,6300182428,"Back in 2003 when Universal was all gung-ho about the cinema debut of the updated, and critically panned, Hulk movie, they dug into the archives and pulled out this as the original series first ever box-set. Many fans were outraged that they were given this best-of 14 episode set rather than complete seasons. Of course a few years later, they got what they wanted, but this box-set should have been given a better chance. Think of this as a great addition to the ""casual"" fan. Featuring episodes from the first four seasons (for some strange reason NO shows from Season Five are included), this is like ""Hulk 101"", but not without a few flaws. For some reason the shows are not in chronological order, jumping all over it's six discs, that of which aren't labeled with each episode nor is the box telling you where each episode is. Another quirk is that even though most of these shows would be considered the best of the series, it's as if most of the better ones were two-parter shows. In fact, ten of the hours are, while eight are not. And finally, each season is not represented equally here, with Season Two getting six shows, Four has five, One has only two, and Season Three only one. But there's no denying that they make up some of the best hours the show ever produced. Even though five years of release separate them, the video/audio quality between this ""Ultimate"" release and the ""Complete Seasons"" are the same, and that's not a bad thing. So due to the quality of the shows contained, I've overlooked it's flaws and suggest it to any fan that would like a ""Best Of The Hulk"" in their collection.

With all the recent Marvel films that have come out over the past ten years, this television chapter should be revisted by all. Minus the hairstyles and clothing, it truly doesn't look aged that much. And I would take an actual actor sprayed green over fakey cartoonish CGI anyday. A worthy addition to your Fantasy/Sci-Fi DVD collection.

226132,3,6300182428,"This DVD had some good and interesting episodes of THE INCREDIBLE HULK like The First, Mystery Man, Dark Side, Deep Shock, and The Disciple; plus they're shown complete and uncut like they were orignally shown on CBS, unlike the case on the SCI-FI Channel, which shows too many commercials with lots of deleted scenes.

Additionally, this DVD also includes Closed Captioning on each episode like all Universal DVD's do, but the big downfall to this DVD is the DVD package didn't say which DVD disc had which episodes, nor showed a picture with a brief summary and their original airdates, which therefore made it difficult to remember and figure out which episode was on which DVD disc.

Another minus to this DVD box set was it didn't have any episodes from the 5th Season, even though it had episodes from all the other seasons, but only episodes from the 1st Season thru the 4th Season.

In addition to the downfalls of this DVD they should've included some more sophisticated episodes of The Incredible Hulk like ""Proof Positive"", Interview With The Hulk, The pilot episode, Metamorphosis, Broken Image, Captive Night, Sideshow, Long Run Home, Triangle, The Phenom, A Minor Problem, etc.

So now I can hardly wait till Universal finally releases the 3rd Season, the 4th Season, and the 5th Season of The Incredible Hulk, since those were the most sophisticated seasons of that show.",1203033600,5,1386,4.910256410256411

226215,5,6300182428,"I'm reviewing this as a Rick Springfield fan.  He happens to appear in one of the two episodes on this particular VHS tape.  As a child, I used to watch the Incredible Hulk, but never noticed before that you can see his green stockings and that his pants were at his knees (and ripped) as the hulk, but then when he is David Banner again, his pants are unripped and back at his ankles!  Funny!  This was quite an enjoyable trip down to a childhood tv show.  I bought this tape on Amazon, then after receiving it, watched it THREE times within a 24 hour time-period!  I'm not even a TV person.  I watch TV at most 5 hours a week (only because I have to watch All My Children).  Here's the scoop:  Rick plays a cop in the show - oh my gosh he is so young and fresh - his hair is so black, he's so tall, in shape, his lips are pouty (ok, sorry, I had to fit that in).  His father in the show dies and Rick becomes torn between a spiritual outlook on life versus his life as a cop.  He is a member of a group led by a Chinese philosopher and spiritualist.  Once his father is shot, Mike (aka Rick) spends a lot of time with this group and his family begins to worry about the influence it has over him.  I won't give away exactly what happens.  We get to see Rick a ton in this show - aside from the Hulk, he is the main character we follow as he goes through his spiritual transition.  He wears some tight pants too (hehe).  Oh, we do get to see him doing a lot of martial arts during this show.  We see him get shot and almost die too!  I do have to give this a five star - I couldn't stop watching this tape.

DVD cover art has now been released. On the front cover is the Hulk with an angry look on his face.  I was hoping for Bill Bixby to be on the cover as well, but Ferrigno makes it happen.

***04/14/06***
UNIVERSAL MAKES IT OFFICIAL!

From tvshowsondvd: ""Expect a 4-DVD set with each disc being single-sided (THANK THE LORD...and Universal!).  Running time is 11 hours 33 minutes. Video is in the original full frame 1.33:1, and audio is in the original English Mono.  English subtitles are also provided. We don't have the cover art yet, but we do know that the packaging is in the slim snap-cases with an outer slip cover.""

""the set will contain both pilot telefilms, the 10 regular weekly episodes from the short first season, and a bonus episode from Season 2 (""Stop The Presses"").

Sounds like Universal is trying to do the fans justice.  (Here's hoping for a clean print of the episodes.)

***04/03/06***
Kenneth Johnson tells that the commentary on the pilot episode will be the commentary from 2003's ""The Incredible Hulk - Original Television Premiere"".  The interview with Lou Ferrigno appears to be the same also.  Yet there is still hope that new extras will appear on the release.

***03/31/06***
""The box will include the movie pilot with a full length commentary by Kenny [Kenneth Johnson] and an interview with Lou [Ferrigno]"".

NOTE: It is not clear if this will be the same commentary track previously recorded on ""The Incredible Hulk - Original Television Premiere"" DVD released in June 2003.

***03/13/06***
According to Hulk TV series creator Kenneth Johnson's website, Big Green finally gets his First Season bow on DVD this July.

Maybe ""Universal Home Video"" has finally heard the cries of the people, considering the only thing we've had to watch of the Bixby/Ferrigno combination is the series ""Pilot"" and 2nd season opener ""Married"", 3 Made for TV Movies, and this bittersweet release of ""The Incredible Hulk - The Television Series Ultimate Collection"".

Universal...please don't ""drop the ball"" on this one.  Give the fans more than just a bare bones release...Get Johnson and Ferrigno to do a few commentary tracks on ""key"" episodes...find some archival interviews/commentaries/footage with the late Bill Bixby and Jack Colvin (who passed away last year). Restore and Remaster every episode both in the visual and audio realms.

We know you can do this Universal, you know you can do this.  To paraphrase Dr. David Banner in the pilot episode...""Universal, don't make us angry, you wouldn't like us when we're angry"".

***Fans, buy Season 1 to ensure we get the remaining four***

All kidding aside...Thank you Universal for finally releasing this fantastic TV series to DVD.",1142208000,11,2719,5.038031319910514
226218,3,6300182428,"Growing up reading the Hulk comics and watching the TV series, I became a pretty devoted fan.  Something about how a guy who could turn into a giant when someone pissed him off seemed pretty cool to me:)  At the same time, the live-action series brought some humanity to the comic book character.  Imagine how disappointing it was for fans to see the characters from this very underrated dramatic series turn into a multi-million dollar mess in movie theaters...

But I digress...

This 6 disc collection of fan-picked favorites from the TV series is quite nostalgic.  A few of the two-part episodes are included as well.  My favorite has to be ""Prometheus"", where Banner/Bixby gets stuck between his human and Hulk-self.

For the current price (brand new), however, it seems like kind of a jip.  There are only 3 shows (at most) to each disc - Keep in mind that without the commercials, each episode is only about 45 minutes.  Also, no extra features to speak of...unless you count the movie trailers on disc one.  I can't name the other episodes I would have wanted to see included in this collection...but I know there are several good ones missing.

Still, it's a collection worth appreciating.  Bill Bixby was truly a great actor, and played his part in this series with an amazing range of skill.  Even without dialog, Lou Ferrigno managed to win cheers and empathy for his work as the Hulk.

I know the dated special effects and styles may seem a little silly at this point...but the story lines and main characters in this series have held up quite well.

Don't get me wrong, the show was great for it's time, and I loved watching re-runs of it growing up, so I'm not panning the series at all here.  First off, the episodes of the Incredible Hulk collected here aren't in any particular order, and secondly, you won't be able to tell what episodes are on what discs because none of them are labeled.  The picture quality is horrible, with no restoration attempted at all, and the audio is as average as watching the show on TV.  Not to mention, for as much as this set costs, there are no extras at all.  No commentaries, montages, etc., nothing at all.  This set is far from being ""Ultimate"", and it's a slap in the face to older viewers of the series.

226274,5,6300182428,"I actually loved the show and the TV pilot that once aired on CBS and soon got back to TV like on SCI-FI when I 1st catch the premiere of the back-to-back episodes. Yep this is not something to disappoint, it's a great movie that shows a real side of Bruce Banner (whom Stan Lee, the founder of Marvel Comics) changed to David 'cuz Bruce was too homosexual. Reason why they did that 'cuz of the reason of the name. So they add it along the TV series from '78 until it's demise in 1982. So sad Bill Bixby is not here. He was a good actor and definitely my all-time favorite stars. He's such a good man and I miss him deerly. Wish if he would've stay long. But long period short, it started off when David Banner begin losing his wife from an automobile accident, soon transformed into a doctor along with his associtate Dr. Elaina Marks (played my Susan Sullivan), begin testing people 'bout their health and what they feel about stress, then started doing a lil experiement of gamma reactions probably known as gamma rays which I'll say, and once he leaves the office, he soons gets into his car and when he's get mad, he transformed into the 7-foot green tall man known as the Hulk (played by Lou Ferrigno). And before the concl. he comes back until Jack McGee (played by Jack Colvin) wanted him 4 murder. Y'know David Banner would be real serious here about what he's doing. To me he could be a Dr. Jekyll while the Hulk could be a Mr. Hyde. Similar to the book I read from Robert Louis Stevenson. This movie is such interesting to me b/c of the action, the effects, and the mixing to the set. Wish Hulk fans would be proud if this was a classic. I recommend this who wants to feel any difference to it.

Like I told ya you won't be dissappointed if u see this 'cuz I'ma get it DVD also even tho I have it on VHS. Rest in peace to my man Bill Bixby who is in good spirits now. Wish he could've made it on the 4th installment of the Hulk film THE REVENGE OF THE INCREDIBLE HULK or REBIRTH OF THE INCREDIBLE HULK.",1107216000,,2248,4.275294117647059
226275,4,6300182428,"Back in the late 70's, Marvel Comics attempted to conquer TV Land with a deluge of some of it's more popular characters.  Among this lot was The Incredible Hulk who shocked everyone by becoming Marvel's break away hit, beating out none other than Spider-man himself for the top spot (by the way...why aren't THOSE on DVD yet??).  The success of this show came down to two major things that Kenneth Johnson and company did right.  The first was the decision to place the Hulk in more reality-based situations, focusing on Banner and his struggle to find a cure for his curse.  The second was casting.  Lou Ferrigno as the enraged and confused creature hounded by a tenacious reporter played by a fine actor named Jack Colvin were certainly both wonderful choices.  However, it was Bill Bixby that proved to be the show's heart and soul.  Bixby was truly a sensational actor who could not only make you believe every line he uttered, he made you care about Banner as a person.  He exuded a kindness and genuine quality that just made you like him.  Yes the show had its cheesey moments; yes some of the writing and acting was a bit less than stellar; but the humanity brought to the character by Bixby (and Ferrigno for that matter) completely eclipsed all of that.

Details about the contents and packaging have been covered wonderfully by other reviewers (see Jeff Carter's comments) so I'll refrain from getting too redundant.  Suffice it to say this was obviously a rush job as the selections are seemingly as random as the order they were placed in.  Also, if you're a big fan of extras there are absolutely none to be found.  Heck, they didn't even bother listing which episodes were on what disk!  Regardless of all this, I'm happy to have at least these few episodes.  They take me back to a wonderful time period as a kid.  Young viewers new to this show may be bothered by the outdated look, lack of CGI, and ""long drawn out scenes"" (this is what was known as ""characterization"" and ""building a story""), but for my money you just can't do any better than Lou and Bill.",1105747200,7,2076,4.585365853658536

226278,4,6300182428,"The only reason I knocked a star of the rating of this collection is not because of the episodes themselves but because of how lazy Universal was in putting it together. What kind of boxed set arranges episodes in a completely random order and then fails to mark what the order is anywhere within the entire package. This one!

But this is such a great show and fans have been so desperate for a collection like this that that fact can almost be overlooked. I'm guessing after this release that Universal has scrapped any chance of releasing season by season collections. This is it folks! But that isn't so bad since the majority of the best episodes from the series can be found in this collection. Except for a few odd choices such as ""Deep Shock,"" ""Rainbow's End,"" and ""Kindred Spirits"" among others which certainly could have been replaced by better episodes. But as long as the very best are included, I'm happy.

Here is my brief reviews of each episode included:

Rainbow's End - 3/5 - This is a pretty average episode... possibly the least interesting in this set (not that the Hulk using his incredible super-abilities to steer a horse out of a burning barn isn't edge of your seat entertainment :b). But that's not saying much in a great collection of episodes like this.

Another Path - 3/5 - Not among the cream of the crop, but a decent episode with an interesting character in the old blind martial artist. The climax is pretty darn corny though... even for a series about a big green guy who likes to smash stuff.

The Disciple - 3/5 - This is sort of a sequel to ""Another Path,"" but it is actually a worse episode. In fact, it is strange that this episode was even included considering that the main character in the story isn't even David Banner, but some ""karate kid-like"" character.

747 - 4/5 - This episode will definitely keep you gripped! Take the plot that is so often used in movies... an airplane full of passengers without a pilot and throw the hulk into the mix and you've got yourself a good time!

Death in the Family (2 parts) - 4/5 - This is a pretty good episode, but the weakest of the two-parters.

The First (2 parts)- 5/5 - This is my favorite episode of the entire series! It is just pure fun seeing another Hulk running around and the climactic battle between the two is probably the most entertaining scene of the series. A great script, eery atmosphere, and interesting characters make this a must-see episode for any fan of this show.

Kindred Spirits- 3/5 - This is possibly the most formulaic episode in the collection so it isn't particularly exciting, but it is decent.

Stop the Presses- 4/5- This one is for those Jack McGee lovers. This is the funniest episode in this collection and one of the better episodes of the series.

Mystery Man (2 parts)- 5/5- This two-parter episode is very well-done! Not only is it very exciting but it adds so much depth to the character of Jack McGee. There is a lot of brilliant psychological tension used brilliantly to build suspense. I'd rank this the 3rd best episode in this collection.

The Psychic- 4/5- This is a wonderful episode with a fantastic guest star-- Bill Bixby's own wife! And you can almost tell without me mentioning it... there is a lot of screen chemistry between the two and she does a great job in her role as a morally torn woman.

Prometheus (2 parts)- 5/5- This is probably the most famous Hulk episode ever created due to its vast production values. And it does indeed deserve the credit. This one is a very close second to ""The First"" as my favorite episode. The sets in this episode are probably more extensive than in most motion pictures of the time and the script is top-notch. This is an absolute MUST SEE episode!

Dark Side- 4/5- This episode is pure sadistic fun! After viewing so many other episodes, who hasn't gotten the itching to see a David Banner who isn't so morally pure and a truly homicidal hulk with no mercy? That fascinating twist alone makes this episode one to remember and a popular one with the fans.

Deep Shock- 3/5- This is another one of those very average episodes. It is decent but forgetable.

The Harder They Fall- 5/5- Bill Bixby gives one of his best performances in this episode as a man who suddenly loses his pride along with the use of his limbs. This episode plays on your heartstrings with so many likeable characters and points out the horrible trials that must be dealt with every day by the disabled. Of all the episodes in this collection, this one has the most heart.",1096848000,21,4528,4.544226044226044
226336,1,6300182428,"This is yet another example of terrible abuse of the DVD standard by an overzealous marketing department.  Developers of DVDs have control over what starts playing when you put the DVD in your player and what buttons you can press and when.  Unfortunately, some companies have decided to use this feature of the DVD standard to force you to watch their commercials.  I was all excited to watch The Hulk and was disappointed that the DVD started by playing a long and annoying commercial for some product.  You cannot skip it or access the main menu.  You just have to let it play or fast forward through it.

I'm sure I will enjoy the episodes of The Hulk, but if this wasn't a gift and I hadn't already opened it, I would return it immediately on principle.  I hope this review will save some of you the frustration I'm feeling right now and send a message to the producer of this DVD.

I pretty much hate it.  This really hurts since I was looking forward to owning the complete series.  Why can't anyone take a hint from Star Trek:DS9 packaging?

These are a good pick of shows(thus my 4 ****). And do not contain any emotional baggage.  But will they inspire you to be an avid Hulk fan?  Thier are many more shows to pick from, but these are probably the best.  Most of the others are theme.  One could also say ""Wax Musium"" was a theme show, but it was a good one about a mental patient whose given the going over(like so many are) by a wicked step father or uncle and/or pill pusher head shrink or something to that effect. More than about Wax'n stuff it is about her delusions with the Hulk not really being as such.  The reason I am going to buy this is for three episodes that I think are really great.  ""Prometheus"" ""The First"" and ""Dark side"".  These three deal more with the Hulk and less with some other element.",1085702400,,995,4.398907103825136

I don't see season boxed sets being released after they did this (unless they put these out of print and start over?). Which fans picked these episodes???

Over in the UK there are many released that arnt avalible over here. Some episodes id like to see released are ""Like A Brother"", ""Alice In Discoland"", ""Equinox"", ""Final Round"" (the offical first non pilot episode ever!), ""Of Guilt Models And Murder"", ""Broken Image"" (where Bixby plays double rolls!)..and I could go on! Its sad that there could be a good chance there will never be anymore releases on DVD beings this was all because of that crap horrable movie..but hey..like I say..at least its something.",1079481600,,1165,4.578947368421052

226341,5,6300182428,"I've been struggling for YEARS to collect all the Incredible Hulk episodes on video (thru the Sci-Fi channel, local broadcasts from the 80's, and thru Columbia House video...which was a rip off.  Sure I got individual episodes, but with no choice of which ones I wanted, and almost $30 a tape/two episodes!).  Finally, Universal has seen the light and has hopefully only begun the transition of this golden show to DVD...the only media worthy of carrying this show.  Bill Bixby will never be replaced as a viable ""David Bruce Banner"".  Watch these excellent episodes and you'll see why.  He was obviously VERY dedicated to the show, and brought all emotions forth.  Watch him bawl with tears in ""The Psychic"", and tell me you don't feel sorry for him.  And again in the climax of ""The First"" when he loses the cure he's so long looked for.
As a young buck, I used to run and hide everytime David would begin his transformation, as the Hulk literally scared the hell out of me, but I'd be right back on Friday nights watching this unbelievable series again and again, right after Knight Rider (another that should see a DVD release).
As most others, I'm sorely dissapointed that this isn't a complete season, since although these are the most memorable episodes, they're also the most plentiful.  I still long for the ""rare"" episodes, but hopefully... UNIVERSAL,....this is just a short wait away.
The transfer is excellent, as well as the audio (for a mono track anyway), but I'd easily pay $10 more dollars or so for a few extras, commentary on key episodes perhaps, and a remastered stereo track.
Bottom line is, you can't go wrong with this set.  The show runs the gamut of emotions, and often, people with certain diseases or illnesses can relate well with the struggle that David Banner has with life, love, and a cure.  Kudos to Universal...let's see you do more things like this for longtime fans of 70's/80's shows!  They don't make them like this anymore!",1070496000,5,1964,4.747058823529412
226342,4,6300182428,"Let me just start by saying that without Jack Colvin as Jack McGee, the Incredible Hulk series would have been doomed.  There is only so much of David Banner's antics that one can take!  Colvin, one of the greatest character actors of our time, brought a sense of realism and sanity to a show that many would deem borderline ridiculous.
An episode highlighting Colvin, for example ""Mystery Man"",
""Prometheus"" and ""Stop The Presses"" would have to be considered classics.  And who doesn't love ""The First"" with the ""evil old-guy hulk""? They even included a episode with Rick ""Jessie's Girl"" Springfield!
In ""747"" (A McGee-less episode) I was really hoping that annoying David would crash that plane into the side of a mountain and be done with it (just kidding!)
This is a decent DVD collection and a worthy addition to any Hulk-fan's DVD collection.  The only negatives would be the mono audio and lack of extras (there were none).  The fact that they neglected to label the disks or the packaging with the contained episodes was just plain LAZY.  The overall picture quality is good and the episodes that they included with this package makes you forget many of the shortcomings.
Is it too late to spin-off Jack McGee into his own series?",1070236800,3,1238,4.788732394366197

My only complaints:
1.  Discs aren't labeled with what episodes are on them
2.  ""The Snare"" and ""The Slam"" would have been nice additions
3.  No extras
Just minor things that prevented a 5 star rating.  Still definitely worth the purchase!",1067126400,,344,4.483870967741935

First of all, I really like this show and this set is a great opportunity to get some of the best episodes of the series but the packaging really sucks. I mean, come on Universal, couldn't you AT LEAST find the time to make a sleeve for the set??? And a listing of wich episode is on each disc would have been nice too. How about a booklet? Interactive menus? Geez... for hardcore collectors only.",1066953600,,527,4.28

226409,5,6300182428,"In my review of the pilot episode on DVD, I said that Universal would earn high points if they released Promethius & The First as a two-parter.  Instead of that entree, I got a five course meal!  What a dream come true!  However, I do have a couple of minor quibs:
First of all, there is no collectible booklet or content listing anywhere in the set.  You have the list of the shows on the back cover but no indication as to which episode is on which disc.  You gotta' do a little searching there.  I can live with that.  Second, I know these episodes are fan picks, but I was a little dissappointed two didn't make it in there:  ""Interview With The Hulk"" with Michael Conrad (True, it is a flashback episode but a good one) and ""King Of The Beach"" where Ferrigno plays a dual role.  No extras on any disc either.  Again, minor quibs.
Two episodes I was thrilled that made it were ""Dark Side"" where David tries a formula that turns him and subsequently the Hulk evil and ""The Harder They Fall"" where David becomes crippled from a car accident.  I was also relieved that Universal didn't waste a disc and throw the pilot and ""Married"" on there, since they already had them out.
Overall, this is a thrill that's DEFINITELY worth it.  Thanks again, Universal for listening!",1066694400,3,1270,4.426724137931035
226410,5,6300182428,"After fussing and complaining about Universal and when the U know what are they gonna put the some multiple shows on DVD my prayers have been answered!!
It's about time and I am soooooooo glad I can now get commericial free episodes of the Incredible Hulk to watch over and over again.  The pilot and extra episode DVD that came out prior to the movie were basically appetizers in my opinion I really wanted a full main course.  This DVD serves up just that.
I hope that the episodes shown are at least from the season one and two.  Now besides this I will also get the movie Hulk that came out and along with getting this I will be able to complete my Hulk collection!!  I hope that based on the response of sales they can have more Hulk tv collection episodes to come out on DVD. Watching the show as an adult it is downright comical and I laugh at how I used to be soo scared of the Hulk watching the show and reruns of it as a little kid!!
Plus I can't think of a nicer way to honor Bill Bixby's memory of a cult favorite show and quite frankly the only show I can easily associate with him (don't shoot me yall I am in a late 20-something so I am not as familar with his earlier shows LOL  :>D).",1066608000,,1200,4.089361702127659
226411,5,6300182428,"AT LONG LAST! I've been waiting & hoping for and dreaming about this day all my life: the day when one of the - if not THE -greatest television series in history is finally enshrined in the practically ageless & timeless medium of the DVD.  As a kid, I used to look at my audio CD time and time again and wished that I would some day be able to own the entire series of The Incredible Hulk on something that was identical to the CD so that I would not need an entire bookcase's worth of space to store each & every episode on videotape.  And now that time has finally come - well almost, since we're just getting some of the best episodes on one 6 DVD box.
What's more, I think this miraculous moment couldn't have occured at a better time; the US release of the set come October 21, 2003 is exactly one month to the 10th anniversary of the untimely death of the late great Bill Bixby on November 21, 1993 when a superb actor, beloved father & husband, and an oh-so-wonderful human being was sadly robbed from us.  Hence this set is I guess the least that can be done to remember such a fine & kindhearted Dr. David Bruce Banner that Bill Bixby was, still is, and forever will be!
To this day, I'm still finding it really painstakingly hard to come to terms that Bill Bixby is dead & gone.  And I still feel as strongly as I did back on November 21, 1993 when news first broke about his passing that The - and indeed His - Death of The Incredible telemovie was sadly ironic in that the only way David Banner could be free from The Incredible Hulk was not the cure he was always trying to hunt down for years but only in death, and the problems Bill Bixby had had to face up to - during the last 15 years or so of his life which had begun to weigh him down in the early days of the tv series - wasn't much dissimilar to his woes & heartaches (or heartbreaks) as Banner with his life's tragedies and The Hulk in him.
To conclude, The Incredible Hulk will always be my all time favorite television show and an inseperable part of my life, just as the late Bill Bixby will remain an inextinguishable part of our lives, for all time and, indeed, for all eternity, and the wonderful Banner Bixby was will certainly live on forever and ever on this and future (more complete) releases of The Incredible Hulk on DVD!",1065744000,3,2308,4.203160270880361

I wish I knew the website where you could have voted. From the reviewers' choices, i have to agree mostly on the all time favorites. But I have to say, MY ALL TIME FAVORITE HULK Episode was Death In the Family 2 part series. I thought it was excellent. The First was wonderful as well. Yes, SCIFI Does chop out some scences. IT will be good to see Commerical free. Anybody know of any Extra's on this set. I have seen the menu screens and artwork for the discs and it is spectacular. I pre-ordered mine, about 2 months ago when it was annouced over at DDD. Looking foward to seeing it. I would like to see Universal bring out Full Season Sets of this show in the future.
Some very good extras on this disc would be Makeup, deleted scences,behind the scences. etc. some great footage of the late Bill Bixby.",1065312000,,933,4.27683615819209
226493,5,6300182428,"At last,this is my all time favorite superhero show of the late 70's-early 80's. The Incredible Hulk was exciting in every way,great episodes,acting,plots,drama,fantasy,and adventure. The late Bill Bixby made a great Banner,his acting was superb and he will be truly missed. Lou Ferrigno is outstanding as The Hulk. I have some of my favorite episodes on tape but this DVD will be a true collectors Item. Of all the episodes in the show many viewers say the two part episodes Prometheus and The First are the all time best episodes,these are my favorite all time episodes also. Prometheus showed us Banner when a meteor crashed on earth and Banner absorbed the radiation of the meteor causing his metamorphosis to stop at the halfway point showing us a half man,half hulk creature,and the unforgettable episode the First showed us the Hulk's predesesser,another man who turned into a Hulk before Banner and the battle of good and evil of the two Hulks in a scene at the end. Joe Hartnell's The Lonely man theme music during the show at the end of each show was wonderful. This is a must have for every true fan of the series,By the way my favorite episodes are:
Prometheus
The First
Death Mask
The Desciple
Another Path
Mystery Man
Blind Rage
The Slam
The Confession
Haunted

For those of you that don't remember the episodes on this set or for those of you that have never seen these TV episodes, I absolutely FULLY recommend this set.  I believe, as I have found that most hulk fans believe, that ""The First"" (my personal all time favorite) and ""Prometheus"" (my second favorite) are the best episodes made.  I am SO greatful that they are BOTH contained in this set.  Moreover, for those of you watching the reruns on SciFI, I've been told that SciFi is cutting portions of the episodes (probably to fit the plethera of commercials it airs).  These DVD's will hopefully contain the full episodes so you get it all.  I saw this set just a few minutes ago and purchased it immediately.

There are some great episodes in this bunch, including 'The First', as well as the most expensive Hulk episode ever made, 'Prometheus'.

7805132,4,6300182428,"RELEASED TO TV IN 1977 and written & directed by Kenneth Johnson, The Incredible Hulk is the pilot movie for the series that ran for five seasons from late 1977 to early 1982. Bill Bixby stars as Dr. David Banner, a grieving research scientist whose experiments with gamma radiation curses him with the propensity to morph into a jade monster (Lou Ferrigno) when undergoing extreme emotional stress. Susan Sullivan plays Davids caring colleague while Jack Colvin appears as the annoyingly nosy reporter who smells a big story.

This first movie incarnation of the Hulk was limited by its TV budget and no CGI, which meant that the creature was far less powerful than in the comics and the future theatrical versions where the Hulk could throw tanks around and bounce around the landscape with his powerful leg thews. What I like about this rendition is the totally serious take on the story, which contains elements of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, Frankenstein and werewolf sagas. Despite its comic book origins, this is a tragic tale with a melancholic vibe. The haunting piano theme is Exhibit A.

If you're used to the Hulk from the movies of the new millennium I can see why youd scoff at this presentation. Its extremely low budget by comparison and you can tell by the spare cast, limited locations and one-dimensional script: Everything revolves around Banners frustrating grief, his research and the ramifications of his accidental overexposure to gamma radiation. However, the moving close revolving around Sullivans character wins the day, not to mention Ferrignos exuberant efforts as the angry behemoth. Moreover, Sullivan shines in the female department, as does Lara Parker in a small role as Banners wife. Perhaps most important of all, Bixby carries the movie (and series) as the brilliant, sympathy-inducing protagonist.

THE FILM RUNS 94 minutes and was shot in California (Santa Clarita, Valencia, Universal City, Burbank, Inglewood and Los Angeles).
