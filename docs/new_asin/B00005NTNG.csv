7947861,5,B00005NTNG,"This is my favorite Kung fu movie. It's not as well known as all the Shaw Brothers movies (of which a lot are awesome). This one is different because it has a pretty deep emotional plot. I've read a few reviews on here. I have to RESPECTFULLY disagree with a a few of them about the main character. Ti Lung's character is NOT a ""double agent"" or ""conflicted"" in the traditional sense. He is loyal to Shaolin, he feels as though he can help them from the inside of the enemy camp. Unfortunately he has to fake it for the enemy and his friends. One of the earlier flashbacks explains what a ""hero"" is. That is the basis of his whole charade. The dance scene with the Shaolin sister shows it as well. Not wanting to spoil the plot. I just wanted to explain that the movie doesn't get enough credit. The DVD isn't great quality. But the story is. I saw this when I was about 10. It moved me then, even though I didn't catch all the nuances. Great movie. Give it a shot. Thank you for your time.",1419120000,,990,4.18848167539267
7947862,5,B00005NTNG,"I guess the review is not about the movie itself however it is about the technicality of the video.
Please review based on technical not the film.",1369612800,,146,4.444444444444445
7947863,5,B00005NTNG,"This movie started my collection of movies with Ti Lung.  He is an orchestrator of martial arts.  His strategy in this movie is to train his brothers in kung fu while he is deceptively scheming on the grand prize, the removal of the corrupt emperor and his crony government. Ti Lungs knowledge of cinema and acting create the perfect chemistry for any Martial Arts fan!  The facial expressions, the tragedy, the mistrust and the triumph makes the title more symbolic>

Ti Lung got skillz! This movie also known as ""The Wutang Clan"" should be in every fight fans collection",1346544000,2,572,4.747474747474747
7947864,3,B00005NTNG,"Out of all the kung-fu that I have ever ordered on Amazon, this is the icing on the cake. Ti lung gives a stunning performance in, ""The Heroes"". Though I already have this, you must check this out. The fighting is amazing and the plot is pretty neat.",1323907200,,250,4.229166666666667
7947865,5,B00005NTNG,"I am a woman who avidly collects old school kung fu films. I know a bad film when I see one, and this isn't one! But it isn't for anyone who is only looking for rampant and pointless gore and/or impossible feats of martial arts prowes!  Heroes tells an intriquing story. This does not mean that fight scenes and choreography are lacking, however. The final scene in particular, is always a tragic joy for me. I cannot not say more about it without giving too much of the plot away.  Ti lung, a real Wing Chun practioner, shines in Heroes.  Wai Man Chan and Dorian Tan, also real life martial artist, are wonderful in this as well.  The quality of the film is not the greatest; but face it, it is not a Shaw Bros. production, so it has not been remastered.  The picture quality is not so poor so as not to be able to enjoy it, but just rustic enough to give you that old school nostalgic feeling. Lung brings his usual majestic aura to the screen and Chan is always a formidable enemy who I enjoy watching paired against Lung (check Deadly Breaking Sword).  Lung plays a high ranking official who has betrayed and imprisoned his kung fu brothers of the Shoalin Temple and tries to convince them to do as he has done, join forces with the enemy. He tortures them brutally. Just as he did in Blood Brothers, Lung is able to aptly demonstrate the psychological tormoil of a leader who is challenged not to let his emotional conflicts deter him from his greater political aims. He does this, risking reputation, legacy, and life. Flashback is used throughout the movie to show Lung and Tan as students of the Shaolin Temple being taught lessons about morality and sacrifice.  These flashbacks help to emphasize Tan's character's confusion and devastation by his brother's betrayal.  He and his comrades continued futile resistance is quite admirable and give cause for support.  Many people who give this movie a bad review miss the point.  Beyond a martial arts classic, it is a tragedy ala Hero starring Jet Li (no connection between the two movies).  Ultimately, this movie is about sacrifice of individual reputation, comrades, family, and life for one's country.  It leaves you wondering if, unlike some of the reviewers here, the rebels got the point. A great movie for any true kungfu movie fan.  A must have for any Ti Lung, Wai Man Chan, and/or Dorian Tsn fan. If anyone knows how I can get this in the original language, please post.",1198540800,5,2438,4.602771362586605
