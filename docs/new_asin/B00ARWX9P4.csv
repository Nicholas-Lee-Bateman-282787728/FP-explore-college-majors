8557216,3,B00ARWX9P4,"The film opens at ""The Institute for Study of Homicidal Baked Goods."" Here our villain is freed. He escapes in a time machine to 1976. The film spoofs, ""Carrie"", ""Silence of the Lambs"", and ""Porkey's."" It had some good characters, but seemed mostly like an opportunity wasted.  When the film wasn't being a spoof it was lame.
