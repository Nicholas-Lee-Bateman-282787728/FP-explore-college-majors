When they finally got to watch the movies this particular DVD was dirty you could see finger prints too.
They were watching when it began to get stuck at a scene and to top it all the movie didn't end!!
I'm very disappointed with this !! I feel embarrassed.

3644610,1,B001HVZOA2,"The whole movie is one contrived situation after another, including their ""random"" meeting by being blown into one another. We are supposed to believe that a calm, calculating businessman can instantly go from what had been up to then a totally cool, introspective behavior to a murderous rage over a snow globe. The keystone cops can't put one and one together to find the murderous husband and can't find the witness who offered to help Gere haul the body obviously rolled up in a carpet to his trunk (they don't even search his car). Then there is the sex scene in a restaurant public bathroom while Connie's girlfriends wait. Really? But coup de grace is the final scene that leaves the ending up to the viewer. Save yourself two hours of head shaking and skip this one; this is not one of Gere's finer moments.",1518912000,,815,4.627586206896551

living day to day , he has own business running a armored truck  company and she is a stay at home mom
she runs Arron during the day while he works, one day
was littler different, it was a very windy day as he went off to work and she decided to go meet
some old work friends down town, she was caring some shopping bags  and the wind was blowing her
around like a piece of paper and as she was walking, some young french  guy was walking  in the same direction
caring a handful of old books and the wind caught him and blew him sideways and Mrs Sumner fell into him and his books
she fell and scraped her knee and it started to bleed and the french guy(carl) ask her to his place since it was close by to get a band aid
and she really did not want to, she did not know this Carl guy, but he insisted and she wanted to get out of the rain,
as time went by, her husband was not paying that much attention to her and things heated up with her and carl
, she was making excuses to go into town on a daily basis and one day she met her girlfriends at a cafe just around the corner from carl ,
they were having coffee and she went to use the phone and she called carl and told him where she was  and for him to wait till she was done
well, he showed up at the cafe where the ladies were at, connie was startled but she did not want the other 2 to know she knew this guy
she excused herself to go to the powder room and as she did , he met her and screwed her in the stall!
her husband had idea something was up , so he hired an old friend to keep on eye on her while he was in Chicago on business
the guy took pictures of her and this carl and a few day s after Edward got back met with him and showed the pictures and told edward all about this carl guy, now watch the show to see how all of this works or does not work, her friend told connie having an affair always ends badly

3644613,4,B001HVZOA2,"What a sensual, somewhat realistic erotic thriller. A bored housewife risks it all to have an affair with a younger man - for the thrill, for the adventure, for the risk that was so lacking in her mundane, suburban life.
**WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD**

 I suspect most spouses being cheated on don't go on to murder their spouses lovers but the overall storyline isn't unheard of - people cheat, unfortunately. The ending in this particular movie sucks but the in-between story is hot and fiery. Im one of those people who get so insanely attached to my partner when Im in a serious relationship that I couldn't imagine cheating but everyone is different. I still love the movie.",1517011200,,676,4.769230769230769
3644614,5,B001HVZOA2,"Really awesome movie. Diane Lane is brilliant and so is Richard Gere. One flaw in the story is the detectives could dug deeper in the murder, if they had done so, he would have been caught, and his wife would have been an accessory to murder. What I feel, the movie should have ended with him getting arrested not living happily ever after. Poor book dealer was left in a garbage dump the police should have figured out why would a man who was murdered in Manhattan wind up dead wrapped in rug in a land fill in Staten Island mmm red flags there.",1516924800,,546,4.259615384615385

3644633,2,B001HVZOA2,"This is a ""R"" rated movie.  Husband is a successful businessman.  His wife sometimes gets boring in her quiet home setting and drives to the always busy Manhattan.  This couple in 40's, have a 9-year-old son.

In a windy day, the wife meets a French bookworm swinger in his 20's.  Blinded by lust, an unfaithful affair carries on for 2 years.  She has been caught once in a local bar restaurant by her husband's assistant.  This assistant on a latter day of being fired, scolds his boss and reports the unfaithful event.  Now, the husband hires a retiree friend to follow up his personal case.  Identified and Found.  He befriends first with his love enemy so that they can drink and talk in his city apartment.  Cold vodka drink. They begin to talk about the adulterous event.

By accident, this young guy is killed by a powerful snow globe --- that sphere thing.  No calling for help that rainy day. Instead. he cleans up the mess before pulling out the dead body into his car.  He then drives to pick up his wife and son.. Back home.  Getting up in the midnight.  He drives his car this hour to depose the dead body in a waste land.  Then back home again.  A few days later, his wife learns the hidden truth from her husband.  They decide to run away to Mexico and live there with new identities. Personally I don't like this ending.  It encourages people to hide truth from police.",1499817600,,1385,4.442231075697211

3644689,5,B001HVZOA2,"Based on the title ""Unfaithful"", and the actors, Richard Gere mostly, I expected this movie to be shallow and a vehicle for Richard Gere and fans. Boy was I wrong. I only just watched ""Unfaithful"" on my phone recently many years after it first appeared in theaters in 2002. This film was engrossing, interesting, deep, real and instructive about the true enormous pain of adultery. . It worked on so many different levels. It was highly entertaining to watch and completely held the viewers attention, the actors were excellent and the pain and tragedy of infidelity exposed in a non glamorized realistic way. The actors were so well cast especially the three major parts, Diane lane playing  the wife, Richard Gere as the husband and Olivier Martinez, as the young French lover.
  This movie is about an upper middle class family with one child a son, living in a mansion somewhere in the suburbs of New York City.  The husband is fulfilled with his career, his wife of 11 years and his young son. The wife however is less content. She is not employed and her one child is in school and no longer requires all of her time so she has no special interests and is feeling bored. She accidentally runs into young Paul Martel one very windy day when she is in the city, inevitably leading to an affair. Of course the husband hires a detective and finds out and things go horribly and tragically wrong.
  This movie exposes the true tragedy and heartbreak of infidelity and how it destroys the nuclear family in varying ways. The son begins to feel nervous and insecure and he knows something is wrong. The wife at first experiences the thrill and the giddiness of a raw lascivious encounter, but it fades fast and she is wracked with guilt, shame, and paranoia.  She becomes addicted to her sessions with Paul even though it began simply out of boredom and has no chance of lasting. Of special interest to me is the casting of Richard Gere as the husband who is cheated on. the fact that her husband is devoted to her has a successful business and is a good provider and looks like Richard Gere emphasizes how futil this endeavor really is. Paul Martel has nothing going for him over Richard Gere except for his youth and the novelty of something new.. As in real life Richard Gere , playing the blindsided spouse suffers the most and falls totally apart when he confronts Paul Martel. True to life, the spouse that has been cheated on does not see it coming and is in the most vulnerable position and is hurt and destroyed the most.  This movie has one different take on infidelity in that it portrays the wife as the cheater. The wife is usually more likely to be cheated on than the husband as in this movie. After all the wife has spent all her time raising children at the expense of her career and all her friends are often mutual as a couple, so when the husband cheats and decides he wants a divorce the wife is left penniless, socially isolated and humiliated and the children suffer immeasurably for years to come. I think what happens in the end of this movie is a metaphor for what happens to the couples marriage. I recommend this movie to all married couples. it will make you appreciate your spouse more and not take advantage.",1463270400,,3238,4.551546391752577

3644743,5,B001HVZOA2,"I found this film excellent on all levels and even more - it impressed me. Below, more of my impressions, with some LIMITED SPOILERS.

Connie (Diane Lane) and Edward Sumner (Richard Gere) are a middle-aged couple who live in suburban New York City with their young son. One day, when shopping in New York, Connie is surprised by a windstorm and very literally bumps into a certain Paul Martel (Olivier Martinez), a young Frenchman carrying a great pile of books... This is as much as I am going to say about the story, because you deserve to discover all the rest by yourself.

This is the remake of 1968 French film ""La femme infidele"", which I didn't see and therefore cannot compare them. However, considering that ""Unfaithful"" really impressed me, I am quite certain that it didn't dishonour the original movie. From the synopsis of ""Le femme infidele"" which I read, it is clear that Adrian Lyne followed the original plot quite closely, albeit some details were of course changed.

This film impressed me in many ways. First, the choice of three main actors was dead on target and the way they were used was nearly perfect. Richard Gere and Olivier Martinez (a genuine French actor by the way) are excellent but to describe the performance of Diane Lane, well, there is simply no words (great legs too)! Rarely was an Oscar nomination as much deserved as the one she got for her role in this film - it is just pity she didn't get the prize...

The scenario is strong, very strong indeed, without any weakness I could notice. The pace of events is initially deceptively slow, before picking up and accelerating - and then slowing again. This is actually exactly how it should be, because this affair is shown as a kind of ""highway to hell"" - and once the infernal flames are reached and make their job, picking up the pieces is quite obviously slower than the disaster itself... Mentioning here hell is very appropriate, as the seductor and tempter in this film has to him a very Mephistophelian charm - and certainly a terrific, highly efficient, obviously well-rehearsed predatory seduction technique... And, quite appropriately, he is a (charming) bringer of mayhem and a tool of destruction...

The filming technique is impressively good, like the incredible use of the windstorm and the train trips opening and closing chapters of the tale, but also all other tricks known to experienced and gifted directors. Intimacy is shown in a tasty, erotic and yet dignified way - even when really rough, primal, quasi animal sex is involved. There is not even one scene vulgar, gross or obscene - even if the abject immorality of the behaviour of two lovers is made quite obvious.

All the eroticism and some occasional discreet humour notwithstanding, this is nevertheless an absolutely heart-breaking tragedy - as it should be. Infidelity is first and before anything else a betrayal - and those make always for painful tales... The film is not highly judgmental, even if it shows clearly the infidelity as a destructive and ultimately repugnant thing. But it also shows, with sadness, that once you got the trifecta of normal life made of family, job and mortgage, well, this fife itself unavoidably steals something from even the most loving couples - and no matter how much you love your family, the urge, the want, the thirst for what was lost, can be virtually irresistible...

LITTLE SPOILER HERE! The ending is deliberately vague, even slightly more so than in the original. Ending a film without a clearly cut solution is always a risky thing (quite frequently it misfires) - but here, I believe it fits just perfectly! The ending is a kind of Rorschach test - once you watched it, you will end the story according to whatever you find in your heart.

At the risk of repeating myself, let's say it again - this film IMPRESSED ME! It will break your heart and it may not be exactly a thing to enjoy, but this is one of those movies TO SEE ABSOLUTELY!",1432080000,,3959,4.75254730713246

3644753,5,B001HVZOA2,"A gripping,frank, and thoughtful movie,which made me shift about in my chair,as it depicts what can so easily go wrong when one partner starts to cheat on the other in a marriage..

The couples son is badly affected as he senses early on,that things are seriously not right,and its just too easy  to .relate to the storyline and realise how it could happen to almost anybody,its actuallyquite frightening!!

3644767,5,B001HVZOA2,"***MILD SPOILERS FOLLOW*** Unfaithful is a no-holds-barred examination of the psychological effects of infidelity and shame.  It not only examines that dynamic in painful detail, revealing all the parties involved as multi-faceted, complex, likable people (nothing simple about it), but also reveals the greater repercussions that ripple outward through virtually every aspect of the family's life- nothing will ever be the same again.  The film also also reveals the depths of marital and parental love.

Most profound is the raw depiction of the insidious effects of shame, regret and guilt- KILLERS, tragic.  Rarely has a film so deftly laid bare these feelings, so that you feel them in your very gut.  Though in this case the impetus for these feelings was infidelity and its aftermath, the same nearly insurmountable, unbearable feelings can result from any rash, selfish, unreasoning act.  Not a particularly pleasant experience, I feel sadder but wiser for having seen this.  Three other films it brings to mind, with similar themes (none involving infidelity), are&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Return/dp/B005DWBIAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Return</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Japanese-Story/dp/B0001L3LUO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Japanese Story</a>, with Toni Colette, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Snow-Angels/dp/B001G6WDFM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Snow Angels</a>&nbsp;(though they're all disturbing, especially Snow Angels).  Although Unfaithful has an enigmatic ending open to interpretation that doesn't necessarily provide closure (ditto with Snow Angels), the other two films do (if not immediately, after percolating for awhile).

The acting and directing in Unfaithful is spot on- Diane Lane, Richard Gere and Erik Per Sullivan are alternately winsome, engaging and heartbreaking. This is film-making of the highest caliber.",1424304000,,1996,6.983935742971887

3644779,4,B001HVZOA2,"Unfaithful is a film that tells about a couple living in suburban New York City whose marriage goes dangerously awry when the wife indulges in an adulterous fling with a stranger she encounters by chance in Manhattan. The screenplay was adapted from the French film,The Unfaithful Wife.

Connie leaves her suburban home on an errand, venturing into Manhattan during a wicked windstorm. On a trash-strewn Soho street, she literally runs into Paul Martel, a handsome young Frenchman carrying a huge stack of books. Connie has a bad scrape on her knee, and is unable to get a cab, so Paul invites her up to his apartment. Paul is quietly flirtatious as he gives Connie some ice and a bandage for her knee. Connie phones home and explains to her son, Charlie, that she's running late. Before she leaves, Paul gives her a book of Persian poetry. She mentions the encounter in passing to Edward , her husband, but it's clear that she's obsessing about Paul, and soon she's back in the city, with a pretext for calling him up. Soon, they are lovers, and they grow bolder and bolder in their passion. Edward begins to suspect, and eventually gets a private investigator to follow Connie. His worst fears confirmed, Edward decides to confront Paul, a decision that will come to haunt him.

Unfaithful elevates the film because of the solid performance of the cast especially Diane Lane. While the screenplay may have been said to be recycled plots especially with adultery genres and adds nothing new to this type of films,the performances saves the film from mediocrity. Also,the resolution between the marital strife between Connie and Edward is something that would be far from satisfying. It seems that Lyne never learned from making Fatal Attraction.",1420588800,,1746,4.915254237288136

3644805,4,B001HVZOA2,"I've seen this movie many times, and I don't know what it is that keeps me coming back.

I think it's because we want a different ending for the family.  You know this couple loves each other, and an impulsive decision, that was fueled mostly by boredom, in a marriage that was TOO idyllic, changed their lives forever. You want to go back in time, as you see in one of the last scenes, and ""turn left instead of right""

Very well directed By Adrian Lynne.  The quiet shots of the beautiful Connecticut home on a pond, where a bit of wind knocks the bicycle over, would have just seemed like good cinematography, if not for the ominous symbolism.
Richard Gere and Diane Lane were both very good, and especially Gere, who shows, maybe we are all capable of unimaginable acts, under the wrong circumstances.",1411257600,,805,4.531034482758621

I had already seen this movie once before and this time I found it more depressing than enjoyable, again, because one could actually feel the emotions of the characters. Actually, the movie was ""darker"" than I had remembered. How humans can get themselves caught up in such messes when their lives were doing well in the first place. I found the final scene a bit unsettling, as it rather left it up to the viewer as to whether the Gere character would ""turn himself in"" or not. At least I was left with that question. Leads one to ask, what would I do in that same situation?

There is also an interesting clip toward the end, which raises the question as to how the Diane Lane character could have done the whole thing differently had she not taken the ""fork in the road"" that she did; she sees the alternative choice in her mind. Of course, if she had not taken that fork in the road, there would not have been a story, just another happy couple going through their lives.

This movie focuses on things that are not relevant (the couple's kid peeing in the bathroom...the kid doing things at home that reek of boredom...it made me feel sorry for the kid (and dog) because everything is so dull in that house and the mother is so immature and narcissistic.  Richard Gere played a very mature, patient, totally loving father/husband.  He remains very attractive and I would jump at a chance to marry this guy.
  The lover is dull and one-dimensional.  He is a sex-object and eye candy for every woman portrayed in the movie (and dumb, in my opinion).  How do you pronounce 'duh' in French?
  Diane Lane is pretty, but not a jaw-dropping gorgeous babe, which actually helps us keep it all in perspective.  She made a choice and brought havoc on her family.  Olivier Martinez is cute enough, even with a lump in his nose, but such a 'mark' for an overly sexed older woman who ultimately destroys him with her own passion.  So the movie is believable, I will give it that.",1404518400,,1046,4.564516129032258

While ""Unfaithful"" tries hard to be what it's trying to be,it's actually an entire cheese-fest. I can't help but laugh everytime I sit through it.

Diane Lane is so incredible that it's almost like experiencing the ""act of"" without physically doing so. Richard Gere's performance is so great that the love and hate he has for her in the movie makes you feel as if it's towards yourself and you just understand.

I'm sure this is the same scenario played behind closed doors all over the place, until the climax of the story. I won't spoil it for others here, but what happens is traumatic and sad.

3644920,2,B001HVZOA2,"When this movie was released in 2002 I wasn't in a rush to see it. The same holds true of its initial release to DVD. So when I got the blu-ray copy in it took me a while to get around to it. By the end of the film I realized I wasn't wrong in putting it off.

Diane Lane plays Connie Sumner, a suburban housewife and mother who loves her husband Charlie (Richard Gere) and adores her son. On a trip to New York she finds herself in the midst of a wind storm and bumps into a young man named Paul (Olivier Martinez) carrying a load of books. They help one another up and he offers her the use of his bathroom to clean up and bandage a nasty scrape on her knee. This act of kindness ends up in flirtation but nothing comes of it. Until later.

As she recalls the encounter, Connie ends up going back to meet with Paul and an affair ensues. Connie finds herself caught up in the moment, exhilarated by the secretive meetings and sexual involvement but at the same time knowing that she's putting her life back home in jeopardy. It's not that she's unhappy at home or that she's married to someone who treats her bad or ignores her, but she feels something is missing.

Charlie becomes suspicious as Connie's attitude at home changes. The head of a security firm it doesn't take much for him to find someone to follow her and discover just what is going on. How he handles this, what he does after he discovers the affair makes up the latter part of the movie.

This movie just felt like something that the actors walked through. I know during discussions in the extras (one of which is their appearance on the CHARLIE ROSE SHOW) they talk about the depth of their characters and the inner meanings of what transposes during the film, but I never felt that there was the depth that they speak of during interviews.

Director Adrian Lyne has made a career out of sexually charged films in which his characters often toss aside the morality of the day to explore their more animal natures. 9 1/2 WEEKS, FATAL ATTRACTION, INDECENT PROPOSAL and LOLITA are just a few and to me I see a director obsessed with his own views of morality attempting to justify them rather than a film maker intent on making a good movie. In truth I was never a fan of any of these films and found them far too predictable. This one was the same with a slight twist but one that was unsatisfying.

The film will find a number of viewers though. These will be fans of Lane, a beautiful woman who I am certain fills the dreams and imaginations of many lonely males in this world. They will rent or purchase this movie based not on an interest in the film but because somewhere online they discovered pictures of her nude connected to this film. If that's the only reason to watch this then take my advice and don't bother.",1342569600,,2791,4.326959847036329
3644921,4,B001HVZOA2,"I watched this movie when it first came out and remembered thinking it was good.  I saw part of it on TV last weekend and then decided to rent it.  I found it to be very powerful and thought both Gere and Lane really nailed their parts.  But, I came away vaguely unsatisfied by the result.  After thinking about it, I realized the problem was that Lynn made two movies.  The first half is a very good movie about an affair and its impact on the women who is involved and her husband.  The second half is a mostly bad movie about a murder and its aftermath.  Unfortunately, Lynn stopped the first movie in the middle to make the second movie. If he'd continued, we would have been able to follow the aftermath of the affair to its conclusion.  Connie would have been forced to try to tearfully beat back Paul's attempts to reignite the affair.  She would have been depressed for some period about the end of the liason.  Lynn could have found some plot device to permit Edward to get into Paul's apartment without revealing his identity so he could see the outline of Connie's body on the sheets, retrive the knicknak Connie gave as a gift and heard Connie's tearful goodbye phone message which confirmed just how deeply she had fallen in love.  As Connie came out of her fog, she would have tried to reconnect with Edward and found him curiously reticent.  She would eventually have come across the knicknak and photos, realized that he was aware of the affair and discovered that he was incredibly hurt and angry.  To save her marriage, she would have had to find some way to salve his wounds.  Otherwise, she would end up with a divorce she never intended.  At some point, we would have been able to hear Edward's angry tirade without the confession of murder.  We would also have heard Connie's apology/explanation/acknowlegement of the pain she caused Edward with some sort of retrospective from her on what she thought about it all.  This would have been a good movie.  Given how well Lane and Gere were handling their roles, it might have been a really good movie.
 Instead, what we got was Gere killing Paul.  He hardly seems culpable since he is portrayed as being in a vodka and grief induced fog and clearly never intended murder.  He then spends the rest of the movie apologizing to his wife, either implicitly or explicitly, for killing her lover.  This is frankly what is so unsatifying.  The first half of the movie clearly portrays Connie having created the mess.  If somebody was going to suffer consequences, I, and I suspect I was not alone, wanted it to be her.  I wanted her to tell us what she thought about the affair once all of its consequences became apparent.  I never got to hear that.  In the end, she is forgiving Edward.  I wanted the question at the end to be whether Edward would forgive her, since if there forgiving to be done, it seemed to me that was the proper direction.  I was simply not able to engage in the final dilemma.  The whole tone of the movie was that Paul's death was not really Edward's fault. I had no interest in seeing him arrested.  In short, Lynn seemed to allow what should have been a really good extramarital affair morality tale get hijacked by his fealty to the plot of the French original.  Its too bad.  He could have made an excellent movie.",1339286400,,3306,4.502521008403361
3644922,4,B001HVZOA2,"This movie was a stylish excursion down Moral Ambiguity Lane. Diane Lane plays suburban wife and mother Connie Sumner. A chance encounter with a young Parisian book dealer on a surrealistically windy day leads her irresistably astray. The way she is played by the charming Ms Lane makes her surprisingly sympathetic. You know that what she is doing is wrong, and she has no excuse other than boredom, but you kind of hope that she can just have her fling, see the error of her way, and go back to her son and husband.

Connie Sumner: We could end this now and nobody would get hurt
Paul: I'd get hurt.

It is a testament to her acting that the audience feels such sympathy. Indeed, Lane's career has had its ups and downs, but this role was definitely a high point, earning her an Oscar nomination. Her path has crossed with co star Richard Gere before, and would again, but if Unfaithful was her zenith, then The Cotton Club, also with Richard Gere, was her nadir. She was nominated for a Razzie Award for that one.

[First Line]
Charlie: Dad, look what I can do. I've been practicing
[Makes fart noise with armpit]

All in all, Unfaithful worked out pretty well for all concerned. Director Adrian Lynne always makes a big impact, but often his biggest box office successes are met with critical disdain: Flashdance, Fatal Attraction, Nine 1/2 Weeks, In Unfaitful the direction is almost over-the-top at points, but it all works in the service of the story, creating strong moods and conjuring strong emotions. Diane Lane's performance was also well controlled, subtle, actually, even though she ran the gamut of emotions. Her son, played by Erik Per Sullivan, the youngest kid from Malcolm in the Middle, did a great job. Richard Gere was understated at first, letting Lane do the heavy lifting, until the time came for him to explode. Olivier Martinez, who played Connie Sumner's lover Paul Martel, was perfect for the part. The Bottom Line is that Unfaithful is kind of a chick flick, but it was really well done. It can be enjoyed by people of either gender who enjoy a good drama about the consequences of infidelity.

Connie Sumner: I think this was a mistake.
Paul: There is no such thing as a mistake. There are things you do, and things you don't do.

3644923,5,B001HVZOA2,"Unbridled intimacy turns into a wild, destructive fire of passion - that burns out of control - in the now famous 'Diane Lane at her best' chick flick ""Unfaithful"" (shown a hundred times on cable TV); starring Richard Gere and Olivier Martinez; directed by Adrian Lyne in 2002. Remade from the French film and morality play ""La Femme infidel"" (aka, ""The Unfaithful Wife""); as directed by Claude Chabrol in 1968. Plot Synopsis: Edward Sumner accidentally discovers his wife Connie 'is not where she is suppose to be'; he hires a P.I. to investigate 'her feminine movement behind the scenes', and soon finds out that Connie is sleeping with a book connoisseur named Paul Martel. Excellent scripting, direction, film editing, acting, and production work carry this 'crime of passion' into the hidden vaults of classical infidelity-themed storylines. All unities adhered to. Has a powerful d&eacute;nouement that deserves viewing after wine and supper on a rain-soaked night of romantic enchantment.

Adult themes prevail on a bed of sensuality. Seems to drench the soul even after repeated viewings, mainly because of Lane's powerful, subtle performance and the guilt her character Connie must bear - while raising her innocent son, Charlie, who pays a terrible price for her infidelity. Clearly Lane captured her persona with exceptional dedication to her artform.

After a movie was over I would run down to the screen to ascertain how the people accomplished this feat. Since I grew up in the late 1940's and 1950's, every weekend and sometimes during the week, if I had completed all my homework completed, I would make a beeline to the Rosewood Theater in Memphis. I watched every movie released, re-released, shown on the TV Late Show, and the TV Late Late Show. The movies of today are aimed at the 15 to 24 year old male and female (equal rights, women's rights, etc.). There absolutely must be at least 15 minutes of a gratuitous sex scene. The movie ""Fatal Attraction"" is a classic example of sex selling. Of course the movie ""Unfaithful"" has more than its share of nudity and sexual intercourse, but the story line as brought to the screen, demands the revelation of the intense and devastating relationship between a typical husband and wife when the wife is unfaithful. My wife asked me after we had seen the movie were they really having sexual intercourse? I am glad that Amazon.com is a quick resource on the Internet for the unabridged DVD. Sometimes sex augments the tempo of the movie and most of the time it merely is added to the movie to get an ""R"" rating so that the 14 to 25 year old male/female will be enticed to view it in their ""local theater.""",1334102400,,1383,4.385214007782102

I've noticed in t.v. and movies, female infidelity is treated much more lightly than male infidelity. If a man cheats, he's scum...but if a woman cheats, she has a good reason to. She was just lonely, bored, or angry at how unfairly her boyfriend/husband treated her. Whatever the reason, it's excusable.

For example, on the show The Office, we're to excuse Pam's emotional affair with Jim because her fianc is a jerk.  In the movie Titanic, we should excuse Rose's emotional affair because her fianc's a jerk, too.  In the movie A Perfect Murder, same thing, except it's a husband who's a jerk.

No one expects females, with their delicate ways, to handle adult problems in an adult way...and this movie is no exception.  Although Connie's husband Edward isn't a jerk, we're supposed to understand and forgive her affair because she was bored with her life.  To help better understand her ""pain"", we're given lots of symbolic images such as:

1 --- The wind forcing Connie and her future lover to touch each other.
This is basically the ""it just happened"" excuse cheaters are famous for giving. It's saying they didn't WANT this to happen. The wind made them do it. It just happened.

2 --- Connie struggles to cook two things at once and can't pay attention to either.
This is supposed to symbolize how hard it is to juggle two lovers at once. However, Connie didn't seem to have trouble with this.  After the first sexual encounter with her affair partner, she was practically giddy with excitement. Even at the end, during her fantasy goodbye to him, she still thanks him for a good time.

3 --- Their son wets his pants and Connie comforts him, saying we all have accidents.
This is supposed to symbolize that affairs happen by accident and that no one is perfect. However, being perfect isn't a prerequisite to being trustworthy.  Having good character is.  Also, affairs are intentional violations, not innocent, accidental mistakes like involuntarily wetting your pants. This is really just another version of the ""it happened"" excuse.

4 --- Edward is so angry, he hits Connie's lover over the head.
This is supposed to symbolize how passion can make us do crazy things....just like Connie's passion made her do a crazy thing like cheat.  Can we really blame her?

5 --- Edward wants to leave with a dead body, but gets stuck in the elevator instead.
This is supposed to symbolize how an affair can make you feel trapped feeling like there's no way out. However, Connie entered the affair from her own free will, so it's not like her affair partner held her hostage.  She also longed to see her lover again, so she stayed because she wanted to.

6 --- Edward has a dead body in the trunk while his family is in the car, unsuspecting.
This is supposed to symbolize how, when you have an affair, you have this dark secret you have to pretend isn't there while with your family. Again, the wife seemed to manage this fine. And without remorse.

Although these symbols were meant to tug at my heart strings, they didn't and neither did Connie's ""remorse"".  For example, when Connie left her affair partner a voicemail message saying she's ending the affair to devote time to her family, I wasn't buying it.  Prior to this scene, she caught her affair partner with another woman and was outraged.  Therefore, ending the affair was really about punishing him for stringing her along (even though she was doing the same thing to him) and not some deep love for her family.

If Connie really cared for Edward, she wouldn't have abused his trust the way she did and been so cruel to him.  This is woman, after all, who gave her affair partner a gift her husband gave to her.  How cold-blooded is that?

If Connie really cared for her son, she wouldn't risk exposing him to adultery, which would force him to choose sides.  Although the son conveniently never finds out, in real life, kids do and it's a devastating discovery.

This is the same director who made Fatal Attraction and just like in that movie, things are wrapped up too neatly at the end.  In both stories, you simply kill off the lover and the marriage is saved.  Edward shows a little anger but is mostly understanding, even giving his wife space to grieve her lover in peace.  In real life, Edward would've either left Connie or stayed, never fully trusting her the way he did.",1270080000,,4366,4.675392670157068
3644933,5,B001HVZOA2,"Unfaithful is a film that stirs your senses, from the initial temptation to the bittersweet ending.

There are many films dealing with a man's infidelity to his wife (Lyn's Fatal Attraction, for one), but this movie takes the other perspective. It tells the story of a seemingly happily married woman's affair with a handsome stranger, and how such a chance encounter can turn everyone's life upside down.

There's a lot to intrigue the viewer in this movie--from the way the clandestine affair is revealed to the sordid aftermath.

Diane Lane is amazing as always, and Richard Gere's performance will floor you. If you don't feel his character's pain, especially in the pivotal scene, you must not have a pulse.

What's also amazing about this movie (kudos to director Lyne) is how fleshed-out the characters are. Whereas in many films of this genre the viewer knows just whom to blame, whom to call the villain, whom to call the victim, this one, on the other hand, portrays each character with depth and empathy, blurring the lines between good and evil, accident and purposefulness, right and wrong.

This film is also beautifully filmed--a lot of sepia tones (maybe a statement as to the haziness of good and bad as portrayed in the film)--and the music by Jan A.P. Kaczmarek is haunting and lovely at the same time. Perfect is what it is.

A definite 5-star film.",1253750400,,1369,4.829059829059829

3644935,5,B001HVZOA2,"When it comes to adult-themed moralistic storytelling, Adrian Lyne is the master.  He strips out the schlockiness of Fatal Attraction and provides us with a morality tale of what adultery does to the betrayer, betrayed and the lover.  Yes, as Amazon points out, the movie does turn partially predictable, but that doesn't detract from its power.  The theme of adultery and its consequences is timeless.  C.f. 2 Sam. 11:2-17.

I was curious to see what my reactions and impressions would be watching this film after finding out about my wife's affair, having seen it once before the affair, and a second time just recently.  It rings as true now as it did before my wife's infidelity, but has become even more poignant and at times difficult to bear.  But who said movies were only supposed to make you feel good?

""There are no mistakes.  There's what you do, and what you don't do"" Oliver Martinez' Paul Martel says at one point.

Ok.. my take on the movie is this:

Richard Gere is as good as it gets, he can express more with his face and eyes than most actors can with a film full of dialogue. You can read it in his face, the sense of betrayal and heartbreak which turns to anger and desperation with one quickly placed eyebrow. Diane Lane on the other hand, seems to be pumped full of tranquilizer. She remains expressionless the entire film, and I lost interest in her character. I really wanted to see her get mad and pound his chest and say ""How could you do this!!!""..but she handles the whole thing while being careful to use her indoor voice. Boring!! I started hoping she would be falsely charged with the murder and Edward would stay silent, getting his revenge and moving on with someone else.

I also think the child element was a tad unnecessary except to make her cheating more deplorable. It needed a deeper twist such as ""Edward"" being responsible for their child's accidental death and her cheating out of anger; Or her becoming pregnant with the new guys baby after years of infertility with ""Edward"". That to me would be more of a breaking point for killing the guy than just finding out she gave him a crummy second hand gift that her husband gave her.

I would have loved to see a big blow up, maybe in front of the kid causing him to run out and get hurt or worse.. well that's bad I know but better drama than what goes down. This is a good movie for a boring afternoon when your home alone with Chinese Food... LOL. Overall the movie is good .. largely because of the excellent Eye Candy that is Richard Gere.",1239062400,,1750,4.342507645259939
3644937,5,B001HVZOA2,"Diane Lane received an Oscar nomination as Best Actress, playing a bored housewife and mother who has an affair with a young, hunky man played by Olivier Martinez. Directed by Adrian Lyne, who directed ""Fatal Attraction, the movie is well acted and produced. One would think the audience would hate any woman who cheats on Richard Gere in a film, but this is not the case; we really understand why a woman would wander away from her beloved husband and home insearch of fufillment in the arms and bed of another man. The story explodes with a shocker as one of the 3, caught in this triangle, is murdered. I really love this film, and I have watched it over and over because it is a perfect movie.
 The DVD also contains a ton of bonus features with commentary from the director and cast, 11 deleted scenes, and Richard Gere, Diane Lane, and Adrian Lyne being interviewed on ""The Charlie Rose Show"". I also have to add that Olivier Martinez, who plays the boyfriend, is an absolute stud in this fim.",1237507200,,999,4.519337016574585

3644939,5,B001HVZOA2,"Much like her role as an adulterous wife in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Walk-on-the-Moon/dp/B00000K31T/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Walk on the Moon</a>, the lovely Diane Lane once again plays an everyday housewife (Connie) who strays from her husband (Edward, played by Richard Gere) after being seduced by a dude with an accent.  {So that's what it takes to trump Richard Gere's GQ looks?  An accent?  Hmmmmmm}

The reason why Lane is so absolutely perfect for this role as well as the similar role in MOON is pretty simple:  she is America's sweetheart.  It's precisely because she seems so decent & trustworthy (not to mention beautiful!) that she's ideal to play the destructive vixen.  Gosh, I don't even know Diane Lane, yet I'd trust her to babysit my nieces & nephews in a heartbeat as she appears so likeable!

While adultery stories are fairly commonplace, the switching of gender roles is what makes this film intriguing.  Typically, it's the guy who cheats on the helpless wife (think&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fatal-Attraction/dp/B0019GO58M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fatal Attraction</a>) that comprise this genre.  In this story, it's the wife who is naughty, and willing to risk everything for a few moments of bliss.

Ultimately, the movie details much more than the story of a cheating wife & a cuckhold husband.  It serves as a glimpse of what can happen when adultery intersects with the law of unintended consequences.  Remember:  riding a Romantic rollercoaster can be a lot of fun - so long as the rollercoaster doesn't break down!

If you're a fan of erotic thrillers, this one is a good add to your DVD collection.  If you're a fan of Diane Lane, it's a MUST have.  If you're married and tinkering with the idea of having an affair, it serves as a cautionary tale.",1236124800,,1888,5.477508650519031

3644945,4,B001HVZOA2,"I really enjoy this film, even after multiple vewings it is still effective.  The key is great performances with attention to detail, especially from Diane Lane.  The story too, is well written, also bringing out attention to details and the affair is just half of the tale, as an unexpected event turns things around half-way through the film, releasing a lot of tension, suspision, and unfaithfulness.

One might expect that Unfaithful is about a wife cheating on her husband (been done before and the cover art of the case gives this away).  This is only half of the film, which makes it a fine product altogether.  However, the first half of the film is well accomplished.  We are introduced to the Sumner family, husband Ed (Richard Gere), wife Connie (Diane Lane) and young son of about 8 years of age, Charlie (Erik Per Sullivan).  They live quitely, comfortably in the suburbs in a beautiful white house, picket fence etc etc.  Everything is fine and for the most part the family is happy.  Ed works a lot like most husbands, and one might believe too much work can lead to his wife's affair.  Not so true.  He does a fine job of balancing work and family, spending a lot of time with his boy and equally with his wife, in a variety of tender & romantic encounters.  Connie seems happy but accidently bumps into Paul Martel (Olivier Martinez) on the street one day.  He invites her to his place for a minute, she stays briefly.  Slowly and cautiously, Connie revisits, fighting with herself whether to conintue the visits or let it be.  She visits one too many times, eventually finding herself romantically involved and addicted soonafter.  Yet at the same time, she still spends time with her family, and having fun.  Eventually she begins to break down, realizing she doesn't need this and realizing her husband has always been good to her.  But they always end in disaster, one of her friends states, about affairs.

Connie gets the soptlight in the film, especially in the first half, along with Paul (though there is little exploration to his character, but the story focus is ment to be on Connie).  Ed gets his chance in the second half of the film, when he encounters Paul and an unexpected turn of events occur, haunting him (Ed) for the rest of the film.  It is at this point when the title ""Unfaithful"" is at it's ripest form.  Suspense is finally at its climax, as suspicions begin to rise both from husband and wife.

Unfaithful could have been a suspense thriller, but it is not.  While there are some moments of anger, and a bit of hatred, Unfaithful actually has a very romantic and touching quality to it.  This is very evident in the soundtrack, which is light piano accompanied by a bit of strings throughout most of the film.  The ending scene wasn't very sharp, but the end of the film up to that point actually surpirsed me, in a good way.  I enjoyed seeing acts of love and forgiveness at work.  While Unfaithful contains a lot of sexuality, it is not that kind of film.  There is a rather deeper meaning at play here, performances and story are strong enough, that it might just make you think twice about cheating, and maybe recognize the better parts of a beautiful marriage.

3644946,3,B001HVZOA2,"My defiant support of this film was probably spawned from the atrocity that was Diane Lane's Oscar loss back at the 2002 Academy Awards.  Yes, Nicole Kidman is a great actress who delivered a decent portrayal of Virginia Woolf, but honestly, there was not one performance in any category that year that rivaled that of Diane Lane.  Over the years though I have been able to separate my love for her performance from my feelings towards the film, and what I've found is that this movie as a whole misses the mark and is really only bolstered by the power within Lane's dynamic performance.

The film is quite generic; married woman meets intriguing stranger who entices her into a lurid affair that threatens the fibers of her marriage.  We've seen this many times before (even within the same year we were given `The Good Girl', which as a whole was a better film yet lacked the brilliance that was Lane) but what disappointed me most about `Unfaithful' is that it didn't really execute the film all that great.  Aside from Lane there really isn't anything extraordinary here, not in the acting and not in the script.  I'll give the direction some love since it really grabs you in moments and pains this secluded picture of claustrophobia, which helps elevate the audience's grasp of the emotional state Constance is going through.  The film is nicely shot, but it lacks any real substance to help elevate it above the average infidelity thriller.

The script is probably the biggest culprit here, giving the audience nothing to be too excited about.  The plot twist involving the `murder' is really a stretch and in my opinion drags the movie down that clichd road of no return.  Oliver Martinez doesn't help the film much either.  He's a rather dull actor who comes off somewhat silly in most of his scenes.  Richard Gere (another actor I've never truly `gotten') does his best to rise above his characters setbacks, but he eventually falls victim.

Yes, Diane Lane is really the only member of the acting team who walks away unscathed, which is really another testament to her tremendous performance, for even when she is faced with rather mediocre dialog she owns it in a way that sells it as legit to the audience.

The film does soar in some areas though, which is really why I'm rather torn when I discuss this movie.  Yes, it winds up feeling stale when you take in the entire gist of the film, plot holes and all; but when you separate the segments that feature Lane and her characters gradual breakdown you can't help but see where this film makes sense.  The film really fleshes out Constance in a way that a lot of these genre films aren't able to (yet another testament to Lane's brilliance).  We can see the entire workings of this affair in her head and it draws us to her.  We see her struggle with her motherly duties and we see the way this affair makes her feel free.  This film soars in the area where `Notes on a Scandal' failed (in fleshing out the unfaithful party) yet fails in area where `Notes on a Scandal' soared (in delivering a highly engrossing film).  When we see Constance attack Paul in the library after catching him with another woman we feel her pain, yet we are not immune to her lack of morality.  We know she is wrong yet with sympathize with her, not out of lackadaisical morals but out of desperate understanding.

Connie is a real woman to us.

So, the film itself would get a C from me, maybe even a C-, but Diane Lane alone deserves an A+ (I remember watching the film with my wife and during the first love scene my wife turned to me and said ""is she quivering"" and it was right there that I said ""this girl deserves like twenty Oscars for this"") and her iconic performance is not only the greatest `cheating spouse' portrayal like ever, it elevates the overall appeal of this film drastically.  Like I said, I defiantly supported this mediocrity based on her stunning performance alone for so long.  Sure, I no longer campaign the film, but I will never stop campaigning her performance.",1221696000,,4035,4.594142259414226
3644947,2,B001HVZOA2,"To this viewer this movie, despite the good acting job by Diane Lane, was very disappointing, rather formulaic.  The ending is horrible and could happen only in the movies.

Richard Gere's talent is wasted in this silly story.  I must admit, though, that I liked the little boy and his personality.",1216252800,,463,5.0394736842105265
3644948,5,B001HVZOA2,"Long before the big bombs go off, there are lots of subtle touches in this movie.  Like when the phone number falls out of the book the Frenchman gave her, and she kneals down to see what it is.  And when she realizes she pauses, and as she looks across the room, the dog is sitting on the easy chair, paws folded, looking at her.  Magestically, or like the devil.

Or when she puts her quarter in the pay phone at the station, trying to decide whether to call him or not, and the first time she hangs up, the quarter drops into the change slot and as she takes it out, hesitating again, we see a close up of the quarter in her hand next to the change slot - above Washington's head, the words ""LIBERTY"".

Devices such as these are constantly being used, sometimes very effectively.

While dramatic, it is at the same time definitely a thriller.  There's that element of danger, and in ""Unfaithful"" it's coming out in spades in the form of her husband finding out.  The feeling of crime is palpable - as strong as would be for any robber breaking into a house at night.  The Frenchman, her lover, is rakish, impudent and good-looking, often putting her nerve-wrackingly in the way of danger. Richard Gere's performance as the husband delivers, and Diane Lane pretty much sizzles.  Their kid tends to grow on you, ""Don't be sad, Mom. Dad'll be home tomorrow.""  Or, ""Should we call the cops, Dad?""

Lots of good hurt and feeling like the fool in this movie.  It never bores and seldom pushes the edges of melodrama.  In a nutshell, some pretty intense stuff.  Entertainment factor 5 stars.

Beleivability?  Well, anything's possible, but when you consider that a.) she's got a husband who's just about as successful, handsome and loving as most women could probably want, plus b.) the fact that she's got a child and c.) that her lover is a good few years younger than she is - a dash of salt may be required.

Edward asks her if something is wrong, she says no, but he hires a private dectective and eventually discovers the truth.  He goes to confront Paul and the plot thickens.

If you ever thought of commiting adultry, see this movie and that'll put an end to that idea!  This film held my interest.  It shows a different side---that women do it too and the acts can be devastating.  This was a different role for Gere, and I rather liked him in this.

I highly recommend this movie.  Buy it and enjoy, it is a thriller and not a ""chick flick"".",1202860800,,1286,4.534782608695652

The first hour is a rather interesting character study of a fractured marriage hurtling toward the inevitable disaster (not so subtlely foreshadowed by Kate Burton's character).  The ending may be ""convenient"" to some, ""unsatisfying"" to others but to contemporary audience who have ""seen it all,"" it's certainly true that you cannot please everyone.  It's certainly an engrossing work as a drama AND a thriller thanks to the solid work of Gere, Lane and (maybe surprisingly) Martinez.

Diane Lane's performance earned her an Oscar nomination and she is wonderful in it but Unfaithful has a lot of flaws. Gere is very vulnerable in his role, his wife is having an affair and he wants it to end like any loving husband would. I won't give away the ending but it's pretty much a stinker, see it for the great performances but expect a crappy closing.",1197417600,,519,4.473684210526316
3644952,3,B001HVZOA2,"This infidelity yarn which is actually better than expected is no doubt due to the fine performances and chemistry of the two leads - Diane Lane and Richard Gere. Lane is more than sexy as the spouse who wanders and Gere surprisingly shines as the curious turned jealous then obsessive hubby in a story that takes a different and unexpected twist. An additional twist (if I may play with words) is the formidable tryst who is admirably played by the Frenchman Olivier Martinez. This versatile French actor may have dipped into a bit of his personal past when he sparred in the ring as a boxer to exchange both physical and more notably, mental blows with the respective leads. ""Unfaithful"" also has director Adrien Lynne returning to the infidelity theme he was successful in both his 1993 ""Indecent Proposal"" as well as his 1987 triumph, ""Fatal Attraction"" which is widely recognized as a landmark of the genre. He also attempts to surpass the steamy scenes from an earlier film - 9 1/2 Weeks - that infamously gave him notoriety among film censors but thankfully in this 2002 release the passion is far less bizarre while still being on quite sensual and passionate.",1197158400,,1168,4.787128712871287

When I purchased this movie, I did so on the basis of Diane Lane. I think this is probably her best work to date and it is definately over the top. She plays a cheating wife with Richard Gere in the role of her husband. The movie moves along quite well, and doesn't bog down and get overly talky. If you are a fan of Diane Lane this is a must see. I would like to see more of her work such as: "" Ladies and Gentlemen, The Fabulous Stains"", ""Lady Beware"" and ""Priceless Beauty"" to name a few.

3644956,4,B001HVZOA2,"I really enjoyed this movie.  I have it in my dvd collection.  Both Diane Lane and Richard Gere render remarkable performances in their turns as husband and wife.  In fact it was this movie that made me a fan of Richard Gere.  This movie is full of lust, sex, raw passion and, of course, betrayal.  Pampered housewife meets sexy French book dealer.  Their affairs leads to tragedy.

Diane Lane is absolutely gorgeous.  I have always thought so.  She is killer in this role and I was glad when she received an Oscar nomination for her portrayal of the lusting housewife.  Her character engages in a torrid affair with a book dealer whom she literally runs into one day.  At first she throws herself into the affair but eventually guilt pays her a visit.  Unfortunately guilt comes too late.

The husband, suspecting his wife is being unfaithful, has his wife followed.  He then confronts his wife's lover.  At first the meeting is calm, although the viewer can sense there is a sick morbidity underlying it.  The first time I watched this movie I was unprepared for the scene with the snow globe.  It was so unexpected and sickened me so much that I literally fainted.  It is after this scene that the movie turns to slow decay (not of quality of film but of lives unraveling).  The heaviness of death at first lingers and then becomes pervasive as husband and wife slowly confront the reality of their situation and begin to accept the consequences of their actions.

It is a sad, tragic movie in the end.  Some reviewers have compared it to Fatal Attraction although I don't see the comparison at all.  At the end of this movie, everyone involved loses.  There is a strong moral to this story.  The film is in no way preachy.  Rather it leaves you with a pang in your heart as you grieve for a family torn apart by adultery.

I was tentatively hooked. Anway, the movie really steps up its credibility in the second half by infusing parts of ""Crime and Punishment"" into the mix to make for a really fascinating conclusion. I especially liked the symbolism at the end.

I also recalled while watching this that Diane Lane had received an Academy Awards actress nomination. It was well-deserved. What she does with words and between them is quite good. I plan to rent this on DVD so I can catch the first five or ten minutes I missed.",1154563200,,832,4.859154929577465

Everything is predictable.  One day, Connie is in the City getting supplies for one of her charity events.  She gets caught in wind storm and is blown into a mysterious stranger, Paul Martel.  His charm is felt by Connie but she resists.  But after a while she succumbs to his charms and an affair begins.

Edward begins to suspect something is up and hires a private detective.  It is soon that the detective uncovers the affair.  Edward goes to confront Martel.  In another chance, Edward and Paul get into a fight and Paul is accidentally killed.  Edward hides Paul's body but the death is soon uncovered.

The police come in and interview both Edward and Connie but to no avail.  But Edward's conscience is get to him.  It comes down to run or turn himself in.

Director Adrienne Lynne has gone back to his Fatal Attraction themes and style.  This film depends on style and atmosphere and he gets a great cinematographer (Peter Biziou) and editor (Anne V Coates) to create both.  From the opening scene creating the perfect normal family to the chance meeting to the undecided ending, both cinematography and editing constantly create the right atmosphere and tension.

While the film is not as good as Fatal Attraction, the characters are more rounded.  Both Gere and Lane give outstanding performances.  And Kate Burton (yes daughter of Richard) has a great cameo performance as one of Connie's friends.

3644972,4,B001HVZOA2,"Overall it's an interesting and steamy film that shows the possible consequences of an affair. To my point, I'd almost give this 5 stars just for Diane Lane. This movie confirmed my thoughts that she is one of the hottest women on the planet, and whether you watch ""Unfaithful"" for her amazing acting or body, it's a must for fans of hers.",1131235200,,339,4.483870967741935
3644973,3,B001HVZOA2,"Definitely a great acting crew. I'll have to say that I did and did not like this movie. I enjoyed it because there was great suspense as well as some great scenes of wild passion in the beginning. Olivier Martinez was HOT in this movie. One simply cannot blame Diane Lane's character for falling for him. Infidelity... whether good or bad... the guy was just simply irresitable!
With that said, the first part of the movie had much more action, suspense, and seemed to make alot more sense.

Once Richard Gere's character murdered his wife's lover, the movie became a completely different movie, and became ludicrous. One minute you are watching this steamy, hot and heavy affair-- the next minute your are watching this serious murder cover-up drama. Oliver Martinez goes from being a hot young sexy gigolo, to this heavy, lifeless corpse hanging over Richard Gere's shoulder. The corpse then ends up in several different places including the trunk of Richard Gere's Mercedes as he speeds off to see his young child's school play, as well as a Westchester County dump, while Westchester County police is constantly on the married couple's doorstep.

I as a viewer, I became quite simply annoyed and completely turned off as a result of the drastic change. Not a smooth transition at all.

Diane Lane is captivating. The scene where she's on her way home on the train and thoughts run through her head is incredible. The range of emotions she shows in those few minutes are unbelieveable. That is truly one of the all-time classic, non-verbal scenes in hollywood.

So as many know, the story is about an unfaithful spouse, and it's really not much more than that, but what makes this so great is the desection you get of the human emotions involved.  You see both Diane Lane and Richard Gere stripped of their cheary selves and get to see pure emotions.  The first sexual encounter between Diane Lane and her seducer Olivier Martinez, you can real feel her resistance.  She's shaking so badly, she knows she doing somthing wrong yet she doesn't know how to say no.  It's unsettling if you've ever had a mate cheat, so I guess stay away if thats the case, but it's really a great movie to watch if you want to see pure emotion.  Gere does an amazing job as a tortured husband dealing with his wifes straying, but it all boils down to Lane as she tackles the role of the adultress.  She proves that she has more than enough to make it in the acting world...AMAZING JOB DIANE!!!",1124928000,,979,4.346153846153846
3644978,4,B001HVZOA2,"This film is not a perfect film but it has moments.

A seemingly happy marriage for over 10 years, a couple can communicate without words, such as in Connie and Edward's case.  Why she had an affair was not explained in the film but it was probably because of the usual: bored with suburban soccer mom life, bored having sex with the same guy, bored with routine daily life.  Sure she's pretty and ""has everything"", but she may still feel uninspired, rightly so or not.

When one spouse is having an affair, domestic life WILL BE different.  Edward and the son both noticed small things that were jarring here and there until Edward couldn't ignore the bothering feeling any longer.

In the mean time, viewers see Connie went from soccer mom get-up to increasingly sexy and feminine ""tryst"" outfits to finally, after she decided to end the affair, back to soccer mom sweather and jeans...

This film can also serve as a cautionary tale: never to boast that an affair will never happen in your marriage, to you, or to your spouse.  It never happens because the temptation hasn't been strong enough.

Although most affairs may not end so tragically like in the film but the damage to a marriage (or the trust between the spouses) is almost always permanant.

Hopefully those who've seen the film will think long and hard before ""letting that cab go"".....",1117411200,,1352,4.690677966101695
3644979,3,B001HVZOA2,"Well executed, beautifully shot and acted.  The plot is pretty standard fare.  Bored housewife goes astray with swaggering young French stud, husband gets suspicious, drama ensues.  Nothing special, until....

The climax.  The husband (Richard Gere) follows Frenchie home and confronts him.  ""How dare you""/""How could you""/""Why""/etc.  Then we get this exchange:

  ""I guess she got bored with the suburbs.""
  ""She wanted us to move there....She didn't want to raise our son in the city.""
  ""Really?  She said it was your idea.""
  ""You...you TALK ABOUT ME?!""

That got my attention!  So many movies portray the jealous/betrayed spouse, without bothering to explore the source of those feelings; or else they chalk it up to some simple, easy, animalistic ""if I can't have her"" sort of nonsense.

Gere's character is upset that his wife strayed.  He wants to know how and why it happened.  He wants to know what he was doing wrong.  The situation upsets him, but does not devastate him.  Finding out that they TALK about him is what ultimately delivers the fatal blow (hint!).

Is one's lover a mere possession, or a signpost advertising one's self-image to the world?  Or something else?  Interesting philosophy in the strangest of places!  Where would the movie take this?!

Unfortunately, the writers dropped the ball.  They either didn't realize what they had, or it was an accident, or they didn't know what to do with it.  For about ten minutes this movie was really, really interesting; then it fizzled out into your standard, boring, cliched hide-the-body-lie-to-the-cops garbage.  Oh well.

3644980,3,B001HVZOA2,"Diane Lane looks gorgeous and acts brilliantly in this entirely predictable and formulaic remake of Chabrol's ""La Femme Infidele"", predictable that is, even if you do not know the original.  An unfaithful wife, so guess what the husband is like...correct, that's just what he's like.  Guess what sort of lover she goes with...yes, that's him to a T.  And so on, except for the very end, which will keep you guessing, even after you have seen it.  But never mind, it also kept the producers guessing, because they came up with two endings, both of which can be seen on the DVD.

Although the events of the story are no surprise, the way in which they happen is totally implausible.  I cannot give details, because spoilers are against my religion.  I will just recommend that you have your incredulity fast asleep and safely tucked up in bed before you watch this movie.

And why would you watch it?  Diane Lane, that's why.  She was deservedly Oscar-nominated for this performance and if there had been a category for best legs in a leading role she would have won it.  Watch out for the scene in the subway, where she recalls her first illicit liaison.

I'm saying as a whole this movie is well acted, and brilliantly directed with all the pieces fitting together even up to the ending scene (in front of the police station, with a red light).  So the million dollar question is... Do they turn themselves in or do they go on pretending that they can just forget everything that has happened by quote... ""Moving to Mexico and fishing all day"".  HMMM...now that's the question now isn't it?  So the truth of the matter is...Commiting the crime and living with it are two different things completely...and that to me is what is truly... UNFAITFUL!",1111708800,,702,4.629032258064516
3644982,4,B001HVZOA2,"Adrian Lyne's ""Unfaithful"" is, in many respects, a spin through familiar waters for the director -- the crushing impact of infidelity on a marriage. After all, this is the man who directed two other notorious films on the subject -- ""Fatal Attraction"" and ""Indecent Proposal.""  While there are similarities between all three films, ""Unfaithful"" is the strongest of the three because it is the most intelligent.

In an Oscar-nominated performance, Diane Lane plays Constance Sumner, beloved-and-somewhat-bored wife and mother.  That her husband is Edward, played by Richard Gere (very sexy as always, but in a mainstream way), seems to be small consolation to her as she rattles around her waterfront Westchester County neo-mansion and cares for her lovely-yet-slightly-troubled son, Charlie (Erik Per Sullivan, unfortunately denied any of the zaniness he exhibits as the youngest son on TV's ""Malcom in the Middle"").  Constance is one of those ""housewives"" who has a maid to keep the house in order, freeing her up to take trips into Manhattan to organize charity events.

Lyne subtly creates a sense of tension from the very first scenes in the Sumner household.  This is one heck of a beautiful house on a beautiful lake filled with beautiful people, but the colors have been leeched out of everything.  From the wondrous foliage to the handsome clothes, everything is a muted shade of brown or gray . . . even the reds and blues.  This is not the bright, joyous household it should be.  A gift of a strikingly blue sweater introduces a jarring note into this marriage.

Thus we are not surprised when, on a trip into SoHo on perhaps the windiest day of the year, Constance bumps into Paul Martel (Olivier Martinez), a Frenchman who looks like a cover model but is in fact a Bohemian book dealer living in one of those wonderful industrio-residential New York flats.  Constance tries vainly to hail a cab, but is unsuccessful and is ""forced"" to go up to Paul's apartment . . . although it appears that she kinda-sorta lets one last cab go by unhailed before heading upstairs.

Paul, convinced of his Gallic charm and good looks, instantly sets out seducing Constance, but in a restrained way.  He offers her a book from his mammoth collection, tells her exactly which book to pick up, which page to turn to, and which passage to read -- lines which are classic ""carpe diem"" sentiments for those about to cast aside virtue.  As Paul says later, in an exercise of Euro-trash philosophy, ""There are no mistakes.  Only things you do and things you do not do.""

While Constance initially refuses his advances, it is no spoiler that in a movie titled ""Unfaithful"" that she ultimately succumbs and engages in a tumultuous affair.  (This, by the way, is an affair that allows Lyne to cover the near-pornographic ground he failed to cover in his earlier film, ""9 1/2 Weeks,"" as Constance and Paul have encounters in theaters, bathrooms, hallways, and even occasionally the bed.)

Lane, who almost always plays a likeable character, plays a real rhymes-with-witch in ""Unfaithful.""  Why?  Because she is not driven into this affair -- she chooses to engage in it.  Why?  Because Paul excites her, and Edward doesn't.  Sure, Edward is a bit of a workaholic, and their marriage (11 years in) is in a bit of a rut.  But just like you screamed at Michael Douglas for cheating on Anne Archer in ""Fatal Attraction"" (as in, ""What the hell are you thinking, you schmuck?""), you want to scream at Constance for dismissing her marriage so casually.

Sure, Constance is conflicted.  She even introduces herself to Paul as ""Constance,"" as if the implication of morality (""Constance"" = ""constancy"") will help her fend of this Lothario.  In a delightful, subtle jab at her, Edward keeps referring to her as ""Connie,"" with its implications of immorality (""Connie"" = ""con"" = ""con-job"").  But even when she tries to break it off ""before anyone gets hurt,"" she relents when Paul says, ""I'd get hurt.""  Well, too darn bad, bub, we want to say, but Constance wouldn't hear us, anyway.

Ultimately, Edward discovers the affair, and he tracks down Paul.  This is where the movie comes to life -- Edward, Constance, and even Paul each attempt to resolve this unresolvable situation as best they can -- we thankfully do not undergo a reprise of Glenn Close's meltdown in ""Fatal Attraction.""

Solid performances by Gere and Martinez anchor the film, while Lane reaches new heights as she runs the gamut of boredom to anticipation to regret to delight to anguish.  This is a film to be discussed, where the characters are human, and can occasionally be moved to inhuman heights and depths.  Check it out.

The DVD has the standard extras, including deleted scenes and an alternate ending.  The director's commentary is helpful, except for his dissertation on why he likes to live in Provence, France, while reading and writing screenplays -- it added nothing to my understanding of the film, and made me insanely jealous.  Other than that, a good DVD for a very good film.",1108425600,,5037,4.869718309859155
3644983,2,B001HVZOA2,"I had wanted to see this movie when it came out on DVD a year or two ago but never had the chance to rent it. This weekend it was on the TNT channel so I tuned in.  First let me say that the previews were much better than the movie itself. I don't know if it's because it was the t.v. version, but I found this movie to be totally lacking.

First of all, I have no idea what job the wife in the movie had that let her get all dressed up and go into the city every single day.  Her husband kept mentioning something about ""fund raising"" but I never quite got what she actually did. Secondly, the day she met the book-guy I have never, ever seen wind like that except in a hurricane.  Thirdly, any woman who finds herself in a strange neighborhood (which obviously she was in by the way she kept looking around confused), would most definitely NOT go up to some strangers apartment for a band-aid even when he said that he was ""not an axe murderer"".

Now for the spoiler. . .I can understand why the husband was upset when he met the ""other man"", and why he would have gone to see him. What I don't get is this:  Why did he suddenly get all sweaty and feel sick? He kept saying ""I don't feel well. I'm sick"" and you can see the sweat pouring down his face and meanwhile his vision was all blurry and tilty. Was his drink drugged or were we supposed to assume that he was in a ""red rage"" after finding the snow globe he gave his wife, who turned around and gave to this guy? Also, killing him with the snow globe? COME ON!!!

The bitter irony after the bludgeoning is the wife calling book-guy and leaving a message that it's over.

And now we get into the desposing of the body. . . Richard Gere wraps the guy in a sheet, then in a rug and duct tapes in together.  He then has to drag the body-shaped shroud down the stairs to the car because the elevator is broken. A guy out there sees him struggling and asks ""Can I help you with that"" never once questioning the body-shaped, duct-taped wrapped shroud.  HELLO?!?  And then, later that night he gets rear-ended in a parking lot -- in a parking space for that matter which I can't quite figure out how that happens -- and he can't quite shut the trunk and gets snippy with the guy who hit him when he asks if he could help him close it.  Okay, raise your hand if you'd be suspicious about this.  That's what I thought!

Finally, we come to the incompetent police people.  This is where I think the movie probably could have gone on and maybe gotten better, but it didn't. The police come and talk to the wife and husband because they found her name on a piece of paper in the book-guys apartment. She lies and he dove-tails off that lie (very poorly I might add) to make it seem like they met him at some event.  You don't have to be in law enforcement to be able to spot the lies they spewed. Then after they found the body (which was deposited in a land fill -- how cliched), they come back and talk to the wife and husband again, finding very obvious errors in their stories -- asking when the wife was in that neighborhood and she said never but they point out the parking ticket she had gotten --  but they never charge them or tell them that they're suspects.

Then later on that night (I belive but it doesn't really matter) wife sees the snow globe that she had given to the book guy back on her shelf.  She then confronts the husband and an extremely weak ""argument"" ensues.

At the end, they try very hard to make you think ""Did he turn himself in? Didn't he? What's going to happen?"" But to be honest, at that point I didn't really care what happened, and I couldn't belive I had watched the whole thing.

Richard Gere did a very good job in the film and he was more likeable than his rather annoying wife. The wife was memorable in some scenes and quite over dramatic in others. I think she over acted in some scenes and the best acting accomplished by her was towards the end when she is being questioned by the cops. The sex scenes are uninspiring and hardly erotic, unless seeing two immature and neurotic adults having sex like  rabid dogs is your idea of "" sexy sex "". I thought the sex scene in the empty movie house was funny and dumb all at the same time. The French guy is utterly annoying with his contrived cheesy lines. I was so anoyed by the French man that when he died I actually felt relieved knowing i wouldn't have to listen him talk again, plus he needed a new hairstyle.

3644985,4,B001HVZOA2,"If it wasn't for the knockout performance of Diane Lane, Adrian Lyne's UNFAITHFUL wouldn't have turned out as well as it did.  Lane is incredible as the suburban housewife who decides for some reason never explained to have an affair with a handsome Frenchman she bumps into during a windstorm.  Although to her credit, she does at first fight the temptation, she gives in and has a passionate, almost kinky sexual relationship with the dashing book dealer.  There are some incredibly powerful scenes where no words are spoken, especially when Lane after her first encounter with Paul, shows us the conflicting emotions of joy, humor, rage, and frustration, and she cries and laughs at the same time.  Lane's performance deservedly got her an Oscar nomination.  She is truly brilliant in this role.

Richard Gere as her husband, Ed, is very good also, although his controlled performance stifled his rage; Olivier Martinez as Paul, the lover, is appropriately shallow and self-focused; he doesn't even tell Lane he's married (separated), and she finds him with another young lovely who he claims is a friend.  Eventually, the affair leads to a tragic ending, and one which only reinforces Lane's foolishness.  She even gives Paul a snowglobe that Gere had given her!  Talk about bad taste!

But Lane and Gere see it through to the end, an ending that is ambiguous, and explained more in detail in the deleted scenes.

3644987,4,B001HVZOA2,"Claude Chabrol is regarded as a virtuoso on criminal enigmas in the cinema and he is also considered to be the birthfather to the French New Wave in cinema, which introduced aggressive jump cuts and a new way of portraying cinema.  Chabrol has made forty some films such as Le Beau Serge (1958), Les Biches (1968), Le Boucher (1970), and recently Flower of Evil (2003). In 1969 Chabrol wrote and directed Le Femme Infidle, which is the root for the remake Unfaithful by Adrian Lyne.  It was just a question of time until someone would remake one of Chabrol's films.  Lyne seems to be the perfect match for this as he also has a past of mysterious and suspenseful films such as Fatal Attraction (1987) and Jacobs Ladder (1990).

Unfaithful begins with displaying the chaotic life of the housewife Connie (Diane Lane) as her job is to provide a good home for her husband, Ed (Richard Gere), and their son.  Amidst the daily chores Connie is also heavily involved in fundraising and antiquities while the son is at school and the Ed is at his security firm.  This chaotic lifestyle which seems to be in a rut as everyday occurs in a similar fashion.  However, a fresh wind blows Connie's way when she bumps into the young book dealer Martel (Olivier Martinez).  Martel lives in an old apartment that is overcrowded with books, and Connie is devoured by Martel's charismatic and well-read mind.

Ed is a loving and faithful husband with a mountain of trust for his wife.  However, Connie begins to act strange in minute manners and the small things that she does bewilder Ed.  This perplexed mental state of Ed leads him to further express his love for Connie as he believes that he is wrong, but to his shocking revelation she does not return it.  The unanswered love leads Ed to hire a good friend and private detective to find out the truth.  The truth leads Ed to a strong internal pain.  A pain that is so strong that it hinders clear thoughts and actions, which leads to a bloody event.

Lyne does a marvelous job directing the film as it provides similar suspense that the audience will receive from Chabrol's films.  Diane Lane performs brilliantly; a performance that nominated her for several cinematic awards for her part.  The tense atmosphere is enhanced through Diane Lane's performance as small visual details reveal minute change in emotions and these changes lead the audience to experience a good cinematic remake.",1098662400,,2428,4.729216152019003
3644988,4,B001HVZOA2,"Unfaithful is very absorbing and fun to watch; it careens from a sexy drama to a murder drama, and doesn't skip a beat. Diane Lane is excellent, and Richard Gere (in a much more subtle performance) is outstanding. Olivier Martinez doesn't get a chance to do all that much acting-wise, but he's quite handsome to look at.

What is frustrating are the things that make no sense. Why in the world did Connie cheat on her husband? When Edward finally confronts her and she starts to explain, he tells her he doesn't want to hear it. Fine for him -- but I sure did!! It's also frustrating that Connie could be such an UNBELIEVABLY rotten liar, and get away with stuff so easily. She tells the cops she's never been in her lover's apartment, and doesn't know when she last saw him. Uh, Connie, there are these little things nowadays called fingerprints and dna... perhaps you've heard of them? Not to mention that she attacked her lover's girl friend in a library, where probably a hundred people saw her being pulled out. What was taking so long for her to be taken downtown? It's also frustrating that her son can't ask what they're having for breakfast without Connie flashing her husband a ""isn't he just the cutest kid?"" look that becomes nauseating after a while.

Still, the music is lovely, the movie is very well made, the acting is quite good, and there are some wonderfully silent and subtle scenes that speak volumes with their poignancy (a rarity in film lately). So grab the popcorn, turn out the lights, and enjoy -- but don't look for too many answers, because you'll be left with even more questions.

Oh, one more thing... do you want to avoid Connie's pitfalls and her resulting downfalls (literal and not?) Then follow one simple rule:

  Never shop for your kid's party favors in stiletto heels.

3644989,4,B001HVZOA2,"There is nothing more deadly that you can do in your marriage then have an affair. Kate Burton's (Tracy) haunting lines to her girlfriends that it is/was the one thing in her life that she wishes she had never done, is delivered in chilling sentences and with a prescience only born of painful experience.

Diane Lane, lovely as always, reaches the rare ""best scene I ever saw"" in the movie reserved for Thomas More's post sentencing speech, Henry at Agincourt and Rocky's 1st round left hook. It is the scene where she returns from her first sexual dalliance with Oliver Martinez (Paul Martel) and in 60 seconds on the rocking train out of Grand Central without uttering a word she conveys self loathing, joy, rage at herself, sexual arousal, tears of shame, and humor. Not a word is spoken. It is what separates Lane (Connie) from the rest of the pack and makes her a true artist, so much more than a pretty face, an actor about which you would say ""I want to see THAT movie just because she's in it.""

Richard Gere (Edward) is an actor who knows his place. He is not the center of attention and seemingly is willing to be a supporting actor, and do everything within his consumate skill to make her role even better.

This movie is not terribly distant from Adrian Lynne's ""Fatal Attraction,"" with the exception of the marvelous photography and the juxtapostioning of scenes with (if there can be) powerful subtlety. There is one scene in the last third of the movie in a lonely site with the wind blowing the trash of human detritus around, and the camera tilts at a familiar angle to remind us of the trash blowing around Connie's head moments before she meets Paul Martel (Martinez) in the beginning of the movie. The positioning is brilliant.

The love affair is creepy, scary and erotic; Edward's suspicion, disbelief, confusion and rage well played; Connie's addiction to the relationship perfect; photography superb. Here's what I felt were the parts that I as the viewer did not find credible.

You have to believe in your characters. It's not that they won't do something unpredictable. It's when they do something unpredictable, in the larger context of the film it makes sense. Connie is a happy ""I have everything"" housewife. Her husband worships her, loves her physically as well as emotionally, dotes on her, comes home and asks her about her. The boy is a good son, seems to have all the accessories of young sonmanship with no problems. She is beautiful and full of joie vivre!. So in seedy Soho, carrying bags of party favors on a windy morning, sober, she agrees to walk into an apartment owned by a ruffian, slimy, sexy looking man, all with his caveat ""I am not a serial killer.""

Connie. Are you insane? Forget about the affair. IT'S NEW YORK CITY! Mark Chapman. David Berkowitz. Are you nuts?

OK. I found that to be ridiculous. Ditto, the affair. Most of us are aware . . . especially those that have worked hard to be where they end up, in Riverdale, beautiful cars, beautiful partners, that we don't do certain things. Drugs. Driving intoxicated. Bungee jumping in Tanzania. So why is she having an affair? At least Dan (Michael Douglas in Fatal Atraction) was a little bit over the top with Alex (Glenn Close), and in fact seemed kind of slimy himself. But Connie is so nice that other women like her! She shows no sign of any problem on the homefront. Sure people have affairs for a variety of reasons but that's just it. There are reasons. There are none here. It was/is incredible.

Diane Lane is great; Gere is extremely good; photography is brilliant; great, provocative, ambiguous ending. Really should be 4 1/2 stars. Larry Scantlebury",1096934400,,3671,4.6894409937888195

3644991,3,B001HVZOA2,"As an unseasoned movie reviewer i found this movie full of dead ends and questions which could have been addressed but were not. Connie was adored by her husband and they certainly did not appear to have any significant problem with the relationship. The movie plot was the same. bored? spouse helped by a young man and pursues him to say `thanks for your help` and then we are supposed to believe he seduced her against her will. What nonsense. The very fact that she went after him and returned twice to his apartment would have been evidence for any gigolo to know she wanted to say thanks in her own special way. Then we have these obvious lies to her husband, the phone calls and sexual rejections which would not have gone on for the time it did.
It would have lifted the movie and taken taken us away from the sex side of things if Connie would have explained why she was having the affair and also for at least one of the characters to explain why they got back together. There was no remorse on the part of Lanes character and i would have liked to see her explain herself to Edward. Also why did she remain in the same house when she found what he had done.
It would have been nice to have made her lover more real, after all he only did what several million other blokes would have done given the obvious advances made by Connie.
LAne and Gere were good in the film but there was no oscar material there. My favourite scene was when Edward asked her what sort of a day she had had on the evening of her first sexual encounter with her lover. `Oh, same old thing.` was her reply.
I don`t think sex scenes of this nature were necessary but seem to be the norm today. A better made movie would not have needed them. It was unusual to see Gere get cuckolded and while the alternative ending made more sense then the stupid one shown, there were far too many loose ends for the movie to be the winner it was made out. Why did Connie continue to lie when the police came? Why did Edward continue to tolerate it.
The initial rape then sex scene at the end did nothing for the case against rape. If Lane is so pro women as she says elsewhwere she should not have done it.
Realistically the marriage would have collapsed in a heap there being no remorse or apology from the unfaithful partner or any remorse from Gere`s character for the murder.
Actually the alternative ending made me laugh when Edward said that they would be together again. If Connie could not remain true when she shared his bed she has no chance if he goes to jail for x number of years. In fact the result of the affair should have been shown up for what affairs do `they always end terribly` as one character (?Tracy) implied.

3644993,4,B001HVZOA2,"""Having an affair is nothing like taking a pottery class.  No, it would start out like that, and then something would happen; someone finds out or someone falls in love and it ends disastrously.  They always end disastrously.""

With these words, Tracy (Kate Burton) gesticulates the story of a suburban wife, Connie Sumner (Diane Lane), who has edged out of the humdrum existence of life and into the rarified strata of an affair.

Connie Sumner projects the aura of a woman dealing with a case of boredom and the sameness of life that has none of the gloss or glamour that perhaps enveloped her before her marriage to Edward (Richard Gere) eleven years before.  She has become a trooper; the mother of a precocious little boy; a Junior League bastion of acceptability in a rich suburb of New York City that has all the earmarks of upper middle class living.  The 19th century home on the lake, the extensive and manicured grounds, every blade of grass and hair in place, a handsome husband -- all hard won trophies that scream ""I have reached the pinnacle of success!""  And yet, when opportunity presents itself, Connie sets a course on a downward spiral that will end in the disastrous results that an affair must always betray.

On an extremely mundane and windy day, she sets her sights on New York City to attend to some charity auction business.  In the process of trying to get down a street in Soho, she is literally swept into a man carrying an armload of books.  Both are knocked to the ground.  It is from this most innocent of beginnings that the torrid affair takes on a life of its own.  It is born and matures into a relationship that will culminate in less than desirable straits before its eventual termination.  Connie accepts the kindness of French book dealer, Paul Martel (Olivier Martinez), to bandage her knees which have suffered bloody unkindnesses, in his apartment.

Connie is a woman in her late 30's or perhaps early 40's and Paul is 27 going on ""28 in July.""  The classic older woman, younger man syndrome.  She has fallen into dispute with her emotions and the danger that an affair brings with it.  That Martel betrays a scruffy, amourous, devil may care attitude about him, grasps her all the more to his person.  With her lover, she is young again and life seems somehow more exciting to the touch. She fails to realize what she is possibly throwing away by her actions as the pleasure factor has negated all reason.

Diane Lane as Connie is superb.  Her performance is worth a thousand accolades.  She has etched a performance that is as intelligent as it it is forthright and unassuming.  The scene of her initial foray with Martel is breathtaking, as she is for all intents and purposes entering into forbidden territory with a quivering of her body, mind and soul.  A date with destiny and a pact with the devil have thus been sealed.  Ms. Lane's emotions run the gamut from boredom, elation, sexiness, disdain, anger and the firmest of convictions that she has become a rat in a maze of her own architecture.

Richard Gere as Edward paints a portrait of a man whose life has achieved the heights reserved for those go-getters who have sought the challenge and won.  Gere plays dad, husband, lover and eventually, volcano on the edge of the boiling point that spills forth with fatal results.  His Edward conveys a wariness and uncertainty when he begins to suspect that there is ""something wrong"" with the new actions of his wife, and as the truth unfolds, as it must, a crescendo of complexity makes its appearance.

Oliver Martinez as Paul Martel is that secret sin that most women prize -- a confection of French delight and smarmy actions that sizzle.  He is the honey which draws Connie into his arms, but morphs into a spider enticing her further into his web. The scene when Edward finally confronts him is priceless. It is put together like a puzzle, with each piece falling neatly into place until the crashing denouement rears its ugly head and we are left with a second story to absorb.

The last third of the film stretches credibility slightly, although it is perfectly understandable to think that what happened did. While there are moments that shine through the tendency to slip into soap opera, a great deal of the time is spent trying to overcome the ""who did, I did"" of relationships that went asunder and why. The final moments of the film present the viewer with a game of ""what happened?"", rather like the Saki short story, ""The Lady or The Tiger."" Which path was chosen? What was the eventual outcome of it all?

The music by Jan A. P. Kaczmarek is mesmerizing and rather like experiencing a lazy, summer day, touched with a tinge of sin and the long play of the wind as we drift to sleep to its steady beat.

Director Adrian Lyne was inspired by the 1969 French film, ""La Femme infidele,"" directed and written by Claude Chabrol, as a basis for this current production. Lyne has crafted an adult drama that portrays the paths that people take when feeling out of sorts and what can and does happen because of them. His has drawn a performance from Diane Lane that is entirely credible and worthy of the Oscar nomination she has snared. The Academy would be well served to reward it, for she displays emotions and actions that induce a labour of consummate proportions. Here's hoping that rather than going with the ""safe bets"" that it tends to hug to its bosom, be they bigger names or studio efforts, it goes with a true acting extravaganza.

Lyne's entire cast has melded together to bring adultery in all its compromising positions to the audience, and in the process has perhaps allowed us all to think twice before we leap into what we might have thought was nothing more than like ""taking a pottery class.""",1092441600,,5774,4.646017699115045
3644994,4,B001HVZOA2,"OK I saw this movie again last night and while it isn't the best in movies it really isn't all that bad. The main cast of characters comprise of Richard Gere (Edward Sumner), Diane Lane (Constance 'Connie' Sumner) and Olivier Martinez (Paul Martel). This is your basic story about an out of it husband who works all of the time, a bored housewife and a good looking french guy to rescue her. Well maybe not the basic story. I enjoyed watching this movie. I actually saw it on HBO first and liked it enough to buy it so I have watched it about 5 or 6 times since then. Connie meets up with Olivier in SOHO where she is buying toys for her son's birthday. Its stormy, the wind ends up blowing her down and she skins her knee. This is where the french man comes in. Olivier has a sort of hot, geeky kind of look. He isn't hunky, but he draws you in with his mannerisms. He is the medium heighth, dark and handsome type. Connie is immediately attracted to Olivier, as was I, and so the story begins. If you love hot, steamy sex scenes that are made for the big screen this is the movie for you. Connie and Olivier have sex almost everywhere. This is the problem though, Connie is starting to act differently and her husband begins to notice. He hires a P.I. to follow her. Bingo she is cheating on him. Edward confronts Olivier only seconds after Olivier and Connie had sex outside of his apartment in the hallway. Anyway Edward ends up killing Olivier with one of those snowballs that Connie had given to Olivier that was actually one that Edward had given to Connie. Well this is where I lost interest in the movie. Olivier, the hot french man is out of the picture. The remainder of the film is about trying to figure out who killed Olivier. The first 3/4 of this movie are great. The end portion boring. I suggest renting this movie and finding out for yourself before purchasing it.

3644995,2,B001HVZOA2,"Unfaithful is not a very good movie.  The movie is weighted down from the start with its numerous cliches, the biggest one being the French lover Paul Martel (Oliver Martinez) to suburban wife Constance Summer (Diane Lane).  At one point, before Constance gives in to her passion, Martel tells her - to help her put aside her guilt - ""There's only what you do, and what you don't do.""  Indeed.  Considering Martel's fate, I had to appreciate the unintentional irony of his code.  Why is it unintentional?  Well, you should see the weapon of choice - it would make Spielburg blush with shame. There's no way a movie operating at such a superficial level could work in intelligent irony.  Overall, I'm tempted to give this one star, but Gere has a good confrontation moment with Martel that looked to me like good acting.  And Lane - between couplings - had a good acting moment on the train.  Emotions - joy, amazement, guilt - crossed her face in a believable fashion that proved she could act with her clothes on.  Nevertheless, such moments aside, Unfaithful is Hollywood's A-Movie attempt at soft porn.  If you want a story about adults and adultery, you'd be better off picking Anna Karenina or Madame Bovary, and leave Hollywood to do the comic books.",1090886400,,1256,4.715596330275229

3644998,5,B001HVZOA2,"Months before the award ceremonies that honoured 2002 began, there seemed to be an unspoken decision among the powers that be that the actress of the year would be Nicole Kidman for delivering what was essentially a supporting role in Stephen Daldry's brilliant film THE HOURS. A shame really. While Meryl Streep delivered what was arguably her finest work to date in the same film, the Actress of the year was undoubtedly Diane Lane for her honest, naked work in this perfectly realised melodrama. Adrian Lyne's best work always seems to spring forth when he examines women & their emotions. Sharing similarities with FATAL ATTRACTION in it's study of urban angst, the power of the film springs from a screenplay that doesn't justify Connie's(Diane Lane)behaviour. When we first meet her, it appears she has everything. A stable homelife, a handsome, loving husband & son. Literally crashing into a handsome bookdealer during a violent windstorm(aided by a very clever credit sequence..watch closely), Connie slowly but surely begins a hot, torrid affair. Unable to resist the temptation, watch her closely as she wrestles with herself(& with him). Her train trip home following her first sexual encounter is a wonder to behold. In flashback we are shown the encounter while Connie alternately laughs, cries, squirms & exalts as she rejoices in her own(almost new)sexuality. To watch her behaviour as she(& we)realizes how much her handsome new lover has set her free, the feeling is infectious. Ably supported by Richard Gere( a big year for this guy) & Olivier Martinez, Lyne delivers a film filled with honesty & warmth. More than just a fantastic central performance, for my money, this is one of the best films of 2002.",1089590400,,1725,5.077464788732394

3645003,5,B001HVZOA2,"First at all, I'm powerful and greatfully surprised by this movie. It's a first rate, by many reasons.
The clever script and the golden direction of Lyne. In fact, when you see this film you know since the first fifteen minutes that you are in an unusual film. The narrative style, the accurate telling reminds us to Louis Malle (Damage), Joseph Losey (The messenger) amd Jacques Torneur (Detour).
The superb performance of Diana Lane makes me think that this extraordinary talented and not less beuatiful actress (one of the top ten actually) has been neglected for many roles. She has an absolute charisma. She seduces the camera, and has multiple skills, for the drama and the light comedy (Under the sun of Toscane).
I still remeber in Cotton Club and it's well known that Coppola has had the Midas touch for young actors. This is a high point for Lane. And remember she still was a teenager.
Richard Gere is OK, but Olivier Martinez is outstanding. Happily he gets the perfect balance for Lane. His role is perversely made with a touch of refined style. Both of them steal the show.
The film combines the best of the film noir with a deep load of internal anguish in this unhappy couple, for all we know.
The shameless weighs all a world in the troubled soul of Gere after the fact, and so Lane is one step below the madness.
The final ending is anthological.
I've always shared the idea that in film like this, the ending must be opened.
And Adrian Lyne crossed at last! the category of a worth director to become in a talented director of first rate.
Hitchock told once that there were two kinds of directors; those who saw upon their heads and those who saw just the floor. It's a pedestrian but clear view that allows us classify them. And Lyne crossed the edge and went to the rank of creative directors.
A vow for Lyne and we expect much more from you. Don't let us down. Don't look at behind. Remember Orson Welles when he was interwiewed in Cannes after his Othello in 1953.
Welles said : Othello is a well done film. But the project that I've in mind. That's just a masterpiece. It's the hunter's criterion.
Buy this film and soon you'll forget Fatal Atraction.
I swear you.",1083801600,,2188,4.527777777777778
3645004,4,B001HVZOA2,"I usually avoid mainstream Hollywood domestic dramas: either they are about what the director thinks is wrong with the American family or what she thinks is an ideal one; the results are not infrequently cliched. 'Unfaithful' happily departs from the norm.

Diana Lane as the 'unfaithful' wife turns in a sterling performance. One has only to watch the expressions on her face as she recollects her first extra-marital sexual encounter with Paul on a train to see how conflicted her character is. She is caught up in a relationship which at one level is a bitter-sweet college romance that never was, at another an escape from staid suburban boredom, and still at another a vent for subterranean desires. Her focus and composure during the sex scenes, particularly the first, is laudable. The sex scenes in the film, except for one, have neither the saccharine serenity nor the wham-bam dullness that one would expect; they are touching, especially the final one, a genuine sense of adventure comes through them, and they reveal much of Connie's character. Her sharing her first name with Lady Chatterley, however, doesn't mean that her extra-marital relationship has any element of gung-ho abandon/idealization. But whether it's simply a pleasant, and dangerous, indulgence or whether it has a deeper significance is ambigiuous. For instance, there's that torrid bout Connie has with Paul after finding out his own 'unfaithfulness'; there are clearly darker impulses propelling Connie and its not simply a case of making a 'dirty' mistake. Fortunately, the narrative does not take on unplesant moralising tones of 'O look how she falls', but there's a decency with which her impulses are traced. That is not to say that the narrative does not have its own position on what she does. Throughout the film there is the 'cleanliness' symbolism employed; observe how when Connie is in Paul's bathroom during her first visit she doesn't want to touch the water-closet; later on she is shown having sex over a water-closet. While Connie's been 'dirtied', there are extenuating circumstances. Note the wind in the opening scene that whirls Connie round and round; she isn't totally in control of herself. Other than the water-closet and wind symbolism there is the irony in the boy's statement at the end when he asks Connie: 'Why aren't you in bed, mom?' By that time things have become muddled enough for her to quip, 'Who's bed, honey?' What is clear, however, is that Connie suffers not because she commits a trangression, but for wanting what she doesn't want; she allows herself to get entangled in a situation she doesn't want to be in.

It's never made clear in the film how much of a reader Martinez's character is; considering, however, his Jack-Dawsonly bohemian persona combined with Wickhamly rakish propensities, I'd say not much. Paul is a pastiche of stereotypes, not a character. This takes away from the effectiveness of the Connie-Paul outing. Think of a number between 500 and 1000, and you may be close to the number of times directors have had two lovers falling over one another when they 'accidentally' meet for the first time. And of course we had to have a school concert.

'Unfaithful' is clearly not immune to the befuddling cliche or two. But, the director knows where to put them. With much tension and inexorable logic the narrative chalks out the consequences of Connie's actions; in its own way it has the mercilessness of a Greek drama. In the final analysis, 'Unfaithful' remains faithful to itself.",1082851200,,3527,5.015358361774744
3645005,2,B001HVZOA2,"Several reviewers call this a ""great"" movie. I wonder if we were watching the same film.
UNFAITHFUL is the story of a housewife (Diane Lane) whose overactive libido makes her vulnerable to the seductive charms of a French bookseller (Olivier Martinez) whom she meets accidentally. The affair goes on for some time despite guilt pangs suffered by the housewife and in the face of growing suspicions by the husband (Richard Gere).
The production values are good in UNFAITHFUL with many scenes set in New York City and the acting is good. The love scenes between the wife and her French lover are quite steamy.
That's about all that's good in this movie.
The plot suffers from too little conflict as there is no real villain in the piece. Reviews refer to UNFAITHFUL as a ""thriller"" but the application of that term to this movie is probably the result of not knowing how to categorize the movie and needing to classify it somehow. Without giving away any plot essentials, there is very little danger or threat of danger to the characters in UNFAITHFUL which might be expected were it a thriller.
The plot leaves us guessing why the wife takes a lover as Richard Gere seems to the ideal husband except that maybe she is bored in the bedroom. I found UNFAITHFUL empty and without much content. The characters seemed to walk through the film with little motivation or feelings.
The last half hour of the film was totally boring and had me dozing off. The soundtrack is forced and over dramatic at times and got on my nerves.
This is a pedestrian project with little reason to identify or root for any of the characters. Pass.",1081728000,,1620,4.6678321678321675

3645009,2,B001HVZOA2,"It says something when, in a movie about a woman's torrid extramarital affair and the problems that result, the most interesting character is a seven-year-old kid.  What it says is that the movie in question - Unfaithful - is a sub-par film.
In Unfaithful, Diane Lane plays a ""happily"" married woman who with little reason starts an affair with a bookseller.  Despite her occasional crying spells, she doesn't really seem all that concerned about who the affair is hurting until it is too late.  Richard Gere is her husband who catches on reasonably quickly and eventually takes drastic action to deal with the situation.
The biggest problem with this movie is that it is boring.  Even the sex scenes - and there are several of these - are rather dull.  Add to this an unlikable lead character who has complete disregard for her family and it is hard to enjoy this movie.

The flashbacks which move back and forth across the screen force Lane to review every intimate fresh detail of her lover's initial  seduction. As she looks at the first moment, Lane is composed.

3645014,5,B001HVZOA2,"This is a film that at first seems familiar.  It's about a suburban housewife's love affair and the unexpected aftermath.  Diane Lane shines in the role of the woman, happily married to Richard Gere and the mother of a 9-year old son.  They live in an upscale Westchester community and their marriage seems perfect.  Then one day, while in New York City, she accidentally meets Oliver Martinez, a bookseller with huge apartment in the Soho-Tribecca area.  One thing leads to another and soon they are engaged in a hot affair.  And when I say ""hot"", I really mean it.  The erotic scenes are some of the steamiest I've even seen and I could feel their passion right down to my own toes.
There are complications, of course.  Especially when the husband finds out.  Richard Gere is a fine actor and the scene in which he comes face to face with his wife's lover calls for superb acting ability.  There's tension and upset seething as they make polite conversation and what follows seems inevitable in the context of the story.  How it all plays out is different from what I expected.
I was completely drawn into the story and felt a deep understanding for all the characters and their motivations.

3645015,5,B001HVZOA2,"This movie is not just about a woman cheating on her husband and finding intense sexual pleasure with the man that she is having an affair with, it goes beyond that I think. Connie (Diane Lane) and Edward (Richard Gere) seem to be from the very beginning of the movie a kind of mismatch couple. It looks like everything is not peaches and cream in their marriage and possibly the only reason that they are still together is because of the son that they share. Even before Connie meets and gets sexually involve with Olivier Martinez, you can sense that something is not right in her life she seems kind of sad and nostalgic especially when her husband is around. I can't say that I really blame Connie for looking for something outside of her marriage when it is obvious that she does not have it at home with her husband. Diane Lane is not only sexy and beautiful but gives a powerhouse performance that resulted in her nabbing an Oscar nomination as Best Actress for her outstanding work in this film. A highly underrated actress in my opinion she more than prove to Hollywood that she is a brilliant talent to be reckoned with. Richard Gere has his good moments in this film but overall his character is too vulnerable at times and although you feel sorry for him that his wife cheated on him it is Diane that I found myself rooting for through out the whole movie. I don't want too give too much away for those you who still may not have seen it. This is a great movie with an excellent cast and wonderful performances by everyone but as I said it is the sexy and divine Diane Lane that steals every scene from her co-star husband and from everyone else for that matter. I recommend this movie all the way and maybe you can draw your own conclusion if you think that Connie did right or wrong in having an affair outside of the marriage.

3645018,2,B001HVZOA2,"As a general rule of thumb I rarely ever review films but after being subjected to Adrian Lyne's incredibly pompous and sordid offering "" Unfaithful "" I felt a critique was not only needed but somehow necessary. If nothing else to exercise some demons that I still feel when reminded of this montrosity.
Where to begin!? Theres so much that is wrong with this movie that is difficult to know where to start. Lets begin with pretentions. If this movie is guilty of anything its simply that by disguising this tacky, sordid mess as a poor mans art-house film Mr. Lyne is equally guilty of attempting to dress up this blunder as a movie that tries far too hard to "" say something "" about the consequences of maritial infidelity. There is simply little to be found here that might even be considered remotely original or noteworthy. Diane Lane, portraying a housewife/fundraiser, who obviously has far too much time on her hands, literally runs into Oliver Martinez a young Frenchman ( major cliche! ) in Manhattan and begins a torrid affair with the young man. Its bad enough in this directors feeble attempts to portray our star as "" good person "" by casting her as someone who does charitable work i.e. thereby she, deep down, must be a really good person, No!? A move that seems truly contrived and desperate. Plus, since absurdities seem to abound, they make our young Romeo a book enthusiast...again a desperate attempt to portray this character as someone who isn't just a pretty face! Playing on the audiences sympathies there is actually a scene in which our misguided heroine sits in an empty subway car home and breaks-down after here first tryst with our young stud. In a feeble attempt to cast Ms. Lane as one who understands the seriousness of her mistake but one who nevertheless continues to fall victim to this same error in judgement time after time. And yes, while Ms. Lane's performance is noteworthy I seemed to be unable to gather little sympathy for her. No matter how hard the director may have tried to paint her  with a rather large dose of understanding! Its difficult to gather any empathy for a grown woman who seems to run strictly on emotion and has little intellectual skills at her disposal. Thereby awarding Diana all the emotional developement of a sixteen year high-school student! And to make this family truly complimant each other we have Richard Gere playing the clueless husband. An obvious good provider, all-around wonderful father and all that he seems truly miscast as an equally thick father figure.
To take this brilliant mistake even further  Mr. Lyne awards his viewer with a couple of steamy sex-scenes in which our heroine and her young lover are shown in full nudity all the while making Whoppee while the audience is supposedly to buy into how truly passionate they really are and how Ms. Lane, apparently in need of a hobby, just needs to have her sexual desires fulfilled. And, in a relentless attempt to make Ms. Lane's character even more sympathetic, our young Frenchman turns out to be a cad! It seems as though our heroine cannot catch a break! Not that that prevents her from just one more sordid tryst with that two-timing Frenchman. Granted most Americans are easily 'titillated' but I suspect these episodes were thrown in, sadly, in an attempt to gather the film some badly needed notoriety. Although with all the talk of these ""hot and heavy' scenes it seems to have worked! It's all so obvious in its panderings and low-brow unoriginality!
But it does get better. Obviously Mr. Lyne felt that a film about infidelity wasn't enough so at the half-way mark we have this movie doing a complete about-face and becoming a murder mystery! At this point I've thrown up my hands and wondered if I'd changed the channel unknowingly and am now watching a different movie! And yes, even then the movie simply falls apart even more so leaving the viewer with an ending that was far too ambiguous and self-serving for anyone to muster up any enthusiasm for. Overall an uncomprehensible mess that that never seemed to find its own direction and one in which relied far too heavily upon pathetic and contrived episodes that pandered to an audiences most basest instincts.

Connie (Lane) and Edward (Gere) are successful suburbanites with a seemingly happy marriage, until Connie meets an attractive younger man and begins an affair.

Lane is memorable as the guilt-ridden wife who is obsessed with her lover.  She is lovely, mature, and honest in her portrayal and deserved her nomination for Best Actress.  Gere is almost a supporting actor here, but he is wonderful playing an average guy.  Olivier Martinez plays Lane's paramour.  His character was fairly one-dimensional and could have been developed further, but he was very good in the role.

The first time I saw the movie, I thought it was relatively dull because of its relentlessly low-key presentation and leisurely pace.  On the second viewing, however, I found it a real winner.  There are long periods without dialogue, where the camera focuses on facial nuances.  The silence gives one a chance to appreciate the fine acting.

She completely transcends the movie, which is hemmed in by Adrian Lyne's misogynistic moralizing and a melodramatic and unbelievable second half.  It's hard to believe that it's a coincidence that (SPOILER of sorts) in Fatal Attraction, the family unit is left intact despite the husband's infidelity; however, if the woman strays, apparently nothing can follow but destruction and sorrow.  Lane's performance hints at the movie this could have been - a mature and fascinating exploration of the impact of infidelity on a loving marriage.

Her husband, played by Richard Gere, learns of the affair and when he goes to confront the guy, he ends up killing him. Now what to do?
The movie is very realistic - except that there aren't too many couples as beautiful as these two! But, unfortunately it's the same old story of betrayal and jealousy.

Largely overlooked in Australia with limited cinema release, I took a chance and hired the DVD in December 2002.  At that time, Diane Lane had not been nominated for an Oscar, but I was so impressed with her performance that I wondered at the time if she would get nominated.  Richard Gere is surprisingly good too as the husband.  This is more a supporting role for Richard with Diane taking the lead.  I don't wish to give too much away, but anyone who is thinking of seeing this, but is sceptical - trust me, you will enjoy it.  Just give it a chance to unfold.  Don't let the first 30 or so minutes fool you into thinking it's going to be an easy ride.

3645029,3,B001HVZOA2,"Diane Lane gives a superb Oscar nominated performance in this otherwise lame attempt at reworking director Adrian Lyne's far superior ""Fatal Attraction."" Lane cooly hijacks the movie as a comfortable but bored suburban housewife who lapses into an affair with a sexy French book dealer (Olivier Martinez).As Connie Sumner, Ms. Lane has very little dialogue to explain why she grasps at the promise of a dangerous fling, or how she withstands simultaneous torrents of guilt, fear, lust and joy, or what she thinks when she looks at her husband (Mr. Gere) and son (Erik Per Sullivan). There may be no words to explain those feelings, but I knew how she felt anyway, simply by watching her. This is what truly fine acting is about--this ability to communicate without words, to distill thought and feeling into the most authentic body language. Mr. Gere also rises to the occasion with an understated portrait of a confident man who stumbles  tragically, violently  when his assurance is shattered. Their chemistry is what ultimately makes the film work. Adrian Lyne does well with the directing duties despite the predictable, obvious, and formulaic plot. The most daring thing about the movie is not its steamy love play, but its ambiguous ending, which gives the otherwise lackluster film some much needed bite. Some viewers hate uncertain endings, but Unfaithful deserves respect for the questions it leaves unanswered. It is the performances, director, and depending on who you ask, the ending, that makes the film. Some will love this, some will hate it. All in all, this is an uneven drama, mediocre at best, but worth it for Lane's performance alone!!!",1060819200,,1657,5.065934065934066

It starts as a happy theme, but once the sexy Olivier Martinez walks into Diane Lane's life, everything changes. The sex appeal steams, then the mystery stomps on it flowing to an unexpected conclusion. The producers, the director, and the writers wonderfully make ""Unfaithful"" more entertaining.
Diane Lane deserved her overdue Oscar nomination for her role as an unhappy wife, the best role of her career. Richard Gere wonderfully plays her character's suspicious husband whose personality changes as his anger grows. Olivier Martinez needs to star in more movies like this in the future.
Those looking to steam up a night should watch ""Unfaithful"". It'll leave the audience breathless and shocked.",1060560000,,779,5.39344262295082
3645031,5,B001HVZOA2,"This movie avoids the easy out that most films of its kind take--the cliche tale of the psycho lover or cold, controlling spouse. Instead, this movie reaches a careful balance where all three characters are sympathetic, even when they are doing ghastly things.

It would have been easy to make the husband a jerk.  Instead, he is a basically decent man who has some problems with communication, greed, and managing his emotions.

It would have been easy to make the wife shallow and selfish so that we loathe her for doing this to her family.  Instead, she is a good mother, generous person, and loving wife who makes one mistake after the other as she gets caught up in an immoral indulgence.

Finally, it would be easiest of all to make the lover a psycho.  Instead, we get Paul--a compassionate and tender caretaker who loves books.  He's also a reckless, arrogant, womanizer, but the movie is careful to temper that with his good qualities.

People who think this film is about a bored housewife and a sexually violent boyfriend didn't bring enough experience or attention to the film, I fear.

Connie is boxed in, not bored.  She spends every day taking care of her son and her husband, the house, and other people in her charity work.  She is the consummate care-taker, a crone before her time, locked into that role by her choices.  Her husband is a decent person who loves her, but he is portrayed from the start as a big child.  She has to tell the family what to wear, what to eat, where to be, and what to say.  She controls and takes care of everything.

When she meets Paul, she finds someone who takes care of her for a change, even though he is much younger.  From the start, he tends to her wounds.  He indulges her girlishness, and teaches her new things.  And yes, he exerts physical but _consensual_ control over her in the bedroom.

This movie doesn't have any rape scenes in it.  People who think otherwise must have missed oh-so-subtle indications of consent such as her _literally asking him to do what he's doing_.

The sex scenes are intensely passionate.  Raw base recklessness is portrayed on the screen.  In particular, Diane Lane manages to portray a girlish, trembling eroticism that makes the viewer hold in breath to behold. She perfectly captures a mixture of laughter, trembling and tears--the sound of anguished surrender.

Moreover, the affair itself is tenderness.  Again, it would have been very easy to make the relationship about a mere physical affair, but the script goes to great lengths to make it an emotional affair as well.  The most wounding thing to Connie's husband is not the sex, but the intimacy his wife shared with another man behind his back.

The confrontation between the husband and the lover is the best scene I've ever seen from Richard Gere, and a scene likely to haunt long after you've put this film away.

The mood evoked is meloncholy--sadness over the follies of human beings, over what good people can do when they lack courage, and how sexual needs are sometimes man's downfall.  Overall, this is a sophistocated tale of choices, consequences, and some deep truths about lies, marriage, fidelity, and intimacy.",1059868800,,3179,4.739526411657559

Well, the hype was true. The film is excellent and Diane is seductive, sexy and downright awesome as the films main focus. She proves here what many believed before... she is a beautiful and talented star capable of carrying a movie.

Many filmmakers have tried desperatley to duplicate the succsess of the films Basic Instinct and Fatal Attraction.  Unconcsciouly or consciously, this film somehow takes off on that direction but the twist here is that it's the male who plays the part of the seducer, as opposed to the said films which play the female as the femme fatale.  Actually, the oldest story ever told to portray males as the seducers was relayed in the bedtime story Red Riding Hood.  Unfaithful may have taken on that theme.
Olivier Martinez manages to deliver a decent portrayal of the book collector who presumably lives alone in New York City.  Diane Lane's character, the bored (presumably) New Jersey housewife, encounters his character and begins an unexpected affair.
What interested me and what kept me watching this film is how Diane Lane's character tried to get out of the affair, and the last 30 minutes of the film will have you see Richard Gere's character blowing up Martinez's character into smithereens.  Those were the predictable moments, but you just want to see more and find out what actually IS going to happen to the married couple.
The DVD itself has lots of treats.  If it weren't for the special features, I highly doubt that I would've purchased this DVD.  I loved the interviews with the cast.  See Diane Lane's and see how nervous she is when she talks about playing the part of a cheating wife.
The alternate endings are quite interesting, as is with all other DVDs with the same feature, but personally I liked the ending in the film itself.
I managed to make a review without giving out too much information,  but if you're a die hard Richard Gere fan, then add this to your collection.",1056067200,,1974,4.6275071633237825
3645036,3,B001HVZOA2,"Unfaithful (Adrian Lyne, 2002)
Adrian Lyne (Jacob's Ladder) returns to the world he most likes to occupy, adding yet another tale of sexual immorality to the same quiver already occupied by Nine and a Half Weeks, Fatal Attraction, Indecent Proposal, and Lolita. As with all the other films in that collection, Unfaithful ultimately conceals a deep conservatism under the libertine exterior, which is much of the ""something's wrong, but I can't put my finger on it"" feeling that often mars Lyne's work.
The story is nothing out of the ordinary; the Sumners, Edward (Richard Gere) and Connie (Diane Lane) have a usual suburban marriage, stable and boring. Connie, by chance, meets the dashing Paul Martel (Olivier Martinez, recently seen in Before Night Falls), who finds her attractive, pursues her, and ultimately lures her into an extramarital affair, and everything goes downhill from there.
It's not that what's been done before can't make for a good movie (Lyne's done it himself in Jacob's Ladder), and it's not that there aren't excellent stretches in this film. But upon reflection it does become a rather pedestrian piece of work. The first half of the film is paced far too slowly for this type of thriller, and a very, very badly cut last scene leaves the outcome of the film far too ambiguous (thankfully, the full scene is included in the deleted scenes section of the DVD). In between the film works quite well; the climax comes surprisingly early on, and unlike many recent films where that's the case, Unfaithful manages to keep the suspense going afterwards, as the lives of the characters spiral out of control in the aftermath of said climax. I just wish the first sixty and last five minutes had been handled better. ** ",1056067200,,1739,4.914965986394558

I got this movie because Diane Lane was nominated for an Oscar for it.  But I did not see anything she did which any porn actress cannot do (fake exstacy during love-making).  I thought Richard Gere was good, but this plot is completely idiotic.  First, it gives potential rapists more reason to think it's a good idea to force yourself on a woman.  Then it ends with the theory that infidelity and murder just make your relationship stronger.  The idea that any relationship could survive what occurs in this film is completely implausable.

The beginning of the film is her having sex for no reason other than to have sex. They hardly bonded in front of our eyes. There was a magnetic attraction, but we didn't see it. This film could have substituted some of the sex, especially the hallway scene (what were they thinking?) for some more plot and story line progression. The film didn't seem to take any shape until Richard Gere killed what's his name. Might I add, he was quite ugly, irritatiing to listen to and just too audacious a character. All in all, it's not bad, but it could certainly have been better. If ever there was a film that had too much sex in it, this is it. It's just unnecessary. There was so much room for plot progression that the movie is so full of holes.

I think Lyne likes women a lot, too, just like the French do.)  It is very interesting, for its theme (infidelity in a happy marriage), story structure (the first half is the wife's story, and the second half the husband's--and this shift doesn't work for me), as a movie (crisp photography and editing, though I think the second half is flatter, maybe because Lyne isn't as interested in that part of the story, or maybe because for me the crystalline focus of the first half is dissipated), and most of all for a luminous performance by Diane Lane that must be seen--she IS what makes the first part of the film work as a story.  (Oh, and there's also a gorgeous young French guy.)  The director's commentary is engaging, and helped me appreciate the film more deeply.

3645042,5,B001HVZOA2,"This thriller has that sense of events leading to an inevitable climax and ending because every aspect of this thriller is part of a formula we are all familiar with. And yet every aspect is also slightly better than your everyday thriller too. Diane Lane(Constance) especially although the famous scene on the train which is so talked about was not the scene I would isolate as proof of Diane Lanes talent and appeal as a first-rate actress. The train scene is noted for the array of emotions displayed by Constance(who is anything but constant)after she has had her first taste of unfaithfulness but the scene feels like several different emotional moments cut up and edited so that you get the impression that all these emotions are just flowing one after the other from the actress. I think one constant take would have been the more powerful way to convey this emotionally charged yet ambivalent and conflicted moment in her life. The scene fells like it could be taken out of any of Adrian Lynes films (9 1/2 weeks for instance). Not to say the movie isn't satisfying because it is but the other thing that feels like cheating is that Frenchman. He seems like a cut-out from a romance novel. It turns out he's not as perfect as Constance thought but the film loses what could possibly be another interesting dimension to the story by simply filling that role with a sex object--if he was more a real person and less a fantasy object Constance's emotions would also be more complex. As it is her emotions just alternate between two poles: sexual elation and marital guilt. In other words the film is great as Hollywood thrillers go but if you are an adventurous filmgoer who really has no patience for cliches I would recommend going back to the original French film by Claude Chabrol, La Femme Infidele. That film is a more interesting tale of bourgoisie ennui and a much more complex piece of filmmaking. Plus the original has one of the best endings I've ever seen, not the same ending as Unfaithful. Unfaithful gets five stars on the Hollywood thriller chart, but La Femme Infidele gets five stars on the much more discerning foreign film chart.",1052697600,,2154,4.7161803713527854

The title of this film ""UNFAITHFUL"" says it all.  I will not reveal the story here because very few good movies are made these days.  This one is a doozy.  I had just finished watching AN OFFICIER AND A GENTLEMAN (1982) and decided to rent this dramatic film.  Olivier Martinez (They say, the actor who has it in his contract he will not do a full nude scene) is interesting as the other man.

3645044,3,B001HVZOA2,"Adrian Lyne, who brought us FATAL ATTRACTION, is at it again.  In this ""morality"" tale, Diane Lane plays a suburban mother / housewife / charity volunteer who has a hot affair with a french-accented book dealer.  When her husband, Richard Gere, becomes suspicious and later has his suspicions confirmed, a bad situation can only go to worse.
The movie is a soap-opera.  It's fun, no question, but it clearly aspires to make some sort of grand statement...what, exactly, I don't know.  Perhaps that a guilty secret can be forgiven if you have an even bigger, more horrendous secret yourself?  I don't know.
My biggest problem with the movie was Diane Lane's character.  She's terrific in the movie, and everyone always talked about the scene where she's riding the train home from her first tryst with her SoHo lover.  Her face goes from shame to lust to grief to excitement, all in the space of moments.  She does this well, and that's the main reason she got her Oscar nomination.  But we have NO idea why her character strays.  She has a gorgeous house, a kid she loves, a powerful husband who adores her and actually does things like come home in the evenings, help with dishes, ask about her day, etc.  She's not a neglected housewife.  I guess she must feel ""empty"" in some way...but taking up a dangerous affair with a seedy bookdealer who gives her a book of poetry by way of seduction is such a big leap for her character that I needed more.
Her sex scenes are typical Lyne...lots of slapping and biting and toilet-stall love making.  Daring for the actors...icky to look at.
The movie does finally get truly fascinating when the secret gets out.  What will Richard Gere do?  His confrontation scene with the lover is memorable and fascinating in a sick-to-your-stomach-imagining-this-is-happening-to-you kind of way.  I won't tell you anymore about what happens next because that could spoil the movie.
Olivier Martinez plays the lover.  He's a cypher of a character and not at all sympathetic.  The women in the movie all think he's gorgeous, but my wife (and I) thought he was slimy.  To each his own.  Richard Gere, whose characters are usually pompous and full of themselves, has a new kind of vulnerability in the movie and emerges as its most sympathetic character.  I'm not a huge fan of his, but he was good in this...I can't deny it.
I imagine this movie would entertain and fascinate any adults who are in a marriage (good or bad) or long-term relationship.  I can't imagine a teenager enjoying anything except the couple of semi-graphic scenes.  For mature audiences only.",1051574400,,2592,4.775280898876405

3645049,3,B001HVZOA2,"""Unfaithful"" is one of those movies that fulfills the prophecy of almost any sinful fantasy anyone has had of doing something forbidden, secretive, passionate...which, of course, makes it all the more exciting.  However, this movie shows the dark side of what those fantasies can bring if they are brought to frightening fruition.
Connie Sumner (excellently played by Diane Lane of ""The Outsiders"" fame) has the idyllic suburban life.  Her devoted husband is a handsome, successful businessman (the perfect role for Richard Gere), and they have an adorable young son.  She's happy, not even bored, with her marriage, and her life is filled with purpose.
Then the stranger comes along, played by Olivier Martinez.  You don't even think anything is going to happen between them, really.  She fights against her temptations for a while and then suddenly succumbs to them.  On their first encounter, you can see her pangs of guilt, very well demonstrated in their first love scene.  But soon, she surrenders to her primordial instincts.
Things go smoothly until you see the telltale signs she's having an affair in other aspects of her life.  Her organized family life becomes more disrupted, she pops in and surprises her husband at work bearing gifts....covering up her guilt.  He starts figuring things out and hires a PI to investigate, and he finds the man with whom his wife has been cheating.
He confronts the gigolo, and then the interesting stuff starts to happen...
This movie really reminded me of ""In the Bedroom"" in that it's about a relationship that is viewed as inappropriate and the unthinkable happens to tear it apart.  However, even though one would think the story would end at that point, the aftermath is what evolves as the interesting plot line.
You see what happens when two people try to maintain the facade of happiness while in a tarnished relationship.  There is no way to repair what has happened, and the devoted husband hates the adulterous wife, but you know that they still love each other.  This struggle makes the story so provocative and emotionally gut-wrenching.
This movie doesn't get 4 or 5 stars because I found the basic foundation for the affair ridiculous, and I couldn't help but just HATE Diane Lane's character through the whole thing.  It made me sick watching her fawn over this French gigolo like he was heroin.  It is not the type of movie I could watch over and over again, but it is still worth watching at least once.  It is definitely a conversation-starter, and it really makes you think:  even if you're happy with what you have, who's to say what you would do if something unpredicted came along?",1049241600,,2652,4.886160714285714
3645050,4,B001HVZOA2,"Wow, I knew Diane Lane could act, but this movie really sealed it for me.  She MADE this movie.  ""Unfaithful"" is a fairly well-done movie about a suburban housewife who finds herself having an affair with a younger man in the city.  Although the theme is really nothing new, Lane's superb acting truly conveys her character's mixed emotions - embarrassment, excitement, shame, giddiness.  The gamut of emotions that runs across her face on her subway ride home after her first tryst with her lover pretty much tells the whole story of how this woman feels about what she's doing.  Without Lane, this movie would have been mediocre.  With Lane, it was elevated to a whole new level.  It's a shame that she didn't win the Oscar for this performance; she deserved it.",1049155200,,764,4.742424242424242
3645051,4,B001HVZOA2,"The interesting thing about Adrian Lyne films is that he makes us face the raw and addicting side of sexuality that most people don't care to come to grips with. And he is very effective at it. Just take a look at ""Fatal Attraction"" and ""9 1/2 Weeks."" His latest, ""Unfaithful"" is no exception to his style. Less capable directors would concentrate on the erotica, making this a late night flick on cable. Lyne never fails to humanize his work by building tension and giving consequences to actions. Most characters in his films rarely escape accountability.
Diane Lane is very good and is blessedly utilized here. She gives a fresh take to the ""bored"" housewife and is unnervingly sympathetic. The Oscar nod was deserved and, agreeing with other critics, she does carry the film.
But the big surpise of the film is Richard Gere. He drops his trademark coyness and plays a sympathetic, dutiful family man and you really feel for him. I was amazed that he could give such depth to a character. Particularly in a key scene.
I was not expecting to like this one but am glad I saw it. A mistake that some guys may make is that this is a ""chick flick."" Not the case at all. If nothing more than seeing a side to Diane Lane that men have been waiting to see for a long time.",1049155200,,1267,4.44206008583691

However, it gets pretty clear that the writer and director have NO IDEA how to end this movie, and it seems like it ends SIX times.
FILM FACT:  The little boy who plays Gere & Lane's child is the most rivetingly obnoxious child actor ever (played by some kid from Malcolm in the Middle).",1049068800,,642,4.582608695652174

3645072,5,B001HVZOA2,"""Unfaithful"", directed by Adrian Lyne, tells the story of one's unfaithfulness to their marriage, and the consequences of the act when their spouse finds out about the affair.
PLOT SUMMARY: Connie Sumner (Diane Lane) is a married woman in her thirties or forties who seems to have everything--good looks, a wealthy husband, Edward (Richard Gere), a nice, big house, and a charming son, Charlie (Erik Per Sullivan). Connie, however, thinks her married life is failing in ... intercourse with her husband, who seems to have lots of time for his career but no time for her. And when Connie is nearly forced into the arms of a young, French man, Paul Martel (Olivier Martinez), on a windy day in New York City, her whole life changes. Now Connie and Paul are lovers in a very steamy relationship. A few months go by, and Edward becomes suspicious of Connie and her ""strange habbits"". To find out what is going on with his wife, he sends a friend off to spy on her when he goes away on a business trip. The spy catches Connie with Paul on camera, and Edward becomes bitter with jealousy, so jealous, that he murders Paul. Now Edward must confront Connie with her affair and together, they must learn to deal with it for the rest of their lives.
MY OVERALL THOUGHTS: I thought ""Unfaithful"" was a brilliant film. Diane Lane is superb, solid, ... as the unfaithful Connie. Richard Gere and Olivier Martinez are also superb in their roles as the two men in Connie's life. Richard Gere is especially brilliant in the scenes when he feels guilty over Paul's murder. The ... scenes were wonderfully portrayed and looked extremely real, maybe almost too real, because I kept thinking to myself, ""Oh, my God! Are they using condoms or birth pills?!"" The storyline is solid writing, with an interesting ending and strong dialouge. The music is haunting and the directing is terrific. The DVD includes a nice set of features such as, an audio commentary by the director, eleven deleted scenes, an alternate ending, actor's commentary, a guest show interview with the cast and director, behind-scenes featurette, and cast interviews. This film is available in both wide screen and full frame format DVDs.
I highly recommend ""Unfaithful"".

3645073,5,B001HVZOA2,"Diane Lane is superb as the chemistry-gone-wild woman/mother/wife in this well cast film.  When she is with or thinking of her lover Paul (Olivier Martinez) she glistens with erotic ambience; yet in scenes with husband Ed (Richard Gere), she is clearly a devoted, intelligent, well-organized wife and mother.  ""Well-organized"" that is, until she is completely engulfed by the dangers, excitement and helplessness of her passion.
""Unfaithful"" opens quietly on a family waking up for the day in their opulent suburban home.  Contentment, love and stability infuse the scene.  When the door opens for Ed to take his leave for the day, the family is confronted with a terrific windstorm.  Connie hurries to the train for shopping in the City. The camera catches the wild abandon of the wind in the city that picks up trash, Macy's parade-type balloons, streamers and tosses them all aloft.  Connie's packages billow around her head, her skirt catches the wind.  She loses control and literally gets blown over, knocking a man down, and scraping her knees.  The two of them try to retrieve the books, packages blowing about, but are defeated.  No, it isn't quite ""destiny;"" Connie realizes in a distant way that this young man spells danger, but she accompanies him to ostensibly get a band aid for her injured knees.
Martinez plays Paul as neither good nor bad.  His youth is emphasized along with youth's carelessness and sublime conceit.  Paul is a good-natured intellectual stud with a charming French accent. Connie is frankly getting off on flaunting more and more public sexual displays. She dresses with only an eye for sensuality and ease.  It is inevitable that Ed will discover her adultery.  In ways, Connie wants him to know, to rescue her from herself. I don't think Ed is murderous, just bewildered, but the gesture of a moment locks Ed and Connie into a changed world.
""Unfaithful"" has a good pace, beautiful photography and, it goes without saying, a great deal of eroticism.  Overt sexuality usually keeps me away from a film, but Diane Lane transcends misgivings and false sense of propriety.  Her Oscar nomination is well earned.  Richard Gere plays against type in a very restrained role. ""Unfaithful"" is well worth seeing.

3645076,2,B001HVZOA2,"Adrian Lyne is back at it, twisting the conventions of ""bless our happy home"" (aka. Fatal Attraction) and coming up with rabid obsessions, extra-marital trysts that, to say the very least, turn out badly, and cliched plot entanglements that really come up a cropper.  As a movie, we've seen all this before and told with more clarity and realism than this excursion.  Richard Gere is the blithering idiot husband, whose blissful ignorance is shattered when he discovers his wife is having an affair with a scummy-looking artist and bookseller.  Why is it that artists are always ""painted"" in this light (aka. A Perfect Murder)?
But enough about plot.  This review is for the DVD.  The widescreen transfer is anamorphic but disappointing.  Fine details shimmer throughout.  The muted color scheme is sometimes nicely represented, at other times suffering from smeared, undistiguishable colors and low contrast levels.  A few extras, including some interviews but overall nothing that would suggest Fox's marketing as a ""special edition"".  Bottom line: the movie is terrible.

3645077,2,B001HVZOA2,"If asked to name a guilty pleasure--a movie that connives and contrives--I would have to say ""Fatal Attraction."" At times straining credibility and always titillating while terrifying, ""F.A."" was a masterpiece of melodrama and eroticism. Yes, sex can be spicy, racy, tempestuous, but also deadly. Glenn Close physically embodies all of the emotional pitfalls of an affair, and it's not too much of a stretch that she also stood in as a surrogate for AIDS and all of the STDs that became pandemic in the 1980s. Really, if you fooled around, you could die.
""Unfaithful,"" from the same director, Adrian Lyne,is NOT a bookend to ""Fatal Attraction."" It's not the complement of what happens when a woman has a one-night stand and things go terribly awry. In Lyne's latest offering, he does not explore two ""sinners"" who are both flawed, strong, compelling individuals. Whereas Douglas and Close were both smart, bright, smug, supposedly adult adulterers, Diane Lane and Olivier Martinez have no recognizable traits, no interesting quirks or personalities.
Lane is a pampered, suburban haus frau who resides in a home as large as the White House. Bigger in fact. She and her son, who seems slightly backward, are kept in the lap of luxury by husband Richard Gere. Yes, that's right. The ""American Gigolo"" star, who hasn't aged at all, just grayed a bit, is the cuckolded husband. It seems impossible to accept that this woman who fills her days with fund-raising and facials would need to stray from a man rich enough to buy a national monument-sized house to live in.
There is no reason ever supplied why Lane connects with Martinez. Yes, he is sexy; yes, he is smoldering. He speaks with a French accent, likes jazz music, but he also comes across as an arrogant, untrustworthy sleaze. If Lane had been bedding down with Danny Devito for the past 15 years, perhaps I could understand her headlong rush into bed with Martinez. But, please, she's been making whoopee with Richard Gere.
Improbable and cliche-ridden, ""Unfaithful"" offers nothing to sink one's teeth into. Olivier Martinez as the ""younger man"" is supposed to be an expert in vintage books. It's quite laughable since he doesn't look as if he can even read a complete sentence in English.
The repercussions of Lane's infidelity are exaggerated and preposterous. As an actress, Lane does portray facially the guilt, the sudden rush, the depression, and the exhilaration of cheating. However, I believe it's her impressive physique and willingness to go nude that will stay in most watchers' minds.
Not a good movie, not a sexy movie, not a movie worth a second viewing. ""Unfaithful"" is uninspiring.",1046736000,,2653,4.9774774774774775
3645078,5,B001HVZOA2,UNFAITHFUL was a stunning motion picture. Everything about this movie is classy and cool. DIANE LANE (who is a favourite of mine - any actress who claims to have a fetish for thigh-high boots is cool in my mind!) gives a great performance and thoroughly deserves her awards and Oscar nomination. It was one of the most talked about and acclaimed performances of the year and I hope that means she wins the Oscar! Gere is also surprisingly effective in this stunning film. Well done Mr Adrian Lyne and Ms Lane!,1046390400,,509,4.604395604395604
3645079,3,B001HVZOA2,"Director Adrian Lyne had some experience with marital infidelity in his film FATAL ATTRACTION.  In that movie, Lyne portrays cheating as but the precursor to one of the parties concerned going predictably unglued and with tragic results.  Some ten years later, Lyne returns to the same theme in UNFAITHFUL, but this time, he shows a couple that on the surface seems content but as the viewer begins to dig through the onion layers that form the marriage, that viewer can see a wife Connie Sumner (Diane Lane), who ought to be happy that she has it all: a loving husband Edward, (Richard Gere), a cute young son, an affluent life style that affords her the leisure to while away the hours in volunteer fund raising.  But this superficial joviality lets the viewer know her grip on the marriage is weakening.  She is bored sexually with her husband and is fast approaching forty.  To an audience raised on the climate of fear first raised by Lyne in FATAL ATTRACTION, her problems are immediately evident.  It is no surprise, then, that Connie is set for an affair with a dashing Frenchman Paul (Olivier Martinez).  Their first rendevouz is a harmless meeting, with their doing nothing more than holding hands before her guilt propels her out the door.  Yet, clearly she will return, and when she does, their affair begins.  The sex scenes show a side of Connie totally lacking in the one scene of physical intimacy that she shares with her husband.  In that single scene, he joins her in a tub, and she quickly exits, leaving him to wonder why.  The various graphic scenes of sex contrapuntally set off what is missing in her marriage: a sense of daring that Paul can fulfil but Edward cannot.  Connie is seen as a bored woman who is warned by her best friend that all affairs turn out as disasters.  Edward, for his part, is a decent sort of man, but in the hands of Director Lyne, decency is not enough to ward off impending calamity.
It is this sense of calamity that imbues UNFAITHFUL with more than a touch of a Lifetime movie of the week. Their relationship both before and after the affair is put under a microscope.  The predictability that dilutes the movie's impact is evident in the first few scenes.  With the focus of the marriage on Connie, given the not-so-subtle title, the viewer can follow the clearly marked roadsigns that point to one plot complication after another.  The only surprise is how the movie's core of violence will play itself out.  Given the choice that Director Lyne presents between showing the results of marital infidelity first found in FATAL ATTRACTION and then later in UNFAITHFUL, any spouse thinking of fooling around is more likely to be spooked by the violence of Glen Close in FATAL ATTRACTION than by the tepid ending of UNFAITHFUL.",1045526400,,2778,4.706611570247934
3645099,3,B001HVZOA2,"I'm beginning to wish that one-time director of TV commercials Lyne weren't quite so addicted to the issue of male-female relationships, particularly adultery. It's somewhat shocking that the same man who directed the highly entertaining Flashdance and the powerful Jacob's Ladder has also done at least three films dealing with marital betrayal: Fatal Attraction (oh, please!), Indecent Proposal (you have got to be kidding!) and now Unfaithful. He never seems to know how to end these films, so they go on, seemingly for hours.
What rescues this latest look at adultery is Diane Lane's performance. Lane has always been better than the majority of films in which she's appeared. This time out, she hits it right on the money--deservingly nominated for an Academy Award. Gere is considerably less believable as the husband for whom integrity is everything. (It's interesting that he pulls a hat trick in Chicago but wasn't nominated for, arguably, the best performance of his career.)
Erik Per Sullivan is lovely as the son of this couple; a child actor who actually looks like a real kid. And Olivier Martinez is hugely appealing as the young Frenchman Lane finds so compellingly attractive.
Ultimately, the wheels come off this vehicle and it hits the wall. It just doesn't want to end; there are three, four, five intimitations that it's finally over. But, no. On it goes. And the final scene, perhaps meant to leave us wondering, merely leaves us relieved that this movie, at last, has come to an end.
Definitely worth seeing for Diane Lane, and for some lovely cinematography. But Adrian Lyne should go back to making TV commercials or find different material.",1045267200,,1666,5.0398550724637685

3645101,3,B001HVZOA2,"Adrian Lyne loves covering the topic of adultery and ""Unfaithful"" is no exception to the rule, much in the vein of his more renowned ""Fatal Attraction"".  Based on Claude Chabrol's ""La Femme Infidele"", it is the story of a risky extramarital affair and this time the adulterer is the wife.
Diane Lane is Connie Sumner, a young and radiant housewife raising eight-year old son Charlie (Per Sullivan) in a Shangri-La section of rural New York with Edward (Gere), her husband of eleven years.  On her way one morning to pick some things up for an auction, powerful gusts of wind literally sweep her into the arms of a young French bookdealer named Paul Martel (Martinez).  Paul is tempting, debonair and handsome, luring Connie not only into his apartment to bandage her skinned knees but also into his bed several times in the near future.  Connie is frightened by potency of her attraction to Paul but nonetheless begins a rabid love affair with him, her tightly scheduled and mundane lifestyle becoming reckless and self-indulgent.
Edward's insecurities and jealous-husband radar pick up on Connie's extracurricular activities and he hires a private detective to follow her.  His suspicions confirmed by several black and white photos with Paul and Connie necking and prancing around town, he decides to confront his wife's playboy and their meeting does not end well.  The course of events after their encounter is strange and unpredictable, the movie's ending left open to interpretation, viewers drawing their own conclusions as to what may or may not have happened.
Reworking Chabrol's story are veteran screenwriters Alvin Sargent and William Broyles, Jr., the former known for his screenplays for ""White Palace"" and ""Other People's Money"" and the latter gaining critical acclaim for his screenplay to Steven Spielberg's ""Cast Away"".  Of course, what makes this movie appealing is not necessarily the dialogue but the execution of its actors and the steamy love scenes between Diane Lane and Olivier Martinez.
Lane is fantastic.  Her best moments on screen contain no dialogue, only the transmittal of raw emotion through her face and body.  Her scene on the subway train after her first close encounter with Paul is mesmerizing; sighing with ecstasy, smiling and even nervously laughing amidst a river of guilty tears, Connie fights the emotions stirring inside of her and Lane boldly executes her inner turmoil.
Gere is fair, still retaining that roguish and tousled look of a man in his thirties.  Although he is capable of giving a guts-and-glory performance, the story lends Lane the spotlight and Gere the shadow.  Olivier Martinez, a relatively new face to the big screen, gives Paul that sex appeal that all European men seem to reap from American women with the greatest of ease (not hard, being a real ""homme de Paris"", n'est ce pas?).
Although ""Unfaithful"" is as entertaining as its precursor ""Fatal Attraction"", a lot of issues are left up in the air.  Why did Connie have an affair with Paul?  Did the jealousy of her husband drive her away?  Was it the need for a significant spice in the mediocrity of her life?  Was Connie simply too weak to resist temptation and Paul much too persuasive?  Did she rationalize her decision to have an affair or did she simply act on impulse?  From whence do Edward's insecurities stem?  Of course, these questions will never be answered because Lyne is the kind of director who relishes the varied interpretations of his audience, never revealing the ""true"" meaning behind unfolding events.
For the most part, ""Unfaithful"" is slick entertainment for people who crave a good deal of sexual titillation with their rental price.  They will be assured plenty of it and some good performances to boot.",1044748800,,3750,5.02907915993538
3645102,4,B001HVZOA2,"I've been fascinated with Diane Lane for years now as a movie star.  She's made a career of  mostly being ""the girlfriend"" in a multitude of films, mostly consisting the males getting the real business of the film done around her.  Don't get me wrong.  Even with an astonishingly beautiful face, she was a strong character who held her own.  But even in one of her strongest roles in ""Lonesome Dove"", she still needs Robert Duvall to rescue her.  I wish she could have continued the role she created when they did ""Streets of Laredo"" to see how she could have handled the stronger role Sissy Spacek did very well.
With ""Unfaithful"", she finally gets the role of her life.  She plays a woman who's marriage gets interrupted with the introduction of an affair.  Since the movie poster shows who practices the title adjective, it's not giving away anything to say it's her who's having the affair.
And when the husband is ""American Gigolo"" himself,  Richard Gere, the object of the affair probably has to be pretty hunky himself.  This comes in the form of Olivier Martinez, who looks much like Richard Gere would today if here were 20 years younger, had an ethnic flair to him, and wore his hair and beard the way hunky guys do today.  Although they meet loosely due to his profession as a book dealer, and there is a brief attempt at a mental connection, this is a hot and heavy, no holds barred physical attraction from the get go.  This is one of the rare modern films that treats adult sexuality in a mature, adult manner, and for that I give the movie much praise.
What makes the movie great is that Lane is not in a bad marriage at all.  Gere is, well, Richard Gere, but he's also a strong husband, and good provider who loves his wife very much.  So there is no beating husband to give her sympathy, and she's not even shopping for an affair.  It just crosses her path, and she falls for the hunk hook, line, and sinker.  So while it is shown that she wants the affair, and keeps coming back to him, you also see the guilt side build up in her.  This is essentially a good person who has a flaw.  We don't cheer for her, but we also don't necessarily hate her, either.  The performance deserves an Oscar nomination.
The only problem is that something physically bad happens to one of the three.  I would have hoped to see how the affair could have been resolved other than by violent means,  which would have been a bigger challenge to the script.  But even this is redeemed, and how it has the remaining two character (I won't reveal which two) have to learn to adjust to the situation would give this one four and a half stars if I could.",1044748800,,2645,4.399176954732511
3645103,4,B001HVZOA2,"Richard Gere is cast against type, as Mr. Everyman Edward Sumner, living in a quiet suburbia with his beautiful wife Connie and a son.  The director is Adrian Lyne of ""Fatal Attraction"" and its boiled rabbit fame (or hot sex scenes of one Mickey Rourke film ... remember?), but those who expect ""Unfaithful"" to follow the example of these 80s film would be surprised.  This film, potboiler as it is, is made with more understated hand, focusing the seemingly peaceful relations between the husband and the wife.
It is Diane Lane who becomes the driving force of the film.  As Connie, she bumps into one good-looking French guy, second-hand bookdealer Olivier Martinez on the windy street.  She then parts, but later finds herself attracted to him, and goes to his flat while her husband is working outside.  The plot thickens when Connie gets too accustomed to her clandestine relations, which starts to crumble when her husband suspects that there is something going on behind his back.
The first part of ""Unfaithful"" is slow-moving, but it is done on purpose (and this is a remake of a French film).  I might be making a mistake, but I didn't find the initial relations between Lane and Martinez very convincing, probably because this French actor (who looks like Tom Cruise with beard) is not ready for the work with the caliber of Lane.  But more to the point; the opening chapters are sustained by the excellent performance of Diane Lane, whose character undergoes thorough transformation.  Just watch her.
Gere looks surprisingly ordinary even though we know he was in ""Pretty Woman"" and ""American Gigolo.""  But as is the case with his recent efforts, Richard Gere proves that he is getting better and better every year.  But the real surprise is Diane Lane, who once has to serve thankless roles in forgettable action flicks (behind Wesley Snipes and Sly Stallone).  However, around the time of ""My Dog Skip,"" I began to think that Jodie is not the only one who successfully changes images of former child actor.  Her fans should never miss it.
Reflecting Richard Gere's penchant for French films -- he has remade, as far as I know, French ones in ""Breathless,""""Jack Sommersby"" and ""Intersection"" -- ""Unfaithful"" is a character-driven film rather than a melodrama or suspence.  Director Lyne commits some mistakes of inserting too incredible coincidents here and there, but it is those two central characters that we really care.  See this one as a husband-wife drama supported by fine acting.",1044489600,,2500,4.935560859188544
3645104,5,B001HVZOA2,"Wife cheats. Husband goes berserk. End of story? Not quite...The first hour of the film is the affair from ""her"" side.

The devoted husband and father who has given his wife everything realizes that he did not marry the faithful wife he thought he did. What he does next is what can and does happen when a spouse is pushed over the edge...
What makes Unfaithful such an intense film is the calibre performances by Lane and Gere !  This has to be both stars' BEST performances in their careers so far...Gere and Lane worked together in the early 80's in a little known film called The Cotton Club. The chemistry between these two actors works for their acting ""reunion"" in Unfaithful...Honorable mention for actor Olivier Martinez for playing the part (although quite cliched) as the French book dealer who happens to meet Mrs. Sumner one fine gusty day by ""accident""...",1044403200,,1002,4.661016949152542
3645105,2,B001HVZOA2,"In short - the beginning was strong. The characters were more or less believable. The affair was convincing. Diane Lane did give a strong performance. The chemistry between Diane Lane and Olivier Martinez was as erotic as it was unsettling. Never did it seem that the affair was glamourized; always shot as secretive and sleazy. The core message was obvious, infidelity is a bad thing. This was successfully portrayed in the first half of the film and showed potential for being a strong film. Why the film decided to take a strange left turn and stumble through stupidity and banality is beyond me. Everything worked well up until Gere met with Olivier. Heck, even their meeting was OK. But they had to take it one step further. And in that one second, it all fell apart. Not to mention all the ridiculous plot holes the size of watermelons. What could have been an interesting film about the pitfalls of infidelity turned into a morality lesson. That lesson being, if your spouse has an affair, just kill their lover, then forgive each other and live happily ever after.",1044230400,,1072,4.737967914438503

I found myself looking over to my husband and saying ""wow, that is just what I would say to my son"" or ""That is just what I was thinking"" when it came to how the wife and her husband interact with themselves and their child.
I was angered by her affair, afterall, the husband (Gere) was a great guy! I found myself not liking her all that much towards the end.  Ignoring her parental duties at one point to have this affair was hard for me to take. But, it drew me into the movie even more as I'm sure it was ment to do.
The twist of events was horrid and unforseen. I felt almost shocked and found myself with my hands over my mouth saying ""No!"" when it all happened.
The emotions they had were so real feeling and I believe that Lane and Gere both did a wonderful job pulling the viewer into their minds and hearts.
The ending was just as I figured it would be and I'm glad they chose that one over the alternate. This movie kept me up for two hours laying in bed thinking about it.
If only she had done ONE thing different...their lives would never had been shaken. To look back... is to drive yourself crazy.
I would recommend this movie to anyone over the age of 18 as it is very sexual and It's also a good movie to watch if you are even thinking of adultry... it will change your mind.",1043971200,,1365,4.08955223880597

Essentially the story of an unfaithful spouse is nothing new to a movie watcher like myself, but this movie left me speechless. Unlike most other movies of this genre, there isn't really a bad guy. I mean you could hate the beautiful character of Paul Martel. You could hate the cheating wife. You might even hate the lovable husband. Yet, when the story really begins to delve into the lives of the main characters, albeit very briefly, one can not help but to understand their perspective.

3645131,5,B001HVZOA2,"For me ""Unfaithful"" presented some interesting considerations simply on the basis of the casting of the principle actors in the Sumner family.  This is Diane Lane, whom I had a big time crush on when her first film ""A Little Romance"" came out in 1979, as the wife; Richard Gere, the sexy star of ""American Gigolo"" and ""Pretty Woman,"" as the husband; and Erik Per Sullivan, Dewey on ""Malcolm in the Middle,"" as the child.  Consequently, ""Unfaithful"" tells the story of a wife who has a steamy affair, played by the only child star I ever had a crush on, who thereby cheats on her husband, one of the sexiest stars in the movies, while their child, one of the cutest and funniest little kids ever to be on television, watches and wonders what is going on.
In all these personal ruminations the Gere movie persona actually plays into the effectiveness of the film, because we are never really sure why Connie Sumner has an affair.  More to the point, we are not sure why she, or any woman, would cheat on Richard Gere (Edmund Sumner).  The film's suggestion is that Connie is caught up in strong natural forces, symbolized by the extremely strong winds that literally blow her into the arms of another man, Paul Martel (Olivier Martinez).  But ultimately what is important here are not the causes, but the results as both straying wife and desperate husband go too far.
""Unfaithful"" is based on Claude Chabrol's film ""La Femme Infidele,"" and ""based"" is indeed the operative world (although the story goes back in great literature to ""Madame Bovary"").  Although I have not seen the original, it is clear from the director's commentary and other mentions of the French film that there are significant differences between the two, both in terms of what is shown regarding the affair (more) and where the story ends (later).  The strength of Adrian Lyne's film is that it eschews conventionality, both in terms of how it presents the affair and how it plays out the consequences of the actions of these characters.
This film is one of the most erotic I have seen in some times.  The eroticism is based on Lane's performance (specifically the look she gets in her eye), but I also think her age enters into it because her maturity brings a realism to these scenes that transcends the normal sexual romping we see in so many of these films.  Lyne's direction (and Anne V. Coates's editing) also comes into play as the first sex scene is a montage of Connie on the train ride home with flashbacks of what she is remembering.  The net effect is more suggestive than explicit, but that is, of course, what makes it particularly erotic.
I also liked the way Lyne ends the film (even more so after seeing the alternative ending).  As the plot develops and takes its twists and turns you can see all the generic possibilities spreading out before you, but Lyne chooses none of those paths.  Consequently, ""Unfaithful"" ends as I found myself wanting it to end, although certainly that was not what I was thinking would end up happening half way through the film.
Final Note: The DVD extras in terms of commentary and interviews are extremely helpful in providing insights into the way the film developed.  Lyne, Lane and Gere were clearly into this production and hopefully Lane will at least receive an Oscar nomination for her performance.",1043280000,,3325,4.712068965517242
3645132,4,B001HVZOA2,"Unfaithful breaks the genre conventions of love affairs to bring a fresh and, more importantly, realistic approach to the subject. The end result is a fantastic film that explores the passions and consequences of cheating on a loved one.
So many films dealing with the subject usually do one of two things, either create a spouse who is so vile and ruthless you're happy for the other to have an affair with someone who treats them right. Or the spouse who does the cheating is just a nasty person. Either way, only one is really a victim. In Unfaithful though, both spouses are victims. The affair just happens, as there usually is no strong reason. Real life doesn't always have a reason. There is no real bad guy, just bad actions and the downward spiral that is sometimes caused by them.
The film has a great pace to it, as it explores the early passion of an affair, then the pain and disaster that follows. Everything happens when it should, and nothing is ever completely spelled out for the audience, especially the beautifully constructed ending, acknowledging that yes, viewers can think for themselves.
Unfaithful is definitely recommended and well worth viewing. It's about time a film was honest in its portrayal of adultery.",1042934400,,1238,4.816901408450704

Director Adrian Lyne (Fatal Attraction, Indecent Proposal; I guess he loves directing these types of films) makes Lane and Martinez' sexual chemistry believeable and erotic without being explicit, and Lane gives the performance of her career.  Gere is in a welcome change of pace as the devoted husband who suffers the pain of being cheated on, and he gives a great performance in a role which I originally thought he would have been miscast in.  Though the film may be a bit too long for its' own good, all in all, Unfaithful is a great erotic thriller that keeps you watching until the final frame of film.",1042934400,,758,4.770992366412214

She was able to convey several different emotions even in a single scene.  The best example of this is her recollection of first time sex with her illicit lover while sitting in a train.  Interestingly, this film is not dialogue-driven.  It has many pauses, especially in the scenes between Lane and Gere.  I found this technique to be both tension-building and realistic [this is how couples ""communicate""].  Unfortunately, some may find this slow and boring.

3645137,3,B001HVZOA2,"I didn't have high hopes for this  movie; I think Adrian Lyne trades in cliches for the most part, and that's the case here.  The most annoying cliche is that Diane Lane's lover is French.  Oh, please.  How many French guys are expert dealers in English language books?  The guy seems subliterate--he has a roomful of volumes, but seems to know one poem, and he uses it for seduction purposes.
But this is one of those movies where you can enjoy it if you can set aside your response to these kinds of cliches and illogical actions on the part of each character.  What makes this film somewhat worthwhile is the emotive, nonverbal acting job done by the stars, especially Diane Lane, who is incredibly vivid in taking you through her range of feelings as the affair begins to take hold in her mind.  Not only is she great, she's well-directed, as are most of the rest of the cast.  Even Frenchy.  This is probably Adrian Lyne's most accomplished film.",1042416000,,951,4.547058823529412
3645138,2,B001HVZOA2,"While this wasn't a horrible movie, it certainly wasn't great.  It seemed that the writers didn't spend enough time at the beginning of the movie establishing a relationship between the wife and the lover to make me believe that this reasonably happy woman would go flitting off to the city every day to have a raunchy affair.  The fact that her illicit lover was french just seemed like one more cliche, though at least the writers had the good grace not to make him an artist.
Unlike the other reviewers, I thought the second half of the movie was rather better than the first, because the interaction between Diane Lane and Richard Gere, with both of them lying but about different things, was rather good.",1042416000,,709,4.664

I'm happy to see the film put such emphasis on the pain that infidelity creates in a relationship.  There are so many cliche's here though... bored suburban housewife, french lover, etc.  Perhaps the creator of this film wanted the viewers to see the reality of the tragic topic.  In any event, the acting was superb - Diane Lane has always been spectacular, and this film allowed her to truly display her many talents.  The music in the film created the perfect balance to the dramatic mood of the topic, and couldn't have been better.  Excellent film, highly recommended!",1041984000,,692,4.822033898305085
3645140,4,B001HVZOA2,"None of the ideas in ""Unfaithful"" is new or ground-breaking, and at times it does make you feel ""I'm sure I've seen it somewhere..."", some may think, and rightfully so, that this is just another fantasized Hollywood version of the life of a suburban wife. Yet there is no denying that ""Unfaithful"" is actually a compelling film.
Its drawn-out premise was the reason I refused to go to the theatrical release when my partner asked me to. Eventually I got a chance to watch it, and although I was not blown away by it, I was quite surprised by how much it echoed in my mind a few days after I watched it.
Many people complained about how unrealistic it is for a middle-age wife to be as gorgeous as Lane, and what a rare chance it could be to run into a foreign language speaking pretty boy. True, but if without the attractive cast to satisfy the more general viewers (quote ""Diane Lane naked""), without the additive flavor of sexual fantasy (more than often I heard girls remarking the French boy being ""so cute""!), I doubt this movie would have been as successful, financially, of course.
The truth is, why Connie (Lane) would fall for the book-selling Paul in the first place is questionable. She has a seemingly perfect family, and more importantly her husband (maturely played by Richard Gere) is loving, caring and affectionate. Also, since Paul's sexual intention was so bluntly obvious, and a devoted mother and wife as Lane was trying to portrait would unable resist is quite unconvincing. However, after Connie and Paul's first rendezvous, the whole movie switches gear from escapism fantasy, to plausible human drama (not saying that it did not change back in the third act). After nearly two decades of being a ""playboy"", Gere recently shows us what he could do as a performer. His character shows everything an ideal husband could be, with enough dignity and maturity you actually feel for him along the story down to the very last minute. Lane's performance of Connie, who confuses love with lust, is delicately spot-on. The surfacing of her internal struggle is both despiteful and heart-aching. We almost enjoy watching her being tormented, but also desperately hope to linger on that slightest hope that she may be forgiven. The only big exception among the cast is Oliver Martinez. As Paul Martel, he does not have the presence of an exotic, mysterious lover Lane's character would have us believed that she fell for. Instead, he came off as a sleazy, shallow young boy who indulges himself in adolescence's wet dream, whose main concern is picking women with some book tricks so he can go to bed with them (uh...seems like he is speaking for majority of male population today). His worst sin is that, he will have most of the males believe that it is okay sleep around, it is even a good idea to conclude an argument or cover up your mistake for a pseudo-rape sex, since the opposite sex has no dignity or choice of their own. It is also okay to seduce any women if you have the face, as long as you are not stupid enough to confront their husbands. Perhaps that is what we are supposed to feel, but that is also one of the very few places that fails to make ""Unfaithful"" a faithful and plausible human study.
Watching ""Unfaithful"" is like witnessing the clash between the traditional family value, the moral conscience that defines us as civilized humans, versus the overrated liberation of sexuality that has corrupted so many goods in our society today. The sex scenes are not overly gratuitous, started off titillating and gradually became more realistic, to disturbingly tedious, reminiscing Connie affair, and ultimately her life. Like mentioned above, there are really no new topics that have not been covered before. But under Lyne's direction and strong performance form the lead casts, we are somehow spellbound to watch a tragedy unfold. Even when the inevitable revenge occurs, we felt as confused and complicated as the characters. And rather than feeling exhilarated, we are left with the sorrow that so many things have been wasted just from a split, perhaps selfish decision.
The DVD itself has a standard quality transfer, both video transfer and the Dolby 5.1 track one would expect from 20th Century Fox. As for the extra, though there are nothing spectacularly special, the few featurettes, commentaries and the 11 deleted scenes including the alternative ending actually make this a welcoming package. Whether this one is worth adding to your collection, depends on how much faith you have in your partner, and hope that this will never have to happened to anyone.",1041897600,,4603,4.827848101265823
3645141,2,B001HVZOA2,"This is by no means a 5 star movie. I'd actually give it 2.5 stars, if it were possible. Right from the start you basically can see how it's all going to end. I felt as though the director tried to cover up the weak predictable script by making every scene overly-dramtic with pounding music and flashy camera moves. The acting however, made up for the predictable story.
Diane Lane is by far the best thing about this movie. She did give a great performance, as a selfish immature mother, although it is not Oscar worthy. The other characters were cliched, and the French guy with whom Diane's character has the affair, is downright annoying.
All in all, this is a slightly entertaining movie worth watching when you have nothing better to watch.",1041811200,,747,4.62406015037594

The story progressed into areas I didn't expect, and therefore kept me interested until the end. Speaking of the ending, I didn't much care for where the audience is left at.

He seduces her in the ways all women dream of.  He is intelligent and playful and daring. She succumbs to his charms and embarks on an affair that ends disastrously when her loyal husband(Richard Gere) finds out. Gere is very compelling as a man trying to understand what is going on with his wife.  He is so loyal to her that it made my heart ache for him. The acting in the film is wonderful. The plot keeps you guessing.  The scenes between Lane and Martinez are extremely sexually charged. Overall, I definitely would recommend this movie.",1041638400,,905,4.857142857142857
3645144,4,B001HVZOA2,"UNFAITHFUL is a film that might perhaps tap into a viewer's double standard regarding extramarital sex.
Connie Sumner (Diane Lane) and her husband Edward (Richard Gere) seem to have all the ingredients for a perfect marriage after eleven years of togetherness. They live in a perfect house in an affluent New York City suburb and have a child, a well behaved son, enrolled in the perfect school. Edward is financially successful as the head of his own business, and is apparently an excellent provider. Connie doesn't have to work, but spends her time soliciting for charities. They have bountiful food on the table and drive upscale, late model cars. All are physically healthy. The household is free of disruptive emotional extremes.
Some would kill for much less.
One day in the Big Apple, a violent windstorm literally blows Connie into the arms of a used-book merchant, Paul Martel (Olivier Martinez), staggering down the street with a burden of tomes. Both fall to the pavement, Connie scraping her knee. Paul is young and handsome. Paul invites Connie up to his apartment for tea and band aids. Such is Connie's starvation for seduction and passionate intimacy that she's soon visiting the city on a regular basis for a discrete affair carried on not always so discretely. Edward becomes suspicious after odd answers to the usual end-of-the-day query, ""What did you do today, honey?"" Edward eventually hires a gumshoe to follow her.
I first saw Diane Lane in the TV miniseries LONESOME DOVE and thought ""What a sweetheart!"" In UNFAITHFUL, it's ""What a Babe!"" - but, hey, let's not allow that to color my opinion of her performance here. Lane is superb as a subliminally bored woman feeling the conflicting emotions - giddiness, guilt, exuberance, mortification - of an illicit affair, a turmoil wonderfully illustrated as we watch her face and body language as she comes home on the commuter rail after her first intimate encounter. Lane, not Gere, is the star of this film, though the latter is perfectly adequate as the man who slowly realizes he's being cuckolded. My minor disenchantment with the movie is an ending too open-ended for my taste, especially as it occurs in front of the local police station.
Though the viewer must certainly think that Connie is making a Big Mistake for the long term, I had sympathy for her short term actions. I'm left wondering if this is a gender-based opinion. Would I have felt different if the roles of Ed and Connie had been reversed, and the former had been doing the cheating? I suspect so. And would a female viewer have a harsher opinion of Connie's choices?
I liked UNFAITHFUL for the questions it raises. I think it much better than the response it received while in theater release. Oh, and I never realized sno globes were built so sturdily. Mine with the cute, little bunnies in the forest shattered early on.",1041638400,,2869,4.869120654396728
3645145,2,B001HVZOA2,"The first hour of the film is mastery as the Gere's wife steps off the path of respectability into an affair. During this time it has a sensitivity that evokes both compassion and distain for her actions. You understand it at one level but abhor what she is doing on another.
It is the next hour that is horrible. The hour in which Gere rights the wrong and faces the torture of his actions. Why is this placed on the man? Why can't a woman, in American cinema, face the reprecussions of her actions? The movie becomes silly as the sin is removed from her shoulders and taken up by her husband.
While it would be good to think that romance can survive adultery, and that love might be the husband's primary motivation, his actions in Unfaithful border on stupidity at the exact time when the film desperately needs saving.
The movie would have been much more interesting had the wife been murdered or was indeed the murderer. But even in adultery, it seems in fair hollywood, the woman is still sacred.",1041552000,,1002,4.510989010989011
3645146,5,B001HVZOA2,"The three main actors, Diane Lane, Richard Gere and Olivier Martinez, do an absolutely wonderful job with this movie.
This is not a female version of Fatal Attraction as some have suggested.  At least I did not feel it was so.
BASIC STORY:
Diane Lane is the happily married mid-forties woman who accidentally meets a young incredibly attractive man in his 20s who, is obviously attracted and interested in her.  Her husband Richard Gere is a cuddly lovable, happily married and successful man.  What really blows you away, is why would she stray? Oh yeah, this young man is drop dead gorgeous, sexy and is patiently interested in her..  Deadly combination.
This young man, is like light to the moth of Diane Lane's character and she keeps coming back despite the potential harm to her family.  Since she is doing such a shoddy job of hiding her involvement, in her intensity to see this young man, Richard Gere's character begins to suspect something.
INTERESTING COUNTERPOINT:
At one point in the movie, Diane Lane's character is seen by some friends in the young man's neighborhood and she is forced to have lunch with them to allay suspicions.  Olivier Martinez's character comes to the restaurant to have a dailliance in the back with Diane Lane's character, while she is supposedly in the ladies room.  However, these ladies in conversation make it quite clear when they see Olivier Martinez that they feel he is wildly attractive.  One even goes as far to say, she would go to bed with him in a second.  The other, is wilting while recalling a former affair that she has had and its devastation.  Diane Lane's character is forced to see both sides of the coin.
ACTING AND ACTION ARE INTENSE:
There are some pretty steamy scenes in this movie.  Diane Lane does an excellent job also of showing both her mixed feelings and reckless abandon. You see her maniacly pursuing this forbidden relationship, once it is is started.  Richard Gere is great as the devoted husband.  He is playful and lovable, but not stupid. He does everything he can to understand what is going on, until he has proof in his hands.  Olivier Martinez, is one very attractive and compeling young man.  I'm sure we will see him even more in Hollywood (in English speaking films) now that he has done this movie.  He is wonderful as the young lover.
I won't go further than this, but the movie takes some twists you don't expect and some you do.  Wonderful job.  Very entertaining.
I think this movie will make some people think.  It could start some very interesting conversations.",1041465600,,2555,4.739819004524887

All of the acting was top notch, I was especially impressed with Richard Geres performance, he did a genuine job playing a downtrodden husband.  I truely felt sorry for his character.  I also enjoyed the acting by the italian lover (don't know his name).  He's a great actor.  This film also has one of the most disturbing, real life looking murder scenes I've ever seen in film, I couldn't even watch it, I had to turn my head away form the tv.  The ending of the film was a bit disappointing.  It's really hard for films like this to have a spectacular ending, but overall, this was an interesting film.",1041379200,,829,4.5608108108108105
3645149,4,B001HVZOA2,"Good performances all around in this tale of the unintended, catastrophic consequences of cheating on your mate. Diane Lane willingly starts a hot affair with a younger man, seemingly seduced by his French accent and air of intellectualism as much as by his looks. Her marriage to Richard Gere does not seem bad. She is not abused and he is still having sex with her. If he neglects her at all, it is usually to pay more attention to their son. The couple has enough money, and Diane has friends. There seems no real justification for her decision to break her vows. Her lover appears charming at first, but in the week or two of their daily sexual encounters he does a few small, selfish or inappropriate things. Richard Gere is no dummy, and he catches on quickly, partly because Diane gets impatient and careless and leaves him plenty of hints. Whether this is deliberate or not is left to the viewer to decide. What transpires after hubby decides to have a talk with the lover changes every life for the worst. First Diane lies to cover up her afternoon delights, then Richard is the one forced to lie, then Diane realizes what happened between her spouse and her lover. Finally the two of them have to decide what to do next.  The decision, to me, seems clear, but is not actually shown on screen. Diane Lane has a great role here, depicting the guilty enjoyment of her affair, which quickly becomes a daily obsession and leads to her letting her lover get away with cheating of his own. She has intense climaxes, feels guilty afterwards, intends to quit, but returns for more. The film, however, never justifies her choice, to its credit. Richard's role is quite understated, except when circumstances lead him first to panic and then to deceive and finally to confront his wife and his own actions. What Richard does about the affair is also either deliberate or accidental, depending on each viewer's opinion. This film, like ""Fatal Attraction"" reveals the dangers of cheating, but from a totally different point of view. In common with the earlier film, there is an exciting sex scene or two, or three, but the subsequent dangers faced by the parties affected are quite different. I liked it.",1041379200,,2201,4.7020725388601035
3645150,5,B001HVZOA2,"Diane Lane gives the performance of a lifetime as Connie Sumner in Unfaithful.  This moral tragedy begins when upon a chance encounter Connie throws caution to the wind and has an affair with Olivier Martinez (as Paul Martel).  What Connie doesn't realize until her lunch with Kate Burton (Richard Burton's daughter in real life) is she is sewing the seeds of her own destruction.  Diane Lane's stellar performance is truly remarkable and most Oscar worthy.  Unfortunately Adrian Lyne's film direction emphasizes Diane Lane's physical attributes over her acting ability which is probably why he will not win an Oscar for best director and why the film will most likely suffer the same fate.  However, in spite of Adrian Lyne's direction, Diane Lane's spellbinding performance really shines through.
Adrian Lyne borrows from the Max F&auml;rberb&ouml;ck  directed German film Aimee and Jaguar to portray Connie's first assignation with Paul. I can truly appreciate Ms. Lane's marvelous form but it can distract the viewer from the internal conflict between her pleasure and her conscience during the liaison and her post-coital guilt and remorse on the train.  Her angst is so overpowering that I don't believe I have ever seen another actress display such overwhelming sorrow as well as Diane Lane has in the famous train scene.  Her performance is truly heartfelt and should win her an Oscar.
However, Adrian Lyne diminished his chances of an Oscar by borrowing from the wrong film.  Instead he should have borrowed from the Thomas Crown Affair directed by Norm Jewison and starring Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway.  There is a scene in this film where the protagonist, Steve McQueen, is playing chess with his antagonist, Faye Dunaway, in what I regard as one of the most highly erotic scenes in the history of cinema.  The camera switches between facial shots of the two, building into a crescendo of eroticism that is so visibly apparent on the two characters faces that you end up viewing one of the most memorable lovemaking scenes without ever seeing their bodies.  Norm Jewison, in a true genius fashion, let the power of the viewers' imagination take over.
If Adrian Lyne borrowed from the Thomas Crown Affair he could have shown rapidly switching shots of Diane Lane's face in the bedroom scene and on the train.  Her face tells the whole story.  Eroticism is so much more powerful than sex because it intertwines one's emotional state with the physical arousal enhancing both to indescribably delirious levels.  Norm Jewison understands the power of the mind but Adrian Lyne simply could not resist showing off Diane Lane's wonderful form and consequently sold her short.  What Adrian Lyne does not seem to realize is that a woman's sexual essence does not come so much from her body as from her state of mind and the best way to portray that on film is to focus on her expression.  Diane Lane's eyes tells volumes of her arousal, her sexuality, her womanhood and her internal conflict.  Adrian Lyne really could have heightened the film's sexual tension by focusing less on Diane's physical attributes-and he didn't.
A case in point-In the Restaurant bathroom scene Adrian Lyne could have shot just above the bathroom partition.  We all know what is happening.  We don't need to be spoon fed.  Alfred Hitchcock was the great master of the mind.  His films were so great because he stimulated our imagination and led us to draw our own conclusions.  I would have deliberately waited until the very last scene in the hallway outside Paul's Apartment before I showed Connie engaged with her paramour.  I would have done this because Paul gets his punishment just moments later and thus it reinforces the consequences of sin and betrayal.  But more importantly it would have had the viewers' attention focused more on Diane Lane's quintessential acting rather than on her magnificent body.
Switching to the murder Scene-You have to believe that Connie giving away the personal gift of the music box with the crystal globe is what pushes Edward Sumner (Richard Gere) over the edge.  In the scene with Paul in Paul's pied &agrave; terre Edward is barely coping with Connie's assignations, but her giving away the gift symbolizing the couple's marital bond is the coup de grce.  Of course, it is latter in the film when we realize the true meaning of the gift and that she insouciantly gave it away as if she were discarding broken egg shells into the garbage.  Instead it was her marriage which she shattered then tossed without a moment's thought.
Connie's betrayal of Edward and Edward's murder of Paul reduces their marriage to a lugubrious melancholy.  There is a scene near the end of the film showing Connie dancing with her son Charlie with a morose expression on her face and her body as limp as a dish rag, shuffling aimlessly, as if she is just going through the motions of life without really experiencing it.  In the end nothing Connie and Edward do seems to matter.  Things have come full circle.  The perpetrators are now the victims and their souls have been extinguished by their most regrettable actions.  Their marriage is now a bond of sorrow.
Kate Burton, as Tracy, should also get a best supporting actress Oscar because she frames the devastating consequences of an affair so clearly in her luncheon with Connie and Sally at the corner restaurant.  What some people don't seem to realize is that ultimately the affair harms the perpetrator as much as the spouse.  Tracy has carried with her the almost unbearable burden of her guilt for a good part of her adult life and her misery and self loathing are painfully evident.  The grief shown on Kate Burton's face and the regret she has for betraying herself as well as her husband are quite poignant thus earning her a most deserved Oscar nomination for best supporting actress.",1041379200,,5854,4.907614213197969
3645151,1,B001HVZOA2,"My wife wanted to watch this...now I know why.  The name of the movie pretty much gives away the plot so very little needs to be said about it.  Wife (Diane Lane) is bored and cheats on hubby (Richard Gere) with some young french guy that you can barely understand.  Nuff said.
I found this to be incredibly slow.  Most of the scenes are way to long and soporific at best.  The characters have next to no chemistry and there is very little about them that will cause you to be even slightly interested in them or what they are going through.

3645152,3,B001HVZOA2,"The front two thirds of this movie is terrific with Diane Lane in the performance of her career as a wife and mother on the cusp of middle age who takes one last plunge into a life of unbridled lust and passion.  The object of her affection is the oh so beautiful and young Olivier Martinez while her husband is the dreary, dull, successful and respectable Richard Gere.  In the front two thirds of the movie, I was reminded of Jill Clayburgh's performance in ""An Unmarried Woman"" or Gena Rowlands in ""A Woman Under the Influence."" Yes, Lane is that good.  However, director Adrian Lynn, best known for ""Fatal Attraction,"" can't help himself from reverting to his roots because he decides to make another movie two thirds of the way through, one more like ""Fatal Attraction.""

He should have stayed with the movie he first set out to make, one that had no suspense element whatsoever.  This shift also moves Gere into the lead role in the film, moving Lane into more of a supporting role. It is too abrupt and I felt robbed of seeing Lane's being able to give a full lead performance from start to finish.  There was also no groundwork with the Gere character, fully fleshing him out, where I could that quickly enter into full sympathy and empathy with his character as Lynn obviously intends.  In sum, Worth one viewing but not worth buying.

3645157,4,B001HVZOA2,"This was based on a 1969 French film and director Adrian Lyn maintains a European flavor in many ways. The slow pace, studied performances and visual style of Unfaithful are not often seen in mainstream American movies. Diane Lane is superb as Connie, a mostly content but slightly bored housewife. Richard Gere is also faultless as her corporate-type husband Edward. It is actually one of his best performances, ranging from understated to appropriately emotional. The couple live a comfortable life in an upper middle class Westchester home with their son. It's a suburb where almost everyone commutes to New York City by train. On one excursion into the city, Connie runs into a young Frenchman named Paul (Oliver Martinez). This scene is dominated by a violent wind that knocks Connie, both literally and figuratively, off her feet. This unlikely meeting is portrayed as almost mystically romantic, belying the all-too real events that follow. Connie falls and cuts herself and Paul invites her up to his apartment. The contrast between Connie's ordinary life and the bohemianism of Paul's existence (he has a huge loft filled with old books) is stark indeed.  Martinez does a good job of turning a stereotype character (the suave, unshaven, amorous Frenchman) into a real person. They drift into a passionate affair that becomes an obsession for Connie. Edward soon suspects something and takes measures to find out what is going on. From this point, the plot is admirably restrained and does not fall into some typical movie scenarios. On the other hand, there are some very contrived things in the script. Several times people meet or see each other --in the middle of Manhattan-- at just the right (or wrong) time. The most pivotal incident in the film ends in a rather fluky manner. What is frustrating is that all of the contrivances could have been taken out or changed without interfering with the story. Still, the cast is good enough and the plot original and subtle enough to make this a memorable and compelling film.",1040601600,,2033,4.979411764705882
3645158,4,B001HVZOA2,"""Unfaithful"", Adrian Lyne's searing film, explores the realities and consequences of an extramarital affair from several points of view.  Diane Lane gives a phenomenal, pheremone-inducing performance as Connie - suburban mother of one and faithful wife to Richard Gere - as she falls into a steamy fulfilling fantasy with Olivier Martinez (perhaps the sexiest Frenchman ever caputred on screen.)  The emotional and orgasmic highs Connie thills to are juxtaposed against Gere's growing suspicions and eventual downfall.  Without giving too much away, suffice it to say the film in many ways mirrors the director's own ""Fatal Attraction"" without the rabbit stew, and told from an adulteress' perspective.  Against a suburban backdrop - from riverside train depots to school plays - the drama is wrenching as we, the audience are forced to consider our own intentions and fears.
Lane simply glows on screen -- her face speaks volumes whether in the throes of ecstasy, the restlessness of lying or the anguish of guilt.  All are exposed on her wonderful face, her beauty tainted by scabs yet real and fresh on her wounded knees.  This is a woman struggling with her personal truth, and as the story progresses, she becomes both victor and victim, and Lane embodies both intelligence and grace.  Surely, this is an Oscar-worthy performance.
Gere fares equally well in a surprising role as a conflicted husband and father, while Martinez simply oozes enough sexual electricity to light up a Times Square billboard.  This is a star making performance for Martinez, one that should put him on the radar screen for idol-starved young women who love the movies.  Gere is handsome as ever - at first our inclination is to recoil from Connie's risky choices (seriously - what woman would ever kick Richard Gere out of bed?) -- but Martinez weaves a spell on us as on Connie and we are able to appreciate the blunt sexual forces that overtake her.  Diane Lane's unforgettable performance will remind you of how human we all are, and how painful being human can sometimes be.
""Unfaithful"" doesn't break too much new ground for the director, who's covered similar themes though never quite this well.  Untimately, it's a well told story with superbly nuanced performances.  A final word of advice --- couples who watch it together should be prepared to confront demons, discuss the obvious themes it poses, or profess unerring monogamy.  Questions are bound to come up.",1040515200,,2454,5.05955334987593
3645159,4,B001HVZOA2,"""Unfaithful"" is an unorthodox thriller disguised as a conventional story of infidelity. By breaking the Hollywood rules of the genre, it risks alienating as many viewers as it enthralls. The plot outline itself has been used countless times: Wife meets sexy younger man. Passionate affair ensues. Husband finds out. All hell breaks loose.
The wife is Connie Summer [Diane Lane]. She lives the good suburban life in Westchester County, NY with her husband, Edward [Richard Gere] and their young son. One windy day she goes to New York City where she literally bumps into a beautiful Frenchman named Paul [Oliver Martinez]. He invites her up to his apartment. Connie is aroused by this fascinating, intelligent, manipulative guy. He does not seduce her on the first visit. He waits for her to return, which she soon does, to begin the affair. They become obsessed with each other. It isn't long before her changed behavior alerts Edward to the fact that something is amiss. Eventually, he has a confrontation with Paul, but the meeting goes terribly wrong. Connie and Edward are left to deal with the aftermath of her affair.
Here are some of the ways in which ""Unfaithful"" differs from ordinary thrillers: Connie does not stray because her husband is cold or psychotic; in fact, he's a nice guy whom she apparently loves. No reasons are given for why she falls for Paul. She does it for reasons of the heart, and who can ever reasonably explain such a thing? The police are not key characters in the story. Connie and Edward essentially deal with their problem alone. There is no pat conclusion. We are allowed to decide for ourselves what will become of them. Finally, there is no villain. The movie is empathetic towards everyone in this love triangle.
The acting is uniformly good and is highlighted by a wonderful, award winning performance by Lane.",1040515200,,1852,4.882539682539683

In this movie we are introduced to Connie (Diane Lane) a married woman and mother, who inadvertantly and literally stumbles into the arms of a charming Frenchman named Martel.  What ensues is is a growing obsession on her part with the mysterious Martel, until the inevitable happens:  The two wind up in bed and other places over and over again.
Connie fashions all the excuses and cover-ups common to such a situation, but her lies begin to catch up with her and things unravel in a hurry.  Tensions grow out of control and a stunning turn of events occur.
This is an unusual role for Richard Gere who plays the cuckolded husband.  He does a wonderful job taking us through the emotions that many of us would feel in such a situation.  The movie is filmed very darkly and without giving too much away, is a downer.  Yet it is excused by the superb way in which the subject matter is handled.  In many ways, watching this film is like watching a slow motion car crash;  You shouldn't look, but you can't seem to help it.  In a day where infidelity is often treated in a flip and sarcastic manner, this movie shows the tragic aftermath of betrayal.
All in all it is well-made and entertaining.",1040342400,,1223,4.468468468468468
3645161,5,B001HVZOA2,"In Adrian Lyne's ""Unfaithful"", Diane Lane is finally given a role worthy of her considerable talents ... and proceeds to play it flawlessly.  Cast as a housewife and mother in her mid-thirties who stumbles (literally) into an affair with a much younger man, Lane never strikes a false note as her character ricochets between feelings of uncertainty, exhuberance, pleasure, intense eroticism, then finally guilt, shame, despair and fear.  It's a remarkable, career-crowning performance in which the actress uses her entire being as an instrument.  Her mellifluous voice is pitched just a notch below normal, lending a delicate rawness to her character's words; her body communicates volumes as it shivers with sexual anticipation or recoils with self-reproach; her delicate face is a mirror reflecting an unending stream of volatile and often conflicting emotions.  It's taken 23 years for Lane's talent to fulfill the promise she demonstrated as a teenager in 1979's ""A Little Romance"", but unquestionably, this performance was well worth the wait.

Happily, the film is not just a one-woman show.  As Lane's cuckolded husband, Richard Gere plays against type with a quiet intensity and growing sense of desperation that finally erupts in one of the best scenes he's ever committed to film.  His is a beautifully restrained, deeply felt performance that complements Lane's work perfectly.  Despite the fact that these two characters are deeply flawed, the actors make them intriguingly sympathetic and undeniably fascinating.  Olivier Martinez offers strong support as Lane's lover, and Chad Lowe also scores in his brief scenes as one of Gere's friends and employees.

On the technical side, the film is expertly edited (especially note the sequence in which Lane rides the train home while remembering the events of the afternoon; and the one in which Lane and Gere both dress while in different cities), and the musical score is both lush and haunting.  Film buffs will note several clever homages to Lyne's ""Fatal Attraction"" (a butcher knife on a counter; drama in an elevator; a woman driving recklessly while in emotional crisis; a man slipping into a secured residential building, etc.).

In addition to a superb video and sound transfer, the DVD offers a wealth of fascinating extras: the Original Theatrical Trailer;
a documentary on the making of the movie; an excerpt from Charlie Rose's television interview with Lyne, Lane, and Gere; the director's script notes; individual interviews with the three top-billed actors and the film's editor; trailers for two of Fox's 2003 releases; deleted scenes (including an alternate ending); and more!

3645162,5,B001HVZOA2,"UNFAITHFUL is an example of how understatement in a film speaks louder than spectacle.  Director Lyne has aptly selected a cinematographer, a score composer, and a script with as much space given to silence as to words to present a platform for three outstanding actors to take us on a journey through attraction, lust, betrayal, murder, and forgiveness. Diane Lane is incredibly fine in her stellar role as a woman who enters into an affair (with the sensitive and senusous Olivier Martinez) and manages to play out every aspect of this fantasy (both good and bad) in her body and facial language.  Richard Gere, an underrated and very fine actor, is the perfect foil for this encounter with adultery.  Lyne knows his craft and keeps a tension that explores the full scale of emotions by judicious use of every aspect of making a film.  Highly recommended.",1040342400,,857,4.8493150684931505
3645163,4,B001HVZOA2,"This movie is so well-done, I was tempted to give it 5 stars, but some irksome flaws kept me from doing so. Even so, it is still well worth seeing, for so many reasons... Diane Lane, for one, shown here as a middle-aged wife who falls into an affair with a much younger man, ignoring her best impulses, the ones that tell her this is a mistake. Newcomer Olivier Martinez is another plus in this film...he has a sizzling eroticism that jumps off the screen and he plays it to the hilt, making Connie's betrayal of her marriage and her conventional life truly believable- only the strongest female viewer will be able to watch the scenes of them together without a quickening pulse (or more).
  To director Lyne's credit, he shows how infidelity inevitably colors and poisons a marriage, creeping into the tiniest aspects of life, forcing guilty looks, lies and nervousness at even the most innocent or unexpected times. Richard Gere, playing Connie's husband, Edward, is superb at showing a man who knows his wife so well that he practially smells the deceit in the air before she walks in the door.
  The flaws? Martinez is a bit of a stereotype, seemingly charming at first, then showing darker, more unpleasant sides. Perhaps the movie would have benefited from a more complex person, unlike the rather callow person he reveals himself to be. Also, I thought it odd that Connie ran into family acquaintances while with him, even though the odds were against this...and then an employee from Edward's company happens to see them as well. Too much of a stretch for me to believe.
 But these are minor flaws in a movie made with intelligence, integrity and a complexity that goes far beyond the norm for this type of film - and without a pat ending, either.",1040256000,,1756,4.688311688311688

If you're into adult thrillers, or even just greatly written, acted and directed films, this is a must own. One of the greatest things I loved about this film was the fact that Lane never tried to explain as to why she was cheating, she never had an excuse, it was just something she did to feel good for the time being and felt guilty for afterwards.

Nevertheless, it was emotionally absorbing from start to finish---the outcome lending credence to the old untarnished values that are designed to keep the state of marriage a sort of sanctum sanctorium.

Richard Gere is also very good in the film as Diane Lane's cuckold husband, but this is a Diane Lane tour-de-force that should see her win an Oscar nomination. Judging by the films box-office and critical success, it seems that Adrian Lyne (Fatal Attraction) has served up another winner.

Every subtle emotion and deception is panoshly silked through every scene, every image. Richard Gere, understatedly brilliant, and plays the dutiful husband to the adulterous wife. Men with stay at-home wives may wish to notice that all's not well in the confines of the suburbs if one meets the mystery of Olivier Martinez (or any other seductive stranger). After her first act of adultery, the train ride is amazingly well-done with conflicting emotions and painful, yet pleasurable, emotional reactions to what just happened, (and what she was missing?). Near the end, she even though ""what if I had taken the cab instead of going into the seductive man's home?"" The sex was hot and intense and so was Lyne's brilliant capture and Oscar-worthy steering of Diane Lane's every emotional turn. The film also proved that life after an affair can go on just as he proved in Fatal Attraction and Indecent Proposal though is not one to be desired. A twist of fate ending was brilliant leaving you with the ""what did they do?"" or, rather, ""what would you do?"" Very European ending that always rests the conclusions in your own mores--rather than in the filmmakers. American audiences have to have way to much closure rather than drifting off to think: what would they do? Fatal Attraction had to have an end. Unfaithful had to be faithful to the unknown journey of the viewer in the back of his or her own mind. Maybe the criticism listed here is the lack of viewers wanting to face the challenge of what would they do? -Felecia Constance Rowe, Chairwoman, Felecia Constance Rowe, Inc.",1029801600,,1734,4.962199312714777

3645184,4,B001HVZOA2,"There is a certain beauty contained within this film that makes it beyond a film about infidelity and its consequences.  Diane Lane didn't get my attention until the recent ""The Glass House.""  As a new fan, I had to see 'Unfaithful'...her performance is nothing short of remarkable.
The story revolves around a 'happily married', middle-aged couple living in the suburbs of NY with one small son.  Their life is the picture of the 'American dream', until one day, Mrs. Sumner (Diane Lane) goes into the city on business and cosmically collides with the much younger Paul Martel (Martinez).  When he invites her in to clean up her skinned knee a most deadly affair begins.
What makes this movie different from all the other films with themes such as betrayal, etc, is that we see the struggle and transformation Diane's character makes.  Several times we see Diane reflect on her various 'visits' to Martinez and all at once her face displays pleasure, pain, and paranoia.  She brings likability to a character we should hate.  Richard Gere is one of my favorite actors and I deeply respect him for taking a 'backseat' role in this film.  His character torments himself wondering why his wife would possibly want to cheat on him, as he thought he was providing a perfect life.
Added suspense and thrills come about when Gere starts to suspect and eventually finds out about the affair.  We then see the direct effect affairs have on families.  The murder mystery was thrown in more for entertainment value but the true artistic aspect remains in the adultress' mind.
We've seen affairs start from heartbreak, drunkeness, seduction...any reason other than this film's...boredom.  From boredom and seduction we get obsession, we see Diane become addicted to her breakaway from daily life.  For those of you who love Richard Gere as much as I do, you really have to bite your lip watching him getting cheated on!  However, there is great remorse as Connie (Diane) really does love her husband, but someone dies before the affair is ended.  This movie truly remains with its viewers.  I recommend picking up the haunting tracks 'Moby - Rushing' and 'E.S. Posthumus - Nara' to reexperience the emotions captured through watching 'Unfathful.'  This is a definete must see!",1027209600,,2265,4.936675461741425
3645185,5,B001HVZOA2,"Diane Lane.
As a professional actor and closet playwright, I spent much of this movie humbled by what has to be, if not THE greatest, one of the greatest displays of emotional and spiritual/artistic courage ever to be put on screen.  Diane Lane makes Anthony Hopkins' journey to find Hannibal Lecter within himself for THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS seem like a walk in the park.
There are five movies that come to mind when I think of the subject of infidelity.  Before this, the other four were Bertolucci's BESEIGED with Thandie Newton, of course FATAL ATTRACTION, Spike Lee's message about race JUNGLE FEVER, and DAMAGE, with an incredible role by Jeremy Irons.  BESEIGED is a European art film that seeminlgy tastefully ends where the difficult questions infidelity brings to mind begin.  FATAL ATTRACTION seemed to be written by women who were too afraid of being in love with cheatin' heart men to make any art; under the surface it was almost too campy in its portrayal of the crazed lunatic woman as heart of moral parable--the price of Man's playin' out on Woman--to be taken seriously.  JUNGLE FEVER, as much as I love Spike when he's at the top of his game, went soft on us by making the messenger (sexuality as the basis of American racism) more important than the message (the fragility of the marriage relationship and the human soul).  And DAMAGE was like a more adult version of FATAL ATTRACTION, in that it seemed to be a study of an obsession that would have destroyed a marriage if lust never came to be what drove it, not lust, marriage or infidelity itself.
UNFAITHFUL is a movie that needs to be seen for a person to understand how it towers above and achieves everything that the four I just mentioned tried to do (or should have).  The best double feature I could think of would be pairing this with AMERICAN BEAUTY; UNFAITHFUL could easily be seen as a sublime lesson in what the suburbs can do to the soul, and how it as such can be more dangerous to the soul than the ghetto's crime rate can be to the body and mind. *Boredom* seems to be the only motivating force leading to the eventual destruction of their entire lives in this movie--a woman's boredom.  And yet what makes this film so powerful (other than, again, the triple-Oscar winning performance of Diane Lane) is the fact that it is so well written and masterfuly directed--not to mention achieves ensemble with its supporting cast of men and women--that a clear cut motivation really does not exist.  Glen Close was just crazy; Michael Douglas was just selfish; Jeremy Irons was just strung up too tight and a profoundly manipulative woman snapped him; Wesley Snipes (according to Spike) just had to have some White-ness; Thandie Newton was heartbroken...everyone had a clear cut motivation for their actions (otherwise known as the megaphone for the director in question's ideas about life [or the marketplace]), except Diane Lane in UNFAITHFUL. And that is what will really disturb you to the point of needing to take a couple days out and digest the lesson on human nature you have been given by the time the credits role.
If you are a Richard Gere fan, you will be surprised over the fact that, as good an actor as he is and can be, he triumphs in this movie almost purely by staying out of Dianel Lane's artistic way!  He deserves a *most generous supporting actor* Oscar.  My girlfriend's life was changed by what she saw in this movie (it deeply frightened and overwhelmed her); and I think mine was too.  If you are in love or married, see this movie at your own risk.  But see it.",1026345600,,3573,4.6344936708860756
3645186,3,B001HVZOA2,"is based on Claude Chabrol's **La Femme Infidele**(1969). I am not familiar with the original, but I understand that Chabrol was  fond of Hitchcock and movies with murder and infidelity were a specialty of his, and the afore-mentioned picture was part of a trilogy of sorts dealing with infidelity ( including**Le Boucher**(1969) ),and all starring his then wife Stephanie Audran.
  When I saw **Unfaitful** I found myself wondering where the story was going, with its study of a youngish middle aged wife(Diane Lane)having an affair with a younger man. Something was missing, until somewhat past the middle of the film, when what was a rather understated character study of a woman having an affair that she was probably going to break off anyway became complicated by the husband(Richard Gere) finding out. Then, well past the half-way point of the film, the story shifted gears and became the melodrama that you somehow sensed director Adrian Lyne wanted to be making all along. The effect is a little jarring, as if two stories, temperamentally very different stories, had been sewn together, the woman's story, then the man's.
  Gere's husband's obsessiveness is frankly less interesting than Lane's affair, especially when we contrast Diane Lane's very rich and interesting performance with Gere's more routine one. I found myself wishing that the story was all told from the wife's point of view, especially since this would have created a sense of suspense, the wife wondering, ""what happened to the exotic French boyfriend, and why is my husband acting so funny?""",1025568000,,1572,5.149019607843138
3645187,3,B001HVZOA2,"We know that infidelity does not pay from Fatal Attraction years ago and now the cautionary tale gets renewed through a gender reversal - with the wife as the unfaithful party from the same director Adrian Lyne.
Connie Summers (Diane Lane) fatefully chance upon a gorgeous French bookseller Paul Martel (Oliver Martinez) and is captivated by his charms and flagrant sex appeal. She treads a tightrope between temptation and staying loyal to her husband Edward (Richard Gere). She is powerless to the attraction and her sensual awakening - and thus the illicit affair continues - with devastating results to her marriage and family...
The first half of the movie is elegantly controlled with beautiful direction from Lyne. His metaphorism through the gale to signal a whirlwind affair and constant shots of Connie's marriage ring to hint of her moral dilemma is sublime. His sensual erotic style titillates through intimate camera angles yet is aptly restraint without frontal nudity. Yet the more surprising revelation is Diane Lane who tunes her performance as the adulteress to a virtuoso mode. She is what that clinches the movie - through her emotional turmoil and guilt with her ecstasy to unravel the moral quandry. Richard Gere plays the anguished husband with straight bitterness; Martinez oozes charm in the role of a seducer.
The movie unfortunately cannot handle the complications seriously which is blown to mythic proportions by a murder subplot that crumbles the emotional intensity. It rapidly spins to a predictible mode where it becomes overly dramatic and ridiculous, leaving the ending to the interpretation of the audience. UNFAITHFUL should have stayed faithful to its subtle course to paint a devastating portrait of the consequences of infidelity but it just strayed off to fulfil the thriller part. We should be thankful though, it doesn't preach.",1025222400,,1871,5.24
3645188,4,B001HVZOA2,"This is a nice movie.
The acting is decent (Richard Gere is his usual self, either you like him or not, and Olivier Martinez seems to be a perfect fit for the role -just ask your female friends!)
The screenplay is decent (ok, the story starts rather unremarkably but it gets better as time passes, and one might say that the ending comes as a surprise).
What I liked even more, was the direction of this movie. Adrian Lyne knows the job well. Unfaithful follows the same pattern like some of his past movies, such as 9 1/2 weeks and Fatal Attraction: sex, obsession, (in)fidelity... all play major roles. I especially enjoy his close-up scenes. One such example is the seduction scene, where Olivier Martinez touches Diane Lane's shoulder to take her coat off, and the camera focuses on his hand. This simple touch, as it is shown, reveals the heat of the moment in the best possible way.
But this is truly Diane Lane's movie. She breathes in life to Unfaithful. It could be a good piece of cinema even without her, but her presence makes it even better.
In any case, Unfaithful is a movie that you will surely enjoy.",1024790400,,1117,4.534653465346534

There is no apparent reason for her to do so other than pure pleasure and her lover's character is deliberately kept as a stranger to the audience. The writers did a good job of not turning the film into another ""Fatal Attraction"" where there's a lot of over the top drama, insanity, and stalkers. It is realistic in terms of the manner in which the characters deal with the plot's developments and the actors effortlessly carried them out.

3645190,2,B001HVZOA2,"If you saw Richard Gere during the days of his first comeback in the late 1980s and 1990s in movies like PRETTY WOMAN with Julia Roberts or INTERNAL AFFAIRS with Andy Garcia, you know how good he can be as the grey haired older man, whether it's romantically pursuing a single woman he wants to be his wife (PRETTY WOMAN), or boldly sleeping with someone else's (INTERNAL AFFAIRS)!  Richard Gere wasn't just aging gracefully in those movies, he was THE STAR, and he used those two movies to make himself into the first successful grey haired leading man since Cary Grant in the 1960s.
  But for some reason then somebody told him to die his hair brown for a series of duds, and by the time he went grey again in RUNAWAY BRIDE his tank seemed to be on empty, and now he's back with brown hair again in UNFAITHFUL, and he doesn't come across as a jealous older man, just as an old man with his hair dyed brown, sort of like how Harrison Ford was starting to look in his last Tom Clancy movies.  Diane Lane is excellent as Gere's unfaithful wife, and newcomer Oliver Martinez is sensational in a similar role to Gere's small but important breakout part in LOOKING OUT FOR MR. GOODBAR--this time to seduce Gere's wife, talk about turnabout being fair play!--but when UNFAITHFUL changes from being an interesting affair into a murder, the fact that the most interesting character in the movie is dead is really bad news for Lane, Gere, and the moviegoers, because it's all downhill from there.
  And I don't know if a better story or a different role for Richard Gere would make a difference, because THE OLD GREY GERE AIN'T WHAT HE USED TO BE!!!",1024617600,,1641,4.508417508417509
3645191,5,B001HVZOA2,"This movie's opening scene bears the stark ambience of impending doom, and holds onto it tenaciously for the next couple hours. I actually only saw this film because the pickings were so very slim on this past Memorial Day weekend~~~~~~~
I must say I was both pleased and surprised when UNFAITHFUL far exceeded my expectations:  Here I found a subtly intense thriller where every look or little phrase spoke volumes, where the cinematography was so brilliant you could almost physically feel certain things right along with the characters: the omnipotent elements of weather - the gusting wind, the driving rain - the reckless freedom of a fast ride, the shock of a fall, a blow, a lustful touch, the sharp intake of a breath.  Diane Lane, as expected, gave a stellar performance - wherein she effortlessly mixed what would seem to be a shallow and lustful inclination with so many fathoms of depth.  You found yourself still bound to sympathize with her portrayal of Connie Sumner, an attractive and energetic housewife with an ideal life with the token ideal family - a precocious 8-year-old son with a doting father who happens also to be her caring and supporting husband.  You even come to love her in a way - in spite of the fact that she commits to a course that steamrolls her fate as well as that of those she loves best... (And I must add that I was also quite intrigued by the many very pleasing and lovely metamorphoses performed by her hair...)
I was much struck, as by a lightening bolt even, by the sudden realization that Richard Gere could act!  I do say, though I'd seen him in many films upon many occasions previously, I had not ever noticed this quality so resoundingly in him before!  He delivers his portrayal of the betrayed spouse with a fearsome poignancy.  I highly doubt anyone could have played Edward Sumner quite so well as he has.  Indeed, this role was made for him!
  Edward is every bit the ideal husband comfortably immersed in his ideal marriage.  He runs his own company in Manhattan and indulges Connie, his active and contented wife.  Connie is very much involved in auction/fundraising work, which requires her to make frequent treks into the City.  It is upon one of these treks, on an immensely wind-gust day, that her life takes its drastic turn.
  In a likely twist of fate that would border on clich if it weren't so well done, she literally runs head-on into a young, French bookseller.  Paul Martel (played adeptly by Olivier Martinez) exudes intense charm and seductive energy.  From the moment they meet, there is an almost tangible spark of sexual energy between them.  It is a spark that Connie finds herself reluctant to resist.  As like a magnet, she is drawn to him - and within days, she comes calling with her hair all done up, a lively twinkle in her eyes, and a sly smile on her face - the naughty, naughty girl!  Just before her final fall from grace, she hesitates, but by then it is too late, for Paul has already bestowed upon the touch of her fingertips poetry in Braille.
I don't want to say what happens next or give any more away than I already have.  Let me only say that every scene in this film was charged with intense emotion wrought with artistic beauty.  A few of these scenes were actually breathtaking in their flawless brilliancy.
UNFAITHFUL is ultimately shattering to the senses. It's a devastating depiction of one of the greatest fallibilities of human nature.  It left me sleepless - thoughtful and brooding over all the many little choices one must make in life, and how one wrong decision can take on a life of its own, perpetuating devastating consequences like a stone thrown in the river causing the ripples to radiate out all around it.",1024358400,,3724,4.660550458715596
3645192,5,B001HVZOA2,"Having read the reviews here, both positive and negative, I decided to see ""Unfaithful"" for myself and decide.  I have always liked Diane Lane's and Richard Gere's acting, and they did not disappoint.  Diane Lane is superb as the suburban wife and mother with a contented, quiet life who seems to be doing all tasks remotely, and suddenly feels alive and impetuous due to a chance encounter with a flirtatious hunk (Olivier Martinez)on a windy NY city day. She uncharacteristically ACTS on her strong attraction to him, and through that changes the course of all their lives.  ALL ACTORS WERE SUPERB. Diane showed (just in her facial expressions alone!) how she suffered with her guilt at deceiving her husband and the ambivalence of her emotions....but her carnal desires won out and she could not (or I should say, would not)quench her fire for the hunk.  I disagree with viewers who say that Richard Gere's acting was stiff.  That was the point!  He was supposed to be a conservative, unexciting guy, but one who loved his wife immensely and was thoroughly devoted to her and their child....and also worked hard to provide them with what they had. In his job it was shown how he felt about 'betrayals' when he wasted no time firing someone who he felt wasn't being loyal..(which had round-about repercussions too).  Because he so loved his wife, he definitely was 'tuned' in to her nuances, and that turn-in the-road that she took when she acted on her attraction just gets twistier!  I also disagree with the viewers who said it had 'no ending'.  I felt the director, Adrian Lyne, did a superb job.  This movie didn't get all the hype ""Fatal Attraction"" did (same director), but to me it was much more realistic. The nuances were such as that of ""In the Bedroom"" (with Sissy Spacek) but I liked the way Lyne ended ""Unfaithful"" better. To me, it was clear what they were going to do. (I won't say it in case someone wants to see it.) There is no 'happy, tidy endings' when love is betrayed and families are torn apart, and the director shows this.  I wish more people had seen it!  It was an EXCELLENT movie..(and there have been so few of them this year).  One last thing: The movie was advertised alluding to sexy scenes, etc.  This is what kept me away for so long...and maybe alot of others who don't like to 'see it all' on the screen'!

3645196,2,B001HVZOA2,"Adrian Lyne's Unfaithful is advertised as an adaptation of Claude Chabrol's film ""La Femme Infidele.  Lyne has some credentials of his own within this genre with other ""love triange"" formulas in his own resume, including the excellent Fatal Attraction.  With a classic as the basis and a great track record himself, I had high hopes for Unfaithful.  They were not realized.
Lyne has excelled because he has-or had-a knack for developing an array of innovative plot twists around the ""Love triangle"" theme and a canny sense of casting.  Both fail him here.
The plot is little more than a series of tawdry and explicit sex scenes held together by weak dialog and pathetic plot twists (the adulterers are literally ""blown"" together outside his flat-and immediately go at it hammer and tongs-this is this films idea of ""plot"").  Diane Lane provides an admirable performance despite the lack of any meaningful material to work with-otherwise, everyone is clearly just going through the motions.

DIANE LANE (The Perfect Storm, Streets Of Fire) is absolutely sensational. The acting by all (including Richard Gere and the unbelieveably delicious Olivier Martinez) was very strong, but this is Diane Lane's movie.

3645198,2,B001HVZOA2,"If you were in a long lasting marriage or a long term relationship do you think if the oppertunity presented itself you would ever cheat on your spouse? Do you think you would ever act on a feeling of lust you feel in one moment? That's a theme that is under the surface of ""Unfaithful"", the new film directed by Adrian Lyne, based on the Claude Chabrol film ""La Femme Infidele"".
 As much as I wanted to like ""Unfaithful"" I just felt cheated even disappointed. The opening moments, infact, the first hour of the film seem so utterly pointless, it seems to be handled so badly that by the time something interesting does happen, we've been sitting in the theatre so long, we're already bored, waiting for the film to end.
 If that isn't bad enough, we can't figure out why Diane Lane starts to have an affair. She has a beautiful house in the country, from what I hear woman say, being married to Richard Gere isn't a bad thing either, and she has a son. Everything seems just about perfect in her life, but for some unexplainable reason, Lane acts on that ""lust for the moment"" feeling she gets. This is what breaks the film. Why would she jeopardize her whole life with her family with this other man played by Oliver Martinez (Who acted in the 1996 film, ""The Horseman on the Roof"").
 I don't like movies where I'm suppose to sympathize with a woman when she cheats on her husband, because I know if it was done in reverse, no one would ever find the situation to be romantic, or take the man's side. But, if your going to make a movie like this, then at least come up with a reason as to why the woman is doing it!
 ""Unfaithful"" does have it's good sides, which is what makes it hard for me not to be able to recommend this movie. Richard Gere and Diane Lane turn in very good performances. And, Gere really out does himself. The directing is strong, and Lyne has a way of telling the story in a way where we are never ""really"" bored, but, the film never reaches it's potential I thought. ""Unfaithful"" could of been a great film, I looked forward to seeing it for a while, but, the movie escapes itself. It's ideas don't seem to be half as involving as the film wants us to think it is.
 I'm really bothed by the fact that a movie about a woman having an affair on her husband with a younger man doesn't explain itself as to why she does it. I wasn't satisfied with it's....""well, she just acted on an impuse."" answer. I wanted something more. A missed oppertunity.  ** 1\2 out of *****
 Bottom-line: A Nicely done film with good acting, but, never hits the high levels it sets for itself. Lyne knows how to create an erotic scene, but, I wanted more of an indepth story line. Looks nice, but feels long.",1023148800,,2707,4.32741617357002
3645199,2,B001HVZOA2,2 1/2 stars  This film could have been one of the years best but it just didn't all fit let me explane why...... The movie starts out with the nice family from the burbs on this very windy day Diane Lane goes to the city to buy a present for her little boy and the she gets knocked down from the wind and just happens to meet this guy she also happens to cut her leg and the guy offers to bring her a band-aid any one you can tell she finds the guy attractive but she leaves as soon as she gets her leg fixed up with in the next 20 mins of the movie she has an affair with this young guy and is trying to keep it from her husband after a while the husband Richard gere figures out some thing is wrong and things move from there but I don't wanna give away the film but what I don't understand is why she has to have an affair to begin with i mean she seems happy and she looks happy with her husband and they give a reason why she goes for another guy I didn't think it was good enough. any way the film has some high points but never really goes any where you would like it to go so ill have to say im giving this movie a thumbs down.,1023148800,,1135,3.789029535864979
3645200,4,B001HVZOA2,"It's actually quite good.  I don't know if my opinion is clouded by the sex scenes, maybe dulled is the right word.  But, hey, you can never get enough good, classy erotica.  Diane Lane gives a stunning performance as the wife of Richard Gere.  So strenuous were the sex scenes, that she herniated a disc on her back during filming.  Now that's dedication to the job.
Let's get back to the movie.  I don't think this film is as suspenseful as Fatal Attraction.  But to me, it does delve more into the dynamics of family life and what it means to be faithful and committed to the family.  I found it interesting.
The plot is fairly simple and straightforward, so I won't go into it.  Now to the question of whether you should watch it or not.  I think if a married couple is open about their relationship and would enjoy a good discussion afterwards, then this film is a good choice.  Single people will tend to focus more on the passion captured by the film, which is in itself a good enough reason to watch it.  So there you have it, watch it.

3645202,4,B001HVZOA2,"""Unfaithful,"" directed by Adrian Lyne, is a powerfully acted psychological drama. Diane Lane and Richard Gere star as Constance and Edward Sumner, a couple who live with their son, Charlie (Erik Per Sullivan) in an expensive-looking suburban home. All seems fine until a freakish windstorm literally blows Constance into Paul Martel (Olivier Martinez), a hunky New York City book dealer. To what will the flirtatious attraction between Paul and the older married woman lead?
The performances in ""Unfaithful"" are first rate. Gere brings a lot of depth to this surprisingly likeable character, and Martinez is effective in his role. But much of the film belongs to Lane, and she really shines. She brings a potent mixture of emotions to life as we follow her character's path. Some of her best scenes are totally wordless; Lane needs only her body language and face to convey pages worth of dialogue.
The script is well plotted, and there are some well realized production details; Paul's book-filled apartment is a particularly memorable visual image. But ultimately, I found ""Unfaithful"" somewhat unsatisfying; it felt like a morality play without enough payoff. After watching the film I had a feeling similar to that with which the film ""In the Bedroom"" left me. Still, as with ""In the Bedroom,"" strong acting makes ""Unfaithful"" worthwhile.",1022716800,,1342,5.188940092165899
3645203,2,B001HVZOA2,"It's been a while since a movie has been such a let down on the big screen.  Not only did this movie miss after much hype regarding the so called ""steamy"" love scenes between Diane Lane and Olivier Martinez, but instead fell short of anything sexy but truthfully belittled an already boring storyline by trying too hard to be just that.
Diane Lane, let's face it, still gorgeous as ever and we could only wish to look that good at her age, gives a decent ""out of bedroom"" performance but is negatively countered by the bland dialogue deliverance and performace of Richard Gere as the jealous husband trying to understand how the affair could be the result of his neglect.  Maybe his non-dimensional character could have been a result of direction or his own wayward interpretation of the character but nonetheless, we ALL know the affair was not planned but JUST happened.  However, when his anger gets the best of him and we comprehend his enormous mistake it immediately becomes overwhelmingly paled by the stupidity of his following actions and fails to add to the weak script while it meandors to an ending that completely could have been better but did everything to fall flat.
As one character pointed out, affairs always end badly and/or tragically.  The now disfuntional married couple of Richard Gere and Diane Lane try pitifully to survive and overcome a MAJOR stumbling block and get back to their previous nuptial bliss but the whole boring mess DID end badly and tragically by wasting time and money and if you are wise with yours but feel you MUST see it, it is a definite RENTAL.",1022716800,,1594,4.723021582733813

The film did come to a climax and then you think, 'ok, now what?', then the film keeps going and going and then just ends!  The entire theatre went, ""uhhh!""  But then we all left happy.  The first part was so great and gets you going you forget about the ending.  The director does get his point across very well with all of the emotions involved in having an affair.  I do not think Richard Gere did a bad job.  I just think that everyone is used to seeing him as the hunky object in every movie.  This time he took a back seat.  He played a normal husband.  He didn't play a boring old man, just a husband, a normal husband.  And of course Diane Lane was wonderful.  She did an excellent job.  I just can't wait to see Olivier Martinez and Diane Lane in more movies.  I think this movie really did show their talents.  Please enjoy this movie.

Right after seeing this film, I was originally tempted to think of it as a combination of Bridges of Madison County and Fatal Attraction, but that would be an injustice, since Unfaithful is superior to both. Unlike Fatal Attraction there's no psychopath to focus upon as the root of the problem and unlike Bridges female infidelity is stripped of its romantic superiority to male infidelity.

What we are left with is an incredibly honest and insightful portrait of good people making mistakes.
Even when a murder is committed, the audience is never allowed to write off any character as bad guy.
Every character is carefully developed and even after I left the theater I felt that powerful sense of concern over what happens next to these people. That's a feeling I haven't felt since the first time I saw Casablanca.
All in all, it's an excellent film that couples eroticism with a true sense of responsibility - a rare combination indeed.",1022112000,,1169,4.928934010152284

3645208,1,B001HVZOA2,"Diane Lane does a good job playing the part-- what that part is I can't figure out. Why would a (supposedly) happily married woman throw away an eleven year marriage? She had the nice house on the lake, a career she enjoyed, yet more importantly, she had a healthy relationship with both a loving husband and child.  All they forgot was the picket fence. So why does she cheat in the first place? Although it was never discussed, there was a possibility things weren't 100% in the bedroom for Lane's character.  Even if that were true... well, hello?  Ever heard of communication?  Isn't that what women have been complaining to us guys about all along?
If that's not enough to keep you away, let me say that the ending is very unsatisfying.  Without spoiling the movie, there are way too many loose ends and, quite frankly, the ending that is presented is unbelievable.
This movie cheapens marriage to the point where it has no value. Avoid it.",1022025600,,945,4.634730538922156
3645209,5,B001HVZOA2,"This is the movie that everyone should view before deciding whether to engage in an adulterous affair.  Connie Summer (Diane Lane) is a woman with far too much time on her hands.  Her husband Edward (Richard Gere) easily earns enough money to support the family in an upper middle class lifestyle.  Connie only has one
boy and no serious avocations to focus upon.  She is an attractive and bored woman approaching middle age.  In other words, Connie is a walking time bomb waiting to go off.  Connie literally runs into the much younger Paul during a windy afternoon in Manhattan.  One thing leads to another, and eventually Connie ends up in Paul's bed.  The odds are highly against this become a lasting relationship,  but Connie enjoys the lustful encounters and isn't particularly interested in thinking about the distant future.  The pleasure sectors of her brain now dominate the analytical. Practical questions can wait to be answered on another day.
Edward wasn't born yesterday and quickly realizes that something is amiss.  We follow the unfolding events knowing full well something tragic is about to occur.  The dialogue is near perfect, and the acting superb.  Diane Lane is brilliant and this may be the best work that Gere has done in a number of years. Director Adrian Lyne's approach is thoroughly secular.  These characters display no religious inclinations.  Nonetheless,  the awfulness of adultery comes across loud and clear.  This is an act of betrayal that almost certainly will severely damage, if not completely destroy a marital relationship.  Do you really wish to take that risk?  After seeing Unfaithful, you will likely say it's not worth it.  I can't quite give this film five stars, but four and a half seem appropriate.",1021939200,,1752,4.996539792387543
3645210,4,B001HVZOA2,"I had a great time watching this film all by myself on a rainy Saturday afternoon.  It was cold outside, but the theater was sizzling.  The movie poster for this flick promises eroticism, passion, and raw sexuality . . . and it delivers.  Nobody ever said this was a thought-provoking masterpiece that would linger with viewers for days to come.  It isn't.
The plot of this film is somewhat threadbare.  Diane Lane is Constance Sumner, a content, but somewhat bored and unstimulated, housewife in the New York City suburbs.  Her life revolves around her husband and 8-year-old son, Charlie.  Charlie, in fact, was the entire reason Constance found herself in the City on the fateful day she met Paul Martel, the French hunk portrayed by Olivier Martinez.  Intent on organizing a charity auction for Charlie's school, Constance finds herself besieged by an urban windstorm, and she literally bumps into Martel on the street.  After allowing him to tend her skinned kneee, Constance finds herself swept into a capricious passion with the much-younger man.  They carry on for several weeks, taking risks and getting more careless as time passes.  Constance is a horrible liar and her husband soon grows suspicious.  His heartbreaking realization that his wife has been unfaithful leads the beginning of the end of all their lives.
Of all the characters in this film, the only one that evolves much beyond the first 15 minutes is Martinez's character, Paul.  The audience learns more and more about him as the film progresses.  Constance begins the film as a bored housewife and end the film as a frantic, guilty housewife whose future is horribly bleak and uncertain.  Richard Gere's character, Edward Sumner (a man so boring he seemed be a born cuckold), is disappointingly flat.
Look folks:  this movie was promoted as erotic and that's really all it is.  Those who claim it's more interested in sex tnan in hearts and minds would be right.  That doesn't make it a bad film.  I enjoyed it, and seeing it alone was no big deal because there really was little to discuss afterwards.  It's eye candy, pulp fiction, not an intellectual conversation-inducing film.",1021766400,,2158,4.941666666666666

I walked away from Fatal Attraction feeling exhilarated and grateful that the couple could go on with their lives.  However, while watching Unfaithful, I started to cry in the middle and was sobbing by end.  Yes, Diane Lane gave a wonderful, gut-wretching performance.  But it was Richard Gere who grabbed my heartstrings and didn't let go.  I thought he did a great job of displaying his grief...  Diane was excellent in her performance.  I can see why folks would think that Richard Gere seemed stiff in this movie. However, I saw him as one who was in great pain and was wonderfully stoic as he confronted his wife's lover.  I found this to be a haunting, disturbing movie.  I'm glad I saw it, but will not see it again.",1021680000,,842,4.553333333333334

Richard Gere plays the unaware (in the beginning) husband who reacts calmer to the circumstances initially that you would think.  But things change in a heartbreak.  Diane Lane does a wonderful job as the confused housewife who has something missing in her life she can't put a finger on.
What struck me most about the movie was the way it made you think on it.  There were many little clues left on avenues that were never followed up on.  The effect was to leave you thinking about what may have been going on behind the scene.  Was everything like it appeared?  The movie does not answer many of your questions but it does make you think (if you are prone to ponder).

3645214,3,B001HVZOA2,"Director Adrian Lyne reels us in once again with his patented mix of neon-lit soft-core sex and a lurid tale. Richard Gere and Diane Lane are the ""happily"" married yuppie couple (with a Martha Stewart-perfect house in the country, natch) whose lives are turned upside down by the wife's torrid affair with a smouldering Gallic Casanova (Olivier Martinez). Lane and Martinez ""meet cute"" on a blustery NYC day when they are  literally blown into each other's arms (right in front of his cozy Soho loft, convieniently) and in short order they're making torrid love in various stairwells, hallways and public restrooms (and likely to put some chiropractor's kid through college!) The story then turns into a fairly standard by-the-numbers Film Noir love triangle, with a whiff of ""Crime And Punishment"". If there is one compelling reason to see this film, it is Diane Lane, who has been getting better with each performance since making her breakthrough in ""A Walk On The Moon"". Gere is good, but fairly low key; newcomer Martinez plays his character like a cross between Chris Walken's ""Continental Guy"" on 'Saturday Night Live' and (accidently on purpose?) a young Richard Gere, but it is Lane who rises farthest above the workmanlike script and wrings out the most convincing emotional depth.",1021248000,,1291,5.061032863849765
3645215,5,B001HVZOA2,"Adrian Lyne is not known as the king of subtlety, as in his ""Fatal Attraction"" or ""Flashdance."" He showed remarkable restraint in ""Lolita""; giving the film a beautiful and reverent patina of intelligence and honor especially in Jeremy Iron's portrayal of Humbert. Why the major distributors did not take on the mantle of ""Lolita"" will forever remain a mystery.
In Lyne's newest film, ""Unfaithful,"" he finally comes into his own with a film that is not only provocative but also one that resonates with clear headed thought and remarkably subtle performances.
""Unfaithful"" is the story of Connie and Richard Sumner (Diane Lane and Richard Gere), happily married for eleven years with one son living in White Plains, New york. One day, Connie is in NYC for business in the middle of a hurricane-like windstorm when she literally runs into Paul Martel (Olivier Martinez). After Connie scuffs her knees in a fall, Paul invites her into his apartment in Soho for some tea and thus begins a torrid, ultra-sexual love affair. Everything up to this point is Lyne-like with Lane and Martinez never looking more beautiful and sensual in their entire careers amid scenes of photographically perfect lovemaking.
But Lyne throws a wrench into his usual mix of infidelity amd marital indiscretion by adding a murder and thriller plot that adds dimension and breadth to the film.  Is it any wonder that this cast was interested in doing this film? Especially Richard Gere who is extremely picky about the projects he undertakes.
Even though Diane Lane has been making movies since she was twelve, she does wonders with her character here. Her Connie is in love with her husband and her life but simply cannot resist the charms of her ""amour fou"" Paul.  There are no big decisions to be made here, Connie is bowled over by Paul and does almost nothing to resist his charms...he is French,handsome and young after all.
The reprecussions of Connie's affair are played out with Hitchcockian suspense yet without Hitchcock's 50's sensibilities and Calvinist modes of retribution. The ending is left remarkably open to interpretation.
Even though Diane Lane has been making movies for 30 years, she has never had a better part than that of Connie and she makes the most of every one of her scenes.  She is a revelation in her reticent yet all-consuming realtionship with Paul and with her intelligent and sympathetic dealings with her family. We truly care for her and her situation: she transforms what could have been a negative part into something positive and life-affirming.  Both Gere and Martinez are also first rate and empathetic: we care for both even though they are far from perfect human beings.
Adrian Lyne has had a rocky career with several lows (""Lolita"") and few highs (""Fatal Attraction""). ""Unfaithful"" shows us all what a fine, accomplished, subtle film maker he is and what a diligent and persuasive director of actors he can be.",1021075200,,2929,4.959266802443992
3645216,3,B001HVZOA2,"Like his earlier smash hit, ""Fatal Attraction,"" Adrian Lyne's ""Unfaithful"" is a cautionary tale for would-be adulterers.  More muted and less of a rabble-rouser than the previous film, this new work provides generally good, solid entertainment within the confines of its overworked genre.
In terms of the plot, ""Unfaithful"" is really ""Fatal Attraction"" viewed from the other side.  In this case, it is the wife, not the husband, who becomes the philanderer, and the betrayed spouse, not the odd-angled home wrecker, who becomes the killer.  Richard Gere and Diane Lane star as Edward and Connie Sumner, a seemingly happily married couple who live with their son, Charlie, in a bucolic suburb of New York City.  One day, in the midst of an urban windstorm, Connie literally bumps into a handsome French hunk named Paul Martel (Olivier Martinez) with whom she ends up having an affair.  Paul's nationality is probably no arbitrary plot point since the Alvin Sargent/William Broyles Jr. screenplay is based on Claude Chabrol's famous 1969 film ""La Femme Infidel.""
As a director, Lyne certainly knows how to spin a good yarn, and, despite the fact that everything that occurs on the screen seems conventional and familiar, we are, nevertheless, drawn into the emotional plight that this attractive woman finds herself going through.  As with all films of this type, ""Unfaithful"" features the obligatory scene wherein the adulterous party bumps into her gossipy girlfriends within a stone's throw of the new love interest and has to pretend that everything is hunky dory and peachy keen in her marriage.  We also have the inevitable sequence in which the bold lovers are passionately making out in a restaurant while an acquaintance of the woman, unbeknownst to her, is busy taking copious mental notes of the proceedings.  I also find it interesting that movies featuring female adulterers as main characters always seem to have an inordinately high number of scenes set on commuter trains.  This convention goes all the way back to the 1940's and David Lean's great film ""Brief Encounter"" and can be seen in 1984's ""Falling in Love"" with Meryl Streep as well.  It's just an observation, for what it's worth.
Much of the success of ""Unfaithful"" can be attributed to Diane Lane, who manages to make her character both believable and touching, even in those moments when she is seen as being at her least morally attractive.  Though we may reject what she is doing on an intellectual level, we can certainly identify with the immense internal struggle she is going through between intense, physical passion on the one hand and a sense of duty to husband and family on the other.  Had the movie been content to play out the story in a more realistic way, it might have avoided the disappointment that comes in the second half.  I guess that the filmmakers felt that trying to resolve this dicey situation without resorting to melodrama would make for less of an impact at the box office, so we are confronted with the inevitable shift to a crime thriller scenario.  In a way, the filmmakers are to be congratulated for at least toning down this aspect of the plot, which - as it did in ""Fatal Attraction"" - could easily have spiraled off into over-the-top excess.  Yet, for some odd reason, the result of this subtle approach is, paradoxically, to give to the movie an unformed and unfinished feel, as it dribbles away into a lady-or-the-tiger copout ending.
Although Lane does a beautiful job capturing the subtle emotional nuances of her character, the same cannot always be said for Gere, who comes across as stiff and stodgy much of the time.  Even worse is Olivier Martinez, who barely registers at all in the poorly written part of the dashing young lover.  In all fairness to the actor, however, one should note that he isn't really given much to work with here.  The real scene-stealer turns out to be young Erik Per Sullivan, the youngest brother from ""Malcolm in the Middle,"" who lights up the screen with his unaffected, good-natured charm.
It's been a long time since I've seen Chabrol's ""La Femme Infidel,"" but I remember feeling, as I was watching that film, that, despite the fact that the story itself was conventional and almost hackneyed, I was in the hands of a master artist who could make me see truths contained in the material that I had never perceived before.  Lyne's film, though involving at times, never gets close to that level of mastery and insight.  ""Unfaithful"" has its moments, but it ends up settling for competency at the expense of artistry.",1021075200,,4571,4.888745148771022
