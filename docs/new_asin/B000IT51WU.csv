8147355,2,B000IT51WU,"I viewed this DVD -- I guess when I ordered it I thought it would be a better made product.  The age of the DVD did not have the impact I thought it would.  It was great in it's time, but now our current population just cannot relate to it.  Since I'm a Drug and Alcohol Counselor, most of the films in this DVD did not apply.  I will keep looking for more up-to-date movies.",1172448000,2,375,3.96
