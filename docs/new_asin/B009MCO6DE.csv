8542993,3,B009MCO6DE,I bought this to learn more about Torroba (whom I recently discovered through Ana) and to have more DVD of Ana Vidovic. It is great quality video and music. My main complaint is that there is just not more of it. It comes in at 31 minutes. It's like they just couldn't wait to end this. Even as the final credits roll and one of the pieces from Castles of Spain is playing the music cuts off and ends to black. Geez....not 5 seconds left in the budget. Just dissapointing that way. Not much from his operas either. You go to the trouble of making this and you can't fill up 15 more minutes worth of anything.  But Ana is sublime as she always is. I'll probably seek out the book to learn more of Torroba..,1352073600,5,705,4.1838235294117645
