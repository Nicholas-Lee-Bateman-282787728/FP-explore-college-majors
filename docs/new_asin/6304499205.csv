So often when a story shows a problem and then a solution, the lasting impression is of the negative rather than the positive.  The net result is that they instill or worsen fears and bad habits instead of curing them.

The good news in this case is that there is a wonderful alternative--in the very same vein--with no content problems whatsoever!  Try 'Richard Scarry's Best Counting Video' instead!",1096502400,,500,4.9879518072289155
