1814010,4,B00007JMF2,"Anyone who watched this series on the Disney Channel will love this 7 season set.  I forgot just how good this series was.  The reason I am giving it only 4 stars is because there is no closed captioning.  I am surprised it is not an option, but there you have it.",1497398400,6,264,4.038461538461538

Excellent acting, wonderful scenery and engaging story lines. They make us laugh, cry and rejoice, often in each episode. We have vacationed on Prince Edward Island, a land of amazing scenery, and it is like a revisit when we watch these shows. I highly recommend this set!!!",1489536000,4,404,4.5479452054794525

1814041,5,B00007JMF2,"One of our sons & his wife requested the 7 season collection (91 hours) of tv excellence with great lessons  to be learned, to be the ONLY gift for their entire family for Christmas from us due to price. The kids agreed. They watch little, if any, tv but have seen some episodes already and longed to have it all. The whole family expressed excitement at access to this series. Enjoy, kids and grandkids! Easy to order; came as promised on-time.
Tried to order at B&N first but they only offered it episodes singly and expensive. The clerk said, ""we can't beat that group price for all episodes, so get it where you can!"" Thanks, Amazon.",1484697600,,637,4.491379310344827

1814063,5,B00007JMF2,"I loved Anne of Green Gables and was concerned this series would not measure up, but thankfully I was completely wrong! This is a truly wonderful series and has a superb cast of actors and actresses. It started a bit slow for me, but very quickly it became quite entertaining. Each season seems to get even better, as more characters are added and lives become more complex. My family and I have enjoyed it immensely. The characters are so relatable and the acting is so good, you truly feel a part of them, I am so glad to have found this series and feel it is a true hidden gem in entertainment. If you enjoy family entertainment, I definitely think you will enjoy this series!",1463961600,3,679,4.44
1814064,3,B00007JMF2,"The movie is good, but it was recommended by Amazon to purchase the movie along with the series. It was a complete waste of money because it is all in the first season. Also, this movie is good, but not nearly as good as the seasons that follow.",1463961600,4,245,4.125

1814069,5,B00007JMF2,"Lovely show for kids and adults. I think of it as the classy Little House on the Prairie. Sara is the least appealing character, but still much improved from the book version, where she was downright conceited and spiteful. The show takes everything useful from the book and gets rid of glaring flaws ( like incessant weight commentary on Felix and The Awkward Man marrying a teenager.) The only episode I really didn't enjoy was the Duncan McTavish one, where the social harassment of single Marilla Cuthbert got too ugly.
But otherwise a gorgeous show. I highly recommend it.",1461715200,,577,4.838383838383838
1814126,5,B00007JMF2,This as purchased as a requested gift. The person seems to enjoy it.,1461628800,,68,4.3076923076923075
1814127,5,B00007JMF2,Awesome. Great family film and strong acting as well as familiar characters from Anne of Green Gables! Children will probably like it a lot.,1461369600,2,140,4.875
1814128,4,B00007JMF2,"Is very entertaining; logically flows well for ageing until season 6, then characters are aged with new actors to look several years older in only a 2-3 episode time span and Sarah Polley is no longer a feature character (Sarah's character is the whole purpose for the series!)! I'm wondering if these 'sweeping changes' that season 6 Special Features discusses has anything to do with why the show doesn't last more than 7 seasons. I was enthralled through the first 5. Jackie Burroughs is one amazing actress!",1461369600,2,511,4.885057471264368

1814131,4,B00007JMF2,Great series,1459209600,,12,5.5
1814132,5,B00007JMF2,"This is a great series, akin to Anne of Green Gables with some crossover between the two series. Each episode is a vignette into these lovely characters' lives and after a while you feel like you're visiting old friends. There's lessons to be learned, so it's great for kids too, but it's not at all preachy. Wonderfully flawed characters, variety of plot lines, and gorgeous sets to boot - there's not much missing here. The acting isn't always top notch, but the veteran actors just hit it out of the park every time. As for the quality of this DVD set, don't expect HD. It's a slightly older series and your eyes (or expectations) need to adapt a bit. I was ready to return it after watching the first few minutes because of the poor video quality (a bit blurry and unfocused), but after fiddling around with the tv settings, I was able to improve the quality. Just don't watch it up close on a large tv and check the digital noise filter in the tv settings (I set mine to high). This is definitely one of my favorite series of all time!",1457740800,7,1040,4.393782383419689

1814134,3,B00007JMF2,Ok so the show itself is fabulous and very special for my mother and I and my daughter...3 generations. and this is the only place we found the entire series together. However I only did 3 stars because the price is just absolutely outrageous.,1454716800,9,243,4.545454545454546

1814166,5,B00007JMF2,I love the series except I received a repeated disc of Season 1 disc 3 instead of disc 2 which is missing. How do I go about getting disc 2? Please help me on this matter. I spent a lot of money on the whole collection.,1450828800,,219,3.782608695652174
1814167,3,B00007JMF2,"I loooooove this show and want to own it, the three stars are because I can't think of any reason it is so 'out of reach' expensive!?  I think so many would love these and would buy them (my family included) if they weren't SO much money! ",1449532800,8,239,4.0638297872340425
1814168,5,B00007JMF2,I had only seen a few of these when I was a kid and was so excited to find out that it was am entire series. I bought this probably about a year ago and I'm about to watch them all over again!,1449360000,2,192,3.488372093023256

1814170,1,B00007JMF2,"This series is NOTHING like Anne of Green Gables.  The acting is forced and the plots are silly and boring..  Definitely not for adults and maybe not for kids either as the kids are mostly brats, including the 'heroine'.  This is the opposite of Little House on the Prairie.  I can't believe it won any awards.",1443312000,3,310,4.482142857142857

1814175,5,B00007JMF2,"My wife and I got hooked on ""Avonlea"" during its initial run on The Disney Channel in the early 1990's. As I recall we were both very pleased to find a show devoid of all of the double entendre and sexual innuendo that was becoming so prevalent on prime time television in those days.  Well here we are more than two decades later and network and cable TV continues to sink to new lows.  My wife and I simply don't watch it anymore.  As an alternative we have built our own library of classic motion pictures and quality television shows.  A couple of years ago we purchased all seven seasons of Kevin Sullivan's phenomenal Canadian TV series ""Road to Avonlea"".  They were not cheap but I must tell you they were worth every penny.  We quickly discovered that we had only seen about half of the episodes on Disney.  We have just concluded viewing the entire seven seasons of the series for a second time and we just never get tired of watching these shows.  To our way of thinking ""Road to Avonlea"" is probably the finest television series ever made.  In late 2013 Sullivan Entertainment released Road to Avonlea: The Complete Emmy Award-Winning Series.  For devotees of the show this is definitely the way to go.  The shows are presented in the widescreen, high-definition format and each episode has been lovingly remastered.  Furthermore, you will save about 10% by purchasing this compilation package as opposed to buying each season individually.

You should know that the folks at Sullivan Entertainment did not cut corners when putting this package together.  Not only are all 91 episodes of this highly-acclaimed series included but you will also find 21 special features including a wonderful retrospective on the series called ""A Fond Farewell:  The Cast Looks Back"".  What I found so remarkable about this series is how much I actually cared about the characters.  This was true from the earliest days of the show right down to the very end.  Meanwhile, I always sensed that this was a cast and crew that deeply cared not only for each other but also for the quality television program that they were creating.  The attention to detail is remarkable. Kevin Sullivan has left us with an amazing body of work that will be enjoyed for generations to come.  The acting was always exceptional,  the writing superb and the photography nothing short of spectacular.  There were less than a handful of episodes that I did not care for.  ""Road to Avonlea"" is that rare show that can be enjoyed by the entire family. If you are looking for quality entertainment for your family look no further. It simply does not get any better than this.  Very highly recommended!",1438905600,104,2666,4.745652173913044
1814206,5,B00007JMF2,I bought this for my wife and she just absolutely adores it!,1438732800,,60,4.083333333333333

and this movie turn series that lasted seven seasons is no exception.

If you enjoyed the Anne Movies or/and books by L M Montomery you will not be disappointed with this production.

I have brought this and An Avonlea Christmas for my friends.

No Complaints only praise after viewing them.

1814363,4,B00007JMF2,"If you haven't seen the Road to Avonlea series this would be a good way to find out if you are going to like it. I liked it and  am now buying the series.

Basically, the movie is episodes 1 and 6 cut and edited together to make a reasonably coherent movie. There is a bit of a continuity jump in the middle but that is to be expected.

Road to Avonlea is based on L M Montgomery ('Anne of Green Gables' Fame )stories about Sara Stanley a ""poor little rich girl"" sent to live with relatives on Prince Edward Island.

It has all the charm and grace of ""Anne of Green Gables"" and all the humour too. If you are looking for a family friendly movie then this has a lot going for it.

The disk has a small extras section giving some backgound to the series. If you want to know more about the series have a look at the reviews for seasons 1-7.",1151280000,60,838,4.024096385542169
1814364,5,B00007JMF2,"When her father is threatened with financial ruin, young Sara Stanley (Sarah Polley) is shipped off to her late mother's relatives on Prince Edward Island. Sara arrives in Avonlea with her Nanny Louisa (Frances Hyland) in tow, only to meet up with the formidable King family, headed by the imperious Aunt Hetty (Jackie Burroughs), who also happens to be the local school teacher. ""Road to Avonlea: The Movie"" consists of the first two episodes of the series, which establish the characters.  Sara Stanley was a character featured in ""The Story Girl,"" which was author Lucy Maud Montgomery's favorite novel, and its sequel ""The Golden Road."" Along with two collections of short stories known as the Chronicles of Avonlea, these four books are the material from which various episodes were developed for this series.

What becomes fascinating in this ""movie,"" written by Heather Conkie (who proved to be superb at adapting the works of Montgomery) is how the premises of ""The Story Girl"" are redeveloped for this series. In the books Sara would come to visit her King cousins each summer, heading back to Montreal in the fall. The cousins were always happy to see each other and were sad when they were parted. However, the situation needed to be altered so Sara was a more permanent part of the Avonlea community. They could have made Sara an orphan, in the grand tradition of Montgomery's most famous literary creations Anne of Green Gables and Emily of New Moon, but it is important that at least on some level Sara WANTS to stay on PEI. At the heart is one of Montgomery's strongest themes, how a young girl forges bonds of affection with a spinster. Aunts Hetty and Olivia (Meg Ruffman) certainly recall Emily's Aunts Elizabeth and Laura and there are strong echoes of that novel in this story. But it takes a while for Sara to make friends with her cousins Felicity (Gema Zamprogna) and Felix (Zachary Bennett).

Sara earns her name as ""The Story Girl"" in the second half of the story.  The  town had sold tickets to a magic lantern show to help raise money for new books for the Avonlea school library, but it turns out Mr. Beatty is a con man who runs away with the money. Even worse, Sara makes the mistake of helping him get away. Feeling guilty Sara will not stop until she has redeemed herself and helped raise the money. When she happens to stumble upon Jasper Dale (R.H. Thomson), known as the ""Awkward Man,"" taking photographs in a meadow, she comes up with grand plans for her own magic lantern show. However, there are those who still think that Sara Stanley is putting on airs and needs to be taken down a peg.

One of the strengths of this series, in addition to its strong ensemble cast of solid character actors, is the casting of Sarah Polley as Sara Stanley. Polley had already proved herself to be one of the best ""child"" actresses of her generation before she got this role and she only continues to prove in this episode and the rest of the series. I used to have the Disney Channel just so I could watch ""Avonlea"" (as it was called south of the border) and made a point of honeymooning on PEI, staying at the ""White Sands Hotel."" So, it is pretty clear that I am just one of countless millions of enraptured fans. Whether you come from ""Avonlea"" to Montgomery's novels, or the other way around, just be sure you enjoy both.",1147219200,22,3348,4.627946127946128
1814365,5,B00007JMF2,"This DVD included the first two episodes of ""Road to Avonlea"" the TV series, or better known in the U.S. as ""Avonlea"", as aired on the Disney Channel in the 1990's.  A touching and family-friendly series about a little rich girl who moves to Prince Edward Island to live with her relatives when her father is accused of embezzlement in his own company.  The adventures that this little girl Sara Stanley has with her cousins, (the ""King"" family) are hilarious and heart-warming!  This is definately worth checking out!!",1077840000,28,519,4.875

7976893,1,B00007JMF2,"This is only a review of the physical quality of the product I received and not of the content.

I had read the reviews and kept my fingers crossed about the DVDs arriving safely.  Unfortunately, when I received my box, I could hear that the discs were jostling around in the case.  I immediately opened the box set and found that the majority (2-3 of the 4) of the DVDs had fallen out of their ""protective"" slots from every season set.  I put them away, but then decided on the night to start reviewing the DVDs to assess the actual damage done.

Ironically - the top discs are impossible to remove gently... I feel like I am going to break the disc every time I try to watch one.  So it's surprising how nearly all of them were rocked out of place in transport.

As of now... one of the discs is damaged. Very disappointing for such an expensive box set.",1517616000,3,856,4.279503105590062

7976896,5,B00007JMF2,"My wife and I ordered ""The Road to Avonlea"" the complete series from Amazon through ""Two Thumbs Up.""  The set arrived as scheduled and we immediately started binge watching the show because we wanted to make sure all of the DVD's worked.  We loved watching The Road to Avonlea series, and apparently many others did as well since the series was nominated and won numerous awards, including 16 Emmy nominations, four Emmy Award wins, 18 Gemini Awards & Cable Ace Awards: Best Dramatic Series, 1991; Best Dramatic Series, 1993; Best Dramatic Series, 1994.

Upon watching a few episodes, it's easy to see why Jackie Burroughs won (3 Gemini Awards) for Best Performance by a Lead Actress for her role as Hetty King in 1990, 1991 & 1993. Her physical comedy is amazing.

Cedric Smith won a Gemini Award in 1993 for Best Leading Actor for his role as Alec King
Lally Cadeau won a Gemini Award in 1994 for Best Actress for her role as Janet King
Patricia Hamilton won a Gemini Award in 1995 for Best Supporting Actress for her role as Rachel Lynde
Kay Tremblay won a Gemini Award for Best Supporting Actress in 1996 for her role as Great Aunt Eliza

""The Road to Avonlea"" also featured all-star guest appearances such as Peter Coyote (Romney Penhallow), Michael York (Ezekiel Crane), Madeline Kahn (Pigeon Plumtree), Christopher Lloyd (Alistair Dimple), Christopher Reeve (Robert Rutherford), Ned Beatty (Wally Higgins), Treat Williams (Zak Morgan), August Schellenberg (Simon Redfox), Meg Tilly (Evelyn Grier), Robby Benson (Jonathan Ravenhurst Blackwell), Bruce Greenwood (Caleb Stokes), Stockard Channing (Viola Elliot), Faye Dunaway (Countess Polenska), Maureen Stapleton (Maggie MacPhee), Eugene Levy (Rudy Blaine), Sheila McCarthy (Betty Blaine), Ryan Gosling (Bret McNulty) Apologies to anyone we missed.

A few of these guest appearances resulted in awards, such as

Christopher Lloyd won an Emmy for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Dramatic Series for his role as Alistair Dimple, 1992
Dianne Wiest won an Emmy for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Dramatic Series for her role as Lillian Hepworth, 1997
Stockard Channing won a CableACE Award in 1995 for Actress in a Dramatic Series & was nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series in 1994 for her role as Viola Elliot.
Bruce Greenwood won a Gemini Award for Best Guest Performance in a Series by an Actor in 1995 for his role as Caleb Stokes.

We did have a problem with disc 4 of season 5 not being able to load. We tried running it on 4 different players (2 Macs, Dell, and XBOX One), but still were unable to get it to load. Upon looking at the center of the disc you could see the circle where the DVD manufacturing process the ""print"" did not complete.  Since we were still under warranty we sent an email to ""Two Thumbs Up"" informing them of the problem with the defective disc and included pictures.  Within the two days we got a response letting us know that ""Two Thumbs Up"" was sending us a replacement disc and that they had verified it was good.  We were so happy we were going to be getting a replacement disc and not have to take the time to repackage and return the entire set.  Amazon does make it difficult to contact a seller directly but the information is there if you dig deep enough.

The replacement disc arrived by two-day delivery, and was incredibly well packaged (5 layers).  The disc arrived in a small 8 and  by 6 and  box (layer 1) with a sealed cushioned envelope (layer 2) with additional packaging material around it to prevent damage (layer 3).  Inside the cushioned envelope was a basic hard plastic DVD case (layer 4) and inside the case, a paper towel was carefully placed around the DVD itself to prevent any damage (layer5).  We have been impressed with the level of customer service.  We highly recommend ""Two Thumbs Up"" and would buy from them again.

The Road to Avonlea was first broadcast in Canada between January 7, 1990, and March 31, 1996, and Avonlea, as it was known on The Disney Channel, aired consistently between March 1990 and January 1997.  As you watch the episodes, you will notice the order which the episodes should have appeared is off (I.e. the age of the children clearly older in one episode than appearing much younger in another episode, then back to being older again in the following episode).  Not sure if it was CBC or Disney that may have opted to air some episodes out of order but it is a bit annoying.

Warning: If you are against animals in entertainment and/or the wearing of fur, be prepared for numerous cringeworthy moments.

Over all the series has been well worth the money and we would highly recommend people to buy/rent/watch the Road to Avonlea series. This is definitely a series we will watch for over and over again for years to come.",1502755200,2,4795,4.7563329312424605
