8682968,4,B00OAI2P6U,"I continue to practiced the stick movements as demonstrated on  the DVD  Straight-forward and clear. The movements are neither complex nor difficult to learn. I have a 36 inch maple stick, and I'm now becoming adept using the 36-inch stick. Practicing the moves also provides an excellent workout. It's fun to practice the strokes and with practice the stick's use becomes part of muscle memory. Which is the point.

Using a 36-inch maple stick 1-inch diameter in an appropriate and practiced fashion is a serious business and it does require some practice. Not to be taken lightly.
