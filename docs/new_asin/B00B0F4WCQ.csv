The major negative is the narration which is dull, and a consistent monotone, does not lend to holding ones interest.",1480982400,,269,4.955555555555556

Now, with that disclaimer aside this DVD contains three programs focussing on wildlife and nature in general on the Arabian Peninsula. Now it's fair to say that your average desert has less animals per square kilometre than your average tropical rainforest. That aside the animals that eke out a life in these areas can be equally fascinating. The three episodes on this DVD look at a swathe of animals and shows how interconnected their lives are. It looks at the smaller critters as well as the 'big ticket' creatures such as falcons and the Arabian Leopard.

The photography is nice, this is under the BBC Earth banner after all. And the way the filmmakers have gotten shots of some of these animals - that are mostly active at night - is a story in itself. The viewer gets to see the work that goes into setting up motion sensor cameras and the like and gets to see how locals are vitally important to the success of these endeavours. Speaking of people, they are looked at in the series too. We see the way camels are part of the fabric of society and some of the footage of camel races is interesting. As is the discussion of the sport of falconry.

There are plenty of shows around that talk about the Amazon Rainforest or the plethora of animals in Africa. There are far fewer that look at the outwardly seeming bleak surrounds of the deserts of the Middle East. That alone makes this a great pick up for the armchair traveller or nature buff.",1426809600,,1561,4.508833922261484
