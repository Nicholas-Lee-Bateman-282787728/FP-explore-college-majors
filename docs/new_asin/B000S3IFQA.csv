2879930,4,B000S3IFQA,You will find out things about him that most people don't know. Very interesting. Especially for a car or motorcycle racing fan. And of course a fan of his movies.,1372550400,3,163,4.466666666666667
2879931,5,B000S3IFQA,I love Steve McQueen and this is a great documentary about him. I wish someone would do a new version.,1370476800,,102,4.15

2879933,5,B000S3IFQA,"A very good documentary of Steve McQueen's personal life and career.  His first wife, Neile Adams, and his colleagues: directors and a stunt man, were interviewed.  Very well done.",1365120000,5,180,5.172413793103448
2879934,5,B000S3IFQA,This fast paced celebration of an excellent and defiant actor who died of cancer at age 50 is a treat for all Steve McQueen fans as well as film students and cinema buffs. I loved it!,1359417600,,183,4.111111111111111
2879935,3,B000S3IFQA,"I finished watching all of Steve McQueen's 30 or so movies and saw this documentary. I have been reading books on Steve McQueen. This documentary looked promising since Steve's first wife and children and coworkers make appearances. Although there are a few interesting tidbits in this documentary, it is super low-budget and unexciting.
The documentary is from 1986 so it was done 6 years after Steve McQueen passed away. It's about an hour long and contains many long clips from several of his movies. Steve's first wife Neile is interviewed the most and provides some insight into Steve. Steve's widow Barbara Minty and his second wife Ally McGraw do not appear. There are a few words from his son Chad and daughter Terry. Terry passed away in 1998 so obviously is not included in the various DVD bonus features I have watched. It was nice, but sad, to see this lovely young lady. Actors Shelly Winters, Don Gordon and Karl Malden talk about their experiences with Steve McQueen. Yet, there is a feeling so many more people could have been interviewed. It seems like that only came later with bonus features on the DVDs of Steve's major movies.
You will get more information from the DVD bonus features on several of Steve's films. In fact, the exact same people, minus Terry, are interviewed at length in those features. MAN ON THE EDGE might be mildly insightful for someone who knows little about Steve McQueen but this documentary is seriously uninspired and doesn't delve deeply into McQueen's life. Yes, there is an overview but little detail. Besides seeing Terry, the other plus to this documentary is seeing some family home movies of Steve playing with his young children.
Although MAN ON THE EDGE has some merit, it is seriously disappointing in it scope of this very complex and multi-faceted man.",1346371200,6,1812,4.867313915857605
2879946,4,B000S3IFQA,"One of my all time favorite movie stars, so I couldn't not like this. I've read just about everything one can get one's hands on regarding the history of , ""The King of Cool"" but seeing the early stills, the 'Defender' clips, and interview with his devoted wife, paints a better picture of this brilliant yet troubled man. I particularly like the clear, insightful comments by Norm Jewison and Robert Wise. What I wouldn't give to have been a fly on the wall, watching one of those films being made. Footnote: If you have the time to watch, ""The Sand Pebbles"" DVD that has Richard Crenna and Robert Wise commentary, you'll gain more insight on what made Steve McQueen a star. Happy watching!",1475539200,,691,4.626016260162602
2879947,4,B000S3IFQA,"Lots of screen footage and interviews, clips from movies and discussions with people who played significant roles in McQeen's life. It describes his youth, beginning years and the development of his career all the way to the end.  I appreciated that they addressed his family life as well.

2879995,4,B000S3IFQA,"This was very good, there is no one like Steve McQueen, a true achiever in motorsports, not just an actor.  Flawed, like we all are, but a man of integrity who appreciated those who were kind to him in his often painful childhood.  I believe it would have been beneficial and historically significant if the documentary had noted that toward the end of his life he became a believer in Jesus of Nazareth.  Inclusion of that important fact would have made it 5 stars.  But the film was a great history nonetheless.",1420243200,4,513,4.543478260869565

There is not much detail about his racing accomplishments at all or the things that make him a real stand up guy and gear head hero outside of his movie career.  But it does give some detail about his early life and family, and details his rise to star dome. I did not realize some of the information and he is a little more east coast than I knew or liked.
