656123,5,6303471404,"I remember when, at the age of 12, my babysitter(who strikingly resembled Catherine Mary Stewart)let me watch this film with her about a young college student who had an affair with his roommate's beautiful mother. Having been exposed to the act of lovemaking, ... physical love, or however people describe the emotional and physical act, I was impressed with how the film turned out. It may have an '80's version of the 1967 film The Graduate, but it was a joy to watch. British actress Jacqueline Bisset not only radiates her beauty, but she also radiates someone who is sad, if not depressed. Andrew McCarthy (in his first role) does an excellent job of playing a young man who changes from a nerd type to a suave and debonair ladies man. This film was, in many ways, one of the brat pack films, and starred many actors from that era who were just getting started in the industry. Not only are the ... love scenes between Andrew and Jacqueline convincing, they are beautiful and moving. The rest of the film is also enjoyable to watch. If you enjoyed the era of the 1980's and older, beautiful, and sophisticated women characters, then you'll enjoy this hilarious, if not moving film.
*Andrew McCarthy stated in an interview that he must have been doing something right when he was offered the role. This was after he had filmed his love scenes with Jacqueline Bisset.
*As always, rumors of the love scenes between the two indicated that they were real and not just acting.",1052006400,12,1476,4.680769230769231
656124,5,6303471404,"This is definately one of the movies that made my personal Top 100 Favorite Movies of All Time! I have always loved watching this movie (have seen it at least 50 times) and have only had one reservation.... Jackie Bissett hated this one because a lot of her scenes were cut from the final film. I want a special edition that puts the whole movie back together again, one that shows more of why she does the things she does... Plus, I am sure that there were more scenes of Rob and Andrew that were cut... sometimes ""More is Better"", or in this case, ""More would make great, greater!"" Anyone out there in Hollyrock listing???",999993600,5,624,4.434782608695652
656125,4,6303471404,"Definatly one of my fave films from the eighties. A romantic teen comedy dealing with love and sexual expierences. Andrew Mcarthy plays Johnathan a  shy introvetrd high school student who attends a posh all boys private  school, his roomate Skip Played very well by Rob lowe is the sexually  charged playboy who gets the both of them into a lot of trouble. When one  night Johnathan is pressured By Skip and fellow peers to go out on the town  and have a sexual encounter.  After making a fool of himself at  seedy bar  Johanthan meets an older,viavicous woman by the name of Ellen and the two  embark on a passionate night of lovemaking(Especally in the elevator  scene)But unknowing to Johanthan the older woman he is sleeping with is the  mother to his best friend and roomate Skip. An outragous comedy dealing  with a subject people can relate to, The pressures of having sex the need  to feel wanted and respected by people around you. It`s not often a story  like this is made into a comedy but the producers did a great job in doing  so. Both Andrew Mcarthy and Rob Lowe did very well and were belivable in  their roles.",963878400,16,1127,4.532338308457711
656126,4,6303471404,"I saw this film when it first came out, and also saw the Siskel & Ebert review. They both liked the opening bit, but thought the film went rapidly downhill after the first scenes. I remember Roger Ebert complaining  about the near-pedophilia depicted by Jacqueline Bisset. I think he missed  the point. The story is about the relationship -- the friendship, the bond  of love -- between the McCarthy and Lowe characters. Bisset's character  obviously had psychological problems, but she did think the boy (McCarthy)  was over 21 (so much for charges of pedophilia). The Bisset/McCarthy  ""romance"" sets up the crisis (Lowe discovering that his best  friend is sleeping with his mother) which tests the boys' friendship. The  climax is the fight, which desolves into a reaffirmation of their  freindship. The film is quite funny in places, escpecially in the opening  scenes, involves a bit of the coming-of-age spin, and actually has some  depth as it explores the development, testing, and survival of friendship.  An extra delight in this film is the debut (I think) of John Cusack; small  part, but right on the money.",960595200,16,1120,4.989189189189189

We have school roommates Rob Lowe as Skip and Andrew McCarthy as Jonathan, I loved the genuine interaction between these 2 actors, you felt they were friends and it comes across. Skip sends Jonathan to Chicago to lose his virginity and gives him $100.00 to boot, Jonathan meets an older woman and well....things happen, later Skip invites Jonathan to his palatial mansion for the holidays and realizes the woman he has been seeing is Skip's mother. Well things get complicated and I just love this movie. I originally had it on DVD but it was one I had to get on Blu Ray. The cast is superb with Jacqueling Bisset and Cliff Robertson as Skips parents and the boys at the school is a who's who of young fine actors at the time.",1479340800,,779,4.416666666666667

656810,5,6303471404,"As far as 80's teen movies go this 2-disc collection is a must-see and must-have. For less than $2 and a quarter each you can't go wrong. It's actually cheaper to buy this combo than to buy just one of these movies. For starters- just so people know- this collection consists of 2 separate dvds- not one dvd with a movie per side.

""Class"" (1983) was the first appearance of Andrew McCarthy, John Cusack and Virginia Madsen. It was the big screen introduction of Rob Lowe since his first movie ""The Outsiders"" had not yet been released in theaters. Alan Ruck also stars as one of the students as does a young Casey Siemasko, who, coincidentally, also went on to star as one of Tommy Howell's friends in ""Secret Admirer."" (There are actually two young actors who appear as students and friends in both of these movies.) ""Class"" was shot on location in Chicago and a little factoid that may be of interest is that John Cusack, who is from Chicago, later starred in ""Grandview USA"" (starring Tommy Howell) which was also shot on location outside of Chicago in Plymouth, IL, and he also starred in ""16 Candles"" another Chicago-set movie. Many of these young male stars seemed to have their work overlap into 6 degrees of separation without even needing Kevin Bacon. Anyway, ""Class"" is basically a teen sex romp comedy. Andrew McCarthy stars as the pathetic virgin who finds a sex-crazed 40-ish MILF who in turn takes pity on him and relieves him of his virginity only to find out later that he is much younger than he initially let on. Rob Lowe is his wild and wealthy roommate who urges him to get lost in some mindless decadence primarily aimed at losing his pesky virginity. He does so only to discover in a comedy of errors that the MILF is actually his best friend's mom. Oops. Mindless and funny this is a perfect example of an 80's teen sex comedy featuring quite the ensemble cast. Jaqueline Bisset stars as the Mrs. Robinson-type MILF and Cliff Robertson as her intolerant husband. This movie is good for a few laughs and some classic scenes of silly hilarity. It's worth owning if only to see these young actors before they really hit it big. There is a nude shot of Virginia Madsen showing boobs so her lusty fans will be pleased.

""Secret Admirer"" (1985) is another teen sex romp comedy but with not quite as much sex as ""Class."" It is a comedy of mistaken identities and misunderstandings all revolving around a mysterious love note that falls into the wrong hands. Tommy Howell stars as the cute hunk in love with the beautiful Barbie while his plain-Jane girl-next-door best friend secretly pines away for his affections. She decides to profess her feelings and declare her love for him in a note but after it falls into the wrong hands, she must deal with the consequences of her misguided actions. Kelly Preston and a very young Corey Haim co-star. This is another 80's romantic comedy featuring a slew of young actors as well as some older seasoned ones too. If you are looking for good 80's teen flicks then don't pass this dynamic duo up.",1426118400,11,3054,4.612132352941177

In the middle of the movie, he sleeps with Rob Lowe's mother.

Near the end of the movie, he taunts Rob Lowe about it.  Rob Lowe responds with one punch. Instead of just taking his lumps, Andrew McCarthy escalates it into a big violent fight.

For a romantic comedy to be effective, the main character needs to be likable.  In ""Class,"" he isn't.",1425168000,2,510,4.43010752688172

When wealthy prep-school senior Skip (Rob Lowe) learns that his shy new roommate Jonathan (Andrew McCarthy) is a total loser at romance, he sends the aspiring young Romeo to the city to learn the ropes before he ruins both their reputations, but when Jonathan is seduced by a sexy older woman named Ellen (Jacqueline Bisset), he begins a zanyromantic miseducation that starts with a double major in lust and deception, but his luck goes back downhill with a double whammy when he discovers that the woman of his dreams also happens to be his best friends mother.

During Christmas break, Jonathan visits Skip's house and discovers that Ellen is Skip's mother. Ellen tells Jonathan to leave when he rejects her advances, but then begins calling him and begging to see him. Finally, Jonathan agrees to meet her and plans to end the affair, but Ellen seduces him--and that's when Skip, who followed Jonathan, discovers them.  One of Rob Lowe's best films.

657336,3,6303471404,"I just saw this movie not too long ago after having not seen it in many years.  As I was just a kid when it came out, I did not really understand a lot of things other than the practical jokes that were played between the students and the sense of humiliation.  Then again, that's what the horrors of high school are all about, whether it's a public institution or a prep school.

Having survived prep school myself (albiet a single sex one and I am a woman), there was the sense of overprivledge and little to no reguard for others.  Yet, I realize that's what high school is all about based on chats with others.  Andrew McCarthy comes to a prep school and meets his new roommate, Rob Lowe.  They become reluctant if not oddly bonded fast friends (since Rob plays that terrible practical joke on him in the women's underwear and Andrew with the hangman).  As roommates, they become classic frienemies and are in a constant pissing contest to one up the other, as all guys do.  Then, as all guys do, Rob sends Andrew off to meet some girls and become sexually active.  Andrew does just that, jumping in bed with an older woman he meets in Chicago.  Imagine the horror when Andrew discovers that the woman he bedded was not just much older, but Rob's own mother.

This is just about every young man's fantasy mixed with smutty humor, obnoxious behaviors, and crazy.  But that's what these relationships are all about.  Andrew is not a true blue hero, in that he did, after all, lie to the mother telling her he is older than he really is.  Neither is Rob, as he is rather ridiculous in his practical jokes and insistance that his friend become sexually active.  In short, it's just a big mess.  This is not the behavior of the rich and privledged, to be sure, but all the hilarious things that we don't want to admit.  We are insecure, we are unhappy, we reach out to others to find happiness only to find it crash down upon us.  It's part of the growing pains.  It's not the most profound of statements, but we find our way no matter what socio economic bracket we come from.",1336953600,,2076,4.4015748031496065

657432,4,6303471404,"Looking at ""Class"" again more than 20 years after I first saw it, I found it a better movie than I remembered. I could only recall a mediocre teen dramedy starring two Brat Packers, but this script is as smart and funny as it is flawed. Jonathan (Andrew McCarthy) is a working class young man who attends a posh prep school his senior year in hopes of getting into Harvard. His introduction to Vernon Academy is a humiliating prank played by his rich roommate Skip (Rob Lowe), but after a few bumps, they become fast friends. Determined to help Jonathan out with the ladies, Skip packs him off to a pick-up bar in Chicago one weekend. In spite of his clumsiness -or because of it- Jonathan meets an exciting older woman named Ellen (Jacqueline Bisset), and they begin an affair. But Ellen eventually discovers Jonathan's age. And Jonathan discovers that Ellen is Skip's mother.

The prep school antics really are funny, not just tired sophomoric jokes. The scene of the Vernon Academy dance committee's disastrous meeting with their counterparts at nearby Foxfield girls' school is among the funniest slapstick I've seen. I like the rapport between Jonathan and Skip, characters from disparate backgrounds who share an easy-going nature. And Rob Lowe was looking his best in 1983. Andrew McCarthy looks pasty but still charming. I either never noticed or had forgotten the film's clever jabs at ideologues on both ends of the political spectrum. The leftist rich girls theorizing about the problems of the poor are hilarious. They're counterbalanced by the laissez-faire businessman who insists upon protectionist trade. ""Class"" is definitely not intended to be political, but it doesn't ignore what's going on in the periphery or underwrite those scenes.

""Class"" has a confused tone after Ellen's identity is discovered, however. The change is abrupt and vacillates between the comic and the serious for the rest of the movie. The film seems not to know quite what it's trying to be at that point. I think that introducing Ellen's problems into the story was probably a mistake. It would have been better had she not had a personality change but simply acted as a person caught in an awkward situation would. But the comedic elements of ""Class"" are good, and Jonathan and Skip are an enjoyable duo.

657435,4,6303471404,"The mid 80s...sadly, the biggest event during this period in my life was the introduction of cable into my household, and all the cathode tubular promise it held...I actually skipped school one day to stay home and watch The Road Warrior...it was totally worth it, but I'm not recommending any of you youngins' out there to follow my lead...remember, as Mr. T said, `Only a fool skips out on school!'...well, maybe he didn't, but it does sounds like something he'd say, right?  As one just coming into his formulative teen years, it afforded me, among other things, the opportunity to see all kinds of naughty, naughty movies (thank you Cinemax, or as we called it, Skinamax) primarily due to the fact this was before the time of programmable parental control features...the only control feature back then was the chance of your mother coming downstairs and beating you silly for watching something she didn't approve of...anyway, this was how I first saw the film Class (1983), a movie I watched again last night for the first time in about 20 years.  Directed by Lewis John Carlino (The Great Santini), the film stars Rob Lowe, whom we saw three years earlier dealing with the crisis of being a schoolboy father in an After School Special aptly titled `Schoolboy Father', Andrew McCarthy (St. Elmo's Fire, Mannequin), in his screen debut, and Jacqueline Bisset, who, in my opinion, is responsible for single-handedly introducing the wet T-shirt fad from her role in the film The Deep (1977).  Also appearing is Cliff Robertson (Charly, Three Days of the Condor), Alan `Cameron' Ruck (Ferris Bueller's Day Off) along with a number of now famous actors for whom this was their first film, including John Cusack (The Grifters), Virginia Madsen (Electric Dreams), Casey Siemaszko (Biloxi Blues), and Lolita Davidovich (Blaze).

McCarthy plays Jonathan Onger, a highly intelligent, yet awkward and introverted young man from a modest (poor) family with dreams of attending Harvard Law School, and is on his way after receiving a scholarship to a prestigious prep school.  On arriving, Jonathan meets his roommate in Franklin 'Skip' Burroughs IV (Lowe), whose basically the exact opposite of Jonathan in that Skip is charming, outgoing, well groomed, polished, and just generally sure of himself to a fault...oh yeah, he also comes from an extremely affluent family (which you could have probably guessed given a name like that).  Anyway, Jonathan has a difficult time fitting in (not helped by a very public practical joke played on him by Skip on the first day), but finds a certain amount of respect after he turns the tables on Skip, basically giving as good as he got...the two become fast friends as Jonathan helps Skip with his scholastic difficulties while Skip helps Jonathan with his social inadequacies.  After an incident at the sister school while planning an upcoming dance, Jonathan isn't allow to attend, but Skip convinces him to got to nearby Chicago for some much needed action, which he does, and how...in that of a vibrant, attractive, classy, sophisticated, older woman named Ellen (Bisset), who initially takes pity on the poor schlub, eventually molesting him in an elevator (pity sex...it's a beautiful thing).  Anyway, the two spend the weekend together, after which Jonathan returns a hero to his fellow classmates, inundated with a newfound respect.  The relationship continues hot and heavy, and we can see Jonathan is falling in love (guys generally fall in love with the first woman they get it on with), but Ellen's only interested in a fling, and after learning Jonathan's actually a high school student (he made himself out to be a college man), she quickly takes off, leaving him depressed and heartbroken...and then things get better, as Jonathan finds he's been accepted into Harvard...but things quickly go down the proverbial toilet as certain events take place, including, but not limited to, an investigation at the school regarding widespread fraud...with circumstances threatening Jonathan's friendship with Skip along with his academic future...

First of all, if you're coming into this movie expecting some flesh, you're probably going to be disappointed as Bisset never bares all (very little, in fact), as the only scene displaying anything features Virginia Madsen suffering from a serious wardrobe malfunction eerily reminiscent of the Janet Jackson/Justin Timberlake Superbowl fiasco.  This was kind of a strange film in that respect, as it started of with the seeming intent of being sort of a teen sex comedy, but changes course about halfway through dealing with material of a more serious nature (which ends up getting severely slighted).  The transition was smooth, but didn't go unnoticed.  One thing that surprised me a little was that while the characters were essentially stereotypical, there was little animosity towards Jonathan from his wealthy peers in terms of his coming from a comparatively poor family...yeah, they didn't care for him much in the beginning, but that was more from the fact he was a nerdy dink than anything else.  Overall I did enjoy this film, despite its inadequacies, as the actors managed to add dimensionality to what could have been very shallow characters, but there is a sense of unreality in terms of Jonathan hooking up with Ellen as it provided false hope to those of us males who saw this at an impressionable age, believing that there were actually incredibly beautiful, vivacious, wealthy, older women out there looking to have intimate relations with gawky, awkward, nave, inexperienced teenage boys...perhaps there are, but I never met one, and neither did any of my peers.  Jonathan was presented as an extremely pitiful character (especially in terms of being a target of a few practical jokers), but I found it hard to accept Ellen would willingly pursue him the way she did, despite any amount of pity or alcohol (later we find out she might be mentally deranged, which could explain a lot).  This isn't a putdown towards Mr. McCarthy, but more towards the unrealistic aspect of the story...but then again, Hollywood relies on suspension of disbelief from its audiences (sometimes too much), so if you can get past this, you'll enjoy the movie a whole lot more.  One really strange aspect was the abruptness of the ending...seems like there should have been more story...

The picture, available in both widescreen (1.85:1) and fullscreen pan & scan formats, looks very good, but the Dolby Digital 2.0 audio felt a little soft, specifically during the dialog (oddly, the music came through loud and clear).  There's nothing really in terms of special features, unless you count an original theatrical trailer, which I don't (to me that's a standard feature, and not an extra).

And apparently the ""more"" should have been in it.  That's right, this film was cut considerably then, so much so that Jacqueline Bissett felt the cut film did not portray her in the light she wanted.  The end product sees her as a scathing nympho with no respect for anyone.

657437,5,6303471404,"Teenage angst was a popular theme for directors during the nineteen eighties, with films such as 'St. Elmo's Fire', 'The Outsiders', and 'The Breakfast Club' dominating our video rental stores and television screens. Cinemagoers had been introduced to a fresh bunch of actors, known predominantly through media circles as 'the brat pack'. Rob Lowe, the star of 'Class' and 'Youngblood', was one of these new and talented young actors.
'Class' tells the story of two Ivy League students participating in the kind of irresponsible antics associated with adolescence: late night trips to the nearby girls' school, using fake ID in order to buy alcohol, and smoking after 'lights out'. Foxfield is a fun place to be.
But the film has its dark side. Skip (Rob Lowe, 'Oxford Blues', 'The Outsiders'), is the self-confident joker, whose intention is to get into Harvard with as little effort - and as much fun - as possible. Although his parents are disgustingly wealthy, they are unhappy. Skip is aware of this, but nevertheless hides his fears and concerns behind an ostentatious exterior. Jonathan (Andrew McCarthy, 'Catholic Boys', 'Less than Zero', 'Pretty in Pink')finds Skip's overbearing personality hard to deal with at times. He is awkard and clumsy, lacking the charm and confidence exuded by his handsome roommate. Things change for Jonathan when he takes a trip to New York, but the change is transitory, and the tone of the movie rapidly adopts a melancholy atmosphere from that point onwards.
There are some memorable moments in 'Class', most notably the fight between Skip and Jonathan. The director has juxtaposed the humor and seriousness skilfully, and has succeeded in producing an entertaining and enjoyable teen film. Also stars Jaqueline Bissett, Cliff Robertson, John Cusack, Alan Ruck, and Casey Seimasko.
'Youngblood' sees Rob Lowe teaming up with Patrick Swayze ('The Outsiders', 'Red Dawn') for this ice hockey film that oozes testosterone. It is the story of a talented young ice hockey player who is offered a chance to play the sport professionally. But possessing a stubborn and highly strung character, can he succeed? If he fails, he will end up back on the family farm, somewhere out in the boondocks. 'Youngblood' offers action, drama, and romance. And Hockey. Also stars Ed Lauter, Cynthia Gibb, and Keanu Reeves.
This DVD is a worthwhile investment, as both films compensate for the limited extras.",1080518400,2,2429,5.16751269035533
657438,4,6303471404,"I must admit that this movie was one of the typical 'Brat Pack' movies.  Rob Lowe and Andrew McCarthy are wonderful as two teenagers who are completely different.  Skip (Lowe) comes from a very wealthy family and is expected to go to Harvard after finishing up at his prep school, Vernon Acadamy.  Jonathan (McCarthy) on the other hand, comes from the city and is in the Middle-Class.  He is not as 'smoothe' as Skip and learns the hard way how to get a woman.
The climax of the story is when Jonathan meets Skip's family.  He has no idea that the woman with whom he has been sleeping with is Skip's mother!  The reaction of the two is great.
This movie is filled with comedy, light drama, and minimal violence.  It's fun to watch, even though it is a bit dated.  For me though, seeing a young Rob Lowe was the thrill!",1058745600,,818,4.3355263157894735
